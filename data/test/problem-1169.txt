"Due to the complexity of the brain, it's not possible to simply wipe out whole memories. Instead it will just close doors. After each session, there's a special potion that you'll need to drink. That will ensure the longevity of the treatment after he completes. It will also encourage your mind to fill in the gaps in your history itself. This is the most organic and safe way." Pansy paused for breath, eyeing the two of them across from her. "Your subconscious will create the alternative memories, so in a way, it's like you get to choose your past."
"You sure you won’t use the Floo? You’ll be fine walking by yourself back home?” Andromeda asked just as Harry closed the door behind him. He’d just made Teddy take his afternoon nap, and the house was finally quiet.
They walked through the spacious front gardens, past the artfully-cut hedges and a row of tended flowers and bushes. Occasionally Draco would stop and look at something for long moments, or veer off track to run his fingers down a potted plant, or along a window ledge, eyes narrowed as he took in little details. Harry followed diligently, keeping a fair distance behind him, giving Draco his space.
Draco looked surprised for a second, his lips parted slightly, but then his face clouded, mouth tightening into a stern line. Sensing the change in mood, that he had gone a step too far, Harry tried to back peddle. “Draco-”
"Good morning, Malfoy,” Potter said, stepping into view and closing the door behind him. He looked far too colourful for the drab greys of Draco's cell. The only thing that gave away that this was not a typical day was the nervous way Potter’s eyes kept darting around the room.
With a dark look, Draco untangled himself and stalked towards the bedroom, reaching in time for Harry to tackle him, making them fall once again, thankfully landing on the futon.
"The worst part,” Malfoy interrupted in a low voice, so quiet that if Harry hadn't been concentrating, he would have missed it, “is that I actually look forward to your visits, no matter how utterly pointless they are, because without them, trapped in here with no contact with any one, I'd go mad.” Malfoy let out a little bitter laugh. “Maybe then they'd deem me a danger to myself and kill me. I wish they would.”
Laughter again hit his ears, utterly devoid of amusement. “Yeah, right. The Ministry would throw me back in jail and there'd be nothing you or your Minister could do about it. And this time there'd be no way out.” Draco shivered at the thought, shoulders curling in on themselves.
"Harry, you're going to have to make a choice about what you want to do.” She stood, one hand brushing down his shoulder to briefly squeeze his hand. Harry squeezed back, his strong fingers curled around her delicate ones, then released her, taking a few steps away.
Draco lifted his shoulder in a half hearted little shrug. “Too many. Growing up with my family. My time at Hogwarts. The War. It's all blurry.”
But it was like being given a taste and having it all snatched away at the last minute, letting you enjoy it just long enough to ensure you'd long for it in every breath you took thereafter.
"Get out,” he said quietly. “I want to be alone.” He threw himself onto the bed, effectively ignoring Harry who left with a heavy heart, wondering exactly what he had done.
"When exactly would I have had a favourite memory?” Malfoy snapped, giving Harry a dark look. “When I took the Dark Mark because my father told me to? When I tortured and did horrible things to other people because I was too afraid that the Dark Lord will do those things to me if I didn't follow him? When I tried to do this one task assigned to me and yet I still failed to kill Dumbledore? Before a
It was so unfair. The rest of their journey back had been...incredible. Amongst other things, Harry had discovered that sleeping rough was a lot more enjoyable when you had another person to wind yourself around, and even if Malfoy grumbled about it, he didn't push him away. Much. And although increasingly distracted, they had explored...a little. Harry didn't think Malfoy would have minded but he hadn't wanted to rush, and tried to set them a slow pace- they'd only just managed a tentative companionship, he didn't want to run the risk of destroying their already shaky relationship.
"You still have me,” Harry reminded him, pulling his knees up to his chest and leaning on them. The wall of the cave was cold against his back so he moved forward slightly, wondering how Malfoy could stand it. “So what
"I remember,” Draco murmured, bucking and pressing up into Harry's hand, his head thrown back as he twisted this way and that. “I remember.”
Suddenly seized with an urge to see his partner's face, Harry pulled gently at Draco's hair, bringing him away from where he was licking Harry's collarbone, the hand that wasn't curled around his neck having head down to palm Harry's erection to life. Draco gave a little squeeze, making Harry groan, before raising his head slightly, his breaths coming fast.
"Taking their deal is the coward's way out,” Harry repeated, gritting his teeth, tension lining his face. “I never knew you to run away from your problems again.”
After a few blissful seconds, spent floating on sensation, Draco pressed weakly on his hip, signalling that he wanted Harry to move, making him roll back, so they laid side by side. Ignoring his exhaustion, and the sticky wetness they had created, before falling asleep, Harry forced his eyes open. He watched as Draco's breathing evened out, his face perfectly relaxed, and memorised it.
"Right.” Harry coughed again. “Well. We could. Then. Uhm.” The hand that had fallen out of Draco's hair when he sat up was clenched in his lap. Harry stared at the coffee table.
"What?” Draco grunted, bringing his knees up a little so Harry could rest comfortably between his legs.
"Fine.” Draco looked out of the window, it was sunny today. The treatment hadn't taken long. His mind felt clear.
“Malfoy-” Harry stopped himself. If he wanted to make his point come across, then he should start calling using Malfoy’s given name. “Draco isn’t Lucius. He shouldn’t atone for his parents’ mistakes.”
"I know,” Harry said grimly, glaring at the ground. “It's not like he could do anything with his magic currently suppressed anyway. They're doing it to punish him.”
Afterwards, they lay panting, side by side, letting their bodies cool and listening to the way their breathing fell into synchronization, and then back out. Absorbing what they had done, and what it meant, and trying to work out if things were different now, and if they weren't, why not.
"Harry...” Pansy looked at him with pity. It was an emotion he was getting sick of seeing on the faces of his friends.
There was no surprise in Harry's expression, just acceptance, and some sort of thought going on just under the surface. “Me either. There was a pause in which Harry went back to gently rubbing his thumb against Draco's scalp, and Draco let his eyes drift shut. “Do you want to?”
"Harry?” Draco rubbed his eyes again, trying to gather himself. Normally when he woke, he was more alert. He shifted again, feeling the sheet slip on him. That he wasn't wearing anything occurred to him, and he felt his heart rate increase just a little. He felt suddenly self-conscious, which was ludicrous, because the situation was hardly a novel experience by now, and yet he couldn't mistake the fluttering in his stomach for anything else. It had something to do with the way Harry was looking at him. The way he was looking, not talking, as though the dips and swells of Draco's body were a secret language and Harry was reading it. And at the same time, as if Harry was contemplating something far removed from their bed and the warm sheets, and the grey watery light filtering through the gap in the curtains; something that Draco had no part in.
? You pretended you haven’t caught me yet to buy yourself some time. You’re just like me, Potter. You went after me and my family because you wanted to escape too.” Malfoy’s eyes burned holes on him, but Harry stared right back. “You just won’t admit it. You moved away from everyone and everything at the first chance you got.”
"You'll only drag me back again anyway,” Malfoy said, leaning away slightly in an attempt to put some space between them.
Seeing the way his bones had begun to poke out a little, and the slump to his once proud stance, made Harry want to cry.
"The first one," she replied, just as quietly, relaxing minutely as she realized he wasn't angry. "I volunteered. St. Mungos was already informed about this."
His breath hitching slightly, Harry struggled to keep his fingers from trembling. “Did you tell Pansy?”
Harry wondered what it felt like to walk away from your home. But he didn't speak as he followed Draco out, afraid to break the silence between them, leaving Draco to do so when he was ready.
This had been the routine for weeks now. Potter would talk. Draco would ignore him. And the one-sided conversation was like walking on ice, because one slip up could trigger Draco's constantly brewing anger. And Draco didn't shout, which was somehow worse. The quiet voice, the soft, cutting edge of his tone.
"So much...” Harry didn't mean to say it, but the words came out, and then hung accusingly in the air.
Hearing that Draco had considered the offer felt like being punched in a gut. If his breathing had been strained before, it was nothing compared to the burn he felt now.
Draco's cell was pleasant enough. Grey walls, stone floor, one high, barred window. A bed in one corner with a thin mattress supported by a rickety bedframe. The other corner held a sink and toilet. It was clean, and he didn't have to share.
It was a lie, and they both knew it, so Harry didn't say anything, and Malfoy let out a small sigh before closing the space between them, and in doing so, starting something that he'd known for a long time was inevitable.
"Tastes good though, kinda zingy,” Nevertheless, Harry put the pot down. Malfoy leaned his head back. Harry rested back on his hands, stretched his legs out, digging his heels into the cool sand of the cave floor, and stared. “So?”
"Sorry,” Harry said again, not sounding particularly sorry. “You're not having any side-effects then?”
Eventually, by the time the moon was high in the sky, covering everything in a cool glow, Draco stopped in front of the doorstep.
It was a typical day. Draco was happy-not that it was obvious to anyone but Harry –because it had been four weeks since his release, and The Wizengamot had declared that he could start his training at the Auror department immediately in order to help catch the remaining Death Eaters on the loose. Harry decided to join as well. They had spent the majority of the day alternatively sparring and lying flat on the ground, exhausted, until their easy banter turned to insults, and a fight resulted. Towards the end, their fighting had taken a different twist, leading to an extremely satisfying make out session.
Snorting, Draco gave him a sceptical look. “You guess? You were there, you saw.” His face momentarily darkened. “Being free, even with the conditions...it feels so...” Draco took a deep breath, a slight smile tugging his mouth as he closed his eyes briefly. When he opened them again, he frowned at Harry’s blatant staring. “What did I just say?”
Neville brought Harry a houseplant and made him promise to water it at least three times a week. He told Harry that this plant would need the least maintenance and was safe to be around Muggles. Honestly, Harry really appreciated the thoughtfulness, as taking care of a house plant wasn’t really a desire at the moment. He was really just trying to take care of himself and his clients.
The door opened and Astrid peeked in, her eyes quickly scanning the room before landing on Scorpius. He was still in bed, covered in his blankets and surrounded by the pillows he'd tossed around for comfort last night. He looked her over. She was in jeans today with a black t-shirt that had a print of silhouette boys playing instruments with the word FUN written across it in gold letters. Her hair was wet, making it look a darker red.
Draco spent half an hour teasing Orion with a charmed toy, strategically teaching him the perfect way to jump from the kitchen counter to the top of the fridge. Harry had forbidden him from training Orion anything, so naturally, Draco was trying to come up with the most annoying tricks possible. When he heard Harry walking down the hallway he jumped up and met him at the door. Nothing about the summer had cooled the effect Harry had on Draco, he wanted to touch and taste and feel every part of him as much now as he had when they were in school together. Harry’s magic drew him in like a magnet, wrapping around him in a pleasing hum.
Once Harry sat. Laid? Lounged. Once Harry was properly placed on the chaise lounge he looked over to Draco expectantly.
Heat blooms through Harry, lust pooling in his gut as memories of Charlie's deep voice and rough hands flash through his mind. In New York, everyone had left Harry to recover from his hangover, taking advantage of the trip to go sightseeing. Everyone except for Charlie.
Saturday morning brought with it the yearly invitations to Narcissa Malfoy’s birthday gala. In the kitchen, Draco was explaining to Harry why they needed to buy
"I think he would have been, if that was all that happened. For now I'm sure he's just horrified that your
“He’s not that bad anymore,” Seamus said, “Dean and I have worked with him on a few projects in potions.”
“It’s a selfish act, I assure you,” Draco replied, reaching out to roughly tug on Harry’s shirt. “I want you before we go out.”
A suppressing silence filled the hall, the two of them staring at each other as Harry's heart beat so fast it felt like a wild snitch in his chest. Draco wore a black button-down Oxford with a leather jacket. He had on a pair of distressed dark blue jeans that hung low enough on his hips that Harry suspected they were spelled to stay up. The outfit was topped off with a pair of dragonhide boots that were mostly black with hints of green on the scales.
She stared at him for a moment, as though he were a fascinating display at a museum, then turned to Hermione and said, "Draco was just as bad, maybe worse."
Harry felt his lungs constrict and tried to breathe. He backed up to press against the freshly closed door.
He walked back into the hall, turning left and heading up a slim staircase. Neville's Grandmother had picked the church, and, apparently, it was rumored to be the place King Arthur had gotten married.
“Don’t worry, I’ll let you know when I want to cash in the favor,” Pansy said. She pulled on Draco’s sleeve, leading him away.
She turned to Harry, “Go for a walk and get your nerves under control,” Hermione said. She offered a worn smile, “We are almost through this Harry.”
Harry had kept his eyes studiously on his notes while Malfoy changed, only glancing up when his pants and trousers were on. He watched Malfoy's dexterous fingers button up his shirt and knot his tie, wondering why Malfoy bothered to do that every day. Harry's own tie was hanging on the bedpost with the knot still in it. He only retied it when it was absolutely necessary.
Harry looked back at the other man to see what had made her quiet but he wasn't sure. Draco was still standing there leaned against the entryway with those long legs and that platinum hair and that smile which grew the more Harry looked.
Draco stood outside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, waiting for Potter. He'd explained on the way over that Hermione wanted Potter to come along so the staff was more amenable to answering Draco's questions. He had declined, in every way he could think of, to tell Potter what he was going to ask about. Hopefully he would get a moment alone with whoever was running the shop once Potter worked his magic.
Harry blinked several times then stuffed a forkful of rice into his mouth. Draco had to be fucking with him. Trying to get a reaction. Which was working, based on the way Harry’s heart was beating insistently against his ribcage.
At his words, both Slytherins looked up. Zabini looked as though he couldn't be much bothered with Harry. Which was just fine, because Harry wasn't focused on him anyway. When Pansy lifted her face off of Zabini's chest and looked up, Harry could see a bruise blooming on her left cheekbone.
“Don’t. Don’t say it because I already had to hear it once. The only reason I’m not shoving you back out the door is because you are Draco’s little pet.”
“And after that?” Draco asks between kisses, voice rough, with Harry's body thrusting up against him. He shifts his weight, pulling Harry's legs forward and standing above him.
Harry gives her a quizzical look, "Just making sure. You and Ron-" he trails off with a wave of his hand as though it sums up his point.
“Fine,” Potter said, standing from the bed to cross his arms and lean against the bedpost. His eyes moved purposefully to Draco who was still shirtless, having only managed to pull on a pair of trousers.
Potter lets out a bitter chuckle. "It's the real Malfoy. He has the worst timing. Just hang on, all right? I'll get rid of him."
With Pansy’s penchant for gossip Hermione knew that Malfoy wasn’t holding the same grudges he had in his youth, that he was living with her, that he was single, and that he was dedicated to restoring his place in wizarding society. It was plenty to work with. Perhaps a compliment will warm him up.
"Yeah, Hermione's got it. Everything is set. I'm going to ask him at Madam Malkins when we return the robes for your wedding."
Draco walked down to level -4 and headed straight for Boot’s office. He knocked on the door and waited for it to open, reminding himself that he had worked very hard to get to this position and that he needed to remain calm. Even in the face of an insufferably smug coworker, he must hold composure. The door opened and Draco walked in, glancing around the office to make sure they were alone.
Harry sat back down and drained the last half of his drink. He motioned to Draco's mug and said, "You should finish drinking that so we can get a refill."
Dad huffed a laugh, "It absolutely does not." He turned back to the hot tub. "Where did this come from?"
"That'll be all Kreacher," Potter said, standing to grab his own plate. "Thank you," he added, though it sounded as if it pained him.
“I work for a non-profit. The office is just outside of London proper. My wife’s sister started it in ‘97. I began volunteering in January of ‘99 and became an employee after the first month,” Dudley replied. His words seemed hesitant, as though he was trying to speak carefully and not stumble over them. “I met my wife there, actually. We had a,” he glanced quickly at his daughter and then back to Harry, “somewhat quick dating period, and married in the Spring of 2000.”
Luna pulled off of Harry and turned to Draco with a bright smile, said hi to him, and pulled him into an embrace. Harry gawked at the pair, trying to piece together how this was possible.
Pansy's hand was cool when she laid it over Harry’s wand hand. "Potter," she said softly. She gently pushed his hand down and the boy let it fall to his side. "I will finish the wall. You aren't helping anything here."
"I don't have your wand on me," Harry said, pulling out his own. "You can use mine," he added, handing over the holy wand.
Once inside, Potter directed Draco to the kitchen and set out their meal. Or, rather, he attempted to set it out. The oldest house-elf in existence appeared before Potter got very far. He complained loudly until Potter relented and sat down, waiting for the elf to serve the food.
Draco leaned back against the building, letting his head fall back to expose a long pale neck. Harry stepped closer, trying to ignore the way his magic was whipping around in his body.
Draco is in the hallway leading to the landing of his and Pansy’s flat. He peeks around the corner to get a better view of the scene unfolding at the entryway. Potter is leaned against the door, hands stuffed into his pockets and looking as though he’s trying very hard not to smile. Pansy is spitting venom at him with her wand to his throat.
Choosing to believe that password had nothing to do with him, Harry stepped onto the moving staircase. Behind Draco, Harry was thankful the blonde was in robes. The last thing he needed was another good view of Draco's ass. Nope. Harry had seen enough of that at the quarterly financials meeting. Draco always wore a tailored suit, something muggle made from that new shop in London.
Harry felt his cheeks heat up and ran his fingers through his hair in an attempt to hide the evidence of the blush, “What is it you wanted Malfoy?”
, spoke up with a lazy smile on his lips, “Is that really the last name you’re vying for in this house?”
He'd barely managed a locking charm and a silencing spell before Draco's teeth had nipped their way down his body and swallowed his freshly hardened cock. As the blonde's throat tightened around the head of Harry's cock they both moaned, and Harry felt it vibrate throughout his entire body. He crashed into a vision-blurring orgasm with Draco's name on his lips. When his eyes refocused he looked down to watch the boy licking off the last bit of cum before he stood to attack Harry with a heated kiss. Tasting himself on Draco's lips was one of the most addictive experiences Harry had ever lived through.
Harry thought. Though he didn’t believe that entirely. If anything, the truth was, he was more worried Draco would live up to the rumors; he’d be the best lay of Harry’s life and then bail on him completely.
Harry received a letter from owl post on July 31st, 1998, before he’d even started making his morning cup of tea.
“You were going to tell me something, in the hot tub, when I asked if you wanted to come back to my room.”
"Then I would go with the basics if you think they will like the sound of it. J’ai envie de toi, I want you. Or Je veux te baiser, if you want to be more," Draco said, running a hand through his hair, "explicit."
but she would certainly claim ignorance if asked. Draco is dressed in a set of black high-collar robes with silver trim. He would have looked severe if not for a soft smile and the mischief dancing in those grey eyes.
Anyone who has read Rambunctious Roommates or Wallbanger knows I'm not as big on Angst. But... There is plenty of room for it.
Harry’s throat goes dry, despite the copious amounts of water he’s been drinking all night. He runs a hand through his hair, causing his messy locks to further dishevel. He peeks up at Charlie through the loose strands that fall over his left eye.
Her chin lifted and, for a moment, Harry thought she was going to decline. He was surprised to realize that it mattered to him, he couldn't see the purpose of her formality after she had saved his life.
Scorpius and Astrid headed toward the exit when Scorpius heard a suspiciously familiar voice. He tugged on her shirt and they went down a hallway to the left.
"Mr. Potter, we have asked you here today to discuss a sensitive issue," she began, "You are aware that Dolores Umbridge is on the education board at the Ministry?"
OK. Fine. It's not like he'd never thought about it. But it was always, what was that word Hermione loved? Dysfunctional. It was always a dysfunctional fantasy where he would shut Draco up with his cock, or shove him against the wall after a duel and leave bruises on his neck with his teeth, or cum on his face, or his chest, or his ass, or anywhere really. But especially inside him.
He must have made a sound because Pansy looked down at him, having significant height from her position on the desk, and said, "Oh don't look like a kicked puppy. You have nothing to be jealous over. I'm sure many a wank has been blessed with thoughts of Draco Malfoy. A clothing line is far less scandalous."
Ok. This chapter was pretty difficult to pull out of my brain but I finally got it written and tweaked for your pleasure!
Harry narrowed his eyes and said nothing. He knew from her time as a Professor at Hogwarts, that the decisions Dolores tended to make bordered on the extreme. He could only hold his breath and hope that he would not be somehow forced to carve anything else into human flesh.
"Oh, yes," McGonagall said, seeming to come back to herself.  "It's a bit ridiculous really, and I'm sorry to call you out on this Mr. Potter, but I think the idea was from Albus."
She then looked from Draco to Harry and back again before saying, "I presume the two of you can be trusted not to antagonize each other? I need to go back to my office and write owls to several parents."
"Oh Merlin," Ginny whispered. When Harry looked back at the fire he could tell Ginny could see Draco. "This can't be happening," she said.
After dinner, Harry grabbed his broom and headed out to the pitch. This was his last-ditch effort to keep his thoughts clear. He knew there was no hope of that in his room. Not with the torture Blaise had been orchestrating. Besides, Malfoy would be getting done with his shower soon and, honestly, Harry didn’t think he could hold it together when Malfoy walked in wearing only a bathrobe.
“Ok. I’ll be done in a minute,” he replied as he ran his tongue in one long, smooth stripe up the underside of Harry's cock. Harry, throwing a clamped hand against his mouth in an effort to stay quiet, thought he might die from a desperate need to come.
Draco laid the wand on the table between them and looked at Harry, "So where is my wand?" he asked. His voice was barely a whisper in the quiet garden.
Draco fists his fingers into Potter’s shirt pushing him against his bedroom door to meet his lips in a bruising kiss. Potter moans in approval and pulls Draco flush against him kissing back the way Potter always does, all heat passion and force. Draco rolls his tongue against the slide of Potter’s at the same time as his hips, letting his erection press deliciously against Potter’s.
Hermione wrapped her arms around Pansy, pulling the front of her own body flush against the Slytherin, and placing her chin on Pansy's shoulder to look over at him."It's more than worth it Harry. Ron thinks it's the best thing that could have happened to him."
Potter’s thought came through a bit stronger than normal and Blaise made sure to strengthen his occlumancy walls. He needed to be careful with this, drinking wasn’t the smartest idea when it came to keeping any type of wall up.
Draco conjured a table before the three of them and they all started in on the homework. Blaise was nearly done with the multiple choice section when Hermione stormed into the common room.
Blaise let his head fall back against the wall, incapable of any thought except for the lewd way Neville’s lips spread around his cock. Neville was all tongue and lips and the perfect hint of teeth and, even better, enthusiastic, for the task at hand. He sucked Blaise down like he was starving for it, and as Blaise’s balls started to tighten, he wondered who Neville had learned this from.
"You look much healthier,” Luna said, touching his cheek as the tips of his ears turned pink. “Would you like a radish?” She reached into her bag and pulled out a string of radishes.
"And there would be some advantages to you guys rooming together," Ginny said. Both boys glanced down at her then at each other.
A slight blush tinged Harry's cheeks and he fought to keep it from going full down his neck as he remembered the prefects bathroom in 4th year. "Fine," he amended, "I've never messed around with anyone in Gryffindor."
Teddy sucked in a surprised breath, his lips barely responding until James pulled back. “Jamie,” he said James’ name like it was a gift, a promise. “I’m trying really hard to do this right.”
“Nev and I were just going over some projects. So what do you need help with?” he said. Even through the flames, Harry could see the charm in Blaise’s smile.
Blaise scowled at his friend's cocked eyebrow. “No. We’re not dating." Deciding to ignore Draco, Blaise continued, "He’s brilliant with his mouth though. I bet I can get a repeat performance of that when Potter’s incessant thoughts aren’t in my head.”
"Yeah, I guess you're right. It will be different," he said. Then reluctantly added, "I'm not going to be here next week. I have," he ran his hand over the back of his neck, "some stuff to do."
Pansy crossed her arms and leaned against a wall, "Obviously, Savior. You owe me. To your gryffindor mind it's going to feel a lot more like exploitation than anything else."
"Last night was well worth being tired for my meetings today." It was a man's voice, it sounded like the loudmouth from last night, but his voice was rougher now.
"Dudley," Harry said, obviously uncomfortable, "you should have called first. It would have made this," he gave a hesitant smile, "better."
The response is unexpected and Blaise peeks over at Potter’s face to gauge what he means by that statement. Then he realizes he hasn’t been hearing Potter’s thoughts all day. “Potter. Did you learn Occlumancy?”
Draco watched him, debating the idea of making Potter go back to the ministry. Did he really need him to come along? No. Did he have the authority to override Granger? Definitely not. He sighed heavily and tried to level out his tone when he said, "I
Emily looked it over, a wry smile tilting her lips. "It appears to be Draco Harry slash art. Very well done, I might add." She looked up at Draco, "What, did you think Draco was straight?"
Harry looked at him, enjoying the sight of blown pupils in those silver eyes, "Whatever you want, love," he said, his voice unsteady as Draco's hand stared to move.
"I will send a house elf to check on her," McGonagall said. "I'm sure she doesn't want this public so I won't force her to the infirmary unless necessary."
Harry stared at both of them blinking more than necessary, his mind racing, until he found his voice. "He said he wouldn't tell me about them until our third date."
Draco’s lips spread into a predatory grin, tongue running lightly against his sharp teeth, as he watched Harry tug off his clothes until he was left in only boxers. Harry shoved them all into a pile and sank into the water, giving Draco a look of challenge. Draco, unphased and holding Harry’s eyes, pointed his wand to his chest. In a blink, Draco was stripped to his boxers, his clothes folded neatly, sitting on a table that had popped up from the deck.
Astrid looked up at him with a guilty smile, “I’ll try not to fidget." She considered him for a moment, he was pleasing to look at, just as attractive as Pi. Draco lacked the easy charm of his son, but still drew people in. She thought it might be his general dismissal. The public was always clamoring to get his attention, break through the indifference, catch a rare compliment from his lips. His endorsement of something certainly held weight. With his family though, he gave his affection freely, and Astrid had been delighted when he began to compliment her in earnest while they played a game of Wizard's chest last weekend. She could see why the press was still desperate for any scraps Draco and Harry tossed them for a story.
Harry rolled his eyes, "I don't want to be an auror. I'm sick of chasing down clues and dark wizards," he replied. "Also, I'm not doing anything to you. This was done to me so I wouldn't act on my baser instincts."
They were in Professor Loire's DADA classroom. She had chaperoned most of the student populace to Hogsmeade. Both boys had opted to stay out of the public eye and keep to the castle instead. Currently, Harry was supposed to be grading the 5th year's essays on boggarts.
Harry leaned against the wall taking several deep breaths before returning to the room with Hermione and Ron.
"I thought we agreed to just be us, not who we were during the war," Harry said as he slid his hands down to grope Draco's pert ass and rolled his hips, causing the blonde to gasp, "Maybe you're having trouble because you want this as much as I do."
After they left, Harry purchased the outfit that had Draco’s fingerprints all over it, and left the rest in the dressing room.
“Hang on!” Pansy’s voice calls to him from the banister and Draco starts to breathe again. He takes a moment to come back to himself. He doesn’t have panic attacks very often anymore, but his survival instincts have never fully received the message about the war being over.
After redressing and a round of lazy snogging, Draco pulled back and said, "If you want to have me," he paused when Harry leaned forward to cover his neck in kisses, "for nearly two months I'm going to need time to tie up some loose ends."
He stood from the chair and smoothed out his black robes. “Thank you for your time, Boot,” he said, headed for the door.
But the words had been there, and they had been powerful too. Harry’s mind filled with the confessions they had both shared since Draco’s birthday. All the violent, sweet perfect words they had said.
"Then don't." Hermione let go of his arm to point a finger at Draco. "If you want to know if Harry fancies you then you're just going to have to ask him yourself."
Draco hates every last gryffindor he's ever met. He tries to hold onto his anger but the weight of Potter's arms feels good on his hips. His body betrays him, leaning forward to get closer to Potter's warmth. "You need to go talk to her. Fix this."
Zabini stepped up behind her, reaching past her waist to take hold of the bottle. "Nicely done Potter," he flashed a charming smile at Hermione. "I'll just get this behind the bar."
Ginny laughed brightly, "Wow. You two are more fun together than I would have guessed. " She looked at Pansy, "So, what do you call me?" she asked, her voice light with amusement.
Luna furrowed her brow, "Oh Harry,” she said, her voice full of pity. “You should see them. A Merlin falcon could help you a lot, I think.”
Draco felt heat spread through his chest at the thought, the flush creeping up his neck. He was likely blushing all the way to his ears. He peeked up at Potter, who was also blushing. "It's all right," he said, pleased to hear the words didn't squeak out. "I don't need to know details."
"They both did. Wanted me to know why my services had been called upon," Ron's smile grew impossibly bigger. "You're welcome, by the way," he said.
"Pansy?" Draco Malfoy's voice struck Harry so thoroughly that any hope for their conversation to continue died on the spot. He stood, feeling frozen the ground.
Zabini leaned close and tapped a finger on Harry's left temple. "Potter, I'm in here. You don't have to lie to me. I already know that you're smitten. I know all about it."
Harry's eyes traveled down, noting the way Malfoy's shirt was slit up the side to show a sliver of skin.
"Should have given me notice before it got serious," Harry says, "I would have snagged one more night with you.” He wouldn't have though, not if Charlie was falling for the bloke. Harry doesn’t have a lot of lines, hasn’t for a while now, but he would never come between two people falling in love.
Harry glanced up at Neville, then back at Zabini. “Just make sure this stays between us,” he said firmly. “Come on Neville, let’s go for a walk, I need some fresh air.”
In the shower Harry watched as the water cascaded down Draco's torso. In the heat, the silver lines of the
“I would need a lot of time for a job like that,” he said, “what kind of budget are you working with?”
“It’s good. I think you are going to like the rooms, and we are nearly done with that area,” Harry said. He stood up to start the kettle, “Do you want a cuppa?”
with Draco to end, but knowing he didn't have a way to draw it out without being obvious. Finally, he said, "Yes, I think I'm ready."
Potter huffed a laugh. “Sorry, Malfoy,” he said, “Hermione told you to take me to dinner and come back to mine.”
Draco's breath hitches at the words. "Fuck Potter," he says. The words to come out breathy and needy instead of the admonishment he'd been going for.
"No way," Daphne said. "If I see Hermione with her top off tonight then my sister will lose her shit on me."
Draco stalks across the room and flicks Potter on the forehead, right on his infamous scar, "If that were true don't you think I would have taken advantage of having the fucking
Draco raised an eyebrow, giving a look that said he couldn't quite believe the depth of Harry's innocence. Harry blushed,
The girl tore his eyes from Draco to meet Harry's, her cheeks pink, "Sorry. I didn't realize I said that out loud."
“Is that a yes?” Harry breathes out the words between kisses, holding Draco by his collar, keeping him close with the drag of teeth on Draco’s lower lip.
you, but I bet she wants you there." Pansy glances up now, giving Draco a significant look. "Potter will be there," she says.
“Well good luck with that," Blaise said. "Dating a Gryffindor probably isn’t that different than a Hufflepuff. I imagine he’ll want you holding hands and accepting flowers.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He knew Malfoy was sleeping on the couch in the common room when he wasn’t in their room because he always checked the map. Not that he cared about where Malfoy slept, he just wanted to make sure that he wasn’t up to something. Though Harry knew that was unlikely, Malfoy was so subdued with everyone else that the only thing he was likely ‘up to’ was avoidance.
By Friday morning, Harry thought he may have well and truly lost his mind. The last two nights he’d listened to the Wallbanger-
too many times, the three of them were sat in a private room and fed fish and chips with butterbeer.
"I have word that she will not be there forever. Until that change is in effect though, she still holds a lot of power at the Ministry," McGonagall paused, seeming to brace herself before the next statement. "She has made some decisions about your return to Hogwarts. We will need to comply with them until her position changes."
Draco looked him over carefully, "I know it's not on purpose. You just don't know how to do anything without giving all of yourself."
"This is not why I came," Draco said, seeming far too calm for someone who had been yelling so recently.
“Don’t freak out,” Macmillan said in a whisper, “I’m helping you. Harry is watching us through that window.” His eyes flicked over to the picture window, which held a display of Weasley fireworks, then back to Draco.
Harry leans against the bar edging in a bit closer to Charlie. "It is. They were all terrible chaperones."
However, this story didn't start until four years after the war, when they were twenty-two. Let's catch you up.
“Holy gods," Draco said, breaking the silence. "I think I’m dating Harry Potter.” He sat down hard on the bed. “I can't believe this. I’m dating the fucking Savior of the Wizarding World.”
Apparently that was enough to break Lucius of his silence. He sneered at the site of their contact. “Don’t lie Draco, Potter already told me that you’re he's not a client of yours,” Lucius said.
After May 1998 Draco spent four months in Azkaban and then eight months at Hogwarts. The day after graduation he left for France and spent most of his time making potions, reading, and seducing pretty French boys.
Harry stood and made to leave before Zabini grabbed him. The boy was laughing. "Relax, I'm just taking the piss," Zabini said. "You were right, I am attractive, and everyone knows it, including myself. Now sit down."
Harry smiled at her. He promised himself for the hundredth time that he would stop taking her for granted, "Mione, I," he stopped talking and hugged her instead. He looked over the top of her head at Ron.
Harry waited, fear-numb, as the wolf approached, pressing its head against Harry’s hand. Teddy's disembodied voice floated from the mouth of the wolf. "Harry no one is hurt but we need your assistance. Please follow the Patronus and don't kill me when you get here."
"Just noticing that you have all the subtlety of a 16-year-old girl. The two of you were giving me the exact same look while you were in line."
Draco captured his mouth in another kiss, slipping his hand down to press his palm against Harry's cock through his trousers. "Feel how hard you are? So needy for me. How are you going to get through the vows?"
"Which you know about," he said as she remembered how to breathe, "because Teddy told me that you two saw us."
Hermione walks into the Ministry atrium 20 minutes before an all-hands meeting with her staff. She's dressed in a stylized light grey pant-suit that hugs her ass and flares out over tall boots, providing an illusion that her legs are longer than they actually are. Pansy had gushed praise when Hermione bought the suit and insisted she pair it with a light pink blouse, stating, "It brings a copper sheen to those doe eyes you're sporting."
Sorry for the late reply folks! Life hit me real hard and I fell Ill, but I am recovering now and am back to updating!
Drake had essentially just sold his soul to Trelawney and logically Draco had been less than appreciative of that fact.
That was his future self? Why in the world had he tampered with time of all things? How all this was going to affect his first year at Hogwarts and what in the world was going to happen to Draco?
"Just read the column Adrian. We thought you knew already but clearly not." The other girl cut in, the force of both their gazes clearly forcing the other boy to rein himself in and pick up the paper. Within moments, the red on his cheeks and and the scowl on his features faded and paled to a ghostly white.
"Nonsense. This is for your own wellbeing after all, and besides, you owe me for saving you from Quirrel. Don't worry. It shouldn't take you too long." She drawled. "Just a little marking for me is all, to really strengthen that mental grit."
He had actually almost forgotten that there would be consequences for his sudden change in attitude and conscience, Slytherins were a suspicious lot, especially surrounding issues like Blood or the war. And as such, he would have expected a conversation like this to occur more likely with Nott or amongst his fellow housemates rather than a Weasley of all things.
Idly dipping a cookie into her tea, Trelawney spoke without turning towards Draco. "Because that too is part of the gift of Sight."
There was silence for a moment, Draco tightening his grip ever so slightly, before Quirrel seemed to heave a sigh, and the sound of shuffling robes struck his ears as the DADA professor rose from their crouched position.
Such as the one he was currently writing as of this moment. It was a piece Trelawney had provided him details to, about some man currently fighting with his former friend for ownership of their shared company, warning him of how his dear old pal had apparently snapped and was now soon to make an attempt at something clearly rather drastic. Dear Merlin, what in the world could have happened to this man?
Lucius smiled at the sight of them, before spelling the items he had brought to set themselves down along with the rest of Draco’s things. “New indeed.” He spoke then, walking forward and extending a hand to ruffle the younger blonde’s hair. “And here I was getting concerned you were never going to get past the excessive gel phase. I am beyond relieved.”
“My, my look at the manners on this one.” Narcissa smirked, giving the boy a couple playful pokes to the ribs, causing Draco to descend into a fit of giggles. “Hasn't even been a day from home and already so mature. Alright, now let us away.” And they vanished with a pop, reappearing inside the curve of a small alcove along the old brick walls of Kings Cross. From there they made their way around the building towards the entrance, and slipped inside.
Standing now, lined up alongside and amongst his fellow classmates, Draco could feel the dozens of eyes looking upon his form from all angles of the Great Hall. The faint sounds of whispering echoing all around him, from the tables all throughout where the other students sat, and from his fellow first-years excitedly and fearfully murmuring amongst themselves about how the sorting would be conducted.
But Hermione could only barely hear the older woman as she bolted from the class, joining the countless other students scattered across the halls, eyes hunting fervently for the ever distinct sight of silver blonde hair. She couldn’t believe she had gotten so stuck in her own thoughts that she had actually bloody lost him. This was horrendous. Hopefully he was still somewhere nearby.
Draco couldn’t help but pause at that last acknowledgement. It was very clear that these were Drake’s past associations with his old Longbottom, but a Malfoy friends with blood traitor? Now, that was absurd. The Longbottoms were next to bottom rung in terms of power and prestige amongst Pureblood society, whatever could have happened to his supposed older self to lower themselves to such base standards in terms of connections?
Suddenly feeling ill and decently confused, all Draco could do was give his mother a nod and try to stop the unexplainable discomfort churning in his gut. What in the world was this sensation. Like a weight in his stomach and a foul taste in his mouth, all pertaining to those filthy blood traitors.
"They didn't!" Another voice from further down the table cut in, an older boy several years older than them. If Draco could recall correctly he was supposed to be the Quidditch team captain for Slytherin. Flinch something or other. Draco knew he really should have committed to memory all of the names and faces of the more prominent members of his household as a proper Slytherin looking to network, but with the more than plentiful amount of stress he already found himself dealing with on the daily, he'd come to the rather quick acknowledgement that he simply couldn't be bothered to even attempt any Slytherin social climbing at this point. Maybe after the break. Possibly.
Chuckling at the statement, Narcissa extended a hand towards Draco. “Ahh yes. Pleasant as she is, Madame Malkins certainly does have a tendency to drag things on far longer than necessary. Now, come along dear. Time for us to go.”
“Hello there Mr. Malfoy. I’ve been expecting you.” The woman smirked, conjuring a small stool for herself to sit on as Draco continued to gawk, sliding one leg right up above the other and bringing her hands forward to rest her chin upon.
A vision? Was that what that was? No. It couldn't be. Visions were supposed to be about the future. To see and glimpse what lay ahead, not behind. The break in at Gringotts had been almost a month ago now.
Draco was silent for a moment. "I'm not even going to try and understand what you just said just now. And instead I'm just going to correctly assume it was something dumb."
"The poor bastards got outed. Had their brooms ripped right out from under their tiny nads." Flinch -
Feeling a nudge at his side, Draco turned to look and take in the sight of a taller rounder boy fidgeting quite awkwardly in place. Eyes turned towards the front and seemingly unaware of bumping into him just now. Medium length brown hair, brown eyes with chubby sort of cheeks and two large front teeth he was using to very effectively brutalize his lower lips. A name came to mind quickly and without preamble, as well as a series of emotions and thoughts surrounding the larger child.
"Please Potter, no small talk. You clearly have no skill for it. Here let me. How have classes been for you, oh Chosen one."
“Yes, but also no need to rush Draco. Take some time to get your bearings, your mother and I, and Severus are all right here.”
She was starting to see red at this point. She never knew it could just bleed into her vision like rain down a windshield. “So you’re saying I’m not worth your time then? I’ll have you know I’m already at the top of the class in almost all of my subjects and have always been top of the class ever since I was little.”
“Right. Yes of course.” Narcissa nodded, turning then towards her husband to place a kiss on his cheek. Eugh, Draco internally thought. “Alright then, I’ll go ahead with our little Dragon here, and you finish sending off the luggage to the Castle. We’ll see you on the train alright.”
Scowling and indignant, Draco wiped his face clean with his sleeve and moved to cross his arm across his chest with a petulant grumble. For a moment, he entertained the idea of just not telling her, of walking out right now and leaving her hanging, but inevitably thought better of it, knowing it would probably be more trouble than it was worth. And besides, he did kind of legitimately need her information.
“And this Mr. Malfoy, is precisely why I told you not to drink the tea!” She spoke aloud, locking eyes with Draco then for just the briefest of seconds to take in the blond’s state, before turning her attention back towards her fellow staff member.
It took a couple of days of classes for the news to get to her, and for her to truly verify the claims that were being made. But as she observed the blonde, gingerly and without any real effort, transfigure their assigned matches into a needle and back again, something even she had yet to achieve, and on the first couple tries no less, she knew then that the rumours were true.
Off to the side, he could see his parents upon a conjured set of chairs near one of the alcoves one the right side of the Hall. Still within clear sight of the front of the chamber where the sorting was to take place, but far enough out of the way, to keep too many prying eyes from focusing too much upon them.
There was only a single sconce that illuminated the area, and the shell of the light was twisted at an odd angle so that the light only shone directly onto the table itself and in the outward direction of the main section of the library. That in turn, resulted in the entirety of the area beneath the sconce to be left in relative darkness, which was also exactly where Draco liked to sit. It was quite frankly, the perfect spot to brood, preferably menacingly, but also served as a convenient location for studying in relative peace.
He thinks maybe he'd even heard his Mother and Father talking about it too at some point, how some families could go about and turn in on themselves when they find themselves struggling. His Mother in particular had been quite upset at the whole topic of discussion, and his Father uncharacteristically quiet and sensitive in comparison to his normally blunt and honest self. Sensing his reluctance to speak at the moment, Drake piped up after a moment.
To his side, Trelawney rolled her eyes at the sight of his still very apparent confusion. "Potter and his little gang will deal with Voldemort as is the plot destiny has provided us. And will continue to do so indefinitely unless we interfere."
“Well so long as you are feeling better now, Mr. Malfoy.” Dumbledore chimed in, a couple steps away so as to provide the family space. “I admit it was quite the shock you gave us all this morning.”
And as the teacher continued to look on towards Harry, it looked to be almost a near physical endeavour for the older man to turn his attentions away and call out once more. “Goyle! Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"
“Hmmm, very well. Though if that is the case, then simply pass me the letter and I shall make the delivery instead. Given the time, I imagine we don’t exactly have too much leeway before classes start, and the likelihood for the message within the note to sink in, or for the obstinate man to even read it will drastically dwindle. So give it to me, and I will handle it from there. Consider this a small charitable act of service to mark the start of our new working relationship.” The woman smiled, extending a hand towards Draco
And without preamble, McGonagall turned on her heels to head back towards the front, murmurs in dozens of tones all across the room, slowly rising amongst their gathered numbers. Soft and faint and yet all encompassing. And now that she was properly paying attention, she took in the knowledge that the words were once not actually about herself.
It took Draco less than a second to decide on what to do, and with a smirk gave both his fellow purebloods a wink and promptly walked on by. He did feel a little bad for leaving Vinny and Greg there to deal with Nott by themselves, but he would be back. Maybe, possibly. If he didn't end up finding Pansy or Blaise or Millicent or Daphne. Yeah, he really just didn't want to deal with Nott right now. Or ever.
"Skeeter? That slug is behind all this?" Yet another voice responded, and really at this point Draco wasn't even going to try recognizing anyone. It seemed like all of a sudden their letterwork was quite the hot topic, which left Draco feeling strangely internally smug for being in the full know of what was actually going on. Of course he didn't exactly know the full contents of every letter as more than half of them thus far have mostly come from Trelawney's own visions with the odd smattering of notes coming from Drake's future knowledge and personal memories.
Loire turned to Draco and looked him over for a long moment, "You would be the best choice, your defensive work has been top level so far, but I'm afraid you will have to sit this one out. It's not that I don't trust you, but this exercise might make it difficult for you to stay impartial."
"Shit." Harry jumped up. "Sorry love," he said, promptly blushing at the words. He hadn't meant to say that, it just came out. "I mean-" he closed his mouth, feeling a flush bloom across his cheeks.
When Draco caught his breath he looked into Harry's eyes, and said, "To be clear," the arms looped around Harry's neck tightened, "you are mine. You have been for a long time, we just took awhile to figure it out."
Pansy smiled again, "It was very interesting. I had no idea you and I had so much in common," she said with a wink. "Went into the perfect amount of detail too, about your time at the club last night."
Draco turned to face Harry. "Yes Potter, denying you is one of my favorite fantasies," he deadpanned.
The man looks between them, seeming to finally notice the tension in the room. He casts a wary eye on Draco before nodding. "I do."
Hermione does an admirable job of collecting herself, though her cheeks are still colored when she takes his arm to apparate.
The birthday party had been going for hours. It felt like the entire Wizarding World was packed into the Leaky Cauldron. Ron and Hermione had just left and Harry was watching Neville and Hannah expertly handle the bar. Those two had taken the Leaky to new levels since Hannah's father, Tom, had gifted the place to them for their wedding.
"I-" Malfoy's mouth opened and closed a couple times before he said, "I've not really thought about it."
Hermione had laid a comforting hand over his, "I think you're right Harry. If you want to speak for him I'll speak with you."
I mention 3 different ships in this chapter, as everyone gets ready for the costume party. Links to art at the bottom if you're interested!
"Any time Harry," Kingsley replied. "I don't suppose you would like to tell me why your mixed up with a family of pure bloods?"
Much to everyone's surprise, Draco laughed. He met Harry's eye, "See you around Potter," he said, and let himself out.
The first thing Astrid noticed about her room was the size of it. If this was a guest room she guessed that the house had some sort of magic done on it to look small from the outside. When she asked, Scorpius told her that it was a charm for the Muggles, but you could see the true size of it from the Wizarding entrance. Apparently Draco had refused to let Harry make it look like they lived "in a hovel."
Lucius cocked an eyebrow, “Do you truly believe we only keep files on people employed at the ministry?”
Draco smirked, "Don't be sour just because you're still hard. All you have to do is be good and I will reward you eventually."
Draco stepped through the door to find Potter on the ground, his body stretched taught, held up by only his toes, and his forearms against a blue mat on the floor. He wasn't wearing a shirt and the muscles along his back were tense, glistening with a sheen of sweat.
She blinked, the deep lines of her mouth dragging her lips down, making her look older. “Oh. I see. Miss Parkinson is not going to like this…”
Harry didn't know what to say. He told himself to leave, but his body didn't move. He couldn't help but think about Ginny. He hadn't been entirely sure how he felt about the Ginny Pansy situation, but he knew he didn't want to see Ginny get hurt. Having walked in on this private moment he was quickly deciding that Pansy shouldn't be anywhere near Ginny.
He tried to listen for a sign of her but his ears were full of the sound his heart was making as it beat thunderously in his chest.
"It's not, he just came by to talk and have some tea," Harry said. Even to him, the words sounded ludacris. He tried not to grimace when Ginny's eyes snapped back to him.
"I can kick your ass at Wizard's Chess if you want?" Draco offered. "We won't even have to talk. You can spend the whole time talking to Potter."
Only, the smirk is slightly too friendly. His eyes are soft grey, but lack the storm Harry usually finds there. His hair is blonde, a pale-blonde, but not quite as white as Draco's normally looks. His body, long and lean, is relaxed in a way Harry has never seen, with his right shoulder pressed against the door frame.
"Is it?" Draco asks. He knows it's not, he just wants to see Potter squirm a bit. They've had a better time than he ever would have thought possible, but at no point was this a date.
And really James would like to say for the record that he wasn't paying attention to it. That he was, of course, paying attention to the endless bubble situation. But that would be a lie.
“Gentleman,” McGonagall said, causing both of them to stop and look at her. “I hope you each gained something from this experience. Thank you for your patience while waiting for the antidote.”
"Potter," Pansy said, sitting on a chair she had transfigured from a stone, "How can you be late every day and not remember your food?"
"No, It's not the snakes she's worried about," Harry said, cutting him off. He smiled at Zabini before pulling on a Weird Sisters t-shirt. He pointed to the chocolate, "It's stuff like that. Romilda Vane is coming tonight. She was the first person to ever send me spiked chocolate."
He grinned, touched his bracelet a couple times, and said, "Father says he can't come up now but you can see some when we go back down. However, if you dump your clothes into that wardrobe there is a charm that will cause them to hang themselves up for you."
The group was five people, two young boys, one middle-aged woman, and two teenage girls. One of the girls burst into tears and whispered, “Oh my goodness, it’s really you.”
Blaise stared down at the two of them, letting the words sink in before asking, "Is it true your sister is no longer in marriage negotiations with Draco?"
Harry nearly felt himself wince at the question. “I was in the hallway looking for Orion. He came into the hallway and we saw each other,” he replied. “He was in dragonhide boots, Neville.”
Draco walked casually into the ice cream shop. He waited for Anna to give a quick nod, then locked the door behind himself.
"Come now, Potter," Draco said, "we both know easy is what you want. Easy is what you've been getting for months now. Go shag a Hufflepuff. Merlin knows they will willing blow you, especially if they think it's going to help with emotional stability. Honestly, I assume that's the reason we keep them at the school."
Harry wasn’t gay. He was bi. But really what did it matter? Straight, gay, bi, pans. Anger, attraction, love, obsession. None of it mattered. He’d looked at plenty of men and women over the years, regardless of gender no one ever made him
What the hell is he up to? Draco thinks. When he chances a glance at Hermione he can see the same question reflected in her eyes.
Blaise let his smile grow and nodded yes. "I do think the sweater would look good on you though." He glanced discreetly at Potter to see the boy peeking up at Draco over the magazine he was pretending to read. "Since you figured it out," Blaise said, leaning forward to undo the two buttons Draco had managed, "You should do it toppless."
The man reached out and put his hand against the door to stop it from closing. “Not so fast,” he all but growled the words. “Look,” he said, and waved to the car. “My daughter just got a letter from Hogwarts and we need to talk to Harry about it.”
"This might not mean much to you Potter, but we are talking about Hermione Granger. She's a war hero and -"
Hogwarts wouldn’t allow him to make these kinds of potions until his fourth year, and, at 12 years old, Scorpius had only just finished his first year. However, his father had always been willing to teach him about anything he showed an interest in, even if it was ahead of the school curriculum. Since Scorpius had an interest in potions and earning enough money for the newest Nimbus broom before 2nd year, this was a perfect arrangement.
After several steady beats of silence, Draco turns to Hermione. "I would love to join you. We can go together if you like. Pick you up at 6?" Draco asks, as though Hermione had had any part in inviting him.
“Sweet Salazar Harry,” Draco says. He’s only said Harry’s first name a handful times and from the way it makes Potter’s eyes sparkle he suspects that Potter could list them off. “You’re doing this on purpose because I’m going to see her.” It’s not a question, he’s not subtle.
Blaise bit back a smile at hearing Potter's thought. He couldn't help but agree, Draco truly had a pert little ass. All round and fit from years of Quidditch. Once Draco got the jumper down and slipped it on, Blaise gave him a peck on the cheek saying, "It suits you. Wear it for dinner if you like."
"No," Harry shuddered, "Hermione will drive me around the bend in a months time with her nagging about my study habits.”
Harry licked his lips clean and sat back on his heels, looking up with naked heat in his eyes. Draco favored him with a wry smile, and said, "If she asks which one of us prefers to bottom, what should I say?"
"Yeah. That makes sense," Harry said to hide his disappointment. "Let me know if you guys need anything for your research, ok?"
"I'm meeting a client tonight at the Double, which is a block down, and this is the best Indian food in a ten mile radius, Potter. You should be thankful that I introduced you to this place."
“Sorry Mother,” he said, slipping the shirt on. He folded the collar down around his neck and met her eye again. “I was working,” he said, laying a hand on Harry’s thigh, just above his knee.
Harry took a deep breath and focused, letting his magic ebb out gently, and vanished Draco's clothes without a word. Draco, standing at the foot of the bed completely naked, cocked an eyebrow at him, and Harry couldn't help but smile.
“No, she’s free to explore as long as you’re with her. She will help you on all projects going forward.”
Malfoy stands and Hermione does as well. When he offers his arm she takes it and they leave the restaurant together.
Sitting at a table hidden in the back corner, Draco sipped his cappuccino and tried to think of something to say. Spending this much time with Potter had him on edge and it had been less than an hour.
Anna looked up at that, her eyes narrowed suspiciously, "You're lying," she glanced at Harry, "Do you know what it's from?"
Draco smirked, when the lube smacked into his open palm, one hand gripping Harry’s thigh to hold him in place, flipped open the bottle. “I’m going to fuck you now.”
Along with the invitation Narcissa had sent an advertisement for a potions assistant in Diagon Alley. On its own this wouldn't have been enough to persuade him to return to England, it was the note on the back of the invitation that had secured his presence.
"Is it an issue for you to give me, of all people, something you brought for Malfoy?" He asked, breaking into a grin, "No," he finished, biting into the apple.
“I need you to be good for me and stay quiet,” Draco said, biting and sucking a love bite onto Harry's pulse point.
“I’m not stupid enough to get involved with some starry-eyed fan. As for Krum, the last thing I need is another quidditch obsessed jock who can’t hold an interesting conversation,” she says.
Hermione shrugs, vying for casual when she replies, “We have four months until September. That’s enough time for several dates, which means good press for you and your business. I’m guessing that I can do more for your image over one summer than you can do on your own in the course of a year.” Here she meets his eye, she knows this next statement will be risky. “Since we are being honest, allow me to be very clear. You owe me, and if you can’t remember why I’m willing to pull up my sleeve and remind you.”
Narcissa stopped walking as did Draco, who had been keeping perfectly in step with her. She turned to fully face Harry, and he stopped as well. Fighting to not cross his arms defensively, he leaned his back against the stone wall and kept his hands in his pockets.
Her eyes were suspicious as they passed over Harry. "Obviously I'm not going to deny the Chosen One," then she turned back to her work.
He considered weighing the pros and cons of having Blaise involved in this conversation and decided he just couldn’t be bothered. He was desperate. “The Wallbanger is Draco Malfoy.”
"Why wouldn't he give consent?" Draco asked. Suddenly, Blaise realized he wasn't the one being questioned here. Draco had confronted him in front of Hermione to goad her into this conversation.
“Next time we will go somewhere else, where I can hear you moan for me,” Neville said before he sank to his knees and tugged down Blaise’s trousers and boxers together.
“Yeah. Yes. Just Gin and I-” Seamus said, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Right, he especially seemed uncomfortable talking to Harry about Ginny. Not that Harry could blame him, Harry was also uncomfortable talking about Ginny.
"That's Teddy, he's Harry's godson, and he's some level of cousin to my Father," he replied. "You'll meet him tomorrow."
This was a hard chapter to write, but I think I got down what I wanted to. Please let me know what you think if you're so inclined :)
Hermione, Pansy, and Draco all raised their hands. The Professor pointed to both girls and directed them to the right side and the back side.
So when Narcissa and Andromeda were sick of waiting for Draco to move back home they used Teddy against him. The owl arrived on March 10th, one month before Teddy's birthday.
“Draco,” Blaise said his name carefully and laid a hand on the blond’s forearm, “I need you to trust us. I was there, and I’m telling you in no uncertain terms that if you play this right, you could have him wrapped around your pinky finger.”
When Harry pulled off his now softening cock, Draco dropped to his knees and pushed Harry until his back was on the floor. Draco kicked his pants off the rest of the way and crawled up Harry's body, straddling him, then leaned down to attack Harry with brutal needy kisses that sent a promise of more rushing through his body. Harry's cock was still trapped in his skinny jeans and his hips lifted of their own accord, pressing his prick against Draco's perfectly curved ass.
She gave him a quick smile. “All right, for tonight, please act as much like Draco Malfoy as possible. The people coming to this party paid for their tickets and they want a full Wizarding World experience. I assume you are familiar enough with the material to pull that off?”
Harry angrily shoved in between them and got right in Zach's face. "Fuck you Smith! You have no right to have any opinions about him or the war!"
Dropping the list to the ground Draco reached out to fist his hand against Potter’s t-shirt. Potter stilled, seeming to wait and see if Draco would pull him closer or push him away. When Draco did neither, Potter leaned in.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, “What the hell are you doing in this hallway, Potter? Are you tailing me?”
Harry watched them go, wondering if anyone had prepared Neville for seeing a Malfoy in his greenhouse today.
"Of course, you will need to continue to find a way to be consistently on time," Loire said with a smirk.
"Why does she get to call you Pansy?" he demanded. "I'm the one who spends all my free time with you in those dorms."
“Well Potter,” Draco drawled, “we were kind of hoping you wanted to play the part of a wizard today, instead of…” he paused and then said, “You did mention that we would have to go to Gringotts didn’t you?”
Malfoy’s whole body tensed. “Maybe I’m keeping someone else’s bed warm, Potter,” he said with a sneer. “Can’t you mind your own business?”
“Hello, students.” Headmistress McGonagall stood in front of two medieval suits of armor standing with spears crossed. “Welcome to your common room. This room was built specifically for the returning 8th-year students. The capybara was chosen to represent you because this animal is known to be friendly with a wide variety of other species. You will each do your best to set aside the past, get to know one another, and set an example of inter-house cooperation for the younger students.”
Harry chuckled, a deep rumbling sound that filled the space between them, "Well that may have been the perspective," he replied. Then, his eyes turning serious, he said, "Draco and I haven't argued about the war in a very long time. Why did you ask about that?"
"You think you’ve earned it?" Draco asked, biting into the pulse point of Harry’s neck. His hands slid down to Harry’s hip. One slipped lower, elegant fingers brushing lightly against Harry’s skin, touching everything except his cock.
"Of course, Mother," Draco said the words with the same drawl he affected while talking to a professor, but without a trace of contempt.
Ron, still blushing slightly, tried for the upper hand, "I didn't think you'd be interested in the details of my bed, mate."
"I was just trying to enjoy a few bubbles," James said, hoping to save Teddy from any trouble with his cousin. Besides, it really was his fault. "I'm not sure if they got so out of hand because of Albus or because of the hot tub?"
Harry stared at the hand and swallowed thickly. There's no reason to believe Draco doesn't have someone else's wand on him, but Harry's not willing to make that argument. Considering the last time Draco requested his wand from Harry, this was much nicer.
Draco stepped closer, "All this change must be hard for you," he said. Harry reached out to pull his shirt and Draco let him, until their bodies were pressed together. Draco leaned down and bit Harry's neck, "About that fuck Potter?"
Harry turned the corner of a stone corridor and came to an abrupt halt. Standing in the middle of the hallway, facing the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance, was Draco Malfoy. He was dressed in impeccably well fitting robes, a navy blue with golden brocade.
Dudley flinched at the question. “Sort of. We have counselors who work with kids who have been bullied. I work with the kids who have done the bullying.” He sighed heavily before continuing, “After you saved our family, Mom sent me to therapy. It took some time but I started to realize how awful I had been to you, and to some of the other kids at my school. I realized that I didn’t want to be that person anymore and started to make some major changes. Eventually, my therapist told me about Speak and Seek, and asked if I wanted to volunteer there to help bullies find better ways to communicate.” He looked at his cousin, waiting for a reply. When Harry simply picked up his tea cup and took a drink, Dudley continued, “I wanted to make sure that kids on both sides were getting what they needed to stop bullying all together."
Harry cocked his head, his eyebrows drawn down in confusion, "Why are you-" he tried to figure out how to finish that question, but decided to start over. "You don't seem angry, how is that possible?"
George hummed in response, running his fingers through the strands of a leather flogger hooked to the wall. "So what then?" He asked. "You want to know what Harry has bought in the past?"
Looking around the place he realized it was a bit of a mess. He went back to the boxes with focused intention. About 20 minutes later he heard voices in the hallway. The neighbors! Harry ran to the door and pressed his ear to it, he could hear a bit of the conversation.
Draco didn't freeze up in fear, or shove him angrily, he didn't even flinch. His only response was a smirk as he breathlessly said, "Grip harder you fucking Hufflepuff." Then he captured Harry's lips in a passionate kiss, and came all over Harry's hand.
he thought, as the clerk left to replace the tag. When Harry turned back he found that Draco wasn't standing next to him anymore. Harry glanced at the dressing room and saw the door was ajar. He bit his lip, embarrassed about what he was going to do, but knowing that he couldn't help himself from looking.
“Because we’re taking it back to mine,” Potter said in a tone uncomfortably similar to the one the clerk had used.
"Hullo," she said softly. He smiled when he looked up at her, and she found herself smiling back. He motioned toward a chair and she sat down at the kitchen table, it was small but the wood was solid the outer edge had Nordic runes carved into it. She ran her fingers along them, tracing the patterns.
She ran up and pulled at Draco's sleeve. "Come around back and see Neville's greenhouse. George is letting him keep it here until the school year is out," Luna said. "You can ask him about the cactus thing he has back there."
as an idea came to mind. Pansy and Hermione had said not to pay for sex, but they hadn't said anything about paying for other services. "Speaking of your clients, I wanted to talk to you about something. I have a business proposition for you."
Draco eyes dropped to Harry's lips and he licked his own. For a brief moment Harry thought he might get the night his prick had been hoping for. Instead, Draco pushed lightly at his chest, causing Harry to take a step back. "You're making me look unavailable. Let's talk later."
Draco drags Potter upstairs to his room as soon as Pansy leaves. He only has a small window before his next date with Hermione.
Harry tried to think of a response to that, and he's confident he would have had one, except Draco took that moment to step closer and Harry couldn't fully remember what they were talking about.
"Oh, right," Harry said, he hadn't been prepared for that. His forehead creased as he tried to understand. How could her time at the Manor have brought them closer? She was held in the dungeons. “How?” He asked, trying to pitch his voice so it didn’t sound like an accusation.
Anger rushed through Harry's body, the emotion crashing about, looking for a way out. He took a deep breath and didn't move or speak.
. This guy must have used magic for his voice too. His posh clipped draw is a perfect rendition of Malfoy's. Harry walks around his desk, crossing the short distance, and opens the door.
The blonde lifted his head and looked Harry now with a lifted eyebrow, "If I continue to call you Potter, are you going to stop?"
A box lit up on the screen indicating that Natalie was still waiting for Astrid to pick her next combatant. Astrid chose Ganryu because she liked to see his fat jiggle, and if she was going to be dominated in the ring she might as well get a laugh from it.
Draco ran his fingers across Harry's jaw, listening to the boy practically purr. Tilting his head he leaned in letting his lips brush against Potter’s. "How long?" he asked.
"Ron," Harry cut in, and Ron turned to look at him. "You're my best mate and I love you like family, so please do not finish that sentence." He reached out and put a hand on Ron's shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze, "I like him a lot. I'm not spelled or drugged, I promise."
"I really wish you would stop casually mentioning Pansy and the Weasleys. It makes it more difficult for me to pretend it's not happening."
"Hello, Blaise," Draco said, smoothing out his shirt as he turned around. "We were just trying to get Harry's hair tame enough for pictures. Did you need me?"
Harry cut him off, “Please Nev, I really need to talk to someone and I can’t go to Ron and Hermione with this.”
At home, that night, Harry waited to go to the club until after he heard from Hermione. He'd been nervously waiting for her floocall all day. When the ding sounded to announce the call, Harry jumped to the fireplace.
"Oh Merlin," she said, putting a hand on his chest, "Whatever you think you're doing here, you can forget it."
"Oh." James never knew what to say when the topic of Remus Lupin came up. He couldn't imagine life without his dad. Or his mom, for that matter. It made him want to give Teddy a hug.
"Oh, yeah. No problem," Harry replied, trying to 'take it well'. "You know, it was mostly Draco, if I'm honest."
Teddy gave him a sharp look, "We have talked about how people are not gifts, Scorp," he admonished. When Scorpius didn't offer an apology he continued, "Do you know what she's doing in there?"
Harry was wrapped up from neck to ankle in luminous rope, unable to move anything except his neck, which he turned to watch Loire hit the floor beside him, frozen in place.
Ginny's eyes glittered with mischief. "Luna said she ran into the lot of you. How did that happen, did Malfoy stay the night?" she asked. Harry could see she was holding back a laugh.
Harry started to panic, this was not good, this is not what he had meant when he said they should get along. He tried to think of something to say, but that was rather hard, seeing as Dudley was such a shit and Harry had stupidly confessed to both of them about his cousin.
"Seriously though, is everyone gay?" Ron asked. "I saw Neville and Blaise just now. Romilda and Hannah were holding hands in the hallway, and-"
On June 24th, a week before the trials, Harry and Pansy started on building the separate dorm rooms. They spent the morning drawing up plans and arguing over the importance of closet space but agreeing on giving each room its own bathroom. Luna had informed them it would be two to a room and which dimensions had been approved by the board.
Malfoy's brow furrowed and he looked again at the kitten, who was now walking towards Harry, then looked back at him and lifted a questioning eyebrow.
Once Astoria had pulled Hermione up to her room under the guise of planning their costumes, Seamus handed over a galleon to Padma Patil.
Dudley huffed a laugh, “There’s no end to the list of questions with this one. You wouldn’t be able to answer them all by the time school starts, much less over a cuppa.”
For the first time, Malfoy appears to be more than suspicious, and it takes a moment for Hermione to realize the reason. She huffs a laugh. “Don’t get a big head about it. I’m not paying you a compliment, just admitting that you might have a chance at holding a better conversation than two boys who mainly focus on where a ball can be located.”
Oh man, I feel like Harry in this story has a life of his own. I keep having to change the tags to fit his character. There's no tag that says 'obnoxious flirt with Draco but doesn't think anything is happening, just likes to make him flustered'
He looked over at her, she was currently reading through a Charms book for 2nd years, curled onto the same couch as him. She sat sideways, her back against the tall armrest, the right side of her body pressed against the back of the couch with her feet propped against Scorpius’ left thigh. Since she’d taken his hand at Madam Malkin’s with no rebuff, Astrid had tested the boundaries of touching him and seemed to have come to the conclusion that she could touch Scorpius whenever the desire struck. He hadn’t done anything to stop her, nor had he touched back, other than accepting her hand. And touch she did. Nothing inappropriate, of course, but it did feel intimate. She would casually grab his hand, lay her head on his shoulder, touch his arm when she laughed, lay her head on his thigh.
“Oh, you boys look good in my clothes!” the sales clerk’s saucy comment cut through Harry’s thoughts like a sharp blade and he closed his eyes, trying to slow his breathing. Draco didn’t move away, simply dropped his hands and greeted the man.
Both of them had howled with laughter of Harry's uncomfortable morning, and easily agreed to work on the Manor project, especially since the main goal seemed to be ticking off one Lucius Malfoy. As they sat there plotting, not only the remodel but ways to make it hell for Lucius, Harry's phone buzzed. He fished it out of his pocket and saw a message from Draco. Feeling his stomach flip, he quickly hit view.
The next morning, after breakfast, Harry instructed Kreacher to have all of the prep work done by 4 pm. Then he left to meet Draco in Diagon Alley. He found him casually leaned up against the brick with a book in his hand. Draco was dressed in a black button down, grey trousers and black leather shoes.
Potter looked up, blinking several times, and then started to laugh. “Thanks,” he said. “This will be the first time I’m with Draco that you won't have to hear my thoughts on it.”
The Monday after his birthday, Harry arrived early at Hogwarts to find Pansy waiting for him in the classroom they were renovating. She was sitting on one of the tables with her hands gripping the edge. She looked up when he opened the door and quietly followed his movements until he stood in front of her.
Draco walked in through the front door and started talking before it was even closed. "Weasley, you're going to want to make sure the wards on that greenhouse are reinforced. Longbottom has a muggle plant back there that eats flies, but Lovegood keeps casting charms on it so I'm concerned," he looked up and stopped talking. His eyes fell on a display over Harry's right shoulder.
Draco had leaned forward and whispered softly, “Come back to my dressing room, Harry.” He gently bit down on Harry’s earlobe, and let his tongue flick against it. When Harry’s body shuddered and melted against Draco, with a barely held back moan, he was thrilled at the solid chest he sank into.
Draco looked around, but didn’t immediately see anyone he recognized. He almost never ran into another witch or wizard in muggle London. He hoped it wasn’t someone holding a grudge against him. Even if they were usually valid.
Ron gave him a calculating look, one that, Harry suspected, was used during interrogations. "Has he kissed you?"
Draco sobers almost immediately and reaches over to wrap Pansy in a hug. "No. I'm not mad at all. I'm happy for you, both of you. This is just the weirdest day since I've come back."
Harry shook her off, and straightened back up. He looked them both over and said, "Are you two staying here?"
"Draco wanted to take a few years off," Harry said, "figure himself out, marry for love, get away from England. Lucius, his Father, wouldn't listen. He insisted Draco rebuild the family name. On Boxing day he presented three girls to Draco for him to choose to marry."
Hermione watches as Draco tries to collect himself with his stupid stormy eyes and his ridiculously perfect hair. "I said, start talking."
Without thinking, Blaise thrust gently, pleadingly, upward, brushing against Neville’s lips while his hands threaded through that messy dark hair. When he sank into Neville’s mouth the wet heat was like nothing he’d ever felt, and was only surpassed when Neville’s head started to move, his cheeks hollowing from the suction.
Harry's body buckled against Draco. He was so close that the next words were said against Draco's lips, "I'm actually not well known for being able to spot when something is a bad idea," he said and then held his breath.
"Was it-" she closed her mouth, unsure if she should broach the subject. Looking up to meet his eye and letting her curiosity get the better of her
“You’re right Draco,” Hermione closed the file and slid it back across the desk to Draco’s waiting hand. “The Unspeakable department is officially opening a case to determine the effects of fanfiction on one’s psyche. You will research the material, categorize the tags with comparison, and report back to me.”
Charlie offers him a drink but Harry declines, showing him the bottle he's already holding. Charlie eyes it skeptically and asks, "Is that water?"
The dressing rooms were in the back corner of the store, behind a line up of suit jackets, varying in color through all fifty shades of grey. Harry couldn't help but feel secluded as they walked past the curtain to see 4 dressing rooms, two small couches, and a corner of mirrors, placed strategically so the viewer could assess all angles of their future purchases.
Harry had paid extra money in donations to the ministry for them to agree to add that floo to the Muggle flat he lived in. He knew he was going to need it because, at the moment, his clients were only from the Wizarding world. He was making plans to expand into the Muggle market next year.
Harry followed her over to the giant desk at the front of the classroom and sat down in the chair across from her. "Thank you," he said.
- and a slate-grey jumper. Hoi Polloi was less than a kilometer from the apparition point. During the walk they passed Soft Serve Society, a quaint ice cream shop just off the main road.
Neville's only reply was to quicken his step. When they reached the classroom they saw 4 students sitting on the floor. They appeared to be gagged and bound to the teacher's desk. Draco was standing a few feet away with his wand pointed at them.
Draco slipped his hands into his denims pockets, drawing Harry's eye to the way they were slung low on his hips, and looked at the display table of ties. "I take it you're looking to get dressed up?"
"Yes, Professor," Harry replied, "There was a group of girls in the hallway that accosted me. No disrespect, but I'd think you would be able to tell that," he finished, motioning to the tear in his robe on the left sleeve.
They finished building out all of the rooms with attached bath except for one and decided to stop there for the day. Harry looked over the plans they had made then said to her, "Do you think they would let us pick our rooms early since we built the place?"
"He's doing the best he can, Parvati," Harry said wearily. They'd had this argument before, and Harry wasn't keen on being accused of taking his "side", not when they were all on the
that. The kinds of activities that Draco had alluded to dreaming about weren't exactly the types of things they were doing together.
He'd been worried that thoughts of what might be on those tantalising lists would consume his day, but he had a literal roomful of invoices to comb through for his and Sue Li's latest case which required close reading; it was the first time he'd ever been grateful for such a mind-numbing task. By the end of the day, Harry didn't even want so much as to
"What do you like for prep? Do you prefer me to really work you open, get you writhing on four of my fingers so I can just slide my dick right in? Or are you the kind of bloke who likes to
," Malfoy muttered angrily as he took in Harry's side which was, admittedly, looking disconcertingly like minced beef now that his shirt wasn't obscuring the gross dangly bits of skin and flesh.
Warmth filled Harry's chest. He wasn't quite as zen about the whole thing as he was acting—he was sure tonight would be extremely bloody awkward. But he also knew they would all be making an honest effort, and that was what mattered. It had been a little over a month since he and Draco got back from Italy, and this meal had been weeks in the making. He'd told Ron and Hermione about Draco not long after they'd returned but then Hermione had gone into labour the very next day. This was the first night either of them were feeling up for company.
Draco smiled. "Excellent. To start, I want to leave sex out of our scenes, at least any of the ones that involve age regression. You said on your form that you're not quite sure if it's a sexual kind of release for you, so I want to leave that aspect off the table for the moment until you've had time to play and figure it out."
close, that while he'd been busy focusing on bringing Draco off, Draco had managed to take him right up to the brink. "Gonna come. Gonna come all over you. Want you to do it with me."
Draco had begun to make his way steadily down Harry's stomach and he nuzzled against Harry's flushed cock, breathing hot and damp against the head until it twitched. There was another staticky discharge of magic, and then slick fingers were sliding over his perineum and towards his arsehole.
Emily frowned, looking over at Harry and Draco before focusing on the doll in her hands. "Can Sophie come?"
"Now let's see, what else can I pester you about instead?" Blaise mused. "You know, I couldn't help but notice when we were talking about our favourite trips earlier that you were suspiciously silent. Even Hermione mentioned going on holiday to Germany, boring as her idea of touring every museum in Berlin sounded."
been starting to get somewhere, to see if maybe they could make their relationship work, and then Harry had to go and ruin it all. Even if Draco was understanding of Harry's… inclinations, there was no way he'd be able to see Harry as a potential sexual and romantic partner after this. Not after Harry had just spent who-knew-how-long acting like a bloody
"Ron," Harry said in protest, his tone pleading; he really hated St Mungo's. They always made a Hippogriff out of a Snidget. But Ron wasn't having any of it, just gave him the
Harry knew he was blushing as he slid off the sofa and onto the floor, tucking his feet up under the coffee table as he reached for the children's colouring book. "I thought I'd take this one," he said, modulating his tone into something equally carefree.
of sex. It still shocked Harry, how insanely compatible they were in so many different ways, how they could go from scintillating conversation over a meal in a Muggle restaurant to insanely hot sex in Harry's shower to Draco cutting up a hot dog for Harry to eat off his child's plate while listening to one of the kids' radio shows on Draco's Wireless. It didn't seem like it should work, that it would be possible for one person to be all of those things for Harry, and yet…
robes on over his pyjamas. "I don't know the specifics, but Byrne Apparated in for a private debrief a little over an hour ago."
had barred Harry from joining over concerns of his 'temper' and 'ability to remain level-headed', which was bullshit. Not only were they trying to gain access to the wards to Foley's manor, but they needed to find out if she had anything planned in event of her capture given how many of her followers were still at large. Over the past few years Foley and her followers had become known for their violent attacks of public places and buildings; they were worse even than Voldemort, who'd stuck mostly to isolated targets. Foley's group had hit events and high-traffic areas across Ireland, and they'd also claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in other parts of the UK as well, showing how long their reach was.
, a kink, even, one that Draco was apparently willing to help him explore. But Harry wasn't exactly sure what his thing/kink/preference/
"Yes," Fathi said gravely. "I was able, with no small amount of difficulty, to determine that, as we suspected, she did give her followers orders to carry out an attack should she be captured. The idea is to provide a distraction so that a secondary cell can mount a rescue mission. It's a long story, but there are spells linking Foley to her followers that will allow them access to wherever she is, regardless of the other security measures in place."
Still, they all had had fun tonight, even with such heavy thoughts weighing on their minds. Things were getting worse in Ireland. Lady Foley had staged a coup of sorts, overthrowing the government and establishing her own dictatorial regime. She'd had several outspoken political rivals executed for treason, and had attempted to do the same for the Deputy Minister and the previous Head of the Auror Department; thus far they'd managed to evade capture and were continuing on in their resistance efforts, though now in a less official capacity. Parvati had announced tonight that she'd finally jumped through all of the hoops necessary to go over and help fight. She'd be leaving in less than a week, and Harry knew he hadn't managed to conceal his desire to join her, to do something more tangible.
“Don’t. Just- just don’t. I’m a slytherin. I’m not going to get emotionally invested in someone who’s getting married after school." Blaise pulled on his robes, casting a spell to keep them free of wrinkles. "Honestly, you should be careful too. This thing with Potter can be fun for you, I get that, but you need to watch yourself. Potter has a tendency to get attached fast, look at his codependent friendships.”
Potter walked out of the ice cream shop carrying two cones. "I hope you don't mind dessert before dinner." He handed one to Draco, "I got you the fanciest flavor they had."
After Harry and McGonagall replayed the events of Umbridge's visit the office took on another uncomfortable silence.
I needed to put this in so I can get into the party where there will be some big things happening! Chapter 7 will be longer!
Draco looked over at her, "Granger, did you know there is a charmed bookcase in my room? It gives me full access to the Malfoy family library. Would you like to see it?"
"Not that I've heard." Pansy scurries back to her computer to look up the meaning online. "This says the cape jasmine symbolizes beauty, luck, and sensuality."
Blaise thought. With Potter helping Draco to have some distraction in his day Draco might be less likely to schedule breakdowns.
"I know many people. None of them have taken her down as of yet. I don't know what's holding them back."
"This whole secret project the two of them have worked up has to do with me," Potter replied, "but I'm not sure what we're looking for."
“Hello Savior.” A coy smile touched her full mouth, then it was gone, leaving him to wonder if his pounding head and lack of sleep was causing him to see things.
"Oh," Neville said, he was looking at Zabini with an unreadable expression. "Why? Are you interested in-"
By noon Harry had at least the living room unpacked and looking good enough for his 1pm meeting. Luna, Seamus, Dean, and Neville, showed up, filing in one at a time through his floo.
Potter casts a locking charm at the door. “Always,” he replies with a grimace. "You'd think the press would have something more interesting to write about than where I spend my time."
"No problem, Potter," Blaise replied through a shaky breath. "Let's just both put up some Occlumancy walls and see if we can get through this."
Two days later, Blaise sat next to Potter in the infirmary. They were waiting for Slughorn to come in and administer the antidote to nullify the bond. Blaise couldn't wait for this part of his day to be over. Not just because he would
Harry stepped aside and leaned against the doorframe taking deep breaths as the blonde walked in, memories of the bathroom taking the place of Katie's torture. By the time he was collected enough to go inside, Draco was seated in the back room with three of the baby Merlin falcons.
Draco cuts him off. "Save it Potter." He reaches out and takes Harry's hand off the handle. Turning back to the blonde in the doorway. "You work for Blaise?"
“Any of them,” Natalie said, curiosity lacing the words. She was 13, and never seemed to have any qualms with age or gender when it came to physical attraction.
Hermione glances over her shoulder at Draco, then looks up at Potter and speaks in a low voice, saying, "You smell just like him."
Pansy's eyes glittered with anticipation, she gave him an unkind smirk, "There was an article about you this morning."
"I'm not telling you that," he said through his laughter. "Tell me what you're up to or I'll take you back to Harry."
The lust that bloomed in his chest, pumping through his body like blood. "Fuck," Blaise said to the empty room.
article or you don’t know why you showed up at my house?” Harry asked, fighting to keep exasperation from his voice.
"You can't sit with us, you need to go to see Longbottom." She stuffed his book and notebook into his bag.
Neville froze, looking at the floor. "What if he's not? What if he doesn't come? He's a flight risk Harry. Commitment terrifies him. And I get it. I know his mum-"
When Blaise came he had to bite down on the meat of his hand to keep himself quiet, while Neville sucked and licked until Blaise’s cock was too sensitive for any more pleasure. He reached down to grab Neville by the collar of his shirt and kiss him senseless.
He leans forward, letting his blonde fringe brush against her forehead, to whisper, “I’m thinking about kissing you.”
He walked to the back of the vault and picked up the Hawthorne wand off a shelf. The wand felt familiar in his hand, yet completely foreign at the same time. He turned around to find Draco watching him intently from the doorway.
, Harry." Teddy was still next to James in the hot tub, sitting close enough to press the length of his thigh against James'.
Teddy on the other hand, had endeared himself to Draco to such a high level that he received far more than letters. Teddy's drawings and pictures were framed and hung the day Draco received them. His letters were kept in a small chest that was warded to protect the contents against fire, and water. Draco sent Teddy two letters a week, several photos of France, toys, books, and a slew of muggle items that fascinated him. Namely, stickers.
“I should have known I wouldn’t have to coax you into doing this.” Teddy was turned away from him, topless. Muscles shifted along his back, lit by moonlight, as he toed off his shoes and James closed his eyes to block out the scene.
Elphias Doge stood from his chair and shouted, “That question is completely leading the witness, not to mention offensive in its wording. Tom Riddle wasn’t the lord of anything in his time, he was just a desperate fool!”
"Stop being so paranoid," Harry said, glancing quickly around the restaurant. "You are not allowed to choose where we eat next."
Pansy's eyes were bright with tears she was holding back. She pressed her forehead into Zabini's chest and cursed under her breath.
Malfoy glances briefly at the closet again before he answers. “I honestly can’t think of a reason not to.” Resigned, he stands up and offers a hand. “Owl me the details of our first date Granger.”
Draco blinked, looked down at his robes, and back at Harry. A sly grin played on his lips when he replied. "Malfoy's don't collect soot, Potter."
Her eyes snapped to his as though a spell had been broken. "Sorry," she said, then turned to Ron. "You can not go," she said firmly.
"Well, I suspect we'll be seeing more of him then. I know Luna and Neville think he's worth being around," George said, as he brushed off more dust from his robes. "And Ginny filled me in on you, so there's that," he finished with a casual shrug.
Harry searched Ron's face, trying to determine if he was taking the piss, if he was actually suspicious of Draco, or if he was really in denial. Whatever it was he didn't have time right now, he'd have to deal with that later.
Three hours and a shared order of fish and chips later the waiter approaches with the bill. He's tall and slim with a sly smile and hungry eyes, and he's been flirting with Draco since they arrived. If this were any other night, or if he was in anyone else's company, Draco would certainly take him home. Maybe share him with Pansy. But it's not any other night, and he's with Potter. Potter, who bristles every time the waiter approaches, who speaks to him with a tight smile and glaring green eyes.
He leaned in to speak against Draco's skin. "I don't want easy," Harry's voice was so low he hardly recognized it. "I don't just want a fuck. I don't care what anyone else says. I'm not doing this to avoid the nightmares."
Draco looked down at Harry's hand and then, slowly met his eye. "Is that really where you want to touch me during this interrogation of yours? I'm still scarred there you know," his words were cold and barely audible.
He pulled his hood tighter, trying to hide that wild hair, and kept his head angled down so he didn't make eye contact with anyone. He nearly reached the door to the last cabin when Pansy Parkinson stepped out of it, blocking the way.
Harry had spent a lot of time thinking over the moment that wand became his. Harry knew he hadn't given it willingly but part of him suspected that Draco didn't regret it after everything. So, he took a chance and said, "Thanks for letting me borrow it."
Which had been the extent of it until Draco came to his first meeting in one of those suits and Harry’s definitely-not-a-crush had taken him by surprise.
When Harry came back to the common room he stopped to say thank you to Neville who was chatting with Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott and Terry Boot. Neville stepped away from the group to pull Harry aside and told him that students he had escorted with Filch were mostly quiet on the way back. Only muttering to themselves about their detentions.
"Don’t worry,” Draco replied, and Harry could hear the fond affection in his voice, “he knows what he’s doing. Just try to follow his lead and this will get worked out.”
Draco closed his eyes, marking this as the moment he abandoned sanity in favor of the terrifying embrace of mutually assured destruction. "Can you still speak Parseltongue?"
Harry gave a weak smile in return, "Yeah, but I don't think we're even allowed to miss the sorting ceremony. Three hours of my life I'll never get back."
Draco handed over the Unspeakable's credit card that he had received after his first 90 days with the department. He'd only used the card twice since then. After ringing him up, the clerk handed him a white paper bag. Draco stared at it, confused.
As Pansy passed Draco her dark eyes narrowed. A flash of surprise crossed his features briefly, which was quickly replaced by a smug smirk.
"I believe that it's good food," Harry replied, trying to keep his tone casual and block out thoughts of who Malfoy would be meeting at the Double, which he knew to be a fairly popular night club, "but it's not really the atmosphere I usually choose for a-" he cut off the word
"So you've spent the last two weeks listening to me fuck other people," Malfoy said, letting his voice drop into a seductive drawl, "and now you want to hire me."
Draco turned his glare back to Hermione. "We have to do something about this. The muggles are running wild with this idea. I mean the tags alone- Hermione, there are
Harry felt heat spread through his chest and up his face as he watched Draco’s movements. He cleared his throat and looked down at his fans, attackers, whatever. “Yeah, I guess we’re even,” he supplied weakly.
She showed her teeth, and said, "I'm not looking for advice on how to get her wet. Certainly not from you."
The lustful look Pansy gave Hermione made Harry's cheeks heat, and he wondered if he was that obvious when he looked at Malfoy. She turned back to him and said, "All right, Chosen One, stop by my studio after this and my assistant will have three outfits ready. How are you planning to do approach him and where have you thought of taking him for dinner?"
Macmillan hummed in response, putting a hand on the wall just over Draco’s shoulder. Draco looked up from the letter to say, “Macmillan, what the fuck are you doing? Did your parents not teach you personal space?”
Draco's eyebrow quirked, the light grey of his eyes dropping in a slow perusal that Harry tried not to fidget under. "Is that so?"
He would go to Muggle club to avoid running into any fans. Harry shuddered at the thought of them, with their fake lightening scars and cheesy glasses, and felt any desire to get laid die at the idea of sleeping with one of them.
Macmillan huffed a laugh, “Wow,” he said, staring at Draco. Draco glared at him. “Sorry,” Macmillan raised his hands in a sign of surrender, “just, I’ve read that tag so many times but hearing it in your posh accent really brings it to life.”
"Stop," Harry put a hand on both of Neville's shoulders, meeting his eye. "First off, Blaise is here, I've already been lectured by him. Second, Blaise is madly fucking in love with you. Third, commitment is scary and Blaise hasn't seen a lot of good examples of it but so what? He asked you to marry him because he believes in the two of you together."
"Ron," Hermione's voice came from behind him, "don't be rude." She squeezed past him and stepped into the room, looking between Harry and Draco. Clearing her throat, she said, "We are going to miss breakfast. Let's go."
"Don't stop, fuck-" Draco cried out, just before his body jerked and spilled cum down Harry's throat.
Huffing, Hermione folded her arms. "This is ridiculous. Where did you even learn about muggle comic books?"
Pansy reached into her bag, pulling out a handful of, what appeared to be, colorful magazines. She attempted to hand them over to Hermione, who made no move to take them. Instead, Astoria took the stack and started to rifle through them.
Harry huffed a laugh. He'd missed how easy it was with Ginny. She was always a step ahead of him. "Merlin, Gin. I don't know." Harry tossed himself back in the bed and let the story spill out.
"We fought on different sides, yes, and it was terrible. The war was terrible and people close to me died. Draco and I found each other well after the war and we made peace a long time ago," he said. Then, after a moment, he added, "Even during the war he saved my life, though don't tell him I said that. He won't back me up, he'll just claim selfish motives."
"You wanted to talk about it," Draco said as he shifted a bit so his right arm slung across the back of his chair and crossed his long legs in front of him. He looked up to the right, "I remember hearing you kissed Chang in 5th year. Before that, it was reported that you had a thing with Granger."
Draco turned the corner and stopped short before he collided with Potter, who had been walking down the corridor that would take him to the Great Hall. They both stopped and looked at each other wearily, close enough to shove, but not for anything more intimate.
When they reached the kitchen Draco handed the invitation to Astrid and she stared at the front in confusion. She looked at Draco and asked, “Why does it say ‘Potter’?”
"Some tea," she said warily. "Harry, I know you're, you know, rebelling or whatever and I'm supportive of that, but this," she looked back at Draco, "this is not…" She trailed off.
Pansy moved towards him, gripping his chin. "Don't do anything stupid like catch feelings for me," she said, and Potter chuckled, his eyes flitting quickly to Draco and back.
Hermione had prepared for this. It’s not the reaction she was hoping for, as it will be more difficult to convince a man in full control of himself than it would be to convince a man distracted by her body. However, while deciding the best way to approach Malfoy, she had considered the fact that he had spent several years watching Pansy Parkinson work a room. The dress Hermione was currently wearing was chosen by Pansy during their first excursion to shopping in muggle London after Pansy had been hired as Hermione’s assistant at the Ministry. Their tentative friendship had blossomed over the last year and Pansy had proved to be a valuable asset, not only at work but as a confidant.
Wanting to further engage him, she asked, "Isn’t this the manor you grew up in?” motioning to the building ahead.
"If you're going to use me to get back at him," Draco said, "the respectable thing would be to give me some warning."
"The returning 8th-year students will sleep two to a room in the renovated west tower. Due to the recently released information about your preferences," McGonagall spoke slow and steady.
Harry was radiating affection when he responded to Scorpius, "Oh yeah, they assigned this complete tosser. Brand new to the force, no idea what he was doing," he said, chuckling. "I already told her that I was the Auror investigating. She asked how your Father and I reconnected."
Draco had expected this caution from Potter, so he pitches his voice low and careful, as though he’s talking to a wild bunny. “I already know that you find her attractive, and I think you would be open to messing around with her.”
He was frustrated that Parvati was treating him like he was a child she had to monitor, and tried to remind himself that he appreciated that she cared. "I hope he will be," Harry said softly. "Not like I can tell him about it." Parvati nodded, looking encouraging and sympathetic, though her smile grew tight and brittle as he continued, "I mean, I know the likelihood is low, especially now that we've got Foley, but we can't risk putting any sensitive information like that in our letters home. I'll have to wait until I get home to tell him."
Harry hadn't ever made that connection before. He'd never considered that Draco might have struggled with his own desires the way that Harry had been struggling with his. He always seemed so confident and sure.
Draco, for his part, appeared to be doing his best to ignore him, tearing into his food with a little too much gusto. He yelped as his fingers prodded at the still-molten batter, throwing the fish back into the basket and shaking his hand, a sheen of hot oil coating his fingertips. Harry only allowed himself a brief moment to think of Draco's slick fingers in a far more pleasant context before focusing back at the issue at hand.
Graham ran a hand through his hair, rumpling his perfect salt-and-pepper coiff. "We expected the Aurors would send somebody earlier, when we were still at St Mungo's." His tone wasn't exactly accusatory, but Harry felt chastened all the same. As understaffed as they were at the moment, they weren't able to respond as quickly as they should have in this situation.
"Aren't you supposed to give injured people what they want?" Harry said. "Pretty sure you're supposed to spoil me rotten—helps with healing." Draco snorted, but Harry pressed on, "So if you really want to help me get better, you should be nice to me."
"Ah, right." Harry struggled for a moment with his shirt, grateful he didn't have his bulky Auror robes to shrug out of since they'd been undercover when things had unexpectedly imploded. Then again, if he'd been wearing his Auror robes, with their woven-in protection charms, he probably wouldn't have been injured in the first place. Then again
Draco, let alone engage in something so much more intimate. Of course, he wanted to fuck Draco, but that was completely different. Harry had his fair share of meaningless sexual encounters, enough to know that sex without connection and intimacy was entirely possible, if not exactly what he personally wanted. Dating and becoming true partners was something else entirely, something
Ron snorted. "Mate, your Healing spells are shit. Go get yourself taken care of at St Mungo's, I'll get things wrapped-up here."
"Eventful night, eh?" Parvati asked after they'd finished securing the prisoners in the dungeons. She'd made some tea and passed Harry a mug, which he took gratefully.
They hadn't snogged since the end of their first date, when they shared that goodnight kiss that had made Harry's toes curl inside his boots. Harry had had plenty of time in the intervening week to dream about the next one, and somehow this kiss was even better, slow and thorough, gradually building heat until Harry thought he would combust on the spot. He tangled a hand in Draco's hair, angling him closer while his other hand slid down Draco's back to grab hold of his perfect arse. He tugged until Draco's body was flush against his, shuddering as he felt the hard evidence of Draco's arousal nudged up against his own hardening dick. They'd said they were going to take things slow, and Harry was pretty sure this didn't qualify, but right that moment Harry didn't care. He wanted this, wanted
"Stay the night," Draco said after he'd pulled out and cleaned them both off. They were curled up together naked on Draco's massive and ridiculously comfortable bed. The last thing on Harry's mind was leaving.
Graham gave Draco a startled look, peering at him intently before his expression cleared with apparent recognition, his eyes softening. "Ah, yes, I didn't recognise you in this uniform. She's playing, yes. She was quite shaken up after last night."
Malfoy had been brought on as a Curse-Breaker consultant three months ago, when Ron and Harry had first been assigned the case. In a surprising show of foresight, the DMLE decided having a Curse-Breaker on hand would probably be helpful when taking down the country's largest underground Dark and cursed object auction house. Malfoy, with his particular history and skillset, was a logical choice, and Harry'd had no choice but to accept Malfoy back into his life once more. Sure, Harry had been aware of Malfoy: he'd unable to avoid hearing talk of his brilliant work from Bill during dinners at the Burrow; he'd seen flashes of his white-blond hair at every charity gala Harry had gone to; and he had listened to Hermione's grudging praise of the lobbying he'd been doing for anti-blood-purity legislation. It had all painted a very different picture of Malfoy from the one Harry'd had in his head, and he'd had to work hard to fight off the instinctive curiosity to find out more. Malfoy was a part of his past, no matter how interesting (and fit) he seemed to be these days.
"Did you know," Draco finally said after a long pause, "that you're still wearing your little outfit?"
But Draco wanted to know Harry's deepest held fantasies so he could work on making them a reality for Harry. He wanted to give Harry a gift, give him a chance to explore the desires he'd buried so deep he'd barely even known they were there. Harry
So for now they were taking it slow and seeing where things went, feeling one another out to determine if the heat between them had any real potential or if it was just flashpaper, burning hot but brief. Harry knew it was smart not to rush into anything. He knew it was the reasonable,
Several years ago that retort would have got Harry's back up, but he knew Draco well enough by now to be aware that he got extra supercilious and snarky when he was freaking out. It was something Draco had been working on and, sure enough, he shot Harry a regretful look a moment later.
thing) for competence—not to mention lithe physiques and fluency in snark and sarcasm—and getting to see first-hand how good Malfoy was at his job made Harry's heart race.
" and a jet of red-orange light, and Harry's heart skittered to a stop. For the briefest moment, there'd been a sense of relief—the hex had
sounded delightful. Draco wasn't working at St Mungo's today but Harry knew he was volunteering his services at the relief centre for another hour or two. There was plenty of time for Harry to go home and shower, and then maybe greet Draco with some takeaway.
"Fuck, you feel so good," Harry groaned as he urged Draco back towards their bed, tearing off the rest of his clothes while Draco did the same.
Harry sighed and attempted to tune back in to the conversation around him, only to realise everybody was leaving. The majority of the resistance members had their own homes and lives to manage, keeping their participation in the resistance under wraps—it was only Fathi, Harry, Parvati, and the increasing number of people who Foley had attempted to arrest or kill who stayed under Fathi's manor protections full-time. Luckily the house was massive—and Unplottable—so there was plenty of space for those that were there, and room for more as Lady Foley drove others underground. But they couldn't hide behind Fathi's wards forever, and Harry was itching for a proper fight. Unlike Voldemort, there were no Horcruxes that prevented her from dying for good, and no mystic prophecy foretelling her downfall could only come at the hands of a teenager. All they needed was to work out her movements in advance so they could attack when she was least expecting it.
Harry grinned as they began to dance, the rest of the fray falling away as his vision tunnelled in on his target. Her red hair whipped around her in an invisible wind, and her skin was unnaturally pale in the moonlight. For all that she had a similar colouring to the Weasleys, she didn't remind Harry of them at all, her face and body too angular and severe, her hard eyes and cruel mouth nothing like the warmth of the Weasley features. She was a plain woman if not for the lustre of her fiery hair and the aura of power that she exuded which was impossible to ignore. Her entire platform had been built on the importance of magical strength, valuing power above all else, including precision, though she happened to have both. She was an incredibly skilled duellist, perhaps even more so than Harry, and the thought gave him a strange kind of thrill. Taking her out wouldn't be satisfying if he didn't have to work for it.
Before he could talk himself out of it Harry folded up the lists and stuffed them into an envelope, scrawling Draco's name on the outside. He cast just about every privacy charm he could think of on the bundle, ensuring that Draco would be the only person who could see what was inside. He whistled for Apocrypha, the brown owl of unknown origin that had shown up at Grimmauld Place a few years ago out of the blue, apparently deciding to adopt Harry as her own. He attached the envelope to her leg and told her to go straight to Draco Malfoy, and was promptly overcome with doubt the second she disappeared out of sight.
"You were lovely," Draco said softly, his tone almost awed. "I've never seen you look so carefree, so… unburdened." He hesitated, his hand momentarily stuttering in its path along Harry's back before resuming. "I could tell, when you looked at me, that you were seeing me through your pre-Hogwarts mind, without all the baggage and history between us. I hadn't realised how powerful that would be, for you to see me not as Draco Malfoy, but as your"—Draco hesitated again—"caretaker."
by cleaning Grimmauld Place from top to bottom until he was a sweaty, exhausted mess, well, his house
"Are you feeling all right?" Malfoy asked, his expression creased with concern. "Your heart rate is elevated. Is it the pain?"
Harry grinned against Draco's lips, feeling warmly content, a spark of hope and excitement for tomorrow flickering inside him.
Draco let out a sound like a purr and Harry's pants disappeared with a burst of magic, leaving him entirely nude. There was another prickle of magic and Draco's clothes had vanished as well, and Harry shivered with pleasure at the feeling of Draco's bare skin against his own.
Harry blushed. He knew caretaker hadn't been the word Draco had been thinking. It filled him with a hot combo of want and shame, because he'd be lying if he said there hadn't been a few moments while he was under, where he'd wanted to call Draco by a different name. But that seemed like too much, too deviant, somehow. Draco had been nothing but wonderful and kind and game for anything throughout all of this, but he'd also admitted this hadn't ever been his usual kink. Harry didn't want to scare him off. Hell, Harry didn't want to scare
Harry couldn't help but remember the sudden, terrifying move in the week before his seventeenth birthday, when he left the protection of his Aunt and Uncle's house early hoping to catch Voldemort off guard. It hadn't worked, of course, and all these years later it still hurt whenever he saw a snowy owl soaring through the sky, which was thankfully not often. His unique history meant he immediately understood Fathi's plan.
It would be easier for Harry to carry the boy, but he understood why Cara felt she needed to do it. He stared at them for a moment, his heart beating strangely. With his towheaded locks, ones that would inevitably deepen with age as Cara's no doubt had, it wasn't difficult for Harry to see a young Draco in the sweet boy's face. Draco as he might have been at three years old, or perhaps Draco's child, the one he'd sometimes speak about in an abstract way, the one he so obviously wanted someday but didn't quite feel deserving of. He and Draco had talked often of their future together and what they wanted. They'd discussed someday getting married and maybe, when they were ready, having children through adoption or surrogacy. The possibility alone had always filled Draco with a wild-eyed sort of panic, mixed with a naked longing that had always made Harry's heart ache. Draco struggled with the idea of being a father, terrified he'd do as bad a job of it as Lucius, but Harry hadn't had that same fear. Harry knew Draco would make a brilliant dad, and the thought of raising a family with Draco had always filled him with a quiet, steady warmth. It had felt
sounded easier said than done. Harry hadn't ever been that great about talking about his feelings or stuff that was super personal. Apparently he needed to learn, quickly.
"It looks like we're done here for the day, Harry. You should go to your room and get some rest." She paused before continuing more carefully. "It doesn't seem like you've been sleeping well. You know you can always take some Dreamless—"
Harry growled, helpless frustration churning in his gut. "You know how I feel about it, Draco. You know I want to be over there fighting, making a difference!"
"It is," Fathi said with a grimace. His expression grew hesitant, concerned, which was a disconcerting look on Fathi's normally severe and uncompromising face. "Listen, Harry, why don't I work with Parvati on containment for the attack. You can take charge of coordinating the efforts here to guard Foley and ensure she doesn't escape."
Was Harry interested in punishment and discipline? How did he feel about spanking? Did he want a dummy or a bottle? Did he want to wear a
"See something you like?" Draco asked, preening a little in a way that was surprisingly endearing. Before Harry could answer, Draco gave him a hot once-over. "You seem a little overdressed."
"Oh, I don't mind, I can come here. Even overworked Healers get breaks—I asked your supervisor—accommodating bloke Healer Chen. I can bring you dinner, do you like Indian? I know this place that makes an
Though Harry hoped more was on the table tonight than just these—admittedly magnificent—kisses, because his cock was so hard it was almost painful, and he felt like he might actually combust if he didn't get off soon, preferably with Draco. He moaned, grabbing on to Draco's hips and arching against him in a way he hoped was sexy and suggestive. Apparently he missed the mark, because Draco seemed to take that as his cue to break off the kiss and slide off the bed. He looked fit as hell with his mussed hair and kiss-swollen lips, though less hot was the look of concern in his eyes as he looked Harry over.
Heaving a legitimately audible sigh at the other boy’s own gasp of surprise, Harry slumped back into his seat, already feeling exhausted, but grateful that the whole thing had finally come to an end. Locking gazes with the blonde in front of him once more, Harry whispered with utmost sincerity. “Thanks for the help.”
Draco also realized at this moment, that he also had had no idea what Harry Potter even looked like, save for the scar and that in some bizarre form of precognition, he immediately known that this tiny timid little thing was the Savior of the Wizarding World. But how? How did he know that? Why did he know that?
Also, I imagine I need not explain this, but do try and stay away from Quirinus and his fiendish baldspot. I doubt they suspect much, given their arrogance, but your distinctly negative reaction to them just now likely did not help us in any capacity."
Watching as the older woman made her exit through the other doors of the ward, Severus moved to join Draco and his parents at his bedside. “Well that’s certainly one way to start one’s first year at Hogwarts.” The darker haired man said idly.
Looking on towards the figure across from him Draco took in the sight of a woman, thin with long curly brown hair and large round glasses that magnified her eyes to several times their natural size. Draped in a gauzy, spangled shawl and knitted fabrics, innumerable chains and beads were hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings of various shapes and sizes.
And yet. There was this powerful gut feeling Draco had, that the other was in fact being entirely genuine as flippant and eccentric as they had been. And that whatever it was that they told Draco, was in fact the truth. That, and the sudden overwhelming sense of impending fear and doom that quickly followed up that brief acknowledgement also happened to aid quite a bit. Not so much a fear from another source like Drake, but one deep within even himself, shared between them both. The image of cruel dancing golden eyes, flickered across his vision.
The adults in her life called her gifted. But she knew now that that was just a softer word for 'other'. But maybe, she thought, setting down her quill, eyes darting to her side, just maybe, not so other anymore.
“Very well done Mr. Malfoy.” She heard McGonagall speak, dry and yet with a clear intonation of approval. “A point to Slytherin for exceeding expectations. It seems you are quite the natural at this. Perhaps the rest of your compatriots can learn a thing or two from your efforts.”
But Draco figured he had time and even a living cheat sheet so to speak so he wasn't too overly worried. His friendship with Harry was progressing fairly well and he had even managed to keep any incidents with Nott to a fairly healthy minimum as of late, which was always nice to reflect about.
One day, you might envision muggles stepping onto a space rock for the first time in history. On another, you watch a man get mauled to death by a Wyrm or a child perish of smallpox."
There was a pause for a moment, and Draco momentarily had the chance to wonder whether or not this was actually a good idea or not, given all the responsibilities he had in just a few short months suddenly found himself bearing. But then Potter had looked up, small shy smile on his lips and green eyes sparkling, and he said. "Uh, Harry. Just Harry."
“Of course.” The matron nodded, just as Dumbledore spoke up again, a smile on his features and small laugh on his lips.
“Ah, my sincerest thanks.” Dumbledore replied, giving the room one final smile before slipping out the door, only to pop back in a moment later. “Oh and speaking of thanks, do try and give one to Mr. Potter, Draco my boy. He was the one that happened to find you and alert the prefects of what happened.”
It was almost like being a freak again back with the Dursleys except turned on its head. Sure, it had been kind of nice, at the start, with everyone, even strangers being so kind and nice to him, but after a while it was just overwhelming. Thankfully, here at the castle though, things had seemingly begun to simmer down, what with classes beginning, and Harry couldn’t be happier.
Well, actually, he could definitely be happier given the fact that he was sharing his very first class of the day, for his entire first year, with Nott. Which was another thing Harry had come to realize as he slowly attempted to adjust to the Wizarding World. No matter where he went, bullies were everywhere, and given the way Nott had talked down to Ron and thereafter himself, it was clear to Harry that the shorter boy was just like Dudley. So having to share a class with the berk, really wasn’t ideal.
"Mr. Longbottom. Mr. Longbottom!" The professor cried as the other pureblood boy zoomed across the open terrain, looping through archways and buttresses almost as if he was meant to fly, if one were able to ignore the near constant screaming and holding on for dear life.
Case in point: Longbottom shooting off without warning like a Cornish Pixie the moment Madame Hooch signaled their start.
Things had mostly been fairly uneventfully over the past little while. It had been a solid two weeks since his conversation with Weasley, and though he could almost physically feel the undying loathing and contempt the other boy was leveling at him with his eyes and face and general being, they hadn't yet had another confrontation like before which Draco was grateful for.
“It is what you get Mr. Malfoy, when you mix too much nerves, excitement and no sleep the night before.” Madam Pomfrey added, a single brow raised and a quirk to her lips, as she walked back to rejoin the group after having left to put away the empty potion container. Draco felt himself go a little pink, he had gone to bed fairly late last night.
All feedback is more than appreciated. Anything done well, anything that could be improved upon, please lay it on me haha. It feeds my motivation to work and better my story and storytelling.
And to be perfectly honest. If someone had asked Draco the same thing a month and a half ago, he would probably have said yes in a heartbeat. Because it wouldn't have been any of his business to intervene and could potentially have been hilarious.
But now, since he was all of as sudden trying to be a good person, eww, he knew that he let Longbottom fall and the silly git died, the guilt of it all would eat him alive. So really, Draco was doing this more for himself really.
And with a start, Draco threw himself from his bed, a scream caught in the back of his throat, the image of crazed golden eyes still fresh within his mind. With a resounding crash, he tumbled off the edge of his mattress, hands reaching out frantically for purchase only to grasp at the covers which then fell alongside him. The pain of the impact sending a wave of shock and clarity through his mind, as he slowly and with great effort, sat himself up.
He loved the attention, he would very honestly admit. Seeing the professors' shocked faces as he easily managed to complete most of the first year practice charms and enchantments in record time, and the looks of sheer envy and admiration slowly but surely coming to be directed his way from his fellow student. The Gryffindors especially. Weasley's reactions were always quite distinctly amusing. It was as if every success that Draco had was a personal challenge and insult to the redhead, who would always either sweep out of the class complaining of the unfairness of the world into the Potter's ears, or be excused to the bathroom, hall or Hospital wing, after furiously attempt to match Draco himself, to often spectacularly outrageous results. But, Weasley right now was beside the point.
"The Dragon outed him to the Aurors. Didn't even give the man a chance to get out of bed before they raided the manor."
And Draco hated to admit it, but that was the most dastardly Slytherin thing he had ever heard. Damn, he was actually starting to respect the hag.
Turning back then towards her own match, Hermione closed her eyes and moved to focus. Her thoughts twofold. First, on the completion of the magecraft before her, because if Malfoy could do it, then so would she. And Second, plans for her inevitable encounter with the other prodigy, inevitable because Hermione would make it happen one way or another. She had finally found someone who had the potential to understand her and she was not going to just stand idly by and let him be swept up into the claws of someone else. She was taking no chances. He would be her friend.
Lucius gave a soft sigh of relief. “If you would please Madam Pomfrey. It would certainly help in alleviating some of our concerns regarding today.”
“I should also probably start getting myself ready for the feast as well. All Hogwarts staff must be present at the first great feast after all, and I will provide you both your papers when I return Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy,” She said, walking off back towards the other end of the Hospital wing. “Till then.”
Deciding he was comfortable with its temperature, Draco withdrew his hand from the water before shaking his head in response. “No, thank you. It’s fine. I can handle this on my own. You can however help me with rechecking my luggage, in case I’ve forgotten anything from the night before. Please and thank you.” He finished with a nod.
Tall and pale and with an ever so slight shake in his smile, brows furrowed in apparent concern, clad in a plain brown suit and simple purple turban.
Raising an expectant brow towards him, she stared him straight down the length of her nose, a single brow rising upwards, her eyes brimming with challenge. He almost felt bad for what he was about to respond with, sliding his own parchment forward for her to see. For a mud-
The poor lad in the vision must be having a real awful time right now. Draco couldn't even begin to imagine just how rough things must be for them, given the small glimpse the blond had the displeasure of experiencing. He had heard about things like that before, along the grapevine and amidst the gossip of his fellow pureblood children, but he hadn't really ever paid the idea of it any mind as he was mostly focused on his own goings on and fairly comfortable family situation.
A voice in front of him rapidly hissed, quiet as can be, and Harry’s eyes snapped up to take in the sight of the same blonde haired boy he had helped on the train the day before. Shaggy blonde, almost silver hair, framing round boyish features, and two deep stormcloud eyes.
Looking legitimately dumbfounded, the elf merely stared at him, eyes growing impossibly large. “D-D-did Master Draco, just tell Dobby p-please and th-thank you?”
Breathing heavily, his eyes growing wide at the figure before him, Draco could feel his body tensing up, autonomously moving to flatten itself as far back against the wall as he could in an attempt to put as much distance as possible between himself and the professor. He could still see the hard cold edges of the figure in the mine shaft, in the bank at Gringotts. A sudden, near overwhelming sense of fear and dread slowly coming to sit in the pit of his stomach, speaking of danger, and death and suffering.
and answered all the listed questions at the end of the chapter, on a corresponding parchment. This will be the first assignment for marks, do note. Dismissed.”
“Draco? Draco, dear is something the matter?” Narcissa spoke then, her delicate features shifting into the smallest of frowns. Immediately realizing that he had momentarily zoned out in the presence of his parents, Draco shook his head.
Draco Malfoy, The-Boy-Who-Fainted-On-The-First-Day-Of-School. He was never going to be able to live any of this down. Never. He should just give up on school and leave right now. How in the world was he ever supposed to make his family proud, when the first thing that came to the other kids’ minds the moment they would meet him was that he was some sort of invalid?
Smiling at her words, Draco couldn’t help the laugh that bubbled past his lips. “Really? I look forward to it.”
"What? Of course we have to do something! If the Dark Lords brings himself back your whole planned would be ruined wouldn't it?"
“Th-Thank you everyone. I’m sorry for causing all of this bother for you all. I do think I just got a little too excited that’s all.” Draco spoke, giving his parents his guiltiest most regretful and embarrassed sort of stare.
And considering Trelawney was Trelawney and the one with the direct contact with Skeeter, she didn't exactly bother with sending her half of the letters out for review from Drake and Draco before mailing them, so the two of them had mostly been keeping ahead of the papers themselves by nagging the woman incessantly about what she had sent in. Which clearly was all according to her nefarious plan of making Draco do all of her blasted marking for her.
Taking her hand, Draco immediately felt a pull at the pit of his stomach, clenching his eyes shut then as the familiar feel of being squeezed in all directions took hold upon his form. Gravity shifted, his body suddenly falling and floating all at once, an increasingly uncomfortable and nauseating push and pull upon the entirety of his being. Then the next thing he knew, he was bracing himself against the chill of the outside, the light of the sun suddenly bearing down upon him as the sound of hundreds of people and strange muggle crafts rang through the air.
The other merely shrugged in response. “Snape’s got a soft spot for me.” He smirked, looking only slightly smug.. “And he’s always his nastiest at the start of term I hear. Just study hard and you should be fine. And do your homework.”
“That’s quite the big claim you’re making there Granger.” Malfoy smirked. “You know what, sure. If you score top of the class, beating even me, we can study together. How does that sound?”
Nodding at the statement, and gingerly pulling forth the note Drake had him write, Draco slipped by a few older student’s meandering down the halls before making his way towards the aforementioned room. Almost immediately his hand was rushing towards his nose at the sight and smell that greeted him upon entry.
"And what makes you think that Weasley? What makes you so sure?" Draco replied slowly. "You don't know me. This is the first time we've even spoken to each other."
And Longbottom still wouldn’t sit down, so after a brief moment of anguish Draco bit out a, “Sit down Longbottom.” Finally convincing the taller boy to settle into the seat. This was awful. This was terrible. This was supposed to be his favourite class, and now he had to spend the entire time, getting ribbed by his own housemates while being surrounded by Gryffindors. This was by far the worst first day he had ever had.
Another voice then, joined the first, low and gravelly, words trailing like a hiss with each spoken sentence.
was what I discovered… I was terrified that there was something wrong and broken about me. That it was proof I really was bad and dark, given the kinds of stuff I fantasised about doing with a lover. It took a long time before I became truly comfortable with it, before I reached a point where I trusted myself enough to differentiate between my desire for consensual play and the kinds of atrocities I witnessed during the war."
"All right, enough about that," Harry said briskly, smiling gently at Draco when he looked up in surprise. "There'll be plenty of time to talk about all the fucked up complicated stuff in our pasts, and in the world, but let's save that for another night, yeah?"
What would he think? Draco might have been the one to suggest the colouring in the first place, and he clearly had more experience with this kind of thing than Harry did, but that didn't mean he wouldn't be weirded out with actually seeing Harry get so into it. Merlin, they had only
Harry nodded, giving her a genuine smile in return. She was clearly remembering Draco wasn't the same boy he'd been when he'd made all the wrong choices. He appreciated her trying.
He heard Draco coming up behind him, his steps slow and measured, as if he was afraid to spook Harry like some frightened rabbit. Draco reached for Harry's trembling hand, taking hold of it in a firm grip as he turned Harry around to face him.
"Hey," he said, trying to keep his voice low and soothing. "My name's Harry. Lady Foley's attacked this hospital and the resistance is working to bring the bad guys in. I'm here to help get everybody out safely. What's your name?"
"So," Draco began after a tense moment of silence. "Friday night. How are you feeling about it now that you've had a few days to process everything?"
"So do you," Draco replied as he pulled Harry down on top of him on their ridiculously comfortable mattress. He scratched his fingers along Harry's scalp in that way that always made Harry's cock twitch while arching temptingly beneath him.
Parvati and Harry leapt up in a flash, wands at the ready before realising it was only Fathi. He looked awful, his normally well-groomed hair in disarray and his skin dull and tinged with grey, completely unlike his usually warm, tawny complexion. Parvati's expression creased with concern, her first thought for Fathi (and she said there was nothing between them) while Harry's thoughts were entirely on Foley and what Fathi might have found out.
had done that. She'd taken Draco from him, she was the reason he was here, and now Harry was going to take all her power away from
Draco laughed. "Yes, of course. It looks like we're done eating. Shall we head back to the office to transcribe and file her statement?"
was certainly looking forward to finally letting go of the stress he'd been carrying over how badly he wanted his friends to get on with his boyfriend. Apparently he'd missed the mark, however, because Draco pulled back and stared at him, his eyes wide with sudden worry.
"Excellent. Harry, owl me when you're home and healed. Malfoy, it was… not entirely unpleasant working with you. Let me know if you ever want me to clobber you at chess again." He turned and frowned. "Oi, Junior Auror Rogers, what do you think…" Ron's voice trailed off as he strode back towards the scene.
Harry knew his own expression was equally rapt as he imagined Draco lying naked and sundrenched on a dazzling white sand beach. He felt a sudden longing to be there right now, sitting beneath a swaying palm tree with Draco in his arms as they watched the sun set over a limitless ocean.
It was nearly one o'clock in the afternoon by the time Harry got back to Grimmauld Place, his stomach growling and head spinning. He was just throwing together a ham sandwich when an owl swooped through the open window, dropping an expensive-looking envelope onto the table, Harry's name written on the outside in a familiar script.
"Okay…" Draco said slowly, his brow furrowed. "I think we probably need to have another, more specific, conversation about kink and the things we each want, and what it would mean for our relationship, to clear up some assumptions and misconceptions. I told you before, Harry: I don't need kink to be happy, though it is certainly a preference. How that manifests, however, is entirely up to us. It seems like perhaps there's something you could get from it, and I really like the thought of being the one who's able to give that to you. But that kind of dynamic—even if it's something we decide to experiment with, which we don't have to—it doesn't have to be all the time, and it absolutely doesn't detract from how I see you as a man and potential partner. You're not a child, Harry Potter, and I certainly don't think of you as one."
Draco's playful expression darkened, and Harry felt like an idiot. The rumours coming over from Ireland didn't exactly make for light conversation, especially given Harry and Draco's difficult history. Lady Foley's rising popularity and her emphasis on the importance of magical power, the way her detractors seemed to disappear, the increase in hate crimes against Squibs and the magically weak, not to mention against Muggles, was all a little too reminiscent of Voldemort. It was all conjecture and hearsay at this point, rumours trickling in from not-so-far-abroad, but it still made the hairs on Harry's arms stand up.
Harry had no intention of stopping, not until they were both sticky and sated. Draco felt so fucking
A flicker of motion from outside the window overlooking the back garden caught his eye and he paused, squinting into the night. Apocrypha swooped gracefully over the neighbouring rooftops, dodging the saplings Harry had planted last spring before alighting gracefully on the windowsill with a gentle hoot. Butterflies fluttered in Harry's stomach as he caught sight of the delicate roll of parchment tied to her left leg, and he detached it carefully before digging an owl treat from one of his pockets and offering it to Apocrypha. She snapped it up with a coo and then took off once more into the night, leaving Harry alone with his missive.
Harry frowned. He wanted to protest and beg Draco to stay longer, insist that Draco let Harry suck his dick. But a glance at the clock told Harry it was already ten, and Harry didn't want to be the reason Draco wasn't at his best tomorrow. Their jobs were too dangerous not to take them seriously. Besides, Draco had given him a lot to think about, and there would hopefully be plenty more chances for Harry to suck Draco off in the future.
Then again, Harry wasn't all that sure that he wanted kinky books lying around his house, just begging to be discovered by any of the various friends that seemed to let themselves into his house as they pleased. Leaving hard evidence like that around was too risky, just asking to be caught, really. If it wasn't poor Ron stumbling upon something he couldn't unsee, it'd be Kreacher finding them in one of his paltry attempts at cleaning, and Harry very much didn't want to hear any opinions Kreacher might have on the subject.
), hadn't wanted to dress up in kids' clothes and play with toys. Maybe it was something that only Draco brought out in him, something that would go away if they were no longer together?
it was outside his usual preferences. Other than a bit of manhandling during sex, they'd not done any of the other activities Draco had mentioned being interested in; what was Draco even getting out of their arrangement, anyway? What would happen if he realised that the things Harry wanted were just a little
This answer seemed to satisfy, and Harry saw many people around the room beginning to share in his own excitement. Parvati seemed similarly enthused, though it was clear her hope was tempered with caution.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Harry agreed as Draco stepped back and began tucking himself away. Harry missed his warmth immediately, but realised he couldn't stand in Draco's foyer with his dick out forever, so he buttoned up his jeans and grabbed his cloak. "So, what next?"
. Frankly, the idea of it sounded horrifying and degrading for both parties, and though Harry did his best not to judge others for what they liked in bed, he'd not felt the slightest interest in experimenting with any of that himself.
"Nothing too exciting, I'm afraid. We just need to get a statement," Robards replied, leaning against Harry's desk and nearly toppling the unstable tower of paperwork. But for all that he was a large man, he still had the lightning-fast reflexes that had helped to earn him his position as Head Auror. He saved the tower from falling with a quick spell and a slightly reproachful look at Harry before continuing, "A woman was attacked outside her flat last night. She was robbed and banged up with some pretty nasty hexes, though she managed to escape before too much damage was done. We've been short-staffed because of that new Snidget Flu going around and we weren't able to get anybody out to St Mungo's before she was released. I know we usually send out one of the junior Aurors for this kind of thing, but unfortunately most of them have all caught the blasted flu."
He settled in at his desk, wondering at the strange quiet of the Auror Department. It was early afternoon and generally there were more people milling about at this time, but the entire floor was eerily silent. Perhaps there was some meeting or training that he'd not been invited to since he'd been gone most of the week. They'd got back from Berlin a few hours ahead of schedule, and Harry debated going home instead of sticking around through the end of the work day. He had some paperwork he could be filling out, but nothing that was immediately pressing, and the thought of finally being
Harry winced, feeling the sharp sting of Parvati's rebuke like a slap. It wasn't like Parvati to be singing Fathi's praises. Most days she couldn't even admit she liked the man. "I managed just fine working as an Auror for the past several years without
"Oh," Harry said dumbly, not sure how to process the fact that the bloke he fancied had an entirely different sort of experience than Harry had even known to wonder about. He cleared his throat. "So are you like Graham or Emily then?" he asked, attempting to sound casual and no doubt failing utterly.
His fingers twitched towards his wand with the desire to curse the wizards currently trying to bring down the shield, but as much as he wanted a good fight, his first priority was getting everybody out of the hospital safely. The operatives inside had their plans for evacuation, as did the lead Healers on every floor, but some of the patients would need extra assistance, and Harry knew they could use some extra hands, especially if there were Dark witches and wizards loose inside. Other members of the resistance had already arrived and had begun duelling with Foley's disciples, and he trusted them to manage the situation. He was certain there were more inside, attacking people who were vulnerable.
She hesitated, but it seemed she'd decided to trust Harry. "This is my brother, Sean," she said, sounding frantic. "He's only three and hates crowds. I couldn't get him to leave when the Healers were ushering everybody out." He peeked out from behind her legs, his round face wet with tears. There was a bandage wrapped around one pudgy little arm.
"All right," Malfoy said with a sigh. "Let's get this over with so you can stop stalking me, at least for today."
"Harry," Draco said, his voice severe and full of reproach. "Tell me you're not thinking of volunteering."
Draco winced almost imperceptibly before seeming to come to a decision. His body language changed, his shoulders straightening as a look of calm and quiet authority settled over his face. It was uncanny, and strangely attractive. Harry's heart skipped a beat as Draco focused his steady gaze on Harry while flicking his wrist towards the bag, sending it thwacking into his palm.
"I'm fine," Harry snapped, guilt prickling at him immediately at Parvati's hurt expression. He softened his tone as he continued, "Sorry, but I'm all right, really. You know that stuff's addictive, and I don't like the way it knocks me out." For every nightmare Harry had, there was an amazing dream to balance it out, dreams of home, of his friends, of the man he'd left behind. They were the closest Harry had to the real thing, and he wasn't giving that up.
Harry let out a strange little cry he'd not known he was capable of, like the shriek of a mortally wounded animal. "Then how do you know who was even in there? Maybe he got out! Maybe he's—"
"All right," Fathi said after a long moment. His voice was rough, his eyes glistening strangely in the low hallway light. There was something oddly foreboding in his tone, a grim finality that shivered down Harry's spine but didn't alter his resolve. Fathi straightened and gestured towards the main hall.
Harry grinned, familiar enough with Blaise by now to know he was being humorous, not insulting. "It's still… new, yeah? I want to give it a little longer before I sic this lot on them."
"No—Nothing," she said with a hiccup, dashing her tears away with the back of her hand and straightening her spine. "It's the stress, that’s all. It's getting to me. But we're almost finished."
Draco was already in bed, looking mouthwatering in a pair of low-slung dark grey joggers and a tight white shirt. He tossed aside the book he'd been flipping through when Harry came in and gave Harry a slow, thorough once-over that made Harry's cock twitch eagerly. Draco's lips twitched into the barest hint of a smug smile as he pat the bed next to him in invitation. Harry didn't need to be told twice, and he dropped his clothes on the floor in a heap—ignoring Draco's nose-wrinkle of disapproval—before crawling onto the bed and wrapping himself around Draco.
"Always," Draco replied, spreading himself out luxuriously on the bed sheets, his body a decadent fruit, ripe for the picking.
"You look like you're about to face a Dark Lord. You know we don't have to do this if you're not ready. We could go for a walk outside instead, maybe grab a drink somewhere."
Seemingly unaware or more likely utterly indifferent to the glare Draco was now currently giving her, the Witch pressed on.
"But, shouldn't I be heading back to the dorms now?" Draco spoke, slowly rising to his feet and not at all liking the sight of a smile on the older caster features. "I'm really tired, and we have our first Flying lesson tomorrow morn. Can't be late for that."
"Trying to bring himself back, yes. I personally don't know how, as I'm not exactly privy to how the stone itself works tragically but I'm sure he has some sort of plan." she finished with a shrug.
There. She had asked and given solid logic and support behind why it would benefit them both to work on the assignment together. Now once, he said yes, all that they would have to do then, would be to find a proper time and a day on the weekend that both happened to be free and -.
The purpose of having a partner across the way was to ensure each student had a frame of reference to compare themselves to, as well as a flying buddy once in the air. Though the idea of pairing students in an inter house fashion was frankly just asking for an accident to occur, particularly considering, in this instance, it was Gryffindor and Slytherin.
Lunch together then? No. Everyone always eats at their respective house tables, and she didn’t want to break any rules, so that wouldn’t work. So then what could?
Perturbed, confused and just the slightest bit afraid, Draco returns the quill back to the parchment. Well apparently his future was rather insane. Wonderful news. Fantastic even.
“R-Right!” Hermione spoke, rapidly picking up her items and bracing them against her chest. “Sorry Professor, have a wonderful weekend!”
"Potter!" The Professor called out then. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
Drake spoke wistfully, a distinct tone of fondness in his words and the slightest hints of sadness, which Draco promptly chose to ignore. Scaling up one of the towers then, with the sight of the vast scottish countryside pouring in from the windows in the early morning shine, Draco smiled at the sensation of warmth upon his features just as he noticed the sound of many soft, yet innumerable wingbeats emanating from a room just a little further down the hall.
And Draco watched then, silent and intent as the girl slowed in her departure. Then she scoffed, back straightening with a renewed sort of vigour, still not turning back. “Please. Exams? Don’t think too highly of yourself Malfoy. All I’ll need is a couple weeks, just you wait and see.”
"I will! Talk to you both soon!" Draco waved, excitement bubbling up from inside him as he slipped into the train. Almost immediately, his eyes took in the sight of countless jittery first years just like himself, dragging their luggage along the path of the train. All of the slowly but steadily peeking into cabins before disappearing inside.
He was also rather silently impressed at the fact that he hadn’t broken into hysterics yet, after being suddenly shunted into such a strange situation. Literally three days ago he had rather embarrassingly taken nipping from one of the Manor’s Peacocks and wailed for half an hour. Neat. He guessed this would have been the moment his father congratulated him for finally growing a bit more of a backbo-
But who's home? Draco thought absently, before reaching out and partially bracing himself against one of the cloth covered chairs for support. There wasn't anything he found immediately recognizable save for the clearly apparent former opulence of the place. Dull silver banisters trailing up along the sides of the stairs, inlays of gold sewn into the thick shut curtains, beautiful yet faded portraits and paintings all depicting cool and elegantly dressed women. And across the whole view, a crest emblazoned across the ends of each of the low hanging curtains and emblazoned across the chests of each regal dame.
Draco's expression grew firm, though it was not unkind. "It's non-negotiable, Harry. It's obvious that you're out of sorts. That can happen after a scene, and it's something I should have prepared you for. I didn't"—he ran a hand over his face, looking tired and a bit guilty—"I just wanted to test the waters. I didn't expect you to become so affected, but I should have, and that's my fault for not properly preparing you."
; Harry never would have left him here otherwise. That had been Draco's whole bloody argument for staying in Britain and helping the war efforts at home instead of joining the front lines. He wasn't supposed to get hurt.
All too soon they reached Draco's doorstep, and though Harry's body was yearning to be invited up, he knew it wouldn't be happening tonight. That was all right. He felt confident that it
Unfortunately, as they made their way down the stairs and came out onto the main floor, it was clear that the reception area was one of the locations Foley's followers had targeted. They were hit with a sudden wave of heat as Harry pushed open the door, and Harry pulled Cara down to the ground, getting them beneath the thick cloud of smoke and ash that hovered in the burning air. There was a tipped-over supply cart next to them, and Harry grabbed a slightly singed bedsheet, severing it into squares and doused each with an
next to sex during scenes. He knew he wanted sex with Draco, and he knew he wanted to explore the idea of ageplay and regression, but he wasn't positive that he wanted to mix them together. It hadn't felt sexual when he'd been colouring in Draco's living room before, but Harry didn't know if that was because of his headspace, or just that particular scenario. He knew plenty of people got off on the kink in a
He looked down at the coffee table and realised he'd somehow made it through several pages of the colouring book. It was open now to a picture of an Erumpent, which he'd scribbled a shocking purple with a lack of precision that made his cheeks grow warm. A spike of shame went through him as he realised how thoroughly he'd lost track of everything—time, his surroundings, and, apparently, even his ability to colour within the lines. It had been so easy to turn off his brain for a little while and let Draco take care of everything.
