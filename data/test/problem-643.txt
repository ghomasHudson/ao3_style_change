"Fine," sighed Seamus, "Bowie is acceptable."
," explained Harry quickly. "Look, I'll pay for your hostel, I'll buy you a suit for a job interview, book you a place in rehab, whatever works for you—"
"Brilliant!" said Jack. "Can I have some?"
Malfoy blushed scarlet at that, and Harry's heart threatened to hammer out of his chest. He wasn't sure why the idea of putting a collar on — or putting a collar on Malfoy — did such strange things to him, but it did, and he ended up too flustered to deny the suggestion that Malfoy was his boyfriend.
Malfoy returned home at ten minutes to seven, while Harry was burning his usually reliable pasta sauce and trying not to go insane. There was an odd edge to the conversation in the kitchen, everyone tense, everyone putting on a performance, as though Malfoy was already there to see them; at the sound of the front door, the conversation abruptly stopped.
The wardrobe was a treasure trove of ridiculous clothing. Before settling on his signature look, young Sirius had experimented with some truly offensive patterned shirts, and there were several pairs of hideous flares. But then there were white t-shirts and turned-up jeans, a black bomber jacket, some leather biker trousers. He folded up everything that might fit him, and tossed them onto the bed.
"Excellent," said Hermione stiffly. "Ron and I are both very happy."
"Ooh, careful what you say," said Ellie from behind the screen, a laugh in her voice. "You'll give your boyfriend ideas."
will. Perhaps a toy we will keep for the garden."
"No," said Malfoy, still dry. "I do have my freedom, mercifully, although I must admit my alternatives are unattractive."
He saw him again in the corridor, all glares and hate despite it all, and Harry expected them to pass each other without a word until Draco slammed him into the wall.
"Thank you," said Harry, and meant it.
"Oh good," said Malfoy, sliding up the bed to put his face in the pillow. "The best part of any hostel experience," he mumbled.
Malfoy snorted.
Harry looked away from the piano keys. Draco's face was close, his thigh pressed warm against Harry's own. If he noticed Harry's scrutiny, he didn't show it. Malfoy brought his hands up to the keyboard and began to play every note in sequence, fingers steady and elegant. Harry swallowed.
like you for a solid year," said Harry, and although he was teasing he immediately felt bad for it.
Harry laughed.
Before Harry had time to think, he had lowered his lips to Draco's.
." He gave Harry a haughty look.
"Yes, well," she said. "About that."
"Good. Now it is Lunch, Master Harry, and you is needing to be fed up some more."
When everyone had pushed themselves back from the kitchen table, full and holding their stomachs, Harry cleared his throat.
"Maybe it's time to make new ways," said Harry. "So you don't have to put your trust in wizards."
She was obviously enjoying her studies at the Library, however, as she kept attempting to engage the household on the content of her various books, talking about the many benefits of Mind Healing at dinner and leaving copies prominently on the coffee table. After the thin layer of dust made it clear nobody was going to pick them up, the books vanished, and in their place were laid out a series of short, brightly coloured pamphlets.
they think would happen? Harry didn't even know if he wanted to
"He tells everyone but me these things." Harry was aware his voice sounded childish.
Malfoy's eyes flicked to her; he set his fork down politely.
"Why would I do that?" said Ron, looking slightly shifty. "I don't need girls to throw themselves at me. I already have the best one."
Harry almost wanted to laugh. Sirius had built his young identity around this poster, even down to the biker jacket Harry now wore. Next to it, he'd cut out an advert of a digital wristwatch; Harry was suddenly reminded of Arthur Weasley, obsessed with Muggle things, and he wanted to laugh even more. He'd thought Sirius was so cool — and he
"Quiet and weird. He's been out a lot. Tried to give me money earlier."
"I'd be in trouble if she found out I was trying to use the soup run to find Draco.”
"I guess so," said Harry. It never would have occurred to him to ask any of them for help. "Yeah. I think… I should do that."
"How do you know where the Prefects' Bathroom is?" said Harry.
"Jack?" said Harry, looking at the boy's bed. It was also empty.
an addict, he might have pissed them all off," said Ron, making a move towards the kettle. Hermione pulled up a chair; Harry stayed cross-legged on the floor. "Besides, I dunno how good Slytherins really are when you're broke in a gutter."

"Yes," she repeated, after a moment. "Yes, right. I don't think I'm the same person I was and I know
"Because…?" asked Draco, in a faint voice.
Malfoy let out a sharp exhale.
"Mr Malfoy!" said Slughorn with cold eyes. "I'll ask you to hold your tongue about the greatest hero of the age."
"That's a good idea," said Hermione brightly, "Why don't you go together? You can't leave Draco in the lurch Harry, he'll need your help with the Muggle bits."
"Well, thanks," said Harry, equally uncomfortable. "For the appreciation, not the hatred, obviously."
. Ginny, Neville, and Hermione had coloured the sofas, beanbags, curtains and even the carpet various shades of green, and the ceiling was absolutely covered with green streamers, floating lights, shamrock bunting and Irish flags. Over the fireplace was a vast orange banner,
"Thanks, though," he said. "For caring. About what I felt."
"Alright?" repeated Malfoy, confused.
"That woman is a
"Weren't they courting Aristo?" asked Ron, through his mouthful.
Malfoy snorted.
"I'm glad you got your dream job," said Malfoy, eventually.
Cho's face went stony, and Harry wanted to dissolve into a puddle on the concrete and dribble away into a gutter. But then she laughed, probably at his mortified face, and patted him on the arm.
"Only the best for you," said Draco indulgently, as though they hadn't been tense moments before, and Pansy patted his arm.
eyeliner. He was carrying, incongruously, a cheap, lumpy carrier bag. Harry couldn't tell what was inside, but it looked heavy.
Fish shrugged. "Alright."
"Or just stealing free food from the mouths of the needy," said Ron.
Malfoy looked up warily, straight at Harry, and Harry was so startled he dropped his book.
, on a night Harry was feeling awkward and out-of-sorts. It wasn't even that smooth, unctuous charm that Lucius employed — it was a little too edgy for that, a little too earnest, Malfoy's pleasure at a favourable reaction etched into every angle of his face, every line of his mouth.
"Earth to Potter?" said Dean, kicking him in the shin.
"Harry, I'm sorry, I'll go," said Dean.
"Yes. You can stay. Plenty of room. As long as you want. Please do. It'd be my pleasure."
Harry looked between the pan in his hand and Malfoy and then raised an eyebrow. Malfoy, to Harry's pleasure, looked embarrassed.
"Hey!" said Harry.
and dumping them on the floor. He lifted up the lamp and peered at the back of the shelf.
"Don't give me undue credit for the bare minimum of moral decency," he said. "It hardly begins to make up for what I've done."
"It says 'look down'," he said. "What does that mean?"
Harry looked at the man's expression, tense when it had been laconic, and wanted to kick himself.
"Oh," said Malfoy flatly. "Oh, is that what it was."
"Yes, I think I can handle myself. But for your peace of mind, I'll Apparate rather than walk."
"No," said Hermione. "And I'm sure some humility will do him good… but you didn't see him. I'd have said he was on drugs if he were a Muggle."
"Who's there?" he snapped. Harry held his breath.
"With crème anglaise," said Kreacher, giving him a knowing wink.
"Come on, breakfast," said Ron.
Ginny and Ron insisted upon following Dean to the post box, fascinated by how it worked. Harry let them go, and in the quiet he picked up the catalogue again, surprised at how excited he was to see his new clothes. It felt like more than just a necessity. It felt like new growth, like the start of a change. He'd almost forgotten that he was allowed to have nice things.
"I thought I was deferring to your experience," he murmured. "Besides, I have too many thoughts in my head at once. I want — " Harry swallowed his fear. "I want to come against you, just like this. I want to come in your mouth. I want you to come in mine. Fuck, I want to feel — I want — "
Harry began to wonder what he might find when he got there. He was not overly surprised to see Ginny leaning in to kiss him as he arrived.
Blaise raised an eyebrow.
"Not sure about that," muttered Harry.
on me? I'm not going to do any fucked-up Dark Minion stuff, you know. Or do you think I'm that insane?"
"We need to tell Professor McGonagall," said Hermione. "And Ron, write to George right away."
"Tattoo," he said, and she looked up at him then, an appraising look. He obviously met with her approval, because she smiled.
it to have fun, is it?"
"What about Nirvana?" offered Harry.
He stared at the empty space for a long moment. Then he pulled open one of the desk drawers to look for a pen; there was a self-inking quill at the very top of the drawer, resting innocently on the papers below it. Harry gave the walls a suspicious glance and picked it up. He was fairly certain it was one of his, from his desk downstairs.
"Did you know his probation officer has been blocking his ability to get Muggle ID?" said Harry, because it seemed like a more reasonable thing to be annoyed about than 'Malfoy has a friend over'. Ron's eyebrows descended into a frown.
"I think I might wait to try mine on," added Hermione.
Draco Malfoy stood in the back of the van, his cheeks flushed from the cold, his head at an awkward angle against the roof and long hair spilling out from under his wooly green hat. His expression was caught between guilty and exasperated.
"Lovely," said Luna to herself, admiring her own pudding. Harry glanced at Draco again, and could only agree.
, not stiffen up entirely, loosen your elbow up a bit. Here." Draco closed a hand over his wrist, tilted it slightly. Harry stared at the point of contact, thinking that the idea of him
"Tell me about it," said Harry.
Before Harry even had a chance to move, Malfoy had slid elegantly behind the beer pong audience. Harry followed, nudging Ron in the back as he went. Ron looked around, flinging glitter as he did so; his eyes widened at the sight of Malfoy at the punch bowl, ladle in hand.
"It can be like that," she said. "When Ted died, I felt lost for such a long time. It felt like it would be forever. But one day I looked up and I realised that nothing was as dark as it had once appeared. The weight of grief had lessened enough for me to start moving again. It never goes away, of course, but it always changes. Over time."
"That's better, isn't it?" said Harry. "To do it instinctively? You could have done it cynically, hedging your bets, like a spy might. But you just did it because you didn't want us to die."
"Good point, Harry, good point," said Dean, snorting and patting him slightly awkwardly on the back. He didn't make a move to push Harry away, and so Harry didn't move, safe in the warm dark behind his eyelids.
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and led her down into the kitchen.
criminal. Maybe that's why he was so interested in Draco, him being a real Lord or whatever. Jenny and I warned him to stay away from Spider, but Dray kinda went all gooey from the attention and I reckon we might have driven him into his arms a bit, so to speak, because of all the fighting we were doing."
"Wanna play me at chess, Malfoy?" asked Ron. "You're getting a bit too good for comfort, you know."
"Well, to be fair, sometimes stuff slips out about magic," she said, grinning. "They just think I have delusions. You know, from all the trauma."
But he was happy to pretend for a while.
"Yeah?" said Harry defensively, snatching his cloak back. "No harm in staying educated."
Harry pulled on his pyjama bottoms and then stuck his head out of the door. Malfoy was on the landing with a sheet wrapped around him at armpit height, bony shoulders spiky and tense. He was staring at the three identical closed doors in front of him.
Malfoy, Harry was beginning to notice, seemed to get particularly posh when he was uncomfortable.
home.
"Well, really," said Hermione archly. "I never knew you felt that way about our headmistress..."
Inside was a leather wallet, cracked with age and held together with string. Harry slid it from its hiding place and set it on the desktop, fingers tracing over the leather binding. It felt faintly warm, another familiar signature, but not Sirius this time. It felt more like — like the faint tang of magic in the bathrooms as he cleaned the grout, the hum of the corridors as he painted over cracks in the plaster.
"I like it," he said quietly. "Kind of a rebirth thing."
"I'm asking because I don't really know where I get my looks from. Or if it even matters. And I wondered if you knew. Or if you ever think about it." Harry flopped sideways and pressed his face into the grass. "Sorry, I'm not good at this, please can we forget I ever spoke?"
"Nah," said Ginny, not noticing the wave crashing over Harry. "Makes it easier. Besides, it helps, you know? Being possessed, being groomed — that's what they call it, when you're persuaded into something nasty as a child — it makes you question your version of reality. But nobody in group gives you grief if your grip on reality isn't that strong. Being a bit weird is… you know, okay."
"Here," said Dean, pulling Harry's head forward to lean on his shoulder. Dean smelled of honey and lemon and charcoal, and Harry pressed his face into the warmth of his shoulder, trying to take deep breaths, trying to breathe through the waves of unassailable loss, intractable fury.
can't do anything right. And I'm not even fighting back now; I'm just trying to be my absolute best, hoping for those moments where the sun shines through the clouds and he smiles at me like I'm perfect.
"A finger," said Draco archly. "Go slow."
Was there something horribly wrong with him?
"Ritchie?" said Harry, hoping to get a sane reaction from someone.
"Alright, Harry?" he mouthed. Harry shook his head, dull embarrassment washing over the roar of his burning chest.
"If it's bloody Potter...
Draco's face lit up. He glanced at the Muggle crowd with a slow, secret smile.
"Hang on, I forgot my book – I'll see you in the common room."
"It's just Harry. He gets like that sometimes. It used to scare me a bit, in school, but I know better now. You wouldn't know, you never saw him with the DA, but he's gentle and patient when you need it most. It's kind of impressive, considering who brought him up."
"... I only said all that as a cover," he said eventually. "I couldn't bear the thought that I... and I thought if Ritchie ever found out..."
But Harry had regretted it. Even though Draco had wanted to use an Unforgivable on him, Harry regretted it, because Draco had been a mess and he was so damned proud and Harry'd never hated him enough to wish him true suffering, much less death.
Then Draco was pushing him back, rolling him until their positions were reversed: Draco's long, tensed form upon him, lips still pressed to his. Harry tilted his chin and the kiss slipped into a soft, open-mouthed thing, both of them breathing too hard for caution. Draco's hand curled tight in his hair, his chest pressing hard against Harry's on every skittish exhale.
Harry padded closer, watching Malfoy's back as he walked towards the record player.
"Do you remember in third year when I decided I was going to go full artist and rock a beret?" said Dean. They all snickered.
His eyes flicked to Draco beside her. Draco's eyes were down, mouth twisted in dismay. Harry stared at that sad quirk of lips and racked his brains for something to say that might lighten the mood; he wished he'd thought to put on some music, at least.
"The cottage pie sounds great," said Harry, casting a nervous glance at the door. He hoped not too many students made it a habit to raid the kitchens, because he'd be off his guard with all the food the elves would try to force-feed him.
Harry paid the bill and fled, leaving Fish to polish off what was left alone.
"No, come on!" Ginny ran over to her and pulled her up, dragging her behind the sofa. Hermione threw up a shimmering privacy screen.

John beamed, and guilt settled uncomfortably into Harry's stomach.
's obsession with one particular photo of him had been eye-opening; he'd been snapped at Hogwarts during the early days of the cleanup efforts, standing amongst the rubble in the sun with his shirt open, hands in pockets as he took a break to gaze out over the lake. The associated article had jumped straight past complimentary and into terrifyingly breathless commentary on his bare chest. Harry couldn't get past the feeling that his fame had something to do with it, but there was only so much fame could explain.
"Yes," said Hermione.
A skinny man strolled up to him with a loose, wide-limbed gait. He had large, dark eyebrows, and a face that was hard to age. He was sipping at his soup in one hand.
He pulled out his invisibility cloak, too. How could he be mobbed if no-one could see where to jump?
"No," said Malfoy, giving her a look down his nose. He paused for a moment, as everyone perked up expectantly to hear the nickname. "It was Posh boy. Or Poshy, which sounds rather dreadful to my ear, but I don't think I was working with the nation's greatest wits."
"Ten pounds and twenty-six pence," said Malfoy, pushing it towards Harry. "Rent. I can probably do better, but the rain somewhat disrupted the day's efforts."
Harry could feel the roaring in his ears again, the hot prickle of tears threatening to escape. Dean looked at him, blinked, and then scowled.
Harry stopped pretending he wasn't listening and openly stared at them, but Pansy and Draco's eyes were locked upon each other, neither noticing that the room had gone quiet around them.
"Forget-me-nots," said Draco. Harry smiled.
"Malfoy," said Hermione softly, "I have a hangover potion if you'd like it. You know what it does if you're still drunk when you take it?"
"Good," said Hermione. "I don't think that sort of thing is important."
Regret made Harry's feet heavy as he followed Draco to the third floor. He was foggy and irritable and unaccustomed to the weight of the feelings he'd felt tonight, and Draco looked exhausted, and he should just open his mouth to say something,
Hermione raised her eyebrows, but Harry just shook his head.
"Probably," Ron agreed, shrugging. "Hermione'll put me in a shirt at least."
, thought Harry. That was what people did, when they'd invited someone into their bed. They brought them coffee, and kissed them gently awake. And maybe they did other things, too.
Then the Weird Sisters came on and Ginny dragged Neville up for a re-enactment of their awkward Yule Ball dance, but they were both much smoother now, and Neville looked kind of red and Ginny looked kind of serious and at the end of the dance Ginny gave a little tug to the front of Neville's jumper and then they were kissing. Harry found himself looking at Luna; she was sitting on the arm of the armchair, knees up, just watching the kiss as though everything were so very normal.
In the case of Arthur's Magic Mobile, he suspected Molly really meant it. Hermione had bought Ron one, too, and Harry had spent most of Boxing Day exchanging texts with both Ron and Arthur on his own phone until the beeping began to drive Molly so mad that she threatened to confiscate them all.
Harry shook his head.
"Interesting names.”
"Blaise," said Malfoy. "Open the window, Potter, it's for me."
"Selfish," he said, and it wasn't a question exactly.
"I wouldn't have told, not really," said Harry.
Draco turned to go. Harry darted forward and caught his wrist.
"Be my guest," said Harry, letting his eyelids lower a fraction, and he was treated to the sight of Draco's composure dropping again just before he moved in for another kiss. Harry felt devoured, undone, turned on more than he thought he could ever feel, but then Draco's hand slid to unbutton his jeans and he realised he could feel it more.
Harry shrugged. "All I know is what I told you. Some guy called Spider reeled him into it."
He leant against the wall, gasping for breath as Malfoy regained his senses. His lips looked bruised.
Seamus grinned back at him, and Harry had a sudden flash of panic. Seamus was provocative by nature, and Malfoy was — Harry wasn't sure what Malfoy was, but certainly up for repartee. Were they going to flirt?
"But how do you feel?" said Hermione.
Harry relaxed back into the pillowy armchair. He felt a little sleepy now.
"I don't think nice things about people," he began. "I think about what I could say to people to make them feel bad, to wipe the smile off their faces. I
Malfoy turned away from the drawing room. Harry took several swift steps back down the stairs to avoid being seen, nearly spilling his tea.
It was quite a good impression, especially given that Malfoy hadn't heard the portrait yet. He wondered if Malfoy had ever heard the real thing, long ago as a child. Harry laughed at him, and that seemed to be permission for Malfoy to begin a discreet running commentary on the clientele of the tea shop in his Walburga Black voice, scathing critiques on their Muggle appearance and how it dishonoured the family. Harry knew he was hearing a little of the nasty inner monologue that Malfoy claimed to loathe now, but there was one thing he agreed with
Harry left his shirt open a little, so it was visible. Ginny looked him over, approving.

in the air that week, and it rippled through Harry's consciousness like the wake of a great ship passing.
"And Luna," said Pansy, voice painfully polite. "You're well, I hope?"
"Yeah," said Harry, staring hopelessly at Malfoy's bottom lip, longing twisting deep within him. "Because Pansy was right, I did like it when you needed me. I was a dick to her because I was worried it was going to be the end. I knew it wouldn't be forever, I knew none of this would be forever, I want you to get stronger and happier and not need my help at all, but at the same time I still wanted —"
"Don't touch the curtain," Harry warned. "She's silenced, but I still haven't figured out how to take her off the wall yet."
"Do you trust me?" said the voice behind the screen, and an older woman popped her head round the panel, grinning. One side of her hair was shaved to the skin, the other side dyed in purples and pinks. Harry was painfully reminded of Tonks.
"There's obviously something in the air today," said Harry eventually.
Harry pulled Draco in with a fist in his hair, kissed that beautiful smart mouth.
"Because you're all evil!" said Harry, and then bit his lip. "Well, complete gits, at least."
He wanted to be able to talk about it.
. He'd always wanted to exert some sort of influence over Malfoy, but he hadn't imagined in a million years it would be
Ginny laughed. Pansy raised an eyebrow.
"To go take some drugs," said Malfoy, rolling his eyes.
"You can tell me later," said Pansy gently, leaning into him, and Draco nodded. His jaw was tight as he pushed open the dining room door.
"I'm going to get Hermione," Ron muttered. Harry slipped along the corridor on quiet feet, sliding gently to a sitting position beside Malfoy.
"It's magic," said Harry, grinning at her.
"So," said Draco. "You want to talk."
Harry rolled over to scrabble in his bedside table.
them into staying!" Harry forced himself to be calmer, for Malfoy's sake. "If someone else told you that story, would you tell them it was their fault for being so stupid?"
"Of course you don't," he said faintly.
"For tomorrow we may die," agreed Harry, flashing Malfoy an encouraging grin over his shoulder. Malfoy stared back at him for a long moment. Harry's gaze slid down to Malfoy's left arm, the faint silhouette of something there beneath the makeup, and suddenly felt awful for even

"You're winding me up," said Draco, suddenly scrabbling away. "You don't say stuff like that. You don't... you're
Harry stared into the fire as the green light faded, trailing his hand affectionately along the kitchen mantelpiece. He thought about taking the record player upstairs to his room. He wondered about finding something to clean. He thought about making a Floo call, but he couldn't think of anyone he particularly wanted to talk to.
"I could unblock your nose," he said, raising his wand.
"So," said Malfoy, tone bright now, as though he were telling a bedtime story. "Where was I? He's hit me, and he's sorry, and it won't happen again, except it does. The second time, he's sorry, but not
"I'd rather you didn't," said Ron.
"Well," he said. "There
be needing manual jobs to be happy."
"Well done, very polite," said Andromeda, smiling, and Teddy beamed.
Harry pulled on his new blue jeans and a white v-neck t-shirt, looking at himself in the mirror. He might have made a big deal of changing but even Harry could see it made a difference. The t-shirt fit flatteringly close to his chest, flashing the necklace, and that one small detail plus the obvious newness of the outfit made everything about his look more deliberate — made Harry's stubble look designer, the long hair fashionable.
He prowled closer, and Harry was sure his heart stopped, but Malfoy just came up behind him, peering over his shoulder at the pictures.
"Hey, Harry... do you think even she'd..."
"Malfoy, did you and Snape just
," he said, trying to hide a smile. "You git."
"Besides," said Ron, smiling softly at Hermione as she tucked her own hair behind one ear and brandished her wand at a page, "He's making an obvious effort right now. With 'Mione. He's been making an effort for hours. That counts for something."
Then the room lit up in bright white light, a loud boom rattling through the windows, and Draco startled and pulled away, eyes wide. Harry looked at the shower of sparks behind the curtained windows, and laughed.
"Right," said Ron uncomfortably. "So we've got that straight. Er, or not."
Draco's expression was tense, but as he took in Harry's blank stare, his lips began a slow curve upward. Not quite a smile. Definitely a smirk. Harry couldn't think about anything but his desire to kiss that smirk —
doing that, I tried to apologise… just like his ex. And now he's leaving."
Malfoy's interest was clearly piqued, but he followed Harry down the stairs. The remains of the night's takeaway were still strewn across the kitchen table, under a Stasis Charm; Harry grabbed a chicken ball and popped it into his mouth as he retrieved a plate and a fork for Malfoy.
And Kreacher was wrong, there
way over a potion!"
illegal. Like Love Potions. The advert is just... a joke."
"So like second year?" said Ron, grinning at Harry.
Feeling fairly good about himself didn't make going downstairs any easier. Dean and Seamus stopped bickering and left long before Harry was ready to face strangers, and Harry had just decided that he wasn't going to go after all when Luna turned up at his door. She was in the lurid silver dress robes Harry recognised from the Slug Club party, but she'd done something to the cut of them. They looked more Muggle now, something about the waistline, or perhaps the three-quarter sleeves. She was also wearing enormous shamrock earrings.
"Malfoy," said Hermione, after a moment. "You have traces of opiates in your system. Are you
"Yes," said Malfoy, then sighed. "No. Just, I don't know, be normal. Pretend I'm not here or something."
"Actually," said Harry, "I think I'd have made a better Death Eater than him."
It was strange to see him like this, passive and empty. Shaking off his discomfort, Harry pulled himself out of his armchair and padded down towards the kitchen. Malfoy followed, footfalls almost as quiet as Harry's.
Harry itched. He knew that an important part of Draco's personal development, and therefore his development into someone Harry could kiss, was going to be independent friendships. But that didn't make Harry feel any better. To compensate for his petty, sinking feeling, he said:
"We can't tell Professor McGonagall!" protested Harry. "She'd – it's –
Hermione had the grace to look embarrassed. "Yes, well. You should know better now, at least. How much did you hear?"
"Right," said Harry, "Er, yes. That'd be good."
"Great," he said, and looked back to the sink. "Anyway, I think the drip should be fixed now, but honestly I wouldn't keep anything in this cupboard for a few weeks, just to be safe."
Harry glanced back at his house, exhaling.
Harry was going to come in seconds. He was sure of it. He clenched the sheets, a groan forming deep in the back of his throat.
"But –" protested Ritchie, looking quite deranged, "But you're so delicious Harry, I can't bear to sleep in these dorms knowing you're near!" He tried to lunge again.
Harry just stared at them both, unable to process the concept.
"Pansy, you promised you wouldn't be mean to his face," drawled Draco from the stairs, and Pansy's whole face lit up. It made her softer, prettier.
It was also, Ron had told him, very illegal, and required special dispensation to do it as an Auror. Harry, stomping his way down the stairs, wondered if this were one of the benefits of being an Unspeakable.
"I can't go back upstairs," said Harry quickly. "Ritchie."
"Shit!
Harry bit his lip, hard. He didn't want to move or speak, for fear Malfoy would stop talking.
"Your buddy Fish.”
"How so?" said Fish.
"Right.” Malfoy nodded. "Of course. I'll just be going. Thank you for — well, for not murdering me and burying me in the garden and telling Potter I ran away, but also the chat."
There was a long silence. Harry put his head in his hands.
A long silence. Harry couldn't quite see either of their faces.
Harry, shrugged. "I had to. To kill him, I had to die. And I was ready to die, I walked right into it knowing I had to. Then I found out I still had a tether to life, I had the choice, and I chose to come back. I'm glad I did, but I don't really know
and older, and Hermione sporting an endearing shower of freckles across her brown skin.
"Oh, tea!" she said, descending upon the tray. "Exactly what I need."
Malfoy rugby-tackled him anyway. They went crashing to the floor, basket flying down the corridor.
"I couldn't," he said.
Malfoy's eyes were down now, his fair eyelashes sparkling in the hallway light.
"Why wouldn't it?" said Hermione, laughing. "Here." She extended the arms of his shirt with a twist of her wand.
"Yes," said Malfoy, in his sullen child voice. "Please, be my guest."
"Er, obviously," said Ron, bashing him with his elbow.
"Buying you that dress would be a public service, Gin," said Seamus, with a wink.
"What's that?"
"I'm going to make tea," he announced, voice sharper than he'd expected. "Want one?"
"And you better talk to Ron, else he'll strangle you to death for hurting his sister."
different, warm and welcoming, the cracked floor tiles repaired. Harry was also certain that there were more doors down here than there used to be. The smell of freshly baked bread floated up from the kitchen.
Harry knew that Neville was, of course, a decorated and impressive war hero. But it had never occurred to him to see him as
"I'm going to pour another drink," he said. He curled into an armchair, trying not to think, humming to the music and drinking until he slept, flung out over the arm of the sofa.
," said Hermione. "I'm so sorry."
Except Sirius's room. There was always Sirius's room.
"Of course not, Harry!" said Ginny, apparently not noticing her brother's urgent head-shake. "It's your house, you can invite whoever you want."
"And the men of the village are in love with her, of course," she said. "She has a gentleman caller every day. She rebuffs them all, of course, but isn't that charming?"
Hermione, who had visibly slumped at the mention of the Harpies, looked annoyed at this point of common ground.
Hermione's voice went very quiet, wide brown eyes flicking over them. Taking in Harry, leaning against the counter, almost thigh to thigh with Draco, angling his chin. Malfoy staring at him, knife slack in his hand, wide-eyed.
Harry nodded, throat closing up despite itself.
"I don't know
"Doesn't that bother you?" he said, surprising himself with the question. There was some vague unnamed horror that rose in his chest at the thought, something that had to do with the idea of being
"Really?" asked Seamus. "It's kind of your signature though, right? The Ginny Weasley hair swoosh? Makes the boys faint and the girls cry?"
"Me. Can I come in?"
He stopped when Harry entered.
"I'm flattered," said Harry. Malfoy scowled and opened his mouth, but Harry was spared his riposte by the whistle of the kettle. Harry and Malfoy both went to get up; Malfoy looked at him for a moment, then shrugged and sat down again.
to, if I'd been brought up like Draco? What would my values be?" She gave Harry an embarrassed glance, catching herself in her monologue. "It's all very interesting speculation, but it doesn't really get us anywhere. We'll never know. The important thing is who we are now, and who we want to be. And who
"Hey, Hermione," he heard Seamus say, as they all entered the drawing room behind him. "Malfoy was looking for you earlier."
"I'm alright, you know," he said. "It's a good pain."
. You're the one who jumped in to defend me against my own best friend. Make you feel big, did it?"
"What if we get lost?" asked Malfoy, pitch high, and Dean snorted.
Malfoy turned his head to look at him. His eyes were wet and red-rimmed. He took a deep, shuddering breath.
"Oh," said the man, pulling back a little. "Sorry."
"I fit in just fine, thanks," said Dean, but they all traipsed upstairs to the top floor again and Malfoy pushed Harry gently into his room to 'find something befitting the occasion'. Harry came out in his dragonhide boots, combats and long-sleeved grey shirt, which received a shrugging approval from Dean. Malfoy looked like he wanted to complain about the outfit, but he was aware he didn't really know enough about Muggle attire to judge.
"Will you put on that one that goes
"And it was a good choice, until you killed it for everyone."
"Right," repeated Malfoy. "So… I'm going out."
"What? How?"
"Erm, Draco Malfoy's outside," said the boy. "He told me to tell you that –"
"Anyway, he was a proper lost little lamb," he said, waving a poppadom for emphasis. "Didn't know how any of the real world worked at all. Didn't know about the dole. Who doesn't know about the dole? Didn't know about how to talk to the council, didn't know about shelters, didn't have any fuckin' ID on him or anything. Didn't even have sensible shoes."
They'd only invoked Red Topic twice in the house. They'd invented it when a casual group discussion of Lorcan d'Eath's
"Oh! Right, yes. Thanks. I'm nearly done, I'll be out soon. I promised Ron I'd play chess."
He got the owl saying that Hermione was back in the country a few weeks later. He left it on the kitchen table, unable to decide if he should seek them out or let them have their reunion. He was so bad at grief, and Ron and Hermione overflowed with it.
Malfoy leant his head against the wall again, restless, Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed. Harry found his eyes drawn to the long, pale stretch of skin with a hot flare of
"You did me a favour and looked the other way, once. I guess I don't want to look the other way, now I know you're here."
"I think I tuned it out," said Harry. He'd done that with so many of the
Harry looked at Ron, expecting to share a glance of horror at the depravity of the conversation, but Ron was opening his mouth to speak.
"How badly do you want to repay him? What's it worth?"
"Fuck, Potter, I want you, what the hell have you done to me I'm going to kill you for this,
"I am
Harry listened. And by the end of it, Harry realised something.
"Did you just call me Harry?" he said.
"Oh, come on, Potter, you can't say something like that and then run away," said Malfoy. "Don't think I won't hex you because you're the Boy-Who-Lived."
? Or because you don't really know your options?" He gave Harry a suspicious eyebrow. "Or because you're too innocent and chaste to be specific?"
"I'd want a lily," he said, from nowhere in particular, but as soon as he said it he knew it made perfect sense. His mother had left a mark of love on him, a mark that had saved his life. It seemed fitting that he should honour that with a mark of his own making. It felt like the
He came back five minutes later, grinning.
"Sorry," said Harry, and chucked the man a bread roll. The man rolled his eyes, shifted his backpack on his back and wandered off.
we can dial it down on the drinking games."
"Okay," he heard himself say. "Okay, I will."
Harry turned to push Malfoy away, but it all seemed to go horribly wrong, because now they were there, he couldn't move his hands off Malfoy's shoulders. And Malfoy was giving him a dark, daring look, tilting his chin, and Harry wasn't going to
because apparently the accent isn't proof enough that I am a British citizen. So I gave up on that notion and went to my meeting with my probation officer, which was an
His shoulders shuddered. Harry wanted to touch him, but he didn't know if Malfoy would get the same comfort out of touch as Harry did in these situations. He took a deep breath, hoping Malfoy would hear it and follow his breathing.
Malfoy's face slid into his vision, wide-eyed and alarmed.

of a thrill it gives you," said Draco, raising his eyebrows at their crushed hips. Harry growled, half-disgust and half-passion, and pulled Draco's face towards him.
"Excruciating," agreed Malfoy. "I absolutely hate you."
"I just don't want it to be a big deal," said Harry, cringing a bit at the idea of a song and dance about it. God, would the

Harry shifted on his pouffe, rolling his eyes.
"Max offered me something called Molly once," said Ginny thoughtfully, gazing at the ceiling. "I often wonder what it would have been like…"
"Okay.” Harry shrugged and looked back to his pasta. Malfoy was silent for a long moment.
Ron and Hermione went to bed after that, but Harry didn't want to sleep. He played cards with Ginny and Luna for a little while, but eventually Luna rested her head in Ginny's lap, eyes closing, and Ginny began to struggle to follow who was winning, and Harry realised they were only staying awake to keep him company while he waited for Pansy to come downstairs.
"You don't have to. I think I know."
"I'll just go send this note, shall I?"
"Oh forgive me, Potter, my closest confidante, for not telling you every thought that crosses my mind," said Malfoy, pressing a hand to his chest.
didn't. She thinks you're only being nice to
"Nark," said Ginny.
He was surprisingly warm.
"In what way, Potter? Whenever we get bored of shouting at each other, we revert to snogging?"
"Deal," said Harry, smiling. He pushed down a thought that Malfoy looked cute when flustered, but did not ignore the accompanying urge to kiss him. Malfoy seemed surprised, but he did not immediately object, and after a moment he pulled Harry possessively close.
Draco shook his head, strangely childlike.
Harry was pretty sure that was how you
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry I didn't believe you."
"Oh?" said Pansy, eyes flashing. "And you'd know what he wants, would you, since you are such
"Very, thank you," said Luna, glancing at her vaguely before looking back to her meal. Pansy, to Harry's pleasure, looked visibly annoyed.
"I used to be an illustrator," said Shev, not looking up from her work. "My husband was a botanist. He wrote books about plants and I illustrated them. When he died I just… needed a change. I couldn't stop drawing flowers, I was a bit obsessed, but I became obsessed with skulls as well. The juxtaposition of it, you know? Life and death."
"Almost certainly," said Ginny grimly. Harry sighed.
It seemed to Harry, however, that Malfoy didn't entirely
"Oh, quite a bit," he said, faux-casual.
The group, it turned out, was not half as bad as he thought it was going to be. The Community Centre reminded him painfully of his old primary school, with its pockmarked polystyrene ceiling and blinking fluorescent lights. The group room was laid out as a circle of moulded plastic chairs, with cheap vinyl tables pushed back against the walls.
"I thought everyone could." He shrugged one pale shoulder. "I can feel it. Maybe it's just me."
"Not entirely," he muttered.
Hermione nodded.
Hermione's smile was gentle.
"You wouldn't," sneered Malfoy. "I can run faster than you. Unless you
about stuff like this?"
"Then how?" Harry breathed. Draco's eyes flicked to the distant space behind Harry's head. He was so close, lashes glittering in the lamplight.
"She's got a boyfriend," he said.
Harry stared at him. "I'm lost. Do you want to tell me or not?"
At the other end, beside the window, two plump grey armchairs faced each other around a coffee table, surrounded by modern, casually stacked half-shelves of yet more books. There was a spider plant cascading over the top of one, strange glittering objects decorating the others. There was something that looked a lot like a pensieve on one shelf.
"You don't have to hold on for long," said Seamus, squeezing his arm. "Soon you'll be too busy pursuing academia to work for Blott."
"What would you know about comedowns?" Malfoy demanded, glaring at him.
"Harry has to go now," said Andromeda, to Teddy. "Say 'thank you for a lovely time with my trains, Harry'."
"Well," he said, smiling uncomfortably. "Who am I to judge? I don't think I'm reading from the same manual as anyone else, either."
"I hope you've got the
Draco shifted next to him, face lighting up.
"Don't be sorry, Dean," said Harry, "I'll see you later, alright?"
Dean came back about ten minutes later, a funny expression on his face.
Ginny lent me some foundation before the party. I didn't give it back. Much as I deserve to stare at it for the rest of my days, sometimes I'm too much of a coward."
He ladled out a soup and handed it to Harry. Harry wrapped his hands around the steaming cup. They stared at each other for a long moment.
"What a guy," agreed Ginny, who was an absolute menace.
"You know that was... just an advert, right? I mean, muggles can't make anything that makes girls jump you. And if they could it would be
They walked to the nearby park, the November chill nipping at Harry's ears even through his hair, making him wish he had a hat. Hermione didn't speak, and so Harry didn't either, until they settled down on a bench and she gave him a long, anxious look.
"Come on then, Potter. Let's hear it. How you like me really now that I'm a

"I think it's a fashion statement," he observed.

"I bet he did," said Harry dryly. It sort of hurt to think about Snape; a tangled mess of pain and resentment and pity and the knowledge that they were not

imagined the tension. That was a comfort, he supposed.
"’Scuse me," Seamus grunted, looking green, and dashed for the loo.
Harry desperately wanted fo fix it.
"I'm not perfect, you should know that by now," he said, unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice. "I'm grumpy, I say the wrong thing. I don't have any manners. I'm a bit weird, and I have panic attacks about stuff that should be easy. I'm a mess."
would have a day that was honest and good. He caught Malfoy's eye and something flickered in Malfoy's face, fearful and uncertain, his smile turning down at one corner. Harry stared at him, uncomfortably aware of his body, the way he could feel his heartbeat pulsing in his fresh tattoo.
"Hi," said Harry, running a hand through his hair. The man looked up at him, gave him an obvious once-over, and grinned.
Malfoy snorted.
"Oh, Harry," said Hermione. "I'm sorry."
He gave Harry an entirely unnerving look up and down. Harry cast a shifty glance back at the painting, but the men looked very involved now, firelight shining off their sweat-drenched skin...
"Malfoy," he said, low. "Nobody here pays rent."
"Honestly, Harry, you
Harry sighed.
to mean travel and adventure, Hermione had instead taken a part-time research position at the wizarding section of the British Library, and kept her journey of self-discovery limited to bringing home books with titles like
"You're the one in the drawing room."
The door opened; Hermione was on the other side.
"Trains," she translated. "He's absolutely obsessed with them. He's got toy dragons, toy Hippogriffs, little Quidditch figures that actually fly, toy blocks, picture books that sing a song… but no, what he loves right now is his plastic Muggle train set. Just like his grandfather."
"Malfoy's got a visitor," said Seamus, as though that explained it, which was infuriating.
"And how do you feel about it now?" asked Neville, voice hard.
"Nothing fancy today," said Harry. "Although it does have thyme from the garden in it."
"It happens," said Ron. "We all mess up. It doesn't have to keep happening, though, if you learn from it." A pause. "Besides, I'll eat my broom if you were the only one being a dick tonight."
It was hard to imagine Malfoy Manor as a home to anyone, but he supposed Draco had been happy there. Flying in the grounds, bumping into helicopters, losing himself in expensive toys, playing with friends.
Harry scrambled to his feet.
He started dishing up two bowls.
"Suck up?" said Neville. "That's what Slytherins do, right?"
you don't want the NA meetings list?"
"Honestly, you can say yes, I'm trying to prove a point to myself that I can survive the terrible ordeal of being teetotal in a group of drunks. Drink, Gryffindors, and spill your secrets so I may use them for blackmail material."
Have you got any idea how it feels to be here? Like this? In front of
"Maybe he doesn't want to be an advisor," snapped Harry.
Through Harry's ire, Harry caught a flash of fear in Draco's eyes, a second of soul-deep hopelessness that seemed to sap his fury from him. He relaxed slowly, eyes on Draco's face, which was twisted in bitter hate that seemed to fade into naked fear as Harry stared. Draco's eyes flicked to Harry's lips, and Harry realised how closely he was pressed to Draco even as Draco's jaw tilted up in defiance, bringing his sneering mouth closer.
Harry's laugh was wet with tears.
appreciate you bringing this to me. Have you got any
. It made Harry feel strange, exciting; like Sirius was there with him, eighteen and drunk too, kicking his feet and sticking two fingers up at his family.
"Draco's actually been a pretty good friend to me, for a smack'ead," he said. "It'll take more than that I think."
and to ask her whether the rumours were true about the girls' showers. Hermione tensed, ready to defend Ginny, but Ginny clearly found this hilarious rather than insulting, happy to parry back. Ron patted Hermione on the shoulder, sympathetic, and tried to smother his laugh when Pansy said something outrageous.
"Great," said Malfoy, sounding tired. "Which one is the bathroom?"
Harry actually hated Pansy, she was just no good at all.
"Great. Sounds like a good plan. Will these places stop helping you if you have somewhere to stay for a bit?"
that was, that
"So now I'm sharing a house with a bunch of artists, poets and general layabouts," he continued, waving the ladle. "I
have humoured a few rants about how much I hated you and how you were terrible in every conceivable way," he said, not looking Harry in the eye.
"Okay, here, you'll need to lie down," she said. There was the sound of Malfoy's bed creaking, and Harry held his breath for a long, agonising moment before Malfoy said,
spelled out in flashing green glitter. Bursting from the unused fireplace itself was an impressive floral arrangement, orange flowers nestled amongst broad ferns and greenery, and Harry noticed there were garden roses tucked into all the vases and curio boxes scattered around the room.
"Get off him, you little slut!"
"As if I'd give a wastrel like that the time of day," said Malfoy. "Did you see the rips in his jeans?"
"God forbid I ever get the chance to play some garage," said Dean.
"You don't — " he said, hand on the door handle. "We don't — I just want to talk."
"Well," said Harry, shrugging, "You're going to need a headquarters for your magic CD empire, aren't you?"
Harry tried to engage the chattier folk in a way that didn't seem like he was trying to sell them something. He didn't manage to give anyone a leaflet. Within an hour he was exhausted, Malfoy hadn't turned up, and the clothing box had nothing but a particularly hideous cardigan left. Harry leant against the van for a moment, taking a deep breath, twisting his necklace.
bastard."
"Malfoy has a visitor," whispered Harry, rubbing his hand through his hair. "I got curious."
"Um," said Malfoy after a moment. "Is it just me, or do these lyrics sound rude?"
everyone moves out. Not that I want them to. I mean, I'd be pretty happy if it was like this forever."
Watching her, still upside-down himself, he felt an unexpected pang of nostalgic longing to touch her sweat-damp skin. He slumped down on the grass beside her afterwards, wondering about what it meant, reflecting that perhaps he was, in fact, Quidditch-player-sexual. He thought of Cho, hair flying in the wind, and Oliver Wood. Victor Krum, whose appeal Disapparated when he was on the ground. And Cedric… he could think of Cedric now without it turning him to ice. Cedric Diggory smiling and winking as he helped him out with the egg. Cedric, fiercely handsome and kind in a way that had made fourteen-year-old Harry feel hot and self-conscious, heavy with something he hadn't known how to name.
They slipped down the stairs in silence, skirting past the bassline thumping through the dining room door and down the back stairs to the kitchen. Malfoy slumped on one worn wood chair, watching Harry as he filled the kettle and Summoned teacups. The faint sounds of partying filtered down from above, washing over Harry as he settled down opposite and sipped at his drink. Malfoy was avoiding his eye. Harry was unable to stop looking at him.
"It's… well, it's complicated. It's,
could get a say in this?" said Harry, although he had no intention of moving to intercept.
"Why?"
"Come on," he said, and Harry let himself be dragged back into the warren of market stalls, wondering if Malfoy found it as disorienting as Harry did. They spent less time poking around at every stall this time, although Malfoy lingered over a dragon-shaped incense burner, and Harry, on impulse, bought a tank top with 'party like it's 1999' written in neon letters.
"Excellent," she said. "Very well, I'll see you here at ten."
Harry looked at the money, turning the problem over in his mind, looking for a Malfoy-friendly angle on getting him to keep it.
"Have you seen the new roster for the Tutshill Tornados?" said Ginny to Ron, before Harry could get too uncomfortable at the compliment.
, he thought, blinking. Why couldn't he be tempted by someone
"About Malfoy?"
Draco didn't come back that day, or if he did, Harry didn't see him. They ordered Harry's favourite takeaway that night, and Luna told him that Draco was moving into a new place that night.
"You offering?" said Harry, amused. Malfoy snorted.
Ron dropped his head into his hands.
Malfoy snorted.
Malfoy watched him, apparently speechless for a moment, then sighed and scooped the money back towards himself.
"Oh!" said Harry. "Yeah, course."
me to catch you? It certainly took you a while to get rid of me this morning, and don't think I didn't feel –"
"Gotta have it's perks, though... I mean, you get to shag the hottest girl in our year."
"Merlin's bollocks, Potter, you're – well, let's just say you're looking in the wrong section." He gave Harry a contemplative look. "Here. Follow me."
. I'm just too much of a coward."
"Very well," he said. "And what would you like to talk about?"
"No judgement from me. Existing is hard." He slumped back against the bath. "Ow."
The alarm clock read ten in the morning. Harry yanked Ron's dressing gown on in a panic, stumbling out of the bedroom and looking across the corridor to see Luna in the drawing room, nodding and talking to someone out of view.
"Did you kill anyone?" he asked, voice cool and calm.
A few weeks after, Ron announced that he intended to accept an offer to join the Auror training program. Harry, who had been staring at the very same offer for a week, tossed a Knut for it.
"Well that plan would work a lot better if you didn't insist on saying it in front of Harry," said Malfoy, and then looked like he wanted to bite his tongue off. He put his head down, feigning focus on his task, but it was too late. Joy bubbled in Harry's chest; he slid up to Malfoy, smiling.
would do."
"Help!" begged Harry, fending said girlfriend off with a chair.
He went up to his dorm and crawled under the pillows, and refused to come out ever again.
"Oh, what the fuck would you know about it, Potter," he snarled, and Harry stared.
"Hi Hermione," he said. "You've got a bit of soot on you."
"Do you want to tell me?" said Harry.
him."
"Are you wearing that to Camden?" said Malfoy, eyeing his jogging bottoms. "Dean tells me it's a place for
"Sorry," he said, as Harry gulped at it. "It really does work."
Then Ginny resumed her speculation about Seekers, and Luna started a conversation about growing a catnip-like herb that would subdue exotic creatures with Neville, and Malfoy put his head down and ate his food in slow, careful movements, eyes flicking around like someone might snatch it away.
Harry was spared from forming a response by Dean, coming to kiss Seamus on the head.
Draco's eyes flicked briefly to Harry; Harry felt like his whole body ceased to exist, frozen in space.
"If you ask me," said Malfoy, voice a low purr, "There's only so much good
Harry shrugged.
"I'm sure it was for blackmail material," said Hermione airily, "But it's fun to tease."
Warming Charms cast, Harry slipped on the wellington boots beside the back door — he thought they were probably Neville's — and let Draco pull on his trainers. Grinning at the sight of the frosty grass, he pulled Draco across the lawn, dodging the scorch-mark evidence of last night's fireworks. Then he wrapped himself around Draco in the dawn light, lingering under the archway to the secret garden. The morning rays were shining on the dew-glittered ground. The branches of the apple trees were bare now, ready and waiting to grow new shoots.
It was just a symptom of being nineteen. It was nothing to worry about. He was just making up for lost time, thinking about things like who he fancied, something he'd never really had the mental energy to do in school — his other crushes had snuck up on him, often with some prompting from the object of said crush.
"I suppose there's no reason why not," said Ginny, when Seamus had resumed his position on the floor next to her. "Except for the fact that men —" Something flashed over her face and she bit her lip.
Harry smiled weakly.
"I can freehand you a lily if you take it now, my last appointment was a no-show. You can see Ellie's arms if you want a live example of my work. Show him the rose, babe."
Master who can be keeping his obligations."
"Got all the important people here, haven't we?" said Dean, grinning at him. Harry looked across the drawing room at his scattered friends, nibbling canapes and covered in glitter, and felt warm to the tips of his toes.
"It's a magical test."
"Right," he said. "Yes, well. Thanks. And much as this has been a delight, I'm not here to ruin your afternoon, I'll just —"
Harry grimaced. It hadn't really occurred to Harry that not all of Draco's ill health might be rooted in the last six months.
Harry wasn't sure whether two minutes had passed, or ten, but he was just about to bite the bullet and make another bid for escape when there was a knock at the door. Both of them jumped.
the idea that Malfoy might see him that way. Might want to grab him, and pull him close, and kiss —
Then Malfoy's face came back into view, and Harry looked away, catching the eye of a girl in a neon dress who gave them both a lingering look as she sashayed past. She winked.
"Well, you hadn't until you said sorry."
"God, no," said Malfoy fervently.
Draco looked at him, brow wrinkling for a second before he fully understood Harry's offer.
"You must be starving, it's nearly three," said Seamus.
"I do," said Draco, face suddenly serious. "Here, Potter, take over a minute."
He just wished… he wasn't sure what he wished, but it hurt.
The joviality slipped out of Malfoy's frame. Harry's insides curdled.
She pulled his arm a little closer to stare at it through the clingfilm, and Harry reflected that he was glad she was the first to see it. She'd do what she always did, and accept his mad decisions without questions or judgement. "Do you want a cup of tea? We have a hundred varieties, you know."
"Can't you ask anyone else?" said Malfoy eventually, but not unkindly.

"Malfoy.” Harry took a step forward into Malfoy’s space, watching his silver eyes go wide. Malfoy was taller, but he didn't look it now. "There is a difference between thinking and doing
"Erm, he – I –"
"Look…" said Dean, slowly. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but… I had this friend, right. In primary school. We sat next to each other every day. His father was an absolute dickhead. Banned me and Mike from talking to each other, so obviously we spoke in secret all the time. Then secondary school hit, and I went to Hogwarts, and Mike started hanging round with his psycho older brother and a bunch of fucking pricks who thought shouting the n-word at younger kids was the height of hilarity. When I came home for the summer and saw who he was hanging out with, I just… I cut him out. Never spoke to him again. He kind of tried to talk to me a couple of times when nobody was looking, but I just pretended he didn't exist. After a while I didn't even think about him. I only found out later that he failed his GCSEs, downed a bottle of vodka and then threw himself off the top of his apartment block."
"Nope," said Harry, grinning, and he tried on a pair of sunglasses shaped like stars over his glasses. Malfoy folded his arms and shook his head as though to say they didn't suit him, but his lips quirked, and Harry had to resist the urge to buy them just for that.
Malfoy, as he'd done every night since Luna asked, joined them for dinner. He looked well today. His polite conversation flashed with genuine pleasure. It was nice — it felt good. Even though Malfoy had decided he would always hate Harry, Harry knew he'd done a good thing. And he was sure the others wouldn't vote to kick him out now. They liked him, tentatively, and he seemed to like them.
"Well I'll be. Is that Draco?" said the man behind them. Harry turned and found himself looking at Fish, grinning like a mad thing with his hands in his tracksuit pockets.
than I am and how can I look that in the eye? How can I even contemplate that? Fuck, Potter, I wish you'd be a bit more horrible, just so I can
"Um…" he said, as though he couldn't quite believe Harry had asked. "My parents?"
"Yeah," said Ron darkly.
"How's little lord Malfoy been?" asked Seamus, scooping curry into his bowl. Harry shrugged.
"Right," said Ron, shoving him forward. "Scrub up."
"Tell us the play-by-play then," prompted Seamus, and Ginny settled down on the floor between him and Luna to tell the tale. Ron flopped down beside Harry.
with him. Because Malfoy wanted Harry to look after himself.
Malfoy put on an expression of nonchalance that was almost convincing.
Harry frowned, but at least that was a good explanation for why Malfoy was helping him. He followed Malfoy deep into the bookshelves, staying close to the light, and nearly bumped into him when he stopped abruptly.
Harry blinked.
"Oh, you know," he said. "Hot Quidditch players."
"Um," he said, very quietly. "I'll come back later."
"It's of no consequence to me either way," said Malfoy, not looking at him. Someone jostled him closer into Malfoy's side, barging his fresh tattoo, and Harry moved in close and didn't move away again. He leaned in, let himself appreciate the warmth of Malfoy's arm against him.
"No, it didn't," said Harry, trying not to think of being pressed up against a wall by Malfoy... of having Malfoy's tongue in his mouth...
want? You know… non-monogamy."
"Alright." Ron shrugged. "Right then, Thomas, let's see what you've got."
Malfoy's mouth stretched in a thin smile.
Malfoy let out a weak chuckle.
And then Shev was lifting the needle and wiping his arm, and it was done.

"Ta-da!" said Ginny, dropping Hermione's privacy screen to reveal Hermione's new dress — a strappy, low-cut, figure-hugging column of gold glitter. Harry loved her like a sister, but even he could admit she looked good.
"Not just women," said Harry, glancing nervously at the door to the boys' dorms. Ron stared.
"I've been here before, Potter," he snarled. "I'm not doing it again. You like it when I
"Merlin's balls it's cold, are you going to invite me in?"
at the moment, I thought about going to Bill's but then Luna is here, and I miss her, and besides, I don't know if Fleur has fully forgiven me for being such a cow to her and I don't really want to find out just yet. And there's a training pitch not far from here where they do amateur matches, and apparently sometimes there will be

"Oh, they have. In fucking
Not that Malfoy
"Hmm," said Harry. "That's not exactly what happened."
Malfoy plucked at his shirt sleeve self-consciously, eyeing the crowd.
"Probably not necessary," said Ron, giving Malfoy a reassuring grin. "We vote stay, right?"
"A noble goal," she said. "What does
"Brilliant," said Shev. "I'm glad. It'd take some colour on the leaves nicely, if you ever fancied it, but you'll have to book next time."
said that."
sorry. There aren't any flowers this time. Then the next time… there's just impatience.
"Yeah, course," he said. "As long as I know the guest list beforehand."
"Go on then, Potter," he murmured in his ear. "Look at that picture for five minutes and tell me you're not turned on."
"If we need a Bat Bogey Hex, the signal is three taps of the foot."
off… Harry, you're a good mate but nobody is
The man's previously animated face went suddenly hard.
"Fire plant leaf," said Neville, clapping him on the back as Harry spluttered. "They put the seeds in Pepper-Up. Guaranteed cure for lethargy and nausea. Can't help with the dehydration, but a glass of water will sort that out. Mind if I come in, Harry?"
Ginny didn't want to be anyone's, and he understood that.
"I don't hate you at all," said Harry.
"Vaguely," said Harry, who knew it was somewhere west of the main road. "We need to head that way. We can figure it out as we go."
Malfoy made a shifty move, and Harry looked over. Malfoy was shimmying a hand into the front pocket of his jeans, and Harry was hit by a bright hot flash of
But then Malfoy had downed his second drink and shoved the cup into Harry's unresisting hands. He wasn't quite looking at Harry; Harry set the cup on the drinks table and stared at it. For a deep, visceral moment, he
Harry covered his face with one hand.
Dean glanced at Luna, as though seeking back-up, but Luna was contemplating her fingernails. She looked up after a moment, surprised that attention was now on her.
"No," agreed Harry. "Yeah, no, I know that. But I'm bisexual. Well, I think. I don't think I work the same way as everyone else when it comes to this sort of thing so I'm not sure."
Fish threw up his hands, like he didn't believe it but wasn't about to start a fight over it. Fish, Harry supposed, would be in a position to know about addicts and honesty. Harry looked at the fresh pint in front of Fish, grimaced, and found himself pushing his own beer away.
"Clothes for everyone," said Harry, laughing. "What about you, Neville?"
mum's side. The Dursleys didn't like to acknowledge Petunia had any family. Me included."
And wasn't that a miraculous thought, Draco Malfoy nearly undone below him. Harry sat up, surveying the lithe body stretched in front of him like a dream. The slim chest still heaving, the sharp vee of his hips, the rosy cock still bobbing. The perfect hands, the slim pale forearms…
But Draco ignored him, tugging Pansy up and nearly pulling her over in the process.
"So I've heard," said Draco, looking down at his plate. Pansy shot Harry another inexplicable glare.
"It's from Pansy," he said, in the same tone as one might say
"Oh," said Harry. "Sorry Ron, what?"
Fish raised his eyebrows.
They trudged up the familiar route to Gryffindor tower and trudged up the stairs to their own not-so-familiar dorm rooms. There were seven beds in this room, a few more than Harry and Ron were used to. Dean was already there talking to their new classmates.
order by phone but we don't seem to have one," said Dean, "So I guess I'll just have to stick it in the post."
"I know you don't need it! But I'm offering anyway, because I want to make things better!"
"He has to do it on his own," agreed Luna.
"Really?" said Ginny, talking fast as though he might rescind the offer if she didn't keep speaking. "It's just, home is kind of
"Don't," he breathed. "Or maybe do. I'm not sure I can think straight with you on me."
Diagon Alley hit him like a wave of Christmas cheer, and Harry remembered what it was to be around so much
"Spit it out," said Seamus cheerfully.
to describe to you how different this is," said Malfoy. He cast a pointed look at the fluorescent lighting, and Harry laughed.
"It's not forever," said Malfoy, defensive. "I'm talking to Muggle organisations. I'll get a

"Not a thing," agreed Harry.
into a curse to fling the lasagne dish off the top shelf at bullet-speed.
Harry wanted to push Draco back against the drawing room door and kiss him senseless.
Harry barely registered him leaving.
"There are perks to visiting an Unplottable household," Blaise observed, nodding at Harry.
"I love you guys," he mumbled, into Hermione's shoulder. "I'm such a dick."
"I can't say I'd noticed," he said, with a smirk that was undercut by a shifty look at Ron — like maybe, actually, he had a bit.
Harry sighed. He'd not quite figured out how to solve the Owl Problem. Owls, apparently, thought Fidelius nothing but a charming illusion, and he couldn't put up owl-specific wards without blocking post in its entirety. He solved most problems by having an accountant for financial enquiries and a public address for fan mail — something it turned out Dumbledore had arranged for him a long time ago, and which had apparently amassed many Galleons in unpaid fees in the time since his death.
Malfoy turned and stormed away. Harry wanted to yell that he wouldn't want to anyway, but for some reason the words wouldn't come.
"Wait, no way Ginny's getting clothes and I'm not, gimme that catalogue," said Ron. Ginny chucked it at his head, but Ron caught it. "Hey 'Mione, how about this for you?"
"Excuse me," Harry saw him say, looking sickly in the pale green lights, and then he darted out of the room.
It had been pretty clear in the book, too.
New Year's Eve was better. They had a party at the house and invited all the Weasleys, though only George, Bill and Fleur accepted. Neville and Dean and Seamus came, too, and Neville brought Hannah Abbott as his date. They all ate takeaway Chinese and danced to the WWN, drunk and a little wild. Ginny kissed Harry at the countdown, and it was nice, it was something he missed, until it went on too long and then Ginny broke away with a hasty: "Harry, I can't, it would be easy but it would all be wrong, it would just be what we're
"You could eat with us first," said Hermione. For reasons that he couldn't quite explain, he avoided her eye.
be gloating.
for this...
him. They had an odd truce.
kind, the kind that made Malfoy's face heat. There was probably something horribly wrong with him, that he got such a kick out of it.
"Can I get you anything?" asked Harry, the question coming out rather more rough than he'd intended.
"I'm not looking to judge. I'd want to be out of my mind too. I don't even want to be in my own mind half the time. Come on, we're not going to murder you."
He hoped the common room was fairly empty, because he had a feeling he looked a bit ruffled.
"Um," said Harry. "Of course you can." He decided to leave off the 'you absolute prat'. Ron and he were still delicate. Not from Harry's side, but he knew Ron was still processing what it meant to be the one who'd left them.
"Oh, but I thought you had one," said Malfoy, flashing him a smirk as though they hadn't nearly fallen out. Nearly done something else. "Hippogriff chest tattoo, wasn't it? Or was it a Horntail?"
Harry winced.
"I believe Harry told you about the drug test?"
Harry, halfway through a mouthful of peas, nearly choked. Ginny snickered.
Professor," said Hermione.
Ron threw Harry's pillow at Dean.
Malfoy snorted.
"Right," said Seamus. "Time for tea then. Want one?"
"I don't know," said Draco, looking back to Harry with startlingly soft, open eyes. "I think people deserve safety. Love. Happiness. But I don't know if
kinky," he said, waggling his eyebrows significantly. "All that good behaviour's got to break some time."
"Which I wouldn't," said Harry, and Draco's eyebrows shot up.
"Right," echoed Neville, all awkwardness again. "That's all then. You can go."
"Yes?"
the case," he said. Hermione sighed.
"Ginny!" he choked out.
"Is that why you steal my hoodies?"
"I think that's an excuse," said Malfoy. "Besides, he smelled of pot. You're better off well away."
"Oh?" Harry asked, trying to keep the smile off his face.
Harry stared at Dean's face, serious and familiar. He watched the rhythm of his shoulders as they rose and fell in exaggerated breaths. He tried to hold back the tears, though his chest ached with them.
"My liege," he said sarcastically, and to his surprise Malfoy's eyes went wide at that, scarlet flooding his cheeks. Suddenly uncomfortable with a feeling he couldn't name, Harry busied himself pulling out his wand, wordlessly summoning the milk and cups.
Andromeda's smile turned down at one corner, bittersweet. Harry smiled back, though it hurt to do so.
the best thing since sliced bread?"
"I'm going to look at the CDs," said Malfoy, voice strangely cold. Harry glanced at him, confused, but then he was distracted by the shopkeeper pulling the records out from under his arm and carrying them to the till, where he slid them into a plastic bag.
"My primary residence is at number Twelve, Grimmauld Place." Harry gestured to the house.
"You could have asked her to join us," said Fish, emerging out of the shadow of a doorway with a grin on his face. Harry leant in, conspiratorially.
"Good plan," said Harry, but his brain had taken an abrupt change of tack.
"She doesn't like labels. She just likes people."
"I know what she said." Draco's whole body was cringing in, now, back to the haunted figure Harry knew well. "But she didn't — she wasn't even a Death Eater, it was all distant and irrelevant until the day it was right in front of her, and she was terrified. I know she wishes she could take it back."
The conversation moved onto which records to put on, which Harry watched without input, feeling bitter and pathetic. Somehow, though, the argument led to Dean promising to take Malfoy to trawl record shops in Camden.
for it," said Luna.
. And given he had some dark shit going on in his past, nightmares and that, I guess he took to whatever it was like a duck to water. We didn't see him at the pub for months, until he turned up looking like death, with a black eye cos they'd had a fight and Spider beat the shit out of him. He wanted to come back to live with us, but Spider turned up and did a whole grand apology. When Draco caved in, he took him away, and then came back later to tell us to keep our noses out of it, in none-too-friendly language."
that it actually
"Yes, well," said Draco, giving him a shifty, shy sort of smile. "You never know."
"Is this a Hermione thing?"
Cho, apparently, still had a thing for him, which Harry found a bit mysterious at that point considering he'd had time to reflect on just how generally useless he was when it came to romance. She asked him outside to talk, and she was so pretty, the lamplight shining off her hair in a soft halo, her body angled towards him, and it seemed at least half the party thought they might be a good idea. But Harry was too drunk to kiss someone, and if he hadn't been too drunk… he didn't want Cho. Something was missing there, some depth of connection Harry craved, that he already knew they didn't have.
"Just so we're clear," said Harry. "What do you think you know? Because you have been known to be too stupid."
moving in here," said Seamus.
Ginny snorted, freckles dancing as she wrinkled up her nose.
"Oh, you know each other?" said John.
After a moment, Hermione took pity on him.
"Foul for what? Not letting Worsley kick him in the shins?"
He'd have to talk to Draco again. But only after he'd had a healing charm, and possibly a strong drink.
you can stay here. Forever, if you'd like. Bring up a million babies here. Nothing would make me happier, so I can't imagine why you're being so weird about asking. You massive prats."
Harry decided to take Malfoy's newfound hostility as a sign of his improving health.
"Maybe you should shove it up his arse," agreed Seamus. "It's your body, Weasley, do what you like with it. You do know I was only teasing just now, right?"
bad at keeping stuff quiet around me. She was bursting to tell me what you talked about last night, but 'cause she couldn't she settled for hinting. I think she thinks I'm too stupid to get it."
He sat up and threw a hand out for the bowl. Harry came in, pulling the door closed with his foot, and sat down on the pouffe at the end of the bed. Malfoy crossed his long legs over the coverlet, and Harry passed him his pasta and then dug the fork into his own. Malfoy held the bowl at arm's length, staring at him.
"Can't," he lied. "Work in the morning. I hope you have a good night, though. And, um, stay safe."
"Alright."
"Well —" he said, and then stopped. "I —- look, it's the principle of the thing, that's what Gryffindors do, have stupid principles, would you just —"
Harry nodded.
"Out the way, snotface," said Ron from behind her. "I need to get to the drinks cabinet after the day I've had. Training on a Saturday? Should be criminal. Oooh, biscuits!"
"Blaise told him to charm everyone," he said. "And weirdly, I think it might be working."
Harry had heard this a surprising amount of times that night, including from people who were quite obviously carrying sleeping bags.
"I don't care about any of that nonsense," he growled. Hermione gave him a look.
Harry shook his head.
"I think so," Harry agreed. "He's good, isn't he?"
"What?" said Harry. "What about the House Magic?"
him, but I can't trust him and I don't want to be within ten feet of him."
"He's not our problem," echoed Dean. "And it's too much. Even if I forgave his stupid rat face I wouldn't suddenly be fine with sharing a bathroom with him."
Ron winced.
Harry had an epiphany.
"Urgh," groaned Malfoy. "Yes, unfortunately I do remember that. Maybe I need more brain juice."
"Slap me with a splintered ruler," crooned Seamus, doing an ungainly jive, and wiggled his eyebrows at Harry and Malfoy as they entered. Malfoy actually snorted.
McGonagall looked at him over her glasses.
, because you're all so much
Malfoy's eyes went wide.
Harry stared at Malfoy for a long moment, looking for the Black family in his profile. He saw Narcissa easily in his mouth and nose, but there was something about the eyes, the cheekbones, that weren't a million miles from Sirius's. He was more like Regulus, though, delicate and fey of bone structure, nothing gruff or rugged about him at all.
"Er, for disturbing you."
"Not at all," said Draco dryly. "I'll even pee in a cup if it makes you happy."
"It's wizards," said Harry eventually. "That's why I don't go out much. I mean, for a while just leaving the house was scary, but I don't mind Muggle London now. It's just the thought of… meeting anyone magical."
Hermione laid her head on his shoulder.
He'd remembered Malfoy would be in Potions.
"Woah there, mate," said Seamus, "Surely Potter would have
"Fine, if it's like that," said Harry, trying to think like a Slytherin, "I might as well use what I have against you now."
"It won't be ready yet," Malfoy observed.
"I don't think he
"You've never done that," she says. "It's one of the things I like so much about you."
"Uh-oh," said Harry, smirking at Dean, "I think we're about to be insulted again."
"Yeah, alright," said Harry, but was interrupted by a wide-eyed first year tapping him on the arm.
"Kind of makes sense, now I know," said Malfoy after a moment, smirking at him. It was a weak smirk, but it made hope flare in Harry's chest. "You're not brave, you're just suicidal."
"Oh yes. Speaking of unbeatable Seekers, that Krum, eh?" said Seamus, eyes flicking to Hermione.
"Oh," said Harry. Then, when Hermione remained stiff against him, he looked at her again.
"I guess," said Harry, shrugging, uncomfortably aware that he knew very little of Muggle music genres. "I do like Black Sabbath."
over someone like that, and it seemed unutterably cruel that the first person he'd been charmed by after escaping the clutches of Voldemort was another, pettier scumbag. He supposed that he really ought to find it funny, given what a horrible brat Malfoy had always been, but he didn't. He could only think of a skinny, pale boy in a bathroom, too terrified to know how to get out.
At first McGonagall was trying not to smile.
Harry looked between Ron's ageing Chudley Cannons jersey and his own ratty grey t-shirt, wishing dearly that he could just stay in his comfy loungewear and hide in the kitchen for the rest of the evening. Ron winked at him, like he understood where Harry's mind was.
"Hello, Draco," said Blaise, holding Draco back a bit. "You look… well."
"I'm sure it will," said Hermione, not sounding sure at all. "If not, you'll just have to hide in your dorm until Ron writes to George. We'll tell everyone you're sick."
, talking to Malfoy. A little uncomfortable, a little risky, like running through a briar patch, but not
A floorboard beside them creaked; Hermione was there, face gentle and serious.
"I rule my piano lessons with an iron fist," he agreed. "Now move over, Potter, so I can show you how a Master works."
"It was him," insisted Hermione. "I'd know him anywhere, and besides, he took one look at me and ran for it."
Harry didn't believe him anymore.
Harry looked at her, blushing and fierce with her hands clenched around her teacup, and laughed.
"Lot of excommunication in the Black family," Harry observed, from the doorway, and Malfoy jumped.
"D'you think it's weird?" said Harry, quietly.
Harry snorted, but slid obligingly out of the van anyway, and as someone new came up to the van to talk to Draco, Harry slipped away into the crowd.
A stray firework, late to the party, pulled them both out of their sleep a few hours later. Draco shot up, peeling Harry's arm from his bare chest with a wince. Harry rolled over to look at his bedside clock; it read three in the morning.
A long pause.
Harry gave her a suspicious glare. There was no way she could know anything — there was barely anything to
"Look, if I agree to maybe think about doing it again, will you shut up?"
Her eyelashes fluttered. Harry took a swig of his wine, partly to cover the pause while he decided what to say.
Dean made a noble attempt to hide his laughter in Seamus's shoulder.
aren't the same person, and we're going through a lot and I don't think it's the time to get all tangled up together. We need to sort ourselves out. And," she added, with a hint of spite, "You're quite a rubbish boyfriend."
"Shut up, Jack," said Andy, coming up behind him. Harry eyed him warily, but he didn't seem inclined to leap. "Where've you been all day, Harry?"
"Too right," said Dean. "Besides, Harry, you can trust an addict even less than you can trust a Malfoy. Why'd he spin you this sob story, anyway? Sure he doesn't just think you're a soft touch?"
"I still hate you, you know," murmured Malfoy.
"I haven't looked well since fifth year and you know it," he said, pulling back while still holding onto Blaise's upper arms, tone uncomfortable-posh again. "But you look amazing. Paperwork finally came through?"
Self-consciousness rose up at Malfoy's words. Harry's instinct for many years had been to hide his body as much as he hid every other part of himself — the Dursleys were indiscriminate about insults, happy to call him skinny, ugly and runty as much as they were to call him a horrible, malevolent freak. He'd realised, however, that he
Malfoy looked up at the smaller stairs up into the eaves bedrooms, brows drawn together.
it was bitter, a bit like Seamus's appletini but with everything good taken out.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, trying to stay awake. After his, uh – crisis – with Ginny, Hermione had ordered him to go read up on the facts of life, but this biology text wasn't at all useful – he had no idea why he'd need to know all these
"I mean it. It just doesn't seem to work that way for me," he said. "I know it's weird. I can notice when someone is particularly handsome or beautiful, it just doesn't really occur to me to think anything more than that until I
"I'm glad," admitted Harry, and Malfoy gave him another weird look over his meal. Harry sat there for another painful moment, and was just about to excuse himself when Malfoy set his bowl down.
And Malfoy had called him
"Er, Harry?" said Ritchie. "Thanks. For using that spray, I mean. I mean, if you hadn't, I wouldn't have... well, I would never have got up the courage to tell anyone, and..."
Ron and Hermione were waiting for him as he left the office.
Malfoy was filling the kettle when Harry arrived, silently, in the kitchen. Malfoy turned to put it on the stove, saw him, and jumped again.
"Easy for you to say," growled Draco. "You've already won."
"Alright, Kreacher. I give up. You can do the washing up. Thank you."
"Some time between five and six, I imagine. We'll have dinner at seven. You know, if you want some."
"Right," he said, addressing Harry again. "Got some Prince, The Police, and AC/DC here to add to your classics education. For newer music I've got Smashing Pumpkins, Mogwai, the White Stripes and Korn. Kind of an eclectic selection, but you're that kinda guy right? I reckon you'd like Queens of the Stone Age, too, but I only have it on CD. I can tell you a bit about the vibe of each album and you can decide, what do you reckon?"
, and what looked like a copy of a court document.
. Can't see why you would, unless you've found some porn or something –"
"I feel sad to leave you alone," said Luna, tossing her silky hair out of her face and blinking up at him. "You know, there's always a space for you at our table."
He put the map away after a minute. He picked up the basket, peered carefully around the door – then he slipped out and began a fast walk. He couldn't quite manage a run with his hands full of food, but he got up to a brisk jog before he heard the words he'd been dreading.
"Fine, fifty, and that's my final offer," he said. "And, sorry if this is a weird question, but what exactly is a smackhead?"
"Didn't work out," said Ginny. "Nobody knows why. Might have wanted too much money."
life."
"Oh no.” Dean watched the bathroom door as it slammed shut. "That can't be good."
He went inside in the afternoon and had a long, cool shower. The house was still and quiet, everyone asleep or out, so he walked down to the drawing room and put an album on the record player and half-reading Seamus's abandoned Quidditch annual. He was almost asleep when Seamus, bleary-eyed and still in pyjamas, poked his head around the drawing room door.
Chaser of all time, but he works well with the team and they're still on a winning streak so can't judge. But last month McConkey retired and they put the second-string Seeker Davies in his spot, but then Worsley got pregnant and her backup is far too green to play just yet, so somehow they managed to swipe Fleet off the Harpies."
Seamus hissed through his teeth.
"Anyone whose dream date is someone trapped between going home with them or sleeping on the streets
"Valentina, I love your dress," said Janine, and dashed over to give them both a kiss on the cheek. Harry watched her go, and started when Ginny handed him a cup of tea.
"Possibly," said Dean slowly, still staring at him. "It sort of depends why you're asking."
Ron, to his surprise, shrugged.
To emphasise the point, he flipped the pan. He'd really got the hang of making perfectly fine and even crêpes, every time. Malfoy watched him showing off in silence, without comment or mockery.
"Maybe I'm Malfoysexual," said Harry, then had a terrifying vision of himself in a clinch with the Malfoy father and shut his brain down on the idea.
Harry looked at Malfoy's profile, pale and stiff and beautiful in the autumn sunlight. There were spots of colour high on his cheeks, embarrassment lingering in his downturned mouth. He looked at the place where their arms pressed together, radiating warmth like a beacon.
Draco pulled himself up a little to look at Harry, quizzical. His blond hair fell all around them, blocking out the world beyond. The sound of explosions was distant now, a low rumble across the London skyline, mingling with the sound of the CD player.
Harry wordlessly cast a Cleaning Charm over his sticky hands, smirking. He ran his tongue over his wet lips, and Draco closed his eyes as though praying.
"Not bad," he conceded. "I've seen him sell out for much less. Alright, Potter, take me to whatever torture dungeon you're hoping to keep your new pet Death Eater."
, too good, and he was going to come any minute with that perfect hand wrapped around him and Malfoy's mouth on his and the long, lean heat of the body against him –
Seamus shrugged.
Draco unfurled the scroll and pulled it close-in to his face, eyes devouring it, and when he'd finished he set it in his lap and
"Yes, thanks," he said, squirming in the knowledge that he'd been nothing of the kind. Neville beamed, but then his grin slipped a little into embarrassment. Harry, who was now familiar with this expression, slumped into a chair and smiled up at Neville.
"In this weather?" complained Draco, but he followed Harry to the back door. A cold breeze swept through the corridor as they opened it; Harry shivered and reached for his wand. Draco stopped him.
"Hi!" a middle-aged woman greeted him. She had a stature that reminded Harry of Mrs Weasley, but a fashion sense that was more like Celestina Warbeck's, wrapped as she was in a fur jacket, tight black dress and knee-high boots. Her hair was red, too, but it didn't look natural; it matched her lipstick. Harry found himself smiling at her, even through his tension.
"Or?" said Malfoy. The coffee seemed to have done him good already — he'd flushed a bit across the cheeks, his expression
Harry stared at him, mind temporarily blanked. Malfoy being
But he'd never had anyone to ask. Hermione had introduced him to the word
"I can't figure out the criteria," he said. "For what I like, I mean. For a while I genuinely thought I just fancy Quidditch players, but it's more — I dunno. People I trust. People I feel close to. I don't see handsome strangers and go all gooey, even the Veela just made me feel a bit fuzzy. I'd say I'm not sexual, but I definitely am. I don't know."
They'd lost so much. It was too much to lose.
Harry laughed, and shut the door.
Only he ended up coming into contact with Malfoy's mouth, and his own mouth was already open and it seemed the only way to win, to thrust his tongue through Draco's parted lips. Draco froze, but Harry won only a second's shock before Malfoy released Harry's wrists to hold Harry's head tight and begin his own assault with lips and tongue and teeth. Harry was hotly aware of the rapid beating of his heart; he groaned and caught Malfoy's lip between his teeth, biting almost too hard before Malfoy's tongue thrust its way into Harry's mouth with fierce determination.
"Harry, dammit, how are you always so quiet? I didn't mean you either, you know."
Pansy stared at him.
"And to be clear," said Ron, "It
"You sound like Seamus," he said.
Then the front door slammed, followed by the sounds of Dean making his way up the stairs. He entered the room by kicking the door with his foot; he was levitating a collection of plastic bags in front of him.
"Oh, well. Of course you did. He had his eyes all over you, barely noticed I existed."
"You're absolutely right," he agreed, getting up. "As always."
Harry tried it on, as promised, and then went to look at himself in the mirror in the hallway. A sharper, paler version of his father looked back at him, a bit scruffy with a few days' growth of beard. His hair was longer than Sirius's, and beginning to look more orderly now that the weight of it had overcome the messy curl. The necklace looked… cool. Like something Bill would wear. Or Sirius, maybe.
"Harry…" he said. "I'm really sorry."
"Er," he said, staring as Dean and Seamus disentangled themselves and sat up, both glaring. "Yes, well. I wanted to talk to Thomas. Dean. Dean Thomas. Well, all of you actually, but Dean first. If you're not busy, that is. You all look like you're having fun, I should go — "
The clouds came over at around half past two, and by three o'clock the sky was thick with wet, heavy raindrops. Harry pulled himself back indoors with a sigh, and was using his t-shirt to dry his hair off in the hallway when the front door opened and Malfoy walked in, bedraggled and miserable. He jumped when he spotted Harry.
"He was thinking that it would be hilarious," said Ron. "Which it is. A little bit."
"Take a seat. Do you mind if I draw on you? You can tell me if you like the look and placement, then we'll get started."
Harry was going to kill George.
It was driving Harry a bit mad, and he didn't even really understand why.
"Did Molly tell you he said his first word?" asked Andromeda, after a moment.
Further down the street, he slipped into the warrens of the Christmas Market and bought an exotic silk pillowcase, a new bed designed for large Crups, an expensive cleaning potion, and a mug that said 'World's Best House-Elf' for Kreacher. Then he bought out half a sweet stall for Ron, and an array of expensive chocolate boxes for everyone else he could think of except Seamus and Dean — he planned to buy them the expensive Muggle trainers they'd admired the other week.
The day of the revote, Harry woke up irritable from dreams of Malfoy running away from him, tear-stained and pale, fleeing as though Harry were the next Dark Lord. He dragged himself down the stairs and wasn't surprised to spot Malfoy himself in the drawing room doorway, like a spectre designed specifically to haunt him.
Malfoy sighed, melodramatically, staring at Harry's outstretched hand.
"No! Yes — look, this giving to Gryffindors rather than exploiting them for all they've got is not my
"Yeah," said Harry. "And it's not like he could get magical intervention without admitting that he took drugs and therefore broke Muggle law."
"Alright," said Harry, raising his hands. "It wasn't an insult. You're allowed to enjoy nice things."
Harry's smirk slipped a little, but Dean's face registered sharp pain. Ginny wasn't looking him in the eye.
" said Ron, scandalised.
Unfortunately, the morning intervened.
" sneered Draco. "Call yourself a Slytherin, man? You wouldn't know Slytherin loyalty if it hit you in the face."
"Not in the ways you should have been, no," said Dean, suddenly serious. "I guess when we were thinking about girls, you were thinking about Dark Lords."
"Oh," said Harry. "Okay. Well, I won't tell. Gonna tell me about the changing room thing?"
Harry slammed Draco against the bookcase.
"Why not?"
" said Malfoy, lip curling up in delight.
Bowing to the champion as she was cheered by her audience, Harry attempted to slip out again, but was waylaid by a beaming Luna. She pulled him into a dancing circle, spinning under his arm, making it easy to follow her lead. Harry felt fuzzy from the beer, letting Luna pull him into a space between one of Seamus's work friends and Terry Boot. Angelina flashed him a bright grin beside them as she wrapped her hands around George and rocked her hips. Terry seemed surprisingly at ease, throwing shapes with his long limbs as though he did this often.
"Not in the way you think."
Harry shifted his head to look at Draco's arch expression.
"Good," echoed Adhikari. "Do you mind if I make notes?"
," she said, showing a page to Luna. "Do you think I'd look good in this one?" Luna's eyes went very wide, which seemed like a yes to Harry.
"Are you joking?" Harry let out a dark laugh. "Mostly, I was a kid with no sense of my own mortality, and I had help at every turn. And even so, I'm only
Malfoy looked at him, panic flashing in his eyes. Luna patted him gently on the arm.
"Don't bother," she said. "He needs new clothes, and I've been dying to give him a makeover for years. Honestly Harry, it's not normal that all your t-shirts are four sizes too big."
Ginny rolled her eyes, before focusing her gaze on Harry.
"Shut up." Harry prodded the top of the cafetière.
"Hello, Harry. I heard you were restoring your old house. I wondered if I might stay over a while."
"Urgh," he said, wrinkling his red nose. "Can't you tell your lot to use more salt?"
"Sounds good," said Ginny, disregarding the kitchen chairs in favour of sitting on his favourite spot on the counter. She watched him make the tea in silence, unusually patient, and when he sat down at the table she hopped down to sit next to him, on his level.
Draco pulled a dubious face, presumably at the idea of a newly sober Fish living above a pub, but he quickly smothered it.
"Me? Ha! You're too proud to admit you're only doing all this because you want to fuck me," muttered Malfoy. His grey eyes sparked, dared him to deny it.
" Hermione exclaimed, pitch now alarmingly high. Ron threw his head back and laughed.
Hermione's expression softened.
good, or I'm going to fall and it's going to
Harry shrugged. "Not my style.” Malfoy stared at him, as though expecting him to say something else, but Harry didn't really know what else to say.
He caught Harry's eye. Harry looked away, focused on his forkful of potato with a scowl, and forced himself to keep his eyes down for the rest of dinner.
"Harry!" John spotted him, waving. "We weren't expecting you tonight. Come on over!"
"I thought you liked manual labour?" Malfoy watched Harry settling onto the seat. "Honestly, Potter, I try to do nice things for you."
"You've got no idea what it was like, Pans," Draco interrupted. His stare was intense. "There isn't an inch of that place that isn't tainted. I can't even walk through the gates without — Pansy, I had to assist the Ministry

Ginny spelled the dining room into an impromptu gym for them, and worked him through drills until he was in danger of throwing up. Ginny let him stop, flopped beside him on the transfigured mat.
"That would be great," said Harry.
"Okay," said Harry. "I understand. I'm sorry if I've made you uncomfortable."
"Of course," agreed Malfoy, stiff. "I've been intending — well. I will be apologising."
Not that he cared. Seamus loved Dean and barely tolerated Malfoy, and besides, Dean had got a handle on his jealousy now. He encouraged Seamus to be who he was. So it was nothing to Harry, despite the prickle in his limbs.
Hermione said the same thing to Harry sometimes. Malfoy looked at him like he disagreed, but he closed his mouth.
your day? Cut the head off any giant snakes today?"
"I dunno about that, Dray, I'm not nobby like you."
Harry's insides squirmed.
Hermione snorted.
Harry stripped off his shirt to put the new one on, like Malfoy had, watching Malfoy carefully out of the corner of his eye. Malfoy went visibly red, staring intently at the floor. It zapped through him, that knowledge that Malfoy really might find him
"Go back to bed, Seamus," said Harry, and the sandy blond head disappeared. With the sunlight flashing on the closing window, it almost looked like the house winked, too.
Draco laughed contemptuously and leaned close, and Harry's mouth formed a silent gasp as Draco's lips came close to his own. Something hot shot through him, but Draco's lips simply dragged past his cheek, whispering in his ear.
He did know what despair felt like, though. And he knew
Malfoy stopped looking embarrassed and started looking endearingly confused. Harry hadn't realised just how readable Malfoy could be; it was a trait he appreciated in a person.
"I've sort of had other things on my mind," said Harry. "And I'm not reading into it. But it does make me wonder why you're so opposed to doing it again."
"What did you think?" she asked him, uncertain, on the walk home.
"Maybe someday." Harry cut Ron off before he could tell a story he'd heard
Neville murmured something to Malfoy, who raised his eyebrows and said something quiet and sharp in return, and then Neville laughed, and Malfoy's shoulders dropped imperceptibly.
"Oh good." Hermione took the bowl out of his hands. "Is the other one for Malfoy?"
A thought occurred to Harry.
"Oooh, I have
"She has nightmares every night, you know," said Harry quietly, after a moment.
"Merlin," said Malfoy. "Between this and the Dreamless Sleep comment…"
"Hush, Potter, you wouldn't understand," he said.
"Yeah, good job," said Ginny dryly, with a fragile smile at Dean. Something silent went between them — an apology maybe, Harry wasn't sure — but before the silence could get too awkward, Ginny tossed her head.
Malfoy looked at him then, eyebrows raised.
At that moment, the door to the drawing room opened and Ron stuck his head out.
"Good enough for me," he said. Adhikari smiled again, a little more warmly.
"Beer pong," shouted Seamus from the opposite end of the table, gesturing at the arrangement of cups. He was shirtless, and completely plastered in green glitter. Behind him, a six-foot drinks fountain pumped out waves of unsettlingly green punch.
"Yeah," said Harry. "Yeah, he's staying with me for a bit."
"I don't!" protested Harry. "And I don't want to!"
"It's… complicated," he gritted out. "Besides, you said yourself it's good for trauma. Cruciatus damage. That sort of thing."
"Oh my God," said Malfoy, looking utterly gleeful. "You
"I thought Mr Malfoy helped you in the war, Mr Potter?" said McGonagall. "I thought maybe he was 'not quite as much of an evil git' as you thought?"
"I have absolutely no idea," said Malfoy, catching him by the arm before he swayed into the wall. "Harry Potter has dragged me into a tattoo shop in Muggle London and now he's grinning at me like a drunk and I have absolutely no
"Well, I did a little," she said. "But I didn't know you'd love it, Harry."
"I dunno about wizard," said Harry. "Given that I used a wrench."
Seamus gave Harry an amused look.
"Well, yes," said Harry, tilting his chin up to grin at Malfoy, whose eyes flicked away from his onions to look at Harry in a quicksilver flash. "But I was having a panic attack at the time, and you're not a
The silence from behind him was a sure sign that Malfoy was not fully well yet. Harry resisted the urge to look over his shoulder, and busied himself with setting up the kitchen for more pancakes.
"Good grief, do you think it's too early to crack open the wine?" said Seamus.
Harry patted her sympathetically on the arm.
Harry grinned.
The plum pudding was deliciously sweet, and the atmosphere among the table softened as they ate. Pansy listened in dismay to Draco, Ron and Ginny debating Quidditch minutiae, and after a while began to tease Ginny about what it was like to

"You're worse than Snape," said Harry, laughing at the expression on Draco's face, which melted into badly concealed amusement.
"Ah," said Harry.
me. And he had a reputation for being a bit dangerous, but so do I, and he wasn't like that with me. He was charming. He bought me drinks. He got drunk with me after a shift and told me stories about his childhood, really sad stories, and I looked at him and thought, if he survived that and still has all this confidence, maybe I can survive."
Harry was aware he was flapping his mouth a little like a fish as he struggled for an explanation.
"Have you got any more?" said Malfoy, looking like he was trying not to seem too interested. Harry snorted.
"Probably up at the Lock," he said. "There are food stalls up that way, and cafes and such."
"It is, isn't it?" she said, looking at Malfoy, who nodded in agreement.
"Harry," said Malfoy. "I'm here. You're safe. It's okay. I'm here. Focus on your breath."
"Well," she said, "My — er, Grace recommended attending a support group for childhood trauma survivors. And I thought it was going to be a total mess but actually it's really good —"
Harry wondered who that would be. Harry knew that he was only in contact with Blaise, Pansy, and his mother, because the Fidelius Charm meant that Malfoy had been obliged to ask Harry to send out his address. Harry had sent Narcissa and Pansy polite notes, and had received replies. He hadn't read either of them yet.
"My t-shirt was wet." He held up the offending article. Malfoy slumped into a chair and put his face in his hands.
"Ah, shit," said Dean, scrubbing his hand over his face. Everyone turned to look at him.
And before Harry could say a word, Malfoy ran.
and Malfoy is now probably the least popular word in the world, right after
The dining table felt too big. Everyone was too far away to make it comfortable, and Harry had too many knives and forks in front of him. He wished he'd overridden Kreacher and insisted upon serving something simple in the kitchen. To steady his nerves, he took a swig of the
"They agreed I could have my
"Malfoy Manor has a lot of history," Draco conceded. "Not all of it bad. I just… don't know. I don't know whether I want to look after a manor. I don't know what I want to do with my life at all."
"Sounds like a lovely day."
"Just ask someone. Tourists get lost in London all the time."
"It's not funny," said Harry darkly.
"Oh," said Draco weakly. Then, "What's the catch?"
"I wasn't sure," he said, folding his arms. Then, when Harry looked skeptical, "I didn't do it as part of some heroic plan."
Draco sneered, head thrown back to stare at Harry down his nose.
"Aye," agreed Seamus, and Dean nodded, shrugging.
"He was drugging you," said Harry. He was cold all over with rage, almost afraid to speak for fear his fury would come out of him in a rush and scare Malfoy.
superior to anyone else, that's part of what we fought for, so who are we to judge?"
," said Harry, hand out, and his tube of lubricant shot out of the bedside drawer like a bullet. Harry dropped it, hand stinging; Draco laughed, and Harry decided to shut him up by kissing him.
"Neville, I love you, but please don't ever give me burning death leaves again," he said.
"Do you want to go flying?" he said, because he felt like he should at least try to pull them both out of it.
"What?" asked Harry, confused.
The shading was stunning, carefully arranged to make the flowers look as though they overlapped the skull and snake, rather than simply sitting beside it. She'd even taken advantage of the fading blackness of the Mark to add more depth to the skull itself, giving it cracks and flecks, a sense of blackened decay. The snake almost resembled a scorched outline of a snake now, rather than the writhing, living thing it used to be. Inside each eye socket was dark green now, filled with tiny purple-blue flowers. Harry ran a gentle finger over them.
Harry stared at him for a long moment.
Harry bit down on the inside of his mouth in a silent attempt to prevent his brain from finishing that thought.
"Great," said John, beaming. "So, your role tonight is mostly just to hand out clothes from the boxes and try to engage anyone you get a sense might want to. You might get a bit of hostility sometimes, but try to respond to it with calm. You'll also get people trying to take more than they need to try and flog it, and some of them will spin you a story about how their starving children at home need four pairs of shoes. And they'll be especially enthusiastic about it because you're new. Just be calm and firm, and call me over if you think something's getting out of hand. Similarly, if you see something that makes you uncomfortable or if someone shares something with you that makes you concerned for them, let me know." John paused to look directly at Harry, face serious. "That's an important one, Harry. You need to tell me if something doesn't feel
Harry folded his arms, annoyed he couldn't defend himself. It was perfectly normal to have complicated feelings about your only remaining nemesis. Wasn't it?
"Give it back, Malfoy," said Harry, with the voice he reserved for Dark Lords. Malfoy's sneer dropped a little, but he did not move.
"I don't blame you," said Harry gently. "But it'll get better."
Malfoy laughed.
Hermione gave him a look. Jack grinned and winked at her. Ron coughed significantly.
Then Malfoy did stop, or at least he moved his mouth to Harry's ear, and Harry found himself shivering a little as Malfoy murmured,
"Oh, shit, Dean," she said, cottoning on. "I didn't mean you."
The next day, Harry put on a white t-shirt, Sirius's turn-ups, and his dragonhide boots. He borrowed Luna's white scarf, and pulled on his leather jacket. He stole Dean's sunglasses from the telephone table in the hall, and tucked the map of London under his arm. Then he walked out of the door and walked south, and he didn't stop until he was on Charing Cross road.
"It doesn't have to hurt," said Harry. "Because I feel the same about you."
Ron's Chudley Cannons lunchbox sailed out of the pantry. Ron grinned at Harry, then frowned.
"Look, I'm sorry.” Harry forced himself to look up at Draco, who rolled his eyes at the words. Harry winced. "I was trying. I honestly don't hate her or anything, but it just wound me up how she wouldn't leave you alone — "
," said Harry. "Everyone does. Even Voldemort did, if he'd been a happy child maybe none of this would have happened. Misery is never the answer. Misery just creates more of itself. We deserve to be
"Elliot made it," repeated Harry. Draco gave him a sharp look. "Is that your sober friend? What's he like?"
"Yes, well, good. See you at dinner."
"Yes, you're right," she said. "I wonder if I've been listening to Molly a bit too much. She certainly thinks it's a phase. But wait — this is besides the point. You're bisexual! That's wonderful! Thank you for sharing this very personal and difficult moment with me, Harry, it means a lot to me and I'd like to reassure you that as your friend, I love and accept you for who you are."
"How could I forget, you kissed me," he said, in tones of great affront.
"Now, doubtless you will find the first step to playing terribly dull and un-Gryffindor, but do try to give it a chance before you attempt to mangle three blind mice. Scales."
It was always magical, Christmas at the Burrow, but Harry was privately rather happy to retreat to Grimmauld with Ron and Hermione, the morning of New Year's Eve. Their peace and quiet lasted approximately an hour before Dean, Seamus, Ginny and Luna all burst back through the drawing room Floo at once, demanding to know what was happening with the New Year's Eve party. Harry, lying over one sofa with an irrepressible grin, gestured vaguely at them to do whatever they wanted to the decor and then absconded downstairs to consult with Kreacher about party food.
good a mate. He's a Death Eater!"
"I'm sorry," she said, patting him on the knee. Harry looked at her face, soft and pitying, and tried not to be annoyed. It wasn't
"Probably," said Hermione tartly. "She's a horrible person."
"Not your strongest, but I'll let it slide given the circumstances," said Harry. "Alright. I'm going to leave you alone now."
"S'posed to be," said Kreacher, scowling and folding his arms. "S'posed to be an
"You and me both," said Harry. Draco turned his head to look at him. They were very close.
"I'm going to go and — write some letters," he said.
Harry, still doubled over with his eyes streaming, gestured vaguely down the hall. Neville headed in the direction of the kitchen, where he poured Harry a glass of water.
Hermione shrugged.
Ron shrugged. "Shirt it is."
Harry let out a heavy breath. His eyes followed Luna's nimble fingers as they stitched constellations onto his furniture with a mix of affection and despair. Perhaps romance wasn't really for him… perhaps friendship would be good enough.
"No problem, Harry," said Andromeda. "Please do call in again, any time, you're always welcome here. Teddy adores you, naturally."
"You're
"Ginny's not like that," reassured Harry.
"From the man on Diagon," he murmured, a faint smile playing across his lips. "Mother used to get me one of these every Christmas. I think I had every type, but this one was always my favourite."
Harry turned on his heel, looking for Ginny. He knew she'd probably have the perfect training regimen to get the tense, warm feeling out of his chest.
"Hey Malfoy," he said. "Remember to breathe."
"Hello, Mr Potter," she said in polite, clipped tones, further cementing her McGonagall-esque quality in Harry's eyes. "It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, come in."
"Oh, is

"You are correct," she said, mouth twitching. "Although I am quite sure
and scanning the back page.
Harry jerked out of his reverie. "What?"
"I won't be much good," he said, raking a hand through his hair. He didn't think he'd last one moment in the heat of Draco's body. Draco gave him a long look, mouth curving into that impossibly wicked smirk. And Harry had seen that mouth around him, in his own bedroom, had seen that smirk with the filthiest of promises attached — how could he ever look at it again?
"Yeah but mate, it's a four-poster. Worth the risk, if you know what I mean," Seamus waggled his eyebrows suggestively.

Luna gave him a kindly look. "He's gone out for coffee with a friend of mine. He has a lovely space in Camden I think would suit him very much."
Harry helped Kreacher with the washing up, and then he paced the kitchen for an hour afterwards, telling himself over and over to go to bed but not doing anything about it. Instead, he polished the kitchen table with Kreacher's secret recipe wax, comforted by the gleam of the wood, and pretended to himself he wasn't listening for the tell-tale click of Pansy's heels on the floorboards above them.
Harry weeded the vegetable beds by hand in the hot sun, and they sowed radishes and sugar snap peas. Neville, in ecstasy, drew him a plan for planting more throughout the year.
Wandlessly, Harry opened the door, holding the food out like an offering. Malfoy was lying on his front on the bed; he craned his neck to look up at him.

"Um," said Harry, blinking. "You know. Alcohol is a strong drug."
"Oh, shut up," said Harry, and pulled up a chair at the end of the table. "And you know I don't

"Please tell me you've chosen
Harry didn't want to question his version of reality. The idea felt like standing on the edge of a deep, dark pit.
"No rent," said Harry. "You can contribute to the housekeeping, though."
"Unlikely," said Malfoy scornfully, "Since that spot is clearly occupied by me."
"You're a dick, Harry Potter," he said, but he was smiling now, and Harry grinned and flopped sideways onto the grass again.
"I'm going to try on my skirt now," said Luna, pulling down her harem pants without any apparent hesitation.
Why couldn't he want something easy?
"I just offered you a place to stay because that's kind of what I do now," continued Harry. "I just… hang around my house making it nice and then I invite people who could do with a boost for a bit and they come and live with me and stop me being a terrible bore. It makes me feel like I'm doing something with the big stupid house I have, and it makes me feel less alone and yeah, maybe it's an incredibly self-indulgent thing to do, but there we are. And I guess my eventual plan is for me to… keep helping people, but more seriously, maybe start a charity, turn Grimmauld into a real hostel, I dunno, haven't figured it out yet — but for now I'm just trying to help my friends get on their feet. Call it a trial run."
"Do you ever wish you weren't weird?" said Harry, and immediately wanted to punch himself in the face. Luna, to her credit, just gave him a slow, gentle smile.
"Alright. Harry, I think you might want to take a thorough shower," she said.
Harry sighed again, staring at the bubbles in the sink as though they held the secret to escaping his inevitable embarrassment.
Draco sneered.
"So can you ask her to dial it down a bit?"

but I'm not, I'm a piece of work."
"Of course he doesn't," snapped Draco, "Because
Harry grimaced at the memory of all those people who had never believed him. Who hadn't even entertained the possibility that Harry Potter was anything but fine. Draco caught the expression, turning his head to face Harry again.
"I mean," said Hermione, "You have too much power. Malfoy would have every possible incentive to say things he doesn't mean. Let you cross boundaries he doesn't want you to cross. If you got closer to him and then found you didn't really like him, he'd lose everything he has. He's very vulnerable, and you wanting to take care of him is only healthy if he can
"School friends," said Harry. Janine looked intrigued.
"Better," said Harry, thinking of Malfoy. "I feel like… I'm coming out of a fog."
"Seamus, don't, he might believe you," complained Dean.
Ron nodded and scrabbled in his case for a quill and parchment.
"And you're sure this wasn't the desired effect?"
"Ginny takes him charity shopping," said Ron, who'd been watching Harry watch Malfoy. "She's a menace."
"God," said Harry, cutting her off before it got awkward. "Do you think in fifty years there will be a bunch of wizards who don't even remember the War running around wishing Voldemort won?"
"So who is it?" said Neville, raising his eyebrows.
Harry heaved a breath against Malfoy's chest. Malfoy blinked at him, shoulders still defensive, mouth downturned.
"Afternoon, chaps!" said Ginny, leaning against the drawing room door frame, still sweat-slicked and in her Quidditch uniform. "Good day? You'll all be delighted to hear that I
"You could put something on that doesn't make me want to die," said Seamus. "Put on Alanis Morissette."
"Maybe if you figure out what
"Don't fall under his spell, Pans," said Draco, giving Harry a flickering glance of approval. "He's actually a terrible bore. He seems to enjoy cleaning things by hand far more than is natural."
That Christmas, however, was a strange and uneasy affair. First, they lost Luna for a few weeks, as she went to stay with her father; Harry missed the sight of her quietly writing
"I think this might be a Red Topic," said Luna, startling everyone into silence.
Hermione, face soft, swept forward to place the back of her hand on his forehead. Behind her, Ron raised an eyebrow, as though he were surprised such a smart woman could believe Harry actually left because he had a headache.
"I'm shattered," he said. "I'm going to sleep."
"How kind of you to offer, Harry," said Blaise blandly, as though she hadn't noticed. "Perhaps some tea."
"I'm not going to be your sex slave," said Harry, laughing.
Autumn came, and with it a quieter house. Ron started training, and Hermione took up volunteering to fill the gaps he left in her life. Ginny was offered a job assisting a Quidditch tutor who ran classes at the pitch. Harry wasn't entirely sure what Luna did, but she was often out and about during the day. A new term at Hogwarts had started, so they no longer saw Dean, Seamus, Cho, Neville or Hannah at the pub. The silent days would please Harry one day, and leave him aching and lonely the next. Hermione suggested visiting Hogsmeade, but the thought made Harry's stomach flip.
"Agreed," said Ginny.
Draco slammed into him again, pinning him hard against the wall, nails biting into Harry's shoulders.
sure this was just Malfoy being weird with him and not a confession of his true feelings.
Harry knew he was being tested.
Then he
Hermione gave him a peck on the cheek and headed off in the direction of a large bush. Harry waited until he heard the familiar crack of Apparition, then before he crossed over to the lamp post.
"Quite a lot of money at an Indian restaurant and fifty quid cash."
And it turned out he was very good at beer pong. He beat Seamus, Dean and Ron — who had forgotten his promise for 'just a quick look' — and was only narrowly beaten by Ginny, who ought to have been able to manage victory easily, but was clearly distracted by Alicia Spinnet's hand on her waist.
"Yeah?"
Ron grinned, a wide flash of teeth.
, said his brain, but he ignored it. "Getting to the point where I'm gonna have to decide what I want to do with it. You know, when everyone's moved out.
about it.
"Ooh, look at this," said Ginny. "Yves Saint Laurent jumper, bottle green. Which is the number you need, Dean?"
, like this. To know you know how weak I really am."
"Ahh, sweet karma," said Seamus, grinning.
Harry also watched as he left for his first day working for the Muggles. He left the house grey and rigid; he came back on heavy feet, but flushed and triumphant.
"Madame Malkin's does," said Neville, who was a little red in the face from his attempt to prevent himself from laughing. "But you'll have a hard time buying Muggle clothes there. She's trying but they're just a bit
Janine presided over the meeting. There were ground rules, and introductions, and then a blonde woman in a designer blouse began the sharing circle by telling them, matter-of-factly, that she'd been to her abuser's funeral, and how she still didn't know how she felt about it. And then less matter-of-factly, that her husband had lost it and punched her complicit uncle, nearly knocking him into the grave, and that she'd laughed herself sick in the car on the way home. Elsie, beside her, snickered into her hand.
"Thank you for your hospitality," she said, equally tense. "And for taking care of my friend."
"That's right," she agreed.
"Are you going to come to the soup run tomorrow?" asked Hermione, interrupting his reverie.
They were still at their task when Hermione swept into the kitchen, looking disapprovingly at Ron's pre-dinner sandwich and then stealing it out of his hand with a wink.
I did. I think I was just… scared."
Now Harry could almost

Malfoy shot him a glare.
"Yeah. Me too."
"Well, yeah, he wasn't thrilled," said Harry.
"I do," said Harry. Another shoulder barge, and Harry was left alone with his thoughts.
her down the stairs and tell the world it was an accident."
"Ah, looks like Marjorie could do with a hand. I'll just…"
"I just did," said Harry dryly.
Ron and Hermione found him at lunch. He was hiding in the boy's dorm – Ritchie was mercifully gone – and he leapt up with his broom in one hand and wand ready in the other.
Draco looked at the cloak, then up at Harry again. He looked as though he might be sick as he held it out.
"How's it looking?" said Ron, through a mouthful of tuna mayo.
"I don't want –" Harry began, and then took a deep breath. "That's not why I'm trying to help you."
"That's very understandable, and something I would deeply wish to avoid doing. It is my fervent desire that every client who steps through my doors is treated to the absolute best of my ability, regardless of their circumstances. I only raise it because it would be dishonest to ignore it, and I have a feeling you take as dim a view of dishonesty as I do."
Draco clutched at his hips, encouraging him into a steady rhythm, and Harry could only think about the pounding of his pulse in his body. He looked down, and the sight of himself vanishing into Draco made him stutter; he shifted position, lifting Draco's hips, and Draco made a desperate sound. He thrust a little harder, watching Draco's tensed limbs for the twitch that let him know he was doing something good. Draco was muttering curse words into the air, one hand sliding to grasp his hardening cock; the sight of Draco's balls drawing tighter brought Harry close, too close. He jerked, unable to do much more but hold onto Draco's hips and make shallow thrusts before he was dragged, unwilling, over the edge. He came, and it felt like infinity, a spark of lust up his legs and throbbing, pulsing through and out of him.
"Well, there's this potion based on Amortentia – it smells nice, like you did, and... never mind. I've always wanted to use it, and it seemed a bit more sensible than a deodorant that gets you suffocated by a dogpile of girls. Should have known you'd never use
Malfoy bucked into Harry's grasping hand, and came between their bodies with a spasm that tipped Harry over the edge. He moaned, all objections forgotten as heat and pressure pulled him over into ecstasy.
"Potter," he said eventually. "Do you make it a habit of not wearing clothes?"
"What was?"
," he sang along, out of tune, and Ron laughed.
"Absolutely," said Luna.
Seamus raised an eyebrow at Harry, apparently picking up on the subtext as well, and then broke the tension by suggesting a game of Go Fish. Malfoy, to Harry's surprise, tentatively agreed, and it was painfully awkward at first, the long silences and careful politeness saved only by the background music and Seamus's occasional humming along.
"Or the other way around," agreed Harry, and Draco's smile became a notch less cocky.
"Wait, what do you tell a
Harry felt his brain fill with white noise. His hands clenched around his coffee cup.
Hermione's expression froze at whatever Ron showed her.
"What are you gonna do, Potter?"
," he said. "Have you any idea how you look right now?"
"Big words from someone who did three times as much and made it look easy," said Malfoy, not meeting his eye.
"Great," he breathed, "Come on."
Harry repressed his grin and followed Kreacher obediently down the stairs.
Harry was about to protest against Slughorn's tone, but Draco looked at him and hissed,
"Ooh, you look rough Harry, heavy night?" he said, by way of greeting. "Hang on, chew this."
Harry flopped on his bed, and considered never coming out again.
laughed this time.
, wanted to touch Draco, wanted to surrender to the hands on his chest, or fight until he could press against Malfoy and do what he pleased.
"Alright," said Harry. He put his thumb on the C key. "I trust you." He played the scale. Malfoy's expression bloomed into a smile that took all the wind out of Harry's chest.
"Well, that was nice," said Malfoy eventually, looking up at him. "Now let's never talk about it again."
"Look, I'm a forgiving sort of bloke," he said, "But that one isn't going to keep me up at night."
"You know the paparazzi will have a field day," he was saying, over his shoulder. "Dumping Potter and then flying with his mortal enemy on a public pitch. We'll be accused of having a torrid affair. Probably I'm dosing you with a love potion, as I'm such an agent of evil."
, either?
"Right! Time for proper introductions," said John, proffering a hand and shaking enthusiastically when Harry took it. "I'm John, volunteer coordinator for this run. Our church does several routes in the local area and this is mine. Do you think you'll be able to commit to a regular day? Continuity matters a lot when you're trying to create a rapport with people. A lot of the people we meet here don't have a lot of trust, and even less interest in hearing how we can help them beyond soup."
"If I have the time," said Ginny casually, and then hugged him.
Harry interrupted this with another kiss.
"Yes," he said.
"Yeah, heard that before," said Fish. "Look, you seem alright, but I'm not going to tell any stranger anyone else's business. Most of those who come here are avoiding someone or other who means us harm and for all I know
"Do you like pancakes?" asked Harry. Malfoy shrugged.
"Or alternatively," he said, voice sounding very strange, "We could skip breakfast and stay right here."
"Alright," said Draco, in a strangled voice. Relief burst through Harry's chest.
catalogue," said Dean, shrugging. "Dunno if it's any good, I can't remember the last time I bought something Muggle that wasn't from JJB Sports." He plucked at his football t-shirt.
"One of my housemates. Can't figure him out. He's got the face of a sixty year old and the body of a twenty-year-old, and he has a habit of sitting around in his pants all day like he's not in the company of six other people at all times. Nice enough though."
But that skirted uncomfortably close to thinking of Dumbledore, and his role in both their lives, and Harry tried not to focus on that too much.
She was staring at Ginny, and her eyes were very wide. Harry raised his eyebrows. So he hadn't been imagining
Harry and Draco looked back up to the house, in unison. Seamus was hanging out of the third-floor window, hair ruffled and grin wide. Draco's muscles tensed under Harry's palm; Harry reached down and squeezed his hand. He squinted up at Seamus, shaking his head. Dean stuck his head out, beside him, saw Harry and Draco on the lawn, and rolled his eyes.
He had a feeling he'd be doing a lot more from now on.

"Are you okay?" said Ginny, looking at Harry. "We heard shouting."
. Quite aside from the fact that he pulls your pigtails at every opportunity, why
"Dare you to buy it," said Harry.
"Not really," said Harry. "Can't believe he's still teaching. He's meant to be

"Did you really think about becoming an Auror?" Draco murmured, after a while.
Harry looked at her, then over at Ron, lounging on a beanbag and smiling gently at them both. He wondered what they would do if they weren't worried about him. Whether they would have moved out, found their own place. Started talking about the big things — children, marriage, a family together.
. The air smelled of cinnamon and sounded like Christmas bells. Everlasting icicles hung from every corner. A stand was decanting roast chestnuts to customers by itself; someone tried to take an extra one off the coals, and took a chestnut to the forehead for their trouble. As Harry watched, a young boy in front of him dropped a cup of mulled juice on the cobbles; his mother flicked the drink back into the cup with a wave of her wand, tutting. Further down, a wizard in a large top hat demonstrated a flock of flying dragon toys to an audience of starry-eyed children.
"Alright?" said Harry, holding out a bowl, looking curiously at the sliver of dressing room behind her shoulder. It looked a little messy, but Harry couldn't see what she was up to.
Malfoy was striding into the dungeons when Harry caught up. He heard Harry following, and spun to meet him.
and Harry stared through heavy-lidded eyes at the wicked curve of Malfoy's smirk.
Malfoy was beginning to look less grey now. He flushed the toilet, then pulled the loo roll closer to wipe his mouth, nose wrinkling.
"I hardly think I'm in a position to shmooze," said Malfoy. "I'd rather just get out."
"Ah, excellent!" John gave Harry a grin. He had kind eyes that reminded Harry a little of Hagrid, if Hagrid were five foot tall. "You must be Harry. We've got you down for distributing clothing donations today. Everyone's decided to give us their winter clothes all at once! Must be this good weather we're having. If you just bear with me, Harry, I'll do your orientation in just a second."

"I can't see how he couldn't, unless he happens to sleep with jam in his ears. My cousin used to, apparently it keeps the Floobards at bay, but I always thought it wasn't worth it for the flies…"
"Right," mocked Malfoy, slumping back onto the sofa.
Draco pressed his forehead against Harry's.

Well, he could think of one person.
"And he can't stay forever," said Neville. "A month. Then if we haven't murdered him and fed him to the roses, we can vote again."
things. Ginny set up an appointment with a Mind Healer after the trauma pamphlets; Luna was now attending an embroidery club after a stack of leaflets clearly targeted at getting Harry to leave the house.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, hovering behind her by the stairs. He was looking at Dean, clearly disappointed.

Harry was uncomfortably aware that his face was hot. He was fairly sure nobody would notice, but
"What did you think it was?"
"Would you believe," said Draco brightly, "My delight of a probation officer swears to me that she definitely did her part six months ago and that I should starve just a little longer."
Harry didn't know why she'd called it now, but she was looking at him. He looked down to see that the knuckles of his right hand were white around his fork, his left palm pressed against his necklace in a subconscious gesture. He took a deep breath, letting his hands drop.
