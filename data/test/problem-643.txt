'I tortured people,' Malfoy said lowly. 'I'm not good like your precious Gryffindors. You still exist in this fantasy world where I'm nice
'Well, a Death Eater,' she suggests, her gaze fixed coolly upon him.  'Snape does have the location of Grimmauld Place, I told you that when we came.  You could be Snape himself.  One of Malfoy's friends, maybe.  Voldemort.'
After Harry assures Hermione that he is not interested in any first years, and certainly not Gabrielle, he escapes to the house, mumbling an excuse about finding Ron.  While Ron is nowhere to be found, Harry rather likes the relative quiet he finds, as opposed to the raucous party Charlie and the twins are cultivating in the back yard.  He is standing there, appreciating the calm, when he hears quiet voices drift out the window.
“What do you think Malfoy was doing here?” Ginny hissed in a low voice, once the door had shut behind Moody, Tonks, and Malfoy. “Do you think he’s a spy?”
For some reason, the idea of weekly letters made something around Harry’s heart seize up, and he had to glance away quickly. “I’m sorry,” he said, again.
'How?' Harry demanded. 'He's still stuck-up, and awful, and he laughs at other people all the time!'
“Seamus was one of the first ones to die,” Ron told him. He sounded a bit strangled. “I didn’t see it, but he and Ginny and Dean had just been in Honeydukes, they were eating Fizzing Whizbees—Seamus floated up higher than the rest of them, and the next thing they knew, he was—he was—"
“My father was ten times the wizard yours ever could be,” Harry said, fast, and it was only then that he realized that he’d leapt to his feet, forgetting his vow to not let Malfoy provoke him. “Worms wouldn’t
'Nearly impossible now that the war's begun.  It used to take between three and four weeks for personalized Portkeys, but now the waiting list is months long.  Scrimgeour wants the Ministry to look into each query personally.  Besides, this isn't the sort of thing we want the Ministry knowing about, is it?'
Sometimes Harry wonders if there is an afterlife, and another him is enjoying some angelic heaven or being tormented for war crimes in the depths of a fiery hell. It seems strange to think of, since this consciousness is the only one he has. It worries Harry that there is another him out there, as much as it distracted him to think of a thousand photographs and portraits lingering when he was gone. He wonders sometimes what would happen if there were other portraits of him: would they think the same thoughts, be the same people, or what? He doesn't want twenty thousand Boys Who Lived populating the wizarding world in pictures pasted everywhere.
'Five years in prison, then,' Harry snapped. 'Come on, it isn't that difficult, you already said you saw my point, you can intervene! You can demand a re-trial, it's why I came to you, I know you have—' What was it Hermione had said? 'You've got the Chief Warlock in your pocket—'
“And how I could hex Malfoy,” Ron added. “Ask her if she’ll let me hex Malfoy. For a demonstration, of course.”
Dumbledore coughed serenely and straightened, smiling at Harry as if nothing at all was going on. “Excuse me,” he said politely to the portraits surrounding him. “We shall continue this scintillating discussion in a moment. Now, Harry, what a surprise. Tea?”
'You slapped him,' Harry pointed out, though a second later he remembered that Hermione had been all of thirteen at the time.
'Boils are worse than dancing!' Harry exclaims, despite the fact that he would have disagreed wholeheartedly with this statement during the Yule Ball.
“Not funny,” he muttered, busy getting out their ingredients for the day. “I couldn’t sleep, that’s all.”
He knelt down on the floor and began unfolding the map, its familiar corners, the worn creases from years of use. As the parchment was spread out, Hogwarts' walls and staircases unfurled before them, footsteps appearing room by room. Malfoy could not keep the eagerness off his face as he stared down at the map.
He had never stopped to consider how his best friend might react, were he to find out that Harry liked blokes and was having it off with the worst of them, since it had never been an option Harry had considered. He was not sure how he, himself, would have reacted, faced with a similar admission.
When he finally got to the door, Harry was breathing hard; his stomach felt like it was deflating, curling in on itself. The witch's words were ringing in his ears.
'I'm,' she said. 'I can't sleep sometimes, thinking about it. I didn't want you to die, I just thought. My friends were in danger, I was scared, we were all scared, and if it came down to the people I loved or some—some near stranger who was never once nice to anyone I knew—'
Malfoy is waiting when he returns; Harry gives a nod to the Aurors who've transported him and then turns to Malfoy.  The other boy is standing by the cliff, arms wrapped around himself, shivering from the cold; his hands are bone-white and it seems, for an instant, as if the wind will blow him over.
'What choice?' Malfoy sneered. He had obviously been expecting this from the minute Harry set foot in the Manor, and it was like striking a pool of oil with a match. 'I'm telling you, Potter, I hadn't got
'The arrogance of wand-carriers!' Griphook hissed. 'Assuming that they know best how all things can be used, even the magic which they do not possess! The enslavement of house-elves . . . thieving goblin-made treasure . . .'
"Personal, social, and health eduction," Hermione said, pushing past Ron so she could get to the corkscrew, which didn't seem a bad idea to Harry, all things considered. "Seemed like a good idea to spread information rather than misinformation."
"So much," Draco said. "Which is why I have to do this. I've spent nine months knowing this is the right thing to do. I can't just change my mind because I'm weak."
"You're lucky I love you," Harry says, and Draco holds out his hand for Harry to take. "Agonies, what on earth."
"I'd be on the guest list," she sniffs. "Hey, Harry, why don't we take some pictures of Draco reclining on his bed. That's the kind of thing underwear models do, isn't it?"
Draco looked like he might bolt. Harry just kept holding his hand out, trying not to let his terror show on his face.
"There we are, what," Hermione said. "Are you honestly telling me that that was the last conversation you had about your impending fatherhood? Three weeks ago?"
"Take my picture, Potts," Draco says, and Harry, for want of something better to do with his life, does.
"Haven't you ever read, I don't know, anything?" she spluttered, whilst Ron sat in the armchair by the fire and shook his head a lot. He was grinning, although this was more to do with Hermione's exasperation being directed towards someone who wasn't him than the situation in general, which didn't offer too much in the good news stakes.
"Perhaps," Harry agreed. "So, do you want to go out and have pizza, then? If we do, we don't have to talk about anything else important at all."
"She won't get me just one book," Harry said. "And she'll tell me I'm an idiot for not getting a book before today."
In the kitchen, the microwave pinged. Harry turned around and went back in there to get his dinner out. It was hot and he almost dropped it. He put it on the side, gave it a stir, and then re-covered it so it could sit for a minute.
"Because I can't. Because me wanting him doesn't change the truth. I'll be bad for him. My name will be bad for him. It's not like people want me around now."
"I've made some life-changing errors in my time," Draco said, without removing himself from Harry's doorstep, "but it's possible that this might be the worst yet. Go to the fucking library, Potter, and see what a fucking mess we've made of our lives, and then come and find me so I can tell you how stupid you are and we can talk about what the hell we're going to do next."
When Hermione and Ron came over, he kept the nursery door closed, and when Draco came over to keep him updated about his appointments with his healer, Harry kept meaning to tell him, but he never quite found the right moment.
Even now, when Draco was with him, when he was safe, even now when Draco was so tired he couldn't keep his eyes open and his fingers shook around his cup of tea, when Harry had to cut his food up because he couldn't hold a knife steady, Harry kept thinking about Draco's room.
"They're metaphysical," he says finally. I'm not entirely certain that's in anyway related to what I might have asked, but as I've forgotten the question, I feel somewhat validated by the answer.
Harry gave in to temptation and leaned in to kiss Draco's forehead. It wasn't something they'd done when one of them wasn't overflowing with emotions that they didn't seem to have the capacity to deal with, so they stared at each other for a moment, before Draco blushed and turned his attention back to their baby.
He'd found them himself, he told Harry, late one night when they were curled into each on the sofa, where the tattooed snake that wrapped itself around Draco's wrist slipped around Harry's wrist, entwining itself with Harry's snake. He'd found them on a little stall at a jumble sale, and he'd had enough of an idea of Muggle money by then to hand over a couple of quid and take them home. Two tiny, ridiculous figurines that were all he had after a lifetime of having everything that he'd ever wanted.
"Yes, I know about hormones," Ron said, "I'm not an idiot. I'm just amazed Draco Malfoy can demonstrate any kind of emotion other than gigantic fuckwit. Sorry, Harry, I know you had sex with him once."
"Do you like it?" he asked, once he'd opened the door and turned the lamps on and Draco could see the green walls and trailing greenery frieze, and all the flat pack furniture he'd put together with all the baby clothes and blankets he'd bought in preparation to meet their son. "I made sure it had a view over the garden."
"We will get one," Hermione said, bundling Harry towards the door. "We will get one, just so you can sleep in it. We might get one now, just so you can test it out. Go and speak to Draco, Harry, and don't come back until you've sorted this."
"Aren't you worried there won't be any room for you anymore?" Ron asked, when Draco came in from the market with Sheila and deposited a paper bag on the table in front of Harry with a small glossy ornament of an otter on a grassy bank inside. Narcissa was coming over for lunch later. Hermione was outside in the garden, putting up a bird table with Tommy.
"I had everything and I was unhappy," Draco said. "I was so fucking unhappy. I have nothing to give him. I'll just teach him how to be a bully and how to take and how to not be able to figure out what the right fucking thing to do is."
"So," Ron said, when they'd found a spare ten minutes to go to the bakery and get a pasty each and call it lunch, "how's things?"
"Harry," Draco said, and he was crying, and Harry couldn't get the door open quick enough. "Harry, I can't do this."
"Don't know what Hermione's talking about, we're not emotionally illiterate," Draco said. "We've just made a life plan."
Harry didn't know why he did it, but he reached over and wrapped his hand around Draco's, squeezing, and Draco didn't pull away.
"It'll make her day," Harry said, tugging him in for another kiss. "Thanks for making our revenge plans smaller and making us articulate a feeling."
"In here," Draco called back. He was in the living room with Ron, where they were talking in general terms about the possibility of maybe at some point in the future possibly playing a game of chess together. Luckily it wasn't just Harry who was shit at relationship building.
"Not that you fell on his dick," Ron went on. "More like the other way around, given the, you know, baby, and everything."
Harry stomped his way inside. He hadn't had much sleep. He had no idea what to say. Feelings were rubbish. "Draco!"
"No," Hermione said. "Because you are an idiot, and you still won't flipping admit you're in love with him."
"Maybe your wards need adjusting," Harry said, looking at a point somewhere over Draco's left shoulder, just for kicks.
"Hello," Harry said, because it may possibly have escaped his notice that he was supposed to have cooked for Ron and Hermione tonight. He poked around in his head for ideas. "I thought we could get a takeaway?"
"Of course he does," Harry Potts says. He turns to me, and immediately contradicts himself. "Draco's parents didn't approve of popular music."
"You said," Ron said, and by mutual, silent consent, they walked down to the river and dried off a bench so they could sit and watch the rubbish float by and pretend it was nature. "But, like, you know. The rest of it."
Pansy raises an eyebrow in Harry's general direction. Harry busies himself misting the leaves of his rubber plant. He's not sure if it needs misting, but it keeps him busy.
Harry was very, very aware of how responsible he was for the baby Draco was carrying, and at the same time, a little bit pissed off that no one had every bothered fucking telling him the ins and outs of what it meant to fuck a man in the wizarding world.
Hermione sat down next to him, and very firmly removed Jonny from Harry's arms. "I want a cuddle," she said. "And you need a shower. He'll be fine for twenty minutes. Have a shower. And you need to leave the house. You can't sit here and wait for Draco to ring the doorbell."
"I'm mostly clear on how babies are made normally," Harry said. "I was lacking some of the finer points of detail regarding the power of the fucking moon."
"Great," Draco says, and then throws his phone at Harry, who catches it one-handed, without much thought. Draco's undoing his robe. "Will you take some pictures of this?"
Harry kept thinking about Draco, quiet and still in his high-backed chair, saying he wouldn't subject a child to the childhood he'd had. "Yeah," he said, after a while.
"I know," Harry said, although he knew fucking nothing about this other than what he'd read in his book. He could have asked Molly, but he hadn't known how. He didn't have anyone else. He'd always been fucking alone when it came to finding out how the world worked. It never seemed like that was going to change. He kissed Draco's temple. "I'm sorry."
"There's probably not a chapter specifically about cheese, which will hopefully give you your answer about whether it's okay to feed your baby it—"
"What if you didn't? What if I didn't make him into my childhood? What if we just let him be him? What if he was just happy?"
We let him keep the Levis. I look back as we walk away. He's holding hands with Harry Potts. I don't know if that answers a question or just asks another one. He's a calculated enigma. I take a picture on my phone, and walk away.
"It's fine," Draco said. "I've made my decision, and now it's up to you to make yours. Will you bring this child up? If not, I'll speak to my solicitor about the adoption process."
"Um," Hermione said, cracking open the wine and turning the bottle straight upside down to decant furiously into a jug. Someone had once told her this was the equivalent of letting it breathe, and as Harry had no fucking idea whether it was or not, she continued to do it every time they met for dinner, and Harry proffered no alternative opinion, although this time Draco did wince. "But aren't they going to notice when the two of you pop up with a baby?"
"You didn't know that pregnancy was a risk?" Draco asked, once Harry had been to the library, marinaded in his own fear and horror for a day or so, and then shown up on Draco's doorstep looking faintly green. "Are you an idiot?"
"Deserved that, didn't I?" he said, cradling him. Jonny blinked at him with wide eyes. Babies this little weren't supposed to be able to focus, but Jonny kept staring at him very intensely, which reminded Harry a little of how Draco used to stare at him across the Great Hall every mealtime, so quite frankly he was very clearly theirs. He leaned in close and stuck his tongue out, and after a moment, Jonny's tongue peeked out too. "Such a clever boy."
"A book about babies," he said. "And how to look after them, probably. When you can feed them cheese, that sort of thing."
Harry kept one hand on Draco's belly, and used his other to cup Draco's cheek. Draco's eyes were wet.
Then he went to sit in the nursery with their son, and fell asleep in the armchair with one of Jonny's blankets draped over him to keep out the cold.
"Old thing?" Hermione mouths at him, after Harry's failed to react in any way other than a general sense of pinkness around the gills. "Ginger beer? And what's with the, you know?"
It actually began in February, on a Thursday, on a night where Harry got so drunk he could barely see straight, and it just so happened that Draco was matching him drink for drink. They weren't friends; they weren't anything, they were just both in same place at the same time and in the mood to snipe at each other all evening because there wasn't anything better to do. Then the pub had closed. They'd stood outside in the street in the rain, and Harry had said,
Draco ends up taking the package from the postman and Harry ends up signing for it, which is par for the course given that Draco refuses to touch the electronic signing-for device.
. He stares into the middle distance. For a moment, I'm entranced by his cheekbones and forget I've asked him a question. Have I asked him a question? I wait, regardless, for an answer.
"We have a window box." This from his flatmate/assistant, Harry Potts, who features in the majority of Malfoy's Instagram stories, and pops up fairly regularly on TikTok, primarily as part of Malfoy's
"Come on, Harry. You can't ignore this. You're going to have to step up and look after your child sometimes," Hermione said, leaning over to tap him on the knee. "You need to start thinking about where they're going to sleep, what you need to buy to look after them, all that sort of stuff."
Later, when Draco didn't get better, and his exhaustion got worse and the shake in his fingertips got more pronounced, Harry found him others. A little badger with a pink nose, a labrador puppy, a sheepdog to add to his collection. Little animal figures that found their way onto the mantelpiece, whilst Draco's original two made it upstairs and onto his bedside table.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Our full moon error," he said. "Perhaps we should have this conversation when you're less… deshabille."
Harry leaned against the doorframe. He'd assumed that Draco would still be living at the manor with his parents, but one extremely awkward doorstep conversation later and Harry was instead at Draco's flat in Basingstoke. He was going to leave off warning Draco about the awkward follow up conversation where Draco's parents inquired exactly what Harry was doing looking for him for later, or perhaps never. Definitely never.
He went home with Jonny the following day, cradling him close and already fiercely in love. How was it that his heart could simultaneously feel like it was shattering, and growing exponentially to encompass everything he felt for his son?
Ron made a face. "Hold up. How do you think Charlie had Maja? Did you miss the part where he was pregnant?"
Ron opened his mouth to make the appropriate joke, but Hermione hit him with a cushion and Harry allowed himself permission to consider the joke made.
It does something queer to Harry's insides. He pops the feeling to one side, like always. Hand holding and protestations of flatmate affection aside, their relationship remains, as always, mostly on the friendship side of things. Draco shares his bed most nights, but that is, unfortunately, genuinely a case of him needing his photos edited and having actual cold feet because of his refusal to ever wear socks.
"Glad I've finally satisfied you." There was a moment's pause as they both stared at each other, and Harry contemplated the fact that there were three of them in the hallway and not just two. "You can hang your cloak up there. Would you like tea?"
"Uh-huh," Harry says, as Draco's dressing gown falls open and Harry has to do his level best not to swallow his tongue. It's really not fair that Draco's launched his own range of underwear, it's like he's done it on purpose just to mess with Harry's head.
"Hmmm," Harry says, since, underneath the moody glances into the middle distance and the obsession with lighting angles, Draco is the happiest he's ever been in his whole entire life. Harry's not entirely sure why he's the only one that can see it, although he supposes that no one else is here late at night when Draco curls into Harry's side with his phone in hand as he makes plans for upcoming content. It's almost like removing themselves from being force fed the impact of their own childhood trauma every day has been good for them emotionally; who knew.
Draco looked at him then. "We can't be," he said. "Because I can't walk away from another friend, Harry, and I've got to walk away from this. I have to. And I can't look back, so please don't ask me to."
"In just that? It's winter." Harry didn't know what to do, but Draco had to get warm, and he had to stop shaking. "Come on. Let's get you upstairs and into the bath."
Draco was gone when Harry went to check his bedroom after Jonny had fallen asleep again. The bed was made, but the extra blanket was gone, which made Harry hope that Draco was just downstairs.
Harry covered his face with his hands for a moment, and let out a breath. "Sit down," he said. "There's something i've got to tell you."
"Well you've fucked that right up the wall," Hermione said. She was bright red, which meant she was about to explode.
Harry's baby, though, Harry's baby was going to see nature from its window, and be able to play in the garden and wherever it wanted, and it was going to be perfect.
"I wasn't very nice to her. At least I wasn't the first two times. The third time she brought me breakfast and practically bustled her way inside."
Tommy hovered in the doorway, quiet. He held something in his hand, a tiny, bubble wrapped package. He patted it into Draco's palm. "For you, son," he said.
The mute part lasted approximately 2.5 seconds, and Harry wasn't going to lie, he wished it was longer.
"Definitely," Harry said. Hermione and Professor McGonagal had been leading the research into Draco's illness, into the complex magic that underpinned the dark mark and its mastery, and how it gained its power, and what Harry had missed when he'd offered Draco a new bond instead. "Hermione's the smartest person I've ever met."
"Think it might have been the bottle of firewhisky," Draco said, as the doorbell rang. He kissed Harry again, then straightened up and went over to answer the door.
He found himself in Mothercare on a Saturday morning, looking at tiny t-shirts and tiny skirts and tiny socks and tiny toys and small, baby-sized furniture.
"His first day of Hogwarts, there's just me and you looking in different directions, sure in the knowledge that we love each other and at some point it'll just happen by itself."
"What is happening," Ron says, almost without inflection. "What is happening, and why is it happening to me."
"I have no idea," Draco said, leaning past Harry to take his cloak off the hook and hang it up again, but tidier. "Didn't you?"
"I'm going to go abroad, I think," Draco said. They were eating cake in Draco's flat. He didn't like to come to Harry's anymore. Hadn't since the day Harry had shown him the nursery. "After the baby's born. The lease is almost up on this place, and it's not like Pansy's going to come back and be friends with me now, and I can't go home. So. Abroad."
"I think there's a space for that in the Hogwarts curriculum, you know," Ron said. "You could get on that, Hermione. We've only got about seventeen projects on the go, there's bound to be room for another one if we try."
I believe him when he says he's learning. The last year has passed impossibly fast, and Draco Malfoy has left no offered opportunity unexplored. Is it greed? Maybe. I ask him.
Hermione was getting a little red around the cheekbones, which did not bode well for any of them. "I had written a letter already," she said, "because PSHE is just as valid on a wizarding curriculum as a Muggle one. This just goes to show I'm right, and that I need to write another letter."
"Ronald," Hermione snapped. "I swear, if you ever knock me up like that, you're sleeping in the shed."
"Fair," Ron said, and went into the kitchen to clean up and - hopefully - make him and Harry tea. "Harry thinks you'll call him an idiot for some reason."
"Yes," Draco said, without going into any more detail. Ironically, detail would have been helpful, given that Harry was still at the very start of his learning curve about male pregnancy. "You're going to be a father."
Ron waited until they were far enough away from everyone that they could speak freely. Harry, ever mindful of beetles, cast a silencing charm anyway, just because he could.
"Well, she'll be right," Ron said, and opened the door so that Harry could come in. "Hermione," he called, "Harry's here and he needs a book recommendation."
Draco very carefully sat down in a neat armchair. "I know what I'm going to do," he said. He looked at Harry. "I'm going to have this baby. And then I am not going to bring this baby up."
Harry's heart wanted to break. "He's sleeping," he said. "It's all right. Come into the kitchen. I'll make us both a drink and you can get warm."
"Yes," Harry said. "I always thought it was a bit weird, him knocking somebody up, but you know, who am I to comment on other people's life choices?"
"Got it," Harry called back. He was flicking through. The first few pages showed the baby's growth in the parent's tummy at each month. He counted back to the night of the full moon, and hesitated over the
Harry was getting bits of flaky pastry all over his coat and his lap and his fingers. So was Ron, but pumpkin pasties tended to hold together a bit better than the cheese and onion ones, so his mess was less pronounced. "Do you think I could be a dad?"
"Harry always wears socks," Malfoy says, when I point this out to him. It is, perhaps, the only answer I'm going to get.
Draco came over and tilted Harry's chin up so he could kiss him. "If she's terrible, let's make her change Jonny's nappy."
"Are you ever going to tell me what you're doing in Basingstoke?" Harry asked, when Draco was 27 weeks pregnant and their baby was the size of a cauliflower. "Why you're living in a Muggle flat?"
Ron elbowed him back, but then he sighed. "Now's the bit where you get mad at me. I need you to tell Mum. You can't spring this on her in a couple of months when the baby's born and you're a part-time dad. She'll be gutted, mate. For a start you won't have given her any time to knit."
Harry - who for a moment had got distracted remembering the hot, drunken flush of that evening, of Draco with his head tipped back, sweat beading across his skin, lost in himself - blinked. "I was drunk," he said, because it was the only thing to be said.
"I wouldn't be good for him," Draco said. "I couldn't be. You know what I was like. It's the only thing I know. I can't— I can't be that to him. I can't ever do that to him. I'm giving him the only thing I know how to give him. I'm giving him up."
Ron stopped by for lunch, bringing Harry a cheese and onion pasty, and a pumpkin pasty for himself. "Come on," he said. "Rain's stopped. You can find half an hour for a bit of lunch."
He couldn't remember ever walking out of Hermione and Ron's before, but there always had to be a first time.
"I will," Harry said, and he finished his cheese and onion pasty and watched the rubbish float by in the canal, and wished things were just a little bit different.
Draco frowned. "Is it possible," he said carefully, "that you don't have a clue what I'm talking about?"
"I could murder a curry," Ron said, plucking the wine out of Harry's grip and heading for the kitchen.
"Not like this," Harry said, because Draco had starved himself of magic for months and months before Harry had found him, and the dark mark still had its power. It needed magic to function, and so Draco had starved himself of it, but it still hadn't given in.
Pansy, when she came in, was dressed in very spiky high heeled shoes, and the kind of tight business dress that could quite clearly market a lot of dwellings in Basingstoke.
Draco looked at him then, eyes wide and wet. "I want my son," he said. "I can't have him and I want him so badly. Please, please don't let me see him. I can't bear to leave him again."
"I'm working," Harry said, putting down his tea cup. Draco has tea cups. Harry has mugs. Why he was round at Draco's was a question he doesn't want to think about too much, but he'd finished the nursery and he sort of wanted to tell
"Who knows," Harry said, which probably wasn't very helpful, but then he was sitting back and letting Pansy Parkinson, Estate Agent, into his home when practically the last time they'd seen each other she'd been all for shopping him to Voldemort. That said, he was riding the crest of a wave of newly co-habiting, new parent bliss and couldn't really be bothered to argue with anything that might make Draco happier. And Draco deserved friends, even ones who landed him with a black and chrome flat for a year and never came around for tea or to notice that he'd gone and got himself knocked up.
"Yes," Harry said. There was a baby here with them in the room, a tiny baby that might change everything. Harry could barely look after himself. How was he supposed to manage a baby? A tiny baby all of his own. He hesitated. "Don't— don't start the adoption process yet."
"Right," Hermione said. "I did buy one that I was going to give you, actually. It's in the bag on the table."
Hermione's hand was in the small of Draco's back. "Go on," she said. "It's all right. You won't hurt him. Promise."
"That was good of her," Harry said neutrally, resolving to rugby tackle Hermione to the ground next time he saw her, just so that she knew the extent of his gratitude.
Draco was in a jumper and trousers, a little loose around his stomach. Harry couldn't tell if that was baby or just the fit.
"There is no me and Draco," Harry says, which is something that could be approximately 36% true, on a bad day. He's watering the plants, in preparation for taking some pictures of Draco in his new underwear range. Pansy's just here because she - apparently - likes the aesthetic even if Draco doesn't do it for her. She's dating a banker who works 60 hour weeks, is heading for retirement, and already has a divorce and three children behind him; she can't think much of him but he has a nice bank account and, according to Draco, Pansy has already planned what she's going to do with her divorce settlement once they're finally married and she can do the decent thing and move on. If she can do it quickly enough, the exchange rate at Gringotts is set to make her a mint.
"I'm an Instagram star, Granger," Draco says. "And Potts here is my assistant-slash-flatmate. And now i have to be photographed being bathed by the early evening sunlight," Draco says, draping himself on the windowsill, ginger beer still in hand.
Harry came over and sat on the arm of the sofa, ignoring Draco's pained look. "You're not going anywhere, are you? You'll stay here, with us?"
"The Malfoy family is no place for a child," he said. "I cannot promise this child any future beyond the childhood I had. And I won't subject another child to that."
"We're not," Harry said, but Draco was already on his feet. Harry tried to pull him back into another hug, but Draco was already out the door and into the hall.
Their baby was about to be the size of a watermelon. Draco wasn't sleeping and his back hurt and he permanently looked like he was on the edge of tears. Harry had taken to going over in the evenings and putting the telly on so they could watch ridiculous mysteries and he could hold Draco's hand and pretend not to see him cry. Harry had never really imagined having a family of his own, beyond a nebulous, sort of cloudy future plan to be normal in a way he never had been growing up, but he wasn't entirely sure that a tearful, hormonal Draco Malfoy who refused to talk about anything but the TV had featured anywhere in his plans.
"Oh no," Draco says, biting his lip. "It's not that at all. They get your name wrong. You're the most famous wizard alive, and
"I read that it's the size of an orange. And that it has fingers and thumbs and it might be sucking its thumb right now."
Draco was putting the kettle on. He still walked with a stick, and his hands still shook, but he was alive, and he was home, and he was Harry's.
"Great idea," Draco said. "Although I do have some lingering questions about why you've brought me a mango."
"No," Harry said. "I don't think I'd ever for one second considered what it would be like to leave him there and walk away. For him to say
"Oh my god," Harry said, and went into Draco's living room to sit down heavily on a black and chrome sofa and look suitably pained at the idea of never having eaten pizza.
Harry pulled him inside and out of the cold. It was freezing outside, and Draco was barely dressed for it, shivering in his cloak even as Harry wrapped the blanket around his shoulders and pulled him into a hug. "It's okay," he said. "It's okay, Draco."
Harry, who was learning how to do bookkeeping in an evening class at the local adult education centre, and who used Draco's shifts as an excuse to do his homework at the same time as carrying the coffees over to customers when Draco's hands shook too much for him to do it himself, tried to smile.
'Looking for the right girl, is that it?' Slughorn asked, giving Harry a pat on the shoulder. 'Smart, my boy, very smart. You won't be having any of those tabloid scandals, now will you? Dear Rita, of course, she does like a good story. A bit of a wild card, she is, but she always kept me up on the latest news.'
She looked at him with tears on her cheeks. 'Harry, we have been trying. I've been trying. And I think—' She faltered. 'I think you need to decide if you really want to be with me, because you aren't acting like it right now. And I need to sort out what I want. Because it isn't this.'
Harry watches stoically as the candles flicker in the dim light of the hall. He realizes, upon his detailed inspection in an effort to ignore Draco, that there are other portraits across the hall. He really has no curiosity as to the subjects. He finds that he doesn't care much about anything anymore.
'I saw some once,' Harry says.  He shivers, despite how far from that cold water he is now, how many months it has been since he led Dumbledore back over the rocks.  'A lot of them, really.'
“Happy birthday, mate!” Ron said, grinning, the moment Harry opened his eyes and yawned at the sun. He was sitting on his own bed, dressed and washed, flipping through an old Quidditch magazine. “Took you long enough, didn’t it? It’s nearly noon.”
fully committed to the Pureblood cause.  Being a Black, he must have been very close to the Dark Lord, probably a very valuable Death Eater.  And I'm sure he would never turn against Voldemort.  Unless he did.'
'Yeah,' Harry mutters, and instinctively, he reaches out and puts his hand on Aberforth's arm.  'I'm,' he says.  'I'm sorry.'
Harry had his hands in his pockets and suddenly felt very unprepared. “Malfoy,” he said, eventually, not looking at Malfoy, not looking anywhere but at his feet.
'No, I don't know,' Ginny was in the middle of saying, when she glanced again at his face and her eyes widened, and she said, 'Oh.
from Malfoy's wand spilled out into the Entrance Hall, and the light bounced off the hourglasses of points standing there. Slytherin was last, as it had the fewest students to receive points—and, Harry thought privately, because Malfoy incurred the wrath of one professor or another more often than not, despite his best sycophantic efforts—and Gryffindor next. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, to Harry's dismay, were neck and neck.
On some level, Harry couldn’t blame Draco; Harry, of all people, knew what it was like to be missing a father, and moreover, to feel stunned and betrayed to find out that his father wasn’t perfect. But everything Harry had said was true, and it chilled him to know that, despite all of Harry’s rationalizing to the contrary, Draco might still be the loyal son of whom Lucius could be proud.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and from the way Cho stared at him in surprise, he knew she knew just what he meant. “It was a mistake.”
Harry scarcely had time to question this when Dudley pointed behind him and, sure enough, there was Malfoy, coming towards him. Only, for some reason, he was wearing one of Ginny’s sundresses, and Harry stared at his bare legs, oddly muscular in the context of the yellow dress, and—
When he finished, he yanked a scrap piece of parchment out of his pocket, a very old and well-laundered receipt from who-knows-when, and said, 'A quill, Ron?'
, would be in bad credit?” Malfoy was hissing, one fist clenched at his side. “I told you to put it on my father’s bill, you simpleton, is that so difficult to understand?”
The look on Draco’s face at what he had just said was pure horror, and Remus had to take a swift sip to cover his growing smile. “To get back to what happened in Little Whinging,” Remus said, when he’d recovered. “Draco, you never cast an Unforgivable Curse on Harry Potter tonight?”
,” Harry said, feeling a surge of pity. Nevertheless, before Malfoy could snap out a curse in return, he threw out another hex, this time sending Malfoy crashing to the floor. He cast another in quick succession, just as Malfoy leapt to his feet.
"You can change your mind, you know," Harry said softly, half way through an episode of Midsomer Murders.
"Bit harsh," Harry said, eating a cheese and onion pasty. He'd started eating it whilst holding Jonny, but then he'd dropped crumbs on his head and Hermione had rolled her eyes and taken him for a fierce garden pace. "We're all right."
"Having a baby," Harry said. They were in the kitchen at the Burrow, two cups of tea on the table between them, the mixing dish hovering over the counter, mid-mix. "Well, I'm not. Somebody else is. But it's mine."
She smiled at him. "Proud of you," she said. "And not just because you're the reason Hogwarts finally has a PSHE curriculum."
There's a pause, as Draco records their exit for posterity, and then they leave, as one, for the park.
Harry elbowed him, and Ron elbowed him back, and by the time they'd headed back inside to work, Harry had managed to avoid making any decisions at all.
Harry nodded. Ron was staring at Draco's shelf of little dusted ornaments, his collection of tiny animals, all set out beautifully.
"Don't think I could have lasted much longer. All that hand holding and looking in different directions. We would still have been doing it when Jonny was at school."
"You wouldn't," Harry said, licking the remains of his cheese and onion pasty off his fingers. "Give me my baby."
"No," Harry said. "It was just on a list, you know, of things that I didn't know. When you could give them cheese. But I'm learning."
"You'd better," Draco said, and then he turned to face the window and he didn't look back, and Harry had no choice but to stand up with his baby, and leave.
"I realise we're doing this backwards, but that still doesn't mean you're privy to the ins and out of my personal life."
The healer tucked their baby into the crook of Harry's elbow instead. Red-faced and angry, fiercely furious at being forced into the world, he was scrunched up, fists clenched, knees up to his chest. He cried in tiny, angry little wails, and Harry gathered him to his chest and knew that everything he'd ever known had changed, forever. He leaned in and pressed a kiss, his baby's first, to his forehead.
"Is this for his Instagram?" Hermione asks. "You're not putting a crup on the internet, Draco. Stop pretending the Statute of Secrecy doesn't exist."
, but at the same time, he was fairly convinced that he should be. "That would be nice," he said finally, and if Draco refused to meet his eyes for the rest of the evening then that was completely normal and only to be expected.
"The only finger food we had at the manor were canapés," Draco said. "And in the grand scheme of things, me never having had pizza is not quite the same as you not knowing that men could get pregnant."
"If you want me to." Draco reached out and touched his fingers to Harry's hand. "If you're asking me to stay properly."
"No," Harry said, because there were more now, more that Harry had found in little antique shops and charity shops and the second hand market he'd used to visit with Draco. "They make you happy."
Glancing back to ask him how much garlic bread he wanted, Harry caught him scrubbing at his eyes with a crisp, white handkerchief, and stayed quiet.
"I'm indulging myself in a range of classic mid-century culture," Draco says, coming back out with a glass of chilled ginger beer and his un-lit pipe, and sweeping past them both on his way back to his bedroom. He's wearing a wide-legged pinstripe trouser, a pale shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a sweater vest. They're all pristine. Creases disappear in sheer horror when they see Draco coming.
"I can't," Draco said, stony-faced, and he held on tight to Harry's hand and didn't look away from the TV.
"Really," he said. He took the mango and held it in his hand. "Our baby," he said softly, before he put the mango down on the coffee table and looked back up at Harry. "We should go now."
And then Harry was on his own doorstep, in an old, too-small cloak, and he thought that maybe it wasn't the time to point out that he could just as easily apparate from inside the house.
There was a strangled sort of a noise from where Draco was sitting. "And I told you I wanted Jonny and you, that was the same thing. You know I love you."
"It's weird," Harry said. "I love him, probably more than anything I've ever loved in my life, and at the same time, I feel like my heart's broken."
"Hermione came to see me," Draco said, when he was feeding Jonny his bottle and Harry was making them both cups of tea.
"It was evil," Draco says. "How come we never had midnight feasts at school? They're frying sausages in this one."
Draco's expression went a couple of places relatively quickly, and then shuttered back down to blank. "Long time, no see, Potter," he said. "I was beginning to think I should send out a search party."
"What are you on about?" Harry asked, trying to stifle a yawn. He failed, and yawned wide. "Are you sure you're not drunk?"
"Yes, well." Harry nudged his way inside, past Draco and the curve of his stomach beneath his pullover, and in the direction of the metal hooks in the hallway so he could shrug off his cloak and hang it up. "Again, not my fault the subject didn't come up. And I was hardly going to get the birds and the bees talk from my aunt and uncle, was I?"
Harry's brain did a helpful white-out at this, which was all fine and dandy until he came back down to earth with a bump and realised Draco Malfoy had dissolved into sobs in Harry's entrance hall.
Their baby kicked again, and Harry stepped back, and out of touching distance. He didn't look away, and neither did Draco.
"Such a silly thing to love," Draco said softly, late one evening when he was awake and Harry was curled into his side on the bed, arms wrapped around him.
I go home and follow him on everything. And if I order one of his lip balms, no one ever has to know.
He glanced at the desk again: now that he thought of it, several of the newspapers lying scattered on the desk were recent and had his face on them, headlines blaring HARRY POTTER TRIUMPHS OVER HE WHO MUST NOT BE NAMED and SAVIOR OF WIZARDING WORLD TO RECEIVE ORDER OF MERLIN. This one in particular seemed to have made Malfoy so incensed that half the article was ripped clean away.
Harry felt ill. He quickly grasped for the next picture, in the hopes that it would not include Peter, but there he was, frowning at a chessboard as Sirius did some sort of victory dance around him . . . in the next, Peter and Remus were watching skeptically as Sirius mounted his broomstick backwards . . . the next photo was of Sirius and James, both leering rather groggily at the camera, jostling at each other . . .
He ignored Malfoy's indignant splutter and raced off. He was rather pleased when, twenty minutes later, he found Malfoy still waiting, though he looked decidedly annoyed about the whole matter.
He remembers everything up to the time of his death, the way someone living might, and is fairly sure who secretly commissioned the painting. He is going to have a shouting match with Draco once Draco wakes, so loudly that the entire Ministry will hear. Propping one's chin in one's hand, leaning forward, elbow on knee, is not the most comfortable way to spend six years.
“Sirius gave it to Professor Lupin to be used for Order business,” Hermione told him gently. “It’s official now. Mrs. Weasley has kindly taken over its upkeep, and we’re helping.”
For a second, Ron just stares at both of them.  Then, he gives a heavy sigh.  'Fine,' he mutters.  'But I only have it in me to be nice to Malfoy
'I'm not taking them off until you take yours off,' Malfoy said, a bit shrilly, and Harry could have laughed: it was so like him to be suspicious, to the very last.
'Harry,' she says, looking fierce, 'I know you don't want to put me in danger, but that's not stopping you from seeing Ron and Hermione, is it?  And besides, we're all in danger now, you've seen Mum's clock—all the hands are always at Mortal Peril—'
Cubicles lay before them in a room more vast than the Great Hall, and in each of them, rolls of parchment were flying and quills were scribbling away, though there were no witches or wizards to be seen. The quills were the noise Harry had heard. And the whirring—
Harry pulled back, Draco’s breath hot on his cheek, enough to stumble blindly forwards and pitch them both onto the couch, Draco beneath him. He was bony and sharp and hissed a little when Harry’s thigh slid easily and unexpectedly into the space between his, and Harry yanked off his glasses, dropping them to the table.
“Don't you ever talk about my father again!"” Draco shouted, immediately on his feet. He looked even paler, but he was trembling with fury, and that only urged Harry on. The less he had to think about what he had just done, the better.
But it is not Ron who reacts first; he is too busy recovering from the shock.  Hermione is the one who, before Harry can even pull out his wand in self-defense, has both Harry and Malfoy slammed against the wall, iron bands circling their wrists, with one shouted spell.  Harry feels as if he's just been hit by two Bludgers at once, and even Ron looks taken aback by Hermione's reaction.
They did not speak for three days, until Malfoy sat down next to him in Potions without warning and demanded, 'What're you getting Teddy for his birthday?'
'Grimmauld Place it is, then,' Harry mutters, jerking his chair back and moving towards the door.  He can feel Ginny's eyes on him, but as painful as it is, he doesn't look up—just goes.
'Ugh!' Malfoy shoved him away at once, hissing, 'Potter, you've got morning breath, that's disgusting,' but Harry caught him by the wrist and held on until Malfoy looked at him again.
“That’d be a bloody relief,” Ron muttered. “I should come visit you for a change. It’s a mad house here, Harry, the twins keep levitating things and they exploded one of Mum’s Christmas cakes, said it was an accident, she keeps shrieking at them to get their experiments out of the kitchen, and Charlie brought Ginny this little plush dragon and it roars if you scratch it behind the ears, it’s all anybody’s been doing—"
“I’ll bet Terry Boot was rubbish at that,” Tonks said. “He can’t even keep his eyes on his target. Brilliant on theory, but leaves a little to be desired on spellwork.”
“Why’d you come to the Room of Requirement?” Harry demanded, interrupting Remus’s questioning. “I thought you said you wanted nothing to do with me, Malfoy.”
Ron looks both disgusted and intrigued.  'Always knew there was something fishy about her,' he says.  'Bet she fancies you, Harry—'
'Definitely not,' Harry snapped. The other boy sounded far too eager to merely be concerned. 'She's still—I mean, we're still together.'
"Two," Draco says simply. "I loved you when you made me promise not to. And I helped the Dark Lord engineer your death."
There was nothing else for it, and with one look behind him at the fireplace, Harry ran for the door, scattering cats in his path. He wrenched it open and tore across the lawn. The cold night was a blessing as he sprinted to the house, panting and wheezing. His left ankle throbbed as if he’d twisted it, and his lungs burned, whether from the Floo powder or his frantic flight, he didn’t know.
“What is your area of expertise?” Hermione asked, giving Harry a look as he gave up on the biscuit. Her look told him explicitly that he had better stop keeping things like this from her and Ron, or else. He gave her a halfhearted shrug of apology.
'I'm sorry about her,' Ginny said as she led the way into the other room. 'This time of year, you know, it's hard.'
Harry thought for a split second of hiding, hoping she would go away, but it was useless, and he said with resignation, “In here, Hermione.”
"Mental," Ron muttered to Harry. Just then, another spider crawled down the wall, and he leapt back.
'I can't,' Hermione says, 'but I'll look up a few books for you.  In fact, I think there was something in the Hogwarts library, called
'Blood ties mean obligations,' Malfoy says, cutting Harry off with a look.  'Blood faith, a common bond, you know.  If someone with the proven pedigree calls in a favour like that, you do what you can.  Pureblood etiquette, it's a law older than Hogwarts.'
Harry’s thin, white hands curled around the top of the chair, his knuckles standing out like bone. “And the Dementors are there, Bella?”
ostensibly get him into trouble for it. And, well, it was Malfoy. What was next, letting him borrow Harry’s Invisibility Cloak? Lending him his broomstick?
“Oh yeah, and Ginny had Luna Lovegood over yesterday. I tell you, she’s nutters, Harry—all she did was wander around muttering about Nargles and Crumple Toothed Hornbacks or whatever they’re called!”
“Percy,” Ron mouthed to Harry, who nodded in understanding. If the Weasleys had thought Fudge’s admittance of Voldemort’s return would shame Percy into remembering his family, it had done nothing of the sort. Harry had seen him in the background of a picture in the Prophet the other week, and he had been straightening his glasses nervously, paging through his notebook as dutifully as ever.
'Well, I don't want your pity, Potter,' Malfoy snapped, his sharp features pink with fury. 'You've got the wrong idea if you think I'll be grateful, think maybe I'll be your friend now, is that it? I'm not sorry, Potter! I didn't want to do it but I wasn't wrong! I'm here, aren't I?'
“He is his own person,” Harry said hotly. He couldn’t believe this was the second time he had to defend Draco in less than twenty four hours.
He gritted his teeth. He had expected Snape to pick on him; after all, he doubted Snape hated any other student as much as he hated Harry. But he was willing to bet that, aside from Hermione, no one else knew the answer, either. “I don’t know,” he said again, more belligerently.
Harry tried, "Well, it sounds as if she's getting along all right, maybe she can get some of your things back—"
'For the Order,' George agrees.  'Every Auror should have one, and you're right, we could make something a little more easy to hide, maybe—'
'I don't forget anything,' Malfoy mutters.  'You, apparently, do, since you switch moods about ten times a minute—'
Behind Malfoy, one of the girls snickered and whispered something to her friend, whom Harry thought might be Daphne Greengrass. Malfoy seemed even more enraged by this. In fact, he looked so incensed that Anthony stepped forward, as if to protect Hermione.
'Well, you said that anyone who would know about him is either dead or an enemy of ours.  She may not like us, but she is hanging right there on the wall.'
Harry took a step forward, prompting Malfoy to cross his arms over his skinny chest as if in protection; his nostrils flared like a nervous thestral. 'Malfoy,' Harry said. 'Come back to Hogwarts.'
Harry could not believe that Ron had the gall to gang up on him like this. 'That was—we both came in late and there were no other seats!'
“Under house arrest until her trial,” Draco said, his eyes flashing cold and unfamiliar. “I heard the Metamorphmagus is going to testify.”
The lid was screwed on too tightly and he flushed while trying to open it, and then the lube was cold on his fingers, sticky and strange. He glanced down at Draco, whose eyes looked dark from this angle, and the way the pale muscles in his thighs were tight and smooth.
, swagger?' Harry exclaimed. 'You were the one swaggering around for years, mocking me and my friends!'
The party went on so late that only Harry's head drooping onto the table brought it to a close as Mrs. Weasley leapt to her feet, exclaiming, 'The poor boy's exhausted, he should rest, it's late and Arthur, you've a big day tomorrow . . .'
Harry learned that, sometimes in the night, Malfoy would slide his fingers over Harry’s ribs and keep them there, in an absurd echo of how he’d clutched at Harry the last time they’d been in this room, Fiendfyre at their heels. Sometimes Harry would lie there feigning sleep for long minutes, timing his breathing, until Malfoy’s trembling grip on his ribcage grew heavy and loose. On those nights, Harry learned, he never once had a nightmare.
It was angry, frantic, Draco’s grip nearly strangling Harry, Harry’s hand flying up to seize his arm hard enough to bruise. And he’d missed this, this heat, this slick union of tongues and lips, Draco’s hand solid against his back. He’d missed Draco—
'Oh.'  Malfoy looks curiously pale, but he says, 'You'll get him, all right?  He's got to protect me, it's an Unbreakable.'  His mouth twists as he adds, 'What else?  There's got to be more than that.'
“Snape was the only one who looked out for us,” Draco barreled on, “and he was the best professor here. Don’t we have the right to mourn for him? Don’t we?”
'Hi there, Harry,' Fred says cheerfully.  'Nothing like being accused of a stolen identity to make a chap feel welcome, eh?  Hermione, I'm still not sure what any of this has to do with us.'
'You had better be!' she retorts shrilly.  'No one ever knew why, but he said you would help, he believed in you!  How dare you let him down!  How dare you—'
“Well, your precious Anthony was there, wasn’t he now?” Ron began to say, but Dumbledore stood at that moment, and he quieted rapidly before his voice could carry to the Ravenclaws.
Mere minutes later, he seemed to be on the verge of drifting off when Harry poked him in the shoulder and he grunted in annoyance.
“Listen,” Draco said forcefully, “you don’t understand what Snape meant to our house. He was the only one who cared about Slytherin. He helped us, Potter. He was
Penelope had heard something, at least, for she spotted them and came over. 'How are you three?' she said, smiling. Her dark, curly hair hung past her shoulders; she was pink-cheeked and beaming in the cold. She was not the sort of witch Harry would pick out as Malfoy's type, if he had ever given thought to the matter.
Draco and Harry have a civil conversation for once, with one quiet moment, a small confession and it went well until the mention of Lucius Malfoy.
He hadn’t had a friend for eleven years. It was sort of surreal to register the fact that Draco Malfoy wanted to be his friend. It wasn’t an idea he couldn’t entertain, yet it was a rather daft one. Perhaps, It might work out. Or not. He wasn't certain.
?” A breath clawed out of the brunet’s throat. He winced at how venomous his voice was, cleared his throat and softly whispered, “why not?”
Instead of interrupting Potter’s useless attempts at perfecting wandless magic, he strode into his room and closed the door behind him. He had the sudden urge to break a few things. Specifically Potter’s face.
"Well yeah, essentially, and you haven't set me on fire in my sleep yet so I count that as a yes." An attempt to lighten the situation. Smooth but also reckless in the most Harry Potter way possible.
He had summoned the whipped cream in the morning, but he hadn’t been focused on the magic. He had wanted to gain a tiny victory over Malfoy. It shouldn’t be a task to summon a seashell. To his dismay, it was a task. And a problematic one at that.
“I can,” Potter said with a sigh, half-turning to face him, fingers brushing over his jean pocket in an anxious manner, a ghost of a concerned frown crossing his features. “I wouldn’t worry – You can’t compliment a soul, Malfoy.”
"Told you he fancied the idea of you in a black dress," Pansy winked, which caused Draco to direct yet another warning glare at her. "oh, why don't you stare fondly at Harry instead?”
A familiar rage flared within the brunet. He wanted to counter the untrue accusation. Ron couldn’t’ve insulted Draco Malfoy. He wouldn’t.  “Oh, you were the one who insulted Ron, you prat.”
As he returned in the evening and placed the warm cloak in place, he heard impatient pacing at a distance. With a smirk, he walked to the kitchen counter.
He smirked, before finally taking the skates from him. He laced them up, and he followed him to the ice. He scowled, looking at the ice as though he wished to be anywhere else. Harry stepped onto the ice and moved to the side to give him some space. He held his hand out to the blond. “Give me your hand, I’ll help you.”
“No,” Draco said in a trance, the thumb tracing small circles on the artifact, inspecting it with a strange interest which caused Harry to think of one ring to rule them all. “it’s not an ordinary watch, is it?” He wanted to comment on how it wasn’t a watch. “if it’s not one, what is it?”
“I never wanted to be bad.” Malfoy said, with a weak smile. It wasn’t an answer – No – Yet, it said a lot. Yes, it always came down to a choice, but what if Malfoy wasn’t given a choice?
It was precisely the sardonic retort Malfoy was waiting for. And he didn’t write one. Instead, he crumbled the parchment and tossed it aside. It was oddly satisfying to have a small win over Draco Malfoy.
.” Malfoy said with a resigned sigh, checking his stance and extending the arm in front of him. He closed his eyes and exhaled slowly. “
When the whisper of profanities ceased, he raised his eyes and half-turned with a quip on the tip of his tongue, only to find the brunet asleep with the novel on perched on his chest and the strand of hair falling on his face.
He carded his fingers through his hair, and closed his eyes. A wandless corporeal Patronus. It wouldn’t be easy. He didn’t have a choice, did he?
“Oh, what do you want, Malfoy?” He rasped, almost a growl, without any venom in it. Potter was sort of worn-out, the eyes were dull, reflecting only the dim candlelight of the room. “I want to sort out our fight.”
A verbal jab wasn’t what he was angling for. It wasn’t – which explained the faint smile on his face – A part of him still recalled the third-year. The simpler times.
“Draco I –” With a frown, Potter perched up on the edge of the couch, and his shoulders tensed while he fidgeted with the cup in the hand. “what I said to you – it’s – none of it is true.”
“Draco,” He said, and he thought about reaching out to touch Malfoy, he doesn't know why but he thought about it. He didn't, however, and his hand twitched at his side in retaliation. Almost as if he'd surpressed an urge. “Why?”
“Stuart Little? I have no idea – Potter, be lenient with the sugar – who Stuart Little is, and I’ll ignore it.”
“Oh, I can compliment a single soul once in a while. You, for instance –” He paused, thinking of a subtle compliment but he actually couldn’t come up with one. “Your – Oh, nevermind – I can’t compliment you.”
“Your quips, mind you, aren’t well-suited for a serious conversation and you should tone it down, Potter or I will light you on fire in your sleep,” He warned. “Clear?”
“I would’ve prepared breakfast instead of conjuring a patronus but you drifted off to sleep in the middle of a fairy-tale and I don't suppose I could've left you out on the rooftop, could I?”
“Quit with the orders, Malfoy – You’re not the fucking prince of Slytherin in Otryazan – and you will certainly not order me around.” He countered in a low voice. “If I could get off you, I fucking would.”
Draco had closed his eyes for a brief minute to focus on it and he had drifted off to sleep, ending up closer to the brunet and unconsciously resting his head on the slender shoulder. Oh, he wished he hadn’t closed his eyes.
– In Madam Malkin’s – the first year,” Draco whispered with a soft sigh, the shadow of his mouth moving up and down. The occasional flash of the perfect white teeth.  “we had a short conversation.”
“Your rib was –” Draco said with a sarcastic tone, squinting in place with a low grunt. “– fractured, wasn’t it?”
Draco ran his fingers across the frame. He exhaled softly, tearing his gaze away from it. He walked towards the window, and a soft breeze brushed across his face. He inhaled the familiar scent of seawater and watched the waves crash against the shore. “What the–"
Fantastic. A foreign phrase. A French phrase that caused a brief stutter in the chest. “I can’t recall a second of the conversation where Ron was offensive to you or your minions.”
“I was fine without you on Otryazan,” Draco’s voice was uncertain, wobbly. "One day, out of the blue, you, Harry James Potter, the Chosen One, were sent to the Island," he swallowed hard, looking as if he was having great difficulty trying to spit the words out, and whispered, "by my own – father." He managed to only waver for a brief second when he mentioned Lucius, "who risked his own life, for once, and sent you to save me or whatever."
Draco arched an eyebrow at him with a faint chuckle. The brunet scowled, turning his head to the sea, staring at it with an unfocused gaze. “Can you?”
Harry inhaled sharply, as he cast a four-point spell. In this case, he didn’t have a wand to point north. He focused on the magic coursing through him, sweat glistening on his forehead.
He had to perfect it, because he didn’t have a fucking wand. And he wasn’t going to be defenseless around Draco Malfoy. Or anyone. He was driven by the idea of perfecting wandless magic.
He didn’t want to strike a conversation with Harry Potter. Yet, he couldn’t watch the boy drain himself, and he didn’t suppose that Potter had a wand, because Draco was still in one piece. He traced his fingers across his jaw absent-mindedly, and let out an irritated sigh.
"I – I had to consider for a while before telling you what exactly it is." Harry whispered and sounded so earnest, like the truth was flowing straight out of his heart and mind. Draco didn't want to think about it.
whenever you want to,” He was, however, certain that if Draco Malfoy wanted to cast an Obliviate, he would, without a doubt. “I will
“Clearly,” Draco murmured with a soft snort, fidgeting with the hem of the sweater absent-mindedly, while he said, “you’re never in a stable emotional condition.” A beat. “Quit repeating yourself, Potter.”
you and for the record, if you aren’t thinking about something happy, you won’t cast one. Ever.” He said with a snort. “
He was certain that the brunet wouldn’t figure it out considering the prat was oblivious. Besides, he was focused on teaching Draco to cast a corporeal Patronus, yet he had a small smile grazing the corner of his mouth. A small, eloquent smile.
"You're mad, Potter," Malfoy snarled, white-lipped. "Fine. All right, by all means. Teach me how to best you."
After the first round, it was clear to Harry that the best choices for captains were a boisterous Hufflepuff named Owen Cauldwell, and Demelza Robins from Gryffindor. With no small amount of arguing, he finally got Malfoy to agree. A second round of trials commenced, and then they settled on the ground to choose teams.
The clatter of Harry's belt buckle on the floor made a shameful noise; his trousers were an old pair of Dudley's and the minute he undid the button, they slid down his legs. He was left standing there in only his underpants and a worn old t-shirt that had once been Ron's, something accidentally traded in the Quidditch locker room and never returned. Malfoy was staring at him in the green gloom and Harry thought for a second of how knobbly his knees were.
'Oh, could I have? Yes, after Dumbledore was killed, after I ran from the scene, is that when? You would have welcomed me with open arms, is that what you're telling me?'
“Leave him be,” Madam Hooch said briskly, approaching them, “the boy needs room to breathe—there, Potter, how are you feeling? No injuries? Good, good. Clever trick of young Malfoy’s, wasn’t it? Of course, I was about to cast a Floating Spell—but quick thinking anyway—"
“Oh, loads better,” Hagrid exclaimed. “Got in an awful fight with a centaur, bellowin’ like yeh wouldn’ believe, but he’s healin’ up splendidly, the lad—bin thinkin’ abou’ givin’ ‘im some company, come ter think o’ it—"
In the next three days, Harry found it surprisingly easy to avoid Malfoy, quite possibly because Malfoy was avoiding him. It was easy to rush out of Potions beside Hermione, or sit at the opposite side of the room in Charms, or go down to breakfast early, so that not only did Harry not have to bump into Malfoy over meals, he did not even have to see him. Harry did not even have to try that hard.
Once, he had thought being a Gryffindor made you great. Yet Gryffindor was only the first choice, and you had to keep choosing, there was no guarantee. Slytherin did not make you evil any more than Hufflepuff made you quiet and obedient, or Ravenclaw witty.
Harry, for his part, glances furtively over at Cho, though she is now shielded by the tall girl she came with, Katie Bell, either Parvati or Padma—he can't tell—and Ginny.  He makes an exasperated noise.  'Aren't there other Ravenclaws we can ask?  I mean, there's Luna, isn't there—'
"Don't 'sorry, Mum' me!" Mrs. Weasley shrilled. "I know just where you were last night, young lady, and I won't be forgetting it!" Her voice turned gentle, for a moment, and she said, "Harry, dear, I'm sorry about your cousin. You'll have to ask Arthur about that when he gets home, I'm sure he can straighten things out." And with that, she continued indignantly, "Now all four of you finish up your breakfast, and we can start to work on the china cabinets. I know for certain there's some silver that needs polishing, Ron, and that wood could use a good dusting!"
Harry rests his hands on Scrimgeour's desk and leans forward.  Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another airplane memo zoom into the box and flatten itself out neatly.  He says, 'It's about Draco Malfoy.'
On the wall, a map of the United Kingdom is hung crookedly with Sellotape; Harry's Invisibility Cloak is draped with most of his discarded clothes over a chair too rickety to bear anyone's weight; next to him, Ron is snoring amidst several empty crisps packets, a thick book spread open on his chest.  Harry has no idea what time it is, he hasn't seen Molly Weasley or Remus Lupin in three days, and he can't remember the last time he showered.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment. Then he said, utterly serious, “If you’re going to Wales, I’m coming with you.”
It was the next afternoon when Harry knelt before the fireplace, hands on his knees. It was disconcerting to see only Ron’s head sticking out of the fire, but Ron didn’t seem to notice. He was talking rapidly; in fact, since he had first appeared in the fire, Harry didn’t think he had shut up.
“Better,” Harry said, making a face. Beside them, Katie was felled by a Bat-Bogey Hex, which seemed to be Ginny’s specialty. Harry and Remus watched as Ginny immediately removed the hex, feeling sorry for Katie as she beat at her face. Without losing a moment, Katie cast a hex in return, and both Harry and Remus gave her an approving nod for her quick recovery.
The day before the wedding, he was nodding off over one last pint with Ron, the others long gone (Neville to his latest girl, George to the shop, Dean begging off early after frowning through most of the evening).
Harry fidgeted. After a moment, she prodded, 'And what would you like to do with your life, Mr. Potter? I believe that the last time we spoke, we discussed your ambitions of being an Auror.'
Lost, Harry pressed on, “What you said earlier. About, er, missing me, and how you were worried—I didn’t know, I thought you were just. I didn’t know.”
It was still snowing fiercely outside the next evening; Harry watched it come down outside the windows of the Gryffindor common room, turning the world white. All around him, he could hear people talking and laughing, and he had his Transfiguration book cradled in his lap, but he was thinking instead about Draco, and the way he had stared at Harry in such shock when Harry had hissed about his father.
A bell tolled in the distance and Teddy started to cry. Harry watched as his hair darkened from light brown to black, then into tufts of blue.
Harry hadn't wanted his portrait done. Once he had realized the lasting quality of wizarding life, he had gone on a rampage and cut up all his photographs. His own eyes had winked up at him as he attacked the photos with scissors; when he found Colin's stash of negatives, he had burned everything at once. "I don't want to exist in twenty thousand autographed photos," he'd snapped at his friends when they questioned him. "When I'm dead, I'm
'Suppose I'll go back, too,' Ron said in a glum voice, quite obviously torn between the spending the year with Hermione and not having to return to lessons. 'Anyway, Mum'll make me, I can just hear her now.'
Of all things, Pansy Parkinson's words flooded back to Harry, and he thought, startled, that he wasn't all that nice. He was good, and brave, but perhaps Pansy was right, he had never been nice.
'Lord, Potter, what are you doing?' Malfoy whispered, breath coming a little fast from the shock. 'Watching me, were you?'
Slughorn beamed indulgently. 'My boy, I am the very anonymous tip she mentions in that piece. I daresay my connections are often put to good use when an old friend calls in a favor.'
Harry was just about to call out Malfoy's name in the vain hope someone might hear him when he heard the faint sound of voices arguing, growing nearer.
Malfoy was different, Harry mused later.  It wasn’t like Malfoy to apologize, though come to think, it wasn’t like Malfoy to punch him in the mouth, either.  He was more likely to complain loudly and get Harry detention, and then write a song about it that got stuck in everyone’s heads for no apparent reason, and then get his friends to punch Harry in the mouth.
'Yeah, you could come to Tinworth,' Harry said. 'Come on, it could be fun. Think of it like visiting Malcolm Baddock, and I just happen to be going to the same place for a couple of days.'
Malfoy made a low little sound, and then he was swinging his legs back around to lie stiffly back beside Harry. ‘Happy now?’
'Bend the rules?' Hermione echoed. 'Ron Weasley, he's the Minister of Magic! He's the highest ruling authority in Wizarding Britain! The Minister of Magic cannot just break laws willy-nilly, and he most certainly cannot bend them to aid wanted criminals!' She saw Harry's face and said quickly, 'I mean, that's how the Ministry views Malfoy, is what I meant.'
Pansy looked at him, her mouth set in a concentrated line, almost as if she were asking him a question without words. If she were, however, he couldn't understand it.
Head held high, McGonagall unrolled a piece of parchment and began to read off the names of those who died in the Battle of Hogwarts, one year ago.
Harry shifted his leg to the left until his knee jostled Malfoy's; to his delight, Malfoy's elbow jerked in surprise and slopped gravy all over the table.
The hall erupted in ragged cheers again, and though full platters of food appeared on the long tables, no one paid any mind; they were all hugging one another, some crying, some simply relieved. More than one person came up to Harry wanting to shake his hand or clutch him round the shoulders, whispering, 'Thank you. Harry, thank you.'
'—you remember how mad Bill was for Lucy, we all thought they'd be nauseating and call each other 'baby' forever and have little slobbering children in no time,' Charlie was saying, hands thrust in his pockets. 'Now look, he and Fleur are having a kid, and they're as happy as could be.'
'So you are here,' Harry manages.  'Were you planning something?  Because this doesn't look like an ambush.'
There was a noise behind Harry in the quiet hallway, the sound of the door snicking open and the brief roar from inside before it slid shut again. Harry turned.
Malfoy was still smirking. 'Yes, I expect it's hard for her, being around the stench of—' Malfoy sputtered to a halt, then; Harry had just cast
Raising an eyebrow at the fading Patronus, Harry took a few steps forward. "Really? It didn't look too impressive to me, either way."
“Oh, shut it,” he returned good-naturedly. “Both of them did all right in the Department of Mysteries, didn’t they?”
“And he never shuts up,” Ron muttered. “Every time I miss the Quaffle, he’s all over me. Don’t see anybody getting on his case for anything.”
Mrs. Black is awake when they parade towards her portrait, her curtains open, but her eyes are glassy and empty, the way they have been since they moved in.  Her old screams of rage have been replaced by silence, and when Hermione says politely, 'Excuse me, Mrs. Black?' there is no response.
'You do know there are loads of girls who would date you.' Ron's voice lowered dangerously. 'There's my sister, for one.'
“What happened?” Harry asked, hating the grave look on Ron’s face. He sat down in the chair beside Ron, while Hermione perched at the foot of the bed. Hermione had not had time to tell him very much as they rushed to the hospital wing. And Malfoy had not waited to hear more; he had bolted as soon as Hermione spoke, face chalky.
The image of Malfoy’s father in the middle of Hay-On-Wye flashed again in his mind. Harry scowled. “I didn’t say anything!”
'Please,' Malfoy spat. 'I know what you're doing down here, Potter, you thought you'd feel a bit better about yourself if you saw how empty Slytherin was, right? Or you were tired of listening to Granger shriek about house-elves, yeah, you're so bored with your golden life that you decided to come pick a fight with me—'
'You'd think they would at least keep up with your favorite sweets,' Ron added, eye on the Acid Pops. 'I could do with a few nice chocolates.' He cast a longing gaze at the tin from Romilda, though clearly knew better than to touch them.
Harry stared at him. He could hear the echoes of Draco’s sneering taunts, the way he had shouted, “I hope next time it’s Granger!” He knew, in the back of his mind, that Draco was still a horrible, hateful little bigot who thought nothing of using other people, and the knowledge had frozen him, it was impossible to ignore. Yet here, staring at Draco standing so simply before him, he could almost feel his resolve melting away.
“You know what I mean,” she sighed. “’We must unite inside her or we’ll crumble from within,’ remember? That’s all I meant.”
,' Malfoy mocks, then colors, as if he regrets the joke.  Harry, amused, watches him stomp upstairs.
It took Harry a moment to realize that he wasn’t supposed to know what was going on, and he tried to look innocently curious as he said, “Something’s happening in Wales?”
Harry frowned; as they had dashed away that night, Snape had shouted things at Harry, things that now, in retrospect, sounded like advice. He had promised Dumbledore to protect Harry, just as he had made an Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco. And neither of them had known.
He was breathing harder from casting, though, and yelled, somehow exuberant, “That’s it, fight me, Malfoy, you think you can? Try it, try to stop me, go on, don’t just sit there—"
“Yeah,” Harry said faintly. And then, suddenly, “Wait, Tonks, can you—can you get in trouble for this, isn’t it somehow—"
'It's okay,' Harry muttered, though his face was hot. 'Nothing happened. We just took some time, and.' He didn't finish.
, though she does look embarrassed when Harry rubs at his wrists.  Glancing away, she says, 'Now, Harry, what
'I don't want you to Polyjuice into Ginny!' Harry said violently. 'What the hell? Why would you think that?'
Harry followed him dutifully back into the Room of Requirement, where the room was cloaked in shadows and the sheets were cool and soft. He fell back asleep almost instantly, before Malfoy could lie down beside him, and in the morning he woke to an empty room. The only signs Malfoy had been there were the Slytherin colors on the bedclothes, which Harry changed to red and gold out of spite.
Harry turned it over in his fingers, frowning. “I thought you—" Harry began, when he looked up at Draco and saw him smiling strangely, almost sadly. Harry said, confused, “What is it?”
"Not Chang, then," Draco mused. "Well, who've you got your eye on, then, Potter? The Metamorphmagus, is it?"
'I'm only saying, there's a great deal of reform needed, and the sooner the better. There aren't any wizards or witches in place who'll stand up for the rights of non-wizards, is the problem, or precious few! Why, that absolute brute Macnair worked in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, that ought to tell you a bit about the Ministry's priorities, don't you think, Harry?'
“Well, no. But you should have,” Ron concluded judiciously. “Anyway, Dad says the Malfoys are getting a bad deal of it, with Mr. Malfoy in Azkaban. Says the Ministry froze most of his bank accounts on suspicions and they’ve already searched Malfoy’s house at least twice.” He was looking gleeful. “Serves him right, I say.”
“Well, there’s no need to be rude about it,” Hermione said briskly. “We’d better hurry, Tonks is waiting for us.”
The last straw was on Malfoy's birthday, when she dragged him out of breakfast at the Gryffindor table just to wag a finger in his face and demand he make an appearance that night.
Harry smiles in spite of himself.  Malfoy's turned around now, staring out the window, something tight and frozen about his expression, and Harry puts his hand on the other boy's upper arm; says, 'Malfoy?'  He half expects him to turn and bury his face in Harry's shoulder, or something equally Cho-like, but all Malfoy does is clench his fists and push away from Harry, not angry, just determined somehow.
,' Harry reads, feeling a flutter of disappointment.  'I suppose that means Malfoy's mum should be headed there in a couple days.  Oh, and he's scribbled a bit about chatting soon at the bottom.'
One corner of her mouth quirked upwards further. “Oh come on,” she said, “just kiss me, will you?” And she rose to her knees, swung one leg over his lap, and ended up straddling him, mouth hot and eager over his.
“Tonks,” he managed to say, after a moment, “uh, thanks, but I really don’t think this is a good idea—"
Harry pressed at his hair again. 'Yeah,' he said at last. He was thinking of Godric, but for some reason, his dad's was the face that kept swimming before him. 'Yeah, sometimes we can be a little arrogant.'
"You forget, Potter, that I've nothing to lose,” he snarled. “If the Dark Lord wins, I win. If you win, I win. Otherwise, I don't care. I'm not you."
“A bit,” Harry said, overwhelmed. Tonks had disappeared somewhere behind him, and Ron was left holding on to the straps of Harry’s trunk, which bobbed in the air. Harry looked at him and was rewarded with a raised eyebrow, as if to say,
When they reached her rooms, however, all four heard voices from inside, and Hermione frowned. “That sounds like Tonks,” she said. “Should we knock, do you think? It’s nearly half past.”
'Flooing isn't allowed!' Ron interrupted. 'Not out of the castle. You should know that, it's in the rules.'
Harry wished he hadn't been; it was so much easier to loathe a man looking smart in dress robes, striding through the halls of the Ministry, than an elderly white-haired wizard, wearing striped pajamas. His hands shook as he reached for the lamp, and then he saw Harry and gasped.
'I don't know!' He flattened his hair despairingly. 'Isn't that what you said? That we needed some time to, to think things through?' When she didn't answer, he scowled at the tabletop. 'It shouldn't be this hard, it isn't fair! After everything—'
‘I’m telling you it’s none of your business,’ Harry snapped. ‘And he is too seeing Ginny, I saw them sitting at breakfast together.’
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Dumbledore. You know, I was with him when he died.' Doge gasped at this, but Harry barreled on. 'That's right. So was Draco, come to think. And do you know what Dumbledore did, with Draco's wand at his throat, when he could barely stand up? He offered Draco a second chance.'
Harry's bout of patience fails.  'You said you didn't know where he was!' he yells, having forgot how furious Malfoy can make him.  'Make up your mind!  If you're lying to me, I'll find out.  If you're trying to pull some kind of trick—'
As for Harry, he was sitting beside the fire when Arthur Weasley engaged him in an hour-long discussion of airplanes and whether he'd ever been inside one. 'Haven't, sorry,' Harry shrugged. 'Dudley did once, the Dursleys all went to New York City for Christmas one year.'
Draco’s lips were hot and chapped from the wind, and they opened in surprise against Harry’s. He felt his pulse thundering as the kiss deepened and Draco’s hands settled tentatively at his waist, Draco’s fingers curling around the wool of his jumper. Harry ran his hand up Draco’s side, the silk dragging against his palm, and Draco gave a soft, sharp breath against their kiss. Curiously, Harry slid his hand back down to Draco’s hip, and felt his breath hiss in again.
Harry hated himself, then, for throwing it in Ron's face, when he hadn’t remembered either. I'm sorry, Sirius, he thought fiercely, and spent the next ten minutes meditating so determinedly on Sirius's absence that a telltale lump formed in his throat. What was it Malfoy had said to him?
“Wait,” Malfoy cut him off, a confused frown etched on his face. “Why were you – Harry Potter: The epitome of light – in Borgin and Burkes? It’s not a place for the boy-who-lived, you know?”
He climbed up to the roof, and smiled uncertainly. Malfoy was staring at the sky and humming absent-mindedly, as he carded his fingers through his blond hair.
A shrug. He brushed a strand of blond hair out of his face, with his mouth set in a thin line. Not the perfect time to utter a subtle apology. “If I would’ve, I wouldn’t have implied – you know.”
“I – can I come in?” He whispered in a soft, uncertain voice, which caused one small, small stutter in Draco’s chest. Quickly stamped down, however, by the frustration at himself for his vain efforts to shun Potter despite all that he was holding against the prat at that moment.  “only for one minute or two–” A small frown creased his forehead. “Of course, I wouldn’t want to waste your precious moment of peace when you’re occupied with your – Lord of the rings?”
“I – yeah,” Draco’s fingers were trembling at the side and he couldn’t focus on the words or on the motion of the wand – instead, he was focused on the touch – on the warm breath on the back of the neck. “Right.”
“Why don't we start,” Draco said, turning his head to squint at him, and inching closer until they were nose-to-nose. “with you enlightening me on why you can’t stand to be around me?”
. To Draco Malfoy, he was only Harry Potter. “It wasn’t – isn’t – because I’m the chosen one, is it?”
Not that he wanted to create another episode of Tom & Jerry, yet the situation was awfully similar. He was metaphorically setting a mouse traps with cheese to lure him out (subtly). Malfoy wasn’t as clever as Jerry.
“You’re Calypso,” Harry said, with a smirk as he cracked an egg into the mixing bowl. “You’re in an Island, with me – Harry Potter – The hero of the wizarding world.”
The trauma of the loss hadn’t been easy on him. He would’ve spiralled into a never-ending cycle of suffering and guilt if Potter wasn’t here. And he couldn’t decide if he wanted to kick Potter’s arse out of Otryazan or not.
“I’ve been calling you ‘blond barbie’, ‘Tinkerbell’, ‘Calypso’ and ‘The Little Blond Lesbian’ and a couple more – Oh wait, I suppose it was ‘dramatic blond barbie’ – a couple other things like ‘sour patch’ or ‘rain cloud over my sunshine’ – You don’t want to know.”
“I –” Draco paused for a brief second, a small frown creasing his forehead, and the fingers around the brunet’s forearm tensed. “– sure, I wanted to.”
“Oh, what – to write about my hair care or skin care routine?” Draco refuted in the a spur of moment, which caused a small, brief smirk to form on Harry’s face. “Salazar fuck –” It elicited a soft groan. “
“I faced Voldemort for six consecutive years,” He said with a satisfied upturn of lips. “if you think your glares will hold the intended effect, you’ll only frustrate yourself – Don’t fucking bother.”
. Now, if we’re quite finished with pleasantries – we can begin – so, force out the distractions in your mind and focus solely on the flow of your magic and direct it to the desired result while -
He placed the cup of tea on the counter and flicked the badges to one side. He wasn’t certain what it was. A cup with a piece of Voldemort’s soul in it, sure. What exactly was it, though?
Malfoy half-turned to face him, with a bit of curiosity. He arched an eyebrow, as if to demand a further elaboration. “Even if it’s a sad ending?”
Third December, 1996 – The flash of sliver. The falling stars. A whisper – He had to find out the fragment. A part concealed in his own mind. A blank canvas, he had already painted, and yet, the colours had been erased. Erased. Erased. Memories erased.
Harry snorted, an amused smirk playing on his lips. “You – Draco Malfoy – My arch nemesis – The little blond lesbian from the snake house – draped a blanket over me at night?”
It was a trap, wasn’t it? Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t willingly risk himself. He stared at the lilac grey sky, and the stars. Harry gritted his teeth, and walked to the coastline.
The blond was on the chair, fingers interlaced with his head bowed. “Our first twenty minutes of the conversation went well,” Harry said with a short, nervous laugh, “I was certain we’d fight, y’know?”
It was a soft whisper, the warm breath ghosting on the skin, causing a shiver to race down Draco’s spine and a warmth to rise in the face while the brunet guided his hand in a slow circular motion. “ease up, Draco.”
Malfoy snorted, yet he didn’t retort. A tiny victory. It caused a rush of satisfaction within Harry. The corner of his lip twitched and curled into the smallest smirk. “Your constructive criticism isn’t encouraging, Potter.”
“Malfoy?” He resolutely ignored the fact that Malfoy was sort of close to him, or that the grief was plainly visible on his face as he whispered, “I – can you point Sirius? I can’t find it.”
Draco's hair was curled at the ends, a few strands falling over the forehead and his eyes were captured with a black eyeliner, a powder dusted on the eyelids, archly curled lashes.
,” It wasn’t laced with malice. Wasn’t certain if he wanted it to. It was an offhanded retort. “I wasn’t fond of the prejudiced views or you.”
He softened when he detected a slight tremble in Malfoy’s voice. In retrospect, he should’ve specified the reason. “It’s not because you’re a Death Eater. It’s not.”
It felt odd to recite a fairy-tale while baking cookies, but there was a glint in Malfoy’s eyes. Almost a childish innocence. “The fact that she tied Flynn with her hair was – weird.”
Draco clutched his chest with a pained gasp, a small smile on the corners of his mouth, the dust of the previous conversation subsiding. “Oh, you wound me.”
“It’s a –” Draco’s words were cut short when his fingers uncurled from the counter and he stumbled forward with a soft yelp.
Harry peered into the startling grey eyes while he swirled to the music with Draco and felt a faint flutter in the chest, which wouldn’t cease. “You dance well.”
“Pardon?” He had a soft, confused smile on the face at the abrupt change of tone and for once, Harry was reluctant to wipe it off Draco’s face. “why didn’t I, what?”
“An astute observation, Potter.” Draco said with a scoff and tilted his head at the sky. It was starting to lighten, tinted with a bit of gold. “So, you can hum and conjure a corporeal wandless patronus. Show off.”
"Can we -" The brunet's voice cracked while Draco lifted a brow at him and a corner of his mouth curved upward while he placed the glass of wine on the table. "Circe fuck -"
Draco couldn’t conceal the small, small smile which had formed on the mouth. It was a definite improvement for
“It’s not,” He said with an irritated sigh and closed his eyes for a brief moment while he leaned on the kitchen counter, “would you care to elaborate, Malfoy?”
A tense silence lingered in the air, and Malfoy pointedly focused on folding the crepe while he whispered an uncertain, “Who isn’t, Potter?”
“Well, I dueled with the death eaters,” He said, with a satisfied smirk. “I barely dodged the curses they were sending my way, while I was finding a way out. I was in the east wing. Your father – He dueled with me, and he wasn’t using any unforgivable curses or hexes.”
He frowned, tracing his finger over it as he continued to walk to the shore. In retrospect, he should’ve considered concealing it in plain sight. He didn’t wish to carry it.
Yet, in that moment, he didn’t flinch. He didn’t flinch when the blond curled closer to him. The surge of panic at the touch was replaced with the familiar flutter in his chest with the warmth coursing in his body.
He received a soft mumble in response, and he couldn’t resist a faint smile. Malfoy was warm and it was the kind of warmth that would settle within you at a slight contact. It was a comforting sort of warmth.
“Oh, the moronic fuck won’t leave,” A soft sigh escaped Draco’s mouth. He didn't want to do this, not now. He had no patience or the inclination to care about what the precious Chosen One wanted. Yet of course, ignoring Potter's presence wasn't an option. The prat wouldn’t grant Draco the privilege. He closed the novel with a curse and placed it on the bedside table. “what?”
“Oh, fuck no –” Harry felt a small twinge in his chest, no way he was going to let this go without reconciliation. “We are not finished yet,” that elicited a soft groan out of the blond, “I want answers,
The nightmarish reign of Voldemort had ended, and a new golden era had been ushered in. Across the country, wizards and witches celebrated, raising their glasses to the sky in a silent salute.
He sat down next to the trapdoor and flopped onto his side, finding some comfort in the tiny sliver of light that escaped past the edges. He curled up into a fetal position so that his head rested on top of his knees. Idly, Draco realised that his kneecaps slotted perfectly into his eye sockets and chuckled dryly.
"Woah," Draco whispered after the dust had settled. Underneath the fabric stood a grandfather clock made of dark wood, its glass dirtied and cracked. It was silent and still, its pendulum paused mid-swing, its arms permanently pointing to 3:15. The glass door was slightly open and when Draco moved closer, he thought he could see something sitting at the bottom of the clock, but it was too dark to see what it was.
"Of course," the Matron said graciously, her smile more genuine now. "I'm so glad you're taking him off my hands. Draco here really needs the discipline. Just this morning, he caused a lot of trouble, the cheeky thing. Sent some letter from a
He had been waiting for quite a while now, and his legs were sore from standing up for so long. It shouldn't have taken Dumbledore long to get here with the child, yet here he was, waiting outside an orphanage even after the sun had gone down.
"You mean to say he couldn't kill a child?" Black said sharply. "That after all the people he's tortured and murdered, he couldn't kill a baby?"
"Right," Draco said. Now he had two things that he needed to name, and he was very close to just choosing the first name that popped into his head and calling it a day, but he had always been a bit of a perfectionist. He wanted the names to suit them, to
With the orb lighting up the area, it was easier to see the attic. It had been too dark to see anything properly all the times he had been sent there previously and only then he could truly appreciate how dirty it was. Scattered around the room were various objects covered with white sheets and a thick layer of dust, left there and forgotten.
This meant that Lewis thought that he superior to the other orphans, terrorising them and stealing their possessions. He wasn't particularly big, or strong, or smart, but he had power and he knew how to use it, which meant that most of the other orphans were terrified of him. He particularly disliked Draco, especially after that incident where his hair had turned an alarming shade of green when Draco had caught him snooping around his journal.
It had only been a few hours since the death of the Malfoys and the disappearance of the Dark Lord, and the wizarding world was already dissolving into chaos. Partygoers lined the streets, drunkenly setting off fireworks and cheering loudly. Even the students of Hogwarts were joining in, crying and hugging each other in the hallways.
"Ok, um. Uh, what was that thing you did with your... wand? It's a wand, right? It's not called anything else is it?"
Then it flew in and booped Draco on the nose. While the boy was stunned, it drew back and flew lazy circles around his head, hiding in his hair and playing with his fringe. Once Draco had calmed down a little, he realised that it wasn’t a perfect circle like he had originally thought, it was more of a blobby shape, constantly changing, never remaining the same.
Then, without warning, the owl launched off Lewis's head and flew towards Draco, making him yelp in surprise and scramble backwards off the bench, landing in a heap on the floor. The owl rolled its eyes and dropped the letter it was holding onto the table where Draco had been sitting, then took off out an open window. Rubbing the back of his head where he had hit it on the floor, he pushed himself back onto the bench and looked around for the letter, grimacing in disgust when he found it.
"I'm staying with you. I like you," she said, giving him a pointed look as she climbed down his shirt, earning herself a high-pitched squeak from Draco. "But don't let me be seen. Can't stand that human. She kills all the rats. And before you go, make sure you pull the cloth back over the clock. It keeps the spiders out."
"Magic," Severus said, twirling his wand, allowing a few sparks to shoot out of the end. To him, it was a mere parlour trick, nothing more, but to Draco, who had grown up among muggles, it was impossible. He stepped closer. "It's magic. I'm a wizard.
He held an arm across his face so that his mouth and nose were covered, lifting the cloth carefully, the disrupted dust floating up into the air like a cloud.
"Because he would be worshipped," said Dumbledore, looking seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?"
"Well," Dumbledore said finally, "that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
The snake nodded in understanding. "So it's like that time my nestmate ate a strange bug and died afterwards. Are you going to die too?"
Draco sneezed again and the glowing orb, now named Lux (a word he had seen in one of the Latin books that were dotted around the orphanage, and it seemed fitting) that had taken to floating worriedly around his head jumped a little in the air as he did, as if the sound had startled it.
Draco pushed himself up off the floor and stretched, feeling the joints in his aching legs pop as he dusted off his jeans. He walked towards the nearest object, a tall, rectangular shaped thing covered with the same white cloth, bound with a rope around the middle. The orb followed him, lighting up the way as it zoomed excitedly around his head.
He sat at his table, spooning through his bowl of bland porridge. He sighed and raised his spoon to his mouth, dejectedly getting ready to shove the slop into his mouth when the screaming started. Startled, he dropped his spoon and looked around the dining room, searching for the source of the panic.
Taking a deep breath, Severus composed himself and turned back to Draco Malfoy, lifting his gaze to stare at Dumbledore.
"Which idiot dares to awaken me?" The snake said, tilting its flat head, the s's long and pronounced. Draco's eyes widened and he screamed, scrambling away from the snake. The orb floated closer to the snake, then reluctantly flew back to its previous place in Draco's hood.
The snake, which he still hadn't thought of a name for, had wound herself around his torso and was perched over his shoulder, twisting her head around so she could stare at his face.
that always seemed to happen around him, the times when he would close his eyes and when he opened them again, he would be standing in a completely different place. Or like the time Lewis and his friends had stolen all his clothes and he had been forced to walk around in his pyjamas, he had wished so hard that they would stop laughing and their mouths had immediately closed as if they had been zipped up.
She was barely wider than Draco's pinkie, and couldn't be longer than ten centimetres. Her scales were a silvery-green colour, transitioning into a yellow as it neared her belly.
Severus frowned. Muggleborns, or in Draco's case, magical children who grew up with muggles, weren't supposed to receive a Hogwarts letter via owl. It must've been one of the rare, but not impossible, errors in the Hogwarts mailing system, and he resolved to have it checked once he returned.
"I believe you know the reason I am here today?" He asked, being careful not to look at Malfoy, though with the way he was squirming in his seat, it was quite difficult.
"That 'swooshy thing', as you so eloquently put it, was a Muffling Charm," Severus said dryly, the imaginary inverted commas almost tangible. "It's a spell that creates a buzzing sound in the ears of anyone who's in the vicinity, so we that have privacy."
"Well? Go on, open it," he said, suppressing the smile that threatened to split across his face at the ferocity the boy tore into his letter, eyes skimming it hungrily.
. Once he was satisfied that no outsiders could overhear their conversation, he turned back to Malfoy, who was watching him, his head tilted, face expressionless.
"Snakes do not have names like you walkers do," the snake said, her tongue flicking in and out. "But I suppose you may name me if it makes you happy."
With a creak, the trapdoor opened and light poured into the room, illuminating what had previously been in almost complete darkness. Matron Anna's head poked out from the doorway, a scowl visible on her face.
At that moment, the wizarding community would celebrate the defeat of the worst Dark Lord they had seen in centuries, and throughout it all, they would whisper one name with awe and joy: Draco Malfoy, the boy who lived.
"Alright then, I'm assuming that the owl that dropped a letter into my porridge today morning also has something to do with this whole wizard business?"
Matron Anna had always favoured Lewis. Draco had seen the countless treats and gifts she'd sneak to him when she thought no one was watching, had seen the hugs she would give him when he went to her room when a particularly bad thunderstorm hit, had seen the kisses she placed on his forehead when she tucked the children in.
Yo I just noticed that some things don't add up in the previous chapters so I'm going to go back and edit them. Apologies if ao3 keeps saying that I've updated when there aren't any new chapters. KUDOS AND COMMENT PLEASE THEY ARE MY LIFEBLOOD
"What?" Draco blinked. Then, as the scene in front of him finally registered, he launched himself backwards with a yelp, trying to put as much distance between him and the orb. The orb followed him. It flitted around, drawing closer to Draco as he scrambled away, stopping only when he felt his back press against the wooden planks of the roof. The orb floated closer until it was barely a few inches in front of his face.
Severus Snape ran a hand down his face, releasing a heavy sigh. He leaned against the wall of a building, watching the entrance to the driveway carefully. The Disillusionment Charm he had placed on himself was starting to wear off, so he refreshed it, rubbing at his tired eyes.
Ron stopped dead in the street, mouth hanging open, and stared at Harry. After a moment, he said rather weakly, “She does?”
"Hey," Ron said, tentatively, nudging Harry in the shoulder. He looked almost afraid to disturb him. "Mum says it's nearly dinnertime, if you're, uh, done with that fork there."
'Perfect,' Hermione interrupts.  'It's about time you start helping with meals.  We all take turns.  You can have Thursdays—'
, Harry,” Dumbledore replied. “And do tell Ronald and Hermione that I appreciate their help as well.”
Harry had been expecting flying, maybe, or a Christmas gift; perhaps even laughing at Harry in Potions class. What he had not expected was Lucius Malfoy. "Then think about your father. Picture his, um, face. And I guess he's smiling, then. Does he smile? I suppose he must. So yeah, your father, he's smiling, and he's—he's—not killing anybody, and he's not kissing Voldemort's feet, and he's, um, your father. Your happy memory. Okay. Think about that."
'Now that you mention it,' Malfoy said, as if it had just occurred to him, wavering on his feet. Harry wasted no time pushing him back into the armchair that appeared, then sat down in his own.
“What? What d’you mean?” He had sudden thoughts of Tonks and her mother hiding in 12 Grimmauld Place, and the idea made him ill.
Harry stares at him.  When they went to bed the night before, Malfoy curled up beneath his duvet in wary silence, despite the fact that Harry has spent the past two and a half months listening to Malfoy complain incessantly about dust and Hedwig and vicious wardrobes and the size of Harry's shirts and blisters and Fleur Delacour and how much he despises casserole. Harry wasn't sure if Malfoy's silent treatment merited an apology or further mistrust, and in the end, he too went to sleep having offered neither.
'I'm not the one who came here for something,' Harry says.  'Tell me why you owled me, Malfoy, or I'm leaving.  And I don't plan on untying you, either.'
To retaliate, he'd taken to being as horrifyingly open as possible: it made Malfoy splutter and turn an indignant, embarrassed pink every single time.
you, Potter," Malfoy hissed, so enraged that Harry almost backed down. He had never seen Malfoy quite this upset, even at the end of fifth year. "I
'And to,' Harry shrugged, 'to say that I'm sorry. About Cra—' He remembered just in time and amended, 'Vincent. And everybody else. You don't have to leave.'
Across from Harry, Hermione looked disapproving. 'That's the least of our worries,' she said. 'This is a serious concern, Sir Nicholas! How would you feel if your whole house disappeared?'
'It came from Harry's mouth,' he argues, 'it can't be any worse for Malfoy than it is for Harry.  Anyway, people swap spit all the time—'  But he stops and turns crimson as he realizes that he is nearly suggesting that Harry and Malfoy swap spit.  'Eurgh,' Ron says.  'Sorry, Harry.  Now that's unhygienic.'
He also received an envelope from Mrs. Creevey, holding a letter that she seemed to have cried on more than once and a handful of glossy photographs. Harry did not want to look at them, but he did anyway: they were of him, and his friends, and other people from Gryffindor, people whose names he didn't know but thought he should. He looked at them until he felt sick, because he realized that it had been two months and he still didn't know if Parvati Patil was alive or dead.
'I can live with him, the great stupid git,' Ron said bitterly, after Hermione gave him a pointed look. 'But I still think I ought to be able to punch him another couple times.'
Hermione scrubbed furiously at the mirror she was cleaning. Her reflection rippled as the surface bucked under her rag. "Oh, well, that's all right, Harry," she said distractedly, and glared at Ron again before turning back to her work.
'Okay, I'll meet you by the doors.' She put her hand on his arm as she passed. 'You look happy, Harry. I'm glad.'
'Oh, now you need us,' Malfoy said, his eyes glittering. He was looking at Harry now, and he took several steps forward until they were almost touching, his mouth an ugly, angry shape. 'Now that you, what, need to fill a quota of despicable wizards who are just tolerable enough to be allowed to live, and of course you thought of me first, because I'm not bad enough to be dangerous, I'm just petty and cruel enough to fit your mold?' He was standing so close and speaking so furiously that a few flecks of his spit actually landed on Harry.
“Gryffindor’s got the Quaffle!” shouted Stewart Ackerley, a Ravenclaw who had taken over commenting from Lee Jordan. “That’s seventh year Katie Bell with the Quaffle—and Pritchard’s after her, but—oh, narrowly misses a Bludger from Goyle! Nicely done, Bell—a pass to Ginny Weasley—there she goes—"
'Thanks for coming, all of you,' Hermione begins, beckoning Harry towards her.  He sidles a couple steps and she says impatiently, 'Harry, get up here.  You probably all know why you're here by now, but—well, we've been working on defeating Voldemort—'  A kind of hushed ripple goes through the crowd, and Hermione makes an annoyed sound.  'Yes,
Harry glanced around the busy hall, suddenly aware of just how long he had eaten breakfast there without a thought. It still reminded him of the casualties the last battle had claimed, but now, glancing at the staff table, Harry thought most of Snape. The way he had looked at Harry the very first night at Hogwarts, black eyes piercing, as if he were combing through Harry's mind . . .
But Ron had overestimated, and the Quaffle shot right through his open arms and into the left hoop. “SLYTHERIN SCORE,” Ackerley roared, and the Slytherin stands erupted in cheers.
'We got our Order of Merlin medals,' Ron protested, flopping into a chair at last. 'And we went to two Chudley games.'
Harry says, rather taken aback, 'Er, hello again, Gabrielle.'  Across the room, Ginny rolls her eyes at him, which makes him feel slightly cheered.  He is about to ask about the progress of the wedding plans when Fleur makes a noise that sounds halfway between a hiss and a snarl.
'But that doesn't change a thing,' Malfoy said. 'It isn't just Slytherin. I tortured people—I tried to
He’d felt relieved, mostly, that he apparently wasn’t expected to navigate the further awkward mechanics of pleasing her in return, as the most he knew came from several sloppy kisses with Cho, one botched attempt to put his hand on her breast when it actually ended up somewhere on her ribcage, and the suggestions of Seamus’s more sordid magazines, which Ron sometimes stole from him and waved around the room, shouting things like, “Will you look at those knockers, Harry, she’s bloody stacked!”
It turned out to be a portent of sorts: the next day, he rounded the corner from the Charms corridor and came across Malfoy cornered like a snarling cat, surrounded by several other students. Harry recognized some of them. His first instinct was to turn away, but then he recalled the expression of pure panic on Malfoy's face in his dream and did not. 'Hey!' he said loudly.
'He deserves to be Kissed,' she snarled, nails digging into his arm. 'Harry Potter, do something, why didn't you testify, why didn't you tell them—despicable—deserves to die—'
Harry remembered the way that Pansy had once shaken her head and said, 'I can't,' which he had thought strange at the time. Now he wondered if Malfoy had done the same to her.
The lube was slippery on his fingers and Harry couldn’t help the soft noise in the back of his throat as he smeared it over his cock; then he was scared, for a moment, leaning over Draco and not knowing what to do. His right hand slid down to press against Draco’s thigh, and he said jaggedly, “Draco,” harsh, and then again, as if as an afterthought, and pushed forward.
Despite a string of miserable Potions classes, the first weeks of the term flew by, so that by the time that autumn settled in with a vengeance and the grass on the Quidditch pitch during morning practices was stiff with frost, Harry had filed Dudley into the same category of Cedric, that of nightmares and late-night guilt, but little else. He sent a letter by Muggle post to his aunt and uncle, but he’d got no response, and he hadn’t really expected one.
Draco is snoring faintly, head on his chest, and looks like a slumbering angel. His hair is in his face. Harry has to seize him by the elbow to wake him up and drag him bodily into the relief of cold white nothing. Draco is not fully awake until they plunge into the frigid water of the lily pond, shadowed by the darkness of the meeting room.
Harry felt his face begin to heat up. He wished he hadn’t just grabbed the first shirt he found, a faded white t-shirt Oliver Wood had left behind in the Quidditch lockers after third year that Harry had taken by accident and forgot to return. It was well-worn by now; one of the sleeves had begun to unravel, and it was too small in the shoulders. He rubbed his forehead self-consciously, mumbling an awkward “Thank you” at the two witches who pushed a box of Honeydukes chocolates at him and scurried from the room. When all the rest had gone, he glanced at Lupin, who looked amused.
They're all still for a second, and then Malfoy cocks his head and frowns, as if considering.  He narrows his eyes.  'What do I get?'
“Well, fine,” Harry said, making a big show of pulling off its cover and climbing onto it. It gleamed at him under a thin layer of dust, and he blew gently on the controls, wiping at them with his sleeve. One of the switches read INVISIBILITY in large black letters. “Look, I’ll go, and I’ll just tell you about it when I get back—"
Pansy stared at him. 'Fine,' she said at last, sounding as if it were a struggle. 'Potter, I'm—sorry. I didn't really—mean it.'
Were things always this awkward? First she’d been all over him, and now he was sitting here, still aroused despite his embarrassment, and she was offering to talk about Defense. “It’s all right,” he said, hesitantly, still red.
'I didn't say you did,' Harry muttered. Malfoy was looking at him again, and he fidgeted under the scrutiny. 'Well, um, good, then. I'll see you at the party?'
Ron rubbed his hands together in the chill and said dryly, “Parkinson stole a book from some first years? And that’s exciting why?”
“Calm down, Harry,” Dumbledore said gently. “Tonks and her mother are here for a reason. If you refuse to listen to their explanation, perhaps you would permit me to clarify my purposes for bringing you—"
'What he didn't know, I told him,' Harry shrugs, sticking his hands in his pockets as his thoughts drift to what Dumbledore had told Harry in return.  Dumbledore had, after all, trusted Snape until the very moment that Snape betrayed him, and by then it would have been too late to change the Pensieve's protection . . . but the fresh memory of Dumbledore's familiar, enigmatic smile makes Harry wonder if there is something he still doesn't know . . . if Dumbledore's overly optimistic faith in people had not, after all, proven him wrong in the end . . .
Professor McGonagall had agreed to announce the match, and donned her tartan cloak in honor of the occasion. She was nowhere near as partial a commentator as Lee Jordan, or as hilarious as Luna, but she was shrewd and accurate with her narration of the plays. Only four goals were scored, however, by the time Harry caught the Snitch in one hand, at least a meter in front of Malfoy's grasping fingers.
"Snape was like a father to me," Malfoy said, bitterly, and then, without looking up, added, "Now you've managed to take away both of them, haven't you?"
“I know it seemed like all she wanted was to talk about Cedric,” Hermione went on. “But she didn’t know who else to go to. And you know she’s just broken up with Michael. She probably wanted to apologize.”
As usual with Malfoy, it was crystal clear when he was hiding something, but Harry let it go for the time being. 'Fine, fair enough,' he said. 'So that's it, then? You'll get me off if I'll get you off, that sort of thing?'
To his surprise, Ron's face cleared at once. 'Well, that's easy enough,' he declared. 'Charlie likes blokes!'
He finally dozed off watching Sirius poke his feather up James's nostrils, and when he woke again, the room was yellow-warm with sunlight and he could hear Ron clumping up the stairs to wake him for breakfast.
Empty, Harry looked up at Draco. He couldn't think through the sound of the pounding of his heart. "So why aren't you a Death Eater then, Malfoy?" he asked dully. "Why aren't you out there murdering people, if Muggle-born are so bad? Why did you save me from Tonks, if you think all of this?"
,' Malfoy crowed, every bit as pleased as Crookshanks was when he caught a mouse. 'Potter, this girl is a natural. Got the brute to tackle her and then feigned a broken wrist, tears and all. They were fake, of course. She takes after me, that way.'
'That will not be necessary,' Mrs. Weasley says, sounding icier than Harry has ever heard her.  'We simply can't fit one more person in this house, Harry.  There's just no room, you see.  All of Fleur's relatives are here—it's quite hectic—'
“Well!” Cho exclaimed, looking startled and hurt. “I didn’t tell on you last year, Harry, you know I wouldn’t have! And I’m—I’m sorry about Sirius Black, I read about him in the Daily Prophet, and Hermione told me—"
The sun was filtering in the windows when Harry woke, neck sore, back aching. He could hear birdsong somewhere, and glancing beside him, he saw Hermione and Ron, still asleep but holding hands across the table. He smiled, and that's when he remembered about Malfoy, and stopped.
For a moment, Harry’s temper warred with how much he wanted to look at the rest of the pictures, and he glared down at the box, his vision blurring. But, after a moment, he only sighed and picked up the next one, setting it down rather forcefully on the table.
'Still,' Hermione says.  'Still, it's a start.  Bringing people together, that's the only way we can fight this, you know?  Like the Triwizard Tournament, like the, like the house elves, the giants, everyone.  Oh Harry, don't you see?  Voldemort sows dissent and mistrust, didn't Dumbledore say that?  That's why we've got to stick together, we've got to unite.  It's just the opposite of what his Horcruxes do.'
Harry advanced on him, an exhilarating thrill of anger shooting through his body. “I don’t ever want to hear you talk about Sirius again,” he hissed. “Do you hear me?”
Which is how Harry finds them a second later when he wanders downstairs for a snack, then takes a step back at the look on Hermione's face.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, and then, softer, “Malfoy.” There was something sleepy and subdued about the way Malfoy was lying, and Harry was overcome by the urge to brush his hand over Malfoy’s jaw, slide a thumb over his cheekbone. He wondered what Malfoy would do.
Harry looked at him, at Draco, lying there under the fluorescence of the lights. Something tightened inside him, unfamiliar and strange, at the way Draco’s eyes fluttered closed, the near-content expression on his pointed face. He was warm and bony against Harry, and he carried so many complications that anyone sane could have told Harry he was being reckless to the point of danger, and Harry wanted nothing more, in that particular moment, than this. He didn’t know if this was love, this strange ache in the pit of his stomach, the way he bled relief at the very notion that they weren’t fighting anymore. He felt different, though. No, not different, just—more himself, maybe. He wasn’t sure if that was it, but it sounded all right.
Harry suddenly remembered Professor Kothari telling him sadly that she lamented Snape’s death as a colleague, and something itched, some missing link. He frowned. “I know I heard something about her, what was it? I was . . . reading . . . oh! Draco’s letter!”
"But we have." The water is seeping into them, cold and wet, pulling them down. Harry wonders for a fleeting moment what would happen if he drowned himself; he would be a dead portrait. But he doesn't want to die falsely. Not again. "We all do, don't we? That's what this is about."
“Then Bellatrix arrived and we fought and I Stunned her again,” Harry said flatly. “And then I saw Malfoy—Tonks—I don’t know, and I tried to kill him. Her. I, but I couldn’t, and then you came. That’s all.”
'No,' Harry said. 'You got lucky. Because of Remus. And because of me and Ron and Hermione. Because I was there on that tower and because you didn't acknowledge us at your house and because we—because I didn't want you to die. It's not Voldemort who let you live, Malfoy, it was our side after all.'
, and he instinctively leaned in and pressed a dry kiss to the place just under Draco’s knee, before kneeling there and reaching out, almost scared, with slick-wet fingers.
“Some tea?” he continued to offer. “Are you bleeding? I’m sure I could find their address, if you need to contact them—Vernon Dursley, wasn’t it, bit of a large man—"
“But how could your dad put up with that?” Harry asked, setting his DA notes on the table. “I’ll be he’s relieved she doesn’t write anymore. I would be.”
"What other alternatives do you have?" Harry demanded, at the same instant that he realized Draco might have a whole House of alternatives, that he could stay with Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise . . .
'Well, I don't care about you either,' Harry said, just as Madam Pince swooped down at them and screeched,
She winked at Harry; he wondered if she had perhaps nipped a shot or two of Firewhisky before leaving Slytherin. 'Yes,' Pansy continued gleefully, 'imagine Draco's horror when she said she was going with
"The Weasel and Granger, no wonder the Dementors run away," Malfoy drawled, seemingly unaware of Harry's sudden discomfort at the thought of Sirius. "All right, then, if you insist. I'll think about my father."
It took him less than half an hour to give in and climb out of bed again, creak his door open softly, and tiptoe back across to Draco’s room.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry spots Katie Bell talking with two girls who have their backs to him.  He takes this opportunity to seize Malfoy by the sleeve and drag him towards Katie.  'Potter,' Malfoy says petulantly, 'stop mauling me, what do you want?'
It was all Harry could do to sit up, his cock throbbing; he felt feverish, flushed and shivering both; the palms of his hands on the map were sticky with sweat, and he looked down in a daze at the little dots, the letters spelling out GINNY WEASLEY, which did not seem quite as important any longer—
“In the morning,” Remus said gently. “It can wait. For now, I am going to bed, and so should you.” Glancing over Harry’s shoulder, he added, “And you, Draco. Good night, boys.” And with that, he gave Harry some small, sad look and turned away down the hall.
She sat up with a start, pushing her hair out of her face. 'Oh, Harry, I must have fallen asleep. I was just reviewing some of my notes for Potions in case Slughorn gives us a surprise exam tomorrow . . .'
'Shh,' Malfoy said, sharp and sudden. Pansy had not stopped clinging to him, and he hadn't pulled away. 'Potter, give us a minute, will you? Go loiter somewhere else.'
Harry bore her fussing patiently; even now, she thought of him as fragile, someone who needed to rest, always that word, rest. She hurried most of the guests out the door, even Ginny, who made a truly terrible face behind her mother's back. Andromeda was the last to leave, Teddy bundled up in her arms, and finally only Harry, Ron and Hermione were left.
That night, he purposely didn’t clear his mind before sleeping, but instead of thinking of Voldemort, his mind seemed intent on imagining Lucius Malfoy, in the midst of dueling with an Auror, maybe even Dumbledore’s brother. Harry imagined him laughing and felt sick. Was that the imagine in Malfoy’s mind when he conjured his Patronus? The same man he idolized enough to scare off a Dementor was the one who terrorized Muggles and was responsible for Aberforth’s death. In the picture in Harry’s mind, the figure of Lucius became shorter, and shifted into his son. He looked at Harry, eyes blazing, wand extended towards him.
"Why would I have time to pay attention to Hufflepuffs? They're all useless, and most of them have spots."
But at Scrimgeour's name, a thought occurs to Harry.  'Hermione,' he says.  The smile on his face is grim but triumphant, and he feels a strange pride at getting something right, even if it's not Malfoy.  'I'll get them made.'
“You’re telling me that trusting Malfoy, even if he’s got his dad’s best interests in mind, is going to make me stronger?” Harry said loudly. “That’s ridiculous.”
She looked wet and bedraggled and almost unrecognizable without her familiar smile, but when she saw him, it peeked out. Dressed in shocking red robes, with her hair blonde and spiky, she stood there dripping and grinned at Harry. “Quite the snowstorm out there,” she said, stomping her feet a few times. Harry noticed that she was wearing the same large boots she’d been wearing at the Three Broomsticks. “Weather’s not like this in London, I can tell you that much. Anyway, I’m back for good, didn’t Remus tell you?”
“Pay attention to what?” Hermione said. “If it was in the summer, it wasn’t Lucius Malfoy and his gang.”
'Wrong,' Harry said stiffly. 'We would have protected you. Dumbledore would have, and I would have, too.'
No one was awake in Gryffindor when he arrived back in the Tower; even the Fat Lady was snoring, and he had to shout at her several times before she woke with a start. Inside, the room was dim and silent, though after scanning it once, Harry realized there was a familiar figure slumped on a table by the window.
'I'd give you at least ten days.'  Harry glances over his shoulder at the kitchen, then smiles wryly.  'After that, I can't be accountable for Ron.'
“I suppose,” Ron said reluctantly. “Hey, speaking of the Order, have you heard from Tonks, Harry? She wasn’t hurt?”
'She said Malfoy told her I would help him,' Harry says.  'She said that.  Why would she come to me otherwise?'
'She did,' Malfoy confided, nodding seriously at Harry. 'Fifth year. It was revolting. She'd put on so much perfume before the Prefects meetings that everyone thought Slytherin was infested with Dungbombs, and I had to sit there watching her drool at him across the table . . .'
“Oh,” Hermione said, looking rather embarrassed herself, “well, yes, that’s just it. Why would Pansy Parkinson need a book like that?”
Harry looked Draco squarely in the eye and steeled himself not to back down, even when his gaze crashed against those emotionless walls. Voice as steady as he could make it, he said, "Why did you want to be my friend?"
'I don't want to make her go,' Harry said a bit guiltily, already leading Ron off towards McGonagall's office. 'Oh, yeah, bye, Gin. See you at dinner. Anyway, after what happened last year, I thought maybe she wouldn't want to go back there—'
'Fine,' Harry said, conveniently forgetting that he was the one calling it off in the first place. 'Go have Pansy get you off, then, if that's what you think!'
Draco turned back to give him a withering stare. “Potter, I haven’t played Gobstones since I was twelve. Is that what you Gryffindors do for a good time?”
"Maybe since you stopped," Draco shoots back. "Those last days, you were so—it was like you were already dead. I thought it would be different after."
'Of course you did,' Ron muttered. After thinking for a moment, he added hopefully, 'No chance of Gringotts being regenerative too, is there?'
‘Come here and take your clothes off,’ Harry countered, tugging his own shirt over his head. He was gratified when Malfoy promptly went pink and did as he said.
Ron spent the rest of the meal discussing how happy he was, with occasional mutters about how complicated women were. Harry nodded several times in a show of support.
Ginny shrugged. 'As long as you pass your N.E.W.T.s. Hey, Harry, don't you have a free period now? Flitwick's cancelled Charms because some fourth-year blew half the classroom up. Want to go down to the lake?'
Taken aback, Harry was silent for a moment. “My friends died too,” he said eventually, but there was something halfhearted about it, and he kicked at the edge of the wooden chair in front of him.
“I don’t know,” Harry said again. “I don’t know if he’s going to be a Death Eater or not. I don’t know if he’d hesitate to kill me if he had the chance. But I do know that he isn’t Lucius Malfoy. He’s his own person, Hermione.”
”Actually, Malfoy, I do,” she said evenly. “And luckily, none of them were bought with money, so it wouldn’t matter if I ran out.”
“He wants to attack somewhere that will be noticeable by wizards and Muggles alike. I don’t doubt it will be his re-entry point into England. And, if I may be so presumptuous, there is something else. You see, Harry,” Dumbledore said solemnly, “Hay-On-Wye is where I was born.”
“It seems that your Metamorphmagus abilities were too much for Voldemort to pass up,” Dumbledore interrupted. “Alastor’s report notes that they were quite persistent.”
“This is my side of the story,” Harry snapped. “I’m the one he pulled out of Hogsmeade just before the attack. I’m the one who was fooled, all this time.”
'Oh, please, I was the one you had running all over the castle delivering witless insults to each other.' She wiped her eyes and tried to imitate Ron: 'Go and tell Harry that I'm not speaking to him. What, you already did? Tell him again. And tell him I don't care if he's not speaking to me! What? He said I was rubbish as a friend? Well he's rubbish! Go and tell him that!'
To Harry's shock, a serene blonde woman stepped out of the shadows, her mouth in an expression of distaste and her profile near-identical to Andromeda's. 'Auntie Walburga,' Narcissa Malfoy said calmly, ignoring Mrs. Black's squawk of surprise. 'That is enough.'
She was lying under him, one arm braced against his chest, the other wielding a handful of snow; her red hair spilled out against the snow-covered ground. Her grin faded a little as she caught him looking and in turn realized the position they were in. He could almost see her eyes turning sad.
'Well, what did you think I came here for?' Harry said, irritated. 'This isn't a social call, Malfoy.'
“Go away,” Harry hissed, turning sharply towards the window. Outside, snow was beginning to fall, and he could hear the wind whipping around the towers. It was a bleak scene, sullen and defiant, and it fit Harry’s mood exactly.
“Hermione’s the best witch in the school,” Harry hissed right back. “She’s better at everything than you, so I don’t see how pure blood has anything to do with it.”
They both glanced across the room to where Ron was sitting with Jack and going over notes they had taken on the Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff match. He was grinning and saying something derisive about Zacharias Smith, which Harry could not hear entirely but knew was not pleasant. He swallowed.
Harry marches over to him and wrests the box of chocolates away, tossing them in the bin without a second glance.  Across the table, Ron's small sound of protest dies halfway from his lips.  'I want to know where Snape is,' Harry says, tight and dangerous.
Draco was silent for a long moment. Then he said, sounding more curious than malicious, “Did Granger cry when she heard?”
'I ran into Pansy Parkinson in Diagon Alley today.'  Harry shrugs.  'She sort of threw herself at me.'
Harry looked at him, at the wan and unhappy expression on his face. It was possible that Malfoy had learned the lesson Harry had learned with Sirius's death: parents and adults did not make you safe.
'Are you going to do it again?' Hermione said. She was eyeing Harry knowingly; he thought she'd overheard more than she'd admitted, that one Potions class.
“So it’s better that I saw it,” Harry said. “Isn’t it? Without my dream, we wouldn’t have known? So isn’t it better if I don’t close my mind, if I can still see what Voldemort does sometimes—you said yourself that he couldn’t bear being in me, because he can’t stand love—shouldn’t I try to see more?“
'I'm not here to get him today or anything,' Harry reassures her.  'He, Lucius Malfoy I mean, I don't think he knows anything about this yet.  I just wanted to, to come by.'
and a sick sense of relief floods Harry.  He is perversely grateful that he doesn't have to be the one to break the news.
Harry laughed. “Bad luck then, but maybe it helped us win a Quidditch match later. You know, gave them some good practice.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful, Harry,” Hermione said immediately. “I always thought the DA and Defense class shouldn’t work separately. Make sure you tell her about the Patronuses!”
“Who do you think is here?” Ginny whispered, eyes curious and bright. “Do you think it’s Dumbledore? What are they doing?”
"Well, well," Snape intoned, folding his arms, glaring as sourly as Harry expected. "You are the incompetent idiots who managed to fail your OWLs so spectacularly, I see. I typically only accept those students proficient enough to receive an O. Without the Headmaster’s intervention, none of you would have the privilege of attending.” It seemed that his eyes bored right into Harry.
‘You could try—’ Harry and Ron had attempted to broach with her, in those early years, but she always shook her head and said, brittle, ‘No. I can’t.’
Harry grinned. 'Want to start an Inter-House Quidditch league? Not for the House Cup or anything, just an intramural sort of thing. You could be captain, and me, and we'd have to get two others. We could find out who would be interested and pick teams.'
As if in response, Ron folds his arms.  'You can throw all the parties you want for Malfoy,' he says.  'This, we're trying me and Harry's way.  Mrs. Black, you uptight old cunt, if you don't tell us everything you know about Regulus, we're going to dip your portrait in turpentine.  And then we're, we're going to set it on fire.  And then we're going to paint a landscape on it and sell it to some Muggles.'
Harry sighed. 'No, Ron,' he said. 'Hermione's right. I have to do it. At least see what's going on.'
'The goblins had little choice, once Godric Gryffindor took the blade from Ragnuk the First,' Griphook said softly. 'In Gryffindor's time, he was well-respected, even among our kind. He was allowed to keep it, as a gift of sorts. They believed he would return it when he was through.'
'Pansy's been acting weird,' Harry said that night, leaning against the back of the door to Malfoy's dormitory, empty but for him. When Malfoy did not look all that interested in Pansy's behavior, normal or otherwise, Harry shrugged. 'I don't know, she's your friend. Did you have a good birthday?'
'I'm sick of everyone bothering me about not having a date,' Harry shrugged. 'I thought I'd take the long way up.'
?'  Malfoy's voice is rising, which is almost comical, but it's starting to rain in earnest.  Harry grabs him by the wrist and yanks him forward, hard.  Malfoy squeaks out, 'What do you think you're—'
'We be nice to him,' Hermione says decisively.  'Oh, Ron, don't give me that look.  After the way you've treated him, he almost deserves a nice turn—stop glaring at me, I think he's horrible too, you know I do—'
He gave her a quizzical look. 'Aren't you coming? Do you—' He could not blame her, he supposed, not if he truly thought about it, but it still hurt to swallow as he asked, 'You don't want to help get Malfoy?'
Harry gave him a wavering smile. “I don’t think they’d like that very much,” he said, and moved towards the bus. “Um, thanks, Mr. Weasley.”
'Hey,' Harry says, hands in his pockets.  Malfoy blinks a couple times, as if he can't quite focus.  'What are you doing out here by yourself?'
“They probably want to see if he has any leads on where his father is,” Hermione said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he did.”
“I ran into Tonks,” Harry explained, “and she told me she’d been in a meeting with Dumbledore, and they were talking about Wales. But she wouldn’t tell me anything else. Is that where the escaped Death Eaters are, Hagrid?”
“Unless they never catch him,” Harry continued, “but that doesn’t do you much good, does it? He’d still be a fugitive . . .”
'To a song insulting my best friend, yeah,' Harry started, but then Malfoy leaned in again and he stopped complaining. The only light was the
“This is brilliant,” Ron was saying. “No ‘Wands away’ from Tonks!” She seemed to have heard him, because she gave him a quick smile from where she stood, and he flashed one back. “You see that, mate? She’ll be on your side for sure.”
'Please,' Malfoy sneers.  'You only win because you've got a faster broom than everybody else.  It's got nothing to do with how good you are—'
Harry looked at him, then, this hunched figure in a chair, his mug of chocolate going cold; he looked vulnerable there, like a child. He felt a stab of the familiar longing and wanted, for a second, nothing more than to go to him and wrap him in his arms. Everything was confusing. He hated Draco. He didn’t. He—
Malfoy shot Harry a filthy look, but an instant later he was beaming up at Slughorn again, looking for all the world as if Slughorn were his long-time idol. 'What are we working on today, Professor?' Malfoy asked as Harry dumped his things on a desk further away. 'I did so enjoy your lessons last year, and I'm looking forward to repeating some of them, I'm sure there's always more to learn from you— '
'Maybe tomorrow will be better,' Harry suggested. He took a step closer to Malfoy, close enough that he could have reached out and taken him by the shoulders, if he had wanted to, but Malfoy was not looking at him.
Harry winced as he heard Sirius’s mother begin her wail anew. “WHO DARES DISTURB THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK WITH SUCH FILTHY MUGGLE-LOVING HANDS—" she began to screech, and then, just as Remus was rising from his seat with an ill-suffering sigh, she stopped.
It wasn't until Harry was seated at the Gryffindor table that evening that he realized that Draco Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Aside from the previous year, when Harry had not returned, there had never been a year when Malfoy had not sought him out on the train.
'Fine then. In the meantime, maybe you need something to take your mind off it,' Hermione suggested, bright as could be.
“Yes,” Hermione said—rather more pointedly than necessary, Harry thought. “Anthony is a very sweet boy.”
“They’re going to attack a town because it’s on our border?” Ron said skeptically, but he lowered his voice when both Harry and Hermione gave him a sharp look. “Well, it doesn’t all add up, does it? Why would You-Know-Who be so interested in a place like that?”
And maybe he did love him, and what did it matter. Or maybe he didn’t, after all. What could he have known of love, in five short months of too many shadows and sidelong glances that never said enough?
Malfoy stared at him as if he had three heads. “Potter,” he said, as if explaining this to a very small child, “there’s nothing there but a wall.”
His heart was still thundering but he felt deflated. 'I don't—do you really think it'll make a difference? Going to Doge?'
Two weeks after Hogsmeade, a nondescript owl fluttered past Harry’s plate at dinner and dropped a parcel in his lap. He stuck it in his pocket without unwrapping it, though quizzical looks from Ron and Seamus prompted him to lie, “It’s from Lupin. It’s nothing, we just made a bet on something. A Muggle game.”
“I mean, Malfoy had a letter from his mum,” Harry said quickly, “and I read it. You know, I was looking for any signs he was working for Voldemort. It was all rubbish about decorating and France, but she did say that she’d heard, what was it? Positive things about Kothari?”
“He’s all right,” Vernon blustered over her weeping, “Petunia, he’s all right, the boy’s all right!” His mustache twitched tremendously, his cheeks reddening and his fists clenching and unclenching with nothing to do. “It’s a, a whatsamacallit, one of them—" Vernon lowered his voice—“spell thingers, it’s him, it’s Potter, I know it is!” Mustache flaring out more agitatedly, he bellowed, “Boy, you come down here, you get down here right now!”
Which was why Hermione insisted to him again at dinner that someone must intervene. Yet the next Potions class, and the next, only the six of them appeared. Professor Kothari seemed hardly to notice, and taught them as cheerfully as if she had had a classroom full of hundreds.
“I DIDN’T KNOW,” Draco shouted again, his voice raw with fury. “Do you think I’m glad about it? Professor Snape died and that was my fault! I could have told him, I could have told anyone! And you wouldn’t shut your mouth about how sorry you were, how it was all your fault, how it was all up to you to save the world, you were blaming yourself left and right; well, Potter, now you know! It’s not your fault, it’s mine!“
'Too bad.' The smirk on Malfoy's face was so smug Harry felt like knocking the whole box out of his hands. 'I only give my sweets to those who deserve them.'
There was a loud noise that sounded suspiciously like Neville throwing a book at it, and Harry groaned gratefully. He suspected Seamus was in the shower, which meant that any minute now, they would all be treated to his off-key renditions of old Irish drinking songs, most of the words to which he didn’t actually know.
'I'll need a lot more than that,' Harry muttered, recalling with a sinking feeling that he had left most of his school things at Privet Drive before departing. Returning to Hogwarts after the war had been the furthest thing from his mind; he had barely dared to hope that he would survive.
'Sorry, sir,' Dobby says, his bat-like ears drooping.  'But Harry Potter, the Secret Keeper is Professor Dumbledore himself, sir!'
'You weren't there,' Malfoy blurted and then stared so hard at the opposite wall Harry thought he might be trying to wandlessly jinx it.
'How do we know you're not lying?' Ron demands.  His gaze flies to Harry, then back to Malfoy.  'Harry says you're good at Occlumency, you could be hiding it from us!  And if you're not helping us, you could very well be working for—for V—for V-Voldemort!'
“Great,” Harry said, who didn’t care if Ron couldn’t hear him. When Ron looked confused, he shouted flatly, “GREAT, I SAID,” and Ron gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up.
'Well, there's only one thing to do,' Hermione says, taking the locket out of Harry's hand and examining it.  'We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.  Harry, I suggest that you wear it.  And in the meantime—'
This turn of conversation was making Harry increasingly uncomfortable. He sighed. “He’s still Lucius Malfoy’s son,” he said. “Sometimes I want to hex him senseless, he’s so—
“Welcome to the House of Black, then,” Harry said, but he stopped as he saw the way Draco was glancing around the room inquisitively. “Have you been here before?”
“As if—I could,” Draco hissed out, his eyes locked with Harry’s. His hands flew up almost involuntarily to grasp Harry’s hips, dragging him closer.
'Dead, of course,' said Griphook. He was smiling, a bloodthirsty little smirk. 'We were distracted by your escape, and the repairs to the nearby vaults took over a month. By the time we searched for him, he was little more than skin and bones, the worms had taken him.' He raised his long, tapered fingers and twisted his beard between them. 'What was that phrase, again? Oh, yes, for a greater good . . .'
'Is that so, Mr. Malfoy?' she inquired, sharp amusement in her tone when he leapt back from Penelope as if caught at something far more forbidden. 'I recall hearing the same statement just after I gave you a D on your human transfiguration essay. I do hope Professor Clearwater is having better success.'
It was empty aside from the two of them and the instant he entered, Malfoy seized him by the sleeve and pulled him into a stall, locking the door behind them. Harry stood there, breathing hard, unpleasantly aware that he was still quite turned on.
Harry picked it up, expecting Malfoy to slump in defeat, or spit at him and run, or something of that sort. What he was not expecting, however, was what Malfoy did, which was to leap at Harry with his fists.
Harry stared at them in shock for a moment. He supposed he had been a bit caught up in fourth year, what with the Triwizard Tournament, but how had he missed that development? But then, he hadn’t known about Hermione’s friendship with Viktor Krum until the whole school knew. And besides, he doubted that, in fourth year, he could have even said who Anthony Goldstein was.
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Yeah, um, I'd like that. Gawain Robards, Mr. Robards, he said they'd take me if I came with the right N.E.W.T.s.'
Hermione raised an eyebrow. 'A worthwhile use of your time, I'm sure. Oh, here, Andromeda, I'll take Teddy, I've missed him.'
Malfoy actually smiled, one of those strange and complicated little smirks; Harry had never seen one this close up. 'Yeah,' he said, 'so how about that mutually beneficial arrangement, Potter?'
'Bet it's those Slytherins,' Ron said darkly. 'Which means Malfoy should be stomping around out there dealing with them, not us! Head Boy or not, it's a Slytherin concern.'
'Well, no, of course I don't,' Hermione conceded; she sighed. 'I wouldn't, you know that. But Ron doesn't! Apparently he thinks I'm such a, a
“Oh, d’you fancy her?” Ron asked immediately, grinning at him. “She’s the one with the glasses, isn’t she? Oh, no, that’s Mandy Brocklehurst. Lisa’s the one who looks kind of angry all the time, doesn’t she?”
Beneath him, Malfoy slumped. He was staring at Harry in something like shock, as if in the middle of some harsh realization. Finally, he gave a sullen sneer. “You’re the one who attacked me, Potter.”
'What?' Harry said; he didn't blame her, but this was a bit too far. 'How can you say that? I'm nice! I'm a nice person!'
'Probably not,' Harry says, giving the owl a handful of coins and taking the rolled-up paper.  He tosses it at Ron without opening it.  'Reckon Malfoy'll wear those weird dress robes of his again?  The ones that make him look like a vicar?'
