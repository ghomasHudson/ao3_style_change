I rubbed my eyes and yawned like a little kitten. I could see a worried Hermione and Ron rushing to my side in seconds, Luna and Draco following. "Harry are you alright?! Did he hurt you?!" Hermione asked as she ran a hand through my hair. Ron examined the upper half of my body, which was no longer covered by the blankets, the marks from last night now on full display.
"The sheets too?" He chuckled. I nodded. "Who knows what's on these sheets." I pulled out new ones from his closet and began to make his bed.
"I...well I just-"
"Oh yeah?! Draco Malfoy, you are not my boyfriend anymore!"
He leaned down and kissed the inside of my pale thighs. "You and your body are beautiful. Don't ever hide any body part from me. I'll never judge you for it and I'll never expose what you're trusting me with." I almost honestly cried. He was so sweet it made it impossible to think we were about to do it.
"Stop guuuyyssss." They continued until there was a knock at my door. Ron grabbed my arm and looped it through his and lead me to the door. He opened it widely and looked Draco up and down. He wore blue jeans and the same sweater I was wearing except he had a white button up underneath his. His shoes also matched mine. Hermione purposely matched us I see. His eyes were scanning me carefully until Ron cleared his throat.
"I'll move your hips for you at first okay?" I groaned and let him slowly move my hips back and forth, lifting me up just a bit every now and then. It took a total of ten minuets before I was able to handle it. Draco's hips were now thrusting up into me as he lifted my hips and slammed me down lightly to meet his thrust. He leaned his head on the headboard and kept thrusting. I was a moaning mess, barely able to keep it together.
"Tell me how you feeling princess."
I approached his door, earning stares from some of his house members who were passing me. We were allowed in each others dorm areas but it was kind of weird to enter the Night Watchers area. I shook it off and knocked on his door gently. It took no more than five seconds before he had opened the door, dressed in sweats and...no shirt.
He smirked and turned around to see Harry pushing his rainbow dildo inside of himself. His lover's face all scrunched up and red from the pleasure. Harry could never take the whole toy so it was hard to believe that Harry could take his boyfriend's length, which was bigger than the toy. He watched the brown haired boy push it in half way before pulling out and slamming back in hard and deep in himself. His plan was to get Draco so hard that he'd have no choice but to fuck him into the mattress but that didn't exactly happen. Harry began to get more needy than he wanted to. His cheeks flushed a dark pink as he started to feel really good. He wanted to temp Draco so bad but it started to turn into his own personal pleasure. He let out a shaky breathe while using the dildo to dig deeper to find his prostate. Every inch that went deeper made the smaller boy moan out cutely. He was starting to itch for something deeper and he knew who he wanted and he wanted him badly. He bit his lip trying to keep himself together.
I watched the submissive boy take my dick into his mouth slowly, this time his eyes were burning into mine as he did. I smirked, satisfied and leaned back up to face the class. They had luckily already started on their work and not paying me any attention. If they had been, they'd notice the small thrust I was doing to force my cock in and out of the warm mouth under the desk. None of that mattered anyway. Malfoy was pretty damn good at giving blowjobs and it almost made me cum. Almost. I wanted it deeper though and what better way than to choke his beautiful throat? I scooted the chair all the way under the desk and leaned my body forward. My cock was sitting in the tight wetness of my enemies' throat and I'd be a damn liar if I said it didn't feel like heaven. I almost moaned but I had to hide my face in my folded arms as he let out small whimpers.
He let out a groan. He was so hot right now...I couldn't help but repeat it again and again. I was bouncing on his cock harder and faster within minutes, the bed rocking and hitting the wall. He was groaning and sweating harder than I was. "Yeah like that fuck baby~!" I moaned at his praises and found myself losing control. I was bouncing on his cock and kissing his lips now, biting them so hard that they began to bleed. I licked his blood off his lip and continued kissing him.
I am way too lazy to write a smut scene to this and even if I do, it'd be passionate morning sex full of fluff while their doing the dirty lol. Anyways, HAPPY VALINTINE'S DAY BABIES. From Me040626, Harry Potter, and D̶r̶a̶c̶o̶ ̶M̶a̶l̶f̶o̶y̶....Oh wait he crossed his name out-
Hermione was the first to break the short silence. "Harry you look stunning!" I blushed deeply at the compliment, more from Luna and Ron followed as they twirled me around and all.
He took off my glasses with his free hand and cupped my cheek. "Yes darling?" I turned my face and let out a few whimpers. I had a raging boner that was very visible. He looked down at is and smiled. "Oh you want me to touch there? Not yet love. Be patient." I groaned at his words as he continued to play with my nipple. He soon began playing with the other nipple.
"He would. Also, I talked to Hermione and she is working on an outfit for Draco as we speak. She didn't tell him about your plan to ask him on a date she just decided on buying him a whole new outfit. She'll give it to him after you as him out." I groaned and grabbed a pair of pants from my closet.
He smiled, flashing his shiny white teeth. "And if I am not?"
He was moaning and screaming every time he opened his mouth. Draco chuckled and let out a soft groan.
"May I princess?" Harry rolled his eyes, annoyed. He hated when Draco called him that. He was still a boy who just happens to like wearing clothes society says belongs to females. He thinks clothes are clothes but he is aware that Draco is only teasing him. This was like a regular thing to be honest...and maybe Harry did kind of like being called princess but nobody had to know that. "Shut up you faggot." Harry mumbled embarrassed and pushed his ass back so that Draco's lips were now pressed on his twitching hole. He chuckled at the comment and pressed his soft lips onto Harry's asshole multiple times, kissing it gently. He moaned and pushed his ass back more. "Shove your tongue in me like you said you would~" Draco chuckled and rubbed his cheeks with his large hands, spreading them apart to get a good look at his asshole. "Your wish is my command." Draco's tongue pressed against his hole and licked it repeatedly a few times before his tongue pushed past his still tight rim. Draco would have thought the dildo would have stretched him out enough but apparently not, he wasn't complaining though. Harry's back arched as he buried his face in the pillows to moan out in pleasure. His tongue dug deep inside Harry, wetting his insides with his saliva and enjoying the shaking from the smaller boy.
"Harry are you alright?" I looked up to see my best friends, Hermione and Ron, looking at me with concerned faces. A few people around them looked up for a second before returning to their worked, not really interested in the answer I was supposed to give. I smile as if I wasn't just receiving the best blowjob on earth. "I'm fine guys. Why?" They looked at each other and Ron spoke up. "Your face is all red and you keep putting your head down. Do you maybe need to see a doctor or something?" I shook my head as I seen the took starting to stand up and come over to me. "No guys, seriously, I just am tired that's all. Hard d-day." I bit my lip at the feeling of Malfoy's throat clenching around my cock. Hemione and Ron eventually agreed to come by later to my dorm to check on me and I just slowly nodded. They thankfully took their seats again.
My eyes widened. "W-what?! I asked you one question you twat!" His face creeped closer until our lips were almost touching. My eyes darted towards his lips, they were moist and pink as bubble gum.
"LET ME AT HIM LUNA!"
"You're not my professor Potter. I don't have to do anything you tell me to." He scuffed and walked off to his seat. The class giggled and laughed at the interaction and soon got back to class. I, on the other hand, just couldn't keep my eyes off of the handsome flustered boy for the rest of the class period.
"You too." I mumbled and led him outside the school. I was taking him to the muggle world to watch a movie and go to one of those late night carnivals. It was my dream first date so it should be fun.
His eyes were scary enough to scare me back into being his little submissive bitch. "I wasn't asking. Take it down your damn throat
"You're hearing things." He chuckled and kissed my jawline.
"Something that could be in you but you know? I missed my target." I flung a dirty shirt at his face while blushing madly. I hated/loved when he made dirty comments such as the one he just made. "ANYWAYS!!!!" I yelled as I stopped cleaning for a second to look into his beautiful icy grey eyes as soon as he yanked the shirt off his face.
Harry couldn't even answer Draco's question.
"Guys!"
Little Draco was sensitive out of the three so teasing was like being bullied to him. Of course he didn't tell his siblings that so he looked at it as a game. He wiped his tears into his papa's shirt and turned to them smiling. "I-It's fine guys." His pale small cheeks were now red along with his nose. He was the most strict but he also was the cry baby too. Draco nodded in satisfaction and lightly pushed little Draco over to Harley and Harry.
"Cumming baby!" I bit my lip as my eyes crossed at the feeling of his warm seed filling inside of me. "Fuck! Oh fuck~!" He moaned. It was enough to finally push my release out onto our stomachs. I leaned onto his body, exhausted. His dick was throbbing inside of me now, causing me to whimper.
He lifted his head up and looked at me with lustful eyes. "Damn I'm so lucky." He said, taking his shirt off. "I'm the lucky one." I said admiring him. He chuckled and pulled at my skirt. "Permission to take this off?" I nodded my head and lifted my hips to allow him to pull it off and drop it on the floor.
He clapped excitedly and explained these rules. "This time, you must make 25 hops with only 25 balls. If you fail, you get nothing." The game made loser sound effects before releasing 10 basket balls at a time onto the rack that was lined in front of Draco.
He hummed and took my whole length down his throat. I swear my eyes crossed the moment my tip hit the back of his throat. He has done this a million times and it never got old. He sucked me for only five minutes before my hips were bucking and my my body was sweaty. I could feel myself so close but when I was about to warn him, his mouth was gone. The warm feeling of his mouth and throat disappeared.
"No I'm free."
"Don't explain," He kissed my neck and looked up at me, "I love it." I moaned at the feeling of another snap. He laid me down on the bed and got in between my legs, my skirt putting my whole lower body on display for his eyes. Although we have seen each other nude a few times, I still got embarrassed. We never seen each other nude in this kind of situation though. It was our first time.
"Tsk, no way he's making that. I am certain." A cocky grin was plastered on his face. He began the game and this time, one minute later, he was holding a big stuffed unicorn and a big stuffed shark and cash in his hands. My jaw hit the ground this time.
"Coming in yet?" Harry snapped out of his thoughts when he realized his eyes were on Draco's dick. He wasn't ashamed for looking at what was his but...but it still was pretty embarrassing to you know...so that was that. Quickly, his eyes darted to meet Draco's instead. It was like they held a staring contest for what felt like forever until Harry looked down at Draco's dick again.
"I-I just..."
Draco almost wanted to burst out laughing at the shorter boy's comment. He did feel guilty about the mess he made but he knew that Harry wouldn't really be mad for long. He loved Draco too much to seriously be mad over a mess. Or that's what Draco thought. Harry, on the other hand, was thinking of ways to kill and hide Draco's body. He limped to the trash can and back to the living room, mumbling, "Maybe hit him in the head with a shovel," and smiled serial killer like. He was very pleased with his decision and was almost going to do it until he heard the older man's voice fill the living area. "Who are you trying to kill?" A faint blush covered Harry's cheeks as he squinted his eyes to properly see the blonde male's head over the back of the couch. His hair was messy and his voice was deep from his slumber. An angel on his shoulder appeared and begged for him to just say,
"You want me to touch you? You seem..." Draco paused and got close to Harry's exposed neck and licked from his collarbone to his earlobe, biting is gently before whispering in his ear, "Needy." Harry's breathing stopped all together this time. He didn't even notice the pre cum leaking from his member. Draco did though. He grabbed the head of Harry's cock and rubbed it teasingly slow. "Come on baby. Tell me what you want from me." Harry forgot all about the mess in their living room, the water running colder the longer they sat there, his attempts to be mad. Hell, he even forgot his name for a second. Draco knew he had that affect on Harry and he loved it. He loved how submissive and shy Harry could be at times. Shy was accomplished. His goal now was to make his pretty boy submit to him. "I..." Harry found it hard to breathe suddenly. Draco's hand snaked around to the small arch in Harry's back and held him there.
Draco just watched, leaning on the dresser, observing Harry losing his shit. He was pounding his prostate, going completely haywire, hitting it harder than it should be hitting it. It sent shivers down his spine and made the whole bed rock and hit on the wall. Draco's towel had a huge tent under it. He swore under his breath. He loved when Harry touched himself for Draco. It made him cum hands free a lot in the past. Harry's head turned to Draco's and made direct eye contact as he kept going. His face was red, hair wet and messy, tongue barely staying in his mouth. "
"You disrespected me today. You don't disrespect me you know that, right?." His face was an angry red but I could see the slight embarrassment flashing in those grey eyes of his. He didn't answer me though. He just stood there, dumbfounded. I tilted my head with fake confusion. "Cat got your tongue love?" His breathing stopped, I could no longer see his chest rising fast. I smirked at the affect I had on him. He mumbled something under his breathe before speaking louder.
Harry's voice in his head was right but the deeper he pushed, the harder it was getting for him to not just beg for Draco already.
I just took that as a confirmation that I may continue. I unzipped the black school slacks and found the hole in his boxers. His large cock sprang out and stood tall and proud in front of my face. It was big. I blushed at the huge cock and licked it slowly and teasingly. Two could play at this 'who's dominant' game and I wasn't good at losing. I then could feel my power bottom began to awake in me as I took the tip in my mouth to lick and suck like a little kitten. I could only imagine how Potter's face looked right now. I imagined he was impatient and wanted more. I hummed at the thought and took more into my rather small mouth.
"Baby, you were bad today. I couldn't give a damn about your class. That dirty mouth of yours needs to be shut up." Malfoy's breathing stopped again as he inched closer to my lips. "Please shut me up." He whispered and kissed me softly. He was being a needy brat who just assumed he could get what he want even after misbehaving. I kissed him back just for a second then pulled him away. "Now, now, stop being a needy slut." He whimpered and tried to push himself onto me more.
"I SAID YOU HAD A CURFEW!"
." I came untouched at the way he was speaking to me. I was embarrassed that I tired to dare disobey such a hot boy who was clearly the one who should tell me what to do. I whimpered at the warm stream of cum still leaking from my cock and nodded my head slowly. "Yes Sir."
I smiled and hugged her. She was right, Draco and I did need to become more conformable with each other. I let go of her and we both exited my dorm. Luna waved and skipped off in the direction of Hermione's house dorms while I dragged my feet to Draco's.
"G-guys we might wake Harry. He's probably exhausted."
All the tables had three roses on them in a fancy glass vase that had water in them. The room was filled with light talking and laughing. It honestly made Harry feel like he was in a movie. Draco smiled at his curios lover and greeted the waiter that had led them to their table. It was in the very front of the room and the closest to the huge window walls. While Harry admired the city below, Draco had pulled out his chair and asked him to sit. He did so but his eyes were still wondering all over with curiosity. Draco put his chin in his palm and elbow on the table to admire the man carefully. He looked at everything so astonishing with his lips parted slightly. The lips Draco couldn't wait to kiss later that night. Finally Harry's eyes were back on Draco. He smiled from the sudden attention and tiled his head. "Seems like you like everything." Harry chuckled and sat back in his chair with a slight blush.
If burned like the first but this time, it only took a few thrust of his fingers before the feeling was pleasing. I bit my swollen lip hard while blushing. He fingers made a scissoring motion and dug deeper in me. It was all moans and lip biting until this one particular spot. I screamed and gripped the sheets. "OH FUCK AHHH~!" A satisfied smile was on Draco's face.
I was on the edge the whole class period, almost relieving myself serval times. Each time, Malfoy wiggled my dick from his throat to keep me from doing so. He was such a damn tease that it hurt. Finally, the class ended. I dismissed them as quickly as possible and waited for the door to shut after the last student before letting out loud groans of pleasure and bucking my hips into the warm opening. I could hear him choking and gagging, trying  to take all of me again and again.
"NO WE ARE NOT!"
"Mind if our first time is like this?" I blushed and shook my head. I didn't mind at all I just wanted him. He leaned in and kissed me while groping my bare cheeks. "I'll guide you through this okay?" I nodded and listened carefully. "Lift yourself up a bit. I'm going to put the tip in and you slowly sit down on it. Don't go too fast or it will hurt." I nodded again and lifted myself up a bit.
His other hand rested on the boy's cute waist that was also marked up with bites and hickeys. Harry noticed his touch and it was like he lost himself in it. "P-please." He whispered. A smile fought to appear on Draco's face. He knew Harry was on edge. He wanted it. What better way to make him want it more than by teasing him? Draco chuckled and pulled away smirking.
baby~!" I didn't know it was this hot to see him beg for me to bounce on his cock. He stopped lifting me and stopped thrusting to allow me to start moving myself. I was new to this so I was a bit confused until I tried it. I lifted myself to his tip then dropped down. My cheeks slapping his thighs hard.
Harry's cheeks flushed a scarlet color as he began to question his unholy thoughts.
Draco may or may not have been planning something special for his Harry. He blushed at the thought and went back to the couch. Since he was wide awake, he decided to do some more planning before tomorrow comes. And when it does come, it will be amazing.
He kissed his back in satisfaction as he pinched and pulled at the nipple until it felt harder than it already was.
He approached the girl who was looking over a piece of paper and failed to notice him standing over her until he cleared his throat. Her light brown eyes looked up and she had a polite smile on her face. "Hello-" She cut herself off and dropped her head back to the paper she was reading. She had no interest in talking to Draco at all so she continued her work silently. Draco noticed this and scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. He knew she was still upset with him but he didn't really care how she felt right now. All he cared about was his ass being saved. He'll apologize to her later. "Don't be like that. I need a favor." Draco said with a frown.
"May I take this off?" I nodded and allowed him to take off my sweater and throw it somewhere on the floor. He kissed my chest and stomach and left small marks all over. After a few minutes, there wasn't a spot on my chest that was left unmarked. I was now fully erect and my nipples were being sucked and bit on. It was the best feeling in my life. My back was arched, his hand holding the small of my back, the other gripping higher up my right thigh.
Thank God I beat the students here. Not long after arriving, the third block class were here and now getting situated in their seats, all confused as to why their teacher was not here. I cleared my throat to get them to all quiet their whispers and listen up. As they did so, I scanned the faces in the room. I knew many of them or have talked to them before but I was not searching for any of the faces I saw. I was looking for Draco. Lately, him and I haven't been bickering or fighting just light insults towards the other every so often. I, however, was sad about the sudden friendly act he's been giving off. I don't know but I was falling for him. Have been for a long damn time and still is. He didn't know that though which is why I was so ready to see his handsome face.
"WHAT?!" He exclaimed. Luna tried to hold back the couple but failing. Oh well. Not my issue hehe :).
"Come on baby. I'd love to hear it again." I blushed harder as his hand rubbed and cupped one of my cheeks. I moaned again, closing my eyes this time. "That's it." I kept moaning quietly as he began touching all over my rear and the back of my thighs all while kissing my jawline and neck. "I want you to know, I won't do anything you don't want me to." I blushed and opened my eyes and faced him.
I have never been to a carnival and actually enjoyed myself. I've been to dozens with the Dursley family but only as a jacket holder and nothing more. This time, I wanted to have fun. Draco paid the cab driver and we exited and walked up to the booth. "Evening you guys! What can I get ya?" The lady in the booth asked.
Harry begin to pick up all the trash and limp back and forth from the kitchen, to throw the trash away, to the living area. He didn't mind cleaning but this seemed like a lot. He sighed loudly and bent over to pick up something off the ground. "Such a snob." He mumbled. Meanwhile, over on the couch, Draco's eyes had slowly began to open. His head slightly hurt but not that bad because he was already use to this. He did this every so often due to stress and sometimes just for fun. He chuckled quietly to himself and wandered if Harry was still sleep. Just as he was about to get up and see, his eyes opened fully and locked onto the thin blue panties that were not that far from his face. So close, all he'd have to do his sit up and lean outward a bit and he'd be right there, face to face with the ass he loved so much. He almost whined when the panties came out of view and were replaced by a long white fabric. He looked up and saw that Harry's back was facing him. "This is so ridiculous! I swear if he ever wakes up, which I
"You because you left the house a mess. Now, go wash up so I can make you breakfast." He tried to look as mad as possible but also as calm as possible. Overall, his face betrayed him and gave Draco the cutest smile and blush he'd ever laid eyes on.
"No you deserve to have lots of fun. We'll take two premium cards." I frowned as Draco pulled out £73.09 and handed it to the lady. I continued to frown as she took it and did some shuffling before pulling out two golden cards.
sane one here.
"You guys give him the best hug and take your nap. If you're good, I'll make cookies." The three nodded and hugged each other. Draco smiled at his work and closed the door. He was proud that he was able to hold the house down while Harry was hard at work to help pay the bills and all. Recently, he started working late and had multiple jobs. Every since January, he'd wake up and go to his multiple jobs and got back at 3:00AM only to have to wake up at 5:10AM and go right back to work. He did this seven days a week for about two months now today. It was February 13th, the day before Valentine's day.
"YEAH!"
"You two just have fun and be safe." Draco nodded and held out his hand to take mine. I grabbed it and waved at Luna, silently thanking her for that. She nodded and went back into my dorm. Guess they'd wait until I got back. "You look amazing." I felt my face wash over in a dark red.
After buying Harry nice flowers and chocolates like Draco ordinally planned to do, He took Harry home and enjoyed each other's time together...as fiancés <3
Harry hummed and kissed the desired place he knew his lover wanted him to kiss. "I know." He said against the pale skin and smiled. "I just miss you a lot." Draco rolled his eyes and turned to face his adorable boyfriend.  His huge circle glasses were allowing the shorter male to stare right back at him clearly. Grey eyes looking into green ones. Draco cupped his cheek and rubbed his thumb up and down it gently. "Yeah...I missed you too." He leaned in and placed a few pecks on Harry's moist lips before grabbing his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
I looked back up in his eyes through my somewhat long eyelashes. "Will you go on a date with me?" His lips formed a small smirk before he closed the small gap between us, kissing me softly. I kissed back, still holding some of his filthy clothes. It sadly didn't last long though. He pulled away and continued cleaning.
He rolled his eyes and leaned down to lace his elbow on the desk. He cocked his head to the side with a sly grin. "Well then, Professor Potter, I was late  because I was. As long as I give you this slip, you shouldn't have any questions. Should you?" He spoke sarcastically sweet which only made me think back to out old days of nonstop teasing and all. I shot a grin back and copied his actions. Our faces were just a few inches apart as the whole classes attention was now on us, anticipation radiating off of them. It was almost like they were looking forward to this 'fight' between two long time rivals.
." I kissed his pale exposed shoulder, just now noticing his shirt was unbuttoned and falling off of him, multiple times before smirking. "Of course. Why not?"
WoW hArRy HeLp YoUr BoYfRiEnD!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyways, hope y'all enjoyed!
The man at the stand finally pulled up Draco's name and smiled to the two. "Floor number 22. You will be escorted to your table once you're there. Enjoy." Draco nodded and held Harry's hand as he pulled him over to the elevator on their left. They went up 22 floors slowly and finally when there, Harry let out a small gasp. This floor was different. The whole room was made of glass. The lit up city was crystal clear below them on full display. Nice round tables with red coverings and white and pink chairs were scattered here and there with plenty of couples sitting at them.
"You wouldn't."
He then lifted his head and admired my marked up thighs. "That's my baby." He rubbed over my thighs and leaned down to my face and made me look at him. "You're my world," He pecked my lips, "My reason to breathe," He kissed my neck, "My reason to fight," He kissed my left cheek, "My everything." He kissed my right check. I didn't know I was crying until I felt his thumbs were swiping over my cheeks to wipe the tears away.
Um...Harry is a bit needy here hehehe that's about it. Also, sorry for the slow updates!
"I...it's fine but if we do it....please be gentle." He nodded and pulled me over to his bed and sat down on it, pulling me onto his lap facing him. "I'll be gentle and I'll take it slow for you." I nodded as his lips attached to my neck and kissed it again, his hand wandering up my skirt and cupping both of my cheeks. I was blushing harder than ever at the feeling. I then began to mentally freak out when he pulled on my thin boy shorts.
Thirty minutes into class, the classroom doors creaked open and then closed. As if someone was sneakily trying to sneak into the classroom. The noise didn't go unmissed though. The whole class faced an embarrassed Malfoy making his way down the aisle with a slip in hand. He looked mad but embarrassed at the same time which made my heart skip a beat at how adorable he looked. "Sorry Professor I- Potter?" He looked at me confused and I just smiled. "You are late. Why?"
"Oh stop it Ronald...it's my turn. No physical contact, no touching below the waist no-" She too was yanked back and Luna stepped in, being the
I'm s-so sorry please fuck m-me~" Harry whimpered. His plan to temp Draco jumped out of the window, we don't know her anymore (xD). He couldn't tempt Draco properly because he was tempting himself more to want the tall male more. He rolled himself onto his knees, the top half of his body rested on the covers. He was able to push the whole dildo inside him now, making his whole body tremble with excitement. Fitting the whole thing wasn't as good as having Draco but it worked for Harry just enough. He gripped the covers with his free hand as he moaned out louder than he ever did.
I felt a pit in my stomach just as his cock found my prostate. "Feels so g-good~!!" I moaned and chased after my very close orgasm. I could tell Draco was close too. He was gripping my hips tighter and not letting go. His breathing was shaky and his eyebrows were drawn together.
"Are you asking me out?"
"Yeah one day. I'll clean up everything you stay in bed and rest okay?" Harry hummed and nodded his head as he closed his eyes fully. At least he didn't have to clean the house anymore.
My ears perked at the small short moans he was letting quietly slip out of his mouth. It was then I noticed he was looking down at me with is head on the desk so that his students couldn't see his blissed out face right now. He was half smiling at me, sending chills down my spine. "That's right baby. Take some more." He whispered. I almost laughed at him trying to regain dominance. I only took his cock out of my mouth to look up at him with a grin. "Mmm no. You were so mean to me remember?" His eyes rolled annoyingly as he leaned back up and scooted his chair up even more. Now his dick was touching my lips without me having to lean forward. He leaned back down and looked me deep into my soul.
He lifted his head up and looked at me with lustful eyes. "Damn I'm so lucky." He said, taking his shirt off. "I'm the lucky one." I said admiring him. He chuckled and pulled at my skirt. "Permission to take this off?" I nodded my head and lifted my hips to allow him to pull it off and drop it on the floor.
"Here you go baby."
"You doubted me baby so I had to prove you wrong." He flashed me a grin and held the stuffed toys as he took me further into what was a fun night.
~" Draco was taken aback at the words that came out of the brown haired  boy's mouth. He'd never called him that, even though Draco sorta has a Daddy Kink, and he said that it was far too embarrassing to ever call him that. Yet, here he was, abusing his prostate and addressing Draco as his Daddy. He swallowed another lump in his throat and approached the bed at a slow pace. He had to give in now. His dick was making the towel on his hips almost fall off from how much it was sticking out.
I stood there in that one spot still, not getting over how sweet and gentle that kiss was. "I'd love to." I heard him say as he took the clothes out of my hands and placed them in the hamper. The room now clean again. I smiled nervously and backed away towards his door.
Draco froze and the smile on his face was now an open mouth. His eyes were glassy, tears threatening to spill out as Harry looked up at him smiling softly. "Draco Malfoy, I have wanted you and have got you for 10 years. I want to make it forever. Will you do
He nodded and waved. "Look cute for me kiddo." My heart pounded in my chest as I opened the door and went out into the hall with a flushed face. I made sure his door was shut before I leaned against it for a second. I really did it. I squealed quietly then rushed off happily to the girls to tell them about my success.
"Alright these two cards have unlimited ride passes, skip line pass, and they are good for a month worth of visits so about 30 visits. You two enjoy." Draco took the cards and thanked her. He then dragged me into the lit up entrance of the noisy carnival. "You just wasted £73.09 on dumb premium cards! Are you crazy?!" He smiled. "For you." I blushed and pouted as he dragged me over to the first thing we saw.
"May I take this off?" I nodded and allowed him to take off my sweater and throw it somewhere on the floor. He kissed my chest and stomach and left small marks all over. After a few minutes, there wasn't a spot on my chest that was left unmarked. I was now fully erect and my nipples were being sucked and bit on. It was the best feeling in my life. My back was arched, his hand holding the small of my back, the other gripping higher up my right thigh.
I chuckled and lifted the smaller boy and placed him on my lap so that my now half soft cock could press against his clothed ass. He moaned at the feeling and leaned onto me, his face buried in my neck. "P-please. Let me have my way with you tonight."  I bit my lip hard enough to draw blood at his request. "Oh yeah baby?" He nodded and slowly grinded himself down against my cock. "
Draco started to slightly hyperventilate and cry. He was shocked. He knew Harry loved him and he loved Harry but he never seen a proposal coming. He honestly thought getting married was too cheesy for them, hence why they weren't married already. Harry stood up and wiped his tears with his free hand and cupped his cheek. "Breathe baby." Draco's breathing only quickened at Harry's touch. He'd be lying if he said he felt fine right now. He felt like passing out from all of this but thankfully he was able to slowly steady himself. He pressed his forehead onto Harry's and exhaled slowly to get his breathing right again. He then looked into Harry's waiting eyes and nodded. "Of course idiot." Harry grinned happily and pressed a thousand kisses on Draco's plump pink lips before grabbing his hand and putting the ring on his finger. Draco admired it and couldn't help the more tears that were now running down his face.
"Draco fuck~!" His face was flushed in a scarlet red. "B-bounce. Please baby
"He did this didn't he?! Malfoy, I am kicking your arse!"
Draco huffed and watched as his children kept finding things to throw at the mini him. Little Draco had had enough though and was turning away to tell his papa, not knowing he was right there at the door. He ran into his papa and shook his head from the impact before looking up at him. His eyes were slightly glassy and his platinum blonde hair was an absolute mess. Draco felt bad for his kid and held him close as his eyes narrowed at the two kids who were now jumping from their bed to little Draco's and back.
I blushed and let out a small moan. He smiled and pulled away from the kiss. "Did you just moan?" He asked with a grin on his face. I looked away, too embarrassed to tell the truth.
"O-okay then tomorrow...5:00PM just drop by my dorm ready."
My glory was short lived as I heard the bell ring for fourth period. The fourth class would be coming in for today to see their peer getting his cock sucked by me...that somewhat made precum ooze from my slit. Just thinking of having a cock shoved down my throat for everyone to see...turned me on even more. Potter, on the other hand, seemed more embarrassed about it. "Under the desk." He whispered as the first few students entered the classroom. I nodded and got under in the speed of lightening. I could hear everyone coming into the class and sitting down. Well this was just great. I sighed and made myself comfortable as possible and it seemed Harry was doing the same. He scooted his chair forward until his crotch was right in front of my face.
"Must feel so good having my dick in your stomach hm?
I woke up the next day to the sounds of people yelling and just loud talking in general.
He took in a sharp breath before running a hand through his hair slowly. It was like he was now in some trance and he couldn't help but give in. "I...want it." He mumbled, dying on the inside from embarrassment. The taller boy pretended not to know what he meant. Part of his bully loved making his boyfriend all sexually frustrated. "Want what? To use my body wash? Hmm it was $10 so don't use it all." That lit a fire under Harry's ass, just like Draco had thought it would. He jumped off the sink and almost ripped the thin panties off of himself and slid the glass doors open aggressively. This time, he was actually mad. He hated being teased instead of his face being buried in the their pillows as Draco did unholy things to him from behind. He pressed his finger against Draco's chest, which was covered in body wash. "Draco Malfoy I swear if you don't put your tongue to better use than to use it to play dumb and tease me, I will rip it out and shove it up your own ass! Are we clear?!"
The class went by quickly to my surprise. I sighed in relief as I was now able to everyone except Draco of course. "Complete what you didn't for homework." I said as the students flooded out of the room and to there next class. Malfoy took his time gathering his things and making his way to the desk I sat at. He frowned and looked at me with narrowed eyes. "Look here Potter, this is dumb." He spat with very much annoyance in his voice. I slouched back in the teacher's chair and looked at him with a smirk. He just had no idea how adorable he looked right now, all mad and bothered. Just like always.
We walked out the movie theater hand in hand laughing. We saw a romantic comedy (insert name because who the hell actually watches those lol. I'm not judging by the way) and was now heading out to the carnival. "That was nice." I said as I got into the cab with Draco. He nodded. "Ready to puke?" I smirked. "I could ask you the same." The ride was about 30 minutes and when we finally got there I gasped.
By the time we got back to HAL, it was 12AM. We were so late because we had planned to eat at the carnival but apparently, Draco felt like I was too good for carnival food. We ate at IHOP instead because why not? We snuck in the school quietly and to his dorm because I knew Hermione and Ron would kill me for walking in there late. We got into his room and threw all the prizes we'd won onto the once cleaned floor.
He sat on the swing and smiled to Harry. "Baby, push me." Harry looked at his adorable boyfriend and couldn't help but laugh at him. He was too cute without realizing it. He walked over behind Draco and began pushing him lightly. There was a few giggles that filled the silence for the next two minuets. Harry was too into watching Draco smile and giggle each time he reached the highest point. He felt his heart pound at his lover's cuteness. He wanted to capture this moment. He stopped pushing Draco and stood to the side of the swing set and took out his phone and snapped a few pictures and took a few videos of the smiling blonde boy. He wanted to remember this when they got older and for the rest of his life. Draco noticed and hoped of the swing quickly and walked over to Harry.
"Awww baby please don't cry. Every man you had should've been telling you this and if they haven't then they suck and I'm glad I could be the one to tell you." His lips attacked mine and kissed me deeply. I kissed back, cupping his right cheek and pulling him closer. His tongue licking my bottom lip asking for entrance. I gladly gave it to him and let his tongue explore my mouth.
It slipped my mind that I wore women's underwear to this date. He hummed and let them go. They smacked against my pale skin, stinging a bit. I bit my lip hard. "Boy shorts? The tight ones, hm?"
He shot the first one and made it. "Luck." I mumbled. But then he made the next one. And the the next. And the next. It only took him 30 seconds to make all ten hops. A siren went off indicating he won the game. The man laughed with joy. "Wow you're not bad! Want to try Double or Nothing?" Draco looked back at me, my jaw was hanging open, amazed.
I had a tiny gay panic in the back of mind as my eyes immediately fell to his nicely toned body. I heard him chuckle. "You like what you see Potter?" I blushed and attempted to look annoyed.
~Hair colors are based off the actual actors not by the book or movie. Also, when I say Draco is blonde, I mean platinum blonde obviously not actual blonde.
He was feeling embarrassed. She was embarrassing the Draco Malfoy and wasn't scared about it and Draco couldn't even open his mouth to say something mean. He felt humiliated. "This sucks. It's a joke. You don't have one good bone in your body and it shows and you know what?" She picked up her books and bag as she stood up and walked towards the common room door, "You're just as pathetic as the letter you wrote." She walked off in the direction Draco had came and disappeared. Draco stood there, baffled at how he just let someone laugh at him...call him pathetic. He never would've let that happen and he guesses that he did have some nerve approaching her for help after he had hurt her in the past. He inhaled and nodded is head. It didn't phase him at all because he knew he was a dick.
Draco shoved the paper in the pocket of his black robes and looked at the headmistress with a fake sincere smile. "Have a nice rest of the day." She nodded then dismissed the angry blonde boy. As soon as he was halfway down the hall, he let out a groan of frustration and annoyance. He was not pleased with his current situation in life at all. He didn't even want to attend HAL but here he was, a young adult at HAL and still couldn't do as he pleased. What 17 year old male had no control over his own life decisions? It was ridiculous.
I could feel his hand slipping up my sweater and rubbing all over my body. His fingers soon finding my nipples and slowly fumbling with my right one. I moaned into the kiss and quickly pulled away. "D-Draco~"
"G-guys I don't know about this." I was in a baby blue skirt with a light pink sweater that had a picture of beautiful cheery blossom trees with a baby blue sky in the background to match it. I also wore a cute chain on my skirt that was light pink. Lastly, I had on high white socks and white sneakers with one or two pink and blue charms on each shoe.
"Guyssssss!" I whined for the third time. Finally everyone was silent and looking at me. "Where is my unicorn and shark?" I frowned. Draco hurriedly went over to his closet and pulled them both out and handed them to me.
He kissed my hair softly while panting. "I know I promised to be gentle but does that apply for the next three rounds?" My eyes almost popped out of my head. "THREE? AS IN 1, 2, 3?!"
"I mean it...Mr. Malfoy." He visibly gulped and put on a disgusted face to hide his once blushing one.
"As if. Let me in." He moved aside and let me enter his dark room. The only thing  making light was his lamp on the night stand. "God do you ever have your lights on?" He shrugged, closing the door then turning them on. "Now I do." I rolled my eyes and examined his messy room. The floor was littered with open school books, pencils, and papers along with his clothes and what seemed to be important documents.
"Promise to be gentle?" He held up a heart with his fingers like BTS does and held it towards me. I mimicked his movements and we tapped them together. "Promise." I smiled at our cute little promise gesture and opened my legs a bit wider. He reached into his nightstand without getting off of the bed and pulled out a small bottle of lube and squirted some on his fingers. He threw the bottle on the ground and rubbed his fingers together before rubbing the lube on my hole.
"This feels wrong." I whimpered. He kissed my thighs and promised me that it would feel good soon. I knew he wouldn't lie to me so I laid back relaxed and let him began to move his finger. It was bending inside me and felt so wrong until...until it started to feel really good.
Malfoy jerked back, astonished and still blushing. "I-I..."
I fake yawned. "You could never get me that unicorn, y'know if I wanted it." He smirked. "Wanna bet pretty boy?" I nodded with a confident grin and watched him roll up his sleeves.
I blushed furiously and swore I almost moaned at the sight. It looked pretty big, bigger than I had imagined it would be. I didn't want to ever admit this to Potter but I sometimes masturbated thinking about him so it has crossed my mind multiple times before. I heard him began speaking to the class and continuously shifting in his seat. His boner was tempting me without that intention, at least I think, and it was working. "Ah, what the hell. One blowjob won't hurt." I mumbled to myself and grabbed the tent to rub it slowly. I could hear his breath hitch and I am 100% positive the class heard it too but didn't question it. He played it off and continued whatever he was doing.
I am NOT used to writing short chapters lmao
“So you’re going out from work soon then?” Hermione asked hopefully. “If I can, I’ll ask the manager-” looking up from the phone he looks up at his manager who’s staring at him, after 10 seconds of intense staring he gives Harry a thumbs up before turning back to his computer. “He says okay”
He remembers being 9 years old flying high above the manor, feeling the wind hit his face as his mother looks on from below.
“Is that what you planned, really? Really?” Harry responds. “Well, now I have” Malfoy winked and took another sip of his wine. Harry sighed “This is why I disliked you for 6 years,” He said and glared grumpily at Malfoy who just smiled behind his wine glass. “Not that I was a spoiled bully then?” Malfoy responded with a glint in his eyes. “Were?” Harry then said without skipping a beat. Which made the other boy break out in laughter. “Sure, Potter. Whatever,”
Well at the grocery store Pansy seemed to be at a loss, “I haven’t been here okay, let me think,” Draco snorted beside her “You know I can direct you, right?” Draco said, Pansy waved him off, “doesn’t quite give the same authority vibe,” Draco rolled his eyes and began walking towards the ice cream section, Pansy spotting it and walking faster so that she’d be in front of Draco when they arrived there, well there she took out chocolate and cookies and cream ice cream while Draco watched with his arms crossed. “This is absolutely unnecessary,” he complained and Pansy waved him away. “And there’s where you’re wrong, dear,” she said mimicking his mother. Draco rolled his eyes again, looking around him “you’re being ridiculous,” Draco muttered, his arms crossed. “Nonsense,” Pansy waved, “you’re lucky you’re literally immune to hangovers y’know,” she said, walking them over to the cashier, grabbing her wallet, “Do you even remember anything?” Draco shrugged, “bits and pieces,” Pansy snorted as she put in her numbers, “absolutely ridiculous,” Pansy laughed, now mimicking Draco.
“So it’s a good thing?” Draco asked, browsing his phone. “No! Yeah? Kinda… Does he follow you, he has to follow you,” Before Pansy could start on her frantic rant Draco stopped her “Yep he does.” Draco nodded, only half listening to her.
When he looked at Harry he remembers exactly what had happened, the panic attack, Pansy and Harry calming him, Harry walking them outside, hand in hand, apparating them here, Draco puking over his white rug. Draco cringed as his brain went over what had happened, a clear mental image of Harry just a few centimetres away, wiping off his makeup gently, brushing his teeth, deeding Draco incapable and Draco not complaining, making Draco take his sleeping meds so he could sleep, leading him to his bed and-.
“No, but when you’re dressed like that you’re either trying to impress someone or going somewhere important,” she says as they together round the last corner only to see the bus driving away, “fuck,” Draco whispers stopping in his tracks, Pansy stopping beside him obviously thinking hard about something. She follows him up to the bus stop. “The next one will be here in 10 minutes, Potter will be fine for another 20 min, won’t he?” Draco sits down on the bench beside the bus stop and shrugs. “But how will I survive,” Pansy says dramatically, attempting to mimic Draco’s voice, Draco glares at her and Pansy laughs at him and takes out a cigarette from her purse.
Lastly, I'm hoping isolation is treating you all well, do your best to make sure that you and people around you are healthy, much love :).
, Draco caught himself thinking. “You said something,” Draco said back, returning to his book at sipping on his tea, Harry sat up beside him, “what’s the clock?” he asked, yawning again, Draco shrugged, “about 10 am I think, there’s enough hot water in the kettle if you want a cup of tea as well,” Draco said, not looking up from his book, beside him, Harry stretched his back cracking as he got his glasses and settled down again, leaning against the wall, watching Draco,
“Harry!” Ron violently ribbed up the door, “Huh?” Harry paused his cooking to stare at Ron in surprise. “Harry you’re not going to believe it!” Ron took off his coat and shoes in a rush to be able to go and shake Harry like he was a maraca. Harry looked at him in confusion as he did this. “What?”
The wizegamont stares at him with greedy eyes.
There is a statement from Harry fucking Potter of all people. He shows up halfway through Katie Bell’s statement. The large door to the wizegamont opens with a swift noise and everyone turns to look at him. His glasses are skewed up, his robes a mess and draco swears he’s in jeans. Draco is under the impression that he was forced to come last minute by how rushed his appearance looks.
"Of course not." Draco says. He sets the tea towel down, it falls to the floor. And then he sets his mug down beside his thigh. "Did you want to check the balcony? I hear that's where all the criminals keep their plans nowadays."
And when Draco doesn't sleep, doesn't sit in front of his window, doesn't toss and turn, he lays on the floor in his muggle kitchen. The floor cold against his bare back, the kettle on and whistling. He’ll press the butt of his cigarette against his arm, dots it along the faint mark there on his arm. Or sometimes he will find a muggle to spend the night with. A warm body to wrap around his own, make him forget for a bit.
They start with electronics next class. Two people are missing. Draco guesses their test answers regarding their pensieve experiences weren’t satisfactory.
She gets into the science behind it, Draco can see the other prisoners struggling not to argue. If not for her being unable to hear them. Draco can feel the revolt the others want, the disgust. The hatred is clear and he can't bring himself to fully feel the same way. If anything hes humiliated, to think in such away.
"Fine." He shrugs, pulling his book and notes to his chest. The notes are more so letters to her parents but she doesn’t need to know that.
Harry Potter is knocking on his door at 4PM, once, two times, like he always does. Draco takes his time like he always does.
There are very few protests, yet there are a few very hard glares sent his way as he's led out of the room.
The next minute is difficult to watch. When he’s pulled out of the memory Mathilde is standing near his desk and addressing everyone with a hand gesture. The pensieves disappear.
Draco listens as much as he can manage. Some days he's more tired than other but the classes are mostly very interesting and keep him on his toes. He won't survive living in the muggle world if he is petty and doesn't listen. If he fucks up the deal they've given him he could end up in Azkaban. He has too much pride to let himself end up there.
It's a long class and when the first hour ends the others look prepared to hurt her. She's a sympathizer after all. Draco doesn't know how these people were eligible for this program, they seem to hold no regret, no remorse. They would kill a muggle given the chance and now they may be released into their world with a how to guide on how to be a convincing muggle.
His second trial is much quicker than the first.
"Regardless you won't be using any wizarding currency but it's easier to understand money when you have a base."
"Yes?"
They explain everything in a very detailed manor. 7 hours a day he is sat at a desk with a few other death eaters sparsely spread out across the same ministry  room, he knows none of them. The room itself is reminiscent of the library at Hogwarts. It’s aged, there’s dark wood moulding around the room and books toppling on and off the shelves.
Then they read pages out of his journal, the one he'd carelessly left in his hogwarts trunk at home. Long cursive text he wrote late at night in the confines of hogwarts when he couldn't sleep; it’s shared with everyone. He stares at the ground when they start, the reader, a short tired looking women sighs as she starts her redaction.
All the things hidden underneath his bed are moved back on top of his desk within the hour.
There are witnesses on the stand, students he wasn't able to crutiatus, that he can't look in the eye regardless.
"Keep your head up dear."
"Done in here then?" Draco sniffs, scratching just shoulder, his nail gets caught on the fabric. He frowns.
"**It hurt."**
"I understand."
Witnesses come and go, the wizgamont oddly giving him what seems to be a fair trial considering not every witness has slandered him. Eventually the final witness of the day is arrives and Draco can’t look away once he sees him.
"Yes." The word seems so heavy to say out loud.
He’s in bed, crying, a cigarette between his lips, ash on his fingers, burning, hot, scathing. The ash always falls onto his sheets like a second blanket. There's smoke in his nose, his room stinks of it but it's calming. Soothing, like a lullaby that he can breathe in.
He's front page news for a week.
She rolls in a large square box later on during his second day, it's heavy or atleast it looks it as she puts a lightening charm on it to push it into the room.
A man snorts.
They finish the class by learning about paperwork, job scouting, interviews, identification. It's not as difficult as it had sounded initially. Everyone is quick to leave once Mathilde’s timer goes off. Draco is sluggish as he gathers his things.
The muggle life program is a week long with a very basic introduction to living life as a muggle. He sleeps in a room at the ministry for this time, a glorified prison cell he can only leave for class or to eat.
He follows her around, walking beside her, running to catch up when he gets lost in thought. Eventually he reaches her mid twenties, meets a man, graduates university, gets married, she’s home alone with her husband when they hear screaming from their neighbours house. It all happens so quickly, they look out their window and see green lights flashing inside the house. Clear tell tale signs of the killing curse, but why would a muggle know that.
Draco cleans, Draco punches the cushions on his couch, Draco smokes, chain smokes. His ash tray, a stone dragon curled around itself is full, smoke comes out of its mouth.
Draco doesn't sleep. He tosses side to side, rolls his neck, his shoulders, stretches his legs, his arms, his body, one limb at a time until he is sated. He is pressing his hands over his ears, his eyes, his mouth, numbing his senses.
"Sex. They use condoms. No charms. If you want to be safe you'll buy some."
There's a tinge in his stomach as he listens, finding it hard not to disregard what she is saying with the beliefs he grew up with.
"Did you check all my drawers? Anything interesting enough for you?" Draco knows Potter won't say anything of worth. His vocabulary when it comes to him doesn't extend far anymore.
They go on to speak of Electricity, Cable TV, cell phones, internet. it.'s confusing for his first real day. He frowns at her but makes mental notes. If he's living at a muggle he won't live ignorant. He refuses to be helpless like he was during the war.
"1 Year under probation, you cannot leave the city of London and will have weekly check ins with a ministry appointed liaison officer . Your wand will be taken away as well, no casting for a year. No magic." He squints at him before continuing. "You are also forbidden from visiting any wizarding districts. and you will undergo rehabilitation with our new muggle life program where you will experience the next year living exclusively as a muggle. You must also have a job and will be appointed a flat in London which by the second month you will be paying the bill for."
"Draco Malfoy saved my life. He-" Draco almost pukes listening to the praise the man-*boy*-gives him, the way he views things is warped. When he mentions fienfyre Draco's fingers curl into cushion of the chair he's sitting on. He doesn't look at the man at all, his gaze honing in on his dark mark as he listens to Potter stumble through words probably appointed to him by someone much more well spoken.
Azkaban is where they want him. Most of them anyway. There are women with kind eyes, they leak sympathy as they watch him. Then there are men, angry ones who would spit on him given the chance. He's put under veritaserum and tells them all through gritted teeth the things he was forced to do in order to survive. The memories resurface crudely pulled from his mind as the veritaserum coursed through his system.
**They've given me a task and i'm not sure i want to do it. it's too personal to bring this to hogwarts. i know them. all of them. and dumbledore, fuck him but merlin i don't think i have it in me to murder him like they expect me to."**
Lights flash dewily, shadowy faces surround him before he is suddenly placed in a sunny field with a child and her parents.
There’s chatter from the Wizegamont before they begin displaying all evidence related to the trial, it all feels awfully invasive. They have him show his dark mark, pushing his sleeve up. It's humiliating, there's gasps and *oh merlin he's just a child* is whispered somewhere in the room.
"I can see that you're trying."
"No, I think that's all for today." Potter shakes his head, his hair moves with the motion.
There's chattering after each exert and Draco can't help but pick at the arms of the chair.
“Well my choices are limited aren’t they?” He quickly realizes this isn’t the nicest way to speak to her but he can’t help the automaticity of it all.
The sinking feeling in his chest deepens.
"How are you feeling?
His night stands are next, his bookshelf comes right after, his bed is last. It shakes. Draco has moved to the doorway, leans against it, grips the moulding. Potter stares, touches the bed frame. A green light glows. Potter nods. Draco exhales.
"This is a television." She says easily. "You may have witnessed one of these if your pensieves yesterday. I'm going to play a short film for you, all relevant to the program of course but all the same it is a demonstration of one of the most common electronics that muggles own, aside from cellphones."
Her husband runs across the street and she follows behind, concerned, frowning as he knocks on the door....
He views a montage of a happy childhood, smiles, big meals, large family, they have a warm aura. They live Somewhere downtown in a suburban area. Her childhood passes by quickly, flashing before his eyes until she’s in secondary school. She picks up smoking in her teenage years, graduates school, applies to Oxford, gets in. Her experience is so contrasting to his. Her muggle school is nothing like Hogwarts. It’s so modernized unlike anything he’s ever seen. The university she attends has its similarities though.
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy do you plead guilty to the following charges; Attempted murder on 3 accounts, Conspiracy to commit murder, Use of an unforgivable curse, Accessory to murder and torture, as well as fighting as an enemy combatant." Kingsley Shacklebolt says, voice calm and collected.
"Draco." Mathilde says near the end of his last class. Eyes shift to him. Mathilda looks at him softly though. "Would you mind staying after class dear?"
"I suppose so, but I'm still glad ." She says warmly, unbothered. "I think you'll do well as a muggle Draco. The transition won't be seamless but out of everyone in this class I truly believe you'll have the easiest transition."
Potter says. "No thank you." Like always.
**Harry Potter, is always getting in the way. He can't let me breathe."**
"Are you insinuating you would rather be in azkaban?”
He moves himself forward and stares into the pensieve, hair falling into his eyes as he does so before he’s immersed into what feels like another world.
Mathilde claps her hands together. “Now.”  His eyes snap up.
He's in a ministry holding cell for 2 more days before he's dragged back infront of them all. During this time his mother's trial happens. He's never asked to witness but he assumes it goes well when he doesn't see her at his second trial.
Draco shows him to the bathroom next. The same treatment, everything is examined thoroughly. The same as always. They go to the living room, the furniture, the books, the rug. And then the kitchen, Draco sits on the counter and drinks his tea as Potter stares and frowns and little green lights float above their heads indicating that yes, he's clean.
He's not exempt of course, he still did these things and he knows he won’t get forgiveness. There’s no resent as he sits there surrounded by people who hate him. There are just angry expressions and cold stares and nods and quills moving faster than his eyes can follow.
, he suspects. Draco slides to his kitchen floor, beside the fallen tea towel. He closes his eyes, leans back against the cabinet.
They make eye contact right when Potter gets off the witness stand and Draco glares at him. Unable to help himself but Potter doesn't do a single thing of malice back to him. He nods sadly. Like this is a sad situation. Draco would like to assure him that it's not sad but is instead well deserved.
Katie is shaky as she quickly recites the rest of the story. Necklace, bathroom, Draco. Before he knows it the wizegamont is asking Potter if he’s here as a witness. Of course he says yes and welcomes the ministry official that guides him to the witness stand.
“Cynthia come on love, we must get going.” Her mom says, holding out her hand for the small child.
He sips his tea, wipes his mouth with a tea towel, smacks his lips together. He can taste the smoke in his mouth. "Anything?" Draco asks, smiles weakly.
He stands there, in the middle of the room like he's not seen it before.
His teacher is an older woman, she had introduced herself as Mathilde, she has a vague french accent and dresses similarity to his mother. She has a warm kind of presence and a soft pleasant voice.
"As well as bank cards. You'll need a bank account, which we will be helping you with. It will connect to your wizarding vault at gringotts once your sentence is over."
The handle digs into the back of his neck. He presses his fingers into the burns on his arm and sighs.
His flat is in a muggle building. It’s connected to nothing like he had been promised it would, it’s completely conspicuous, fully muggle. It has a dingy elevator, dark hallways, solid wood flooring. His apartment is the size of his old bedroom and on-suite at the manor. It’s not terrible.
Living as a muggle is harder on him than he expects it to be.
Draco's head hurts. They go to his bedroom first, Draco leads the way like always. He sits on his bed as Potter performs intricate spells on every item he owns. He pulls open dresser drawers, waves his wand, a little green light appears and then the drawer is closed and Draco exhales.
Draco doesn't say a word, or understand exactly how a television works but it's intriguing as this film, as Mathilde had called it, plays. It reminds him of wizarding media, it has got pictures of course but it's a continuous story and not a loop.
"Harry Potter." Draco nods, presses himself to the door and lets Potter walk in. Potter does, strong steps, he doesn't remove his shoes. Never does.
"Welcome to my home for the 27th time." Draco closes the door, doesn't lock it. "May I interest you in a glass of water? Fresh from the tap?"
He moves and ends up sitting in front of the window in his room, looking down on the streets of the city. He stares out of it often, watches as water rolls down the glass panes, he traces the shapes with his fingertips and when he can barely keep his eyes open he lets a gentle cleaning charm wash over the glass. A wandless one. It only works sometimes.
And then Harry Potter started asking him questions. Draco loathed the visits more because of them. He wanted to know about work, about his friends, about how he was adjusting. He would stare at him all owlishly and say things like “Do you like it here?” Or “Hows your day going?”
"You use bank cards to pay bills, for your flats, electricity, phone usage bill, shopping and the likes."
"Each pensieve holds a collection of memories, each from a different muggle from their lives before the war. Each muggle was hospitalized due to pointless death eater attacks on their home. Afterwards you will each write a quick paragraph on why this was undeserved. if you fail to compile an adequate educated response you will be removed from the program as you have shown you hold no empathy for other humans, magical or not."
"Right." Potter says, looks at him. Hair wild on top of his head, uniform stiff. "Have a nice day."
When he thinks it's over. A pensieve appears on each desk. Ministry officiated. They look older than the ones at Hogwarts. There’s already a whispy mercury coloured memory swirling around the bottom of basin. He lets his pointer finger drag down the side of it.
"I really do wish you well." She smiles in a way that he wishes reminded him of his mother. “A liaison officer will speak with you tomorrow and go over everything with you.”
"Sure."
The film speaks of cellular devices, he hears the other men stuck in this program with him scoff but again, it's interesting and seems more efficient than wizarding communication methods. It's a short video and when it's finished, Mathilde hands out a questionnaire and tells them to all to fill it out with what are called pens, Draco is reminded of a tiny quill.
“Yeah,” he decided one after a beat of silence and Harry cursed under his breath. Suddenly offended Draco stared at him for an explanation, Harry got out of bed, stood and paused and Draco watched in confusion when Harry turned to walk out to the living space, turning around again, “I’m sorry if I crossed any line last night I-” Draco stared and slowly put his book down, “Potter unless we shagged last night you really haven’t,” something flashed across Harry’s face at the use of his last name before his cheeks tinted red at the mention of shagging, Draco felt his cheeks heat as well but felt no shame in it. “We, uh, didn’t,” Harry said and Draco gave him a thumbs up. “Great, that’s way less embarrassing,” he smiled at Harry. “Thank you for everything you did last night though, and really, if you’re hungry you can just.. take whatever,” Harry was holding the door frame, “it’s nothing really,” Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“At least one,” said Aubrey fondly stroking her belly, “But I wish for her to get out already if I’m honest,” she ended her fond look and patted it before asking for food. And Molly called out for everyone to start the chatter and the plates filling became instant.
“Listen I already knew you were a horrible teenager but damn okay, I’m not mad, just disappointed, thanks though, I think I’m going to go home and process all this. Umm, you guys have a good time, I guess?” Sabrina said, it is quite obvious that she was hiding shock and sadness, she quickly assembled her stuff and was out the door before you could count to ten.
Neville had to go after a good two and a half hours of drinking, remembering he had a teacher conference and praying to god he had some pepper up potion, Ron left to cook dinner for Hermione who just had burned pasta “how do you even burn pasta?!” Ron had said, putting his coat on, excusing himself.
I'm back! This early? What! But it's only been 6 days! WOW! I'm really capable of things sometimes, huh.
“Why does she only ask for Ron and not me? I am offended,” Ginny huffed and sat down on top of the armrest. “Because Ron can cook and you can’t, dumbo,” George told her cheeringly, arm around his wife, Ginny stuck out her tongue in response. “YOUR ALARM TO DRINK WATER IS GOING OFF JUST SO YOU KNOW!” Ron interrupted the silence, screaming from the kitchen. They all watched as Hermione smiled before yelling back: “OKAY, THANKS,”
Which he might be.
Questions that were never answered.
“Well then don’t stand there like a fool, come in,” Draco said from the kitchen. And Potter walked carefully on the floor like it was made out of glass.  “This unexpectedly more… middle class than I imagined,” Potter commented on his way over to the sofa. “Is that a compliment or no?” Draco asked.
Draco got up and walked to his bedroom, getting his calendar to write that up.
Ginny stood up immediately, and following her they climbed two stairs up, far away enough from the rest of the family, they sat down together on the stairs and Ginny looked at him in question.
After much looking Draco’s hand finally found what it was looking for. “I found these in the manor the last time I visited,” Draco explained when Harry gave him a curious look, he took out what to the eye looked like any folder, “I’ve always been curious about the history behind magical families,” Harry nodded while Draco browsed, clearly looking for something specific, “Aha,” he said in triumph and gave Harry the folder.
Dinners, hard conversations and coming out.
“You’re together with someone!” Harry said to Ginny when they’d been realised from the dining table, “A girl?” Harry didn’t know if he sounded excited or terrified but hoped it was the first, “Yes?” Ginny crossed her arms, “Got a problem with that, Golden Boy?”
He’d stood, washing up his teacup when Pansy knocked on the door, slightly hoping it was Harry but knowing it wasn’t, he opened the door for her nonetheless. “Hi there,” Pansy said, stepping in, “thought I should take the muggle way this time because of what happened last,” she smiled at him and Draco returned it to the best of his ability, “thanks,” Pansy frowned, “what happened?” she asked carefully, walking up to Draco and examining him. “Fuck I think I like him Pans,” he said silently, dropping his head, Pansy hugged him then, Pansy clearly understanding that this realisation isn’t a positive one. “He woke up then just up and left,” Pansy walked over to her shoes and put them on again, “are you leaving?” Draco asked in disbelief, “yes and you’re coming with me,” Pansy said shoving Draco towards the hall so he could put on a jacket and shoes, “where are we going?” and Pansy shrugged, “the grocery store,” grabbing Draco’s keys for him and proceeding to shove him out the door when he was too slow.
Well at the house Draco shrugged off his jacket and went straight for the kitchen serving as a bar, he had clearly been here before. Harry shrugged off his jacket as well and followed him to the kitchen. “Hi,” he said to a guy with blue hair he recognized from somewhere who was on his way to the dancing area with another guy behind him. “Sab,” he heard Draco say, “Alcohol,” and he watched a blonde girl pour up vodka and something else Harry couldn’t tell in a glass before giving it to Draco.
“Git,” Ron says and elbows him in the ribs. “Ow,” Harry complains massaging the area where Ron hit him, “I didn’t defeat Voldemort for this” He then says sarcastically which results in him getting hit by a pillow. Which then resulted in a pillow fight.
“Mother, long time no see” Draco turned towards his mother who was looking at him curiously. “What?” he said as he noticed Potter was looking at him, a little-amused smile on his face. “Your hair is curly, dear,” his mother told him.
When they get out of the lecture Draco is more or less awake, not fully though. He’s still a little goggly, as they walk to the library to study a bit before getting lunch. Sabrina filming the entire thing, of course.
“Okay wow”
“Oh my god Draco you guys such assholes!” Draco put his head on the side, “What?”
“Yep, but Ron would go mad if he heard this part,”
“So Hermione is pregnant, I hear?” Seamus grinned over his beer glass, Ron puffed his chest out proudly, “sure is,” which made Seamus laugh, “you’re looking way too proud mate,” Seamus said, Dean with his arm around him protectively. “If someone’s gonna have kids out of us it’s him,” Harry said over his glass, pointing to Ron with his thumb, Seamus shrugged, “yeah I mean, me and Dean would’ve troubles doing that on our own and the rest of you are still single,” which made Neville shot his entire beer, “ey mate, chill out,” Seamus laughed when Neville put his glass down on the table, “rough day?” Harry nodded, “you don’t even KNOW,” Neville groaned, Harry snorted, “I feel ya though,”
“So,” Draco sat down and clasped his hands together after he’d gone taken the water of the kettle and preparing a tray of different teas as well as sugar and milk. “The trip,”
Just then Narcissa enters the living room with Andromeda who looks around at them and smiles, “I think it’s time for presents,” she says, and Teddy jumps up from his place on the sofa and chants “Presents! Presents! Presents!”
Draco, bamboozled, couldn’t do anything other than stare. “With you?” He repeated just to be sure he heard it right. “Yeah” Potter let out a breathy laugh. “I have always wanted to see Europe as well, but it’d be weird to go by yourself, would it not?” Potter turned his head and smiled at Draco who smiled back. “I guess so, let’s to it.”
“Well, umm, an old classmate I suppose?” Rowan raised her eyebrow at him, “He’s the godfather of my cousin as well, complicated history, OK!” Draco regretted saying this as soon as he had said it. He never really liked to admit that they were technically, kind of related family wise. Kind of an in-law situation now that he thought about it. But Rowan didn’t seem to sense the regret on his face and just said “Cool, could you? Get a word in for me?” She asked nervously. But Draco just rolled his eyes and walked back into the breakroom.
7:45 am
“Now that you're all here you can stop being so quiet” Teddy commanded and sat himself beside Potter on the sofa, turning his hair black to match Harry's.
Though the chapters are usually around 2 pages and this one is like... 7 pages so... enjoy. I gotta get back to those very intense studying sessions :'))
Draco slammed shut the cabinet he had opened, “You showed up here, unannounced! Which would’ve been fine if you did it the muggle ways but no! You had to choose the magical ways of things! If it literally was any other muggle both you and I would’ve problems with the ministry and you know it! You KNOW that ONE more misstep can make me lose all of my rights as a wizard forever! I could go to Azkaban Pansy! God” Draco sighed and rested his hands on top of the countertop.
The bus ride to his apartment lasts 20 minutes, 10 that he has to go by himself. He called them the procrastination minutes. Where his mind drifted away and he could imagine that everything was fine.
“Okay well, something else you’re looking for, or are you guys content with that?”
“Will you guys ever stop bullying me for not being able to cook?” Hermione shakes her head and the other two just laughed. “I guess I have my answer there,”
“Okay I think, I want to tell him today” She smiled at Harry, confidently yet not quite sure. “Any idea how?” Harry asked to which Hermione nodded and apparated them to that dark corner of town again.
Although believed to be fully pureblood there have been several instances where the Malfoy family has reproduced with half-bloods and even rich muggles before the statue of secrecy came into place. Because of them integrating with the muggles they became one of the richest wizarding families in the world. Not only rich, however, they are shown to have been or be a bunch of powerful witches and wizards, always earning between 7.0 and 9.6 on magical ability tests, the last one, made on Draco Malfoy (1980-present) at his birth has showed the highest one yet, scoring a 9.6, in contrast to his father, Lucius Malfoy II (1953-present) however who only scored 7.4 at the time of his birth his testing it is therefore believed that Draco Malfoy gained these powers through his mother Narcissa Malfoy née Black (1955-present). These powers are however rumoured to have lowered rather than gotten higher at the time of Draco Malfoy's graduation. Not only that but this extremely magical blood might go unused since Draco Malfoy as it seems has taken up studying medicine at the University of London and going back to his roots of integrating with muggles. In April 2000 there was a reported sighting of Draco Malfoy snogging Kevin Entwhistle a muggle-born from his year at Hogwarts in an alley outside a gay bar in London.
“Hero complex” Draco cooed which was when Harry turned around and left, Draco jumped out of bed after him, “Hey, where are you going?” he asked when he was greeted with Harry putting on his shoes, “My shift starts at 12,” Harry muttered, “okay, then you still have one and a half hour?” Draco leaned against the wall, not really wanting Harry to leave.
Well there he was greeted with hugs from every angle and it was practically impossible to get away, but he was home again, so it was fine. He was surrounded by people he considered family anyway.
“The trip,” Potter confirmed and an awkward silence spread between them as they just sat and stared at each other. “Oh goddamnit!” Draco exclaimed and walked over to the bookshelf aggressively, pulling out an atlas and returned to the couch, finding the Europe map as Potter stares intensely at him. “You said you wanted to go to Norway, yeah?” Draco asked as he scrolled. “Yes,” Potter replied. Draco squinted his eyebrows as he tried to think of a route to take, “Anywhere else?” Draco looked up at Potter as he studied the map. “How about… Poland? I want to visit Auschwitz, and also, I’ve heard they have an ice hotel in Sweden, like, completely made out of ice and stuff.”
9:37 am
Going by train meant first taking the bus for a half an hour from campus and then three hours if the trains not late to get to his aunt. After that a walk of 20 solid minutes and THEN he had reached his destination. Walking towards the house he could smell the meat being cooked. Knocking on the door he heard scrabbling inside before a certain boy with vibrant blue hair opened the door. “Draco!” he screeched and went to hug him but Draco stopped him. “Yes, hi there Teddy, but I'm drenched of the rain, I need to dry off first then we can hug okay?” Draco ruffled the boy’s hair as he stepped in.
,” The note had said, and Draco looked at him in annoyance, but Harry saw a smile trying to hide behind the surface and smiled innocently back at him.
Much to his surprise, Sabrina did not break into his house but rather, attack him when he got to work, much exhausted from not sleeping enough and Pansy being with him the whole day. “Good afternoon Mr Grinch” she greeted him cheeringly when he came through the back door and into the shop, he glared at her, causing her to giggle before going back into the main shop to help customers. Not before she could tell him to take the cashier though. Draco sighed as he clocked him, put on his polite smile and stood himself in front of the cashier.
“So Potter, are what the rumours are saying true?” Narcissa addressed him again, attempting to make conversation, “Harry,” He corrected her kindly before continuing, “What are the rumours saying? I’m not really following them,”
“Teddy, quidditch, our friends, conversion to the muggle world, war, etcetera.” Draco stopped and took a sip to from his wine before looking over at Potter. Who had his arms outstretched over the table staring at him. As silence fell between them again. “Hermione, she, she said you've changed from the war?” Potter tried and Draco cringed at his attempt. “Has she now?” He huffed against the wine glass before taking a sip and continue to twirl it. “Yeah, she said you’re like a completely different person in comparison to before the war.”
he thought to himself.
, Draco thought when he’d closed the door, returning to his bed, he had to be at Andromeda’s at 4 pm but that was a while until.
Draco groaned as he put his phone down, “what’s up?” Sabrina asked from beside him. “Nothing, nothing,” Draco said and sat up again. “No, what?” Sabrina continued, “I’m meeting Potter for lunch,” he said tiredly and rubbed his eyes, when he looked around the table he was sitting around with his university friends he saw Kevin looking curiously at him, “What?” he asked, Kevin shrugged, “Nothing,” Draco shrugged back, “Where?” Sabrina said, not looking up from her notebook, “I don’t know man, he’s meeting me outside in 20 min,” Draco replies and stretches and then grins, “Maybe I should start packing my things...” Sabrina looks at him in disappointment, “Draco you can literally write half a page in 20 minutes,” Draco rolled his eyes, still grinning, “You’re underestimating me,” Sabrina looked sideways, “Am I, Draco? Am I?” Draco nodded, “I can write 5 pages in 20 minutes if I really know my shit,” Sabrina raised her eyebrows, “But do you?,” Draco shrugged, “Nope,”
“Can I show you something? Alone?”
Draco nods, “Lucky I already have one,” Draco smirked shyly at Harry who felt like he couldn’t breathe.
“I literally just had my usual mental breakdowns, stop worrying so much, I’m fine,” Draco said into his cup of no-so-hot-anymore chocolate. “I don’t believe you but alright, I won’t mention it.” She stared right at the tv in front of them, without really looking at it. Draco didn’t mind her being here, she’s one of his best friends, what could he do.
Draco had only told Kevin that he was on medication, he knew what had gone down during the battle of Hogwarts, he’d been there after all, even though he’d been expelled for being muggle-born for the term. They were good friends by now, they went 8th year together and share most of their classes even now. He’s good to have, and Draco does the same for him when he has bad nights.
Harry had met the rest of them outside the pub, it was a muggle one which was all Harry really cared about. They waited for Neville to show up while they chatted about lord knows what he didn’t care, the bookstore Draco worked at was around the corner.
Oh, my clueless boys.
“Draco I don’t care if it takes an hour to explain, tell me!” Potter then exclaimed. At the sound of his first name, Draco did meet Potter’s eyes, the expression in them told Draco that he was frustrated. But instead of commenting the use of first names he said:
, making him coffee.
“Yes, actually”
“I wouldn’t.”
“Hiya,” Harry greeted and smiled and Draco smiled back, “Hello there,”
. He felt some kind of emptiness for not being able to know all these people.
*****
“It’s very stressful but it fine, how’s work? Pansy pissing you off?” Hermione snickered, “Yes” she deadpanned as she stared Parkinson in the soul.
“Might I suggest to not insult the Weasleys nor Ms Granger, not in front of me, Teddy nor Draco but especially not in front of Harry, they’re his family just as much as Draco is yours.” Narcissa got immediately quiet, then whispered, “Why is he even here?” rather aggressively. “Excuse you! He is Teddy’s godfather and has more of a right to be here than you!” He saw Andromeda turn and heard water starting to run. Narcissa tried to say something but did get to because Andromeda yelled, “Final!” deciding that he’d heard enough he crept back to the living room where Teddy and Draco were still sitting, now reading a book together.
“You know, you should get a driving license,” Harry says then and Draco looks up at him again, “why?”
Harry thought he was going crazy.
*****
Draco walked into the lecture hall and sat down a bit early, he took out the folder:
“I think you do understand exactly what I mean,” He said after he had composed himself, glaring at his mother who raised her hands in defeat. “Now, now” Andromeda calmed them.
Harry picked it up, it was quite heavy in his hand. He turned it around,
An hour later Harry sat with Draco and Teddy in the living room playing a board game, Andromeda and Narcissa in the kitchen cleaning up, though Harry suspected that is was just Andromeda who was doing the cleaning. Suddenly Harry hears voices being raised and looked up at Draco who stares back at him and mouths “Go,” nodding towards the kitchen and then looks back to the board game and Teddy. Harry makes an excuse that he has to go to the toilet and tiptoes towards the kitchen.
“Travel through Europe.”
Everyone filtered out to the field close to the place the party was held in Pansy herself climbing up on the roof to reveal several boxes of fireworks, there everyone stood, probably over 100 people in one place, standing close together to not freeze to death, chatting about their evenings and lives, most of them at least slightly intoxicated, Draco turned away from his friends to try and see if Sabrina was present, but he couldn’t find her anywhere. A little disappointed he turned back to the rest of his friend group and decided that her being mad at him shouldn’t ruin his evening.
“Fuck,” Draco sighed to himself as he tried to stand up and flex his neck, and grunted when it brought him nothing but pain.
I promise I haven't abandoned this fic, the process is just going, very slowly. I've learned my lesson though, I'm not gonna post until I'm completely done with a fic to 100% so I won't have to make changes and stuff. I'll keep posting this whenever I get done with a chapter but... ehhh, not the other ones I'm writing.
He ate the cereal standing, or well, leaned against the counter and tried to blink himself awake. When he was done he simply put his bowl down in the sink, deciding that, that was a problem for future him, slowly packing his bag and heading for his bus.
"Waddup!" Sabrina greeted him with a hug, not only from her though also her camera, Draco smiled tiredly and waved at the camera. "Today I, as I already told y'all both me and Draco here have an 8 am class. If you ever consider going to uni, please, for the love of God, do not take any 8 am classes. They're torture, right Draco?" Draco, who had been staring off in the distance not concentrated just nodded in agreement, pretending he had heard what Sabrina said. “See, he’s gone and we haven’t even gone inside yet,”
“I just really don’t like the Weasleys why is that so bad?!” He hears Narcissa claim. “Even if you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to tell us that constantly, the world has changed Cissy,” the nickname coming through pained. “Changed to what?” She bit back, he hears Andromeda sigh before saying, “Look, if Harry were to insult the Malfoy family you would be completely outraged, wouldn’t you?”
With his bag packed and fancy coat thrown over his black turtleneck, he shugs a glass of water, turns off the lights and exits his apartment. He jogs down the stairs while pulling up his app for bus times. Next one coming in 2 min. He jogs faster, out and around the corner and run straight into someone, Pansy. “I’m sorry Pansy but my bus comes any second I gotta go,” Pansy almost jumps up and run after him, “Where you going?” She asks. “Harry’s job” Pansy give him a sideways look, “why?” Draco rolls his eyes and walks faster, “Merlin Pansy, do I have to have a reason for everything I do?”
Harry puts the presents in the pile, after he charmed them to the right sizes, of course. And sits down between Draco and Teddy, Teddy who soon rushed up to give out the presents to everyone. Teddy, of course, ending up with the most, since he was the youngest but also probably the easiest to buy for, Harry himself had gotten him three while he’d gotten the others one.
, Harry told himself.
Calling Harry Potter a coward is probably the last thing Draco should’ve done.
Eventually, the store does quiet down and there are just a few customers walking between the rows of bookshelves. “I’m exhausted,” he said as he walked behind the counter to go on break. “Are you going on a break?” the cashier, Rowan asked him. “Yeah, I’ve been out there talking to customers for 2 and a half hours straight without any break.” Rowan nodded, “Go on then, I’ll call on you if needed,” she said as Draco walked to the breakroom. Rowan and he were the only ones on duty now that the others had gone home, Draco was pretty glad that Sabrina wasn’t in today, he didn’t want to deal with the confrontation nor awkwardness that’d come when they meet again, he just wasn’t ready for that as of yet. He sat himself down on a chair on the table where the stains of his coworkers eating their lunches in a hurry were obvious he rested his elbows and cupped his head with his hand.
And so, Hermione gave all three (including Malfoy) a greeting hug. Something she never would’ve done 9 years ago back in 6th year. Not even while influenced by an imperio and it was mutual.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay, I’ll be by the entrance in 20 minutes”
Several drawings and a dinner later he and Potter had been left at the dinner table as Andromeda went up to up Teddy to bed and Narcissa had gone home. Potter was staring out the window where the previous rain had turned into snow and Draco was twirling his wine glass around. The silence was very tense, neither of them willing to break it.
He watched as Draco put his stone on his robes again and felt his heart sink a little for him.
It's been over a month, again! What the hell...
Hours came and went, customers came and went, but Draco stayed. He’d gotten done with his essay around 11 and stayed to chat with Harry during the last hour of the shift and saying hello to the next employées coming in to replace Harry.
And so Harry took his stuff and checked out to stand to wait for Hermione at the door.
“Wanna travel the entirety of Europe this summer with me?”
Kevin turned to Craig, “will you dance without me for a while, yeah?” Craig raised an eyebrow but walked towards the dance floor, as soon as he was gone Kevin turned to him again, “either that or he forgot his meds, or both,” when Harry looked at him in question, Kevin looked around before walking even closer to Harry, “listen, I really shouldn’t tell you this, since his thing to say and not mine but since we’re in the situation we are and you’re you so I’m assuming you take them too,” Kevin finally stopped to breath, and take a sip, “PTSD pills, magic ones more specifically, they completely erase all your symptoms and you don’t get flashbacks and stuff,” Harry nodded, “I took them a while back” Kevin nodded back at him and rested his arm on Harry’s shoulder, “They’re horrible to come off and everything becomes so much stronger, remember?” Harry nodded and tried to not remember when he came of them. “If he’s forgotten them this party won’t do him any good, more the other way around than anything,” Kevin says and downs his drink, “just thought I should alert you,” Kevin backed into the dancefloor, yelling after him “I’ll keep an eye out!”.
“Never thought I’d hear Draco and gay pornography in the same sentence, yet I just did, hello, can I help you with something?” A woman rounded the corner looking Hermione up and down with a smile, before turning to Harry, probably to do the same but stopped when she saw his face in full view.
“Draco?” Pansy asked nervously after they’d sat a while in silence eating ice cream on Draco’s couch. “What?” Draco sighed back. “You know, you are not a bad person, right? I saw some quote on Pinterest, is it called that?” Draco nodded and she continued “It said ‘who we are and who we need to be to survive are two completely different things’, or something like that.”  Draco sighed again into his ice cream. “Those quotes are bullshit you do know,” Draco looked over at her and smiled, not quite genuine but one of those small little innocent smiles that you share with friends in happy times.
For it is tea and slightly intoxicated and weird conversations that have an even weirder outcome
Pansy looked towards the fireplace, “don’t you have school?” she asked, “don’t you have work?” Draco responded. Quiet. “yeah,” Pansy said, they stared at each other for a second, “did you have any hangover potion?” Draco asked, eating a bit more ice cream, “nah, my head hurts like shit,” Pansy sniggered, Draco rolled his eyes and stood up, walking over to his bedroom. Bringing back a hangover potion which Pansy eyes suspiciously, “how old is this?”
Neville arriving took him back to earth, they went inside, got a table, drink, all while chatting loudly. Harry would’ve skipped but this was the first time all five of them had gone out drinking in a long while.
he thinks, massaging his temples and then leans back into his chair,
“But if the earlier wearer can’t wear it anymore, it is passed down to the oldest son, even if he’s not married yet. But he can’t put his name down until he is,” Harry’s eyes fell to his stone, he read
“So tomorrow is valentines” Sabrina looks around at them all while holding the camera up so everyone was i view, most of them nodded along. “And someone is hosting the yearly valentines party, which of you are going?” the entire gang either raised their hand in confirmation or said “me” except for Draco, who didn’t feel like going at all, upon seeing this Sabrina zoomed in on his face “Are you not going Draco?” She teased, “Don’t feel like it,” he said, shrugging, “Oh well, be home and cry over that you’re single then, your choice” Draco just shrugged tiredly again.
“No just insecure” Hermione calmly answers and kisses Ron’s forehead before standing up to greet them.
He remembers being 19 years old. Having his magic taken away and learning to live like those he had despised his whole life and actually liking it more this way. He remembers realising he was gay and crying for hours by himself because no one will ever love him now. As a gay man without magic.
Harry had gone home to take a shower, it’s not that he lied to Draco about it, he did take a shower, his shift did start at twelve. But it did feel like he was lying, to whom he did not know. Perhaps himself or worse, to Draco. Draco doesn’t deserve that. But when Harry stood in the shower thinking back to Draco in trackies and a jumper, quietly reading while drinking tea, so what if he got hard by the sight of it? Doesn’t necessarily mean he’s gay, especially not for, for Draco fucking Malfoy, not that it’s anything bad being Draco Malfoy but, it’d be weird, Harry’s mind decided.
“I need alcohol,” Draco said after a while and started to walk at a faster pace towards the house. “That’s not healthy buddy,” Harry said, jogging to come up to Draco’s side again, Draco waved him away.
The entire time they were walking towards Draco’s apartment they were quiet. They walked side by side, although Draco did notice the look on Potter’s face and how he kept looking at him like he wanted to say something, finally on the last set of staircases by grabbing his jacket sleeve.
“We meet again,” Ron said bittersweetly, “Hello to you too,” Draco retorted, “Have you been trying to seduce my girlfriend eh?” He asked Draco thought it sounded rather sarcastic he couldn’t be sure but went for it anyway. “Yeah, you know, kiss her one last time until she’s mine,” Draco said, smiling behind his glass of vodka and took a sip. Hermione laughed, she laughed so much she doubled over, “What’s so funny?” Harry asked from beside Ron, though be did have an amused smile playing on his own face, Hermione straightened herself and looked over at Draco who tried to look innocent. “Nothing,” She said, casting a knowing look towards Draco and winked before dragging Ron towards the dancefloor. “What have you done?” “Nothing,” Draco replied, sipping from his glass before adding, “This time,” when Harry raised an eyebrow. “So you decided to join the party huh?” Draco smirked playfully nudging Harry in the shoulder who shoved him back, “Come on let’s get you up and on the dance floor,” Draco said before swallowing the rest of his drink and setting the glass down before takin Harry by the arm and dragging him there,
“I guarantee you, because, if this is Colin Creevey we’re talking about, which I’m pretty sure it is?” Pansy waited for Sabrina to nod before continuing. “He died a hero’s death, I know it doesn’t make it any better, you still lost him,” Pansy looked up at Draco who smiled a sad smile. “A lot of death happened that day, I know nothing can justify what that death eater did to him, but at least they’re dead...or in prison...”
“The Potter family,” Draco read for him, “A very old family, direct descendants from none other than Ignotus Peverell, the third brother from the child's tale, the deathly Hallows and Linfred of Stinchcombe nicknamed ‘the Potterer’ from which the surname has sprung from, a pioneering potioneer whose today credited with creating many original medical potions.” Harry stared at the text that Draco was somehow reading upside down, “And here-” Draco pointed at a line, “Ever since the 12th century the Potters have been from Great Britain or Ireland until Fleamont Potter (1892-1979) married Indian Euphemia Khida (1890-1980) and had James Potter (1960-1981) possibly making him the first biracial Potter since its founding.” Harry read out loud, “Go on,” Draco egged, “James Potter then went on to marry muggle-born Lily Evans (1960-1981) and had their first and only son Harry Potter (1980-present) possibly making him the first half-blood Potter in centuries.”
He opened the cabinet again and took out two bowls. “Want some ice cream?” He asked bitterly. “Yes please?” Pansy answered politely.
“So you’re coming,” Pansy concluded on the phone and Draco couldn’t help but sigh. “I guess,” He replied, “Yes!” Pansy cheered, “Oh and bring Potter,” she added before hanging up on him. Pansy was hosting a New years party that literally anyone was invited to, as she said ‘I decide that you’re a guest, you, my guest, brings another guest and so it goes on and on' Draco had, however, long ago decided to not pressure Harry to come to a social event with him ever, mostly because of what happened during Christmas. Not that he really had invited him to that, but still. If Harry happened to show up, he can play it off as he invited him, but he doubted it.
“Potter I don't know if you know but we have plenty in common” Draco kept twirling his wine glass around without looking up. “Like?” Potter asks doubtfully. And Draco side-eyed him.
A loud cheering boomed within the huge crowd and Pansy set off the fireworks to join the rest of them that were not lighting up the sky.
I hope you all are keeping busy with school and social distancing because I sure fucking am.
“You can’t deny that he HAS changed a lot though. I mean he’s almost done with university and is sentence is over and he still lives like a muggle, it’s pretty surprising.” That made Harry pause. “Wait, sentence? But he got freed from all charges, didn’t he?” Harry was confusedly staring at Hermione who signed. “He was freed from going to prison, he got a much lighter thing instead, after 8th year he wasn’t allowed to use magic for 3 years. He could barely go to magical places, guys they literally took his wand and put a tracker on his magic.” Hermione finished, Harry was staring down at the table head in his hands and Ron was staring at Hermione.
“It’s very you I suppose,” He told her while she was busy looking through one, Hermione nodding in thought. “I think this one will be good, want to get something to read?” when Harry shook his head she snickered a little bit “You know, Draco told he they have a full section of gay pornography in the back”
“You’re watching something?”
With his backpack on his pack, he walked towards the bathroom and locked after himself. He took off his glasses and then his jumper and stared plainly at his chest in the mirror. There, in the middle of his chest where a lightning bolt. Identical to the one on his forehead but newer and hidden to the world. He ran his fingers over it before sighing and putting on his dress robes in a hurry.
Pansy throws a new year's party
“So, I should probably leave,” Pansy said, after having helped Draco to eat an entire box of ice cream. “Yeah” Draco burped from the sofa. “Ew!” Pansy hit him teasingly. “Shush, you do this all the time” He smiled back at her.
“Draco Malfoy, 25, medical student, London. Sometimes life is just so utterly destroyed in so many ways but you just gotta stick with it. What the fuck Malfoy, okay so, wait, 835 THOUSAND followers, bitch from where.” Harry read Malfoy’s profile out loud to his kitchen. “And a verification bar, that’s just great isn’t it, wow.”
As they approached the house the party was held in they heard the music become louder and louder, “You think we’re gonna be deaf after this, yeah?” Harry said jokingly, looking over at Draco who stared blankly in front of them as they walked, “Hey, are you okay?” Draco nodded, but Harry wasn’t convinced, “are you sure?” he said, now suddenly worried, “yeah,” Draco breathed, not meeting Harry’s eyes, even though they stopped. “Really?”
The world is weird.
, Harry’s mind supplied while he walked up the second flight of stairs,
“Okay, so you dragged me away from the rest of the family for gossip?” Harry shrugged, “Might’ve” Ginny snorted and shook her head, “Luna,” Harry looked happily at her, “Really?” Ginny nodded, clearly amused by the situation at hand, “Okay but, question,” Harry began looking at Ginny gestured for him to go on, “How does that work, don’t you just like either girls or boys?” Ginny raised an eyebrow, “No?”
You could practically cut the tension between them.
“So how’s school going Draco?” Harry hears Narcissa speak to her son gently, watches as Draco glances at his mother before looking back at his food, starting to slowly chew again. After swallowing he slowly says, “Stressful… but fun,” Harry watches him, he guesses that he’d waited for his mother to comment something rude about muggle schools, but instead she smiles at him and tells him, “Well, that’s good,”
“It’s not like I’m the ideal friend for him, Sabrina. Everyone loves him and hates me, it won’t look good on him, he’ll change his mind.”
When Harry looked up from the paper Draco was looking at him, “It’s cool right?” Harry nodded and looked down at the page again, “That’s the stone you gave me,” and pointed at the picture of the stone that he was constantly wearing nowadays, “yeah,” Draco sighed, “Was this the- uhh, the research you did?” Draco suddenly straightened himself, “No, that- this is a compilation from all the research I did, there’s- there is a whole book on wizarding families in England, this is just a summary I made,” Harry smirked, “and when was this book released?” Draco shrugged, “2000,”
“Are you guys going to get married as well?” Molly asked out of nowhere and Ron and Hermione fell silent, smiles falling as they looked at each other, “Not yet,” He quickly commented but added, “But someday, maybe,” mostly to his mothers pleasure, Molly seemed to think that answer was good enough, that or she saw how visibly uncomfortable they both got. “Oh well never mind that then,” She had said, clapping her hands together and her eyes drifted to Harry, “Won’t you be bringing someone next year?”
“Draco!” Pansy face showing up through the fireplace, making Sabrina, whom Draco was hanging out with at the time, jump up from her place on top of his sofa and scream. “DRACO THERE’S A FLOATING HEAD IN YOUR FIREPLACE!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you want some tea? I can put the kettle on,” Draco asked, again trying to start a conversation, and while he kind of succeeded it was very awkward. A “Yes, please,” could be heard from the other side of the room where the sofa was. After putting the kettle on Draco turns around and sees Potter on the other side of the room, sitting in his sofa, uncomfortably. Draco walks over to his sofa and sits down beside Potter. “You do know my mother thinks this is very cheap and insisted that she’d give me access to our vault,” He says, taking in the one bedroom apartment that he was currently living in. “You don’t have access to your family’s vault?” Potter asked, raising an eyebrow. “Do you really think I’d be working if I’d have access to a vault with enough money to support me as well as several generations after me?”
“Oh, now I get why you work I guess.”
Now the blue-haired guy was back in the kitchen with the other guy behind him, he was ever so close to Draco, either about to kiss the other dude or to have a very private conversation. The blue-haired guy trying to take Draco’s drink away from him. At this point, Harry had to step forward.
For it is now that Harry's life says "SIKE" and hits him with unexpected shit
“Go on, it’ll be fine, but if you really mess up, you’ll just get to the manor, please stay in my apartment until I’ve gotten there so I know you came right,” Draco fussed and almost pushed Harry into the fireplace. “Alright, alright,” Harry gave up and took his boots and jacked in one hand so he could take floopowder into the other. “And then you say ‘Malfoy apartment’” Draco nodded at him to continue. Harry took a deep breath. “Malfoy apartment!” He said and flooed away.
When Harry woke up on the 24th of December and felt the breath of Christmas up his nose. His neighbours were baking some delicious Christmas food and he could smell it two floors up. His covers were warm, and he knew the rest of his apartment was cold. Forcing himself out of the bed he stretched and yawned. He walked over to the kitchen, making sure not to trip over the pile of Christmas presents, and made himself some scrambled eggs and toast, preparing to get all Christmassy and go over to Andromeda's house to celebrate Christmas with Teddy. Harry had never spent Christmas anywhere else but at Hogwarts and at the Weasleys and didn’t quite know what to expect and therefore he’s also is very nervous. He’s going to spend the 24th with the ancestors to the Black family, which he was pretty sure he also was a long-lost ancestor of but still.
“Draco gave it to me,” Harry told her, “And look,” Harry said turning it around, “That’s my dad’s name,”
“What?” Harry asked he was mopping the floors. He looked up at Malfoy that moment. And Harry was not sure to believe Hermione when she said that he’d changed. Studying Malfoy in silence before continuing to mop the floor. He heard Malfoy take a sharp breath, “Do you-” He started and Harry stopped his mopping once again to look up at Malfoy, “Do I what?”
“Nothing, nothing,” George said in defeat and walked over to the kitchen to ask if he can help with anything. “At least she has Ronald,” Hermione sighed and rested her head on Harry’s shoulder after he sat down next to her, “The only one who can actually cook anything but basics,” Bill said looking up from playing with his kids on the carpet. Charlie snorted, “Yeah, I think Ron took all of our combined cooking skills,”
Harry
, his mind supplied helplessly when he saw his face and carefully laid down beside him again.
7:42 am

“Have a good night sleep then, or something. May the bed bugs eat you alive, or something like that.” Pansy said and disappeared. Draco muttered, “May the bed bugs eat you alive, what a bitch.”
“I am not having this conversation with you right now Herm, how’s the baby getting along?” Harry counters while pouring up half of the food he made in a lunch box and the rest on a plate. “Hey don’t change the subject like that!”
“All the potential talent,” George said dramatically, coming back from the kitchen, three baby plates, glasses and cutlery walking over to the kids' table neatly placed in between the kitchen and the living room.
, Draco thinks to himself.
“It’s complicated” He answered, still staring at Potter’s hand.
, he then whispered to himself. Trying to casually walk away but most likely failing.
He remembers being 15 years old, Voldemort was back and he knew, he could not tell anyone or the family reputation will crumble once again. His father had told him.
“Sounds interesting”
Then he met Malfoy in the grocery store, this time saw Malfoy saw him as well. Harry remembers the awkward meeting where they just stood and stared at each other until Malfoy pushed past him to get to the vegetable aisle. Not a single word was spoken between them.
Soon enough Molly and Ron waved them all in for dinner and they sat down around the giant table that stood out from them, Bill and Percy but their kids around the kids' table and gave them food before sitting down. Molly looked fondly at them before jokingly saying, “We’ll see how many more grandkids come along until next year,”
They’d gone downstairs again, tea gone cold they sat at the kitchen table enjoying each others company.
He wonders to himself. The café must be super busy on valentines.
“Uncle Draco was born with curly hair like the rest of the Blacks.” Potter mused and bent down to keep colouring. “Uncle Draco's a Black? Like grandma was?” Teddy asked. Draco smiles. “Great-aunt Narcissa here was a Black, I'm simply the offspring of an ex-Black” Draco stated. “What does offspring mean?” Draco could hear Teddy whisper in Potter's hear and Potter's whispers back.
