However, instead of Ginny, in toppled a lanky teenager with a shock of blue hair on his head. The poor fellow had tripped over seemingly nothing at all, and that was when Harry knew that this was none other than his Teddy.
"Yeah, you like that?" comes a muffled, yet clearly spoken inquiry from a gravelly throat that is absolutely
It was incredibly humiliating, but while Lucius was cross about the affair for the rest of the day, it had been more than made up for when Draco had given him petulant, apologetic puppy dog eyes for the duration of his silent treatment.
with fervour each time he thrusted and clenching it tightly in its sweet heat each time he made to pull out. Harry saw him bite his lip, actively trying to hold back, but despite his best efforts he couldn't help but let his moans escape.
He tried to think of how it would be, if he and Malfoy were eachother's boyfriend in the present day. He imagined them doing normal, boyfriendly things, like getting caught by a parent without it being a nil operation on Harry's end, or Lucius Malfoy and the possible risk of a stray Cruciatus on Malfoy's.
"Come along, young one," the jolly spirit said, and in the blink of an eye, Harry found himself in a rather stylish bedroom fit for a celebrity.
"Hermione Point. Nice," Harry acknowledges, and Ron ducks his head in thanks, "and no! That's bollocks."
Draco thinks furiously, this is the third time today! What is he, following him? Lord and Heavens above, he might actually be in real danger now.
"Pardon my directness, but are we speaking about Potter's deceased, married father?" Draco's voice climbs in pitch with every next word.
They moved back into the kitchen where the children, recharged from their sugary desserts, all pounced upon future-Harry with vigour. Teddy hugged him, and passed him the baby.
"Cheers," the man nodded, before he was pushed rudely out of the way by a rather dishevelled Malfoy.
Harry shoots him a venomous look out of the corner of his eye, "He attempted to murder the Headmaster and smuggled dozens of people from the- dark side- past high level magical security who killed him in his stead."
Inside the room, on one large bed lay two teenagers: one with golden blond hair that curled at the edges, the other with bright green eyes.
"Your obsession with Pretty, Blonde, Bitchy Women!" Ron exclaims, thoroughly exasperated, "And Malfoy's one of em! That's why you're being so-"
"I must go now," Draco eases out of his chair and- don't tell Potter- kisses Lucius on his cheek, "draft an acceptance letter..."
Auror in charge of the Slytherin's weekly checkup, which in turn meant that Malfoy was the only Death Eater ("ex") that he had to check on.
"I can't believe you're just allowing us all to be collectively tortured with poncey, frilly uniforms but decide it's time to put your foot down when it comes to inviting a kid who made one too many 'yo momma' jokes in school."
do let me know what you think in the comments please! i'd really appreciate it. my twitter is @dracominnie as always if you'd like to be friends ^^
Then again, perhaps those were things Malfoy had been attracted to, he wondered as he dried his hands on a towel, would Malfoy still feel the same? With an only slightly broader Harry and a noticeably more handsome Malfoy?
story). But he will not- absolutely will not tolerate his son, proud heir to the Malfoy line and fortune,
on the other hand is exactly as the name suggests: an unsurprisingly consistent series of gossip scoops acquired from the mouths of Harry’s worryingly large ‘fanbase’ of stalkers and obsessives.
"Are you Harry's boyfriend?" he blurts out sincerely, and Malfoy's lip curls. He may not be terrified of the blond's very presence anymore, but shouldn't have been stupid enough to assume he's harmless.
"Pathetic," the blond spits, and Dudley's heart is pounding, truly terrified for once at what seems to be an enemy of Harry's, armed and dangerous and in his kitchen, "I shouldn't even be wasting my time with the likes of stinking vermin like-"
With a groan, he hoists himself out of the beanbag in front of the monitor, tossing his PS2 controller aside carelessly. The door creaks only slightly when he eases it open and tiptoes down the hallway. He's perfected his stealth technique, of course, from the times he and Piers have snuck out late and stolen Dad's car out of the garage and into the town.
Suddenly Draco's face was very close, and his lips were on his own in a chaste, sweet kiss. "And it makes me want to say something possibly incriminating," he whispered, "we wouldn't want that to happen now would we?"
"Fuck you," says the other person who's got a regal male accent, and there's a wet noise that Molly doesn't want to believe is a kiss, "let's get the fuck out of here. You owe me a set of underpants, the responsibility to keep me warm on the way there cause all i've got is this stupid old robe," he lowers his voice as if it makes a difference, "and your tongue up my asshole."
“I want you… more,” he whispered back, leaning forward to lick at Harry’s lower lip. He closed his eyes against the feeling, fingers tightening on Draco’s body.
Future-Harry's head snapped up the second the word 'whore' started to form on Ginny's lips. His eyes came alive, even more than they had around the kids, but with plain fury instead of a smile.
"This is mad talk," Ron squeaks, and the shock of both his best friends (one of them being his fiancée!) having opinions so drastically at odds with his own shocks him back into his perpetual state of hunger. He picks up his no doubt cold turkey sandwich and continues devouring it, as he should, "Hermione, I know all this planning is stressing you out, and you must be in a fragile headspace at this moment, and I forgive you. But from you, Harry? Are you sure this isn't just your... little
He didn't bother to hide his moan as Draco pulled back and sunk down again. Harry's cock hit the back of his throat, the slick heat of Draco's mouth madly erotic around him. He shut his eyes briefly, but promptly reopened them because he
It had taken Harry a disorienting lift ride and a steadying countdown from ten to arrive at Malfoy's door.
it!" Draco yanks the frame out of his father's hands and places it face down on the table once again.
With a frustrated moan, Malfoy shucked the fabric off of his cock, enfolding the appendage in his left fist. His right, meanwhile, was stretched out over the cleft between his thighs, a third finger now wriggling its way into his impossibly tight hole.
He did not need to wonder long, though, for Malfoy paused with a hand on his hip, thinking. Once he'd decided on whatever he had, he threw one of the towels to the floor (where it conveniently vanished), and strolled his way over to a handsome dresser.
Gingerly, Harry trudged forward. He could see Draco peeking at him over his shoulder, his breaths coming fast and heavy as he scissored long fingers into his pretty pink arsehole.
"I know exactly where my tie went after that football match, and I know all about your little black book filled with paper secrets," he told him, "I know what you did in your room last night, I know you're not planning on stopping anytime soon
"I be speeding this part up, it be too lengthy and tiresome," the Elf said in a bored fashion, and waved its hand. The scene, in turn, sped up to twice its original speed.
is one if the best things Moody had introduced them to-- aside from Malfoy in ferret form, of course-- and Ron should really remember to live by it more often.
"It is certainly not him," Lucius sniffs, taking the frame and placing it gently next to a photograph of Draco at two years old, already bashing fellow out-of-frame toddlers over their heads with a teething ring and a nasty expression. It's great to start building character at a young age.
"We're just here for his weekly parole checkup," Watson elaborated calmly, "It's usually Auror Potter's job, but he's off today."
"I'm so glad I met you," the brunet sighed dreamily, and Ron wanted to gag; Malfoy had his best mate wrapped around his little finger!
Draco was not given a chance to react before Harry’s tongue was licking a hot stripe across his opening. Draco screamed, twitching and thrashing against his grip. He smiled, tasting the the clean, heavy flavour of musk, of
He casts a glance in his mate's direction, but the redhead's eyes have gone misty and he's gazing at Hermione with love-hearts in them.
Malfoy makes a sound somewhere between a moan and a scream, and suddenly they're moving, the bed rocks and shudders under the combined weight of the two boys and they're... bouncing. Up and down, in and out, screaming and moaning and what not. "More"s and "faster"s and "oh oh
The darkened halls are not hard to navigate through, although getting to the foor above is certainly a bit of a time consuming hassle, especially considering the sheer size of the mansion. Once he has reached Draco's doors though- large, hefty and embellished with intricate hand crafted dragon heads- he finds that his son and the rugged fool that is defiling his virtue, have already gotten into the brunt of their sexual encounter.
On the other hand, Draco has been seeing this same pool boy (speculatively speaking) several and frequently repeated times over the course of the month. Lucius does not want to pressure his son into marrying someone of his father's choice, as his own parents had done to him (and oh lord, was that a
"Hey... Gin," he greeted mildly, before averting those dead, dead eyes of his. They swam with guilt.
Draco's palms were splayed firmly over his back, fingers spread wide so as to feel as much of the brunet as he possibly could. They trembled, and Harry smoothed his own arms over the side of his neck, the line of his shoulders and the silk of his flaxen hair. Over and over and over again.
“And while you do it, I want you to watch me- watch us. I want to watch us having sex in the mirror. Wouldn't that be nice?”
His lover turned his head slowly, silver hair tumbling lethargically with the movement as he mouthed against the very corner of Harry’s jaw. He extended his tongue- historically laden with bitter insults and snide remarks- and licked a tight stripe over the skin there.
"We had to come here for a parole checkup on account of Harry's absence from work," cut in a new voice--
Both parties were infuriatingly vocal, choosing to announce every little thing they were feeling for some reason. Ron had half a mind to dash out the doorway and never look back. Hermione was absolutely right when she commented, all those months ago at dinner, that she'd never step foot in Malfoy Manor again for fear of it being traumatic regardless of how much it's been refurbished.
Gracefully, he turns around to face the group. There’s nothing unusual about Potter’s expression as his eyes light up in recognition. Perhaps it’s because the lovelorn tightness of his jaw has been ever present in Draco’s vicinity. He’s never known him any other way.
"Pubes?!" Hannah Abbot shrieks as she walks by, nearly tripping over her heels in the process and scuttling away as soon as she recovers. Harry grimaces; they really need to get a new gathering spot. Smack in the centre of the Ministry cafeteria is a horrible place to be discussing Harry's fondness towards:
Oh, but he shouldn't be thinking about that now. Especially since the bastard had left him in favour of a ginger woman! Ginger! The greatest of evils, surely. Not to mention, she was also a mudblood, but it was high time Lucius buried that hatchet.
"Good morning, Sir!" he greeted with a bright smile, upon catching Harry's eye, "If I could have your name, and the name of the resident you will be visiting today?"
Lo and behold! The thin duvet is thrown off unceremoniously and two pale bodies tangle together in a mess of arms and legs and- cock! Harry's got his cock out! And it's- grudgingly- quite sizeable.
Malfoy panted deeply like he'd done after the fight from earlier, his body relaxing slowly and gradually as the tie came undone and the toy grew visibly more uncomfortable for him to sit on. He vanished it swiftly, and swished his wand again to rid himself and his book of bodily fluids.
"Oh hell," Harry shut his eyes and tried his best to push down the wave of pleasure that washed over him lest he cum into Draco's mouth. He'd probably like that too, but he had something else in mind for him.
"Put it in me," he whispered rather loudly, bucking his hips up into his fist and sticking his fingers deep into his arse.
He whimpered while suckling on them, head bobbing as if his fingers were a cock he was ordered to suck to save his own life. All too quickly, the blond had exhausted his skin of his rival's essence and he pulled off with an obscene wet pop.
“Fuck,” Harry breathed, and saw his glasses fog up with the heat of it, “so damn tight, Draco. Are you sure you let that guy fuck you last night?”
He kissed him again, even as he pushed Draco over to the toilet and eased him down onto its closed lid. Obediently, he parted his legs to allow Harry to stand bracketed between them.
"Want you-" index and middle fingers disappeared into the no doubt velvety warmth that was Malfoy's hole, "I won't- won't tell. I won't ever tell anyone, ever. Promise. Just- please, Potter."
"A splash of milk will do," he replied, and watched as the other man's hand resumed its designated path toward the tiny vessel of milk. His pinky retained a delicate curl while he poured precisely the amount of milk Harry wanted, and stayed that way when he passed him the cup.
It wasn't until now that he realized how farfetched his mission truly was. The oddity of saying the blond's first name aloud was, in itself, a massive wake-up call what with how foreign it tasted on his tongue. It didn't matter that he'd wanted to mouth the syllables of Malfoy's name again and again in his days to come: till saying it felt like coming home- oh, damn it all. He'd never so much as spoken the man's
Harry expected to have felt something, anything at all, at the knowledge of having been promoted to such a high rank in the corps. The desolate state of his prophesied private life however, prevented him from such thoughts.
Harry slid out of Draco almost completely, and snapped his hips hard. The blond stuttered forward, with another loud moan a fierce yet playful look in his eyes boring into him as he caught his stare. He eyed his lover’s body in the vanity, his pale limbs and rosy nipples, his toned torso and his hard cock that was flushed pink and practically leaking against his stomach.
Gunmetal grey irises turned languidly towards the lump next to him and Malfoy blinked once- so slowly that it came out looking truly terrifying. He then did it again.
Bobbing his head so he was fucking him with his tongue, Harry used his free hand to massage the top of the blond’s thigh, to run over the side of his flank and give his cock a teasing little
"-is OBSESSED with fair haired babes! That's right: grab your bleaching potions, ladies! It's time to go blonde!"
"I do, quite," Malfoy agreed softly. His eyes darted back and forth between the two boys, rapid and calculative. Harry did not know what the point was, as not only had he heard them, but Albus' chest was completely bare.
Harry was on his feet faster than Draco could finish his sentence, and was struggling against his jeans by the time he'd started another.
"They're a perfect delight," future-Harry said, and shrunk in the face of her renewed fury, "I mean, they are. If I didn't have work, I'd be very happy to look after them instead. But you
And Harry shuts him up, somehow, grabbing him by his bony ankles and hurling him forward so that his legs come to bracket his waist.
hi, everyone! it's been a while. i've not been feeling particularly hilarious lately, so there's been a significant gap between me writing this chapter and the last. nevertheless, i wanted to make the story progress so here's a ~slightly humorous~ update to the series
"Mister Draco Malfoy be starting now," the Elf said prophetically, and before Harry could utter so much as a 'huh?', Malfoy shot a quick glance at the entrance, brought his contaminated fingers to his face again-
"Is- this what you saw, Potter?" his voice sounded high and strained. Draco's long, slender thighs quivered when he twisted his fingers inside himself, "See me- f-f-uck myself silly? Does that turn you on?"
"Lucky for you, we're not quite finished yet," Draco said, as she took her time kissing the air next to Harry's cheek and cooing at Scorpius.
"You did not," Malfoy said nonchalantly, and began to pick at the fabric of his sofa with nimble fingers. His feet were bare again, and his toes were a delightful shade of baby pink.
His own eyes, apparently: Draco had only seen it about three times but it had been quite evident that it was a tiny little painting of a... somewhat buff Potter in his underwear. Jesus H. He really doesn't want to know anything about it, and Lucius, thankfully, does not seem inclined to share.
The two men exchanged a bewildered look at the weirdly brash elf's tone. You'd expect a Malfoy house elf who's
to come in now. If not for the standard monitoring process then because of the suspicious information you've shared with us--"
"Any sugar? Milk?" Malfoy inquired, and Harry noted carefully the way his fingers hovered over the creamer before he’d even agreed.
"Potter, Potter-!" he gasped, before Harry covered his mouth with his own again. Draco's lips were softer than they looked, and better than Harry could have ever imagined. The slope of his nose fit wonderfully with Harry's, and the sharp jut of his chin against his own was nowhere near enough to distract Harry from the wonderful warmth of Draco's mouth.
What's a 'Muggle'? The way the blond practically spit the word out leads Dudley to believe it's not a very nice thing to be.
In a matter of seconds, the belt came undone, as did his fly, then his hands fell away. He moved them to the sides of his torso and spread them out for Draco to see, tipping his head in a little gesture that said 'go ahead'.
There's a grey lump where his cousin sleeps under the covers, and it's uneventful for a while. Dudley's about to leave when the covers shift and scuffle.
"VANESSA THORNBERRY!!" Harry shouts, leaping out from the comfort of his bed and wrapping his arms around himself reflexively, for whatever reason. He's panting hard and searching fervently for the aforementioned woman, only to find a rumpled bed, a blurry Ron Weasley at the door and a Wizarding radio playing- you guessed it- 'Hips Don't Lie' at a tinny pitch.
Unfortunately, sleep did not last long, and Harry found himself awake in the dead of the night with a house elf glaring down its nose at him. Said elf was not Kreacher.
"Fuck," Harry cursed, stomping over to his bed in the darkness and flopping down onto the soft mattress of it. He was well aware that the vision had been fake. Malfoy secretly harbouring major hots for him? Him, as in Harry? Impossible.
Molly startles and jumps away from the door at the loud voice that echoes over from down the hall. A door is flung open, revealing a sleep-rumpled Ginny Weasley still in her puffskein pyjama pants and muggle band t-shirt that she went to bed in. She groggily pads over barefoot, missing Molly's horrified expression but not the creaky floorboard. The rustling in the twins' room only grows more frantic at all the noise.
"Er, yes, hello," Harry stammered, and winced at himself, "Harry Potter, here to see... umm, Draco Malfoy?"
"Mmmm that was amazing, dear," mumbled a gruff voice from under the covers. Harry clenched his teeth at the man, even as the Grim laughed itself silly next to him.
There it is again, a raspy little chorus of profanities, no louder than a distorted whisper: clear signs of a rookie silencing spell. If the walls of the Burrow were any thicker, Molly wouldn't have even heard it.
Parting from his bedmate momentarily, Harry moved to whip off his shirt. He did not, however, lose eye contact with the blond for a second. Not when he was tugging Harry's cock carefully out of his trousers. Not when his eyes told him this was the only thing he'd ever wanted.
"Heavens, no!" he said earnestly, "I just saw the great oaf bust through the door just before we finished. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, baby."
"You wanna fuck me like this?" comes a different whisper, far more breathless than the first. The next bit is too soft to overhear but it's something along the lines of, 'right under the family's noses?'
the boys will definitely meet in the next chapter! please leave me a comment if you can! any feedback makes me real happy :)))) my twt is @dracominnie if you'd like to be friends!₊*̥(* ⁰̷̴͈^⁰̷̴͈)‧˚₊
The blond, seemingly unsatisfied by what he'd seen, flopped onto his overlarge bed with a frustrated huff. A pale hand (so much like the one Harry could still see fervently pumping his cock, everytime he closed his eyes) rose up to stroke at the smooth skin of Malfoy's tummy, fingers sliding languidly over the bumps and crevices created by the muscles there. His chest was flawless and unmarred by a certain collection of curse scars, to Harry's utmost relief. His nipples were rosy pink, and peaked as of now.
She slows to a halt in front of Fred and George's old shared bedroom, currently occupied by sweet little Harry and a couple dozen mysterious experimental potion stains marring the floors and walls. The twins were a right nuisance but she can't say she doesn't dearly miss having them around all the time.
Unfortunately, it was too late, because the time it had taken for Harry to come to his sudden awakening was enough for the clerk boy to finish gushing over the great Harry Potter's presence. In fact, he'd already rung Malfoy up on the Wizarding intercom, and was chirping a jolly "good morning, Mr. Malfoy!" into the magical connection.
Harry’s throat had already gone completely dry several moments ago. He gulped, and reached out a hand, loosely circling Draco's working wrist in his palm.
'Malfoy loves getting his arse fucked. Malfoy loves riding dick. He's a dickrider. And the dick he wants to ride is yours-'
To his pleasant surprise, Harry found himself touching down on sweet land after no longer than a minute. They were at a place he recognized well enough, if only by sight: an attractive apartment complex at the heart of London, just a few blocks down from Harry's own.
Malfoy looked significantly more skittish as he flipped through the journal now, fingers jittering as he flew past every page adorned with Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry. Like an amateur criminal in the act, his eyes kept darting to the door, the walls and the vast bookcase before returning to his twisted masterpiece of a picture book.
He let out a lengthy sigh, Malfoy's face, like broken crystal, still swimming at the forefront of his mind. "The Ghost of Christmas Future," he acknowledged, turning around to find himself face to face with a large black dog- not nearly as friendly-looking as Sirius had been in his animagus form. This Spirit was closer in likeness to the Grim they had learnt about all those years ago in Divination.
disgusted, but also more turned on than he'd ever been in his life. He found himself mentally agreeing to every rhetorical question that escaped Malfoy's dirty mouth.
Harry could only stare after the man, jaw dropping slowly open in confusion. He felt the beast in his chest rage and claw at the walls of the Draco-shaped hole it resided in. The loss of the blond's pliant body was doing wonders for no one, clearly.
and drops a letter on him. It's only by a small miracle that it does not end up hitting him where it hurts the most, and if you ask him, the owl that delivered it looks horribly disgruntled at having missed the opportunity.
"George... and Fred, too," he gasped, a lump rising unbidden in his throat, "this means we're in the past after all."
Sliding his hand to the back of his head, he gripped his hair as tight as he could without feeling bad about it, and thrust into Draco's mouth. Stars exploded in his vision, amplified only by the guttural moan that vibrated in the back of Draco's throat.
"Potter," Malfoy said after a moment of silence that had probably been far longer than just a moment, "do come in."
"Oh, shit," Harry groaned, unable to help himself from cupping his own dick through his sleeping pants. Malfoy's neck was long and pale, arching back elegantly to reveal his throat. His fingers flinched again as he lifted his hips up off the toy slightly before sinking back down on it with a guttural moan.
Heaving a deep breath, he swung his legs off the side of the bed and planted his feet resolutely into the softness of the rug on the floor (determinedly ignoring the telling white stain on the rug). He raised his eyes to the window through which wan sunlight filtered in.
Molly had hoped it wasn't really Harry, at the very least, but the two rapid whispers had nothing to lie for.
"Be turning your eyes over there," the spirit instructed him, and Harry considered ignoring the little menace just to spite it. Curiosity won out in the end, however, and Harry found himself looking down at two familiar heads of hair: one jet black and the other snowy white.
Malfoy's eyes are still hard, and his lip splits into another fantastically mean sneer, and he snaps, "Fine, Potter, make it quick," before strutting out of the room.
He mewled as Harry pulled out almost completely before he began to pound into his mouth. Hips snapping hard and fast, he tried his best to keep his eyes on the sight that was Draco. His hand had halted on his own dick, eyes shut as he came into it.
please leave me a comment if you can! any feedback makes me real happy :)))) my twt is @dracominnie if you'd like to be friends!₊*̥(* ⁰̷̴͈^⁰̷̴͈)‧˚₊
But Number Twelve... Number Twelve was dusty. The halls were a bit damp-smelling, they were mostly a disgruntling shade of maroon and Kreacher had not greeted him at the door again today, as per custom. But it was quiet- and none of the furniture was making subtle-unsubtle hints about marriage at twenty-one, and that was
"I know what you did that day, Malfoy," Harry allowed himself to smirk down at the other man, "I know exactly what you did in the Slytherin locker room."
!" Ron says dreamily, and Harry's stomach sinks to his feet. He's estimating the number of trays laden with baked goods he'll have to dish out to bribe Ron with until he can get his head out of his arse and hopefully put a stop to all this mad talk about frills. Then Hermione drops a second metaphorical bomb:
"Scorpius! How did you get here so fast?" he asked exaggeratedly, and bounced him in his arms causing him to giggle, "Did you fly, like Auntie Gin'? You did, didn't you!"
"Stingy as all hell, that one. Eh Potter?" Higgs shot a suggestive grin towards Harry, but deflated immediately in the face of the sour glare he was met with, "Right then."
here?!" the brunet practically squeaked, burrowing his flaming face into his palms. He was sitting cross legged now, covers bunched unpleasantly about his entire lower body.
"Fuck," he sighed when he finally reached his desired page. Demeanour relaxing almost immediately upon encountering the item, Malfoy carefully tugged out a tiny green bundle of cloth and enlarged it using his wand.
"Whossit?" Ron asked through a yawn. He was hoping it was Nott. That fucker was always just kind of quiet when they went to see him, and he even served them biscuits sometimes which were honestly better than Hermione's (not that he'd ever tell her so).
“Why’s that?” his friend asks, not looking away from her lengthy to-do list. Shite. She hadn’t overheard that bit after all. How could she, with the way Malfoy had snuck so close that his nose was nearly butting into Harry’s own?
Malfoy's future spouse hurried off to the lift. Harry vowed not to let that idiot near the blond ever again- much less to become his husband. Silently, he offered an apology to the Scorpius who would never come to be- as long as he had a say in it.
"I'm sorry if I interrupted you and your... friend earlier," Harry said, untruthfully of course, while barely managing to keep the bitterness out of his tone.
Malfoy's body gave a delicate shudder, and before Harry knew it, his towel was gone, putting gleaming ivory skin on display for the world to see. Or rather, just for Harry to see. And perhaps for the kinky spirits.
"Cor, he's here. Out! Get out! I've told you a million times already and you are starting to get on my nerves!"
Harry accepted the fact that Ginny had been annoying him lately, that he no longer found something he longed for within her. But she was a wonder in her own right, albeit, not for him.
Ginny, too, was lovely- if not for the way she'd taken to hovering around Harry at all times and talking at him like he'd die without her voice in his ears. It was always him, her and her cleavage at the Burrow these days, and he hadn't a blooming clue as to why the latter was on the list of
"That was 'Hips Don't Lie' by Shakira here on The Muggle Mixer-!" the radio blares, before it's silenced by the redhead with a flick of his wand.
"Malfoy!" the brunet cuts him off, and all of a sudden, his hands are on his shoulders and his expression is tender, "Go back upstairs, and wait for me, alright? I'll get you your blasted salad and we can talk all you want," he says softly.
Malfoy was a complete stalker. This much was clear. Sure, most of the pictures were published for everyone to see, but it didn't make it any less... strange, or- Harry squeezed his eyes shut in frustration- arousing.
A quick tempus charm told him it was still too early an hour for human wakefulness, but sleep was the last thing on Harry's mind what with Malfoy taking up all that space up there.
of other ways to find out..." Harry grumbled, but allowed himself to be, reluctantly, dragged along with the Spirit of Christmas Present through yet another terrifying unassisted flight through the city.
Albus chose not to say anything at all. Harry drank in the sight of him, the button nose he'd inherited from Ginny and the light freckles scattered across it.
. Had Malfoy overheard Ron’s jokes about him? Godric knows it’s likely, given Harry’s luck. He wonders what that comment about Lucius Malfoy was supposed to mean.
"I had to work overtime," future-Harry retorted, his tone slow and firm, as if he were speaking with one of the young children in the next room. The unspoken 'obviously' rung in the silence between his words, "being Head Auror isn't easy work."
"No!" Ron exclaims, and at Hermione's puppy eyes, swallows thickly and firmly reiterates: "Hermione. No!"
Another distressing thought was the matter of Ginny, and if this had counted as cheating. Micro-cheating, perhaps? Ginny's name fell at number seven-ish on the list of "Things that make this whole situation very fucked up": just below number six which was the fact that he had only thought of his current girlfriend after the five other things on the list. One of which was his lack of insight on Malfoy's cumming face. Or his cumming noise. Or perhaps his cumming prick. This dilemma, of course had jumped to spot number two for it had its own sub-categories.
With no small amount of effort, the blond manages to slip into one of his many silk dressing robes- not before casting another disdainful look towards his
Draco freezes mid blasting curse, lowering his wand sullenly as the radio keeps prattling on about Potter like he'd single-handedly brought blondes (the superior hair colour, really) to glory. He scowls, reclining back against his velvet headboard and stroking a hand up his cock that had been wilting rather sadly, no thanks to all the interruptions. Nothing is going to stop him from wanking this morning, especially not
Being physically present before the polished glass doors to Malfoy's apartment complex was decidedly different from floating about it in his dreams. No doubt, it was a Wizarding building, if the obvious tingle of ward-magic was anything to go by.
"Fuck, Potter, fuck me," came a throaty whisper, and Harry turned to him like whiplash just in time to catch the last few inches of the silicone cock sliding into Malfoy's hole.
Harry wanted to question the Elf again, but opted to remain silent as his ex-rival rose shakily up on his feet. What exactly was he supposed to be learning from this? Had he done Malfoy some irreparable harm on this day? Was this some sort of retribution for Malfoy's albeit unknown struggles against Harry? A guilt trip, perhaps?
Harry's jaw dropped open in shock. He scanned the room again, in a whole new light. Every child bore some resemblance to him or Ginny in colouring, he reckoned, but it was true that none could truly and surely be identified as his.
Heavens above. So Draco likes to lie down and take what's given to him. Lucius wishes he could say he's surprised but he's really not: it's reflective of his nature.
The blond hummed lightly, leaning his head against Harry’s chest. His downy-soft hair tickled his chin.
The outburst was muffled, but very audible in the silence of the manor. Harry swivelled around Malfoy to catch his expression, but he seemed to know exactly what he was doing, standing stationary in front of a door as he was.
"Good dream? Bad dream?" Ron quips, collapsing onto his roommate's bed, fully dressed in his Auror robes.
"Potter," Malfoy drawled fondly, and somewhat teasingly, and reached for the round glasses tossed haphazardly on the bed somewhere next to his ribs, "can you even see me now, without these on?"
Harry averted his eyes from the lean white body, before wondering why he had reason to do so and promptly turning back to face him.
"Yes we are, Harry!" the couple said in unison. Though while Hermione's tone was firm, Ron's was weak, and a tad long-suffering.
"-and hold onto your shaving charms! Anonymous acquaintances also reported hearing of the Chosen One's fetish for hair- downstairs!"
"You can barely see them-" says the soft whisper again, barely even a voice. She moans, "there- right there, ohhh, you've got the fattest cock i've ever seen."
However, from a parental perspective, this is most definitely something to be phased about! Especially now, after the war, that Lucius has taken a solid oath that he
"Oh, Harry, Harry, oh, I love you so much don't stop, fuck me, god yeah, fuck me harder baby, love you, love you, faster, fuck me please please please please!"
That night, Dudley hears the soft banging noises again and asks himself: sex or stealing food? He decides to be optimistic and go with the latter, and tiptoes down the stairs much like yesterday. There he is, Malfoy, peering into cupboards again, but this time, he's in a large red jersey and silky pyjama pants instead of his funeral clothes.
weird," Lucius says tightly, "And it is not the Potter spawn! Lord, Draco, where on earth do you get these irrational ideas from?"
'sexy dream'," the brunet groans and lies back down. He's still in his boxers (sleepwear, he says to outsiders, lest the Prophet catch wind of it and have a field day. God knows they wouldn't hesitate to make a front page spread titled 'High and Mighty Potter Wears Tighty Whities To Bed!') so he's technically allowed, by law, to burrow back into his wonderful, warm duvet and forget about the world. He resists the temptation, "The worst dream. A nightmare of astronomic proportions."
"Ginny, I want to marry you. Because we're twenty-one and time is running out, of course. And don't look now, but your Mum's standing behind you with a potato peeler and I think she's going to chuck it at me if I don't get down on one knee quick. Merlin, this is so stupid."
"Jesus," Harry gasped, shifting uncomfortably in hopes that his own erection would simply give up and leave. Perhaps utter a 'whoops, didn't mean to bother you at this hour, mate! See you later, then. Cheerio!' No such thing had happened, of course, much to the brunet's dismay.
"Heavens," Draco says faintly, rubbing his eyes wearily with his pointer and middle fingers, "they've gone round the bend."
interested in dating him after years of vehemently rejecting him and he said I was only a rebound fuck until his one true love came around and I had to dispose of the engagement ring I'd custom ordered for him-"
"A salad will suffice," Malfoy states haughtily, like he's placing an order at a restaurant, "without onions if you will. A glass of wine would be nice, but I doubt this Muggle pigsty of a home will have it."
," Draco quipped, and leaned forward to lick his tongue into Harry's mouth. They groaned collectively and their tongues danced together while their lips tried their best to stay in contact. A hand ran down the brunet's back and a finger tapped on his spine, twice, four times, six.
Ginny stood up with a huff and stalked out the door. Harry would have greatly preferred to stay in the kitchen with the children, but the Grim pulled him along to the entryway where Ginny stood sternly with her arms crossed.
The word echoes horribly in the vastness of the corridor, but he refuses to let himself be embarrassed of it in the privacy of his own home. What kind of monstrous child chooses a nickname for his or her parent at the wee age of one- or two if they're slow- and does not keep it up till the end of time?
After that, he pulled his robe loose and let it drop to the floor beneath him. Harry's eyes strayed over to him and stuck, like bees to a flower.
! Why else had Draco been so irreparably spoilt and starry eyed toward his beloved Father throughout his childhood following the first disappearance of the Dark Lord? The Evil Man's presence severely clouded his followers' senses of judgement and righteousness, goddamnit!)
, oh Merlin, he was still here! "but your house elves told us Auror Potter gives you rewards for being a 'very good boy', and then came the screaming, and then, well..."
"Stupid quack spirits," the brunet grumbled, removing his spectacles and slamming them down on the bedside tabletop. His aching cock made it difficult for him to lie comfortably, and although he tried his very best to ignore the damned thing, it in turn did the most to remind Harry that he had ended up never seeing how Malfoy looked when he came.
fired for looking at her a second too long. And when she'd thrown out half of Harry's sock collection when he 'forgot her birthday' while in truth he'd been planning a surprise party for her. It had taken numerous summoning and cleaning charms, as well as a hellish breakup to retrieve every last pair, and yet, they'll never be the same. You can't mess with a man's socks, period.
"And I know," Harry leaned very close, close enough to feel Malfoy's breath on his lips and the heat of his bare chest through his tee shirt, "what you're thinking about right now."
The aforementioned Plan-B that Draco has in mind, is to buy himself a brand-new array of headwear. Who said self-preservation can’t be sexy? It’s practically Slytherin’s motto, anyway.
"W- what?" Harry asked it, because this spirit was a total arsewipe, and he wouldn't put it past him to have read his thoughts only to make a scathing remark.
the possiblity that Malfoy was... you know... participating in sexual intercourse. Can you blame him? Who'd ever want to shag the ferret face?)
He did so eagerly, and the brunet loomed over him. He looked him in the eyes, currently blown wide with lust and anticipation, and spit into his mouth. Draco groaned low and loud, his lips still parted with a glob of Harry's spittle visible: sitting innocently on his tongue.
"Thanks," Harry muttered, and while his companion did not respond, he'd seen his grey eyes flicker to his face and away again before he nodded.
Floating closer to the blond, Harry studied him. Malfoy lay on the right side of his bed, while the left remained occupied by a lump that Harry had to force himself not to feel jealous of. After all, his own choices were the ones to land them in their respective situations. Future-Harry, with his loveless marriage, his all-consuming job and his absent son. Ginny, with the same lack of love, and a bitterness that had seeped into her blood itself. And Malfoy, with this-
Wails of mortification sounded from the other side of the closed door and Malfoy's face bore a tiny half smile. Harry had still been laughing from Malfoy's comment, before he realized it was definitely more literal than it had sounded.
Harry walked through the doors and into the handsomely furnished lobby, feeling awkward. The dark gleaming floors were polished to a shine, the walls were ornately decorated and there was a sizeable aquarium along the wall that housed several species of colourful magical fish.
"He is!" Mippy brightens up, "Master Draco is so good that he is saying it loudly every now and then. He is yelling, 'Oh yes! I've been a very good boy!' and Auror Harry Potter is giving him rewards--"
Faster than wind, he pulled his strings loose and slid his trousers down to his thighs- no underpants- revealing a sight much like Harry felt at present: a cock flushed red, positively bursting with blood and jutting out beautifully from a thatch of springy blond coils.
"Well," Harry furrowed his brows and scratched the back of his neck, "who was-" his eyes widened, "did she mean-"
this?" Harry gasped, turning towards the other man with betrayal spelled out clearly on his face. The blond's face lost all semblance of playfulness as he scrambled to cup his lover(?)'s face in his elegant palms.
Harry bit back a scream, squinting into the light as it slowly faded down into something more bearable.
Lucius drops his quill and leaps to his feet. There it is: the telltale sound of debauchery! Draco's bedchambers are directly above his study, and despite the thick walls and ceilings, it's not hard to hear what's going on upstairs.
Harry shivered as he stared at Malfoy's relaxed face. Wondered what had happened to leave him so hollow.
Two hands grab at the cock, one squeezing his own shaft and the other, his balls. "Potter, Potter, oh, I ca- can't take it- I need-"
Harry coughed, but Draco would not back down before anyone except for his parents. "Harry was giving me my birthday present. Weren't you, baby?"
"I know," Draco nods gravely, "I had anticipated we'd be sharing an opinion regarding this. Do not fret, Daddy, I'll draft up a polite refusal-"
Photographs upon photographs, mostly wizarding, cut out from Daily Prophet articles, Witch Weekly covers and some others from Hogwarts that he honestly couldn't recognize littered the pages of Malfoy's journal. He turned them fast, as if looking for something, or perhaps hiding a secret. But Harry had seen far too much already.
Had Malfoy gotten over his obsession with Harry? Had he, perhaps, moved on to the spouse sleeping next to him in bed.
"Can't you just-" Malfoy choked out, removing his hand from his mouth and reaching down towards his arsehole with it, "touch me, Potter? Please? Pleasepleaseplease-?"
The line of saliva on his cheek cooled as he watched Draco halt before his vanity. He seemed to analyze his reflection in the mirror for a brief moment- the flawless skin, the rosy cock that stood impossibly hard between his thighs- before his gaze flicked to meet Harry’s in the mirror.
Leaning far enough forward that the tip of his nose brushed against the smooth expanse of Draco’s back, Harry slammed into him, using all of his levity to push his way inside. Draco let out a sharp moan at his sudden entrance, and hung his head between taut arms, weak whimpers of pleasure escaping his lips.
The Muggle lights in the kitchen flickered on, bathing the room in the sort of fluorescent whiteness that you simply couldn't achieve with candles. He cringed at the crumbs on the floor that grew far more visible in the light, but was quickly rid of the emotion as the first little brown head toddled into the room.
It was a men's shirt- a rather nice one, in fact- with simple threadwork around the collar and cuffs that dressed it up significantly. Harry did not recognize it at all, but he reckoned it was something he'd like to wear, even if he couldn’t possibly imagine future-Harry wearing a shirt as nice as that.
Wizarding artwork from that time period?" Hermione says, seemingly in one breath, eyes bright and cheeks aflush.
"It's a person with no magic," is what Harry answers, at the same time as Draco says: "A horrible disgrace to the universe. So severely inferior to our Great Kind that it sickens me just to be the presence of one."
Harry kissed him again, Draco’s lips parting under his own like the petals of a blooming flower. He groaned, and ran his hands over his lover’s warm, pale body, shudders quaking the blond’s frame as he did so.
"I'm leaving! Merlin, get your knickers out of that massive twist," a deep, unknown voice responded.
"Surely this is getting a tad depressing," Draco said quickly, making a beeline for the door, "Have fun at your... colleague's."
, morning indeed, Jacobson," came the slight sound of Malfoy's rumbling voice, heavy with sleep. Shamefully, the blond's gravelly tone shot straight down to Harry's errant cock, which gave an enthusiastic twitch at the return of its new favourite person. "Good, however, it is not," Malfoy continued, "pray tell me: for what reason have you decided to rouse me at the ungodly hour of... eight?"
"Fuck, fuck fuck fuck-!" the blond gasped, backing up till his knees hit the edge of a bench, sending him sprawling atop it on his back, "You've got no- no
"Mister Harry Potter will be seeing soon," the Elf said cryptically, "he must be keeping in mind that I be the Ghost of Christmas Past."
Additionally, the blasted letter from earlier decides it's time to make itself relevant again by plopping to the ground next to the blond, who is scowling quite heavily now. The only upside to this situation is that his Wizarding radio has run out if things to say- but even that is quickly overshadowed by the pain that shoots up his spine when he tries his damnedest to sit up.
Unable to wait a second longer for his arrival, Harry decided against calling out to Draco and made to speed down the hallway himself.
This being the third time Harry had attempted to get himself off to vision-Malfoy, he had no qualms about how hard or how fast he thrusted into the tight circle of his fist. Not when Malfoy was using his free hand to rub at his knob through the silk of future-Harry's shirt.
"Star... wars?" Malfoy snaps, and the suddenness of it frightens Dudley to bits, "Your cousin- does he carry the centaur gene in his blood?"
Malfoy raised his hand languidly, and rapped on the doorframe twice. The noises stopped in the split second before Malfoy tugged the door open.
Potter raises his eyebrows like he’s been caught, something along the lines of, ‘I hope he didn’t hear that!’ written all over his face.
Bringing it close to his face with steady hands, Malfoy shut his eyes and inhaled its scent deeply. While exhaling, Harry thought he saw his delicate eyelids flutter. The blonde's body twitched almost imperceptibly, unlike his cock, which gave a hard jerk upwards at the indirect stimulation.
Grey eyes rolled back into his skull and he- Harry could not believe he was witnessing this with his own two eyes- he
A wide eyed, scandalized Molly presses her ear to the door once again urgently, ignoring the mildly concerned look her daughter shoots at her before dragging herself off to the loo.
"Merlin," the boy sobbed, "Lord, fuck, fuck me now, Potter I need your- in me I need to- I'm loose, I'm so empty, fill me up! Wanna, want you t- stuff me- full of your cock-" he was two knuckles and two fingers deep inside of himself now, back arching off the bench while his socked feet curved and his toes wriggled against the ground. They were printed with little dancing apples of different colours-
Harry did not allow himself to get his hopes up at the brief display of love and wellness in this dystopian household. Rightfully so, it seemed, because Teddy was standing at the kitchen door, the baby still in his arms and an anxious look on his face. Harry was sure his godson had had to take matters into his own hands and had sent little Rosie down to break the argument up.
Bending himself at the waist in front of the vanity, he braced himself against the edge of the low dressing-table in front of it. He stuck his arse out far enough to show off his lovely little hole, as well as a glimpse of his soft, pink sac.
Harry's on him again in seconds, slapping his hands away and replacing them with his own, fingers pumping hungrily at his cock, fondling his balls and squelching into his little puckered arsehole. Dudley groans, and he's not gay, not at all, but the reality of the scene that unfolds before him, and his already present hard on forces him to rub himself minutely against the hardness of the tree-bark again.
A pale hand rose languidly upwards to touch Malfoy's lips. He brought his tongue out and licked at his two extended fingers, then added a third, and finally stuck the threesome into the heat of his mouth.
“Seriously,” Harry wonders aloud as he and Hermione walk out of the salon that they’ve effectively left in ruins, “What the hell was that all about?” He shoots the sniggering girl a look of disdain. He runs a hand through his hair as they walk; the length of it hasn’t changed in the slightest, but he’s not all too bothered about that. What he’s really thinking about is how absolutely fucking barmy Malfoy has become. Or still is. Had he always been like this? Something about the way the blond strutted out of that store after the delivery of a bald threat regarding the color of his own pubic hair gives him a hunch that that isn’t the case.
," he hissed, reaching out to run a hand through Draco's sweat matted hair once, twice, before gripping it in a tight fist. "Suck me, Malfoy. Let me fuck your pretty mouth like I own it."
“Potter, it would do you well to stay away from my Father with that little predicament of yours,” he teased, “Who knows what could go down!” Truthfully, the advice is aimed half towards himself. Now that he’s rediscovered Father’s odd fixation on that semi-erotic painting of Potter, he wonders if he’ll see his own son as a rival in love, even if it really is a painting of the late James Potter. Father can hardly go bang the man’s grave, or he’d have done so already! Potter is really the only option left for him (and the two of them do look rather similar do they not? Draco will have to sneak into the study and check after this fiasco is over).
"Gremly has Master Draco's best interests in mind, and according to those interests, Gremly is suggesting Aurors Weasley and   Watson to leave before they see something they very much do not want to."
And alright, perhaps he'd been hoping to get another glimpse at Malfoy in the state he'd seen him just hours ago.
"Come off it Ron, please? It'll be such a fantastic way to burn old bridges and build new ones! Possibly nice ones. With lovely colour-shifting streetlights. Overlooking a gorgeous blue sea, perhaps..." Hermione sighs, euphorically, while somehow continuing to write on her parchment.
"Bollocks," is all he can say in response. Articulate speech be damned when he's naked and on the floor, in a decidedly not-kinky way.
It's not like Harry wasn't nervous. He was dead terrified of being wrong, of finding out that last night's visions had been nothing but mere dreams, or latent fantasies he hadn't even known he could have. However, Harry was a Gryffindor, and charging into difficult matters head first was basically his life motto.
, that bitter mouth open in a delicate gasp and that forked tongue darting out to lick his lips. Even more baffling is when Harry pushes his ridiculously-- sizeable!-- prick into that impossibly tiny hole in a single smooth thrust that can only indicate days and weeks and months of practice. Only then does it occur to Dudley that his cousin and this posh blond terror could have been fucking in his old bedroom all summer while he was none the wiser.
"Hey! Last time I checked, Malfoy's definitely not a woman," Harry shudders, "Scratch that. I've never checked to confirm."
Malfoy made a sudden noise in the back of his throat, and Harry's gaze jumped immediately to the cleft of his arse, now raised high in the air.
Ron knew it was going to be the worst day ever when he woke up to a significant lack of milk in the fridge.
Disappointingly, what lay before his eyes was very far from his mental image of Malfoy standing menacingly over a poor captive, brandishing his wand and dealing out
"It's actually P.W.B.B for Pretty Women Blonde n' Bitchy," Ron says at the same time as Hermione says "Petite Woven Baskets!"
"Who are you?" Dudley attempts to asks firmly, but it comes out as a weak stammer and the boy's lip curls impossibly more over pearly teeth, utter disgust betrayed by his eyes.
It was a wonder Malfoy's secret had been able to stay as one for so long, and Harry wondered how their fates would have played out if he'd figured it out back then. Perhaps they would've had more than just their awkward non-greetings at Tesco.
(Now listen carefully, because this is the part Ron will never, ever want to relive long enough to tell someone about.)
(In Harry's defense, it was now eight thirty, a far cry from the far less godly six o' clock, which was when he himself had woken up. Containing himself had proved to be increasingly difficult in the hours that followed).
"Don't be daft," the brunet deadpans, seeming far less friendly than he did a moment ago, "You know I'm not allowed."
Ron really wanted to draw some attention to himself at this point, but-- oh damn it all!-- it was too sweet! He hadn't seen Harry looking this happy in forever!
-Harry says, blunt as can be. It's Ron and Hermione's lunch break at the Ministry, and Harry's been more than happy to come visit every single day. It's the Quidditch off-season, and as much as Harry loves every moment he spends playing for Puddlemere United, he's grateful for the long, lazy mornings he spends in his flat doing nothing. And chicks. Until Vanessa, of course.
So much for having a wank this morning. Draco Jr. is so upset that he's retreated back into his foreskin, unlikely to escape its confines for at least another day. How
their fingers had to touch right then. There were no errant sparks of electricity, Harry noted, but the part of his hand that had met with Malfoy's seemed to retain the lingering ghost of his touch for several moments afterward.
Dudley shouldn't be surprised that it's Malfoy, not really, but he can't help the bewilderment that tends to overwhelm him when he sees that mean little face screwed up in pleasure and staring up at his cousin with starry eyed
"Gah!" Malfoy cries out, retracting his hand from the afforementioned curls as if they burned him. The motion, unfortunately results in him toppling over the edge of his bed and onto the floor in an extremely undignified heap of bare limbs.
A tea set appeared on the coffee table in front of them with a slight clatter that made Harry jump. He was getting really sick of things suddenly appearing out of nowhere.
He shuddered at the force of it, barely able to keep his eyes open long enough to watch the thick, seemingly endless ropes of Malfoy's cum spurt onto the lovely green shirt he had on. Never heard the way he sighed after he'd come down from his high, lonely once again without his imaginary lover. Never noticed the way the world around him swirled into darkness.
Harry had never paid rapt attention to his own eyes (for it seemed like a fickle, Malfoyish thing to do), but even to him, they seemed unusually void of life.
But after the humdrum of the engagement and the whole 'I've got a fiance(é)!' phase had worn off, it was all a flurry of tedious wedding preparations, robe fittings, ring shopping, endless planning, and Hermione's penchant for ridiculous, overambitious ideas.
"It must be the blondeness," Draco said, "Ta, Pansy. Come on," he added this bit addressing Harry as he tugged him along.
It was a frustrated sleep that took over him, but the darkness proved to be a much needed reprieve regardless.
Malfoy only raised one of his- and Harry didn't want to think of them like this, but it was true- perfect pale eyebrows, and leaned forwards in his seat.
, absolutely fucking gorgeous. I love watching you touch yourself Malfoy. Touch your cock like I'm touching it for you."
i've let it slide this time, because they technically did credit me at the end of the repost-- but it still doesn't change the fact that they never asked me if i was alright with it before doing so!
Without warning, Malfoy came. For as vocal as he was while masturbating, his climax came silently, eyes fluttering angelically, and his body shuddering and spasmimg in a beautiful sort of way. Thick white strings of cum painted his chest, as well as photo-Harry's glaring face, and it took Harry's all to keep from cumming, himself.
The remainder of his thought remained unspoken as he and the Grim floated behind Malfoy during his walk.
They really had been young, he thought, running his gaze over Malfoy's pinched face and greased back hair. His skinny shoulders jutted out awkwardly through his Slytherin jumper and his thighs were no doubt bony under his expensive trousers.
"In his free time, Young Mister Malfoy often finds himself toying with his secret journal," the spirit informed, and sure enough, Malfoy rolled over to the side of his bed to reach for a medium-sized black book.
"You know where he is," Ginny replied, her voice thick with bitterness. Future-Harry did not look surprised.
He shut the door almost all the way, and whispered at the last second, "and make sure you are using protection. Albus' mother would have my head as well as my bollocks on a pike if you turned up pregnant."
If, however, the source of the noise does end up being him... well, Dudley's awfully bored anyway. It'll be fun to chew the twerp out, despite the hour.
"Mister Harry Potter is not being seen," the spirit informed him, "He is being invisible and transparent like the dwellers of the afterlife, only for tonight."
This perversion will only end once he's dyed his hair a different colour. See if any Potters go mooning over
Harry rolled his eyes, but watched on, eagerly. Malfoy was, as he remembered, on the ground panting. A sweaty Harry had him pinned there, a final punch exploding onto the unbroken skin of Malfoy's cheek.
Harry realized he'd been hoping to have been mistaken, that perhaps it wasn't really about him. Maybe this was some other... strange Malfoy idiosyncrasy that he'd never caught wind of, and the blond simply went round tasting people's sweat on a day to day basis at random. The sound of his name on Malfoy's lips, however, drove that idea to the bin.
"You know I can see fine up close, baby," Harry countered with a suggestive leer (EW!), and winced as the blond slipped the spectacles onto his face.
Quietly, he made his way up a flight of stairs to Sirius' bedroom, or, well, what was now Harry's bedroom. The walls had been painstakingly bared of any and all half-naked women, courtesy of the Hermione, but little else had been changed.
The blond was on all fours, body angled towards the door, and he maintained agonizing eye contact with Ron, steel pupils crossing and rolling in ecstasy, but never failing to cycle back to the shell shocked redhead in the doorway.
"Merlin above, the blondes have got him wrapped around the ends of their silky pale hairs," Ron wails.
"Bet you think you're so special, don't you, Potter?" Malfoy snarled, his voice sounding oddly squeaky in his adolescence, "Lording your so called victory over the heads of your dunderheaded followers as if you haven't won it with a few cheap tricks?"
Molly sets the basket down on the floor, and the snitch printed jumper she'd given Harry last week for his seventeenth birthday winks up at her from atop it. Several years of raising seven rowdy children have sharpened her senses and she tiptoes closer to where she thinks the sound came from, making sure to avoid the creaky floorboard in front of Ginny's room.
"Yeah, I don't think you should go to Potter's wedding," Draco eyes the portrait frame again, shiftily, "or be around Potter at all, for that matter."
No, in this scenario, Draco Malfoy did have his face towards Ron, but in orgasm rather than anger or even recognition.
Molly Weasley hums to herself while she carries a yellow wicker basket full of laundry up the stairs and into the hallway.
"I believe he means P.W.B's, Harry," Hermione says fondly, and ruffles Ron's hair, "That's a Hermione Point for making inappropriate-sounding acronyms. Oh Ron, this is wonderful!"
"Merlin," Draco gasped, drawing away from him once again. Grey eyes were blown wide with lust, and they bored into Harry intensively, drinking in every detail of his face with the fervour of a man stranded in the dessert. His large, warm palms rubbed wide circles into the small of Harry's back- searching, feeling- and after a moment of that, his eyelids fluttered shut. "Merlin," he whispered again, like a prayer.
to see this; Draco Malfoy-Potter on his knees in front of him, mouth on his cock, and a hand down his own pants.
With unbelievable care, Malfoy folded the tie up and slid it back into its envelope. his throat constricted and a dull ache bloomed to life in his chest as he looked into the blond's eyes, where he found barely concealed anguish- as well as burning shame.
"No buts, Harry, you know I'm right," Ron says with an air of finality and Harry, for lack of a better thing to do, sulks back in his covers while his roommate smirks down at him like the cat that got the cream.
"What are you doing here, f-" he stops, once he's in the kitchen doorway. The figure standing before the cabinets is far too lean and too tall to be his cousin, "-reak?"
There was no time to appreciate the tasteful decor of the penthouse as the brunet tried his best to find Draco as quickly as possible. He would have called out to him, but he had a feeling he'd have to do this himself.
Once freshened up, and cured of the minor back pain that was threatening to ruin his morning even more than it already had been, Draco makes his way to his father's study.
There was him, glowering at the lens after his first night out drinking. There again, Harry found himself blinking into the flash of the camera in a sheepish manner, lips pressed close together in an awkward smile. Then there was one of those strange Hogwarts photos: taken from behind while photo-Harry scratched his head idly, unawares.
The aforementioned greeted him with a nod and said, "'S checkup day." All right, maybe this was a sign of today being a horrible one. Ron hated checking up on "ex" Death Eater bums on parole once a week, granted it was certainly satisfying to see how they had fallen from their glory, if you could even call it that.
The Grim did not speak for a long while. Just as he was starting to get impatient, Harry realized the spirit was looking at the single mismatched chair that stood empty.
the plowing was his absolute MOST disliked school rival, who hadn't even noticed his best friend standing at the door yet.
