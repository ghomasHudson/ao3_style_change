To his dismay, Potter doesn’t look at all affected by his scathing greeting. “Oh, brilliant, you’re up. Put on something warm and let’s go flying for a spell.”
to shield himself from the slow but persistent drizzle of rain falling on them. He must muck it up somehow, though, because he feels his damp shirt beginning to cling to his skin just as he and Potter are walking onto the Quidditch pitch, their brooms and Snitch in hand. Draco tries to shake off the cold and exhaustion, focusing his mind on the thought of how he can beat Potter this time.
“Oh, thank fuck.” Harry sighs ever so eloquently. “I was worried the potion might’ve done more harm than it seemed.”
As soon as they leave the castle and begin making their way to the broom shed, Draco tries to cast an

feel the throb of his prick as it spurts out drop after drop of semen, adding to the wet, sticky mess on his stomach and chest. The intense pleasure has mostly faded into the background, but the dregs of his climax still send slight jolts of electricity sizzling through his already fried nerves.
Draco makes his way back to the eighth-year wing, heat already thrumming under his skin in anticipation. It’s an opportunity he’s been waiting weeks for—where he’ll finally get to put the mysterious potion vial hidden at the bottom of his trunk to the test.
do so are two very different beasts. “I mean, I’m sure you have some great idea of how you can save me; you are the Saviour—”
Harry, fuck!” He cries.
So, he does.
With his confirmation, Potter waves a hand, and the sticky mess covering Draco’s abdomen disappears. Draco barely has a moment to be turned on by the way Potter’s magic washes over him before his legs are being pushed farther apart and a lube-slicked finger brushes against his hole. He nearly chokes at the abrupt contact, and Potter makes a low noise in the back of his throat, seemingly entranced with the view of Draco’s arse. Potter starts to press the digit inside him, his movements agonizingly slow considering how stretched Draco already is from earlier.
“Maybe it would help if you fucked me?” He forces himself to speak clearly.
Potter stammers, a wild look in his eyes that Draco doesn’t quite have the sense of mind to analyse.
Potter doesn’t say anything, so Draco, assuming that it’s up to him, manages to pull himself together enough to form words. “Potter, I need your help.” He rasps. He doesn’t even attempt his usual haughtiness, since his mini orgasms have kicked up a notch with the arrival of the other and he’s already having a particularly difficult time not outright moaning.
Harry doesn’t relent, though. “Draco, are you awake?”
not to mention dealing with the onslaught of oversensitivity that it prompts. Draco forces his eyes away from Harry’s and turns to the side, catching a glimpse of the faded Dark Mark on his left arm where it’s twisted in the sheets beside him. He would laugh at the absurdity of the situation—if he could actually even
It seems like he’s barely started, though, when he feels the familiar heat building in his groin. The pressure of his rapidly approaching orgasm takes him aback momentarily, but he pushes the thought out of his mind. His hand moves over his cock in a blur as the pressure builds, and builds, and builds, until Draco is writhing on his sheets, desperate for a release that surely should’ve already happened. He stays there, unbearably close to what he knows will be an incredible orgasm, for another excruciating moment. Finally, he feels the tight coil snap as he’s sent over the edge, and he nearly cries at the onslaught.
Draco claws at Harry’s back and shoulders—anywhere he can reach, really—and somehow manages to find his voice. “Harry, I need to
That was another unforeseen issue—how much Potter’s newly toned body affected him. All it took was that first time when Draco’s mouth had gone dry and his trousers increasingly tight. A bit of begrudging introspection later, he reluctantly concluded that his feelings had been lingering for some time and that Potter’s uncanny ability to rile him up since their first year at Hogwarts was not quite as straightforward (pun not intended) as it had seemed.

Draco grits his teeth. “Well why does it have to involve
for the other’s thick cock. And Gods, Draco
“Brilliant.” Harry breathes. “You’re alright with bottoming, then?”
“None of that.” Draco commands. “If you’re going to fuck me, then fuck me already.”
Draco forces out incredulously, his voice worryingly weak and hoarse.
do you think you’re doing?” He grits out in a hushed but unmistakably irritated tone.
“Give me a moment to change. I’ll meet you in the common room.” Draco relents, waiting until Potter slips out of the dormitory before standing and hurriedly pulling on something he deems suitable for the weather.
Malfoy. And I’m just as lost as you are!” Potter fixes him with a withering look, and Draco
“Malfoy.” Comes a whisper, a familiar voice that immediately sets Draco’s blood to boil. “Malfoy, are you awake?”
He warns.
“Not yet.” Potter says huskily before grasping the base of Draco’s cock tightly with his unoccupied hand, effectively holding off Draco’s impending climax.
Draco’s eyes nearly bulge out of his head when he turns to see Potter of all people occupying the other space at the table. He quickly summons his impassive mask, however, before addressing the intruding Gryffindor.
It’s not until nearly two weeks later that Potter finally brings up the topic of their Quidditch match. He’s continued to sit next to Draco in Potions, however, attempting to fumble through their brewing assignments, which forces Draco to teach and work with him as to not have the concoction explode and give Slughorn any more reason to be cross with the Slytherin. (And Draco is entirely sure he would get the blame, as Harry Potter can obviously do no wrong in the Professor’s eyes.)
Harry moans. “Gods,
Draco.” The sheer amount of lust with which he says his name makes the Slytherin dizzy with want.
at him—
Since he didn’t have much time until he was to return to Hogwarts, Draco made the decision to wait to use the potion. Admittedly, he had some second thoughts about it at first, as he didn’t make a habit of imbibing suspicious potions with unknown effects. The hesitation quickly passed at the promise of what the potion could bring, though, so Draco packed it carefully in the bottom of his trunk, hoping that it wouldn’t break, and began eagerly looking forward to the moment he would have his dormitory to himself long enough to try it. It was significantly more likely, now that the eighth years were assigned two students to a room, than it would’ve been in the cramped Slytherin accommodations. However, if it weren’t for his current situation, he might not have been so compelled to buy the potion in the first place. As with most things in Draco’s life, Harry bloody Potter, his
Draco almost wants to tell him no, thanks, that he’d much rather just have the other’s thick cock inside him, but he restrains himself. “Fine, then.”
Draco agrees readily, and they rush to return their brooms before making their way back to the castle.
Draco gives the other his best indignant scowl. “I’m not some kind of fragile, breakable little thing, Potter.”
As it is, Draco feels decidedly lightheaded with the intrusion of Harry’s sizable prick splitting him open.
“Don’t be dramatic; it’s not that bad. Besides, are you really scared of a little rain, Malfoy?”
“Well, you asked for my help, and…” Potter trails off, not quite meeting Draco’s eyes.
Draco shifts so that the outline of his own erection presses up against Potter’s. “The feeling is mutual.”
try. He’s always looking for an opportunity to best Harry Potter, after all.
The next morning, Draco and his prick are remarkably more than agreeable when Harry mouths at the sensitive skin of his neck and suggests they have another go.
Draco is relaxing pleasantly in his post-orgasm stupor when Harry speaks up. “I really like you, Draco.” He murmurs into the sex-scented air between them.
perfectly. A mixture of emotions churns wildly in Draco’s gut at the thought, just as they are wont to do any time Potter is involved.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been out, but Draco wakes to find Harry at his side on the bed, propped on his elbow and peering at Draco concernedly. Thankfully, Harry seems to have already vanished the evidence of their activities. Draco lets his eyes flutter shut again, humming tiredly.
and one that Draco helped facilitate, no less. He envied Potter when he had the attention of the entire school, narrowly avoiding death in every Triwizard Tournament task by sheer blind luck and stupidity. He envied Potter when he was able to happily snog Chang and the Weaselette while Draco was busy desperately vying for a modicum of his father’s approval. And, above all, he envied Potter for taking the stance he was never able to—defying the Dark Lord at every turn, an unwavering resistance even in the face of death.
His unrelenting arousal having somewhat stagnated and Draco’s body reaching a sort of acceptance of the sensation, Draco begins to feel more at ease. It’s as if he’s submerged in the sea, Harry’s thrusts the push and pull of the current, the noises he makes muffled from somewhere above the surface. But then, Harry changes the angle ever so slightly, which causes his next thrust to press right against Draco’s prostate—and Draco’s momentary peace is shattered.
Everything is too much for Draco. Wetness clings to his eyelashes and sweat plasters his hair to his forehead. He’s digging into the skin of Harry’s back so roughly he’s likely drawing blood—but Harry doesn’t seem to mind, his brow furrowed in concentration as he takes his pleasure from Draco’s body. Draco is too incoherent to do much more than whimper with every hit to his prostate, now almost numb to the overwhelming feeling and his unbearable need for release.
Draco finds himself wandering onto the Quidditch pitch one grey, late-September afternoon, however, upon request from Potter. He arrives to see the Gryffindor already in the middle of the grassy field, two brooms in hand. Potter waves him over.
his brain supplies, and the thought sends Draco hurtling even closer to the edge. He imagines Potter’s lust-darkened eyes boring into him, watching him fuck himself on his fingers, waiting for him to
“For now, let’s just say that I’m willing to help out whenever you feel the urge to take some strange ‘pleasure’ potion again.” Harry replies, running a hand over Draco’s chest.
It wasn’t nearly as small on the inside, possibly due to the use of wizard space, and Draco assumed he should’ve expected that. It was a fairly standard potions shop, too, albeit a bit dingy—which Draco thought nothing of given the shop’s location. He was just about to turn and leave, having disappointingly sated his curiosity, when a display in the back corner caught his attention. It seemed to be focused on potions of the more
There’s a brief silence before Potter speaks up. “Maybe, er…” He tries. “Maybe you need someone else to do it?”
“Did you just make me come
you can think to do?” Draco hates the needy edge in his voice as the strain of withholding his climax gets more and more unbearable. With it, he’s rapidly losing the will to not suddenly orgasm in front of Potter.
It’s barely halfway in, though, and Draco can already feel the pressure in his groin building up to another mind-shattering orgasm.
Potter hums in thought. “Because I’ll play a round of Quidditch with you if you do?”
Potter draws back momentarily, and once the spell is taken care of, he eagerly resumes his earlier ministrations. He pulls Draco’s shirt over his head, the Slytherin having spelled both of their clothes dry and bodies clean as soon as they stepped back into the castle.
spell he used to light the area. After lying awake a while longer, worrying about his decision to return to Hogwarts, he finally manages to drift off to sleep, where he’s greeted by a familiar pair of green eyes in his dreams.
He fists the sheets roughly, his hole still clenching around his fingers with every twitch and spurt of his cock. Draco wills it to stop already. It’s all too much; his body is sore and aching with the continued tension, not to mention his somehow both spent and engorged prick. He’s just about to force himself out of bed to make the mortifying trip to the hospital wing when he hears what sounds like someone trying to turn the doorknob repeatedly.
“I have friends, Potter,” Draco says with disdain – but a smile curls his lips anyway as he brings his glass to his mouth. “It just happens that most of them live abroad, now.
, I said,” she adds to shut up Ron. “I’m no saying there is no issue with him, but at least these ones are out of the way. Besides, from what I’ve seen of him lately, he does seem perfectly nice.”
Potter? Nervous? About what, a ministry inspection? Or about… Draco himself? Why would he be? They haven’t been enemies for years.
“I’ve never heard of a tattoo that can move around your body,” Draco says, putting his fingers back on it.
Suddenly, Draco feels closer to Potter than he ever did.
She looks surprised, but holds the door open for him nevertheless. “Sure.”
Some adults are gathering children to bring them back to school, others are still discussing, and Draco is apparently engaged in a pretty intense debate with Nina.
“What’s up?” he asks feverishly as he runs to Roemerta. “What’s the emergency?”
“Yes. I can still give you her card, though, if you’re done with Harry,” she smiles, twisting her hands.
“Amazing! I’ll let everyone know the service is off the charts here.”
“Let’s go through the botanical garden,” he says, inviting Draco through a small waist-high gate. “We’ve been developing it since we moved here, and it’s still quite small, but slowly growing. Both professor Sprout and Neville have helped set it up and furnishing it, and they also still donate some of their time to teach the children about magical plants. None of what we have here is dangerous in any way, of course, we can’t risk anything around kids, but it’s a good introduction to magical herbology, plus tending to it is a great activity for kids, to canalise all of their energy, and it teaches them to care about other living things.”
?” Draco repeats, sitting straighter.
Harry sighs and sits up too, searching for his glasses blindly with his hand before giving up. It’s better if he can’t really see him, probably. He pushes his hair back from his face and turns toward the window, where the shape of Hogwarts still glimmers. “Long story shorts,” he starts without turning to Draco, “Voldemort put some part of him in me when he tried to kill me when I was a baby, and if I wanted him to die completely, I had to die too. So I did. That’s all there is to it, really.”
“I know I can,” he mumbles. “It’s just… I don’t think Draco wants to be with me. He’s clearly fine with fucking, but the rest? I don’t think he’s interested.”
Draco wants to tell him they aren’t, but that’s probably the sun playing on Potter’s dark hair and proud smile influencing his brain.
“I will.”
“Harry!”
? And is he now smiling at him with pity, or something like that, in his eyes? That man is mad. He truly is.
Draco clinks his glass against his. “Cheers, Potter.”
“Stop calling me that!” This is not going at all where he wanted it to go. “And that’s not what I meant! I don’t think I’m too good for you!”
“See you all at the Three Broomsticks! Losers pay!” Ginny say as they leave.
“More important than defeating the remains of the dark arts?”
Draco feels like they’ve been climbing for hours, and he’s even afraid, with Potter’s stop at the food stand, that they’ll miss the beginning.
Harry knocks before his determination evaporate. It takes a few seconds before he hears footsteps and the door opens.
“What?” Harry answers, caught short. “What are you talking about?”
“You know what, I actually have stuff to do, so if you have questions just go to Padma or anyone else.”
“If you don’t play by the rules you won’t make it to the team at Hogwarts! Penalty for the red team.”
Potter puts down his mug and fills another one before handing it to Draco. “There’s cream and sugar over there, just help yourself with whatever you want.”
“My… what?”
Draco lowers his cup to stare at him. “You literally live a building surrounded by thousands of kids.”
“No, I didn’t go there to fight.”
Against Draco’s neck, Harry whispers in the dark: “I’m leaving tomorrow.”
Draco, relieved from the change of mood, answers:
Draco stares at him for a couple of seconds, then snorts. “I won’t say a thing, I promise.”
“Are you sure it’s not because he thinks that
Nevertheless, he’s in the entrance hall after his meeting with Padma, waiting for Harry to show up. To keep busy, he reads posters on the walls, mostly drawn by children to illustrate their numerous activities. A bunch of them are about quidditch, some show excursions to what he guesses to be Diagon Alley, others are of classrooms or other places within the institution. A couple even show Hogwarts. On a good portion of them, Draco notices a dark-haired figure with glasses, more or less crudely drawn. The drawings go back a few years, if Draco believes how some of them have faded colours, compared to the bright most recent ones.
“And you think you deserved what happened to you?” asks Draco, incredulous, before being able to stop himself.
“What, dumb versus smart?” Draco yells from next to Harry.
He takes off his shoes and sits cross legged on the bed, facing Draco, who starts raising up.
“Yes, fries would be good, thanks.”
“Well, first of all, I have eyes. Second of all, when he arrived, Debbie said he was your boyfriend, and Nina said that no, he was your nemesis, and Debbie asked if it wasn’t the same thing.” She chuckles. “That was the highlight of my day.”
A few minutes later, they’re seated at what Harry now considers their usual table, with fries and butterbeers. Harry raises his glass.
Draco stares at it for a couple of seconds. “You got me a present?”
“I’m a Hufflepuff!” one of the newest teachers, Melina, yells.
“Or,” Potter whispers, looking up at him, barely inches from his face, “There’s spare room at my place. In my bed,” he clarifies.
“Amazing. Thanks, guys. Go Harpies!”
“Where did you learn that word, Debbie?” Potter laughs as he arrives behind her.
He separates the kids into two teams, stopping their recrimination about his unfair selection with a firm tone. They are soon flying around the field, and, with a whistle blow, he releases the four balls.
“There is no evil house,” Potter concludes. “And any house you end up in will be the one that suits you the best and it will feel like your second home.”
Surprisingly, he is finding out that he actually enjoys Draco’s company. He has grown off his hatred a long time ago, but he never thought the two of them could actually become friends. And yet, he comes to enjoy the time spent with him more and more. He is smart, funny sometimes, unpredictable and yet familiar. And, in a way, hanging out with him is a bit like hanging out with kids, though for opposite reasons: when being with kids feels freeing because they have no idea who he is, being with Draco feels freeing because he knows exactly who Harry is. It is, in a sense, refreshing.
The look she gives him turns his throat dry, and he has to swallow forcefully.
“That’s the plan, yes,” Draco answers coolly while putting down his shirt sleeves. He doesn’t even want to look at Potter, afraid of what he’ll find.
“These are good seats,” Draco comments.
“I was a seeker.”
He seems a lot more insecure than he has been all evening – all day –, and that’s what makes Draco melt.
“Shoot.”
. The problem with children is, no matter what you do, they will
See, somewhere around his fourth year, Draco’s self-proclaimed hatred of Potter began to shift into some kind of hideous amalgamation of feelings that Draco still isn’t sure he could give a name to. Left unchecked, the strange, burning emotions start to devour Draco from inside out at the mere mention of Potter’s name. That, of course, is a less than desirable outcome, especially when it directly translates to Draco making an absolute fool of himself in front of the git. Mostly, he’s learned to tune out all but select feelings for Potter as mere background noise—those feelings being envy, and, well… lust.
Potter makes a startled noise in the back of his throat, and finally pulls Draco closer with a hand on his waist. That breaks any last remaining bit of resistance in Draco, and he slips his hand out of Potter’s to tangle it in the Gryffindor’s dark, rain-soaked hair. He can already feel himself growing hard in his trousers as Potter’s hand drifts farther down toward his arse and the other’s tongue begins exploring his slippery mouth. Not a moment later, something poking into his thigh lets him know that Potter is just as affected, and Draco lets out an involuntary moan.
Sighing quietly, Draco can’t bring himself to tear the diary entry out of the journal just yet. He had planned to use it for school, but he figures he can leave the page intact until he actually needs it. For now, he shoves the notebook under his pillow and extinguishes the
Thankfully spurred on by Draco’s words, Harry abruptly presses himself into Draco. “What happened to ‘
So that’s how Draco finds himself in the new eighth-year boys’ dormitory, the deliberately House-neutral beige curtains drawn around his bed, tracing his finger along the messy childish scrawl of that single diary entry exactly seven years after he wrote it. Around him, the laboured breaths of the other returning boys—mostly Gryffindors—reflect the exhausting nature of their first day back at Hogwarts, the tireless repair efforts over the summer having succeeded in allowing the school to open exactly on schedule after the war.
if Potter doesn’t stop
The first week back at school almost feels like a hallucination to Draco. He lies low, skirting large crowds in the hallways and sitting in the back of classrooms, only to find his efforts in going unnoticed subverted by none other than Potter himself. It’s truly unfathomable, the way Potter’s eyes seem to follow Draco’s every move; not to mention the fact that he always seems to be in Draco’s vicinity. It gets to the point where he half expects Potter to step into the shower behind him in the morning. (Of course, thinking about this is a mistake, because he had really hoped to avoid such a Potter-focused wank session so early in the school year.)
one, admittedly, but yes, it was an attempt.” Harry says. “I’m glad you noticed.”
let me come—” He chokes, desperate tears beginning to spill over his cheeks.
“What?” Draco repeats, his sex-addled mind still too foggy to fully comprehend what the other is trying to say.
Draco, somehow far enough past desperate to be able to revert to his typical self, bites back with,
Draco’s mind goes blank as it tears through him, just riding the line between pain and ecstasy. His toes curl and his back arches as his unoccupied hand clutches harshly at the sheets under him, his fingers aching with the white-knuckled grip. Draco’s cock twitches as he comes, and comes, and
Shakily, Draco makes a grab for his wand on the bedside table. It takes three attempts, but he finally manages to concentrate enough to vanish the sticky mix of drying and fresh come on his torso. Another two attempts and his hand is slick with lube again. This time, though, Draco ignores his pulsing cock, spreading his legs farther as he reaches around to press a finger against his hole. The ring of muscle flutters in time with his continued mini orgasms, and he begins to work the first digit inside. It goes in easily enough, but the stretch of the second finger catches him by surprise. As the feeling is intensified by the constant waves of pleasure, he can feel his orgasm building rapidly again. It’s spurred on by Draco’s digits thrusting firmly, scissoring himself open like he’s preparing his hole for someone’s cock.
Draco nearly comes out of his skin as Potter ruthlessly strokes that spot inside him, all the while withholding his orgasm and putting his weight on Draco’s hips so that he’s held firmly against the bed.
“Right. Can I…?”
Draco stands there a moment, waiting, but nothing happens. He isn’t sure what he expected—maybe something like a lust potion, a
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter says, just as Professor Slughorn taps his wand on his desk to signal the start of the class period.
“I can’t imagine you were so curious as to ignore the obvious risks of taking shady potions—”
“There must be—there must be
He actually hopes there will be a next time.
“Of course.” Harry mutters when he settles in, his arm thrown around Draco lazily. Like that, Draco has no time to contemplate the wonder and absurdity of the past few hours before sleep overtakes him.
“It wasn’t a
though he only replaces the frames on his face and doesn’t attempt to use the spell on the rest of him. Potter looks at him questioningly with his newly rain-droplet-free vision, and Draco meets his gaze as he grips the handle of his broom tighter, already feeling the sting in his frozen hands.
Draco feels like he’s coming close to having an aneurysm, which seems to be a new side-effect of being in Potter’s presence.
Summoning a bit of lube to help him along, Draco lies on his back and wraps a slick hand around his prick, taking his time as it quickly begins to harden. The action doesn’t feel any different, much to his dismay. So, he settles into his typical rhythm, his palm sliding along his shaft as he delves into the deepest recesses of his mind, conjuring up numerous unlikely scenarios where he’s having his way with Potter—bouncing on the other’s cock, or guiding the hard length between his lips, taking the Saviour apart with his mouth.
“What was that for?” Draco whispers into the suddenly much smaller space between them.
asking him for help.
He drops his gaze back to the diary entry.
He has to take a moment to find the words. “It’s like… like being in a constant state of arousal and orgasm at the same time. Not like a full-on orgasm, though, more like the feeling right at the end. But it just… doesn’t stop.”
Potter, I’ve been ready for—
Thus, Draco was there stocking up on a few supplies over the winter holidays—the halfway point of his eighth year at Hogwarts, which had been offered for the seventh years whose educations were interrupted by the war. Strolling by, he turned abruptly as he passed a potions shop that was tiny even for the cramped space of Knockturn. It looked like it could barely fit three customers, let alone the stock of ingredients and potions Draco knew to be necessary for a proper apothecary. Curiously, he pushed open the rotting, wooden door.
It has to be Potter, Draco realizes. He locked the door earlier, but that clearly doesn’t matter much to the Saviour of the Wizarding World—because the next thing Draco knows, Potter is throwing it open and stepping into the room.
Potter seems to snap out of a daze. “Oh,
Draco opens his eyes enough to give Harry a withering look. “Okay, Potter, do you really want to hear all about how I had been
nature; Draco spotted what he knew to be a few varieties of lust potions as well as a handful of vials with notes that claimed the contents to increase one’s stamina in the bedroom.
Potter swallows loudly. “How long have you—fuck, how long have you been like this?”
you’re saying?” Draco asks incredulously once he manages to process the meaning of the other’s words.
The Snitch darts right abruptly, and Draco follows the movement on autopilot. Everything else fades into the background as his eyes remain fixed on the goal, the ball flitting back and forth in his sight. Bearing down even more, Draco is so close he can practically taste the metallic tang of the shining object, even as he feels Potter hot on his heels, waiting for Draco to slip up so that he can claim it for himself. Draco won’t give him the satisfaction this time, though. The Snitch dives down low, toward the pitch, and Draco goes into a steep nosedive to keep up. At some point, as the ground grows closer and closer, he feels Potter pulling back, increasing the space between them.
“Potter?” Draco questions, not quite a sneer, but not quite a friendly inquiry, either. “What are you doing here?”
“I’d say it did enough harm, considering I can’t feel most of my body and what I
to get himself off? It doesn’t seem to work like that, though. Not yet discouraged, he strips off his uniform before crawling onto his bed. If nothing else, at least he’ll get the chance to have a nice, long, naked wank.
He does that again and again, bouncing on the other’s prick in ecstasy as it hits his prostate every time, until an incoherent string of whines and curses is spilling from Draco’s mouth with each thrust. Harry’s grip on his thighs only gets more bruising when the other begins to arch up and meet Draco’s movements, driving his cock impossibly deeper into the blond.
Draco can feel himself drifting as the intensity begins to wane bit by bit. He goes numb, his mind slowly succumbing to the relief as his body starts to relax and his thrashing subsides. Draco floats like that for the briefest of moments, in the sheer comfort of the calmness, before finally slipping out of consciousness.
Draco tries to fight to keep the smile out of his voice. “That sounds like a better option to me. But I’m afraid I won’t feel the need to come again for at least a year after this.”
I can help you, Potter. And if you need someone to kick your arse in a Seeker’s match later, I could be persuaded to lend my talents there, as well.” At that, Potter gives Draco one of his uninhibited, boyish sort of grins—something that he’s certainly never done before now. Draco determinedly does not go a little weak in the knees at the sight.
You’re basically the sole reason I was frustrated enough to take the bloody potion in the first place!” Draco growls.
Eventually, Draco manages to pry his eyes open when the pleasure fades back into the familiar, maddeningly mild pulse. Potter is gawping at his prick as it continues to twitch minutely, still achingly hard, sending shivers up Draco’s spine with every dribble of semen leaking out of the slit.
Harry’s eyes light up infuriatingly as he laughs. “Really? I guess if one of us had just said something, we could’ve been shagging since the beginning of the term, then.” At this, Draco simply groans in disbelief. It turns into a startled squeak, however, when Harry places a quick kiss on his lips.
was the cause of his problems.
Draco interrupts him, too caught up in the euphoria of his victory to insert his usual snark. “I’m fine, Potter. And look—” He holds his right hand out for the other to see what’s in it.
“Three, two, one—go!”
The Gryffindor rolls his eyes, not fazed by the other’s taunts. “Come on, Malfoy. They’re not letting the eighth years join the teams, and I
Draco’s untouched cock bobs against his stomach and his thighs burn with exertion. Finally, he feels his balls drawing up as his pleasure crests with another jab to his prostate and he comes hard, cock twitching and shooting white ropes over Harry’s stomach and chest, with a small amount even making it as far as Harry’s mouth. Riding out the aftershocks of his orgasm, Draco feels Harry thrust into him once more and still before the other’s hot, sticky release fills him, Harry gazing at the blond through lidded eyes as he comes inside him.
“Fine,
The irony of the lone entry did not elude him, however, as he stared at the thick, cream-colored page for the first time in many years. After the war, where Draco and his mother were thankfully spared the horrors of Azkaban—due to Potter’s meddling, no less—the Ministry had ordered the search and seizure of Malfoy Manor and any remaining dark or dangerous artifacts. Of course, what with the Ministry Auror force consisting of a number of witches and wizards who still regarded the remaining Malfoys as incorrigible Death Eaters, the subsequent raid of their family property was nothing less than needlessly destructive and devastating. Being left with about a third of one’s possessions was, if nothing else, certainly conducive to uncovering hidden gems of years long past. Losing more than half of the Malfoy family vaults to reparations also meant that Draco had little with which to start his dreaded eighth year at Hogwarts, so a previously unused journal was suddenly invaluable to the once-materialistic Slytherin.
Another pause, in which Draco has to force himself to focus on the conversation and not on the throb of his painfully engorged cock in his hand.
Harry fixes Draco with a lopsided grin that both unnerves him and causes something in his stomach to flutter. “Well, I was hung up on one wizard in particular—but I guess you’re right, since I didn’t actually even try and managed to have him begging for me.”
Having Potter as a roommate tested Draco’s patience in every way imaginable. Draco barely resisted the urge to hex him when he continually left his dirty clothes strewn about the room, or woke Draco up in the middle of the night as he walked loudly to the bathroom, or let Weasley sit on Draco’s bed during one of his many visits. Unfortunately for Draco, though, rooming with Potter also brought about a whole other host of unforeseen issues. Namely, the fact that Potter seemed to have developed a penchant for exposing himself to Draco. He always walked out of their attached bathroom after showers that were much too lengthy to be purely utilitarian, a lone towel slung low around his hips and bare skin still flecked with water droplets. And it wasn’t just then—Potter hardly ever wore a shirt in their room, shrugging off Draco’s hissed annoyances about his behaviour with claims of increased comfort within his personal space. Draco suspected it also had something to do with the new ripples of defined muscle and tanner-than-usual skin the other apparently acquired while helping to repair the castle over the summer. Even as winter approached and Potter’s skin faded to its typical shade, however, the git still had no qualms lounging about half-naked, driving Draco mad with want.
Draco only nods, fearing that his teeth will chatter if he attempts a verbal response. His heart pounds as Potter lets go of the Snitch, the tiny wings fluttering out of the ball and sending it high into the sky above them until they lose sight of it. They mount their brooms at the same time, and Draco finally notices Potter pointing his wand at his glasses and muttering an
His musings quickly turn to how he can attempt to stop it. As tempting as it is to give in to the pleasure, Draco has a feeling he’s been lying there for too long already, and his stomach lurches at the idea of Potter returning and finding him in such a state. To his horror, though, the movement has more to do with arousal than discomfort. Left with few options (other than going to the hospital wing, that is, which Draco firmly dismisses), he decides to try the first possible solution that comes to mind—getting himself off again.
Draco, frustratedly thinking about the reason for his suddenly increased sex drive, snatched the potion off the shelf and brought it to the counter. The haggard old wizard there barely batted an eye at Draco as he took his payment, and Draco soon stepped back out on Knockturn Alley. His pockets were a few Galleons lighter, sure, but the swell of excitement inside him at the thought of using the potion was priceless.
Despite his best efforts, something of his worry must show on his face, because Harry leans in and connects their lips, before whispering a disgustingly sappy, “Don’t worry, I’ll be gentle.”
yes.” He affirms.
It’s gentle, hesitant. Potter still holds on to Draco’s hand, but otherwise makes no move to increase their contact, as if he’s afraid he might scare the Slytherin off. Draco, still riding the high of victory and having harboured a deep desire for the other for years, reluctantly lets his eyes flutter shut. Their lips are cold, but something in Draco’s chest feels strangely warm. Not wanting to dwell on that feeling for much longer, he returns the kiss with more vigour.
the first date?” Draco sighs. “Of course, the Chosen One can’t do anything
Shutting his eyes tightly, Draco doesn’t notice anything else except the wet heat surrounding his prick until there’s suddenly a cool, slicked finger prodding against his arse. He lets his legs fall open more as Harry brushes the pad of his finger over Draco’s hole. Harry takes Draco’s cock out of his mouth, instead moving to pepper the other’s thighs with soothing kisses as he slowly works his first digit into the tight ring of muscle. Silently, Draco appreciates the gesture, clutching at the sheets below him while he struggles to acclimate to having something inside him after so long.
From the moment Harry Potter, with his wild black hair and piercing green eyes behind crooked spectacles, had entered Draco’s life, there would be no one else who could get under the blond’s skin quite as easily. The scrawny, underfed boy had somehow begun systematically unravelling every confidence and air of superiority Draco had had instilled in him with one simple refused handshake. It drove Draco mad. If his first-year self, as he lay in bed that first night at Hogwarts, seething with rage, only knew just how much more was in store for him and his feelings for Potter.
horny since the start of term, and that I hoped the potion would give some sort of boost to my unsatisfying wank sessions?” At this, Harry goes remarkably scarlet for someone who was just balls-deep in Draco’s arse.
taking in his assumingly filthy state.
In the end, Draco concedes, an unidentified fluttering in his stomach making it difficult to refuse anything Harry asks of him.
would’ve come at that if he didn’t have such a death grip on the base of his prick.
.” He whines embarrassingly.
“I know you’re not.” Harry says softly, before glancing down at the Slytherin’s chest and running a finger along what Draco realizes is one of the thin, silvery
Ignoring the uncomfortable wetness of his clothes, or the bite of cold air on his face, Draco soars upwards at Potter’s command. The both of them climb higher and higher, circling the pitch and squinting into the darkness for any sight of the Snitch. They do that for what seems like ages to Draco, until he can barely feel the wood of his broom handle under his palms and his soaked hair begins dripping water into his eyes.
“Since… around noon, I think?” Draco tries, and he hears Potter suck in a breath.
Much, much later—after Draco and Harry have their first, second, fifth date; after they spend the majority of the winter hols in bed together, during which Draco learns how it feels to be buried to the hilt inside Harry, the other writhing in pleasure beneath him; after the snow melts from the Hogwarts grounds, the students coming out of their winter stupor to prepare for end-of-the-year exams; and after Draco finally comes to terms with the newest, most prevalent emotion he feels for Harry Potter—Draco sits, alone, in his bed in the eighth year boys’ dormitory, the curtains he spelled Slytherin green once he finally got tired of the boring beige closed tightly around him. He reaches under his pillow, knowing exactly what he’ll find there, still unused since the beginning of the year.
“What?” Draco asks, dumbfounded. “You’re telling me you’ve been pent-up when you could have practically any witch or wizard you want bent over for you if you just bothered to
“Coming, yes.” Draco chokes out.
Harry Potter—only envied him. He envied Potter when he managed to set the entire Wizarding world abuzz with his name by merely starting Hogwarts. He envied Potter when he became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in history by
Draco throws his arms behind him, scrabbling at the headboard and clutching it like a lifeline as he’s sure he feels his cock about to explode, the pressure growing with every thrust, Harry having worked a third finger inside of him. Just when Draco truly thinks he’s going to be torn apart by need, his throat vaguely sore from him practically screaming at the sensations, something snaps inside him. Suddenly, a searing heat courses through his veins; white-hot pleasure mixed with more than a little pain this time. He’s probably close to breaking the headboard in two with the grip he has on it as he rides out his fourth excruciating orgasm. Draco’s eyes roll back, and his head goes a bit fuzzy, but when the haze finally clears slightly, it’s to Harry placing unexpectedly gentle kisses to Draco’s thighs and whispering unintelligible praises against his skin. He’s pulled his fingers out of Draco’s arse, but to Draco’s shock, Harry’s other hand remains firmly coiled around the base of his prick, no more than a few dribbles of liquid having seeped out of the slit.
For a second, it feels like what Draco imagined burning alive would’ve felt like, back then in the Room of Requirement with the Fiendfyre hot against his skin, when he was certain that was how he was going to die. When the initial pain fades, however, it’s completely different. It’s like every orgasm Harry withheld from Draco multiplied by double, overwhelming every one of his senses and paralyzing him in ecstasy. He vaguely acknowledges Harry’s hand still moving along his prick, milking him as he twitches and comes and holding him down with the other hand as Draco unconsciously writhes against the sheets. Draco can’t force his eyes open or his head to move from its position thrown back on the pillow to confirm, but he feels each rope of hot ejaculate as it hits his stomach and chest and pools in his navel. His entire torso is warm and sticky with it, coated even as more and more spurts from his cock with every continued wave of his climax.
Even though the eighth years were given much more lenient permissions and curfews regarding roaming the castle or going to the nearby Hogsmeade, Draco and Potter make sure to keep to the shadows when going outside, as they still think Filch more than capable of making a fuss if he finds them.
Another shrug from the ever-so-eloquent Boy Who Lived.
“Enough, I’m ready.” Draco rasps when he doesn’t think he can take it anymore.
Harry doesn’t have to be told twice, it seems. Draco hears him mumble something and suddenly Harry’s clothes vanish from his body, leaving him gloriously bare, every inch of tantalizing golden skin on display as he kneels between Draco’s legs, one hand still fisting the base of Draco’s shaft. Draco’s gaze drifts to Harry’s crotch, where his cock hangs, full and heavy with the evidence of his arousal. A flare of heat spikes in him, and once again, Draco thinks that he would probably come just at the sight if not for Harry restricting him.
“Are you insane?” Draco asks incredulously. “Not only is it the middle of the night, it’s bloody
Once they both begin to catch their breath, Draco looks up from his position slumped against the other’s chest to see Harry flicking his tongue out and licking the glob of Draco’s come off of his lower lip. The sight sends a muted jolt of arousal through him, and he inadvertently clenches his arsehole at the feeling, which causes both he and Harry to gasp at the overstimulation. With shaking legs, Draco manages to raise himself off of Harry’s softened prick, and he doesn’t miss the way Harry’s eyes snap to the space between his legs when the excess come begins trickling out of him. The Slytherin flops down in the minimal space beside Harry for the time being, at least until he can gather the strength to return to his own bed.
Then, Potter begins thrusting his finger in and out of Draco’s arse in earnest, soon adding a second. When Potter brushes against his prostate, Draco arches his back and curses, but Potter
Over the summer, Draco found himself having to reluctantly frequent Knockturn Alley, the dodgy row of establishments adjacent to the much more palatable wizarding shopping district of Diagon Alley. He didn’t like it, having had more than a taste of the damp, musty shops there during trips with his father when he was younger. Unfortunately, though, he didn’t have a choice, since he was no longer welcome in the more respectable areas of wizarding society, being an ex-Death Eater and all.
is. It doesn’t seem like it’s about to stop any time soon, either. The amount of fluid on his stomach is truly obscene, and Draco wonders how the hell he'd managed to produce that much semen.
Draco is lying on his back, staring up at the dark, shadowed roof of the four-poster canopy bed above him. Like this, he can’t help but think back to the innumerable times he’s been in the same position in the Slytherin dormitory, unable to fall asleep as he replayed the day’s interaction with Potter, or otherwise hatched some kind of plot against the Gryffindor. He’s so lost in thought that he nearly jumps out of his skin when he hears a shuffling noise on the other side of the curtain, beside his bed.
From here, Draco can distinguish the loud snores and mumbling from Weasley to his right, and the restless fidgeting from Longbottom to his left, but no matter how hard he strains his ears he can’t make out any noises coming from Potter’s bed directly across from him. Trust the Boy Who Lived to even
“Yes, well—now, if you don’t mind, I’d really like to get started on my week of sleep that I mentioned earlier.” As he is rather exhausted, Draco doesn’t have the energy to protest even if he wanted to when Harry simply pulls the sheets over both of their bodies and presses closer to Draco.
The expected post-climactic bliss does not happen. He can feel his cock pulsing steadily in his palm, and he pries his eyes open with a not-insignificant amount of difficulty. Draco’s cock rests, still flushed and erect, against his stomach, in a veritable
He laments. The conversation is making him feel some of those more repressed Potter-centric emotions, and he’s not quite sure how to deal with the onslaught.
In fact, Draco can’t think at all, what with his body heating uncomfortably under the other’s gaze. He shudders against the tightening feeling in his stomach.
About an hour later, the two have worked up quite the sweat, chasing after a particularly evasive Snitch. Draco, elated to finally be on a broom again, may have to admit that he’s not paying as much attention as he should be to the object of the game, but rather his opponent. Still, he
you’re still—” Potter breathes.
Harry simply grins back at him. “I’m glad you understand. Now, do you want to come to Hogsmeade with me?”
“Draco? Draco!”
Harry continues, starting to press chaste kisses into any part of Draco’s skin he can reach. “And because making you genuinely smile, even if it means losing to you at Quidditch, gives me a kind of euphoric feeling that nothing else does.” Finally, he leans up to place a tender kiss to Draco’s lips. “And you look especially gorgeous bouncing on my cock.”
“It said it ‘gives the drinker immense pleasure,’ so I was curious.” Draco answers partially.
“Ready?” Harry asks, ever the considerate boy-hero.
ago!”
Harry groans above him, but it sounds far away to Draco’s ears.
It’s not too much longer, though, until the burn eases and Harry is able to add another finger alongside the first. Eventually, Draco squirms below him as the Gryffindor scissors and thrusts two digits in and out of his tight hole, preparing him for his cock. Speaking of, Draco’s cock is painfully hard now, the member an angry red and leaking shiny beads of precome onto his stomach. Harry isn’t in much better shape, from what he can tell, the raven-haired wizard’s lip caught firmly between his teeth as he looks hungrily at Draco.
And maybe he was a little bit interested. It had been a while since he was able to talk to someone who didn’t look at him like just being in his presence was akin to being Cruciated, let alone have any kind of sexual partner. Not to mention that with his return to Hogwarts, his libido seemed to have doubled, so quick wanks in the shower just weren’t as satisfying anymore.
“Listen, Potter.” Draco pants, ignoring the other’s focus on his hand around his cock. “I took a shady potion from a shop in Knockturn, and now I can’t stop coming, and I need your help.”
Draco levels out at the last minute, every step in time with the fluttering, golden ball. As the Snitch makes a beeline for the far side of the pitch, Draco draws close enough to reach a hand out, desperately grasping for the shining object, his fingertips barely brushing the surface. All rational thought having been dismissed in the pursuit of finally besting Harry Potter at Quidditch, Draco has the wild idea to make a jump for it.
He growls, before regaining his composure. “Er… maybe. But wait—I might have something we can try first.”
“Well, what have you tried so far?”
Someone’s cock—
Potter sighs quietly and extends his hand toward Draco with the faintest quirk of his lips. “It seems you did, Draco.”
He knows he probably looks like a fool right now, covered in mud and grinning from ear to ear, but he can’t bring himself to care.
please,
“Shame.” Harry says, grinning, but his eyes darken with a hint of challenge. Draco swallows loudly.
Of course. It’s not enough for Potter to annoy him during regular waking hours; now he has to do it in the middle of the night, as well. Draco rips open the curtain and fixes the boy on the other side with the deathliest glare he can muster at such a late hour.
The word feels foreign on Draco’s tongue, but he can’t say he minds too much in the moment.
Draco thinks sourly, reflecting on how the connotation of the phrase has changed and evolved during his time at Hogwarts.
Starting at Draco’s jaw, Potter mouths along the long expanse of his neck and down to his clavicle. “You should call me Harry.” He mumbles into the other’s skin.
“You wish, Potter.” Draco taunts, nonetheless.
Potter comes barrelling down out of the sky a moment later, landing with a thud next to where Draco is still lying, beaming triumphantly.
He feels the cool wash of a cleaning spell not a moment later, the Gryffindor once again making Draco’s head fuzzy with his easy use of wandless and wordless magic. The spell leaves Draco’s skin prickled with gooseflesh, until Harry’s hand comes to rest atop the blond’s chest, soothing him.
of semen. He watches as it twitches rhythmically, the tip fluttering and dribbling even more come, each pulse accompanied by a mild surge of heat and pleasure. He feels like he’s floating, still not having come down from the high of his release. Draco, resolving to enjoy the sensation as it’s presented to him, lies there for another brief moment, his hand working lazily over his shaft as he lets himself get lost in the feeling.
“You can.” Harry responds in a tone that somehow soothes Draco and simultaneously ratchets his arousal up to impossible levels.
“Okay, erm… I can take you to Madam Pomfrey, I guess?”
Deep-seated envy was one thing, but it was Draco’s fourth-year discovery of his sexuality that began the slow descent into madness that was lusting after the Boy Who Lived. Sometimes, there are difficult things to accept about oneself, and for Draco, it’s his unwavering desire to fuck Harry Potter—or be fucked by him. The Slytherin has come to the point where he wouldn’t object to either scenario. Make no mistake; Draco’s desires go absolutely no further than begrudgingly admitting the git is attractive and worthy of a good shag.
Soon, Harry’s thrusts grow more erratic, and he begins panting heavily on top of Draco.
he skips some space, and writes:
Not a moment later, Harry buries himself deep inside Draco and stills with a broken groan before Draco feels the first twitch and spurt of Harry’s cock in his hole. Almost as an afterthought, the pressure of Harry’s fist closed around Draco’s cock lifts, and suddenly Draco is thrown into the blinding intensity of his own orgasm.
“Fucking hell, Harry.” Draco chokes as he feels himself hit the back of the other’s throat, who moans in response.
Potter is breathing rather heavily now as he drags his gaze over Draco’s body, and if Draco isn’t mistaken, he’s pretty sure he spots the outline of an erection in the other’s trousers. That alone strips away the last of Draco’s remaining sanity, giving him the wild idea to ask for something he’s wanted for a long time.
Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he notices Potter make for the treeline on the far side of the pitch. He bares down, racing toward the Gryffindor, but it’s no use, really; Potter has the Snitch in his hand before Draco can even get halfway to him.
“How far do you want to take this?” Pott—
“Potter, what the
Draco nearly sobs, his vision starting to go white around the edges as Harry peers back at him, drinking him in, those striking green eyes almost black with arousal.
The Slytherin takes the other’s hand, mind reeling with the combined excitement of his win and the shock of his given name coming out of Potter’s mouth. The Gryffindor pulls him up, and the next thing he knows, he’s suddenly much too close to Potter, so much so that he can almost make out the individual flecks of green and brown in the other’s eyes. They freeze like that for a moment, until the only warning he gets is a barely-there flick of a gaze down to Draco’s lips before Potter is kissing him.
Draco is nearly vibrating with the heady excitement of what he’s about to do as he pushes open the door to Potter and his shared dormitory. He learned earlier that his roommate would be out until sometime that evening, as he and his clan of Gryffindors were taking advantage of the free day and making the trip to Hogsmeade. Thus, having the room to himself gives Draco the perfect opportunity to try the potion. He absentmindedly sends a locking spell at the door before striding over to his elegant school trunk, rummaging around for the glass vial. It’s right where he left it, and Draco doesn’t hesitate to take it out, uncork it, and tip the contents into his mouth. He knows time is of the essence; he may have a considerable amount of time, but he doesn’t have forever.
"I have a headache," Draco admitted. "It's quite awful." He clutched at his head for emphasis.
So this was a very important man. It would be in Draco's best interest not to piss him off, but since when did he do things that were in his best interest? "To be perfectly frank, I have never met you in my life. What is your name?"
Blaise shrugged. "The same. Including the shopping." He smirked. "Need to look good for a certain Gryffindor." Pansy examined her nails. Then she turned to Draco with a positively Slytherin grin. "What about you, Draco? You look absolutely delicious. Is that also for a certain Gryffindor?"
"You want to know something else?" Draco leaned in to whisper to the bird conspiratorially. "I don't like magic anymore. I wish I were a muggle, sometimes." He straighted, suddenly realizing that everything was a million times harder while inebriated. He was even seeing things, now. The bird's eyes were glowing brighter than before, almost like the sun shining through amber rather than candlelight. Maybe it was time to stop with the drinks.
Only a few people raised their hands. Draco held his breath.
Harry proved to be very inattentive when Draco was concerned. He only just managed to catch the Snitch a few times, but not enough to be ahead of Draco. He couldn't help but watch as Draco flew effortlessly, eyes shining brightly with delight. He pulled himself out of his stupor, and flew around, determined to get the Snitch this time. He saw it, a glimmer of gold near the forest, and turned, speeding off after it. Draco was close behind him.
Harry was watching Malfoy. When their eyes met, Malfoy raised his eyebrow, so Harry smirked at him. He wanted Malfoy to know Harry was onto him. Harry was delighted when Malfoy looked pained. Suddenly, the main courses disappeared, and the usual desserts took their places. Harry was promptly distracted by the treacle tarts.
"I don't want McGonagall to know," Draco said shortly. Harry cocked his head to the side. "Why not? It would be easier and safer. Not to mention legal."
"How are my favorite godchildren?" Harry asked after a pause.
"Don't be boring," Draco chided him from across the chessboard, where he was playing a rather spectacular match against Ron. Harry reminded himself to thank his best mate for making an effort. Harry raised his head just enough to glare at the smug Slytherin.
Draco stood absolutely still. He didn't want to move, in case it broke this fragile moment that he wasn't quite sure was real. "What?" he asked, speaking slowly.
"I'm not going to explode!" Harry erupted. The twins smirked. "Too late!" They chorused. Harry just scowled more. Then he gestured vaguely to the front of the shop, saying, "Would you please take that down? I don't much want even more people after me to offer their gratitude. And really, cheeses? If you were going to put me in a rhyme, you could have done so much better." He shook his head in mock disappointment.
"Good," he replied. "Because you shouldn't. There's absolutely nothing for you to doubt."
His to love.
Harry just gaped at him.
Harry looked suitably uncomfortable, so Draco went on. "This way, she has no proof we're sleeping together at the moment, but if she tries to confront you, she'll have to come find us and deal with me too."
Still frowning, Draco made his way to the kitchen for a cup of tea. This was far too much excitement for one morning, especially when he had drunk his way through half of his good wine the night before. He finished making the tea, and the bird from last night spontaneously popped into his head. Draco scowled. Just see if he would ever be nice to a bird again! Sighing, he removed his shirt, grimacing at the ruined material, and looked down at his new wound. Or, where his wound would have been had it not disappeared.
Now Draco understood what this was all about. "I'll never stop needing you, Pans. Sure I've always wanted to go out with Harry, but you've been my best friend since we were children. You're far more important. Who else will call me out on my bullshit? Who else will go shopping with me? Surely not Harry, not with his fashion sense. I do need you, Pans. Always," Draco assured her.
When he opened the door again, he was relieved to see that Malfoy's curtains were shut. He walked over to his own bed and clambered in, closing the curtains and rolling over, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape. Sleep followed quickly, thank Merlin.
Draco fortified his mental barriers, adopting a cold, indifferent mask to avoid revealing emotion. Once he got through this encounter with Lucius, he could feasibly escape to figure out what the hell was going on.
"I'm sure you found a way to cope with my absence," Draco said with amusement.
Draco smirked. "I guess you'll just have to wait and see. I mean, you've already seen me shirtless, but you must not have been paying attention."
"I only meant...I mean....you look friendlier when you smile. Last night you were smiling a lot. You looked happy. Carefree." Potter mumbled.
Draco deliberately yawned and let loose a small jet of fire. The woman gasped, and her daughter laughed with delight. He looked straight at the pair nonchalantly, then ambled over to a corner as if he cared as much about them as a hippogriff cares about a human. He stretched and curled up like a cat, silently congratulating himself on being such a skilled actor.
"Wait, Harry. I'm sorry, it's really none of my business, especially if I'm not involved, as you seem so eager to make clear." He looked slightly amused. "I suppose it's fine, then. Avoid me all you like, until you've sorted yourself out. I won't lie and say I'm entirely fine with it, because as your friend, I'm not. But if this is what you need, then I'm willing to wait." Draco finished gently, smiling at Harry in a way that was entirely unfair because of how much it made him want to hug the other boy.
Pansy grinned at him. "We were talking about having a party. Possibly even with the other houses. I was asking if you thought it was a good plan, but obviously, you're too infatuated with Potter to listen to us plain, old Slytherins. I mean, I get we didn't save the world or anything, but-" Draco interrupted her.
"It was never haunted," he informed the blond, much to his surprise if the small noise he made was any indication. Harry finally turned to face him. "It was Lupin the entire time. He would come here to transform during the full moons." Harry smiled softly. "My dad and godfather would keep him company and restrain him when needed. They came through a tunnel underneath the Whomping Willow; Wormtail was always the one to deactivate the tree. They spent hours with Lupin every month..." he trailed off into silence.
When they finally reached the common room, Ron and Hermione hung back, letting them advance to their dorm alone. They made eye contact once more, sharing a strange tension before Harry opened the door, stopping short just inside.
Pansy and Blaise had asked what Potter had wanted as soon as Draco exited the room, much to his chagrin. He hadn't told them about his attackers, and he had hoped he wouldn't have to. But he didn't see any way of getting out of it without lying, so he reluctantly told them about the events that had taken place before class. Pansy and Blaise were appropriately outraged.
Wilson nodded. "Remember," he said, addressing all of them. "We're not going in with the intent to harm. The kidnapper has not hurt anyone, as far as we know. Be alert, but aim to incapacitate, not main or kill. Wait for my signal to move in," he instructed.
They had arrived just in time, too, because the mail owls suddenly swarmed into the Great Hall. Usually, Draco watched in amusement as owl after owl tried to drop a letter onto Harry, only to have the envelopes disappear when they got within five feet of him. Flitwick had wrought a tricky charm to repel all mail that came from an unknown sender, and Draco loved to watch the owl's helpless antics and their outraged shrieks when they realized their jobs weren't complete. Today, he was so busy watching that he almost didn't notice the letter that dropped in front of him.
"What are you confused about?" Her tone was gentle, and she wasn't pushy like Hermione might have been. Harry bit his lip in indecision. "I... I had a dream a few nights ago. About...a guy. And, well, I don't know...I'm not sure how to feel about it."
"Well? I don't have all bloody day!" Draco finally snapped at him. Potter seemed to come back to himself then and reached into his pocket, pulling out his wand. He handed it to him and finally spoke. "Here. I couldn't have killed him without it, so you have my thanks." Draco looked at him with confusion in his face before looking down at Potter's wand. His eyes widened. "This is my wand," he said in wonder, before slowly reaching out to take it. Potter looked sheepish. "Yeah. Sorry about that. My wand...broke. And anyway, I wouldn't have been able to defeat Voldemort with my old wand. So thank you for letting me use it. It was strangely...compliant." Draco chose to ignore that last comment and focused on what he had said before that. "I didn't 'let' you use it. You stole it, you twat. And what do you mean your wand wouldn't have worked? You always fought him with it before, and it seemed to work out well enough for you." Potter's eyes became unfocused like he was remembering something. "Yes, I did. But he was never able to kill me with his wand, so naturally, I couldn't have done the same with mine." Draco was positive he was hiding something. "But why...never mind, I don't need to know. What I do need to know, Potter, is why you have delayed me from getting back to the Manor, where I can spend my last few free hours with my family without a psychotic monster breathing down our necks." Draco drawled.
Should he add that they had intended to tell her? Harry didn't want to come off as mannerless or make her think that they didn't value her opinion, because he really did. It may seem irrational to wish for the validation of the wife of Lucius and the sister of Bellatrix, but she was also the cousin of his godfather, the great-aunt of his beloved godson, and the mother of the man he loved. She was an important figure in his life merely through association, but Narcissa was interwoven throughout his most valued relationships in a way that only pureblood inbreeding could achieve. Harry needed her to be on good terms with him if only because it would affect too many people that were dear to him if they were not friendly.
Harry stared at him, uncomprehending. Was something wrong? Why wasn't Draco kissing him anymore? Oh god, had he misinterpreted every interaction with him ever? How could he possibly misinterpret a kiss? Or Draco's blatant arousal at their last intimate encounter? Maybe Draco thought he was a blushing virgin and didn't want to deal with that. Or maybe he really was an awful kisser, and that's why Cho broke up with him, and why Ginny suddenly found that she was a lesbian-
"You have a pensieve?" Harry asked with disbelief.
On the other side of Malfoy, Zabini scooted closer to him. Malfoy moved to give him more space, causing his arm to press against Harry's. Little shocks of electricity went up and down his arm, and he jumped. "Sorry," muttered Malfoy. Seriously, what was with all the Slytherins recently?
A moment later, Draco chimed in on the argument, and Harry turned to see that he looked alert now. He smiled a bit regretfully but kissed his boyfriend's cheek one more time as a sort of welcome back to the land of the living.
Half an hour of practice yielded little but an abundance of bruises. Draco had finally learned how to take off without falling or losing his balance, but then, he usually panicked and tumbled to the ground. At least he got plenty of practice landing.
When Harry pulled off the cloak, Draco rolled his eyes and adjusted his gaze. "I could ask the same of you," Harry pointed out. "I couldn't sleep, and I saw you on the map, so I decided to come here." He didn't say why he couldn't sleep, but Draco had always been smart.
He fell flat on his snout. The reindeer, who had been watching him, let out a snorting noise that Draco eventually recognized as a laugh. Draco the dragon glared at the reindeer and let out a threatening puff of smoke. The reindeer snorted harder. Then, all too soon, the reindeer shimmered and turned back into Potter. The now less strange feeling crawled over Draco's scales, and he blinked once more to find himself at his normal height. Potter was still laughing at him. Draco glared and smacked his arm.
The question might have sounded rude if it were anyone else. But, Harry knew Draco had lost people too, knew that he understood how impossible it was to mention the deceased. Harry smiled comfortingly.
Harry pulled Ginny into his arms, burying his face into her fiery hair. He squeezed her for a second, then let her go. She smiled at him. Then, with his arm still around her waist, he guided her over to talk to their friends.
"You always win," Draco complained grumpily. "Even I can't resist your charms." Harry let out a startled laugh. "What do you mean by that?" He asked, genuinely confused.
"I think I'm confused." He said finally.
Suddenly, without warning, Draco thrust his hips forward into Harry's, giving him a very clear sign of just how aroused he was. Harry broke the kiss, surprised. Draco's lips were swollen, his eyes hooded with lust. It should be illegal to look that desirable, Harry thought before he pulled away. Draco looked confused.
Only a few pairs, including Parkinson and Hermione, were able to finish. Snape sneered at them all. "Many of you were not able to finish. You will be receiving zeroes for this assignment." There was a collective groan from those who had not completed it. "Silence! No doubt, most of the potions that were completed shall be utterly useless. Let us test them now." Snape gave samples of random potions to each group. Draco and Potter simultaneously sighed in relief when they saw theirs was labeled "Granger-Parkinson." They had a silent argument about who should try it, which consisted of a lot of discreet gestures, some of which were quite rude. That was put to a stop when Snape informed them that both partners were meant to try the potion.
Pansy seemed slightly mollified by that. Draco knew the perfect way to cheer her up. "You won't believe what happened last night." He said in a low voice, sliding closer to confide in her. Pansy gave him a look that very clearly told him if he didn't continue, she would murder him painfully. "I was in the forest," Draco began, "doing my, um, project." Pansy nodded, she disapproved but was aware of his nighttime adventures. "And I hear a noise, and then breathing, so naturally, I guessed it was Harry." Pansy rolled her eyes. "Naturally," she muttered underneath her breath.
Perhaps a bit of meditation might help?
"Go on," she said. "It's better if I send you myself instead of finding out a couple of hours later that you broke into the Ministry."
"Malfoy," he greeted back. He wondered why Zabini had shoved Malfoy towards him. Perhaps Zabini didn't want to sit next to Harry and volunteered Malfoy so he would have to instead? Parkinson interrupted his musings. "I'll get the butterbeers. I'll buy you Gryffindors a second round as an apology for butting in." She sauntered off before any of them could protest. Harry really wanted to know when the Slytherins had become so polite. Granted, they all generally had good manners, but they never bothered before when it came to him.
"Not so tough now, huh Malfoy? Your Death Eater pals aren't here anymore to back you up, isn't that right? You were sleeping in your comfortable room, while we were stuck being tortured in the dungeons! You even took part in it, you piece of nasty filth! How dare you come back here and show your face around those you helped to harm? You deserve every single thing we are about to do to you. And-" the younger student leaned down to whisper dangerously in Malfoy's ear, though his voice carried enough that Harry was still able to hear. "What's more is that you think you deserve it too. You know that whatever we do to you will never be enough." And with that, he signaled the others to begin their assault. They took turns hexing Malfoy, jeering and shouting insults all the while. Malfoy couldn't move, still under the effects of the first Petrificus Totalus.
A little bird flew up to him, perching on the railing he was sagged against, the night breeze ruffling his hair and its plain brown feathers. His drink was caught in a dangerously loose grip, threatening to shatter on the ground two stories down at any moment. The bird canted its head, staring at him with an unimpressed glare.
Draco sighed but didn't answer. He would be damned if Harry could get that information out of him that easily. The black-haired boy scooted closer, unperturbed.
With that in mind, Harry made an addendum.
"Good," Hermione approved. "After that, maybe you can research animagi more in-depth? Draco may have trouble coming out of his form if that is what happened to him. I have some books that could help," she ventured.
Yup, that's it! End, fin, finite incantantum and all that. Definitely don't scroll down because there's nothing more to see here.
Pansy didn't even look up from her food when Draco sat down. "Where's Blaise?" He asked, reaching for a roll of bread. "I don't know," Pansy responded. "Where were you?" She sounded miffed. "Owlry," Draco told her, pouring himself a cup of pumpkin juice.
"I want to be with you," Draco said firmly. "Now, should I tell Mother, or would you rather wait?" He asked as if he didn't particularly care either way. Harry thought for a second.
Exhausted, Harry swayed in place, barely feeling the arms keeping him upright. His vision swam and clouded with darkness, and then he was gone too.
Draco turned back to his mother. The look she gave him was so understanding and kind that he began to wonder what kind of expression his own face was pulling.
Harry wondered when the students of Hogwarts had grown up and moved on from the battle, when they had decided to stop their petty acts of misguided revenge, and when they had chosen to forgive instead of breeding hate.
Potter looked a bit taken aback by that comment. Then he looked at him with a calculating gaze. "You might not get sentenced to Azkaban, Malfoy. Your father might not be able to worm his way out of punishment, but you and your mother...you could probably come up with a defense good enough to keep you out of prison. Isn't that what Malfoys are good at?" Draco blinked, and then he was furious. "Of course you would think that, Oh Mighty Savior, but the rest of the world doesn't think so! They'll want to see us pay, and they won't settle for anything less than a life sentence. And I didn't expect you of all people to start defending Death Eaters when they have killed everyone you've ever loved, including your worthless parents and your good-for-nothing, reckless godfather." He sneered at him. "But I shouldn't be surprised. The Boy Who Won't Die has a hero complex, of course, and you are bloody addicted to it! Well, I don't want you to save me, and neither does my mother for that matter. And besides," he said, losing steam and dropping his eyes to the ground, his voice lowering to a whisper. "It's not as if we don't deserve it." Draco was horrified to find that his eyes were prickling, and he furiously blinked to stop them from leaking.
Draco closed his eyes. He imagined packing all his wayward thoughts into discrete boxes, either shelving them into his mental library or throwing them in the rubbish to be forever forgotten. The metaphorical pile of boxes grew smaller as he methodically worked inside his mind until his brain was as empty as possible. The occasional thought still drifted across, but instead of fighting it, Draco acknowledged it, then put it into a new box.
Harry shrugged. "My dad and his friends seemed like they were pretty powerful when given the right incentive. They became animagi during school, too, so they could keep Remus company and help him when he transformed. They just never bothered to put their talent towards their studies. Except for Remus."
"Did something happen between you two, Draco? While you were all alone together in your dorm, no one around to stop you..." she trailed off suggestively. Draco spluttered. "Of course not, we didn't do anything of the sort!" She raised an eyebrow sardonically. "So you spent hours doing absolutely nothing? Don't lie, Draco, it's boring."
“And I have found out that I live a better life if I keep a distance with people. It works better for me. If I don’t let people in, they can’t hurt me. Except… you always had a spectacular talent when it came to getting under my skin.”
“I’m not complaining,” Draco mumbles, the nose in his mug.
“Hey,” he says softly. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you up. You can get back to sleep, I’ve got some things to do but I’ll come back up with breakfast.”
Draco shrugs. “It just feels like you’re turning into a real sorting hat.”
Harry turns a sad smile towards him. “Well, it was a different time, wasn’t it? Also, I was a competitive Gryffindor who wanted to beat you in quidditch,” he finishes on a lighter tone.
“I’m not judging! I’m just… we’re talking about Draco
“It’s alright, you don’t owe me any explanation.” Of course he would say that.
Harry shrugs, feeling suddenly stupid, and diverts his eyes. “I didn’t think people would care about what I did if it didn’t involve killing Voldemort or defeating the dark arts. I know,” he adds as he turns back toward Draco, “that some people were disappointed that this was what I chose to do. They thought I should be defeating evil or get involved in politics or whatever.
“You should come more often,” he says without thinking.
“For fuck’s sake,” she sighs.
“That doesn’t explain where you’ve been sleeping,” Hermione says as Ron give her her own plate.
“What, claiming her for your team already?”
Draco slumped on the ground in defeat, wings drooping and his snout nearly touching the floor. His latest fall had only convinced him he was getting nowhere - he had landed flat on his face just like his first attempt with Harry. Recalling the reindeer's braying snort-like laughter, Draco allowed himself a reptilian smile. Harry had always made him smile, even if he had to conceal it at first.
"We thought it went with the mouldy theme," one of them explained.
————————————————————————
"Don't worry about it. You fixed it already. No need to dwell on problems of the past," Draco said, just a touch too fast.
Harry shook his head, frantically. No way was he telling Malfoy- Draco- that they had almost kissed. His eyes dropped to Draco's lips unconsciously, and he was incredibly grateful that he was not currently looking at him. Draco turned to glare at him. "You are infuriating. You know-" and here Draco smirked, causing Harry to gulp, "I have a whole list of things to ask you about. You know, the blushing, more blushing, avoiding answering me when I ask about the blushing...why did you blush Harry?" Draco asked pointedly.
Draco scanned the trees and stepped forward when he found the one with the convoluted knot in the bark. He approached it and groped around inside the tree for the book he knew rested inside. His fingers brushed leather, then he hauled the heavy tome out and nearly dropped it on his foot. Cursing, he lay it gently on the ground and flipped the pages until he found the right one.
Harry got distracted by her last comment. "Miss Biello?" he asked.
The trio made their way to Honeydukes, where they stocked up on an assortment of goodies. Harry paid for all of them, assuring Ron that he could pay for their butterbeers later. Then they went up to the Shrieking Shack, where they stood silently, paying their respects to the Mauraders (though not Pettigrew.) After a while, when Harry no longer felt like crying, they made their way back down the hill and walked into the Three Broomsticks, ready to enjoy a nice, warm butterbeer. Ron ordered for them, giving him a chance to make eyes at Rosmerta without Hermione seeing. When he returned with their drinks, they sat chatting amiably and sipping the warm liquid.
Harry's head was spinning. This couldn't be real, could it? He felt a warm hand touch his face, and suddenly everything stopped spinning. Malfoy was looking deeply into his eyes. "Harry," he said plainly. The hand moved to cup his cheek, and Harry sighed in contentment. This is what he wanted. This felt right. He closed his eyes in bliss. Suddenly, a pair of soft, warm lips caressed his own, and blazing heat shot through him. Forget what he had said a moment ago because now everything felt right with the world. Harry was floating, exhilarated. Because he was kissing Malfoy. And he loved it.
"What are you doing up, Mione? It's nearly four in the morning." Hermione gave him a sharp look. "I could ask the same, Harry. I was trying to run an experiment," she gestured at the papers and notebooks surrounding her, "but what's your excuse?" She asked him.
Harry nodded, chewing on his quill again. Draco tugged it out of his mouth, mumbling something about bad habits. Harry cleared his throat. "Yeah. When Nagini attacked Snape, he gave me some of his memories, thinking that he was going to die. He really can be so dramatic. Did he really think I wouldn't do anything? Anyways, I healed a couple of the wounds, then brought him back to Pomfrey. But then I rushed to Dumbledore's office and put the memories into his Pensieve. Among other things, there was a memory in which Dumbledore asked Snape to be the one to kill him when the time came. He was already dying and was worried about the purity of your soul." Harry told him quietly.
Draco stopped him with a single finger held up. "Shhh," he insisted. "I can't put it on if you don't hold the box for me." With that, he shoved the package into Harry's hands and unceremoniously looped the chain around his neck. Harry watched in silence as Draco tucked it into his robes, then gestured to the doors. "Well?" He asked impatiently. "Are we going, or do you have any more surprises?"
He stopped when he was half a meter away from Harry, unwilling to cross the other boy's boundaries of personal space. Hesitantly, he reached out to touch his face, making sure that Harry had plenty of time to voice discomfort. He sensed this was a situation that needed to be handled delicately.
Draco found it hard to decide whether he should take the risk or keep flying. It could mean getting home faster, but encountering a group of muggles would be strange and possibly dangerous. Finding a group of wizards could be even more so. So, Draco flew on.
"You know," Harry started bemusedly, "I expected people to be at least a bit surprised that Draco and I are dating."
"Show me what you do in your free time," Harry suggested. "Surely you can't spend all your time lazing about staring at the ceiling, refusing to talk about me with your mother."
"You know that Sirius was innocent. Wormtail was the one who betrayed my parents and killed all those muggles, which is why Sirius tried to kill him. Unfortunately, he escaped down the sewers as a rat and somehow survived long enough to help Voldemort return. Right under our noses, even."
Draco picked up his wand. "Accio pensieve!"
The Slytherin was not one to just sit there and take it, so naturally, he fought back. He kicked Harry's shin, causing him to howl in pain. "Podder," he hissed, "Whad habe you done?" Harry just kept attacking Malfoy like a rabid animal, kicking and biting and growling and punching everywhere he could reach. He didn't even think to take out his wand.
Draco never was one to back down easily.
"Draco!" Ron exclaimed, bursting into the room, startling Harry badly.
Harry broke. "I blush because of a dream I had," he confessed. A spark of interest lit up the steely eyes. "A dream?" Draco prodded.
After their uneventful lesson, they rushed to Transfiguration. McGonagall tested the limits of their skills and memory when she asked them to transfigure a fish into a bird of their choice. By the end of the lesson, Harry had a sparrow with a dorsal fin, Ron had a flamingo with gills, and Hermione had a perfectly beautiful finch. Malfoy was sitting with a proud eagle owl on his shoulder, also without fault.
Even without looking at his face, Harry could tell that wasn't true. The inaccuracy of his falsehood shone out through his posture, the set of his shoulders, even the way his fingers twitched as he lied. To the untrained eye, his statement might appear to be correct, but Harry knew better. Just seeing Draco slouching enough to be a hairbreadths' away from perfect told him something wasn't right.
They shared a look that was filled with more meaning than words could ever convey. Draco knew what Harry meant.
But their stare-off was prematurely ended when Blaise shoved him towards Potter in a very not-subtle manner. Draco turned to glare at him but was stopped by a smooth voice. "Malfoy," it said simply. Draco turned back to Potter, careful to keep his face devoid of emotion. "Potter," he greeted back. And then:
It was very possible that there had been a burglary in his flat. The first thing Draco did was check the door. Surprisingly, it was still locked and bore no sign of having been forced open. Still, that didn't rule out theft. It just increased the likelihood that the robber had magic on his side, a suspicious occurrence for a muggle neighborhood.
Draco turned and eyed him scornfully. "Like you are any better. You would be on your knees begging in a heartbeat if that's what it took to date Longbottom, Merlin knows why." Blaise grinned unrepentantly. "I would be on my knees for him for other reasons too." He said under his breath. Pansy and Draco both ignored him.
Licking and sucking and biting his way down Draco's neck, Harry made sure to linger in all the most tortuous places, then retraced his path back up the pale stretch of skin. By the time he got to Draco's jaw, Draco was extremely aroused, almost painfully so.
"Draco?" Lucius cut in. "Are your mother's assurances accurate?"
The girl was looking at Draco intently. "Mr. Paul," she said suddenly, "I think you should let it go. If it's a baby, its mommy might be looking for it, and she's going to be much, much bigger. If she comes here, that'll be super dangerous!" Both of the adults looked at the girl in surprise.
"I didn't know if I would see you again," Harry mumbled into his neck. Draco kissed the side of his head soothingly.
I presume you've heard of Draco's disappearance. If not, then I'm sorry you hadn't been notified until now, but Draco vanished by means of a touch-activated Portkey at breakfast. I managed to locate the place he was held (long story short, I followed an owl), but he was already gone.
Harry turned to Ron, who rolled his eyes and said, "He hasn't even bullied the first years. He's changed, mate. We all have."
"Potter was just doing the right thing, as always. You know how he is, protector of the weak and all. He probably thinks of me as some sort of sad charity case. The Death Eater who can no longer defend himself, how pitiful." Draco tried to sneer, but he just sounded sad.
At some point, Draco noticed Harry's eyelids begin to droop. He knew the stubborn idiot would never decide to go to bed on his own, so Draco opted to stop for the night. Together, they made their way down all the stairs to the dungeon. But, they didn't account for poltergeists.
"Shit, already? I completely forgot." Harry flicked his wand to set everything away, already thinking ahead to making dinner. Hyperion sat patiently at his feet, and Harry rewarded him with bits of meat from the curry he was prepping.
The man rolled his eyes. "Feigning amnesia, are we? You can't convince me you don't remember the head of the Royalty and Specialist Protection."
They were silent for a couple more beats, Harry worried and Draco...mysterious.
Harry awoke to the unfortunately familiar ceiling of the Hospital Wing. He blinked, trying to remember the series of events that had led him here. He stiffened as he remembered the alien rage he had felt, and nearly gagged when he recalled how he had acted towards Malfoy, who had been wholly undeserving of it. He sat up slowly, wincing, and wondered why he had been so angry. It was not Malfoy's fault; Harry had overreacted on a large scale. He needed to find Malfoy and apologize right away. He whipped the covers off his bed and swung his legs around, so his feet rested on the floor. He froze.
"My problem, Potter, is that I am losing my touch! How can I call myself the queen of gossip when I remain unaware of all the juicy tidbits that no one else knows of?" Harry wasn't aware that Parkinson was the queen of gossip and quite frankly didn't care. He tried to tell her that, but she wouldn't let him speak.
A Gryffindor stepped forward. Harry vaguely recognized him from two years ago as a rather obnoxious fellow, always boasting in the common room about his various feats. Harry doubted any of his stories were true. To be honest, the bloke reminded him of Lockhart, only slightly more intelligent. The student sneered at Malfoy and kicked his leg.
It gave Harry a chance to think about his situation with Draco. True to form, he had avoided thinking about it at all costs, preferring to ignore the problem. He had only forcibly made peace with it when Pansy had brought up his cowardice because it was affecting Draco too. But Harry had still not thought about his feelings for the boy, and what he may or may not be comfortable with.

The Dark Lord had used it with much success.
I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I wasn't thinking when we decided to make our relationship known. I wish we had contacted you first - your advice would have been appreciated, but it was an urgent situation (Peeves was the cause for that.) I knew the papers would report on it, but I should have anticipated an adverse reaction and prepared Draco for it better. I wish we had thought to warn you, too. I hope you didn't suffer unduly for our hasty actions.
When Alina returned with the book, he accepted it gratefully. Then, mentally readying himself, he adopted a disappointed and slightly pained expression.
His mother was as ethereally beautiful as ever, golden hair flowing down her back. Two braids encircled her head, to which a small golden circlet was pinned. She wore an elegant day dress in dark green, which had the effect of making her look incredibly young. He could not look away.
"Well you were in a relationship, weren't you? And now you're not? That's the definition of breaking up."
"I swear, sometimes she takes after Percy. Mind, don't tell her I said that." Ron looked a bit terrified at the thought of what Ginny would do to him if she ever found out he had compared her to Percy. Harry chuckled. Just then, he caught a flash of blonde hair heading towards the Slytherin table, and his mood soured. He did not want to think about Malfoy just then. He scowled at the blonde.
"Yes, yes, I've got your dinner. Hold on a minute, you hungry bastard." Harry strode to the kitchen to put everything away.
"Harry," came Hermione's reproachful voice. Harry jumped in surprise. He hadn't even noticed his friend in one of the armchairs by the fire. And with her hair, that was saying something about Harry's observational skills that he didn't like.
Draco yelped and scrambled back, but the railing of the balcony prevented him from moving anywhere. He sluggishly threw up his arms to protect his face, accidentally flinging the glass off the balcony, but the magpie had a different target. Though he couldn't see it through his hands, he felt the sharp claws pierce his shirt and the skin over his heart, leaving four shallow but painful puncture wounds.
"And where the fuck do you think you're going?" A very familiar and very pissed off voice rang shrilly through the hall. Draco winced and turned around to face his best friend since childhood. She was standing there, her hands on her hips, the door to the compartment behind her half ajar.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed happily. "How are you here?" He gracefully slid off the bed and approached Harry, kissing him chastely in welcome.
Draco led them to a table that was deeper in the stacks, secluded and separate from the rest of the room. He dumped his bag on the table and unloaded the contents. Harry did the same in the seat opposite him. After a moment, Draco shook his head. "I should sit next to you so we can work together," he said, sliding his books next to Harry, then walking around the table to sit down. Harry nodded and sat down too. Draco quickly realized that Potter was truly awful at potions, just like he had suspected all along.
That evening, Draco headed for the common room while Harry left to study in their dorm. He lounged in his favorite armchair, a grey not unlike the color of his eyes, and stared absently into the flickering fire. The ever-changing colors and leaping tongues of flame captured his attention like nothing else, leaving his mind blissfully empty of complicated thought. Suddenly, he had an epiphany, and he launched himself out of the chair and hurried to his room. Gracefully, of course.
Harry looked surprised. "Why can't you do it?" he asked. Blaise rolled his eyes. "I have to take Longbottom here back to our dorm. He refuses to let go of me." Draco snorted, but he wasn't complaining either
"Do you see him? Did you see his scar?"
Harry was bewildered. "Not particularly," he began, but Parkinson cut him off.
Deciding that Draco-watching was likely to get him in serious trouble, he forcibly turned his attention towards McGonagall's thrilling lecture.
Sincerely,
Draco had an infuriatingly unproductive morning. He couldn't find his wand; his fireplace wasn't working, so he couldn't floo anyone (his floo powder was missing too), and the permanent warming charm in his apartment failed. He couldn't even redo it without his wand. He tried wandlessly summoning the useless piece of wood, but he failed, of course. In the end, Draco decided to go out, hoping in vain that everything would fix itself while he was gone.
"It is-"
They loitered around in the Great Hall, waiting for McGonagall to lead them to their new quarters. After wrapping up a conversation with Flitwick, she turned towards the 8th years and clapped once to gain their attention. "Follow me, if you please." She led them out of the Hall and down one of the stairs. As they moved along, Harry had a sneaking suspicion of where they were going. Sure enough, they stopped at a corridor in the dungeons, halfway from the Slytherin common room to Snape's classroom. McGonagall said the password (unity) to a very haughty looking portrait of an old man in formal robes, and they filed in.
Cursing, Draco rubbed his chest over his shirt. The gray material had been torn beyond repair, which was a shame because it was his favorite outfit. Draco raised his fingers to eye level to check for blood, turning the digits in an effort to catch the light.
Harry was worn out. He collapsed into one of the sofas in the common room, Ron not far behind him. Hermione bustled in, arms full of books and parchment.
"Yes, well, what he was doing isn't the important thing here," Harry quickly said, trying to redirect the conversation. Unfortunately, that meant he wasn't thinking about what he was going to say, so he blurted out: "I kissed him last night. Again."
Harry smiled at her. "You are a genius, Hermione. Maybe I'll try that. But for tonight I'll just walk around the castle a bit like I usually do. 'Night." He said, then walked off to exit the room.
To her credit, she simply raised an eyebrow, looked down at the pie, raised the second eyebrow, and coolly said, "Hello, Mr. Potter. We did not expect you for a few days yet."
Draco thought about it. Did he mind that the whole world would know soon enough that he was dating the Savior of the Wizarding World?
Draco chucked a grape at him. "You're a tosser," the blond informed Harry, fighting a smirk of his own.
"Here!" he shouted, trying to get the others' attention. In the back of his mind, he heard a shrill scream and the crashes and thumps of a fight. Then, one of the other Aurors - Johnson or Smith - rushed beside him. He dimly registered pleading for them to help and their apologetic voice saying they didn't understand what he was doing enough to assist.
"Maybe next time, I'll let Peeves find you!" He said heatedly. Draco rolled his eyes at him. "Calm down, no need to get your knickers in a twist. I merely meant that a little bit of warning would be nice. I nearly hexed you, and we wouldn't want that now, would we?" Harry huffed at him. "I thought you purebloods had good manners. I'm not hearing any sort of gratitude coming out of that mouth of yours. Besides, what are you doing so late at night?"
Harry, the Headmistress, and the Aurors moved into position. They waited a minute to allow the others to reach the spots, and then, Wilson raised his wand and performed a complicated series of motions. At the end of it, a trilling birdcall disrupted the peaceful atmosphere.
Alina, noticing the change immediately, asked him what was wrong.
But sure enough, within a couple of moves, Draco had Ron's king trapped. "Checkmate," he announced smugly. Ron rolled his eyes good-naturedly. Harry was beyond happy that his two friends could get on without murdering each other. He really owed Ron for this.
Hermione gave him a look, but only said, "Harry, if you want to make it to the trial on time, you'd better leave now." Harry quickly glanced at the clock. Merlin, he was going to be late! Lucius' trial was sure to be over soon, but he never had any intention of going to that, so he wasn't disappointed. But if he wanted to get to Narcissa's trial, he would have to leave. He jumped off the bed, then turned to the mirror. "Merlin, Hermione, I look like the Ford Angela ran over me (Ron turned red). I can't go to the trial looking like this! But I need to leave..." Harry dithered, debating the merits of changing into something better, even though it would take a while. Hermione rolled her eyes. "Honestly, Harry, have you forgotten that you're a wizard?" She flicked her wand, muttered an incantation, and soon formal robes had replaced his rumpled muggle clothes. "Thanks, 'Mione," he said sheepishly and turned to leave.
Harry nodded, clenching his fists and digging his nails into his palms to channel his rising anger into something else. He opened his mouth to respond, but Hermione stopped him.
Draco glanced around. Pansy's yelling had attracted quite a large audience. Students were poking their heads out of their compartments, whispering and pointing. Draco sighed. He gently ushered Pansy back into her compartment, sliding the door shut and closing the drapes. He nodded toward the other occupant and said casually, "Hey, Blaise."
Unwilling to give himself false hope until he had more to go off of, Harry looked about desperately for any other evidence that might corroborate his theory. A glint of light caught his eye.
Envision the change. Imagine the human limb morphing to form its creature counterpart.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked anxiously.
"Er, nothing. Nothing at all. In fact, it wasn't even you. You weren't involved in any way, shape, or capacity. Forget you were even mentioned. I didn't say anything. I'm shutting up now, bye, Draco." He tried to rush out of the room, but Draco caught his arm.
He shook himself. He refused to get aroused during class; it would only make things awkward and uncomfortable. Draco suffered through the rest of the lesson; suddenly, everything seemed unbearably dull, and he longed to talk to Harry and give him his mother's letter. He desperately wanted to see the Gryffindor, wondered if there was a chance last night's events had been a fluke, despised the possibility that the brunet had merely been toying with him. Draco knew that he was exceedingly, impossibly lucky that Harry had ever deigned to give him the time of day. It was a privilege he would not squander.
-----------------
They were headed somewhere specific. Walters led him down what seemed like a million different corridors - even growing up in the Manor, this felt a bit excessive - and honestly, Draco thought he might be trying to show off his knowledge of the palace's interior. Perhaps Draco's indifference had annoyed him.
"Because," he said gently, "I want to take this slow. You're not some little fling or passing dalliance. I want to prove to you how much this means to me. I'm not in it for the sex."
That was enough to make Draco pause and chew properly. Once he had swallowed the bacon, he glared at Pansy and said, "No one could ever possible mistake me for that ill-mannered ginger idiot. He is far beneath me." Draco scrunched his nose in disgust. Pansy just snickered.
Ron shuddered and fell in step with Harry. "That slimy Slytherin has been making innuendoes since last night. He does it with all of us, it's a bloody nightmare!"
Then, he heard the rustling of wings and the magpie was gone. Draco slowly lowered his arms, warily looking about in case it decided to come back. It didn't.
Potter. Of course. Draco arched his eyebrow at the boy, who was looking at him with a resigned expression. Draco held back a sigh of frustration and strode over to the Gryffindor. The universe truly hated him.
"Jack!" the woman cried. "He's a cold-hearted man, and you know he gives me the creeps! He'll probably dissect it or do something equally horrific. Oh, Paul, please don't take it to Jack."
———————————————————----
Draco sucked in a breath. "O-okay," he said unsteadily. Harry felt himself start to frown worriedly. "What? Would you rather not be together?" He asked, suddenly panicked. Draco stared at him. "Oh, for- Merlin, we just talked about this," he groaned. Then, he stepped closer, hands reaching up to cup Harry's cheeks. Suddenly, the blond kissed him, softly and sweetly. It only lasted a moment, but it left Harry breathless.
That all ended when Pansy, followed closely by Granger, burst into their room. Blaise and the Weasel trailed behind the girls. "Where were you two?" Pansy shrieked at them. Draco and Harry shared a glance.
He stormed out into the hall, locking his flat behind him. Draco went down the stairs, pulling up his hood as he exited into the rain. He scowled, cursing Potter and every witch and wizard that had voted to restrain his magic. It was too flaky now; magic was already fickle and limiting his control over it did not help in the slightest.
"Where is Draco?" Harry croaked, but the room fell silent anyway.
He moved on to a lavender colored parchment. This one looked like it could be more pleasant, perhaps even sympathetic. He should've remembered that the deadliest things come in the prettiest packages.
Harry sat on the ground beside him. "Is it helping any?" Draco looked frustrated. "No. It tells me I need to clear my mind, which I've no trouble with, but then it says I must practice imagining something with enough detail to be accurate but not so much that I lose sight of the whole picture."
Harry and Ron shared delighted looks. No longer could Snape take points from Gryffindors for the most ridiculous of reasons. It was a dream come true.
He closed his eyes. That familiar feeling of resentment rose in him, making his stomach boil with it. He clenched his hands into fists. It wasn't the voice itself that was detestable. It was quite a nice voice, smooth and rich, like chocolate, and it was the kind of voice that demanded that you listen. If you were in the middle of the Great Hall during dinner, that was the one out of all the other voices that would catch your attention.
"IkindofgotmadatdracoandthenIpinnedhimagainstthewallandwekindofkissed." He rushed out. Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Now again, in English, please." So Harry told them the whole story of how he had kissed Draco and then run away. Ron looked gobsmacked.
Instead, he threw himself into their distractions, hoping they would fill his mind. Yet, it was inevitable that he would be left alone every now and then - Harry couldn't expect the Weasleys to babysit him all the time - and it only took him as long as remembering that Christmas was coming for thoughts of seeing Draco to seep in. From there, it was a short path to worrying about his wellbeing and convincing himself that no, he did not need to Apparate to the Manor because Narcissa would tell him if something were wrong.
When they settled into the only empty seats, unfortunately not together, she cleared her throat and resumed the lesson. While intrigued, Harry found himself incapable of paying attention, especially since Draco sat within his line of sight. He unabashedly stared at the back of Draco's head. It was quite lovely, as far as heads go. The platinum blond strands of hair curled appealingly now that Draco wore them natural, and his neck was long and beautifully curved. Even his ear was somehow aristocratic. Harry wanted to trace it with his tongue.
Draco shook his head irritatedly. "I already know that I'm being overly sensitive; I don't need you to tell me that." He sighed. "It's nothing. It's not something Potter did; it's more something he didn't do."
Warm hands slid around his waist, and he gasped in surprise. "I look forward to it," Harry murmured from behind in his left ear, before slipping away once more. Draco growled but resigned himself to walking up to the castle with an uncomfortable hard-on. "Insufferable prat," he muttered to himself.
"What do you mean, 'more than usual'? He doesn't usually stare at me! He must be up to something." Harry wondered why he didn't think of this before. Whenever Malfoy was acting strange, that meant he was definitely planning something. He ignored the mutual groans of everyone within a five-foot radius of him.
Harry was taken aback. "Why can't you do it?" He asked suspiciously. Zabini rolled his eyes. "I have to take Longbottom here back to our dorm. He refuses to let go of me." He looked strangely delighted at that fact.
"Is it about him, dear?" Parkinson asked gently. Malfoy nodded. Harry wondered who it was before he realized it was none of his business. He began sneaking towards the door, hoping neither of the Slytherins would hear him.
Harry was still hyper-aware of the blonde's every movement. He couldn't concentrate on anything Snape said in potions, because he was too busy trying not to pay attention to Draco. Even though he didn't look at him, he knew exactly when Draco had entered the Great Hall. This was bloody worse than 6th year, and even he knew it.
Draco gave him a sad look. "Harry, I was going to crucio you. I absolutely hated that you saw me so weak and vulnerable. I could have cast quite a powerful one right then. I'm happy that you stopped me from doing something I would regret. And I know you didn't mean to do this, the Golden Boy couldn't possibly use such an evil spell knowingly." Harry still shook his head, stepping back.
"Of course we wouldn't mind. Right, Harry, Ron?" She turned her signature glare on them. Faced with the wrath of an angry Hermione, both of them quickly nodded. Harry noticed Zabini give Malfoy a small shove, causing the boy to stumble towards Harry. Malfoy shot the other boy a glare before seating himself next to Harry.
Draco finished fiddling with the toast and conveniently chose that moment to take a bite, so Harry supplied her with an answer: "Eating."
"Yeah," Harry nodded. "A map of Hogwarts, complete with every secret passage and hidden door ever found, along with the exact location of every being in the castle, living and non-living. The only things not on here are the Chamber of Secrets and Room of Requirement, I think. It's called the Marauder's Map," Harry recited. Draco's eyes grew impossibly wide.
"Memories?" Draco asked. Harry nodded. "Yours?" He nodded again.
Harry was really angry now. "How in Merlin's name is this fine? It's not fine! I would have kept going until I killed you! Nothing about this is fine!" He yelled.
"Why won't you tell me?" Draco asked, sounding small and unhappy. Harry bit his lip. Why didn't he want to tell Draco? It was pretty harmless now that they were together. Why couldn't he give the boy what he wanted? It would make him happy, and that is all that Harry wanted.
Draco kicked a pebble, glowering at all the people whispering and staring at him. He was in muggle London, for Merlin's sake, there shouldn't be so many people looking at him. Yes, he was beautiful and rich and famous - now infamous - but that was in the Wizarding World. The muggles' attention was entirely unwarranted.
"We think the letter was a modified Portkey," Wilson disclosed. "It was probably set to activate on touch since the sender wouldn't have known exactly what time Draco would open the letter. They wouldn't want their effort to go to waste by having an early or late Portkey." Harry nodded because he had figured most of that out already during his frantic pacing.
That was his best bet, Draco decided. As long as he did it carefully, no one would be the wiser. He groped around his bedside table for his wand, then pointed it at his closed drapes, muttering "Silencio." He opened his mouth, paused, feeling slightly ridiculous, and then yelled.
"Potter!" past-Draco said unnecessarily loudly, clinging to Harry, who managed to extricate himself. Past-Draco nattered on about random things. Draco was never drinking again, for fucks sake. Merlin, the things he said. Past-Draco was being singularly embarrassing, talking about someone who had told him to leave for being a Death Eater.
Draco contemplated this for a second. "Would you tell me what they're about?" He asked, interested in what could scare the Boy Who Lived. The brunet looked down, lips pressed together tightly, and shook his head. Before Draco could protest, he elaborated, "They don't have power over any part of me except how much I sleep. The nightmares no longer haunt me - they're just an annoyance. I don't want you to worry unnecessarily."
"See, Maria? I told you this thing was dangerous! Stay behind me," Paul said with false bravado. "Maybe I better call Jack here. He's better equipped to deal with situations like this."
Forever in your debt,
"Could you call me Harry?" he asked. Mr. Potter made him feel very much older than he would like.
"Well, I didn't regret it. I thought we went over this last night? I have feelings for you, Harry. But if you already think we don't have a chance, I suppose there's no point in trying, is there?" he cried frustratedly. It would be just his luck to have a taste of the boy he fancied, only to have him cruelly ripped away the next day. Draco spun around, intent on stalking out of the room and finding somewhere to break down. He quickly ran through a list in his mind. Dorm? No, the others could come in at any time. Library? Too public. Room of Requirement? Too many memories... Maybe he could find a deserted alcove somewhere.
Walters wished him luck and left him to the lion's den. Or, perhaps, a more apt expression would be that he had fallen into a pit of snakes.
Draco leaned back and was pleased to see Harry very flushed, pupils dilated, and mouth slightly parted. Draco's eyes fell on the red lips and the hint of the hot mouth that lay beyond them.
But Harry refused to let it go. He stared at Malfoy, almost boring holes into his head. As if he could sense Harry's gaze, Malfoy looked up. Instead of giving him his trademark sneer, or even a simple glare, Malfoy just looked at him before he turned away to talk to Zabini.
Harry smiled as he recalled finding Draco in the Forest that day and the pleasant things that came after. But now, he had to focus on the book. Draco's nightly project, the task he had been working on nonstop for weeks into the early hours of the morning, sometimes with Harry as his sleepless companion.
"So, you did have a crush on a guy at the beginning of the term?" Harry exclaimed. Draco leaned back in shock. Only seconds later, though, he huffed with exasperation. "Yes, of course. You."
And he did see. He saw a small, black crup puppy.
He turned slowly, dreading what that voice would say to him now. He opened his eyes, staring into the famous green gaze of one Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived to Make Draco Suffer was watching him intently. All the other Death Eaters, including his mother and father, had already disappeared into the forest behind him, no doubt apparating away as soon as they crossed the apparition wards. He should have been with them. But now, he was going to get caught and thrown into Azkaban, all because he couldn't resist the bloody Chosen Git's call.
Harry rolled his eyes. "If you don't mind, Malfoy, I would quite like my hand back." It was Malfoy's turn to blush, and he let go of Harry's wrist like it had burned him. Harry went back to his book.
"Okay, first things first," Hermione said, and her voice calmed him as nothing else could. "Does Mrs. Malfoy know? Even if she does, I think it would be a good idea to write to her, so she knows you're serious about Draco and just as worried as she is."
Harry was not stalking Draco. Arguably, he had never stalked the blond boy. He was just...keeping an eye on him. Keeping an eye out for him, now that they were friends. You know, making sure Draco didn't run into any trouble. Like any good, non-stalker friend would do.
---------------------------------------------------
"Erm...well," Harry hesitated. He wasn't ready for this, but when would he ever be? He didn't have any plausible excuses either...
The next morning, Harry woke up a bit later than they had agreed on, but he counted that as Draco's fault. He should've woken him up.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know, and I never really thought to ask. It took them a lot of work, obviously. Several years, in fact. But they were determined, and they had a good reason, so they kept at it and eventually figured it out. They didn't tell anyone, though I suspect Dumbledore always knew." Draco didn't look satisfied with this answer, but he didn't ask any more questions, either. With the help of the map, which Draco still occasionally glanced at, they made it back to the common room without incident.
Narcissa's reply arrived promptly that evening. It was almost impressive how fast the owl must've had to fly to make it there and back so quickly. Harry, eager for a break from his incessant studies, tore open the envelope and began to read.
"Hyperion?" Harry asked, but Miffy was already gone. So he turned to Draco and repeated his question. All Draco said was, "You'll see."
They didn't talk anymore, and within minutes they reached McGonagall's office, nearly bumping into the headmistress herself as she exited. She blinked at them in surprise. "Don't tell me you already know," she said crossly. "Honestly, you two, what's the point of being the head of this school if my students know everything before me?" she continued to rant while ushering them inside and throwing floo powder into the fireplace.
Harry deliberated. His careful avoidance only made him more curious. He scooted closer to the other boy, intent on finding out what had been bothering him. "Please tell me, Draco. It doesn't matter what it is; I promise I won't say anything," he prodded.
"You won," he whispered, making Draco shiver. Then, he pushed all the way off of the ground, rolling away and standing up. He offered his hand to Draco, who took it and pulled him up. Then, without a glance backward, he collected his broom and made his way up to the castle.
Blaise just gave him a knowing look. "Sure, Draco. But I like the way you think."
Suddenly, Draco exclaimed, "I've done it!" He opened his eyes and smiled smugly. "An exact replica," he noted with satisfaction. He leaned forward and kissed Harry once more, a short peck, before excitedly turning back to his book. He flipped to the next page and got lost in the words almost instantaneously.
Malfoy thought he deserved this, and if Malfoy wanted to face justice, then who was Harry to stop him? But then again, it was only justice if the court knew all the facts, and Ron was right that he would feel guilty about it, especially with that look on Malfoy's face...
"You did not!" Harry said delightedly. He lifted up the puppy and immediately cuddled it. Draco melted at the adorable sight. "Why Hyperion?"
Draco bit his lip. Harry's eyes were drawn by the gesture, and he flushed and looked away. Luckily, Draco was too preoccupied to notice. "You could..." he trailed off, thinking hard. Then, his face lit up. "I know! You could write a book!"
Draco ignored him and Pansy and looked away, his arms crossed. Why had he been angry in the first place? Potter didn't owe him anything. In fact, it was Draco that owed Potter. So why was he so angry that Potter didn't want to talk to him? It was entirely understandable that the Chosen One didn't want to talk to a Death Eater. And yet the thought made him feel queasy. Their ride went on in silence until they reached the castle. When he finally looked at his friends, they were still watching him, except now they had identical smirks. Draco huffed and hurried into the Great Hall, sitting down at the Slytherin table as far away from everyone else as possible. Pansy and Blaise followed him, unperturbed.
“Yes, casually.” He glances at her, suddenly worried. “How did you know?”
Draco refuses to admit he feels a bit disappointed and leans against the back wall, hands in his pockets.
“So, Harry, Where have you been staying?”
“Gee, thanks for the pep talk.”
With both hands free, Draco opens the envelop and takes out its content.
“I mean his own fucking money. He doesn’t want anyone to know, because of some fucking Gryffindor’s pride shit or something, but this place runs on Harry’s personal funds.”
“And you’re going to spend your entire summer here, surrounded by kids? That’s not much of a holiday.”
Draco nods. Harry grabs it and take a sip. He’s still staring at him, waiting for him to talk.
“That’s great for you, but you know you could ask for more funding, right? You would get it.”
Potter raises his eyebrows with a smirk. “I thought we were going for a drink.”
She asks him to give a tour – another one – to the prospective parents she was meeting with, and he gladly accepts as he shakes Draco’s hand to wish him a pleasant day.
Without any further mention of what just happened, he walks toward the bar.
“Is he a safety and secrecy risk?”
“It’s enchanted so it can’t hurt, why does it matter?”
“Then what do you think, Potter? Enlighten me.”
“Don’t puff yourself up like a Gryffindor, Potter.”
Harry laughs. “Well, I still love the place. Besides,” he adds as he puts his hand on Draco’s cheek, “We had so much fun, there, you and I, didn’t we?”
The room is fuller than the last time they were there, and Draco can hear laughs and recollections of today’s game already. Potter walks straight toward the same table they were last time, which appears to be empty. Is it luck, or is it Potter’s own table? He waves at some people sitting here and there, even stopping a couple of times to exchange a few words about the match.
“Have fun!” the kids answer all in one voice.
talked about the game. You were a far more sophisticated person with a broader conversation range.”
talked shit about me and the orphanage for a few years before finally saying it was a good thing. Not that I care about what they print, but a lot of people do.”
“You’re my cousin, right?” Teddy asks. “How come we’ve never met?”
? Do you hear yourself, really?”
He turns back expectantly, and Draco is standing in the rectangle of his door, arms at his side, staring at him, his face impenetrable. But then he just shakes his head, turns around and closes the door.
Harry lays down his head in the curve of Draco’s neck. “I’m very happy you’re here,” he whispers.
“Bathroom’s that way, if you need to,” Potter says, pointing a door with a toast already in his hand.
“You did a good job, with the fundraiser. No one could tell you hated it.”
“The dirty children,” Potter nods sternly. “Come on, let’s be as quick as possible, maybe she’s turned her back to the door or something.”
Harry intertwines his fingers with Draco’s. “Yeah, it’s not exactly standard, but Charlie had one and he knew this artist who could do it, and I loved it so I got one. It’s actually quite interesting, the woman was explaining to me that it was kinda the same technique used in painting? So the portraits can move and talk, you know. She actually was a painter, originally, but she loved tattoos, so when she tried doing some she wanted to put her painter experience to use and she developed this technique. Obviously mine can’t talk, since it’s a snake, but Charlie has a dragon that can actually spit fire. That’s pretty cool. She does some really impressive work.”
i did not come here to write quidditch games and yet it seems that it's the only thing happening.
But Draco is still as impassible as ever as Harry guides him as fast as possible away from the dark spot, toward a safer part of the garden.
“Draco, do you want to come?” Potter asks. “We’ve got to take the kids back to the school first, but we can go for a drink after, if you want?”
“Oh, Harry.”
“Weasley,” Draco says behind Harry.
Harry raises his glass in silence, and Draco echoes his move. For a while, they only eat and drink, avoiding staring at each other. The humming of background conversations and clinking of glasses and plates echoes between them. Draco eventually turns to him and smiles.
She nods, letting out a sigh.
Harry takes off his shirt, letting it drop on the floor. Draco is faced with the huge tattoo on his back, representing a wolf, a doe, a stag and a dog. The snake is coiled up at their feet, but seems to wake up as Harry stretches his arms. The other animals move as well, but their movements are more similar of a picture – just a repetitive loop. The snake seems truly alive, and he goes up to Potter’s right shoulder, joining the hippogriff splashing his wings.
