It’s Harry’s handwriting. It’s worse than it used to be, sure, but it’s his, Draco knows it. Harry wrote to him.
"A little bit like that. See, the match ends as soon as I break formation here because, unless their Seeker catches early, they’ll lag behind for the rest of the match," Harry said.
How can he think he’d ever be an imposition on Draco. How can he even think that? “Harry, I—” Draco starts, tentatively, but Harry cuts him off.
After a few days—weeks? Draco’s not sure anymore—Harry stops responding. His eyes are becoming increasingly distant with each passing hour in this dreary place.
Harry tried to commit this afternoon to memory. Harry would need it to keep himself going through the season. During extended time on the road, there was always a part where he started to feel a little low, a little listless. It was the one piece of his advice he took from his Healer. He stored up some good memories.
"Maybe they needed the money," Harry said. He thought it was unlikely, but it was gratifying to be on the receiving end of one of Draco’s dramatic eye rolls. He expected it, even. Some things shouldn’t change.
Draco doesn’t know for how long he walks. The sun disappeared behind the thick dome of darkened leaves hours ago, but he’s unsure if it’s just hidden behind the darkness emanating from that place or if it’s just set. He’s lost count of time, the same way it'd happened when he met Harry at the After place.
Harry was more startled by the use of his name than anything. He assumed Draco would be stubborn and continue to call him Mr Potter or Potter, and they would keep their distance that way. But Draco just brushed that aside like it was nothing.
to rise above it all and make Draco seem immature. Except that very few people are actually looking at Draco, not enough to notice how spiteful and sardonic he's feeling about it all.
An elegant looking eagle owl swooped into the garden as Harry and Draco were lounging, trying to catch the first bit of genuine sunshine in late April. Harry rarely got Owl delivery direct from anyone. His mailing service and wards should have prevented it.
Up the stairs, the hallways were brighter with the skylight. The garden in the courtyard was still fragrant and wild. Water burbled cheerfully in the bird bath and the call of some unseen bird sounded high up above the dome. There was the gym and the formal dining room with the cabinet hutch full of china. There were little silver tabs and, when Harry touched one, it was Draco’s neat handwriting that said ‘Euphemia Potter, soup tureen’.
of the tree. He wanted to harness the magic of your grounds. Did he… Did he kill anyone in the house? Maybe near the tree?”
"I hate it when you’re like this. Can’t we leave some mystery in the world?" Draco asked. He didn’t sound annoyed though, just embarrassed. And Harry liked the idea of Draco knowing his habits. After a long pause Draco said, "The trial."
The stabilising dome collapses at the same time as his Stasis spell fades, having nothing to hold on to anymore.
Harry’s eyebrows crease, but he complies. “Hermione and Pansy told me the killing curse shot at me killed Voldemort’s soul inside of me. And for being close to the Tree of Life, it opened a portal to Limbo.”
The prospect of having one answer is exhilarating, Draco understands that, but still it doesn’t fix Harry’s problem.
But Harry suspected he wouldn’t have been as honest as he had been with Draco with a complete stranger. He wouldn’t have been as nasty either, and especially not about something as inconsequential as food. He would have felt he was entirely in the right if they had come across some Dark artefact, and Draco had said "you must see the merits of keeping and using it on innocent Muggles", and Harry had said "it’s wrong and I knew you were up to something."
"You understand me perfectly," Draco said. The levity in his tone failed to touch his eyes. Harry picked up a fine chain necklace whose links were interwoven leaves with diamond chips embedded.
When he first came across information about the After place, he didn’t quite grasp the concept of a place without time, light or emotion. Of a place filled with emptiness. He understands it now, as he glances up and the blank sun kisses his skin with an ashen light that never changes, no matter how many days, weeks, months they’ve been here.
Harry had forgotten since Stella and Darcy had done it most often on his behalf. It was months away. Next season. They might still be together then. After tonight, Harry was hopeful. Harry had asked and Draco had come.
"Dinner?" Harry asked. It had been a late afternoon weekend match. It was still dark out early this time of year.
Harry knew of course, but this was the first Draco mentioned his parents to Harry. It had been a lovely night though, and it seemed a shame to ruin it by asking any more.
Pansy sat him in the studio chair and leaned on the vanity. Harry groaned. "Is that today?" he asked.
Draco doesn’t say as much, but both of them know what’s keeping him awake at night, what’s eating up his energy and wearing down his magic.
Harry realised with a jolt that he wandered into conversations he was in no way prepared for. One Slytherin was enough. A pack of them was something else entirely. Astoria blushed but declined to answer the accusation, twirling a blonde strand around her finger.
A few days have passed since his visit to Malfoy Manor. Draco still can’t shake the cold from his bones. While his body wants to give up, however, his mind is sharp and racing a mile a minute. He just can’t give up now, on Elle or Harry. He can’t
Harry had no idea why he’d just been so honest with him. Draco Malfoy was in his home. Draco Malfoy was in his things. Draco Malfoy knew him a little more than he would ever have a right to. More than Teddy who he told the nail varnish was just for fun, and more than Ron who seemed afraid to ask when he noticed, like he might say something off-colour and Hermione would take him to task for it. A
Draco was also wearing rings. Three old silver rings on each hand. Delicate and mismatched. Harry wondered if he had to pencil in time in his morning routine to figure out exactly which details would make him look most like an antique-hunting shopkeep. It devastated Harry to discover he liked it.
Mrs Weasley shakes her head, patting him on the shoulder. “That’s not enough. I hear you’re going back to work soon. You need to be strong.”
It didn't feel like a victory until their friends and family poured out of the VIP stands. Harry was happy enough to see Luna, Dean, Hermione, and Ron. He hugged them all.
"Well, your job is to make the house stop doing this. So stop it," Harry snapped. "I don’t want wasted food."
Harry had spent a little time post-war sitting in Regulus’ room, wondering if anything left behind would indicate his last days. There was nothing but a neat sheaf of correspondence to friends, trimmed quills, pristine school textbooks, and a collection of old robes that had long since fallen out of fashion. The room looked like Regulus had stepped out for a walk and would return shortly.
He doesn’t expect Potter to talk, nobody does, but when Marvin’s about to close their session, the wizard lifts his arm. Marvin’s smile is soft and welcoming as he nods to him to go on.
look at him. At the way his dark locks curl around his face, the way those new spectacles frame his face. Harry’s gained weight. His sleeves are tight on his biceps, his high cheekbones fuller.
Harry probably takes the silence as an invitation to talk more. He rubs his neck, averting his eyes from Draco, embarrassed. “In your letter you said you had something to talk to me about?”
A small notebook rests loosely on Marvin’s knees as he skims across the pages. The saturated yellow on the cover has become a familiar sign among them, and a low chatter fills the room as it slowly crowds with familiar faces.
"Yeah," George said, hanging his head. A chill from the stone bench set in Harry's bones and he shivered. "I just..." He trailed off.
It was wishful thinking, Draco realises, to have believed the papers would let this slide. They already had so much to publish about Harry Potter, they didn’t really need to finish carving Draco’s grave with news about the divorce.
It doesn’t work like that. Forgetting is not an option, he realised, hiding in his flat, constantly haunted by memories that turned into nightmares, and then into memories again. A long and distant cry for help no one heard, the burning tip of a wand marring his skin, and his mother’s tears. Draco can never forget and may never forgive himself.
Hermione comes by after the fourth week, looking more guilty about feeling hopeful than of having abandoned Draco to his misery. Not that he can blame her, but he misses the company of the friend he found in the brilliant woman. It’s depressing how much has changed because Harry hates him now.
She rolls her eyes. “You know what, take a month. Or two. Take the entire year, Draco, if you need it. Your job will be here when you come back.”
The annoying clacking of Pansy’s heels against his marble floor makes him cringe inwardly. He wonders absently how she got in. Then,
“And I... I hurt...” Whatever Harry’s going to say, he thinks better of it. “This is... This is crazy, Malfoy. This is...” He snorts, a wicked grin dances on his lips as he shakes his head, dislodging his fringe. “Five years,” he adds, panic edging his voice.
He takes a stool and orders two more glasses of whisky—not his favourite, but he’s pretty much going with whatever Blaise wants tonight. That’s when someone sits by his side.
They started in the basement, with the kitchen and hearth, proud and clean. His maternal grandmother’s pots were in a rack above the kitchen island, and his paternal grandmother’s knives and spices sat proudly on the maple counters. They had settled on a cheerful green above the wood panelling. Harry bent over and noted Draco had rebound the notebook with recipes, preserving the original behind a sturdy black cover.
No, he can’t make it in two seconds, and she’s already rushing towards him,   as if she knows exactly what he’s thinking. She probably does, given that she's known Draco for at least ten years and is very familiar with his quirks.
And he does. Despite himself, he finds he’s a lot more anxious about the whole ordeal than he’d initially expected.
"You loved him," Harry said. Pansy had all but said as much. Draco looked into the distance before continuing.
Draco pulls Harry’s hand warily. “Harry, there’s something I need to tell you…” he starts, shaking, holding Harry’s hand between both of his and looking at him searchingly. “I’m not really dead. We have to go back.”
But minutes tick by and Harry stays quietly secluded on his side of the bed. Draco takes another deep breath, controlling the urge to just shake the man and maybe coax out whatever he wants to say by force. Instead, he asks, “So?”
"Who am I to turn down free food?" Draco said, which was probably the most insulting answer to a date Harry had ever received in his life, but he still found himself reluctantly charmed.
The animal has adapted quickly to their lives, but Draco guesses it must be easy when they have food and a place to eat. And they’ve adapted to her.
"I put the piano in the library," Draco said. Harry followed him upstairs where books were still stacked in piles everywhere except the shelves. Even so, the piano fit in seamlessly with the glossy black wood and golden lettering.
“Are you saying…” Draco tries, but his voice comes out hoarse. He repeats, “Are you saying it’s my fault you’re like this? Here?”
From the content of Harry’s message and the disgraceful amount of typos, Draco’s half aware of the state he might find his boyfriend (the word has a nice ring to it and he can’t keep the smile off his face) in.
"I appreciate you saying that," Harry said. This consideration about what it would mean for Harry’s personal life was more than what most people would do in Percy’s position. "I think I have to."
He has the video recording of their wedding playing on the telly. Harry had insisted on getting that bloody Muggle camera, because
Harry chortles behind his hand and the glance he directs at Draco almost makes him melt. “My Hagrid?”
Draco hasn’t thought he would enjoy anything as much as he enjoys her company. He doesn’t let the thought that once she’s gone, the house will be empty and cold again, linger in his head. Draco grins as he hears the woman babbling continuously about whatever show she’s been watching on the TV Draco and Harry had gotten for her years earlier.
"I need you to ask Percy for a favour for me," Harry said the day after the Ministry visit. He had gone to Falcons HQ to use the pitch and see her. Harry was used to seeing her around. He missed her.
Draco grimaces, face heating and shoulders hunching. He remembers it more than he’d like to. How he almost destroyed the house in a fit of anger because... He shakes his head and smiles apologetically. “It was because of the photos on the papers. Of you with other... men. I was jealous. I’m sorry, it was not my place.”
Draco wants to tell him about the bond, tell Harry he’s the one pulling him and urging him to stay, but he can’t lose this now. He wonders if he should be more terrified of the way Harry’s slowly slipping away. He probably would be, if they weren’t as close as they are now.
Draco blinks at the pie once before staring at Mia’s sympathetically creased lips. Warmth spreads inside his chest. “Yeah, me too. But Harry doesn’t think so right now.”
"Lupin, how’s it going?" Stella said, stopping her bike and wiping her brow. Teddy started telling her about the Portkey trip. Then, again, like Oliver, Teddy knew Stella from years and years of camps and parties.
He’s here. Draco can finally hold him, kiss him, grab every part of his soul and bind it to his own until there’s nothing left to say, until they become one. There’s no warmth in their touch, not even when Draco’s lips come to rest on Harry’s, or when Harry’s hand grabs tightly onto his waist for dear life. But he doesn’t mind that in the least.
“And then,” Harry goes on, sighing. “The bond. I was so mad. But not because of the bond—I can accept it. It feels… Good, not to be alone. But that you didn’t tell me. I thought we were becoming friends.”
, he repeats constantly. Work, drink as much coffee as he can, go home, read the papers, and drink until he falls asleep on the couch. This is a good routine.
Draco doesn’t raise his voice, but people are staring at them and it’s not because of Hermione’s black Unspeakable robes, though they usually suffice to attract at least a few curious glances. Maybe they should have gone to a Muggle restaurant, though Draco’s getting used to being watched again after years of relative peace. Hell, if he’s completely honest, he enjoys it. Maybe he can give them something true to talk about:
She also mentions that Harry, more often than not, sketches a cat who’s oddly similar to Ruby in his notebook.
Harry pouts. The girls are too distractedly squealing at the stray to even notice. “So? I want a dog now.”
Mrs Weasley’s laughter echoes in the room. She shakes her head, as if he’s joking. “Just though we could have some lunch, dear,” she says, not looking at him and strolling towards the kitchen, the trays following suit.
Draco feels like all the air leaves his body at once, even though there’s really nothing inside him. That’s his husband, staring at him, stretching a hand out to him. Draco looks at it warily, afraid to avert his gaze from the eyes he’s learned to read. But when he looks back at them, Harry’s still here.
"The house will take care of it for now," Draco told him as they tried to figure out where Harry was going to put a Goldstein full-size concert piano that had belonged to his mother shipped with a long letter in Russian.
He wants to assure her everything will be fine, she’ll be healed and out of St Mungo’s in no time, but that isn’t a certainty he possesses. Draco grins at the girl, thankful for the marginal comfort Harry’s visits bring to her.
He doesn’t have many, not for a long time, not since he’s moved in with Harry and has his heat as a comfortable reminder that he’s not alone. Not until the fear of losing Harry shifts into something palpable and cruel.
Harry deflates a little, though his eyes still seem to burn with the same intensity. That's something rare these days. “Why don’t you just let me—”
"I hate all of you," Sam said with a smile. "Besides the joy of being away from these fucking pricks, how was your summer Milosh?"
it. Not only by the way the bond screams something is missing, but by Harry himself. He’s distant. His presence is turning into a fading sensation, like small droplets of rain prickling on his skin. Harry’s usual wild and electric magic is a low hum now, just out of reach, whenever they’re not physically close to each other.
“I wanted to ask you something, actually,” Harry starts, his expectant gaze trained on Draco, who all but holds his breath, afraid anything he says might break this moment. He only wants to keep seeing Harry almost everyday like this. Hearing his voice is a bonus he might get used to.
"For a long time, it was fashionable for people to claim they had something of Merlin’s. My family had a gauntlet," Draco said. He spoke warmly of the objects even though he hadn’t warmed back up to Harry.
Harry on the telly rests his head on past-Draco’s shoulder, whispering something in his ear that Draco will never forget.
This year’s offseason project began like all the others. During the finals, Harry thought of nothing but Quidditch until the Cup was in hand. His teammates sprayed him with ice cold champagne on the pitch. Oliver Wood kissed him full on the mouth at the Falcons private afterparty. The kiss was more out of gratitude than any romantic feeling since they were exes, although Oliver’s boyfriend Winston had looked properly annoyed, regardless. Harry didn’t get back to his hotel room until six am, veins buzzing with the sweetness of victory. He could do anything.
Once, Harry had told Draco that what they felt was infinite. No matter where they were, their love would still live inside them, of their hearts, their memories. Their lives were intertwined. They’d be forever living the same moments, again and again, at a point in time.
"Well, I suppose no one's ever asked me to marry them, and I've never wanted to ask anyone," Harry answered. They amused him. This pretend press conference was much more fun than the real thing.
“Draco,” she squeals, fingers so tight on his wrists that Draco has the urge to jostle them free to alleviate the pressure in his sensitive skin.
He thought about Floo calling someone who would come over and help him de-stress, but he wasn’t interested in dealing with someone right now. Instead, he had a nice leisurely wank, remembering the last time annoying Niall from Gringotts had blown him.
Draco nodded, his expression thoughtful. "I understand that. Being busy helps. I can’t remember the last time I went more than a week without a work project."
The booth they take is private enough, and once Blaise returns with their drinks, they fall into a pleasant conversation.
"I think it is your lunch time. Can we all say a big thank you to Mr Potter for answering questions?" Pansy said. She was gentle with them, but something about her voice seemed to captivate them. They hung off her every word like she had sweets in her pockets.
On Monday, Draco entered Grimmauld without a greeting because, of course, he did. "Did you know—" Draco was bright-eyed and practically frantic as he came in the front hallway and began pacing.
They don’t talk about Harry’s curse, still present, still pulsing just under his skin. Draco tried bringing it up once, but Harry avoids the subject and he doesn’t try to force it again.
Then, Draco jolts upright, eyes wide and senses sharply returning. He has trouble separating the reality of his surroundings and the dreadful memory of death. “He’s awake.”
Other minor details pushed all this new information away. Harry ended up writing Penelope about his ankle, then sorting through his mail service. The next morning, he was so in his own head during his last set of weighted lunges that he lost count. He was still stretching when a knock sounded at his front door. A glance at his watch said it was already ten. He scrambled.
He pulls Harry close, arms around his waist. Harry resists. Then he sobs, his body sagging against Draco’s, head resting on his shoulder.
"When the incident happened with his ex, I should have told him I was on his side. Instead, I told him not to fight on two fronts with his parents. Draco plays close to the chest. I never knew how much Daniel meant to him until it all went to hell. Not that there’s any excuse. He felt betrayed and, as you’ll recognise, I don’t know how to say sorry."
Teddy led Harry upstairs to his bedroom where Draco and Teddy had been sitting. In the middle of the carpet, there was a pile of incongruous things: a paperclip, a marble, an orange, a tennis ball. There was no way to avoid sitting closely in a room this small, so Harry lowered himself to the ground centimetres from Draco. He was conscious of Draco’s sock clad foot by his knee, but if it bothered Draco, he didn’t show it outwardly.
“Have you eaten today? I brought all your favourites.” Mrs Weasley’s grin is full of love when she stares back at Draco. He wonders how much Pansy and Hermione might have told her about his... condition, and how much of it the woman figured out on her own. It’s not hard to realise, with one look at him, that Draco’s not doing splendidly.
"We’re a Championship team with high standards. Atty Blake is a wonderful Chaser, and I have full faith we’ve made the best investment for the team," Harry said to the press corps. It wasn’t what he wanted to say, but it was a bit early in the season for getting on Barb and Pansy’s bad side.
Despite being bulkier than Draco, his joggers end up being large for Harry and he has to fold the hems so they don’t drag on the floor. He looks good, though, hovering near his furniture as if he’s always belonged there, and wearing Draco’s favourite sweatshirt. It’s the first piece of clothing Draco bought after he left home. The fading turquoise contrasts beautifully with Harry’s tanned skin.
Harry nodded. Draco pulled him in close and landed them by Harry’s. Not at the Apparition Point, but not at the house either. There were the spins.
It wasn't a question but Harry breathed, "Yes. Yes, if you want." God, Draco must be a devastating fuck with that mouth on him.
"I have to work tomorrow. I er…I have to do an off-season event with the Falcons. It’s with kids with a camp we run."
She gave a toss of her head and crossed her arms. "Imagine my surprise when Daph and Gemma told me you came to Cloaks with Malfoy for New Year’s," Pansy huffed.
"I was very lucky to have found Quidditch post-war. It gave me a way forward that had nothing to do with things that happened before I was born. I am…very thankful for that. On the pitch, all anyone expects from me is to catch the Snitch."
Potter's gaze flicks towards him. Draco’s found it is somewhat disconcerting staring into those green eyes—sometimes bright, sometimes distant—but he’s always drawn to them and he can’t avert his eyes, even if he wants to.
Draco explains how their—his, Hermione’s and Pansy’s—research had led him here. Though they already knew Voldemort used sacrifices to seize the Tree of Life’s magic, they still hadn’t exactly grasped what had been different about Harry’s death. He explains that only when they’d realised sacrificing something dark near the Tree of Life would open a portal to the After place was that they understood what had been different. Because Harry had a part of Voldemort’s corrupted soul inside of him. This tainted part of the wizard’s soul, still living inside Harry, had been sacrificed when Harry died.
But Luna was only concerned about him. She barely paid attention to his apologies and pretended not to hear him when Draco talked about her time at the Manor. They never forgot and it might never stop hurting completely, but they both accepted and moved on.
"That wasn’t fair of him. But this wasn't fair of you," Harry said gently. "Pansy’s a friend of mine."
"Jan’s dad has a red Ferrari convertible. It has a button, and the top goes down by itself. It goes really fast."
"Good. I worried about him with his parents," she said. "I started writing to him after the notice, but you never can tell by a letter what the truth is. He's a fine enough young man underneath, all things considered."
“I cannot believe Healer Parkinson allowed this to happen,” she murmurs, raking a hand through her hair.
Well, Draco knows that. He feels it in Harry’s energy whenever he carries himself through the corridors and from what Harry had told him about feeling on edge when he woke up. But he still is here so often Draco sees him almost every day.
"Shut it, Harry. I can ask at least. This is the closest you’ve come to a romantic prospect in a year."
Draco heaves a strangled noise. Takes a gulp of air and holds a hand to his heart as he sits back. Harry mirrors his position, sitting back on his haunches. Draco says, as evenly as he can, “I can research a way for severing the bond without hurting us, of course. I am very close to attaining answers about magical core and compatibility with Elle, and I believe if I can apply my research to—”
“I don’t see it.” Harry shrugs again. “Not anymore. Haven’t since I first got here. I’m kinda stuck.” His laugh is dry and lifeless.
Despite having been hurt by the cup, Draco looked delighted. "Very clever anti-theft magic." He turned the cup around. "Look at the signature at the bottom." Harry leaned in close and could see the initials HP in print.
He contemplates burning everything down and building a new house from scratch, there’s no way he’d still remember Harry then. That’s when he hears the voice coming from the living room.
Harry came all hot and relieved onto his stomach. It took a few moments for Harry to stop shaking apart. He turned then to kneel before Draco, knowing full well he was making a mess of both of them.
“Yes!” Pansy agrees animatedly. “Hogwarts always feels like a home to everyone, right?” All of them nod. “It’s because it’s made of our magic, of parts of us. It can sense the needs of those it shelters.”
Draco tilted his head. Harry felt as if even in black stocking feet, idly munching on his toast, Draco could see right through him.
Draco’s mind and body feel sated and loose later at night, induced by three glasses of wine, a distracted reading about ancient Celtic marital rituals, and their music—though, now, it’s rather
, he thought. Breathing, yes, but just a shell, devoid of anything that made him the person Draco fell in love with. He had cried and yelled and called Harry back—
Harry doesn’t hesitate again. “Yes. Yes.” He kneels down, arms around Draco’s shoulders and head shoved against his neck.
Draco gets lost in her arms, even if they’re not the ones he wants right now. Even if her voice is not the right one. If her presence doesn’t bring the comfort he needs. And he cries, because that’s all he can do while trying to keep himself whole.
"I told Hermione that it might be…nice to have another. And she said ‘what if our second kid is as smart or smarter than Rosie?’ so you know, I’ll never sleep again."
When Harry comes traipsing back to the kitchen, though, the first thing that tumbles out of Draco’s lips is, “Are they still a thing?”
"Not at all," Draco said. Harry tried to get a grip. Draco was looking at him with such profound sympathy that he had to, otherwise…
It’s no surprise that Harry can’t move. They expected that. It doesn’t make it easier to see him lying still on that bed, almost none of his usual vigour showing.
Harry thought about kissing Draco again, but the pool had a glass wall to where the restaurant and bar were, and thought better of it. Draco seemed willing to take his lead, although Harry was nakedly aware that if they had been at home, he wouldn’t have thought anything of a kiss.
Just what the actual fuck is Harry Potter doing here? Draco’s heard about the Saviour’s return to London, after two years traveling around the world, but this... How did he end up here of all places?
. Each feeling battling fiercely to overwhelm him—happiness, comfort, relief, along with that old anger and sadness, all the pain and suffering. He lets hope win, as his feet finally move, no longer frozen to the spot.
Harry was careful approaching him, and Draco almost seemed startled when Harry faced him. His face was unreadable, mouth drawn and eyes hard. He was dressed as casually as Harry had ever seen him, with black jeans, tasselled loafers, and Harry’s grey Falcons sweatshirt.
, he’s barely prepped enough for it. Draco pushes himself inside Harry, and tries to bury within him all that he feels, all that he is now, and Harry takes him with a pliant body and cries that welcome Draco easily. It’s not enough, nothing is, but maybe it will be someday.
It’s only once he’s out that the realisation finally dawns on him. It worked. His spell worked. Elle is
Hermione’s grin brightens when she tells him she and Pansy are talking about having children, and that it’s still premature and they’re not sure how to approach it and are insecure about being mothers—
He’s disappointed. Harry’s sad, because Draco had lied to him, hiding something so important from him for so long.
Harry remembered what Draco had told him about house magic. So he sang to the house a little while he cooked and cleaned. He wasn’t very good at singing, but the house didn't seem to mind. Then went for his second workout. Draco didn’t return until late evening, looking quite a bit more flustered than usual. His hair curled damp on his forehead. He held out a black velvet ring box, head bowed.
"New skill: I want everyone to be able to scramble from a two-handed hold back onto the broom in one shot. Twenty seconds, no wild swinging. Look at this re-creation from a LatAm League game."
The first thing Draco registers is her arms around him so tightly he might pass out—either out of breath or affection. And then, trays floating around their heads, the scent of meat, spices and sweets filling his nostrils all at once.
“I can’t do this right now,” Draco declares, in a low cool tone. The words oddly similar to what he said to Harry before he left Serendipity. “Can we reschedule?”
"Rose, my darling, you’re going to sleep," Hermione said, scooping up Rose from the carpet where she’d begun to cry. "Say good night to Uncle Harry, bumblebee."
"I don’t know," Draco answered simply. He pressed one hand to the walls of the front hall. The candles flickered as if they were telling him something. Draco’s wand remained in his shoulder holster, so Harry wasn’t certain what he was even doing. All the other Curse-Breakers had cast several spells first.
"She already signed, Stella. We’ll play some pickup, that’s it." They were both thinking of Coach and the unspoken convention that rookies never came before summer training camp, but Harry held more sway in this situation, and he’d be the one to pay if it upset Coach.
Harry’s friends laugh, but Harry’s loving gaze, now fixed at Draco, is proof enough that he truly believes the joke. Harry pulls him by the collar into a kiss, and the table erupts in whistles and drunken chuckles of, “you’re making me nauseous, we believe you,” and, “get a room!”
Autumn bled into winter without a break. The Falcons were still ranked number one in the League. There was no disputing that, even though every win meant more bad press and losing changed nothing. They were no longer a team that had made an impressive come-back or the underdog adapting to a new style of play. The Falcons were the team to beat and the coverage was almost universally nasty.
He obviously doesn’t tell Harry that he lost the bet, because Harry had been too jealous to let Draco strip off his robes when the time came, instead devising some tale about him being too prim and proper to stand bare in front of so many people. Draco avoids talking about
Harry took himself for a long walk, a meandering path through the neighbourhood for his active rest. It would have made more sense to head to a park, but he wandered all the way to City University of London and back, enjoying just being out with people.
Just like he loves the mug Draco got for him. He’s so protective of it, Draco doesn’t understand at first why there’s tea under a stasis charm filling it. Harry rarely likes the taste of things under stasis charms.
It’s clear Harry doesn’t know what to do with his life now. Draco laughs when Harry tells him Teddy tried to convince him to teach at Hogwarts, so they’d be close all the time and this way Harry wouldn’t forget him again. He says all this with a pang of sadness in his voice, although he’s smiling too.
It’s not like he didn’t know. He’s been living that reality since the day he sent Harry back his wedding ring.
"Of course not. Orgies. Textbooks. Cauldrons. Sex with Draco Malfoy. Ordinary school year. They should put it in the Hogwarts brochures for parents of prospective students. Why doesn't anyone invite me to orgies?"
"Our dear Captain!" Oliver said. He punched Harry in the arm so hard, Harry's left side went numb for a few seconds. Both Luc and Milo headbutted him affectionately.
“No, you’re not. This is not a request. It’s an order.” Her fingers finally slip from his shoulder, and he rolls it unconsciously. “You haven’t taken time off since your mother died, I can’t—”
"Hi. Thaddeus. Padma says you’re a Falcons fan." Padma trailed behind him. Thaddeus made an undignified sound and turned beet red.
"Let me heal that for you." Harry reached out and carefully held Draco's hand in his own. It was hot, and he was trembling a little. There were limits to magic when it came to delicate spellwork. Harry pulled out all the glass shards embedded in Draco's palm with a spell he'd learned from another player for removing gravel from skin. Then he healed the cuts and cleaned Draco's hand of the blood.
wrote it," said Draco. He was still watching figurines. Harry knew. Already, people were claiming they were always against the bill, and it was never under serious consideration.
"I’m not interrogating you. No need to tell me your life story," Draco said. He was doggedly emptying little drawers in an armoire with a dozen of them, and more and more hidden with magic. All so far were empty.
Elle shifts her gaze from one to the other, eying Draco carefully, as if expecting any adverse reaction. Draco’s not entirely sure from whom.
Draco’s last hope had been finding Harry here. So, he had sacrificed himself, knowing the Dark Mark had rendered part of his soul dark many years ago. Pansy waits for him—for them—on the other side, his anchor in the mortal helm.
"But, it’s not just that. If you recognise the magic, sometimes you can figure out how to dismantle it without understanding the mechanics. It’s riskier if you think you’re sure about the nature of something, but it’s not what you think."
Harry's eyes were burning and his cheeks wet by the time he closed the book. He tried to let the feeling wash over him. It was silly for a grown man to cry over a grandmother he had never met. And yet, it took a long time for the tears to stop coming.
"I learned what I know. You just are who you are." Draco ran one possessive hand down Harry's back before slipping something cold into his pocket. "Keep the necklace. It looks good on you."
. His magic fills every corner so perfectly, it’s almost as if he’s never left, and the low hum of magic and presence suffusing around him is enough to leave Draco breathless and at a loss for words.
Draco doesn’t think twice, taking Harry’s hands in his own. He sighs heavily, skin prickling with the contact.
"Jazz says it’ll take seven hours by aeroplane to get to his grandmother’s house this summer. And Kola said when his sister went to Lagos it was six hours. But that’s silly if you can take a Portkey."
“You never had me. But I want to be here with you now, and you’re too afraid to see it. To accept it. You realise you’re trying to hold on to something that isn’t there anymore, don’t you?” Harry sighs heavily. “My memories might be gone, but I love you now.”
The bond, when it sparks to life again, is almost imperceptible. It’s nothing but a sting on his chest, a tingle on his hands.
The hurtful growl Harry lets out has Draco on his feet, casting diagnostic charms with quivering fingers. “It’s okay. I’m here,” he whispers, not sure himself of the veracity of the words. He holds Harry close, eyes focusing on the tendrils of magic floating around them. There’s nothing wrong with Harry. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with him. Why can’t his diagnostics detect anything? Draco bites his lower lip, nose shoved against Harry’s hair and thankful that Harry can’t see the tears damping his cheeks. “You will be okay, love. There will be no pain soon.”
His mouth opened but nothing came out. Harry didn't like this feeling like he had been crumpled up. They both put their mugs down.
sounds so sweet in Harry’s voice, Draco doesn’t even have it in him to argue that he most likely won’t have time to rest.
"You’re welcome," Draco said. "It was…fun." The inflection on the last word made him sound unsure. There wasn't much Harry could say to that. Harry left to make dinner, then spent time stretching and going over the game. Losing the game felt far less personal.
“Not any I’ve tried, at least,” Harry says, making a face. “Hermione made me taste her entire collection. I think she has at least fifty different teas stocked there.”
She had never reacted to Harry’s surprise visits like this before. Maybe she had a guest, which might explain the car in the drive.
Harry’s fingers are warm and firm, roaming the path of the fine lines on Draco’s chest, chasing them as if they’re something beautiful, as if...
I hadn’t realised before how you needed PRTND as much as I did. As we laid on my bed that night, naked and sweaty, too terrified to touch each other but unable to keep the distance, I knew why you felt like hiding.
"You’re winding me up," Harry accused. Draco didn’t even pretend he was doing otherwise. "Don’t use your bedroom voice on my house."
Draco opens his eyes to the bright sunlight streaming through the cracks in the closed curtain, and the loud bangs on his door. His mind draws a blank, before the last minutes—or hours, possibly—come flooding back into his head.
She casts first to third year’s spells deftly, though she seems exhausted when they reach some more complex wand work. Draco tells her to rest. Even though Elle seems eager to go out, he informs her she’ll stay a couple of more days at St Mungo’s in observation.
"Here again?" Pansy asked, scrunching up her face. She looked far less like a femme fatale in the off-season. She was wearing flat shoes, a blue sundress, and her lipstick was a soft muted pink instead of its usual blood red.
“He’s experiencing paralysis. His cognitive functions are minimal.” She eyes Draco warily before turning back to her patient.
“Harry thought a lot about the divorce, you know.” Hermione tries to soothe him when she drags Draco out of St Mungo’s for lunch the day that second article is out.
“Do you like it?” Draco asks, when they come back to the living room. It’s one of the most spacious rooms, with a fireplace sticking out from one wall. He knows the answer, but he still wants to hear it.
Harry huffs. "Merlin, you can’t even have lunch in peace." He sounds annoyed, but he takes one cup of coffee and hands it to Pansy. "How is Hermione, by the way?" Harry asks playfully and watches as Pansy’s pale cheeks turn a shade redder.
, Celtic ancestry,” Draco tells her. “The ancient magic and rituals are still practiced to this day.”
His feet drag him before he thinks about it, before he considers the implications of what’s happening.
Harry opens his mouth to answer, certainly something dirty if his smirk is something to go by. He's interrupted by someone bustling down the door.
“Okay…” Draco’s voice drags a bit, but he doesn’t push the topic. Instead, he lifts the recipe book higher. “Well, I’m going to cook us lunch,” he announces.
Refusing to become involved in the Ministry beyond the war trials had given most people the impression that Harry was nothing special. He was not a rallying point. He liked it better that way.
The Mediwitch flinches back, taking in their situation, and hurries out of there with an apologetic squeak.
Harry isn’t swayed so easily. His words, though bringing a pang of loss to Draco, are strong. “If I had a chance to talk to my parents, even for a second, I’d take it without thinking.”
Draco finds out all sorts of things from Harry, and it’s a fresh feeling to be getting the news of his life from the source himself rather than from a third-party. He discovers Harry’s convinced Hermione and Pansy to let him live alone again and when he confronts Harry with both eyebrows raised and a “I can’t picture Hermione letting you out of her sight,” Harry only shrugs ruefully.
"Apparently, I was completely deluded about your attractiveness at the time so it doesn’t count." Harry felt his face get a little hot with that confession.
Harry felt the front door shut faintly in his mind. There was no good night from Draco. What did that mean? Pansy interrupted his thoughts again.
"It’s really not. But half the League still has very outdated morality clauses as part of their contracts. It is mostly enforced against queer players. Even now, if you’re in a good club, you might be safer if you can avoid being traded. But if not, they can fire you and a lot of other teams won’t touch you. It can end your career. Most people retire and then come out."
Draco is very aware of what he will find, and he doesn’t need more pity. Moreover, his friends and family (the word feels good, though he doesn’t believe it entirely) know how to reach him, so there was really no need to read stranger’s letters.
will never give him what he needs. It will never be for him what he hoped, but Draco can still fight, and try. He may not be able to save himself, but he’ll do everything he can to save Harry and Elle Carrey.
"Gregory, pour the white will you, my love?" Blaise said. Greg walked over and started pouring wine in glasses. They were all softer with him, and Harry filed that observation away for later. It was clearly something that they did not speak about. Greg handed Harry a glass without looking him in the eye, and Harry raised it in thanks.
“Oh, my God. Thank fuck,” Draco sighs, trembling slightly in Harry’s hold. He blindly fumbles around, finding Harry’s face and cupping it in his hands. “You’re awake.”
He glances over to the pile of books about magical core and curses on his table, and at the note again.
In the end, their party gathered at least 200 guests—most of whom were Weasleys from all over the world. It was displayed in all the papers the next morning, but Draco and Harry were far away on their honeymoon, too busy with each other to be bothered about the press' conspiracies about Draco using a love potion on Harry.
Draco takes a deep breath and remembers once again he doesn’t breathe. “Me and Pansy devised a way to bring me back after a few minutes. Enough time to come to you. I knew I’d find you, because I… Harry, I bonded our souls together to find you, and keep you with me.” He presses Harry’s fingers. “My time here is limited. Pansy gave me ten minutes. And Harry… You’re coming back when I am.”
Draco stares at the picture hanging over the mantel. Past-Harry and Past-Draco glance at each other with an affable grin, completely unaware of the photographer stalking them. He had grown to like that photo over the years, after Harry insisted on having it for everyone to see. Now he looks at it, and he can’t remember the happiness he’d felt when he and Harry finally said, “Yes.” Draco remembers hurting and arguing and this is the last thing of his old life that he’s letting go of.
It was nice seeing Draco, Harry had said, and it keeps ringing in Draco’s head all the way to his home. He can’t stop smiling.
"Why would you sneak up on a trained Curse-Breaker?" Draco shouted, lowering his wand at once. "Do you have a death wish?"
"Fill out the form then, Mr Potter." Blaise’s smile was so false it hurt Harry’s teeth. Honestly, you sleep with someone a couple times, and then they fuck you around for the next half decade.
"Thank Merlin. He’s at least decent," Ron said. He had a streak of flour smudging his cheek. Ron disliked Oliver on his behalf because he knew Harry could never bring himself to. That was the trouble with complaining to your friends about exes.
“Oh, hey, Malfoy,” Harry says, not sounding surprised, although his magic can’t stop spinning around them. “I didn’t know you were back to work.”
"Hardly. I'm asking you, a dear friend, to pop over to the shop for some biscuits while I attempt to remember something useful. You had said you wanted to stay friends."
Despite Harry’s reluctance, he accepts Draco’s advice to drop out of college. Given the way he’s been missing classes, he won’t get far, though it’s hard to admit how hard things have become that Harry can’t… live his life like he used to.
fly like that again. I’m serious," Draco said, punctuating his breathless words with kisses to Harry's damp temple and hair soaked in sweat. "I almost jumped onto the pitch, what the fuck was that?" Another kiss. Later, Draco would say he had seen the photographers for the
“Let me finish. You’re a significant part of my decision, clearly, yes. But I was already leaning towards it. This way, I’ll kill two birds with one stone. I can research your curse, and work with something I like.” When Harry remains unconvinced, Draco adds, “This is what I want to do, Harry. Do you trust me?”
"The Potter estate was sold in February 1980, and didn’t include any contents in the sale. All of the items in the house should have reverted to the family vault. If it made it to Gringotts, there would be a record here. There’s nowhere near the amount of possessions you should have."
They spent most of the time in the new parlour, but, as Draco left that day, he turned back and looked at Harry very intently. "Many happy returns."
him. Draco sits as still as he possibly can, but his hands are shaking where they rest on his knees, and he’s sure his heart is about to burst out of his chest and walk right out of the room. He can’t do this, he can’t look at the boy he might have hurt the most—or tried to.
"I don’t know whether that counts as Muggle or Wizarding, so I’m going to decline to light up my drug tests and find out."
Harry pulls away again, green eyes blinking at him. His grin is blinding. It shines in the dimness of their room. He leans over Draco, and when their lips brush, the bond thrums under their skin.
“Thank you,” Draco says, not stepping out of Marvin’s embrace by sheer force of will. He’s never been one to avoid contact, and he doesn’t know why this feels weird now.
There was always one last good match in the autumn before the weather turned permanently gloomy and cold. Overcast, a little windy but clear visibility. The match against Puddlemere was going to be it.
And it’s not that Draco didn’t hear the first time she called, he just can’t find his words anymore.
“I don’t need babysitting,” Harry grumbles, tone childish, arms crossed in front of his chest. His moods have been swinging wildly the past month and Draco can’t,
“You’re off, Draco” she’s saying, but her tone is soft and she loosens her grip on him. “You should take a couple of weeks off.”
"One of my coworkers is from Mexico, and he said his family back home listens to the Championship Quidditch team matches early on Saturday mornings," Bill said.
“This is a relatively small ward,” she says dryly, as long fingers rest on Draco’s shoulders, pinning him to the spot. “Tell me, how have I not seen you in days, Healer Potter?”
Harry tried to be a buffer between the rest of the Weasleys and Pansy, who they treated as something halfway in between a curiosity and an alarming phenomena now that most of the outright hostility had lapsed.
Ignoring what happened and pretending he is fine in front of his friends works perfectly well for an hour as he quietly digs into his caesar salad. That is, until the letter from his lawyer arrives with questions Draco can’t answer—
"Maybe," Harry conceded. He thought of Draco's mouth curving into a smile when he couldn't help but show how pleased he was at being clever. He wasn't even thinking of sex.
"No, I sold some of them. There was more than I could ever need, even if he meant it as an insult. The dangerous ones I send to other Curse-Breakers so they can train their apprentices."
"Can you reach like you’re about to get the Snitch? A little further, chin up. Wonderful!" Toni looked happy for the first time during the photoshoot.
“You opened my Floo,” he mutters, following suit and pushing a chair to the corner of the table, far from his friends. None of them try to reach closer.
Harry doesn’t come to St Mungo’s every day, but he comes often enough that the bond will sense his presence in the building moments before he tracks Draco down. Draco starts
So, now, arson seemed like his best bet to deal with it. He hadn’t quite figured out how he would explain it to Coach Raul or his agent Barb, but he could figure that out when he went home to Falmouth.
Elle stares at him, eyes wet, a grin so bright it reaches her ears. “It worked. That’s all that matters.”
He chances the first step towards the beach, figuring it might be better to be there than in the cabin in the middle of the sea, though neither option seems auspicious.
It occurred to Harry while flying at training the next day that it might not have been the house he wanted to say he loved.
"Yeah. What’s with the outfit?" Harry shot back. He dropped his gym bag onto the floor and kicked it under his bed.
Elle doesn’t stop walking, but her eyes are on Draco now. “I don’t know. I just do. I woke up here after I died and waited. I kind of knew somehow that you’d show up, eventually.”
"I’m saying this as your friend, not your Captain. It's not easy. I know," Harry said. She bent over her broom, braids shadowing her face, and straightened the twigs in the tail by hand. No response.
He returned home happy with his progress on climbing speed. He couldn't do too much training for new techniques on a shared pitch.
No one had the upper hand here. Harry wanted to argue he only had five good years of playing left, seven if he was lucky. He wanted to be braver than caring about this but he wasn’t. It reminded him of before. He never wanted to return to before. Harry could see the future close and far away at the same time. For the first time, he wasn’t sure what he wanted it to look like.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione began, dropping her hands on the table, but she didn’t reach for me. “It changes nothing. We’re your best friends, we just want you to be happy, and that’ll never change.”
There used to be a quietness about Harry that Draco doesn’t see in him anymore. This man in front of him is made of frantic energy, feet always tapping the floor, fingers constantly moving over the tabletop, either grabbing his cup, or sugar packs, or toying with the napkin, and eyes casting everywhere, searching for a way out. His magic fills up the space with charged energy, hot and tantalising. He’s so alive.
"Understandable. Sometimes things have too much history to bear. It's your choice. We could store it or sell it if you wanted."
"Good for you for getting someone in. When my grandfather tried to renovate their Melbourne house by himself to save money, the house went into a sulk, and all the wards fell apart. My grandmother brings it up every single time they’ve an argument," Min-woo said.
"I appreciated it. My apology wouldn't have been very good then. I hadn't fully understood what I was sorry for. In any case, you treated me neutrally, so the other players and staff took your lead."
Everybody knows about the Tree of Life growing in Hogwarts. It’s more of a myth these days, for only a few people have seen it and lived to report the fact, so deep it is in the forest on the school’s grounds. But Draco, as someone who grew up with a Tree of Life in his own family, knows it best to dismiss the tales as prevarications.
Draco’s laugh escapes his lips before he can hold it back. This is surely not the thing he would’ve expected Harry to ask. Although his mind wanders to the tattoo he’s committed to his memory, and his fingers move lightly in the air, tracing the shape of the edge of the waves Harry displays on his hip. The memory is nothing but bittersweet.
Draco can relate to that, even if he doesn’t see this place for what it truly is. They’re not alone, but it feels… calm. But suffocating at the same time. He never knew those things about Harry, and an emotion that feels suspiciously like hurt threatens to dominate the happiness he feels being with him again.
Draco pulls away, gasping, and places his trembling hands on Harry’s chest, keeping him at a short distance.
Harry’s magic is gentle and calling for him. It’s been calling for him since the first session Harry attended. Draco doesn’t think too much about this. He just dives in, heart in his throat and mouth urging for the contact.
"I understand that," Draco said. "I still don't like it. You don't see me groping Theo in public, although I can start if that's how we are greeting our friends now."
Draco agreed. Harry put on Ella Fitzgerald and turned it up until it could be heard from downstairs. Draco was lost in his own thoughts, so Harry let Ella’s voice carry the silence. Over chicken pesto, Harry gathered the courage to ask.
“Well,” Blaise begins, shaking away his alarm. “Remember when Theo ran from Snape second year and got lost in the Forbidden Forest? He was always saying the tree helped him. Now we know his tales were true.” He snorts, adding, “I’ve always believed him, obviously.”
"Summons. My mother has commanded me to come to dinner and explain myself." Draco crumpled the parchment. His breath was shaky and uneven.
They keep staring at each other for what seems a long time, Draco’s eyes completely enthralled and locked with Harry’s. Elle’s harrumph brings him back to the actual reason for him being here, and Draco rushes to cast the diagnostic spells on her.
“I’m afraid.” I turned around, leaning my head against her chest. Luna’s hand came to rest at the small of my back. “What if I don’t know what I want? What I am.”
No matter how angry, miserable, or hopeless Draco was when he pictured Harry, he saw love. Not a single one of those exchanges his mind provided ended with an outburst of energy that threw Draco to the other side of the room. None of his hopeful dreams ended with his back slamming against the wall, pain shooting through his spine, the words slipping from his grasp—with
Giving up trying to control his blush, Draco grins. “Thank you.” He has half a mind to say it’s their song. Or, it used to be. But he figures it won’t have the same appeal to Harry now as it used to have.
Still feeling exposed and weakened by their last reunion, Draco remains quiet in his chair. His eyes don’t seek Potter’s and he tries to concentrate on what everybody’s saying this time, rather than thinking about how much he wants to run away.
Harry sustained a nasty hit from a Bludger in the next match against Ballycastle, and they lost. He returned home, bracing himself to push the heavy door open before it swung to greet him. A large healing salve working slowly on his shoulder, wrapped up tight by a team Healer. He was holding himself stiffly to avoid jostling anything and grabbed a note off the bannister. He had half-hoped Draco was still around.
“Mom misses you too, you know,” Ron confessed after the conversation — awkward enough after a few months — had descended to a silence.
Harry waited for Draco to continue. After a moment, Draco said, "There are two reasons I can think of. One is that I did it through inaction, and I did it selfishly. I wasn’t thinking of you, I was thinking of myself. The other is that we would both have to know that I was saving your life. I wasn’t sure of what I was doing."
"Even if it’s not the way you wanted it to, it usually does." Ron sounded wise for someone their age. He looked at Harry knowingly, though he didn’t press.
“Track?” he asks absently, trying and almost failing to tap into the bond once again. A faint response comes through it, filled with dread and hurt. And the void grows steadier, deeper.
There were fewer days when Draco was fixing anything in the house. With great reluctance, Harry gave in to the final house checkup.
Not that he doesn’t want it to. He’d give anything to hear Harry calling him again, even if he keeps up calling Draco by his last name.
He almost lets it tumble out of his lips, but instead, scoots closer to Harry, hand hot on his forearm, just as Hugh Grant is asking Ms. Scott the circumstances regarding her friendship with the ‘young English guy’ in her last interview.
He passed his gym and peered into the dining room, noting that Draco had found a way around the spells on the rest of the chest somehow because everything had been put on shelves. Up the stairs, Harry opened his door and frowned. He would have sworn his room was smaller. Waddling sideways between the bed and the wall type of small. Now it was larger, enough that he could have moved the piano beside the bed and still had room to swing a Kneazle. A new door revealed he now had the refurbished bathroom as his ensuite, clawfoot tub and all.
Draco freezes to the spot. Luna pins him to his chair with a grin. “What do you think he comes so often for, Draco?” she asks softly.
. He brings Harry’s fingers to his face, leans a cheek against the warm palm. Harry doesn’t pull away and when Draco looks at him again, Harry’s smiling.
Unlike most teams, Falcons had a full complement of alternates. Coach wasn’t well known for making substitutions unless someone was injured, so most of them didn’t play very often. But Harry always tried to keep good rapport. Anyone could move from first to second string or back at any time, injuries could happen, and it was no use being Captain if half the team ignored or hated him.
He relished the shock of the icy dew on his bare toes and ankles as he leapt about, waving a twig like a wand and imagining that the tendrils of swirling fog were traces of spells he cast across the warming fields of Wiltshire. He dueled spectres in the vapor rising from the damp grass, vanquished foes that lurked behind bushes and trees, and bowed before kings and queens grateful for his valiant service to their empires.
Harry wasn’t going to go to Ron, because he wouldn’t understand, and Hermione would, but she’d disapprove. There was no telling one without the other and neither of them were good with Harry when he was indecisive. Neville would know he’d been right about Harry before even Harry knew he was right, and he couldn’t take that. Astoria was Draco's friend. There was no saying how Oliver would react. Stella might laugh in his face. Ginny would definitely laugh in his face. Although Luna knew Draco, Harry was not interested in replicating anything that had led to the Luna and Ginny Rooftop Declaration of 2007. That left one friend.
Draco knows nothing of the sort, but he accepts the compliment with flushed cheeks and a hasty, “I’m just doing what I’m paid to do.”
They ended up in the private dining room of a place called Cloaks in the Muggle part of Camden around ten-thirty. Harry thought it was rather stupid to name a restaurant the way you would name a tailor, but no one had asked him. It was decorated to look like someone’s parlour, with shelves of old Muggle books, antique clocks, and soft blue willow patterned carpet underfoot. Instead of bar stools, their room was filled with an array of velvet armchairs with a low, polished marble table with space for a dozen. Harry hated pretentious rubbish like that. Draco probably loved it.
It had been the perfect wedding and if Draco closes his eyes, he can still capture the scent of roses and rosemary spreading in the air, stronger each time someone moved around or trailed their fingers along the leaves.
selling many things you could imagine and some you wouldn’t. Quite lucrative, apparently. Here is a preliminary list with the last known whereabouts. Anyone with a tick, I’ve already contacted as I focused on furnishings."
"You don't sleep in the master bedroom," Draco said. It was a statement, not a question. Harry shrugged. It was clean, there were deep gouges in the hardwood from Buckbeak, and on occasion it had been occupied when the house was full of Order members, but Molly seemed to sense that stirring up memories of Sirius' parents was not a good idea. Harry felt uneasy about it.
"Nothing for you to sign, no. Let me make a call though, let me book us somewhere for lunch, and I’ll figure something for you to do for the afternoon."
Hermione let the subject of Draco Malfoy drop, which made Harry suspicious, but he chalked it up to enthusiasm for her work.
“I’m just a bit surprised you know how to…” Harry squints at the instructions Draco’s pinned to the board, voice filled with mirth. “Er, ‘pilot’ a washing machine and control the ‘people-eating box’. I’m assuming that’s a TV. If it’s not, I’m going to be worried about your house.”
“To be better. I’m trying, and I want them to see it.” Draco’s voice is small. “I’m afraid it’ll happen again.”
Harry takes a few months to travel around the world. This time, however, Draco takes time off from work and joins him.
Harry. It’s you. It’s really you,” he cries, but no tears escape his eyes as his fingers trace every line of his lover’s vacant expression. What’s happened to him?
In the kitchen, Draco brought out a little tan briefcase. Harry was almost certain it was Muggle in origin even if magically altered. Draco reached in and pulled out a tome so large, Harry was sure its binding must have been enchanted.
"Thank you so much for having me here. This award goes to the most innovative and promising Seeker in the Junior Leagues…"
it had been spontaneous, and they ended up hanging it for everyone to see. It was taken on their wedding day, and it had been completely still since the morning Harry didn’t wake up again. Now, though, it moved again, slowly, as if waking up under Harry’s stare. Draco glances at both, marvelling at how the house he had thought so absent of magic, so ordinary and Muggle, recognises Harry.
Harry thought Percy before the war as stuffy and boring. Percy after the war had a glint in his eye, like his restraint was covering for something far more dangerous. There was a time Harry would have bet against Percy. But Harry believed now Percy would throw a punch if he thought that was the only thing George would understand.
"What would you call it if I care a lot about everything I do?" Harry asked. He wasn't willing to give Lee a pat answer, friend or not.
Draco tries to prise Harry off the bed to eat something, but he drops into a serene sleep and doesn't wake again until the next morning. This time, when Draco opens his eyes, he’s met with two bright green eyes staring at him.
and Draco has no idea why he won’t call it for what it is, like normal people: a piece of sticky paper—glued to Harry’s favourite bright red mug. Harry had to be coaxed into starting school, even if he was the one who had the idea in the first place. In the end, what had him convinced was that he could drop out at any moment in case he didn’t like it (Draco thought that was unlikely to happen). But it’s not like he had anything to lose. And despite Harry’s reserved demeanour, and the fact that he rarely talks about it spontaneously, Draco’s sure he’s loving it.
Now he could see clearly. The hesitation shouldn’t happen again. In general, Harry needed to rely on Stella more for all the central play, and they needed to stop looking at goal spreads for optimum Snitch-seeking, because their ranking was fine. At this point, they needed to maybe let the ranking go to number two if it was that dependent on ruining the rest of their play.
The drawers go first, one by one, turning over, crashing. The empty ones first, and then his own clothes are scattered around the floor.
Pansy’s last sentence still rings in his ear, as he stares blankly at the letter—some update on Carrey's condition. Despite the overload of work, his friend has taken most of Draco’s patients since the start of his time off.
Harry swallowed heavily, feeling foolish for falling into the memory. It had been a windy, bitter day, and a miserable match they’d lost against the Arrows. Despite that, it was one of the best days of his life. "Many of the kids had been told that, if they came out, they would never be accepted. And there I was."
The knot in his throat only seems to tighten with each word he gets out. He gulps it down, trying to rein in the desperation mauling his insides.
“I have to go, anyway. It was nice seeing you,” he blurts and scurries off the corridor, disappearing again before Draco has the chance to reply.
Today would be a good day to go to Cardiff again. Apparating and the Floo were out of the question with his shoulder, so Harry took some Muggle money and made his way to Paddington to fork over the extra for a last minute train to Cardiff. The cityscape rolled its way into countryside and back again. No one paid Harry any mind this late November morning, in his train car filled with Muggle businesspeople who weren’t looking out the window at all.
Hermione and Ron knew nothing about Wizarding signet rings other than the one that had been a Horcrux. Harry resorted to asking Millicent Bulstrode, though he usually only spoke to her about contracts he signed. She answered his firecall, but she seemed taken aback that Harry was asking her about pure-blood traditions.
Elle lies still on the bed, eyes closed, features creased in pain. She moans and murmurs quiet words that Draco can’t comprehend.
He rises minutely from his chair. He can make it to the door; he’s always been fast. Except that Potter has taken the spot closest to the exit. And then Marvin’s thundering voice resounds in the space and he’s forced to sit back again, unable to think of a single excuse to leave early.
“Oh, in your travels? Is this an actual place?” Draco remembers how fondly Harry talked about the couple of years he spent travelling right after the war. Harry always kept private about most of what happened during that time. He offered some bits and pieces of it occasionally, and Draco didn’t ask for more than Harry was willing to give him freely.
"She's around that age. You remember Ted at five? This was when he would mimic people’s faces and follow them down the aisles when we went shopping. Kids are strange."
The contact happens so slowly, Draco holds his breath when the tip of Harry’s fingers finally brush his skin. The touch feels insufficient; he needs more.
"Yeah. I understand if you don’t want to be there while he’s there." Harry laughed. "It makes me uncomfortable sometimes too," Harry confided.
, and I just couldn’t keep staring at them. People rarely noticed I didn’t stare them directly in the eyes, as long as I kept mine somewhere on their face. But as much as I
Draco should be accustomed to feeling like dying. Like the air he breathes isn’t enough, and he’s drowning in himself. He’s been living like this for too long, before Harry found out about the bond and stopped talking to him.
Draco touches his face softly, the tips of his fingers taking in what he can of Harry’s almost immaterial skin. “If you were so happy there, why did you come back?”
"We can sell some of these, right?" He was interested in vintage Snitch (several, James Potter), and even the handwoven Potter family map. He was not interested in teeth (mostly creature, assorted).
“For me, it was me dad. Owed the family--” he gestured up toward the large mansion on the property “--loads of money. AKd him right ‘ere,” he pressed the pad of one finger right between Draco’s eyebrows. “Right in front of me and me mum. S’why I’m here, workin’ off the debt ‘n all. So, who was it for you? Dad? Mum? A cousin, maybe?”
Draco grins, patting Harry’s shoulder condescendingly. “There, there, Harry. We all know you’ve hit the jackpot with me.”
Even on his worst days, he rises with the sun. He feels protective of--and protected by--those still, silent moments before the rest of the world wakes. He knows, better than most, that time has no morality--the dead of night is not inherently evil, and midday is not good by default. The arrival of dawn does not erase sins committed in darkness, and the setting sun does not eclipse daylight’s good deeds.
"Is it stupid that I want it to stay the same?" Harry asked, his voice soft. The idea of letting anyone even sleep in that room made him heartsick. But Harry couldn’t live in a memorial garden, a house preserved in amber. This house had been left a poorly kept museum for long enough.
Draco frowns, face creased in a grimace much like Harry’s. “You think I like that, Potter? To watch you slipping away like this? I only want to make sure you’re safe when I’m not here.”
We had changed little, but I was both leaner and taller, and she was shorter than me now, her red glossy hair a lot shorter, in a way that reminded me too much of Ginny.
Elle’s right there, in front of him. She looks younger than he’s ever seen her. Silky hair falls on her shoulders in even waves. The grin she gives him is gentle.
"I’m sorry." Drying tear trails ran to her chin and her nose ran all over Harry’s arm even as she swiped at it with the back of her hand. Everyone else had their backs turned as a courtesy. They had all been the person to cry in the locker room after a match.
Harry could already feel a light twinge in his lower back. He was a little cold without the covers he'd kicked off the bed, and there was a stubborn wet spot. Still, he held Draco. Draco seemed to feel no more awkward about post-sex nudity than anything else they did together.
Harry had forgotten to put his broom back on the rack, so he grabbed it and went to the empty broom closet. All Harry caught was a glimpse. Atty was on top of Luc. They were kissing naked to the waist. Harry backed up and closed the door, rubbing his hand over his face. He had not expected to see
Mother’s grin becomes wider as she stares at their interlaced fingers. Her voice is only a whisper. “You have always desired to be a Healer, since you were a little boy. I’m proud of you.”
It’s better than the method Harry’s using to kill him, he thinks. At least drinking coffee doesn’t hurt as much.
The car ride was short and silent. Harry had never imagined that Draco lived anywhere but London. They pulled into a beautiful deep red brick block of flats beyond a warding spell. Harry climbed out of the car and followed Draco up the stairs and into flat five.
It turns out, beef bourguignon tastes terrible after it’s cold, but it’s Draco’s fault for forgetting to set a stasis spell on it before fucking Harry against the table. They don’t seem to mind that at all.
be attuned to Harry’s emotions all the time, when the slightest slip would mean having him gone, he can’t rest, he can’t stop.
He hears the sharp intake of air by his side, assumes it’s Hermione, but he can’t begin to care. “This means…”
“I do,” Blaise agrees easily, a hand on his chest. “And as far as I’m aware, you, missy, don’t live with your parents anymore either.”
Harry’s so still for so long, Draco has the urge to touch him, to remind him where he is. He tries to, not through physical contact, but he reaches through his magic, he tries to get to him, and desperation flares inside him when Draco is met with almost nothing, an endless void, even when Harry is right here by his side.
That was almost a compliment. Harry waved it off and poured them both another glass. Draco’s mouth was stained red.
face. Silky silver hair framed your pointy features, shorter than I had seen at PRTND. Your lips were thin, like on the first night, and I took relief in that, even though you looked slimmer and
It was a good remembrance, not like those after the war, abstract, meaningless. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted what they gave him anyway, a hero’s burial with a traditional pyre and a medal like all the Order fallen. Even here, a house he had hated, contained more of Sirius than the belated pardon from the Ministry that described a man Harry didn’t recognise or his grave marker in Godric’s Hollow. Sirius’ presence was here in the study with Harry, when Harry was lying on the floor, listening to records and trying to decide whether he liked them too. Sirius was always with Harry when Harry remembered to take photos and kept them even when they were blurry.
Draco was still cold, and a bit reserved; there was no expectation there would be a return of the old ease that had been there, but it was a start.
Harry was sure Draco was far more familiar with whatever successor to Borgin and Burkes bought teeth, so he shrugged.
"Nice try," Harry said. He put the pack in his jeans pocket. They left the house still bickering about what Muggle restaurant to eat at.
Harry averts his gaze back to his coffee and takes a deep breath. “I’m recovering fine, all things considered,” he states in a monotone, nothing like the words full of emotion and doubt from seconds before. “I exercise at least three hours a day, it helps control my body and my magic. I have to eat healthy or my stomach won’t be happy. And although I can’t sleep most nights, Sleeping Draughts don’t react well with my curse.” Harry lists these things as if he’s talking to his healer, but in a way, Draco is exactly that. He doesn’t mind if that’s how Harry feels most comfortable talking. At least Harry isn’t shooting daggers at him.
You dropped your hand and remained just standing in front of me in silence for a few moments. I took it between my fingers, pressing them against my digits, head resting on your shoulder. Only then, your fingers came to touch me, intertwining themselves in the hair at the nape of my head, and I let you. Your presence was quiet and calming. It tasted much like recharging, instead of exhausting.
The next morning, he was greeted with a heaving kitchen table after his workout. Buttered multigrain toast, more fruit than even Harry ever ate in a week, spinach omelettes, a whole rasher of bacon, and a pile of still-warm pastries. Harry put his face in his hands. His left ankle was throbbing unhappily, and he missed his cottage where nothing ever changed without his permission.
Marvin receives him with a hug and a bright grin. His smile has the same softness it used to have, despite the crinkles shaping the corner of his lips. His eyes are hidden behind a thick pair of glasses and his hair is covered in a layer of fine grey strands. Draco is satisfied to notice a yellow notebook under his arm as he tries not to let the guilt of disappearing and not getting in touch for so long make way inside him.
That night, Draco is poring over his books when Blaise’s great grey owl pecks his window. He jumps out of his skin once he glimpses the giant animal’s eyes, round and golden and framed by diagonal lines that always give the impression she’s mad about something. Draco’s sure she’s going to give him a heart attack one of these days. But, despite her size and her horrifying glare, he’s never met an owl sweeter than this—which is a bit ridiculous, considering her owner.
"When they disowned me, my father—Lucius told me I could have the jewels. And he would save the houses and the Galleons for when he had a proper heir to give them to. He said that I was no son of his."
Harry has been experimenting with new things, everything he can get his hands—knitting, sculpting, cooking. But he enjoys spending time with children so much that Draco asks him if he ever considered working with them. The answer seems obvious as Harry glances at him and grins.
Why is Harry doing this? Why did Harry kiss him? He can’t look inside the bond for more. He’s afraid of the answers he might find.
Pansy turns off the telly and plops down by his side, almost sitting on his feet before he curls even more into the couch. Maybe he’s becoming one with the furniture. That’s a reassuring thought.
"This clock is your grandfather's," Draco said. "I can’t recall the spell for winding clocks though."
He had never heard about this, about any of this. Draco hasn’t been in Harry’s painting room since the last time Harry was awake. How could he, when it only rubs in his face the fact that he might never see Harry’s skilful fingers drawing again?
When Draco closes the door to Elle’s room and Healer Cameron’s hopeful hand falls on his shoulder, he wishes he could feel more confident. He wishes he knew, for certain, this is truly the right thing to do. He doesn’t. Draco will just have to trust.
"Exercising six hours a day and flying for two is ‘slacking off’?" Draco said, incredulous. "Maybe it’s best I never decided to take up Quidditch."
"I cry over my parents all the time. I wouldn't worry about that," Pansy said. "Are you ready for this?"
This had been Harry’s favourite mug. Draco got it for him as a present, right after he’d started art school. But there’s no point in holding onto Harry’s favourite mug now that Harry’s not here to drink from it, he muses, dropping it on the floor. The ceramic smashes with a muffled sound. A thousand red pieces cover the tiles.
"Yeah, I figured. What's with Miles?" Harry asked. They were walking. From the last time, it seemed unlikely Draco would come home with him, so he wanted to stay out just a little.
"And yourself?" said a third nasal-voiced reporter. He was from a Wireless show called LiveQ that Harry didn't care for. Too much focus on statistics, not enough on the game.
"Not with you in the car, I hope," Harry said, raising an eyebrow. He was certain Andromeda had it covered, but sometimes he wanted to tell Teddy that he cared about him.
Blaise’s and Luna are the exception, as they’re vigorously discussing whether Draco’s and Harry’s flat is infested with Wrackspurts. Draco’s sure Blaise’s participation in the conversation is happening only to indulge Luna—he can never say no to pretty girls.
He ran into Lovegood back then. She had been working as a volunteer at a Community Centre very close to Draco’s new place—a small, dingy flat he now calls home. When she first tried to contact him, he ignored her pleas and hid for a week, terrified of facing his sins again. Not that he had an easier time being a coward on his own.
“I’ll always be with you, Draco. You’ve saved me. Again and again. And I love you. But I know you don’t love me anymore.”
"Thank God you're back. Oliver's fighting with his boyfriend, and he's been a fucking terror," Stella said. Harry was hungover and not in the mood. He hadn’t been hungover in over a year, and he wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that he overindulged to keep Draco with him for the space of a glass of wine longer. Hangover potion purged the nausea but not the exhaustion.
"There was something about being nineteen and having this secret that made me feel grown up. Daniel took me to my first football match. He taught me how to drive. He was…he was…"
Harry’s shoulders were shaking so hard with laughter he thought he was going to cry. Years of putting up with Walburga, and that was all it took. The current Minister of Magic and several top Aurors and Curse-Breakers had examined it, and apparently all Harry would have had to do is ask his thief of a house for help.
Ginny was still easy to be around, and Harry was grateful for that. Even if it meant on occasion, like this evening, Ginny slyly asked, "How is Stella Abidi?"
Harry, taken aback, stares at her with eyes wide and mouth agape. His cheeks are red in a way they only get when he’s too drunk or imploring for Draco to go
Harry goes on, eyes turning more vacant and detached at each word. “And that I testified on your behalf after the war.”
One more flight of stairs. It felt like they should go through every door, so Harry did. He was used to his bedroom by now. Regulus’ bedroom was in cheerful yellow and blue stripes for Teddy, with the former master in a delicate pink with matching duvets as a second guest room. Harry hesitated before Sirius’ bedroom, and it was only Draco’s presence behind him that made him walk in.
"Thank you," Harry said and gulped it down. He didn’t want anything to happen in this state, but he liked the idea of Draco being here in the morning.
"I’ll call you Malfoy if you want, but just Potter or Harry is fine," Harry said. The way Draco said Mr Potter reminded him of Professor McGonagall, and Harry would rather not feel like Draco had caught him doing something naughty every time Draco spoke to him.
Then they were kissing again, with more heat, Draco insistent on rubbing against him through his shorts. Gently at first, and then with a deliberate drag until Harry's voice caught in the back of his throat with a breathy 'ah'.
"If you need a thrill, do normal stuff. Go to a nightclub. Travel. Skydive. Try Muggle drugs. Eat fried food. Party. Spend your time picking up as many lovers of any gender you like. This is a very progressive club in that respect."
Harry hopped on his broom and, with his hands behind his back, did a slow, neat backflip in a tight, perfect circle. "That is more difficult than doing it at speed. If any of you can do that, you can skip the drill."
“Draco,” Harry calls weakly. Draco can’t bring himself to look back and Harry huffs. “You can’t even look at me in the eyes, Malfoy.”
Harry’s anger is like a beacon, pulling Draco in, holding him in place, though he never snaps at Draco. He’s still as guilty as he’d been when he and Draco first met at the Community Centre. But it’s different now, because Harry wants to run, he wants to scream and to be left alone and, in turn, Draco wants to give him everything, to make him know that he’s loved and that he’ll give him space if he needs it. His hands twitch to hold Harry whenever his face falls or his brows furrow in a frown.
"Azkaban isn’t a spa resort, and they took three years to get to his trial," Draco said. "It changed him."
He opens his mouth, closes it again. He forgoes an answer for a question that’s been nagging his brain since... since they stopped talking to each other. “Why didn’t you look for me sooner? It was...”
"The house is yours. But your claim is bound and reinforced by certain ties. The house won’t behave until it’s indisputable, but the house is tied by both magic and wards. With your family’s things, the house will be bound to your family name. With your things, the house will be bound to you."
“You’re not coming back now. I don’t need a healer with his head elsewhere,” she starts, and when she continues her voice is so sweet and sounds so alien coming from her that Draco cringes inwardly, “Draco, I mean it. You haven’t had enough time to process all of it, you need to—”
Elle shrugs, doesn’t look at him, keeping her eyes trained straight ahead. “I don’t know… I guess I was waiting for you.”
Christmas went as it should. Harry stepped out for his annual big shop for the kids in residence at SafeHome off the list Jim gave him. He could send someone else, but there was something about standing in a queue for a stuffed Erumpent and going to his cottage to pick up all the brooms he hadn’t bothered opening that put him in a good mood. He liked buying a laptop for Kwame who wanted to study graphic design and a new set of colouring pencils and a camera for River. He bought gaming systems, shiny cauldrons, miniature indoor fireworks, and rare tropical plants. Harry completed the list over a few days, his heart full.
He tries shaking her. Reviving her with his wand, then with the CPR he still remembers from Muggle med school. His diagnostic spells come back empty. His palms, as they press against Elle’s chest, can find no pulse. Nothing works. And when he implores, “Elle, please,” she doesn’t respond.
Harry looks nice in his kitchen, at ease. More than last night. Though his shoulders remain stiff, his features are more relaxed. Eyes not as perturbed as they’d been the day before.
Harry always comes back and grins at Draco, despite the fact that Draco’s unable to fix him, to make it better. All he’s ever wanted was for Harry to be happy, but now he’s realising he might be the one causing him pain, keeping him locked up in this place, when Harry wishes to escape.
Out of the corner of his eye, he caught Draco hanging back. Pansy whispered something to him, clapped him on the back and strode back into the stadium without another word.
When Potter says he can’t talk to his friends about it, Draco is the one who truly understands why he feels like he needs to hide this disconnected and fearful side of him from the people who expect him to be perfect. When Potter tells the group he is lost, and he can’t bother anyone else with his problems, Draco wants to yell at him to stop being stupid, because he’s sure people would love to help him, and people would be by his side, and he deserves it. More than anyone.
He takes a deep breath, and it seems to spark Potter’s curiosity. Potter crosses his arms tightly over his chest and worries his lower lip while staring at Draco.
Harry was in an old jersey with holes in the collar and shorts so small that he was getting side-long appreciative glances from Draco. He couldn’t be bothered to dress himself to his usual standards when he was this sore from practice. Everything in his body ached from Spring training.
They accept the suggestion easily and Draco is left alone in the kitchen, eyes narrowed and mind racing with a million questions. The most important of them, though, should he cook for more people?
Pansy was so still it was like a stunning spell had struck her. Harry opened his mouth to search for words to placate everyone, but Percy beat him to it.
"I know this one! Andromeda sings it sometimes." Draco sang the next words. He wasn't good, but it was charming. Harry had never dreamed of Draco singing along to Fleetwood Mac. This was the worst idea Harry had ever had, and it was going to kill him. Harry turned away to hide his face, pretending to look for another record.
At first, excitement took over me at first. But then, as per usual, I was losing my cool again — not that I ever had it, of course. But freaking out had become such a natural part of my life, of my
Hermione stiffens, her eyes two heavy stones staring at him sternly. “You should consider yourself lucky we haven’t reported you because of  what you pulled. It was hard keeping it a secret, but Harry insisted nothing happened to you. That he was fine with it.” She frowns, and something different flickers across her face. Betrayal, Draco recognises it. “What were you thinking, Draco?” At his loss for words, she continues with a huff. “It doesn’t… I can’t track him. Harry’s nowhere. It’s like… It’s like he disappeared. You can find him with the bond, can't you?”
The first time he gets a note from Harry is five months after they had moved in together. It’s a little yellow square—Harry called it
, he had argued, and when Harry prompted him to fix it instead, Draco had raised an eyebrow and huffed vexedly. It’s beyond him how Harry manages to break so many things, but he can forgive it, only because those fingers are also very proficient in different—and more... organic—tasks.
, Draco thinks, locking their lips together. His are trembling and weak against Harry’s, but he can’t begin to care about his display of vulnerability.
"I don’t think you’ll like any of it," Harry said, though he didn’t really care if Draco hated it. This was his.
It was easy to forget that Draco was…well Draco, when he wasn’t seeing him in person, just through notes. Draco stood by the door. His navy fisherman knit jumper was oversized and had slipped down one shoulder. He was wearing jeans and barefoot. Harry got the feeling he was in trouble, but he wasn’t sure why.
The alley he Apparates to in Islington is small and dark. The walk to The Red Hart is short, but filled with imaginative scenarios of the
Draco had meant to ask if Harry should still smoke. But he was under the impression that isn’t something Harry would appreciate to be chided for.
Harry huffs a quiet laugh, raking a hand through his hair. “Honestly, this bond thing is an inconvenience. I can’t be mad at you for long, when I
It was only fair to let Draco have some time away from him. Draco didn't show up to Harry's matches. He was never in the players’ family tent afterwards. Harry thought he caught glimpses of him high up in the stands out of the corner of his eye, but whenever he turned around, there was no Draco. He nearly took a Bludger to the knee against Wimbourne before he quit looking.
So when Luna dropped by with her camera, Harry remembered to crouch down and pretend to be on a secret mission with Teddy, who turned his hair green so he could blend in with the grass. The mission was successful and, with a permissive wink from Andromeda, Harry was able to recover the extra trifle that was marked special for Teddy. Harry let Teddy eat most of the one "for Harry" too.
Draco flicks his short hair away from his face, but his reflection sneers back at him, much like his sixteen-year-old self. The last thing he needs is one more thing reminding Harry why he hates Draco. Long fingers mess up the platinum strands, but it still feels weird. Nothing looks right, he doesn’t look right. Hell, he doesn’t even
"Do you want to meet the team today? I think you saw most of them at camp, but…" Harry trailed off. Teddy, who played it fairly cool most of the time, lit up at the prospect.
"Sometimes I wish…" Harry trailed off, not sure how to articulate how he felt knowing her attention was on him, but she was also watching Luna as she bent and picked up Victoire.
“Everything is going to be perfect now, darling, I promise. I’ll take care of you.” His fingers rake over Harry’s fringe, shoving it away from his face—Draco has ensured that Harry had the same care for his appearance as he’s had for years.
Elle snaps her head to the side, apparently only now noticing a third person there. And then, back to Draco, eyes wide and mouth agape, when the realisation that there’s no pain seems to dawn on her.
"Well Teddy, I think it’s almost time for us to go," Andromeda warned as players started packing their bags and heading to the stadium Floo, down the long hallways.
Draco was accustomed to being one of those too. Harry had said, when they married, that Draco was marrying his entire family, and despite Draco’s initial reservations, he soon opened up to the Weasleys and their open and affectionate ways.
It keeps beating, though, faster each time. When Harry laughs, or when he looks distant, or when his brows furrow in a frown whenever Draco tells him something new about his past.
They don’t stick around for long after they have dinner. Once they’re all lazily sprawled on the couch and floor, they soon realise no more work will be done and make themselves scarce. Luna and Pansy kiss each of their cheeks, Blaise gives them a hug, and Granger is carrying too many borrowed books—half in her arms and half filling up her handbag—looking too disturbingly frazzled to be concerned about goodbyes.
"It doesn’t have to stay the same. I want…I want to put up some photos he has. And I think I’ll take some of his clothes. We can let some go."
Harry gave hugs to everyone, even to a bemused Arthur, who patted his head. He kissed Hermione’s cheek and teased her about avoiding the wine (out of earshot of Molly, of course). Apparently, the matter of a sibling for Rose was settled. But all Hermione wanted to talk about was new legislation with him and Percy.
rather desperate to meet Harry. To just lay eyes on him again, despite the fact that he can’t touch his tawny-brown skin, his wild black hair, or kiss those full flushed lips.
They lounge quietly on the couch, watching yet another reprise of Notting Hill on the telly, with two dishes of spaghetti au pesto on their laps—Harry’s insistence, or they’d miss the film and apparently he likes it a lot. Draco doesn’t mind too much, mostly because Harry’s warmth by his side is solid and comforting, and his laughter is the most beautiful melody Draco’s ever heard.
He knows all the notes there by heart, having re-read his own and Pansy’s dozens of times in the last few days. But no matter how many times Draco reads them, he can’t come to a solution to her problem.
“You did, but that’s okay, too, if your taste is different now.” Draco shrugs, and then points at Harry’s coffee. “Just go easy on those. I can feel your magic, and it’s still erratic. Too much coffee can...”
Harry committed to memory the slow streak of orange and pink in the fading daylight. George left first, saying he had an early start. Then went Percy, Bill until there were only a few of them left. With the remaining people, Harry enjoyed the warm breeze, the company, and the last couple pints in a row he would likely have for a while.
“You say this because you wanted to bring the dumb girls you pick up without mommy and daddy meddling,” Pansy snorts.
"No gluten, no peanuts. I know, Andromeda," Harry said, although he knew she had to check. She swiped a vial of Teddy’s allergy potion out of her purse, which Harry put it in his pocket. She bent and kissed Teddy on the cheek, and he tolerated it, although he wiped at his face when she had left.
"Twelve. I only play games with three of them, and those three are all custom. I give a lot of brooms away to charity."
Draco flinches back at the Dark Lord’s name, but is immediately by Harry’s side again a second later, cupping his face between shaky hands. “But you’re here.” The affirmative is weak in his lips, but it is true. It has to be. “Why are you telling me this now?”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean it.” Hermione’s tone is low and careful. “I don’t think Harry would try to hurt you on purpose, Draco.”
And when he and Luna sit for tea during their brief break in the hospital cafeteria two days later, Draco tries to convince her, too. She is easily one of the few people in St Mungo’s who’ll talk to Draco—or even glance in his direction—and the first thing Luna asks when they meet on Monday is why he was not at the centre on Saturday.
Draco feels full, and whatever is pressing inside him is too hot and suffocating. Even so, he pulls Harry closer, chin resting on top of his head. “No. Stay.”
Draco doesn’t contain the smile taking over his own expression, and nods. “You might sense some discomfort, due to how long you’ve been paralysed. Your new diet,” he motions to the new assembly of colourful potions by her bedside, “will help you regain muscle strength and make sure your magical core is settled properly back inside you.”
Neville bent over pointing out different ferns. "These are mostly mundane, and if they’ve survived this long, there must be magic managing the moisture levels. Also could use a trim."
It’s not the hole in his chest, it’s nothing but that ugly side of loneliness chiding him for being so subservient, for being so bloody understanding all the time.
"Thank you for today," she said. "It doesn’t seem like it, but Teddy takes cues from you, and Draco’s been a good influence on him."
It was the nicest dinner Harry had with them in a long time because Draco asked interesting questions and in any case, everyone was friendly. Ron leaned in for a hug from Harry. He hesitated for a second and then embraced Draco too, and Draco blushed right up to his roots.
Draco vanishes everything with a swift motion of his wand, and the kitchen descends into an odd silence, devoid of the buzz that had been ringing in his ears for such a long time.
"I don’t have to, I know how it’s going to play out within the first few minutes. It's a pattern," Harry said. He tweaked it and watched their Seeker fly less actively, inch high and circling the posts instead of covering the field. Cho was still off, injured from the Kestrels’ last match. Harry had sent them flowers. Kenmare’s second string Seeker wasn’t nearly as good.
He shouldn’t have feared, though, for the first letter he receives from his mother—once he’s past the initial panic as he clutches the envelope—is warm, and carries a simple apology Draco
Tuesday was the next time Harry and Draco were both free, so he took the coordinates to an Apparition Point in Manchester. Draco was waiting in his car out in front of the tollbooth. Harry had to clear his seat of loose parchment, and dumped them in the backseat where there were even more books and paper.
Harry doesn’t owe Draco anything. And Draco just has to make the best out of this opportunity. He has to show Harry that he’s changed.
The first time Draco sees one of these daunting articles is during the third week after their divorce. Harry’s picture stares at him, the hand of a man the papers couldn’t name around his waist. Draco’s sure this is the day his life ends.
"Go on then," Harry said, after a moment’s silence. "So the house hates me then, is that the theory?"
"My friends know. The papers are always on about something." Harry was dismissive. Maybe, after the season, they could sit down with Barb and figure out something, if Draco wanted to do this long-term.
“I’m so sorry, Harry.” Draco closes his eyes, and the words are out before he can get a hold of them. “Did you… Did you see anybody else?”
that we’re running, not your personal petting zoo. Don’t make me think twice about leaving you in charge of it all one day.”
It’s not the bond flaring—it has gained a subdued quality, staying quiet in a dull manner between them. It’s Harry’s magic spiralling wildly because of Draco’s words.
I didn’t need a mirror to realise I had. I sensed it when my body changed, adapting and settling down on its new skin. And it was comfortable.
. Draco misses this, more than he remembers what it was like living together. Who Harry was when he wasn’t with Draco.
Draco rushes to say, “No, it doesn’t. Go on.” This is a secret only Draco knows, and it would be enough for him to want to hear it. It helps that everything Harry tells him is fascinating.
Harry stood and Draco sat at the piano, but had turned to face him, elbows resting easy on the fall board and legs spread.
Luc dragged his feet walking over and Harry’s face must have been doing something unpleasant because Luc looked nervous. Harry gave him the warning. "She’s already under scrutiny you couldn’t imagine. You better be serious about her. Very. She’s your teammate. You fuck around, I will make you wish you had never set foot on this team."
I stared at you, properly stared into your eyes, worrying my lower lip as you glanced back. I tried, but my
“Hello, Harry. Weasley, Granger.” Your voice echoed, cold and courteous, fingers pointing at their coffees. “Would you like a refill?”
Hermione had tried to put up some resistance, untrusting of Draco. But the gravity of his expression had been enough to stop her when he left.
That fucking drawer full of bathing suits Draco never exhibited on his body, because they never got their Caribbean vacation, only screams to him how Harry always asked him to try them on, again and again, in spite of the fact they were never put to use.
Her condition is aggravated and fed by the sheer amount of power she has. The stronger Elle gets as she grows up, the stronger her curse becomes. Separating this kind of curse from her magical core is dangerous and could cost her magic, or worse, her own life. But living like this is proving to have a similar cost.
He’ll be lying if he says he absolutely didn’t try contacting Harry over the course of those weeks. He’s not, however, remotely reluctant to admit those were not amongst his proudest moments.
Harry shrugs, finally meeting his eyes. “I mentioned it to Pansy, actually, and she told me its name.”
Ron got up on a picnic table to make a speech, and Harry went to stand by in case he fell over, because that was what friends were for. Predictably, Ron went as far as ‘thank you for coming’ before he was overcome with tears, and even Molly joined in with a heckle.
"I didn't want the VIP stuff. You wear sunglasses, a hat, and no one knows. Some man spent forty minutes telling me about new flying techniques," Viktor said, sheepish. Harry groaned.
"I don't really understand it, but I take it you were eventually going to tire of bankers and cauldron heirs."
Harry ate breakfast, showered, and wound up back in bed trying to read the newest spy novel in the London Aurors series. He was so engrossed, he didn’t notice Draco until Draco rapped sharply on the door. Harry shoved his novel under the sheets, a habit he’d never broken from the Dursleys, even though it was nothing to be embarrassed about.
"It’s not cursed. I checked myself. My great-grandfather won it from yours in a game of whist. It sat in our vaults because he was too stubborn to return it. It’s cold iron and gold."
Her fingers are hot, too hot on his skin. Draco knows she means well, and that she’s worried about him, but he just can’t bring himself to care about anything or anyone else right now.
"The mini-Curse-Breaker kit is educational," Harry insisted when he caught Hermione frowning at one of Rosie's ten gifts.
"Mate, he's terrible at flying," Ron said. He was wearing his usual jeans and a t-shirt. Harry had half expected him to show up in a Cannons kit to ward off the evil aura of a successful team.
After this day, touching becomes something natural to them. As natural as Draco can pretend it is, as he tries to hide the sparks of joy elicited by every accidental brush of fingers, every touch on the forearm when one of them makes the other laugh.
He rushes there now, though, the blundering steps taking him to the door he’s kept closed since he lost everything.
"You don't have to understand. Just know that we're fine, and you have my blessing for whatever you're pursuing. He's a good person, I think."
. Kids screaming everywhere, loud conversations they had hoped I would join. Laughter and cries, noise, noise, noise. It hurt. It physically hurt how I didn’t belong there anymore — how maybe I’d never belonged. I was the broken piece that couldn’t fit.
The wine glass he’s holding was the one Harry had gotten him after breaking nearly all of Draco’s finer glasses. The material is a bit thick and stretchy, with all the spells Harry had put in it to make sure it wouldn't break like the others.
Mrs Weasley had promptly supplied them with a complete dinner table, once she found—from Granger, most likely—that they’d be gathering to research Harry’s curse.
Against Draco’s expectations, Potter’s lost so much he can’t actually see what he’s got, and that’s something Draco can relate to.
Another deep breath. The words tumble out of his lips. “I formed a bond between us. It’s my soul that’s keeping you here.”
It hurts not having Harry now that he is awake, somehow more alive than when he was with Draco. It hurts that he died for that man; died to bring him back from that dull slumber, locked away alone and surrounded by silence. It hurts that he gave Harry his entire life and Harry won’t even write a single letter, or say a single word to Draco. It hurts even more because Draco knows he’s not being fair, but he can’t help it.
"Who showed you their family ring? That’s very intimate. You don’t look at other people’s." Her eyes had narrowed suspiciously. "If someone is trying to trick you into marriage, it won’t hold up in court. I’ll have it thrown out by the Wizengamot in twenty seconds."
Draco’s changed a lot in the last ten years. He’s made a name for himself. He worked hard, he grew, and improved. The heavy bags under his eyes are now proof of his work hours, rather than reminiscent of the war days weighing on his actions. He looks healthier, mentally and physically, even if he feels like drowning most of the time.
"I say so, because most people don’t scribble their names on their hair brushes, and I don’t have your parent’s magical signatures. But, people were selling them, specifically advertising that they once belonged to your family."
It’s not possible. The spell he performed had been a success. He had cast diagnostics on her before he went home. There had been no sign of the curse in her body, or in her magic.
Harry wakes him up in the middle of the night, a hand shaking his shoulder so hard for a second Draco thinks he’s being attacked. It’s just Harry, though, with a clear disregard for Draco’s early start tomorrow.
"And truly, I love them, I’m so grateful to be alive and all that, but I’m beginning to think it was either an accident, or both my parents completely lost it."
Harry is different. Despite the magic holding him here, he’s alive and vibrant. He’s energetic around Draco, he enjoys listening to Draco as much as talking. He’s curious about the world, about everything Draco has to tell him, and his naive excitement is something beautiful to watch.
"I would like to call in my Life Debt," Harry said carefully. Draco looked at him, the air settling on them heavily. Now, Harry could sense the depth of the magic he invoked. Draco’s pupils were wide and dark with some mysterious emotion.
about ten years ago, when he had to stop frequenting the Muggle places he used to go, they haven’t talked about it anymore. Without giving it much thought, Draco had assumed Luna had also stopped going to the Community Centre, though now he sees it makes little sense.
They dance to the familiar violin chords, Harry’s head resting on Draco’s shoulder and their bodies moving slowly. When the song is finished, they both agree that the room will remain empty for whenever they want to dance again. None of them says what they’re really thinking. That the space has too many memories for them to bear. Maybe, in the future, they’ll be able to do something with it again.
After match one, Draco sat on the side of the pool while Harry swam his recovery laps. He complained about all the damp, but he sat there anyway with a leatherbound book. Draco snapped the book shut when he noticed Harry swam close enough to read it. Draco’s concession to being poolside was his second best loafers. It wasn’t productive, but every time Harry ended a few laps, he would peek up at Draco, still on the pool chair, flipping through his tome.
He remembers a time where this would be a place of warmth, when this tree would have embraced him in magic, kept him safe. Now it’s just silent, dead, corrupted by Voldemort’s magic, consumed by his hunger for power. The magic and knowledge of every Malfoy who ever lived in this place, so carefully harnessed inside this tree, is gone forever.
Harry spent less time every week in the house as summer training approached. He had gotten a little bit lax with his flying, not being as diligent about an efficient workout instead of just getting one done. It was hard without the social aspect of working out. Harry even considered calling Oliver. Oliver treated him like a teammate and was laid-back about everything but Quidditch. But he seemed serious about this boyfriend, and Harry knew he wouldn’t be helping that situation. Stella was away, and Harry didn’t want to be the Exemplary Captain. He just wanted to be Harry, with someone who would tell him to stop bellyaching and do one more set.
Harry smiles, shoving his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck. “I bought you a new one,” he says, nudging into the skin with a warm chuckle. “Filled it with protection spells. It’ll never break, but it might be a bit stretchy now.”
"Hello," Draco said. He looked as if he didn’t know whether he should be coming or going, as if Andromeda might toss Draco out the door in favour of Harry. But Andromeda recovered first before Draco was able to open his mouth to excuse himself.
“Oh, if it were me I wouldn’t let you off the hook so easily,” Harry teases, shooting him a sideways glance. “I’m actually a bit surprised you befriended Muggles.”
We stayed like this for a few minutes, my face hidden between my arms as I hugged my knees to my chest.
Harry looked across the room where Draco and Oliver Wood’s boyfriend Winston latched onto each other to talk about some obscure academic thing that made Harry’s ears buzz like someone had cast a
Congratulations surround him, except for Potter, of course, but Draco doesn’t care. Potter stares at him with narrowed eyes, and says nothing.
"Gambol right?" Harry confirmed. "He's ruined the team since he cleared out Gareth and the head office. Every single player looks like they're playing on a different team."
Harry considered it. Draco said this wasn’t a date and, in any case, Harry thought the truth wouldn’t scare him off.
She tips the rest of the potion, and hurries to drop the vial on the table once again. Her fingers run up and down his torso, trying to ease the pressure on his chest, when Harry bursts in a coughing fit.
"I knew Hermione couldn’t have written all your papers," Draco said. Apparently, his limit for compliments that weren’t backhanded in any given conversation was exactly one. Harry checked his watch and he had to make it to HQ in less than an hour.
The announcer was even louder. "Merlin, Potter has the Snitch with some of the most dangerous flying I’ve ever seen in my years announcing, folks. What a match! The League has ruled that Potter’s last move was regulation, even in replays. The final score is 270 - 100 to the Falcons. This semi-final is over. Pride is out for the season! With the Harpies defeating Appleby earlier today, the final will be the Harpies and Falcons!"
“You don’t know what you’re getting yourself into.” Harry turns his head so aggressively to the side, the movement ends up dislodging Draco’s hands. He feels the absence of contact in his bones, but doesn’t force it again. “I feel it getting closer, always lurking. If I get distracted, even for a second, it will take me. It might be years from now, but it’s coming.” His eyes lock with Draco’s, sad, but determined. “And I won’t be here anymore.”
"As a friend. Cloaks has excellent security and privacy spells if you were going to pick a Wizarding establishment to canoodle in a hallway. For the team, I’m glad you decided to take the rest elsewhere."
Draco had liked it here at first, it had felt safe. He’d felt loved between Harry’s cool arms. But the dread starts slowly twisting inside Draco as the time passes, and passes. He can’t tell the minutes apart anymore. The green of Harry’s eyes gain that same absence of colour of the world around them. The deep blue the sea had displayed before shifts to an infinite body of colourless water. His own skin seems paler as life escapes his grasp.
Harry longed for the days this had been a simple four bedroom flat, because each new room or expanded dresser was chock full of stuff. He wished for the days a biting snuffbox and terrible decor was all the trouble he could imagine.
He doesn’t finish his sentence, and Draco wants to grab him by the shoulders and make sure Harry knows he still can do all those things. He can travel again, he can live again, he can fall in love again.
Sometime after a lazy and unnecessarily indulgent round two in the early hours of the morning, Draco turned to Harry in the dark. They should have showered, but Harry liked listening to Draco’s heartbeat more, and they'd fallen asleep like that until Draco moved. Harry saw Draco stirring awake and then he spoke.
With a quick motion, Draco signals the other healers to back away from the bed. He casts a series of diagnostic spells around the stabilising dome, assessing what he had already been told. The curse
Draco doesn’t see Harry again for a few days after the fateful posing day. Draco takes little comfort in the fact that it hadn’t been completely nude. Someone had lent him a blanket to use around his middle section, of a fabric in a red almost as bright as the colour of his cheeks. His mortification only grew when he realised Harry had spent half of the time staring at his scars, and the other half at his flushed face. None of them said anything about it, though Draco noticed Harry kept darting surreptitious glances towards him when Julie had dragged them to the pub afterwards. Despite being clearly overwhelmed, Harry had agreed to the pub weirdly quietly.
When Draco looks at Harry again, he’s amused to find Harry poking a gruff looking dragon on the sleeve of his pyjamas. The dragon huffs a breath and flies away, disappearing somewhere under Harry’s arm.
"I thought you’d never ask," Gwen said. She Summoned a scroll of parchment and handed it to him. "I can have anything you’d like delivered."
They went to Harry’s first to fly, because it was a nice Sunday with the weather warming back up. The inside was nothing special; Harry had told an interior designer places he’d liked ten years ago and ended up with a curated cross between the Gryffindor Common Room and the Burrow. His trophies were all here: League pennants, plaques and winners medals. His first League broom was encased in glass. But Harry was already thinking about putting them in Grimmauld. He wouldn’t sell the Falmouth place yet, of course. But all of this didn’t feel much like him.
Draco saunters back to their booth, with the faint feeling that he’s leaving a piece of his heart behind at each step he takes. The pang of loss—his or Harry’s?—creates a lump in his throat. Will he ever heal from this broken heart?
"They never go out of tune. I would be more worried about the curtain ties that are cursed to strangle people in your new receiving room," Draco said. "This reminds me of Malfoy Manor."
"My apologies. I seem to have forgotten myself." Draco stared blankly at the blood welling up in dozens of little cuts.
Draco inhales sharply, forcing down his shame. “I’m sorry. I’m just... It’s hard. But none of this is your fault. It’s mine, probably. Everything is my fault these days.” A dry laugh escapes his lips.
“It’s not up to you,” Harry says. When his hands slip away from Draco’s, it feels like he’s losing part of himself. Although they're just there… just out of reach, Draco can’t bring himself to grab them again.
In one headline, she was a popular example of too many women in Quidditch ruining the game. Another cited her as the issue with tiered tryout ranking eligibility and pondered whether there should be an age cutoff. Still another article claimed that the focus on increasing statistics was ruining Quidditch, which Harry agreed with, but not because Atty Blake wasn’t talented. Give her a few years, and she would be top of the league.
"A little." But Harry had been the one to teach Teddy percentages, so he knew a tiny bit of a vast thing could add up.
Marvin’s expression turns confused, and Draco tilts his head towards the door Potter just crossed to, leaving without a single word to any of them. Not that he spoke at all during the session.
Draco gasps. His whole body is shaking now. Harry seems to sense it, and moves closer again, wrapping one arm around Draco’s waist.
"I'm going to kiss you. For good luck," Harry said, solemn as the countdown began in the other room. Draco nodded once. Harry brought one hand to Draco's chin and watched his eyes flutter shut and pulled Draco in closer. He almost backed out then. It would be easy if Draco gave him some quarter. Draco didn’t.
“I was saying, I think she’ll be great with the kids,” Harry repeats, resting a hand on Draco’s shoulders.
They hadn’t talked for a day. When Harry approached Draco again, not even Draco’s breathless apologies dissuaded Harry of the idea that he had to go.
He’s not sure he’d have kept going if he had got the choice, but he understands Luna’s attachment to the place. Each of them had found their own ways to cope with the wounds of the war. Draco had thought his to be going to the group therapy. But he later found out that being with Harry was healing, too. Luna’s was being there, helping people, and being surrounded by that kind of positive energy that always seemed to beam off her. She’s always loved it in the centre. He remembered thinking that place
“Here.” He points at the page. “Ancient Celtic wizards used objects to seal children’s magic, not completely, though, but to control it better, as they were prone to have strong and wild outbursts of magic. It worked like a wand, only it didn’t channel the magic for them to use. It kept it safe until they were strong enough to fully access it. It’ll work as a receptacle and this kind of magic only works with pure, light magic, like Elle’s own.” He raises bright and hopeful eyes at her. “It works a lot like the Tree of Life in Malfoy Manor, before it died, and like the Hogwarts’ one. The object will keep the magic safe.” Draco’s grin slowly spreads across his face. Hope is
"If you say so, Draco." Draco was going to give Harry a headache if he didn’t stand still. He was vibrating with information, pacing back and forth.
Nothing would ever be as hard as it was then to step onto the pitch and try to make Quidditch the only thing that mattered after everything that had happened. Nothing would ever be as hard as succeeding in shutting everything out and realizing he had been striving for the wrong goal, because shutting everything out made it worse.
Draco scoots nearer, reaching blindly until he makes contact with Harry’s hands, his arms, his neck. Maybe if they’re close like this, he won’t perceive the alarming hopelessness in his gut, the dread filling his chest. “Harry, what are you talking about?” He’s not surprised his voice barely comes out.
The conversation shifts to something easy after they’re convinced Draco’s for real. He’s having fun with Harry’s friends, he realises, despite them being Muggle and Draco’s own reservations about meeting them before this. They’re a big part of Harry’s life now, and Draco wants them to like him. But they’re nice to him, and fun, and clearly care for Harry as much as Harry seems to care for them.
“If you believe it, and she believes it, then it must certainly be true,” he blurts out, words cutting and filled with hurt.
“Draco, do you—” Pansy stops short, when she takes in the sight, expression turning slightly blank. “Hello, Potter.”
"They changed this bottle design for Ogden’s in 1843. I wouldn’t clean my tables with it, let alone drink it. I don’t want to go blind."
Healer Cameron, much like Pansy, didn’t like his programme for Elle’s treatment plan and had barred it at first. When Elle was ultimately bedridden and became a permanent resident of St Mungo’s, about three weeks after the initial development of his plan, she had to concede it was the best course of action, even as Draco ran every possible scenario where things could go wrong by her. There
"The League has an event this afternoon, and I have to show up because they are announcing changes to the Player Association pension to include civil partnerships."
Harry grumbled. He'd said that because it was what you said, and he had felt sort of bad about how surprised Blaise was at the breakup. It wasn’t a storybook romance. They danced around each other for months before Harry spotted him after a match and took him home. They dated a bit. Harry was under the impression he'd hurt Blaise's ego more than his feelings.
"It won’t if they keep it out of the locker room," Stella said. She took off her hair tie, shaking out her long black hair. "Isn’t it wild they just get to…" She trailed off, but Harry knew what she meant. Harry wouldn’t dare compromise his career. And there was no question it would, if he were the one caught.
Harry closes the distance between them after a beat, the heat of his lips almost there, not really touching Draco. The imprint of contact is enough to have the hair on Draco’s skin standing on end.
“I met your ex,” Elle says, apropos of nothing, while Draco casts some diagnostics later in the day.
would never suffice. Nothing would. Nothing feels enough. The words dry in his throat, and although all he wants is to lose himself in those green eyes again, he can’t bring himself to stare.
. Draco politely finished breakfast and helped Harry do the washing up before asking, "So are you going to kiss me again or was that a mistake?"
Harry, apparently unaware that Draco’s already awake too, keeps shaking him, causing Draco to snarl more acerbically than intended, “What?”
Draco pulls back, his face creased in an ugly grimace. He can’t have heard it right. “What? How can you say that? You’re my life, Harry.”
Harry’s condition worsens after their visit to the forest. He forgets more serious things—the dinner to celebrate Julie’s birthday, their one-year anniversary party, his classes,  feeding Ruby—his magic flares wildly, but it doesn’t respond as easily to Harry when he needs to cast the simplest spell. He asks where Draco got the dragon printed silk pyjamas, though Harry himself had gifted it to him last year. More than once Harry wonders when they adopted a cat. When Granger and Pansy settle in their guest room for a few days before their new flat is done being furbished, Harry welcomes them with a grin, but inquires about their presence to Draco and if they’re dating later in their room, even though the girls have been dating for at least six months.
It’s become a sort of ritual for them to greet each other like this since Draco’s meltdown on the first day. He promised he would never subject himself to that kind of humiliation again, with tears wetting his cheeks and a burning heart. But after that he came back again and again, decisively less arrogant about it.
“I don't have a job now, and I don't know what I have to do now, but... I have to take care of… my godson, and of people who depend on me." Potter sighs, his magic pulsing around them. “They expect me to know how to fix things, to be someone I’m not.” He shrugs. “I... Sometimes I wish I was no one, and no one knew me. I wish I could disappear.”
“Draco, please, don’t be difficult,” Pansy says when she sees him tucked inside his blankets, watching Harry’s favourite show.
“What did you hope to find here?” Your voice was soft as the breeze in the alley, your hand rested on my knees, still holding mine.
He shakes his head. “Your curse is feeding on your magic, so the more the magic, the worse it gets. We will take all the precautionary measures to assure your safety. Meaning, from now on, you’re on a strict potions diet for three weeks.” He smiles at Elle, and points at the assembly of vials by her bedside table Draco had organised before he started talking. “This procedure won’t expunge your magic; your core will remain intact. It only means you won’t be able to access it for the duration of the spell. These potions will ensure your body retains some degree of magical affinity. It’s not always clear how full grown wizards behave without magic, so we’ll make sure your body is surrounded by magic, externally rather than internally. Once we take the subject the curse is most interested in from you—your magic—it won’t have space to grow. It’ll stabilise and we’ll be able to lift the curse without having it ravage your magic.”
“Yes, we did. She was already old when we found her... Rather, she found us. She died two years after you... You know.”
Luna wore my clothes, and I gave her dark hair, while mine had turned a silky blond that got my stomach churning. It got us both laughing again in the end, and it was enough to ease the tension on my shoulders.
“I can understand you, though,” Luna adds, voice low and careful, as she glances at him with pride. “Being idle, having nothing to occupy your mind with everything that’s been going on…”
“I feel like I’m drowning, whenever they ask me if I’m fine,” Potter says. His gaze is always on Draco, who tries not to be too entranced by his green eyes to focus on his words and the suffocating magic Potter's pouring out.
Draco pressed his hand to the walls of the kitchen and took a deep breath. Then Draco was chanting, low and melodic and in Latin. The sound settled somewhere around Harry’s chest.
And so, the golden light of this very early Spring morning finds him sprawled, legs akimbo, white linen shirt halfway unbuttoned, and suspenders loose around his hips, lounging on the floor of one of the birthing stalls. His sketchbook is open flat on his lap, and his fingers are black and powdery from the charcoal nub clasped gently between his thumb and forefinger.
And it’s not like he hasn’t seen Harry at all during this time. Harry still stops by St Mungo’s to visit Elle. He still smiles sheepishly at Draco whenever their paths cross. Harry never stays, however. Always polite, but never willing. They don’t talk, Draco doesn’t hear his voice anymore, and has to watch him from afar.
Harry came out to see Draco and Pansy staring at each other. Both looked like they had seen a ghost. Draco's mouth was open like he meant to say something but wouldn't. Couldn't, maybe.
Draco loved Vincent for many reasons, not least because he was there the day that Vincent was born. The chaos of foaling season meant Draco could slip through the stables virtually undetected as the racing team staff, his father, and their wealthy patrons were otherwise preoccupied. He watched--wide eyed and slack jawed--from behind a mound of hay as the vet murmured charms and wove a magical barrier around the mare’s hind quarters, reaching out a gloved hand to ease the baby into the world with a wet-sucking splatter. Vincent looked right at him, with his fresh, milky eyes, as his spindly legs and wet-paper wings flapped and flailed about.
He’s lost, and he’s done. Draco is just so tired of constantly trying to hold on to something that isn’t there anymore. He shivers, nodding slowly as new tears climb down a path on his face. His voice cracks with a single plea. “I can’t do it.”
Harry lifts his head from where it rests on Draco’s chest, eyes searching  his own, serious and intense. “It’s not only about the press. We’re together all the time. My friends like you—”
Hermione won’t let slide the way his cheeks burn or how stiff he gets whenever she enunciates Harry’s name. The fact that he’s been avoiding her and Pansy since the first of Harry’s midnight escapades doesn’t help either.
There was a little time to spend with everyone at the Burrow before training started. Molly cooked a large Sunday lunch and had all her grandchildren over. Each year, Ron tried to cook more food to give Molly a break, and, each year, Molly treated it as if it was one of Hermione’s cooking competitions on television.
"You can use your words instead of getting the house to try to trap me," Draco said, but he was teasing. He kissed Harry on the landing and halfway down the hallway and against Harry’s door. Draco Transfigured a candleholder into a cup, and the clink of rings in it was loud.
"I won’t lift anything," Harry promised. Not being cleared to play the Harpies next week was out of the question, and there was only a light workout to fill his day.
"Harry, we lived together, and he came home and told me immediately." Neville said. He didn’t sound too put out about it.
His grin is almost impossible when he shakes Harry, but it dies slowly on his lips as the seconds tick by and Harry doesn’t open his eyes.
"Astoria—" Gemma began, hesitating. "Don't you think it might be unwise to spend an entire week with her when she is dating Ginevra Weasley?"
Draco chokes, coughs a few times and recovers before Harry can change his mind. He tries schooling his features into something less eager. He knows better not to ask something of him Harry can’t give. Draco says, “Yes. Of course, I can.”
Elle’s grin towards Healer Cameron is tight, but Draco makes nothing of it. Surely it’s because of the curse preventing her full movements rather than disloyalty. Healer Cameron stares at him, and then at the girl, before sighing heavily.
Draco can't count how many nights he's spent at St Mungo’s, watching Harry’s peaceful expression in his slumber. He had asked the same question, over and over again, but Harry had never replied.
Draco takes a deep breath, hiding his smile against the pages he had been reading before, and mutters, “See, someone appreciates my collection.”
“Hey, love. Did you sleep well?” Draco asks, dazed, getting up and mirroring Harry’s sitting position.
So he forced himself to stop monitoring the house work and made sure to do an extra afternoon stretch, some light floorwork, even when he could hear Draco puttering around and opening cursed eighteenth century sideboards from Germany. Draco had left Harry to his makeshift gym, and sometimes Harry caught glimpses of him through the door before a simple goodbye around six each evening. He ignored the knock on his wards to keep up just one more hamstring stretch, dismissing it as a package for the house and therefore Draco. The front door creaked open.
"If you are queer and go to Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat will always consider Slytherin and maybe Hufflepuff. It’s just a fact! The evidence is in front of you!"
—and ranting about the concocted and misleading information in the headlines. He rehearses conversations with Harry  that will never happen:
They don’t say another word about it, but guilt is slowly eating his insides. He knows exactly why he didn’t go, and why he’s got half a mind to miss the next session.
It’s not exactly an invitation, and whether Draco’s going is not open for discussion, he realises, when the owl flies off without his reply.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek, willing the words out. “I swear if you don’t say this at once, I don’t know what I’m capable of doing.”
Draco follows her motions when she approaches the bed slowly, as if trying to reach for a wild animal. Harry doesn’t explode on her, but her presence does nothing to diminish the increasing pressure of his powerful magic. Draco can almost taste it, and it resembles nothing of what he’s come to know of Harry’s magic. It has nothing of the rich flavour he used to pour, but a pungent, tart tang.
Draco opens his mouth, ready to object. He’s the one that failed as a son. He didn’t take care of his mother like he should have. He gave up on years of legacy, and he can’t ever be the Malfoy she expects him to be.
"It's nice that you have her. I'm so happy for you. Like, so happy." Maybe Harry was verging on tipsy.
"Why not? Some wizards drive. Draco drove to our house last week," Teddy said. That sparked something uncomfortable within Harry that he didn’t care to examine.
to my face. You meant it." Then, more quietly, he continued, "I don't begrudge you for feeling that way. You don’t have to forgive me."
There is only one exception. There’s an envelope that’s not strange to him, despite being in a pile of unknown names. Draco picks up and reads Teddy’s letter on his way to his first appointment, wondering how it got mixed up with his public mail and did not go directly to his home.
"Oh yeah, he’s doing your place now, isn’t he? The house got done, as you can see," Seamus said breezy as anything, while he mixed more punch for the bowl.
"You would have inherited Sirius’ portion of the Black vaults. Usually there’s some furniture, decor, jewellery. Part of what will settle your claim to the house is bringing in important family items. Wizarding Heirlooms are preferable for resonance. You must also bring in some more personal effects, but we can discuss that later."
"Show Harry the model," Teddy demanded. Draco didn’t react to his tone. "Please," Teddy added, late, as Harry opened his mouth to say something about manners.
The tears have been choked in his throat since Elle’s last words, and they now drown him in their perpetual flood. Draco tries to breathe through his swollen throat, through the tears, through his loud cries.
Only, Harry shakes his head and rolls his eyes. “You Healers are all the same. I drink a normal amount of coffee.”
"One charity you're fond of is SafeHome, which provides housing for LGBTQ+ youth, Muggle and Wizarding alike. Why did you choose them to sponsor with your cover story?"
Draco smirks, bumping his shoulder against Harry’s and making the bond vibrate with anticipation. “Thought about me often, did you? And I’ll have you know the craft of potion making is delicate and uniquely challenging. You wouldn’t understand it, you brute.”
The bond Draco’s fought so hard to ignore in order to keep his life and sanity sits warmly inside him. It’s stronger now and even when he’s not as close to Harry, he
Harry ran into Draco in the middle of the day at home and tried to hide his disappointment, but Draco read the thunderous expression for what it was as Harry banged around the kitchen making a recovery drink and eating a banana and several nuts. Draco leaned against the cupboards. Harry almost couldn’t stand that Draco was downstairs with him instead of upstairs tinkering.
His body feels limp, limbs heavy as his heart rests, raw and exposed, between them. He leaves it there. There’s no need for a crushed heart right now, and he leaves Pansy to a screaming battle with Kreacher.
Draco gapes at him. He knows Harry can feel him, but he would never expect or hope that Harry would be compelled to meet Draco because of it.
Despite his silence, Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s hair, showing he’s listening to their conversation. It makes him blush.
dedicates an entire edition to Harry’s Hogwarts visit, but it’s Pansy who tells him how Harry asked Hermione and Ron to let him walk the grounds alone for a while, and that when he returned, he had red-rimmed eyes. Draco cries a bit for his grief, but most of all, he wishes he could be there for Harry.
Draco did in the end. He met Harry in front of the stadium and they walked to the pub together, mostly quiet.
The war had taken a lot more from the Malfoys than their status and fortune for reparations. Lucius had been justifiedly locked in Azkaban right after the battle, only to die a few months later. Draco’s and Narcissa’s destiny  wasn’t the same in the light of Harry’s endorsement during their trials.
He’s aiming for sardonic, but it falls short. Harry pulls away, staring at Draco with his eyes glinting and a sappy beam.
Harry had already found the set up in the study with a record player and Muggle records. But in the summer, he was surprised to find a list of records with an address to a record shop in Cardiff. When he checked, it was all albums Sirius hadn’t already owned but wanted to buy. The first time Harry went, he hadn’t questioned why this shop was so far away.
Harry couldn’t help but look when he got time to spread Draco underneath him in the full light of day.
"That means you’re doing a good job," Draco said smoothly, and Hermione threw her head back and laughed.
Harry hungered to see Draco's whole body, but Draco didn't give him that. This was what Harry got to nip at: a sliver of thigh, the curve of belly folded as Draco sat, the tender crease of his thighs, the fine hair of his body against his cheek. He kissed him all over what was exposed, licking, putting Draco's cock in his mouth and groaning at the taste. Draco placed a careful hand at the base of Harry's neck, and Harry made a desperate throaty sound. Draco tasted so good it felt illicit.
Granger says the Weasley matriarch has been feeling lonely, estranged by her own spawn, since the last of her children left the nest. Ronald Weasley had been assigned an Auror mission in Ireland and decided not to come back, and the girl Weasley is often away practicing with her team. Draco makes a mental note to thank Mrs Weasley again afterwards.
Molly Weasley is a kind woman. That’s a truth Draco learnt because of Harry. But he continued to believe that all by himself. Mrs Weasley had been there for Draco when he was so sad and desperate. He thought he was alone a couple of years back, when his mother died and aunt Andromeda moved to France, leaving him to be the last Malfoy in England. She was there as a friend and as the only family he had, regardless of the fact that Harry wasn’t in the scene anymore.
Harry had left Draco a note telling him he would be away for at least a fortnight. Draco wrote him back saying something about a china cabinet, and Harry couldn't give less of a fuck, but it seemed important. It wasn’t like he heard much from Malfoy, and there had to be some things only Harry could do.
Blaise shines in the night, dressed in a bright green top and black trousers. He looks gorgeous and directs a winning smile at Draco.
“He woke up.” Draco is already standing, ignoring the things they’d gathered around the clearing—a tome in dark ancient Celtic spells, a potion to assuage whatever pain he might have felt, doses of Muggle adrenaline, ‘
, but Draco knows better than anyone what it is to feel lonely when he’s surrounded by friends and family.
That’s why Draco, still unable to avert his gaze, shrugs, feigning nonchalance. “My public humiliation amuses you, Harry?”
It took a stranger’s hand in my neck, making my skin crawl, and your lonely step in my direction to get me fetching Luna and fleeing the hell out of that place faster than my heart could beat.
He made his way to Penelope’s office on the other side of the complex, and she set him a new routine. "Let’s give you a challenge."
“Is it reversible? Can it… Will he ever get his memories back?” he hears Hermione ask, her voice muffled and distant, as the world closes in around him.
“Oh, Harry, it worked. You’re here,” Draco hears himself say, hot rivulets of tears streaming down his cheeks. His face is drawn to Harry’s line of sight as his torso hovers over him. “You’re really here. It’s me, love. It’s me. I’m here.
ran a photo on page two, after ‘Falcons Going to Final’. Harry never read the article. Pansy said she sent it to Millie for the retractions. Barb sent him a card that flashed trailblazer in big sparkly letters. Draco said it was a fine piece of fiction, but "seeing how we haven’t been fucking since we were fourteen, largely inaccurate."
Harry was mildly amused as Hermione continued on this topic for several long minutes. He knew she depended on other people for her work: activists, her colleagues at the Independent Commission on Justice, the more progressive members of the Wizengamot. But she was tireless about legal reform, and she wouldn’t stop with a few reports and expert roundtables. He was proud of her and told her as much.
"End it quickly before it gets nasty," Harry said to Min-woo. He nodded and ran to confer with their Coach. To Stella, he said, "Keep formation."
Harry usually studies him, gaze unwavering, before deciding whether Draco’s answers make sense or if he wants to know more.
"I see," Draco said. They both knew what he meant by company, and Harry knew he should pull back and behave.
The day passes by blissfully with no further problems, and Draco can’t shake the grin Teddy’s letter has put in his face until he enters the room where’s supposed to examine Elle Carrey for the day.
Perhaps it was a misstep. Harry might have got so distracted while shoving his tongue down that stranger’s throat he did not notice the reporters. The picture does not feature this exact scene, but Draco’s mind is very ingenious. To be fair, Harry did say he was surprised about the amount of work the press was putting on him. Surely, though, now Draco wants to bury himself under concrete. Or murder the man that had hands on
Draco runs to him, kneeling in front of Harry, hands cupping his face urgently. Harry’s staring straight at the window, at the nothingness growing outside. Draco forces his head around, but Harry’s eyes stay focused on the glass.
"Slytherin mind tricks," Pansy said offhandedly. Then she sighed at Harry's expression. "We are very similar. Even if we didn't speak for years, he wouldn't refuse me a favour. I would never refuse him either."
They all waved. The rest he did know: Millicent herself, Blaise, intimately, and Theo in that he also looked the same as he did at school.
Is all Draco thinks, as he pulls back, easing away from the students. He bites his lower lip, but when Harry grins sheepishly at him, Draco can’t really be mad.
Draco hates her a little for treating him like this, because it does nothing to ease the hurt, ripping his heart to shreds.
"Don’t wait for a reply, Archimedes." The owl bowed and flew out the window. "He’ll give you an appointment now."
"It wasn’t like he was running around heading up Death Eater revival tours. He worked with Bill. He had that Muggle boyfriend. His parents were being shitty. He was a bit lost."
Draco had things to keep him busy, mostly everything he could find on Harry’s recovery. But right at this moment, he doesn’t want to think about Harry or to know what he’s doing, and tries to ignore the tug of their bond telling him Harry, just like Draco, is miserable deep down.
"Come on, take, take," Draco muttered. And then Sirius' name was restored, woven in gold with his constellation behind it, as if it had never been gone. Slowly, a line trailed downward to stitch Harry's name with a brief annotation that said 'godson'. The constellation behind his name was…
"Cake for breakfast?" Draco said, incredulous. "Do I want cake for breakfast?" But something in his expression betrayed absolute delight even though his tone was sharp.
Draco pushes some books to the side, making space on the corner of the table for his mug. The answer comes easily. “Yes.”
Draco’s trying to decipher how, in Circe’s name, to finish this beef bourguignon recipe in that damned empty kitchen—he is not giving up or his name is not Draco—when a voice calls his attention.
, palpable and suffocating. “I’m thinking about a branch of an Alder Tree. They believed this tree possesses the power of protection, the energy to remove dark magic from your life. Can’t you see? If we can do that to Elle, isolate her magic from the dark curse, we can lift the curse and her magic will be intact. And maybe, if it works with Elle, then I can… then I can find a way to get Harry to stay permanently—”
"Don't lose heart. It's one match, early in the season. Plenty of flying time ahead of you." Coach patted Harry on the shoulder.
“So, that’s it, then?” Elle’s stare darts from Healer Cameron, standing stoically by her bed, and lands on Draco. “I won’t have my magic?”
Draco sniggers with the memory of Pansy trying to sneak out with Draco to have coffee when they first moved in, because Hermione was so adamant about her girl not dying of an overdose with the quantity of caffeine “those healers keep ingesting”. He vaguely remembers Harry trying to convince him too, and giving up when he realised never would have Draco survived his healer training without this extra boost.
“Yeah.” Harry dismisses it with a shrug, his eyes glazed and distant. He tilts his head towards the corridor, as if asking Draco if that’s the way he’s going. What can Draco do if not follow?
“Why,” he starts. He wheezes and leans against a tree to catch his breath, looking up. “Why won’t you let me find him?”
There were outstanding questions on Harry's end too, and he ended up, as with most things, just asking Pansy bluntly in the middle of one of their work chats.
Harry knew he tinkered, but it wasn’t long before Hermione said, "I didn’t know you had gotten this far." Harry murmured his agreement.
Harry expected to hear a jab about his softheartedness, but Draco looked at him like he was something a little different than he expected. That was a welcome change, because Draco so far was something different than Harry expected.
"Keys are symbolic. Your house will let me in if you desire, with or without it. But no, I think it would be good to clear my head." Draco turned his attention back to the tiny empty drawers.
But there, at least, he had Harry. Draco could touch him, though their touch held no warmth, they could kiss, though there was barely any feeling to their skin. Harry told him he loved Draco, and Draco replied the only way he knew.
Draco frowns, leaning his weight on his  elbows. “But you and the other men…” The memory of the articles featuring Harry with an assortment of strangers makes his stomach coils, and he gulps tersely.
Draco watches as a thousand emotions flick through Harry’s expression. Rage, incomprehension, hurt. He opens his mouth twice, deciding in the end to go with, “Wait, what?”
"Most families have a few. The ring accepts anyone when there’s a genuine connection of blood or affection. So you could pass your ring to your godson. If Sirius had a ring, he could have passed it to you."
and suck all the magic for himself, thus killing the tree, and your house in the process, that was deeply connected to that ancient magic.”
He gets to be with Harry, who loves him. His and Mother’s tentative truce is turning into a nurturing and healed relationship a bit more at each letter and meeting. He has good friends and a bigger family than he’d ever hoped for. Draco’s still astounded by the fact that the Weasleys have welcomed him into their house with no less warmth than they have Harry.
"I was supposed to do everything my parents wanted. Retake their place in society. Then I met Daniel."
The conversation seems to get the attention of Blaise, who turns to them and joins in with a grave tone and a smirk playing on his lips. “Most pure-blood families have a Tree of Life in their property. It’s not just a garnish, it’s real.” He waits for his words to sink in. Granger stares at him with an eyebrow raised. “It connects the magic of all of those who lived on those grounds, it empowers them. It’s why it’s so important that pure-bloods remain living in the main house, and their offspring and so on. It’s honestly an inane rule, but it grants the descendants of the house magic many benefits.”
The nightmares keep him awake the entire night. When Draco closes his eyes, the images become real, raw, palpable, and they hurt. Draco cries alone in the darkness, though his cheeks are dry, tears he can’t shed anymore choked down in his throat. The bond is acutely aware of Harry’s presence on the other side of the wall, and distraught about the absence of Harry by his side in the cold bed.
It is just his jealousy and sadness trying to take control of his actions, his thoughts. If Draco succumbs to them, will there be anything of him left?
Training camp got better and worse every year. Worse, because every year he wondered if this was it for him, and he was about to show the signs of decline. Better, because he remembered the half-starved, broken, feral thing he had been in September ‘98 when he signed, missing most of training camp and just meeting the deadline to play. The League’s concession to the War had been waiting a month extra to start the season.
"Oh fuck. I mean, shit. I thought she was joking about knowing you. Nice to meet you, Harry. Very nice to meet you. Huge fan." From Padma’s expression, he wasn’t usually this nervous.
To say he’s freaking out about meeting Harry’s Muggle friends from college is putting it mildly. Draco could not focus at work for almost the entire week, his mind providing disastrous scenarios.
Either they genuinely like Draco’s company, or just want to make sure he hasn’t reverted to the fetal position on the couch, but they’re there religiously. Sometimes one of them can’t make it, other times Theo joins them, but Draco’s never alone during their weekly meeting.
Draco feels his throat tightening and chest hurting as if it's been ripped open after this session, whereas he has said nothing out of the ordinary for him. It’s all because Harry Potter was there, and he listened in contemplative silence to everything that Draco said. He didn’t storm out of the room, nor scoff at his attempts at opening up. He just listened.
"No, only for significant events. Weddings, funerals, the repayment of Life Debts," Draco said. His casual tone couldn't fool Harry. Harry had never noticed him wear it before today, so Draco was being honest.
"I’ve done quite a few pure-blood ancestral homes, and the Black family has more fucked up things than the last three combined."
Then, Harry moves on the mattress, turning his face to Draco, his hands tucked between his knees. “I died,” Harry confesses, with a ragged breath. His magic sparks. “I died in the forest, during the Battle of Hogwarts.”
"Speaking of tradition," Luc said, reaching into his pocket and throwing Galleons on the table. The bar staff, all quite used to and well compensated for the frequent presence of the team, started pouring shots of whisky.
“Potter,” Draco says, aiming for casual and landing somewhere near nauseous. He snaps his sketchbook shut firmly, cursing silently at the smudged, black mess he’s sure to find when he reopens it later. A small price to pay to keep Harry from laying eyes on his other doodles, full of silly, round glasses, sharp, lightning-bolt shaped scars, and deeply-dimpled smiles.
“Yes, well...” Draco shrugs, his shoulder brushes Harry’s, and he leaves it there. The constant touch is a comfort, more than a blessing these days. He eyes a curious sculpture of what seems to be a fallen horse with a mix of red and blue in its muscled body. “Weirder things have happened.”
She nodded, even as her face crumpled again. "I know it’s just the game." Harry would get himself thrown out of every game if that was going to be the game, but he thought it wouldn’t help her to hear it.
So, of course, they trotted Harry out to answer for their playing. No, this was not the end of the road. Yes, the Falcons had a bad match. No, he would not throw any player in front of a Bludger. Perhaps, yes, it was his fault as they all had to take responsibility and he was their leader. No, he was quite sure it had nothing to do with the rookie.
"You said, 'Hello Pansy. Before you say anything, I don't want any more apologies. We don't need to talk about the war. It all makes me feel like shit. Let's be civil, hey?' and then you acted like I was a stranger you only met a week ago." Pansy said.
"Don’t get me wrong. I was better, but you were still good," Harry said. "We should play a Seeker’s game sometime."
. I mean, that’s the weirdest part.” He chuckles softly, but his eyes can’t meet Draco’s and it makes something uncomfortable boil inside him.
Ginger. It made me snort again when I looked at the mirror after Luna finished. Hers was a burnished, unnatural purple.
"I want you to come like this," Draco whispered as he took Harry's cock in hand. Harry closed his eyes. He could hear Draco panting in his ear. Again, no wand but Draco's hand was slick and perfect around him. Harry let his legs fall open just a touch wider. It was overwhelming, and he was trying not to buck too much. Draco pinned Harry and rutted against him.
Life slowly gets back on track. They’re seeing a Mind Healer together, and the fights they’ve had in the beginning are now less frequent. They have lunch at the Burrow every Sunday and try to visit Elle’s grave at least once a month, knowing no one will clean it, and bring her flowers if they don’t. Sometimes, Draco goes alone, and he tells her everything about his life with Harry. He hopes she’s listening, wherever she is.
Draco gestured, and Harry reached out and grabbed a tiny bit of magic Draco siphoned out from the wall. It felt thin, brittle, and knotted like a strand of hair, so Harry tried to unpick the tie. It dissipated in his hands.
They had needed that time apart. But Draco almost can’t contain the hope in him when he sees Harry standing at the door, staring at him with uncertainty in his eyes. He needs to touch him, to kiss him whole, to make sure Harry is really there. He doesn’t, not yet.
Diving into his job, or going out with Blaise again, doesn’t work. Having lunch with Pansy and Hermione does little to diminish the clutching in his chest. They are certainly aware of what Draco’s done, but none of them brings the subject of the bond up.
Sighing, Draco puts down his wand. The floating tendrils of magic fade, softly merging with the background. He’s been trying to discipline himself regarding Harry. He asks no more of Pansy, avoids reading news about Harry, since the whole
Julie slowly turns an inquisitive gaze at Harry, a confused frown creasing her features, and no words seem forthcoming.
The bond has been silent, a distant whistle Draco’s learnt to ignore the past few weeks. Now, though, it screams in his ears, makes his chest tighten, his fingers twitch. He can’t touch Harry. He can’t! And the bond will have to learn it the hard way.
"Take it easy. Have a good night, yeah?" Oliver whispered. Harry nodded. Harry could sense Winston, who was more than used to their weird displays of affection. They had been like this even before dating. Sex was one thing, but he'd sooner swallow tacks than date Oliver again. It had been too much like dating himself, if he was more well-adjusted.
"Of course I came," Draco said, as if there had never been a question of him being here. "I came to all the games. Congratulations." Harry thought about that flash in the crowd all those matches high up in the stands. Harry had a speech prepared for after the finals, at a party with everyone. Harry planned to invite him there though he didn’t have the wording right yet.
"It’s all very tricky magic, isn't it?" Harry asked. "When I talked to Bill, he said he’d rather steal from Gringotts than fiddle with people’s houses."
Harry was loath to shift the balance of anything under these circumstances, but that Tuesday, with the July light slanting over both of them in the new parlour, Harry cleared his throat.
Draco had never been afraid of the darkness until he had to live with the Dark Lord under his roof. Now, though, he makes his way inside and out of the Manor as quickly as he can. He stops by the library to retrieve some books on ancient curses he knows they’ve had in storage forever, and leaves before the gloom stretching inside the corridors of Malfoy Manor becomes too much to bear.
He tinkered around at first, playing scales and chords. Then he warmed up to different bits of pieces. Harry didn't know anything about classical music, but Draco wasn’t in a very chatty mood, so he just watched Draco's hands with their rings dance over the keys.
“I told you not to try it, I told you—” Hermione starts again, and he snaps, finally turning and facing her.
In the end, however, his boss shakes her head, dropping a heavy hand on his shoulder. “Get your act together. You can come back in a week.”
Even though, as Harry reminded himself, he wasn’t officially Captain yet. They would have a conversation behind the scenes if they meant to let him go as Captain, but he would feel jittery until they announced.
Draco hasn’t been planning this for long. But when his mother asked him, about a month ago, what he and Harry thought about their future, sealing their union just seemed like the obvious, most natural answer. She had helped him pick a beautiful ring, a golden band with an emerald that instantly reminded him of Harry’s eyes. It now lies in a small velvety white case, opened and exposed in Draco’s shaky hands, much like his heart.
When Harry blew out his candles with the Weasleys, Teddy, and Andromeda, he didn’t make a wish. He didn’t believe in it anyway. But he remembered Draco in the kitchen, licking frosting from the plate off his fingertips when he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
The lyrics follow him as he paces around the house, listlessly searching for what he can't really admit. His presence is a ghost, haunting a life he doesn’t have anymore.
and the other Alder tree branch from my office. And the rest of you, if you can’t help, get the fuck out.”
But this is Draco’s safe space. His escape from all the judging eyes, from the well-aimed hate. He’s been working so
. The parties, the people, he misses the dinners themselves, and his mother, he misses the blissful ignorance and innocence of someone who only had to worry about pleasing his parents. But even if the Manor had been restored, if it was possible and it beamed with light and magic now, it wouldn’t bring any of those things back, and Draco’s fated to miss them forever.
Each step seems to take something from him. Harry’s shoulders hunch down. His face is scrunched in a scowl. Draco tries touching his arm, but Harry flinches back so violently Draco refrains from touching him again. Instead, he follows in silence, as Harry seems to have forgotten he’s not alone.
"Get out of my sight," Harry snapped. He pointed to the door, and Luc left. Harry dropped his head into his hands. Stella came in with a low whistle.
room, and he’ll get rid of every trace of Harry in here if that’s what it takes for the pain to stop.
His rage, his indignation and hopelessness must be clear on his face, in his fingers gripping at Harry, for Harry hunches his shoulders and leans forward, lips barely touching Draco’s. “I didn’t think we’d be together. You don’t have to. I don’t want you to suffer. This curse, whatever it is, it may never—”
Either cursed patients are cured urgently or they... Well, they don’t actually make it this far. But Elle did, and he’s treated her for so long that Draco shouldn’t be surprised by her rare displays of affection. But this kind of demeanour is so different from her usual that Draco can’t avoid being stunned.
Draco is left with the warmth of Harry’s skin against his lips, the heat of his magic, and he wonders, can he really have this?
It’s not a huge house, but it has a good size for their family. It sports four bedrooms and a spacious kitchen he knows will please Kreacher way too much. The backyard looks decrepit, with lifeless plants and dry grass spreading around, but it’s ample, and he can picture how splendid it can be if they just recover the grass and plant a few species of flowers, maybe even a tree. It’s warm, but not too much. It has the perfect amount of windows letting the light in from many angles, and there’s a large room with long glass panels of windows that Draco finds is perfect for a painting studio for Harry.
Harry suspected it was a way of softening the blow, but he didn't care. He liked strategy and Coach wasn't soft enough to let him fuck up to soothe Harry's ego.
Potter bites his lower lip, but whatever he’s struggling against loses out to his bravery. “I remember my friends love me, and that they’d be sad if I vanished. I couldn’t stare them in the eyes if I ever hurt them.”
Harry stays frozen in place, eyes almost white, glazed. Draco can’t give in to despair, or he won’t come back.
"Did you forget something?" Andromeda asked, looking around at the counters and kitchen table. Draco bent to where Harry was sitting and kissed him chastely on the mouth. It must have lasted less than a few seconds but a tingling sensation swept up Harry’s neck. He cleared his throat.
However, when he finally makes his way to the booth where the hubbub comes from, he’s met only with amazement and none of the hostility he was expecting. Harry is staring smugly at him, lips parted and a strong flush to his cheeks. His friends gape at Draco with jaws on the floor, as if he’s a ghost. He tries not to feel relieved too soon.
Luna’s words echo endlessly in his brain. Harry doesn’t remember. Harry doesn’t love Draco. Repeating ceaselessly.
They shared a special bond, Draco was sure of it. Vincent was always waiting for him, with his skeletal snout thrust over the gate of his stall, wide-open nostrils flaring as they searched for Draco’s scent in the air. Draco had never needed a lead when working with Vincent, the thestral followed him instinctively and never wandered. He was the only person who could mount Vincent without being playfully bucked off. They spent hours and hours in the sky above the Manor, Draco telling Vincent all about the imaginary little fiefdoms and friaries that comprised their kingdom.
"Fucking grow up," Harry said, taking a page from Draco's book. But he could tell he still sounded fond of Draco. He was so fond of him.
Draco wears his most casual outfit. It’s been years since he put on those jeans, though, and the memory of Harry devouring him with his eyes whenever he wore them makes Draco now transfigure the piece to something almost entirely different. The new trousers—still jeans, but brighter and ripped—feel wonky as he pulls them on, but they match the coal button-up shirt he wears.
“I love you, Harry Potter,” Draco says, voice thick, and pulls Harry closer. “And I would never trade the happiness of being with you now, for a life of unknown emptiness.”
Pansy is right. They’re not together anymore, but Draco would never let Harry be hurt. He needs to tell him about the bond. He knows he’ll do what she wants—what he should have already done. But not before he figures out Elle's situation, not before he gives Healer Cameron a full report on what he intends to do to save her.
Milo thumped Harry on the back hard and made kissy noises as he went by. But it was friendly, good-natured ribbing. Draco seemed to relax a tiny bit more when he saw that Harry wasn’t upset.
It’s the bond’s urgency, his own fear that he’s going to lose what little he has conquered now and the recent discovery about Elle’s case that takes Draco back to the house where he grew up.
They spent most nights sitting on the back steps of Grimmauld, in the garden looking up at the stars, though it was nowhere near as clear as the night sky at Hogwarts. The constellations were muddy and indistinct, but comforting.
the lucky one for having Draco Malfoy, Death Eater scum almost makes Draco melt right here and then. “And I’m great, okay?” He turns, then, to Draco, eyes glinting and lips wet. “Draco?”
Draco continued, "We’ve booked a private room in the restaurant, so you won’t be bothered. It’s just a few of us, and the thought of you sitting alone is depressing me. You’ll ruin my night."
“You miss a memory, Draco. I’m gone.” Harry glances at the other Harry again. “But he’s here. And you love him.”
"There’s a generational divide between Curse-Breakers. A lot of the older ones were very strictly trained in arithmancy, ancient runes, and defensive magic." Draco conjured a dizzying number of red figures that scrolled too fast to track.
“Don’t say it,” Draco interrupts, and he can’t recognise the sound of his own voice, so alien, guttural and charged it feels.
“Why haven’t you done anything with the place?” he asks, curiously eyeing the shoes poking out of a box by his feet. He lifts a pair of red cowboy boots out with a grimace. “I won’t even ask.”
Trusting comes hard for Draco these days, though, as that lump of grief and angst crushing his chest gets bigger and bigger. Air tastes stale, weighs heavily on his lungs and, when it leaves his body, it cuts his throat like a thousand knives.
When the nightmares claw at Draco’s chest, almost ripping it open with images of blank green eyes, an unmoving chest and scars, he finds this is all wrong.
Pansy greets him with a grin instead of pity this time, and the tightness in his chest loosens a little. She’s not alone, though, and Draco’s eyes are immediately attracted to the familiar figure leaning against his table. Blaise has his hands in his pockets and is carrying a soft smile, looking like everything is right with the world. Draco wishes he had his confidence right now.
