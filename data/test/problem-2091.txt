It was positively repulsive. Seriously. He wanted to gag a million times over at the idea of someone else’s tongues in his mouth. The whole thing was probably like sticking one of Uncle Sev’s pickled slugs in his mouth.
“If you haven’t kissed anyone, how do you know you like it?” Draco called after her as she stormed towards the girls’ dorm, making it clear she didn’t want to be around him anymore.
Harry was eyeing him with suspicion and Draco shrugged it off. He was used to Potter and his friends looking at him like that. They always did and he knew he returned the look.
Draco considered this and decided to agree because he wanted to get this over with. He wanted to know. He needed to know.
Older students seemed to want to escape away to various corners in the castle and kiss each other. With tongues. They would kiss for long amounts of time and run their hands up each other’s backs and arms… but why?
“Because, I want to know what it’s all about and we hate each other, so we won’t go all touchy-feely and giggly as everyone seems to when they kiss each other. Think about it, a kiss without losing our minds,” Draco said, shuddering as he thought about the way the older students talked to each other when they kissed.
Harry nodded, using his wand to disengage the lock on the door of the cage. He pocketed his wand, not wanting to frighten the rabbit further.
“Do you want Dada to beg?” his voice dropper lower, thicker, “make your Dada beg to fuck you the way you want—the way we
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, leaning into his touch. Pain was etched across his handsome features, his jaw clenched tight.
Draco sifted his fingers through Scorpius’ hair, smiling. “I see it got in his hair, too,” he said wryly.
Truthfully, he didn’t want to know the sex yet. His pup’s rapidly approaching arrival weighed heavily on his mind nowadays and he found himself unable to quell the anxious thoughts that plagued him when he was alone. It was better if he didn’t know the sex yet. He didn’t want to think about it right now.
Jack Ryker, one of Harry’s lead Aurors, must have assigned him to guard duty for the evening as a way of easing him into Auror work.
“I know, I need a shave, don’t I, Scorpius?” Harry chuckled when Scorpius slid his stubby fingers higher and tried to poke at his teeth.
She walked around the kitchen island and brushed past Harry, shooting him a warning look as she passed.
Harry pulled away with a gasp, standing up and taking a step back. He tucked his waning erection back into his trousers and shoved a hand through his hair.
He looked down, noticing that Draco had one small hand still clutching his stuffed wolf on the floor, his small body shaking underneath of Harry.
He had used a disposable Muggle camera to take them. He had taken them all when Draco had been unaware. In this particular photo, Draco was noticeably pregnant. He had fallen asleep in Harry’s office on the sofa, his jumper tight against his rounded stomach.
Harry brought a glass of water, setting it down next to Draco’s plate. “Should I get juice for Scorpius?”
Draco jerked out of his arms, turning to glare up at him, unshed tears blurring his vision. “Just stay
The thick, heady alpha pheromones were messing with Draco’s head and Potter’s proximity wasn’t helping. He was hard beneath his trousers and to his utter horror, he felt a trickle of warmth leak from his hole.
For the past few days, he had been experiencing twinges of pain in his lower back. It was steadily worsening, the twinges turning into
This was exactly what he’d been trying to avoid for most of his adult life. Being a slave to his Alpha instincts, wanting nothing more but to please and impress his delicate Omega mate.
Harry hovered just above him, gazing down at him with hooded eyes. “If I untie you, will you play nice?”
“Well, there you go. You’re not a total idiot. Now run out back and fetch me the bin of potatoes. They brought a shipment in this morning and I forgot to bring them in.
Ginny set down her stirring utensil and walked over to Harry, leaning over his shoulder to peck him on the cheek. “I will,” she wrapped her arms around his neck, leaning further in, “what’s new with the Ministry?”
”Do you forgive Dada?” Harry whispered, pressing kisses along the boy’s ear and then lower, to his neck.
treasured at the moment. He felt like a trapped animal, awaiting a most horrible fate that he knew would eventually befall him.
When Draco felt fingers intertwine with his own on the sofa cushion next to him, he startled and looked down. Harry held his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze.
He didn’t want to think about who he was becoming anymore. He just wanted to forget about everything.
“What’s wrong? Are you too tired to walk?” His gaze briefly dropped to his belly. “Is the pup all right?”
that my husband is missing, Potter. I wouldn’t even be here, entertaining some stranger while we discuss my body’s current biological needs. It’s embarrassing and I needn’t be reminded of the cause of this situation.”
It would make sense for him to choose Roland to be his alpha substitute for the duration of his pregnancy.
Harry snorted and reached down with one hand, unzipping the front of his trousers, pulling out his long, thick cock. It was hard, the head beading with pre-cum.
. I’m keen to see how my little Omega pleases himself when I’m not there to stuff you full of my cock.”
Harry placed both of large hands on the boy’s narrow hips, sinking his claws into the soft, pale skin.
Packing away the last of his belongings in his dresser, he hid the small canister of mixed herbs that his mother had given him for his heats in one of the top drawers.
Harry looked down, noticing that he had snapped his pen in half in his hand, dark ink dripping onto his fingers and desk.
Truthfully, he didn’t need the money. He was more than well off and could retire completely if he chose to. He found he was adept at writing, however, and it kept his mind busy.
He tried to blame his shameful feelings on their forced bond and his pregnancy, but it wasn’t just that anymore.
Harry’s prick prodded against the rim of his hole from behind, his slick making his shaft slide sinuously against it.
Harry scooped him up and Draco reluctantly nuzzled up into his throat, staining Harry’s black button-down with hot tears. Harry allowed it, lowering his head to allow Draco better access to his scent glands.
Draco felt a tendril of warmth form inside of his chest for the kind man. At least Pansy was in love with someone who was so kind.
They didn’t feel swollen with milk, nor were they leaking. His nipples also weren’t sore, and he didn’t feel a milk let-down like he usually did in the mornings before nursing Scorpius.
Harry growled, dropping down and allowing Draco to wrap his arms around his neck. The boy pulled back to look at him, his eyes flicking down to Harry’s lips.
Draco released a shuddering breath before responding. “It upset me because I wondered what the hell happened to you. You were happy in the photo, I could tell.”
Before he had left the room, he had taken one of Draco’s pillowcases. It had been covered in his scent, the scent of his slick also blessedly still prevalent upon it.
Draco sat, bristling at being ordered around like a dog. He kept his eyes on Harry as he walked over and disappeared into a room at the back of the kitchen.
Another tear escaped, sliding down her cheek. “I still love him, you know,” she said hoarsely. “He was my best friend. My family.”
Auror Thorne brandished his wand, using it to unlock the reinforced door. It slid open with a heavy groan.
Hermione went quiet, staring at the envelope in her hands. A few tense minutes passed before she looked up and nodded resolutely.
in love and since Harry was his first for everything, he couldn’t really process his feelings as a normal person in love would.
To think that this delicate boy had tried to fight Ministry soldiers was an almost comical image to him.
With his hatred burning away any niggling feelings of instinctual protectiveness, he took a long drag of his cigarette.
“Didn’t mean to frighten you, little one,” he said, walking over to the mare and giving her neck a firm pat. “She’s one of our gentler ones. Likes to be petted, unlike the master’s stallion.”
Draco let out a relieved hiccup and burrowed closer, feeling some relief as Harry’s pheromones calmed him.
Draco pulled his wrist away from Harry’s fingers and he could have sworn Harry had briefly tightened his grip before letting go.
Draco was babbling incoherently beneath him, a string of unintelligible nonsense that had Harry licking at his nape, his teeth scraping the boy’s
He suddenly imagined Harry licking his swollen breasts after trying to get his pup to breastfeed and he felt his cheeks grow unbearably hot.
He was making the house-elf monitor him closely. He wasn’t sure what to think of it. He wasn’t sure if Harry was really worried about his pregnancy or
The fine, blond hairs on Draco’s arm were soft beneath his touch and he couldn’t help but yearn for their skin to touch again in other places.
able to get him pregnant? Would he tear away his babe from his breast, keep the baby within arm’s reach as a means to get Draco to do as he wished?
Draco thought back to that morning and what Harry had admitted. If he accepted Harry’s offer to be with him, his dream of being independent would just get that much further away.
”Look, all I’m saying is that they’re a definite help at home. Ever since Hermione and I adopted Pansy, we’ve been able to spend more time together as a family while Pansy takes care of the menial stuff around the house. It’s a win-win, Harry. They get protection from a carnivore and we get their undying loyalty.”
He didn’t want to be back in London where everyone knew what happened to him. His name was synonymous with his captor’s now and it had taken years for his unwanted fame to finely wane.
The girl was same height as him and roughly the same age, maybe a bit older. Draco couldn’t help but stare at her as she seasoned the raw meat.
Draco’s blood went cold, keeping his gaze averted. “W-what do you mean, Harry? I could have said anything. I was in
“We’ve already got an owl,” Draco responded, setting another parchment aside. He preferred to grade by hand because, despite his beliefs as a child, he knew magic
Harry sat beside her in front of the fire and crossed his legs. He felt strangely underdressed, sitting there in his flannel pyjama bottoms and his ratty t-shirt. He had the feeling he’d feel just as underdressed in a three-piece suit, but that was neither here nor there.
Draco snorted and waved his wand to light the candles on the table. He set his wand aside and picked up his utensils. Harry watched nervously as Draco cut into the fish on his plate and took a bite.
When Harry had invited Hermione out to Hogsmeade’s Christmas market, he had expected a lot more scolding, or at least a single mention of Draco and the ring on Harry’s finger. Instead, there was nothing.
“No, thank you. Those have never worked very well on me.” Harry picked at a loose thread hanging from the hem of his shirt. “I just walk around until I get tired enough to fall asleep…”
“Yes,” he said. “She’s the Black girl with the hair.” He pushed his glasses up again. “Is she still there?”
And so it went. They played for what felt like hours, with questions as small and meaningless as “What’s your favourite colour,” to questions as serious as “Does your Mark ever hurt anymore?” Both of them were competitive and stubborn enough not to pass as long as the other didn’t, so the bag of Every Flavour Beans sat forgotten on the floor, until:
Ginny glowered at him for a moment and then, to Harry’s immense surprise, laughed and pulled Draco into a short hug.
Dumbledore twinkled cheerfully at Harry from his frame, and beside him was Snape, scowling at Harry like he’d just blown up a cauldron in Potions class.
Freedom is moving past their roles, their Houses, their pasts. Everyone expects Harry Potter, Killer of Voldemort; Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World; Harry Potter, the Hero. Freedom is forgetting past expectations. Harry Potter is someone Harry’s never been, has never wanted to be, and never will be. But when Harry goes home, sees Draco asleep on their sofa after a long day at work, Harry knows this is freedom. Freedom is knowing Draco loves Harry more than he’s ever loved Harry Potter.
“I thought you would’ve had enough of all that,” Malfoy said, but he didn’t protest as Harry sat down opposite him.
“I don’t understand why we couldn’t just stay indoors,” Draco muttered, shoving his hands into his pockets and tucking the bottom half of his face into his scarf.
She held out the pot of Floo Powder. Harry shrunk his trunk and shoved it deep into his pocket before taking a handful of powder.
“I don’t think this is going to be good,” murmured Harry. “Maybe you should let me go from here on my own.”
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but the words wouldn’t come. He let Draco pull him into his arms and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, breathing in the smell of Draco’s cologne and the drizzle that had managed to soak them both.
“Harry, this could end very badly. You do know that? I worry that you’re getting in over your head,” she said. “Battling Dark wizards is one thing, but you’ve been obsessed with Malfoy since we were students, and I don’t think this is coming out of nowhere for him either.”
I am currently on a bus, the same bus I have been on for about five and a half hours, so I apologize for any typos. Enjoy! :D
Harry drummed his fingers on the tabletop as he waited for Hermione to return, and she did, carrying a pudding that was entirely too big for two people--assuming one of those people wasn’t Ron. She cut him a slice and set it in front of him before doing the same for herself. They ate in silence until Harry decided to speak.
"I never said I wasn’t afraid," Harry said earnestly. "I thought that walk through the forest was going to be the last walk I ever took. I thought the last thing I was ever going to see was Voldemort and his Death Eaters and that green light. That was the scariest thing I ever had to do, but the idea of losing one more person I loved was so much worse than death.
“Oh, be quiet,” Draco said, unshrinking their suitcases and unpacking them with a wave of his wand. He sat on the bed. Harry sat beside him, barely able to restrain a groan at how comfortable the bed was. Draco laughed.
Maybe Draco was trying to drive him mad. Harry was fine with that, he wished Draco had the courtesy to do it at a time later than eight am.
“This is not the life I wished for you to have,” said Lucius. “Engaged to a Half-blood, working with Muggles, living in a flat in the middle of a Muggle neighbourhood...it’s an embarrassment to our name.”
“You’re not really selling me on this whole ‘home cooked meal’ thing.” Draco unfolded his napkin and laid it on his lap. Harry sat down and did the same.
“You are no longer in control of my life, father,” Draco responded. “I wanted you to be sure of that.”
“It was a call to France. I definitely had to hang up on my mum like that,” said Draco. “Besides, I still don’t know why revising has led to you hiding in a telephone booth--
This picture kind of makes me dizzy, but I had a good laugh when I figured out what was going on. Thank you for reading!
The words came out in a rush and Harry felt his face heat in embarrassment. He looked away. Draco stayed quiet for a long moment, until Harry finally looked up at him.
“Because after it’s all over, you’re going to be standing next to me, and I can’t have my students’ parents thinking you’re anything less than brilliant.”
“I thought I’d come by to say hello to Myrtle,” Harry said, gripping the sink with one hand and rubbing what was going to become a painful lump on the back of his head with the other.
Harry smiled across the table, taking in the way the candles on the table made Draco’s eyes glimmer.
," Harry mumbled as Draco straightened his robes. "I’m shit at those charms, anyway. You know that."
They were both quiet for a long moment. Harry could feel the warmth of Malfoy’s body through the wool of his sweater. He couldn’t remember either of them moving closer, but they must have at some point. They hadn’t been that close at the beginning, surely.
So I've never actually been to a Christmas market. They're not really a thing where I live? They sound fantastic, though.
Harry ran the feather of his quill against his chin. It’d never been so hard to write to Ron before. He couldn’t tell him about the situation with Malfoy. To be honest, he wasn’t really even sure what the situation was himself.
“It’s been months since any of us other than Hermione from heard from you!” Ginny said angrily. “You couldn’t even send a post card?”
“Mr. Potter, could I speak with my son for a moment?” Lucius asked, smile still very much in place. “Alone?”
“You said the lights were made by electricity, yeah?” Draco asked, looking around in wonder at the lit windows and fairy lights.
“I’m sure you’ll be able to think of something,” Draco said. “Especially considering the way you decorated our house this Christmas; I thought you’d gone a bit mad, to be honest.”
As he speaks, it occurs to him that he probably wouldn't have told Ron and Hermione. He wouldn't have been able to deal with their concern, their sadness. Draco has gone from hating Harry to protecting him. He's asked to hear the story. He wants to know. Ron and Hermione wouldn't have asked. They wouldn't have wanted to know.
Harry rolled his eyes, but gripped his cane more tightly. “You’ve never had his cooking, Draco, and I can think of
"Then what were you going to say? What was so important that you being raised as a sacrifice was okay?"
There were, apparently, only so many times a person would take “we just grew apart” as the reason for breaking up with their sister.
“Fine! It’s because of the ferret thing!” he snapped, throwing up his hands and spinning to face Harry. “If you’d been turned into a bloody rodent, you wouldn’t be too fond of them either!
“I know I’ve worked at a Muggle school for over a year, but I’m still very impressed by what they can do with electricity.”
Draco paused, glared, and then resumed straightening Harry’s tie. Harry reached up and stilled Draco’s nervous hands.
Draco wasn’t meant to like phoenixes. He wasn’t meant to like any fire at all, because fire melted ice, turned it to water, made it unsteady. Draco’s father would call it weak.
Ginny had, for the first time in months, spoken to him to invite him to the Burrow. Harry hadn't looked at her, hadn't looked up until she'd sighed softly and left. Draco stays behind as well, unsure if it's because he doesn't want to go to the Manor, or if he's doing it to look after Harry.
“If there’s anything I’ve never doubted about you, Harry, it was whether you were brave enough.” Narcissa smiled again. “Sleep well, and don’t forget to put the fire out before you go.”
“Have they?” Draco asked, crossing his arms over his chest. Harry didn’t miss the smile on his face. He snorted.
Harry sits atop the Astronomy Tower and just stares. He stares out over the grounds and tries not to remember. If he closes his eyes, he can see Snape pointing his wand and whispering, on Dumbledore's orders,
“Setting fires, I see,” Draco said from behind Harry, closing the door to the Astronomy Tower. “You know, a Warming Charm would be a much safer option.”
He could always tell when people noticed Draco, blond, poised, and unmistakably Malfoy, standing beside him. Their expressions darkened, like the sky darkening just before an unexpected storm. Even after all these years, they didn’t trust him. And Draco knew it. Everyone did.
For the rest of the holidays, they share a bed so Harry can sleep, and Draco realizes that he sleeps better as well.
“Harry, you defeated the Dark Lord, you fought off a basilisk at the age of twelve. Surely, my parents aren’t nearly as bad as all that.”
“We’ve been...civil with each other for the past few weeks,” Draco said carefully. “We’re the only two who opted to return for our final year of studies.”
“I think I would’ve preferred a Howler, to be honest,” Harry muttered, carefully picking up the parchment. At least he thought it was parchment. It was practically translucent and, knowing Narcissa, was probably made of pure silver.
“And Harry,” Narcissa said, releasing her son. She smiled at him and stepped forward, hesitated for a moment, and then pulled Harry into a hug as well. Harry stiffened and then, with an encouraging nod from Draco, hugged her back.
Harry’s head snapped up so quickly that he felt his head collide with the headboard. Scowling, he asked, “Is that really important right now?”
All of these people had lost so much more than Harry had, yet here he was, being lauded as brave and selfless, when in reality he had been none of those things.
“It’s a telephone booth,” Harry said. “You go in to make a phone call if you need to contact someone while you’re out and can’t afford a mobile.”
With a small smile, Draco kissed the corner of Harry’s mouth. "Just stay close to me and everything will be alright," he said, leading them out of the rain and down the stairs.
about it, even though I know they want to. It’s driving me absolutely mad. I thought you might want to talk about it.”
Just a heads up that yesterday's chapter changed after I initially posted it, so maybe give it a look to make sure you know what's going on.
“Mother owled the portkey today,” Draco said casually without looking up from whatever he was pretending to read. “She told me it’s set to activate on the twelfth, but that we’re welcome any time before then, of course.”
Harry elbowed him and then settled his head on Draco’s shoulder. They sat in silence for a while, enjoying the warmth and the stillness of the room. Harry thought it smelled a bit like peppermint, and wondered if that was a charm he could learn, or if he’d have to burn those weirdly expensive candles Aunt Petunia liked so much.
The bed is burning, burning hotter than any fire Draco's ever felt, and for a second he feels afraid. The fire doesn't hurt when he touches it. It doesn't burn as he climbs through the flames, into the bed, and pulls a surprisingly—terrifyingly—cold Harry to his chest. And the flames stop.
“We don’t have to do anything, Draco, especially if you don’t want to,” Harry said. “It’s just a Christmas party.”
Draco set his glass aside and picked up the box. He could guess what was inside—there were few things that involved being asked something in front of a crowd. Smiling slightly at Harry, he carefully tore the paper from the box and opened it.
“All the more reason to enjoy it!” Draco shot a grin over his shoulder, and Harry knew in that moment exactly what he was going to do.
Harry was always complaining about being too warm, mostly because Draco was always complaining about being too cold. Even though they turned the heat down at night, and even though all the extra blankets were on Draco’s side of the bed, Harry insisted on sleeping with his shirt off. Not that Draco minded, of course. Harry was quite nice to look at, and to be fair, sleeping next to him did occasionally feel like sleeping beside a furnace.
“Yes, well, you’d better do it soon then,” Draco said, nodding towards Hagrid’s hut. Harry looked up and saw Hagrid waving from his doorway, looking troubled.
He walked without knowing where he was going, until he ended up in a clearing in the Dark Forest, surrounded by the trees, the smell of the earth, and the
The Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Godric’s Hollow was something Harry had tried to attend in the past three years since the end of the War. That first Christmas had been so hard for everyone it hadn’t really felt like Christmas.
“Draco mentioned that you occasionally have difficulty sleeping,” Narcissa said after a moment. “I can get you a sleeping draught, if you would like.”
“You’ve never been one to do what anybody asked,” said Harry, pointedly avoiding Malfoy’s gaze as he hastily gathered his things. “I have to go. I’m going to be late to Defence. See you around, Malfoy.”
Draco leaned down and pressed a kiss to Harry’s lips. Then, slowly, he pushed Harry’s shirt up and up and up until he could see.
“Draco, I don’t know why you’re worrying so much about how I look. We both know everyone’s going to be focused on you,” Harry grumbled, lifting his chin slightly so Draco could do up his bowtie
Crossing the room, Draco held his hand out expectantly. With a sigh, Harry took Draco’s it and stood. The last time he’d done this, he was fourteen and considerably shorter. He’d led, then, and to say it was an unmitigated disaster would be putting it lightly.
Harry sat on his bed as he watched Draco look around his room. Draco was, Harry realised, much more polite in his exploration than Harry was with his. Still, Harry nervously chewed his lip as Draco bent slightly at the waist to get a closer look at the photographs on Harry’s dresser.
"What's going on?" Draco asks, even though he can feel the heat pouring from the room. In that moment, he doesn't care what's going on; getting to Harry is the only thing on his mind as he pushes open the door.
of his cane against the stone floors. It was freezing, but Hogwarts was always cold in the winter. At least that bit hadn’t changed.
“I thought I’d go back to my warm and friendly manor and help my mother decorate for the holidays whilst we ignore the fact my father’s rotting away in Azkaban.”
"I’m not a child! Stop scolding me!" Harry flinched at the feeling of Draco’s hand on his shoulder, but finally found the courage to look him in the eye.
Harry walked up his stairs, leaning heavily on his cane. After a day of running around to different shops with Draco, his legs were aching. He was so, so tired.
“We should get a pet,” said Harry, breaking the comfortable quiet of the room. Draco looked over at him from where he sat on the couch, a stack of essays in his lap, waiting to be marked.
unusual was for Draco to be able to lie beside Harry, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest as he slept.
"I hate this place," Draco said suddenly, moving to stand beside Harry. Harry looked over at him, but Draco kept his gaze forward. Harry looked away.
Draco ran his fingers over the silver ring on his right hand. Then, he slipped it off and held it out to his father. “Not you, father; simply the ideas that have poisoned this family for generations.”
He paused, taking in the scene before him. The lights in the living room were off, and everything was bathed in the dim glow coming from the Christmas tree. There were two glasses and a small, neatly wrapped box sitting on the coffee table in front of Harry, who was smiling shyly.
Harry paused, wondering when speaking civilly with Malfoy twice in one week became something that felt almost
When their classmates return, Draco resumes sleeping in his own bed. Two nights into the start of term, he feels restless, and wakes to the headache he's learned to associate with Harry. Without stopping to slip on his dressing gown, he bolts from his room. Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Ernie are standing outside of Harry's door, looking worried.
“No, of course not,” Harry snapped, and then ran a hand through his hair. “This shouldn’t be so hard. Do we want to spend Christmas with your parents or not?”
“You’re up to something. That’s definitely your ‘up to something’ face. I remember it from school,” Draco said, but he sat beside Harry on the couch anyway.
The War had ended seven months ago, and Harry wasn’t sure how to move on. Nobody was sure how to move on. The trials were finished, the castle had been rebuilt, but everything still felt wrong. It was as if someone had moved everything in Harry’s life slightly to the left, and then had pushed him from a cliff.
Nevertheless, Harry and Draco found themselves corralled through the crowd of reporters, forced to pose before camera after camera. Harry could tell the photographers were irritated by how close Draco and Harry stood; the proximity made it impossible for the photographers to get a shot of Harry without Draco. But until Harry asked, Draco would not move. Unfortunately for the photographers, Harry would never ask.
I hope you enjoyed! Thank you for reading! Also, I took some ~artistic liberty~ with the prompt photo. I am aware that the plant on the card in the picture isn't holly, but mistletoe. It just didn't work with the plot.
“How you go back and forth like that. I’ve only ever known English.” The man pushed his glasses up with the side of his hand and grinned up at Draco. “You didn’t have to hang up on your mum like that.”
“You brought me all the way up to the coldest room in the castle, at twelve in the morning, to play a game.”
"The people I loved were dying! That’s what was so important! If my death was going to stop others from dying, then I was okay with finding out I’d been betrayed by one of the few people I’d trusted in my life. I just wanted everyone to stop dying because of me!"
as everything came rushing back. He could smell the smoke that had hung thick in the air as the fires burned, could feel the sting of the curses that had just barely missed him, could see the worn faces of the people who were too young, too old, too
“Another night in the infirmary.” He pulled the door open and murmured, “Thank you, Potter,” before slipping inside and closing the door behind him.
Harry flushed apologetically and undid the dark blue ribbon around Narcissa’s note as Draco strode from the room. Narcissa’s handwriting was perfect and elegant where it curled and looped across the page in dark ink. It was a shame it was so beautiful, really. It made Harry feel worse for not wanting to read it.
Harry scowled up at Draco and wordlessly handed him the letter he held. Taking it, Draco read the letter quickly and then sat beside Harry on the stairs.
"My mother…she made her choice, she knew what would happen if the Dark Lord figured out she'd lied. None of us blame you. We all made our choices."
“I feel like we haven’t had a quiet moment to ourselves in ages,” Harry sighed, leaning against Draco on the couch.
Finally, Draco seemed to find what he was looking for. He relaxed, a brief smile gracing his lips and, for a moment, everything felt a little bit easier.
Professor McGonagall broke off as the door to her office opened and Draco walked in, dragging his trunk behind him.
Every time he thought of Draco, he got this strong fluttering in his stomach, not unlike the feeling he’d had with Ginny. Along with with the fluttering came a wave of panic. He’d come to terms with his feelings towards men--he’d spent entirely far too long thinking about Cedric in the Prefects’ Bath--but there was a difference between
me!” said Hermione angrily. “I’ve been looking for you all day, and you show up in a bloody telephone booth?”
Surprisingly, Draco laughed at that and, taking his hand from Harry’s, lifted Harry’s chin. “You need to relax and you need to
that had permeated the world around him, Draco took a walk. It was dawn, and Draco was unable to sleep, afraid of what he’d see.
"You always seem to forget magic exists when you’re nervous." Draco briefly lifted his gaze to meet Harry’s.
“My chest, it’s not--” Harry took a steadying breath. “You know what happened in the forest. Your mother must have told you.”
A friend of mine had a wolf-dog hybrid, and she was the most gorgeous, sweetest dog! Also, another short update today, but hopefully they'll get a little longer soon! Thanks for reading!
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry muttered, forever uncomfortable with the idea of having a life debt owed to him. He leaned against the wall. “Are you alright?”
“Honestly, I don’t understand why you’ve made me change into these clothes.” Draco pulled at his jumper.
“I think it’s beautiful,” Draco said, kissing his way over Harry’s chest and up his neck, loving the way Harry’s heartbeat fluttered against his lips.
Hermione sighed sympathetically. “I do, Harry, but it still hurt to find out nearly two years after the fact that you’d been with Draco. Especially after everything that happened....” She trailed off, but before Harry had a chance to respond, she stood and asked, “Do you want some plum pudding? Molly sent it over.”
The door clicked softly shut behind her, and Harry let out a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding.
Harry turned to see Draco standing in the doorway, looking perfectly at ease in his dressrobes. By now, Harry knew how to look at Draco, knew how to find the emotions Draco had always been so good at hiding away. He was worried.
“I assumed it’d be something like...new curtains. I didn’t expect it to look…” Harry trailed off, unsure of how to finish. The house didn’t look inviting, really, but no longer did it look like a dark, impenetrable fortress, either. He relaxed slightly and gave Draco's hand a quick squeeze.
Draco moved to stand behind Harry and grasped his right wrist. Harry tried to pull his hand away, confused, and turned slightly to ask Draco what he was doing, but Draco just gave him a small smile.
Draco stopped, pulling back. His hair was mussed, and he was nearly panting, and Harry was momentarily stunned that
“Finished!” Draco said proudly as he walked through the door. “Merlin, I thought that week would never end!”
Their hug was far shorter than the hug between her and her son, and much less comfortable, but Harry appreciated it nevertheless.
Another door was pushed open and Harry felt a cool mist on his face. He fell back against the door and breathed in the smell of rain. Slowly, his breathing calmed and he opened his eyes to see Draco standing before him, hair falling into his face.
“It’s going,” said Ron shortly, still glaring at Draco. “I’m actually running late. I’ll see you...I’ll see you.”
So I've never had Christmas Pudding (yayyy Americans) and didn't know if it was something only eaten on Christmas Day, so forgive me if this is a little bit...wrong.
“With you, it usually does.” Draco turned and rummaged through his bag, but managed to catch the face Harry made. “Your face is really an open book, Harry. How you managed to get away with anything is beyond me.”
Okay, maybe snowing sideways wasn't the prompt, but I saw that pic, and my midwesterner heart was like "Oh god." Thank you to everyone who read yesterday! It was a thrill to read the comments this morning. I don't know if I'll be able to respond to all of them, but I will when I can!
“You’re great with each other,” Andromeda corrected. “Though the both of you are entirely too skinny. I knew it was a bad idea to have two young men trying to cook for themselves. You probably live on biscuits and tea—“
“It does. I’m not going to force you to stay a week at my parents’, especially for Christmas, if you don’t want to. My god, I can’t even imagine the whining.”
Harry held out a jacket. “I’m not going to deal with the looks we’re likely to get if you’re walking around in a wizarding robe, Draco. We’re bound to get enough with my cane and your elfin features.”
Harry licked up his hole, his tongue laving Draco’s perineum with long, wet licks and then doing the same to his swollen sac.
The rabbit would let out high-pitched whines, begging to be taken out. Harry would always eventually give in, taking the rabbit to sleep with him in his bed.
Draco’s own prick was hard underneath his joggers, but he didn’t even care. The shared bond was the most intoxicating thing he had ever felt. To feel his mate’s most secret, inner feelings was the most pleasurable thing he had ever felt in his life.
She froze in her hurried movements and turned to face him. Dropping to her knees before him, she took his face between both of her elegant hands and looked into his eyes.
The small boy couldn't have been older than fourteen. He had longish platinum blond hair, several sweat-dampened strands sticking to his pale cheeks and forehead. His full, pink lips were slightly parted, shallow breaths making his chest rise and fall.
”I didn’t mean to corner you like this, Draco. I’m sorry again that I took you by surprise. Please know it wasn’t my intention to interrupt...” Harry’s green eyes flicked down to Scorpius, “feeding your pup.”
“I know how this must sound, Mione, but there’s…evidence. Along with Harry’s confession, Kreacher corroborated his story after Harry released him from his servitude to the Black family. Draco was not Harry’s mate; he was his prisoner.”
“You’re so perfect for me, sweetheart,” Harry panted, driving his cock into Draco’s hole as he chased his own orgasm. “Fucking beautiful and all
“On the contrary, Lucius,” Harry interjected. “Draco is an adult and he’s allowed to make his own decisions. If you must know, I went to check on Draco last night. I was only trying to make sure he was safe. I asked to escort him back here to put my mind at ease. If Draco wishes to divulge more, that’s up to him.”
Roland shrugged, dusting off a piece of invisible lint from his suit jacket. “Some of us work directly for the Minister, not that you would understand.” He paused, smirking. “Well, I suppose I understand why
”Be careful, Omega,” Potter whispered darkly, tipping Draco’s chin up with his fingers. “I went easy on you this time. Perhaps I should pick up my riding crop and
When his tongue met the boy’s wet hole, he couldn’t stop. He raised one hand to spread the boy’s cleft, almost shifting at the sight of his cute, pink hole as it contracted before his rapt gaze.
in the Wizarding World. Draco and the innocent baby that would grow in his womb would be dependent on Harry. The fetus would need Harry’s magic near it at all times.
“I know you were special to Harry, even if he refuses to tell me what happened to you. I also know that my family probably had something to do with your death.”
She was two years old, but didn’t speak. After his husband’s disappearance, she had stopped speaking completely.
him, either. Maybe that was the hardest thing to accept. Even though Harry was his mate and the father of their pup, he now knew the truth.
They probably looked mental, dopily grinning at each other in that moment. Scorpius was playing in his overdone eggs with his hands, blissfully unaware that his parents were hopelessly in love with each other.
“As I recall, you like being naked. In fact, I remember how eager you were for us both to be naked together. Do
”You can change back whenever you feel comfortable enough to do so, sweetheart. Dada won’t hurt you.”
Even if he continued on with life, ignoring Hermione’s letter and the awful things that had happened to him, there would always be a part of him that
He hooked one hand under Draco’s knee closest to him and spread him open, dropping his head between his legs to devour his hole.
He’d only let himself slip into the boy’s room one time this week. Draco had been asleep, his lovely face relaxed while in repose. Harry could see how swollen his eyes had become from crying all the time. Unable to help himself, he’d leaned down and lapped at the boy’s eyes, the need to heal his hurt unable to be repressed when he was laying right in front of him.
Draco was at Potter Manor under the guise of looking for work to make money for his family back in London. His mother had given him faux paperwork with a pseudonym in place for his last name. While he was working and living in Potter Manor, he was to go by Draco Avery.
Draco wailed shrilly, coming suddenly from Harry’s cruel words. His cum coated both of their stomachs, the sticky liquid tacky between them as Harry continued brutalizing his hole at an unrelenting pace.
A disheveled Narcissa was depicted beside the article, her almost fully white hair tangled and dark circles beneath her eyes. Harry took a long drag of his cigarette, a satisfied smile curling his lips.
Harry lowered his dark head and let his mouth hover over one of Draco’s pebbled nipples. His warm breath gusted over it, making him mewl softly.
Harry smirked and carried two plates with silverware to the table and set them down before returning back to the counter.  “No plans of marriage as of right now. Is it all right if I cut up Scorpius’ food for him?”
Unable to help himself, he began to fantasize that the dildo was Harry, his large cock splitting him open as he snapped his hips in and out. The fantasy seemed to lessen his discomfort, slick gushing out of his hole and covering his trembling fingers and the dildo.
Harry’s eyes moved down, catching on Draco’s twitching tail. A trail of clear, glistening slick had leaked from the boy’s hole, covering his inner thighs and pooling on the blanket under his hips.
“Mummy loves his baby,” Draco cooed, pulling Scorpius close. Scorpius nuzzled into Draco’s scent gland, snuffling contentedly. Draco glanced up at Harry, giving him a small smile. “Thank you for holding him for a moment, Harry.”
. All omegas always have an ulterior motive. They’re good for nothing but laying on their backs and spreading their legs. It’s in their nature to deceive.”
Harry couldn’t remember crossing the room, but he was suddenly on the bed and pulling Draco into his arms. As he pulled the boy up, two trickles of milk leaked from his swollen nipples and slid down his abdomen.
He wanted nothing more than to take out his leaking cock and plunge it into the boy’s tight, wet hole and fuck him while he nursed from him.
”Where are you trying to escape to, boy?” Potter grabbed his hip with one hand and yanked him back over his lap. “There is no escaping
…” Draco lowered his voice; afraid his mother would hear from the next room. “My nipples are still sore from last night. You took too much.”
If he tried to focus on using his magic, the collar would grow warm against his neck, absorbing his frenetic magic into the strange metal before he could even attempt to wield it.
“Oh, my birthday, of course. It must have slipped my mind. The further along I am, the more forgetful I am. I’m sorry, Hermione.”
Harry clicked his tongue. “Do you want me to see you, Draco? Do you want us to touch, skin to skin?”
and began lapping up the boy’s spend and excess breast milk from his flushed skin, groaning low in his throat.
He knew that it wouldn’t be much longer before his body won out and he would be reduced to nothing but a keening, begging
Draco knew his mother’s pregnancy with him had only worked because she had left his father late in the pregnancy. Potions containing his father’s own unique magic essence had attributed to his fetal growth in his mother’s last month of being pregnant with him. She had told him that there were many times she was scared she would lose him, but by some miracle he had survived.
“You don’t have to answer me right now. I know it’s been a rough couple of days for you. Are you feeling better after last night?”
He glanced around, looking for a weapon. There was a magnetic knife holder above the industrial looking stove. The knives stuck to the magnetic strip glinted under the soft light from above, seeming to taunt Draco with their proximity.
“I had an inkling, but I didn’t want to make any assumptions,” she finally said. “I knew you would tell me the truth about Scorpius’ father when you felt comfortable enough to do so, but I’m disappointed you kept something like this from me, Draco.”
Potter brought down his hand in a hard slap right on his aching, wet hole, making him keen around the glove.
“Just wallowing in his own self-hatred,” Theo bit out. “April is approaching. You know how he gets.”
“You act as if you’ve never heard such things. Don’t try to fool me, boy. I know a desperate omega when I see one. You’d rub up against any alpha with a knot that would get you through your heat, as if that little scene with the stable boy wasn’t evidence enough.”
When Ginny disappeared inside, Harry waved his hand in front of his cigarette, igniting it with his magic.
Draco snorted delicately. “My father and I aren’t exactly on speaking terms right now. I’d rather not worry him anymore than I already do…”
Draco lay panting on the bed, covered in sweat, slick, and cum. He dazedly watched as Harry stuck his cum-covered finger in his mouth and sucked. Harry’s eyes closed for a moment, making Draco flush.
“Please, Draco. Call me Harry. I’d say we’re on a first-name basis now, aren’t we? I mean, I’ve pretended to be a werewolf for your son, so that makes us basically family now.” Harry paused, acting as if he were deep in thought. “Or would that make us
The flashback chapter will be after the next chapter, I promise. I’m building up to it, guys! I promise I have a plan. 😌
The flames licked at all of his erogenous zones: his pert nipples, his swollen lips, his aching cock, and his
by him. He would want Draco to move in with him. He would take away his freedom, expect him to give up any independence he had gained since having Scorpius.
Harry’s hands found Draco’s hips, slipping his thumbs under the hem of his jumper and pressing them into his skin.
When he felt Potter’s large hand come down on his backside with a resounding crack, Draco let out a strangled whine, biting down on the glove clenched between his teeth.
He still hadn’t told her the truth about Harry and Scorpius. He didn’t know if he was ready to yet. His mother could probably live with the truth, but his
Narcissa sighed again. “Hmm? Oh, yes. Draco is fine. His heat is upon him and we decided to give him some space until it’s over, so I took Scorpius for a few days.”
“Your magic is rudimentary at best. It’s obvious you didn’t attend any Wizarding school while under your mother’s care. Your attempts to escape the French Ministry of Magic was quite amusing to hear about.”
“Oh, is that so?” Harry asked, baring his teeth in a mock snarl, making Scorpius squeal with delight.
Draco looked up and hiccupped softly before throwing himself forward and wrapping his arms around Pansy.
When he was standing a few steps away from the chair the man was seated in, the man raised his hand and pointed to the spot beside him.
Draco shook his head and averted his gaze. “I’ve never even been kissed…” he whispered hoarsely, fighting back even more tears.
Draco pressed his cheek to Scorpius’ blond head, glaring up at him. “You keep acting like I can’t take care of myself. I’ve been doing fine on my own, you know.”
fault, Draco. It was my instincts. Seeing you in pain, I couldn’t help it. I know it’s not an excuse for my behavior, but please, consider staying here. You and Scorpius will be safe here.”
He wished he could turn back time. He would tell her so many things he’d left unsaid, ask her the questions he would never be able to now.
Hermione pulled a stack of photos from her bag, setting them on her lap. “Well, knowing what your mother has been through, I’m not surprised she wanted to you to remain hidden. I suppose I understand her need to protect you from certain things, being a mother myself.”
“That’s it, show me. Show me how you make yourself feel good, sweetheart,” Harry urged, still fucking into Draco’s hole with fast, wet slaps of his hips.
“You feel so good, sweetheart. So perfect for me,” Harry cooed, leaning forward to cup Draco’s cheek.
Draco let out a high-pitched whimper, cupping his own breasts and squeezing them, milk leaking in thick rivulets from his lovely nipples.
Draco felt blood rush to his ears, anger overtaking him. He turned and threw the soiled washcloth he’d been using to wash Juni’s hands. It hit Harry in the center of his broad chest and fell, plopping wetly to the floor.
He followed Arlen down the corridor off to the side of the reception area and to the lift. Arlen paused, turning to face him.
Anyway, Scorpius slept with them each night and Harry loved finally being a part of his son’s life. Waking up to them both tucked against him felt like a heaven he had never known before.
He let out a short, relieved sigh, casting a small smile in Harry’s direction before continuing. “That’s not all we wanted to talk to you about, Mum.”
Draco reluctantly lowered his gaze to his exposed stomach. Beneath the tip of Arlen’s wand, was a fluttering thing resembling a miniature silvered jellybean.
“Draco, please reconsider. I’m asking you to stay with me. I’ll keep my distance if you want. I won’t even speak to you while you’re here, if that’s what you want, but please, just don’t go.”
He didn’t even finish his sentence, lowering his head to lap at Draco’s wet nipple. The boy mewled, twining one of his arms around Harry’s neck as he licked.
He was clad in just a pair of white pyjama bottoms. He was trembling, a fine sheen of sweat noticeable on his pale skin.
He had wavy dark hair and eyes, much the same as the other witches and wizards depicted in the portraits in the house. The young man in the portrait did not speak to him, content to just stare down at him with solemn eyes, his lips set in a grim line.
With a snarl, he dropped down and began lapping up Draco’s pooled slick, his tongue then moving up the boy’s warm thighs, groaning at the sweet taste. His heat slick was different—
It took several clumsy attempts, but Draco complied, unbuttoning and pushing the shirt down to pool around his small waist.
of Draco, on one of the many nights they had made love. He saw himself from the outside. The reverent way he was gazing down at the boy with undisguised—
He shivered, pressing his nose into Harry’s throat, against his scent gland. The boy nuzzled into his throat, a contended purr escaping him.
“He’s not the same, Draco. All the times I tried visiting him, he was a different person, but I suppose I never really knew what kind of person he was and the…hatred he harbored in his heart. After he went away to Azkaban, I blamed myself for what happened to you. I felt as if it were my fault for not noticing the signs earlier. I was such a fool…”
His hat was suddenly snatched off of the top of his head, making him startle. He whipped around, arching a brow at Blaise.
The room—a study—looked empty at first, but Draco’s eyes snagged on a large form hunched over in a leather sitting chair behind the large mahogany desk in the center of the room.
Harry moved Draco’s trembling fingers lower to gently press them against his lips, his eyes hooded with desire. “Your hands are cold…”
When Harry’s eyes had first locked upon Draco’s pink, leaking nipple, he had felt saliva flood his mouth.
He looked down at Scorpius, smiling softly. His mother had dressed his pup in a small, white short-sleeved button-down with a plethora of dinosaurs adorning the entirety of it. His blond hair was getting longer, curling slightly at the ends around his small ears.
Varying shades of black, dark purple, and maroon were the color choice of decoration it seemed. Heavy velvet drapes covered every window, blocking Draco from the outside world.
Draco flushed, delighting in the feel of Harry’s coarse chest hair rubbing against his oversensitive nipples.
Harry’s pheromones were familiar, heady and potent. Draco’s body craved the magic and pheromones only an Alpha could provide for his pregnancy, but it couldn’t be
Harry roughly pressed his clawed finger into the boy’s slick-covered hole, not caring if he tore the boy’s delicate opening.
That aside, Harry was still upset over Draco’s dishonesty with him and his own wounded pride at being categorized as a
Hermione sighed. “This...” She gesticulated to all of Harry with floundering hands. “Depression, sulking,
Draco gritted his teeth and picked up the toy again, pressing the head of the dildo against his hole.
Draco gave a strained chuckle, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “This must be so off-putting…I’m sorry, Harry.”
of a young Sirius, specific traits of the wizard whose circumstances of death were unknown to Draco.
Draco immediately went to his pup, scooping him from his father’s arms and holding him close. “Oh, how I
The girl sighed loudly and eyed him disapprovingly. “Well, if you’re not going to talk, you can at least help me. Bring me those spices from the rack behind you.”
Ginny had been mature about it. She had said she understood and let him know that she was ready whenever he wanted to talk about the future.
Harry scoffed, releasing his hold on his wrists, placing them flat next to Draco’s head. “Keep telling yourself that, Draco. It won’t change what sins she and her husband have committed. Above of all, the sins committed against my loved ones.”
When Harry had seen the glistening slick coating Draco’s arse and inner thighs, he had released a low groan, his cock unbearably hard beneath his trousers.
“So, you expect me to just be okay with all of this? I don’t even know why you’re being so cruel to me anyway! I’ve never done anything to anyone, and you’re subjecting me to all of this…”
He gently placed his hands on Scorpius’ arms, stopping him from smashing the eggs into further oblivion. “Scorpius, you’re being naughty. Daddy worked hard to make this breakfast for us.”
“G-get off me!” Draco shouted, struggling against his hold and huffing in frustration. “Arlen is gone, so we can stop
His mother arched a brow, regally crossing her legs. “Honestly, Draco, do you think I’m that oblivious?” She paused to take a graceful sip of her tea, giving Draco a sly wink over the rim of the floral-printed ceramic rim. “Believe it or not, I was young and in love once, too.”
Harry covered Draco’s fumbling hand with his own, steadying it. He smirked when the boy blushed. “It’s all right, Draco. It doesn’t bother me.”
Harry let out an amused huff of air against Draco’s ear, making him shiver. “Love?” he spat. “Do you think I
”H-Harry, I’m gonna...” he let out a high-pitched moan when Harry’s fingers circled the back of his upper thighs, his fingertips spreading his cleft open almost painfully wide.
Harry set the phial on his desk and pulled out a small folded letter that had been in the envelope too. He opened the letter, flattening it out on the top of his desk to be able to better read it. That, and his hands were shaking too much to hold it steady as he read.
The boy whined, raising his small hands to burrow his fingers into Harry’s hair. He sifted through his hair, grabbing the base of his pointed ears and gently pinching them between his fingers.
The small boy was currently hiding under his writing desk, trembling. He was completely nude except for his collar and Harry had been trying to coax him out for the past two hours.
In his pale arms, he clutched the stuffed wolf Harry had bought him to his bare chest. He was curled around it, most of his fair skin flushed as he panted in his sleep.
What if Draco’s breast pain came back? What if Scorpius missed his werewolf impression? What if they
“Oh,” Draco said flatly, his jealousy flaring at the mention of Harry’s ex. “You two are back on, then?”
Harry’s face was suddenly wiped of all emotion, his green eyes sad. He tipped Draco’s chin up with his fingers, staring down at him.
His mother supported his interests in the arts and never pushed him to be anything but himself. Without her, his father would surely drag him under and ruin what was left of their reputation and fortune.
He crawled over the trembling boy, his tail brushing between Draco’s inner thighs. His heavy cock hung between them, pressing against the boy’s own slowly hardening prick.
Harry nearly snarled when Draco pulled his nipple from his mouth, leaning forward to chase after it.
Harry seemed amused at his reaction but sighed exaggeratedly. “Let’s just say your parents and I have a convoluted history. Your father was a pompous oaf who got what he deserved.”
A tall man with dark blond hair was leaning against the side of the stall of the mare, a smirk turning up his lips.
Draco pulled back; his thoughts momentarily cohesive when Harry’s words penetrated his haze of lust.
When Hermione left through Floo, Harry led Draco upstairs to his room. Once the door was closed behind him, Harry whirled on him.
She had hexed one nosy reporter from the Prophet after he’d tried scaling the lattice in her garden in an attempt to get a photo of Draco.
Alpha to protect them and to tend to his needs. Perhaps someone younger, not some pining, desperate Alpha in his late thirties...
Arlen sighed, but kept writing. “He’s so different than what the Prophet has portrayed him as in the past. With a moniker like ‘
The words felt brittle on his tongue, hollow and meaningless. It was as if he were being held together by rickety supports, the fastenings around his soul fraying and tenuous.
Blaise was still mad at him about completely ditching him at the festival at Hogsmeade. He had blamed his sudden departure on not feeling well, but it was a better excuse than the truth.
The boy let out a surprised squeak and scrambled backwards, gracelessly falling off the side of the bed, landing with an audible thump against the floor.
She paused, her knife now poised above a slab of bleeding meat, glinting under the recessed lighting from above. “So, if you’re not a fuck toy, what are you, kid?”
“You have done nothing, pet. You are the repentance of your horrid family. The offering. Your pain is my revenge. If you must know, your precious mother was a Death Eater, like your pathetic father.”
“Sorry, Draco. We still have to use the traditional gel to be able to see the embryo better, if it’s there.”
Draco, for some inane reason, blushed. “I-I need an alpha, Potter.” He let out a tired sigh. “It’s getting harder the bigger my pup grows.”
Potter’s green eyes darkened when they flicked down over Draco’s hard nipples, exposed due to his torn shirt.
Draco had let out a whine, shifting restlessly on the bed, seeking out more of Harry’s comforting licks.
He pressed closer to Harry, their bodies becoming flush. He grabbed the lapels of Harry’s jacket and shook his head.
Harry’s hand shot out, grabbing Draco’s wrist and tugging him closer. “The least you could do is look me in my eyes while you tell me of your deception, Draco. Don’t I at least deserve that?”
Harry lifted his hand, cupping his cheek. He lightly slid his thumb along Draco’s cheekbone, and he was helpless not to lean into it.
Harry pulled him closer until Draco was almost in his lap, the boy’s smaller thigh pressed flush against his. He lowered his head, pressing his nose into Draco’s soft hair and inhaling.
“How can that be, Ronald?” Hermione glared up at him, denial surging forth within in her. “I went to visit Draco regularly. He never seemed like…he was being held
“It doesn’t mean anything, Draco. Just this once, I’ll ease your pain and we’ll never speak of it again. As an Alpha, I
would do something like that!” He crossed his arms over his chest, anger burning in his throat. “There, did I
Maybe that had been too direct of a question. Perhaps Draco and his Alpha were going through a rough patch.
He had taken on a lot of hobbies over the years that he had been too afraid to try when he was younger.
The room it was kept in held a number of confiscated magical baubles, weapons, and artefacts that the Ministry had acquired over the years.
Too fast for Draco to track, Potter stubbed out his cigarette on the stall wall before lurching forward and wrapping his long fingers around Draco’s throat.
, Draco. Your body will be at my full disposal. Your womb will act as nothing but a vessel for my seed.”
Draco froze, not looking up at Harry, who he could feel was boring a hole into the side of his head. “S-stressed? I guess…a little bit, but just because I was worried about the pregnancy.”
Before he could react, Potter had closed the distance separating them and had his upper arm in his punishing grasp.
Draco stared up at him, a furrow between his pale brows. After a moment, he released Harry’s hand and nodded.
“I laid Scorpius down in the guest room. I changed his nappy before I did, but I don’t have any extra clothes for him here. Do you think you could bring some the next time you come over?”
It was always Draco’s mother who swept his father’s wrongdoings under the rug and tried to shield him from the truth of what was really going on.
“Hope we’re together forever,” Draco mumbled against his lips, his eyes drifting closed. He turned his head, tucking Scorpius’ head underneath his chin as he settled in for sleep.
Harry rubbed at his jaw with one large hand. “Listen, I know that Lucius Malfoy is infamous in Wizarding Britain, but could you think of anyone specific that would have a personal vendetta against your father?”
His breasts were crushed against Harry’s chest, his sensitive nipples abraded by his shirt. Though his milk supply was low now, he felt himself leak due to the pressure.
After he had come, he had been disgusted with himself. He’d let his baser urges take over and for none other than the bastard child of Lucius Malfoy.
Draco couldn’t meet his eyes, guilt weighing heavy in his heart. “I-I don’t know. I just wanted to be a good mother and I—”
it so badly. To see Draco’s stomach swollen with their litter, his chest becoming engorged with milk to feed their young.
In reparation for Draco’s suffering, the Ministry had begun sending him funds each month to help with his relocation and life adjustment.
Draco’s breath hitched, Harry’s soothing words like a balm on aching heart. He wanted to fall into his arms and beg forgiveness for his hastily spoken words, but his pride held him back.
“I can be a bit late. I hadn’t expected you and Scorpius to stay over and I didn’t want to leave you after last night. I was afraid you wouldn’t feel well when you woke up.”
of you. Don’t try to tell me how I feel. I left Ginny because of my feelings for you and I would leave the Ministry if it meant I could be with you.”
Harry crossed his arms over his broad chest. “I’m not scared of Lucius, Draco. I’d like to take you there, just to make you’re both safe before I leave again.”
”What is it?” Draco snapped, feeling self conscious again under Potter’s seeming scrutiny. “You act as if it’s the most bizarre thing you’ve ever seen, my stomach. Surprised someone wanted pups with the Malfoy brat?”
Draco had stayed in his room most of the time, feeling overly tired. He slept on and off during the day, only waking when Kreacher would get him up to eat. He knew it was because of his pup sapping his energy, but he didn’t mind.
Harry leaned down and daubed his tongue against one strawberry nipple, shuddering. Draco’s breath hitched, his hands burrowing into Harry’s hair and tugging.
Hermione’s breath hitched, a soft sob escaping her. She pulled Draco into an embrace, holding him close.
Harry felt askew in her memories, the sound of his quickening heartbeat deafening as he tried to pull himself out of Narcissa’s mind.
When Harry didn’t make a move to stop him, he continued his path down his Alpha’s neck, nipping at one of his exposed collar bones revealed by the open throat of his dark button-down.
He could feel the rabbit’s nipples against his tongue, the soft little bumps making Harry produce more saliva. The rabbit continued trembling, little satisfied chuffs escaping him.
The man behind the counter had been totally still, but upon hearing Ron’s voice, raised his head. His movements were stilted and eerie, like a marionette being controlled by strings.
Draco knew that he had stolen time from Harry and Scorpius to bond as father and son, and he felt awful about it.
“Please don’t be afraid to call me that. All I’ve wanted was to be your and Scorpius’ Alpha and when you call me that, it makes me feel…
Draco let out a choked whimper, his lips parting in surprise. Harry shoved his tongue into Draco’s mouth, swiping it against his own. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s abdomen, pulling him closer. Draco didn’t know where to put his hands, so he rested them against Harry’s broad chest.
can provide. I can smell the slick between your legs, little one. Even if your mind doesn’t want me, your
“W-wait,” Draco pressed a hand against Harry’s chest. “Couldn’t you just…rub some of your saliva on them?”
A large silicone dildo sat on the bed next to him. It was impossibly big, maybe even bigger than Harry’s.
His room back at Wiltshire had been decorated with his own art and he loved painting floral pieces and serene depictions of nature. The bare white walls in his room now only served as a reminder of what he was homesick for.
He wrapped one arm around Draco’s waist, tightening his hold and digging his heels into the bed. He began snapping his hips against the boy, fucking into his hole with unrestrained tenacity, his harsh thrusts making the boy fall forward before Harry would drag him back up for more.
He was choked with fury and embarrassment. Grabbing two fistfuls of hay beneath him, he refused to react.
He turned to walk away but ran face first into something solid. He lost his footing on the slick surface of the snow-covered cobblestone street, letting out a tiny gasp in surprise. Two firm arms snaked around his middle, pulling him close and preventing him from falling on his arse.
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, sipping a cup of coffee. His raven hair was attractively styled, his face freshly shaven. Draco’s eyes traveled down his throat and his cheeks suffused with heat. Love bites dotted his muscular neck, distinctive teeth marks against his tan skin. One particularly deep one right on his scent gland.
“Let me,” he murmured, scooping up the doll and handing it to Juni, who immediately grabbed it and squeezed it to her chest with one arm.
He wondered if he would ever feel happiness again, or if this was his payment for his father’s wrongdoings. To remain here, at Potter Manor, with its depressing scenery and dreary atmosphere that seemed to cling to everything on the estate.
Draco cast an apprehensive glance at the open double doors again, waiting for his mother to come back in. They were seated in the parlor at Malfoy Manor.
Harry shook his head. “Don’t feel silly, Draco. I can understand your fear, especially with having a young pup to care for. Like I said, it will be no trouble at all, and it would make me feel better to know you’re safe.”
Octavius let out a derisive snort. “Eh, if you’re serious about wanting him, I’ll also let you know that he’s an Omega. You’ll have to deal with his heat cycles, messy business that is.”
“I know it’s been a difficult adjustment for you, Draco, but I would be grateful if you did this for me. No one will find out and I’ll finish the floors for you in the entrance hall.”
He whimpered, pressing his cheek to the mattress, not wanting the cruel man anywhere near him while unclothed because he knew what would inevitably follow.
“I understand, Harry,” he said softly, Harry’s commanding tone quieting the doubts that always seemed to loop in his mind whenever they were together.
Harry quickly stood and grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair behind his desk before returning to sit next to Draco on the sofa.
after, I’m just saying that when you have children, it brings a lot of things into perspective.” Hermione sighed. “They bring the good out of you, even if you thought there never was any to begin with...”
He sighed, running his fingers through Scorpius’ soft blond hair. Scorpius looked up at him with beseeching emerald eyes.
“How is he doing with sleeping at night?” Harry asked, pressing one last kiss to the tip of Scorpius’ nose as he attempted to wriggle away. He walked over to where Draco stood wringing his hands.
Harry bent and scooped Draco up, carrying him to the bed. He gently deposited him on it, helping him remove his trousers and shoes before quickly shucking off his own clothes.
Now that he was standing in front of him, the scent of whiskey and alpha pheromones entered his nostrils, muddling his sense of awareness and making his body feel...
He knew that Draco was a virgin and felt possessive satisfaction settle over him in thick, proprietary waves.
Surprising him, Harry slowed his thrusts and leaned down, taking Draco’s mouth with his own. It wasn’t rough or commanding. Harry kissed him like they were lovers, lightly tangling his tongue with Draco’s in a playful caress that made his toes curl and his body burn with the remnants of his orgasm.
“Yes, sweetheart?” he murmured, nuzzling his nose against the boy’s soft ears, playfully nipping at them. “Tell dada, tell me.”
The other elephant in the room, was their tenuous relationship. Their bond still wasn’t waning and Draco…didn’t want it to.
Harry’s stubbled cheek was rough beneath his palm, his whiskers abrading the soft flesh of his hand. He let his fingers slide upwards, towards Harry’s hairline. He buried the tips of his fingers into the man’s thick, black hair before he quickly slid his hand back down.
A large hand clamped over his mouth, almost making him drop the bottle of wine. He was pulled backwards, stumbling slightly as he tried to stay upright. The person holding him backed them into the shadowed corridor in front of the sitting area.
Narcissa Malfoy had absconded shortly after the war, avoiding the post-war trials. The Ministry had been searching for her for the past 16 years. Her husband, Lucius Malfoy, had died in Azkaban prison several years ago. Eventually, they’d given up hope of finding Narcissa. It been years and they’d assumed she’d died.
Draco hurried to follow her command, sprinting toward where she pointed and opening the door at the back of the kitchen. Just outside, there were several boxes pressed against the side of the house next to the door. He found the bin of potatoes and lifted it, quickly returning back to Pansy’s side.
Harry wasn’t entirely heartless. He still fed the bond to get them through the worst of it. Small, fleeting touches to Draco’s lower back, or a light brush of his lips against Draco’s forehead before they would leave his home each night.
The Ministry is doing everything in their power to find him and shirking their protection order is just immature.”
Draco had to resist feeding Scorpius whenever he showed signs of wanting to suckle. His chest had become sensitive and swollen with excess milk in the past few weeks, but he was committed to weaning.
The unmated Alpha within Harry could sense Draco’s need for him. Every time he was around the beautiful creature, his Alpha prowled the perimeters of his mind, just waiting to pounce.
it to hurt. The way you were smiling at that fuck when he was touching your stomach…I should go back and strangle him, pet.”
Potter turned his cold gaze back to Pansy. “Take him back to the manor and send him to bed with no supper. Ensure he is
Harry smirked, his eyes still glued to whatever he was reading. “Your wards are laughable, Malfoy. You haven’t gotten any better at protective enchantments since we were back at school.”
“Eh, I understand that. The manor can become a bit stifling.” Theo released his hand and canted his head towards the mare. “Go ahead and try to pet her again, but this time behind the ears.”
He lowered the cup back to his lap, using his other hand to pluck at a loose thread at the hem of his short-sleeved button-down that he hadn’t noticed before. He wound it around his finger, watching as his blood was cut off from the tip.
He didn’t even want to know what his mouth looked like. It had been shoved between Draco’s thighs or clamped around his nipple most of the night.
Everything seemed to be swathed in various shades of grey, from the gloomy rolling hills, to the rocky terrain that surrounded the manor itself.
“Do you need me to suck them?” he rasped, gently circling his sensitive breast with his long fingers and applying light pressure.
Harry gave him a sheepish smile, draping his arm down against the back of the sofa behind Draco’s head.
Draco alongside him. He eventually pulled him into a narrow space between two shops that were lit with strung lights, casting a red and green glow to the darkened area.
”Then leave us alone,” he hissed, not wanting to raise his voice around his daughter. “I don’t need anyone to babysit me, especially some scarred freak who thinks I’m not worth his precious
Draco. He liked his cute pup. He wanted to be with them and take care of them. He wanted to be a part of their lives.
They had made love several times last night, Harry taking him in so many positions that Draco's cheeks heated thinking about it.
He repeated the mantra in his head until his heartrate had slowed back to a normal rhythm and his breathing evened out.
Harry shoved a third finger into Draco’s stretched hole and flattened his tongue under his prick at the same time, teasing the sensitive skin on the underside of his shaft with slow, languid licks without abating the rapturous suction of his mouth.
He bumped into something hard mid-step, almost falling backwards in surprise. Strong fingers wrapped around his upper arms, steadying him and keeping him upright.
Evidently spurred on by Harry’s reaction, the boy slid his fingers up his ears. He pressed both of his thumbs just inside, making Harry’s erection throb with
Draco nodded and closed his eyes as Harry leaned forward and pressed their mouths together. Harry cupped Draco’s cheek, deepening the kiss. When Harry dipped his tongue into his mouth, Draco was helpless not to reciprocate, eagerly sliding his tongue against Harry’s.
“We took this one in the common room at Hogwarts. I think it was the week of a particularly difficult series of exams. That’s probably why we all look knackered.”
A large dark mahogany sleigh bed sat in the center of the bedroom and in the middle of it, laid a curled up Draco.
Harry shook his head. “You’re not, Draco. I’ll come with you and I’ll make dinner for you both tonight. It’s no trouble at all.”
Draco glanced up at him from under his lashes, his pup already asleep at his breast. “All right…as long as it’s no trouble. Thank you, Mr. Potter.”
He had become more reserved after graduation, always looking as if his mind was a million miles away.
“He doesn’t want me, Hermione. In his eyes, I’m an inadequate Alpha. Not good enough to even be completely honest with.”
When he dropped lower to clean the rabbit’s genitalia, the rabbit shot to his feet and bounded to the far end of the bed, his hackles raised in discontent.
When Harry came with a low grunt, Draco’s lips parted against his, whimpering into his mouth as he felt himself being filled with Harry’s semen.
Harry reached up and began unbuttoning the boy’s top himself, his fingers clumsy in their haste to bare him. “I can’t see you in such pain. I’m an Alpha and my saliva can help, you know this.”
Harry often gave him a goodbye kiss when they parted, the kisses usually turning desperate, messy. And the promises Harry would whisper to him while saying goodbye for the night…
Harry’s nostrils flared, a muscle jumping in his jaw. “Come now, pet. After you eat, you’re to go back to bed until your next heat.”
The small rabbit had fallen asleep in his arms on the way home, so he had placed him in the cage atop a small pillow he had found in one of his closets.
Draco bit his lower lip between his teeth, averting his eyes before flicking them back to look up at Harry from under his lashes. “Because I-I don’t want us to l-look at each other.”
Harry began roughly pumping them in and out, spurred on by Draco’s sharp little whines of discomfort.
Draco flushed, averting Harry’s gaze. “He’s, um, not involved in our lives at the moment,” he mumbled.
His skin looked slightly ashen, but other than that, he looked unchanged. The only noticeable difference to his appearance was the mating bite on his neck. Harry’s teeth marks on his throat had healed over, silvered indentions against his pale skin.
He’d been living with his mother and she could be overbearing at times, especially when it came to Scorpius. She coddled and spoiled his son endlessly, but Draco wanted to be independent of his parents.
Hermione smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “You’ll understand when you have children, Harry. You’d do anything for them.
“Ah, Shepherd’s Pie. I’m afraid it’s the only thing I know how to make without completely singeing it. I’m not much of a cook, I’m afraid.”
Harry groaned low, throwing his head back and shifting his legs farther apart to give his Omega better access.
“Said he didn’t have time to give it to you himself. Looked like he’d been crying. Didn’t have the baby with him this time.”
Draco snorted, hitching Juni higher on his hip. “When have they ever erred on the side of caution? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to give my daughter a bath. I expect you to be gone when I come back out.”
Kingsley exchanged a glance with Ron before clearing his throat. “He’ll be tried,” he said gruffly. “He aided in the escape of a prisoner of Azkaban and he’s admitted to abusing his assigned Omega. We’ll question Draco Malfoy when he’s in a more stable condition and if he confirms Harry’s admission, he’ll be sentenced.”
Harry knew he should leave the bedroom. A sexual relationship between a carnivore and an herbivore was strictly forbidden. He was putting himself and the boy at risk if he gave in.
He folded himself over the small boy, curling an arm under Draco’s chest and yanking him up. With his chest to the boy’s back, he started snapping his hips against his rabbit, slamming his cock deep each time.
Harry was sleeping soundly next to him, his arm curled protectively around the swell of Draco’s belly. Their pup bounced around in his stomach, blissfully unaware of what kind of person their father was.
on one of the knives from the magnetic strip above the stove and it flew to his open hand. He promptly dropped it and it clattered to the floor in front of Draco.
He rearranged his features, slipping into the persona of congenial host. With his mask firmly in place, he made his way to the Floo.
Narcissa’s blues widened slightly, sharing a reproachful look with his father. “Well, I wasn’t expecting guests. Hello again, Mr. Potter. Lucius, darling, remember how I was telling you that Mr. Potter was helping with the investigation?”
Ron led Harry down to the bowels of the Ministry, to Level Ten beneath the Wizengamot Court Chambers.
He shoved his fingers though his hair, trying to get back control. His transformation was on the brink, his skin feeling entirely too tight against his muscles. His fangs elongated in his mouth, pressing painfully against his lips and making his gums
One of the Aurors on his team, Jack Ryker, popped his head in. “Do you have a minute, Harry? There’s someone here to see you.”
Tears slipped down Narcissa’s dirt-smudged cheeks, her manacled hands shaking. “Then look into my memories. You will see that you are
“Do not think that you can seduce me, Draco. Your little Omega tactics will not work on me. The only use I have for you is with that wet hole between your legs and the fertile womb inside of you. Nothing more.”
Harry gingerly pulled his finger from the boy’s tight hole, wincing when he saw a smear of blood on his claw. He quickly licked off the blood from his claw, the predator within him purring at the delectable taste of his rabbit.
clothes all in his exact size. He had even been given hair ties for his long hair. After he had tied his hair up in a haphazard half-knot, he’d stared at his reflection in the mirror of the bathroom.
Harry kept sucking, the Alpha within him content to keep going until his breasts were no longer painfully engorged with milk.
“Come in, Draco. I’d love to have lunch with you. Thank you for bringing him to me, Auror Ryker.” Harry stood from his desk and walked over Draco, placing his hands on both of the boy’s small shoulders. “You can leave now,
Draco still couldn’t believe that Harry was a well-known author in the Wizarding World. One evening, he had plucked one of Harry’s novels from the bookshelf and opened it. He had immediately leafed to the back of the book, searching for an author’s bio. Much to his chagrin, there had been none.
Harry shook his head, straightening in his chair. “I don’t think so. I need to be up for work tomorrow and the last thing I need is a hangover.”
“It was nice meeting you!” said Harry cheerfully, even as Hermione dragged him out and away from the booth.
It was difficult to convince the people around them that Draco was from another country, with his distinctly English accent.
Term was nearly over, and Harry could almost feel the Christmas spirit in the air. He was surprised to say the least--everyone around him was much more cheerful than he’d expected, given the circumstances. He supposed they were all mostly happy to be alive. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t feel similarly.
Harry stumbled out of the fireplace and was only saved from falling over by Draco’s tight grip around his waist.
“Kreacher’s done a wonderful job,” Harry said. “Especially now that he and I get along. Come on. We’re not here to talk about my House Elf.”
“Would you like me to carry you down?” Draco asked sarcastically. “Honestly, it’d be easier than listening to you whine the entire way.”
Draco inhales sharply when Harry tells him what his mother had done. If Harry focuses, he can remember the feel of her fingers on his face, on his chest as she'd checked his pulse. He can hear the longing in her voice as she asks of her son.
And that's all she wrote! Thank you so much for reading! This fic has been a little bit strange for me, since so much of it is done as snapshots into Draco & Harry's lives. I hope you enjoyed! I've loved reading all the comments you guys have left, and sometimes they were the thing to motivate me to write! Merry Christmas!
Draco’s hand was gentle on Harry’s shoulder, and he leaned into the touch. "It’s okay. I’m right here."
His hands were steady as he slowly made his way down the column of buttons. Then, he reached up and did up Harry’s tie, careful not to tighten it too much. Harry hated when his ties were too tight.
He hesitates before he goes through his death. What happened at King’s Cross was kind of private, but so was the snitch.
“Me too,” Harry murmured, resting his head on Draco’s chest and smiling when Draco draped an arm over him.
“Touche,” Draco said, and then pulled something from the back of his book. He held it out to Harry, who took it, realising at once what it was.
As much as Harry hated to admit it, he didn’t like this corridor. It called back too many memories of the Chamber of Secrets, and even more recently, the image of Malfoy bleeding of Myrtle’s bathroom. He stopped outside the door.
Harry took in the dark colour of the wardrobe and the bed frame, and the silver colour of the duvet. Then, his eyes travelled to the chandelier.
“Look, father,” Draco said, quickly banishing that thought from his head. “I’m happy and I’m safe, and no, I’ll never really know if this was the best choice, but it’s the one I’ve made and it’s going to work.”
“Ow, fuck!” Draco threw out a hand to keep himself from colliding with the wall of the telephone booth.
Once in the Defence room, Harry dug through his bag for his book until he realised he’d left it on the library table.
To his surprise, Malfoy was waiting for him just outside the classroom. Harry schooled his features into an expression he hoped looked neutral and walked over.
"If I say no, can we stay home?" Harry tried to keep his voice light, tried to smile as he struggled to stop his hands shaking enough to do up the buttons of his shirt.
In the dim light coming through their bedroom window, Draco saw Harry turn to look at him. “Do you want the whole list, or did you want something specific?”
“You weren’t subtle in sixth year, so I don’t know why you think I should be,” Malfoy said. He held out Harry’s book. “You left this in the library.”
from the beginning. He’d sent Harry to his death on a guess, and he’d had the audacity to laugh about it as if sending a seventeen year old to die was as simple a decision as throwing an extra ingredient into a recipe. Dumbledore hadn’t cared about Harry any more than he’d cared about Snape. They were tools, pieces on a chessboard only Dumbledore could see.
Draco held out a bright red Christmas cracker and gave Harry an expectant look until Harry grasped the other end.
“Just give us a call and we’ll be here,” Harry said, reaching up into a nearby cupboard and pulling out a glass. He filled it with water and said, “I’m going to take this out to Draco; flooing always makes him thirsty, even if he won’t admit it.”
“Of course,” Harry murmured. He turned Teddy’s gift over in his hands, lifted his hand to tape the wrapping paper in place, and then froze.
Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand, threading their fingers together. Draco knew Harry had been present that night atop the Astronomy Tower. It’d been one of Harry’s nightmares that had tipped him off—Harry tended to mutter in his sleep. After a frightening week of explosive arguments, they’d finally managed to sit down and listen to each other.
The Malfoys were ice, in appearance and in manner. They’d worked for generations to be seen that way. It was clear from an early age that Draco was meant to be carved from ice, just like his parents and every person that came before them.
“Considering our...less than pleasant history, I’m surprised you didn’t run screaming at the thought.” Draco rested his hand on Harry’s arm. “As much as I’d love to spend Christmas with my family, I know the Manor is full of terrible memories for both of us. if you don’t want to go, we can stay here, or you can go to--”
so much. Harry has his head bowed, knows the wrong move could end everything. Draco’s tongue can be as sharp as any talon,capable of killing with just one blow.
And then he was crying, huge stupid sobs that made him shake and gasp as the tears ran down his dirty cheeks. He tried to stop, afraid of who might be watching; ashamed that, after everything that had happened,
“You’re staring at me, Harry,” Draco said without looking away from where he was neatly cutting his dinner.
“You nearly took my head off,” Harry said to it as he carefully tied the scroll to its leg. The owl hooted in response and took flight, leaving Harry to watch it disappear into the early morning twilight.
“Are you sure this is a good idea, Mr. Potter?” McGonagall asked as she and Harry waited for Draco to arrive. “I’m pleased you’re taking house unity so seriously, but is this the safest--”
True to Harry’s word, McGonagall’s office was empty when the pair of them arrived. Harry led the way over to the large fireplace and lit a fire with his wand.
They aren't quite sure where they stand. On one hand, Draco's mother had saved him; on the other, Harry had gotten her killed. He'd gotten a lot of people killed.
Harry felt his stomach drop. He knew it was coming. He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione what had happened in the forest, and he wasn’t sure he ever would. That was his moment to keep forever.
The rain fell quickly in small droplets that coated Harry’s glasses and face. He could see the rain clinging to Draco’s hair, too fine a mist to truly soak the strands that had come loose during their escape from the dining hall.
Malfoy looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then silently held out the bag of jelly beans. Harry took one and put it in his mouth, delighted when it turned out to be blackcurrant.
He goes over the pensive, briefly—it's not his story to tell—then how he donned his invisibility cloak and went to the forest. He tells Draco about the snitch and those horrible words. Tells him how he saw his parents, Remus, and Sirius. Tells him about how he'd allowed himself to be a child for one moment as he'd asked
“Ew!” Pasny cried out, stepping away from Draco as though he had just declared he wished to lick her toes, “why would I waste my first kiss on you?”
“So?” Draco deadpanned. “Nobody cares if boys kiss boys or if girls kiss girls or is boys kiss girls. We have lips and lips kiss, so kiss me Potter and no stupid giggling, okay?”
“I think we should try again, just to compare,” Draco said and Harry nodded mutely and they kissed again. Once again, the feelings al returned and Draco giggled again but this time, Harry giggled with him.
He saw Harry Potter sitting at a table and an idea struck him. It was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Not only would he find out what this whole kissing thing was all about, but he could also say he kissed someone famous.
“Yes,” Draco said after a moment of contemplation and came to a wonderful conclusion, “I’ve decided you’re my boyfriend now, hold my hand and come eat with me!”
First year was almost over. It was May and spring was showing and more and more people could be spotted kissing in the halls and outside now that it was warm enough to be outside again. He even saw one of the Weasley clones kissing Angelina.
“Wait, you’re going to come and eat with me,” Draco said, unsure of why but now that he said it, it felt right. It wasn’t just because they kissed, though.
Draco Malfoy didn’t understand kissing. He really didn’t understand the appeal but it seemed to be all everyone could do lately.
“No. Not like that! Someone who isn’t your family. You can’t judge until you’ve tried it,” Pansy said, “mama’s boy.”
His jaw dropped, his green eyes went wide and for a second he seemed to be repeating Draco’s words in his mind as though he had misheard him. When he came to the conclusion that he hadn’t, he crossed his arms and stared at Draco with a look of annoyance.
It wasn’t what Draco expected. His stomach filled with butterflies and his head spun for a second, unable to believe that something as ridiculous as a kiss could feel like this.
In the great hall, the ceiling as filled with floating rose petals that drifted from one side of the hall to the other, casting the room with a flowery scent.
Pansy seemed obsessed with it. She had a list of people she wanted to kiss. And she was determined to do it by the time she finished Hogwarts.
He understood why mother liked to kiss his forehead but he didn’t understand why Mother and Father enjoyed kissing for so long.
