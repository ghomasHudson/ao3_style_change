"Then you'll have this baby with or without Potter and I promise you, you won't be alone in this." is the last thing he hears before disappearing through the floo.
"I guess you're right" he sighs, accepting that there's no other way to go about it. "Good night, Pans. I'll see you on Monday." He says giving her a hug.
"Drake, these are all things that the others think" Pansy says, sounding like the mature woman that she has grown into after Hogwarts. "What Weasley thinks about you, or what Weaslette wants to achieve with her incessant proclamations of her newly acquired desire for having her own family, are none of your concerns."
"What great outcome can come out of that? He'll either think I'm lying about it being his kid. Or worse, he might want to get the child's magical signature checked to see if it matches his, and when the tests show that it is, he'll think I took the portions without telling him, afterall, why else would I take a pregnancy test without any symptoms? Unless to check whether my great evil plan of tying the "Saviour of the Wizarding world" permanently to a selfish death eater like myself, has worked or not. That's what Weasley's been telling him every time they meet. Even if I'm standing right beside Harry.
So he guesses Pansy having her doubts is pretty valid. Even though she knows he wouldn't cheat on his partner, but it could've been from someone Draco had been with before that. But the fact that the last sexual encounter Draco had before Harry, was a blowjob in a club loos almost 6 months back, was not something Draco was going to tell her.
And Draco thought about leaving. He really did. He thought about how Harry fucking Potter was probably still in the stairwell, how he’d looked at Draco like Draco was the person he had been all those years ago, like no time had elapsed. Like Draco was still the same boy who’d bullied and mocked, who’d been petty and unkind, who—once he’d graduated from that—had let a bunch of murderers into a school full of children, who’d almost become a murderer himself.
“Come on, dragon boy,” Tanner said, his face no more than an inch from Draco’s, his eyes bright with booze and happiness. “Let’s dance.”
“Right,” Malfoy said. “Of course. I have to go anyway. Lovely seeing you, Potter. See you never, I hope.”
The word “brilliant” came out in a horrendously mangled attempt at a British accent, which made Draco roll his eyes and Tanner cackle in delight. Draco had long since given up on trying to stop his idiotic friends from affecting British accents around him, which they invariably did at odd and/or inappropriate times.
He was pushing through the crowd, through a door at the far end of the room before he’d even made the decision to leave. He needed a break; he needed to breathe. He pushed through the door, mercifully unlocked, and when it clicked shut behind him, the noise of the crowd went with it.
Harry had tried many times to explain to Chelsea and the rest that he was fine, that the breakup hadn’t destroyed his soul or crushed his spirit or scattered his essence into a thousand desolate pieces, or whatever it was they believed. But he could always tell by the pity in their eyes that they didn’t buy it.
There was a beat, something vaguely familiar but not familiar enough to sing along to, and Harry had no one to dance with. They were meant to be meeting people, Alonse and Sab and a few others, but Harry couldn’t see them anywhere. Suddenly the place felt hot, and small, and too full of people. People, who always wanted something, even if they didn’t know what they wanted. People, who always asked more of him than he could give . . .
“What, you’ve never done a bit of dancing before you ushered in the apocalypse?” Malfoy said, and Harry gaped, because Malfoy was joking with him, only that’s not a thing that happened. Malfoy was joking, as if they were friends, except they weren’t friends, because this was Malfoy, and Harry had worked so hard to get away from all of that, from anything that would remind him . . .
—with its exposed brick and its leaking faucet and the mangy ginger cat who’d followed them home one night and never left. He wanted to collapse into his warm bed with a very tall scotch and something depressing playing, like Radiohead or Elliott Smith, and have a good wallow over Harry fucking Potter.
The place was mobbed. It was mobbed and it was loud, and Harry could barely hear Chelsea when she shouted that she was going to get them a drink. It was a basement space, with sticky floors and twinkling lights and hundreds of people in a room meant for only dozens. Harry thought about going with her, but by the time he’d decided to, she was gone, and he was facing a sea of bodies.
“Got bored,” said Tanner, shrugging, and Draco shook his head, because only Tanner would snag and then ditch the hottest guy in the room in the space of a song.
He wanted to take it back the moment he’d said it, but he couldn’t think how to. Malfoy’s face shuttered, his expression going blank.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Harry asked. Perhaps it wasn’t the most tactful way to ask, but really, what
The man who had stumbled through the door froze, half in and half out. His hand, Harry noticed, was clenching the doorknob, like he had the power to turn back time if he gripped the thing hard enough. But it was his eyes that were the most startling. They were wide, and shocked, and, if Harry wasn’t mistaken, a little bit dismayed.
But then the next song started, and Tanner let out the kind of cry Draco would once have associated only with werewolves.
"I still very much like you." Draco whispered before kissing him. Harry stood there for second before kissing back. Their arms wrapped around each other smashing their bodies as close as they can get. Hands grabbed at clothes and soon they were on the floor in their boxers grinding against each other.
Draco only had a second to process the word before Harry was grabbing his thighs tightly and lifting him up. He wrapped his legs around Harry and shuddered has he felts Harry's clothed boner rub against his own. He soon felt the world shift as Harry laid him down on his bed. He felt cold as Harry stood up to look down at him.
“FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” Draco yelled out pulling his mouth away from Harry’s. Harry was all the way inside of him and it felt amazing. Harry laid Draco down on to his back and grabbed on to Draco’s hips lifting them slightly so he could hit Draco’s pleasure spot better.
“Shut up Ginny! Draco didn’t have a choose, he had to become a death eater to protect his family. I am not joking Draco and I are dating. I told you yesterday that I’m gay.” Harry shouted getting the attention of everyone around.
Before Harry could say anything, Draco pulled him into the bedroom. He grabbed Harry's body and pulled it against his.
No, no no no no NO!! No one was supposed to find out. Especially not Potter! Why oh why did Potter have to be the one to find him.
“I wanted to wait tell we were comfortable as just boyfriends before I started our master and slave relationship. I’m sorry love I should have told you I wanted to wait a bit. I’ve made you worry, haven’t I?” Harry asked rubbing up and down Draco’s arms.
"I masturbated to you." Harry mumbled quickly standing up and pacing in front of the couch they both were sitting on.
"I know, I want to." Harry sighed licking the tip again and tasting precum. He slowly lowered his mouth around Draco's dick. He hallowed his cheeks has he felt Draco's hand run through his hair before grabbing tightly. He moaned at the feeling and started bopping his head. The grip Draco had on Harry's hair tightened and he pulled gently, Harry moaned again and moved faster.
“Yes, it was. You did fantastic love. I’ve never been so turned on before.” Harry said pulling out of Draco. He reached up and released Draco’s hands. He rubbed at Draco’s shoulders and arms helping the blood flow. Draco purred in pleasure.
“Yes, I left some paperwork in my office and was wondering if you could save me a trip and bring them to me?” Harry asked. Draco froze, Harry wanted him to go and meet him at his place. Dirty images of playrooms and sex toys ran through Draco’s mind.
Harry was startled awake by a soft knock to the door he had slept against. He realized that by locking the door he had made it so no other alphas would walk in on Draco but had also locked Draco inside.
“Thank you. I’m going to go see how Draco is doing with his friends, lets hang out later.” Harry excitedly said getting up and heading to the Slytherin table.
“You’re welcome.” Draco responded sitting down. The two sat in silence enjoying the warm tea. Draco checked his watch and cursed.
The two talked, they found out that there were only a few years age difference, Draco is 25 and Harry is 28. Draco found out that Harry’s parents had died in a car accident when he was young and that’s where the scar on his forehead came from. He also discovered that Harry was raised by his god fathers, one of which being Remus Lupin one of the most respected professors at Hogwarts University. They found out that Harry’s other godfather, Sirius Black, was Draco’s first cousin once removed, but because he was gay, he had been disowned by his parent’s. Draco said he could relate to that and revealed that he was gay as well and that his father disowned him. His mother soon left his father after that saying she wasn’t going to make the same mistake again.
“Why wouldn’t we be? I mean speaking frankly Harry is a good catch, he has money, status, and from how your grimaced when you sat down, he is great in bed.” Pansy absently said taking a drink of her orange juice.  Draco blushed and looked down at his half-eaten food.
"Ready for round two?" Harry asked teasing Draco's hole.  Draco's response was to push back onto Harry forcing Harry's cock inside a bit. Both of them were wide awake now.
Draco led Harry out of his office after making sure the cost was clear, the school’s rumor mill was already running wild with rumors about the two of them, they didn’t need to add fuel to it. He walked a little down the hall before coming up to a picture of a snake hissing angrily, Draco whistled gently and the snake quieted down before slithering away. Draco pulled on one side and revealed and secret pathway.
“A lot has happened today…I was really hurt by what happened earlier because I could have sworn that before I fell asleep last night you said…you said that you loved me, but then I saw Ginny kissing you and I started to question why you would even consider being with me. I was on the wrong side of the war and I did things that…that I’m not proud of…and I will always have this horrid mark on me so why would the savior of the wizarding world want to be a with a ex death eater?” Draco sighed trying to hold back tears. He did not want to cry in front of Harry.
“Does my outfit please you?” Draco asked lifting his arms up and doing a spin. Harry felt the air leave his lungs when he saw that Draco’s plump ass was exposed.
“Yes, things are much better now Mione…that’s why I’m here actually. The other night when I left dinner early, I ran into Draco and we spent the whole night…talking, and we spent a lot of time together yesterday as well. We’ve come to realize our feelings for each other are mutually and have started to date.” Harry said giving his friends a worried look. Draco hadn’t been the nicest person when they were younger, and Harry wasn’t sure how his friends would feel about him dating Draco.
“I do find this very, VERY pleasing but I’m afraid I can’t take you up on your tempting offer…tonight at least. If we are to be slave and master, we need to form a contract first. I need to know what you are okay with and what you aren’t okay with, we need to build trust and that takes time.” Harry said looking into Draco’s eye’s that had opened at his words, “Don’t look so sad love, it just means we can’t be slave and master tonight, but we could be boyfriends connecting for the first time after months of dancing around each other.” Harry said helping Draco stand up, he cupped the side of Draco’s face and gentle kissed him, “How does that sound?” He asked pulling Draco close to him.
"Harry!" Draco chanted repeatedly his mind having gone blank from all the pleasure. Harry had pushed a finger in, and both moaned at the feeling. Harry quickly added another finger and pumped them in and out.
Both boys quickly got up and excused themselves. Draco started to make his way back to his office when he was suddenly stopped by a hand on his shoulder.
“Please call me Draco.” Draco said slightly out of breath. He had run all the way here from the parking lot and his legs were hating him.
“Are you sure you want to walk in there together? We could walk in separate…” Draco asked stopping just before Harry could open the doors and pulling his hand away.
"Holy shit..."Draco whispered looking over every inch of Harry's amazingly fit body. He focused on one spot in particular and his mouth began to water.
"I want to like your dick. I want your huge cock in my mouth. Please let me lick your cock." Draco gasped sticking his tongue out. Draco couldn’t figure out what came over him, but he wanted to please Harry, he had never acted this desperate for any of his past boyfriends/fuck buddies. If anything, he was the one making them beg.
“Let’s change locations.” Harry whispered leading Draco out of his office. They walked up some stairs and into a spacious bedroom before Draco could look around Harry was kissing him again. Draco slowly undressed Harry crouching down to remove Harry’s pants, he mouthed Harry’s crotch through his boxers. He glanced up and was pleased to see Harry looking at him, his usually bright green eyes had darkened with lust. Draco gently pulled Harry’s boxers down, Harry’s semi hard cock flopped out almost hitting Draco in the face. Draco breath in Harry’s heavy scent, drool pooling in is mouth. He wanted to taste Harry’s cock so bad. He looked back up at Harry silently asking for permission. Harry gave a slight nod and Draco opened his mouth and flicked the tip with his tongue, licking off some precum. He wrapped his lips around the tip, hollowing his cheeks he started to bob his head up and down going lower and lower each time. He felt his gag reflex get touched the lower he went and almost gagged a couple of times but was able to stop himself. He reached up and wrapped his fingers around the part he couldn’t reach with his mouth. His hand moved in sync with his mouth. He reached up with his free hand and gently fondled Harry’s balls. He glanced up at Harry and hummed when he saw Harry’s head tilted back with pleasure. He felt Harry tense when he flicked at the tip of his dick with his tongue. Letting Harry’s dick go, he opened his mouth his hand quickly moving up and down Harry’s cock. He rubbed the tip against his tongue and occasionally sucked on it.
“Wow…I’m sorry that happened to you…things got a little depressing didn’t they….” Harry mumbled scratching the back of his head.
“So, was that everything you were hoping for?” Harry asked wrapping his arms around Draco, who was leaning against him.
"You feel so good Draco." Harry whispered pushing all the way in. It didn't take long for Harry to start thrusting. Draco moaned and groaned a mixture of "oh God Harry yes" and "fuck me harder". He let the haze of his heat take over his mind.  He could smell Harry's and his scents mixing and it was driving him further and further into insanity.
"Yes well, about what McGonagall said, she's right. We are adults now and there's no need to continue with our rivalry. Friends?" Harry asked holding out his hand hopefully. Both men got a sense of Deja vu. Draco studied Harry's weather worn hand for a minute before shaking it with his.
Harry  glanced at the pale blonde next to him. He hadn't seen Draco since school. He looked paler than before, but it looked good on him. It reminded Harry of the Greek statues he’d seen. He didn't look sick at all . In fact, he looked quite healthy and extremely attractive. His hair reaching down his back now.
“Let’s have our tea over here. It’s much more comfortable.” Harry said sitting down on one side of the couch. Draco came over and sat on the other side turned slightly so he could see Professor Potter er Harry.
"Yes, yes, harder, fuck me harder!" Draco groaned thrusting back as Harry thrust forward. Harry pulled out and chuckled at the whine Draco let out. He flipped Draco onto his back and quickly thrusted back in.  Draco wrapped his legs around Harry and pulled him close.  His arms wrapped around Harry's neck nails scratching at his back.
"Ma...I mean Draco...I...need to go. We'll talk...later." Harry said while gently pushing Draco away and getting up. He made his way to the door. He turned and looked back at Draco still sitting on the floor clothes slightly rumbled.
"PLEASE FUCK ME! RAM YOUR DICK INTO ME PLEASE! I WANT IT SO BAD!" Draco shouted grabbing the sheets below him so hard his knuckles turned white. Harry pulled his fingers out smirking at the whine that escaped Draco's mouth and lined himself up before slamming in all at once. At the same time, he bite into Draco's neck moaning loudly as Draco's sweet blood filled his mouth. He pulled out and slammed back in making Draco groan loudly. He slammed into Draco over and over has he sucked blood from his neck. Harry pulled away and licked at the bite mark to get the last of the blood. He looked down at Draco and almost came at the sight he saw. Draco's eyes were hazed over with pure pleasure. His mouth wide open so little moans could escape. A trail of blood left the fresh puncture wounds.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Hermione asked putting her book down and giving Harry a look of concern.
“I was hanging on his every word; my knees were getting weak Blaise. When he tucked my hair behind my ears and lightly touched my cheek, I almost lost it. I’ve never been affected by someone this much Blaise. Even when I first met him his voice gave me goosebumps.” Draco mumbled leaning his head on Blaise’s shoulder. Blaise wrapped his arm around Draco and gave him a squeeze, “What am I going to do Blaise?” Draco asked looking up at his friend. Blaise kissed his forehead and didn’t respond; he wasn’t sure what to tell Draco. He had never felt what Draco was feeling and therefore had no advice. Draco sighed; he was so fucked.
“I’m glad to know that you find it so easy to talk to me. I hope over the course that you’re my TA we can become…friends.” Harry said giving Draco a shiver inducing smile that seemed more like a smirk.
“Before we start, I want to go over somethings with you.” Harry said walking around his desk. He reached into a drawer and grabbed some papers. Draco intuitively knew it was a contract and his breath caught in his throat. He also watched as Harry pulled a velvet box out of a different drawer.
"Use this if someone comes quickly cover up and don’t make any noise." Harry whispered. Draco nodded not looking up, but Harry could see blush covering his ears.
"I am so sorry for being late Headmistress, time got away from me as I was organizing my office." Draco quickly apologized has he stepped into the office. Looking around he released not much had been changed except there was a new portrait up. Draco looked at it before quickly looking away his heart hurting at his last memory of Headmaster Dumbledore, he nodded his head at Headmaster Snape who gave him a small smile.
to be your boyfriend, but that doesn't mean you can imagine yourself having a kid with him." He says and then adds, "At Least not yet" just in case things do get serious in the future.
He finally sags into the couch. "I don't know, Pans." He replies much quieter now. "How do you tell your recently archnemesis -turned friend- turned boyfriend, that you're going to be parents? Not even 3 weeks after getting into a relationship? That too without taking any fertility portions.
Draco winced slightly, staring at his own untouched wine glass. The sole reason for Pansy choking on her wine.
Anyways, back to the glass in question. As soon as Pansy had asked him the question, Draco had blurted out the first thing that came to his mind, which was apparently the pure, unadulterated truth, "I'm pregnant."
"Ok Drake." Pansy says, seemingly unaffected by his outburst. "It's Potter's baby. What are you planning to do now?"
"Is it Potter's?" She finally managed to ask. Which made him slightly annoyed that she'd think it was not his boyfriend's.
Ok maybe not the sole reason, as Pansy had merely asked why he hadn't touched his glass all evening on their monthly "Slytherin movie night" they have one Saturday, of every month, which Blaise had to leave halfway through because his this month's girlfriend was home alone and Draco had had a moment of horror thinking Blaise was dating a
Harry sat up and looked at him guiltily. “I suppose I owe you an explanation. I did try to explain last night before anything happened, but-” he waved his hand vaguely in the air. Harry began to tell Draco about the curse and its effects and how Hermione had eventually found out what was wrong. Draco nodded and made little ‘mmm’ noises as if all this made perfect sense to him and wasn’t unusual in any way at all.
“We’re going to do this now?” Harry said in disbelief. He’d been hoping to have slightly more time to get used to the idea of his friends watching him get hard at the sight of Draco Malfoy. Hang on, scratch that. No amount of time long enough for him ever to get used to that idea.
Now that Kreacher was here, Harry felt his resolve waver a little. “Um, Kreacher – God, this is awkward – um, feel free to say no to this. Like, no pressure or anything, I’m aware I’m about to ask you for something really unusual, but…”
As soon as the curse was broken, Pansy felt the connection break in her magic. Lying in her bed in the Slytherin dormitories, she smiled to herself. With any luck, her plan will have worked. Draco and Potter would now be friends and Pansy would no longer have to endure Draco explaining to her over breakfast why Potter’s own brand of geeky-chic was particularly cute and adorable. It completely ruined her appetite and had made her grouchy for the rest of the day. And who knows, if she’s really lucky, Potter might even be so grateful for the chance to be with Draco that he forgives her for the whole handing-him-over-to-Voldemort thing. Pansy turned over in her bed. Yes, things were definitely going to be better this way.
Harry stopped listening to Ron. He had a feeling he didn’t want to hear this story. So there was definitely something wrong with him then. Damn it. He knew sporting an erection each time he saw Draco Malfoy wasn’t normal.
“Fuck, yes,” he hissed. “Come on, turn round.” Draco gripped Harry’s hips roughly, eagerly, his fingernails digging into the soft flesh. He twisted Harry round so he was bent forwards over the desk.
who was causing this reaction. Harry wasn’t gay. At least, he was pretty sure he wasn’t gay. No bloke had every provoked this reaction in him before, but then again, neither had Cho or Ginny. After a few days of unwanted Malfoy-induced erections, Harry decided that he had to test whether he was gay or bi or whatever. Thankfully, he had an idea just how to do this.
Draco pulled down what remained of Harry’s trousers and Harry felt relief as his balls were finally allowed to swing free. Each was now roughly the same size as a small apple. Draco knelt down in front of Harry and sucked each ball in turn into his mouth. The feeling was incredible and Harry’s  knees grew weak.
"Then there is the Weaslette announcing the fact that she's finally ready to take a break from professional quidditch and start a family. Even though she is currently single, she finds a way to throw that out there any time Harry is in hearing range." He briefly wonders whether excessive ranting is an effect of pregnancy.
“Lift your head.” Harry said suddenly surprising Draco. Draco lifted his head; something was put over his eye’s. Harry smirked down at the pale boy kneeling in front of him, blindfolded and clueless of the things that were about to be done to him.
“Harry…. Close… so close Harry.” Draco moaned out touching his forehead to Harry’s. Harry looked at Draco’s face twisted in pleasure before he leaned in and kissed Draco slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. The two came together, Draco could feel the hot spurts of cum shoot between their stomachs, Harry pushed deep into Draco shuddering as he came into the condom. They collapsed onto the bed, panting and red in the face.
"Ron it's been five years; we are no longer children let's not be petty." Harmonie sighed sipping her wine. Harry just laughed and sipped his whiskey glancing at the platinum blond that was currently standing at the bar. Not much had changed since school. He still looked handsome almost model like. Harry glanced around and already saw some women and even men looking over at Draco.
“Count each strike and don’t miss one.” Harry ordered from Draco’s right side. Draco jerked his head in that direction at the same time Harry flicked Draco’s nipple with a riding crop.
“You look so pretty bouncing on my cock love. Tell me is reality better than fantasy?” Harry panted moving Draco’s hair out of the way so he could lick and suck at Draco’s neck.
Harry was hungry and the food in front of him wasn't what he wanted. He wanted blood and he wanted it now.
".......thank you...." Draco whispered handing Harry's cloak back to him. Harry took it and faintly smelt the scent his mind was quickly recognizing as Draco's.
"I wasn't runn-" Harry cut himself short...he had been running away, "I'm sorry Draco. You're right I was running away. I was confused, I suddenly felt this strong attraction towards you, and it scared me. I  had a lot of things to figure out and I'm sorry Draco. I shouldn't have avoided you and just told you that I needed time." Harry said slouching his shoulders like a huge weight had just been lifted from them.
"Merlin's beard!" Draco shouted arching his back. Harry continued to finger Draco's hole, licking here and there. He added a second finger and smirked at the loud moan he got from Draco.
“I didn’t realize you could be so cheesy.” Draco giggled as Harry chucked the washcloth back into the bathroom.
"God Draco, you smell amazing!" Harry purred burying his nose in Draco's pubic hair. He licked up Draco's dick sucking the tip to get the little bead of pre-cum that was leaking out, "taste amazing as well."
“I’m sorry starlight, I very much want to take that step with you, I just wanted to establish this relationship first. Forgive me?” Harry asked lifting Draco’s head from his shoulder. Draco looked into Harry’s emerald  eyes and nodded.
“Before you say anything, I have a few things I would like to say. First, I would like to apologize to both of you. I was an arsehole to you both and I said some cruel things and I am sorry for that. I know that one apology isn’t going to make up for all the things I’ve said and done but I do hope you give me a chance to prove to you that I have changed for the better. I’ll leave you guys alone to talk.” Draco said standing up. He gave Harry and quick kiss on the cheek then made his way over to the Slytherin table.
“I’m going to get so spoiled by you aren’t I.” Draco said standing up so Harry could take off his outfit.
“I do have to say Harry filled out quite nicely. I wouldn’t mind having a bit of fun in the sheets with him.” Blaise said looking over at Harry who was still talking to his friends, “Of course you can join us Draco.” Blaise said winking at Draco who just looked away used to Blaise’s antics.
“Yes! You have. You tease me so much about what you will do to me in your playroom, but I have yet to see said playroom. I was starting to worry that you didn’t want to take that step with me.”  Draco pouted hugging Harry and resting his head on Harry’s shoulders.
"How can you be so fucking sexy." Harry groaned looking over Draco. He leaned forward and kitten licked the ring of muscles and heard Draco gasp. Gaining confidence from that gasp Harry started lapping at the hole getting bolder and bolder the louder Draco got. Harry stopped, he watched as Draco looked back at him and gave him a smirk. He leaned forward and put to fingers against Draco’s lips.
“The…uh…papers you asked for are on your desk.” Draco mumbled trying not to nuzzle in Harry’s chest.
“Fuck that was so good.” Harry gasped, looking down at Draco he almost came all over again. Draco was looking up at him with his mouth open and all of Harry’s cum in it for Harry to see.
“So, you guys are okay with me dating Harry?” Draco asked looking at his two of his closest friends.
"Oh God Harry fuck ugh ahhh so good!" Draco rambled grabbing Harry's hair, "Please Harry, I need you, please. Please I'm going to cum HARRY I'M CUUUUUUUUMMMMMING!" Draco shouted, cum splattering across his chest a bit even hitting him in the face. He laid there dazed and panting. He could feel Harry moving around on the bed but was too stated to see what he was doing. He then felt a tongue lick up his cheek removing the cum that landed there.
“I’m fine Hermione just thinking about a lot of things.” Harry mumbled pushing the food he had on his plate around.
Draco scrambled off the floor and quickly climbed on top of Harry. He looked down at Harry's dick and gulped. This was the biggest cock he had come across. He licked from the base to the tip and felt Harry shiver beneath him. He swirled his tongue around the tip a couple of times before taking it all in his mouth and going as far down as he could.
"WAIT!" Draco yelled panic setting in once again. He knew his heat wasn’t done, that he was just having a break. He didn't know how long this break would last either, “...I...I need your...help. My heat isn't done. It's on a break of sorts. I need to get to my room....can you...can you help me do that? Please...Harry." Draco felt sick...he had only ever asked his father or Snape for help, but they were gone, and Draco was desperate.
“I would love to be your boyfriend Harry.” Draco whispered looking deep into Harry’s eyes. Harry gave a huge smile and kissed Draco again slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth making the pale boy moan.  Draco pushed Harry off him and got onto his hands and knee’s giving Harry a wonderful view.
It had been three months since Harry and Draco had kissed and even though Draco had tried to talk with Harry many times Harry always found excuses not to. Draco was starting to get fed up. He had thought...maybe possible...there was something there.
"You are excused for the night Kretcher." Harry hurriedly said dragging Draco into the front room, "sorry about that...he has been serving the Black family for generations I didn't have the heart to make him leave when I inherited this place." He sheepishly said leading Draco to a couch before heading over to a mini bar.
“This is the spot you will wait for me; you have the choice to stand or kneel.” Harry said pointing to a spot where the floor  was cushioned so if Draco had to wait long his knee’s or feet wouldn’t hurt. Draco moved to the spot and kneeled. Harry hummed his approval and walked around the room. Draco could hear him opening draws, grabbing things, he even heard chains. He could feel himself getting harder and harder the more he heard.
The two quickly made their way to the eighth years common room thankful that it was so early, and no one was out and about. When they reached the common room, Harry went in first and was glad to see the place empty.
"Yeah. I'll help you get to your room." Harry said shocked that Draco had not only asked for help but had also said please for the third time and had used Harry's first name. He quickly undid the locking spell and stepped back letting Malfoy decide when to open the door.
“Fucking hell Harry.” Draco moaned his eyes filling with lust as he watched Harry lick and suck on his dick.
"Yes I am. Can you blame me though? We're both naked and your ass is just too perfect not to hump." Harry sighed grinding his dick between Draco's ass cheeks. He licked a line up Draco's neck smirking when Draco let out a little moan. He thrusted a few more times between Draco's ass cheeks before slowly nudging at his hole.
Draco groaned when Harry finally let go of his neck and licked the bite. He felt Harry slip from him and missed the full feeling immediately.
“Good, starting Monday, I’ll be Professor Potters assistant. Can you tie me up?” Draco asked turning his back to Blaise who quickly laced up the corset. He hugged Draco from behind.
"You want to lick me. Lick me where?" Harry grunted grabbing a handful of Draco's hair. He liked that Draco had let his hair grow longer. It was easier to grab this way.
"I'm going to push in now." Harry said tightening his grip on Draco’s hips, he was close to losing it.
“I don’t really know myself something just seemed different about you…you seemed more confident. At first, I just thought you had a good break but the more I watched you the more I knew it was something else. You stopped eating as much at meals you would just push the food around and make it look like you eat some.  Then one evening I was by the Black lake and noticed you walking into the forbidden forest.  When you came back you had a lot of rabbit bodies and you dropped them off at Hagrid’s hut. It was that night where it all clicked.” Draco yawned laying down on Harry’s bed. Harry stretched out next to Draco and trailed his fingers down Draco’s neck.
"Yea..." Harry responded pulling out of Draco making the blonde wince.  Harry casted a cleaning charm on himself and Draco, then the bed. He pulled the covers over them both pulling Draco close.
“Very funny Harry like you would ever date a Slytherin especially one that was a death eater.” Ginny huffed glairing at Draco. Draco flinched and rubbed his arm that had the mark.
"In the top drawer of the nightstand." Draco responded with a soft moan as Harry shifted his rigid penis brushing against Draco's.
“Come on I need to talk to Hermione and Ron real fast.” Harry sighed pulling Draco towards the Gryffindor table. Draco glanced over at Pansy and Blaise who were giving him concerned looks, he gave them a little wave to let them know he was okay.
“Yes, I want it!” Draco groaned turning his head to look at Harry over his shoulder. Who knew that Harry I was such a tease?
“I want you Master! I want whatever you are willing to give to me, I want to please you!” Draco moaned trying to rub himself against Harry as much as possible. Suddenly Harry disappeared and Draco was left cold and wanting.
"Hmmmm I'm not done yet." Harry growled pushing a finger in with his tongue making Draco moan. Harry stopped just long enough to move Draco on to his back and push his legs up into the air.
“Look I still think he is a right brat but…I’ll give him a chance for you mate.” Ron mumbled; he didn’t really like the idea of trying to be friends with Malfoy, but he would try for his best friend.
Suddenly there was a commotion by the entrance, and everyone turned to look. Draco's jaw dropped when he saw who was standing in the doorway with a sheepish grin on his face.
“Ever since that first night I saw you at S&M you haven’t left my mind. I’m constantly thinking about you, and what you could do to me. Your little touches here and there when we are working, the sexual conversations we have at the club, all of it was just adding to my desire for you. I thought about just confessing to you…but I figured you would like this way much better.” Draco said slowly lifting his head, he opened his mouth wide and slightly stuck out his tongue. Harry’s word of wanting someone on the floor with their mouth open and ready played through his head. He still couldn’t believe he was doing this.
"So sexy." Harry growled out kissing Draco's neck, grabbing a fist fill of blonde hair and pulling so he had better access. Draco moaned loudly and wrapped his arms around Harry. He felt Harry's fangs graze his neck and tensed his eyes going wide.
“Oh yes, thank you.” Harry said letting go of Draco and going over to his desk. Draco watched as Harry started to look through the papers. He watched as Harry’s glasses slipped down his nose and he watched as Harry absent mindedly pushed them back up. Watched how he ran his hand through his hair. Draco took a deep breath, he wished he had a strong drink, he needed all the help he could get.
“That seems to be happening a lot today. I was late to my appointment with Professor Potter as well.” Draco huffed dumping his stuff and quickly going behind a curtain to change.
"I'm sorry what was that?” Draco asked looking at Harry with shock. Did he just say he found Draco attractive? Draco must be dreaming, or this was some cruel joke to get back at him for all those years at school.
“You correctly heard Draco…I did say I love you last night and I had wanted to say it this morning. I’m sorry you got hurt because I didn’t set Ginny straight sooner but please know that I love you.” Harry sighed kissing Draco again. Draco tried to hold the tears back, but he just couldn’t. Draco sobbed and threw his arms around Harry’s neck. Suddenly Draco’s stomach rumbled loudly.
"Now you want to talk. I've only been trying to talk to you for three months now and every time I tried you came up with some excuse to run away. So, tell me why I should talk to you?" Draco growled.
"Confirming my suspicions, I'm surprised your friend Granger hasn't already figured it out. Must be too busy helping Weasley not fail." Draco chuckled running his hands through his hair which Harry noticed had grown quite long.
"Please...j... Just leave me alone." Draco cried backing away from the door and tucking himself between the wall and toilet.
Draco must have passed out or something because when he opened his eyes it was three in the morning and Harry was asleep next to him, his arm wrapped around Draco's middle and their legs tangled together.
"To talk." Harry sighed sitting down in front of Draco's desk. The glare Draco had on his face reminded him of the glare Snape would give him. He suddenly felt like a student getting scolded for driving a flying car into the whomping willow.
Harry could hear the beats of Draco's heart. He walked forward tell he was standing in front of Draco looking deeply into his eyes.
"Hmmmm it's too early to be awake now love." Harry groaned pulling Draco close and burying his face into Draco's neck. Draco laid there cuddled up with Harry feeling like he was still dreaming.  Then he felt it. Something was rubbing against his ass.
".... I've never hated you...I was mad. Mad that you refused my friendship, mad that Weasley became your best friend, mad that you were sorted into Gryffindor and not Slytherin. Mad that we ended up on opposite sides, mad that no matter how hard I tried, how much I told myself not to...I couldn't stop liking you!" Draco yelled grabbing Harry's collar and smashing his lips onto Harry's.
“As much as I love your outfit lets get you out of it. I want to feel nothing between us.” Harry purred, stripping Draco. Soon both men were laying naked on the bed. They laid facing each other, kissing, and touching wherever their hands could reach. Pressing their bodies together.
“Yes please.” Draco said organizing the papers in his arms. Professor Potter set up the tea and snacks on the coffee table in front of the couch.
"I want to lick you Harry...please let me lick you." Draco begged getting off the bed to kneel in front of Harry. Harry was hung and Draco wanted to suck on it like a lollipop.
“Draco calm down, I canceled class for today, I also took the liberty of calling your friend Blaise and he will be emailing you everything you missed in your classes today. He said he would also cover your shift tonight, he said something about sending him sexy pictures of us together but I’m not sure if he was serious or not. Anyway, just relax, I took care of everything.” Harry said grabbing Draco’s shoulders and getting him to look him in the eyes. Draco took a minute to process everything.
"Actually...things didn't work out between Ginny and me. We broke up about a year after school. She is off playing quidditch somewhere last I heard." Harry sighed watching Draco finish his drink and order another.
“Putting you dating Draco to the side for a moment lets discuss what in the world is going on with you and my sister?” Ron asked putting his plate to the side. Harry filled them in on everything that had happened between Ginny and him. How he came to the burrow one day to find Ginny in her bed with someone else. How they had broken up and that was part of the reason that Harry left on his trip. However, since Dean had dumped her for Seamus, she had been throwing herself at him and apparently other guys too and how she couldn’t take no for an answer.
"You know," Draco chuckled standing up and stepping closer to Harry, "I realized something our last year of school," he continued taking another step closer, "I realized that the reason I was so mean to you wasn’t because I hated you or wanted to be you but because it seemed to be the only way I could get your attention, and I wanted your attention because I liked you, I liked you a lot." He was now right in front of Harry looking into Harry's emerald, green eyes.
“Duty calls.” Draco said before standing up and starting to help Blaise fill the drink orders. Every once in awhile he would look over to see if Harry was still there and for a while, he was, but once they got through all the orders he was gone. Draco ignored the drop in his stomach.
"Don’t act all surprised, you've always known you look good. Even though you were an annoying prick one would have to be blind not to see how handsome you were...are." Harry responded putting his hand on Draco's knee. They heard a snort and then coughing from behind them. When they looked, they saw Hermione patting a coughing Ron on the back.
"Suck." He growled out before going back to licking and sucking at Draco's hole. He felt Draco's lips close around his fingers and his tongue move around them. After a minute or two he pulled his fingers out, he brought to the tight hole and slowly pushed one in.
“You got it all planned out don’t you.” Draco whispered, his eyes were getting heavy with sleep and the thought of waking up tomorrow and having breakfast with his new boyfriend warmed his heart.
“I assure you that is not what I was thinking about.” Harry grumbled trying to pull his arm away. Ginny had been trying to get back with Harry ever since her and Dean had broken up and he started to date Seamus. Harry was not interested, and to top it off the smell of her blood made him gag, but that didn’t stop her from throwing herself at him any chance she got (A/N: I’m sorry to all the Ginny fans out there).
“Yes, your whole day is free to do whatever or whoever you want.” Harry said grabbing some bacon and giving Draco a wink. Draco sat there for a second before flopping back down into the fluffy pillows, almost knocking the tray of food off the bed. He couldn’t remember the last time he had a day to do whatever he wanted.
"Later." Harry said before walking out the door, closing it behind him. Draco sat on the floor the warmth of the alcohol wearing off. He staired at the door and wondered when later would be.
Draco swore to himself and hurried down the hallway of his old school. After he became a potion master, he was able to become Hogwarts new potions professor. Merlin knows they needed a new one. Slughorn was getting on in years and of course was more than willing to pass the reins on to Draco and go back to retirement. Draco was organizing his office and classroom when he released, he was going to be late to the sudden meeting Pro...Headmistress McGonagall had called. He quickly said the password to her office and hurried up the spiral staircase.
“You’ve become so sensitive.” Harry said as he walked over to the table. Draco could hear him moving things around, the excitement of not knowing what would happen to him heightened everything for Draco. His ears strained to hear Harry, to try and see if he could get any clues as to what Harry planned. Draco jumped when he felt Harry’s fingers massage at his hole.
“I understand Master.” Draco responded quickly. Soon things got quite again, and all Draco could hear was Harry moving about the room.
"There are too many clothes." Harry growled and before Draco knew it his clothes were gone along with Harry's.
"You wish." Harry responded kissing Draco and making their marriage official. The two smiled as whoops and howlers could be heard from their friends and family and even some students as they walked back down the aisle, after three years of dating they were finely married and couldn’t wait to be together forever.
"Malfoy?" Harry called out slowly walking around the bathroom. He heard a whimper come from the very last stall and made his way over.
“So do I.” Draco said softly looking into Harry’s amazing green eyes. The shrill whistle of the tea pot made both men jump. Draco quickly turned and removed the pot from the heat. He felt the warmth of Harry’s body move away as he continued to get things ready. He brought the new pot of tea over and poured it. He quickly got Harry’s cup ready remembering exactly how he prepared it.
"Yeah, it was. Wish we had done it sooner." Draco sighed snuggling closer to Harry. It wasn't long before Harry heard soft snores coming from the blonde. He chuckled softly, saying a cleaning spell before pulling some blankets over them. They would talk more after they woke up. Or maybe they would go another round of sex. Either way Harry was looking forward to it excited to finely have caught his crush.
“I believe so.” Draco said finishing his now cold tea. He looked at his watch and realized that they had been talking for an hour.
“Merlin’s cock Draco your mouth feels so good.” Harry groaned out when Draco started to move his head up and down. Draco gave a little wiggle of his ass to get Harry’s attention back on his rear end. Harry smirked and started to lick and suck at Draco’s pulsing hole. Soon he was three fingers and a tongue deep and Draco was moaning around his cock. Draco let go of Harry’s dick with a pop and gave it a few more licks.
“Come.” Harry commanded from behind the doors. Draco slowly pushed open the doors and stood in the doorway for a moment before coming up to Harry who was leaning on the front of his desk. Harry made a small circle with his finger, telling Draco to spin for him. Draco turned in a circle slowly, making sure Harry had plenty of time to look at every side of him.
“You guys saw the rest of what happened.” Harry said finishing his story, leaving out him being a vampire, he wasn’t quite ready to come out about that.
"I love you." Harry whispered as Draco drifted off to sleep a smile on his gorgeous face. Harry swore to himself that he would say it again once they were awake and fall asleep well.
“Hello Harry, I hope things are better now, you seemed quite upset the other day.” Hermione said tucking the book she had been reading before all the commotion away in her bag.
"As you may have realized already, we have two new but familiar faces with us today. I would like to reintroduce Draco Malfoy as our new potions professor and Harry Potter as our new defense against the dark arts professor..." both Harry and Draco stood quickly then sat down again. McGonagall continued on about the new school year starting but Draco wasn't paying attention. He was too busy discreetly looking at Harry. It had been years since they had seen each other. Draco going to France to study being a potion master and Harry...well Draco wasn't sure what Harry did in those years since school. Whatever it was it agreed with him. He had filled out quite nicely and no longer looked scrawny. His cloths didn't hang on him anymore but fit snugly over his muscles, which Draco appreciated very much.
"Oh god Draco...fuck that feels so good. Bloody hell how deep can you take it!" Harry yelled out throwing his head back and bucking his hips up. No one had been able to take him this deep before.
“Fuck Draco you feel so fucking tight around my cock. Your slutty little hole is squeezing me so tightly, it’s sucking up my cock so well.” Harry moaned grinding into Draco. Harry pulled out, grabbing Draco’s legs he folded Draco in half and then slammed back in.
“Damn straight you are.” Harry said gently taking off Draco’s new collar and safely putting it on the counter. Together they got into the shower. Afterward Harry ran a bubble bath and the two soaked in the tub.
“I may know one or two people.” Draco whispered letting his eyes flicker down to Harry’s full lips. He wanted to kiss Harry so bad right now.
“No, you’re not, you loved being with me and you want me back just admit it already Harry.” Ginny said turning Harry to look at her and kissing him. It was then that Harry heard Draco. He pushed Ginny away and turned to look the doors. There stood Draco with tears in his eyes, he flipped Harry off and rushed out the doors.
“Yeah, I’m okay.” Draco mumbled looking ahead. He didn’t want to admit he had been crying especially if he had been completely wrong about what had happened. When they reached the Great Hall, it was lunch time and students were filling in, but Draco didn’t miss the messy head of hair and the bright green eyes that would searching the coward. Sliver eye’s met green, Harry smiled he knew that Draco would come to the Great Hall to get food so after running the around the castle like a mad man he waited by the Great Hall doors hoping to catch Draco before he went in. Draco slowly walked up to Harry.
"So there really is a giant squid in the lake!" Harry exclaimed when he saw a giant eye peering through one of the windows in Draco's office. Suddenly the eye moved followed by some tentacles. Then the window was empty, and Harry could see into the lake.
"God your so fucking sexy." Harry moaned shifting them tell Draco was on his hands and knees with Harry behind him.
"Lead the way." Draco growled letting Harry pull him up. They quickly made their way up to Harry's room laughing and giggling like schoolboys the whole way. When they finely made it to Harry's room they flopped onto his bed.
“Cum.” Harry ordered turning the vibrators up to the highest level. Draco came with a shout, warm cum shot out of his dick and landed over his stomach and chest, he even felt some land on his chin. Harry turned the vibrators off and gently pulled them out. Draco laid there panting, he let out a soft moan of comfort when Harry unshackled his feet, and his lower body came to rest on the bed beneath him.
"Nothing. Surprised? I am too. Usually, I would say something along the lines of my father will hear about this, but we both know he can't do anything where he is. Plus I... don’t want to." Draco mumbled the last part a blush spreading over his face.
"Please just fuck me already!" Draco pleaded thrusting his hips against Harry's fingers. Harry smirked kissing the tip of Draco's dick before taking it deep into his mouth and sucking. Draco lost it and came suddenly surprising both. Once Harry was sure he had swallowed every drop he slowly kissed his way up Draco's lean body. He spent extra time on Draco's neck leaving impressive hickeys he was sure not even a healing spell could get rid of completely. He looked down at Draco pulling his fingers out and positioning himself.
"Now then," she said well sitting back down in her chair, "There are a few reasons I asked you two to stay," She began glancing at both boys before continuing, " First I don’t want a repeat of your school days. You are both adults now and the war is over. There is no reason you two shouldn't be able to at least be civil to each other. I implore both of you to remember that you are Professors now and role models for the students you will be teaching." McGonagall said with the same look she gave them as students.
“That feels so good.” Draco purred stretching his arms. He opened his eye’s when he felt Harry get up from the bed.  He watched as Harry got his boxers back on before coming back to the bed.
Harry stood there shocked. Malfoy had said please, twice, and from what Harry could tell through the door was crying. There was also the fact that he didn't deny being an omega. Harry looked at the stall door and banged his forehead against it. He heard Draco cry harder. He quickly covered his face with his robes and backed away from the stall door finally realizing that not only was Draco Malfoy a omega, but he was also an omega in heat. Harry rushed out of the bathroom taking deep breaths to clear his head. He cast a strong locking spell on the bathroom door. He then leaned against it before sliding down to the floor. Tonight, was going to be a long night.
“I wanted to put this on you myself after we established our contract. If you want, we can do something at the club, I also have a chocker for you to wear whenever you are in less accepting places.” Harry said placing the collar around Draco’s neck.
“Oh, come on Harry, I know you miss me and want me to take you back.” She purred kissing his cheek suddenly.
"You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this." Draco panted pushing Harry's shirt off and running his hands over the tight muscles.
Draco led Harry into the pathway. They followed it a bit laughing, and giggle tell they hit the end where Draco pushed on another painting slowly and peaked around to make sure there weren't any students or other teachers around. They hurried into Draco's room Harry not missing the fact that the door was a painting of a Dragon.
“Put your hair in a high ponytail, from now on whenever we have a session, I want your hair up in a ponytail, nod if you understand.” Harry said watching Draco put his hair up.  Draco nodded his head when he was done putting his hair up. Harry stood up and walked out of Draco’s line of sight.
Harry stood there shocked. Draco Malfoy wanted to help him by becoming a blood donor, had secretly had a crush on him for years, and was currently kissing him. Hell must be freezing over, he must have died, and this was heaven, the world must be ending because there was no way that this was really happening.
"Draco...were not done yet." Harry purred into Draco's ear before slowly pushing into Draco. It was so tight and warm inside Draco that Harry almost came right then and there. Thinking of Flinch in a bathing suit stopped that from happening.
“We couldn’t have done this when I wasn’t basically naked?” Draco asked grabbing the contract and starting to read it.
"Is that right...still doesn't explain why you’re talking to me." Draco says turning to look at Harry's amazing green eyes.
“Does that feel good love?” Harry asked leaning over Draco and playing with his nipples. He pulled one into his mouth and sucked on it, flicking it with his tongue. The other he softly pinched between his fingers and pulled.
“This isn’t funny anymore Harry! How can you be gay when we are dating?” Ginny screeched stomping her foot.
Before long Harry was three fingers deep in a very loud Draco. Harry was thankful he had the forethought to cast a silencing charm.
"I'm not done yet." Harry sighed grabbing Draco's hips and flipping him over. He pulled tell Draco was on his knee’s face down on the bed. He grabbed Draco’s full ass and spread them apart so he could see his tight hole.
“You want this?” Harry teased pushing just the tip in. He held Draco’s hips in place so he couldn’t push back.
“I thought about coming here ngh in a sexy outfit… and being taken by you on your desk and…ahh fuck Harry that feels so good!” Draco moaned when Harry pulled the plug out and started to stretch Draco with his tongue and fingers.
"As well as can be, surprised your even talking to me right now, thought you would be off with the she Weasley having lots of babies." Draco said grabbing his drink and taking a sip.
When Draco woke up the next morning Harry was gone in his place was a note that he had gone back to his room and would see Draco at breakfast. Draco sighed and tried to get out of bed to go to his private bathroom only to have his legs give out. He groaned and got up again. He carefully stood on his weak legs and made his way to his bathroom. He took a quick shower before starting his skin care routine. He brushed some hair oil into his hair tell all the knots where out and it was smooth. He then got dressed in some casual clothes as there were no classes today. Once he was ready and he was sure his legs could support him, he made his way to the Great Hall.  Draco thought about what had happened the evening before and smiled. He had been in love with Harry, and last night he was mostly sure that Harry had said he loved him as well, but he was half asleep and might have dreamed it. Draco snapped out of his thoughts as the chatter of voices reached his ears. He was at the Great Hall. He took a deep breath for walking in his eyes instantly looking for Harry. The air in his lungs left his body at what he saw. Ginny Weasley was hanging all over Harry. Kissing his cheek, pressing her breast against his arm. Draco held back tears as he watched Ginny turn Harry’s head and kiss him full on the lips.
Early the next morning, Harry woke. He was lying on his back with Draco cuddled up close to his side. One of Draco’s legs was slung possessively over Harry’s. Harry looked down at his naked body, relieved to see that his cock had returned to its normal, pre-curse size.
Harry struggled to his feet. “Where is he anyway?” Harry asked, looking around the common room in vain for his friend.
After lunch, Harry had a free period. He locked himself in his room and stripped naked, standing in front of his full-length mirror. He tried to see himself through Malfoy’s eyes: would Draco (or indeed any gay man) find Harry as sexy as Harry’s cock found Draco? Harry looked at himself, considering the question. He was still shorter than most other men his age and very skinny despite the Hogwarts food. His ribs had more definition than any of his muscles did. He tilted his head to one side. He supposed he had an OK-looking face, his glasses giving him a sort of cute, geeky vibe. His torso, however, was a disappointment. It seemed like his chest couldn’t decide whether it wanted him to be an otter or a twink (terms he had learned from
“Thank you, Kreacher,” said Harry, flushing slightly. “But maybe wait until I’ve told you what I want before agreeing, yeah?” Harry took a deep breath then said very quickly, “Could you please go to the newsagents in Hogsmeade and get me a gay porn magazine?”
“Of course I want your help,” Harry replied, throat dry. “You’re really fit and, besides, I’ve been cur-”
The first time it happened, Harry thought nothing of it. He was a teenage boy, after all. He was meant to get unwanted erections occasionally. But then it kept happening and gradually Harry began to notice a pattern. Every time he saw Draco Malfoy, he got an immediate and rock-hard boner.
But Malfoy shot Harry a panicked look and began to run, calling over his shoulder, “I haven’t done anything to you, Potter. Just leave me alone!”
Harry ripped the tapestry to one side to reveal a staircase. Malfoy was just reaching the top. Harry saw him as he darted to the left and out of sight again. Harry groaned as he felt his cock grow even more, the tip pushing its way out the bottom of his underwear and beginning to inch down his leg. As Harry began to climb the stairs – which was made challenging by the increasing size of the package he was carrying – he called out, “Please! Wait, Malfoy! I don’t want to hurt you!”
And with that, Harry left the library and set out to find Malfoy. As he reached the entrance hall, he was about to get out the Marauder’s Map again to help with his search, when he saw Malfoy ahead, just turning into the corridor that Harry knew led to the Slytherin Common Room. Harry instantly felt himself go rock hard. Now that he knew to look out for it, he was sure he could also feel his cock growing bigger and filling out his underwear even more than it had before.
Harry was on fire with pleasure as Malfoy simultaneously fucked his arse and sucked his cock. Draco kept hitting Harry’s prostate with each thrust and Harry could feel his release building. He felt Draco’s movements become more erratic and then he stilled as he came inside Harry’s arse. It was enough to send Harry over the edge and, before he had any chance to warn Draco, his newly-augmented balls began to release copious amounts of come. It was too much for Malfoy’s mouth; he let Harry’s cock fall from his lips, still spewing come all over Draco.
“Not quite, Ron, no. But it’s – oh, Harry, I’m afraid you’re not going to like this very much.” She paused and looked at him thoughtfully. “Or, I don’t know, perhaps you will.”
“No time like the present,” Hermione said. “And anyway, the sooner I know exactly what we’re dealing with, the sooner I can help find a counter-curse.”
The colour drained from Harry’s face, but it was Ron who spoke first, looking shocked and revolted: “Harry’s got to fall in love with the pointy git to break the curse?” he asked.
He felt Draco stir beside him. He looked down as grey-blue eyes blinked sleepily up at him. It was the most adorable sight, made even better by Draco’s cherubic soft blond hair framing his face, all messed up and untidy from sex and sleep. Harry thought that he could get used to waking up like this every morning.
About twenty minutes later, Kreacher reappeared carrying a brown paper bag. He handed this over to Harry along with his change. “Kreacher hopes Master enjoys himself,” he said as he left, smirking.
and imagining some of those activities happening to him. He thought of lips wrapped around his cock and a hot hard dick pushing into his arse. And if the person doing all this to Harry in his imagination happened to be blond, well, that didn’t mean anything. Right?
Harry handed Kreacher several galleons and Kreacher bowed deeply before disappearing with another loud crack. Harry slumped back onto his bed. Nervous excitement pooled in the pit of his stomach as he waited with equal anticipation and dread for Kreacher’s return.
Ron groaned and covered his face in his hands. Hermione smiled kindly at Harry and gently patted him on the arm. “Good luck,” she said.
Harry looked around surreptitiously to make sure they weren’t being overheard. Dean and Ginny were playing Gobstones at the other end of the room, but otherwise they were alone. “Every time I see Malfoy,” Harry whispered, “I get an erection.”
His erection throbbed, rubbing sensuously against the inside of his pants. Not for the first time, Harry was struck by how good these Malfoy-induced erections felt compared to ‘normal’ ones. Suddenly, Harry remembered what he was doing here. He quickly left the library and made his way back to his dorm. He found it harder going back with his stiff cock impeding his gait. He hoped no-one could see it through the front of his robes.
“Hang on, I’m busy with the potion,” she called back. “Ron, get some parchment and a quill from by bag”.
He shut himself in his dorm room. He had been so grateful over the last few days that the eighth years had private dorms. It had made it much easier for him to relieve the tension each time he saw Malfoy and now it was going to come in useful again. Still, Harry was a little nervous. He wasn’t quite sure what he wanted the outcome of his little test to be. Whatever the answer, however, it had to be better than not knowing.
Hang on… Something made Harry pause. He could have sworn his cock wasn’t always this big. He was certain he had never felt his cock brush against his belly button like this before. It must all be connected, Harry thought. Malfoy was making him bigger. Not just by making him unbearably hard whenever he saw his stupid sexy pointy nose and pouty lips around the school but somehow, somehow, Malfoy was actually making Harry’s cock grow.
Hermione burst out laughing. Harry scowled at her. This really wasn’t the reaction he’d been expecting. He was panicking here. Hermione was wiping tears out of her eyes. “So, let me get this straight, Harry,” she said, still chuckling. “You think you’ve been cursed because Malfoy makes you hard?”
“Hi,” said Harry, equally shy. Their lips met and they kissed softly. Draco’s hand reached up to touch Harry’s neck and then he trailed his fingertips lower. Suddenly he stopped and pulled away from the kiss.
“Madness,” said Ron, still chuckling slightly. “Why would any self-respecting wizard want your face on their junk?”
Trying to ignore the fact that Hermione had essentially just ordered him to have a wank, Harry nodded dumbly and then hurried off to the nearest boys’ toilets.
“Hermione, I’ve been cursed,” he said, breathlessly, having just run to find his friend. Hermione looked up from the large book she had open in front of her as she sat by the Common Room fire.
But Malfoy paid no attention to Harry’s words. As Harry reached the top of the stairs and spun round to the left, he caught sight of Malfoy entering a disused classroom. Another surge of growth came over him. His cock grew further down the inside of his trouser leg, the tip now closer to his knee than his hip. Running was now almost impossible with the tight fabric of his jeans pressing his cock painfully into the side of his leg and his heavy balls pushing down on the gusset. Harry half-staggered, half-limped to the classroom Malfoy had entered. He wrenched open the door and there was Malfoy, looking angry against the far wall. At last, he had nowhere left to run. Growing again, Harry dragged himself toward him.
Malfoy’s eyes went round in astonishment, his gaze fixed on Harry’s dick. Harry didn’t know what to say and neither, it seemed, did Malfoy. He was too busy staring hungrily at the sight in front of him. Harry suddenly realised that Malfoy was lusting after him and his impressive proportions. Emboldened by this thought, Harry spoke cockily (and really, it was difficult for him to be anything else at the moment), “Hey, Malfoy, I was wondering: can you help me with this?” and he pointed to his prick with the index finger of each hand.
"Yes, you should have told me you needed time. I would've understood. I'm sorry as well I shouldn't have kissed you that night..."
“It was brilliant really. So, she Weasley was hanging on Potter because Thomas broke up with her so he could date Finnigan, so she is hanging all over him and he just looks annoyed. Then out of no where she kisses him,” Draco flinched but Pansy continued not noticing, “Potter just snaps suddenly and starts screaming at her saying that he never actually wanted her and that he only dated her cause that what everyone wanted from him and that he was actually gay and never found her attractive and that she should find someone else to throw herself at cause he was never taking her back then he storms out of the hall. The look on her face as she was left sitting there with everyone staring at her was so hilarious.  Her face turned as red and her ratty hair I wish you could have seen it.” Pansy laughed remembering Ginny’s face.
“We’re here.” The driver said pulling up to a decent looking house. Draco paid him and got out. He stood on the street for a moment just looking at the place. He took a couple of deep breaths and walked up to the door before he could knock it swung open.
"MINE!" Harry groaned biting the back of Draco's neck so hard there was sure to be a mark there for weeks. Draco yelled out as he came squeezing down on Harry making him cum soon after. Harry stayed buried deep inside Draco. He didn't want to pull out tell he was sure every drop of his cum was inside. He released Draco's neck noting with a small sense of pride how deep the bite marks were. He laid down on his side forcing Draco to do the same. The pale blonde whimpered a little at the shifting but otherwise stayed silent. Harry checked the time and saw that it was four am. He was thankful that there were no classes today he wanted to stay with his Draco all day. He reluctantly pulled out and whispered a cleaning spell. Draco rolled over as Harry pulled the blankets back over them. He gave Harry a quick kiss before falling asleep. Harry smiled, wrapping his arms around Draco, and pulling him close. Harry was soon asleep as well.
"...I'll mail Severus, he will make the needed potions tell you can. He can also help you at school. Don’t worry Draco everything will be okay." His father reassured putting his arm around his son’s shoulders. Things were okay. Years went by without anyone figuring out Draco's secret. He even through the war Draco's secret remained hidden, tell now. He had returned to Hogwarts to finish his schooling like many of his peers. The new headmistress had set up a special house for the eighth years. Since there wasn't very many of them, they all got a small room to themselves. Which was perfect for Draco because he could brew the potions he needed in privacy. He wishes he had just stayed in his room and feigned being sick. He shouldn't have tried to go to the ingredient closet. His heat had hit him quite suddenly. He thought he had at least a day left before but he was wrong. When he had felt the first wave coming, he ducted into a bathroom. Unbeknownst to him a green-eyed brunette was taking a stroll at the same time and had seen Draco rush into the bathroom. Worried for the blonde he followed. Now he stood in the bathroom inhaling the sweetest most intoxicating scent he has ever smelt.
It only took a second before Harry started to kiss back. As he grabbed Draco's hips and slipped his tongue into his mouth, he could smell that sweet scent again. Urged on by the smell he broke the kiss and stood up. He quickly tugged off his shirt and Draco gasped. Years of quidditch had done wonders for Harry's body. Harry smirked and unbuckled his belt and sliding his pants down stepping out of them when they pooled around his feet. Draco forgot how to breath. The hard bulge trapped in Harry's tight boxers made Draco's mind race with perverted thoughts. He could feel the slick start to leak down his thighs as he continued to stare at Harry's pelvis.
“Do you want me to be your blood donor?” Draco moaned as Harry played with his nipple through his shirt.
“I hate that you came in like five minutes ago and you still look better then me.” Blaise huffed jokingly giving Draco a thumbs up. Draco laughed and grabbed Blaise’s hand. The two made their way into the main part of the club. When they got into the main part, they went to their designated arears. Draco was the bartender and Blaise was serving. S&M (Slave & Master) was a club that allowed people that were into the slave and master kink to come and relax without fear of being judged. It also was a place where people who didn’t have a master/slave could come and maybe find one. Private rooms were provided for those that wanted to form a contract and employees were always available to help if needed, they also had playrooms that could be rented.
"Yes, but it will have to be in my office. I still have some stuff to unpack." Draco sighed knowing that if he said no Harry would just follow him around until he agreed to talk.
“Harry mate are you listening?” Ron almost yelled snapping Harry from his thoughts. He looked around and discovered that Hermione and Ron had sat down across from him. He also saw that Ginny was sitting extremely close to him.  Ginny had broken up with a few weeks after the war. Harry had discovered her in bed with someone else, she had dumped him right then and there. He had left The Burrow a few days later and traveled around the wizarding world. It was on that trip that he became a vampire. He had met another wizard named Edward and his lover Jacob (A/N: >.>) they hit off and spent the evening drinking. Somehow, they made it back to Harry’s hotel room, at some point Edward revealed that he was a vampire, which amazed Harry because it was his first-time meeting one. Harry couldn’t remember exactly what happened but when he woke up, he was a vampire. Edward apologized profusely and felt horrible, but Harry reassured him he was just as much at fault, and kind of remembers asking to be one. It was then that Harry got to drink from Jacob who was Edwards’s blood donor. Harry contacted McGonagall asking for help. He never returned to The Burrow and instead stayed at 12 Grimmauld Place. He spent the rest of the break cleaning the place up and going through things. Kreacher, who Harry had set free after the war, was more then happy to help Harry and was hired as caretaker.
“I’ve never wanted anything more.” Draco said pulling Harry’s head down for a kiss. The two kissed as Harry finished pushing into Draco. When he was fully inside, he paused for a moment to give them both time to adjust.
“Yes, so leave it all to me starlight. Now close your eyes and get some sleep because in the morning I’ll be fulfilling one of my many fantasies about you.” Harry teased softly slapping Draco’s round ass. Draco giggled softly. Both men soon gave into sleep and dreamed of what tomorrow morning had in store for them.
“YOU I BELONG TO YOU NOW PLEASE FUCK ME!” Draco yelled out grabbing his legs and holding them open. Harry smirked and slammed into Draco’s tight hole all at once. Draco yelled out as he suddenly came all over his chest, some landing on his face. Harry moved Draco’s legs to wrap around his hips. He grabbed a fist full of Draco’s hair forcing Draco to tilt his head to the side so Harry had perfect access to Draco’s neck.
“Let’s eat up in my room…where there aren’t as many eyes.” Harry whispered to Draco pecking him on the lips before leading him out of the Great Hall. A roar of voices could be heard before the doors closed. Draco stayed silent has Harry lead up to his private room they sat on Harry’s bed and Draco began to eat.
“Go clean yourself.” Harry said, Draco lifted his head and looked at where Harry was pointing. He quickly got up and went into the room. When he was done, he quickly made his way back to the spot and got back down on his knees.
“So, are you looking to be a slave or looking to be a master or just curious?” Draco asked, he nodded to the other bartender to handle the drinks for a bit while he chatted with Harry.
"Yes, please fuck me with your dick. Fuck me tell all I can think about is your cock!" Draco yelled shacking his hips to try and tempt Harry. It worked, before he could say anything else Harry was pushing into him. He yelled out in pleasure, Harry was bigger than he thought, he could feel himself stretching to accommodate him.
"You didn't answer my question Malfoy are you okay?" Harry asked again subconsciously getting closer to the stall door.
“His here! Professor Harry is here at the bar and he saw me! He fucking saw me dressed like this!” Draco said tears welling up in his eyes.
“Where the bloody hell have you been? We looked everywhere for you! Did you hear about what happened in the Great Hall this morning?” Pansy gasped out when they finely reached him. She really needs to exercise more.
“I think that just about covers everything. Think you can handle it?” Harry asked, watching as Draco tucked all his stuff neatly into his bag.
“Draco! Come in come in.” Harry said stepping to the side to let Draco step in, “Let me take your coat!” Harry said helping Draco shrug it off.
“Shit!” He mumbled pulling out his phone quickly, silencing it. He mouthed sorry to everyone before packing up his stuff and walking out. He unlocked his phone and looked to see who had called him. He was shocked to see that it had been Harry. In the two months Draco had been his TA Harry hadn’t called Draco once not even a text message. He quickly pressed the call back button, Harry answered on the third ring.
“LOOK AT ME!” Harry ordered, pleased when Draco’s eye’s snapped open to meet his. He continued to thrust in and out of Draco, watching every wave of pleasure wash over Draco’s face. Harry leaned forward tell their foreheads met, their breath mingling together.
"Of course, you would be the one to find me Potter." Malfoy gasped out pushing himself against the stall door praying Potter would just go away.
“Oh, shut it,” Draco mumbled before continuing, “like I was saying we talked,” Blaise snorted “and we discovered that we both like one another so we started dating and yes Blaise we did fuck are you happy now?” Draco asked as Blaise pushed a finger though the circle his other hand was making.
"It seems like your friend is having trouble might want to go check on him." Malfoy sighed turning back around.
No one saw Harry and Draco for two days. When the two showed up in the Great Hall on the third day Harry had his arm wrapped around Draco's waist.  The bite mark very visible on Draco's neck along with some deep hickeys.  Even the Hufflepuff's could figure out that Draco was an omega, and not just any omega but Harry Potters omega. He secret was no longer a secret and to be honest. Draco couldn't be happier about it.
"I can't imagine a few small creatures are enough to fill you up." Draco mumbled tilting his head slightly giving Harry a better view of his neck.
“I haven’t eaten since yesterday so I’m a little hungry.” Draco mumbled his face turning bright red.
“Never a dull moment with you around…” Draco mumbled as the doors closed. Harry laughed and grabbed Draco’s hand.
“I’m sorry if you don’t want to talk about it, we don’t have to.” Harry said coming up behind Draco.
"Harry, it feels so good. You feel so good!" Draco rambled not thinking straight anymore. Harry just groaned loudly before burying his face into Draco’s neck. He could feel his stomach muscles tighten, he was close.
Draco slowly woke up, he looked around and was surprised to see that he was in bed. The last thing he remembered was soaking in the bath with Harry after their wonderful session.
“HARRY!” Ginny screeched getting up from her seat and running over. She pushed Draco to the side and latched onto Harry’s arm.
"I think I would like it very much if you kissed me again." Draco replied he was sucker for green eyes.
Ron looked at her as if she’d just asked whether he wanted to marry a Crumple-horned Snorcack. “Nah, I’m all right, thanks,” he said in a strangled voice.
Hermione pulled him out of his reverie. “Harry,” she said gently, “Harry – oh, do be quiet, Ron! – are you OK? Talk to us, Harry.”
At last, Hermione seemed to believe him. She became suddenly business-like and Harry could see a gleam in her eye – the same one she got whenever there was a new problem for her to solve. “Right, Harry, don’t worry. We’re going to fix this,” she said. “First things first: I think I need to see this for myself.”
“But it’s just the curse, isn’t it?” Ron said through a mouthful of chocolate cake. “It’s not like Harry actually fancies the ferrety git.”
Malfoy disappeared from sight round a corner. Groaning in frustration, Harry began to chase him. One way or another, he was going to solve this problem tonight. Harry tore along the corridor and caught a glimpse of Malfoy as he ducked through a tapestry to his left. It was enough; Harry felt his cock twitch as it grew a bit more, the fabric of his pants straining to contain it all.
Draco pulled back to give his mouth a rest. He wrapped one hand around Harry’s cock, which was so thick that Draco couldn’t get his fingers all the way around. With his other hand on Harry’s chest, he pushed Harry backwards into the nearest desk. He kept pushing so that Harry was lying over the desk. Draco knelt down again and pushed Potter’s legs up and away so he could get better access. He spread Harry’s arse cheeks wide to reveal his pink and quivering hole. Draco licked a long stripe along the crack and then proceeded to circle Harry’s hole with his tongue. Harry whimpered as he experienced what he was sure was the best sensation in the whole wide world. Malfoy continued to lap enthusiastically at Harry’s arse, his tongue slipping past the tight ring of muscle and deep inside Harry.
This, Harry decided, was not normal. But the evidence was irrefutable. Whenever he saw Malfoy in the corridors or in the Great Hall for meals or in one of the two classes they shared (Potions and Charms), Harry instantly became stiffer than he had ever thought possible, throbbing with need and unable to think about much else other than when he would next be able to wank to relieve the pressure. One time when this happened in class, Harry had become so distracted that he accidently tipped an entire flask of hippopotamus phlegm into his potion which promptly bubbled over and turned Harry’s textbook into bright pink candy floss. Malfoy had laughed and Harry swore he became even harder as he watched Malfoy’s lips smirk at him. It was all he could do to stop himself rutting against the edge of his desk.
“Right, we better get working quickly then, hadn’t we,” and she passed Harry a large pile of books. Harry took the top one and began to flick through it but there didn’t seem to be anything resembling his situation. After twenty minutes or so of fruitless searching, he was beginning to get grumpy. Why did Hogwarts library have so many books about sexual curses anyway?
He was also finally forced to conclude that something must have happened to him. He could just about convince himself that it was a peculiar quirk of his body to get hard every time he saw Malfoy but there was definitely no logical explanation for his cock getting bigger other than-
Well, that settles it, Harry thought to himself. Definitely a little bit gay. That still didn’t explain, though, why Draco Malfoy was having such an effect on Harry. When they had both returned for eighth year, they had largely kept out of each other’s way. Malfoy certainly wasn’t openly hostile to him anymore but it wasn’t as if he was nice to Harry either. However, Harry could appreciate how attractive Malfoy was. Perhaps that’s all it was, just his body’s natural reaction to Malfoy’s soft blond hair and perfect skin and cute nose. Almost involuntarily, Harry began to imagine Malfoy licking at his arsehole just like the blond boy in the magazine. Merlin, he was going to have to wank again.
Thankfully, the next day Ron showed no sign of remembering their drunken conversation. Harry was glad; he was not sure he could convince a sober Ron that his questions had been entirely motivated by innocent curiosity. Harry was forced to admit, however, that he was extremely attracted to Draco Malfoy. Now he just needed to decide what he was going to do about it.
Harry took himself behind the screen, kicked of his trainers and undid the button of his jeans. As he was pulling them off, he reflected that that had to be one of the weirdest moments of his time at Hogwarts, surpassing by quite some margin his previous top three (spending an hour disguised as Goyle, stalking his past self at the end of third year and, of course, each and every conversation he’d ever had with Luna). Here he was, standing in the kitchens with his two best friends and around fifty House Elves, with no trousers on, about to stoke himself to hardness so he could measure his cock and then call out those numbers to the waiting room. Ah well, he should probably get on with it.
It was Friday, the end of a very long week, and Harry and Ron had decided to walk down to Hogsmeade for drinks at the
“Are you kidding?” said Malfoy. “That was the hottest thing ever! Although I would quite like a cleaning charm now.”
But Harry was unable to explain about the curse because Malfoy had leaned forward and was licking the tip of Harry’s cock. Harry’s sentence was cut off in a long moan as he felt Draco’s tongue swirl around the head. He was so big now there was no way Malfoy could fit it all in his mouth but he seemed to be making a valiant effort to do just that. Harry moaned again; the curse seemed to have magnified not just the size of his cock, but also its sensitivity. This was so much better than anything he'd ever imagined.
“Suit yourself,” Hermione replied, and she put the glasses back on and turned her attention back to Harry. After a few seconds she said, “I think that’s all I need to see. Come on, let’s go get him.”
Malfoy leaned back and said reverently, “You’re so sexy, Potter, with your big sexy cock and you’re just so fucking hot-” Harry kissed him again. Draco began to alternate between kissing Harry’s mouth and kissing the head of Harry’s cock, which was roughly in line with his nipples. Harry could taste his own pre-come on Draco’s mouth. His new balls seemed to be producing copious amounts of the stuff and the taste was intoxicating.
His hand shaking slightly, Harry reached into the bag and pulled out the magazine Kreacher had bought for him. On the cover was a picture of a dark-haired young man, showing off his smooth and perfectly sculpted torso. As Harry watched the moving photograph, the wizard winked cheekily at him then lowered the waistband of his pants slightly so that Harry caught a glimpse of the dark pubes below. Above the wizard’s head was the title of the magazine:
“But I don’t hate Malfoy,” Harry protested. “I don’t think I’ve hated him all year. Now that the war is over, these petty schoolboy rivalries seem just a little bit, well, petty. But if I don’t hate him anymore, why is my cock still getting bigger every time I seem him?” There was a note of panic in Harry’s voice now.
What was impressive, though, was Harry’s cock and balls. He had been idly stroking himself to full hardness while looking at his reflection and now released his grip so he could admire the full effect. His balls swung low between his legs, each about the size of a chicken’s egg. His cock stood tall, curving up nicely out of a bush of dark hair, the tip brushing against his belly button.
“Because,” Hermione said, scanning the rest of the information about the curse, “it’s not enough just not to hate Malfoy anymore. Remember the name of the curse: ‘Enemies to Lovers’.”
Harry walked round the corner and his eyes immediately fell on Malfoy, drawn to him like a gay moth to a flame. Instantly, he felt that familiar intense pleasure as his cock sprang to attention. The force of it almost caused him to stagger backwards. Meanwhile, Hermione was watching Harry’s reaction with interest through her special glasses. She took them off and held them out to Ron. “Do you want to have a look, too?” she asked.
He caught Kreacher’s eye from across the kitchen. He smirked at Harry, who had the horrible impression that the elf knew exactly what he had been thinking about. Harry remembered why he was there and reached for the tape measure Hermione had conjured. He placed it alongside his cock.
Kreacher raised a single eyebrow. “Master wants Kreacher to buy him gay porn?” he asked. “Does Master have any preference? Kreacher knows that there are many such magazines available:
The collected Harry who was valiantly attempting to resist the urge to palm himself through his trousers. When they were out of earshot of the courtyard, Hermione said, “I’m going to the library to start researching this thing. Harry, you can meet me there after you’ve gone to the nearest bathroom, measured yourself again and taken care of that thing. Come with me, Ron.”
Harry let out a low breath. He hadn’t even realised he’d been holding it in. Suddenly keen to see more, he eagerly pulled the magazine open to the centre page. Across the double page stood the same man from the cover, naked now. He was lazily tugging on his cock, biting his lip in sultry concentration, his eyes never leaving Harry’s face. Harry was breathing hard now and he could feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. Harry continued to flick through the magazine and saw images of wizards sucking each other and fucking each other and one particularly fascinating one where a blond wizard was enthusiastically lapping at another wizard’s arsehole with his tongue. Harry spent a long time looking at that image. It was all undeniably
When he reached the doors of the library, he slowed down to catch his breath. This was the first time he had deliberately looked at Malfoy rather than catching sight of him by accident. Part of Harry was excited, knowing what was about to happen. Harry tried very hard to ignore that part. Taking one last deep, shuddering breath, Harry stepped into the library and made his way over to the desk he knew Malfoy and his friends were sitting at. Harry skulked behind the bookshelf and then peeked round the edge. His breath hitched as he saw the platinum blond hair. Malfoy was sucking on the end of his quill and then he burst out laughing at something Parkinson had said. Madam Pince hushed him fiercely and Malfoy tried to stifle his giggles, shoulders shaking with supressed mirth. Harry was instantly hard. Malfoy looked so good when he laughed. Foolishly, Harry wished he could make Malfoy laugh like that.
“WOW!” Harry exclaimed looking around his office. In the few minutes it had taken Harry to rinse the dishes and put them in the dish washer, Draco had picked up all the books and put them away and had cleared his desk off.
“Your so fucking tight Draco.” Harry groaned grabbing the back of Draco’s neck and pushing him down tell his head was on the bed. He was able to go so much deeper in the new position.
"Welcome to 12 Grimmauld place. My godfather Sirius Black left it to me. Who if I remember correctly is your cousin?" Harry said grabbing Draco's hand and leading him inside.
“Time for my lunch.” Harry groaned as he licked up Draco’s neck. He could hear Draco’s heartbeat speed up, could feel Draco’s plus under his lips as he kissed the spot he was going to bite. Harry pulled back as tell only the tip of his penis was inside Draco, then he slammed back in, at the same time biting into Draco’s skin. Warm blood flooded his mouth, making Harry moan. Draco came again when Harry started to suck the blood into his mouth. Harry soon followed, shooting his cum deep into Draco. Harry drank Draco’s blood for a bit longer before pulling away. He licked at the bite mark to help it heal faster and to catch the blood that dripped out. Harry gave the bite mark a small kiss before rolling off Draco and to the side. They laid there in silence as they both recovered. Draco rolled onto his side and smiled when Harry curled around him wrapping an arm around his waist.
