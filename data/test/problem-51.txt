Harry closes his eyes.  It’s not too big of a concession- the castle still has countless forgotten secrets, and dozens and dozens of secret alcoves and rooms, but still.
The motion- running a hand through windswept hair - brings to mind his father- his - James.  Harry is nothing like him and he has never been so terribly, utterly, aware of this fact, like looking straight into the glaringly obvious prism of reflection.  James, ineffable and affable, the popular beyond belief Gryffindor king, bully and heartbreaker in equal measure- no, Harry isn’t like that, despite looking like a near picture-perfect carbon copy of him, exterior-wise.

“I,” he says, weakly, the sound of Potter’s running echoing in his mind, his bruised spine pressing into the wall and he hadn’t even noticed the pain but he does, now.  He does, now.  He wraps his arms around his knees, presses his face into the damp, thick, fabric, of his robes, and breathes in, unsteadily.  His jawline is still dotted with Potter’s bruising kisses, his mouth’s still swollen.
“You are to kill Albus Dumbledore.” The monster hisses, and Draco smiles.

It absconds in a billow of furling silver, and he is at once alive and not, head spinning as he desperately tries to reconcile the friendly open faces he knows with the angry narrowed eyes of Hermione, a potent simmering brown, and the bright blue of Ron.  There’s something to say, something they’ll expect him to say- but there’s nothing he

He repeats it, facing east, south, and west, respectively.  The Magic is alive now, sharp and interested and alert.

War’s ugly.  Draco knows, he knows, but he doesn’t have much of a choice.  War’s ugly, but it’s coming.

Draco Malfoy is not James Potter and neither is Harry; none of them are vibrant enough to play the dazzling glow of Lily Evans, even for a moment, but he can see the vague outlines and similarities and he feels a crushing, desolating, sense of despair, because this cannot be all that there is, doomed overwritten love sagas that play out across the years and kill and strangle and choke and burn out in a flood of brilliance (and take Severus with them.  When Lily Evans Potter fell, he fell with her.  If Draco Malfoy fails and dies, the Unbreakable Vow will take Severus with him.  That is his part, the terribly willing tagalong, and he plays it the only way he knows how- scornfully).

He retracts the wicked claws he has grown, the sharpness of his teeth, cools the anger that is sated, barely.  The Muggle scum is a bleeding shredded mess of clarified fat on the rugged carpet.  Kreacher takes his leave.)
It’s just a tattoo, for now.  After he murders Dumbledore and brings filth into his home, the Dark Lord will animate it with his magic, and it will be there forever, Draco will never be able to remove it.

something and she’d interrupted him.
He reaches into schoolbag, yanks a quill and parchment out of his bag in sharp, jerky, movements.  “What should I be writing?” Harry asks, teeth gritted.
“Back then, we’d brought Lockhart, to use as basilisk bait, or just as a trade-in for Ginny, I think.  He was trying to run away, the cowardly git.” Harry says the last bit almost fondly- it’s been so long, he no longer holds any animosity for Lockhart.  He has so many other things to hate, after all.

Harry’s breathing too hard, panting and digging his nails into his palms; he takes a deep breath.  Blood is dripping from his nails.
Draco makes a frustrated noise, slides his hands around to grip the nape of Potter’s neck, and seeks out Potter’s mouth with his own, fitting their lips together and swallowing Potter’s surprised gasp.
Harry asks her.  When she says no, he rifles through a book of names and lands on Aoife.  He tells her it means beautiful, radiant, because she
He shoves her away, fingers scraping raw against her jumper, the fug of panic globing his thoughts into concentricity, into spheres that write their own source codes, into self-perpetuating chambers of dim, echoing, portent.  He cannot think properly; when he tilts his head back he smells smoke and burning, burning.
He really, really, wants to be a Parselmouth, and it is that that sends him bolt upright, a shaking hand doing up his shirt buttons, slowly.
Slowly, carefully, Harry spreads fingers on the bruises and concentrates.  He can’t get all of them- he leaves the biggest ink-colored bruise on his hip, but he gets most of the fresh bruises, watching as they fade.  Yellow green, the color of safety.
Bellatrix cackles so hard tears spring to her eyes; she dabs at them with a polished talon (since her return, she has been cleaned up, most likely at the behest of the Dark Lord).  “You’ll see soon enough, baby Malfoy.”
Thankfully, the Dark Lord Voldemort is not present at the breakfast table, although Bella is, her dark hair falling in sleek curls, her heavy-lidded eyes alive with intelligence and cunning and just a graze of madness (it is, after all, but 6 o’clock).  “Baby Malfoy!” She coos when Draco takes a seat and helps himself to some toast.
“My Lord?”
“Eilonwy,” She says, finally, like he’s passed inspection.  “Eilonwy Selwyn.”

No, it isn’t the blood purity, really.  Purebloods aren’t fucking stupid, they understand the dangers of inbreeding. Magic is magic and magic is might; fresh blood is always appreciated.

Harry has Aoife coiled sunnily around his neck, under the Cloak, and he’s making for the second-floor girl’s bathroom, and, by extension, the Chamber of Secrets. Hopefully, he’ll avoid the prefects on patrol-
“I- I’m sorry,” Harry rasps out after an age, looking everywhere but their eyes, concentrating on the freckle adjoining the hinge of Ron’s jaw, he can’t look at glittering blue or brown, so fucking familiar and strange and at once the dichotomy pains him.

Potter's mouth falls open, and it shouldn’t be so attractive- stupid, boorish, Gryffindor, Draco tells himself - but Circe, it is.
He’s been staring, mouth parted.  He needs to stop doing that, but Harry finds himself veering into his mind far too easily these days, falling prey to the drift of thoughts like poetry, and his skull is a cage of bone and misdirection and he cannot possibly break through.  Harry’s mind is in shambling disarray, he notes, thoughts strewn like paper fireworks across the vast, eolian, abyss he has yet to plumb. Wind-strewn, mussed, quicksilver thoughts skating across the icy rime of perception, emotion a thick tinge illuminating and individuating the violence-wrung wreck of him, sea brine and blood.
McGonagall smiles, a rare occasion made all the rarer by the fond shine to her eyes- which are, Harry realizes, a very pale shade of blue, colored with startling complexity, like the grains of a star.  “Well, Mr. Potter.  I daresay you’re the best student for the job.”

He… well.  Harry can’t do much else but stare, really.  The walls are wallpapered in soft minty greens and blues, the bookshelves stocked with several out-of-print Dark texts, a fully equipped terrarium for Aoife, and there’s a huge bed hung with filmy white netting (the thick velvet draperies close him in, remind him of the cupboard and fear and culpability) and a blood magic setup and several different rooms and it’s- well, it’s everything he could have dreamed of for a house of his own.  A house of his own- the thought is laughable, unattainable, a miracle of untouched optimism.

“What.” Draco chokes out after several long moments of staring, dumbfounded.

“Harry, m’boy!” Harry’s hurrying to meet Malfoy; he wants to be early, he feels something deep in his bones, something he doesn’t quite understand.  Quickening in his blood, the feeling of deep-seated longing for something he cannot verbalize, lapping at the slick walls of his veins like schools of fish, until his hands are shaking from the intensity. He does not understand, but he knows this:
an alliance with the Lestranges.
When the nightmares get so bad he can’t sit on his bed without a surge of remembering terror, he thinks
And, when we get to the next chapter, we'll start to see some major canon divergence.  This fic isn't about taking down Voldemort, btw.  This is a drarry fic, and the ending is ambiguous (relatively) but you can assume that Harry will eventually take down Voldemort and his horcruxes? idk it'll work out.  (or not hehe). Just! My point is that this is a story of their relationship and Harry and his Slytherin side.  There is plot, and there is a vanquished evil, but it isn't... necessarily.... Voldemort.  This is confusing, I know.  Anyway, THERE WILL BE CANON DIVERGENCE. BEEP BEEP.  CANON DIVERGENCE TRAIN, COMING THROUGH.  MAKE WAY, MAKE WAY, FOR THE SEA OF CANON DIVERGENCE, LED BY THE MERRY SHIP "JOANNE'S A BITCH". (God, that didn't even make sense in my head)
Afterwards, the house elves clear the dishes with snaps of their fingers and Draco is dismissed.  Heart beating fast, he slips into the library and loses himself in old grimoires, searching for that countercurse.
He is bereft, he is thestral-colored inside, he is laconic and marmoreal and something he cannot define but is perhaps the exact shade of nothingness, he is not anything close to the Harry James Potter they think they know.

He thumbs the head of his cock, hissing in pleasure, and fists himself slowly, working from the root to the sensitive tip, over and over and over.

Voldemort smiles; a glint of teeth.

Harry’s head jerks up.
He sleeps in the Room of Requirement and gasps, flails really, awake at night, his dreams appellated ceaselessly, senselessly, by the spectre of a meaty purple face and sour breath and pain.  Always, always, pain, always the sense of something inside him that does not belong, face pressed to the carpet and breathing hitched until he thinks he’ll wake up to the indent of Petunia’s spotless rugs on his cheek.
He takes Malfoy apart with his eyes, weighing every interaction, splicing every angle, evaluating the long spinning dichotomy between the Malfoy of Now and the Malfoy of Then, adjusting knobs and turning dials as one might turn a rose, with an artist’s delicacy, because the answer to this is important.  It could change- things.  Certain obscure things, Harry thinks, certain obscure things. He has never had time for poetry but the quote’s lingered with him since he saw it on a Muggle T-Shirt in third year.

Noteworthy: Draco isn’t used to seeing Harry Potter weak.  Oh, Potter, face slicked in grime, blood, sweat, various indeterminable fluids - those great, terrible, eyes glowing with inextinguishable viridescence- that is familiar.

“There was a rockfall,” Harry says, voice subdued, “And Ron and Lockhart were trapped on one side.  I-I knew I’d have to go on alone.” His eyes trace the crisp engravings, that beloved slickness.  Slime, water washing over tile, the rasp of a basilisk’s scales.  That familiar terror thudding, juddering in the pulse at his throat, the thin skin at his wrists, breaths sobbing harshly, singeing his throat with the force of them, the expiation.  The weight of a sword’s pommel in his unformed hands.  And afterwards, his hands hanging limply by his sides, heart hammering a ferris wheel in his chest until he couldn’t breathe for the terribly, lingering, pounding, for

Draco wakes at exactly 6 o’clock, slipping off his pyjamas and folding them in a precise pile at the foot of his bed, pulling on his robes in sharp, measured, movements, fingers nimbly doing up the stays and ties; at this point, it’s second nature.
Professor McGonagall looks at him a moment longer, those sharp eyes ticking all over what feels like the various planes of his existence, and then is off in a whirl of sensible robes, a tartan scarf, and the faint powdery scent of violet water.

My next update will not be for a couple of months.  Why? Well, because, quite frankly, the way I write things- I write chapters and post them directly after i have finished, which is most likely fueled by the temptation of instant gratification (aka me being a comments/kudos whore ;) - is just not feasible. It isn’t sustainable.  Therefore, I’m looking to create what is called a “buffer”, meaning I’ll have several chapters already written and therefore will be able to post more regularly and confidently.  Which means, unfortunately, your next update won’t be for a long time.

Not a Crucio, but the bruise is spreading somehow.  What had been barely a few inches in diameter is steadily widening, covering more than half his ribcage.  Cursed silver, most likely, but his father’s never hit him with that side of the cane before.  Draco wonders what he did wrong, wonders if he deserved it, wonders if anyone does.
“Ginny,” Harry says, because what else is there to say.  There’s a senseless, inchoate, longing in him, whipping up and frothing like tides against the stark slippery surface of a cliff.  He wants warmth and he wants- he wants the comforting peppery heat of the Burrow, wants the darkness and the meaty purple of Vernon Dursley to never have existed in the first place.  God, if he’d grown up with the Weasley’s…
Carelessly, Potter traces out the words TOM	M A R V O L O	R I D D L E.  They burn, suspended in the chill of the Chamber.  The air around them ripples, warps.  They do not look like they are meant for the cool ache of the Chamber.

Draco exhales, shakily, a hand trailing down to the tie of his pyjamas.  He slips a hand around his aching cock and groans in relief.
He looks at the unyielding shadows of Harry Potter’s green eyes and he sees another life, another pair of green eyes that fought and raged and beamed and flew-

Knowledge does this to him, poring over old books and practicing spellwork until it’s perfect, stirring Potions and slipping into a dreamy haze.  Control, precision.
Here, a boy who has sprung one-handed from death’s jaws, a basilisk’s poisons coursing through his veins negated, head held high- like it is nothing, like to wear death like a cloak is an ordinary occurence, like those eyes are human (they aren’t, they are a god’s eyes masquerading as a mortal’s, their placement on the shatteringly, terribly, human Harry Potter’s face is both a marvel and a horror).
, too- flame-colored hair that floated flame-like upwards, as if color and light weren’t enough for the quivering energy contained within the prism of her glowing skin, as if action, motion were necessary, utterly so.  Jazzy and white-toothed, the peach-colored nib of her earlobe, the pliant cleft of her lower lip, the ferocity of her green green eyes, the color of death and life in equal measure.
It’s the witching hour (when he discovered that particular Muggle name for midnight, he laughed so hard he almost cried) when he sneaks out, an Undetectably-Extended bag carrying the elements of the ritual.
He clears his throat.  “Her name’s Aoife.  She’s- she’s mine, I got her this summer.”
Potter’s tucked under his Invisibility Cloak with him, and the air of their closeness is warm and smells like pine and honey-scented broom polish and the expensive soap (it comes nestled in thick, pretty, parchment and works up to the thickest lathers Draco’s ever seen) that Narcissa buys.

Harry Potter nests unnoticed in the blue-and-bronze hangings, blowing an insouciant kiss to a long-time enemy who is so burdened it is a shock he has not been crushed yet.  Long-time enemy, Severus thinks, and the connections are slow to form but when they
He plasters several Notice-Me-Not Charms over the entrance- he owes Malfoy that much, owes Malfoy more, if he’s honest - and flings the Cloak over himself, running soundlessly on cold stone.  The stones are hard, clipping the soles of his feet and sending shivering aftershocks up the long bones of his shins, frissoning into his kneecaps.  Discomfort, deserved.
Kreacher appears, too, a cup of hot lemon tea in his gnarled hands and is-that-sympathy-in-his-eyes.  Harry’s still pseudo-sobbing and Kreacher looks like he’s considering something, like he’s unsure of whether or not to move.  Finally, after swearing Harry to secrecy, Kreacher tells the story of Regulus Black and Slytherin’s Locket and Harry- Harry
- had backed him against a wall.  “Uncle Vernon-” Harry had said, uncertainly, and then Vernon twisted him, pushing his stomach against the wall and hefting his weight against Harry’s back, grinding his hardness against Harry, the sheaf of busty women clenched in his fist until he came in a burst of wetness.
After several hours, he finds it-
Harry tears away from Malfoy, gasping- shaking.  Shuddering with want and sickness in equal measure- he is
He stumbles over words for the first few days, even with the Language-Learning potion he brewed on the sly and takes everyday, but, as Saorise’s been limited to conversing with other, ‘boring’, snakes for months now, she’s happy to talk to him, for hours on end.
Parseltongue is fascinating, honestly, and he is disgusted by the negligence with which Potter treats it.  He barely even uses the gift.
Harry enters the Great Hall practically cloaked in Notice-Me-Not’s, head bent low and glasses stuffed in his pocket (he’s been taking a potion to correct his eyesight).

A brief glimpse of Potter’s face- stark, stricken, and then Potter’s drawing himself up and intoning “Malfoy” with cold, contemptuous, dignity.
“Oh, yeah, Tom Riddle.  Awful nice bloke, wasn’t he? Lovely career choices.”
The Dark Lord tilts his skull, red eye glinting.  Draco does not relax, does not bat an eye, does not move a muscle.
- Draco squeezes tighter, a hand playing with his nipples.
But the thought of Ron and Hermione- bright laughing faces (that quote from Jane Eyre
Harry imagines arterial spray, imagines bones breaking and Snape’s face, his impassive face, the gnarl of his brow and the sharp line of his mouth, twisting in pain.

Potions.  Without Severus, it doesn’t feel the same, and Draco feels a pang of nostalgia.  The damp, piceous, fug of the cauldron fumes, the vicious gleam of silver and the sweet mordant smell of herbs- they all conspire to create something of an atmosphere, all lengthening shadows and the fixed glow of an adroit eye.
He practices the footwork and wand movements against an invisible opponent (his bruises and aching muscles protesting all the way).  He closes his eyes, pictures Vernon standing fleshy and red, pictures breaking every bone in his body, pictures casting

something- anything.
“Oh?” Draco asks carefully.  There is an acid taste in his mouth; he sets his toast down, politely fixing his attention on Bella.  A great honor, that must mean-
The Dark Lord laughs and Draco has no doubt that he has seen through Draco’s flimsy excuses; a flash of fear locks his knees.
“I heard that Potter ran away from home this summer,” Pansy offers randomly, ostensibly as a means to cheer Draco up, and Draco sits up, interest piqued.
(Sometimes, Harry thinks he hates his father.  Pureblood, wealthy, loved, and such a fucking bully.  At least Sirius had the excuse of the taint of hatred and Darkness from Grimmauld Place; James was cosseted and coddled every inch of his existence as Harry was not.)
He pads to Sirius’s room, Aoife knowing better than to follow him, and sinks onto his bed.  He goes here so often that it’s stopped smelling like Sirius and started smelling like him, but that’s alright.  He never really knew what Sirius smelled like anyway.
“We are going to
, because how fucking stupid did he have to be- it was the Parseltongue, he knows, Circe, if he hadn’t had such ironclad control of himself he might have pressed Potter against the nearest surface when hearing him speak it, too.  But then the desire had faded and Potter had realized who, exactly, he was kissing, and the want in him had distilled into horror, plain and simple.
to work, to enjoy slavery.  He can’t imagine it, can’t imagine the joy that comes from thankless toil.  Maybe it’s like Quidditch, maybe it’s the bodily exertion and sweat, but he doesn’t think so, it’s something about being submissive, it’s- it’s like they’re

He knows Voldemort lived in an orphanage, once, in the middle of World War II and he knows, too, the peculiar kinship between them.
And that’s- it’s so fucking simple that he can’t help the slightly crazed laugh that spills from his lips.  “Sorry,” Harry gasps out, and then he’s swinging his Cloak gloriously up, gloriously free, over the narrow bracket of his shoulders, flipping the hood up over his head and darting up the stairs, Silencing his footsteps and Shrinking his trunk and running, out of Gryffindor Tower, running, running, running.
for, so many things he will-not-should-not-cannot care about. He wonders if his heart has grown smaller, icy in captivity, hardening and shrinking into a sharp compact thing.)
Parseltongue, besides the obvious factor of genetics, is like any other language, so there must be a book that explains it.
“I mean, Grimmauld might have an owl ward-”
Harry laughs.
Harry meanders off- he’d meant to show Aoife the Chamber, but that’s rather ruined now, so he slips into Gryffindor Tower.  Ron and Hermione are curled in the common room, talking in low voices, but they look up as he- clothed in the Cloak but they fucking know it’s him, of course they do - walks in.
Potter turns, the juncture of his neck and shoulder fluid and clean, something animalistic in the smooth cant of his movements.  A flash of green irises, a slice of a challenge, and then he’s leaping through the slide like he’s done this in his sleep, like it’s a matter of routine.  It probably is. Circe knows if Draco had access to the Chamber of Secrets, he would-
- and instead, he flips open the book.  The previous owner’d drawn all over it, and once Harry stops feeling irritated and starts actually reading the doodles, he realizes that they’re quite helpful, actually. He follows the instructions, mind fluttered somewhere far off, fingers moving in practiced mechanic, glancing down every so often to check the book- or, rather, the book’s vandaliser.
He isn’t bitter about it (although maybe he is, he can’t deny he wants to be able to love freely), he knows he must continue the Malfoy line, knows it is his duty to the hundreds of ancestors that have bled for him, the countless great-greats who have stifled their desires and gritted their teeth to continue the line, without which he would not have existed.
” Harry shrieks over and over again, “

In Harry’s grand plan to evade his friends, he did not factor one thing into his calculations: Quidditch. He’s Captain now, and that means he has to hold tryouts and he knows that Ron will be trying out and Hermione will be in the stands.
Harry shakes out the silvery cloth, light scatting showily across the stone bilge of the walls, flings it over the two of them- Malfoy’s warm breath in the moist enclosure of anonymity - and tugs Malfoy towards the bathroom.
There’s no way he can avoid being caught, not when it’s quite obvious where he is and the loose stone is literally inches away from his feet, so with a sigh, he sweeps the hood off of his cloak.
He’s late, as he predicted, and he sidles in as unobtrusively as he can be- or at least, he tries to.  Hermione’s in the middle of answering a question, her eyes lit with fervor, but when Slughorn catches sight of him- well.  Harry’s heart sinks.

P.S. So, this fic started out as a "Draco-Centric" fic, featuring Draco and only Draco as the main star, but I soon realized that with Harry, we have a framework of events and shit, what with the Slug Club and Dumbledore's lessons and Quidditch and the H-BP and with Draco, it'd basically just be: "Draco.... still hasn't finished his tasks yet.  He's delaying!  Delaying!  Delaying!  Because he doesn't want to let a bunch of homicidal maniacs run loose in a castle full of children!"  Which is... boring. So, it's now more Harry-centric.  Sorry!
“My Lord?” Draco says just as softly in return, voice questioning and respectful and son-like.
She’d probably wet herself in excitement.

Harry twitches a hand, a wave of panicked magic displacing the cold, still, air and carrying him up the slick walls, through the channel and propelling him to the gloss-grimed tiles bordering the Chamber’s womb.  It feels like a rebirth, the action of it.
“Most… thoughtful of you, Draco.” Voldemort whispers softly, resting his skull on a single white palm. The sibilant sound of voice sends shivers through Draco; he sets his feet slightly further apart, bracing his weight more steadily.
Words that would be believable if spoken in the Manor, or by Blaise of Pansy or Daphne or Theo, but out of
Well.  Mostly empty.  Luna’s there, curled up with her copy of the Quibbler (she’s reading it sideways, which Harry finds rather droll), and although the thought of being with the cheerful, beaming, faces of his fellow Gryffindors makes him want to curl up like a slug presented with salt, he finds he doesn’t mind Luna.  Here, another child of perpetual loneliness.
The Dark Lord eyes him, amused.  Draco is disgusted at his serpentine features, at this mockery of a man who has torn his entire being, scratched and scraped at his humanity until it ran dry, carved himself into a monster with corpse-colored skin and blood-colored eyes and gaunt, stick-thin, limbs, but he’s been Occluding since he could speak French and he knows that not a trace of it shows on his face.
Oh, how they would treat him, if they knew.

Potter’s grinning, high flags of colour in his cheeks, green eyes bright. They’re- he’s slipped off his glasses, Draco realizes, and without them he looks impossibly beautiful, a bright burning pillar of glass and wild curls and violent colour. Something in Potter quickens at danger, something in him is only alive on the brink of death.  Draco’s breath catches in his throat- he’s still on his knees; it’s strangely fitting - and he feels a deep, hollowing, ache inside him, that terribly human lust for beauty.

When the Dark Lord comes, all white-snow skin and red, red, eyes, cold long fingers and thin, translucent, skin, Draco doesn’t notice.  He’s in his bed, shivering and curling in on himself, fingers pressing against the bruise at his hipbone, heavy-purple and mottled, the bruise his father had left with the head of his cane scarcely an hour ago,
Draco thinks about how he’d once extended a hand to Potter, the Heir of an Ancient and Noble House, a tentative alliance in the curve of his fingers, the chink of his elbow.  Malfoys and Potters weren’t allies in the past war, but their history extended farther than that, roots trawling deep beneath soil and tangling together more often than not.
“What I mean to say,” Harry says, calmer, “Is that it’s going to be an uphill fight.  You’re not satisfied.  I’m not satisfied.  And that’s fine.  We’re going to take that dissatisfaction and we’re going to use it to propel us; we’re going to beat ourselves to the pulp and build ourselves up.  And we’re going to win the Cup.” He adds as an afterthought.

The light is damp and cool and barely there when he pops into existence.  A batty thing, the disgraced filthy Black called him once, many times, a barmy elf, mad-as-a-hatter- Kreacher doesn’t know why a hatter would be mad.
Yes, he knows.  She used to seek him out. When the cloying embrace of suburbia was too much for her, when she’d had enough of the narrowed eyes and cat-like hisses of her bony sister, she used to knock at his door and together they would escape like two lost children, two runaways, sheltering in the dwelling green glow of glen and fen and woodland, skipping stones and wishing on clouds because the stars were fogged by the thick smog of humanity’s exhaust.
(It’s a good thing, actually- Harry has some blood magic he needs to start on.)
Afterwards, Rodolphus Lestrange tells him what he has to do.  There is a Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burke’s that corresponds to one in Hogwarts.  He needs to repair the one in Hogwarts.
Now, the rush of the crowd in the stands is overwhelming, the

The walls and locks and wards made of blood and love are nothing to Kreacher, they are as ephemeral as a wisp of peach-scented breeze on a summer’s day.  Kreacher ghosts past them with the ease of the long-departed and smiles with the vicious light of mad things.  (The disgraced son was not entirely wrong about some things, if not others.)
All he knows is tearing out of the house with his messily-crammed trunk and wand and Hedwig released to the skies (she’ll find him, she always does), all he remembers is running as fast, as hard as he can.
Draco slides those long, pale, fingers under Harry’s shirt, freeing it from his pants and then his fingertips are sliding along the iliac grooves abridging Harry’s pelvis and it’s so much, it’s
There’s a speech, and the Sorting, and Harry plays a wizarding version of noughts and crosses with Luna, erasing the evidence with a wave of his hand when the plates appear, food-laden and steaming, in front of them.  Harry selects a velvety pumpkin soup and digs in.

He’d bitten his lip so hard he’d drawn blood, desperation shining in his eyes until Pansy wacked him again and murmured a quick healing charm for his lip, a soft hand on his arm reminding him.
He works them to the bone; past that, to the marrow, until not even Ginny has the energy to approach him, until their minds are collectively empty and utterly displaced of anything but the implacable need for warm water and sleep and food.
Harry completes the Ancient Runes worksheet easily- there’s a few he doesn’t recognize, because he’s learnt the Dark and intensely practical runes for his blood-work and the nuances of practitioner and student do not always collimate successfully, but he’s fairly certain that he’ll be accepted into at least the fifth year class- actually, he hopes he will, because Luna will be there and Hermione won’t be.

That can’t be…
Harry had thought, already picturing the disgust on everyone’s faces.  He’d carved runes into his skin of purity and defense with a silver needle, but the needle had been stolen from Aunt Petunia’s sewing basket and didn’t work (the scars were still there, though; thin white lines on his forearms, so faint that people never noticed) and he was a fucking
Looking terribly relieved, Potter all but sprints for the door, hurtling past the wan-faced girl and for the shrewd-eyed cloister of the McGonagall’s office.
Draco has been given a terrible task- tasks - and his entire torso has been cursed and his schedule has been thoroughly avulsed of everything that made it worthwhile in the first place, but he is goddamn happy and going to stay that way, at least for a few hours.
“Hermione,” Harry tries, but she’s already pacing left-right-left furiously, and the familiar round-dobbed doorknob is blooming gold.
Such an acknowledgement of the world’s cruelty, such blind and brash trust in the imperviousness of the seventh-floor corridor, anyone could have come upon him, did he see, did he care?
“Saorise,” he murmurs (someday, soon, he’ll be able to wake her in
“Soon, I might be able to understand you,” Draco whispers to Saorise, smiling as she winds around his forearm, tongue flickering.
It stings, a low burning hum, but he is no stranger to pain.  (Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Lucius- long pale hair and a faint smile.)
, surging, butting against his lips, wanting to break free - and he needs- this needs to be handled.  He doesn’t have time for these glorified stalkers.
Snape is snarling something about detention at 8 tonight to make up for what he’ll miss and there’s Vernon in the hateful gyre of his fists, Petunia in the spitefully spat insults and Harry is fleeing, fleeing, fleeing, his tie loose around his neck and his schoolbag clenched so tight in his whitening fist it

Harry ducks his head, slings his bag over his shoulder, and disperses in the vivid blackness of five o’clock, Scotland.
“Looks like the little lamb has left the fold,” Blaise croons, something sharp and predatory glittering in the sclera of his eye; when Draco blinks, he sees phosphenes glittering and blooming on the edges of his vision.  “Blaise.” Draco grits out, closing his eyes, “Please stop that.”
how bad things were,
Voldemort tilts his head, lipless mouth curving into a smirk.  “You will also be entrusted with the task of bringing my loyal Death Eaters into Hogwarts.  Rodolphus will inform you of the specifics.”
When he is not researching murder tactics, he is studying Parseltongue.
“There’s,” Harry gasps out, “Something, something in the corridor, you have to-”
Dumbledore and facing Hermione, Ron.  Hermione would understand, he thinks- she’s smart like that, she puts together facts and ideas, sliding them together with nary a thought, logic whirring in the cogs of her mind like some infernal engine-  but Ron and his family are loyal to Dumbledore to the last.
Harry laughs and laughs and
Still, he can tell that she’s excited about it, that she knows what he’s doing.  He wonders just how much she knows, how much she can converse, and feels a thrum of anticipation deep in his belly, his muscles relaxing for the first time in days-

With Potter’s nearness and the silvery shimmer of the Cloak, obfuscating Draco’s gaze at every turn, the words take a few moments to register.
He shrinks them and stows them in his pocket, excitement fizzing in his veins.
“Yes, Potter, your OWLS.” McGonagall repeats, impatient but not unkind. A strand of hair, graying, slips from her tight bun.  She slides a sheet of paper over to him.

Aoife hisses suddenly, and Hermione and Ron recoil.
Potter’s loosely disheveled, cheeks flushed and panting.  He runs- aimlessly, Draco thinks, seeking higher ground like a cliff swallow.  They’re on the seventh floor, Potter makes an aborted movement that may have been the start of something, and then he slides, back scraping against the wall.
“Sir.” Harry nods.  “McGonagall explained about your situation- we have several old Potions textbooks in the cabinet right over there, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find the necessary equipment!”

Harry loves Hogwarts in all of her forms- in the morning, the fat beams of sunlight struggling through the windows, bleary eyes and rashers of bacon and thickly cut toast; in the afternoon with all the damp mugginess of a hundred or so teenagers and little to no temperature regulation; at dinner with the light cool and dark Ravenclaw blue, but in all honesty, he loves night best.

(It’s particularly ingenious, actually- he’s keyed the runes to them, while managing to exclude himself, through the advent of scrawling the runes in his own blood.  Hermione herself wouldn’t be able to undo it, and she’s the one who takes Ancient Runes.)
Blaise blinks, looking sheepish, and when Draco opens his eyes, his vision has returned to normal again.  “Sorry, my magical inheritance came this summer, it’s gotten a bit harder to control.”
He doesn’t pay any attention to Slughorn’s droning- he hates Snape, but at least the man had
“Harry,” Hermione says, eyes enormous, “Is that a snake?”
Malfoy pauses, eyes flitting over Harry, stroking over the wild tufts of hair and the Gryffindor tie knotted securely at the base of his throat.  His eyes are a weight, heavy in the draughty, whispering, echoes of the Chamber, grout stained bromide and flaking with age.  He’s staring at Harry so completely, so utterly, absorbing the hollows and hallows of him, taking his measure.  No one’s looked at him with such intent before, no one’s-

It is in Kreacher’s bird-like bones and his green-ink blood, the walls and breathing portraits inhale when Kreacher sucks in a breath, exhale when Kreacher’s heart beats a rapid tattoo against his wrinkled thin skin.
Harry is going to vomit, he’s going to-
“Go,” He chokes out, and how mad must he look, fingers scrabbling uselessly at his sides, eyes green and glazed with what, terror? He can’t decide what is more important, he can’t help but want privacy, want succor, want arms around him and yet all at once, loss.

They’re crossing staircases, down down down, and Harry feels a prickle on the leaf-line of his spine.  Someone- he whirls around, sees a second-year girl, the same wan-faced one that’d carried the note from McGonagall’s office.  Their gazes connect, and she stiffens, hands curling tightly by her sides.  The paper crinkles in her fist.

When he is trembling all over, muscles exhausted and quivering, he fills two sheaves of parchment with Dark curses that he should know.  He doesn’t even know what for, but he knows that he will not be that helpless again.
Draco smirks.
His gaze catches on Ron.  The sweet coppery shine of his orange hair, so bright in the shy shafts of morning light.  The hardened set of his mouth.  He would get on the team or die trying, Harry knows, because right now this isn’t just about Quidditch, it’s about them.  Ron and Hermione don’t know what the matter was, don’t know why Harry can’t talk to them like normal- because he isn’t normal, he

McGonagall slips a hand in her robes and in her hand is a glinting red-and-gold trinket, he can’t quite see it in the mellow brightness of the September sunlight.  She presents it to him, arched placidly over the dry caldera of her palm like some sort of bastion.
She does, her yellow body slithering over to him and curling around him in loose, heavy, coils, and Harry isn’t sure if he’s sobbing or not.  He could be.

Remembering those dulled eyes (call him naive but he’d seen those eyes as a sort of Promethean Fire, indomitable and forever lit), the cadaverous pale of his skin, the terribly visible tremble of his hands where they curled by his sides- it sends shivers through him still.
The second-year girl nods.  She’s not meeting his eyes, looking directly and resolutely at the stones; Harry feels a spurt of vague pity.  “What’s your name?” Harry asks, biting his lip, and her gaze darts up, looking astonished.
Harry knows better than he can articulate, better than Dumbledore could imagine, what it is like to be called by a name that no longer applies to you, that was given to you in a terrible place and used by people you despise. His body still jumps whenever he hears the word ‘freak’, sometimes when he hears the word ‘boy’.

Let's take a moment to talk about Harry's skills.  So, as we can see, he has indeed ventured into the ~Dark Arts~ as a method of self-defense, given that the ~Light~ shit is just not cutting it.  (Draco is actually wrong to say that Harry doesn't know Parselmagic- the thing is that Harry does know it, and is indeed practiced in it, given that Parselmagic doesn't have as much need for a wand b/c it's inherently more powerful, but he doesn't use it or have a snake familiar because he doesn't want to freak out his utterly Gryffindorish 'Light' friends.) Also, boy's putting up some kinda powerful blood wards.  Needless to say, this ain't your regular mediocre Harry.  He does still get average good-ish grades, but this is for one reason and one reason only: Aunt Petunia used to scream at him for getting better marks than Dudley.  It's common practice for him to learn and study very hard, consuming all the material and mastering the subject (because, as he knows, knowledge is needed to survive and he never knows when he'll be in danger), and then, when it comes time to present all his mastery , he just.... doesn't.
(The answer: bloodshed.  Collateral damage; meaningless in the long run but unavoidable.)
“Go on, then.” McGonagall sighs.  “See me after Professor Babbling evaluates your Ancient Runes work, I’ll write you a pass for Professor Snape- in the meantime, I’ll put you in for a free period around that time- I suppose you’ll be taking Transfiguration, Herbology, Defense, and Potions?”

There is something he hasn’t felt in months and doesn’t care to identify at the moment running in him, a reckless Gryffindor’s veins; Harry blows Malfoy a kiss.
Light Magic doesn’t fix a thing.
He can’t help thinking what Granger would think if she saw his trunk- he doesn’t sleep in the bed at Hogwarts, he sleeps in his trunk, with its large, soft, sheets and the space and the small pond with darting fish.  In it are crammed dozens and dozens of books; highly theoretical Potions texts and ancient Dark tomes (warded and glamoured with the most effective spells he knows), first-editions and signed copies.
The nightmares don’t stop, after that.  He wonders if they- maybe - maybe it’s like his scars, they never go away.

He moves blindly through the castle that’s been the closest possible thing a lost orphan can call home for years, and Hogwarts herself moves with him, corridors volte-facing and bending the currents of reality for him, stone melting and ossifying in dizzying peristalsis, the thrum of Her magic thudding as he swallows, pulse fluttering like a crushed bird’s wings under the thin skin of his throat.  Cloaking darkness, a mothering alcove that Hogwarts pushes him gently towards- it’s what he needs; cramped darkness has always been inexplicably comforting for him.

A smile tucked in the darkness; teeth obscured by the fold of a cloak, the angle of a chin.
Kreacher, who seems to be warring with his dislike for Harry and his approval at Harry’s actions, nods again and promises to ward the house against any visitors.

Potter drops his gaze afterwards and doesn’t meet it for the rest of supper no matter how long Draco watches him.

He lets go of his trunk and walks up the stairs, opening the first available room and curling up in the bed, letting the darkness at the edges of his vision eclipse the light.
Finally, it’s the night he marked for the ritual, and Draco cannot wait.  He eats his dinner as fast as is polite, forcing himself to walk to his room in a leisurely manner, forces himself to wait until midnight, when no one walks the grounds but the peacocks (they hate him and he hates them; they have a mutual agreement to keep their distance).

Harry had scrambled away as soon as he relented, face crimson and nausea swirling in him, banging his knees several times on the way to the toilet (he’d vomited for what felt like hours, coughing up bile and stomach acid, the feeling of Vernon’s sweat smearing on his skin), disbelief and shock and horror and mortification tight in his chest.

She identifies half a dozen poisonous plants in the space of a few seconds and arranges them from least poisonous to most deadly in a flash; her fingers are precise and careful as they draw venom from a Stunned taipan.  She murmurs tales to him of poisoning and espionage as she tips a few drops in a cup of tea, shows him how to stir quickly, quietly, wandlessly.
He casts several layers of Notice-Me-Not charms on her scales until he is satisfied.
There’s pain hitching in his throat and he wants to cry but he can’t.  He’s shaking, a bone-deep sort of shaking that runs through every rivulet of blood in his veins, and he bites down on his lip, hard, ignoring the part of him that whispers

He sets the ritual, the athame, pentagon, chalice, wand, in their allocated positions.  He breathes deeply, takes his wand, purifies the air, and casts a ritual circle, walking clockwise.  It shines brightly in the shifting shadows.

Hermione seizes the doorknob, twists it with shocking savagery, and wrenches the door open, marching with short, sharp, snapping, steps- and slowing, pausing, forehead creasing in confusion.
“Er.  Shit.” Harry says, uselessly. What.  What can he possibly say?  All at once, the moonshine Luna-gleam of the night, arrayed prettily ‘round the fat stones of the castle, falls away in glittering, twisted, shards; it is just him and his two best friends, who he hasn’t spoken to in a month, staring at each other in the wild, chillingly beautiful, Scottish night.  Six feet away, and it feels like an insurmountable chasm already.

Afterwards, Narcissa smiles at him. Her lips move against his hair, murmuring something sacred, and she withdraws, a pale hand lingering on his shoulder.  “Make me proud, Draco.”
It’s August 31st and for the first time in years, Harry isn’t looking forward to Hogwarts.
And, and, and, arguing with Harry Potter is such a natural thing to do, so comforting he falls back on it in times of need.  Cruel letter from Lucius? Hippogriff injury?  Slytherin politics mis-maneuver? Antagonize Potter.

“Now, onto the next matter,  I have a task for you, Draco.”  Voldemort smiles, his red eyes very bright.  Draco wants to run and hide, wants to crawl into the safety of his mind behind his impenetrable walls.  He can’t.

They’re practicing nonverbal Transfigurations at the moment, and Harry nods along vaguely to whatever she’s saying, his quill moving in empirical execution on the thick cream-colored reams of his parchment.

He hands the letters to Ulysses, watching as his owl carries them away, and feels lighter than he has in days.

until his eyes water and his knees ache.
He hears soft laughter and glances sideways; Malfoy is laughing, a hand pressed to his pink mouth.
“My OWLS?” Harry repeats, dumbly.  The OWLS have completed slipped his mind.  It’s hard, sometimes, to get into the schoolwork and tests and the warm fug of Hogwarts after a summer of hurt and fists and fight-or-flight.  He’d just picked up the things that the other students had picked up, he hadn’t even

Kreacher smiles at him, lips skinning over sharp, grimy, teeth.  The Muggle screams and blathers about freakish things and Kreacher wastes no time.
“Yes,” says Potter, like he’s guessed at Draco’s thoughts.  “That does mean exactly what you think it does.”
I must ask you again, quite strongly, to please write back and allow me to escort you home.  Are you at Grimmauld Place?  We do need it for Order headquarters, I’m afraid.  Or is it that rather rude house-elf, Kreacher, who is blocking the wards?  Do forgive me, I sometimes tend to think out loud.  Now, onto the matter at hand: we need you to return.  Britain needs you to remain safe, Harry.

It’s over, gone, in a flash, Malfoy standing smoothly without the need for Harry’s hand, but there’s a lingering of something indiscernible and swift in the gray shadows of his irises.

But Vernon Dursley takes it away at Platform 9 and 3/4 every summer, ever since his one and only attempt last year, when he’d transfigured a random stick into a wand and slipped his real wand into his waistband.

Blaise is grinning, teeth looking white and disturbingly sharp against the warmth of his skin, and Draco is reminded for the first time in years that this is the son of the woman who’d lured, married, and slayed seven men without a flicker of remorse, without ever being arrested or even detained for questioning.

Harry’s first instinct is to turn him down, but then he remembers Dumbledore’s half-moon’s and loopy penmanship and he smiles, bright.
No, by a combination of a loveless childhood and a early insertion into the stark, unforgiving, field of war, Harry is totally different from James- fundamentally, irredeemably.  He thinks of Sirius, who’d perhaps expected another James or something close to him and who had landed himself with Harry- quieter, grimmer, used to the rigors of vitriol and the meaty swing of a fist, used to the serpentine cock of a pale head and the ruby angles of two eyes, unchangeable.
“You did.” Harry confirms, and Malfoy smiles like he’s delighted but Harry can see the strain in his shoulders, the care in the way he carries himself, like if he makes one wrong move he’ll break, like he is made up of a thousand shards of porcelain haphazardly assembled, and an errant wind is enough to shatter him.
Aoife hisses, sounding bored.

Severus.  Severus will never change, Draco knows, and Severus loves him with every ounce of love he is capable of, which is not a terribly large amount.  Most of it is so bound up in grief and denial and terrible, terrible, hatred, so deep it rocks the very core of him and hardens the shell of him until to outsiders he is a bitter, spiteful, man.
“Fear not, the curse is restricted to his torso,” Voldemort continues, his red gaze clinical and curious.  “You are in no danger of discovery.”

He can’t tell if his dreams are nightmares or not; they all revolve around snakes and flickering tongues and pain; red eyes warring against the greenest eyes he’s ever seen.
It’s such a stark contrast to their previous interactions- teetering a knife’s edge between teasing flirtatiousness and buried sincerity  -  that Draco gapes for all of one second before composing himself- exacting architecture, the cold, clean, lines of his face in unflappable repose.  He is Narcissa Black Malfoy’s son, after all.
He buries his face in his hands, eyes blank, and Draco feels like he’s intruding on something desperately private.  Draco moves to leave, but the rasping husk of his shoes against the stones draws Potter’s eye to him like moth to flame.

Potter is bent over his book, his hair ridiculously amuck, and in the droughty light of the dungeons, he glows.
And.  Lord.  He’s spoken with snakes of all kinds, chatted with Saorise, hissed back and forth with a snarky adder, and all of it hasn’t prepared him for hearing Parseltongue fall from Potter’s lips with unspeakable eloquence, susurrating up Draco’s

And now, Kreacher knows he is right.  Master Harry, with his viridian eyes and messy Potter hair, has been Black all along.  He watches Master Harry devour books on Dark Magic, Darker and Darker and Darkest, venturing further and further into the Blackest corners of the Black library.  He watches Master Harry practice curses so foul that Mistress Walburga would cry in happiness, watches the portraits appraise Master Harry with prying laconic eyes.
The portraits, the living-breathing-beating Black treasures, and when Master Harry reconnects them in a way not even Kreacher can, in a way that only a Black can, absentmindedly correcting the flow of energy and repairing the terrible, gaping, damage that the filthy disgrace and that mongrel Mundungus Fletcher have wrought on this Ancient and Novel House, Kreacher- and the portraits lining the walls, the heads of his ancestors plaqued on the lily-gilded embossed wallpaper - knows that Master Harry is truly a Black, truly the Lord of their Most Ancient And Noble House.

The skid of a boot on stone, the press of skin on skin-
There is blood dripping down his face and blood pooling in his arse from Vernon shoving in but Vernon doesn’t care why would he-
, like tomorrow or the day after that at the latest, or else I’m going to have to murder Fleur Delacour.  Yes, she’s here too, and yes, she’s very worried as well. There, take that, you foolish masculine prig, and hustle back over to the Burrow for some blissful cheek-kisses,

Curiously enough, he doesn’t mind Malfoy using it, especially given that he’s apparently a Parselmouth via a ritual, but the Chamber was the one place he could be completely and totally alone, surrounded by achingly heavy wards and crackling magic.

and he wants to get away, he almost turns back and runs outside, to the cool damp kiss of the rain, but Luna places a gentle hand on his arm and murmurs a spell, and the roar recedes to a reasonable amount.  Harry smiles at her, relieved.

Most of the curses he can’t attempt with wandless magic, but he notes them down and memorizes the wand movements, the incantations, until he’s fairly certain he could get it in the first few tries.
“Okay.” Draco says, faintly.  “Right.” The Dark Lord was once called ‘Tom’, Potter slayed a basilisk with Gryffindor’s Sword while Voldemort played cheerleader in the background, and Potter is apparently familiar with the Dark Arts.  He’s already had a few shocks to the system; what’s one more?
She loves him so, so, much; he wonders what he ever did to deserve it.
“Hmmm.” Draco says, faintly, which is, quite frankly, an accomplishment.
Harry bends his head, chin pressing into his sternum, hurrying hurrying hurrying, anything to get out of this dark corridor that looks like unraveling thread and paths that lead further into the dark, not the light.  There’s something there’s something there’s something-
The days- pass. Somehow.  He goes to classes, tries to deal with the encroaching tide of unfamiliar, alien, memories, avoids the dark and RonandHermione, and works tirelessly during Quidditch practice, until he’s- they’re all - nothing but a skin of flesh and sweat and slender bones knocking about, nothing but a hollow scooped out.  (He wonders when he will learn to be anything but concave.)
Draco swallows down a bubble of laughter and arches a delicate brow.
He smooths his hair, flattening it with a few muttered charms until it’s sleek and coiffed, checks his Occlumency barriers, examines his reflection in the mirror for any imperfections. There are deep bruises under his eyes; he charms them away with half a thought.  Granger may surpass him in the theoretical department (he generally can’t be bothered to write twice the required length for extra credit), he’s excellent at the practical department; he is a Malfoy, after all.  Precision,
and they do, magic urging slack, uncooperative, limbs into seaweed motion, tendrils and front and idle pale forearms.  This is the unrest, he thinks; this is not- correct.  Accurate.  What could he have done?  They would not leave, but they are now gone, where does the line cross, where do we draw it, on the sand?  His thoughts undulate, they come in tides and moon-crests, he’s a sunken pool of forgetting on the colorfully matted floor.
Runaway, he thinks, Lily were you ever did you ever-

Hedwig hoots again, softly, and Harry snaps his head up.  Vernon, he has time to think, Vernon will come in if she hoots again-
A monster reaches out with one languid, white, hand, spidery and thin and unspeakably austere, and Draco does not move a muscle.
“But your caution is misplaced.  You will take the Mark without my magic; you have not yet earned it.”

“The Dark Arts,” Snape begins, his voice sharp and swarthy and alive in a way Harry’s never heard before-
Draco bows.  “My Lord.”
And then there is nothing but the overwhelming urge for them to
After twenty minutes of this, the point of his quill snaps off.
.  Voldemort’s eyes are Gryffindor red and his are the color of serpents and slyness; when they meet there is always pain.)
The Chamber is dark, the weight of damp air pressing into Harry, palpable, goosing his arms up and down, and he wants desperately to curl into a lost corner somewhere but Draco’s still here and he doesn’t want to have to- explain.
“Well, Mr. Potter?” Professor McGonagall says, impatient, and Harry reaches out a hand that he’d like to pretend is not trembling as it undeniably is, and snatches it up, quick as a mouse.  “Thank you,” Harry breathes out, grateful because he can only imagine how irritated she must have been when he’d run away like a bloody coward and secluded himself-
warming Harry’s chest, making him want to run a finger on the glassy edge of Malfoy’s inner lip.
It’s disgusting.  He can’t- Hogwarts is his home for nine months of the year, and now he is tasked with bringing murder and torture to its bright secrets and serpentine, twisting, hallways.
Kreacher Apparates them back to Grimmauld (she apparently enjoys the sensation), and Harry curls up in his bed with her, telling her as best he can why he is in danger, what he needs, what his life looks like, who she can and cannot bite.  She is outraged when she hears about Vernon, hissing
The fat lump of Muggle scum is sitting on an equally lumpy couch of little to no taste (what can you expect, Kreacher, Walburga purrs low and sweet in his skull, they’re Muggles, after all).
Later, Harry doesn’t remember anything.  There is only the breaking, the shattering, the sense of utter loss; there is only the violent fury and virulent wrath.  All of his broken, jagged, edges, smashed and ground and burnt by the weight that is Vernon Dursley, every sharp edge pulverizing the other, grinding and grinding in time to Vernon's thrusts, whittling him down and prying him apart with clammy hands and cloying claws (everything smells like peaches) until he's not even broken he's not even dust he's not even human he's not even-
Oh god oh god oh god, darkness blooms again but
p.s. sorry for the jesus-christ-is-it-really-that-fucking-long Note in the beginning.  As I've said, I... I don't handle temptation well.  And his psychological issues needed explaining.
The next day dawns summer-bright and early, and Harry Apparates (he’d enlisted Kreacher to teach him Apparition and it’s one of the best decisions he’s ever made- house elves can Apparate
Harry wakes the next day in sleep-creased robes, his hair a wild mess, his tongue thick and tender.  His head feels strange, thin-scalped, as if at any moment the hard bone of his skull will succumb with barely a sigh, exposing the soft mollusk of Harry’s brain to cruel knives and malice.  He thinks, momentarily, of Draco, all hollowed (hallowed) cheeks and eyes that glint a weary, glowing, gray, but it’s a flicker of a thought, a slip of an instant.  Gone.

There’s a pause as they both take in that statement and then Potter’s laughing, a fist pressed to his mouth, chuckles bubbling up.  “You can see
Narcissa, on the other hand, is the epitome of a Lady of an Ancient and Noble House, of a Slytherin.  She is beautiful, all dark Black eyes and soft pale hair.  Icy when confronted with enemies, warm with him (not lately, but he remembers it still; how intently she would listen as he babbled about his day, how she taught him to be strong enough to withstand the weight of the world, the softness of her hands as she smoothed his hair, the letters she wrote him- writes him - her elegant quillwork taking up five pages, at least).
Harry announces him as Keeper.  “Congratulations.” Harry says, quietly, when Ron approaches him, and then he’s snarling
