Harry was torn from his musings with a start, and when he looked up, he found Nic once again observing him with that same little smile, eyebrows raised just high enough to make Harry’s cheeks hot from embarrassment.
that.”
know all about that.”
Thankfully, Draco nodded, giving a small, if strained, smile of his own. “Fine. But, in my defence, you seemed to be doing perfectly well by yourself. Not that I’m surprised; brute force is all you Gryffindors are good for. That, and reckless shenanigans like
It had been in those types of days that Draco had found true happiness, when schoolwork and popularity were the biggest of his worries—happiness the likes of which he hadn’t been able to find before or since.
Draco clenched and unclenched his fists. He really should just get it over with. Walk through those doors and listen to what Robards had to say, then work with that. After all, he could still protect Harry even if Robards took him off the case. Just because he wasn’t assigned to the Gryffindor anymore didn’t mean he actually had to remove himself from his soulmate’s life again.
“Probably,” Draco said, but he was smiling.
himself for it.
His heartbeat returned back to normal again and he said, tone neutral, “Potter, if you want details about a healthy, perfect soulmate relationship, then go ask Granger and Weasley. I’m sure they’d be more than glad to help. You’re correct to assume I’ve found my soulmate. But we…didn’t work out. Our paths separated a long time ago.” He gave a dark laugh. “Trust me, she certainly wants nothing from me.”
They materialised on the sidewalk outside, only to be immediately drenched by bullet-like raindrops pelleting down from the dark sky above. Within, seconds Draco found himself soaked from head to toe, dragonhide boots and hairstyle included (admittedly, the latter had been ruined hours ago, after he may or may not have suffered a nervous breakdown of sorts, but
“Okay then,” Harry said dazedly. "Remind me again what I'm doing in a hospital?"
the one who decided to condemn a stranger because of prejudice—"
, Harry couldn’t shake the feeling he was moving too slow, that he was missing something. Or rather, missing out.
Draco pursed his lips. But he didn’t stop speaking, refused to give up. Fuck, he still had a
Still nothing. Draco’s chest tightened, and sudden unease coursed through him. Perhaps he was the slightest bit paranoid after yesterday’s incident, but he had every reason to be. And since Blaise had assured him Harry was back at his flat, that Granger and Weasley had talked sense into him and made him go home, the silence unsettled him more than it perhaps should have. For there was no one there.
A gruff voice sounded from beside Potter, rudely yanking Draco from his wonder. “I liked the work, but in the end being an Auror was just more satisfying.” It was the slightly shorter of the two men that spoke—Jennings, likely—but he mustered Draco with a bit less hostility and added, “I apprenticed under Joachim Heind. Know the name?”
Harry chuckled, and an ebony lock of hair fell into his eyes, and not for the first time or the last, Draco strongly suspected, he was hit with the overwhelming urge to brush it away. To twirl it around his finger and then tuck it behind Harry’s ear. To cup his jaw. And maybe, just maybe…
At that, Draco made a noise halfway between a snort and a sigh, somehow simultaneously derisive and exasperated. Harry’s gaze focused on the blond, whose glower, he found, had very decidedly not lessened—on the contrary. Harry winced; Draco only looked
And then Draco chuckled. “Yes, I imagine it does. Sorry for that, by the way.”
But Philomena only narrowed her eyes further and snapped before the mountain of a man could finish, “No. Out. I may have received the letter your Head Auror sent, but I never once implied I had agreed to his requests. My customers enjoy unconditional anonymity, and I will not sacrifice that just because a bunch of self-important Aurors wish for me to lighten their workload.”
He quickly averted his gaze and took one hasty step backwards, letting Draco’s hand drop as though it were a burning piece of coal. “I, err…you…uhm. So. The baking. Why were you…?”
When Pansy reached their table, she rolled her eyes at Draco. “Oh, relax, lover boy, your Harry’s coming.” Then a smirk replaced her frown, and her eyes glinted dangerously as she said, “It’ll be worth the wait, trust me.”
But before he could utter a single word, a sudden bright, blinding light appeared in between them.
They passed Hayes, and Draco refused to so much as glance at the man, his shoulders tensing up despite himself, gaze trained doggedly ahead.
“Gentlemen, please,” Blaise said, holding up his hands. “This is a
…but if he just knocked once to make sure Draco was indeed planning on coming back out tonight, that wouldn’t hurt anyone, right?
for him. He’d figured as much, judging by everything he’d heard so far from Pansy and Blaise, but to have actual confirmation from the woman who had raised Draco—Harry would be gloating right now if there weren’t much more pressing matters to be dealt with first.
Harry smiled at him, a small, sad, but grateful smile, and Draco’s anger evaporated into nothingness.
He remembered his disastrous date with Nic; he remembered Yaxley escaping; he remembered Draco coming to get him; he remembered them kissing for what’d felt like hours; he remembered when he’d accidently called Draco his boyfriend and he remembered when they’d officially started dating; he remembered Hermione and Ron coming over and he remembered how supportive they’d been. And then the next day, Draco had gone to the Ministry to talk to Robards, and then…
Nic, of course, noticed immediately when Harry tried to move, and he stepped forward, pinning Harry’s right arm to the ground underneath the sole of his boot.
Draco watched as the stranger—a hooded figure whose face Draco couldn’t see, whether due to the dreary dark of Renaults and Co. or an especially clever Disillusionment Charm he couldn’t say—stepped out from behind him, taking the sharp tip of their wand with them.
That’s the one and only thing he could say with absolute certainty as he stood there in front of the cherry wood door leading to Robards’ office, fist lifted and ready to knock—just as it had been for the last thirty seconds.
But then the shock and the hurt disappeared, and in its wake, fury flooded Harry’s eyes.
“Except Yaxley’s dead,” Pansy said.
Draco didn’t let his surprise show, instead simply nodding once. He waited until Granger and Weasley had traversed the room, pointedly ignoring the glower the latter shot him in passing. Then the door closed behind him and silence fell, and Draco found himself suddenly very alone with Potter.
Instead of replying, though, he lifted his free hand to Harry’s face, hovering there for a moment before trailing down the side of his face, his cheek, his jaw, nothing but a whisper of a touch. It stayed there, and Harry leaned into the touch, all the while never breaking eye contact with the Slytherin.
I did briefly wonder whether this was too sappy, but then I figured these two idiots deserve it after all the shit they've been through (and will continue to be :)).
Harry very nearly choked on air, and he could feel Draco’s entire body tense beside him, unadulterated anger thrumming through the air as a heavy, heavy silence encompassed the hallway.
“What the—” exclaimed Harry as he was forcefully removed from the table. He tried to yank his arm free, but to no avail. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, you bloody psychopath?!”
the things we do for love—and Harry had just started gushing to Draco about how bloody brilliant his new broom was (a Fireball Three Sixty, a brand-new model by the same company that first created the Firebolt, a broom Draco had had his own eye on for quite some time now) when the inevitable happened and their bubble of cheery bliss was maliciously popped.
“Right then,” Harry said, hoping his tone was light. This situation sure as hell needed it. “So, Nic, you said you wanted to explain yourself?”
Slowly, he took one step into the office, wand lifted and a ‘Stupefy’ already on the tip of his tongue. One step, then another, each more cautious than the last.

fine. Really. You two go and help Mrs. Weasley.” He turned to the Healers. “And I really would appreciate some time to rest.”
“Not that I’m not enjoying our little talk,” Draco said, “but I’d best be off. Places to be, people to see, and all that nonsense.” He stood again, and this time, the spots only briefly speckled his vision, so he counted it as a full win.
And the fact that he could ever,
Especially when she said, “You know, Draco, I don’t think you are as much of a git as you might like people to think.”
?” he gasped, gaze disbelieving. “I thought…I always thought—” He stopped speaking abruptly and went red, looking away embarrassedly.
“Good thing I’m not asking,” the prat said, and just like that his abnormally long, slender fingers had wrapped themselves around Harry’s arm in an equally abnormal iron-grip, and then he was heaving Harry up and out of his chair, eyes glinting something fierce.
At that, Draco’s own scowl returned in full force. “For the hundredth time, I did nothing to Potter except
Harry tried to pull away, and when that was unsucessful, he half-hissed into the dark, half-choked, “What are you doing—”
The healers had assured him there would be no lasting damage. Draco would make a full recovery, he just needed to sleep off the potions the healers had given him the night before to combat the effects of the Moonroot. After that he’d be discharged, good as new, as though none of the previous night’s occurrences had ever happened.
Only this time, he hadn’t been almost killed
Harry could only nod.
The Death Eater chuckled. “I told you you were done for.”
Urgh.
And it was a good thing he did, for mere moments later the fireplace shot up yet another round of green flames, and out rolled one scowling Corban Yaxley.
Except for that to work Harry would have to stand and, moreover,
Harry snorted bitterly. “Oh yeah. Pretty sure.”
Harry blinked, realizing belatedly that he must've been in a momentary daze of sorts, for he had completely lost track of the conversation. "Sorry, what?"
up. You’ve barely said a word this morning, plus you were up before me, which really is a phenomenon in itself.”
“He went to see Yaxley?” Nic sounded genuinely surprised.
“That they did,” Draco said softly, looking back down into the dark depths of his tea with a small, sad smile. “But no one else even took me seriously.”
Salazar, he thought bitterly, it was like Sixth Year all over again.
But Blaise didn’t so much as acknowledge his sarcastic greeting. He simply stood there in the half-open doorway, eyes wide and rimmed with dark, dark circles, fixing Draco with a mixture between horror and pity.
Blaise sent him an apologetic look. “And he and Ginevra found him in some dark, deserted alleyway near Knockturn Alley, lying in a puddle of his own blood.”
The quiet was so odd, so very eerie, after the commotion of the fight, and Draco could only blink at Harry, who wasn’t looking at him, hadn’t looked at him once since he’d appeared under the wan golden glow of the streetlamps. No, those green eyes were trained solely on Yaxley, and Draco couldn’t remember a time he’d ever seen such raw hatred in Harry’s eyes, not even when faced with Voldemort three years before. The intensity of it sent a chill down his spine.
Harry rolled his eyes and plopped down in the chair beside Pansy, and the two of them immediately fell back into conversation, which in all likelihood consisted of Pansy criticising his wardrobe and Harry vehemently defending it. But Draco could only guess, because the thunderous pounding of his heart was so loud it drowned out all else.
“Not particularly.”
“If Harry doesn’t remember anything anyway,” Ron piped up suddenly, “then it’s no use asking him questions, is it? There’ll be more than enough time for that once he gets discharged.”
Now, Harry knew perfectly well that him becoming friends with his long-time rival and even temporary enemy was a tad far-fetched. He doubted the Harry from two weeks ago would have believed it could ever happen. Draco and he had hated each other for years and never missed an opportunity to make that obvious. So, Harry’s friends being somewhat…
. Wished Yaxley could hurry it the hell up already and end it there and then, end it before Harry’s face actually burst into flame—because right now that was a real, legitimate possibility, and he didn’t think he could neither physically nor mentally survive any further humiliation.
Except there was no way he could Floo back to the flat, not yet, not with Yaxley so close by. If he was unlucky, Yaxley could jump into the fireplace with him, and then the situation would rapidly go from bad to worse to abysmal. Because if Draco led that maniac back to Harry, accidentally or not…
He pointedly waited for Harry to nod before turning on his heel and striding as quickly away from those horrid emerald eyes as he could.
And so, before Draco could utter the words Harry was so averse to hearing, the Gryffindor shook his head.
you want to go now. You’re so bloody Gryffindor, Potter, I think I might just be sick.”
He only realised he was staring at Harry again when his mother cleared her throat. But he couldn’t find it in himself to be even moderately embarrassed. Instead, Draco squeezed his boyfriend’s hand again, intertwining their fingers for good measure, and then turned to his mother.
. And I know you may think you can’t die, but one day it’ll happen.”
Harry smiled gratefully, pulling both his best friends into another hug. The soft smile curling across his lips was enough to momentarily distract Draco from the sea of worries currently churning away in his gut, if only for a brief second.
Weasley grumbled, “Whatever. While we’re here, you should know Robards wanted to see you, Malfoy. Didn’t say why, but I reckon it’ll have something to do with the case.”
“Come out, my dear boy,” Yaxley crooned again, and Draco could hear his footsteps on the wooden floor. Draco inhaled deep.
It was goddamn Blaise Zabini that held Draco steady, clothed head to toe in healer’s white, his black, impeccably styled hair a cruel mockery of the similarly coloured rat’s nest Draco would much rather be face to face with right about now.
If Dominic Hayes ever met Narcissa Malfoy, Draco thought at that moment, then he’d better kiss the very ground she walked on—for without her scrupulous training in self-control, Draco had no doubt he would have murdered the man then and there.
He glanced once at Blaise, his earlier promise coming back to mind, only to find the latter already looking at him concernedly, as though he could read Draco’s thoughts right off his face. Honestly, he probably could.
Draco froze, caught off guard by both the bluntness of that statement and the usage of his first name. “I can assure you, Granger, I—”
But, no—he knew why. This vulnerable, slightly self-conscious person sitting on the armchair across from Harry’s, one foot tucked under the other leg, book sprawled open across his lap—this was the real Draco. The one Harry assumed the Slytherin had either hidden away during Hogwarts for the sake of saving face, or simply hadn’t discovered yet himself. But one thing Harry knew for certain, and that was that the old Draco Malfoy, the one that had made Harry’s life a living hell, the one that had called Hermione a mudblood—he had left the picture right alongside Lucius Malfoy as the latter was carted off to Azkaban.
The other Auror grimaced. Draco couldn’t tell whether the frown was directed at him (wouldn’t be the first time), or simply a nonspecific, all-inclusive sort of thing.
him.”
They sat there in relatively tense silence for a few minutes more, Harry silently eating his Thai while Malfoy sat staring at the fireplace, evidently uneasy, when Harry finally decided enough was enough.
. He was acting ridiculous.
“Draco, are you—” Harry began tentatively, taking a step towards him, and there was worry lacing his tone, coating his expression, worry and concern.
Hermione sent him a look, the sort that was both reprimanding and sympathetic all at once. More reprimanding, though. "I was just telling Nic here about how you were tempted to stay at Hogwarts as a teacher after the war, before you decided to join the Aurors."
“Yes, I suppose it is,” was all Draco said, however, voice pitifully strained. Harry grinned, and so the blond cleared his throat before adding evenly, “I don’t think he appreciated a bunch of Slytherins ‘keeping you company’. Honestly, he looked quite distressed.”
If he’d looked shocked before, Harry was absolutely baffled now, and Draco could only share the sentiment as he gaped over at his friend. But Harry nodded through his stunned state, and said, “I—yeah, okay. Sure. Why not.” He paused. “You’re still going to call me Potter, aren’t you?”
Malfoy nodded, unease gone for a moment. “Me too. It’s something I wanted to do since I was a child, to be honest. A bit of a childhood dream of mine, if you will. Not that I actually thought I’d get to do it. Not with my…circumstances.” Harry strongly suspected those circumstances had a name, one that began with Lucius and ended with Malfoy. But he stayed quiet and let his former rival talk. “Anyway, after the war, I wanted to do something I liked. Something that would…help. So, I did.” Suddenly, the Slytherin froze, and when his eyes found Harry’s his familiar sneer had returned—as though he’d realized just who it was he’d started to open up to, if only for an instant. “Of course, compared to the Boy Who Lived, I’m nothing, but I like to think I’m good at what I do, nonetheless.”
“Why, Potter, I never knew you had such a way with words.” The Slytherin lifted his hand to his chest. “I’m touched. Also, right back at you.”
“Why thank you.”
? How is that even possible?”
Except, on second thought, perhaps this hadn’t been the wisest course of action either.
But instead, she simply averted her eyes and said, “Hullo, Malfoy.”
“What?” shrieked Pansy, at the same time that Harry said, “A
They both chuckled at that, and that’s when Draco remembered the stranger; he’d been part of the pack of Gryffindors that had nearly kicked down the door to Harry’s hospital room on the night of the poisoning. So, clearly, he wasn’t a stranger to Harry. Draco’s eyes turned assessing as he took in this Nic-person. He was tall and reasonably handsome, Draco supposed, with his blue eyes and curly hair and annoying fucking dimples, wearing a smile far too wide as he regarded Harry.
!” from his traitorous mouth.
Finally, Draco cleared his throat. “Call it a tie, then? By the way things were going, I think that assessment is fairest.” The Slytherin kept his voice neutral and light and calm, and if Harry didn’t know so much better now, he might have been fooled by Draco’s apparent nonchalance. But there was a certain edge to his tone, a strain in his words, and he still wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes.
“Draco, I’d like to—no—I
But at that moment all he let himself think about was the fact that Harry was here, Harry was his, they were dating, they were kissing—this was real.
,” the blond repeated. “
. Him. Malfoy.”
“Harry’s safe, and he’s alive,” Ron interrupted his sister, shrugging again. “That’s all that matters at the moment. Plus, the sooner he heals, the sooner someone can take a look at his mind and check to see whether he was Obliviated, and whether anything can be salvaged.”
Except, at that exact moment, Ron opened his mouth as well. “So, mate, about Malfoy—”
Blaise was not impressed. “A capable hand now, are you?” His gaze flickered down to Draco’s wrist. “You sure this whole duty-bound-business has nothing to do with that soulmark you’re currently clutching like a lifeline? It nearly got you killed yesterday, and yet here you are, anxious to jump right back in.”
Bloody
“You’re…baking,” Harry said stupidly, his surprise evidently still coating his mind thicker than he’d initially assumed. “And…wearing Hermione’s old apron.”
Blaise immediately copied her gleeful grin. “Oh yes, so much better. Why, he looks positively dashing. I especially love the earring. Don’t you agree, Draco?”
“Then it’s a good thing I don’t give a flying fuck what Healer Hodkinson thinks, eh?”
Draco scowled down into his coffee. “Fucking prat,” he grumbled, but Harry’s smile—beam, now, really—couldn’t be dimmed.
Draco stirred his tea and waited.
And now he was back to thinking about Draco.
, why was he suddenly acting like a blustering schoolboy?!
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t quite shake his smile. “Oh, sod off, you’re just being melodramatic—as always. I bet you’d love Thai, if you’d just try it instead of immediately turning your pureblood nose up at it because it’s muggle.”
So he wrenched his gaze away from Harry and instead fixated his mother, who was still watching Harry with obvious amusement. Draco’s lips twitched. Amusement was good. Amusement he could work with.
His frown only deepened when he reached their table, especially when Pansy said gleefully, “There he is, my masterpiece! My ugly-duckling-turned-swan! What do you think, boys, doesn’t he look so much more like a Saviour?”
Harry did not even know what to say to that.
She opened her mouth to speak, to say something that would no doubt just make Draco’s day even worse, and the latter wondered miserably when his life had become such utter shit (trick question, it’d always been utter shit).
Red blossomed across Harry’s cheeks, and the sight alone made Draco melt just a little inside. Melt, because
“Does something have to be wrong for me to want to kiss my boyfriend?” he said and began a trail of kisses down the Gryffindor’s jaw, his neck, his collarbone.
. Harry looked so genuinely hurt under all that anger, hurt and disappointed.
Perhaps it ought to have told him something that Blaise didn’t even blink at his outburst, that he didn’t glare or get angry, that all he did was heave an especially exasperated sigh and shake his head and say, “Look, I can’t promise you’ll get notified before Granger—because, let’s face it, that woman knows
"Right," Harry said dumbly, and he could practically
Everyone wanted to know who the soulmate of The Boy Who Lived Twice was. Everyone, that is, except Draco.
Draco had already tried multiple times to get into that room. To be the one sitting across from Yaxley, interrogating him. But Robards had shot him down immediately—
He was wrong, of course.
Thing is, Harry had never wasted much thought on his love life, not when there was the ever-present threat of Voldemort looming over his head. Now that the war was over and Voldemort was nothing but dust, well…Harry was out of his depth. There. He’d admitted it. It was one of the reasons the mere mention of Ginny’s name made him wince instinctively.
Harry searched the blond’s expression for the typical sneer that accompanied his scathing remarks, searched his tone for any hint of haughty disdain. And although Draco was plenty haughty, that, Harry was fairly certain, was simply part of his nature just as much as breathing and eating and, apparently, insulting Harry. Yet, despite the obvious sarcasm lacing the Slytherin’s words, there was no aggression, no anger, no real heat at all behind them.
Nic snorted and shook his head, but judging by the pretty smile winding across his lips and the bright twinkle in his blue eyes, he didn’t seem particularly annoyed.
“I told you, that was
He couldn’t decide whether to be relieved or worried. On the one hand, this could mean Robards was finally heeding Draco’s requests for a more active role in the case, one that didn’t have him fretting all day about when, where and how Yaxley might strike next, left completely in the dark.
“Agreed,” Harry said. “Now, Draco—fancy a drink?”
But if Harry was being completely honest with himself, he
At that exact moment the door opened again and in walked Harry.
Because—and Harry would never admit this to Ron, though he strongly suspected the redhead already knew—Ron and Hermione really were perfect together, and he couldn't be happier for them if he tried.
His head snapped back up and he fixed the Slytherin with his best replica of Hermione’s most scathing glower. “You absolute prick, Malfoy. You are
what Blaise had been about to say.
“Err,” Potter began, rubbing the back of his neck, emerald eyes full of uncertainty. “So. About this newest…arrangement.”
The problem was, however, that Harry had absolutely no idea how good parenting was supposed to look. His own childhood had been shite. That much was a fact. The Dursleys hadn’t exactly been good role models, and although the teachers at Hogwarts—McGonagall and Dumbledore especially—had certainly shaped Harry’s childhood in the best way, they still hadn’t been parent figures either. Guardians, sure, but parents…not so much.
Hermione's disapproving look leveled at him from across the table, right alongside Ron's amused one. "Right, sorry. Nic. Nice to meet you, too. Err, if you don't mind me asking, what're you...?" He trailed off awkwardly.
So, he decided to buy himself more of it.
Weasley didn’t appear at all placated, but still he shut his mouth and averted his gaze. Had he still not been so shell-shocked by Robards’ most recent verdict, Draco would have been impressed. The man wasn’t Head Auror for nothing.
, for God’s sake. “If it’s alright to ask, would you mind telling me a bit more about your sister? From what you’ve told me already, she sounded like a wonderful person.”
make a fantastic father. A bit strict, true, and maybe he’d struggle at the beginning. But after a year or two, he would get the hang of it, and then he’d excel at parenthood just as he excelled at everything else.
A strained silence ensued, in which Harry didn’t know what to say, how to react. His friends’ concern was nothing new, and yet it still hit him like the Knight Bus at full-speed every time he had to watch them get all tight-faced and concerned about his wellbeing. Even now, with years and years having passed since Harry had last been even remotely near Privet Drive, such unconditional love and loyalty was oftentimes still a novel concept to him. Sometimes, Harry would still find himself wondering when his friends would finally come to their senses and realize he didn’t deserve any of it, didn’t deserve them, didn’t deserve their help or trust or affection—but that day had yet to come.
“It wasn’t a compliment.”
think it a good idea to have
The old shopkeeper glared at Draco, her attention on him and him alone as her eyes took him in from top to bottom; his dragon-hide boots, his dark suit, well-tailored and immaculate, his light hair, a few loose strands framing his face. Appearance wise, Draco was and always had been the epitome of pureblood grace, the perfect image of all a Malfoy should be. And under the old woman’s assessing eyes, he let his face fall back into the harsh sneer his father had always worn to complete the look, hardened his eyes into impenetrable stone, stood tall and proud and unbending to the likes of her.
Harry stood so abruptly Draco started in surprise. But Harry just threw the half-eaten bar of chocolate onto the kitchen counter and extended his now-free hand to where the blond Slytherin still sat on the floor, looking torn between his previous misery and wary confusion.
There would be, as it turned out, little ‘winning over Harry Potter’ that day. For, when Draco Apparated back to Harry’s flat, he found it just as atrociously red as it had been the day before, but much, much emptier.
, point is, Nic was very fit. Nic, not Draco. Draco was a prat, a rude, self-centred, bigoted, overbearing, nasty little
Those stupidly green eyes of his danced with such pure joy it made Draco’s heart skip a beat, and all he could do was stare and think ‘That’s my soulmate, and he loves me’.
“Look, mate, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said truthfully, eliciting a few poorly suppressed gasps from the rest of the room. He ignored them all. “But, whatever happened, I know it wasn’t your fault. Okay? So please don’t apologize. You’ve done nothing wrong.”
The female Weasel scowled, eyes narrowing dangerously.
he shouldn’t have told Draco about that. Leave it to a Slytherin to blackmail you with something you confessed in a Butterbeer-induced sugar haze on the night you both almost got murdered by a wrathful, deranged Death Eater.
Harry honestly thought Draco might murder Ron when the redhead came stumbling into the kitchen, that’s how livid the Slytherin looked. But before any such homicidal leanings could be acted upon, Ron exclaimed, “Yaxley’s been caught!”
Hrmph.
Draco scoffed. “This coming from Harry sodding Potter. If I’m a menace, you’re a bloody pest.” But the next time Harry looked up again—furtively and through the corner of his eye, so Draco wouldn’t notice—there was a soft grin playing across the Slytherin’s face as he looked down into his mug.
He was just opening his mouth to change the topic, when suddenly, a commotion on the other side of the restaurant caught his attention.
stands for my name, seeing as he certainly doesn’t have any feelings for me? Yes, yes and yes.” He groaned. “Why can’t I just be in love with you like a sane bloke.”
.” Harry made a vague gesture at where Draco sat serenely in his armchair, leafing through his book, as though he hadn’t been all hellfire-and-wrath-of-the-gods just minutes before. “Normal people—
, Harry, the vampire one? Set in the 1800s? With that Veela Ron thought was oh so pretty?” Hermione supplied, looking rather exasperated as she did. Her glare focused first on her fiancé, then Harry, a reproving little frown creasing her face, and she didn’t need to utter a single word to voice her plainly obvious thoughts: ‘Honestly, do either of you
Harry gave her a dubious look, as though he couldn’t quite figure out whether she was being serious or not. Not that Draco could blame him; Pansy was an enigma at best, a complete nutcase at worst. “How come people expect me to tell them any- and everything they want to know about
Harry shook his head and batted him away half-heartedly, except he couldn’t help but laugh, and Draco was still standing in the way, effectively trapping the Gryffindor between the kitchen counter and himself. And so, whatever feeble resistance Harry might have meant to put up, it was effectively brought to an end when Draco’s lips crashed back into his, protests fading away and out of mind within a split-second.
It was his bloody life, wasn’t it? His knowledge on the subject may be limited, but soulmates seemed like something very private—not something to be broadcasted across the entirety of the wizarding world.
However, before either Harry or Malfoy could say another word, the doors were thrown open once more, and in rushed the concerned faces of Harry’s friends, Hermione at the head of the pack.
Now, Draco was well-aware that sort of total indifference likely wasn’t healthy, but his head still throbbed where it had collided with the bookshelf on the other side of the room, so he didn’t waste much energy on it. The bookshelf in question now stood empty, all its contents scattered across the torn-up floor. Not that the mess was particularly noticeable—no, the entirety of Renaults and Co. was in too much disarray for that to be the case.
Surprise flashed across Nic’s face, that and something else. “Oh. Uhm. Yeah. Yeah, he is.” Something in his tone was odd, but Harry couldn’t put his finger on what, exactly, and then Nic was continuing, “My older sister, Cordelia, moved back here a few years before the war. She wanted to be an Auror. It was her life-long dream, you see. And, let me tell you, if that girl put her mind to something, you’d have a hard time trying to talk her out of it. Delia went into Auror training and graduated just a few years before the war really kicked off. She was…good at it. Really good, in fact. Graduated top of her class.” A wistful smile coasted across Nic’s face, and this time the pain in his eyes was heart-wrenchingly obvious. He shook his head, as if to clear his mind. “Anyway, long story short, she got into a duel with a bunch of Death Eaters and…didn’t make it out. She put up a fight, though. Took three of them out, just by herself. That was Delia: a fighter, through and through.”
,” exclaimed Ron, voice muffled. “You’re alive.”
As you may or may not have noticed, this update's a week late. Sorry. I'm afraid my workload is picking up again, so unfortunately I can't truly promise you weekly updates for the next couple of chapters. But they will come!!! This story will not be abandoned, I swear it on Narcissa Malfoy's favourite china set ;)
expected there to be a lot more…issues. Definitely more fighting, for one, with Malfoy spewing insults right along the lines of ‘half-blood scum’ or ‘attention-seeking, muggle-loving imbecile’ or—Harry’s personal favourite; the Dursleys had always
“Tuesday was the anniversary of Delia’s death,” Nic continued, “and I was trying to keep it together. I was doing a pretty good job at it, too. Until, you know.” He made a vague motion with his hand. “I snapped. I’m sorry. My anger wasn’t directed towards you. I just saw you, a Malfoy, and I remembered who you were, what you were, and I…didn’t handle things well.”
He must have been staring again, for someone cleared their throat. But Harry didn’t care.
Harry tried to sit up again, only to collapse yet again with a groan that was part frustration and part pain.
Hermione smiled. “That’s all I ask.”
Yaxley simply sat there with that slippery smile of his and watched Draco, and as much as Draco wanted to hit the man, wanted to see him bleed, he also wanted nothing more than to
But Draco’s eyes only narrowed, both his glare and tone as cold as ice as he hissed, “Funny, I was about to say the same thing.”
But Draco also couldn’t lie, not to Harry. Not ever to Harry.

to open his mouth.
“—working on him as we speak.” It was Blaise again, but his voice sounded oddly far away, as though he weren’t standing across the room but on the other side of a large, yawning chasm, separating Draco from the rest of the world. “He’ll pull through; he’s
Granger’s flinch was answer enough.
When they’d been walking aimlessly for what felt to Draco like hours but could be no more than five minutes, he decided enough was enough. They’d been
Draco nodded, still smiling. “Sounds like a plan.”
Thankfully, Draco didn’t urge him to elaborate. Whether that was because he could read Harry like an open book and recognised his apparent inability to look him in the eye for what it truly was—Harry sure hoped not—or simply some uncharacteristic show of generosity, Harry didn’t much care.
tell me that’s chocolate,” she said, and more or less shoved Harry out of the way, steering towards the bowl of cake batter still sitting innocently on the counter.
Draco didn’t know how to answer. He simply nodded. “I dare say that’s understandable.”

“Oh.”
Plus, with a smile like that, the type that could light up even the darkest of rooms, soften even the hardest of hearts, bring warmth to even the coldest of days—with a smile like that, who cared about the rest.
“Hey,” Harry said again, a hand lifting up to cup Draco’s jaw. The latter, weak sod that he was, instinctively leaned into the touch, feeling his resolve crumble under that vivid green gaze he’d come to adore so. “No judgement, remember? I promised you you could tell me anything and I would never think badly of you for it, didn’t I?” Harry smiled. “I intend to keep that promise.”
But still.
. Seriously, Ron. I’m fine.”
you, after all I risked, all I did for you, you insolent little brat—”
Thankfully, both Pansy and Harry were too busy laughing again to notice, it seemed, although judging by the evil glint in Pansy’s eyes, she knew
Because, truly, there was nothing he had ever meant more.
And suddenly Draco’s heart felt constricted again, as though some invisible pair of hands had reached right inside his chest and started kneading it like dough, pulling and prodding and twisting it in the most unnatural of ways.
Yes, Draco thought distantly, that sounds about right.
The She-Weasel’s brown eyes narrowed, eyes nothing but slits as she took Draco in from head to toe. He could practically see the gears turning in her head, and if his mind weren’t so very preoccupied with other, far more pressing matters, Draco might have found himself concerned.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Hell if I know. I mean, you saw how angry he was when he got back from the Ministry. He was livid and wouldn’t even tell me why. I figured it must’ve been because of Yaxley—”
And Harry laughed despite himself, focusing his attention back on his half-eaten platter of rice. “Yes, Malfoy. Understood.”
He donned his most inscrutable expression, schooling his features into calm unreadability. Because while there certainly had been a very good reason why Draco hadn’t been able to inform the Ministry, he was fairly certain Harry’s face would actually burst into flames if Draco now went and recounted the details for his boyfriend’s best mates to hear. And he happened to like Harry’s face quite a lot, so that was not an option.
“Wait, we’re outside,” Harry said, and Draco wondered not for the first nor the last time how the fuck he’d ended up in love with such a complete and utter imbecile.
Malfoy blinked, and shut his previously agape mouth. “Please, Potter,” he drawled, but his tone was void of its usual superiority, instead sounding oddly strangled. “I’d rather starve before eating the greasy filth muggles call food.”
He’d just helped himself to a piece of Draco’s chocolate cake—which, it should be stressed, was absolutely delicious, despite the fact that most of it had ended up in Harry’s sink—when a crash sounded and Hermione tumbled into sight, bushy hair even more of a mess than usual. Draco gave a start, nearly dropping his book.
have enough on their plate at the moment. Need I remind you, Yaxley’s murder—”
“Nah,” said Harry and turned back to the Healer, smiling ever so slightly. “I think we’re good.”
However, sitting there at the kitchen table, across from his best friend, his wonderful, amazing best friend…well.
Draco froze.
Honestly, he didn’t know
They didn’t talk about Nic for the rest of the morning. But less than ten minutes after the beignet-incident, Draco shut his book with a decisive slam, stood, and marched into the kitchen. There was a grating sound, one Harry knew from years of living in the flat was the rubbish bin opening. Then seconds later a soft but definite thud.
, and why he heeded that voice over the roaring of his own reason, of his mind goading him to push back the man’s hood and get the answers he so desperately desired. Yet, he did. He paused, one hand still tightly clasped around his wand, the other hovering over the man.
on top, is simply too much.”
Seems he’d thought wrong.
Albeit seemingly being on different sides of the war, Harry had always held a grudging respect for Narcissa Malfoy. She wasn’t one to crack easily, and even after all she’d been through, she still sounded like the most amazing mother. She protected those she loved with a fervour—sort of like her son. Very much like her son.
Draco pointedly did not stare after Harry as he left. (Rather quickly, too; Draco hadn’t expected him to be
It was laughable really, how a single sentence—the mere usage of his soulmate’s name—was enough to freeze all Draco’s thoughts and effectively reduce his mind to an empty, useless mess.
Draco—and, he noted out of the corner of his eye, Potter as well—whirled to face the direction of the voice, sharp and cold as ice, and was not surprised in the least to find a tall, skeletal-looking woman standing in the doorway across the room, gripping a large jar of what appeared to be shrivelled tarantulas in her frail arms.
that the sight of it managed to tear Draco out of his momentary stupor. And as he looked at his soulmate, with his messy hair and crooked glasses and bright, bright red cheeks, all he could think was:
Once in the building, Draco didn’t slow down, instead pulling Harry up the two flights of stairs separating the ground-floor from the flat with renewed determination, only coming to a stop once the door had fallen shut behind them and they were both safely back in the flat.
everyday state of being these days—so he nodded simply. “Uh, sure.” When neither of the Slytherins made any move to leave, Parkinson staring at him expectantly, that bloody smirk of hers still wide, he blinked and said awkwardly, “Oh. You mean in here. Alone. Err, sure thing, I’ll just…get going then. Uhm…bye?”
Well.
Silence descended back upon them, a silence static with tension. Except Harry wasn’t angry at Draco, not anymore, not by a long shot—though certainly not for lack of trying—so he wasn’t sure why the air all around them suddenly felt so charged.
“Ministry of Magic!”
However, before he could descend into hysteria, the door on the other side of the room swung open yet again, and before Harry could so much as blink, a flash of ginger had bolted across the room and thrown its arms around him.
Hayes waved a dismissive hand, and that’s when Draco knew for sure the git was planning something. There was no other explanation, especially after he said, “No worries, all is forgiven. Would I have liked to go on a few more dates with you? Sure. Who wouldn’t? But I suppose we can’t all have what we want, right?”
“I told you we’d come visit soon,” answered Hermione. “We would have come sooner, but I thought you might be asleep for a while. You look a lot better.”
. I—he—I have to—”
Draco opened his mouth. Closed it. Then he said, gently, cautiously, “Are you alright?”
Draco tumbled out of the fireplace and onto the dusty, grubby floor of Renaults and Co.
One day soon he would.
Ron snorted.
, Weasley, you and Granger both—”
The three Gryffindors broke apart, and then Hermione took her boyfriend’s hand and led him out the kitchen in what could only be described as a brisk walk.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Come off it, clearly
Another pulse of silence.
For a moment, no one spoke. No one moved, no one so much as breathed, and suddenly all Draco could think was that Harry would still be in the flat if Weasley hadn’t dragged him along into Diagon, if he’d paid closer attention and watched Draco’s boyfriend as he was meant to. Harry would have never encountered Yaxley’s accomplice, and he’d never gotten hurt, and Draco wouldn’t have to worry right now whether he’d even still have a boyfriend by the end of the day.
presence upon him?
Harry had been trapped inside his own apartment with Draco Malfoy of all people for a day now.
Narcissa’s lips quirked in displeasure, but she didn’t disagree.
, and didn’t that just make his heart soar.
. Bloody hell.
. What on earth was I thinking. So, nothing artistic. Nothing culinary. We can’t do any sports, not in here. I doubt you’d be all that good at sewing either, and, for the sake of my eardrums, I’d rather not test your musical abilities.”
“Good, because otherwise I might have to lodge a formal complaint. St Mungo’s can hardly in good conscience let you treat the ill and disabled if you yourself are delirious.”
“Fred?”
!” just as another volley of spells came speeding their way. None of them were green, thank Salazar, otherwise Draco’s shield would have done them no good whatsoever.
Not for the reasons one might think, though. Twenty was a good age to be, he supposed. Old enough to be considered a (semi) capable adult by most—not that Harry
Draco, who, Harry realized belatedly, not only stood just the slightest bit too close, but was also still wrapped in a pale pink apron covered in chocolate stains.
“For fuck’s sake, why does
Yet all Draco could do was watch the scene unfold in front of him and think to himself what a shame it was that Yaxley had, in his mad murder-frenzy, somehow managed to tear up the carpet. Shame, that; it had been the only moderately tasteful item in the entirety of this godsforsaken store.
“Draco,” he breathed, and his eyes went wide in horror as he raked a hand through his hair, completely ignoring the dull echo of pain it caused him. “Oh bloody hell,
Blaise looked at him for a long while, gaze unreadable. Then he patted Draco on the shoulder before letting him go again. “You know what, on second thought, I think you going back to Potter’s flat might not be such a horrendous idea after all. Knowing him, he’s likely duelling Voldemort’s secret evil daughter as we speak and could use your…capable hands. I’ll sort everything out with Healer Hodkinson. In case you need to come back for a check-up, I’ll owl you, yeah?”
. We need to head over to Diagon.”
Harry furrowed his brow, already opening his mouth to reply.
Now, Harry had never once in his life claimed he was good at relationships. Quite the contrary—he was well-aware he was and likely always would be rather pants at the whole affair.

aligned, and he
Treatment for spell damage.
And with that ominous threat, the message cut off, and the magpie faded away.
“I grow tired of this,” Yaxley said, voice indeed sharper, and underscored his point with two further bangs of green. One of them struck a vase on a bookshelf to Draco’s right, causing it to shatter into a million tiny pieces, while the other hit the desk, raining paperwork down on the Slytherin. “Come out and play, Draco. Otherwise, you leave me no choice.”
Draco’s lips twitched downwards into a frown, that cautious, soft smile gone. “She’s…doing better, I suppose. Still not quite good, but better, nonetheless.”
, that he would never forget those who could not. Those, who had given up their lives to ensure others might keep theirs.
But he couldn’t claim something hadn’t changed in Renaults and Co., something so profound it had sent the typically so expressive Slytherin into a lapse of never-ending silence. Even now, ten minutes after they’d left the shop, Malfoy still hadn’t uttered a single word. He’d simply handed the vial of Philomena Craigs’ memories to Jennings and walked away, leaving Harry to quickly say goodbye to the two other Aurors before zipping after him. Malfoy hadn’t even
“Not that I didn’t immensely enjoy seeing you again, Potter,” she said, her tone back to the sing-song lightness it had held before, “but I have something I need to discuss with Draco here. So, if you’d excuse us for a moment. I’ll make it quick, so you can have him back in no time.”
“Don’t.”
Harry ducked his head, fingers curling back around his glass. “Yeah, something like that.”
Because, honestly, that was enough.
have to die. It’s nothing personal, of course. I actually quite like you, to be honest. You’re refreshingly straightforward in most everything you do, and trust me when I say, that is not a trait you see very often in figureheads such as yourself. But I’m afraid it’s all part of the plan, so”—he shrugged—“tough luck, I guess.”
Only to find two familiar wide, dark blue eyes staring back at him, set into an equally familiar face framed by equally familiar brown curls.
But then the Slytherin said quietly, so quietly it was barely more than a whisper, “I don’t know.”
Harry took a deep breath, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Might as well just get it over with.
Potter nodded again and wordlessly finished loading his dish-launderer.
Yaxley cocked his head to the side and,
Laughable, if not so damn terrifying.
you good at?” asked Draco, looking with his pensive frown and…crinkly crinkle as though he really couldn’t for the life of him come up with a single strength of Harry’s.
But when he did, there was neither anger, nor disgust on her face, and instead a smug sort of amusement that mentally shocked him into next week.
! Good luck trying to convince Mum of that, though.”
—seriously?”
But nothing—
“Malfoy, come over here,” he said, beckoning him over, and Draco wasn’t even tempted to remind the idiot again not to summon him like a dog. Merlin, what was happening to him?
Their table was utterly silent, until Ron said hesitantly, “Mate, is it…?”
Harry was too stunned to reply. Ron’s words echoed in his mind. This could all be over in few minutes. If they caught Yaxley now and locked him up in Azkaban again, everything would go back to normal. Harry would be able to go outside again, would be able to go to work, would be able to hang out with his friends without them having to all pile into his apartment.
Harry raised an eyebrow, delighted to finally see their roles reversed, with Draco the embarrassed one while Harry watched, arms crossed and amused. “We’d lived in the same castle for six years, Draco, you can’t honestly claim you ‘hardly knew me’. Are you sure that’s why you didn’t want any? Not because, oh, I don’t know, you were a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat who refused muggle food on principle?”
Harry lifted a hand in a little wave, smiling sheepishly as his two best friends stared at him in unconcealed shock. “Err…hi?”
the Draco of four years ago, contrary to what Yaxley claimed.
Harry didn’t have the words to describe how very much he currently wanted to strangle one Draco Lucius Malfoy, how much the thought of him made his gut twist and his chest constrict, how much he wished he never had to see the Slytherin’s stupid, pointy, annoyingly symmetrical face ever again, not later today, not tomorrow, not in a million years.
And now…well, now Harry was completely bamboozled.
“You thought you could betray the Dark Lord and walk away scot-free, didn’t you?” Yaxley hissed. “Join up with Harry Potter and his mudblood friends and enjoy life as a free man, as though you’d never taken the Mark at all? Lucius is right to despise you. Hell, if I had a disgraceful traitor like you as a son, I would rid the world of you myself.” Those dark eyes twinkled then, and although the flickering lights of the streetlamps lining the cobbled path illuminated Yaxley’s severe features, Draco thought the light made his eyes look even blacker.
He hadn’t expected some heartfelt apology, hadn’t even expected Lucius to reply at all. Going on past experiences alone, Draco could say with complete certainty that being actually helpful was beyond the man’s capabilities.
Harry stood and made his way towards the window, wondering whether it was one of his friends checking up on him. That seemed likely. At times, he still found himself questioning what he’d done to deserve such an incredible, caring bunch of people as his friends.
Draco’s lips quirked into the beginning of what might’ve been a grin. His posture had already lost most if not all of its previous rigidity, his shoulders no longer tight and his back no longer straight as an arrow, and the cold seeping out of his expression, replaced by that warm little smirk Harry had gotten so used to, was almost a palpable thing. Whether it was due to this or simply Harry’s inborn curiosity, he couldn’t say for sure, but before he could think twice about it, he blurted out, “Why didn’t you give him a second chance?”
Harry actually did groan this time, only barely resisting the urge to slam his head against the table. Good god, of course it would come to this.
Harry had a feeling if he went to search for more beignets now, he’d find they had magically disappeared.
“Draco,” the other Slytherin said. His tone was maddeningly calm and gentle, just as it always was, which in turn annoyed Draco to no end. Annoyed, and unsettled, but he chose to overlook the latter. “Where’s your injury?”
Draco snorted, but he had to hand it to the man—at least his candour was spot-on. With all the shit he’d had to face over the past three years, the blond had learned to appreciate when someone was an arse to his face instead of behind his back.
week without appearing on the front page, that’s all I ask for!”
“No.”
There it was again, that completely baffling look, the sort that made the Slytherin’s eyes glint and glimmer like silver flames. Not in the abrasive way they always had at Hogwarts when Draco had sneered and insulted Harry and his friends in favour of his father’s corrupt ideology—and yet it was even more intense than those glares and scowls and grimaces ever had been.
To put up, but also to spot.
Anywho, enjoy Chapter 14, it's quite something!
The she-devil simply puckered her violet lips and fluttered her eyelashes and cooed “Love you, too, darling”, and Draco knew the gesture alone would be enough to send his heart a-fluttering, were he not, of course, so regrettably gay.
something happens, I swear on my mother’s favourite china set that I will make you regret the day you were born.”
First of all, I'd like to say I'm sorry. Both to you my lovely readers, and to my baby Draco, because.
Yes, Harry was definitely blushing now, there was no doubt about it. The Gryffindor nodded. “Sounds good.”
Nic smiled—and then he was gone in a poof of green fire.
. I still don’t want to believe it. The Death Eater who was in charge of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission alongside Umbridge. For fuck’s sake, Harry, you could have
They sat across each other at the kitchen table, and Harry would honest-to-god rather duel a Death Eater than suffer another single second in the supreme awkwardness that was that moment.
Harry let out a little huff. “Does it really matter? You can either stay there and be miserable, or you can get up and do something that might take your mind off everything. And I, for one, would much rather appreciate option number two.” He wiggled his outstretched hand. “So, come on. Get up.”
expected to happen, not even in his wildest dreams.
, might I add. How many times have you almost died now, exactly? Do you even keep count anymore?”
And—for let it be known that, contrary to public opinion, Harry Potter did still possess the most basic of self-preservation instincts—he heeded the Slytherin’s command and, careful not to so much as glance back over at Draco, with his stupid hair and stupid silver eyes, turned on his heel and fled.
Yaxley didn’t move, didn’t blink, and were it not for the fact that he knew so much better, Draco might have thought the man dead where he sat. Oh, wouldn’t that be a hilarious turn of events. All the effort they’d put into finding the man, catching him, detaining him so he could spend the rest of his days in Azkaban—and a poorly-timed heart attack was all it’d take to undo.
Instantly, both Healers started speaking again, but Harry held up a silencing hand. He still didn’t care whether or not he was being rude; they’d just insinuated Draco had done this to him—whatever the fuck
, befriending Harry, kissing him, throwing caution to the wind and telling him the truth.
Anyway, seeing as Christmas'll be over by the time I update next, I'd just like to wish all of you wonderful people a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!! 2021 has got to be better than 2020, right?
Harry looked up, and his eyebrows were knitted together over his eyes, eyes that shone with genuine worry. And Draco realised something, something he’d assumed beforehand, of course, something he’d hoped was true but had never dared get his hopes up.
“Pansy’s with your mum right now. She’s resting. Stayed up all night, frantic about you. I think it’s best we let her sleep, yeah? You can Floo her later, once she’s awake again and in a…less fragile state. I’ll have Pansy send you an owl.”
And then he gripped Draco’s wrist—his right wrist—and pulled him out of the room.
Draco’s brow furrowed, and he squinted first at the hand, then up at Harry. “Why?”
pleased, in fact, that you’d soon find yourself promptly without the family name you currently take such pleasure in defiling.”
Yaxley threw another curse at the desk, and Draco took that moment of temporary distraction to roll out from his hiding place and fire a non-verbal ‘Flipendo’ at the Death Eater. He didn’t waste time to see whether or not his spell had hit its target but judging by the enraged outcry and subsequent slam of a body hitting the adjacent wall, Draco figured it had.
“Yaxley’s
Harry could only stare. “I…of course, I know that, it’s just…that…but you…” He quickly gave up on words, instead simply making a helpless, entirely involuntary sound that had him cringing.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry mumbled as he practically jumped out of the way, wincing ever so slightly when Draco grimaced but then quickly schooled his features back into unreadability and strode past him with all the grace Harry would never have.
“Ooh, reverting to threats,” jeered Weasley, looking more She-Devil than She-Weasel with her fiery red hair and flashing eyes. “Now I’m scared. How entirely unexpected, from a Malfoy.”
“Yes?” Potter asked, and Draco gritted his teeth. The man could be the most oblivious little git on the planet, but of course the instant Draco faltered even for a second, he immediately took notice.
Harry flinched, but Hermione was too deep in thought to notice.

to do any of that right now. So, instead the Slytherin simply sat there and wondered to himself how much longer he could realistically keep up this show of restraint before he had a mental breakdown.

Yes, it was fear in those pitch-black, merciless eyes as Yaxley looked across the room, and Draco followed the Death Eater’s gaze, only to find the hooded stranger standing there, wand-arm lifted and trained directly at Yaxley.

And a hand wrapped itself around his ankle, just as the office disappeared entirely.
But Draco wasn’t done yet; mouth set into a grim but determined line, he advanced, tuning out all outside noise—Philomena’s screams, Yaxley’s spat insults, his own pounding heart. Draco pushed his all into the volley of spells that exploded all over Yaxley’s shield in bursts of colour, and still he pressed on, on, on.
Nic glanced once at Harry, then back at Draco, and the emotions that passed across his face at that moment were so many so fast that Harry had not the slightest chance at interpreting even one. But then he sighed, and looked back at Harry with a tight but sincere-enough seeming smile.
Hayes just stared at them for another long moment, expression unreadable, and Draco clenched his jaw, bracing himself for a jolly good round of homophobia. Except then he realised abruptly, oh wait, no, Hayes was queer himself. After all, the bastard had tried to get with Draco’s boyfriend.
He looked and sounded almost threatening, a warning in all but words, eyes drilling into Draco’s as though daring him to refuse, to play it all off as a simple fling or dalliance.
However, he forced himself to remain calm and composed, at least outwardly, and offered a stiff nod, falling into step behind Potter as he and the other two Aurors made their way down the alley to the small, dilapidated-looking shop with the silver-lettered, cherry-wood sign proclaiming in large cursive letters ‘Renaults and Co.’.

“Draco,” he said again, trying to sit up for a third time only to subsequently collapse again in a bundle of aching limbs and clenched jaws. “Is he here? I need to see him.”
At that, Granger deflated visibly, a good portion of tension leaving her shoulders as she leaned on Weasley and breathed, “Oh, thank God.”

. Nasty, insufferable tossers, the lot of them.
She refocused her fiery glare on Draco. “I said it before and I’ll say it again: I don’t know what it is you’re playing at, but I don’t trust you, and neither should Harry. If he dies, it won’t be Ron’s or Hermione’s fault, it’ll be because his so-called ‘protector’ failed to protect him.”
Harry’s eyebrows lifted even higher. “Yeah? Ginny, you know perfectly well Head Auror Robards—”
At her nod, he groaned into his hands. “All this time, you knew, and yet that time I asked you whether you thought Malfoy was acting weird around Harry, you still didn’t tell me?! Why, I should break up with you on the spot. Hear that? It’s over. The wedding’s off. I’m sorry, I just can’t be with someone who won’t tell me when my best mate’s dating the biggest arsehole alive.” He sent Draco a look, not quite apologetic but not exactly hostile either.
. I fucked up. It

Harry felt it should be said that Draco, although evidently still shocked, recovered remarkably fast, as though Slytherins falling out of your chimney out of the blue was a completely normal thing. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he drawled, and his tone reminded Harry so much of Hogwarts-Draco he had to do a double-take—only to find the blond grinning from ear to ear. “I would look perfect even if I were as big as a house. Besides, my dear—fast metabolism.”
Right then, thought Draco. Now or never.
Oh Salazar. Salazar, Salazar, Salazar, no no no
. Sometimes Harry still couldn’t quite believe it.
The words reminded him of something Blaise had told him just a few days before, something that echoed through his mind even now.
It sounded more like a question than an actual observation, so Harry gave an awkward little nod. “Err…yeah?” He winced at how feeble that sounded. “I mean, yes. Yes, I am. Perfectly okay, as a matter of fact. Never been bet—”
Merlin and Morgana above, someone kill him
He should be overjoyed. Ecstatic, even. But, for some reason, he instead found himself glancing surreptitiously over at Draco, who now sat as rigid in his armchair as he had that first day, grey eyes cool and unreadable as he looked almost determinedly not at Harry.
And then…
Oh no.
particularly capable or very adult-ish. Old enough to drink. Yeah, that was certainly a perk. Old enough to confidently say he had a solid foot in the door that was life, with hopefully many more years to come. The beginning of an adventure, so to speak. Not that Harry hadn't already had enough 'adventures' to last a lifetime.
“Ginny?” he said, alarmed. “Shit, are you alright? What happened?”
And before the other man could interrogate him any further, Draco slipped off the windowsill and made to shoulder past the shorter Auror. Except that turned promptly impossible when he very nearly collapsed to the floor the moment his feet hit the ground, a wave of such intense and all-consuming agony ripping through him he doubled over, cursing.
There was a long beat of silence.

Not to mention—” Yaxley’s blade dug deeper into Draco’s skin, and this time he couldn’t suppress a slight yelp as the blade drew blood. “—any sudden movements on your part would result in the untimely demise of Mr. Malfoy over here. Not that I imagine anyone would miss him much.” A gruff laugh sounded near Draco’s ear, so cold and merciless and

“And your parents? What do they do? Do they live in the States or over here?”
“Harry,” Draco said, only to clear his throat rather forcefully and avert his eyes to look down at the mattress. “I…I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have left you to go to the Ministry. If I’d stayed, if I’d been there, then none of this would have happened, and you wouldn’t be…you wouldn’t have almost—”
The knowledge would be reassuring if, that is, it hadn’t already worked so tremendously well.
“No.”
Harry was about to protest. But before he could utter a single word, Blaise was already speaking.
All rationality and sensibility seeped from his mind with a snap.
Honestly, Harry had better shower him with kisses later, because under the narrow-eyed, painfully blatant stare Weasley was currently fixing him with, not tackling the oaf then and there was likely the biggest show of restraint Draco had ever exhibited.
Nic’s mouth tapered, and he shot another wary look at Draco, who simply smiled back, expression so sickly sweet it reminded Harry briefly and repulsively of Dolores Umbridge, may her soul rot in hell.
convinced, either.
All in discomfort, of course. All in discomfort.
And Harry had faced many daunting situations before in his life. He’d faced an entire childhood of living with the Dursleys, faced dragons and dementors and basilisks and about a hundred different monsters that'd have a grown man cowering in fear. For Merlin's sake, he'd faced bloody
So, he’d been able to enjoy a quiet afternoon with his best friends, had been able to talk and laugh and joke and do all the things normal twenty-year-olds did when out and about.
, which was just wrong on so, so, so many levels, and it made him want to turn back time and put things right.
Healer Hodkinson traded an uneasy look with his colleague. “I really don’t think you’re up for such news, Mr. Potter. You only just woke up from quite a taxing procedure, you ought to rest—”
Blaise, who stood leaning against the doorframe by Pansy’s chair, snorted, raising an eyebrow. “Hmm, you sure? I highly doubt Draco would appreciate that.”
“You heard that, didn’t you?”
“Alright there, Malfoy?” he asked. “Need some water?”
Ginny’s sobs stopped for a moment, and she looked up at him. But instead of the desperation Harry had glimpsed in those first few seconds before she’d bodily thrown herself at him, there was something much harder there now, something borderline…angry.
He couldn’t say exactly why he’d decided to forgo that perfectly lovely plan in favor of doing some night-time strolling through Diagon Alley, but he’d found himself doing it anyways. But whatever his plans might have been, finding Harry Potter in the alley, all alone, hunched over in pain, coughing up what looked disturbingly like blood, was definitely not part of them.
No, they hurt because they were true, and Draco knew it.
need this right now, didn’t need fucking Weaselby interrogating him in a hospital corridor on top of everything else. “Well, believe it. I don’t have the patience nor the restraint to explain it to you right now,
her right now.
Ever since then, it had been an endless spiral of pining, and since Draco never thought he’d actually get to kiss Harry, he’d simply imagined it.
“I’m so sorry,” he said, rather pathetically. “I can’t even imagine. What about your father? Can he do anything to help her?”
Plus, past mistakes aside, Narcissa Malfoy reminded Harry of what he imagined his mother might have been like, had Lily Potter been given the chance to raise a son of her own.
Hermione, bless her, didn’t hesitate even a fraction of a second before nodding.
Draco didn’t mean to shout, truly, he didn’t, but somehow he still ended up doing just that, and by the time he was done, almost all neighbouring tables were staring.
Draco chuckled lightly. “Aren’t you, though? There’ve been so many people after you these past nine years that, frankly, I see no other explanation for how you’re still alive.”
why he was here?”
Well, shit.
who wouldn’t even—
Harry was about to open his mouth to protest when Healer Preedan’s words sunk in.
Yet, looking at Narcissa now, he couldn’t help but think she looked almost…impressed.
Harry simply snorted. “What, acting like an actual human being?” He paused. “Also, it’s Harry, remember.”
“Ah,” said Draco, nodding sagely. “So
my fault. I told him to go outside, get a bit of fresh air, relax a bit. Fred was crying so hard, you’d have thought we’d murdered his mum. And I’ve babysat him enough times to be used to it, but Harry’s never really been around kids a lot—how would he, growing up the way he did. And I swear, I had no idea he’d gone anywhere. I thought I was helping, I never expected him to—that he’d—and now—” His voice broke.
So much for ‘don’t blame yourself’. Well, it’d been rather the futile hope from the start.
And now Draco Malfoy was gaping at him like a deer in headlights…while Harry gaped right back.
Yet here they were.
The ensuing wave of relief Harry felt at that moment was so immense and inexplicable he was temporarily floored. However, he quickly recovered and said simply with a grateful smile, “Thanks, Ron. Sounds good. Now
had finally arrived.
He waited patiently for Draco to nod, and when he did, the look on the Slytherin’s face, so full of that same fear, that same brokenness, it settled something for Harry.
He wanted to relish in the feeling of being like this. Being together, being happy. Almoat carefree.
Draco allowed himself a small smile. “You heard me correctly, Potter—thank you. I might just take you up on that offer someday soon.”
It wasn’t Ron who spoke, but Ginny, and despite the mess that was their current relationship, Harry couldn’t have agreed more.
The edges of Yaxley’s shield started to fray, to give out, and Draco seized the opportunity to send a Stunner careening underneath. It hit Yaxley’s left foot, and the man staggered backwards before collapsing, the immobility in his leg rapidly spreading up his body.
Harry’s heart actually missed a beat as a wave of such immense dread crashed over him that his head began to spin.
Draco, who was already across the room again, a Protego of his own making shimmering in front of him, grinned manically. “Fine—heads-up.”
His grin dropped almost immediately.
First and foremost, the blond looked exhausted. And anxious. And very, very tense.
, for Salazar’s sake! “It’s in your best interest to comply to our questions. Death threats are not going to help.”
he felt looking at Harry, above it all. And he said coolly, “Well, we can’t all be the great Harry Potter, now can we.”
Harry snorted and flipped another pancake. “My God, why I put up with you is beyond me. You’re a menace, Malfoy.”
Until Ron, from where he still stood at Harry’s bedside, one arm wrapped protectively around the hunched form of his girlfriend, said, eyes steely, “I’ll do it. Harry, you’re my best mate, but Robards is right. Someone needs to be there to make sure what happened yesterday never happens again.” His gaze lifted to Robards and he repeated, determination hardening his usually so playful features, “I’ll do it.”
“Are you asking whether there’re any more Death Eater-assassins you need to be worried about?” Yaxley paused for a long moment and leaned back in his iron chair, evidently enjoying the tension. “No, not that I know of. But who knows what might happen in the future.”
Finally, Blaise seemed to fully regain his usual blasé attitude. “Please,” he snorted. “This is Harry Potter we’re talking about. As in, the Saviour of the wizarding world himself. For him, they’d find a cure for bloody Avada Kedavra.”
As a matter of fact, Harry noted with a bang of alarm, Nic didn’t look at all happy to see him; gone were the laugh lines and smiles Harry had come to expect on the American’s face, gone and replaced by a harsh, hard sort of stoniness that had Harry’s smile slowly but surely fading.
Pansy simply reached over his shoulder for another fingerful of batter. “Oh, it’ll be fine. By then, the two of you will be thick as thieves. Besides, you can’t deny a little shopping will do wonders for the poor bloke. Maybe a makeover, too, if I’m feeling generous. He’s handsome enough, but who can tell under that rat’s nest?”
Harry may not be Hermione Granger, but he was no fool; had Draco not thrown them both to the ground when Yaxley’s first curse hit, neither of them would be in St. Mungo’s right now. After all, there was no cure for death. But he had, and then he’d jumped up and charged after Yaxley like some bloody Gryffindor, as Harry was sure Draco would say right about now, engaging the dangerous and evidently deranged Death Eater in a duel the likes of which Harry hadn’t seen since the Battle of Hogwarts.
smitten, it’s honestly ridiculous.”
“No offense, of course. Though it’s true.”
Harry pulled a face. So, Malfoy was as exasperating a git as he’d always been. “Oh, sod off. You know that’s not what I meant. What are
Confused, he set the butterknife back on the kitchen counter, absentmindedly wiping the remaining butter off on his piece of bread, and strained his neck to get a glimpse into the living room. What with Hermione, Ron and the rest of his friends having already stopped by on Thursday, plus Pansy Parkinson, he couldn’t think of anyone else who might want to visit him. Draco had grumbled something about how Parkinson might show up again around four to pick them up for what Harry had nicknamed Saturday’s Slytherin Shopping Spree (Draco was, needless to say, not impressed), but, for one, to Harry’s ears that had sounded like a big
All thoughts froze in his mind when he caught sight of it; the name, written in cursive, beautiful letters, etched into the grimy, red skin of Yaxley’s wrist. And the thick, crisscrossing scars cutting straight across it, making the name entirely illegible, the lines puckered and white from age.
But Malfoy immediately shook his silver-blond head and said curtly, “Absolutely not.”
Draco pursed his lips and shot him the type of look Professor McGonagall had always specialised in back at Hogwarts, the sort that positively screamed to the world ‘you are an idiot, kindly remove yourself from my line of sight, or better yet, from the face of the earth’.
Draco immediately bristled, the topic far too close to comfort for his liking. “Redirecting the subject, are we? Frankly, I have no idea why everyone thinks Gryffindors are such ignorant morons—clearly you’re all genius conversationalists.”
Harry would have been perfectly content with simply staying on the couch and cuddling all day, thank you very much.
to look that good, Draco decided, not when
“Yaxley’s escaped, hasn’t he?”
And whatever Blaise saw in his eyes must have been sufficient, for the other man’s lips lifted at the edges, and he gave Draco an approving, perhaps even proud nod. “Good.”
They spent the next half hour putting all the furniture back in its rightful place, passing their time in bouts of both amicable silence and equally amicable bickering. The awkward tension from before quickly dissipated again, for which Harry was eternally grateful, for he wasn’t certain what he’d have done if Draco suddenly stopped talking to him. Being locked in one’s own apartment with a single person as company made you very dependant on said person as far as conversations are concerned.
One, Draco was not, in fact, angry. Not primarily, that is. He looked plenty angry, with his knotted eyebrows and his clenched jaw and his stormy, narrowed eyes. But that wasn’t the main emotion flashing across his face, not by a long shot.
And, just like Draco knew he would, Yaxley only smiled. “You’re looking at this all wrong, I’m afraid.”
But Harry didn’t relent, and soon Draco was kissing back, even before his brain could process the sheer ridiculousness of the whole situation—them, snogging, in some random corridor in St. Mungo’s, where anyone could walk by at any second.
His own twentieth birthday a month before had been far more pleasant than Draco had expected it to be. Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Greg had taken him out for lunch to some brand-new restaurant in Diagon Alley, and the food there had been surprisingly good. What’s more, no one had bothered the group of former Slytherins; there had been no muttered insults, no evil glares, no scathing remarks spoken just loud enough for them to hear. They’d been left entirely alone.
Blaise’s grin didn’t waver. “Okay, fine, so maybe it wasn’t me alone. But I did help. Plus, I made sure no one saw that dreadfully conspicuous little tattoo you’ve got there—and I don’t mean the one on your left forearm.”
Once she’d once again recovered from her laughing frenzy, Pansy wiped at her eyes, careful not to smudge her makeup, then crossed her ankles with the fluid elegance of a born-and-raised pureblood.
Draco couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, could only gape at the Death Eater’s unmoving body, dark eyes wide but blank, empty, now as void of life as they always had been of mercy.
, this was the one way Draco might show him, the one way that didn’t require formulating some great big speech, trying to find a way to express something that was simply too vast for words.
, then he’d likely feel sorry for him, seeing as whatever plans Potter had for his birthday, they’d definitely be disturbed at some point by hungry reporters hoping to get a shot of that horrid soulmark.
“Sure you didn’t. Point is, there’s a reason people keep their soulmarks private. Don’t you remember what I told you? If you’ve accepted your soulmate-bond, then your magical core and that of your soulmate are one. No one in their right mind is going to go around parading the identity of their soulmate like a fool. They’d be shouting out their vulnerabilities to the world.”
you—I couldn’t hate you if I tried.”
They ordered another round, and soon there were a dozen different conversations going on at once, as though the three years since Hogwarts had never happened, as though they were back at school, relaxing after an especially tiresome day of classes. Everyone put in their two cents, even Ginny, who’d stayed unusually quiet that evening, and soon Harry had forgotten all about the soulmark that was sure to appear on his wrist sometime that day. And once he’d forgotten about the thing that had kept him on the edge of his seat all day, glancing at his wrist every other minute, he was genuinely enjoying himself.
Draco laughed, and although it was a far cry from the unrestrained cheer he’d practically radiated the other night at the pub, it was still genuine enough that Harry’s grin broadened even more. “Fine. Let’s just both try to keep the insults to a minimum from now on, that way neither of us will ever have to apologize again. Frankly, it’s degrading, Potter.”
Harry only smiled wider, ignoring the jab, knowing it’d only rile the Slytherin up more. “Fine, if you won’t tell me, I reckon I’ll just have to guess. Knowing you, it’s probably something petty. Is it that Pansy didn’t let you come clothes-shopping with us yesterday? Because if so, I should tell you all you missed were a couple dozen more insults, a handful of intimidatory remarks, and a death-threat or two. Nothing out of the ordinary.” He grinned. “Or is it that I’m cooler than you now?”
Or it was, until Harry started feeling queasy. He couldn’t exactly pinpoint when it had started, but he definitely noticed it when a sudden stab of pain split through his stomach, making him bowl over in pain. Once again, all eyes swivelled to him, but this time there was no eagerness shining in them and instead only worry.
, he thought indignantly, this seemed like a damn good point to do so.
for a long time.
Nic, thankfully, didn’t get angry at Harry for his complete lack of tact. He simply chuckled and took a sip of his water. “Yes, oh indeed.”
. The ministry takes its duties seriously when it comes to protecting the Chosen One from potential murder. We can’t have any strangers sending him odd letters and packages, now can we, what with the
The fact that, even when angry at Draco, Harry would still offer to listen, to give comfort should Draco need it…it made the twisting in his chest worse, somehow, and it was all he could do to keep from crumbling to the floor then and there.
So, all in all, barging planlessly into the room was perhaps not the smartest move.
Harry sent him a glower and motioned for the door. “Better get going then, right? Since you have so much to tell me on the way. Oh, and this had better be good, Draco, I do hope you realise that.”
“Oh, spare me.” And Hermione Granger rolled her eyes.
Blaise pulled a face. “Yeaaahhh, maybe don’t whack him over the head? That doesn’t exactly scream ‘I’m in love with you’, tell you the truth.”
It was an awkward, half-hearted attempt to diffuse the tension, but Draco didn’t smile. The sides of his lips didn’t so much as quirk, and Harry worried momentarily whether they’d had some sort of horrible fight during the last twelve hours that he now couldn’t remember. Christ, he hoped not. If he’d somehow managed to get dumped by the single most beautiful human being he’d ever met just a few days after getting together in the first place…well.
But things were just getting fun.
Draco couldn’t help but snort incredulously as Hermione and Weasley disappeared through the kitchen door, exiting the flat seconds later in a hiss of flame.
He smiled at Nic and asked gently, since Draco obviously wasn’t about to, “What happened on Tuesday?”
Draco awoke with an overwhelming sense of déjà vu.
Then there was that; the fact that Harry Potter and Pansy Parkinson, the two banes of Draco’s existence, had over the course of the past one hour somehow managed to become friends. Alright, maybe ‘friends’ was pushing it, but they were certainly a hell of a lot less hostile towards each other than they’d been before this little outing. Pansy had even pulled Draco aside at one point to tell him with a smirk, quote, ‘I’m starting to see why you like him so much. He’s rather adorable, your boy, at least when you get past the hero-complex and absolute lack of style.’.
When the room had quieted down again to some degree, it was Weasley’s incensed voice that thundered through the room. “You can’t
hold them back from manipulating people to do their bidding.
“Get over here, you tosser!” barked Draco. “I was going to go easy on you, but after that show of heinous diabolicality, you don’t deserve my mercy!”
An especially odd flash passed across the Slytherin’s face, but then it was gone again, and all that remained was an odd tinge of red in Draco’s cheeks. “
none of it is true, yet my own bloody brain keeps trying to convince me otherwise.”
Harry, who was
Except, neither did Draco.
“You weren’t supposed to be here, Harry,” Nic said, blue eyes clouding over with some foreign, unplaceable emotion that had the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck standing on edge.
? Save Harry? I don’t believe it.”
Wand raised, Draco advanced, steps small and measured, eyes never leaving the ever-still glass-covered heap of fabric and limbs and blood, not even for a second. Now that there was no longer a duel in progress, he could clearly hear the alarms shrieking in the shops all around him. Good. Aurors should be arriving any minute now.
Before Harry could even begin to protest, Robards held up a silencing hand and said curtly, “I know you may think yourself fully capable of defending yourself—and, as I said before, you really are one of my best Aurors, Harry—but even the best of the best need help at times. Especially after last night.”
For what it was worth, Yaxley looked horrible. Like he’d recently risen from the dead and hadn’t quite gotten the hang of living yet. His face was sunken, nothing but pale, tattered sandpaper stretched taut across the man’s skull. The dark emptiness of his eyes made them look like two black holes, and his hair, once similar in colour to Draco’s or Lucius’, was now a thicket of knotted, wiry white.
He’d known of course that they existed, that they’d been a part of Draco’s life and, in a way, always would be. But he’d never wasted too much thought on the whole soulmate-issue, both because he didn’t know what to think of it anyway, and because he didn’t want to think anything of it in the first place. He didn’t want to think about it at all.
Noticing Harry’s lack of response, Draco pulled back ever so slightly. The space between them was still practically non-existent, nothing but a few hairbreadths separating their foreheads from each other, the tips of their noses nearly touching. But as Draco’s eyes stared into Harry’s, as they roved over his face, searching for something,
A shudder ran down Draco’s spine as his gaze took in the dark shop windows, overflowing with everything from vials in all shapes and colours to what seemed to be an actual jar of eyeballs. But it was all covered in a thick layer of dust, so much of it Draco could see it even from where he stood outside. The sight was harrowing, if only due to the fact that it looked as though absolutely nothing had changed in the many years since Draco’s first visit as a fearful First Year. That day, Lucius had said nothing more than that they’d be making a quick detour, and Draco had better not embarrass him in front of Mrs. Craigs. And then he’d dragged his eleven-year-old son into a store even most adults would be too afraid to enter.
Even now, three years after the war had ended, Harry had yet to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He didn't know if he ever would.
Any frustration that might've built up inside Draco dissolved into thin air, and he took a step toward the upset Gryffindor, voice soft as he tried again, "Harry—"
“Avada Kedavra!” the man bellowed, and Draco only barely ducked the flash of green, dropping onto the cobbled stone just in time as the curse shattered another shop window behind him. Scowling, he scrambled to his feet as fast as he could and pointed his wand at the man.
“Were you?”
“Hey.” Harry lifted his free hand up to cup his boyfriend’s jaw, forcing him to meet his eyes. The Slytherin’s expression was still fiery, but Harry offered him a small reassuring smile. “Everything’s fine, okay?
he been doing, aside from lurking in front of Draco’s bedroom door like some sort of creep?
But Harry’s mind was elsewhere, mainly on getting to the Ministry as fast as possible, to keep Draco from doing or saying something stupid. Because although that silver fire of his made Harry’s heart beat faster every time, although Harry had half a mind himself to go marching into wherever they were holding Yaxley and obliterate the man with his bare hands for what he’d done, both to Harry and to all the innocents during the war and to
