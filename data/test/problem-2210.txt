Draco bit his lower lip between his teeth and Harry was unable to stop himself looking down at the boy’s lap, noticing his small prick hard against the front of his trousers. “I-I want you, Harry.”
mate, after all. I would protect him with my life, and if we’re lucky, he’ll be with child within the next few months.”
”Like that, do you?” Harry purred.
Harry watched as Arlen helped him to his feet before Draco could object. Harry’s gaze lingered on Arlen’s hand when he platonically pressed it to the small of his back.
His offer to house Draco and his son was purely professional, that was all. He couldn't send the boy home alone, no. That would weigh heavily on his conscious if he couldn't see them and know they were safe.
At least a dog was able to choose it’s mating partner.
He hadn’t seen Harry Potter in over eleven years. After the accident with the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts and winning the war, Harry Potter had disappeared from the public eye completely.
She sighed and held out her hand. “Listen, I have something else I need you to do.”
Draco shook his head, eking out a small smile. “No, but I think my baby is running out of room in there. At night, it feels as if there’s a parade inside of my stomach.”
Harry leaned back, arching a brow. “What is it, Draco? Do you have something to ask? Make it sweet and maybe I’ll consider it.”
Bravery.
Harry reluctantly nodded, rearranging his facial features into one of indifference. “If that’s what you want.”
it so badly. To see Draco’s stomach swollen with their litter, his chest becoming engorged with milk to feed their young.
No more Voldemort.
But he couldn't say that.
Harry rolled his eyes, and cast a Muffliato on the table. He eyed the book in front of Malfoy. ‘What are you studying?’
‘Besides, you could use a vacation. You’re all work-work-work.’ She waved a hand around. ‘And when it’s not work, lately it’s all Potter-Potter-Potter. It’s
“You’re a good teacher. And a good person. I believe that—”
(Really? … Really?)
Hermione smiled sadly. “Me too. But he needed to help George with the shop …” She sighed. “We’ll just have to write him about it.”
Potter pulled the pillow off his head. “I’m sorry,” he said.
Maybe he should’ve tried to thank her and her friends. It’d been a lot of fun dancing along with them.
There you have it—my goal was to finish something over 10K, and I ended up with over 20K 😊
The corners of Draco's mouth lifted, just a fraction. 'Okay, I usually take the right.'
Now they could properly enjoy this.
Draco hummed noncommittally, and caught eye contact with his son across the dancefloor. Scorpius grinned at him, so Draco raised his hand in a little wave to say, “Hi. I see you. I love you.” Scorpius raised an eyebrow, and shifted his gaze pointedly towards Harry. Draco rolled his eyes, and shook his head a fraction—but he couldn’t help but smile.
Fine. “Yes.”
Ron laughed. ‘What now?’
Harry groaned. “Cute?”
‘Well … at least that what Pansy said,’ Harry said. Merlin, he’d made it awkward. ‘And Charlotte. I realise
‘I mean it. Don’t die,’ he said with a stern look, staring straight into Harry’s eyes. Then Malfoy leaned forward, and placed a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek. The kiss made a soft smacking noise, and felt tingly, so much so that it lingered afterwards on his cheek. And Harry felt goosebumps and confusion and excitement all at once.
At the castle, Harry heard wails and screams of ‘NO!’s and ‘HARRY!’s. Then Neville Longbottom confronted Voldemort. Harry peered out from behind his eyelashes to watch. There were so many people. His friends, his teachers, his classmates. Professor Flitwick, Dean, Hermione, Ron … And then he saw Draco, weeping into his hands; Luna Lovegood had her arms around his waist to hold him up.
Harry looked down at the glass in his hand. ‘Ogden’s Old. Want some?’
‘Take off my trousers.’
Draco laughed. 'Don't be daft.' He lingered for a moment. 'Chopping an onion releases a chemical compound defence mechanism into the air, which then stimulates the eyes’ lachrymal glands to produce tears. Fun fact for you.'
“Ellie—” The girl was trying to put her hands on the ghost too, shivering with her attempts.
And Harry shouldn’t feel guilty—it was just Malfoy. Malfoy who was definitely up to something nefarious. And was almost certainly a Death Eater.
“So. Do you want to talk about your miserable love life, then?” Draco asked, pouring some maroon into Harry’s nearly empty cup.
Instead, Draco nodded. ‘Alright.’
'I know …' His heart gave a sudden jolt. 'Wait, I wasn't supposed to tell anyone.' If people found out where Harry was …
But he still needed answers … Maybe—just maybe—he could see Draco in person.
Harry cast a glance at Malfoy, who wouldn’t meet his eyes. Instead, he moved to sit in the empty waiting area.
'I read a lot.' Draco winced and gave a little shrug to his shoulder.
, don’t think we haven’t forgotten what you are,” she hissed in Malfoy’s face.
'Ah, come on.'
“Right, okay. Maybe I like to feel connected beforehand, with … I don’t know, emotional closeness.”
Neville turned the sphere in his hand, eyeing it from all angles. “Fascinating,” he said. “’Children,’ it’d said?”
And, as she’d reminded him, he hardly ever had anxiety attacks or broke down in tears lately. He’d already made great strides. He didn’t sleep all the time anymore, and he was interested in things again—most notably cooking. Lately it’d been his mission to learn to make all the Indian dishes he imagined his relatives (on his dad’s side, that is) used to make. It was … well, fun. And he was sort of good at it, though he hadn’t yet gotten any second opinions.
Draco looked down, and …
Harry turned to him. ‘Don’t you think two people can love each other their whole lives? And be happy together?’
“What?” Draco hadn’t actually read it yet. He snatched the card back, to read it properly, this time.
. I should’ve …' Harry babbled, staring at Malfoy wide-eyed. How could he have been so careless? Of course that would be something difficult for Malfoy, his friend had died that day.
Harry broke away, and swiped at his wet cheeks. 'One last one for you, there. But … Draco, I feel like you went above and beyond. And what I got you was—'
One of those unfamiliar hands brought Harry’s to rest against a chest. A flat chest, covered in soft cotton fabric.
From the Professor’s table, Harry gaze flitted over the birds to the four long student tables outstretched in front of him, and his sight caught on one of his favourite students, Lila. The 2nd year was blond, sharp as a whip, and, Slytherin.
Before long, he was slamming himself down, as Draco's fingernails racked against Harry's thighs. Draco wriggled and moaned, and made little thrusts upwards to meet Harry's movements.
A pit dropped in Harry’s stomach. Just … just the last time had been hard enough. He didn’t want to—
Draco nodded slowly. That did sound nice.
.” Her eyes shot daggers at him.
She laughed. 'Your office is surrounded by glass. I can see you need the pick-me-up.' She set the mug down, and Draco slid it closer to himself with both hands. 'Late night?' she asked with forced-innocence.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco grabbed her arm before she could march over to Potter. “
Dave looked positively amused, with both eyebrows raised. '
real, and the envelope truly proved it was.
Harry nodded, already shucking pillows off the sofa behind him to allow for more room. And then he sat back, bringing his legs up and over to move to lie down.
to think of something—you end up thinking about it.
Harry had friends here though: Dave, Ruben, Dimitri. The DJ bloke from the first night. Surely any of them would be better equipped to comfort Harry if he needed it.
Voldemort set the Sorting Hat aflame atop Neville’s head, and Grawp stormed in, the centaurs stampeded, and chaos ignited amongst the crowd. It was the perfect cover for Harry to pull on his Invisibility cloak.
“You … like my poems?” he asked.
Draco rubbed his face, then dropped his hands to his lap, and looked at Potter. The man had a furrowed brow and was tilting his head to the side, just a little, like Draco was some kind of puzzle he was trying to figure out.
Draco snorted. He was stood right outside Harry’s stall. ‘Can I come in?’
Thank you for reading so far ❤️ feedback is welcome (especially since no one reads this over besides me)
Draco froze involuntarily. Potter had never said his given name before, had he? He couldn’t bring himself to turn around, he debated on whether he could just sprint to the library, and then hide in the stacks.
Harry turned his face towards Malfoy’s cheek. Malfoy turned a fraction too.
Okay. He was definitely overthinking it.
He tilted the note away so that she couldn’t read it. Hermione huffed, but turned back to her textbook.
'What?'
Draco laughed breathily, as if he couldn’t believe Harry would ask something so unimportant. ‘Fine. Very little turbulence. I watched Julie and Julia.’
‘All right.’
to have sex?”
Was he out of questions? Maybe. He didn’t know. Harry looked around the room, remembering that more existed in the world besides Draco, him, and two chairs—one normal wooden chair, the other made out of paper. He turned back to Draco, who was watching him with an open, bare expression. Draco Malfoy was handsome—this was irrefutable fact. He’d always been, Harry had always noticed. Same with the man’s intelligence. Harry knew he’d been second to Hermione, only—and she had superhuman cleverness. What he hadn’t noticed, years ago, was that Draco was a fascinating person. A good person. And so much more than he knew.
‘I couldn’t sleep, and I found myself opening up the journal, re-reading some parts,’ Draco said.
Draco made an amused huff. ‘Yes.’
This night in particular was a good turnout. Dean, Seamus, Hermione, Ron, Neville, Hannah, Luna, Ernie, and Susan had all turned up.
The bloke with the clipboard nodded. “Good morning, sir. Delivery for Mr and Mrs Malfoy?”
They sat, and Hermione looked vaguely concerned—but patient, and oh Merlin did Harry feel like stalling. He fidgeted with the edge of the table cloth, and tried to figure out how he was going to start.
They lay like that for a while. Harry absently rubbed the back of Draco's arm.
Dinner was served just as the sun began to set over the horizon—the sky erupting in soft pinks, yellows and purples as the string quartet played quietly. The food was lovely: a spicy, earthy squash soup; goat cheese and beet salad; seashell pasta that had some form of flower petal on it (Harry was initially a bit sceptical but it tasted really good); stuffed Cornish hens; And, finally, the lightest, most heavenly, chocolate mousse cake. Ginny’d had a whole number of comments on the snobbishness of the food. Harry largely tuned it out—since, well, he enjoyed it, and because he was trying not to think.
'Did he shag you in the clown suit?'
Ron laid his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “I thought we were going to be brothers,” he said petulantly.
“What.” Potter frowned with a furrowed brow. Merlin, he was cute when he was drunk and a bit pouty...
They set everything in on the kitchen island, and Draco walked off to turn on the wireless to a classical music station.
He'd got him a black mug with a picture of Bruce Lee kicking the air above his head. A quote on the mug read in white font: "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."
His eye kept straying to the letter though, making him smile.
need closure with somebody they never even
Ron frowned, but nodded. “I think I get it ... I’d be miserable if I couldn’t come home to Hermione every day.”
He slumped down in the free seat beside Malfoy, who, was decidedly not looking at him, and staring down at his textbook. Harry glanced at him, but all he could see was Malfoy’s shiny hair fanning over the desk, obscuring his face. It was so long …
'Are you angry?' Draco asked.
Harry grinned, and pulled his t-shirt over his head and tossed it aside.
A soft smile formed on Potter’s lips. “That sounds... good.” He laughed a little breathily at his repetition of the word.
Merlin, he didn’t know. Draco worried his bottom lip with his teeth, and thought.
How could Harry be so unrelentingly kind? So very good? Draco’s heart was fit to burst. He reached up to run his fingertips over Harry’s forearm.
Ginny shrugged. ‘I’ve waited a year, and I prefer to know. Once and for all.’
Draco leaned his cheek against the tree, and stared off, unseeing, into the treeline beyond.
“Of course you did,” Harry said, smiling cheekily. He pushed off of Draco, and moved to grab his pants from the floor.
The smile widened, and eyes crinkled in the corners. ‘I’m glad to hear it.’
Draco nodded. ‘She’ll be fine.’
“Fine, fine, thank you. Now, are you off to Gryffindor Tower?”
“I don’t know. Maybe.” But Harry Potter had always hated him. Why had he fooled himself into thinking they may be becoming friends? No … the truth had revealed itself, again. Harry Potter was never meant to be friends with Draco Malfoy.
“Hello.”
‘Hello,’ Draco said, stepping up next to him, eyeing the fish. A yellow and blue striped one swam past Harry’s face.
He washed his hands, and his face a bit, before grabbing his book to go and... walk into the lion’s den, so to speak.
Harry exhaled. “True, yes.”
‘Mum, dad, this is my boyfriend Draco. Yes,
The girls laughed again. Draco was beginning to think he was shattering all of their images of him. Probably detrimentally.
It felt like exposure.
Harry strode over silently, and pulled him off the kid, flipping Malfoy unceremoniously over so his back was against the wall. ‘What the hell, Malfoy?’ Harry meant it, meant for a real answer.
This was... very different.
?) “I’m wounded, Harry,” he said, clutching at his heart.
She stood between his knees and lent down to kiss him. Her fingers went back to undressing him, pushing all the layers off of him—not minding where they ended up.
Harry was glossing through the 4th year entries when he paused around the Yule Ball.
The rapping got louder. Harry groaned again, and slid out of bed, groggily stumbling over to his bedroom window. He felt a bit dizzy, stood up too fast probably.
‘What are you doing here?’ Potter seemed shocked himself—disbelieving, really—along with suspicious and wary. (Naturally.) He frowned and gave Draco a once over.
‘It’s
. The DVD player. Muggle things. ‘This is amazing. Incredible, really. Who would’ve actually thought?’ He was probably talking more to himself than to Malfoy.
“Well you two are chatty, I think I’ll go find Ron.”
The rest of the family spread themselves around the room again, talking quietly amongst themselves.
So, Draco did too. He might've gotten a little drunk.
Next task: figure out how to turn on the telly. He reached back to grab the controller-thing from the bedside table, and studied it carefully.
“What are you doing?”
'Perfect.'
He put on Malfoy’s grey joggers. They smelled faintly like him, and they felt soft on his legs. So much nicer than jeans, really. It’d been a good call.
Harry smiled. ‘I get it. And ... it’s okay.’ He kissed Draco again, a soft peck on the lips. ‘Should we go down to breakfast, then?’
Fuck. Fine.
Dream-Draco was annoying. ‘’M sleeping.’
-a homosexual attempting heterosexual sex
He shook his head, rolling his eyes. But he smirked like he was amused.
He nodded. ‘Take off your pants.’
Draco’s smile dropped, and he swallowed, frozen. Again.
Someone bumped into him as they passed by, nearly causing him to drop his books. He really needed to get out of there. Well … there was no harm in getting a journal, he thought. Better to have it, just in case.
Harry swallowed. He hadn’t prepared for this.
Malfoy climbed off of him to stand up. And right then Harry was definitely sure then that Malfoy was just as turned on as he was. “Fuck,” he uttered.
She smiled softly at him. “Maybe you two need to have a conversation.”
Malfoy reached Harry’s desk, and pulled something out of his robe pocket, placing it in front of him. His long, elegant fingers held the note there for a beat, before he kept on walking.
He could try though … if he really dared to.
With one more sigh, Minerva pushed her tin of biscuits towards him.
‘Seriously? Salazar, Draco. I can’t believe you’re still hung up on Harry Potter after all these years.’ She groaned, throwing her head back. ‘Get over it, he’s gone. He’s on a fucking island in the Mediterranean Sea or whatever. For Circe’s sake.’
'Brilliant,' Harry beamed, seemingly relieved Draco wasn't bothered by this. And of course Draco wasn't—it was Weasley and Granger. They were … well, a huge part of Harry Potter.
Draco twisted, and reached for something on the rack behind himself. He turned back around with a hand full of shampoo, and brought it up to Harry's head. They made eye contact then, and Draco smiled, as he began massaging the shampoo into Harry's wet curls.
It was a mess of angry words, scratched harshly into the parchment. Words like: Death Eater, murderer, unfit to teach, monster ... And it contained threats, like: “you’d better watch where you go outside of Hogwarts, or they may need to find a new Potions Professor”.
He glared half-heartedly at Harry, and reached his other hand out. 'Tea. Please.'
Harry sucked in a breath.
“Same to you both,” Draco said, shooting them a soft smile.
Draco smiled. ‘I could lend you the books.’
grown-up.”
Draco broke away with a sniff and a smile. He ran his hand over Harry’s chest, over his heart.
“But... I thought... Weasley and Granger?”
, he told himself.
‘Mm?’ He settled down, cross-legged onto the mat in front of his hearth.
“You could get both, I s’pose.”
Draco didn't know what to say next, because this almost felt like another confession—and they'd moved passed that. So, he cleared his throat and changed the subject, 'Where are you taking me today?'
Neville shrugged, grinning. ‘Nonetheless, I think you’re being wooed, Muggle-style.’
Malfoy’s pink blush deepened to red. “Would you like to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow?”
“I have, I have told you everything.”
‘What did you use to want to do, for a career, when you were a kid?’ Harry asked, watching Draco’s finger trace the lines on his palm. It tickled, and he twitched.
The class separated into small groups, huddling around various Portkeys that Flitwick produced from a cloth bag. This time Pansy, Harry, and Draco shared one—a toy horse with pink plastic hair.
Harry could only blink back at him.
He'd be completely lost without them.
She rubbed her hand over his shoulder blade, looking thoughtful. “I see. Well, he might’ve just been in a hurry. We should give him the benefit of the doubt, no?”
“Yeah … Hermione thought she might have written them before she died, and it was her dying wish or something to have me know how she felt.”
'Harry darling.' Another kiss, to his cheekbone this time.
With hands shoved in his shorts’ pockets, Potter asked, ‘What have you been up to?’ And he’d asked it rather casually, Draco thought. As if they hadn’t seen each other for a month, at most.
Draco had to be lying to him. There was no other explanation.
home? You don’t want to go there, Harry.”
He looked utterly happy and Draco was unable to stop himself from smiling back.
Although he had remained hopeful that Draco was just being shy about their relationship, his continued silence in regard to Scorpius’ father was something he didn’t want to push him on. When he had asked Harry to leave when he had tried to broach the subject of Scorpius’ father, Harry had reluctantly left.
“N-nothing. Just hormones, Harry.”
His rabbit shook his head, the water inside of the tub sloshing as he shifted, pressing his arse against Harry’s prick under the water. Harry hissed in a breath through his gritted teeth, rubbing his cock between the boy’s slippery cheeks.
His body recoiled with
Draco swallowed thickly. “Oh,” he said dumbly.
Harry stopped in front of the last cage, kneeling until he was on his haunches before the cage. He kept his tail up, not wanting it to brush against the filthy floor.
and when he watched himself cup Draco’s belly with his other hand, he saw something in his eyes that—
I can’t help but wonder if he would have been a different person.”
The barely restrained fury in his tone made Draco quickly leave the drawing room, protectively holding his stomach as he ascended the stairs.
“I had an inkling, but I didn’t want to make any assumptions,” she finally said. “I knew you would tell me the truth about Scorpius’ father when you felt comfortable enough to do so, but I’m disappointed you kept something like this from me, Draco.”
He was drowning.
“Tell me, tell me, sweetheart, or I
While Draco had grown up, his father had made him feel as if he weren't enough. He knew without a doubt that Harry would never make Scorpius feel as if he weren't enough. Harry would be there for Scorpius always, no matter what.
times? Your rudimentary muffling spell was almost laughable. Your mother’s home schooling was seriously lacking, pet.”
Draco shot her a withering look. “You haven’t been using your magic again, have you?”
Draco stared up at him, a furrow between his pale brows. After a moment, he released Harry’s hand and nodded.
“I—,” Draco said, swallowing when his mouth suddenly felt dry, “I won’t stop you from being in Scorpius’ life, Harry.”
Harry’s gaze hardened, a sneer twisting the scarred part of his face into something cruel.
When Blaise snatched Draco’s knitted cap from his head, Harry’s breath caught.
Harry shrugged him off and walked over to his father’s leather wingback chair behind his large desk, sitting down in it. He slouched forward, resting his elbows on his knees and covering his face with both of his hands.
Draco remained silent, his eyes darting from the girl and back to the knife she was holding.
Harry smiled and nodded, wiping Draco’s saliva from his mouth and nose with his fingers.
Draco felt as if all the air had been taken from his lungs. He felt his pup wriggle against his hand, prompting him to speak.
Harry nodded, releasing Draco’s wrist to let his knuckle slide up the boy’s arm in a slow caress.
Harry smirked. “I suppose you’re right about that. I’m just trying to narrow things down, though. I wouldn’t want to leave you and your pup unprotected by not doing my job thoroughly.”
Harry had marked him.
He knew it was wrong to be having these kinds of thoughts about a teenager, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself from having them. When the boy was just inches away from him, trembling and needing reassurance…
The hot feeling traveled to the tips of his ears.
Hermione sat down with Ron, her bag slipping from her listless arm and to the floor by her feet.
, Malfoy. I’m here to do my job and you’re not going to dissuade me from it,
After some vacillation, Harry decided to give a bath with his tongue. It probably wasn’t the best idea due to his inherent nature and predilection for the scent of the rabbit’s fear, but he
Older than fourteen, then.
He wondered if he would ever feel happiness again, or if this was his payment for his father’s wrongdoings. To remain here, at Potter Manor, with its depressing scenery and dreary atmosphere that seemed to cling to everything on the estate.
Draco nodded and closed his eyes as Harry leaned forward and pressed their mouths together. Harry cupped Draco’s cheek, deepening the kiss. When Harry dipped his tongue into his mouth, Draco was helpless not to reciprocate, eagerly sliding his tongue against Harry’s.
“Kiss me, then.”
Truthfully, he didn’t want to know the sex yet. His pup’s rapidly approaching arrival weighed heavily on his mind nowadays and he found himself unable to quell the anxious thoughts that plagued him when he was alone. It was better if he didn’t know the sex yet. He didn’t want to think about it right now.
Did everyone look at him like that when they saw his scars? Did everyone talk to him the way Roland had?
He glanced up in surprise, pulled from his morose thoughts. Roland was looking at him with detached concern, his perfect brow furrowed.
Draco moaned softly, arching his back in a sign for more.
”Now fuck yourself with it,” Harry rasped, his eyes glinting with excitement.
“I-I didn’t ask you to come
Beyond that, they were just acquaintances.
Draco flinched, feeling like the biggest buggering fool of all time.
“Mind your own business, herbivore
His mother supported his interests in the arts and never pushed him to be anything but himself. Without her, his father would surely drag him under and ruin what was left of their reputation and fortune.
Draco’s breath hitched and he went wild. He raised his hips and tried to slam back against Harry, tearing at the sheets with his fingernails.
Scorpius shook his head, his blond hair swaying with the motion. “Wanna play!”
Looking into Harry’s solemn green gaze, Draco knew what he wanted.
“You taste wonderful, little one. Like a desperate whore.”
He had never felt this way before.
With gritted teeth, he sank into the boy’s wet channel.
Draco shrugged, looking up at Harry from under his lashes. “It looks like no one ever goes in that room. Something must have happened to make you never want to look upon his portrait. Was he someone important to you?”
“You can’t hurt her, Harry,
friend.”
Ginny had returned home last week, and Harry had explained to her that they needed to take a break. He had told her that he was confused and unsure about the future. He had told her that he needed some time to think about things.
“I’m waiting, pet.”
Harry knew what he wanted, and he wasn’t going vacillate any longer.
Even if he continued on with life, ignoring Hermione’s letter and the awful things that had happened to him, there would always be a part of him that
Draco looked up, his cheeks warming. “Sorry,” he blurted.
He had assigned the Malfoy case to a capable Auror on his team, wanting to rid himself of reminders of the charming boy and his son.
The indifferent man wasn’t even mated, and Draco could understand why. If Master Potter went about courting as he did conversing, it would be no surprise to him if any sane omega turned tail and ran as quick as they could.
In her living room, stood the Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. Her husband, Ron Weasley, stood next to him. There were two other officials from the Ministry in her living room, their gazes guarded and their expressions somber.
a Death Eater, ‘Mione. Just because she fucked off after the War to play Mummy for sixteen years, doesn’t make her a saint all of the sudden.”
”If you need me during the night, I left the signature for my wand on your wand. Just say my name and it will alert me. Also...”
“Stop it,” Draco whispered, trying to shield his chest further from Harry’s leering gaze.
“Better?” Harry whispered.
Narcissa shifted, confusion now evident in her eyes. “P-pregnant? But he has no mate, he can’t be—“
Arlen sighed, but kept writing. “He’s so different than what the Prophet has portrayed him as in the past. With a moniker like ‘
you, Draco,” Harry taunted, leaning down and sucking one of Draco’s swollen nipples into his mouth.
After entering his bedroom, he went to sit on his bed, his knees feeling weak.
Harry shook his head.
Harry furrowed his brows, his heart rate picking up.
“I’ll get it,” Ginny offered, standing from the table.
Harry silently walked over to where he sat, staring down at him. “What upset you?”
Draco vehemently shook his head, damp strands of his hair sticking to his cheeks and lips. “N-no. You’re a horrible p-person I don’t
He didn’t know how much time had passed, but a rather somber looking house-elf named Kreacher would appear every so often and help Draco relieve himself and try to get him to eat.
The boy whined, backing away from Harry.
“Ronald?” she asked. “Where’s Rose?”
Draco shook his head and glanced behind Potter at the open door to the stall.
Harry began undressing, clumsily pulling off his shirt over his head. “And if I am?” he drawled.
Deep down, he was repressing the overwhelming urge to lurch out of that fucking chair and back to Draco.
He wasn’t as good at prevarication as his mother, and he didn’t have a poker face like his father, and he
Slowly, the boy dropped to his hands and knees, crawling towards him.
“They’re from his birthday party,” Draco said softly, protectively hugging himself. “My Dad kind of went overboard with the balloons at his party.”
”I’m waiting, Draco. Don’t make me help you, because I won’t be gentle.”
It was taking everything in Draco not to lean in and scent the Alpha holding him.
Without another word, Draco turned and left Harry Potter alone in his kitchen.
He cringed inwardly, his words sounding unconvincing even to
He’d never felt more helpless.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, love. Harry makes a very convincing werewolf, doesn’t he?”
“Put your lips around it,” Harry instructed tightly.
Draco glared back up at him, trying to ignore his body’s reaction to the alpha pheromones Potter was pumping into the stale air of the small stall. The light grip Potter had around his throat was almost like a warning, his gloved fingers flexing against the sensitive skin directly beneath his ears.
“So responsive,” Harry murmured, his magic flowing from his palms and suffusing Draco’s stomach tingling warmth.
“Not as valued as your husband. He has his own plaque hanging up in the Auror Department, commendation and picture included.”
He didn’t know if it happened in between his torture of the boy, in the tender moments that he would never allow himself to think about when he was alone.
Harry and he couldn’t
Harry shook his head, straightening in his chair. “I don’t think so. I need to be up for work tomorrow and the last thing I need is a hangover.”
Without speaking, he took out his wand and cast a barrier spell in front of her cell door. He aimed his wand at her manacles, and one by one, he unlocked them.
Being a father had never been at the forefront of his mind and now that he was in his late thirties, it was something he expected he would never take the role of. Maybe one day when they were older, they would broach the topic of possible adoption, but for right now things were perfect the way they were.
Ginny quirked a red brow. “I said, do you want some wine with your pasta?”
Harry had never been with an Omega during their heat.
A carnivore fucking a herbivore, or vice versa, was considered a perversion of nature. It had happened quite often before the War, but now such things were absolutely forbidden. The pups of such couplings did everything to hide who they biologically were. If they were found out, they were treated as outcasts.
”You’re mine now.”
home.
“Sorry, Gin. I actually have to go back to the Ministry shortly. I just came home to change my clothes.”
His voice had grown hoarse from yelling and his eyes were swollen from how much he’d been crying.

and even though he knew it wasn’t good for them, he
He felt excess slick gush out of his pulsating hole around Harry’s pistoning fingers, his channel sucking those thick digits even deeper and earning a low growl from Harry that reverberated around Draco’s cock.
The boy skidded to halt and beamed at him but remained on the other side of the room.
Draco keened, his long ears drooping around his beautiful, flushed face.
you while you’re working in my home.”
“But I don’t see why I have to go.”
Harry let out a low growl, hollowing his cheeks as he harshly sucked.
“Yes!” Scorpius chirped, throwing both of his hands into the air and sending bits of egg and pancake flying.
Draco nodded mutely, the letter in his hand feeling heavy.
Their Alpha mate would have to be around them all times, their pheromones the only thing able to soothe the pregnant Omega and the baby in their womb.
“Azkaban? What on Earth would Harry be doing at Azkaban?” Hermione queried.
Jack stepped aside and opened the door wide, letting aside someone much shorter.
”His eyes...” Harry whispered, leaning closer.
“Why not sweetheart? Dada can make it better for you, make it not so
“Everyone on this estate is under
Harry smiled, his heart aching for the vulnerable Omega before him. “Yes, please. I don’t mind, really. It’s only natural.”
One of Harry’s pointed ears twitched.
He glanced over at his chaperone, Mrs. McGonagall, who had greeted him at the train station to take him to the manor.
Enjoy! 🖤
Harry rolled his eyes and took a drag of his cigarette. “Ron has a big mouth.”
Omega. I can do whatever I want.”
Harry idly wondered what his and Draco’s offspring would look like. Would they resemble Draco, having pale hair and eyes? Or would his mother’s emerald eyes be passed on to his child?
Harry let his hand glide across the air above the plate of food, steam immediately wafting up when he pulled his hand back.
all Draco ever wanted. He wanted them to finally be a family—a proper family. If that meant he had to spill his heavily guarded emotions, he would. He would give in.
treasured at the moment. He felt like a trapped animal, awaiting a most horrible fate that he knew would eventually befall him.
He smiled. “Take me to her.”
”Lily,” Draco repeated. “That is pretty.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s pale hips with both hands and began pistoning his cock in and out of Draco, watching as his angry, reddened cock slid in and out of that tiny, pink hole.
Draco shook his head, leaning into Harry’s touch. “I know you’d never hurt me, Harry—
“Well,” Harry said. “I suppose I could…just for tonight…”
Harry released his wrist, arching a brow. “The photo of when I was a teenager. Why would that upset you?”
Harry scooped him up and Draco reluctantly nuzzled up into his throat, staining Harry’s black button-down with hot tears. Harry allowed it, lowering his head to allow Draco better access to his scent glands.
family for work. Perhaps a family with children. He loved children and one day wanted pups of his own.
of me,” he finished weakly.
Draco froze, not looking up at Harry, who he could feel was boring a hole into the side of his head. “S-stressed? I guess…a little bit, but just because I was worried about the pregnancy.”
let me get up...the baby is uncomfortable.”
dwelling on it.
Draco whimpered and instinctually bared the side of his throat submissively, his Omega instincts on high alert around the clearly angry Alpha.
while he was pregnant.
Draco panted around the glove wedged between his teeth. He felt tears prick his eyes, the tacky feeling of his own slick between his legs belying his tears.
Draco flushed, averting Harry’s gaze. “He’s, um, not involved in our lives at the moment,” he mumbled.
Draco let out a defeated hiccup of frustration, quickly swiping at the tear that slid down his cheek.
Draco smiled up at him and nodded shyly. “Okay, then. Here, Scorpius, Harry wants to hold you for a bit, love.”
objected to the ruling.
Jack Ryker, one of Harry’s lead Aurors, must have assigned him to guard duty for the evening as a way of easing him into Auror work.
Guys, I’m so sorry for the late update. I only write new chapters for this fic when I’m in the right mood (depressed🥴) so I’m sorry again for the wait!
His room was small and bare, containing nothing more than a bed, dresser, and small porcelain wash basin. There was a lone window above his twin bed that overlooked the moors at the back of the manor, but beyond that, nothing but grey.
on track—
Harry always made sure Draco came first, even transferring his magic to their pup after each orgasm.
Before Harry could lick it all up, Draco was hard again, more heated slick oozing from his hole and coating Harry’s pumping fingers.
,” Harry growled. “I don’t want to rush things. If you want to wait, we can wait. I’m not saying
Harry let his thumb brush against the photo, over Draco’s stomach.
Hermione scooted closer to him, placing a hand on his arm.
But then he wouldn’t have had his daughter.
Draco turned around, a bemused expression on his beautiful face.
He would make it through this for his jellybean. If his mother had fought to keep him alive in the womb without his father and survived, Draco would fight for his pup and escape Harry.
Draco dragged his potted fern from its spot on his small balcony. He had set it out so that it could get some indirect sunlight. It had been looking a bit droopy the past few days.
He felt trembling fingers against his tense back.
Draco felt himself unintentionally leaning forward. “Thank you, Harry…”

“Okay!” she chirped and skipped back into their apartment, disappearing down the hall.
”Dada?” his rabbit whispered.
It was—
”Looking better already, sweet one,” Harry rasped, stroking his claws along the rabbit’s spine.
—” Draco fumbled for words, stumbling backward when Harry advanced on him into the stall. His back hit the dividing wall between the stalls, the small area leaving only scant inches between them.
Draco sighed contentedly, his eyes slipping shut.
“Stop, wait—"
to raise me. You had a life with Draco. You were able to watch him grow up, watch him
The low, rough voice made Draco flinch and whip his head around.
scared.
He picked Draco up under his armpits and laid him back on the bed. Then, he hooked his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s bottoms and ripped them off, tossing them to the side.
Draco pulled back, panting. “I-I want you, want to feel our bond. Want to feel you.”
She turned and gave him a wan smile. “How could you ever forgive me, Draco? I don’t deserve forgiveness and neither does he. Our sins are not the same, but I aided in your suffering by not helping you when I could have.”
Harry straightened and walked over, reaching down to pick up Draco’s forgotten hat from the ground. He gently slid his hat back on his head, cupping Draco’s face between his large hands.
Differences be damned.
Harry and Ron sat in Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt’s pompously decorated office.
Trying not to think too much about what he was about to do, Harry sucked his index and middle finger into his mouth, thoroughly wetting them. He pulled them out and let them hover just over one of Draco’s swollen nipples, shaking slightly.
Harry turned and locked the door behind him before turning back to face him.
him to see him?
Harry watched in avid fascination as Narcissa’s expression changed, morphing into horrified realization before hardening into infuriated acceptance. Her blue eyes became drained of all emotion, narrowing to slits.
Ron halted his pacing, a furrow appearing between his light red brows. “Harry, I need you to come with me to the Ministry. We’ve found Narcissa Malfoy. We bloody found her, Harry!”
”So cute,” Harry murmured.
“Like hell, he will,” Harry growled.
Harry’s brows rose, one side of his lips twitching. “No. We did not.”
and even though it seemed insignificant, his clothing choice made that one allowance.
When they had returned home, Harry had made them both lunches, but had noticed Draco’s waning mood. The boy had been slouched over his plate of veggies, a flush coloring his cheeks and nose. His blond fringe had appeared damp with sweat, his ears drooping around his shoulders.
”If only you could see yourself as I do, Draco. Spread open and riding my cock, greedily sucking me in like you can’t get enough.”
Harry smiled back at his best friend, uncomfortable with being untruthful with her. In this, Hermione wouldn’t understand.
Enchanted wall sconces lit their way down the cavernous corridor, the sound of incoherent babbling and ominous groans filtering through the thick cell doors they passed.
Who wanted to appear that
Harry quickly stood, dragging Draco up by his hair. The boy let out a whimper, stumbling as Harry led him over to the bed.
“Here, at least let me carry your bag.” Harry took Draco’s bag, sliding the strap onto his own shoulder. “Can you at least let me make you both something to eat before you go?”
Draco and Scorpius had been staying with him for the past week, coming home to
“Can I scent you at least? Just to get through till the next time I see you...”
Sirius looked away then, to a spot beyond Draco’s earthly vision, lapsing into silence.
, Draco.”
As if sensing his discomfort, Harry leaned down to let his lips brush across Draco’s forehead, murmuring a quick reassurance against his heated skin.
So, he simply existed. He ate his meals, slept, and paced his room.
The girl knocked on the door, actually waiting for approval to enter, unlike how she had barged into
Scorpius slapped one of his tiny hands against Harry’s chest, giggling. “Up!”
His father probably viewed him as a perpetual disappointing thorn in his side.
Draco knew that when he would go into heat, the amount slick his body produced would double and his skin would feel as if were on fire.
His emerald eyes were devoid of all emotion, a cruel smirk turning up his lips.
It was another sacred ritual only reserved for wolves—
“You are nothing but a
He couldn’t mess things up even further for Harry and he wouldn’t embarrass himself by acting like some needy Omega.
”H-Harry, I’m gonna...” he let out a high-pitched moan when Harry’s fingers circled the back of his upper thighs, his fingertips spreading his cleft open almost painfully wide.
Draco swallowed thickly, the edge of his kitchen table digging into his lower back.
A large silicone dildo sat on the bed next to him. It was impossibly big, maybe even bigger than Harry’s.
After a moment’s hesitation, Draco had continued tracing his features: his mouth, his lips, and his hairline. Draco had suddenly noticed a scar on his forehead, hidden beneath his raven hair. It had struck him as odd because the scar was in the exact shape of a lightning bolt.
Harry used
“N-n-no!” Draco attempted to scoot away, but Harry stopped him by grabbing his thigh and dragging him back.
Because soon, there might be someone even more vulnerable than himself relying on him to protect them from Harry Potter.
He let out a frustrated groan, attempting to ward off the intrusive thoughts by biting his tongue to stay focused. He kept reading the notes, narrowing his eyes.
His Omega needed
He would
Narcissa rolled her eyes before shooting him a patient look. “You’re positively smitten, Lucius. Everything Scorpius does, you call it gifted. He toddled into your office last month and floated your quill down and you wouldn’t cease talking about it for three weeks.”
?” he asked in a panicked voice, “are you okay?”
able to get him pregnant? Would he tear away his babe from his breast, keep the baby within arm’s reach as a means to get Draco to do as he wished?
Draco looked like a quintessential Omega.
While he continued ramming into his Omega, he pressed his lips to Draco’s ear.
Harry had arranged a small get together at his home, excited to present Scorpius as his…
He knew that Theodore’s sudden disappearance from their lives was probably confusing for her, but there wasn’t much he could do to reassure her that everything was going to be all right by acting as if everything were normal.
The rabbit let out a small sniffle, wrinkling his pink nose in consternation.
Harry was silent for a moment, his green eyes boring into Draco. “Well, consider yourself lucky, little one.”

“Like I asked before,” Harry whispered, his voice rough, “what’s changed, Draco?”
Harry felt rage like he’d never felt before. The mere thought of some faceless Alpha touching Draco, let alone
One of the nights he was calming Draco from a nightmare, smoothing his blond hair back as he whispered assurances and soothing words. He had never allowed himself to be so open with another person, so
of it all. He wanted to go back, back home where no one forced him to do anything. Back home where he could be himself and there were no collars or ropes.
Luna lay a hand on his arm and squeezed. Thank you, Harry.” She lowered her voice, and said, “Now why don’t you go talk to Draco. I brought him into this room, because he wasn’t talking to anyone out there, and I thought that might be you at the door. You’ll talk to him, won’t you, Harry?”
Well ... it was nice while it lasted.
‘I wanted to …' He winced. ‘Well, I like your YouTube videos.’
Morgan handed him a biro from her pocket, and he added his signature to the page.
Before Draco could stop himself, his white-socked foot was in the mud.
“You should come with me next time, it’s relaxing.”
“I … God I hope so. I hope you can.” She searched the ghosts face, pawing at not-really-there shoulders.
“Right,” Harry said, with a funny smile. “Well. All set, then?”
‘Your girlfriend is intense,’ Harry mused, picking himself up into a sitting position.
Harry shook his head, and smiled a little—still watching the other dancers with a far-away, unfocussed look. ‘I annoyed my friends, talking about you.’
'Yes. It's not weird.'
Draco shook his head, smiling.
He got up, threw on his Invisibility cloak, and set out for the hospital wing.
Malfoy, who didn’t want to kiss him.
‘Sorry,’ Harry breathed out. This all seemed mad, but … it wasn’t Draco’s fault. This was his life, a life very different from Harry’s, that he didn’t really understand. ‘I know I don’t have any idea of what it’s like …'
He padded out of the dorm room, as quietly as he could, and crept down the stairs. A low fire crackled in the common room hearth, but the rest of the room was silent. Empty.
'I do.' And he flicked his tongue out, in the hopes that Draco would meet it with his own. And he did.
Harry nodded, smiling in a way that probably looked real goofy.
A familiar beat started. Draco glanced at Potter because it was Potter’s song—from one of his DJ set videos.
The waiter came with their orders, setting the plates down in front of them. And Harry did not pull his hand away, not even when he looked up to thank the waiter.
She just beamed back at him.
The morning post arrived. Bringing with it the normal sounds of beating wings and packages thumping onto tables.
Harry pulled the bit of white out from under the leaves and set the plant down. It was a scrap of parchment, folded up. He unfolded it quickly and stared at the note incomprehensibly.  He didn’t recognize the elegant, neat handwriting.
Astoria laughed. “I’m not sure Draco will appreciate you calling me by his aunt’s name.”
‘Forgot to mention that, did you? After you let me go off like that.’
‘Who’d have thought, eh? Our boys,
‘Oh, Harry,’ she exhaled, leaning back in her chair. ‘You’ve always been … well, a bit weird about him. So. What’s happened, then?’
Harry managed a smile. “Didn’t miss much, mate. Glad to have you back.”
His feet moved him forward, deeper into the dark hospital wing.
‘Never allowed to have, or enjoy.’
'Hmm. Well if you're sure.'
you.”
The blob stretched out, and took full form. It was … a slug, if he wasn’t mistaken. A slug floating around in the air.
Odd that a person would return a used diary to Flourish and Blotts though ... Harry read the dates more carefully, and the timeline didn't make any sense.  Harry bought the diary before class started … and these dates were this past week. Had someone in Gryffindor started writing in it? He looked around the darkened room, at all the closed curtains around him.
He opened his bedroom window to let in a cool summer breeze, and looked down at the happy Violet on the windowsill. It had done well this year, it had grown, and it still had flowers. Neville had told him that was a good sign of health. He rubbed a thumb over one of its fuzzy leaves, perhaps for luck. Perhaps for courage.
'Good. You?'
“Potter—”
'Harry,' Draco breathed out as he thrust. 'Oh, Harry.'
Draco exchanged a look with Harry—and Harry's expression said ‘good luck’. He turned back to Weasley and nodded, albeit reluctantly. Weasley tilted his head back towards the doors Draco had just walked through. Bit annoying to have to get up immediately after having sat down, but, whatever. Fine. When Harry’s your boyfriend, putting up with his Gryffindors was something that came along with the package, he supposed. And it’d all be worth it.
“Mr Potter! Mr Malfoy! I see that your petty childhood antics continue,” Slughorn said, clicking his tongue and shaking his head. “Do I need to take points from both your houses? Oh! We have a visitor.”
'Harry,' he said carefully, arranging himself to sit up more comfortably. Harry looked back at him like he was expecting him to agree with all the bollocks he'd just been spouting. 'First of all—fuck off with all that. Second of all—last night was very fun. For the most part.' Harry just blinked at him. 'But I'm never drinking again.'
Puffing out his cheeks, he went to click away from the page. Then he thought—why not? He could leave a comment, too.
They shook hands. 'Nice to meet you,' Harry said. 'And just Harry's fine.'
After three videos, Draco looked around him. Everything, save the computer, was still and silent. He was alone. And Pansy was out with Esmeralda …
Malfoy smirked. “Yes.” And took a mouthful himself.
Dimitri and Ruben exchanged a perplexed look.
Harry walked down to breakfast with Hermione and Ron. Once in the Great Hall, he diverted paths, saying, ‘I’ll see you guys in Potions.’
Draco watched with... dread, as Potter’s features twisted up in bafflement.
“Have lunch with me. I’m starving,” Potter said suddenly.
The girls formed a circle with him, and sang/shouted the lyrics at each other. ‘Cry me a river!’
Harry put his cup down, and then fiddled with it. “All right. I guess I’ll just come out and say it,” he began.
”Yes,” he said slowly. “Luckily, I’m here for him.”
Harry stared down at him, indecision flickering over his features.
The small boy couldn't have been older than fourteen. He had longish platinum blond hair, several sweat-dampened strands sticking to his pale cheeks and forehead. His full, pink lips were slightly parted, shallow breaths making his chest rise and fall.

A tall boy to the side of the group chuckled loudly, his attention on his shorter friend that stood next him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco whole, a muscle ticking in his jaw as he seemed to try to process what he had just admitted to him.
The rabbit pressed his nose against Harry’s open palm, nuzzling into it. Harry cupped the boy’s cheek, letting his thumb slide over his cheekbone.
His instincts flared to life, the image of his mate crying making them surge to the surface.
The crescendo of his revenge, the apex that all of his carefully laid plans had been building up to.
When Hermione left through Floo, Harry led Draco upstairs to his room. Once the door was closed behind him, Harry whirled on him.
Harry swiped his thumb against Draco’s nipple, collecting a bead of breast milk. He raised his hand and licked the droplet from his thumb, giving Draco a devilish smile that he could still see even in the darkness of the room.
It was silly of him to have such fantasies. Harry would never be a normal Alpha and it was a waste of time for Draco to even be having such thoughts.
Draco felt warmth suffuse his chest at Harry’s considerate question. “Yes, that’s fine. Thank you, Harry. Not just for dinner, but for taking us in on such short notice like this. I really feel like I’m overreacting.”
The boy sobbed tiredly, still pushing at Harry’s chest with his small hands.
The cruel man intended to rape him—
He tilted his head back. the fact that Harry towered over him grated on his pride.
An enticing smell led him to his kitchen, where he found his girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, in the midst of cooking some elaborate dinner.
She needed to choose, and she didn’t know what would happen as a result.
Before Draco could rebuke Roland for his callous words, Harry tightened his fingers on his wrist in  warning, his grip firm but gentle.
Blearily glancing around, he saw that he was now alone in the bed.
If Draco became pregnant, that would seal his fate.
It was just a waiting game now.
Harry groaned, turned on by the boy’s innocent touch. He never let anyone touch his ears, not even people he’d fucked in the past.
The Alpha within him bayed with feral hunger, wanting to service his Omega in his time of need.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, grabbing Harry’s wrist. “Y-yes, they’re sore. Stop it,
Hermione smiled and reached forward, tucking an errant strand of his hair back.
Harry clenched his jaw, not liking that
Harry released his nipple, a string of saliva still connecting his mouth to the leaking tip. He leaned forward and lapped at Draco’s nipple, collecting his saliva and the excess milk on his tongue.
Harry leaned down and daubed his tongue against one strawberry nipple, shuddering. Draco’s breath hitched, his hands burrowing into Harry’s hair and tugging.
“Listen, there’s a festival going on at Hogsmeade next week for Christmas before Hogwarts goes on winter break. Ron and I are bringing Hugo to visit Rose and enjoy the festival. Ginny wants to go, and I think you should tag along.” She playfully nudged him with her elbow. “It could be fun. You could go outside and actually, you know, breathe
When had she become a
“I’d do it again, Draco. I’d do anything for you…” Harry was already leaning down, his gaze riveted to Draco’s mouth.
They walked down a circular corridor to the right, their footsteps echoing off of the black tiled walls. They entered a cavernous holding area where several gilded cages lined the right side of the wall. The cells were magically reinforced with silencing charms and magic dampeners. The prisoners within the cells could not see out and could not hear any noise outside of the cage that held them.

“Missed you, too, sweetheart,” he murmured, nuzzling his lips against Draco’s nipple. “So much.”
Harry felt…
agreed to do the security detail for him?
In this, they were divided.
Draco swallowed thickly.
“On the contrary, Lucius,” Harry interjected. “Draco is an adult and he’s allowed to make his own decisions. If you must know, I went to check on Draco last night. I was only trying to make sure he was safe. I asked to escort him back here to put my mind at ease. If Draco wishes to divulge more, that’s up to him.”
Scorpius had fallen asleep, so Draco’s swollen, leaking nipple was on full display.
“I’m sorry I don’t have anything to keep Scorpius entertained here. I don’t have many visitors his age that often,” Harry said, casting Draco an apologetic smile.
, leaning down to nuzzle against Draco’s stomach, marking him with his scent.
Draco nodded eagerly. “You know I am. I always do, but I can’t wait that long.”
Harry swallowed thickly, remembering the taste of Draco’s sweet breast milk from the night before. “I’m glad,” he said hoarsely.
Hope you guys enjoyed the reveal. 🖤 Stick around to see how Harry will handle this revelation. 👁👄👁
In a way, Draco was using Harry just as much as he was using him. He needed his Alpha’s magic and pheromones for their pup, and he wasn’t going to risk losing his jellybean by trying to attempt a reckless escape.
then! You can’t keep taking it out on me, Harry!”
Harry shook his head. “Don’t feel silly, Draco. I can understand your fear, especially with having a young pup to care for. Like I said, it will be no trouble at all, and it would make me feel better to know you’re safe.”
With that, Draco left a stoic Harry Potter standing in his living area, slamming the door to his flat behind him as he left for work.
He examined himself even closer in the bathroom mirror, his eyes lingering on the collar encircling his neck.
Harry finished unbuttoning his shirt, the sides gaping open, revealing Draco’s small breasts.
Hermione turned to glare at him. “I’m not downplaying her involvement as a Death Eater during the War
Harry pulled back, going silent for a beat.
A moving photograph of Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt shaking the hand of the Head Healer at St Mungo’s was depicted.
But to leave such a delicate creature and his pup
for him!
Draco let out tiny gasp, his eyes snapping up to connect with Harry’s.
“Well, I guess, as long as you don’t mind...Scorpius can make quite the mess sometimes, I’m warning you,” Draco said softly, offering him a hesitant smile.
Harry shook his head. “Ah, of course. I’m sorry, Draco. It completely slipped my mind. Water, then?”
”I-It hurts,” he whined softly, his hole feeling painfully stretched beyond what he was capable. Even though his slick was easing the penetration, he wanted his
He looked up at Harry from under his lashes, flushing. “Thank you, Harry.”
“Are you sure you want this one, Harry? It looks...sick.”
Harry wanted Draco to tell him what he really meant to him.
He slammed Draco down against the table, his vision briefly blackening around the edges when his skull made harsh impact with the hard surface.
”No...No, Dada. No—
Harry let out a low chuckle. “At least one part of you is happy to have me, little one.”
Harry pinched Draco’s other nipple between his index and middle finger, giving it harsh tug.
Draco’s breath caught.
The ghastly headlines they’d printed in the Daily Prophet had turned his stomach so much that Ron and Hermione had stopped their owl from delivering them.
Draco was beginning to think there was something inherently
, Draco,” Harry said hoarsely, trying to think of the most revolting, vile things he could as Draco began licking his neck.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. Follow me.”
He filled two separate dishes with water and the plant-based kibble, setting them close to the slumbering rabbit in the cage.
Harry—
“Thinking about the night that we met,” Draco murmured.
Narcissa Malfoy sat in one of the armchairs in Jack’s office, Scorpius on her lap.
”Feel better?” Harry asked throatily.
Harry grabbed his wrist and yanked him closer.
“It’s no problem at all, Draco. Try to get some rest while I’m gone and try not worry. Everything will be fine.”
“Yes,” he whispered hoarsely, “you are his father.”
“He doesn’t want me, Hermione. In his eyes, I’m an inadequate Alpha. Not good enough to even be completely honest with.”
Harry wanted Draco to admit his feelings. He wanted Draco to confess how he really felt inside.
Draco was slowly rocking his hips under Harry, his now hard prick pressing against Harry’s stomach.
for not knowing such a simple thing about about his mate.
“I saw it while I was cleaning up.” Harry cleared his throat and set the papers in a neat pile on Draco’s antique coffee table between them. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have looked.”
Was his jellybean
Harry shrugged and began plating the dinner he made for them. “She gets some time off. We don’t really take many holidays. We prefer to keep busy with our careers.”
”Do you want us to kiss, sweetheart? Do you want to kiss Dada while we rut?”
Fuck.
If Draco thought he could win him over with some trite apology after the other night, he had it wrong. He was tired of all of Draco’s prevarication when it came to the subject of Scorpius’ Alpha and his
”Shh,” Harry shushed. “Dada is here. It’s time for bed, sweet one.”
Draco’s mouth gaped. He had never had anyone speak to him so crassly.
on his own now. With his husband missing in action and his daughter still so young, he
Harry chuckled and swung the young girl up into his arms.
”Will you both be coming back to me tonight?”
The boy’s pert nipples were pale pink, just like when he was in his rabbit form. He was thin, his hipbones poking slightly out, as if begging for Harry’s tongue to trace the enticing edges.
Draco picked up the knife with a shaky hand, brandishing it. He pulled himself up on unsteady legs, feeling ridiculously vulnerable standing naked in front of his terrifying Alpha.
“Such a

Harry tapped on one of the bars of the cage, smiling when the little bunny flinched.
Harry didn’t know when that time would
Draco held up the sealed envelope in his hand, tears welling in his eyes. He was so tired of crying, so tired of feeling hopeless, feeling like he couldn’t control
“Scorpius, no, darling,” Draco attempted to pull Harry’s fingers from the pup’s mouth, a bolt of desire hitting him when their fingers touched.
Pansy and Theo exchanged a glance, but remained silent.
Draco abruptly pulled away from Harry’s cock, supporting his stomach with his arm. “Stop it, Harry. I-I can’t take anymore of this.
Whatever the repercussions were for keeping Scorpius from Harry all this time, he would accept them.
Without the boy close to him, he felt unbearably cold.
Harry’s filthy words made Draco come with a shocked whimper, his cum shooting up between them and coating both of their chests with the hot fluid.
“Hello, little one,” Harry said coolly.
,” he spat the word, still feeling jealous of an inanimate object, “use only your lovely fingers.”
Harry crushed his mouth to Draco’s, ignoring his futile attempts to push away from him with his hands. Draco’s tears flavored their kiss, a familiar, sickening arousal flaring to life within him when Harry’s tongue met his.
Harry quickly sat up. “
“T-thank you so much, Arlen,” Draco said softly.
Only mates.
Draco’s breath caught, turning to look up at him. He realized that Harry was…
Harry sucked Draco’s cock into the heat of his mouth, swallowing his small cock all the way to hilt.
One of his best friends, Hermione, had been urging him to finally settle down. She had married his other best friend, Ron, and already had two pups of their own.
“Who will be cross?” Draco asked, trying not to trip over his own feet as the girl dragged him down the long, winding corridors of the manor.

“Harry?”

Harry rolled his eyes and tapped a claw next to him on the bed. ”Come here,

Harry shook away the inane direction of his thoughts, his eyes returning to the Prophet in his hands.

,” Draco mewled, his hard prick tortuously rubbing against Harry’s hard abdomen each time Harry rammed into him.
“You don’t know if he’ll be sorted into Slytherin, Dad,” Draco said flatly, crossing his arms over his chest.
Draco’s admission about never knowing Lucius echoed in his head.
The Alpha inside of him rumbled with satisfaction at the thought.
“Ginny is coming tonight.”
Draco was pregnant with his pup, mated to him, and his body already defiled by him numerous times since they’d met.
He didn’t
”I’m perfectly capable of taking care of my child on my own, Mr. Potter. You needn’t concern yourself with such things. Don’t you have more important things to do besides going on B&E investigations for the Ministry? Every time I open the Prophet, your face is plastered all over it.”
A disheveled Narcissa was depicted beside the article, her almost fully white hair tangled and dark circles beneath her eyes. Harry took a long drag of his cigarette, a satisfied smile curling his lips.
’ now?”
The house-elf, Kreacher, brought him his meals each day and escorted him to the bathroom. He was adamant that Draco eat and bathe regularly. Kreacher had even brought him new clothes.
I hope you enjoyed this update and I hope to update soon. This fic is almost at its end!
, Potter. You have never been more wrong and you will regret what you have done to my son.”
Draco pursed his lips as Blaise pressed his hat back down onto his head, noticing how his fingers lingered against his skin for longer than necessary.
Harry raised a brow.
. Can we go talk somewhere more private?”
Harry gave one brutal thrust, angling his hips to ram against the boy’s prostate. Draco keened with delight and came, spraying hot jets of cum against the sheets beneath him.
“I think I upset him, Harry. I was showing him photos of when we were young back at Hogwarts.”
The moments when Draco would unconsciously seek him out during sleep, or when Harry found himself studying the boy’s lovely features when he was unaware.
Why had he

He smiled.
The cobbled street was bustling with young witches and wizards and their families, creating a cacophony of excited chatter and sporadic peals of laughter as they passed storefronts and game booths.
Nothing more.
He shouldn’t have
Calling out to Harry.
Draco shifted on the bed, the rope tethering his hands together digging into his skin with the movement.
Enjoy!😏
“All I’ve ever wanted,” Harry whispered with conviction.
Strong fingers gripped his jaw, pressing him back. His eyes snapped open, meeting Harry’s burning gaze.
Harry held him closer, his eyes softening. “I miss him. I miss you

Harry whirled to face him, his expression darkening. “It’s so bloody easy for you, isn’t it?”
What did Harry have in mind for him? Would he

“Good,” he hissed, “because I would
All Draco saw of the man was his broad-shouldered back and a gray, wiry tail hanging from the back his dark slacks before he disappeared from view.
Draco pulled on the loosest jumper he had available from the pile of clothes Harry had bought for him. It was dark green, a sharp contrast to his pale complexion. Underneath the jumper, he wore a black button-down. His blond hair had grown longer, some pale strands having escaped from his half-knot and hanging in front of his eyes.
Their combined pheromones were drenching the air around them, muddling his brain and adding to his already dizzying state of arousal.
Draco stepped closer, placing one of his shaking hands on Harry’s chest. “I want
”I don’t belong to anyone!” Draco glanced around and grabbed a candle holder from the windowsill. “L-let me go!”
The boy was
When Draco was wrung out, Harry pulled his fingers and mouth away, a smug smile on his lips.
He probably thought it was
“Dada...
There was no pleasure in it, only pain.
Draco’s scent seemed to linger in the air around him, making saliva pool in Harry’s mouth.
He would wait until Harry was asleep. It seemed like the only time his Alpha’s guard was down. If he could just make it down the stairs, he could use his long-dormant magic, he could—
A carnivore cleaning an herbivore with his own tongue?
Draco was writhing and keening beneath him, his fingers buried in Harry’s hair, holding his head to his chest as he suckled.
“Okay,” Draco said hoarsely, trying to get his own feelings under control and not outwardly show how much Harry’s refusal stung him.
Narcissa stared at him for several moments before raising his wand in her hand.
“That’s fine. It doesn’t have to be consensual, you know. Your heat will be upon you soon, and I think it’s
He wanted to
Harry stared down at him, his gaze speculative. His dark hair was mussed and Draco wondered if he had Apparated to the restaurant.
Draco looked up at him through wet lashes, his gray eyes shining, and pink lips stretched over his cock. His breasts were now pinkened from Harry’s kneading and sucking, milk droplets still clinging to his irritated nipples.
Roland laughed, and it was as perfect as the rest of him.
“You never got to eat your lunch, Harry,” Draco whispered hoarsely.
It wasn’t enough.
How was it that Harry always knew the right thing to say? He wished he had that ability. He wished he wasn’t so scared.
Juni made a small noise, pointing to her Cornish Pixie doll that had fallen to the floor sometime during dinner. It was a hideous thing, but Theo had brought it home for her one day from Diagon Alley and she had loved it to pieces since.
something so instinctually sacred and intensely erotic to him—
, to knot the small rabbit and fill him with his seed. He wanted to breed the boy, fill him with his litter of pups.
, his heart beating wildly against his rib cage.
Harry knew he needed to regain control of himself, but it was almost impossible when Draco was wantonly rubbing against him, his slick wetting the crotch of Harry’s trousers and his aching, trapped cock.
“W-what are you making us?” Draco blurted, trying not to furiously blush.
“I’ll go.”
If anyone would be able to tell that something was amiss with Harry, it would be Hermione. The brilliant witch had a penchant for figuring out unsolvable puzzles, so Harry would have to put on the best performance of his life.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh. “It doesn’t matter. He doesn’t want to talk to me, so there’s no use in dwelling on it.”
Draco shifted in his chair, unsure how to respond to Harry’s sudden apology.
“Well, well,” Harry said smugly, “such a lovely sight to greet me.”
”Yeah...when you helped me through my heat before,” he whispered, his words slurring.
When his eyes flicked up to meet Draco’s, he couldn’t stop a sharp inhale.
comfortable.
If he wanted to fix himself, he first had to admit that he needed help.
Harry opened his eyes, letting Draco’s fingers slide out of his heated mouth, his fingers now coated in Harry’s saliva.
Harry grimaced.
It was small and pure white, it’s fur almost silver in color. It trembled under the light of Harry’s wand.
“Pisa.”
Harry didn’t get a response straight away, and he worried he’d said something wrong. He’d never been very good at advice, really. Maybe he should’ve asked Hermione first about what she’d say to someone in that position. It was several minutes before a response showed up.
Draco blinked a bit. 'Ah, yes. Forgot about me.' He then pulled his nightshirt up over his head, and flung it aside, then he leant back on the pillow and looked at Harry. The blanket had lowered, revealing an expanse of chest, and half a pink nipple.
'No one drank from it yet, I spilled it on myself and the floor.'
“Mother cried, father yelled,” Draco said, waving his fork around, and grimacing. “I told them a couple weeks ago.”
He'd …
love him? Or had he just wanted Harry to know that he
He looked up to find Morgan looking down at him with an uncharacteristic fondness. Normally she was a bit exasperated with him.
‘If you’re offering.’ Harry grinned.
Merlin, was Draco ever lovely, smiling at him like that. He wasn’t used to it. Not yet.
That nearly crushed him, but Harry had to persevere. ‘You can and you will,’ he said firmly, miserably. ‘
'I … see.'
Her head disappeared from the fire, and then, the fire went emerald green and whole of her popped out of it.
A slow smile formed on Harry's mouth. 'Works perfectly.' The smile turned to a grin, a grin he tried to bite back. 'Brilliantly.'
The air was quite nice and fresh, Draco had to admit. After being stuck inside for one day, it was good to stretch his legs and admire the scenery one more time before they had to go. Not that being stuck inside was bad, of course. It'd involved snogging with Harry, amongst other things. But... outside was nice too. They could still snog outside, he supposed.
Harry swallowed.
They left the church, and continued on their way, leisurely strolling the old streets.
The air felt tense.
‘Oh! Nice flower you got there, Harry,’ said Hagrid from Harry’s other side.
Harry had considered getting back with Ginny after the war; it
Harry took Draco’s head in his hands, and tilted Draco’s face towards him. He looked pretty confident about it all. “It doesn’t need to be complicated.”
Draco’s body was quivering, shaking like a leaf. It was getting wet in Harry’s hair, he realised: Draco was still crying.
Harry did. And he wrapped his legs loosely around Malfoy’s waist.
Harry tossed a glance at him, smiling. Then he paused, really looking at Draco. 'You all right?'
—crush. Something she shouldn’t have been able to discover, but Pansy was too perceptive for her own good. For his own good. And she’d thought she was doing Draco a
Someone straddled up next to him, unzipping their flies, right at the urinal next to him when there were two others open.
Draco frowned at him. Then he rubbed at his eyes with the hand that wasn't holding his tea. 'Fine.'
Harry smiled. How could he properly describe Draco Malfoy? ‘You’re so smart, and witty, and nice to talk to …’ He thought of the day before, thought of their easy conversation, thought of Draco comforting him as he cried, thought of him holding his hand. ‘And so
'For work.'
‘So I wanted to tell you that. Okay?’
'What?'
“Yeah, yeah I think so. Takes a little time, I suppose.” The warming charm was fading, Harry wrapped his arms around himself.
Harry froze. “Ah. Nothing.”
“Right, um, yeah.” Fuck. Should he ... should they ... ?
She liked to remind him with little hints from time to time that he couldn’t trust Malfoy (‘Remember when Malfoy dressed as a Dementor to frighten you?’), and Harry could admit to himself that there was a chance, a small chance that she was right, that Malfoy was still dangerous. But all he had to do was remember that nod, that little smile, or Malfoy crying on the bed, or his foot against Harry’s leg, and those doubts got blurry.
Draco needed to see him and tell him that he wasn’t
Shaking off his now drenched hair once he entered the threshold to the stables, he uttered a weak, “Hello?”
The skin around his wrists was now irritated and hurting, but he’d been given no reprieve from them even after he’d begged Kreacher to loosen the knots.
“You don’t have to explain anything to me, Draco. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest. You can nurse him here, if you like. I promise, I don’t mind.”
If he was ever going to get on with his life, he had to first get over his thoughts of Draco.
Pansy, one of the servants, was standing over him with her hands on her hips, her lips twisted into a disapproving frown. Her long hair was pulled back under her mobcap, her dark eyes narrowed suspiciously.
Draco flushed, regretting his childish words.
Eventually, he would be voted out of his position and it was only a matter of time.
”Charming,” Harry said flatly, his ire only growing.
“H-Harry, please,” he softly begged.
But then, he was—
Draco looked up at him from under his lashes as the Healer was distracted, sorting through his bag of medical supplies.
how much I need you through the bond!”
Me looking at myself in the mirror after I write a new chapter for this fic:
“Who is Scorpius’ father, Draco? Why won’t you tell me? Don’t you trust me?”
“I joined because I want a family of my own one day. Having experience with providing my magic and pheromones will come in handy when I finally meet my true mate.”
Draco's breath hitched.
And he couldn’t.
Draco nodded, absentmindedly rocking Scorpius in his arms. “He put them in place years ago. I don’t know why anyone would go through all that time and effort to get in and not take anything. It doesn’t make sense.”
The ride to Potter Manor had been long and tiring. He had fallen asleep somewhere along the way and by the time he had awoken, they had arrived.
A tendril of...
It didn’t.
“You also look as if you haven’t shaved in quite some time. You’re beginning to resemble more animal than man.”
Harry slowly turned his head, undiluted malice swimming in the green depths of his eyes. He went absolutely still, his mouth a harsh line. His mussed dark hair was slightly damp now, his stubbled jaw clenched.
”We’ll be waiting for you.”
Draco flushed and vehemently shook his head. “
Harry.
Tears spilled down Draco’s cheeks, sharp pains lancing his lower stomach in excruciating waves.
He’d never known longing like this,
But he
Draco’s mother and father were seated on his father’s terrace in spindly wrought-iron chairs. Scorpius was being held by his father and his mother was staring at them both with undisguised love.
He’d never been more disgusted with himself.
“Draco?”
“I’m telling you, Harry, when you see them, you’ll want one for yourself.”
Harry was on his knees before him, beseeching him with his eyes to
Draco quickly turned and skittered towards the kitchen.
“I understand,
Draco whined, pressing the upper half of his body against the floor. The stance was entirely submissive, his instincts kicking in as he leisurely fucked his rabbit.
Harry smirked and carried two plates with silverware to the table and set them down before returning back to the counter.  “No plans of marriage as of right now. Is it all right if I cut up Scorpius’ food for him?”
“Pregnant,” Harry interjected. “By
He buried his fingers into Harry’s thick hair, attempting to pull him away.
A glaring red handprint now adorned the side of Harry’s tan cheek.
Draco. He liked his cute pup. He wanted to be with them and take care of them. He wanted to be a part of their lives.
Scorpius let out whine, reaching for Draco. Harry lifted the pup and handed him to his mum, watching as Scorpius began nuzzling against Draco’s covered chest.
Enjoy! 🖤🖤🖤
Harry sat in his office at the Ministry, staring blankly at the unreviewed case files in front of him. When he heard his name, he glanced up.
?” his mother asked, casting Draco a confused look.
The sound of Draco’s parents’ voices drifted in from the terrace, making him cast Harry a beseeching look. Harry wordlessly took Draco’s hand into his own and lifted it to his lips, pressing a chaste kiss to the back of it.
Harry halted in the middle of the corridor, inwardly chastising himself.
“I don’t know what wiles you’re referring to,” Draco said, but it came out breathier than he intended.
Draco stood and stumbled backwards, clutching his shirt closed with a shaky hand.
Draco gaped and Scorpius clapped his hands together, giggling loudly as everyone fell silent.
Draco stood and gave Roland one last indulgent half-smile before practically sprinting to the restroom.
The sight made Harry’s thrusts falter, the taste and smell of his rabbit’s blood awakening something...
The hope he still held for Harry was nothing more than dregs now, like the remnants of the tea leaves at the bottom of his cup.
Anger was emanating from his Alpha in suffocating waves, making his inner Omega want to whine and present his throat in apology.
Harry lowered his head until they were nose-to-nose. “Maybe if you’re sweet, I’ll let you suck my cock in apology,” he whispered.
“Didn’t mean to frighten you, little one,” he said, walking over to the mare and giving her neck a firm pat. “She’s one of our gentler ones. Likes to be petted, unlike the master’s stallion.”
Harry tensed, excitement thrumming in his veins. “Go on, Draco. I won’t try to stop you.”
But surprisingly enough, Draco
Harry examined it closely with mock concern. “Hmm. It looks pretty severe, dove. Perhaps we should operate?”
Harry pulled him closer until Draco was almost in his lap, the boy’s smaller thigh pressed flush against his. He lowered his head, pressing his nose into Draco’s soft hair and inhaling.
He could remember…
Would it be as sweet as his scent?
Harry cleared his throat and sat up straighter as he readjusted Scorpius on his chest, confidence seeming to come off him in waves.
Harry pulled back. ”Do you penetrate yourself, Draco? During your heat?”
Harry followed Draco through the manor and up the stairs, his looming presence at his back the whole way to their pup’s nursery. He was reluctant to finally be forthcoming with Harry, but he knew he owed it to him to be honest.
“I trust you’ll know how to behave when he does come to visit, pet. Do not forget about your pathetic mother, rotting away in Azkaban. If that’s not enough to convince you of good behavior, think about the innocent life that you may be carrying inside of you at this very moment. Without your Alpha around, your unborn child will suffer.
Harry cut off his rambling by brushing past him. He walked over to them and stopped just in front of where they sat. “Hello again, Narcissa. It’s nice to see you.” His gaze slid to Lucius and gave him a curt nod. “Hello, Lucius,” he greeted, lacking any warmth at all.
Harry’s pheromones were familiar, heady and potent. Draco’s body craved the magic and pheromones only an Alpha could provide for his pregnancy, but it couldn’t be
The feline witch arched an inquisitive brow, her pointed ears twitching irritably “Well, he can go help Pansy in the kitchen. He doesn’t need to speak to help with the food.”
He dropped his cigarette to the snow and stepped on it, digging his heel in with more force than necessary to put it out. Muttering a charm to make the cigarette disappear, he made his way across the street.
He looked up, his eyes connecting with Harry’s.
Omega…
The word echoed throughout Hermione’s frazzled mind.
”Of course, sir. I apologize. It won’t happen again.”
He let go of his prick and pressed his trembling fingers lower, until they rested against his wet hole. He let his middle finger sink into his hole, his slick easing the penetration. He bit down harder on his lip, trying to reign in a moan. He added a second finger, spearing himself. When he began pumping them in and out of his slickened hole, he couldn’t hold back a tiny whimper that escaped him.
to tell you. Things just happened so fast and I didn’t want to get in the way of your life. I decided when he was born that I could do it on my own, but then you came to us in the garden that day and…”
Draco reluctantly nodded. “Okay.”
Draco peeked around his dada’s shoulder, seeing that the strange carnivores had already lost interest in him and were uncorking a bottle of wine. He pulled back to look up into his dada’s eyes, letting out a soft whine.
tickling him through the bond, suffusing his chest with calming warmth and unrepentant desire.
Even though his body was sated, Draco instinctually knew the ritual wasn’t complete.
Arlen studied him and Draco could feel his ears heat.
When he pressed his open mouth to Draco’s leaking hole, he couldn’t hold back a moan. He tasted just like he remembered, sweet with an afterbite of something uniquely
He sighed tiredly.
Draco had stayed in his room most of the time, feeling overly tired. He slept on and off during the day, only waking when Kreacher would get him up to eat. He knew it was because of his pup sapping his energy, but he didn’t mind.
The boy’s breath hitched. He rested one of his feet against Harry’s thigh, dangerously close to his covered erection. It throbbed beneath his trousers, hot and aching.
What the fuck did Draco want with him
He didn’t miss those horrid days of hiding out, trying to remain unseen from the world.
And he knew his daughter’s name!
His raven hair was in fetching disarray, framing his roguishly handsome features. His green eyes were narrowed, a smirk curling his full lips.
Hermione went quiet, staring at the envelope in her hands. A few tense minutes passed before she looked up and nodded resolutely.
Draco let loose a high-pitched whine, his body going pliant under his Alpha’s claiming bite.
The absence of Draco’s Alpha seemed almost egregious to Harry and he wondered if Draco even
“Feel good? Do you think your
,” the boy said shakily, spreading his legs even further apart.
Harry eyes became shuttered of all emotion, giving Draco that cruel smirk he
With the letter on the way to his mother, his plans shifted to escape.
His breasts were crushed against Harry’s chest, his sensitive nipples abraded by his shirt. Though his milk supply was low now, he felt himself leak due to the pressure.
Draco stared dazedly up at the ceiling as Harry mouthed at his neck. The plea was on the tip of his tongue, but he was able to tamp it down.
The rabbit would let out high-pitched whines, begging to be taken out. Harry would always eventually give in, taking the rabbit to sleep with him in his bed.
“I love him, Mum,” he said with surety. “He’s my mate and our alpha, and I don’t want to be with anyone else.”
Scorpius was wriggling between them, still trying to escape Draco’s arms. “Mum!” he shouted.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, Harry’s touch sending electric tingles over his breast. His prick was already hard, the tip pressing against the rough fabric of Harry’s trousers. “I-It’s just colostrum, Arlen said it’s perfectly normal—”
. Almost took my sodding finger off once. No one wants him, probably will sell him off to be sold at the meat market,” Octavius grumbled.
Harry walked over to him, stopping just in front of him. “And if I hadn’t come to you, that day in the garden, you would have gone on with your life without telling me about my son. You would have gone on without
His own memories assailed him like serrated teeth, catching on the unraveling seams of his mind and tearing them asunder with unrepentant brutality.
The knife wobbled in his trembling hands and Draco screamed in frustration.
Draco was babbling incoherently beneath him, a string of unintelligible nonsense that had Harry licking at his nape, his teeth scraping the boy’s
Draco moaned when he felt a trickle of milk leak from his nipple, blotting the front of his borrowed shirt.
Suddenly, he felt so very young and out of place at the table. He wanted to fit in with Harry’s friends and be as accepted as Ginny obviously was in their family.
Draco shook his head, reaching up with one hand and digging his nails into Harry’s arm. “I don’t care. I don’t want you anywhere near us!”
The fact that he was allowing an
Narcissa cast him a look of disbelief. “You’re aiding in my escape? Why would you—“
What would the Prophet and Witch Weekly say if they found about them? Would it tarnish Harry’s image as a respected Auror of the Ministry? What if they found out the truth about
and he felt like the most horrible person in the world.
!” Rose shouted in mock horror, trying to wriggle from Harry’s arms.
Before he could think better of it, Draco pushed to his tiptoes, a soft whimper escaping his parted lips. Harry closed the distance between them, pressing his mouth to his with a low groan. Heat unfurled low in his belly, ratcheting up several degrees when Harry’s tongue met his.
He stormed out of the bedroom, taking the stairs two at a time. He didn’t care if he was half-naked, all he felt was…
Harry’s hand shot out, grabbing Draco’s wrist and tugging him closer. “The least you could do is look me in my eyes while you tell me of your deception, Draco. Don’t I at least deserve that?”
The boy’s tantalizing scent seemed to taunt him, making his skin feel too tight again.
While the guards of Azkaban had changed, the conditions hadn’t improved that much.
As soon as Draco lifted up the hem of his jumper past his nipple, Scorpius latched on.
Like a gut punch, the memory of Draco’s words slammed into him, seeming to mock him.
“Please?” Harry asked, his voice low and thick with things Draco didn’t want to put a name to at that moment.
Harry scoffed. “She’s
He let out a growl and shot up from his chair, tossing the now broken pen to the side.
”Miss Hermione is here to see Master Harry,” Kreacher announced.
”Good morning, little one,” Harry said, grinning.
Arlen chuckled. “Yes, that’s one way of doing it.” Arlen shifted, turning his attention to Harry. “Mr. Potter, you should maintain physical contact with your Omega, especially this early in the pregnancy. Draco needs your support, and your pup needs your magic. It’s absolutely vital to a healthy magical pregnancy.”
He never revealed anything private about himself and Draco was still unsure of what exactly he wanted from him.
Draco lowered the letter, his heartbeat quickening. A cold sweat broke out over his skin, his fingers trembling around the letter.
been worried about being pregnant.
because you can’t get over the past. Maybe my family did hurt you, but I wasn’t even
It was hard to repress his instincts, seeing his Omega around another Alpha. Even though he knew Draco only desired him, their bond was still new, and Harry wouldn’t be able to calm his inner Alpha until he was able to claim Draco again.
Harry cut his gaze away, gritting his teeth.
Draco pulled down his jumper, tears pricking his eyes.
“Auror Potter! Um, w-what are you doing here?”
Though their bond connected them still, Draco wanted their hearts to connect them as well.
He smiled, showcasing yellowed teeth. He wore a rather beaten looking top hat, dark, greasy tufts of hair sticking out of the sides. His slitted yellow eyes denoted his species—lizard.
The flashback chapter will be after the next chapter, I promise. I’m building up to it, guys! I promise I have a plan. 😌
“All done.”
Draco yearned for sunshine and warmth, something the moors, unfortunately, lacked.
It made him want to sob with gratefulness. It made him want to scream in anger.
Despite all of that, Harry found himself coming to
It was something he had to do.
He closed the rabbit’s cage door and left, wondering what he had exactly gotten himself into by obtaining ownership of the rabbit.
me. I can’t stand it anymore—”
In a darkened corner of the cell, Narcissa sat. She was curled up, her thin wrists and ankles magically manacled. Her hair was fully white now, snarled and dirty. Her threadbare uniform hung on her now gaunt frame, her skin ashen. Slowly, she lifted her head up from her bent knees, her blue eyes cold and empty.
Harry cleared his throat, awkwardly shifting on his feet. “Please, have a seat.”
He risked a look in the mirror above his dresser and grimaced.
The rabbit had let out one of his breathy sighs, nuzzling next to Harry’s bare chest and closing his eyes.
Harry hungrily raked his gaze over him, his pupils dilating until his eyes appeared almost fully black.
Harry pulled back, arching a brow at his Omega’s sudden need. “We can’t, Draco. Someone might come in if we made love here.”
If Draco wanted to continue to nurse, it was
She was an older woman and a beta. Her grey hair was pulled back in a severe bun, giving her an almost feline-like appearance.  She had sharp dark eyes and thin lips that seemed to be set in a permanent scowl.
Draco inhaled sharply, aching to be filled.
“Mum?” Draco asked curiously.
“She likes to be scratched behind the ears.”
The disdain shown to herbivores had never appealed to Harry. To him, as a predator, they were just weaker creatures. Nothing more, nothing less.
The door shut behind him, locking him in.
Harry stiffened his tongue and slid it into Draco’s hole, loving how it made his Omega keen and cry out as he lazily explored with his tongue.
“Oh, let him live a little, Harry,” Hermione chided, softly patting Scorpius on the back. “I remember what it’s like to have a young one. You don’t get to let loose very often.”
Harry smirked. “You can have all the daddy time you want with me later tonight, sweetheart.”
Harry’s body was always ready for Draco, spurred on by his scent and needy, pleading whimpers that seemed to resound throughout the entire house and Harry’s chaotic mind.
Harry knew the euphoric effects of the potion would dull the boy’s sensitivity and give him a temporary feeling of faux calmness when he awoke. This bode well for Harry. It would be easier to lay out the rules and the slow torment he had planned for Narcissa’s son if Draco felt a false sense of security and wouldn’t go into hysterics right away.
“I guess so. They’re still investigating the circumstances of Theo’s disappearance and they can’t rule out foul play. It’s just a precaution.”
!” Draco cried out, his toes curling while he writhed atop the table.
Even if the vault was gone and Grimmauld Place was demolished, the memories would remain.
,” Draco spat. “The photo of you with the owl on your arm, okay? Will you please leave me alone now?”
“I see.”
If he was going to survive Harry, he needed to be smart about things going forward.
His mother’s regal brows furrowed. “I thought you had already weaned him, Draco. You should put a stop to breastfeeding since he’s now eating solids regularly.”
to us right now. With your…emotional connections to Draco’s family, I’m not sure it would be wise to release the boy into your care.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “I’m here to check on Draco Malfoy. Have you seen him?”
Maybe he
It was that night all over again, when he was forced to make a decision due to the betrayal of his own body.
“Still what?” he croaked.
Unable to help himself, he snapped his hips upwards. Draco choked and whined weakly, but then eagerly sucked Harry’s cock deeper into his throat in response.
Harry bobbed his head up and down on Draco’s prick, easily taking him to the hilt. With no warning, he sunk two of his thick fingers into Draco’s leaking hole, scissoring them apart, stretching him painfully wide.
He had missed him so much the past few months. Being away from him had
decision, not that pompous prat’s.
“You taste so good, Draco. It’ll never be enough,” he whispered, sounding drugged. “
Draco keened, relishing in the feeling of Harry’s thick cock impaling him completely.
A female, the same species as him, was standing in front of the large kitchen island, chopping up slices of raw meat on a cutting board. Her ears and tail were pitch black, her pale skin a sharp contrast to her long sable hair. Her left ear bore a scarred over tear. It looked as if someone had bitten into it with serrated teeth.
Harry lowered his head, giving the boy’s prick a long lick.
Draco hands shook, hot tears finally escaping his eyes and sliding down his cheeks. “You’re a monster,” he whispered, protectively hugging his own stomach.
Harry looked down, noticing that he had snapped his pen in half in his hand, dark ink dripping onto his fingers and desk.
pup without me in the room.”
Since it was a Muggle restaurant, he didn’t want to clean it up with magic.
Blaise was still mad at him about completely ditching him at the festival at Hogsmeade. He had blamed his sudden departure on not feeling well, but it was a better excuse than the truth.
Harry had tensed but allowed it.

”Okay. We’ll talk about it tomorrow, naughty boy.”
He did not
“Let’s go home, love. You look tired.”
Harry chuckled, taking a sip of his drink. “Careful, Ron. I think she might try to seduce you tonight.”
Draco screwed his eyes shut, his tongue tasting the sharp tang of Potter’s leather riding glove.
The Department of Mysteries held a great deal of things unknown even to Harry.
Draco held Scorpius tighter to his chest, not able to meet Harry’s eyes.
Draco turned away from him, his chest heaving with his silent cries.
He suddenly wanted to barrage Hermione with questions, but held back.
Harry’s eyes widened slightly before they softened. “I love you, too, Draco. I’d hold you if I could, but I don’t think Scorp will be happy if I move him right now.”
,” he cried, burrowing into her chest, his ears tucked beneath her chin.
Draco’s vision was blurred from his tears, a shuddering breath escaping his parted lips. He felt as if this was an ultimatum, a confession coaxed despite his desire to remain independent.

Nothing but a hole waiting to be filled, yearning to be
Harry spent the rest of the day trying to coax the boy into talking to him.
Draco stared at Harry’s broad back, swallowing thickly.
Draco nodded, averting his gaze. “I just…I’m not feeling that great. Will you hold me and transfer your magic?
“How can that be, Ronald?” Hermione glared up at him, denial surging forth within in her. “I went to visit Draco regularly. He never seemed like…he was being held
The man behind him snorted and released Draco, shoving him forward.
He had to do it, though.

Harry pulled his hand away, going silent.

Arlen stopped writing and glanced up. “Of course, Draco.”
Scorpius giggled wildly and pressed his nose against Harry’s scent gland, shyly scenting him. He had been doing it more and more as he grew more comfortable around Harry during their continued visits.
He was a friend, a son, and a
“Auror Pierce.”
He didn’t know what he had expected.
Draco flinched, sucking in a sharp inhale. “P-please, sir. Don’t hurt her, I’ll be
“No!” Draco blurted. “I-I want to do it, I’m just…”
Narcissa nodded sharply. “Your father has a lot on his plate right now. He can’t be worrying about the house getting broken into right now.”
He shifted and pulled a photograph from his trouser pocket. He had intended to show it to Narcissa, a last ‘
”I know another way I can help you, baby. Unfortunately, it doesn’t involve my cock.”
“Even if you refuse to see it, you helped me. Your visits were a reprieve for me. You’ll never know how much life you breathed into me during our visits. In a way, you helped me get through the worst of it. I think…if I hadn’t of had you, I would have never made it.
”Where are you trying to escape to, boy?” Potter grabbed his hip with one hand and yanked him back over his lap. “There is no escaping
Draco nuzzled into Pansy’s dark hair, inhaling her familiar scent. “You’re a great friend, you know that, right?” he mumbled.
Harry’s hips stuttered and he came on the spot, his orgasm triggered by Draco’s confession and his sweet, sexy usage of the word
No, Merlin.
Draco felt the edge of his mouth lift, in an almost-smile. “I thought we agreed not to do this... that we weren’t going to talk of the past again, but I see now that it was unavoidable.” He took a breath, and found himself staring off at the wall behind Harry’s shoulder. “You are just one person, and... just like me, you were hardly more than a child in the war. Should someone have saved me that day? When I was being punished? Maybe. But not you. My parents perhaps, my aunt, Severus, or Dumbledore even.
Potter kicked off his shoes, and pulled his t-shirt over his head.
Harry blinked back at Draco, incomprehensibly.
A thrill—a heat—blossomed in Harry’s chest. He picked up the note carefully and unfolded it. Hermione tried to peer over his shoulder.
“Fine,” he said. He wanted to leave. “I’ll take it.”
you?’ Hermione asked breathlessly, catching up to them, and not taking her eyes off of Harry’s face.
‘I couldn’t get work, couldn’t get an apprenticeship anywhere. I looked everywhere for something, even minding a shop, but all I found were closed doors.’
? Like, why with the books?’
Ron laughed. “Sorry. I’m just bored over here, I guess. This paperwork is putting me to sleep.”
He untied the letter, and rummaged around for a treat in his bedside table. He tossed it, and the owl caught it in its mouth, crunched once, then turned and flew off in a huff.
He had to leave in
‘Yeah.’
Draco was quiet for a moment. Then, softly, he said, “I don’t know how to do things part way with Harry. When I’m around him, I just want to … leap.”
Pansy grinned, and wrapped his head up in a hug, kissing the top of his hair.
The unasked question was: what’s changed?
Nice.
Draco stared at him for a drawn-out moment, then folded in on himself, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Well that’s a ridiculous thing to proclaim. Draco opened his mouth to argue.
‘I’m not sure I can eat … just yet …'
She pulled him down, and he toppled onto her; they rolled on the bed, kissing.
The corner of her mouth lifted. She looked fond. “What’s on your mind?”
hungry, though. And I think they stop serving breakfast soon.” Harry winced, looking apologetic.
“I knew Voldemort was getting angrier and increasingly desperate, and I knew he would take it out on you and your family. I knew that your family had disappointed him... and then I just took those wands, leaving you defenceless... Oh God, and your face was bleeding from the chandelier.” Harry’s eyes widened, and darted to Draco’s face. Draco knew what he must see—the tiny raised lines on his face.
Draco exhaled loudly. ‘You want to talk about that,
. Believe it or not, some of us actually need our jobs.”
'Not interested,' Draco murmured, giving himself a shake and tucking back in.
“The plant in your hands.”
‘Did I ever tell you about the first time I flew?’ Malfoy asked conversationally.
Something twisted in Draco’s insides. “Yes.”
He hadn’t expected that.
So, he’d have to lend Malfoy his broom then. He’d prefer a second date, but, who knows … maybe Malfoy would agree to one anyways.
“Yeah.” Merlin, Draco didn’t even want to. At the beginning of the trip, he was looking to get out of it. Now… now he was allowed to kiss Harry and sleep in his arms and Draco didn’t want that to have to end. Tonight, he’d be back in his bed… in the Slytherin dorms, way too far away from Harry.
That blush returned … the one high up on Draco’s cheeks. ‘That’s …' Draco licked his lip. ‘Awfully fast of you to say.’
Harry’s jaw muscles clenched. ‘Except,’ he echoed, ‘for Draco Malfoy.’
'Oh …' Harry stared at Draco for a beat, not really understanding the hold-up. 'What about you, though?'
Draco shrugged, and had a look around the room. It seemed dimmed, perhaps due to the grey skies and rain beating down against the window. There weren’t many people around... Just Pansy and Blaise sitting quietly at a table—Blaise caught his eye and winked. Finnegan and Thomas were at another table, hand-in-hand, and lost in their own world. And there were a handful of Muggles around. He even spotted the elderly couple he’d briefly chatted with on the first morning of their trip. The husband was sipping at his tea, while his wife looked to be prattling on about something.
'It's probably good for self-esteem or something.'
And not have Harry Potter making no sense.
nice, though. Cheerful.
Harry reached over and grabbed Malfoy’s forearm. “Stop.”
He blinked rapidly. That was a very, very weird concept.
'You did good,' Harry said, rather earnestly.
He screwed the cap off the bottle first, and took a long drink. It was sweet, bubbly, and, yeah, was definitely mango—the picture hadn’t lied. It was a pretty good drink, really. He couldn’t remember if he’d ever had a mango drink before. He’d only just tried mangos—the fruit—a couple years earlier. And ever since, he’s always been sure to visit the Indian grocer near his house to pick some up during the summers.
'Evan belongs to no one but himself—what era are you living in?’ Draco scoffed. ‘Besides, I think he is quite well-equipped to choose his own partners, and—
Potter/Harry laughed. ‘All right. What about iced tea? Something fruity or something?’
. That conversation was about how I might hurt you, like,
‘I didn’t like that either. Nor the dancing.’
Harry licked at his bottom lip, and found himself unable to meet Malfoy’s eyes in that moment. “You know what you look like.”
He palmed at Malfoy’s cheeks, trying to get him to just stay still—to let Harry kiss him back properly.
“Who did you perform it with?”
'No,' Harry said, taking hold of Draco's waist and turning him—switching their places. 'Can I suck you off instead?' He wanted to do something for Draco first, to show how much he appreciated him.
“And it’s... is it Muggle?”
‘Well, come inside and we will have a chat.’
to have been Ginny. Ginny and no one else. He searched her face, and she looked serious enough. “Are you sure?”
Potter made a funny sound.
‘Are you still a damp tea towel, then?’ Harry asked, straightening his napkin.
‘You thought it was a lost cause, then? That you were doomed for a life of unrequited love?’
Draco laughed, and twisted to kiss Harry on the mouth. 'Well. Thank you.'
“Good. We won 4, lost 1.”
“Alright. See you later.”
A third, heavy-set pale fellow with a scruffy brown beard got up, and hugged the two huggers.
“You can’t possibly think …"
‘Also … I’ve gotten a letter from Professor McGonagall,’ Hermione began, Harry’s ears perked up. ‘They’re working on repairs later this summer, and we’re invited to come help. Only if we want to or can, of course.’
The man scowled, spitting out, 'Of course. You're wasting your time, if you want more than a quick fuck.' He wet his hands. 'He belongs to me. Just a piece of friendly advice.'
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, and, not knowing what else to do, rubbed gently in an up/down motion.
Ginny groaned. ‘It’s so hard to get answers out of you.’
'And I come bearing gifts.' Her eyes twinkled.
‘I was going to write you when I got in,’ Draco said, looking fond, with eyes raking over Harry’s face.
Draco laughed. “Yes, we’ll be close.’
Harry flashed him a smile, and turned off the car.
‘Shut up,’ she said, sounding almost fond. ‘Let’s have a hug and then go to bed, alright?’
He put the envelope down on the coffee table. “I think I’ve made a mistake.” The hole was still there in his chest, the ache. A night’s sleep hadn’t done anything to ease it.
Merlin. Fuck.
‘You didn’t,’ Draco replied with a smirk.
He tried to dance along properly, but he was distracted. So distracted. Potter was distracting.
Malfoy glanced away towards the bar. “I worried we wouldn’t know what to talk about. Or we’d find something to argue about, since … well, that was what we always did.”
Harry grinned. ‘Sure.’
Malfoy grabbed on to Harry’s elbow to steady him, at the same time as he hissed, “
“Great,” Ron said, flashing Harry a devilish grin. “All right, get back to your …
Harry watched the movement, and took it as a sign that he could talk. “I’m sorry,” he said. “About everything—”
They laughed, June did a little shrug, and they all resumed dancing.
Harry slumped in his chair, huffing a laugh. ‘Okay, you’ve a point. I was stupid and brash today. Usually I’m a bit better. I think.’
Draco let out a shaky breath, arching up involuntarily. “
. ‘Thank you … for saying those things. I do feel more at peace, I think. The most at-peace I’ve ever been, really. And the most myself I know how to be.’
Malfoy strode over, and took it out of his hands, giving it a closer look. “Thank you,” he said, rather neutrally, and moved to place it on the windowsill. Malfoy paused to look at it for a quick moment, and then turned around to go back into his bedroom.
And he didn’t want to be petulant. He wished he could be more mature about seeing Draco kiss Terry Boot. But he couldn’t. And wouldn’t.
Narcissa pulled back, to give her son a once over, hands gripping tight to his arms. ‘Oh Draco, I’m so thankful.’ She turned to Harry, with tears in her eyes. ‘Mr Potter,
Another grunt.
‘Oh hold on, I forgot the sound,’ said Pansy. She took the laptop back and clicked something. A blast of loud, throbbing, contemporary music played as she pointed it back in Draco’s direction.
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. Malfoy … Draco had just let what he’d said slide. And he’d actually answered him, slipping back into an easy, light-hearted tone that Harry would never have thought them capable of before the wedding.
Draco let a smile escape again. “Yeah. I like that it’s unpredictable.”
“Harry Potter.”
‘Great, thanks Brenda.’
She cast her husband a quick glance, smirking at him. Then, she turned back to Harry, and said, “Thank you so much for my jumper, I absolutely
Harry felt a pang, in his chest.
‘I do!’ Blaise was his friend … Greg … He might not’ve seen them in a little while, but … he was busy! He had organisations to run.
“Do I get a hello?” Harry asked, smiling.
‘I’ve noticed you’ve been receiving gifts. Who are they from?’
“Sorry,” Harry said again. “I’m an idiot, right?” He smiled sadly at Draco, shrugging a shoulder just once.
He leaned forwards, so that no one would overhear. “It’s not about whether or not it’s fun.” He sighed and rubbed a palm over his face. Merlin, maybe Potter’s Gryffindor-ish honesty in conversation was rubbing off on him. “It’s about... well, no one wants me there.”
Harry dragged his hands down off his face, and cast his gaze to the bathroom ceiling. Fuck. He was already at least half way there. Draco was clever. If he didn’t know now … he’d know soon. ‘I don’t like the reminder,’ he said, so quietly.
Malfoy hummed. ‘Yes, yes I think we can.’ He tilted his head to look up at Harry. ‘The deep cleaning begins tomorrow, Potter.’ He was smiling.
It had been a heavier question than Harry had thought. Harry absorbed that information … he could imagine, yeah. And he hated it. Draco had been cleared of all charges. But people had long memories, and to some, a Death Eater was always going to be a Death Eater. Even if they’d only been a kid.
‘That’s …' Draco sucked in a breath, and smiled softly. ‘Really admirable.’
‘Can we join our flats, like, I don’t know … create a door?’
Pansy took his hand and squeezed it, staring at their entwined fingers. She looked up suddenly, with a startlingly warm expression. ‘How long have you felt this way about him?’
Harry could actually think the words that day, could put them into a complete sentence.
Draco shifted his whole body closer, pressing the full length of himself into Harry. And it nearly took Harry's breath away. His body was so solid, with only thin pyjama material between them—so Harry could feel his body heat, the rise and fall of his breaths. Every bony part and every soft part. It was already sending Harry's blood pumping.
He dumped his bag on the kitchen table, and slumped down on the chair. Well, he’d survived that ordeal. He eyed his bag wearily. Why’d he buy those socks?
A Friday evening Floo-call surprised Draco, right in the middle of one of such solo dance sessions. He shut off the Wireless and sat cross-legged in front of the hearth.
'Yeah.' And he meant it.
He opened up the card. Merlin, he was awful at these things. He looked up at the salesgirl, who was making a show of pretending not to pay attention to him.
'Not at all.'
Harry turned back to his own plate, picking up his fork to shovel eggs and mash into his mouth. He was starving, and didn’t feel much like spying on Draco Malfoy—who was definitely
She faded away, shaking her head at him.
She frowned back at him, stern in her ghostiness.
Focussing on that one thing.
'Let me get dressed, then.'
Why did it feel like … rejection?
‘Yes,’ Draco replied. He sighed, then shimmied his way down into a lying position, starring up at the ceiling. ‘God, if you told me yesterday …'
“So, back to this ghost of yours …"
Draco cut him off with another kiss. 'I love you. Now stop that.'
Draco raised an eyebrow.
‘Mother,’ he answered.
Harry pulled Draco into him, so that their bodies were flush together. Wet, and soapy. Expanses of naked skin on skin. Chest-to-chest, knee-to-knee. And Draco's penis, which Harry hadn't even seen yet, soft and pressed up just slightly to the right of Harry's own.
It had a photo of a blond androgynous-looking woman on the cover, with the words, “The Annie Lennox Collection”.
Draco bit back a laugh, because he could make a stupid quip about those words. Instead, though, he did what Harry told him.
“I’m not sure. But it may be a clue.”
“Do you know about ghost banishing?”
The squeak seemed to bring the attention of everyone else. Maybe Harry should’ve planned the reveal of their relationship with a bit more care. He looked around at the faces of his friends. Most just looked amused: Ron, Hermione, and Ginny included. Luna wore a knowing smile on her face. Neville, Dean and Seamus were a bit more surprised.
The music changed over to a new song—something softer and sweeter—and everyone stretched their necks to peer over their shoulders. At the bride, presumably.
And then it was just the two of them, again. Okay, this was all a bit weird, just standing in Luna’s front room, alone. And apparently there were Muggles somewhere.
'Just a second.' He rushed back to his bedroom to collect the folded-up paper from yesterday's jean pocket, and brought it back over to Draco, laying out flat on the table between them.
“Sure, out of pity or goodness or something.” He felt Potter’s eyes on him, so he looked over. And Potter seemed so earnest and wide-eyed there.
, that was what Hermione used to say. ‘I guess he’d had a crush, all those years ago.’
Harry licked his lips, and smiled. ‘Yeah.’
“I love you.”
“People touch people they like,” she said, putting her hand on his arm.
Oh. Okay. Another delay in their talk, then. Harry was almost relieved … He nodded. ‘Alright.’
Ginny and Luna exchanged a look; Ginny’s expression was dry, Luna’s: amused.
‘Um …’ he said, his eyes flashing over to the back of Malfoy’s blond head. He got ready to protest—but at that moment, Blaise Zabini parked himself down beside Malfoy. ‘Yeah, okay,’ he finished, disappointed.
He nodded again. 'I should ... speak to a few people.'
Harry told him everything, blabbering on, while Dumbledore watched Harry’s face from behind his half-moon spectacles, wearing a funny little smile. He waited until Harry was done and nearly panting, before he spoke.
Most don't think it’s wrong? No one had ever talked about this in school. He didn’t even know of anyone at Hogwarts who was … that word. And he’d certainly never heard about a parade.
Once Harry came out, Draco was already sitting up in bed, with his back against the headboard, eyeing Harry with uncertainty. He had on a plain white t-shirt, and had his hands folded carefully in his lap.
. Malfoy stood across the room speaking to Luna Lovegood, of all people, and wore a slate-grey button-down with black trousers. All well-tailored and expensive-looking. He was so …
She smiled. 'Speaking of, I've signed you up for the class. The first one is tomorrow at half-two.'
“I’d ask you inside,” Draco said, “But no one besides Slytherins have been in our common room, and, well... I wouldn’t want to be the one to break centuries of tradition.”
“I know that!”
'Just need a signature, sir,' she said hurriedly.
Harry’s brow furrowed. ‘It’s …' he said, pulling it out.
Granger cornered him the next morning after breakfast, just before he could exit the Great Hall.
He took a sip of tea first, and then a breath.
Malfoy smiled. He seemed relieved. Harry felt a bit relieved himself. “Well … that was a heavy conversation to start a date with.”
And then, black ink moving on parchment filled the screen. It was so familiar to Draco that it felt eerie. Muggles didn’t live in castles or use quills, right?
She clicked through the photos of Dalt Vila, to the photo of Draco looking scandalised with the wood cock bottle opener inserted in his hand.
Quickly, Draco leaned in towards Harry's ear. 'I just need to piss. I'll be back.'
They walked, arm-in-arm, with her light guiding the way, until they came upon a clearing lit by bright crackling bonfire.
Biting back a heavy sigh, Draco toed his trainers off, and pushed them into the closet with a socked foot, keeping a wary eye on Potter’s back.
'In the dark,' Draco reminded him, looking up the long bare length of him.
.' Seriously, who didn't like bread?
And then Harry pushed up to capture Draco’s mouth in his. They kissed, slowly, tenderly.
Well, the skin around them changed. Older, more weathered, with crow's feet—which merely meant that Harry had laughed a lot. Harry had lines around his mouth too, and two between his eyebrows. Smiles. Deep thinking, concern. Parts of his life were written right there on his face, and … and time had only made him more ruggedly handsome.
Harry looked at Candelabra, flipped back up on her feet now, rubbing up against Draco again. “Okay, I’m going to pet her.”
Harry looked at Draco, with that little smile, with his nearly white hair—un-gelled these days—just softly framing his face, and thought: he’s lovely.
“Great, thanks,” Malfoy said, tugging Harry along with him as he went where the nurse had indicated.
Harry inhaled sharply. Was that really true? ‘You’d kiss me?’
The sight instantly gave a terrible jolt to Draco—signalling something. Danger, perhaps.
Harry sighed, and shoved a hand into his pocket, taking a sip of his drink with the other. He looked out at the outline of trees in the distance. Everything felt so …
'Not really. Glass of wine here and there.'
They paid the nice lady, and left the shop.
‘Mm.’ Harry laid his face on Draco’s shoulder as Draco worked. It probably wasn’t very convenient of him.
“Fine.”
When he came out as gay to his parents, he’d been kicked out. Just like that ... Draco had heard Muggles had prejudices, but he didn’t think it’d be for something as ridiculous as being attracted to someone with the same contents under their pants.
'Mm.'
Harry shook his head. ‘That’s all I know.’ His mind searched for something else to say, something to let Malfoy know that he really did want to be actual friends …
'Yes,' Draco said, nodding slowly. Harry seemed quite happy to've shifted the focus of conversation from himself to youth drop-ins and charities.
‘Yes, please,
‘Tosser,’ said Ron.
Draco moaned, and grabbed Harry by the hips, helping him grind against him.
, even—and went over to give Malfoy his hug.
They ate in comfortable silence for a while, and sipped their wines.
'My loneliness is killing me ... I must confess, I still believe …' Draco mouthed along, squeezing his eyes shut. 'When I'm not with you, I lose my mind … give me a si-i-i-ign.'
‘So your father …' Draco began, tentatively.
Harry wasted no time in gripping them both in his hand, flush together, stroking them at the same time. It was the most erotic thing Draco had ever seen. And it felt—It felt—Merlin, he was so bloody turned-on. And Harry’s hand was doing all the right things...
‘Who did you come here with?’
“Don’t spend it alone,” Ron ordered.
That earned a snort out of Potter, and Draco laughed a little too; it was still a bit ridiculous, after all this time.
Thank you for reading so far ❤️
Draco exhaled slow. They were up to no good, that much was certain.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’m fine.”
wake me up earlier than I'd hoped,' he admitted, smiling. But he had napped a bit on his beach towel. 'I'm all right, though.'
Harry’s jaw muscle twitched. ‘I didn’t know what the spell did.’
He heard the door close.
Arguable, that was ...
Draco pressed his lips tight together and vanished the monstrosity of a mattress, and shifted his bed back into its original position.
It was just for safety—so that they wouldn’t get separated—he reminded himself. It didn’t necessarily mean anything to get one’s hopes up about.
His old defences, back from his school days, begged to be let to the surface. They wanted him to scowl and bite back to save face. But … Draco wasn’t going to let them. He was … more mature than that (or so he hoped).
Ron laughed. ‘Well, Pansy and that Seventh Year Hufflepuff made out. What was her name … Becky?’
It hadn’t been as difficult as he thought it would be.
“You’re twenty-four,” Hermione said wryly.
Astoria’s expression was soft. “Thank you, Harry. It’s sweet of you to think of us. I’ll talk it over with him, all right?”
Harry opened his eyes. That had been a stupid thing to imagine—a posh, well-read man like that wouldn’t write ‘trembles’ in a love poem. He sighed and looked back down at the page.
Draco’s eyes seemed to darken, and he visibly swallowed. ‘You want to …'
The faintest sounds came from the slow movements of their lips, from their breaths, from the slight rustling of fabric.
Draco closed his eyes. Potter couldn’t even say it. So, Draco did, “The superiority of my birth? That Muggleborns should be kept out of Hogwarts? That Muggles are not people?”
The hand paused, flickering in and out.
‘Right.’ That was … erm …
Potter licked his lips. He looked like he was having difficulty looking Draco in the eye, his eyes kept darting towards the floor.
'Harry,' Draco bit out, practically a whine, into Harry's mouth. His fingers faltered on Harry's penis, slowing, and gripping harder, as Draco's whole body seemed to tense up. He panted into to Harry's mouth, and let out a strangled cry.
Draco blinked rapidly. His heart was racing. He wasn’t doing a good job of this. ‘It’s … she won’t tell anyone. She casually mentioned that you had a show tonight. And I’m here on vacation. I thought I’d … well, curiosity—or, erm ...’
“People like your father, Draco. I don’t. Most people don’t, not anymore. Prejudice exists, yes, but there’s also a whole month dedicated to queer pride now. There a parade, even. The Muggles run it, but I'm sure countless Witches and Wizards attend as well.”
‘Mm, yes. I have his return address on an envelope here someplace.’
Harry bit at his bottom lip to keep from smiling too much, and nodded.
It was like being a zoo animal. For the first time in his life, he was sympathetic toward zoo animals. He was one of them now. He was a zebra longing for the Serengeti, and Potter was a child in a baseball cap munching on peanuts staring at him without blinking. It was
'I'm taking it back,' Harry said, smiling at him.
‘Yeah,’ Harry said, biting a smile. He agreed, to whatever they were talking about.
“I want to,” he said decidedly, and pawed at the blanket that was still wrapped around Harry’s waist. Harry’s hand—regrettably—left Draco’s cock, and he helped to free himself, removing the blanket and then pushing his boxer briefs down.
, yesterday. That boy, the Second Year.’
‘It’s fine, okay?’ Harry tried to protest. ‘I’ve spoken to Dumbledore, I’ve told him everything. There’s a plan.’
Harry pulled out a strip of parchment paper, and began to write his essay on the effects of bat tongues in revival-type potions, but his eye kept straying to the journal.
-I'm in self-isolation alone, so if any of the interactions in here are weird, it's because I've forgotten what human interactions even are
They certainly weren’t friends. Perhaps it was a mistake? Sent out in error? Or, a joke?
“You can say no!” Harry rushed to add.
“Do you want it?”
“Molly,” Harry replied into her big hair. “How is she? What’s happening?”
He watched their retreating backs and sighed in relief. Pansy could’ve easily got him in so much trouble.
She waited, watching him intensely and folding her arms over her chest.
Harry looked around, searching for Hermione. The restaurant was dark enough on its own, lighting-wise, and the decor itself did nothing to aid visibility. It was largely navy-blue velvet: the floors, the table cloths, the walls; so it took a moment to spot Hermione. But, there she was, smiling at him from a table near the back.
So he pressed the button again.
Pansy flashed all her teeth with a grin, and struggled to push herself up off the log. Draco tried to help steady her, and eventually she got it.
Oh ...
In, and out.
So Draco washed his hands, then splashed cold water on his face. He looked back at himself—that was a bit better. Merlin, his mouth tasted bad. He cupped his hands on the running water and drank a few handfuls. And finally, he brushed his teeth.
Draco just looked at him, marvelling at every small movement on Harry's face.
When he got to the 8th year common room, it seemed more crowded than usual. Pansy spotted him immediately and shoved him into the corner by the window, where they couldn’t be overheard.
Harry saw stars behind closed eyelids, coming hard in long spurts against his hand, thighs and the comforter. He moaned, and Draco kept licking him until Harry’s body stilled.
Slytherins had to be so tiresomely subtle, cunning, secretive in their friendships, their affections. See: Pansy’s scheme. Now, if she’d been a Gryffindor, Draco probably could’ve had a nice, mature heart-to-heart chat with her about his feelings, instead of having him thrust into Potter’s bedroom against his will.
He just shook his head again, and fished an empty cardboard box out from under the table cloth, getting to work.
“I will, Harry.”
Jojo - Leave (Get Out)
His sober brain will thank his intoxicated brain later. It will.
She nodded curtly in return. They turned back to Harry with determined looks on their faces.
He blinked at her.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand, and a soft choke escaped his lips. When Harry looked, he saw a tear fall from the corner of Draco's eye.
about what he looked like that evening. Which, he didn’t. Well... not really. As Pansy had repeated so many times—it'd be outside, in the dark.
He took his coffee over to a free seat by the shop window, and settled into it—undoing his coat and loosening his scarf. As he sipped at his drink, he watched people rush by outside, bundled up from the cold, some clutching on to their shopping bags, others staring down at those funny mobile phones that Muggles seemed to favour.
It wasn’t long before a response started to appear.
“I. Think. So.”
Malfoy didn’t respond, instead he untied the twine around his letters with those nimble, pale fingers.
Harry put his quill down. That was weird, but, probably the most interesting thing that happened to him in months. Strange that he'd just happened upon a magically-linked diary.
He tried to keep his mind carefully blank. He’d said, ‘I’m sorry,’ and done what he’d set out to do. That … was that. Back to normal, now. Conscience: appeased.
And Harry’s tongue was a gift, against Draco’s neck. A marvel. A hot, warm, sexy—
Harry stormed off.
Draco shook his head to clear it, and, stubbornly ignoring any further thought on the matter, he read the next part.
, Draco. You can’t come over every day.’
Different? It sent a rush through Draco. Potter might actually like them, then, for some incomprehensible reason. He blinked at Potter for a beat, before remembering himself and quickly sneering. “Different, how?”
Pansy slumped, and her eyes raked over his face. A sad smile formed on her lips. “I want you there.”
Seemingly bewildered and amused all at once, Harry asked, 'Would you rather I wear a t-shirt, shorts, and a pair of sunglasses to your fundraiser? To your workplace?'
sounds. ”Well, never mind that. I’ll show you to the spot, if you’re able?”
“But that was all well and good for me
Salazar. 'There was …' He winced. '
‘Thanks,’ he said, wiping his eyes with the back of a hand. ‘It seems like all we do is cry around each other.’
She did, and she turned to go back to her table, but not before ruffling his hair.
“Because of proper
Scorpius had some ridiculous notions.
echoed in his mind.
‘I don’t want to sleep in her bed, either.’
Hermione sighed. ‘We’ve failed.’
‘And?’ asked Ron, with bright eyes.
‘Unhand me, you barbarian!’
‘All right …' he said slowly. ‘I’ll think about it.’
'Right, sorry, but good. How's your trip been?'
‘I saw you today,’ Harry blurted. ‘At lunch.’
Malfoy glared at them in Harry’s hand, as a muscle twitched in his jaw. “Did you open them?” His voice was flatter than his facial expression.
“Take your time.”
Harry sat beside him, leaving a respectable distance, and picked up a glass for himself and the other to hand to Malfoy. Malfoy released a hand from his blanket cocoon to grab it.
He sat down hard onto the bed. He’d actually come to Ibiza. It felt strange, like it might not actually be real.
‘Was it only animosity?’ Harry asked, and his expression seemed to sober as well.
. He’d been a Death Eater, he’d let those monsters into Hogwarts, he’d nearly killed Ron. It all seemed contradictory now, after having testified in support of Draco back then. But at the time, Harry didn’t want to hear any pitiful excuses from Draco, and he certainly hadn’t wanted to be his
Ginny. She was coming at him, big brown eyes sparkling, and pink lips smiling. Ginny was familiar, he told himself. She was undeniably
‘And, what?’ he asked, averting his eyes quickly when Malfoy glanced in his general direction.
‘Of course I didn’t. Because, you see, it’s very embarrassing.’
Moira nodded.
‘I did. It was anonymous, like all the others.’
“Potter, have you an extra of those,” she waved her hand about, “those jumpers with the zipper.”
Harry winced. ‘Wait.’
“I’m the villain. The loser. The fuck-up. And you’re Harry Potter.”
. In cold blood, right there in a Hogwarts bathroom. Harry would’ve murdered him. Harry would have become a murderer.
now, he still thought about Harry.
‘Yes,’ Harry agreed. ‘And none of them were signed.’
Harry connected their Floos so that they could pop over and back easily. And then, they went through.
'But … I come with a peace offering.' A pause. 'Food?' Draco buried his face deeper in the pillow. 'Can I come up?'
Pansy Parkinson in that shower. Water running down her breasts, one leg propped up on the edge of the bathtub while he ate her out. Better.
‘I want to see your cock,’ Harry blurted out against Draco’s lips.
.' Draco looked up at her, wide-eyed. 'You …'
Fuck.
“Gnocchi and white truffle in a gorgonzola sauce.”
“Um... I don’t understand why
‘Sure.’
Draco splashed harder.
'You need to buy some souvenirs,' Harry announced, setting off for the shop they'd just nearly passed.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's sated and spent body, holding him close. 'You're fucking amazing.'
‘I think we should wait a bit before we tell anyone about us. Is that okay? It’s just … I only just, well, pretty much rejected Ginny last night …'
‘Try to pay attention to the Snitch this time, Draco.’ Harry smirked, just to goad him on.
telling them about Draco, since it didn’t matter. Not really.
“Oh …"
‘Oh.’ He deflated. That certainly sounded overly-convoluted.
Malfoy shot him another look. ‘You keep asking if I’m fine. I suppose if you won’t believe me, I’ll have to show you. Then perhaps you will finally leave me alone,’ he said, heavily enunciating the words
“I’d never been out of the UK before,” Harry just sort of blurted out.
Weasley’s cheeks went an unflattering scarlet again. “Yeah,” he fumbled to say. “I mean, I don’t want to hurt him.”
Draco stared at him, watching him move in time to a song that seemed to be about breaking up, while still keeping your ex in your heart.
Harry felt a blush rising. ‘Er … well, sometimes films—'
It was fun. Dumb, childish fun.
Malfoy shot him a raised eyebrow. ‘I’m afraid not.’
Harry laughed.
Most people raised their hands.
…" What the fuck?
“If anything had—”
He hoped they were home.
‘Am I married?’ He huffed out a breathy little laugh. ‘No.’ Draco seemed to blink more rapidly at that, looking off at the far wall. ‘I’ve been single for about five years, now.’
He opened up the package, finding two items wrapped in colourful Christmas paper, along with a note. He read it first:
Oh God, he’d … And right in the middle of the library …
'And now we wait,' he said aloud, to the empty room.
'Sure.'
Harry spun the wheel, and guided the thing onto the proper street, and accelerated.
It seemed a miracle any two people could come together. And stay together.
Harry’s mouth.
The owl tried to nip at his bagel. “I don’t think bread is good for birds,” Harry mumbled. “I think I read somewhere it puffs up in your stomach, gives you terrible stomach cramps.”
Sighing, Draco muttered, 'Why are Muggles so needlessly complicated,' as he mirrored Harry's movement. The strap behaved this time, and he was able to click the metal bit into the clunky box-bit, just like Harry had done.
Draco looked at him, properly now, and smiled. Harry felt a smile grow on his own face. And he just wanted to …
So, there he was, on the busy platform with trunk in hand, ready (more or less) for his final year. Harry gripped the handle a bit too tightly, and had to try to will himself to relax.
Ron shot Harry a grin. “That’s all, huh?”
. Draco Malfoy had always hated him.
'I'm all right,' Harry breathed out.
-Alcohol Use
‘Er …' He’d expected to, what, wing it? Every place on earth had hotels somewhere, didn’t they?
He didn't know why he was laughing.
He smiled, and shut it, tucking it underneath his pillow.
Harry searched for the right thing to say, but he hadn’t a clue. This was getting awkward, but clearly something was the matter even if Malfoy’s wasn’t saying so.
‘I want this to continue, past today.’
He shrugged, and attempted a smile. “You always drink tea with meals, right?”
Harry smiled. ‘Interesting, to say the least.’
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. ‘Certainly not.’
Sound was beginning to return to normal—it was just a room, with people quietly chatting over meals.
'Oh yeah? Which one?' There was amusement in his tone.
“Because I’m your fiancé and you trust me?”
Ron waved his hand around. “Borderline … stalkery.”
Draco’s calm expression didn’t change. “Sure. The reckless, brave, idiotic epitome of Gryffindor masculinity, with the fiery, quick-witted, defender of the downfallen epitome of Gryffindor femininity.”
Draco hyper-focused on the fire in front of them, but the steady rise and fall of Potter’s body against him was very difficult to ignore.
Harry pulled back, to look at Draco’s face, so close.
‘See you soon, then,’ Harry said to him.
somewhere—’
Malfoy’s ears immediately pinkened.
The song winded down to that weird talking part that made no sense to Draco. Something about an ocean and a gift.
“That’s the idea,” Malfoy said, through a breathy laugh, as he reached for Harry’s hand to help him up.
‘No one comes here,’ Potter said. ‘Probably since it’d be so hard to get to if you can’t Apparate.’
That was fair, but ... ‘I’m still working it all out.’
And then, Draco was crying out, with his mouth open, and hands grasping onto Harry’s skin. His body pulsated with orgasm, shooting hot ejaculate inside of Harry’s body.
‘But …'
-skin—he was going to glow like the moon amongst all the tan people. And this was all not to mention the faded and marred Dark Mark on his arm. But Pansy’d said the wizarding population in Ibiza is slim-to-none, so he was unlikely to frighten anyone.
Oh God.
This all seemed surreal—like he’d walked a hallway, turned a corner, and found himself in a completely different building.
Harry put his quill down for a moment, and switched hands. He wanked himself hard and fast, with mind full of Draco’s arse, his nakedness, his body underneath him. Fuck, this was … this was so good. But …
-perfect. No one is, I suppose. But you’re...” Oh Merlin, what was he saying? Draco sighed. “Do you know why we’re rooming together?”
Instead, he looked around at the light-green wallpapered walls that pealed slightly in places, the ugly brown and yellow abstract painting hanging in between the two double beds—beds which looked decently comfortable with plush white comforters. There was even a telly-vision resting on a low mahogany dresser, positioned so that it could be viewed from lying in bed.
Harry tossed one last look at Malfoy, which he hoped conveyed some sort of polite apology. Malfoy just looked back, neutrally watching them rush off.
“Yeah,” he said, and it came out a bit breathless. “Thanks, I think this party is exactly what I needed.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Fuck. It was Weasley. And where there’s Weasley—
Because without realising it, Harry wanted this to turn into altogether something else.
“What—”
, he surprised himself to note.
Harry ran a hand over his face. “I guess it is.”
Now, though, he felt … lighter.
And Potter wasn’t talking. The man’s brow was furrowed up in confusion, as he stared at the duvet.
A warm paper package was dropped into Draco's hand. he brought it up to his mouth, and tore it open with his teeth. It smelled great. He took a big bite.
Harry laughed. ‘Sorry, I just thought that it
Harry shrugged. ‘Well, we’ve got that conversation out of the way now, haven’t we? Now let’s eat, and you can continue on with what you were saying. Tell me more about South Africa. Is it very hot there? Are there zebras?’
Next, Draco received a pile of nice, soft yarns.
Fuck. Curse his sense of morality. He could be snogging Harry Potter right now.
“Shut up.” But Malfoy smiled, and he leaned down to kiss Harry some more. Then, he broke away to say, “Accio wand.” And his wand flew into his hand. “You’re sure?” he asked, hesitating once more.
He fumbled around his pocket for that Portkey again. Finding it, he held it to the both of them.
The other members of the family crowded Ron, giving him hugs, offering him soft words of comfort. Saying it’ll be alright, that Hermione was strong … that she and baby would be just fine.
'For making this all so bloody awkward tonight,' Harry continued, wincing. 'You've been so …' He took a breath. 'So good with me. Thank you.'
. But only if you want to.’
Harry rubbed his face with his hands.
He picked up his quill, and wrote.
Harry laughed a little again. He took his wine glass with him to inspect the shelf. He could almost feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. He wondered what Malfoy thought of him wearing his clothes, because it felt a bit intimate to Harry. Thankfully, Malfoy couldn’t see his blush from this angle.
Hermione nodded. “All right, that sounds like a logical plan. And you can talk to me anytime.”
Harry managed another smile. “He’s knows about it now, it won’t be a surprise.”
A sharp tap on the glass door came, and without waiting for an answer, Morgan took the liberty of inserting herself into the room.
‘So, what, do I need to worry about him now?’
“If you want to, I don’t know, you could close your eyes?” Harry asked, as they approached.
‘Harry! Where have you
He started to pull back, and Draco let him. Their arms dropped to their sides.
Draco’s eyes flashed with want. ‘You think you’re ready?’
“That’s a person’s name,” Harry said.
Harry shrugged a shoulder. “Either, or both. We could take turns.”
Someone sat beside him, he looked—and it was just Pansy. She grinned at him through half-closed eyes.
She nodded, and patiently waited for him to share what he’d come to say.
“You look doubtful,” she continued, choosing her word's carefully, “but let’s think about it logically. Rationally. How could a man loving another man be wrong? What possible reason could there be?”
'I'll miss you.'
'No.' He couldn't see Rodney doing that. He'd certainly be surprised if he had. 'Not that I know of.'
And he was pissing rather a lot. Too many wines and cocktails, perhaps.
“Draco. I love you. I’m
'What have I done,' Harry said without any bite, reaching for his camera back.
A laugh escaped it. “It hasn’t been long—”
He smiled sheepishly at the same time as Malfoy began to stretch like a cat, his foot pressing harder into Harry’s leg.
And it felt like … like being in a different time.
'Well that's progress from Hogwarts, or so I've heard.'
Potter’s voice.
“Well, yes, but … it’s been a while.”
Harry swirled his tongue around, feeling him, savouring him. He sucked Malfoy in deeper. Letting the cock graze against the ridges of the roof of his mouth. Merlin … Malfoy’s cock in his mouth … It was amazing. He sucked him deeper, right to the back of his throat.
The girl flashed him a toothy smile. He could see the wad of gum between her teeth. She picked up the box for him, and he followed her, reluctantly, to the cash.
