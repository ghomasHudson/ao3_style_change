Harry suspected this was as close to an apology as he was going to get. “It’s good to be protective of the people we care about. And you know better than most what dangers are out there...because you’ve seen them, not because you are one, because you’re not.”
He didn't know how long they kissed, but the room seemed much quieter when they pulled back enough to rest their foreheads together.
“I’ll take ingredients, Sir.” Harry looked right at Robards so he would miss Ron’s and Draco’s reactions. “I was much better at Herbology than Potions.”
“Hate to admit it, but at least you’re timely.  And I suspect illegal activity is something you understand.”  Weasley glared until Potter elbowed him.
"Mhmm," was all Draco managed as he tried to make sense of Potter's actions. He was almost acting as if they were a couple. A loud crack announced Potter's departure, but Draco stayed standing in the dark for long moments after.
He'd talk to Ron and Hermione once they escaped from Percy's latest story and made the way across the room to him. He'd probably chat with some co-workers—maybe sneak a bit of work in by conferring with Henderson on the McClain case. And when the time came, he would watch.
"The children are fine," Draco chided, "I’m the one who needs a hand." The fact that he was willing to accept help was impressive. That he would actually ask for it showed just how exhausted Draco was. He peered down at a long sheath of parchment blinking more times than should be necessary with such clear penmanship and then fumbled with a jar of cinnamon sticks until Harry gently took it from him.
"Ooh. You lucky dog." Romilda Vane's shrill voice was too close to his ear as she pressed up against him to read the parchment over his shoulder. Nosey bint. Aurors usually didn't come to the Curse-Breaker division, but Vane was always there pestering Draco and sniffing for gossip. "You can tie me to Harry Potter any time," she cooed. She dropped her head onto Draco's shoulder—curly black hair tickling his face—and sighed dramatically.
Their legs moved in tandem, propelling them forward faster than before. They were like one body moving together with the grace of a single mind. Unfortunately, Draco's natural grace in running had not improved completely over the past few weeks, and his outer foot stumbled. He tried to catch himself with his bound foot, but only succeeded in pulling Potter off balance. They staggered to the side, stumbling from the flat field into the small valley that ran along side it.
Draco scowled at the hand in his face for only a moment before he gave in to his instinct for self-preservation. "Truce." He wrapped his hand around Potter's and was surprised how warm it was.
Harry watched the little knobs that made up Draco’s spine rise and fall. His back was as expressive as his face, and Harry took in each twitch and arch, using each movement as a guide to increasing Draco’s pleasure. Draco shifted his weight forward onto one elbow and began stroking himself, and Harry knew he had to last long enough for Draco to come. He had to give Draco that pleasure.
It was likely this was Potter’s attempt to express his own interest, but Draco would proceed with caution until he was sure. No way in hell was Draco risking himself first. “Are you asking for a list of traits I find desirable in a partner or a list of men who could interest me?”
Draco had no idea if Potter could cook, but he Apparated home quite certain that he would eat sawdust if Potter served it. He was still thinking about Potter's smile as he climbed into his empty, cold bed and fell asleep.
Malfoy seemed taller as he strode between the racks of clothing to where a brown leather sofa faced three fitting rooms in the corner. The area around the sofa was set up like a small sitting room with a plush rug and a wooden side table. The wall was dominated by a large oval mirror.
Harry took Draco’s arm.  “Come on, Draco.  Time to go home.”  Draco’s grey eyes were wide and slightly panicked.  If Dave noticed, he didn’t say a word as Harry half dragged Draco from the inn.  They walked across the road and up the stairs in silence.  Once inside their flat, Draco tried to kiss him.
Harry missed Robards’ departing words, but it was clear they were dismissed when Robards began handing out files. Harry Vanished his chair and followed the team out of the office. Sylvie had put her hood back up and stepped to the side to speak with Draco and Bey. Their heads were close together and they gestured to the file Bey held in front of them.
Draco was alarmed to see blood replenisher between the cough potion and the fever reducer. He was about to ask about it when Abbott began coughing up blood on her way out the door. Oh,
"C'mon, Malfoy. I won' bite," Weasley slurred. Draco slowly lowered himself onto the stool. "There's a good git," Weasley said, and he sent a Stinging Hex at Draco's thigh.
She pointed to his parchment with one of her bright red nails. "Three-legged race with Harry. You have to tie your legs together."
Hermione looked impressed. What? Like Harry didn’t have good ideas now and then? So what if he was cheating by having Malfoy’s own words.
Potter stood just inside the door, his wand drawn, but not yet aimed.  His hair was as wild as usual, matching the intense look in his eye.  He was dressed like an impoverished Muggle in a faded green shirt, tattered jeans, and dirty trainers.  Yet even in his shabby attire, his posture and the heat of his magic commanded respect.  When he spoke, he sounded like the Auror he was.
Draco strolled into the inn halfway through dinner.  Harry wasn’t sure where he spent his days, but he managed to disappear from dawn until dusk, and it was driving Harry spare.  Whenever he tried to ask about it over dinner, Draco would change the subject by engaging someone else in conversation, and by the time they made it back to their flat after dinner, Draco refused to use their mouths for talking.
Rather than wait for Potter to figure anything out on his own, Draco placed his hands either side of Potter's face and brought their lips together once more. Feeling bold, he opened his mouth just enough to pull Potter's lower lip against his teeth. This was definitely not part of Phase Two, but Draco couldn't be asked to care when Potter moaned and pressed against him.
His pondering was interrupted when the waitress returned with their drinks and cutlery. 'Food will be out in a bit,' she said cheerily. She was the daughter of the owner, and Harry knew her by sight if not name.
He’d been sure his interest would ease once he was busy with Auror training, but somehow Hermione’s visits to London always included an update on how Draco and the other Slytherins were adjusting back at Hogwarts. And when Harry went to Hogwarts to visit her and his other friends, he couldn’t help but search the halls for tall, pale blonds.
“I had Voldemort living in my house for a year and you are worried about me tagging along to check a farm? It's unlikely anyone is even here!”
Potter pulled away enough to meet his eyes. There was a little line between his brows that showed his confusion. "What do you mean?"
One of Draco's hand moved down from Harry's belt to press again his cock. No thought was needed as desire ran through his body and Harry's hips pressed forward into the pressure. He could do this. This was instinct, and Harry was rather good at acting on instinct, experience be damned.
Pushing thoughts of hospitals from his mind, Draco focused on the way Potter's body writhed against his in time with their tongues.  Their hands grabbed and pulled at cloth and skin as they gasped into each other's mouths.
Draco nodded slowly. "Okay. This wasn’t quite the setting I’d imagined …" He turned back to his son and gently stroked the fine hair back from the boy's forehead. "You grew in Aunt Astoria’s tummy." He said gently. "She knew I wanted you more than anything but couldn’t make a baby by myself." His voice was so earnest and he looked terrified as he waited for Scorpius’ reply. Harry could feel his own heart clenching as he watched.
Okay, maybe it hadn't been phrased quite that way, but it was close enough.  Clearly Potter felt that he had made a sufficient show of being nice to satisfy his chivalrous need to buy dinner before a shag, and now he could stop pretending about what he really wanted Draco for.  Hadn't that been clear enough last night?
Draco looked equally surprised, propped up on his elbows with his face flush and his mouth gaping.  “Um . . . sorry,” Draco said quietly.  He looked abashed as if he'd done something wrong rather than being the picture of sexual perfection spread out beautifully for Harry to see.
Harry was expecting Draco to choose the expensive new French place near Gringotts, but once they entered the Leaky, Draco walked up to the bar and began to order pints and cottage pies. He then stepped aside with a pointed look so Harry would pay.
are you an Auror?' It was more than a little odd to hear Parkinson ask the same question Hermione had repeated so many times, but Harry was too shocked by the earlier information to do more than stare.
"Thank you for helping me arrange my classroom, Hermione. Your transfiguration skills are much better than mine. I don't know what I would've done without these extra chalkboards."
Grabbing a quill and a piece of parchment, Harry starting writing a letter to the person who he knew could help him get out of this state, could distract him, at least for a little while.
Malfoy grinned and looked as though he was about to laugh, until he saw Harry's serious expression. "Wait, what?"
Harry pushed the door open and walked in silently. "Er-- sorry to bother you, Dra-- Malfoy, but I just wanted to return this. I forgot about it, and then today, when I was going through my books, I found it tucked away. I thought you would like it back."
Harry fumbled through his desk drawers, looking for the Marauder's map. "What on earth are you doing, Potter? We're in an emergency!"
"But that's the thing, isn't it? This didn't just happen. There was a reason, Draco told me! He thought that I didn't love him! I kept him a secret! I should have ignored my conscience, I should have told you lot right away, I just thought you would react badly! And then after, when Neville started dating Theo, and when you and Ginny became friends with Pansy and Blaise, I should have told you all then! It's all too late, Hermione. I've screwed everything up, just like I always do."
Hardy stood up and clenched his eyes shut, trying to adjust to the bright sunlight that shone above him. "Er— yes. I'm fine. What time is it?"
Harry took a few steps back and turned around. He heard Minerva open the door, two shrieking noises following. Minerva scolded the girls, making them get up and follow her to her office. "And put on some proper attire, for goodness sake. This this a place of learning, not a brothel!"
Harry wrinkled his brow. 'I did have the florist send a new centrepiece, but it's mainly irises, peonies—' Ron waved him off again. He did that a lot lately.
Draco made an excuse about giving Potter a tour and then led them to the library where Merryn set down the cake at a little table by the window. The room was stuffy, so Draco pushed open the window to the cool night air. Once Merryn went back to Gabby, Draco called Bippy for coffee and used his wand to flick open a few more windows.
He stretched out on his bed and listened to the faint sound of the shower in the other room. He was glad Potter was hogging the one room with a mirror so he couldn’t give in to the urge to see himself as a purple raccoon. Groaning, he buried his face in his pillow instead.
“What, do you mean, did I enjoy having her locked up and wondering if I’d come down and find her corpse one day?  Honestly, the worst part was worrying that I’d be the one told to do it.”  His face was so pale and grey, he looked on the verge of losing the little he’d eaten at dinner.
"Well that's on you, then," Ron said with a smile as he lifted his pint. "You chose the plants. I just have to figure out who is brewing it and where. Fernsworth can find out how people are getting their hands on it."
That would change tomorrow, Draco reminded himself. This weekend, Hotel Kalmynsi would feel like herself again.
"Wine."  Harry would have loved a whisky, but he needed to keep his wits about him.  He stepped up to the French doors and saw a long garden that eventually fell off into the sea.  He wondered how many years it would take for the sea to claim the whole garden and then the cottage.  A hundred?  A thousand? A million?
It was a small mercy that Robards chose that moment to resume speaking, bringing all eyes back to him.
Right, the whole surname categorising people thing.  "Shit, M—Draco.  I hadn't really thought about it.  Do I think that you're your father?  No.  I wouldn't be here if I thought that."
The inn was surprisingly spacious considering the tiny population it served. There were several wooden booths and rectangular tables of various lengths each lit with a single brass lamp that created a warm yellow glow along the surface of the dark wood. At a long table by the fireplace sat several fit young wizards and a couple of witches. Charlie sat at one end of the table, across from two empty seats.
silk, and silk did not love rain. It seemed such a shame for the poor peddler to have come so far without a chance of a sale. And here Draco was in need of the very things this wizard had in his pocket! Without another thought, Draco opened the door and let the man out of the storm.
Potter tried apologising on Monday, but then gave up and simply sulked.  Glum Potter was rather annoying, but that wasn't Draco's problem.  They weren't friends.
Harry didn’t think he would like being called beautiful, but the word on Draco’s lips made Harry feel cherished in a way he never had before. He almost believed he
Disappointment sunk into Harry’s skin and settled in his stomach. That was apparently the end of that. He looked up to find Malfoy looking him over carefully.
Harry reached forward and covered Draco’s hand with his own. “I’m glad they're doing well, but I hope they do move back. It’d be nice for you to have your friends nearby.” He squeezed Draco’s hand. “I’d hate it if Ron or Hermione moved away.”
He waited until the weekend, exactly two weeks before Christmas, before broaching the subject.  They were at his cottage, as was their Saturday tradition, eating toast with tea as they struggled with a crossword from the newspaper—the Telegraph, because Harry figured it was as Malfoy as a Muggle paper could get.  They were sitting in the conservatory that jutted out into the garden, allowing them the sense of the outdoors without the cold.
hope Potter was peeking, and he certainly did not clench his buttocks to make his bum look more pert.
"Malfoy." Harry nodded his head and raised his glass. "What brings you back to England?" He was proud of how casual he sounded. Best not to betray how eager he was for the reply.
It tasted as if the juice were rotting on his tongue and his mouth was so dry he couldn't speak. He coughed and his throat burned. Draco's mind struggled to comprehend what was happening. Something wrong. The apple. Poisoned! How? Who?
Harry fell to his knees on the rug without question. There in front of him was Malfoy’s crotch, the crisp grey fabric of his trousers hiding Malfoy’s cock inside. With fingers that felt thick and clumsy, Harry undid the button and pulled down the zipper. Malfoy’s cock was still covered in the smooth black material of his pants, but it was clearly full and straining forwards against the fabric.
But avoid him he did. Because every time Harry saw Draco across a room, his cock would stir and his lips would twitch into a little smile without permission. Draco just looked so good with his eyes sparking and his nimble hands gesturing as he spoke. Harry often found himself enchanted by the mere sight of him. And then he would remember Malfoy’s wife and his stomach would rebel. So far, Harry hadn’t seen the wife at all, and Hermione hadn’t mentioned her. Perhaps Draco kept her at home minding their son while he strode through the Ministry or showed up at pub nights that had once been Harry’s way to relax.
Feeling indulgent, Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the soup.  The letters shimmered and soared away to the door at the back of the room.  Blinking, Harry pointed to a pork and rice dish, and more shimmering words flew away.
“You wouldn't—We're . . .  Are we . . .”   Well that didn't come out right .  Harry just wasn't sure what he wanted to ask or say; they'd never really discussed their relationship before.  He tried again.  “There's no one else, right?  You wouldn't . . . you know . . .”
They arrived home hungry and sweaty, so they each took a shower—Draco first as he needed the extra time to dress and do his hair—before they headed into the village. Harry spent most of his time in the shower wanking; flying with Draco always left him half-hard. It was probably his Slytherin side getting off on the exciting competition.
Draco laughed lightly and it charmed Harry completely. 'Yes, mine too. I think Pansy might be nicer to you now that we're together.'
He knew Draco had moved away when the air around him felt empty and cold. It felt like dread, but Harry refused to see it as an omen. He searched the space before him in the growing darkness, but everything was silent and still.
Oh shit. Time to confess. 'Um . . . well, I sometimes send her an owl when I get stuck on a gift or something like that.' Apparently it was the night to end all secrets. 'And sometimes when you're really busy and I know you haven't had a chance to write yourself. I know she worries,' he all but whispered. He briefly considered confessing to using the butter knife in the jam that morning, but decided that maybe it wasn't such a big deal in light of everything else.
"It's easier if we um . . ." Potter slid his arm awkwardly around Draco's waist, as much hovering as holding him. Draco arched his arm up and over Potter's head to settle it across his shoulders. They probably looked like two lovers out for a stroll, and the realisation made Draco's face heat. He was grateful there had been no sign of either Lovegood when they'd arrived.
—because he didn't live there and wasn't part of Arthur's decree—and … well it did seem weird to call her Granger if he was calling her boyfriend by his given name. She called him Draco. Had done for months.
Malfoy was hard. For Harry. A rush of relief ran through Harry as he realised how much he had wanted Malfoy to feel what he felt.
"Oh, thank you. Wasn't sure if the cold or wet was bothering me more." The man shook the water off his hat and then looked up at Draco. He cocked his head to the side and gave Draco a full look-over. "You look like the sort who can wear a fine robe. I have a silver silk one that would look like it was made for you."
His greatest childhood regret was that he had never managed to kill his brother. It hadn't been for lack of trying, but Lucius always managed to eat around the poisoned biscuit or avoid the Cursed broom. Eventually, Claudius had given up on offing Lucius and gaining the Malfoy inheritance for himself. He had moved to France and married a witch with plenty of gold for him to spend. And spend he did. He spent so much that he had to revive his old scheme for securing the Malfoy vaults and estates.
Harry’s steps faltered for only a moment before he recovered. There was nothing wrong with Malfoy seeing him. Was there? Harry wasn’t doing anything wrong. He was just enjoying his morning by walking in the snow. Towards Malfoy. Who was the only other person outside, so who else was Harry meant to walk toward?
Fortifying himself with a deep breath, he continued down the road.  A glimpse of blue to his left showed that he was right on the coast.  Good.  More water and fewer houses.  It was still warm despite the sun nearly setting, and he could feel the ocean breeze against his chest and legs.  It was actually rather nice.  He could almost see the appeal.  Almost.
Harry got up from bed, but didn't head for the shower.  He was approaching Draco with his arms forward.
them.” His eyes narrowed even further. “Although I assume there are plenty more where those came from.”
Draco sighed loudly enough for Potter to hear but did not look up from the poorly written description of a Cursed statue. "What do you want, Potter?"
He sat up, knowing his face was probably as flushed as Draco's and his hair was even more rumpled. There was a stain on the thigh of Draco's trousers that was almost certainly Harry's release, and Harry felt his cheeks grow hotter at the sight of it.
As Draco slowly awoke, he became aware of many oddities at once. The sun was pouring in the window, which it didn’t do until late afternoon. His body was achy, clammy, and cold as if he’d played a long game of Quidditch in the drizzling rain. There was a warm, solid body lying beside him.
Draco moved in so close that Harry was afraid to breathe lest his chest expand and they touch.  "Then I will have to owl in the morning."  Harry didn't get a chance to think about the words because Draco pressed forward and they were touching from their lips down to their thighs.
It was the most awkward meal he'd ever prepared. No one spoke; they all stared at him as he sliced, sprinkled, and stirred. When he set the pasta and sauce on the table with wine and cheese, all of the Weasleys sat in unison and began loading up their plates. Blaise stood at Draco's side and gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. There was chomping, groaning, and murmurs, but no one spoke until the father of the lot had finished. He pushed back his chair and settled his hands across his stomach. For such a slender man, he carried a sizeable middle.
Potter grinned at him as he pocketed the rope. "Brilliant. Meet you there." With a crack, Potter was gone and Draco was left staring at the dark hills against the deep blue sky.
“You, too, Malfoy.  I’m glad that you’re well.”  She sounded genuine.  Her smile brightened her eyes as she shook Draco’s hand in greeting.  Harry stole a glance at Draco’s stunned expression and smiled.  Apparently he hadn’t expected that response.
Leah, who had been sitting with her back to him, turned to face him with wide eyes. “Hermione Granger? She goes there?”
I'm kissing Harry Potter. Harry Potter is kissing me.  And he is a total drunken mess.  Draco took a step back, panting for breath.  “Bedroom, Potter.”  A nod pointed him to a set of stairs that he helped Potter up.  A large door was open at the end of the hall, and Draco led them to it.  The room was definitely the master bedroom and was tastefully decorated in warm browns and creams that brought to mind different types of chocolate.  He all but carried Potter to the large four-poster bed that dominated the airy room.
When Harry made it to the Leaky, Neville, Ron, and Hermione were squeezed at the end of the bar and Hannah was handing over pints.  He'd sent an owl to Draco and could only hope the other man was available and would join him.  He wasn't sure whether Draco was angry with him for his hasty departure the night before.  It certainly hadn't been the way he wanted to end the date, and he could only hope Draco would let them pick up where they'd left off.
But that was all beside the point. However Potter looked, Draco’s priority was to ensure he had a pleasant stay at the hotel and would bring good publicity to counteract some of Skeeter’s damage. He ignored the twisting in his gut and put on a friendly but professional demeanour. “Welcome to Hotel Kalmynsi, Mr Potter.”
Blaise shrugged and started to leave.  He turned back to Draco to say, “You can't keep this up forever.  At least I'm a friend.”  Draco briefly wondered why the last statement was true.
get blood on my trousers,” he warned, but Potter didn’t seem to hear him. Potter didn’t seem to be with him at all.
Parkinson's eyes widened and then narrowed to slits. 'Really? You honestly don't know?' Her tone made him feel tiny and very dim. 'He's in love with you! Why else do you think he's so happy to live with you, share your bed, spend every moment out of work with you? You two act exactly like a couple except for the sex! And why anyone would settle for a sexless relationship is beyond me, but he has. Apparently, in his twisted mind, you're worth it.'
“Yeah,” Potter pushed on. “When you were cooking in her mother’s kitchen with her, you were doing everything by hand. But when we were in your kitchen, you used magic for everything. And just now with the window. You opened this one by hand, but once she left you used your wand.”
The lack of warm feelings between the two of them made it all the stranger that Draco was now staying in
As soon as they were both naked, Harry backed Draco onto the bed.  The sight of his long pale body and silver-blond hair falling back against the crisp white duvet was otherworldly.  He stared for a long moment, committing it to memory and feeling grateful for the existence of Pensieves.  He must have stared too long, because a glance at Draco's face showed a small frown and a furrowed brow.  Harry gave his biggest grin and was glad to see the tension leave the other man's features.
who didn’t know to check their beds at night and their shoes in the morning.” He snickered. “When Roberto’s sister came, I put all sorts of slimy things in her shoes, so when Pansy visited he …” Draco’s smile fell away and his shoulders tensed.
And then they were still, pressed close together on the large, dark bed.  Harry stared at the white ceiling wishing for a light fixture or moulding to occupy his sight as Draco panted against his chest.  Their breathing slowed until the room was as quite as the ceiling was blank, and with nothing left to distract him, the paused thoughts flooded back into Harry's mind.
"What did you find out at Twilfitt and Tattings?" Harry made no indication of leaving, his papers still spread out and his arse in a chair.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at his friend. Ron seemed like he only thought with his stomach, but Harry knew Hermione would always come first for Ron.
How had he not noticed before? Had Potter always looked like that? No. He used to look like a scrappy runt of a boy. But recently? Surely Potter looked exactly the same the first time he had stepped out of the shower and back into their shared bedroom. Draco tried to recall, but he only remembered his irritation with Potter hogging the lavatory when Draco needed it. So many of his memories of Potter were coloured red with anger, obscuring his memory of how Potter had actually looked.
Malfoy turned to face Harry completely. “This year I do.” They stood facing each other for a long moment in which Harry wished he had the courage to close the distance between them and step into Malfoy’s warmth. He looked at Malfoy’s face and found himself appreciating the straight line of his nose and the apples of his high cheekbones. Most of all, he was drawn to Malfoy’s pink lips. He wanted to feel them with his own.
He had made a plan to save Potter from his virginity, but that whole plan had fallen away in the face of something else. Best to just jump in like a Gryffindor and see where things led.
Disgusted, Draco threw back the rest of his mojito and got up.  They didn't even notice.  With a huff, Draco headed to the bar for another drink.
Draco thought of the Gryffindor Patil sister and her alternating screaming and snogging sessions with her Ravenclaw boyfriend. They wouldn’t have lasted a day in these quarters.
And it did explain. Kensa had acted like there was a real threat to the wedding, and now Harry understood why. Even the Death Eaters who had felt Squibs should be sent away from the magical world instead of killed would have been outraged by a Squib marrying a witch. Kensa probably felt that taking Jowan to a Death Eater was like taking a lamb to a lion.
“How can we change the location at the last minute?” The American asked in a pleading voice. “Kensa, please. I know it’s not a big society wedding, but it’s still a lot of people to try to book into a hotel on short notice. And my family already have their portkeys arranged. And...it’s such a pretty place for a wedding.”
Draco stiffened as Potter verbalised his fear. An image filled his mind of falling into mud as Granger called, "Who's the Mudblood, now?"
Aida had grown up in the south of France near her father’s family and then moved to Paris to study cooking, so most of her culinary influences were French. But most of her mother’s family lived in Senegal, and Aida’s annual visits always inspired her to try new dishes. Mother made it quite clear which cuisine she preferred.
When Potter’s friends sent their Patronuses, Draco summoned Kreacher again to tell them Potter was over the worst of the illness but resting.
“Potter, I really must study.” Draco hated seeing the flash of hurt on Potter’s face, but he could not risk telling Potter that his type seemed to be stupid Gryffindors with wild black hair, green eyes, and glasses.
A short chat with Reggie not only provided Harry with a delicious raisin scone, it confirmed that the controlled ingredients not going to St Mungo's were going to Slug and Jigger in Diagon Alley. The shops on Knockturn couldn’t get the Ministry license to carry them, and the little shops scattered around the countryside tended to stick to the most conventional ingredients. Harry sent a Patronus with his findings to Ron.
Perhaps Draco wasn't yet comfortable enough with Hermione to laugh at her nagging. They were more colleagues than mates, and Draco often seemed nervous about offending her on certain topics, like house-elves. Or maybe this was related to Draco's troubles.
Harry woke to a warm, solid presence and the sound of soft breathing. Something hard and slightly tickly was resting on his shoulder, and it only took him a brief moment of confusion before the events of the day before returned to him. He opened his eyes, knowing he would see Draco’s pale hair and his own bed. Seeing the two together did funny things to his stomach.
Gathering all of his courage and knowing there was nothing left to lose, Harry stood from the bed.  The sheet fell away, and Draco watched its descent with interest.  Harry took courage from that and stepped forward until he was close enough to share Draco’s breath.  Draco’s pupils were blown wide with only a thin rim of stormy grey encircling deep pools of blackness.  Harry hoped to hell it was arousal and not fear.
A loud bang pulled Harry from his fantasy and his suddenly-open eyes fell on the wide grey eyes of the object of his thoughts.  Draco—the real one—stood in the doorway, one hand on the doorknob and the other on his wand, staring at Harry in shock.
They were back to staring at each other. Harry was growing to hate the noisy clock and all its ticking.
Harry huffed and sunk into the couch.  The sex was amazing, but Draco was more guarded and quiet than he’d been since Harry’s first weeks in Romania.  They rarely had time alone, and when they did it was spent getting into bed as quickly as possible.  When they were in the company of others, Draco made no effort to seek Harry out, and if Harry forced them together, Draco was polite but distant.  Harry wasn’t sure if they were making progress or not.
Harry stepped forward and peered into the darkened window. In the dim light from the street he could make out a table with neat stacks of clothing and a rack of shirts beside it. It didn’t look any more threatening than Madam Malkin’s, and it might improve Harry’s currently non-existent sex life. He looked at a little sign on the door to confirm the shop was open on Saturdays and then promised himself that he would return in the morning. He told Toby as much.
"You are very noble to defend her, but back to the bit about me fleeing my murderous uncle. You really think they are desperate enough to let me go live with them?"
Harry had wanted to draw Draco into conversation. He would try to think of something to say to him, only to run out of time before Draco finished eating and excused himself from the group. Sometimes Harry would wonder if he should have returned to Hogwarts as well. Late at night, he would imagine taking classes with Draco again but them finally talking and becoming friends.
Harry wanted to laugh. It sounded more like an excuse than a confession. “Did you tell the press I’d be here?” Draco shook his head. “I am the one who chose to come here. And you haven’t even asked me to do an interview or anything. I think you’re a bit shit at using people these days.”
Aida patted Draco firmly on the arm. “Now, if we are done with the hugs and feelings, can I please get some help with preparing for tea. We are expecting another dozen people by then and nothing is made. I don’t mind doing the sandwiches, but I’m not making the petit fours.” She turned to leave before throwing a smile back at Draco. “Unless you want chili macaroons!”
Draco had assumed that his difficulties with making peace with Harry would begin once they spoke. What he hadn’t anticipated was that he would be unable to speak to him at all. When he had sought Harry out in the Auror office, Harry had scooped up a memo, waved it about with some comment about an emergency, and then fled. Three times.
Potter gave him a smile. “For a moment I worried you’d called her here. You know, for the publicity of me being here.”
“Potter.” It wasn’t a greeting, but it certainly didn’t contain the animosity it had held in the past. “Karlsen,” he said with a polite but curt nod of his head. Jens just laughed and stepped into the flat, forcing Malfoy to step back or be smothered.
Teddy and Scorpius scurried around the back yard trying to catch snowflakes on their tongues. Harry had to keep the storm cloud low so that the people in the village wouldn’t see it and wonder why only his cottage was getting a white Christmas, but it was worth the risk to see the two boys laughing and squealing in delight.
Potter smiled. "Can we try again tonight? We didn't actually get much practice in last night, even though we made a good start."
Draco opened his eyes and saw Potter with a quill resting against the book in his lap. He was equal parts smug and disturbed than he knew Potter so well.
Harry shook his head and tossed the paper aside. “Robards is big on time off. He doesn’t like any Auror getting too attached to a particular case and fixating. I have the weekend off, and technically my part of the case is solved. We found where they were growing and caught people involved. Maybe not everyone, but anyone else is probably in hiding at the moment. Better to wait a couple of days anyway.”
“Zmei. It is what we call the creatures there. Dragons.” Harry nodded, increasingly aware that he was in a foreign country, especially when he bit into a sausage that was nothing like Mrs. Weasley’s. The witch seemed to notice his discomfort. “The people there are from all over, often from countries with their own Zmei: Britain, New Zealand, Hungary. The village, Bârlog, is not like anywhere else in Romania. Everyone is a foreigner in Bârlog.” The way she said the last, Harry almost wondered if it were a local expression.
Harry nodded and gestured to the en suite.  Draco took Harry’s hand in his own sticky one and led him to the bathroom, where he started the shower.  “We can clean up from today’s adventure before we continue.” He stepped into the water, and Harry discovered that—impossibly—Draco Malfoy could get sexier.
Then a single flake of snow fell on Malfoy’s full lower lip. Malfoy’s tongue snuck out to catch it, but the flake melted instantly against the heat.
And instead of sitting on boards and committees, he imagined himself working as a Curse Breaker for Gringotts or the Ministry, or even for the eldest Weasley’s new company. He would come back from a long day of work feeling tired but satisfied and find his lover at work in the kitchen. They would have elves, of course, but Draco rather liked the fantasy of having a lover baking in nothing but an apron. Maybe there would be a dusting of flour through his wild black hair.
Harry blinked himself from his fantasy as he realised that Draco’s plate was empty and he was delicately wiping his fingertips on his napkin. The meal was over. Now Draco would leave. Harry wished he’d planned more courses.
The boy—what was his name? Scorpius!—began to sob as he nodded. "I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Please don’t hurt me."
Draco wrinkled his nose. “I’d gladly take her marks, but I’m sure I could find a better boyfriend.” Draco would love to claim he had no idea why he had added the last bit, but he knew he was gauging Potter’s reaction. Some masochistic little part of him had to know if Potter could ever return Draco’s newfound interest.
Once Draco was still, Potter took his hands from Draco’s chest. “Oh no, you don’t. This time you are taking it easy.” Mercifully, Potter got up and carefully propped Draco up with an extra pillow. Draco’s relief was short lived as Potter grabbed a tray and then came right back to the bed. He sat up against the wall and stretched out his legs alongside Draco’s body with only the duvet and Potter’s jeans between them.
The next evening, they stood looking over a grassy field on the edge of the Lovegood estate. The grass was untended and had grown long with clusters of wild flowers in bright yellows, pinks, and purples. The field was bordered by a bramble hedge on one side and a small valley on the other. It was unkempt, wild, and free, and Draco had to admit that it suited Luna perfectly.
He took time off. Of course he did. He had taken days to help Ron and Hermione move house and again to help prepare for their wedding. He’d taken a week off when Mrs Tonks had gotten very ill and needed help with Teddy. And he’d been forced to take time off after a couple of raids had landed him in St Mungo’s. But Harry had never taken time off just for himself, just for fun. It just never seemed like the right time.
Luckily Potter’s face showed everything. He arched his eyebrows in surprise, but there was no sign of disgust. “Oh really?” And there was interest. Clear interest.
"No! These are Scorpius’s favourite! He’s already so sad that Astoria can’t come for Christmas. I have to at least bake her biscuits!" He tried to pick up a measuring cup but sent it toppling to the floor where it shattered. He looked on the verge of tears as he stared blearily at the little shards of glass around his feet. "Why hasn’t someone invented a Portkey that pregnant witches can use?!"
Sothman's eyes widened before narrowing.  “Well, here it is,” he growled, throwing a hand toward Draco's desk.
Draco closed his eyes, and when he opened them again he was in his bed—or rather the bed he used—in Ron's attic bedroom. The sun had dropped and gave off little more than a glow from the pink horizon. Voices carried from below.
Harry stood alone in his garden staring at the hedge that lined the back fence. He barely noticed the shooting star overhead or the distant barking of their neighbour's dog. His dry eyes stung when he remembered to blink again. He tried to arrange his thoughts, but managed little more than
Everywhere there were people laughing loudly and shouting at people across the room as they carelessly dropped food to the floor or set drinks onto wood surfaces without coasters. Draco hoped Pansy had strong protective Charms on her grandmother's coffee table; there really was no Charm to remove moisture rings without damaging the wood's finish.
Draco wrapped a large hand around Harry’s cock and pumped him firmly, even to the point of losing the rhythm of his hips.  When Harry came with a howl, Draco began pounding into him in earnest until he came shuddering inside him.
Malfoy. Suddenly all the watching and the unencouraged attempts at conversation made sense. Rather than panic at realising he fancied his former rival, Harry felt a great relief. He might be mad, but at least he finally understood his own madness. And perhaps he should have been embarrassed at how long it took him to figure out—because surely Hermione knew already—but he never claimed to be brilliant in the romantic feelings department.
“Least once a week.  Sometimes I freeze the pies for him to take away, other times he eats in.  Every now and then he brings company.”
'You should have asked me about the catering.' Flintridge had moved to their side and was speaking over Harry's arm. 'I know the owner. I could have gotten you a discount.'
Draco had never been good at losing, but when he and Potter came in third out of ten pairs he found he didn't care. Maybe it was because they were still given a prize. Maybe it was because he was so grateful he hadn't fallen. Or maybe it was because Potter was still holding him when it was over, beaming at him before kissing his lips.
He shivered.  How on earth could Pot—Harry—say his name like that?  Unbidden images of the night before rushed through his mind and he felt himself growing hard.  “Enough, you.  You stink of sweat and I'm hungry.  For food!” he clarified at Potter's leer.
legs. Harry kissed Draco’s lips roughly. “I fucking hate you with every fibre of my being,” he repeated, glaring into his eyes before pushing himself off of Draco. “Get out of my head!” He shouted before turning around and marching towards his office, leaving Draco dumbstruck in the dark, empty corridor.
"Hermione-- there are tons of other professors here. If something happens, we'll be able to handle it."
"Oh, sorry to bother you, Harry," said the voice of Neville from the other side of his desk as Harry placed another book onto the large pile that had accumulated on his desk.
"Hung up on Malfoy. Look, I get it, but if you ever change your mind, feel free to ring me up. I'm always in the mood for a nice shag." Harry nodded his (completely scarlet) head and gave Hermione a look of panic.
"So," Hermione said as she sat down on one end of Harry's love-seat. "What's going on between you and Blaise?"
Harry let out a fake laugh before grabbing his cloak and standing up. "Well, nice to catch up, but I've got to start organizing my classroom. I've got a delivery of Grindylows   arriving today for my third years."
With the exception of Neville, the Three Broomsticks was empty. Madame Rosmerta sat behind the bar reading the Daily Prophet, and jumped as Harry entered.
"Harry, no. It's not your fault. Sometimes things just happen," Hermione said, putting an arm around Harry's shoulders.
Harry sighed. "For fuck's sake, Ronald. Alright, thank you, Luna. I'm sorry for bothering you so late."
Harry and Blaise sat at the bar of the Leaky Cauldron not thirty minutes later, each downing shots of firewhiskey by the handful. Harry could already feel the buzz of alcohol in his body, relieving him of his worries. He felt his head become light as he leaned over and planted a hand on Blaise's thigh. "You look really good— is that a new shirt?" He asked, his words drawing on longer than usual due to his drunken state.
Harry smiled softly at the memory. It was years ago, nearly a year after the war had ended, and he and Draco had started dating about two months prior. Harry grabbed the napkin and left his classroom, taking the moving staircases towards the dungeons.
Harry fumed. "I did not shag someone else," he said stepping forward, forcing Draco to back up. They continued this movement until Draco's back was against the marble wall. "In fact, I couldn't shag them because you were all I could think about, infecting me like a bloody parasite!" Harry's rage consumed him, and the corners of his vision went red as he pushed his body up against Draco’s.
. If there is one reason to believe that you and Malfoy can't handle yourselves, if I hear one insult thrown, you will both be out of a job before you can say 'credentials.' Do I make myself clear?"
"As if you haven't sworn for the exact same reason," Harry grinned. The two beamed at each other for a moment-- it almost felt like old times... Until Hermione cleared her throat.
"Harry, you can't possibly think that we didn't know that you and Draco were dating. You weren't that secretive. Ginny and I saw you holding hands or snogging in the booths in the back of the Leaky or at Hog's Head at least five times a few years ago."
"Harry, please listen to me, we don't have much time until Neville comes back," Draco said with a hurried, quiet tone.
"I honesty didn't believe you could be so reckless! Four students reported hearing you shouting at Malfoy in the corridors three nights ago, and now, I hear from Argus that he caught you drunk in the school grounds last night with Granger! What has gotten into you? Did you not understand the depth of our conversation on the first day of school?"
No Pepper-Up potion could have compared to the thrill that Harry felt after hearing those words. Those two simple words that made Harry's stomach flutter and his head spin. He felt as though he were walking on air as he taught his classes that day. His mood seemed to be reflected by his students, who all laughed at his terrible jokes, and smiled all throughout class— even the ones who were failing.
"Minerva! What happened? What "crisis?" You've been so busy chastising me that you didn't tell me what is going on!"
Harry Potter sat at the dining table of his shared flat, which resided just outside of Hogsmeade. Ginny and Ron, his flat-mates, were both at the Burrow for the morning, before they would head off to their job as a Professional Quidditch Player and Ministry Employee, respectively
They didn't fight during that entire, though admittedly short, conversation. It was progress. Harry grinned to himself the entire way back to his office.
. We're allowed to leave whenever we want... except during our work hours, of course. You could easily leave for a weekend to see Pansy."
"Er— no, sorry, Dra— Professor Malfoy, I was just walking by and I swear there was this— this gust of wind that was so strong it knocked the mug right out of my hand!" Harry swore internally— how had he ended up with terrible lying skills after getting out of so many dangerous situations each year?
Ron merely nodded his head and closed his eyes. Figuring that Ron would be fine, Harry apparated to the outside of Luna Lovegood's apartment. Since she lived on the first floor, all that Harry would have to do is knock on her bedroom window and grab the keys from Ginny. Except for the fact that he forgot which apartment was hers, this was an excellent plan.
Harry smiled grimly. "I bet once he's on the scene, his instincts will kick in. I'm sure he'll do fine."
"—And Draco hasn't been staring at me. Did you see him at the luncheon yesterday? He wouldn't even look at me, much less stare at me."
"Oh, Witherwings is doin' great! He loves playin' with Fang! They're good friends, yeh know? And I'm alrigh'," Hagrid replied. "How 'bout we go fin' Scrubby? I bet he's just dyin' to meet e'ryone."
"Oh no, you didn't see her in our Hogwarts days. She would get so pissed, I think she actually pissed herself once. Hermione had to help her out of her wet clothes," Harry laughed.
The two professors lead the group of students into the forest towards Scrubby's bog. When they arrived, it was scattered with bones from many different animals, and Scrubby sat in the center of the mass. The students all gasped and backed away, trying not to get close to the Kappa.
"Yes, I know, I'll be out of a job before I can sat 'credentials,'" Harry sighed. "Believe me, Professor, I understand."
"Sure, thank you, Long—Neville." Draco reached for the container, and Harry let him take it as he continued to stare at him. He didn't know whether he was surprised in a positive or negative aspect. Draco bit into a muffin and let out a moan of delight. "These are wonderful, did you make them?" He asked Neville.
"Save it, Potter." Draco marched out of his office and slammed the door so hard that it knocked his cup off the table, spilling tea all over the carpet.
As Harry led his students down to the edge of the forest, he heard many complaints. They all moaned about being too cold and needing to get a thicker cloak if they were going to spend more time outside of the castle. Harry rolled his eyes and placed a heating charm on his cloak before continuing to lead his students down to the forest. Once they had reached the edge, he waited for Hagrid to arrive with his students. Then they would travel in one large pack towards the small bog that housed the Kappa.
"Honeydukes sounds amazing, do you mind if I come along?" Harry heard Malfoy say as he was waving goodbye to Rosamerta. He ground his teeth as he left the Three Broomsticks and took the walk up to Hogwarts castle.
"Yes, Professor. How am I supposed to complete an essay on the properties of bat eyes if I have to try out a whole new team?"
Harry leaned over to Blaise "How is it that he's becoming a healer again?" he mumbled, much to the delight of Blaise.
Harry sat down next to his best friend and handed her a steaming cup of cocoa. "What do you mean? There's nothing going on between us," he said. "We rarely talk anymore now that school's started."
"Shit!" Harry shouted. "For fuck's sake, Malfoy!" Harry stood up and rushed out the door, chasing after Draco. He had just seen him turn around the corner when he reached the hallway. He ran down the corridor, calling out Malfoy's name. When he caught up to the other man, he placed a hand on his shoulder, but Malfoy shrugged it away, wiping away tears that were forming in his eyes.
"Are we going or not? I've got a class to teach in an hour, and I would appreciate a shower so that my students don't smell the gallon of alcohol that I consumed last night."
"Harry turned around as Malfoy sat down in the chair next to him. His robes were an emerald green, with a line of crystals going along each seam. The hem was down to the floor, and gave him a floating effect. Harry loved those robes, as he had told Draco several times in the past. Which meant that he had most likely worn them for the sole purpose of messing with Harry's head. Underneath, you could see that he was wearing a black turtleneck with a silver chain around his neck.
"You can't even offer to help me up? Honestly, Potter, you think you're so much better than everyone, all "I'm the chosen one" and "I defeated Voldemort." Well you know what, Potter? We've all done important things with our lives, but you don't see us bragging about it and pushing people over if they're in our way!" Shouted Draco from the floor, forcing Harry's eyes open with his voice.
were good at some point of their lives, too. Not all of them wanted that life!" Draco stood up, slamming his cup down on the coffee table.
"Hmm," Harry agreed, moving his hand upwards and inwards on Blaise's thigh. "We should get out of here," he mumbled into their ear, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a fistful of coins.
The class remained silent. "I thought not," Harry sighed. "Alright, you're all dismissed early. Don't forget about the quiz on Monday! I expect at least an Acceptable from each of you!"
"Well come on in, make yourself comfortable. I reckon this conversation might take a while," Harry said.
Malfoy handed Harry his potion and opened the door for him. Harry stepped outside and Malfoy started to close the door, before peeking his head out.
Harry, Hagrid and the students watched the Kappa for nearly twenty minutes, until it eventually ventured off to go feed. "Alright, students, I think that's enough for today. Professor Hagrid and I will lead you back up to the school grounds, and then my class will come with me back up to the castle," Harry said, waving his students along, bringing them out of the Kappa's bog area. As they reached the castle, Harry started to lead his class down the corridor to the Defence classroom when Malfoy walked out of the staff lounge and walked straight into Harry, nearly knocking him over.
"Well it doesn't matter now, does it?! We had a crisis, and you were gone! Do you know what it's like to have a crisis when one of your best professors is missing? It's horrifying! Why did you not inform me that you were leaving the school grounds?"
Harry stifled a laugh, which earned him a smack on the back of the head. "I could say the same to you, Potter. Do button up your shirt." Harry looked down and noticed that, in his haste, he had not done up the top three buttons on his shirt, leaving his bare chest exposed.
"Harry, tell Malfoy to stop staring at you like he wants to rip your clothes off-- HEY DRACO! STOP EYE FU--"
Harry took a deep breath and sat down in the furthest seat from Malfoy, which sat him down next to Madame Pince, who was in a pleasant mood since there were no students messing up  her library yet.
Also, I know it’s been like 6 months since I’ve updated literally any of my fics, but unfortunately I’ve been a) stressed from school and b) in a huge block for everything.
Harry grinned and spun around to face his large friend. "I'm great Hagrid! How are you? How are Witherwings and Fang?"
"Alright, Ron, whatever you say," Harry grimaced as they reached the bottom of the stairs of their flat. They only had to go up one flight, thankfully. "I'm going to go onto your other side so you can hold on to the railing while we climb. Do not fall over right now.
"You can defeat a Kappa by tricking it into bowing. The water from its head will spill out and weaken it."
Harry thanked Rosmerta and made his way towards Neville's booth. "Hello, Nev," he said as he sat down.
Harry remembered the day Draco left very clearly. He frequently found himself reliving that memory on lonely nights or in melancholy moments.
"Sure, Hermione. As if you didn't know long ago that you fancy women." Harry grinned as he helped Hermione take down the rod that held up the drapes.
"Oh, it's no problem. I always keep a stash of ingredients in my cupboard. Come on, I'll show you," Malfoy replied.
Harry woke up with a start. The wind had died down and he heard whispers coming from all around him. "Professor Potter, are you alright?" A student asked.
"Well it hardly felt like it! You didn't tell anyone that we were together! I had told Pansy, Greg, Blaise, I even told my mother about us!"
"He hasn't got classes until noon, so he's sleeping in. Honestly, don't you ever pay attention? He literally mentioned this at least three times during the dinner."
"I suppose, but what if something happens to someone in my house? How am I supposed to live knowing that I wasn't there for a student if they get hurt or sick or--"
"Well, Byrne, I'll let you in on a little secret: I was once in the exact position that you are in now, except my professors were not nearly as nice. My suggestion is that you focus on your schoolwork first, and book the quidditch pitch for the earliest time on a Saturday morning."
"Well, that's why McGonagall made me Transfiguration professor, and not you. Now what do you plan to do about these drapes?"
"What is the meaning of this, Harry? You leave campus, without letting anyone know, to what? Go 'hook up' with some villager? How unprofessional! How completely irresponsible! Do you know how much you alone have put me through, Potter? I'm surprised that I haven't died of a heart attack since the day you stepped foot in this castle!"
Harry was back in his office nearly twenty minutes later, taking off his cloak and throwing it to its usual place on the ground next to the door. He sat down at his desk, ready to work on lesson plans for the next week when Professor McGonagall barged in to his office.
"Goodnight." Harry groaned as he apparated back to their shared flat. Upon arrival, he found that Ron was missing, and the door was wide open. Harry swore to himself as he entered their flat and found Ron asleep on the couch. He closed the door and went to his room, where he collapsed onto his bed.
"It's S.P.E.W., Harry, you know that. And no, I'm perfectly content with the new laws that the ministry made concerning House-Elf Work Environments."
Once they finally got to their door, Harry reached into his cloak pocket to find that he had forgotten his keys. "D'you have your keys?" He asked Ron.
"Draco, wait! I'm sorry, you're right. It was unfair to assume that everyone you care about was evil. I know that you're not--"
"I'm very aware of how early it is, Harry. And it's called a Hangover Potion-- I think you know a thing or two about them," Hermione scowled.
"Of course! Who else is going to take care of my plants while I'm away? It's not like we have any roommates. And most of them are for the healers at St. Mungo's. They rely on them for their antidotes and medicines."
Blaise leaned in close to Harry's ear. "I wouldn't mind seeing you in--or rather out-- of wet clothes, Potter," he murmured.
The night ended not a mere twenty minutes later, after Ron nearly passed out on the table. "I'm sorry," he said again as Harry basically carried him back to their flat. "I didn't mean to ruin the fun, I've just been really tired lately."
"That little—!" Hermione's face turned a deep shade of scarlet. "She promised she would t tell anyone! And besides, we were sloshed! And... experimenting..."
Harry opened the container and smoke came out, rolling off the cranberry muffins as if they had just come out of the oven. "Thank you! They look wonderful," Harry said as he lifted one out of the container and set it down on a napkin as he closed the container. "So what did you want to meet about?" Harry asked before biting into the muffin.
"Did you see what Malfoy decided to wear? Very unprofessional, he's hardly wearing proper wizarding robes," Hermione whispered.
"Why were you and Professor Malfoy so awkward? Aren't you two friends? Sally said that she saw you two holding hands in Hogsmeade once."
nearly three months after the breakup, when Ron and Ginny stepped in. They had come to his apartment to check up on him, and they found him laying in the middle of the floor, surrounded by glass and metal and wooden fragments of destroyed furniture, clutching the butterfly magnet that had ended Harry's relationship— that had ruined his life. The only piece of Draco he had left. They helped him take a bath, put him in new clothes, and started packing up what was left of his belongings. They helped him move into the empty bedroom of their flat, and fed him, and gave him space, helping him adjust to this new reality, even though he had not told them about his relationship at all, and he thought, at the time, that they had no idea what had happened. They had saved him.
Harry didn't stay at the luncheon for long, as he found himself sweating every time he looked over at Malfoy. It's not as though he was nervous by Malfoy's presence, it was just that every time he looked in Malfoy's direction, the blond was staring right back at him. So Harry did the first thing that came to mind-- he ran.
"Er, no, it's alright. I can snog-- wash this up with a vanishing charm. Didn't really like the tea anyways. A bit too sweet for my liking," Harry said, rushing his words before fixing the mug and vanishing the spilt tea. Once the tea was vanished, Harry stood up and backed away, forcing his eyes not to become glassy as he looked at Draco, standing in the doorway, Klein right behind him now.
"What do you mean, flirting? I have never flirted with Ginny in my entire life! Well, besides sixth year, but that's not the point! In case you didn't realize, Malfoy, I've only ever been interested in dating—"
"I'm saying, these girls are in seventh year, they're clearly in love, and they're separated by their different houses. They should not be punished for wanting to see each other— even if it was inappropriate. Very innapropriate," Harry exaggerated, giving the girls a pointed look. "Give them, say, one week's worth detention. You don't need to write their parents, they've learned their lesson— haven't you, girls?"
“Shut up.” Draco peered from behind his arms. His anger finally overcoming his fear. “Shut your mouth. You don’t know a thing about him.” He sat up and put his arms down. “You wine about his father but you can’t accept the fact that he’s his own person. And who are you to judge anyone for who they love? I can’t help that any more than you can help loving anyone else.”
"Good. I will see you both at the feast." McGonagall turned around and left the two professors in her wake.
Hermione slapped on his back as he choked, relieving him from his fit. He gasped for air, "Thanks," he wheezed.
"I'm sorry, Irma, I must be going, I've got to finish preparing for the students," Harry said, interrupting the librarian in the middle of her sentence about the 'retched' little first years' eating her library.
McGonagall looked at Harry with aggravation. "You think that sneaking out past curfew, not telling anyone where you are, and causing a manhunt isn't worthy of punishment?!"
Hermione sighed. "No problem," She said, taking the bottle from him and taking a few light sips. "I don't know how I'll be able to stay away from Pansy for so long," she admitted, handing the bottle back to Harry.
"It's fine," Blaise said. "Do you want to watch a film, or something? I've got all the muggle classics."
"Let's," Blaise agreed as Harry placed his money on the counter. "Keep the change," he told Rosamerta, not taking his eyes off of Blaise. They stumbled out of the Three Broomsticks, Harry gripping on to Blaise's arm as they apparated two of them back to their flat.
Harry watched Hermione blankly, not believing his own ears. Draco Malfoy, possible the one true love of his life, had been staring at him longingly? It was unbelievable. Harry couldn't accept it: what Harry had done, making Draco feel unloved, hiding him from his friends, that was unforgivable. There was no way on earth that Draco Malfoy could forgive him for all that he had put him through.
Fortunately, I’m getting back in the groove of things, and my exams are finished on Tuesday, so I’ll have a whole month of free time where I can write (hopefully) until summer session starts! Yaaaaay!
"I can assure you, Professor Potter, that I am not going mad," Said the voice of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall from the doorframe. "Quite the opposite, actually. I feel very secure with this choice. But let me warn you now— any issues that you may have with Professor Malfoy—
Two days had passed since Harry's last interaction with Draco. He had spent his time wallowing around in his quarters whenever he wasn't in his classroom. His usual work-hard, play-hard attitude had disappeared, and he was miserable while teaching. He had skipped his second meal that day when Hermione barged into his room with a bottle of firewhiskey.
"Uh, yeah, bye." Draco returned into the lounge and Harry felt a faint flush rise up his neck as he lead his students back to the classroom.
"That's right. First Defence teacher to have the job for over one schoolyear in the past fifty years. I hope it stays that way."
"Oh, sorry, Ha-- Professor Potter," Draco said as he grabbed on to Harry shoulders in attempt to stop him from falling. Their eyes met and for a moment Harry forgot where he was.
"Good. Now, I've got to go talk to Mr. Malfoy about this as well-- seeing as neither of you know how to behave yourselves, I suggest that you stay away from each other until you learn to handle your temper."
As Hermione turned away from Harry, he saw her smile to herself. Harry let out an over dramatic gasp. "You're not dating Parkinson, are you? Why is it that most of my friends are dating one of Malfoy's friends?"
"They did even better than the O.W.L. students! Every single Hogwarts student taking their N.E.W.T.s passed. And guess who got the highest scores?"
Harry knew he should have kept his mouth shut. His mouth was always getting him in trouble, flapping away with no input from his brain. But before his brain was any the wiser, he leaned around his protective plant and asked, “Are you discussing Draco Malfoy’s hotel?”
Some of his earlier panic returned as he wondered how content Draco would really be to wait. 'Presents are after desert,' he teased, trying to buy some time.
Well two could play at that game.  Harry could ogle Malfoy's broad shoulders and pale skin.  He could run his eyes over his flat stomach and—Harry's thoughts were interrupted as his eyes fell between Draco's legs.
But Harry couldn't bear the thought of Christmas without him.  He thought back to the year before and how he had been the only person over the age of six not in a couple.  Charlie and Alin had flown in from Romania, Ginny was in town with her new boyfriend, and everyone else was the same picture of domestic bliss he faced every Sunday.  And he'd been alone, nursing an eggnog with Firewhisky and a huge crush on Draco Malfoy.
As they fell in step with the evening commuters and holiday shoppers, Harry could only notice the way Draco’s cashmere fingers wrapped around his own cold ones. Soft. Warm. So much better than wearing his own gloves.
was a git to us in school, but I’m actually kind of worried about this bad press. Hermione really liked the place. I did, too. Not just the cake.” He glared at Harry. “I know what you think, but I’m serious! Hermione actually relaxed there after a day or two. It’s so beautiful and peaceful. She actually went to the beach without a book or a report or anything. She just enjoyed herself.”
Malfoy completely missed Harry's attempt to lighten the mood.  "Yes, actually.  Just as I was raised to define a person by their family, I was raised to do so by what they wore.  Clothing can share obvious information like one's profession and rank, but it can also provide more subtle information about cultural norms, wealth, and connections."  Malfoy's eyes fell to the floor, and Harry was relieved to be free of their intensity.  "I can't simply get dressed in the morning without being aware that I am making a deliberate statement."
“Draco!” He didn’t care if he revealed his position to his attackers. He needed Draco to find him. Two spells zinged by as he crawled back to where he’d felt Draco fall. His fingers met hair and frantically he ran his hands over Draco’s face and chest. Movement. Breathing.
"Days. Today is Thursday and you bit the apple on Tuesday." Harry stared at his fingers as he pulled at the grass. "We'd given up. I was just saying goodbye to you before we sent the coffin to your mother."
“Draco Malfoy! He was talking with Eric at security. Looked like he was having his wand weighed and getting a guest pass.” Ron leaned against the thin partition that separated their cubicles looking curious instead of suspicious. It was amazing what a few years could do. “I wonder what he’s here for. Wasn’t he in Italy or something?”
"That's fine, Potter. Apparently the Ministry thinks nothing of ruining my social calendar for three weeks for the sake of their propaganda."
When the waitress appeared, Draco ordered for them both, more to tease Harry for his predictability than as an act of courtesy. Harry stuck out his tongue as soon as the girl had turned away. 'You think you're so funny.' His smile ruined his attempt at haughtiness.
testimony in Draco Malfoy’s favour.” She had that same look in her eye that Ron got during a chess game. She was enjoying this.
Potter’s face was flush and his eyes were hazy as if he were half in a trance or dream. "Yeah. I think I'll be relaxed if you're sucking on me." Potter handed him the tube of lube again, and Draco managed to keep the lube in his hand this time. He sucked Potter’s cock back into his mouth as he gently ran a slick finger over Potter’s hole.
He returned to the living room and his eyes found Draco immediately. He was standing near the bar the caterers had set up with Padma and a tall man who must be her boyfriend. Could it be Padma? Was the unhealthy part that she was with another man? Draco had seemed worried that Harry might fancy Padma. Was he jealous? Fighting down panic, Harry forced himself to be still and observe the three.
Harry felt his cheeks heat, and Draco must have seen it because his posture tightened and his eyes darkened.  He leaned in close so that Harry could almost taste the wine on his breath when he spoke in a low growl.  "I can make you chant my name."
'The owl mug,' Draco called after him, as if Harry didn't know that Draco liked the bigger mug on weekends.
He silently finished bundling up against the cold and led Draco to the supply cupboard that housed the Auror brooms with built-in Notice-Me-Not Charms.
Instead he asked how Potter was going to manage the project whilst working as an Auror. It was well known that Potter had been accepted into the Aurors—skipping the official training—immediately after their eighth-year. He had basically been an Auror in the months between the Dark Lord's fall and the start of eighth-year: chasing down the remaining Death Eaters at Shacklebolt's side.
A flash of heat ran through Harry’s body and he scolded himself to stay calm. “Now that we’ve established I’m in the right place, how about you let me in? Your sign says you’ve been open for two minutes, and I’m still stuck on the pavement.” Harry caught a glimpse of genuine amusement on Malfoy’s face before he turned to lead Harry into the shop.
Draco may have had a genteel upbringing, but even he had touched a sheep, and it hadn't felt like Potter's jumper.  “It doesn't feel like wool.”
Draco understood. Death’s Mask was rarely lethal, but the few deaths were almost always the elderly. Pomfrey was no spring chicken. “Patil,” he whispered, distracting her so that Pomfrey could check on Abbott one last time, “Pomfrey is at greater risk than any of us.”
“The place is good,” Ron had said with a shrug when Harry told him about the newest bookings. “Most people wanted to holiday there and were just waiting for an excuse. Can’t go to the Death Eater place because it looks bad, but once you can call it the Squib place, you can go again.”
Harry followed orders and sat quietly on the stool. No sooner had he settled himself then Draco became a flurry of motion. He flicked his wand and the stove came to life just as a pan came sailing into place. A silent
When he put it like that, what choice did Harry have? He had a finger inside of Draco’s heat without even registering that he’d dug his lube out of the nightstand drawer. Nothing mattered more than being inside Draco’s body. All of him. He added two and then three fingers, wishing he could put his whole hand inside. He wanted to taste him, but his tongue would have to wait for another time. Nothing could convince him to wait another moment before sinking his cock into Draco’s arse. He pulled his fingers out and gave those perfect globes of flesh a firm squeeze.
“You know,” Harry cleared his throat. “Um, people usually bring dates to weddings, right? I’m sure my invitation said plus one.”
Draco picked up the Curse quill report and pretended to read. "Goodbye, Vane. Some of us have work to do." Now wasn't the time to reflect on whether he and Potter were actually friends, and he certainly wasn't doing it with Vane around.
By morning, the coughing had lessened, although Potter was still feverish. Draco felt achy and drained from a night of no sleep. His eyes burned, and his own throat was scratchy and dry, but he refused to even consider that he might be getting ill as well. He called for Kreacher and ordered cold soup which he spooned into Potter’s mouth between babbling fits about potions ingredients and giant spiders. Draco didn’t want to know what was going on in Potter’s mind.
He didn't need to look up from his book to know it was Pansy who had marched out of his Floo and across his wood floor onto the Persian rug that was the centrepiece of his living room. He knew the sound of those ridiculous heels she wore whenever she wasn't in the garden, and he could tell from the rhythm she tapped into his floor that the apology he was due would not be offered.
After they had eaten, Draco led Harry to the alley behind the pub. Instead of opening the passageway to Diagon Alley, Draco shoved Harry against a wall for the second time that night and kissed him.
Harry didn’t … did he? Sure, he might make a comment if something reminded him of Draco, but that was rare. Well maybe not
The first real snow had fallen the night before, and the grounds were covered in glimmering white. Harry flicked an Impervius Charm at his shoes, which were already growing cold and damp as he strode through the snow. He couldn’t remember how he had managed winter at Hogwarts as a first-year when he hadn’t known such practical spells.
Kreacher appeared three times a day with meals that made Potter’s face light up. Clearly the elf knew Potter’s favourites and had little interest in serving anything else. Draco and Potter would eat their meals in silence and then return to their studies: Draco at the round table where they ate and Potter stretched out on the sofa. The only noise would be a silvery Patronus from one of Potter’s friends or the hum of the wireless that Potter kept tuned to a station that played far too much Celestina Warbeck. Frankly, any Warbeck was too much.
Potter dragged him down onto the bed with him.  “I want you, Draco.  Merlin, you're so hot!”  He was slurping, nipping, and biting at Draco's neck and collarbone.  Potter's hands wrapped around him and grabbed his arse cheeks, pulling them apart and up through his trousers.  “Ugh!  Your arse is amazing.  Feels as good as it looks.  Want it.”  Potter was arching off the bed so their groins rubbed together.  Draco was at a loss.  Should he stay and let Potter—a ridiculously drunk Potter—fuck him as planned, or should he leave the man to sober up?  A few minutes later, the choice was made for him.
'Told you he was your boyfriend.' Ron had come up beside him and was looking as smug as Draco. 'And people say
Harry slammed his hand down on the table but remained silent. Harry had wanted to file a report with the Aurors, but Ron had refused on the grounds that it would make the Burrow a crime scene and open to various Ministry personnel they couldn't trust. Harry had suggested Draco move in with him—and hadn't that done ridiculous things to Draco's stomach—but that idea was shot down by seven angry Weasleys.
“I filled out some of this paperwork for you.  If you'd like to look them over and sign them, I can file them for you.”  He gave her a sycophantic smile, and she smiled back.   She really is thick.
Wasn't their close friendship proof of what a good couple they would make? Surely that gave him more rights than Flintridge or anyone else.
“This kitchen is Aida’s domain. I lured her back from Paris with the promise of carte blanche. She cooks what she wants and I just pay for the ingredients. She’s usually quite traditionally French, offering things like mussels, baked Camembert, duck breast, or the best soufflé you’ve ever had. But then she’ll visit her grandmother in Senegal and Chicken Yassa will pop up on the menu. But no matter what she makes, you can be sure it will be delicious. Since it’s just us tonight, I was going to let her set the menu. Is there anything you don’t eat?” Harry shook his head and Draco smiled. “Perfect. She loves free reign.”
What if Draco's mystery witch was a mystery wizard? So far as Harry knew, Draco hadn't dated anyone since he'd taken Parkinson to the Yule Ball, so Harry didn't actually know his preferences. In fact, Draco was completely silent on the subject of who or what he found attractive. Harry couldn't even name a Quidditch player who Draco thought was fit.
Harry thought hard as he ran his finger around the rim of one of Hermione’s prize tea cups, producing a soft singing sound. Could he? Could he just forget everything Malfoy had ever said about Harry’s parents and friends? Could he forget that he’d nearly killed Ron and let Death Eaters into Hogwarts?
“It’s blackberry flavoured champagne.” If Potter didn’t know what champagne was, Draco was going to Floo McGonagall that instant and demand culinary arts be added to the Hogwarts curriculum.
Draco shook the past from his mind.  There was nothing to be done for it now.  Tonight his focus was to create a beneficial alliance.
"The Burrow!" Blaise was beaming at his own idea. "Claudius would never look for you there, and there will be people there who can protect you."
Draco groaned as he dropped his head to the table. "Did you just come back to get me to make you lunch? You greedy bastard!" A thump sounded by his ear, and he sat up to find a perfect green apple.
Once the coughing was loud enough to interrupt his train of thought about Charms altering emotional states, he nearly shouted at Potter to get a glass of water. The words were on the tip of his tongue when he saw the purple tinge to the bridge of Potter’s nose.
The door swung open to reveal two heads of wild black hair. Harry and Merryn jostled each other as they both pressed forward to embrace him. Merryn mumbled something about “daft” and “knocking” into his shoulder, and Draco just smiled and held her tighter. Harry pulled back just enough to kiss Draco firmly on the lips, which led to Merryn pulling away with a sound of disgust.
“Spill,” Harry ordered. He set aside the report he was half done with and picked up his takeaway box instead. “My brain needs a break from listing every dirty sock we found in that flat on Knockturn Alley last week.”
He heard the glass door slide open behind him before strong hands grabbed his waist and pulled him back into the warmth of the house. With a kiss on the back of Harry’s neck, Draco released him and returned to his baking.
Now, as Harry sat with his friends at the Leaky, Harry was on high alert, checking the door whenever it opened in case he needed to make a quick escape.
Harry pushed into the bushes and could make out a shape in front of him. He wordlessly cast a spell to silence his approach and sneaked towards Teddy. The form grew closer and closer. Teddy must be crouched because he wasn’t as tall as usual. And he’d changed his hair to match the white of the mist. A decent disguise, but not enough to hide from Harry. Just one more step and he could … pounce!
“You don’t have to be fine with everything he did,” Charlie said, as if reading his mind.  “You just have to call it the past and leave it there.”
Malfoy and Harry were dancing. Harry couldn't remember exactly how that came to pass, but he was thoroughly enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s strong arm around his waist and the long fingers of his other hand tangled with Harry's. Malfoy was light on his feet and seemed to lead Harry effortlessly around the room in time with the strings playing from somewhere.
Potter had returned to his slicing, so Draco walked up behind him until their clothes brushed together. He wrapped his hand around an uncut courgette and lifted it in front of them. He ran his thumb over the skin of the vegetables and let a little moan sound in Potter's ear.
He came to regret that decision when he was pacing across his living room at half past five that evening.  In an effort to feign indifference, he had casually worded his invitation for Potter to come by that evening and had not given a specific time.  Unfortunately, his attempt to portray relaxation had led to increased pressure.
"So drinking at parties still leads to snogging blokes, huh?" Even as he said it, Draco had to remind himself that there had been no one—according to Pansy—since Macmillan. It eased the sudden flare of jealousy that cramped his stomach.
Draco was civil to him the next morning, but it took several days for him to seem relaxed around Harry again.  In the meantime, Harry made a deliberate effort to be friendly to Rolf and found him clever and viciously funny.
“Malfoy, open up!” Or the pounding noise was actually Potter beating at the door. “What are you doing in there?”
A hand behind his head pulled him down into a hard press of lips and then Potter's tongue was in his mouth, sliding against his tongue. Draco's hips pressed down in response and Potter groaned.
Ron walked in, setting down the bag of takeaway before stripping out of his soggy travel cloak and gloves. He passed Harry his curry and dropped into the chair opposite Harry’s desk with a conflicted look in his eyes. It was the look he always got when he wanted to talk about anything more serious than Quidditch scores but didn’t know how to broach the subject.
Draco had been calling him Potter the whole time, but it suddenly drove Harry crazy.  “Harry.  My name is Harry.  If you can stick your cock up my arse and eat my breakfast and . . . and . . . you can call me Harry!”
From inside the bag, he retrieved the long pink dildo that had made him fall in love with magic all over again.  It wasn’t as thick as his own cock, but it was long enough to reach his prostate with ease, and it was Charmed to move on its own and respond to voice commands.  Harry felt himself hardening at the thought of something more fulfilling than his own fingers.  He reached back into the bag and removed the bottle of lube that claimed to “tingle, cleanse and slick”.  Opening the cap, Harry could smell the tart apple scent.
“Draco, you've been invited to Sunday lunch ever since we started dating.  I know you have a rough history with some of the Weasleys, but I'm part of their family and you're my boyfriend.”
He straightened the lapel on his jacket and examined himself in the mirror once more. The full-length mirror was not magical and was pleasantly silent as he examined the outfit he had spent the last hour assembling.
Potter laughed.  “No, not sheep-fleece, fleece-fleece.  It's made from poly-tecni-something.  It's like plastic or something.”  Draco's face must have shown how unhelpful that explanation was, because Potter continued.  “Plastic's a Muggle material.  They make stuff with it.  Hell, they make almost everything with it!”  Draco was feeling even more out of his depths than when he was trying to figure out what to do with his hands whilst Potter kissed him.  At least that had felt good, so he went back to his fumbling.
calling Draco by his first name helped Hermione remember how much he had changed, and she wanted everyone to like her new friend as much as she did. The worst part was: she was succeeding. Seamus had commented that Draco was funny. Ron had mentioned that it was nice to have proper competition for chess. And bloody Luna was always going on about darling Scorpius and how Harry should bring Teddy and join them for a picnic or a trip to the zoo. As the months passed, it was getting harder and harder for Harry to avoid Draco Malfoy.
Draco huffed out a laugh and squeeze Potter’s hand. “You romantic, you. I’m sure you can save me from other things, like your friends.” Draco felt his stomach drop as he wondered if Potter’s friends would talk him out of trying a relationship with Draco.
Harry nodded. It pleased him to think Hermione’s reputation was making it across the Atlantic while Draco’s was not. “I think it’s her favourite hotel. Very restful.” Leah was definitely considering his words, but Kensa still looked suspicious. Harry’s mind raced with a way to convince her. He wasn’t sure why he cared, but suddenly he did. Maybe it was because he wanted to preserve Ron’s anniversary plans, or maybe it was the thought of a place which allowed Hermione to relax, or maybe he was remembering all the times the
"And I tasted the cake she made for your birthday." How could he forget a bite of cake that seemed determined not to dissolve in his mouth despite repeated chewing? He'd finally resorted to choking it down whole with a large gulp of wine. "The less time that witch spends in a kitchen, the better for the health of everyone she knows."
Harry wondered if he should be thinking.  His throat was dry, and he had no idea if he was talking or just gasping for breath.  Hands grabbed at his hair and his hips.  Lips found his, only to move away again to his cheek, his neck, his ear.  There were words.  Chants.  Moans.  Then the intensity increased, the tightness and heat, until there was an explosion of white behind Harry's eyes.
“My point is,” Hermione’s voice called him back from his memories, “even after they bought the Manor back from the Ministry, Malfoy and his mother would have had ample gold for them both to live comfortably. There was no obvious reason for Malfoy to take a job that is physically and magically demanding, socially isolating, and without any political influence.”
This time Malfoy picked up on Harry's dry tone and gave him a little smirk.  "Yes.  I suppose I did."  He turned and walked past a doorway and into a large and airy kitchen with windows and French doors letting in the fading light.  "Wine?  Whisky?  Ale?"
“What’s your favourite type of dragon?” he asked in hopes of improving his companion’s mood. Few things please Draco like getting to talk about dragons or himself.
“I'll spend Christmas with the Weasleys with you, if you come with me to Vienna for New Year's.”  Harry's whole face glowed as his smile transformed him.  It was beautiful and it filled Draco with hope that this would work.  He would have Harry, and not just as a lover or a bodyguard.
He pulled away from Draco, clambered out of bed and fled the room. More swears rose from below a moment later. Draco sat up in bed and listened to the banging of metal and running of water between Potter's colourful outbursts. Finally heavy footsteps came back up the stairs, and Potter stumbled into the bedroom and fell across the bed.
As he looked at Draco in front of him, he allowed his mind to return to that beach and a particular moment in which Draco had bitten his lower lip. Harry'd had the impulse to bite it for him, but had pushed the thought away at the time. Now he embraced it. He imagined pressing his lips to Draco's, nibbling and sucking that lip into his mouth. He felt his cheeks flame before Flintridge's loud voice pulled him back to the present.
Once a week, when Draco is allowed access to parchment and a quill, he writes to her. He never mentions the maddening tedium, only thanks her for her letters and asks after her friends and the Manor. He doesn't ask after his own friends. He doesn't want to know. The last time he had seen Goyle, there had been very little sign of sanity left.  Pansy had written one letter to say she would be leaving the country. No one else had written him.
Harry Potter was a virgin. Harry Potter—Saviour of the Wizarding World, winner of Witch Weekly's Most Eligible award, and the wank fodder of the masses—was a
Potter stood close to Draco and offered several casual touches as he gave a tour of the ground floor of the cottage that ended in a large kitchen painted in a cheerful yellow. Draco seated himself at the long wooden table as Potter took his place in front of the range.
Potter's eyes shone brightly in the moonlight as he explained the program for helping acclimate children to the magical world. They had been wandering the garden together and ended up beside a plot of carrots as Potter grew more impassioned in his description of the Muggle-born program. "I want it to be for
He tapped his wand on the brick wall and made his way down the Alley to Fortescue’s parlour. It was rather exciting to think that in a few minutes Draco would appear, looking for him. As he pretended to read the specials off the blackboard out front, he imagined Draco stepping out of the crowd of evening shoppers, catching his eye, and then smiling.
The man advanced on him, pressing further into Draco's space.  “There's no reason for—”  A wand on the man's nose caused him to freeze.  At the other end of the wand stood Potter, looking surprisingly menacing despite his sway.
Finally, a little village came into view nestled into the mountainside. It was small and inviting with several brightly coloured buildings lining both sides of a single dirt road. The buildings were all slightly different heights and widths, but they all had shingled roofs and stood touching the building next to them.
Draco gave him a wry smile. 'What you mean is that you like being able to get up and fuss whenever you get stuck on a clue.'
Draco lifted his head to show that perfect self-satisfied smirk of his, his eyes dark and almost dangerous. “We have been dancing around each other half our lives, Potter. I was not going to get hung up on technicalities.”
Draco sighed in clear annoyance, then leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s. Caught off guard, Harry might have made an embarrassing sound before seizing the opportunity to put his hands on Draco’s waist and pull him closer.
“I can think whatever I want and never worry about my dick giving me away.” Malfoy took a step closer to Harry, never breaking eye contact. Harry should break eye contact. He should look away. He should—his eyes fell to Malfoy’s lips just as he murmured, “I could be hard right now and you couldn’t tell.”
The twitch of her lip suggested that she was happy indeed. "I told you to post a divorce announcement in the
“I’m sorry about that,” Harry offered. “More guests are coming this afternoon, right? So we won’t have to sit with her again.”
“It’s my blood on your hands if you’re wrong, Gawain.” The witch’s voice was sharp, but she lowered her hood to reveal a shrewd face with a large nose surrounded by a mass of grey curls.
A small noise sent adrenaline surging through his body. A tiny crack. A broken stick? A distant or muffled Apparition? A wild animal wandering or a wizard returning to guard his crops?
A flick of his wand and some whispered words had his stag racing off to find Ron. Harry stayed pressed against the tree, listening for any sound that they were being pursued and wishing he could check Draco for injuries.
They stood at the crag looking out over the sea until Draco broke the silence and said he needed to return to the hotel to prepare for dinner. Harry wondered how much there could be to do to required Draco starting midday. Wasn’t Harry the only guest? He suddenly imagined himself sitting alone in a large dining room with portraits staring at him as he ate in silence. This was why he never took holidays. He had no one to enjoy them with.
'Anything interesting happen in the wizarding world?' he asked as he finally entered the room. It wouldn't do to let the tea go cold.
Potter gave him another brilliant smile.  Draco could definitely get used to having that look directed at him.
“Yeah, we raided the place and arrested the suspects.  We have a really strong case, thanks to you.”  Potter was looking at him with big soppy eyes, and Draco took a deep drink of his wine to calm himself.
heat of Draco's mouth as Draco looked up at him with eyes that informed him that he was Draco's for life.
Blaise's voice in his ear was breathy and low.  “I'll be gentle.  I'll take care of you until you're begging for it.”  He began kissing his way along Draco's ear and down his throat.  He sucked on a sensitive spot under Draco's ear and it felt good, really good.  Draco was struggling to keep his mind focused on fighting.  A moment later, he let his head fall back and groaned.
Harry just smiled. It might have been a daft sort of smile given the look Tom gave him along with his change. Good thing Hannah wasn’t anywhere to be seen. She certainly would have had a comment or two for him.
Harry looked up from the menu as Hermione slid into the booth across from him. He feared he might have a good guess, but he pretended he didn’t. He had deliberately not spoken of Malfoy to anyone, and luckily no one had mentioned them dancing at the ball together. Or, more likely, the other attendees had been too deep into their own cups by that point in the night and simply hadn’t noticed.
Harry barely heard as he realised he could feel the sharp hardness of Draco’s hip against his biceps. He wanted to grab that hip and use it to turn Draco to face him. Draco’s crotch would be right there. He would just need to part Draco’s robes and then he could see the way Draco’s trousers hugged him. They were probably expensive trousers. Perfectly tailored to display everything. Or maybe Draco didn’t wear trou—
Draco reminded himself that Potter was not his friend; this was just a cease-Curse until the fair was over. For some reason that realisation irritated him.
Draco was suddenly aware of a large body standing next to him.  “Aren't you a pretty thing?” said the rough, unfamiliar voice.
Ron started out the enchanted window at the imaginary sunny beach. “I was going to take her back in the spring for our anniversary, but with press like this the place may be gone by then. The rest of the article is people expressing their outrage and saying they are cancelling their reservations.”
As painful as it was, Draco found himself nodding his acceptance. It hurt a little less when she wrapped her arms around him and let her wild hair tickle his cheek.
Draco found himself in a sizeable and homey kitchen with eight sets of eyes burning into him. The expectation was heavy in the air.
Practices were almost pleasant as they moved more quickly together, arms wrapped tightly around each other and legs moving as one. They ended each evening at the Leaky and usually stayed until last orders. When Friday arrived, Draco felt the weight of knowing it was their last such night; the fair was on Saturday, and then Potter would no longer need him.
“Well, he's a hell of a lot better than Caldwell and Brighton.  Do you realise what he's given us?  Remember the assistant at the apothecary?  The Scottish one?  I remember him saying that he spends his weekends visiting family.  MacGregor asked him whereabouts they live, and he said they live in Bramblethorn.”
He lost himself to the bright light and the rushing in his ears.  Sweat was dripping into his eyes, causing them to sting.  He ran the back of his hand across his eyes and realised he still had some of Draco's semen on his cheek.  He would have laughed, but his body was spent.  It took the remains of his energy to pull out gently from Draco's body before collapsing next to him on the bed.
“Fuck it's cold!”  Another swish closed the window, but did little to settle Draco's goose pimples.  “Alright bird; you'd better have good news.”  What the bird had was a simple—and did the man do another type?—note from Potter explaining that he had a very busy day in Weasel-ville with the people he actually cared about, but could spare some time to shag Draco that evening.  There wasn't even a mention of dinner.
“I came to see you,” Draco said carefully, watching the green eyes widened.  “I wanted to . . .”   Yes, Draco?  What did you want to see him for?  Really thought this out well, didn't you?  “I wanted to . . . thank you.  For yesterday.  And um . . . apologise . . . for being rude.”
Draco took a step back to properly display his scorn. “It appears you are as abysmal at Herbology as you were in Potions.” The words were tempered by the amusement in his eyes. It wasn’t the nastiness from school, but a bit of playful ribbing that felt oddly friendly.
Potter was very still, gaping a bit as he looked Draco over. Was he really so surprised Draco had opened the door? Draco glared at him, which seemed to snap Potter out of his shock. He scowled back and then shoved his way into the lavatory. Draco hurried out before he had to witness Potter peeing.
Draco hadn't been hugged by many people in his life. His mother had hugged him, although more when he was a child, and Pansy had found any way to touch him before accepting he was gay, but there were very few others. Actually, maybe
Potter’s head fell back with a little groan. “You’re killing me, Draco. Have some mercy.” He glared at Draco, so Draco batted his lashes in feigned innocence. “Fine. I like you. Okay? A lot. And I think we could be good together. The fact that we didn’t kill each other over the past two weeks bodes pretty well. I don’t think half the couples in our year would make it out alive.”
A knock sounded on the door to his room, and Harry soon found himself faced with the object of his interest. More importantly, Draco didn’t look angry as he asked to come in.
He conjured a lovely chair with a blue velvet seat before sitting regally across from Harry. He was wearing Muggle clothes, and the light blue jumper exposed delicate collar bones below his pale neck. Harry followed the line of his crisp trousers down to the warm brown Oxfords on his feet. The leather looked like chocolate, and Harry had a sudden image of licking Draco’s shoes.
A warm feeling spread through Draco's chest. He still couldn't believe all the little gestures of kindness and concern the Weasleys showed him. "Thank you," he whispered.
“Wait. What?” Draco played the words over in his mind, making sure he had the meaning right. “You want to
Four hours later, Draco still looked a bit wide eyed.  “Did you expect her to hex you?” Harry teased.  Draco blinked and looked at him as they walked through a grassy clearing.
Foreplay. There should be foreplay. Draco couldn't just slick his cock and plunge in. He should suck Potter off or rim him or something. Sucking Potter off seemed a bit daunting. Draco worried he'd gag and ruin the impression of competence. He'd done pretty well with the iced lolly he'd practised on, but it wasn't really the same. Rimming then. Potter wouldn't be able to see and there was nothing to cut off Draco's air supply.
Luna didn’t respond to that but Draco and Harry showed up at that point. Ginny had noticed that they had been spending more and more time together. Her guess was that they had grown to like each other more now that they weren’t rivals.
His smile dropped into a dumbfounded expression. Then he put his smile back on and announced, “we have our winners of the first trial!”
They looked at each other. Then back to her and Fred answered, “we saw the article and started spreading our opinion. We changed a few hearts and minds.”
He gave her a nervous smile and said, “I don’t like the sight of blood. I wanted to help despite that.”
Overcome with emotion, Arlene threw her hands in the air and screamed, “Woo!” to the valley that held the shack. Luna laughed harder to that. Eventually they left the shack. Once back in the village. They couldn’t hold hands anymore. Despite it being legal in the ministry’s eyes not all of the magical community accepted lesbians. That didn’t stop them from having fun. They went to the candy store and stopped by the Three Broomsticks to get butterbeers to go.
Adrian didn’t give a damn about what the goblet thought. He stood up and said with all the authority and fury of a force of nature, “she doesn’t want to participate. Show me in the rules where you can force someone to be a participant. This is a voluntary function. Not a mandatory one.” He glared down at Dumbledore.
Remus backed him up, “it’s too late to cut us out now. We’ve taken precautions already.” He pointed back at the table and said, “put it back. We’re doing this with or without you.”
Flitwick nodded and told her, “those are valid feelings.” He looked to Professor McGonagall and pleaded, “there has to be some way to get her out of this.”
Hagrid set his hand down a little too hard and insisted, “no, I can cover it and I will. It is my gift to you.” His determination was too much to deny.
Draco remembered being told off as a child for similar behaviour at the dinner table, but he knew his mother wouldn’t appreciate the reminder. Gwenna looked like she might say something, so Draco sought a distraction.
Draco felt a rush of annoyance that Potter was using him as a pawn for more Ministry propaganda. "So this is just part of Shacklebolt's re-election campaign?"
Moments later, Draco entered the glow. "Scorpius!" He ran forward and dropped to his knees to embrace his son. Then he turned cautiously to look up at Harry. "Thank you for finding him." Draco seemed nervous, as if expecting Harry to shout or flee. Harry did have a recent history of fleeing, so that was fair. Draco turned back to his son. "Are you all right?"
Draco considered the possibility of getting his hands on Potter's naked flesh and decided he rather liked the idea. He ignored the voice in his head that suggested he really wanted to know how Potter felt about him.  "I could be persuaded," he drawled. "But I may need one more drink."
“And you used to say it like a curse.  I don't want us to do things just because we used to.  We don't fight like we used to.  We're not enemies.  We can use each other's real names.”
Silly thing. Of course his plan would work. It had six stages formulated to prevent any risk of failure. He would carefully infiltrate Harry's social circle and slowly earn his trust. Once they were friends, he would choose subtle gestures to introduce an element of romance to their relationship. Once Potter was devoted to him, Draco would seduce him. The whole thing would surely take months—maybe a year—but in the end Potter would be thoroughly shagged and free of the burdens of his virginity.
Spoken like a daft child who didn’t realise her decisions would haunt her for the rest of her life. Draco knew damn well how the bad choices made at sixteen could alter everything. “Merryn, you don’t understand. People will try to drive you away. They will try to—”
Draco arrived early to the Ministry Monday morning, as he did every workday and the occasional Saturday. He rode the lift down to the second level and walked the long empty corridor to the cluster of desks that was the Curse-Breaker division. Unlike the surrounding desks stacked high with overstuffed case files and the odd Cursed object, Draco's desk held only the two tidy files he'd set aside on Friday evening and a roll of bright yellow parchment he'd never seen before.
, who held him through nightmares and made him stay home in bed when he was poorly. Draco took better care of him than Harry took of himself. Why couldn't he just let Draco take care of his pleasure, too?
Draco mimed locking his lips and crossing his heart. Then he let the greed show on his face as he leered at her. "Now spill."
Potter was silent for a long moment, and Draco wondered if—for the first time ever—Potter was choosing his words. “I don’t deserve her marks because I don’t put the work in.” He stared right into Draco’s eyes. “And I wouldn’t say I could find a
They'd called a Healer to the Burrow who assured them there was no long term damage from the lack of air, but only because of the timing. She said another few minutes and it would have been a different prognosis. Ginny relayed that bit of the story, and her eyes were wet and fierce as she spoke. Somehow, Draco had found himself inside the protective circle of Gryffindor loyalty.
As they were gathering their things, Ron turned on Harry with a serious face.  “You know, if I'd known you asking Malfoy out would lead to him being so damn useful, I would have made you do it years ago!”
Harry felt his cheeks flush as he walked forward to shake Aida’s hand. He tried to say he was really just there as a guest, but Aida waved him off.
plan. Obviously. One doesn't just fuck a virginal Harry Potter. There are phases! Infiltration, Development of Trust, Romance, and Seduction." He ticked each phase off on a finger to help her understand. "I'm in Phase One: Education."
Opening the door to the Leaky Cauldron, Draco froze. The place was as dark and dirty as ever, but the Friday evening crowd had filled every table. It was astonishing that magical people endured such shabby conditions on a regular basis.
Potter started rattling off a list of demands: food, magazines, and a map. Then he turned to Draco. "Want anything from your room?"
"Then let the others dream a little." Harry smiled at his friend. "After all, that's all they get. The dream."
Potter placed a firm hand on the small of his back and urged him forward. He had warned Draco that the Weasel and Longbottom had gone ahead and Weasley was likely to have started drinking. That didn't prepare him for Weasley's grin and wave from a stool at the bar.
Harry closed his eyes and gave a tiny shake of his head that wouldn't require him to move away. 'A sip or two of champagne and a glassful of eye-opening honesty.'
Supposedly he looked like this: wild wet hair briefly tamed by the water weighing it down around his face and flicking into his eyes. Bright green eyes that were brightest when he smiled. A body that, while still long and lean, had lost the childhood gangliness and showed surprising strength.
She stepped back, beaming up at him. “You knocked, you daft fool. You live ‘ere. Now come in. Mum’s got supper ready and she won’t take the Statis off ‘til you’re at the table.” She pulled him into the warmth of the house and he greedily soaked up the familiar paintings on the walls and the smell of old stone and wood.
me, he assured himself. He smiled to himself at that thought. What was it Parkinson had said? They were already a couple just without the sex. His mind provided an image of what sex with Draco might look like—Draco, pink-cheeked and gasping as he moved over him—and Harry's cock thickened in appreciation. Harry pushed the thought away to focus on his claim on Draco.
Malfoy stared into his eyes as if checking the truth of his words.  Harry supposed he couldn't blame him for wanting to distance himself from his father's actions and their shared family name.  Draco then.  If he chanted it in his head a few more times it might even stick.
In that moment, Harry no longer cared about wrong moves or consequences. He only cared about those lips and that tongue. The space between them vanished and their chests were pressed close as their lips met for the first time. Malfoy’s lips were soft and warm despite the cold, dry air, and Harry hoped his own chapped lips wouldn’t put him off.
A little voice in the back of his head suggested that perhaps the difference was knowing that Draco loved him first. Even with Parkinson's words and Draco's body language cheering him on, he was terrified it might all be a mistake and Draco didn't want him at all.
It would have taken weeks to make all of the arrangements by owl, but with Harry’s Muggle way he had everything sorted by lunchtime.  He found Draco in the sitting room and couldn’t contain himself enough to even sit down before speaking.
“I really like you, Draco.  I mean, you’re super-hot, but it's more than that.  A lot more.  I miss you on Sundays, and I spend most of the time we're apart thinking about you and what you'd think or say if you were there.  I always think that you'd love Mrs. Weasley's pies, but you'd be disgusted by how much red and brown sauce Ron can use on his potatoes.  I wonder what position you'd want to play if you joined us for Quidditch and then I wonder if you'd want to play on my team or against me.
Harry blinked and the grey sky transformed into the white ceiling of his own bedroom. He sighed in relief until he realised he was still freezing. Looking down over his goose-pimpled arms and chest, he saw nothing but his tartan pyjama bottoms between him and the spring morning air. Late spring, yes, but still bloody cold. Where the fuck was the duvet?
There were one or two reservations which might hold, but they weren’t enough to keep a hotel running. It certainly didn’t justify two full-time chefs, but he couldn’t bear to let anyone go. The Angove-Bronstein wedding was still on the books for the end of April, so he wouldn’t consider losing staff until that was cancelled. Or until April ended with no one having shown up. He wouldn’t allow himself to consider that he might still be able to keep a booking for a major event, even if the bride was American and might not hate him as much as his own countrymen.
Stupid Longbottom moving in and fucking up Draco's social life. Those two were supposed to be an eighth-year fling, not the shacking-up together type. And what kind of Gryffindor shagged on a kitchen table? That wasn't noble or romantic! Weren't satin sheets, rose petals, and poetry required for every lovemaking?
“Wait.  Are you saying that you’ll go to dinner with me.  Like, a date?  Tomorrow night?”  Draco rolled his eyes theatrically.
Harry bit his lip and waited for his heart to bloom or shatter. He knew that Flintridge was probably still standing next to them and that various friends and colleagues were gathered around the room, but none of it mattered. All that mattered was whatever Draco did next.
Toby nodded. “Yeah. About Muggle fashion. He works with us a lot at Games and Sports when we’re trying to set up major events. We don’t want a lot of wizards in wonky clothes attracting Muggle attention.” Harry thought back to the Quidditch World Cup and had to agree that wizards could use some help with dressing like Muggles. “He works with the Aurors, too, but probably not Muggle-raised ones like you.”
Draco turned back with a smile and assured her it was all good things. “Aida, this is Harry. He’s the Auror meant to prove we aren’t torturing Muggles in the basement. Harry, Aida.”
“Too tired to fuck?”  Harry took a step into Draco’s space and watched a smug grin spread across his face.
It was surprisingly soothing watching Potter breathe. His thin lips parted slightly and his face looked so restful now that the fever was gone. Long black lashes rested against delicate cheekbones. He had rather nice features when he wasn’t scowling or looking gormless. The purple around his eyes had faded to a pale bruising, and the blotchy redness had receded until only the apples of his cheeks were flushed. He looked rather pretty.
A tall figure made its way through the shop, and Harry could tell it was Malfoy from the the lean build and easy grace. Malfoy was dressed like a Muggle in dark trousers, a collared shirt, and a navy jumper. As he neared the door, Harry admired the pale hair that Malfoy now wore short on the sides but with the soft strands on top just long enough to fall into his eyes.
He looked up at George to see him smiling victoriously. Before Draco lost consciousness, his last thought was to wonder why George's hair looked white.
It was another hour before Luna finally arrived to say that dinner was ready.  Draco and Harry had finished another bottle of wine by then, and Harry found himself completely comfortable sitting buck-arse-naked at Luna's table as she commented on how sex gave him a healthy glow.  She suggested they have sex under the full moon later that month.  Apparently it was a Buck moon and  Harry should cast his Patronus during climax to ward off some type of nasty sounding creature that likely didn't exist.  Instead of scoffing, Draco simply squeezed his hand and agreed to try it.
Potter had the decency to blush. It was a flattering pale pink that accented his high cheekbones and complimented his green eyes. Draco would have to make him blush again.
He met Draco's hungry eyes with all the confidence he could muster. 'Well, who am I to argue with the birthday boy?'
Draco wanted to make Harry wait. He wanted him to squirm and suffer in payment for the months of confusion and hurt he’d put Draco through. Yes, Draco had matured, but he hadn’t changed completely. He still had his pride.
The wind carried the smell of wild flowers, but Draco wanted to smell Potter's scent as he tasted him, so he pressed his face into Potter's neck and sucked on the skin there.
“I think I’ll call it a night,” Dave said with a yawn.  “Summer rush may be over, but there’s still work to do.”  He stood and stretched his powerful frame.
“I gave a lot of testimony after the war.” He was struggling to keep his tone light. She might be enjoying it, but he wanted to get back to his tea. It would probably be cold and he’d have to begin again. Warming Charms made tea taste like liquid rubber.
The photograph on the front of the brochure showed grassy crags dropping down to a sandy beach and bright blue water. The photographs inside the brochure were all of food: full English fry up, a platter of fluffy scones with clotted cream and pots of jam, a meat pie with flaky pastry, a plate piled with shellfish, and a close-up of the chocolate cake Ron was probably still fantasising about. It was only on the back that Harry finally found an image of the hotel itself: a side view showing a large stone building that opened onto a patio and then a well-manicured lawn framed with flowering trees and shrubs. Beyond the garden, over a low stone wall that looked as old as Hogwarts, the sea shone in the sunshine.
It was probably the lack of etiquette offending his sensibilities.  If he had ever chosen to court someone, be it for marriage or sex, he would have shown far more tact and class than Potter had thus far managed.  Yes, it was simply an aesthetic reaction to a classless letter.
A plump woman who instantly put Harry in mind of Mrs Weasley came into view. “She’s got you there, Draco. That’s what I was always told as a girl. ‘Find one the size of your ‘ead.’ And that’s ‘ow I bake ‘em.”
“I wasn't sent by Substances,” he admitted.  Weasley frowned and Draco briefly delighted in being able to squash his mood so easily.  Potter's own little frown was less pleasing.
Draco glared. "I think she needs to give up on freeing elves against their will, but she'd certainly be better than Fudge was. Not now, obviously. Shacklebolt has several years left in him, and Granger has to learn a lot more about the Ministry.”
He was just about to suggest they slow down when he felt a familiar crushing sensation and the kitchen vanished from around him. When the air returned to his lungs, he was in a small bedroom dominated by a large wood-frame bed with Potter sprawled across it.
He slid from the bed and arched gracefully to flaunt his own lean muscles. "Fine. But I'm ordering a mimosa."
Harry shook his head, beaming with pride at his own ingenuity. 'No. That's the brilliance of doing it today. If he suspects a party, he'll think it's next weekend.' His grin was pulling at his cheeks almost painfully. 'He's going to love it! I have cases of his favourite champagne and that posh new French place is catering. It will all be delivered once Draco's gone.'
like a whole other lifetime. "Besides, he spoke for me at my trial, so he's clearly over all that. Age and circumstance, remember?"
How did Blaise know about it? He was hired for the job. He took Claudius' gold—of course he did—but was friend enough not to follow through with the actual killing part. It wasn't surprising that Claudius thought Blaise would be willing to kill Draco. They had had a very violent and public falling out when Blaise first dumped Pansy for the Weasley girl, and a few death threats might have been shouted across the restaurant before Pansy and Ginny separated them. The
He returned to his desk to find Clearwater fiddling with his paperweight.  “Here are your parchments.  Is there anything else you need for your meeting?”  He handed over the paperwork and awaited the next chance to do a favour.
He had a sudden terrible thought that Draco might expect him to wear a dinner jacket or dress robes. He imagined showing up in his scruffy trainers and finding Draco dressed to the nines and sneering at him.
Harry nodded. "I'll check with the suppliers to make sure they only sell to the apothecaries Ron is checking.” There. Harry
Draco looked dubious.  “It would be an impressive feat to Apparate that distance and change of altitude
Draco had a plan to save Potter from his own virginal captivity, and it did not involve shagging in a vegetable garden. He pressed one last kiss to Potter's lips and then pulled away.
But his pride had to be sacrificed to his limited time. Hermione was due back in three days, and Draco needed to know where things stood before then. So it was that he send an owl to Harry arranging dinner for the next night.
"Yeah. One of our trainees asked me out—not Romilda for once—but I said I was off to practice bondage with you."
“I didn’t know you were good at Herbology.” Okay, not an inspired conversation starter, but better than creepy silent staring.
Harry prevented Draco from sitting up with a hand on his shoulder. "The Wizengamot will take as long as they like. We may hear today. We may not. We may not hear until next week." He knelt down and stroked Draco’s hair back his brow so he could place a gentle kiss there. "You and Hermione presented a very strong case."
A silence fell over them, but it wasn't uncomfortable. It was all a little surreal, and would take some time to get used to, but Harry couldn't remember when he'd been happier.
Potter spent that first afternoon pacing around and sending his damn Patronus off with messages to his friends. Even worse, they replied. Silver otters and dogs bounced about whining like Weasley and pretending to know everything like Granger. Draco ignored it for as long as he could before locking himself in the bathroom.
Hermione wouldn’t let Harry call him "Malfoy" any more; she would deliberately pretend Harry meant Lucius. Because
It would have been kind to let it go, but Draco could not resist pushing his advantage. "Oh?" He tried to sound innocently curious but failed to his own ears. "Any reason you don't usually cook here? The kitchen is certainly nice enough."
“He wants to get married in Cornwall,” Leah went on. “He’s stayed at the hotel before. He said he got to know a couple of the people who work there and he’s sure he’ll be—we’ll be safe.”
Emotion flowed across Draco’s face as Harry watched him process what had been said. Harry could only stay very still—but for the pounding in his chest—and look as contrite as possible as he awaited Draco's verdict. He couldn’t dare to imagine how it would feel if Draco refused to forgive him. After running from Draco at every meeting, Harry feared nothing more than Draco giving him the same treatment.
At least the French like me, he mused, as he read the flattering article under the photograph of Astoria, Scorpius, and him from the previous year’s event.
He then pulled popped corn from another pocket and showed Harry where to hold it while he dressed the tree. A garland of berries followed, and then one of chunks of bread. When the garlands were all in place, Harry and Malfoy stepped back to examine their work.
Potter readily complied. He was in the middle of the bed, and when Draco walked up behind where his arse jutted into the air he couldn't really reach. "Um, scoot back a bit. That's it. There."
“Are you saying you are asking me out because you want to date me, not because you need a date for the wedding?”
Stranger still was that Potter dropped by Draco's desk the next day to ask about a case when he could have simply sent a memo or even chosen a different Curse-Breaker—one with far less personal history.
“How much do I owe you?” He suddenly realised that he hadn’t thought about whether Romanian wizards had a different currency.
“Malfoy!”  Potter gave him a brilliant smile.  Oh, this would be so easy.  “I'm glad they sent you.”  Wait—what?  Before he could ask, Weasley chimed in.
That comment easily distracted Harry, as he still felt rather smug for having addicted Draco to Muggle crosswords. Television had been an easy sell as it demanded nothing more than sitting on (and later in) Harry's bed and staring at the screen. In contrast, the crosswords had all but mocked Draco's ignorance of Muggle culture, and Draco hated anything that made him feel inferior.
"Ripweed Burgundy," he managed between gritted teeth. The pain was easing, but his anger hadn't.  He wouldn't draw his wand on Weasley, but he couldn't resist ordering the most expensive wine the Leaky carried, one he knew came only by the bottle. He didn't think Weasley would recognise the prestigious label, but the little flinch from his right assured him Weasley at least suspected the cost.
Feeling bold, he reached for Potter's cock. It was filling again and growing warm in Draco's hand. He pumped it and Potter bucked into his hand. That seemed to work. What if …
"Harry thinks...they’ve never even met...how would he…" Yes, they had been at Hogwarts together, but Astoria spoke about Harry as someone she only knew by reputation. Why would Harry bring her up at all, let alone to Hermione?
Malfoy’s eyes lit up. "That is why I wanted to speak to you." He stepped closer. "I wanted to speak to you about Granger's work."
Surprisingly, a huge grin took over Potter's face. "Really? This is your first time, too? Why didn't you say?"
Harry found the vial of lube again and poured it liberally over his cock.  As soon as he pressed the head of his cock against Draco's hole, he felt Draco's body tense.  “It's okay, Draco.  I'll be careful.”  He leaned forward and kissed him soundly before pulling back and lining up again.  He pressed in gently, using his hands to soothe Draco's body beneath him.  It felt amazing and it took an act of will not to lose himself completely in that first moment.
A cloaked figure entered first with her large hood obscuring her face. An elderly woman judging by the small wrinkled hands clasped in front of her. Next was a stunning witch with dark almond eyes and shining black hair that fell down her back so perfectly Harry could hear Hermione’s voice in his head, muttering about Sleakeazy potions. The last person to enter was Draco Malfoy.
“Getting ready for sunnier skies,” he asked with a pasted-on smile—not that she could distinguish it from a real one.
Potter looked like a kicked puppy as Draco stepped away, and Draco nearly took him back into his arms. He offered to owl instead. The hurt look didn't change.
Harry tore his eyes from Draco to face Luna.  He tried to keep his eyes on hers, but she was staring off in the distance, clearly involved in some Luna thought he would never understand.  In the end he found himself looking back at Malfoy, who was the picture of calm and collected.
The shower was surprisingly comfortable.  They cleaned each other as if they'd done it a dozen times and then wrapped themselves in fluffy towels until they were dry.  It was weird to simply hang up the towel without getting dressed, but Harry was glad to have the view of Draco's body restored after the bloody towel hid him away.
Hot fluid filled his mouth, and Harry tried to swallow without tasting with limited success. Draco was right: definitely not sweet, but not too bad.
Harry blushed and looked down at the scratched wooden table. 'No. But you make it seem like a bad thing.' It wasn't his fault that the beef was perfectly tender and the horseradish mustard had exactly the right amount of kick to it. He looked up into Draco's bright grey eyes that were shining with warm amusement. 'When I find something good, I don't see any reason to give it up.'
Harry bit down on his frustration at having made yet another mistake in Draco’s eyes. It was his sixth day in the field, and he was bored of discussing terrain and sheep grazing patterns. The past five days had been spent passed among Charlie, Pavel, Zhi and Dave, but they’d all been called away by a fight between two Norwegian Ridgebacks—not Norberta, Charlie had assured him—and left him with Draco as his instructor. Harry had hope that Draco would be more interesting, but he rabbited on about terrain and sheep just as much as the others had.
“Where are we going to celebrate,” Ron asked as they made their way out of the office a few minutes later.  Harry was dirty, sore, and completely exhausted, but he knew going out for drinks was not optional.
"And what about you, Potter? Don't you have signings to attend and babies to kiss? Can the wizarding world spare their precious
Draco didn't dare to speak or breathe as they changed their positions. Potter returned to his hands and knees, and Draco knelt behind him. He ran one hand over Potter's back as he used the other to line himself up.
Harry felt he should approach and say something, but what would he say? What did he want to say? His heart was racing and his hands trembled, telling him that this was very important to get right. He chose to heed Parkinson's advice and consider his own feelings before talking to Draco. He certainly owed Draco that much after inadvertently stringing him along.
The Dark Lord did not celebrate Christmas, but he did not seem to care that, as Headmaster, Severus had maintained the Hogwarts holiday schedule. Draco had returned on the Hogwarts Express and been met by his mother at the station. She had then spent every day of the holiday making up excuses for them to be away from the Manor. She took Draco to select several different trees to decorate the Manor, to visit her friends and distant family, to buy gifts for every person she could think of, and to select groceries from all over England. Whenever the Dark Lord's followers questioned why she did not send her elves on some errand, she would scoff about the poor judgement of lesser beings. No one dared argue with that.
It was a simple statement, but Harry saw it for what it was: the answer to one of Harry’s silent questions. Information freely given.
“That’s okay, right?  We have the evening off anyway.”  A thought occurred to him and he panicked.  “There’s no rule against us dating is there?  You’re not going to make me leave, are you?!”  Not only did he love his new life at the reserve, he couldn’t imagine leaving Draco now that he was finally winning him over.
While they ate, Harry watched Aida returned to her work. She pulled baskets of fruits and vegetables, carefully inspecting and sorting them into different places.
Draco coughed as Harry flushed at his own words. He'd said what he thought Draco wanted to hear—surely after waiting so long for Harry to wake up to his own feelings, Draco wanted to claim him fully—but now Harry worried that Draco might think he knew anything about the shagging he'd flippantly mentioned.
'I don't mean now!' His voice sounded a little panicked, so he took a breath before starting again. 'I mean, I worked damn hard to plan this party, and I want you to enjoy it. I know how you love parties, especially ones centred on you.' He'd loved kissing Draco, but he didn't want to rush into too much that night.
“The good news is that this particular Potion includes Squib’s Friend, and Squib’s Friend is a real bitch to grow.” He sat on Harry’s desk and stretched his long legs out across the floor. Harry had to resist reaching over to find his thighs under all that grey fabric.
“Hmm?”  Draco was still studying the crossword, his brow slightly creased as he stroked the edge of the quill along his jaw.  When Harry remained silent, he glanced up with curious grey eyes.
Harry pretended to misunderstand. “Well, they will need to you examine and catalogue the plants on the farm. But that can wait until I am back on Monday.” He gave Draco a daft smile and enjoyed the heat of Draco’s glare.
As they approached the kitchen, Draco heard the warm sound of Rosamund’s voice as she sang Black and Gold. She always sang in the kitchen, whether making a roast or wiping down the counters when she was through, and they were usually songs about love or the sea. She had once told him quite seriously that sad songs would soak into the food, making it taste as bitter and salty as the music it was born in. He had also noticed that meat dishes were more likely to get songs of fighting and patriotism, but he didn’t ask about that. Instead, he had allowed her to teach him some Cornish folk songs to go with the traditional Cornish recipes she showed him. He doubted he could make a pasty without singing Fish and Tin and Copper.
Draco placed one hand on Harry’s hip and ran the other through his hair. “Don’t talk about Weasley right now,” he murmured before pulling Harry into a much more heated kiss.
house and we'll fuck where we feel like!" She was standing now and Draco could almost imagine her stamping her foot like she used to when they were children. "
The rest of the table smiled at him kindly and went about making their own conversation. Harry felt happy to no longer be the centre of attention and made his excuses as soon as he'd finished eating. “Long day and all that.” He was dismissed with a nod and a smile from Charlie and headed for the door.
“What?  No!  Of course not!”  He was about to ask how Draco could even think that, but had the good sense to shut up lest the question be turned back on him.  “I don't want anyone else.”  He delighted in the way Draco blushed at Harry's confession.  “But I was thinking . . . maybe we don't need to spend the holidays apart at all.”
Draco came to a halt as he felt his meagre breakfast fight its way up his throat. Could his uncle really have—he thought—the Aurors had said … Not that it changed the fact that his father was dead and his mother had fled to South America.
He picked up the bouquet of tiger lilies and the outrageously expensive bottle of Bordeaux he was bringing for Pansy; she had planned this entire party for his purposes, so no token hostess gift would do. Satisfied with his appearance, he Apparated to the rural cottage his best friend now shared with Longbottom.
That hope had been born three years ago when Draco first joined the Ministry, although he'd still been 'Malfoy' then.  Harry had just completed Auror training—training made even more intense by Kingsley's decision to have Harry, Ron, and Neville complete their N.E.W.T.s on top of all the usual training—and Harry had barely seen anyone who wasn't part of the Aurors since the war.
That year there been more food, sweets, and presents than any other, but it had been the worst Christmas of Draco's life. Terror had hung over him, saturating the very air so that each breath poisoned him. The fear had made the food taste like ash and the sweets burn in his stomach. He hadn't want the new broomstick that was waiting for him under the tree. It only reminded him that, as the fastest flyer, he was now
Harry felt his mouth fall open in horror. He had tried to improve the conversation and had inadvertently made it much worse.
“I have you down as staying until Sunday, is that correct?” Draco waited for Potter to nod. “You are the only guest for the next two nights, but then our best rooms are reserved for the wedding couple and their families. I can put you in one of those rooms for now, but I’d have to move you. Or I can put you in a standard room you can have the whole stay.”
Harry didn’t want to break the silence—fearing it would shatter the camaraderie as well—but he was itching with questions. Malfoy turned just enough to meet his eye with a small smile.
Harry stretched out on his side and ran a hand under sun-warmed blanket to Draco’s back.  A grumpy sound emerged from under Draco’s pillow.  Draco squirmed around some more and then settled in rock-like stillness.  Harry sighed.  His boyfriend was simply not a morning person.
The first glimpse of red had Draco wanting to break his way out of the room and into the safety of Hogwarts. He wasn’t a Healer and he wasn’t prepared to deal with this. He had persuaded Potter to go to bed early, so Potter was staining the white sheets crimson with each renewed coughing fit and Draco was perfecting his cleaning Charms. The Cough-No-More no longer helped, so Draco simply forced Potter to drink a blood replenishing potion. He was still coughing up blood, but at least he wasn’t quite so pale.
Harry all but leapt from the bed that no longer felt luxurious. He threw on his clothes and Apparated away before he could see the lying cheat again.
Okay, so maybe Harry had gotten a little petulant at the end.  He realised that he had been crumpling the Telegraph with his fingers whilst talking and tried in vain to smooth it out again.  As the silence grew, he looked back up at Draco's face.  His eyes were still wide and his jaw hung loose so that his mouth made a delicious little “O” shape.  Had Harry scared him with his confession?  Did he think he was some crazed stalker?  Should he say something else, or would that just make it worse?
“Well look at this.” Ron pulled out a newspaper and passed it over to Harry. The front page showed a grainy photograph of Draco Malfoy of all people under the headline: Death Eater Lures Unsuspecting Innocents to Remote Location. Further down the page was a dark photograph of a manor house on a stormy night briefly lit up by lightning before falling back into shadow. It looked nothing like the cheerful building in Hermione’s brochure, but Ron confirmed it was the same place. “The article says Hotel Kalmynsi is an old Fawley property, and the Fawleys married into the Malfoys. Anyway, Malfoy—
Draco had vanished from sight again. Harry scanned the room, but did not see Draco's distinct pale hair.
Harry had cast every cleaning charm he knew since receiving Draco’s owl. He usually kept his place quite neat—he loved his cottage and enjoyed taking care of it—but knowing that Draco would see it had suddenly shown him every smudge and fleck of dirt. It was good that he had only a day’s warning, or he would driven himself mental by fussing and worrying. As it was, he barely had enough time to buy groceries on his way home from the Ministry and still be able to shower and have things bubbling away before the doorbell rang.
He pulled away with a playful nip at Potter’s lip. He arched his brow and gave Potter a haughty smirk. “I
But as he led Draco down to the kitchen a few minutes later, he couldn’t help but wonder if Draco might join him at the Burrow the Sunday before Christmas when the Weasleys had their big party. And maybe Narcissa might have room for one more at Malfoy Manor on Christmas Eve. Surely it would be lonely with just Draco and her, as Lucius still had another year in Azkaban. He decided to ask Draco at a moment when he couldn’t say no. Like maybe the moment before taking Draco's cock down his throat.
"That I was having an affair. Having not told you I was married." Draco’s cold, flat tone chilled Harry’s bones. Had he messed this up too much to fix?
In contrast, Harry looked like a drowning boy lost to the sea of fabric that was Dudley’s old t-shirt. The image on the front was so faded and flaked that he no longer remembered what it had once depicted. Harry knew that his jeans—
They were halfway through breakfast when Narcissa’s owl arrived.  Draco set aside the new tin of tea and began reading the letter.  Harry watched the way Draco’s eyes flitted across the parchment until they suddenly widened.
will bake them.” Harry said in the firm voice he used when the children misbehaved. “Astoria sent very detailed instructions that even I can’t mess up." Harry was actually a rather good baker, but Draco always assumed that Harry couldn’t do anything that shared skills with Potions. He guided Draco over to the couch and draped a tartan blanket over him. "
Aamu knows the story of Lemminkäinen well. It is soaked into her world, in the stories, the paintings, and the songs. Her favourite picture of Lemminkäinen shows him with wavy red hair, but in her dreams he has hair as pale as the fox that paints the sky.
It was not Blaise's deep and smoky voice that cut through the room.  This voice was clear and smooth and all too familiar; Draco did not need to look to know Harry Potter was there.
"I think we've got walking down," Potter said. "Next time we can try increasing our speed." He pulled his arm away and Draco's back felt suddenly cold in the evening air. His leg felt almost naked as Potter undid the rope.
Scorpius looked past Draco to Teddy and raised his chin in a way that was so much like his father as a boy. "
—Vane's file when he felt Potter's presence behind him. Draco could smell that hint of grass and warm dirt, and he could almost taste Potter's restless magic.
Harry couldn’t make out more than a word or two, but there were lots of photographs moving on each page. There was a large one on the cover of the French Minister shouting at some other politician Harry didn’t recognise. The photograph on page 3 made him laugh as he watched the Crup in a young girl’s arms repeatedly lick her ear despite her silent protests. On page 7, Harry watched the French national Quidditch team race across the sky.
Draco's first memory of Christmas is of presents. He remembers Grandfather Malfoy trying to draw his attention to the realistic details of the model Hogwarts Express he had given Draco, but Draco had been too enamoured of his new toy wand. The wand didn't really channel his magic, and he wasn't really casting spells, but the sparks that shot from the end when he waved it felt like an omen of the powerful wizard he would grow to be. Draco had never once worried he might be a Squib because his father had always assured him that the Malfoy line couldn't make Squibs. Squibs were what happened to families that mixed with Muggles: a worthy punishment for those who did not appreciate the superiority of their heritage.
Draco chuckled against Potter's chest and felt it rumble in reply. "I suppose you wouldn't believe me if I denied it."
"Both. No, the second one. I'm not actually surprised that Neville couldn't resist a plant fanatic with a great figure. I guess it's just odd that they work together outside of the greenhouse." Potter's tone was light and musing. Perhaps Potter had accepted Pansy after all.
Draco shrugged and took a lemon biscuit from one of the cooling racks on the counter. "I saw an old ... acquaintance. It seemed like he was pleased to see me,
He wanted to be using his talent for Potions to help the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol and the Aurors solve cases involving illegal potions.  Clearwater, as Head of the Department, was in charge of all interdepartmental assignments, so he'd been cajoling her for the past three years in the hopes that she would finally let him use his skills for something of interest.
Draco had refused to practice over the weekend, claiming he was far too busy. It wouldn't do for Potter to think Draco had nothing better to do, and he
Potter smiled a sweet, awkward smile that made him look like a child again. “I don’t need anything much. Just a bed and a place to put my things. It seems silly to have me use two rooms and have twice the linen to clean and all that.”
Potter was still silent, but Draco could almost see his mind trying to plan his next move.  When he finally opened his mouth, the words came out so fast Draco struggled to understand them.  He made out something about dinner.
Potter took the hint and let it drop, but he did not go back to ignoring Draco. Nor would he let Draco ignore him. He asked Draco about jazz music and Arithmancy and the book of Norse sagas Draco took to bed. More surprising was the fact that he listened to Draco’s replies.
As the other two Aurors secured the perimeter, Harry briefed Ron on what had happened. His best friend listened patiently before clapping him on the shoulder and telling him to go home. “Or not home. Just find your
'I know,' Harry whispered. He remembered the weekend they'd gone to the south of France together and shared a bottle of that champagne on the starry beach near their hotel. He had been so happy in that moment, and yet he'd felt as if some tiny piece were missing.
With a flash of green, a shout, and way too much spinning, Harry found himself tumbling out into the Burrow’s kitchen.
The contrast between the ashen, painfully thin Draco Malfoy of his memories of the war hearings and the one who strolled into the Ministry three years later had been enough to render Harry speechless.  He had stood frozen in the Atrium taking in the tall, confident walk, the lean muscle, and the faint pink tint that spoke of three years of health and peace.  It was then that he had first noticed the perfectly shaped, muscular arse.
A moment later, Draco shoved his bowl away. “Fuck it. That’s good enough for propriety’s sake.” He stood and picked up his travelling cloak. “Grab your cloak, Potter. You’ve pulled.”
“I didn't mean it like that!  I just meant . . . I like you.”  The woman, Rosie, came up with their drinks, and they fell into silence.  Potter was smiling shyly and kept his gaze on his glass of Muggle ale.  The pause in conversation gave Draco a moment to reflect on Potter's odd comments.  Potter liked him.  Well, at least that was a step in the right direction.  Not that it really meant much: Potter seemed to like almost anyone , so long as they hadn't supported the Dark Lord.  But maybe it was notable that Potter had moved from hate to indifference to actually liking him.
“Yes,” he bit out as he waited for the real mocking to begin.  He wondered if Draco would make him move out.  Maybe he would tell Charlie he didn’t feel safe living with Harry anymore.  Harry dropped his eyes to the floor as he imagined the whole team learning about his perversion.
"Nothing suspicious from Dublin to Knockturn. A few people buying controlled ingredients here and there, but very small amounts and not regularly."
Harry scowled.  “Bernard Sothman?”  Draco nodded.  “ He's your boss now?  I don't like him.”  They finished eating in silence, and Draco wondered at Harry's sudden brooding.
idea how hard I am working to redeem my name?" he spat. "And you just throw it away on a lark. Not that you could even
Harry startled to realise that he had not only lost sight of Malfoy, he had let Malfoy sneak up behind him. He ignored the additional realisation that he could recognise Malfoy's voice from one word after seven years apart.
Draco raised a single eyebrow in the way he'd perfected in his youth.  “Was last night all you have to offer in bed?”
“Because I want to date you,” Harry said, “and since we are in the same place this weekend it seemed the wedding was a good place to start. Although maybe a wedding is a bit intense for a first date. If you’d rather, we can wait until next weekend and I can take you to the cinema or the theatre or whatever else interests you.”
“You’re ridiculous, Merryn.” Draco’s voice was fond despite his words. “They are already far too big for polite society.”
Ron laughed at that, but Harry sat eagerly awaiting more information.  Malfoy still fascinated him, even though he had heard nothing about the other man in over two years.
'Because cramming his stuff into your little cottage made so much more sense than him simply moving back to the Manor.' Harry opened his mouth to remind Ron about the horrible things that had happened in Draco's childhood home, but Ron waved him off. 'Bad memories. I know, I know. Anyway, I was calling to ask what the plan was for tonight.'
Harry wasn't usually one for the one-off shag. He'd had sex, of course, but always after a few dates with someone he liked.
"Yes, Luna."  And when did Malfoy call her Luna?  Although clearly they were neighbours now and much had changed.  "We were becoming reacquainted.  It appears we have some
“Fine. Be an idiot.” Draco stepped toward his pants on the floor, but Harry leapt from bed and intercepted him.
Harry was feeling his orgasm build, hoping his legs would hold him, when Draco looked him straight in the eye.
“Shhh. You’re okay. I’ve got you.” Potter held him close and murmured in his ear as Draco turned to bury his face deeper into his damp pillow.
He is coming to her. He is from far away, but like Kauko, he must leave home. He will come to Aamu, but he has already been saved by his mother and the bee. There are other stories about Lemminkäinen. Stories where he wastes his mother’s gift chasing his pride.
was already writing articles in support of D.U.M.B. on a daily basis, but their readership wasn’t the demographic Draco and Hermione needed to convert.
Draco turned the conversation to his classmates in the Herbology program and the various pranks they liked to play. “We learned to be wary of each other, so instead we would torment each other’s
Potter scowled and pressed the hair over his brow again.  “Scar,” he grumbled.  Was Potter really hiding his scar?  Was that why he let his hair grow out so oddly?  Potter had taken hold of Draco's hand and was holding it against his cheek.  The soppy gesture made Draco self-conscious and he glanced around to see if anyone had noticed.  Weasley and Granger were speaking softly to each other and seemed oblivious to the rest of the room.  Longbottom was over at the bar looking like a rejected puppy and mooning over a Hufflepuff from their year.
in his head. "And for what it's worth, I think you're doing a great job redeeming your name. Bill says you're a really good Curse-Breaker, you know. And I know you're the only reason Vane is doing so well with her case load. She joined us because she loves Aurors, not Auror work, and yet she hands in the most thorough Curse reports of any trainee. We all know it's because she always consults with you."
He felt his heart pounding in his chest and worried about the effect the night was having his health. Working as an Auror in the field wasn't usually this stressful.
His thoughts were interrupted when Abbott tried to stand. Draco's quick reflexes were the only reason Abbott didn't crack her head on the table as she crumpled to the floor.
'Race' was the first word that caught his eye, and a shiver ran down his back. Draco had learned to fly before he could walk, and his body had never showed the same talent on the ground that it displayed in the air. He could run, physically, but it wasn't a particularly fast or graceful act. It was certainly nothing that he wanted to do competitively or with an audience.
She laughed and swatted his shoulder. "Not in a million years." She pulled back and then halted as she studied his face. She could read him almost as well as his mother, and she would see the disappointment and humiliation in his features. He didn’t waste any effort trying to hide them. "What happened?"
“Well, I don’t.”  Draco tried to kiss him again, but Harry side-stepped away.  He tried twice more, his pout deepening with each failure.  “Fine!  Then I’m going to bed.”  He turned and stomped away.  Harry followed on his heels.  “If you think you’re coming to my room, you had better be planning to please me.”
Malfoy waved his hand as if ridding them of bad Quidditch teams. “Anyway, I just wanted to get a sense of your colouring. Now we can talk about the types of clothing you need. I assume you are here for a complete wardrobe overhaul and not just a pair of jeans to wear with your collection of oversized t-shirts and home-knit jumpers.”
to be there. The way the fabric of Draco’s clothing stretching across his lean muscle and clung to him, it was as if adorning his body were its reason to exist.
“What if …” Harry stopped to lick his own lips and swallow. “What if I touch you?” His face burned hotter. “I mean, does the charm hide from feeling?”
Draco looked back at the breathy tone of Potter's voice. Potter looked as if he were awaiting Draco's reply without breathing. No pressure on Draco's answer then. "I don't know!" So much for keeping his frustration from his voice. "Bake muffins?"
Draco was harassed constantly: at work, on the street, at pubs.  Clearly everyone could smell the virginity on him.  Why else was he hunted the way he was?  Perhaps once he was deflowered, they would leave him alone.  Or he could get someone to make them leave him alone.  Yes!  He would choose a possessive lover who would keep the others away.  It would have to be someone powerful.
What should he do? Leave? He looked at Potter who was folded in on himself and taking deep breaths. Draco couldn't leave him like that. He gently ran his hand up Potter's back and felt Potter briefly tense before relaxing under his touch.
As the weeks ticked by, more people came out of the woodwork. There was a woman who had been working at Flourish and Blotts for two decades, always hoping her vast knowledge of magical fiction and history would disguise her lack of magical ability. There was the witch who wrote about her worry for her ten-year-old son who had shown no sign of magic and probably wouldn’t get a letter from Hogwarts the next year. She told Gabby the interviews with Merryn and Jowan had given her hope for her son’s future for the first time.
A tension released in his chest as he realised he had made it without being seen.  He suppressed the laugh that he feared would sound a bit manic and allowed himself a smile instead.  He heard the sound of a door opening and looked to Luna's door.  She must have seen his approach.  She was expecting him.
Draco sat bolt upright as he realised his imagined lover looked startlingly similar to Potter. He must have been quite surprised as he could hear his heart pounding in his ears.
Harry was having none of it.  He let his determination show in his eyes, and Draco looked a bit wary.  In fact, he seemed afraid to be left alone with Harry, judging by how much later he stayed at the table than most nights.  Harry and Draco were usually the first to retire, but now Dave and they were the only ones left.
At the well-worn wooden table were two menus.  Draco and he each picked one up and read in silence.  Several minutes later, Harry realised that Draco was staring at him expectantly.  “Are you going to order?”
"You are going to save Harry from his virginity." Pansy's voice—flat and low—left it unclear if it was a statement or question. Draco didn't even look up from his book as he confirmed her very crude over-simplification of his plan. He was quite comfortable in the library he'd created in his flat's spare room and didn't need her distracting him any more than she had already. She didn't need to appreciate the finer points of his strategy. She certainly didn't need to understand his surprisingly noble urge to rescue Potter from himself.
“Hannah's working at the Leaky tonight,” Neville offered in a small, hopeful voice.  Harry laughed joyfully.  If Neville wanted to flirt with the girl he fancied, he should.
Harry cast a quick spell to repair the measuring cup then pulled Draco in for a hug. Draco was too exhausted to resist, and he sagged against Harry as if he were already asleep on his feet. Harry kissed the soft hair on the top of his head.
The heavy disappointment evaporated as quickly as it had settled. Malfoy was going to come to his house and watch him undress. And dress, but then undress again. Harry’s mind offered lots of fun ideas for how to undress and what to do once naked. Maybe Malfoy could model an outfit or two. Just so Harry could see how they were meant to be worn, of course.
Harry ran threw the cloud of dirt toward the tunnel. He hoped Draco was with him, but he couldn’t hear him over his own footsteps and the blood rushing in his ears. A bump to his elbow eased the tension in his chest. Draco was beside him. They were at the mouth of the tunnel. They were inside. They were—
“You want me to escort you to the wedding?” It wasn’t a no. It sounded like Draco just needed clarification.
“Well, boyfriend sounds rather . . . I don't know, domestic.”  Harry glanced from the mugs of tea—his with a snitch and Draco's with a little cauldron and the words “morning brew”—to the half-complete crossword and then back to the bed-rumpled man wearing the grey flannel pyjama bottoms he'd stolen from Harry that morning.  What about that scene wasn't domestic.  Draco seemed to have guessed his thoughts because he turned a little pink.
member of the faculty. Perhaps a spouse, but no reason to have separate beds. While sharing a bed with Potter might have occurred in one or two of Draco's odder dreams since returning to Hogwarts, it was not an option for two weeks of painful reality. Infectious illness or no.
Draco removed his robe and let the man slip the luscious material over his simple shirt and trousers. The silk was cool and incredibly soft.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought of using any surface Pansy and Longbottom might have used for their own groping. "
Mother nodded her head slightly. "Those are all plausible explanations for your request, but they are also false. You have a date."
Whatever Draco was doing over the past few years, it clearly included flying. He had always been naturally graceful on a broom, but the way he took to the Ministry broom as if he’d flown it for years spoke of experience.
They were so close. They were often close to each other, but this was different. Harry could feel the heat of Draco's breath, coming faster than necessary, against his face. He could almost taste him. He wanted to taste him, but he couldn't push without knowing for certain.
Harry’s assumption was proved correct when his foot slipped from where it had been perched on a rung of the stool and thumped to the floor. Draco startled like a cat, glaring at Harry from over his pan.
Draco fumbled with Potter's Muggle jumper.  It was some weird fabric and Draco found himself distracted by wondering what it was and what kind of animal it came from.
Malfoy was circling him like a wolf again, but this time the look in his eyes was a different kind of hunger.
Harry wasn't very good at talking about feelings and relationships, especially without Hermione to translate, but he suspected he and Draco needed to do just that.  Knowing that he worked best when he acted on impulse, he did not reflect on his words before speaking.
And maybe Draco would admit his undying love and they would live happily ever after with two and a half children and a dog. And maybe Umbridge would become a kind person, and Azkaban would be voted Tropical Resort of the Year and start serving daiquiris.
go out for drinks. What happened to hating him?" she mocked.  It was a good question. Hadn't he disliked Potter only weeks ago? And yet now he found himself enjoying the man's company.
Not that the whole Ministry hated him. He had earned a fair amount of respect among his co-workers in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and the public was slightly less aggressive now that working with Granger had led to the occasional civil interaction with the Golden Trio. Nothing like a
“Honestly, Potter. What did you think I did when I left?” Harry knew Draco had left England after Hogwarts, but there had been no word about where he’d gone or what he was doing.  Harry had never considered that Draco might have gone to another school after Hogwarts. “I earned three more N.E.W.T.s,” Draco went on, “as befits my intellect. I have eleven now.” Draco lifted his nose and smiled smugly. “I did so well, my professor asked me to stay on and research with him.”
But if Merryn had thought her interview would help the hotel, she was right. Hotel Kalmynsi wasn’t fully booked for the summer, but it was far from empty and both the dining room and the sunroom were regularly filled with happy diners.
“Did you mean it?” They had been walking for about twenty minutes in complete silence, and Harry couldn’t take it anymore.
Draco considered Granger's bushy hair and Weasley's garish red hair.  Even Longbottom's sandy blonde hair never seemed to sit quite right.  “Do you simply collect unusual hair?” he drawled.
Fuck, Draco was hard. So hard and so hot. Harry slid his hands into his cloak and began fumbling with the soft fabric of Draco’s jumper.
Draco smiled as he looked at the window across from the bed. The sky was already bright blue with only one or two small white clouds, and the morning sun was shining against Draco's pale hair and face. He was adorably rumpled from sleep and his hair was still the mess that only Harry was allowed to see. Draco turned his smile on Harry. 'Let's do it all.'
to do the right thing by staying away from the very attractive married man he still wanted to throw himself at whenever he had more than a couple of drinks. Harry was trying to do the right thing, but
“Hagrid you might be excited to hear that dragons will be part of the first trial.” Dumbledore told him. A smirk was on his face as if this would convince the groundskeeper. Adrian was completely aghast. He sat in the chair repetitively putting his head in his hands and lifting it up. It was a desperate attempt to understand the logic behind this.
Arlene shrugged. Luna was rarely wrong so they started walking to the Quidditch field. When it came into view they saw it had been changed again. An array of hedges had grown in the field and around the gaps in the stadium seats. Hagrid’s tall silhouette could be seen by a gap in the hedges. At this gap ministry workers could be seen moving stadium style seating near the entrance in a massive semi-circle.
Her body trembled, she couldn’t stop herself from falling to her hands and knees. She had just performed a ridiculously difficult act of magic. Two pairs of arms lifter her up. Ron and Harry were at her sides helping her to stand up. Ron asked, “blimey, how did you do that?”
All her quirks were great too. The creatures she referenced all the time. How no matter what happened she always had a positive attitude. Her foresight was very helpful even if it was out of her control and inconsistent. Luna was the friendliest person she had ever known in her entire life. There was nothing she did that wasn’t graceful or adorable.
He smiled and raised his hands in an innocent gesture. He said in a carefree tone, “fine headmaster. Have it your way. Play your little game.” He turned away and said aloud, “don’t you all have better things to do than stare at me?” He walked out of the great hall. Once he was out of sight and hearing of everyone he kicked a suit of armor down and screamed, “MOTHER FUCKERS! GODDAMN SONS OF BITCHES! FUCKING FUCK!” He sat down and muttered, “I can’t watch another daughter die.”
He told her, “not sure but even if they were then see it as a monument to their hardship and the trials they were forced through. They didn’t choose it but they built one of the most impressive structures on the entire planet. They lived terrible lives but the things they accomplished in that time will forever put them over their oppressors.” He snarled, “as for the slavers? Fuck them. They were too lazy and arrogant to do it themselves. They don’t deserve to be remembered.”
So it made sense that her mind drifted during this class. The realization came to her during one of her doze offs. She was in love with Luna Lovegood. Not the kind of love that you get between friends. The romantic variety was the one she felt for Luna. “Oh crap,” she muttered under her breath. Not in a bad way. She was just surprised.
The three contestants who didn’t make it sat in the dirt with looks of defeat in their eyes. Rusu looked enraged but could do nothing. Professor Karkaroff disagreed. He ran forward from the stands screaming, “one? Only one? DUMBLEDORE!”
They waved bye to each other and Draco began the long walk back to the Slytherin common room. The magical torches had gone out so he only had his wand light to rely on. His pace was brisk. Not from a rush but from excitement. His plan had worked and now he could be openly gay with Harry. They had to hide it from the rest of the school but being in a relationship with him made even that worry fade.
When they reached the Great Hall Ginny asked her, “do you feel like talking about what you said in class?”
He tapped her on the shoulder and told her, “he’s calling for someone to help us. He said we can take a seat here.” He pointed to some benches that gave an excellent view of the library. “He also said my Arabic isn’t too bad for an Englishman.” He seemed a little smug over that.
Professor Dumbledore reached his hand out to her and said, “Miss Connery, I look forward to seeing you in the tournament.” She tried to shake it lightly but he gripped her hard and shook it roughly. She got a glimpse of those mad eyes. She looked for too long and saw something she didn’t like. It looked like desire but combined with the madness in them it made something horrifying.
“Just a few minutes sir. I’ll let you know when I find something. You may take a seat.” The clerk began typing away at his computer.
Bets went all around the camp. Fred and George were all over the place trying to make ridiculous bets with anyone who would listen. Some were even for specific events or scores. Arlene found the whole idea ridiculous. She had no interest in bets.
Adrian Barnes woke up with a massive headache. He groaned as he sat up, the world swimming around him. He reached for the water he had set up last night and a potion guaranteed to remove a hangover. He drank both and hammers stopped pounding the inside of his skull. He summoned more water and sipped at it.
Luna took the chance to inform her, “we finished with the article. Is there anything you wanted to add?”
Over at the Gryffindor table someone picked up on the hint and began doing the same to Hermione’s hate mail. Soon the owls stopped coming. Arlene knew that they made an impression on a few people.
He led the way to the shed and opened the door. They went in to find an old fashioned, golden elevator. Arlene hadn’t expected this but they went into it and the doors closed. There was only one button. Adrian pushed it and the elevator started down slowly.
She was amazed by it and commented, “that’s so cool.” She followed Adrian and the uniformed man in. They checked in at the main desk and he talked with the staff for a few minutes. They went to the third floor and entered a room. As soon as they entered the room he began waving his wand everywhere.
Severus Snape sat in his office minutes after his encounter with Draco Malfoy. His eyes were still red from crying. His thoughts were milling in his head. Thoughts that hadn’t filled his head in years. He glared at a folded photo on his desk. It was a picture of Lily with that Potter but the picture was folded to hid Potter.
She put away her magazine and responded, “that would be great. Let’s go down to the Great Hall to talk it over.”
Adrian reached the door and found it open. He illuminated his wand as he moved inside. The house was dusty with sheets covering the furniture. The light he had seen was on the second floor. He moved room to room keeping his wand raised and the shield spell on his lips. He wanted to be able to defend himself fist and attack second.
He was returned to the surface. Severus looked up to see Dumbledore standing over him. He held a hand out to help him up. He gladly took the hand, hoping the nightmare was over. As he was pulled up the area around them came into focus. He realized the nightmare had just started.
They had the fence line to themselves. Luna had led them to the least popular spot to look at it from. It didn’t have a great view but they were guaranteed to be alone for a while. The sky was partly cloudy. Just enough to keep the sun from blinding you but not too much to make it gloomy. There was a constant gentle breeze. They had thin jackets on to keep them comfortable. A supply of wonderful smells was being supplied by the village. It was a wonderful day.
She had just finished catching her breath from the last dance. She answered, “yes. I want to go see the decorations.”
She made her way towards the scepters. She was no longer in second. Seven contestants lay between her and the scepters. She ran towards them. With her increased leg strength she made up the distance easily. Jumping two gaps and running around another pit of mud she made it nearly to the end. Just two large, ugly, and dangerous obstacles lay between her and a scepter.
He sat in his bed and cried for the last time in a long time. Knowing that it was time for changes. At some point he put a log in the fire to keep him warm the rest of the night.
Five minutes later she was walking down a corridor when shouts and flashes of wand fire appeared in front of her. She jogged towards it like she was supposed to but hated every step. She reached the scene and found Adrian already taking wands from students and saying, “no dueling in the corridors. I’ve told you this already.” He was stern but calm.
She grabbed his quill and circled the fire protection, Felix, and the standard sleep potion. Professor Snape looked at her choices and said, “Felix Felicis is an extremely difficult potion to brew. You’ll need almost ten doses of the standard sleeping potion to put down a dragon. That amount of ingredients will require compensation to the school.”
Arlene pulled a check from her pocket and carelessly wrote a check for a thousand galleons. She knew she needed a way to make money so she wouldn’t waste her fortune away but for now she could afford it. She slid it to him.
Hagrid had been hiding in his hut ever since the article after Arlene’s had come out. Somehow Skeeter had figured out that Hagrid was half giant. Everyone who didn’t know him was suddenly scared of the man who had been around Hogwarts all this time and never hurt anyone.
He snatched it away as she reached for it. She pleaded with him, “Professor, it makes more sense for me to hold on to it. You could get fired.”
They got in and rode the elevator to the surface. When they got to the top they did the process to get in but in reverse. Leave shed, go behind column, turn invisible, fly away on broom, return to hotel roof. They got their suitcases and Adrian apparated them to the beach house so she could drop off the restricted book. Then he apparated them to Hogwarts.
It was then that Professor McGonagall came back and said, “everything is ready. Please get with your partners and get ready to walk in.”
Arlene raised an eyebrow. “You could fit the Great Hall in the lobby of it. It has billions of books.” She didn’t mean to sound so snobby about it but she was being honest.
They appeared at the gates to begin the walk up to the castle. Their feet crunched in the snow. Arlene asked him a question, “Adrian, you had all the information in the world at your hands. You could’ve looked up anything. Why did you just want to leave?”
