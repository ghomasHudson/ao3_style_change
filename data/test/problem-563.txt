Harry, without preamble only a breathy moan, pulled his fingers out and lined himself up. He kept his hands secured around Draco’s waist to hold up securely up. He looked up, trailing up to Draco’s body into his eyes. “Alright.”
conversation we’ve ever had Potter. Why are you being nice to me.”
Harry was
“Observant, Potter” he challenged back.
Harry had just begin to worry that Draco wouldn’t show when his breath caught. Draco walked in looking
“Who’s also been through hell?” Draco supplied, sarcasm drying out his voice.
Kissing Harry, after literal years of denial and repression, woke up just a hopeful part of Draco. One it he had thought he had mastered at repressing. Merlin knows he doesn’t deserve it, but it gave him a little bit of hope. That he might not be so monstrous if Harry could kiss him, kiss him back.
“You realize this is probably the longest conversation we’ve ever had right?” Harry teased, raising an eye brow.
“Hey” she started, and Harry realized she looked tired.
He felt it, it being Harry’s predictably soft lips press firmly against his own. Draco went in for a
“Ginny, you...I really do love you, as a friend. And I...I’m just not, I think I’m gay Gin. Or at least very male leaning bi.”
When they pulled back, only slightly, Draco felt more complete, as though that had answered a question he didn’t even know to ask.
“Let it go.”
Harry tightened his hold on Draco, “tomorrow, love, tomorrow.”
“And why’s that?”
“Oh?”
“Bloody hell- Well you don’t waste anytime then” Draco’s shocked reply matching the shock on his masked,
Before Harry could make any more noise, because Draco knew there was no way in
The three laughed, Barren taking another step closer so they were toe to toe. “I don’t need your words, rat. I don’t need your act.”
“Who’re you?” Harry spat, his voice thin. Weasel had stood up behind Harry, looking like he was ready to grab him less he acting stupidly. Which was entirely likely.
“Please...fuck me” Draco whispered, whimpering with each thrust. Harry moaned, nodding before he kept his grip on Malfoy’s waist and spun them. Draco’s back slammed against the bed. In an instant, Harry had tucked Draco’s legs over his shoulders and pushed into him again. The new angle was electric. Harry felt himself pulse inside Draco’s heat, leaning down to kiss an incoherent Draco.
“Ever?” Harry asked, seeming surprised.
“Potter.” Draco snapped, hoping his voice came out clear and not as turbulent as he felt.
There were a few more rounds of ‘Twister’ as it was apparently called, each one causing everyone to drunker. Draco hadn’t been planning on it but being so close to Potter...sobriety was not an option. And it was...nice? Not the best time in the world but no one was scoffing at him. Sure Weasley hadn’t exactly spoken to him but no one excluded him.
“What are you doing after?” Tom questioned casually. But Harry felt his skin crawl. He knew Draco had been with other men before him, and it didn’t bother Harry that would be possessive and ridiculous but now that Draco was
“Patience” Harry teased, using his hands to coax Draco’s pants off his slim hips, all while pressing hot kisses on the inside of his thighs.
The words “I love you” hung around the air, were pressed into the others mouths with tongues, but weren’t said. Because it had been less than 24 hours, because what if the other ran, if it was too much, too soon. The words “I love you” were made physical by Harry’s hands on Draco’s waist, pulling him closer and holding him there. By Draco’s lips pressing into Harry’s, by his tongue tracing the words he couldn’t say.
Draco looked down again, but Harry stepped closer taking both of Draco’s wrists to keep him close, “I just read about it in...it was Snape’s spell. I didn’t know and I...Draco,
Harry. Draco became distantly aware of a soft laugh.

Draco took a deep breath, shaking hands unbuttoning the cufflink on his shirt sleeve, waited a moment and pushed the sleeve down. On his arm there was the Dark Mark, as expected but on it...Harry felt sick. A deep scar than the entire length of the mark, the skin around in seemed into fall into it, the cut was so deep. Horizontally, there were...too many,
Potter raised his eye brow and stood up, immediately in Malfoy’s space. They met eyes, Potter’s expression unreadable to Malfoy.
“Say it” Harry pressed, curling his fingers and enjoyed how Draco squirmed underneath him.
Draco grasped, feeling the full length of Harry’s erection against his. Harry kept one hand on the small of Draco’s back, pulling Draco’s hips in against his own while the rest of Harry’s body kept him pushed against the wall and
, Draco smirked, reveling in the feeling of Harry’s erection meeting his. “More” he whispered, though it was lost in Harry’s mouth. But Harry nodded, tightening his grip on Draco’s thighs and turned, walking back to the bed and practically throwing both of them on it.
“Excuse me for wanting to see my
“What happened?” She asked Draco, sounding more sincerely concerned than Draco excepted.
As if on cue, the door burst open and in came Harry and the two other Gryffindor’s...Dean and...Sean? Maybe? Harry entered, with a smug smile that made Draco’s heart beat a few paced faster, and held up a full cart of Fire Whiskey. “Who’s ready?”
The brunette’s eyes widened, a moan echoing through their conjoined mouths. They stayed like that for a few seconds longer, before Draco pulled back. “Be good.” And dropped to his knees.
“We’re onto you and Golden Boy” Barren sneered and Draco’s heart stopped. “You know you’re rooming together. Don’t you dare think that you’ll get away with killing him now, because we’ll be watching you-“
“Draco, I think people care a lot less about us than you think they do” countered Harry, keeping two needy hands on Draco’s waist. The need no longer was physical, but just to keep Draco close. He wasn’t entirely sure how badly Draco meant it when he said he wanted to jump. And when. So Harry kept his hands on Draco’s waist, restraining himself from just pulling him into his arms again.
“Oh-“
Immediately, Draco moaned, hands gripping the sheets tightly. “Holy
The group had gone on ahead, back to the locker room, by the time Draco snapped out of his thought. Boy Wonder was still there though. Damn him.
Draco bit his own lip hard to not give Harry the satisfaction of moaning at his voice alone. Draco nodded, leaning in to brush his lips against Harry’s, pale eyes meeting piercing green ones before whispering, “yes, I want you to fuck me...
“How are you?...there?” Harry asked gently, his large, warm hands gently holding onto where Draco’s thighs met his ass. Harry let one of his hands slide forward, slipping inbetween in front of Draco’s thighs. Not in a sexual way, per way, but more cautionary.
“Let him. Give him something to discover” Harry teased back, pushing back against Draco to kissing him hungrily. Draco responded just as fiercely before pulling back again.
“Just good?” Taunted Draco but there was not much heat in it. He used the hand he had in Harry’s hair to tug his head up, “no marks” Draco whispered, before kissing Harry hard. Harry responded immediately, pressing into Draco’s mouth with his tongue, reveling in the way Draco’s mouth moved against his.
“Most of the Wizarding World seems to think so.”
“Malfoy. I hoped we’d find you here.” The leader smirked, taking a wide, confident stance.
“Names. Draco, please, give me their names.”
who was the bloody Chosen One. It was also just a bit hot, having Harry be so protective of him. A novel feeling. “This is why we can never be public.” Draco whispered, watching for Harry’s reaction.
“Good.” Harry murmured softly, kissing the hand Draco had laying near him. “You glamored your dark mark yesterday.”
“I want to feel you” Draco whispered, feeling slightly self conscious but more than anything painfully turned on and sinfully empty.
years. Seemed a bit unfair if you asked Draco, to have some of the most experiences players all on one team. Part of him was secretly he would be playing
Potter would be if he showed any public sign of affection.
“I think fucking is very personal-“ Draco was cut off as Harry trailed his hands up Draco’s thighs, kissing along his collar bone. He wondered if Harry could feel that he was already half hard.
he felt. “You okay?” Draco heard Harry ask gently, and Draco nodded, “just...don’t move.”
Before he took off, Draco quickly checked to ensure his glamor’s were still intact. Which they were. Priorities. Draco mounted the broom, not as gracefully as he might have liked and flew off towards the quidditch pitch.
“I was a bit of a prat. I just didn’t know how to...you know.” Draco mumbled, wondering how many times Harry could call him ‘love’ before they were forced to talk about it. At least three times apparently.
was too wonderful to let go. At least right now.
Draco turned, ignoring Barren’s presence all together. Harry saw red begin to cloud his vision. If breaking Draco’s ankle was Barren’s introduction, he shuddered to think what would follow. Not that Harry would allow it of course.
Draco looked up at him, the words so sincere that made Draco feel the need to jump because he couldn’t stand hearing his fear was validated, that he’s deserves to want to live. Not that he particularly wants to recently. Especially not now.
Harry shook his head, hand gripping Draco’s hand tightly. “
was too wonderful.
“Oh stop it” Granger scoffed at Ron, although there was no heat in it.
“A good one.”
Draco got up off his chair, crossing the circle to Granger and kneeling down in front of her. He checked for a nod, that it was okay, before lightly pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth, really her cheek.
he whispered again, starting to feel needy.
The blonde gasped, arching into the surprise touch. “Bloody hell, Potter. Eager, aren’t we?”
On the other side of the circle, Potter held his breath too, watching it intently.
Potter looked up at him and
. He thought he was just playing into Harry’s fantasy but maybe this was something for him too. He shook his head, thoughts later, Harry now.
“Stop talking,” Draco commanded, though it was more of a whine. He felt so empty he couldn’t take it anymore.
year dinner-“ Draco began listing but stopped when Harry bit into the junction between his neck and shoulder.
“Hey.”
He put his glamor’s back up before whispering “alohamora” he whispered, the door opening to reveal...Luna? The only other person close to as pale as Draco was stood in the doorway, smiling whimsically. “Hello Draco.”
“They’re all drunk anyway-“
Harry met Draco’s eyes, understanding the concern laid there even if he didn’t agree. And he knew, deep down, it was concern above all, not fear. Harry turned back to Barren, who had stood up with a nasty bruise forming under his eye. “I don’t need magic to deal with someone like you. Stay away.”
“What? It’s just a name...
“Alllright” Seamus announced after Blaise had fallen, crowning Weasley as the king of that round. “Now that we’ve gotten warmed up...let’s play a real game.”
Draco thinks distantly, his entire body feeling like it’s being sucked dry by a thousand paper cuts.
Draco’s shirt was fully unbuttoned and Harry was staring at the scars that ran all across his torso. The worst one being a jagged one that almost followed along his v-line on the left before jetting into his stomach.
Draco couldn’t help but role his eyes, “you nearly had
“Yes, that is your name, very clever.”
“You train as a night worker over the summer?” Draco teased because what else was he supposed to do?
. He sighed, trying to get the (disturbingly common) thought out of his head.
Dean nodded, “yup. Okay, who has a question for Hermione?”
“Can’t bloody guess Potter?” Draco teased, though there was no heat in it.
Leave a comment if you enjoyed it! I know this chapter was heavy, thank you for enduring.
“Can I help with you something?”
“Well, I don’t exactly

The problem came when the try outs were over. Draco briefly considered just flying away. It wouldn’t be
“I’m the keeper.” Barren responded proudly, “or, I’m hoping to be.”
“I know....friends?”
“You say that now-“
When he started to gain any sort of coherency, tingling pleasure still racing through his body, he felt Draco clench around him and white hot release coat both of them. Harry fucked into him until he was afraid he’d drop Draco.

year table, going for the open spot across from Harry, a 7
to Potter’s face with this many people watching them.
Draco nodded, “I was distracted. We Malfoy’s bruise easily. Now, are you going to take me to the hospital wing or shall I have to walk there myself?” With that Potter gave in. They both mounted their brooms again and flew off to the hospital wing.
The said skeleton finally stepped out of the archway, and turned to the right, where the Slytherin common room was. Only, mid turn he changed his mind, pivoting left so quickly Harry didn’t have the chance to move, and crashed into Harry, sending both tumbling back, the invisibility cloak sliding off.
years got there, he brushed his fingers along his thighs were he knew Potter’s fingers were bruised into him. He ran his fingers over his collar bone, where his skin still tingled from Potter’s kisses. Before he finally placed his hand on his heart, and felt it beat against his hands, beat for that Stupid Potter boy. Harry. Draco smiled into his broom polish as he corrected himself, before the smile quickly faded as the sound of footsteps approached.
Especially when Harry lightly traced Draco’s collar bone then stopped at his shirt buttons. Draco bit his lip, knowing this was the point when all went wrong last time. Harry ghosted his fingers down Draco’s torso and the blonde shivered. Harry leaned down kissing at the bottom of the scar on Draco’s face, right below the jaw and kissing up it at the same time his hands rubbed at where Draco’s nipples were.
And oh Draco was going to
Once there, it took no time for Madam Pomfrey to see right through his story. Which is unfortunate for Draco, as Potter had refused to leave his side. Draco was sat, like a goddamn damsel in his opinion, on the hospital bed with his ankle propped up. Harry sat in the chair beside him and Madam Pomfrey stood over him, eye brow raised.
Harry leaned down to kiss him, which Draco responded to instantly, licking into Harry’s mouth and trailing his hand down to grasp Harry’s member. Harry groaned at the contact, bucking into Draco’s hand immediately. But he soon pulled back, shaking his head. “This is for you, remember?”
“Oh shut up” Harry sighed.
Well, if nothing else the next few hours certainly won’t be the worst thing Harry’s lived through in the castle in the very least. On his walk to Gryffindor common room, Harry couldn’t stop scanning those who walked past him, anger making his skin crawl, as though Draco’s assailants would just come up and announce themselves to him. But then again, maybe they would. Stranger things had happened. Either way, nothing deterred him from glaring suspiciously as every Gryffindor who walked past him.
Draco, instinctively had stood up, grabbing Harry’s shoulder, afraid he may topple off. Harry stilled, turning to Draco and gave him a smile that looked a little manic. “Try it.”
Until now, they had stayed on opposite sides of the board, having twisted around the other two players rather than each other.
In the Gryffindor common room, things weren’t awkward thank Merlin, everyone had known each other too long for that. It was a lot of reminiscing, of teasing. Ginny sat opposite from Harry, never glaring but not making a point to converse with him. It was pleasant, and nice to be surrounded by his friends again but truthfully, Harry just longed to be back in his room with Draco.
Draco sat up, leaning over Harry and gently framing Harry’s face with his hands. “You
on kissing Potter earlier, he just couldn’t stop himself.  Draco was the one who wanted to keep the relationship a secret sure but he didn’t know how bloody
Harry leaned down, kissing Draco who responded immediately. This kiss felt deeper, more intimate somehow. As they kissed, Harry put his other hand on Draco’s torso, and Draco felt his cock twitch at the feeling of Harry’s large hands massaging up and down his chest. No one had touched him there. Not since that night in the bathrooms.
It was worth it because of how
Two of Barren’s cronies, who Draco recognized from yesterday but couldn’t remember their names (though he did distinctly remember one of them sounded a lot like ‘kill’), cut Draco off in his attempt to leave. They didn’t hold onto him, but made a considerably intimidating wall. Harry stepped in front of Draco right  as Barren took a step forward.
Blood. There’s blood
“I just wanted to see you” She-weasel whispered.
Draco moaned, though it was more like babbling at this point. His control was dropping fast and more embarrassing noises start to come out of him. But they only seemed to spur Harry on more.
“Then how can I help you?” Draco leveled, doing his best to manifest the same bored persona he had and refused to step back.
“Because I don’t need to be saved-“
, he corrected himself, only highlighted how permanently far he will forever be from
Draco stilled, not wanting to wake him up. He settled instead for studying Potter’s face, trying to understand how exactly this had happened. What had Potter said last night, about waiting so long to kiss him? How long? Was this, were they inevitable? Had they just been delaying years of tension? Or had Potter simply had too much to drink tonight and needed a rebound...
Draco started to feel
“I believe you promised something else for tonight” Potter pointed out, crawling back between Draco’s legs and kissing him hard. Draco responded enthusiastically, rolling his hips up to meet Potter’s. Harry had always been a passionate person, and especially in the last twenty-four hours, Draco thought he had truly discovered how passionate Potter could be. But this, clearly jealous, possessive, wound up Potter? Breath taking. Draco could only react to whatever Potter had planned and he had no complaints.
“And you don’t end thigs fully with Ginny until then.”

without any sense of relief.
Quidditch trials went alright. Honestly, if anything it was a decent distraction from the pain while also being a good time to plan what the hell he was gonna tell Potter. I mean he was going to have to walk

cared if I was hurt or...I’m not used to kindness.” Draco summarized, feeling Harry’s hands ground him.
year feast. You’re not skipping out on this one” Granger informed Harry.
Draco felt his back hit the door, hard. Harry had him pressed against the door, hands still gripping Draco’s thighs to hold him up but now Harry was pressed right in between Draco’s legs, right into his crotch and Draco couldn’t help the obscene moan that escaped his mouth. Thank Merlin for silencing charms.
“Socks are slippery” Potter taunted, looking up at Draco with determination.
“The bloody hell was that?” Demanded Harry, the anger seeping through his tone despite his best efforts.
Harry kissed back just as hard, moving his hands to bracket either side of Draco, to support his weight. He nipped at the bottom of Draco’s lip, smiling when Draco let out a small moan that Harry happily swallowed up. Draco tugged more, costing Harry his balance so he landed fully ontop of Draco.
“Git”
Tucked away in a corner of the court yard that was mostly surrounded by bushes, but still very much in the middle of the mulling students, Draco stood in wait under the cloak.
He worked very hard to maintain his composer, “sorry?”
“I hit the table really hard” shrugged Draco.
“-what I can from Madam Pomphrey. Expect an owl. Try not to pass out on your way to the dormitory.” Snape’s voice came, along with the man himself as the door opened. Snape looked around a few times before hurrying off. Harry held his breath, waiting for....
“Suits me” Harry shrugged, standing behind Draco in a way that admittedly had them both a little flushed and draped the cloak over both of them. “You said you wanted to keep it secret.” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear and the walked down the corridor, making Draco flush slightly.
is holding you to the standard you’ve made up except for you.”
“If she doesn’t make you happy, shouldn’t you just say ‘fuck it’ then?” Draco supplied.
Draco sat up, straddling Harry, and swatted at his chest. “I didn’t know you were such an exhibitionist.”
After a moment, Harry decided to bite down on his question(s) and did as told, walking over to one of the stone inlets in the courtyard. Not private by any means but definitely not in the center either. Draco followed him, checked to make sure no one was looking directly at Harry, then quickly enveloped Harry in the cloak too.
In the end, they only spent about half an hour in the shower refraining, mostly, from touching the other. Once they were dressed in their uniforms, Malfoy’s hair in the same ‘lose’ style he wore last night and Potter with his usual ‘bed head’, they were ready for the day. Or, more specifically, potions class.
“Was this your plan all along?”
Harry stayed very still, hidden under the cloak, as the footsteps approached the door.
Draco felt his ankle being elevated, Harry propping it up on two pillows. When Harry stood next to Draco, it occurred to him that this was the first time they’ve been alone since last night. Gently, Draco reached up, reaching for Harry’s hand which Harry immediately took.
“Why the hell not, Draco?” Harry challenged, not letting Draco out of his grasp.
Draco zoomed through the air, up into the sky at the level of the bleachers. He looked behind him and yes, there was Potter racing after him and grinning like a maniac. Draco found himself smiling back, before turning back forward and leaning forward.
“We don’t have to be best friends or anything but...I’ll make an effort if you make one too.” Harry stuck a hand out, which Draco eyed carefully before slowly extending his own hand and shaking Harry’s.
“I have a hard time opening up” Harry whispered, not even aware he was going to speak. Draco watched him with kind, but intense eyes. Harry’s gaze flickered to Draco’s lips then back up before continuing, “what I mean is, I’m quite shit with words, most of the time but movement- er,
This spurred Harry on, after giving Draco a little time to get used to the stretch, started to pulse in and out. With each pulse, Draco felt himself get harder and harder. No one had done this to him before, for him.  And here was Potter, face buried between Draco’s legs, tongue fucking him with such enthusiasm that Draco almost felt bad.
“You seem to like it” Harry smirked, pressing a hot, open mouthed kiss on Draco’s very obvious bulge.
“Did you like your surprise?” Draco whispered, tucking his face into Harry’s shoulder.
for Draco. Even before his scars, which amplified it in a different way. He would limit his meals, keep journals of his weight. His body was his temple, one he had spent years constructing. To know someone, and especially someone that was publicly qualified as
He refocused on Draco as Draco pulled the tarp off the painting. Harry stared at the canvas. It was strangely beautiful. Grisly and bloody and gruesome, but beautiful too.
Draco nodded. “Bed now.”
“Why?” Harry wanted to know.
Harry could feel the blush rising, but could do nothing to stop it.
“Your cock and my ass are about to meet for the first time and you promised to ruin me for everyone else, so yes, I do feel a bit smug about it right now.”
“Curiosity,” Harry answered, because he had been caught off guard. “Are you going to move back in?” He asked, before Draco could ask another question.
“Don’t get in too deep with him,” Astra warned as she made her way to the door.
Joel was throwing everything at it; curse after hex after jinx, but it was all being absorbed by the barrier. Draco was standing a few feet away, watching Joel. He didn’t feel anything. Nothing at all. No love, regret, or hate.
If everything went according to the plan, this whole thing would be over the day after tomorrow and Draco would go back to his life, but he would also have Harry now. It had only taken seventeen years to get Harry Potter to take his hand, but now that he had Harry’s fingers securely in his, he wasn’t going to let go. He grabbed Harry’s hand and intertwined their fingers. He was staring at their hands, or precisely at the lack of ornaments on Harry’s fingers.
“Parkinson,” Harry said.
“Draco,” Harry said and left the classroom.
And why should anyone else be, Draco thought fondly, when Luna is not?
“I’ll be at the cottage,” Harry said and apparated back to the house he had shared for weeks with Antoine. There was nothing he could do, but wait for Draco and Antoine to come back. Harry was pretty sure that the woman wouldn’t be with them. Antoine would find a safe place for her. Far away from any wizards.
The letter hadn’t made anything clear, but he had hoped that Blaise would see him, purely because he was Harry Potter and all Slytherins were opportunists to some degree. Which wasn’t a bad thing at all.
Bain cleared her throat. “We have good news, Minister Winters and Hermione have a place and time for well, the trap. We only brought in people we trust, which isn’t much backup, I admit, but we will do our best to keep you two safe.”
“Well, I have a talent for bringing people together,” Draco cut in.
“Yes. They didn’t develop slowly. They were just there when I woke up in that forest,” Draco answered.
He stepped outside in the garden and took a deep breath as the grass tickled his naked toes. This was better. As he stood there looking over his wild garden, a scene from ‘Amongst wolves’ came to mind and he wondered if H.J. Belladonna had been looking at something like this when he or she wrote it. For some reason that made him smile. It was like a tiny thread of connection had been spun between Harry and the mysterious author.
“I hate the title, and I think you should bury that thing,” Pansy said. “Not sell it to some sick person who would probably get off on it.”
“Read it?” Potter asked.
“Someone else could have used it on him,” Draco said.
“No, no one else.”
“What, fuck a man?” Harry asked, breathlessly, because Draco’s gaze was boring into him and Draco’s hands were playing with his nipples tenderly and he could feel Draco’s warm skin against his own and it wasn’t enough. He was going to go insane at this rate.
“Well, maybe you can come over then. I’m making lunch, and there's cake."
“What did McGonagall want?“ Blaise asked. He was one of the few Seventh-year Slytherins who had come back to Hogwarts to finish their education.
“Have you eaten?” Luna asked.
“Because it would be beneficial for our future?”
“Well, then no, I don’t think I am okay,“ Harry said. The name felt right, familiar, but the people around him, or the room? No, he had no idea who they were or where he was.
“Okay, it’s all instinct and Felix from here,” Harry whispered as they made their way to the front door.
“Yes, but I also nearly killed you once, Draco. I can see the scar from that every time we have sex.”
“I never asked you why you spoke up for us, me and my mother in particular, but also Pansy,” Malfoy said.
“Have you been with anyone like this before?” Harry asked, and kissed his nape. It made Draco shudder.
“Or outside in the garden, we haven’t fucked outside yet, which is a shame, really,” Draco continued.
“Good for you, Potter, you don’t have to marry me.”
Ron snorted. “Right.”
She laughed. “Well, it’s a good thing you like her.”
Draco surely felt that way in this moment.
“Are you staring?” Harry asked, he could feel the blush creep up his neck, but his cock was still interested in what was going on.
“You know you can’t bring him in, right?”
Draco honestly wasn’t sure. “Maybe?“
“Because when we started our lessons all those weeks ago, you had to conceal a bruise on you jaw, Draco,” Harry said.
“It was an enchanting little thing,” Harry admitted. “I was still new to magic and your little bird was – well, magical.”
“I can't use magic! I'm a born vampire,” Antoine said.
The little owl perked up and cocked her head. She looked a bit haughty and a bit regal. Draco liked that about Hell.
“Why would you make an exception? Why would you change someone?”
“Well, I can’t say I am happy about the fact that you are on the murderer’s list, but at least you won’t have to hold back now. Everything goes when it comes down to them or you.”
“You would want to keep it?” Harry asked.
“I’m not afraid,” Harry said.
“I know that you realize that I am older than I look.”
“Good looking bloke,” Draco commented.
“Why, you looked nearly disappointed for a second there,” he added.
The truth was also that in a pureblood household these things were not spoken about. He hadn’t read a single book, hadn’t even come across a poem about a same sex romance. Things were slowly changing now, with the influence of Muggle – born wizards and witches coming to Howards and settling down amongst wizards, but back in the day Draco had to figure it all out on his own. Well, with Blaise‘s and Pansy’s help.
“I’m not the author of these novels,“ Harry said. Even to his own ears he sounded a bit scandalized. He sure as hell could never come up with such poetic pornography. He hadn’t even thought of doing half the things that had been described in those novels.
“Go and talk to her then, after you’ve resigned from the Aurors,” Antoine said.
“No,” Henri said.
Draco grabbed a fistful of Harry’s hair and pulled gently so Harry looked at him. The green of his eyes was nearly swallowed by the dark of his arousal. “I need you to hear me, Harry. It will be fine. I will be fine. We will come back here after and then we will fuck in every single room in this house.”
Inviting Draco to dinner was not an easy task. He had been well aware that Harry being Harry wouldn’t work on Draco – at all. He had known that he would have to work for it and maybe it was the fact that he had to work for it that made him keep it up. That added to the excitement of it all.
“Yes, the sex-club. He was one of the employees there.”
She nodded. “You liked it.“
“I don’t remember,” Harry said.
“You might be the most powerful wizard in the world now, Draco."
“Yeah, well...not the word I would use,” Draco replied. He turned and looked at the painting again, taking in all the colours and details. The grisly, grisly details. He heard Luna snap a picture and knew it would be on its way to the Ministry.
“He can’t blackmail you with something that isn’t there, Draco,” Blaise said reasonably. “Over the last few years you did your best to be a good person. You reflected on the way you were raised, you acknowledged your mistakes and you hooked up with Harry Potter.”
“Except Harry,” Draco said.
“You messed up and-“
It was that night again, and Joel was saying something funny, and he was touching Draco, and they had been kissing the whole evening between touching and teasing. It was leading up to—well, sex. Draco had fooled around with both genders during his stay in France, but confirmed his suspicion pretty fast that he wasn’t turned on by women, so he stuck to men.
“But later-”
“I was a dangerous, cunning, evil Death Eater,” Draco replied, sarcasm heavy in his voice.
“The no touching thing, when did that start?”
Draco waved his hand and Potter’s clothes were dry in an instant. “You look like death warmed over,” he added, opening the door wider so Potter could come in.
Harry grabbed his arm to stop him, though he couldn't say why. Draco sucked in a sharp breath, then screamed. It happened so fast Harry barely had time to register the sound before Pansy was there, looking furious. She tore Harry away from Draco and turned on him.
“You've been looking for us, why?”
“I was murdered, sacrificed to some old gods, I think. That's what happened to me, Potter.”
“Rings,” Draco said without thinking, because that had been on his mind. Rings.
“Yes, I understand,” Potter said. “I never went back to the house I grew up in either, after I didn’t have to.”
“Now, if you are up for it,” Draco whispered against Harry’s ear. He could feel that Harry was up for it. Harry’s breathing was becoming faster, and his cock was getting hard. His fingers were bunching up Draco’s robes.
“Targets?” Draco asked, because his Vision hadn’t shown him any faces this time around.
“Unpredictable, my life,” Draco replied.
“You tried and you failed, and then you tried again and again and again and failed, again and again and again. What makes you think you can do it this time?”
“You’re leaning into it now hard, Draco,” Blaise said.
“Wouldn’t be the first time you broke the rules. As far as I can remember it’s what made you the hero of the wizarding world. Never playing by the rules worked for you very well.”
The knock on his door startled Draco so hard he nearly spilled ink on his document. He turned around and glared. It was Potter of course.
“I think that justice and vengeance are the same thing sometimes, and if there is no one who can stop me, why should I stop?” He kissed Harry’s frown away. “Besides, I like working with Henri.”
Harry took a deep breath. “Because he took the Dark Mark?”
“Of course,” Draco replied. “Call the gang then, I need to eat something and tea. I didn’t even have my fucking morning tea.”
“I’m not stalking you, Draco,” Harry said. It was a strange pleasure to use Malfoy’s first name in front of Draco himself.
Potter spun around then and Draco let go of his shirt and stepped away. He was feeling as breathless as Potter looked.
“I don’t know how much good it will do.”
“It is a bit more complicated than that, and I hope you understand that I can't really talk about it with someone who is not a vampire or about to become one.”
“No,” Draco cut in sharply.
Draco nodded. “Now if you could kindly stop stalking me?”
Astra shrugged. “I guess he did make a lot of enemies, the day he let the Deatheaters into Hogwarts, besides I like to cover all our bases. I mean, we lost one already and – I don’t like what they did during the war, but I like murderers even less.” She looked around the library, which was decorated in light woods and blues and greens with gold accents. It looked old, but in an inviting way. Harry had to admit that he rather liked Malfoy’s house, or well Manor, as Malfoy didn’t really do houses these days.
“You know it?”
“As I remember you liked when I did research for ‘Knots’,” Draco whispered.
“I apologize. It's a sensitive subject.”
“It was an opportunity to get what I always wanted: to be your friend. So yes, that was my reasoning behind it, but maybe, maybe I felt that pull too. Felt it from the first time I saw you, Harry.”
“Do you change Muggles often?”
“You can’t use my home as your personal hotel, Blaise,“ Draco said, but he was already grabbing two cups out of the cupboard. He was too tired to use magic, after writing the whole night, he felt like all the magic had been absorbed by his parchment. Some of his sanity maybe too.
He nodded; he was hungry, and if he was honest with himself he wasn’t too keen on being in the same room with ‘The Artist in Agony’ either.
“Maybe,” Harry allowed and then bent down to kiss the scar. It wasn’t especially sensitive or anything, but Harry seemed obsessed with it – on some nights more than others.
“You like it when I praise you,” Draco said, it wasn’t really a question, but Harry answered anyway.
“Is that why you’re so angry?”
“I read you went to school with him."
“Thank you, Astra,” Harry replied.
Shit, Draco thought, when realization hit. “It was reckless, it was stupid, it was dangerous.”
“I don’t think so, Auror Potter,” Henri said.
“So what will you do now?” Antoine asked the next day. Draco was still asleep and dead to the world. In the truest sense too, Harry realized suddenly.
Blaise grinned at him. His ass was leaning against Draco’s desk and it was clear he had been waiting for Draco to come back to their shared room. “I know, Draco.”
“I want to seal the house,” he repeated, because there was no way in hell he would let someone ransack it – not again. This was his home.
“We’re getting out of here,” Harry decided.
“Is that a reason why you keep mostly to your own kind?” Despite himself Harry was fascinated by Antoine, and vampires. He was living his own version of ‘Voyages with vampires’ and it was nothing like the book.
He just stood there and stared at it all. It must have been really beautiful once upon a time.
“You look like you got laid, Harry Potter,” Ivan said and Harry was glad he hadn’t used ‘Auror Potter’. So shortly after hearing Draco saying it while he was naked...well, better not to think about being naked in Draco’s presence.
Harry nodded in understanding. “What about the manor?”
“The sex-club,” Weasley said.
“Good, see you in half an hour Harry. Don’t think I will go easy on you.”
“Who?“ he asked and tried to sit up, but his body wasn’t really up for it, so he let himself sink down slowly back onto the floor and looked at the ceiling. The ceiling was calm and dark.
“Just to state the obvious,” Draco said between kisses and they were really good kisses, they made Harry’s stomach flip and his cock pay attention. He wanted more of them. He wanted more of Draco’s clever, cruel mouth against his. “This is a bad idea.”
“For better or for worse,” Draco added with a smile.
Potter didn’t have a comeback to that and Draco was seriously doubting his sanity. He should be inside, looking for things left behind by the ministry. Trinkets really, relicts of his old life, that he could maybe sell.
“Okay?” Draco said, because Potter was going somewhere with this, he could feel it.
“Merlin you do feel so good around my cock,” Draco said against Potter’s skin and Potter laughed, which sent all kinds of sensations through Draco’s body. He couldn’t hold back then and fucked Potter hard. It didn’t take long for Potter to spill against the dark leather and Draco followed soon after. He bit Potter’s shoulder, leaving a mark on his own on Potter’s skin.
“Not of you, I’m not,” Harry answered.
“Yes, maybe not as friends, but as whatever we are now.”
“You think tomorrow everything will be better? He will still be my lover, you…you, to hell with this Potter!”
“One way to find out,” Draco answered, grabbing Harry by his shirt and pulling him into a kiss. It wasn’t a soft kiss, nor was it hard or passionate, but it was the best kiss Draco had ever had.
He started slow, not only for Draco’s sake, but his own too. He wanted to savor this, to commit it to memory. The feel of it, the heat, the friction. The way Draco’s body responded.
“Pretty much,” Draco replied.
“Not with me,” Draco replied. He was running slow, small circles around Harry’s hole for what seemed like hours before he pushed in the first finger. It was a tease really. It seemed to Harry like Draco took forever to add a second one and when he finally added a third Harry was a sweaty mess, ready to beg Draco to finally do it.
Draco nodded. “It’s a pleasure spell.”
“How did that come out wrong?” Harry asked. He had the urge to rub the bridge of his nose, but it was a nervous habit and a tell and he didn’t feel like he could show Draco Malfoy any weaknesses right now.
The manor felt empty, he honestly didn’t know why he was even still here.
“I don’t know. Something Luna had said,” Harry confessed.
“Yes, because the other option I have right now is you and – that doesn’t seem like an option at all.” Draco was aware that this was kind of an invitation. Maybe it was the Firewhiskey that made him say it, maybe it had been the days and days of proximity to Potter. They had been dancing around each other basically from day one after all.
“Oh, come on. You know me better than this. I love you and I want you to be happy and if it’s with Potter of all people, good for you. Took you long enough. No Draco, I don’t like it because of the serial killer who will mostly likely go after you.”
“Yes, that is the idea, no matter what pretty words we use,” Draco replied and kissed him hard.
“Wasn’t your banishment self-imposed?” Harry asked.
Draco shook his head, fondly. “That’s what friends are for after all.”
“We know what was supposed to happen,” Henri threw in. “I looked in the archives in France for something similar to the ritual you described to us, Mr. Malfoy, and I think I found the original that was used as a template.” He took copies out of his bag and passed them around. They took a few moments to read through it all. It was gruesome, and Henri was right that it was very similar to what had happened to Draco. Except for the outcome.
Should he say something about the voice he had heard that night? Probably not; she was freaked out enough as it was.
Draco laughed and then moaned. His body tightened around Harry’s fingers. Just imagining how that would feel around his cock, got him harder.
“I know what you’re doing,” Draco said. He opened his pants and reached inside to pull out his cock. It was smooth and pale except for the faint pink blush at the tip.
“Yeah, I want you to make love to me badly too, so maybe you should pull out your fingers and get your pretty cock inside me,” Draco said, reaching out to grab Harry by the neck and pulling him closer. They were breathing each other’s air and it was hot, everything about Draco was hot. The tight grip he had on Harry’s neck, the intensity and desire in his eyes, the way his body accepted Harry inside him. The way he liked to tell Harry how pretty his cock was, how good it tasted.
“I wonder,” Draco said, “How would have our lives been if you had been sorted into Slytherin.”
Draco kissed the tip again and then pulled Harry’s underwear down until his cock was fully exposed. This earned him a moan and a curse when he blew on the sensitive tip.
“I’m sorry,” Potter said.
“And what will they be able to do? I am Harry Potter. The Boy who lived. The one who defeated Voldmort.”
Harry had no real excuse for why he was here in the first place. Probably just curiosity. Malfoy manor stood there like a tomb. He could feel the magic coming from it. Humming just out of reach. The building seemed perfectly intact and structurally sound, but it also seemed like it wanted Harry gone. He didn’t think the building really had any feelings about him being here, but looking at it – well, it looked hostile.
Antoine smiled, showing a flash of his fangs. “Why ask questions you know the answers to? Why not ask the questions you don't know the answers to?”
“Potter is stalking the manor,” Draco said. He needed to talk with someone about it and Pansy would probably only roll her eyes at him and tell him to do some of the lovely filthy things with Potter he was constantly writing about.
“Stealth then...” And suddenly Harry knew what he had to do.
“That doesn’t mean I didn’t die that night,” Draco replied. He didn’t mean in any esoteric sense; that his soul had died, or his heart or something like that. He meant his body. He was pretty sure he died in that forest; and yet here he was.
Draco looked at her sharply. “Is he not going to remember who he used to be?“
Later when he was on his way home again, he realized that Draco had not answered the other important question. What was Draco doing for money these days? Harry shook his head, fondly. At least Draco had agreed to let Harry buy him dinner again.
“I can't even remember if I did it or if Draco did it, probably Draco, I don't think we had weapons there or cutlery for that matter.”
“Yes, possible,” Harry replied. “But if he did then it was a dangerous one.”
“Get naked, then you can suck me for a bit, and then I will fuck you, sound good to you?”
Draco nodded. “Yeah.”
“Yes, they did,” Harry agreed. He stepped forward and looked at the canvas again. “I’ve seen some of your other art. I mean, I saw it before I knew it was yours.”
Harry couldn’t quite tell if Malfoy was happy about it or not. He went back to his fish, which was probably excellent, but he didn’t really taste it and Malfoy went back into his head and ignored him for the rest of the meal.
His mirror-self winked at him. Neither he nor Potter had called it that – yet, but it was what was happening. After that first dinner it had kind of escalated. He was having a meal with Potter pretty much every other day now. There were little touches, too. Draco was well aware that Potter was coming on to him. He was kind of waiting for that famous stupid Gryffindor bravery to push Potter over the edge and kiss Draco one of these days.
“Don’t you feel bad for it? Now people will die for sure,” Antoine said. “There won’t be any vampires to heal them.”
The nasty part of him wanted to tell Blaise to fuck off, that he had no claim just because they used to fuck for a brief time, but the more rational part of him knew Blaise meant well, knew that he didn’t have many friends left and that he needed every single one of them. That they needed him too. He wasn’t the only pariah after all, even if he was the only one with the Dark Mark on his forearm.
Harry nodded, yes, he did know that. He was still of interest to the media. Every one of his last relationships had been in the fucking Prophet. Thank Merlin it hadn’t been that many.
“Did you hear from your old publisher?” Blaise asked.
“I am not stalking him and I don’t think he’s up to something evil,” Harry hurried to explain.
He grabbed Draco by the neck and kissed him hard. Draco let go of the door and pulled him into the bedroom.
One step forward, two steps back, Harry thought. Was it really worth all the trouble? He looked at Draco’s weary face, the way he held himself and decided that yes, it was worth all the trouble, Draco was worth it.
“This is it then,” Harry said three days later. Antoine's mysterious friend had checked out two of the more farfetched locations and they could strike those from their list. Last night it had been three locations, but by now it was only this one.
“Okay?”
“Well, I was under a lot of pressure,“ Draco snapped. He still had nightmares about his own house. About the things that he had to witness there. About the madman who had polluted everything he had loved once upon a time.
“Merlin, it doesn't matter that the victims were all Deatheaters or war criminals-”
“I might. I've never tried it before,” Potter said.
Harry nodded and handed over what they had been able to find. It was hard to reconstruct a spell from only the residue found on a person, but Hermione and Astra had tried their best.
“You – that is what you do for a living? Write pornography.”
“Then close your eyes, Harry and just feel,” Draco replied and proceeded to unzip Harry’s pants.
“It is sixth year all over again,” Ron moaned. They had just finished dinner and had settled down for drinks in the living room. Harry had started his tale about Draco as soon as Ron had poured them drinks and coffee.
“And you saw this coming a mile away,” Draco said.
~Four~
“Good, because I want that too, Draco,” Harry replied.
“They aren’t tracking it anymore now that I am working for the Ministry of Magic,” Draco said.
“Another one. I can smell-“ Draco’s voice was muffled and then broke. “Potter.”
“We are,” Draco replied. “Just out of curiosity how would you have dealt with it if I would have said yes?”
“All that blood, just there on display and you were willing,” Antoine explained, shrugging.
“It’s the saliva, the vampire’s saliva contains a small amount of aphrodisiac,” Antoine answered.
“I wasn’t, Draco,” Harry said, and kissed him again. This time it was passionate and bordering on claiming. Draco liked that very much, too.
“I think I might be a clue,” Harry said, looking at the painting. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from the bodies in the middle; they looked like a flower. “Is that an orgy?”
He crouched down beside Julien and looked him in the eyes. “I will sit here and look at you for the next fifteen minutes which will feel like an eternity to you and then I will go home and kiss Harry senseless and then I will tell the Aurors that you are here. So they can pick you up and throw your ass into Azkaban.”
“Ah?”
“Ah, but you will be there.”
“I wanted a reminder. It doesn’t seem to bother you,” Draco replied, which had been a surprise.
“Do what, Harry?”
Draco wasn’t the only one who had a grudge here, Harry thought. He was missing weeks of his life.
“Is this a question? Are you starting an interrogation?”
“Come on my chest,” Draco repeated in that tone that made Harry obey him. He pulled out, he was so fucking close it only took a few hard strokes for him to come all over Draco’s chest.
“I really don’t think you should thank me, Harry,” Astra replied. “He is not your friend, he was never your friend and –“
Draco could still feel the ghost of Harry’s kiss. For what it was worth Harry hadn’t been hesitant or intimidated about it. In fact Harry Potter was a good kisser. He had obviously had some practice.
“Did you?”
Luna had been right to recommend Belladonna to him.
And didn’t that sound like it could be fun, Harry thought.
“An opportunity to do what?“ Draco asked.
Draco sighed. “She’s seen the painting. She’s seen all the bloody paintings, Thompson.” Draco didn’t like Thompson, and that was mutual, too. He knew Thompson had been the one who had assigned Henri to him, because he no doubt thought Draco was gaga and Henri was useless. Now he was probably resentful that they had turned out to be such a good team.
“I wonder. Was I ever your enemy? I mean, I didn’t want to kill you,” Draco said. “He wanted you dead. You fought with me, but with him you fought for your life.”
Harry swallowed.
“And then it started on our side of the fence too,” Draco said.
“And?” Draco asked. He liked teasing these little things out of Harry. Liked knowing things about Harry probably not many people knew.
There was silence, it was so loud it was deafening and then Draco’s words, or well, word, caught up to him and he looked at Harry. His green eyes were wide and innocent awe and happiness was shining in them and yes, well, Draco had not intended to propose. Not like this and not yet anyway, somewhere down the line, sure, because Harry was it for him and they both knew it, but what the hell.
He looked to Hell for inspiration. She just cocked her head at him.
“Did you think about that one carefully?”
“Ah, well...” Draco replied. He hadn’t been shirtless in ages around people. He had a glamour on him at almost all times, but something was different now. Not his magic: that was still strong as ever. He could feel it in his veins, writhing and pulsing. Something was changing, nevertheless.
“Nearly five, the war was still very fresh for a lot of people. It still is for some,” Draco replied.
“So, is that what you’re doing? You’re working with him? Editing? Publishing? I heard that Blaise is founding a publishing house.” Harry wanted to know.
Draco kissed him gently. “What did you have in mind?”
Draco looked at him for a long while. “I always call you Potter.”
“Yes,” Harry replied.
“What in Merlin’s name are you saying? That my dead ancestors want me to father a child so this magic, this—" He looked down at his hands. “This thing inside me can be passed on?”
“No, and before you ask, no I don’t know what I was doing in that inn. As I don’t remember anything.”
They all nodded.
“We need to clean these wounds,” Harry said.
It was getting dark anyway. He didn’t like being inside the manor after it got dark. The gardens, the vast grounds where a whole other deal. They felt safe somehow.
“Potter, are you listening?” Draco asked.
“I have to admit, I was intrigued by your letter,” Blaise replied and motioned for Harry to follow him. The townhouse was huge. It reminded Harry of the period dramas he had sometimes snatched episodes of when he was a child. “It’s not like we have ever been friends, Potter. Or even friendly.”
“High-profile target,” Draco repeated.
“Mrs. Bellke was found dead just an hour ago. She’s been dead for some while,” Potter said. He was pacing the living room, to the fireplace and back to the door and back to the fireplace.
“Partly. We’ve been over this, Draco,” Harry said. Yes, he had been suspicious, but he had also been crushing on Draco, not that he had known that back then. Part of him had wanted to help him, and that part still wanted to.
“If that is the case,” Antoine said and got up, crossed over to where they were siting and bent down to kiss first Draco and then Harry, “I will take care of some of these things now.”
“I see you have some ideas and fantasies of your own,” Harry teased.
“Don’t even pretend, you are thinking about buying into it, aren’t you? Pansy too.”
“I didn’t. They came later,” Draco answered.
“Draco wasn’t a healer, he was a prisoner and slave,” Harry hissed.
“Tell me,” Potter said.
“Well, he’s certainly doing something in that tomb of a house,” Blaise sighed. “Ask away, I know now why you’re here, so ask and I shall answer.”
He had his own tiny place, away from all the demons and nightmares after all. He should return to it, he should return to his new book, should work on Ivar’s story.
“Aurors Bears and Potter are on the case you painted,” Thompson said.
“Fuck,” he whispered and then spit out blood. He should see someone for this, but he really didn’t feel up to answering questions right now.
“Should I be grateful then? Should I grovel at his feet?” Draco hissed.
“I think it’s perfect,” Harry answered. He had of course been the first to read the rough draft, but it hadn’t had a title two weeks ago. Titles really were the hardest part of writing, Draco thought. It was like naming a child. A fully grown child.
“Maybe,” she allowed. “Anyway, now we have bigger fish to fry. Minister Winters has formed a small taskforce now, and everyone associated with the Club is being questioned. The owners too. And the employees. Most of them came back clean. Just people like you and me, having fun and earning money,” she continued. “Two pinged Astra’s radar.”
Draco nodded again. He was really glad that at least Blaise was on his side in all this.
“Harry, we thought you maybe remembered parts of your life. I mean, it seemed like you remembered sometimes,” Neville said.
Harry smiled. “I don’t think so.”
“I really want to hug you right now,” Potter said, running a hand through his unruly hair.
“As a child I was sure that I was loved and as far as I can tell you never had that, so of course you’re going to doubt any kind of real deep affection and connection.”
“You are right, of course. Just saying,” Blaise replied.
“I’m not attacking you, or Draco or your relationship, Harry. But other people will. People who lost someone in the war.”
Harry kissed him gently. “Once we’re done, we will compare notes and then bring in anyone we think might help this investigation for questioning.”
Harry cut Ron off. “Just because I can’t remember most of my life before I woke up in that inn, doesn’t mean I’m vulnerable, Ron. I still have my wits and my magic. I hardly think I am more vulnerable now than I was when I first discovered I was a wizard at eleven.”
Harry nodded. “Besides, it's a secret facility, they can hardly go public with it and accuse me of – whatever. Besides I've been on the Ministry's naughty lit before.”
“What is this?” Joel asked.
“Lengths?” Harry asked.
“You,“ the voice said. “You are Harry.“
“I could tell you,” Draco said.
“Fuck, feels so good,” Draco groaned. He loved how honest Draco was during sex. It was like he left his protective shell outside the bedroom and let Harry see all of him. “A bit harder,” he added, and Harry obliged. He could tell that Draco was close and that was good, because Harry didn’t think he could keep himself from falling apart in the best way possible any longer.
neck. “You smell like one of us.”
“It’s a deal, Blaise,” Draco said.
“You were following my career?” Harry asked. He was still staring at the painting, not daring to look at Draco. The grisly details of the painting seemed safer than the storm in Draco Malfoy's eyes.
“Thank you.”
“You won’t like it,” Draco warned.
“We will do this right, Draco. The Slytherin way, but we will do it right.“
Draco was not having a good day. For one it was way too early to be up, or maybe way too late, for another, Ivar was a fucking difficult character to work with, but trying to work on anything else hadn’t done him any good, so Ivar it was.
“You don’t know that. I’m sure we would have found a way to get where we are now, somehow,” Draco said.
“I will need access to the Manor. If I could live here for a while it would make things easier.”
“You see what?” Harry asked, also getting a bit impatient with her vagueness.
“He marked me too,” Potter said and brushed his hair aside to show the scar. Draco had kissed it last night as he fucked Potter slowly.
“Were murdered,” Draco corrected. He thought that distinction was important. Why else would Potter be here? Protecting him? Or trying to?
“That’s a good thing, right?”
“Are you going to use this one for your books if I tell you all the glorious sordid details?“
“I know you as well as you know me, Draco. We were stupid, petty kids and there are ten years of us evolving from that. I don’t know you. I don’t think I ever knew you, Draco.”
Whatever it had been that had made them aware of each other all those years ago, it was stronger now. At least for Harry, because Merlin only knew what the hell was going on in Malfoy’s head.
Harry only knew what he was doing because Draco had so patiently taught him. Kissing and touching Draco had been easy, but Harry had been rather clueless when it came to anal sex and the books, while very hot and arousing, hadn’t been very helpful. He could have read up on it on sex education sites, most likely, but he found the idea of Draco teaching him how to make him feel good, a million times more appealing and arousing.
~Three~
“Do you remember us?” Draco asked.
“Yes,” Harry answered without any hesitation, just confirming what Draco had been thinking for days. They were dating. This whole thing with Harry was getting real.
“What?”
“Should I sit down for this?” Harry asked. Something in his voice made Draco look at him.
“You like to forget that you didn't have a say in this whole thing. They brought you to Draco and they made him heal you, you were unconscious for it all.”
“Something fun and something easy. Something my mother taught me when I was accepted into Hogwarts,” Draco replied. There was a fond smile playing around his lips and Harry liked it. Liked seeing Draco happy. Liked how his thin pale lips looked.
Potter stepped closer, reached out to touch Draco’s shirt. “No, I’m not alien here.”
“Never. I used to think it was a character flaw, and I was sure you had many.”
“Sadly, yes.” Antoine replied. Suddenly he was standing directly in front of Harry. He was so close Harry could feel his body heat, if he shifted a little bit his knee would touch Antoine's leg. He clenched his fingers to fists at his side and looked up into Antoine's pretty face. “I will be back tomorrow night. Don't do anything stupid.”
“Meant to be?” Draco dared to ask, because he was feeling it too. That thing, that invisible threat that was drawing him to Potter and that was drawing Potter to him as well.
“No, I’m not,” Draco said.
When you were an Auror for so long you got in touch with all kinds of people, some of them owed you favors, the kind you don't ask questions about. Harry was cashing in on those favors now.
“You should get some sleep now.”
This time it was Harry who kissed him. “Gladly.”
“Stupid schoolboys and later well, on different sites of a war neither of us wanted to be part of.”
He bit his lip, and waved his hand and the scar on the right side appeared again, running up from his collar bone, carving through the skin up along his jaw and up to his eye. There was another one, Harry realized, a smaller on that formed a sort of crescent moon on the top left of his forehead.
“I know I...I’m trying Ginny.”
“Well, he was thinking it anyway. Kept looking up here.”
“I’m not hurt, I told you just a little sore I just....” Draco sighed, “I’m not used to....kindness.” He winced at his words. Even to him, that sounded a tad dramatic even if it was true.
After multiple rounds of explaining the instructions, everyone was ready to play. The drinking rules were simple, shot before, shot if you got out, and if you were already out, a sip every time someone else got out.
A silence. Draco felt the grin spread on his face.
. Draco thought just five minutes later. He was sat in one of the arm chairs, subconsciously ripping at the skin around his nails as was his nervous habit, with just about everyone he hoped to never see again surrounding him. Granger and Weasley were squashed together on an arm chair,
As soon as the door shut, Draco let out a breath. It felt like he aged at least five years. Harry even seem more relieved now, collapsing over Draco, nuzzling back to where he used to be. Draco immediately wrapped his arms around him, pulling Harry’s face up so Draco could press his lips to his.
, Draco shook his head, stopping his mushy thoughts. And in front of Weasel too. Weasel who was very set on telling Harry about his amazing pass at try outs today. “It was halfway decent” Draco added in, savoring the look of shock on both Weasel’s and Potter’s faces.
“Younger. Fifth or something. I don’t remember.”
. Harry scolded himself, they were literally in front of the entire school. In front of his ex. In front of...Draco’s assailants. Harry bit his tongue, a fresh wave of anger washed over him but it was soon contrasted with warm affection for his boyfriend, watching him strut through the Great Hall like most of the people there didn’t despise him.
Harry thought,
“I’m not...I’m not suggesting that that lessens the grief in anyway, Harry I just...I realize I don’t know a lot about you.”
Harry nodded, gently wiping the tears from his face, listening intently.
“I haven’t been able to kiss you until today.”
In response, Harry kissed the tip, smirking up at him.
All Draco wanted was a cup of tea and to left alone for their first night in. Well, certainly not
Harry then opened his mouth to say something, but whatever he was going to say was drowned out by the feeling of cold liquid on Draco’s back. Draco whirled around and saw Barren, looking down at his spilt cup of pumpkin juice with a obviously put on act of remorse.
Draco will never know.
“It’s actually Harry’s invite.”
“Welcome back everyone, welcome
Their next class differed, Harry had advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts (even if he thought it was a bit silly he had to take it). Draco, banned from anything to do with the Dark Arts, had advanced Muggle Studies. Draco shuddered at the thought.
But Potter,
Draco thought dejectedly, turning and climbing back up as quietly as possible. He had just sat back down, wrapping the blanket around him when he heard footsteps. Immediately, Draco stood up, hand drawn. It was really an instinct at this point, as an ex-death eater.
Harry groaned at the contact, rolling his hips forward into Draco’s. When Draco rolled his back, Harry growled into Draco’s mouth, putting a hand between Draco’s head and the door before kissing him harder than before.
“You called me your boyfriend. You’ve never done that” Harry explained, eyes trailing from Draco’s eyes down to his lips and back up again, just in time to see Draco roll his eyes.
Life, it seemed, had other plans. Or specifically, Luna Lovegood did. There was a knock on the door, which Draco ignored, followed by three more. By the third one, Draco had pulled his wand out, ready for whoever was waiting to edge on the ex-Death Eater.
Eventually, Draco pulled back, not going far, partially because Harry wouldn’t let him. “I don’t...thank you for telling me this Draco I...I can’t imagine this is easy or comfortable but I’m...I want to help you.”
“I don’t need the Saviour” Draco growled and Harry tugged him back in, “no, no that’s not what I meant but Draco I...if you want to jump I..well I’m not going to let you.”
“No, no I get the...scars, but why the mark?”
humiliating.
“That I’m a hypocrite.”
The door rattled in the most arousing way possible as Harry slammed himself into Draco. He was so
“FFFUUUCK IIT!!! FUCKITFUCKITFUCKITTT!” They both yelled, launching their voices from their bodies and sent them ricocheting through the vast expanse. Draco screamed and screamed, all self-consciousness gone, the heat of Harry’s hand grounding him.
Harry had one hand cupping Draco’s face, the other winding around Draco’s waist as he pulled the blonde closer. Draco went willingly, all his consciousness focused at the points where Harry was touching him.
Draco shook his head, smiling sadly, “no one wants me there. I’ll just ruin your fun. Thanks for the invite though.”
Once Harry had gone, Draco slammed his head into his hands.
“It’s half-past five, Harry. Quidditch ended two hours ago.”
What Harry didn’t account for was Draco. Well, he
Harry moaned dramatically, biting lightly at Draco’s shoulder. “Will you sit near me during the feast?”
Draco moaned, eyes closed. Harry ground up into him hard, “again, again pleaseHarry
. He could feel himself start to go a bit mad, a little bit madder than when he started this because suddenly his pants felt way too tight.
ended, Draco bolted directly to their room. What he had in mind required precision. Quickly, Draco entered their room, Harry absent thankfully and reached into Harry’s pillow case. Out of it he pulled what was possibly the most hideous cloak in existence. It was also possibly the stupidest hiding place
There was heat and want but more, underneath that, was a strong sense of...support. It sounded odd to Draco when the thought passed through his mind, but the intensity which they kissed, it was almost like they were pulled to the other. After a moment, Draco pulled back for air and was met with intense green eyes looking into his. He smiled, a small one, at the sincerity in the other boy’s eyes and was met by a full grin.
. ‘No, oh no oh nonononono’ Harry panics internally, watching pools of crimson blood well up out of Malfoy’s stark white shirt that covers his twitching body.
“I don’t think he is” Granger responded sadly. “He left the feast early, and I know his...”
. Draco glowered, looking away right as Ginny reached up, kissing Potter...disgustingly frankly. Potter pulled back, as far as he could get with the she-weasel on-top of him. “Hi” was all he said, pointedly looking down.
“Here boy”, Blaise called smugly and Ron begrudgingly crawled over to him, glaring at Dean and Seamus.
“I do” he hissed back, stomping on Harry’s foot lightly. They had reached the common room door, luckily left ajar by some drunken idiot, Draco guessed it was Seamus or Dean. Not open enough, but open enough to pry open which Draco did with surgical precision. Slowly creeping in, Draco saw that only Pansy, Weasel, and Granger were left. Strange group.
“And you’re invited”
, he decided as he stood in the mirror to adjust the final details. He wore form fitting, sleek black trousers that were tailored to a tee. They did wonderful things to his ass, truly. For a shirt, Draco wore a black button down shirt, but it was slightly sheer and more form fitting than his usual shirt choice. The slight sheerness made it reflect the light just so. He had rolled the sleeves up to his elbow for Draco had always found the three-quarter rolled up sleeve irresistible on men. And probably women too if Draco was straight in anyway. He picked a velvety black vest that fit perfectly with the shirt. The shirt’s top two buttons were undone so his pale chest shone through a bit, highlighting the sleek black ribbon choker that accented his neck. He ran his ringed fingers over the fabric in satisfaction.
Draco shrugged, “I’ll tell you later.” He whispered a cleaning spell, ridding both of them of stickiness. Harry pressed another yet another kiss against Draco’s lips, “thank you for giving us a chance.”
“Ginny’s in there. Well, cause you know she’s in Gryffindor but also because- anyway, are you gonna be okay?”
Draco, meanwhile, had forgone breakfast as it was his mission to avoid the dining hall, at least at popular hours, to try and make his life a bit easier. With the new ‘eighth year house’ came a new Quidditch team. The 8
“They can all bugger off then, can’t they?” Harry replied, far more casual than the conversation warranted.
“Fuck it?”
Truthfully, Harry couldn’t take Draco asking for the second morning in a row about whether this was a mistake. It had been painful to convince the blonde to give them a try already. And with some people already set against them, it seemed unfair that Harry should have to fight Draco too.
“They think I’m going to try and poison you in your sleep or something.” Draco explained, trying to dismiss it. Trying to make it sound like a joke because he so desperately wished it was. It would be so much easier to laugh than to face the reality that on his first day back, just as he feared, no one would accept him.
Draco smirked, working his palm over Harry, enjoying the rush of power it gave him in making the Golden One feel good, be so responsive to his hand.
Harry blushed and but didn’t look away, “let me help you.”
to be inside Draco, the desire to bury himself over and over. Draco’s head pushed back into the door, his eyes shut tight as he was pounded into over and over again. “I love you” Draco gasped, his hands gripping into Harry’s hair.
Harry rolled his eyes, “stuff it, Draco.”
Draco closed his eyes, warm in Harry’s embrace. That was the second time Harry had called him ‘love’.
“Right, right uh...I’m gonna have a shower.” Draco muttered, feeling so guilty and so annoyed at himself. Draco just felt too naked, literally and metaphorically.
Everyone had a reaction to that, Draco’s eyes flew to his dorm door. He could escape...but then his eyes landed on Harry. And the selfish, drunk part of him needed to any information Harry may volunteer during this game.
The last time he had seen Draco was at the trials over the summer when Harry had stood up in front of the entire Wizard community, newly the savior of the Wizarding world, and said that Draco Malfoy was not a bad man, that he had saved Harry’s life. Everyone was shocked, Harry too was a bit shocked at how aggressively he cared whether Draco got sentenced or not. Of course, if the Harry Potter says someone’s innocent, even a Malfoy, they listened. Draco looked him in the eyes, just once, before the judge had proclaimed the sentence, and Harry saw...well he wasn’t sure what he saw to be honest.
Blood.
“Stop what?” Draco whispered back.
There was a stillness for a moment, Draco again scanning Potter for any and all honesty. “Why are you bringing this up now?”
Harry had just stood up, Draco just barely managing to cover up his collar bone, when the door opened. Granger stepped in, looking like she temporarily forgot who Harry’s roommate was, but recovered quickly.
“Thanks Hermione, that means a lot” Potter joked, raising his cup as they all took a drink.
“That’s not- listen, I agreed to give this another go-“
Draco I just...”
“I was trying to be your friend.” Draco pointed out, feeling oddly defensive. He immediately felt Harry’s hands run up and down his waist.
. He was kissing
Draco was about to mutter something about torture when he heard Harry mutter something else and Draco felt the inside of him magiced clean. Oh
“I’m-“ Harry began only to be cut off by “if you say I’m sorry I’ll pitch you off the tower” snapped Draco, hating how tight his voice was becoming. “I am” Harry whispered, taking Draco’s hand and gently rubbing small circles into it with his palm. Draco was over come with this...disgusting guilt because he wanted to badly to be comforted torn by the knowledge that he deserved these scars.
Harry grinned cheekily, his hips rocking lightly up to meet Draco’s decided still ones. “He wasn’t going to enter....you look good up there you know.”
Well, it was now or never. Draco delicately placed a finger on Harry’s lips, determined to keep his eyes locked with Harry, as he ran his other hand down Harry’s chest and palmed him brashly through his trousers.
agreed to date said crush. Blood Potter. He wasn’t prepared for this. At least brooding heart break was predictable.
knew about. That was just his.
“Yeah, well we’ve only been dating less than twelve hours.”
Draco snatched his wrist away from Harry, automatically defensive of the scar riddled mark. The scars on the mark were immediately hidden under a glamor. “I should think it obvious why.”
years to have their own bathrooms.” Which was true, but he kept a watchful eye on Draco who smiled half heartedly. Okay, casual was not the way to go.
Right in the middle of their longest stare-off yet, the door burst open and little Weasel and Luna burst in.
It made Draco feel like a goddamn doll. He sat up, using his hands to pull Harry down so he was leaning over him before Draco kissed him,
“What?” Prompted Pansy, leaning forward.
. Thought Draco, taking another healthy sip.
“Please” Draco whispered, fingers gripping his arm painfully strong. Harry shut up, returning to rubbing small circles into the small of Draco’s back.
Everything was more sensitive. With each thrust down, Draco felt himself grow needier. He ground himself down onto Harry, the sensation of being full, being fucked addictive. Draco was breathing heavily, moving in time with Harry and he felt each thrust up radiate up into his whole body.
, Potter. You’ve saved the world, Potter, I think you can live without saving me.”
It was a short walk, thank
“Did I say you need saving?” Harry challenged, taking a step forward causing Draco’s eyes to widen.
“No marks” Draco sighed.
Immediately, Harry’s hand curled into a fist, ready to step in if this fucker tried anything. But instead of hurting, Tom (?) just looking Draco up and down and smiled.
“You’re so beautiful” Harry whispered, leaning down to kiss Draco again. Draco melted, wrapping his arms around Harry to hold him close because even if he thought Harry was being delusional and he was horrible at accepting love and affection, this feeling of stillness, of peace of
Draco rolled his hips, just a little, just a little to make Harry, and himself because
“We’re technically on a break and she wants me to give us another chance but...”
When Draco finally broke out of his thoughts, he saw Harry leaning unsure against the shower door. “Oh uh yeah. If you want.” Draco murmured and Harry hated how unsure he sounded.
made him harder than he had probably been ever in his entire life. He couldn’t see outside the cloak, and it took
Potter rolled his eyes fondly, dismounting his broom. “You had quite the head start.”
Taking advantage of Harry’s momentary distraction, Draco moved his lips to Harry’s dark skinned neck, aiming for the spot just below his jaw, and bit, working hard to leave Harry a lasting mark there because apparently he was feeling possessive of someone he had not right to be.
There was barely any rhythm to Harry’s thrusting, only the
“Hey, Gin” He replied, his eyes scanning her face for signs of anger. But he found none, and instead saw his one of his oldest friends, exhausted.
“Too long!” Proclaimed Dean, standing up excitedly. “You know what that means.”
“Who says I’m planning anything?”
Draco nodded, feeling his heart ache at how choked up Harry had become. “But think of how many you did save.”
“Well, 8
“Please, like they have anything to do but gossip.”
Draco had to walk around Hogwarts, filled with mostly people who hated him. As Draco was carefully applying the glamor’s, even doing the ones on his chest just incase, Harry came up behind him, hugging him. Draco melted into the touch, finding it stabilizing as the imperfections were spelled away.
“Oh” was all he could manage, taking out his wand to flick the bottle lying on the floor. Draco watched it spin around, not sure if he wanted it to land on Potter or on literally anyone else.
“Not yet” Harry countered, biting down on Draco’s collar bone for good measure. When there was a knock on the door for the
“Don’t be a prat” Draco moaned, reaching down to stroke himself to completion if the brunette idiot wouldn’t do it himself. But Harry caught Draco’s wrist, pressing a kiss to the inside of it before pushing it away.
“We need to lift that damn curse as soon as possible,” Harry said and then leaned down so he could press his tongue against that barrier and run it up and down Draco’s cock.
“She’s still at Hogwarts,” Harry replied.
“Was the pleasure spell used on the one you have in custody?” Draco wanted to know.
“Fuck,” Harry hissed. It wasn’t exactly painful or uncomfortable in fact it seemed his cock liked it very much.
Harry smiled at him like he could read Draco’s thoughts, but didn’t comment and went to the coffee maker instead to pour himself a cup.
“You look good, Auror Potter.”
“But you can roam the whole place and the pleasure gardens outside?” Astra said, it wasn’t really a question.
“That’s very precise Auror Potter,” Draco replied.
“You like it when I’m mean,” Draco said, but he was smiling and that was something Harry hadn’t seen in a long while.
She handed a photo to Draco and then Harry, but Draco couldn’t remember her.
He looked into Draco’s eyes and there it was again, this strange sense of déjà vu. He had seen Potter’s eyes before, but it wasn’t that; it was the forest.
“Don’t worry, you’ll like it, I promise,” Draco said and did it again and then his tongue was right there too. Harry grabbed fistfuls of the sheets as Draco licked his hole and then pushed his tongue inside. It felt amazing and when Draco added a slick finger to the mix, Harry thought he might come right away.
“Look at this, isn’t it fabulous?” Blaise said and stopped in front of a window display.
“That is a very long list,” Harry replied.
“Speak for yourself, Potter,” Draco replied.
“He will find out from the Prophet otherwise,” Harry said. “How is that list going?”
“Our place?” Harry asked.
Malfoy looked at him sharply. “Yes, you were, and I was jealous and angry.”
“You're going out to eat?”
“Will you let me finish a sentence?” Potter asked, exasperated.
“You are so very proper, Malfoy. I mean, don’t you ever relax? Not even in your own home?”
“Anyway, I was a little prick at the age of eleven, but it still hurt that you told me no when I offered my friendship to you. And I really don’t get why you wanted me to teach you, why I was the only familiar thing to you when you lost your memories, Harry.”
Draco really didn't know what to do with that, so he stepped aside. “This will be your room for the time being. Dinner is served at six. We will figure out everything else as we go.”
“Useful,“ Draco echoed and knew that Blaise was right. The school had taken them back, but it was pretty clear that their house wasn’t looked upon favorably and that pretty much everyone else wanted them gone. Life would not be easy for anyone who had been in Slytherin before the war.
Draco had half a mind to protest, but then just nodded. A bit of fresh air would do him a world of good.
“Nothing happened to my face,” Draco replied.
“Funny?”
“Maybe? I wouldn’t want to know too many details,” Harry admitted. “I could offer him money.”
Draco gave him a look. “I hope you are prepared for the media circus and backlash once our – affair,” Draco settled on, “is made public.”
That was unfortunately true. On both accounts. He had doodled Mr. Starlord, Pansy’s evil cat who he fucking hated. Mr. Starlord had let him know on more than one occasion that the feeling was mutual.
“Which of those means more, I wonder?” she mused.
“Your kind of magic is really, really handy, Draco,” Harry said, and he was naked now like Draco, their clothes folded upstairs in the bedroom. Draco put the lube in Harry’s hand and turned around to face the wallpaper. He braced himself against the wall and waited.
Harry shook his head. “Thank you.”
“So, what is the plan?” Harry said.
“The other one, Potter,” Draco demanded.
“I have to concentrate; you can take matters in your own hands. I am sure you’ve done it before, Potter,” Draco said.
Draco smiled. “Then we will.”
Ivan smiled, it was more like a smirk, really. “Yes, with lunch, because you’re intending to have it at Mr. Malfoy’s place.”
“Will you be alright?”
“And have so much fun trying it all out too,” Draco said.
That night Draco slept in the studio. He always said that he was just a medium when the visions came over him, but that wasn’t quite true. He could feel and smell things, almost like dreaming, but not. It was hard to explain, so he wasn’t trying anymore. It wasn’t like anyone would know how it felt.
He grabbed lunch and coffee at a nearby place and then called Luna. He had always assumed that she was the only one with a phone in that house, but now he wasn’t so sure, because Draco had to deal with Muggles somehow to be able to exhibit and sell his paintings.
Wednesday had the least people inside.
“Draco,” Harry said and it was so tender, Draco’s heart was going to explode. He glared at the wall and said nothing. The sudden silence was unbearable.
Draco nodded. “Yes, I read it. Didn’t ever take you for a big reader.”
Predictably, Potter had started a very successful career as an Auror and then had married Ginny Weasly, which had not worked out for them. Last Draco heard—and he tried not to care about Potter and his affairs at all—was that they had split up with no fuss five years ago. Since then, Harry Potter had been single as far as the public was concerned. Married to his work, they said.
“Look,” he said, “I think I am in love with you-“
Astra laughed. “Yes. You do. Anyway, you know how to reach us if shit should go down here. Malcier and Lerch are on the Goyles now. Zabini isn’t even in the country right now, but we try to contact him.”
He had half a mind to finish his document, but then abandoned it, it would keep. Somehow it was more important to eat lunch with Potter. Make some conversation maybe. Ask about how the case was going in general. Potter was cagey with information regarding the case and the other targets. Maybe that was a good thing, but Draco didn’t like to be kept in the dark or feeling powerless. He had enough of that when he had been younger.
“Harry-“
“Before you-“
“It’s because the boy who lived fancies you, Draco,” Blaise said.
“There might also be a chance that it’s only me,” Draco said.
“You want to befriend Potter.“
“Wishing you would have done things differently?”
Harry just lay on the bed staring up at the canopy full of twinkling stars while Draco was smearing kisses into his skin.
“Yes,” Harry answered, his voice sounded breathy to his own ears.
“How many intruders?”
Years later it still gave him strength and determination to get things done.
“Good night, Harry,” Antoine said and then was out of the room, the cottage, and gone.
“Draco-“ Potter tried again.
“I will provide security. Before you start, Draco. It’s so I feel better. I want you to be safe and I don’t want you to hex anyone. I don’t want anyone to get hurt, especially not you, okay?” Harry said.
“How do you figure?”
“Fair enough,” Blaise said. “I still have to warn you. If you hurt him I will end you and I don’t care that you are the hero of the Wizarding world, you understand me?”
Draco laughed. “I remember you too. And I bet I remember a whole lot more than you do Potter,” he sighed and looked at Antoine. “And you.”
Potter had only one suitcase, but that was more than enough. Draco could sense the magic on Potter's suitcase after all. There were probably a million things inside it.
“Have you been planning this?” Draco asked against his throat.
“What is your plan then?” Draco asked. “Because until now it seems like we’ve been only sitting around while people I call or called my friends were being murdered.”
“Oh, hell,” Harry said.
“I’ll let you have that one, but tonight you’re mine, Potter,” Draco said.
“I’m not worried, as long as Auror Potter is guarding me,” Draco told her. And he wasn’t. Harry had an excellent track record when it came to saving Draco’s life after all.
“Let’s get this over with, shall we? Henri, you can go right up; the wards will let you through. You can look at it in peace while I deal with these gentlemen here," Draco said.
“I still made choices,” Draco said, because he had. He had weighed everything and decided that his life and the lives of the people he loved were worth more than others. And he was pretty sure he would make the same choices again.
He rubbed the bridge of his nose. What the hell had he been thinking? He shook his head. He should go home.
“We’ve been over this,” Draco replied.
“People don’t usually smile about nothing, Draco,” Potter said and pushed the plate with pastries in Draco’s direction. At times Draco felt like Harry wanted to fatten him up.
“Sure, I mean, I am breaking so many rules right now, what is one more, right? Besides the fucking Prophet ran it as well. I’ll Floo Astra after breakfast,” he said.
“I dreamed about this, I didn’t know it was this, but about you. You crying and blood, so much blood.” He cupped Draco’s face. “It was bad, wasn’t it? You nearly died.”
“Even the broom closet?” Harry asked.
“Are you insane? Do I look like a fucking damsel in distress to you? I don’t need Harry to save me.”
“I would have declined, because I like to have my own money and be independent and you’re too young to be my sugar daddy.”
“And despite everything, despite seven years of rivalry, despite being on opposite sides of a war, here we are,” Harry said.
Draco nodded and finally looked at him. “I did, he told me to figure it out and I figured it out. You don’t remember him, but he was terrifying. I think the only person who didn’t fear him was my aunt Bellatrix, but she could hardly be described as sane.”
Harry wanted to tell him  that it was their past, but really, he had broken a lot of rules, had gotten in a lot of unsavory situations as a kid and then a teenager, but he came out the hero, while Malfoy had – not.
Draco didn’t like it. He wanted to solve this problem on his own, well with the help of his friends, but still.
“Yes,” Harry said, because he and Bears had indeed come to that conclusion, once Harry had told Bears about what happened to Draco.
“Some of them weren’t even at Hogwarts when we defeated Voldemort,” Harry said.
“I’m not sure I made this clear when I asked, but this is a date, Draco. I asked you out.”
Draco nodded, because there was really nothing else to add to that. He had wanted to see if he could make it on his own. And it seemed that yes, he could. Of course, he had been without an agent back then and had no real idea how to get a book published and he had known that he would not be able to publish it under his own name either. He had lied and he had mislead and he had gotten his book out there. Of course, he hadn’t gotten paid nearly enough for it. He had learned from it though. He had gotten more money for the second and third books. Now he was, well Belladonna was, a well-known name. Even if he still wasn’t rich. Probably never would be as well off as his family had been before the war.
Harry had known before they left the office three days ago that he was in the painting because his superior had shown him a picture of it. Thompson, of course, hadn’t said a word about the Seer being Draco Malfoy. Thompson was an arse like that sometimes.
Ron and Hermione exchanged another one of those looks. She put her hand on Harry’s. “Just remember that whatever happens we will be here for you.”
“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” Draco asked him over his shoulder and Antoine was at Draco’s back in a matter of seconds. Harry had been right: he looked hungry.
“There are spells for that,” Draco said and grabbed his wand. He cast one on his palm and one on Harry’s; they would have matching scars now. “You bound yourself to my home.”
“Thank Merlin,” Draco said and Harry laughed.
“Today?” Harry asked.
“That little weasel,” he hissed. There was no way in hell he would let this man blackmail him.
“Oh, before I forget,” she said and grabbed something from her bag. “Ron sends his love via his mom’s baking.”
“You—" Potter shook his head. “I’m touching you now, so obviously you’re not dead.”
He had, because he liked Potter and because it was flattering to be liked by Potter. To be wanted the way Potter obviously wanted him.
Blaise gave him a pointed look. “I don’t know Draco, why would anyone of use want to do something like this?”
Antoine smiled back.
He was very aware that this was a weakness.
“Draco,” Harry interrupted. “Did I do this?”
“Yes, I think we should,” Blaise replied.
“Buy him dinner,” Blaise said.
There was a long silence on the other end of the line, but she hadn’t hung up on him. “I know you want to ask him questions, but he won’t answer them, Harry.”
“They should be glad instead,” Harry said. “They can’t fail if they have no one to guard.”
“It’s not about remembering at this point, Mr. Malfoy. He just has to learn to live in this world.“
“It might turn out alright. I mean, you’re already better off than you were when you first came back to England, Draco. You have the manor back, you have some money saved up, you have Potter, you have us on your side. You will come out of this alright, no matter what,” Pansy said.
“The Aurors better step their game up, Potter, because the public knowing that this maniac now marks kids as well is not going to go over well.”
“Ron is right. Malfoy is…well, we don’t know what he does for a living or where he lives or what he has been up to the last ten years, but if it had been anything shady, the authorities would have done something about it,” Hermione said. “You don’t have to do this anymore.”
“I will be, Astra, I promise,” he said and walked her out of the small library. Draco was in the hall, leaning against the banister. Harry wanted to eat him up, kiss that slight smirk of his face and get naked.
Draco reached out and Harry grabbed his hand, he squeezed hard, watching the blue veins under that pale skin. “Like a winter landscape,” he whispered and Draco laughed and then moaned, because Antoine had picked up the pace.
“I have one,” Harry said.
“I-“ he had no idea, he had always wanted to be an Auror and now he couldn’t be one anymore. He knew that most Aurors did a great job and kept people save, but now that he knew there was a darker side to the new Ministry of Magic, he could not work for them anymore. In fact the last few weeks had shown he was very capable of working against them.
He hadn’t told Harry about this part. He hadn’t known about this part until this morning when he had finished Vision No.35. It would hurt like hell, he knew, but once it was done, he would be able to go home and see Harry, to touch him and kiss him and feel only excitement and joy.
“And is it a forever happily ever after?”
“So you were in control to some degree?” Harry asked despite himself. Now that they were talking about it, he wanted to know more. He wanted to know more about Draco’s past.
He groaned and rubbed his temples. “I’m so fucked,” he whispered. He needed to get laid to get it all out of his system, but as he was a prisoner in his own house, there was no way he could go out and pick someone up, or go to the Club and have his pick. He blinked. He could invite someone here. From the Club. A professional. Potter would probably have a fit, but Draco was willing to risk it because he was going insane.
“Goyle has a kid for Merlin’s sake,” Harry said.
“I needed to not be home, and your sofa is very comfortable,“ Blaise replied and then nodded his thanks when Draco handed him a mug of hot tea. The sofa was partly so comfortable because he knew that Blaise would be using it, but neither he nor Blaise acknowledged that fact.
“You’ve been stalking me,” Harry said teasingly.
“Tell him,” Harry answered. He had no idea how he would tell Draco that they had failed and that his childhood friend was dead, but he would do it somehow.
“Watching people eat? Feeding people for that matter?”
Neville leaned back in his armchair. “He stood trial, he paid for the things he did, more than I think he should have. The Ministry had clearly made an example of the Malfoys. Granted I hadn’t thought that at the age of eighteen, but I am wiser now. He was punished enough. I chose to look forward and leave the past behind. I want a better future for me and the students in my care and I don’t think being petty and vindictive will help me with that goal.”
“I don’t know. Objectively speaking, I am in a position of power.”
“Bed,” Draco managed.
“And you never told anyone about it?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded, he was pretty sure there were other reasons, but Draco wasn’t ready or willing to disclose them just yet and Harry wasn’t going to insist Draco tell him. Curiosity was good, he decided. It was a start. A good start even.
“What?! I thought Blaise already left the country weeks ago?” Harry asked.
“He’s alienated all his friends,” Draco hissed.
Potter took a breath. It was a good thing there was a warming charm on their food, because neither of them had touched it yet.
“Be assured that we do everything to find him. Auror Malcier is working with Granger. He had been cleared of everything. And he is pissed off that his partner sold him out.”
The place was nearly empty, which suited Harry and Antoine just fine. Antoine cradled his mug but didn’t actually drink the coffee.
“If I knew how to deal with it, without killing that prick, that is, I wouldn’t have asked you two for help,” Draco said.
“I’m afraid I’m not as pretty as I used to be,” Draco replied, making no move to take off his clothes. He told Harry to get closer to the barrier, putting his hand right over Harry’s chest and sliding it down. Harry couldn’t feel the pressure, but he could feel the heat, and he could see Draco’s eyes focused on his face. It made him feel hot in his skin. He was getting harder by the second.
“You're a vampire then?”
“And you will lay their kingdom to waste,” a voice said right into Harry's ear. He hadn't heard anyone approach him, which was no wonder as he was in a packed club. He turned slowly. The man, more of a boy, or that place in between, Harry thought, smiled at him.
“You were frowning really hard,” Antoine said.
“He made sure everyone knew that they were guilty to some extend as well,” Harry replied.
Draco nodded. “Go on.”
“Keep us updated, Astra,” Harry said.
“And there is another curse that will render you helpless for a few seconds, Draco, and a few seconds is often enough. You know that.”
“I’m sure Henri will find something, but Aurors Bears and Potter can also go up and look at it. Maybe they’ll see something useful,” Draco said and told his wards to let Bears and Potter into his studio.
“You don’t know?“
Granger looked pissed off. “Slipped right under our radar. He’s very good at his job. He was only fourteen when Harry defeated Voldemort, but his sister was a sixth year Hufflepuff. She was tortured by Goyle and others. She killed herself just two years ago.”
there?”
“It wasn’t Joel’s voice. I would have recognized his voice. Besides, why would he have let me live?”
“You were a kid. We were all kids.”
“I’m flattered, really, but your timing sucks,” Draco replied. “And if it weren’t for this, I would let you fuck me on that daybed over there.”
Harry nodded. “Good. I mean took the higher ups long enough to take this thing seriously.”
Henri finished another biscuit. “Our main suspect is Joel Pelletier.”
“Yes,” Harry admitted without any hesitation.
Draco pulled back and looked at Harry and Harry realized that Draco was still wearing all his clothes, only his pants were open, and his cock was out. It was hard and glistening and flushed a lush pink. “You’re not naked.”
“I love you,” Draco said because sometimes he just had to tell Harry and because Harry always went all soft and glowing when Draco said those words.
“We should clean up,” Draco said and Potter made a noise that could have mean anything. “And go to bed,” Draco added.
“Yes, I know it.”
Draco nodded. “Thank you.”
“Yes, you and Blaise, hell even Pansy,” Harry said.
Potter smiled. “But I think you and me, we were somehow –“
“Oh? So you recognize it?”
Draco shook his head. “Funnily enough, no one ever asked about Joel.”
“What else should I spend my money on?” Draco asked.
“I don’t think a publisher would give me the time of day, Potter. Me being a war-criminal and all,” Draco replied, coldly.
“Pardoned war criminal,” Blaise corrected before Draco could and he was grateful for that. It might be a small distinction, but it was important to Draco. He usually didn’t put that distinction out there when he was talking about himself, but he liked that his friends corrected people.
“And it’s fine, I mean, I guess with our history it’s a miracle we are friends now and you let me hold your hand in public and I didn’t even ask if you liked boys and girls like me, I just assumed because-“
Fuck, Draco thought, she was right, he wanted to have sex with Potter. And Potter showing up at his gate, begging to be let in, was only making it harder to resist.
“Probably, at some point, Potter.”
“If you want to tell me more righteous lies, then just don’t speak at all, Potter,” Malfoy interrupted him.
“Stand guard while you fuck someone in the small library.”
“He’s reading my books,” Draco said.
“Anybody, or just me?” Harry asked.
Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I think he could be the key to our case, Ivan.”
“Look out for everyone, uncover dark plots, and all that stuff,” Ron cut in and Hermione nodded.
“Not really, but I know what I’ve painted, and some of it was in the papers,” Draco replied shrugging.
Maybe he should just talk to Blaise Zabini.
“Strangely enough,” Draco said in nearly a whisper, and it sounded like he was right there beside Harry, right there whispering into his ear. “I am not sorry you did it.” He scooted even closer and his cock pressed against Harry’s. He could feel it hot against his own flesh.
Harry believed him, but it didn’t change how he felt.
“You or what we did, or us,” Harry said.
Potter looked at his face then. “You think if the ritual is completed, all this will disappear?” He waved his hand vaguely at Draco’s naked body.
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco said and waved his hand. The air between them shimmered and the room was suddenly split between where Harry was sitting and where Draco was, on the other side of a barrier. He scooted closer and touched it; it was solid. He couldn't see it, but he could feel it.
“This, my face, and hands are pretty much the only pieces of me that are not covered in scars...” he said, trailing his fingers over the pale silvery line on his throat. “This one you gave me.”
He needed sleep, a shower, food, some tea. Not necessarily in that order either. He also needed to get in touch with his current publisher and tell him that he would not be publishing his new book with his company.
“Harry,” Draco corrected without really thinking about it.
He hated it when someone forced his hand like that, when someone was holding something over his head and thought it gave them power. He had had enough of that when he had been sixteen. He was done being used by lesser men.
“Did anyone try to contact you after?” Harry asked, now fully in Auror mode. This was a mystery and Harry had always like mysteries. He was good at solving them, too.
“Yes,” Harry admitted. He was staring. Draco was gorgeous. His skin was so pale it was easy to leave a mark of ownership on him. Not that he had seen much of that skin, as Draco liked to keep his clothes on.
Why was it that the more he heard Potter say his name, the more he liked it?
Pansy hadn’t liked it, but she was pregnant and the live of her child was more important that pride or friendship or Draco.
“It’s not about me, it’s about you Draco and I know it’s been only two weeks since I came through your door and you welcomed me so warmly-“
She held up her hand. “You can’t take it on. It’s family and blood related.”
Harry nodded and in that moment Draco really wanted to make this good for Harry, more than good, amazing. Nothing short of amazing would do here, Draco decided.
“I don’t know. The truth is that I don’t know him,” Harry said and realized that it was really true. He had probably never known Draco. He had imagined Draco, had built him up in his mind and his memory to be this antagonist of his childhood. But they had only a handful of encounters and conversations over the years.
“I like looking at you,” Harry said, coming closer. By now it was second nature to him to call up the barrier when they got in the mood. He had never been completely naked with Harry before, and he really couldn’t wait for the day he could touch Harry, kiss him, intertwine their fingers.
“It’s not mine anymore. Someone snatched it away,” Draco said, because he wasn’t in the habit of lying to himself. His heart belonged to Harry now. For better or for worse.
Draco swirled his wand between his fingers. He wasn’t a helpless damsel in distress. He could take care of himself. He had more up his sleeve than he had let on, but it was good to have some secrets.
“Don’t be stupid, Harry. I want to be admired for my art,” Draco said, and kissed Harry hard on that talented mouth.
If Harry was being honest, which he tried to be with himself at least, he was glad that he had a solid wooden door between him and – well, Malfoy. He rubbed the bridge of his nose and then took a deep breath that did nothing to calm him down.
“It’s good you finally came up with a title, Blaise was getting impatient,” Harry said.
“You know anyone who would be willing to help with that?” Harry asked.
“I would never have made it to sixteen or older if not for Hermione and Ron,” Potter said, with a fond smile.
Harry nodded and left for bed.
“You’re staring at my lips,” Potter said.
“I guess we should have had that talk a bit earlier, but really, I had no idea how to even start,” Harry said, between kisses.
“Oh,” Harry said. He was fascinated. No one had told him about glamours just yet. “Can you teach me some?”
Suddenly, Luna’s disembodied voice was right there beside them. “The wards just started up. Someone's coming."
The inside of the manor was cool. The wall at his back felt chilling in fact. There was no fire lit and no lamps burning. It was a fucking tomb, Draco really wondered what the hell he was doing here.
“He did save the wizarding world from ruin and dark times, but also: this is an opportunity, Draco. Pansy told me how you used to bitch that Potter threw your offer of friendship in your face-“
~Two~
Harry stood up abruptly and Ivan looked at him. “I’m going out for lunch.”
“Exactly, and I'm thinking maybe it’s the latter,” Bears said, putting his teacup down. It looked even more delicate in his big hand. “We now suspect that these murders are connected to that ritual that killed you ten years ago, and we are pretty sure the killer is trying to recreate this ritual. Aside from me, Auror Potter, and Auror Devereux, no one is privy to this information. Except, of course, the killer. Or killers, because we have to assume that all the other people ten years ago intended to kill you.”
“Draco-“
“Because secrets between you two never ended well,” Blaise replied, with a flicker of his eyes to Draco’s chest.
“How it feels when I come around your cock, Harry.”
“I hear the voice of doom,” Draco replied. “You have the test results?”
“What?”
“Okay, did you remember what has been done to you or what you did?” Harry wanted to know.
“Well, at least I know now that you aren’t selling dangerous potions on the black market.”
“I’ll think about it,” Draco said.
“Yes,” Harry admitted.
“If I remember correctly you should be naked and hard,” Draco said.
“Someone does,” Draco replied.
“It’s your family home,” Harry said.
Harry winced inwardly, that was true of course.
“But you’re hard and,” he glanced over to Antoine, “he’s hard too.”
It was late October by the time they finally narrowed five locations down. It had been of course stupid to hope all of them would be in Great Britain. They were all over Europe.
That warning came too late of course, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.
“Fuck,” he said again. This year was going to be a lot harder than he had thought and he hadn’t thought that it would be easy for him or any other Seventh-year Slytherin in the first place.
Blaise waved it away. “Whatever. The headmistress ordered it.“
Harry nodded. “He's always been excellent at Potions.”
“Now, Draco. Do it now,” Harry moaned, and Draco put on a condom and did. His cock was bigger than three fingers, it was hotter too, it filled Harry out and-
“Might be enough for a grudge,” Draco threw in.
“Come on, or I will make you and you know I can.”
“Why wouldn’t I be alright, Harry,” Draco asked.
“Your pretty cock inside me.”
“Well, yes, as silent partners. Blaise is rich, yes, but a bit more backing would help him too,” Draco replied.
“What the fuck did I just read?“ There had been no real introduction to the story, you just jumped in with both feet and hoped to keep up. It was strange how it sucked you in from the very first page. Before Harry knew what was happening, he had read the first five chapters and his fingers itched to pick the book up again. But the last chapter had been very graphic. It was like – written pornography. Harry wasn’t a stranger to sex, but he hadn’t been prepared for this at all. The thought crossed his mind that Luna probably left that bit out on purpose.
Draco opened the door. “Why? Are you going to tell on me?”
“Guess we were wrong about Julien only having worked with Lerch,” Harry said.
“It’s my natural default when it comes to you,” Draco answered. Probably because he had been stung deeply as a child when Potter had told him he didn’t want to be friends. Things like that could really impact a person.
Harry nodded. “But did you realize that the only parts I kind of remembered involved Draco for some reason, or muggles?” Like the Origami bird, Harry thought. There had been other flashes of memory, and they had all involved Draco somehow. There was one in particular that was haunting him. Draco’s face, tears streaming down his pale skin, and then blood. So much blood. He knew he had to ask about it, but he wanted to ask Draco.
