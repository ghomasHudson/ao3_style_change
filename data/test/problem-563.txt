His muscles relaxed and he pulled Malfoy’s mouth of him, letting go of Malfoy’s hair, as he let himself drop on the cold tiles - spent.
They sat in silence, Malfoy’s thumb rubbing along the back of his hand in comfort, and Harry’s heart nearly pounding out of his chest. The soft touch of Malfoy’s hand against his somewhat calming the rush of adrenaline within his veins. The ride down was silent - neither of them talking, instead both lost in their own thoughts.
Harry pulled his tongue and face away from the man's ass, moving up to kiss his lips, tongue pushing through thin lips. Harry pulled away, whispering a spell and moving his hand down, resting his fingers against the wizard's opening, feeling it stretch around the tips of his fingers. The man beneath him moaned as Harry pushed two of his fingers in, scissoring, adding a third quickly, before the man was moaning and begging beneath him. Harry pulled his fingers out, positioned himself and pushed in. Harry let his head drop with a groan at the warmth that surrounded his cock, as he bottomed out. He waited for a few moments, before the wizard pushed down, and Harry pulled back, then slammed back in - hard.
‘’Harry?’’ Draco questioned, but Harry shushed him, before kneeling down onto one knee. Draco’s breath hitched, his eyes widening, as the words from the last piece of parchment he’d found, repeated themselves in his mind. The place where you will hopefully say yes.
Malfoy and him were standing on the opposite sides of the bathroom, glares on both their faces. Harry had followed Malfoy in here, found him crying as he stood bend over the sink in the bathroom. Malfoy’s eyes had widened, staring at him as Harry had walked in - frozen in the doorway - and Harry had seen his body shaking. But in a split second, Malfoy had pulled himself together, and looked at Harry with a cold glare. Which brings him to what they are doing now - staring each other down.
‘’No, no, I mean yes, I mean, - ’’ Harry rushed out, before laughing nervously and taking a deep breath to start over, ‘’what I mean to say, is I would love to go on a date with you.’’
Malfoy pulled back, placing kisses down his neck, sucking on his pulse point and Harry groaned, dropping his head back as he pushed his hips into Malfoy’s.
Draco was breathing softly, warm breath ghosting across Harry’s chest and Harry smiled triumphantly. It seemed as if his plan at shutting Draco up had worked successfully.
Draco pulled at Harry’s hand, urging the man to stand up, flinging himself at Harry the moment he was standing.
Draco hummed, his fingers tracing the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck, revelling in the way Harry shivered against him.
Malfoy’s eyes widened and before Harry knew it, he was pressed against the door - which, Malfoy must have shut, he thought fleetingly - with pale, thin lips pressing against his as Malfoy’s hips grinded into his, hands bruisingly gripping his hips.
After a few seconds, Malfoy relaxed into a sitting position, leaning his head forward against Harry’s chest. Malfoy waved a hand around lazily to cast a charm to clean himself. Their panting was the only sound in the room, as they tried to come down from their climaxes.
''Potter,'' Malfoy said, and Harry looked sideways at Malfoy, nodding his head in acknowledgement, ''Malfoy.''
Usually, Harry didn’t mind Draco’s questions. Thought it was cute that Draco was so curious, so fascinated about literally anything. But right now, Harry felt like he was cursed. Actually, at this moment, he’d
Draco's eyes lit up, a smile growing on his face and he surged forward to hug Harry, face coming to rest in the crook of Harry's neck. Harry fell into Draco's arms, as easily as the first time, and sighed happily.
Draco frowned at the words, confused, before doing as told and turning around to see Harry standing in front of him. A nervous smile played around Harry’s lips, and Draco tilted his head.
Harry shook his head, that fight had been last one of the many they had had before, and also one of their worst. Malfoy had been right - they did not work together, they were too different. But, then again, hadn't they been similar in the way that they had both been children in the war, who had never asked to be in the position that they had been thrown in? Hadn't they left behind their rivalry, hadn't they had something special, something worth fighting for?
Draco bit his lip to fight the smile and blush from forming on his face as he remembered, and he quickly folded the paper and made his way into the adjoining bathroom. On the mirror, a piece of paper was fluttering, calling out to him. Draco reached for it.
Harry thrust his hips, guiding Malfoy’s head with the hand in his hair, softly hitting the back of Malfoy’s throat with his cock - revelling in the small moans and gagging sounds that left Malfoy’s mouth.
Harry chuckled shakily, shock still running through his veins from Draco's admission. He brought his hands up to take Draco's into his, squeezing softly, ''I won't tell him, if you promise something in return,'' he said. Draco nodded fervently, eyes wide and Harry smiled, feeling his chest warm.
Silence overtook them, Harry fidgeting with the glass in his hand, before he cleared his throat awkwardly, deciding to break the silence.
to you,'' Harry said, eyes tearing slightly and he blinked, wishing for them to go away, ''But, probably worst of all, I am sorry that I am still so in love with you that I am fucking up all of my relationships, letting you cloud my mind and my thoughts. That I am still so in love with you that I would do anything to get you back, that I would still fight for you, even though I know you don't - and probably never will - love me as much as I have loved you, as I still do.''
The next time Harry encounters Malfoy is - coincidentally - once more at a Ministry function. Harry was back at his usual spot at the bar at these kind of functions, where he would nurse a few drinks, socialize with some people, before he did his round and slipped away quietly. Once again, Harry was sipping on his Firewhisky, when Malfoy stepped through the doors wearing dark green dress robes, and Harry's heart stuttered. He threw his glass back, finishing the liquid, before he placed it on the bar behind him and walked away, intent on avoiding Malfoy as fast as he could.
The next morning, he was woken in the usual way, as he had every Christmas morning since James was four. Their bed was invaded by their excited children, all demanding that they get up and go down with them to open their presents. Harry loved these mornings as they reminded him that his children had a happy childhood. They quickly put their dressing gowns on and hurried downstairs.
Lucius Malfoy stepped up to Harry, and he expected to be told off or something like that, but the older man just patted his shoulder and smiled. Then he joined his smiling wife, and they both left the room.
Ron was already there in his Auror robes as he just popped down from work. They had been scheduled to arrive just at the time when the vote was taking place. The chamber was closed for the event, but Harry wouldn't have seen much anyway, since they cast their votes on such occasions on secret ballots. He was desperately trying not to pace. Then, the doors were opening, and people were walking out presumably to have a break, and there was Arthur, smiling. He stood before Harry, patted his back and said, "Congratulations, Harry. You are now officially a member of the Wizengamot and the holder of two votes."
"Believe what you will, Harry. Still, this costume says to everyone tonight that you are going to be just as important as he had been." She slipped her arm into the crook of his arm and pulled him out of the room, down the stairs, straight to the Floo.
"What is that supposed to mean?" She raised her voice a bit and noticed from the corner of her eyes that the patrons sitting closer to them were eavesdropping.
The next morning they were served breakfast in bed. There was a strong espresso for both of them. Harry was glad for the milk though. They also got a sort of egg dish, which was whipped eggs cut into a square shape with tomatoes and sausages mixed in, mozzarella on top. Harry liked the strong flavour of basil in it.
"Right this way," the goblin led him to one of the carts and soon they were speeding through the tunnels.
Hermione stood up and poured a glass of Firewhisky. She handed it to the blond and he drank it without even glancing at the glass. He put it down onto the coffee table empty, but the fury was gone from his countenance.
Almost half a year had passed and Harry was happy. He was doing a job he loved, living with the man he loved and there were no dark wizards breathing down his neck. Summer turned to autumn and the morning of September 1st passed without any trips to London. Strangely enough, no owls even found them. The Wizarding World seemed to be all right, as the Muggle news didn’t report on any strange happenings.
"Oh, I know. He is very discreet about it though, so no one actually knows." She chuckled to herself at the little joke. "He loves to string women along just for the fun of it. How do
"I could hardly call the grandeur of Malfoy Manor a 'hole', Potter. That describes your house better."
After dinner, the children retreated to finish their homeworks and play among themselves, or in Lily's case, to go to sleep. The boys had a house-elf keeping an eye on them, who was also instructed to get them to bed in a few hours.
"Yes. I had more energy. It was like the fog I had been stumbling in had suddenly lifted and I could see everything more clearly. I must have been ill."
"Your help? Why would you help me?" Hermione asked, flabbergasted, amazed, and generally confused about why suddenly Draco Malfoy of all people was offering his help to a Mudblood.
"Now that we have a general plan of action, we have to work out the details of the first step." Malfoy sat back with a serious look on his face. "What Wizarding venue should we select for your big row?"
"You don't know that." Harry was staying calm. He found it so easy to stay calm since the war; it just came naturally to him. He was not even the least tempted to mention how he had saved Malfoy’s life, or how Narcissa Malfoy saved his.
After breakfast, Harry and Draco perused the internet for jobs. Before leaving the Wizarding World, both boys performed a spell that was used for creating IDs in the Muggle World, so there was no problem with records and such. Harry found a position as a writer, which had interested him since childhood, but Draco had a tougher time. He didn't have many skills that could be useful in the new world he found himself in.
They walked on, and Harry was glad for the rather warm weather. It felt more like autumn than winter. In the morning rush hour, the street was packed with cars. They never seemed to stop honking, and about once every five minutes an ambulance could be heard blaring it's sirenes somewhere. Harry thought it took away from the ambience. They finally reached a big junction, and some more ruins. Harry took pictures of those as well, even though they didn't look terribly interesting. They turned onto a really wide street with three lanes going in both directions. Tall trees stood on either side, and an arch was visible at the end.
He was just starting on chapter two, when Scops landed on his nightstand and impatiently held his leg out. Harry took the message off the limb and the owl immediately flew off, not even waiting for a word from its owner. Harry remembered how he used to talk to Hedwig and felt a pang in his heart again. He chased it away with a sigh and opened the parchment.
"I'm glad to be of help." The man grinned back. "You do need it, but I'm sure that given a bit of time, you'll become an excellent Wizengamot member and a proper Light Wizard."
"I'm glad that you and Ginny are spending more time together," Mr. Weasley began. "She had been travelling so much after Lily's birth, we were afraid that your marriage was in jeopardy."
Harry headed to the flower greenhouse after turning down the suggestion that he lie down in one of the guest bedrooms. He loved the smell of flowers there and hoped that they would help him in resting his eyes on a bench. They looked hard, but all had cushioning charms on them to make them more comfortable. Harry lay down on a long one where he could stretch his legs out and there was some more room left over his head even. However, he could still not rest. His mind was as on edge as it had been all night.
He waited for his wife in the sitting room near the Floo. They had already had breakfast, or at least everyone else did and he just munched on plain toast and drank a bit of tea. He wished everything was over already. He just couldn't think about what was going to happen after the Vote anymore. When Ginny finally arrived in one of her more expensive robes, he leapt out of his seat and tossed powder into the fire before she could say a word.
Harry woke slowly. He was still gripped in the arms of sleep, but felt something warm engulfing his manhood. It felt wonderful. He opened his eyes, and looked down to see a head bobbing up and down under his white sheets. He smiled, and slowly uncovered …
Every wand on the side of the Dark went up. Harry was grinning as he saw that. He knew that it would go through. He hoped that perhaps some wands on the Light side would also make an appearance, but all he got was glares from the other side. The scribe counted the wands, taking Harry’s into account twice. Then the man handed the paper over to the Chief Warlock.
With the knowledge of something irreplaceable breaking, he smiled at his daughter as she showed him the pictures of the dark-haired knight and the green dragon with yellow scales down its back. He marvelled at Lily’s skill and it was soon time for dinner.
"Well, it's obviously pretty hard on you keeping what's happening between us a secret from the children. If we went away together, then you could just focus on the relationship, make sure this is what you want, and get comfortable in it. There is no better way to find out if you want to be with someone than to see them in a foreign environment," Draco explained.
"Fine, Potter. Desk duty until further notice. Ron here will get another  partner and you will be alone while you are on desk duty," he sentenced  Harry.
"He wanted to use me like that too,” Harry said, disturbed by the thought of Voldemort putting his hands on the blond. “However, I thought you would be happy at the idea of getting the Dark Mark and getting your arse filled with his cock."
"Who's Albus?" Draco asked as they walked down a corridor. Harry noted that most of the portraits were sleeping. He was glad as the blond residents of the house generally hadn't liked him in the past and he assumed that it only changed for the younger generations.
As they waited for their food, it was hard to keep their hands off of each other. Harry did send an air kiss towards the blond, and they settled for playing footsie under the table.
"Harry, what were you thinking taking Hermione in?" was the first thing that  came out of her mouth.
"You have been trying to learn proper Wizarding culture?" Malfoy was clearly surprised at the revelation.
"Oh, I'm pretty sure I was exactly who you thought I was back at Hogwarts," Draco said and looked down at his tea for a few seconds. "However, I did a lot of growing up since. I no longer think that I'm the best at everything just because I'm a Malfoy. Now, I'm the best at everything because I worked at it." He grinned and the others chuckled a bit.
Maybe they were found and Death Eaters were currently beating him up in the middle of the living room? Or the Order found them and quickly tore the Boy-Who-Lived from the arms of a presumed enemy? No, Draco would have woken up for either occasion.
"Oh yes, lots. Hildegard got a great champagne. I do love the idea of dressing you as Dumbledore," he remarked.
They had a fun, work-free day together, and decided to have a party for New Year’s Eve next week. They set about the task of inviting all their neighbourhood friends. They realised just how many they had. Harry was looking forward to the party, as he had never organised one before.
"With a majority of one, the law passes. Congratulations to Mr Potter on putting his first proposal through," said the Chief and the Dark side clapped.
Harry was seething. Yet again, the old fool thwarted his plan with his meddling. Dumbledore was just one of the reasons for his actions, but one of the main ones. Ever since Harry heard the prophecy, he knew what was expected of him, but the old man still refused to give him more information than the basics. The end of sixth year was the last straw. Harry knew that Voldemort was up to something, constantly calling Snape to him, mentioning a potion from time to time. Harry told Dumbledore about the visions and asked him if he knew about the potion, but he just told Harry not to worry, everything was under control.
"Oh, the members don't get paid? I didn't know that." Harry was playing dumb very well and he actually couldn't believe how easy it was to fool her. "You know, Ginny, maybe I should learn more. This whole thing with Hermione got me interested in finding out more about the laws and such. Being on the Wizengamot would give me even more opportunities and it would be something I could do for Our World without putting myself in danger. We don't need the money I make as an Auror anyway, thanks to our investments. I feel I could really make a difference." He surprised himself by actually telling the truth, but twisting it in a way that Ginny would hear what she wanted to. Perhaps the Hat had been right all along and all this time he was just really hiding...
"All right, Harry," she said as she opened the door. She was probably wearing one of her newer robes, which meant it was only a few years old, but still looked rather worn. However, her hair fell down her back in long waves and her make-up was really nice. Over the past years, she had obviously learned some better grooming charms.
"Of course! The more children the better!" He grinned broadly. "What excellent advice! Thank you so much for that Mr. Mildew, I'll follow your guidance." Harry figured that the best policy in this case was to simply agree with the man and flatter him as much as possible. Draco had said in his brief teaching that flattery could always get you out of a tight situation.
In the evening the next day, the whole family was sitting down to eat a delicious meal. Harry looked around in happiness, and briefly wondered what a turn his life had taken. Then suddenly, a house-elf popped into existence beside him.
He was just about to leave a dark room, which was only illuminated by the rather bright moonlight, when he passed a slightly open connecting door. From the next room he heard voices and not able to help his curious nature, peaked inside. There he could see Astoria Malfoy sitting in all her splendour, surrounded by other ladies and holding court. She was obviously dressed as a fairy as her magical brightly coloured wings fluttered behind her.
Ginny was not at the table. Like most mornings, she was away somewhere. Harry tried to remember where she had gone off to, then recalled her mentioning some tropical island in the Pacific. He couldn't think of the name though. In the last two years she had proclaimed that she had had enough of sitting at home and expressed a desire to travel. Harry would have gone with her, but she didn’t want the presence of the children, and Harry’s career was important, so she went off on her own. Ever since then, she would only stay a week at home at a time, until she wanted to be somewhere else. Harry understood her desire to see the world and as she was his wife, he supported her fully. The children occasionally missed her, but Harry always had a more active role in their lives, even when she was present. Harry always understood everything she did.
"I suppose." Harry didn't want to tell her that all the effort was making him more uncomfortable and more aware that he hadn't missed his wife as much as he should have.
"Or else what?" Hermione asked, her voice forceful, but emotionless. "What are you going to do, Ron Weasley? What can you do except bully everyone around you? I don't know how I could stand you as long as I did. I must have been blinded by love. Well, I don't love you anymore," she declared. "Lucius, I'm sorry, but could you take me home?" Hermione asked, turning to her escort. "I tire of this."
"Well, we have two options. You can either go back to your husband." He looked at Hermione, who shook her head in response. "Or you could take my help," he said, looking straight into her eyes.
Harry chatted with Hermione for as long as he could, but he did have to pick up the kids from school. He noticed the sadness in her eyes as he got ready to leave and had to reassure her that soon enough they could meet more often again. He left her out there, gazing out into the park, her thoughts most likely lost in how her children would love to play in the piles of dry leaves that characterised this time of the year.
"So, what did I miss?" she inquired as she looked at the two boys in front of her. Harry found himself blushing, but he didn't know why.
"Maybe he will." Harry tried to set his father-in-law's mind at rest. However, he found that he didn't really care himself. The rift between him and Ron appeared to be final in his heart.
On Christmas morning the tree arrived too, and Harry got it into their bedroom. He woke up Draco, who was surprised by the new decoration.
Harry was glad to be surrounded by them and hugged them tightly. Hermione and Scorpius also left the water and she had a question on her face. Harry just mouthed 'later'.
"Exactly," Malfoy agreed. "In my generation most of the families have only one child. Now that we are at peace, some of the parents are attempting to have more children, but they're rarely successful. We've been trying to hide it, but we can't any longer. The majority of the purebloods are in trouble. That is why the educational reform is so important to us. We're trying to preserve what it means to be a wizard along with our bloodlines." Malfoy sighed. "So - I'm willing to support you in changing the family law if you help me."
They arrived to a lavishly decorated Floo entrance chamber and quickly moved on to leave room for the other arrivals.
Harry did look at him, he would have anyway at hearing his given name from those luscious full lips.
In Gringotts, Harry couldn't do anything, but get the 50 Galleons he was allowed and exchange it for Muggle money. It was probably why Dumbledore had put the cap on his withdrawals in the first place. He was about to walk out the large doors of the bank, when from behind him he heard a familiar voice screaming at the goblins.
His three children came down soon after, but they did not make the racket that you would expect in a house full of children with Weasley blood. Instead, their feet made soft sounds on the carpeted stairs. James was still in his pyjamas, hair sticking up all over, obviously having just rolled out of bed. He was not a morning person and usually groaned at everything and everyone until he changed and was off to school.
"I see you're up already. Happy birthday, Harry!" he said, and placed the tray on the bed. He parted the curtains with a flick of his wand.
He took the redhead's arm and looked around for the rest of the family. He soon noticed their ginger heads, the two of them huddled together in the far side of the room. He made his way to them and without saying anything they all went home.
As the tongue sought out his and began to massage, he felt hot all over. He couldn't decide if it was the Firewhisky or the kiss, but it made him giddy. He sprang into action as well, returning the kiss. Harry felt hands in his hair, tugging him closer as their bodies also connected, and his hands also found the short blond strands. Harry's head was falling backwards, onto the soft armrest behind him. Draco was following him, not breaking the kiss and his body came to rest above his partner's. It wasn't very comfortable, but it felt strangely comforting. The kiss was warm, and Harry could taste even more Firewhisky, but it felt like the best kiss he ever had. The part of his brain that was still rational tried to point out that he didn't have much of an experience in that regard, but he supposed it was like eating chocolate. Even if you've never had much of it, you still knew which one you liked the most.
"Well, we'd better get started with the mingling," the older Weasley said and they got up from the table, leaving Ron to his food.
He collapsed onto his previous spot next to his lover, and panted for what must have been several minutes. His body felt exhausted, his muscles straining, but the euphoria from his orgasm was still there. He only looked at Draco once he had calmed down somewhat, to see the other man already recovered, and looking at him grinning.
"Not really. However, they had the ability to kill intruders and I guess that sort of qualified them as dark."
He hoped that Ginny would return and made his way back to the Banthai hotel. There he inquired after his wife again, but apparently she had not returned. Harry was getting really hungry by then and the receptionist recommended the hotel restaurant, The Port. She told him that if his wife turned up she could send someone to get him there. It was a good plan and he soon sat down on one of the brown chairs. It was right off the beach and he could  still enjoy the last moments of the daylight from there. The place was quickly filling up and he was glad that he arrived early. He ordered off the menu and was soon enjoying a nice fruit cocktail as he waited for his food. He ate all of an assortment of local seafood and even had some dessert accompanied by another cocktail, but his wife still hadn't returned to her room. He went back to the reception.
"Who would have thought," Hermione said as she looked back to her old friend from watching her new one leave.
“So wives are discouraged from going against the head of the family by laws, which could be put in place because Light Wizards have dominated the
"Yes, a complacency potion. It made you want to go along with what you're told. It was in the fruit juice, same as with me," Harry revealed.
The outside of the restaurant was quite simple, painted a deep purple with dark green roof tiles. They walked in the front door and were greeted by a pretty young witch in long purple robes and a pointy hat.
"I know. I always know. Maybe you not know and why you have problem with wife. Come with me and I show you."
"But .... we were fourteen!" He was astounded. The least of his problems that year were hormones. Though there was that whole thing with Cho.
"Oh I'm quite sure, my son." Arthur patted his hand reassuringly. "You have nothing to worry about."
"Harry, better grab some of the food before it's all gone!" Ron exclaimed as he sat down. He was balancing two smaller plates, one on each of his massive hands. He managed to put them down safely before he sat down on his chair. "I don't understand why they never have normal plates on these occasions, just these tiny ones," he scoffed. "So, are you going to get something?" Ron looked questioningly at Harry.
"Me - in the Wizengamot? I'm not good at politics. Wait, did you say seats? I have seats there?" He tried to recreate the astonishment on his face that was there the first time he learned of his stolen seats. He had wondered how Ginny was going to explain her father holding onto them without even consulting him. At the time though, he probably would not have wanted them anyway.
Afterwards, they shared a glass of Firewhisky and Ginny promised that she would return with the kids and stay for a while. She felt that her husband just missed having a woman around. In return, Harry promised to take some time off from work to spend more time with his family. Soon enough, Ron excused himself and Ginny led her man upstairs for some fun before the kids came back.
There sat Hermione and she was more elegant than ever. The dark-haired man was reminded of how she looked at the Yule ball. She didn't appear so beautiful even on her wedding day. She wore a pale yellow robe that looked incredibly soft and her hair rested on her left shoulder in effortless, but obviously sculptured waves. She held a delicate cup in her hand with its saucer in the other that Harry felt very uncomfortable about touching himself, as two identical sets rested on the ornate white iron table in front of her, just waiting for the two men.
They all settled down in one of the parlors. The older Malfoys and Hermione joined them, and the house-elves brought refreshments. It turned into quite the little party as with Draco’s help, Harry told them almost everything about the trip. He did leave out the kissing parts.
From the train, they quickly made it outside the train station, where they did get a taxi. Draco wasn't that ready to join the Romans on the many crowded buses that passed by. Hailing the taxi was when Harry first noticed the heat. It was a lot warmer than it had been in London, but not as hot as in Thailand. He was somewhat glad, as Thailand was a bit too hot for his system.
This is a bit short, and I tried to rewrite it several times, but I just feel that this is the place to end it. Thank you for reading everyone, and please review. Even if you didn't like it, and more so if you have constructive criticism. I'm not sure what I want to write now. I am working on a book, but for some reason it's not moving forward. I'm also translating a romance my mum wrote.
"No buts! You just confessed to not being fully aware of Wizarding Law. You  will be sitting at your desk, studying it, until I deem it necessary. Now  leave," Greer said and pointed to the door.
"But all the purebloods have been furious with me, telling me that I should go back to Ron. He is a pureblood too, Harry," she pointed out.
"Well, Harry, Ginny says that you would like to take your place in the Wizengamot." Arthur got right down to business.
"Not all people want to breed a herd of little Weasleys." Draco stepped to the counter as he spotted the book lying there. "Nocer Picard? Isn't that rather above your intellect?" he asked Harry.
Harry shook the man's hand grinning, feeling relieved. In spite of all the assurances that he got, he still couldn't help but feel like he was not going to get them. How wrong he had been.
"You loved him," Harry stated, remembering the way she cried over him dating Lavender their sixth year.
"I don't know yet," was his sincere reply and he couldn't help but try to seek out some red heads among the crowd. He spotted the three of them grouped together in one corner, probably discussing what went down.
"You're right, Ron. However, you need to calm down first. It wouldn't look good if you showed up in front of a person of importance not having slept and in the same robes you had on for the Ball," Harry tried to reason with the man. He really was still in his costume and he had obviously spent the night drinking.
When Harry woke up, night had already fallen. Draco was sitting beside him, reading a book, his right hand still on the dark head of his friend. Harry hadn't slept so deeply in many days. He still got up and went in search of his children, with Draco silently directing him, as it was obviously time for his guests to depart.
"What if we go over the plans for the next phase again? Just so that it can be fresh on your mind for your evening meeting with Arthur?" she offered the change from an obviously uncomfortable subject.
"Not far, Mr Potter, not far. Go down on street right one corner, go down street on left, walk and there hotel," Mr Samarn explained in heavily accented but somewhat understandable English.
They both got up to leave, but Hermione and Adrian were still sitting at their table, apparently having a good time.
Ron looked towards the interruption, threw an accusatory glance towards the man still sitting on the couch and walked over to the fireplace.
"Of course not. I'm not either." He moved in closer, pushing the side of his body against Harry. He felt very warm and inviting. Harry felt the urge to swallow and the heat rise in his own body. The boy was blatant. Harry was not a rock and for a moment he was transported back to that night at the ball, hearing Adrian talk about what he would like to do to Draco. Harry shook his head and stepped away from the persistent boy.
The kiss came back to Harry with disturbing clarity. The feel of a lean, hard body over his, pressing him down into the couch.
"Ron, let's go to lunch," Arthur instructed his son and with a sad look, steered him away from potentially losing his job and getting locked up.
"Well, we stayed up all night on the solstice and had fun around the great bonfire in the garden." Scorpius began his account of the holiday. "When the sun finally came up the next day and the longest night was over, we cheered and thanked the gods. After that, we went into the house, got the presents from under the tree, and gave them to each other as symbols of how much we love each other. That's how wizards hold the holiday." The young Malfoy seemed very pleased with himself and Harry smiled at him in an attempt to disguise his puzzlement at the fact that he had never heard of such a thing. He supposed it was a dark wizard custom that he was going to have to follow in the future. Just as he was about to inquire of the whereabouts of the rest of the family, he heard the approach of the distinct steps of Draco. He was surprised for a moment by how easily he recognised them.
“Fine.” Harry was surprised at how readily he had agreed. “But you become a Dark Wizard once you get it and support my educational reform. In exchange, I’ll support your divorce law.”
Harry let go, and his palm ached from holding on too tightly. Draco flexed his even whiter than usual fingers, and they rapidly filled with blood again. Harry winced.
"It's so boring, Dad. All the other children are so behind. Then they tease me for being smart, and the teacher bugs me for not paying attention. I don't like any of it." He hung his head.
He looked up, and as grey meet green, Harry understood that Malfoy was as desperate to bring about the reforms as Hermione was to get her children back. While the witch thought about her family, the wizard thought about a whole generation. The dark-haired man nodded in understanding, confirming their earlier pact.
On the way there, he thought about telling Hermione about his budding relationship, but he wasn't sure. It was a big revelation about himself, and he wanted to declare it from the rooftops. However, he wasn't all that sure just what sort of relationship he now had with Draco. Was it friends with benefits? Boyfriends? They just didn't get around to discussing it yet. In the end, he decided to see what Draco would do. If he didn't say anything, then Harry wanted to discuss things in the evening.
He was almost done when the Floo flared to life and she stepped out in dark blue robes that were embroidered with a white leaf pattern along the edges. Harry assumed the cut must have been in style, because he had seen the more well-dressed witches wear similar robes on Diagon Alley, but he didn't really know what was different about it. Clothes would always be just clothes for him. Hermone was beaming in them though and that was what really mattered. Apparently the shopping had done her good emotionally. She sat down at the table in front of him after her chipper greeting and once the elf served her meal, she began to eat. It was obvious that she was taking care not to get something on her new robes, she was eating so slowly.
Harry shrugged and tried the next door, which actually turned out to be the bathroom. He closed the door behind him and went about his business. As he was wondering about what to do for the taste in his mouth, a house-elf popped in with a tooth-brush. He also decided to shower since he still stank of sun and sweat. He was a bit reluctant to put his dirty boxers back on, but he had left his shrunken trunk in Patong. Once he was done, he went out to let the owner in.
Faye beta read this as well. She did this quickly while also editing her own works of fiction. Check out Drarry Shippers, because the links to her fanfics are there, and do read them.
After breakfast he sent the boys up to get dressed and taking the four-year-old Lily himself, got her ready for the day as well. Once everyone was ready, he used the Floo in the living-room to take James and Albus to the magical primary school that their grandmother, Molly Weasley ran and then dropped Lily off at the day-care. In no time at all, he was sitting behind his desk in the Ministry, looking at his Auror files. Just like every day.
"Right." The head was gone for a second, but quickly returned and had the outline of a potion bottle next to it. "You'll have a hard time drinking the hangover relief in that position though."
"I like to wrap my own gifts. And you're not getting the broom." Inside Harry cheered himself. Sometimes being assertive was a good thing.
He went into the toilet and enlarged his trunk with a wandless spell. His first order of business was to brush his teeth as he could still taste bile in his mouth. Next, he changed into his swimming trunks and flip-flops, and then applied some tanning potion onto his skin. Afterwards, he got out some money and put it into a small waterproof bag that had some nasty Thief Repellent Charms on it. With his wand, he shrunk his trunk again and darkened his glasses into sunglasses. He then put the wand into the bag as well and was ready to hit the beach.
As Harry was waking up, he wasn't really aware of where he was, or what day it was. His mind still groggy with sleep, only registered that he was in a very comfortable bed, and he was hugging someone in his sleep. He opened his eyes, and he saw the top of a white blond head. His chin was buried in the soft strands, the body of his companion moulded against his front. As he moved slightly, his soft cock brushed against the backside of the person, and as he groaned, he heard an accompanying sound from the man in his arms.
"No problem." Draco smirked. "We can make a whole album if you want." He started to pose, and Harry took a few more shots of him.
Harry looked into the grey orbs once again and gulped. However, the alcohol together with Gryffindor courage helped. He closed his eyes and waited.
Before he knew it, they were standing in front of the house. In their bedroom they could finally do as they wanted, and fell into bed together.
As he contemplated the question, he realised that at the edge of his hearing there was a noise. Then a loud clatter of dishes and swearing.
Ginny entered their bedroom from the bathroom and smiled at him from behind old-fashioned spectacles. She was wearing a lot of tartan in her costume as McGonagall: tartan skirt, tartan robes, only her shirt was white. It was as if the clans of the Highlands had exploded on her, they all had a different pattern. Harry didn't think it was very flattering on her, but he didn't know anything about clothes, he reminded himself.
Harry was taken aback by the vehemence in Ron’s speech. He didn’t sound like the care-free, happy person he knew.
The ballroom in Malfoy Manor was full of Dark Wizards. It wasn't anything new to the residents of the house, but Harry felt rather uncomfortable in his dark green robes. He felt like the lone Gryffindor in a sea of Slytherins. They were all celebrating the passing of the bill. It had been a long time since they managed to make a law. Many went to chat with Harry and congratulate him. He blushed under the attention and ran a shaky hand through his hair. To gain some courage and not look like the complete novice that he was, he often grabbed a glass of champagne from the passing trays. The waiters were surprisingly human, surprisingly enough, something he wondered about.
She beamed at him but was trying to sneak a peak over Harry's shoulder, as if asking where her gift was. Harry took his wand and Summoned the package from the attic. It was also rather small but bigger than hers had been. She opened the obvious jewellery box with barely contained glee and gasped when she saw the content.
Harry turned around to see Draco Malfoy glaring at the small creatures, his hands on his hips. He snickered to himself that the gorgeous blond would be in the same predicament as he was. Gorgeous? Where did that come from?
and the cover depicted a blonde witch in the arms of a dark-haired wizard, both moving towards each other to stop just short of a kiss.
"No, it's just what she wanted. I ..." He fell silent. He just couldn't come up with a good excuse as to why he preferred his wife on some remote island rather than in his home. Ginny was his wife, the woman he wanted to share his life with. It's true that he had been very complacent in the past years and he did feel more energised since starting his diet. However, while he no longer wanted to go along with everything his wife wanted, he still didn't mind if she was away from him.
"Thank you," Harry said, and left, hearing 'phohb gaan my khraap' called out behind him. He assumed it was Thai for 'goodbye'.
As always, I thank my two betas for all their work. Faye, because I can ask her stuff about Britain that I may not know, and because she's my cheerleader. Plus she keeps talking about Drarry, which leads me to thinking about my fic, which leads me to writing more. She's like my muse. Icicle, I have to thank, for being my meticulous beta. She's still doing all the comma corrections, which is a feat in itself. I hope all her personal problems are handled now, and her uni work is going well.
Harry wasn't happy about being addressed so familiarly by a complete stranger, but he supposed most people felt like they knew him.
Second, Harry searched for Narcissa and there she was, sitting on a chair and chatting with some friends. She didn't seem bothered at all by what her husband was doing. Ironically, she was another Chocolate Frog card character, Morgana. She had a very elegant crown on her head, indicating that she was the Queen of Avalon.
Harry looked up at the tall horse and the lone saddle on it. For a brief moment, he considered that Lucius would somehow cause him to fall and break his neck, but since they were no longer enemies, he doubted the man would resort to such a scheme.
"You see, Harry, the other members have to vote for it. They have a say in who sits among them. The Wizengamot is one of the most defining bodies of government in Our World, so it stands to reason that if there is such a significant change in their group that they should have a say in it."
“If you’re going to use such crude language, Potter, we’d better get out of here.” he grabbed the arm of the younger man, and dragged him to a nearby alley. Incidentally the same one Harry had apparated into when he arrived.
"They are all great. Ron brings them over sometimes, but I'm not very comfortable about having him over. You're still his favourite subject and it's hard for me to listen to him talking about you that way." He remembered back to their most recent conversation.
"I suppose. Hermione should really get you a Barbie." He laughed, remembering the conversation they once had.
"What a wonderful idea, Harry! Dad could help you learn everything and Our World needs such an honest man in politics. Of course that would mean attending even more Ministry functions, but nothing I can't handle," she gushed, since she never missed those in the past either. Harry recalled her Apparating in from Bali last year for a Ministry ball, and then she returned the next day. She clearly enjoyed every minute of being the centre of attention on his arm. Not that there was anything wrong with that, since women generally did love those occasions when they could dress up, put tons of make-up on and wear high-heels. Then complain about it all. Yes, Ginny did seem to enjoy the whole show.
He looked down at Draco. His hair was a tangled mess, his skin was a rosy hue all over, and his breathing was still uneven. Still, he wore a happy and satisfied smile. When his eyes opened, he grinned wider at Harry, and held his arms out for him. Harry laid on top of him, kissing sloppily.
"Ugh, I hope this time you'll make much more pleasant ones. Anyway, Hermione is waiting on the eastern veranda with tea." He walked away, leading the other man around the great home.
Harry was not in a hurry to see his future ex-wife, and she was already waiting for him in the parlour. She was standing next to the large hearth in the room, snow dripping from the bottom of her trousers. She looked up from the fire as he entered.
"I'm not sure. I'm not really comfortable taking your money," she said as the water stopped and she was getting out of the shower.
"Watch it, Potter," he said as he looked down. "Watch your partner too.  Weasley is obviously off his rocker, accusing me of making illegal potions!"
"Oh, if I have men like you at my side, I'm sure of it." Harry hoped that he wasn't taking flattery a bit too far.
He walked to the bar, trying to find Ginny. A skinny Thai boy slinked next to him. His slim but muscular body gleamed gold from all the glitter. He wasn't wearing much, just some shorts and a smile. He leaned against the bar and got Harry's attention.
“I haven’t really said anything to Herm, I just ran out when she told me about the divorce. I had to plan, you see. Now I’m going to go back to her and throw her out of the house. I’ll tell her to not come back, or contact the kids, until she changes her mind. Then I’m going to call mum and tell her about what the bitch is doing. She’ll be furious at her.” Ron grinned. He was probably picturing the Howler that his mother would send to Hermione.
"No." Harry reeled back at the idea. To him, sex was never casual. He just couldn't view it like that. "However, there was a very persistent boy that I met. I kept telling him that I wasn't gay, but he insisted that I was." Harry frowned.
Now, time to thank my lovely beta. Faye did this chapter alone. She was very sweet about it, and didn't make a lot of corrections. She always encourages me when I have my bouts of self-doubt.
"Well, it appears that I'm in a good standing with most members of the Wizengamot, though they have expressed concern with how I handle Ginny. Therefore, now I aim to be a proper restrictive husband to her. No more travelling and running about on her own." Harry couldn't suppress the grimace at the thought.
So after the epilogue, I may not write HP anymore. Though I do keep thinking about my Lucius / Harry story, which I always wanted to write a sequel to. Now that would be dystopian. We’ll see. I also have this almost PWP idea for a series about Draco, from his POV. Though PWP needs a different kind of inspiration. :D
"He and my dad were great friends. Although it must have been weird for them, since Severus was a spy and all." Draco explained as he walked on. "Somehow, I think my father knew. He hinted a couple of times when Voldemort returned that I could go to Severus if something happened. I was such a fool that I didn't." His voice was so full of regret that Harry felt sorry for him.
sitting there?" Harry heard from next to him. He turned to Ginny and nodded. "Who is she with?" his wife inquired.
"That is the only thing that changed recently. You see, I was feeling off a few months ago. I went to see a mediwizard, but he couldn't see anything wrong with me. So I saved up from the grocery money and went to see a Muggle doctor. He had some tests done and it turned out that I had a Candida infection."
“Oh, by the way, I’m going to tell Scorpius that I’m getting divorced as well. It probably won’t come as a surprise to him though,” Draco revealed.
"Of course, mate. She belongs with me. I didn't do everything to get her just to let her go! Not ever!"
Harry knew that the oath was coming. He put his right hand over his heart and his left slightly in the air in preparation. He repeated every word as it was spoken.
After he left the small box that was his trunk at the reception, he went out to the sea again. The first thing he did was to kick off his flip-flops and let his feet sink into the warm sand. However, that didn't prove to be such a good idea as it burned him a little, so he quickly put them back on. Next, he put his bag down on the ground and walked into the sea to let the waves envelope him. He even swam a few strokes. Grinning from ear to ear, he decided to start looking for Ginny. After all, it would have been even better to enjoy these delights with her. He first examined the hair of the people in the water near him. The good thing about marrying a redhead, he thought, was that she was easy to spot. However, he had to get out of the water as he couldn't see her there. Wet and shivering a little at the breeze, he took his bag and began to walk around the beach. He did see some redheads but none proved to be Ginny.
"I'm terrrible! So she cheats on me." Harry took a big swallow, nearly choking in his haste. "She didn't love me. Just married Harry Potter. .... You were right, Drrracooo. You're smart. And I'm bad in bed. Bad, bed." He giggled at the sound of the two words together. He looked into the smiling grey eyes before him. "Wanna kiss me?"
“I have a position in the Wizengamot?” Harry said, and then almost cried out as Malfoy’s eyes were clouding again. “This is the first time I heard about it!” he shouted, attempting to calm the other man.
Wizarding world as it was in the Muggle one. I had no idea he could, or even would take them away,” she said into his shoulder.
"I stopped being a child a long time before that. I don't even know if I ever was one," he added in a sad whisper.
"Poor Lavinia! I'm so glad she moved to Switzerland and can't see the destruction of her home!" she cried, her voice rather high and sounding very snotty. "It's obvious that Hildegard was brought up as a Muggle. No taste whatsoever."
"I mean, too exhausted to do anything in the city. We should test this beautiful bed," Draco said, as he approached Harry.
"I get it, Harry. You were drunk and curious. It'll never happen again." He dismissed the topic with a wave of his hand. "So, let's get tea."
"Like I said, we got the house. It was yellow...like Ginny wanted. Then she furnished it. Got that awful sofa in the sitting room."
"I go wherever I please!" Hermione told him with no warmth. "I am a woman and an individual. I don't need any man to tell me where I can and can't go, or what I can and can't do! These past years I've never stood up for myself, now I do. If I have to make an enemy of you because of it, then so be it!"
"Relax. It's fine. Though, I have to admit, it's been a long time since anyone swooned when I kissed him." Draco smirked.
"I'm fine. The kids are sleeping here anyways ... way. I'd better sit down a bit." Harry swayed towards an exit.
"You can Floo there and tell them that you need the robes in a hurry. Maybe later we could go back and get you some other clothes. If we're associating with Malfoy for a length of time, you'll need it," he explained.
"Oh, Daddy, I have a great idea!" Ginny spoke up and she looked very excited about what she was going to suggest. "There is going to be a Ministry Ball for Halloween! I'm sure all the members are going to be there. It's one of the biggest events of the season! We could all go and you could introduce Harry formally. It would be a great opportunity to make an impression!"
“Potter, I know the laws as well as any solicitor. I’ve been studying them since I could read. The law was written to prevent women who are divorcing their husbands from getting their children. The little lenience it gives is only there to prevent a bastard from inheriting or a child from being harmed. Magical children are highly valued and there are many laws in place to prevent abuse. But if the Weasel does not abuse his children in any way, shape, or form, then he can keep them,” Malfoy explained to the frustrated duo before him.
"I do have to agree with them to a certain degree regarding that issue." Hermione nodded at what she heard. "I never did understand why you weren't bothered by her never being at home or with you? Since Lily was born, she had practically travelled the globe."
It had been a difficult day for Harry, but when his head hit the pillow, he felt oddly good. Things were happening and it was as though he had been standing still for many years. He was finally moving forward. He just hoped Hermione would get her children back in the end.
“Of course I’m sure!” Ron stood up and started pacing in front of the fireplace. “Of course you don’t know anything about dating, Harry, but a woman never leaves a man unless she already has someone lined up. The whore. If our kids didn’t have red hair, I would demand paternity tests on them.”
"Well, we wait to let the public know. Behind closed doors, that's a different story." He got up, and slightly swinging his hips, approached Harry. He leaned back to appreciate the view, and Draco climbed into his lap, straddling him on both sides. Harry put his arms around him, and their lips soon met in a kiss. It became heated right away, and Draco started to move his hips against Harry's crotch. Harry broke his lips away to moan.
"We'll have to rectify that. After everything settles down, we could take the kids to a couple of places as well over the summer."
"Are you insane, Harry?" she practically screeched at him. She had the shower going by then, but she had obviously used some sort of a charm to make sure that she heard Harry through the sound of the water. "On the one hand, Ginny is shorter and way skinnier than I am. I'd never fit into anything and using charms on those clothes would ruin them. I've seen what she wears all the time and those fabrics don't take to enlarging charms well. Besides, the way we are now, she'd be really cross with me if I wore anything of hers."
"At least I have three children to fill it with." He actually knew that it was a rather sore spot, as during one of their conversations Draco mentioned that he wished he had more children. The blond did flinch a little.
Harry could feel his heart racing, his palms getting slick with nervous sweat. When Draco sat down next to him, he swallowed and put his glasses down. Draco placed his right hand behind his head, and gently pushed their lips together. The soft pink pillows that were the blond's lips moved gently over Harry's, and then they opened to let his tongue out to play. Harry also parted his lips and when their tongues met, neither could resist a moan. Harry's right hand found its way into blond hair in an effort to keep their lips locked as the kiss became more passionate. Their tongues moved more rapidly and Harry moaned again as he felt himself getting impossibly aroused. Just as his left hand tried to find an opening under Draco's robes and shirt to touch the pale skin underneath, Draco broke the kiss.
"I'll be seeing you around, then. In the future, please call me just Bart," he said, as he got up, clearly finished with the assessment.
Harry contemplated it and just as he was about to say no, he noticed a colouring book on one of the dragon-shelves. He took it down and quickly paged through it.
Arthur just nodded and then he was called away by Percy. Harry was glad that the conversation was over, as the subject of Ginny was an awkward one for him. However, he wasn't sure why exactly.
Thank you my lovely Faye, for everything. Also, thank you Icicle, for working through all my comma mistakes. I confess, I'm terrible at commas. Then again, I'm terrible at them in my native language, so why should it be any different in my second language? I should progress with my Japanese. No commas.
"That's what I thought. Then I realised that's something we had learned from the Weasleys. So, I went to the bookstore and searched for anything on the subject. I found an old book in the used section and last night, I read a little of it. It's about Dark Wizards," he started to explain. "Apparently, the terminology doesn't even refer to using a type of magic, rather it's cultural. Light Wizard Culture has been dominant for several centuries. The author actually claims that she's afraid Dark Wizards will die out and that all their traditions will be lost. She further explained that Dark Wizards are called such as they follow the path of the Goddess, who is symbolised by the moon, and because of that they mostly perform rituals at night. For them, women are very important and unlike Light wizards, Dark Wizards don't rule over their wives."
Harry woke up in a very dark room. It took his sight a while to get accustomed to the sliver of light coming from a gap in the curtains. He looked around, trying to make sense of the world through a pounding headache. His mouth tasted like something died in it. He was sure he was in a bedroom and based on what he could remember from the previous day, it was probably somewhere in Malfoy Manor. He tried to piece together the fragmented pieces of memory. He recalled arriving in distress over Ginny. Then the alcohol. The talk. Draco kissing him. Draco kissed him! He asked for it! Bloody hell!
“No.” She shook her head. “The things he has said to me since then, the way he’s acted, I could never go back to him. In fact, it makes me wonder why I had married him in the first place.”
"Sorry, Jimmy, but you are sitting at my desk," he grunted out, not in the  mood to be civil at all.
Everyone had a good time chatting, enjoying the food and drinks. Harry and Draco bid them goodnight after ringing in the New Year. They started it as they intended to go on, between the sheets.
Harry hated to break up their fun, but it was almost tea time and they really needed to get back home. James spotted him first and got off the trampoline. Narcissa also stopped the swing and Lucius rose from his seat. Harry stepped to the threesome in heavy discussion and told the boys to say their goodbyes. The Potter family was sad to leave Malfoy Manor, but they all Floed home eventually.
Hermione took her time gathering her thoughts. Malfoy tended to rattle everyone and she had grown so unused to communicating with anyone who wasn’t family. She had been too busy with trying to be the perfect wife and mother.
"I like being here. It's such a beautiful place," Harry said, when he realised he had been staring for a while.
He looked up, having realised that his mind had wondered far away. The others were staring at him and he desperately tried to think of something else to talk about. He wasn't comfortable about discussing his marriage with them. Hermione's marriage had failed and Draco's was never really supposed to work.
"There was. However, they were made up of ward vines and the Ministry had Father destroy them. They are a sort of a dark plant. I'm glad, though, I just never liked them."
"However, sometimes I do have to bear the sight of the creature!" she continued. "She is so undoubtedly common. Her parents were dentists, so she said."
"Well, for a while, I humoured Ron. I accepted his proposal, but told him that I wanted a long engagement. He could visit me at my apartment, and we wouldn't have to put up with all the ruckus at the Burrow."
Harry quickly retrieved all the kids from school as planned and hurried home with them. He was glad to see that his wife had not made it home yet. The kids went right up to their rooms, since the two boys had homework. Of course, as always, Albus was eager to start, but James needed a little push to get on with it. Lily wanted to play with her dolls a bit, but Harry knew that soon she would be down, chatting with him as she always did.
The children were very happy with their presents and wanted to enjoy them straight away, but Harry told them that they needed to have breakfast first. They grudgingly settled down at the table and ate their fill. Harry looked around and thought of Hermione. It was her first Christmas without her children and she must have been devastated. He hoped that it was going to be her last.
He knew what he had to do. Draco had instructed him that when a new member was introduced, he would stand in the middle of the great circular hall and after some words he would need to take a seat. As he waited, he saw both Draco and Arthur gazing at him with an empty seat beside them. It struck him how he still had a choice, which wasn't really a choice at all.
"That's from an ancient temple. There are many around the city, often made a part of monuments like this."
“I’m the deciding vote!” he shouted as he realised. Two votes meant that he would decide everything. “It’s simple, Malfoy. I take back my votes and change the law.” He grinned at Hermione and his eyes shined.
The day came and all of their friends crowded into their tiny living room and kitchen. Harry cooked a lovely ham. Draco got some noisemakers and they were spinning them freely. Harry decided to make a toast.
"We have to walk down to the entrance of the hill, but you can already see some things to your left." Draco pointed, looking like almost a professional.
Draco had changed the most. Even on the outside, his hair was not so slicked back anymore, and of course, he had the body and face of a grown man. Even so, he was still slim and frail looking, obviously taking after his mother in that regard rather than his father. He dressed very well and Harry had seen him on
"I think it's a great idea, Harry!" Ron patted his shoulder as he sat down on his right. "You're just not tough enough to be an Auror. I know you can take down the bad guys and all, but sometimes you're just too nice." He erupted into a roaring laughter at that.
Harry knew that he was just playing with him at that point. He laughed and got up with the intent of finding the bathroom. Draco also got up and pulled the nearest curtains apart. Light flooded the room and Harry could see that they were in an enormous bedroom. He walked up to the first door and found a walk-in closet behind it. It was filled with robes and shoes. Draco's bedroom then.
"I can be your wife," he said, in heavily accented English. "I can be anything you want, mister. Don't need much money, very cheap, for a handsome man like you."
At one o'clock they were both standing before the fire in the living-room and the fire changed to green to signal that the Floo was being used. A second later Draco Malfoy regally stepped out, his pale blue robes flaring out behind him. He would have made Snape proud.
"It will be harder for you now, though. Wish you had made the discovery a few months ago. Keeping the children with you would have been easier," Draco stated.
"I'm sure this year is much better. Look, I made breakfast!" At Harry's raised eyebrow Draco blushed, and quickly corrected his statement. "Okay, the house-elves made it, and I brought it up. I thought we could have a nice breakfast together, and face the kids afterwards."
Faye really loved this chapter, though she liked the next one more. Icicle, my harshest critic. Again, those blasted comas!
"All right." Harry was glad that he had suspected that in some foreign countries the American money would be more appreciated than their local one.
"The Dark Families want to keep the separation, which is partly why they used to be all for total separation, not even allowing Muggle-borns in. However, the newer generation - our generation has realised that a Muggle-born in the bloodline doesn't dilute it, because the magic is still strong. Regrettably, that had been the misconception in the past. Remember, the Dark Lord had been a half-blood, so are you, Potter, and Severus Snape was as well. These examples have led to new studies being conducted that have found that Muggle-borns are born when generations of suppressed magic combines in a person, manifesting itself in a great burst. Apparently, all Muggles have a limited amount of magic in them, so no one is completely without magic." He seemed very excited at that point, his grey eyes were shining almost to the point of twinkling.
"There is no Wizengamot meeting this week, remember? That was why you picked last Saturday to go to Thailand. No courts either. Do you want to get the divorce on the way? There may be no courts, but we can still get the ball rolling."
"So you found out that it's all right to marry Muggle-borns?" Harry directed the conversation back to the previous topic. They still had a lot to cover.
"I have put away a couple of things for your young prodigy. I know how much he loves potions. We have a new book by Nocer Picard. I remember your son saying how much he enjoyed his last book." He pulled out a rather large volume.
"Harry, believe me, you can know from a kiss. Sure, it was a bit strange at first, but it felt right. The things I've done since then just confirmed it." Draco finished his glass too and refilled.
He cast a couple of strong Warming Charms on himself and went outside in his robes as he was. He thought that perhaps a bit of fresh air would help clear his head of the alcohol. He had drunk a bit too much champagne.
The place was clearly designed with girls in mind and followed the fairies theme to the letter. Most of the things around them were pink. Pink walls with flowers blossoming on the paper, darker pink soft carpeting under their feet that they could enjoy once they took off their shoes at the door according to the policy. As always, little girls were running about and the shopkeepers looked on with amusement. They probably cast Unbreakable Charms every day, as most of their merchandise would have suffered in their absence.
“No thank you. Let’s get to business, shall we?” he suggested. The other two people nodded. “As I understand, Hermione would like to divorce her husband, finally, and keep her children as well.”
"Probably some Death Eater scum. We should have rounded up everyone with a Mark at the end of the war. Less trash lining the streets," he voiced one of his opinions that was oft heard by everyone around him.
"Draco, I don't want to talk about politics. You know I don't care for that stuff," the man said dismissively. "What I'm really interested in is when we can go back to your house for some fun."
Once they had a plan and Harry was full with tea and sandwiches, he stood to find his children. The house-elf they called informed them that Hermione was with the children in the indoor pool. Harry was led there and when he stepped in, the architect of Malfoy Manor didn't disappoint once more.
"Hermione, I've been thinking," he began. "We should get you a solicitor, to help with the divorce and getting custody of Rose and Hugo."
"That is fine, young man. However, if your wife leads you so easily, then how can you hope to lead Our World?" Mr. Milder asked pointedly.
Of course, round two had to wait until morning, when Harry woke to Draco swallowing him whole, proclaiming that he had rested long enough, and it was time to fuck him again. Draco was really a pushy bottom, but Harry didn't mind.
“The Wizengamot members don’t get paid. It’s a position of honour, not a job. Honestly. No wonder Weasley holds your positions for you,” he said in a huff.
He left it though, and sucked on his own finger to lubricate it. Then he inserted one into Draco's opening, returning his mouth to its previous task. The sounds above him got even louder. He knew Draco just loved being stimulated on both sides. He glanced up to see the wanton look on the beautiful face above him, and the other man had one of his fingers in his own mouth, lightly sucking at it. Harry thought of turning around to give him something else to suck on, but he wouldn't have been able to last that way for what they wanted to do. Next time.
"I don't know, Draco. The only real relationship I've ever been in was with Ginny, and apparently, for the most part, that wasn't real either. Not to mention, you're a man!"
"Aw, little potty was left by his pet weasel?" Malfoy said in a mocking  tone. "What could have ever happened to break the Golden Trio apart? Or  maybe you got promoted over him?"
"It's so calm and peaceful here. You know Ron and the Weasleys. Always loud, shouting, screaming, and making noise. It gets a bit much after a while and I never had a place to escape from it all. I miss my children, but for the first time in a long while I can just sit and read. Draco teaches me a lot about the Wizarding world and the etiquette, so does Narcissa and sometimes even Astoria joins in. Narcissa is such a lovely woman. Sometimes she reminds me of my own mother," she sighed; she could never get over not being able to reverse her own Obliviate.
"I know. I want your opinion," Harry raised his voice, the alcohol boosting his Gryffindor brashness.
Throughout the initial planning phase Harry had arrived to the realisation that this wasn't just about Hermione. In fact, it wasn't just about her divorce for Hermione either. It was about every woman. As much as he didn't like to think about it, some day it was going to be about his daughter, Lily as well. She may end up in a marriage one day that she would not like to stay in and have to make the kind of decision Hermione was faced with. It was like what happened in the Muggle world and what was still needed to happen in some countries. They were doing something really important. They were giving women what they were entitled to, and that was equal rights under the eyes of the law.
Most of the rooms were of course unremarkable sitting rooms. Harry wondered about why great houses tended to have so many, but couldn't really come up with an answer. Perhaps it was just a way of occupying space on the ground floor that was needed for the bedrooms above.
"I've wanted one of these for a while," he remarked, and headed towards the accessories section. In the end they left with a lot of gadgets, as they needed a computer and a couple of other things as well. Harry had no idea how to work a computer, as he was never let near Dudley's, and after he left Hogwarts he never needed one. Draco was confident, that they would figure it out, and if not, they would just find someone to teach them.
"Though don't expect a lot," the blond explained. "Because of their distaste for the Vatican, and the restrictive Roman wizarding government, most Italian wizards just have a house there, and not actually live there. Their version of wizarding Rome is tiny."
"Actually, his name is Albus Severus. I named him after the two greatest headmasters Hogwarts has ever known," he clarified.
"Oh, so that's what you thought? No. I was famous myself. After all, I'm a Malfoy. I was fascinated by you, Harry. You destroyed the Dark Lord as a baby. Father said you had to be a wizard with great potential. I wanted to be near that. However, I had some other reasons as well, but those are a bit too personal," he revealed.
"Don't you think we make the perfect couple? Just like they did," she remarked as she gazed at the two of them in the mirror.
He asked for his trunk and changed in the bathroom once more. The receptionist seemed puzzled at his changed attire when he returned but didn't comment on it. He dressed casually, as he assumed that most people didn't dress up for the nightlife around there. He got a map of the city that highlighted some of the hotspots and left the hotel again.
He leaned down to kiss Draco. It was sloppy and full of desire, but being inside his boyfriend on both ends felt incredible. He then stayed on top of him, just rocking his hips slowly, wanting the experience to last. However, he couldn't keep up the languid pace for long, and soon found himself grasping Draco's raised knees as he slammed into him. He was slightly afraid of hurting the blond, but he would have complained if he did. Instead, Draco just kept on moaning and urging him in a breathless voice to go deeper, harder, enjoying the slightly rough treatment. Harry filed away that knowledge to future use. Soon though, his mind was completely focused on his task, and he felt his orgasm approaching. He grasped the cock before him, forcing his own tide back, wanting to make Draco come first. He didn't have to pump the shaft for long, and Draco was soon shouting under him, coating his hand with his fluid. Harry felt the muscles that surrounded his own cock contract, and let himself go, let the tide overtake him with all of its force. He moaned long as he pumped all his come into the hole, only pulling out once he was all done.
"You did at Madam Malkin's. You had clothes that were too big for you and old, awful glasses, hair that hadn't been cut properly ever." He paused for a moment, looking pensive. "I'll never forget that day."
Harry tried to reassure the other young man, but it was difficult to keep his spirits up. It was especially difficult, since he was so happy in his new career. Sure, it was just mostly writing small articles for a paper, just fillers really, but it got his creativity going. In his spare time he would work on short stories, trying to hone his craft.
"Pleased to meet you, sir, my name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy," he said proudly and shook the man's hand with all his might.
"Yes. Could you help me? I need to find this place." He pulled out the paper on which he had scribbled the name of the hotel, as on the other side he had jotted down the address of the Floo office.
"It's some kind of a mediwizard. I wasn't really interested beyond that, I was just trying to fill in an awkward silence one time when I couldn't help being alone with her. She's so ugly too! Ah! I don't want to talk about her anymore! Primrose, who made your costume? That stitching is absolutely divine!" She changed the subject.
"It was nice seeing you, Scorpius," he said, as a way of farewell, and then hurried to catch up with the older blond.
Hermione got up and poured some water for him from a pitcher on a side-table. She was frowning though, obviously wanting to say something on the matters that had been revealed to them.
They were seated right next to the bar, and Harry was worried about the potential noise. Luckily Draco didn’t seem to mind.
He approached the group and he was allowed to go near them. Finally, he stood beside his brother-in-law and had the opportunity to put a hand on his shoulder.
"Oh, you think I can't explain that away? 'My husband couldn't satisfy me'," she began in a whining voice. "'He shuddered every time he touched me. Now that he's living with Draco Malfoy, it's obvious why.' That is what I'm going to say." Malice gleamed in her eyes as she glared at him.
"Yes, Mr Potter. Albus Dumbledore, your guardian has primary ownership of your vault until you graduate at Hogwarts and he's set a limit of 50 Galleons a year gold withdrawal."
Harry knew she was angry with him, so he left her alone and went to talk to  Hermione. She was sitting on her bed in the guest room, her eyes sad, almost  crying. The dark-haired man sat down next to her and put a comforting arm  around her shoulder.
He wrote a quick missive to Arthur and then saw the kids off to their respective schools. As he was heading home, he received a reply from his father-in-law that they could meet that evening. He was glad that he had a bit of time until then as he found a secluded spot behind a tree in the remote area where the boys' school was and put on his invisibility cloak. Taking care to not lose it he Apparated.
"Wonderful idea, Gin. It will be a costume event, therefore, be careful in choosing who you're going to dress as," he advised.
"They are fairly new inventions. I just read about them in a magazine. A Muggle-born is behind them. Very clever."
"Interesting." Harry supposed that in the Potions circles probably many people knew Snape and admired him. The man was brilliant; after all, he made the Wolfsbane Potion.
"I aim to entertain," answered Malfoy. "You are right, though. It is rather boring. However, it's a great opportunity to show Hermione around. I just loved some of the faces when they spotted her among us."
"I have to go home, Hermione. I'd love to chat, but I don't want to be too long in case Ginny starts to wonder." Harry was sad to go, but it was time.
Once the elf had disappeared, Harry sat down on his ornate couch, a piece Ginny insisted on, and waited for Ron to appear. He was sure that once Hermione told the redhead the bad news, he would immediately Floo Harry. He was debating whether to tell Ron about knowing of the situation before he did, but he knew that he was a terrible liar and it would be no use trying to hide things from his best friend. So when the flames changed to green and a disgruntled
"Best Dressed" list often. Not that he read the magazine, but Ginny sometimes pointed it out that he was never on it and that he should make more of an effort. She was always striving to get on their list for witches, but for some reason, never made it. She was even among the "Worst Dressed" a couple of times. Harry didn't know why, but then again, he knew nothing about fashion, which Draco obviously knew a lot about. For the most part, Draco lived a quiet life, much like his father, and didn't seem to be particularly vocal about his politics during social events. Harry assumed that is was because of his oppressed status in the Wizengamot. Perhaps it would change later on. If Draco was anything, it was politically savvy.
“Look, I haven’t slept with anyone else. The Malfoys helped me, because I help them along with Harry in their endeavours to make their side strong again. I have always been faithful to you. You didn’t need to give me the potion in the first place. Sure, I didn’t want to settle down right away, I wanted to find my own way in the world first, but we could have progressed our relationship to marriage slowly. If it didn’t work out, then we could have parted ways and stayed friends.”
New Year’s had barely passed, and Valentine’s Day was quickly approaching. Harry knew that in the Wizarding World they didn’t really celebrate it. The only time they had it at Hogwarts was when Lockhart insisted on it. However, they were living in the Muggle world, and Harry wanted to have a fun evening. So he made sure with the agent of Draco’s band that they had a clear schedule that night. It was easy enough as the band usually played upbeat songs.
"About a month into the diet I started to feel more energised. I played with the kids more, but that didn't satisfy me anymore. So I brought out some of my old books and got to reading again. I haven't read anything but brainless novels for such a long time! It was like I had been sleeping for so long and just woke up. I tried to talk to Ron about it." She shook her head, signalling how well that talk went. "I told him that I wanted to go back to studying and become a healer. I have secretly thought of doing that since second year, but he told me he wanted more kids. I don't, Harry. I love them, but two is enough. Ron just ignored me and said that Weasleys always had big families, so we would too. As if my opinion didn't matter!" She was clearly distraught over the matter. "Then I realised I haven't had an opinion about anything, or contradicted him since the war."
"They will need to get to know you more. I'm sure once they do they will have no doubt in their minds about just how suitable you are." Arthur smiled proudly at what he said.
Harry was startled at her remark. He would have expected her to say something along the lines of how the house-elves could take a break.
“Such a lovely speech, Potter,” he said, changing his tone to the way he used to say it. Then he grinned. “I’m not going to be out-romanced by you!”
Harry raised his head, and gently kissed Draco. It didn't turn passionate, just a sweet and comforting kiss.
Draco just patted his hand on the table, and discussed what they were going to eat with the handsome dark skinned waiter. Harry thought he was just a bit too smiling, but said nothing.
Once the tree was done, they turned on the lights and marvelled at what they had done together. They sang a little Christmas song and then opened a few presents. Draco hadn’t completely forgotten the holiday and had some packages for Harry as well. Though he was the happiest with a beautiful red rose he got from Harry. After that Harry playfully pulled out a mistletoe, and Draco laughed at how corny it was.
Harry nodded his thanks, the movement rattling his head enough to produce a bout of dizziness. As he gathered himself and started to walk away, he could feel grey eyes following him.
"Thank you for all your help, Arthur." He sincerely thanked the man, but couldn't help thinking that this was the last time they were going to have a pleasant exchange.
They boarded the flight ahead of a long queue. The other passengers grumbled a bit, but they had first class tickets. Harry sat down in the very comfortable seat next to Draco, and accepted the complementary Champagne. He just hoped that the combination of whiskey and Champagne wouldn't make him sick. They were instructed to fasten their seatbelts, and then the emergency guidelines were shown. As the plane smoothly started to move, Harry could feel the drunken butterflies in his stomach sloshing about in the alcohol. He sincerely hoped he wouldn't vomit. The plane taxied to the end of the long runway, and paused. Harry felt a hand on his, and turned from the window to see Draco smiling at him. Harry held the hand tighter.
6am saw Harry out of his bed already. He had tossed and turned through most of the night. The changes to his life were weighing heavily on him and he suspected he couldn't go on too much longer like that. He tried to read, but his mind couldn't be occupied by the struggle of Katniss. The book was supposed to be a big hit in the Muggle world, but he just couldn't pay attention to it.
"Hi," answered a shy voice and the child stepped out from the safety of the furniture. He put his hands behind his back and then looked up at the man before him.
"Good day, Mr. Potter!" he said in a jovial tone and it took all of Harry's willpower not to gape at the man. He had never heard two pleasant words from him.
"I know, it said so in the first book. The author wished to pay homage to the great war hero and Potions master, Severus Snape," Mr Blotts informed him.
Still, as he thought over just what Ron had said, he wondered a bit about just what Ron had done to get Hermione that had been such a grand effort. He couldn't remember anything special.
"Yes. Today. As I was standing there, looking at the couples. I'm going to go to Thailand, spend some time with my wife. A second honeymoon. Try to fix things. To find the woman I married. She's my wife, dammit!" Harry swore uncharacteristically. It startled Draco.
"Not yet, Mr Blotts, but I was sure that we could find something for him here for Christmas," Harry informed him.
"Of course, it's not as easy as me just giving you the seats, son," Arthur began to explain. "I would love to hand them over, but I'm afraid that the law doesn't allow for that."
"Believe me, I can't do more than pull you off at the moment." He reached down and took the darker cock into his hand.
They were both relieved to see them do as instructed, but as they cleared out the Weasley family became visible behind them. Harry thought Draco would leave him at that point, but instead they walked towards them together.
"Yes. Those three are really worth all what you had gone through. I feel the same way about Scorpius."
"Maybe, Harry. However, I'm sure the potion itself is not illegal. What its use will mean in court, we can discuss with the solicitor."
"Agenda number thirteen," the scribe read out. "Mr Malfoy's and Mr Potter's proposal for reforming Family law in the Wizarding world. This mainly includes rights of the wife in a marriage and the allocation of children upon the occasion of a divorce."
The Thai boy had been right. He really was gay. What they had done aroused and excited him more than anything he had ever done sexually before. He wanted Draco. He really had always wanted Draco. And he was mucking it all up. However, he was afraid of what the future had in store for his children. A messy divorce would be bad for them, too. In spite of everything, they loved their mum. He buried his head in his hands and groaned. He had woken up, but his life had become so much more complicated.
"Harry, I couldn't sleep! That Bitch! With Malfoy of all blokes! She's probably shagging both of them!" He sprang up to pace around; he could never stay sit while ranting.
The food was wonderful as well. A light winter salad from greenhouse vegetables for starters. Draco revealed that they actually had several greenhouses further out on their land for producing food all around the year. The Manor was almost completely self-sustaining with gardens and livestock. The wine they were drinking was from the Malfoy wineries, but those were in Bordeaux, France. They were even sold under the label ‘Malfoy Apothecaries' as red wine had very good healing properties.
“I know.” Ron grinned wickedly. “That is why I’m keeping them. If she loves them so much, she will submit to me, like a wife should. Look at my mother. She gave my father seven children and only once we were all grown up did she venture out on her own. Of course, even now she takes care of the house same as ever.”
“I see,” Malfoy said, nodding to himself. “If he came here and told you that he had changed his mind and he will allow you to do all that, would you go back to him?”
"Oh, Harry! We heard what happened in the Leaky today!" Ginny cried and stepped towards her husband to put her hands on his arms.
"True. Old habit. I didn't like you much in school, plus I always did like to rile you up a bit. The only thing I miss about the Weasel not being around is that he looked so funny when his face turned the same colour as his hair." They actually shared a smile over that image.
Harry was amazed at just how naturally Draco fit in. While other wizards often wore ridiculous clothes in the Muggle world, Draco had on a pair of simple dark blue jeans with a white T-shirt and a leather jacket. Harry found it very hard not to stare at Draco's behind in those sinfully tight trousers. Why he insisted on wearing something tight all the time was beyond Harry. Though the smirk on Draco's face probably indicated that he just loved to play with Harry, and show off his assets.
"No, just ignore them," Draco said, enveloping him in a hug. "I know that this is strange for you, and that Muggles have issues with this, but you have lived your life according to what others wanted of you long enough," he whispered.
"It's the handsome mister!" came a voice from beside him and he had to look down to see the boy from the club. Apparently, he hadn't found another handsome mister so far.
"Oh my, Harry!" she exclaimed as she placed the box on the bed and took out the long, gold chain to examine the teardrop ruby at the end of it. "I love it! I'll wear it for the next ball we attend!"
"I think this is the nicest Arch of all of them," Harry said, looking at the lavish decorations. He especially liked the men in togas.
Wizarding world for centuries. So once Herm declares her intention to divorce me, I am no longer responsible for her. She will not be entitled to anything that is mine. Not my house, money, or my children.”
"Great, Malfoy. Very Slytherin and such plans are just what we need right now. No one would suspect the two of us actually working together," he admitted, forcing himself to concentrate on the conversation.
Harry didn't even have to look at the menu, he always had the same thing: beef Wellington, mash and carrots. Hermione on the other hand took her time and ordered grilled chicken with vegetables. Soon they were both eating, though Hermione seemed to be more preoccupied with her thoughts, than her food.
"Good. If you would have said you were doing this because we're all friends now, I would not have believed you," Hermione confessed.
“Well, during sixth year, when you were supposedly going out with Ginny, you spent more time stalking Malfoy. You always had something other than girls keeping you occupied when other boys had nothing but them on their minds,” she pointed out. She had apparently decided to occupy her mind with something other than her own problems.
"That's because you hardly use any magic as it is. There are rules like no Apparition, no Legilimency, no appearance altering magics.  Also, Rome is so ancient, the site has natural magic dampeners. Though some say it may be a curse. Anyway, spells seem to falter or just not work in most areas of the city.  House-elves are forbidden, but they refuse to stay long anyway. They are hurt by the dampeners."
Everyone nodded enthusiastically and he was shown the swimwear closet. Harry changed and was soon in the water, his worries forgotten for the time being.
"Of course not, you git. Glad you no longer hold that illusion. You have to win them. True, you are the Boy Who Lived, but your recent actions had not endeared you to the Light Families' hearts."
Harry moaned, and closing his eyes, let him enjoy the moment. It didn't take much, and his cum joined the pool that was gathering between them from their activities.
I suppose you must be very busy now, being a big politician and everything, since you haven't written to me. Or maybe you're afraid of what I think? I get The Prophet
?” He calmed instantly, but a perplexed look stayed on his face. “You have the Black and the Potter vote. It’s what sways the whole establishment to the side of the Light Families. Luckily many of the Darker Families managed to keep their positions by foreign relatives moving into the country and taking their place, but the Black vote was lost as you inherited it. That gave more advantage to the Light Families, when before they were only ahead by one vote.”
"Yeah, it was." Harry felt that there was something wrong with that memory though. As if he was missing something. He closed his eyes in an effort to delve deeper into his memories.
"That's okay, we have swimming costumes in all sizes for guests. For girls too," Scorpius revealed, much to the delight of the threesome standing before him.
Off she went, to plant herself in Draco’s lap, who grinned at her, apparently glad that she liked him. She gave him a big wet kiss, then rested her head on his shoulder. The man’s arms went around her to keep her safe.
“Well, you know, I’m brilliant,” Draco said and Harry was so glad to see his old self-confidence at full force.
Harry got up and left with his head held high. At least if he studied some  law, he would be a better help to Hermione. Of course, she was probably  poring over books as well. He sat down at his desk, wondering where he was  going to get the books from, when Tyto, the Weasley family owl, landed in  front of him, carrying a familiar red envelope. With a sigh, he opened it as  he knew there was no use trying to get out of it. Just as he did it, the  voice of Molly Weasley rang out loud, deafening the whole office.
"Yes, she's staying until the divorce is final, which Ron doesn't want to be any time soon, so we do have time to carry out our plan. It is hard to lie to Ginny, but sometimes, not hard enough." He hung his head.
"Now that you're here, Harry, you can tell Ron all about my suitor yourself. Such marvellous circumstances!"
She quickly placed the necklace back and caressed it, her hand passing over the similarly shaped earrings as well.
They made their way through a corridor where already many people were milling about. Harry didn't have time to guess who they were or who they pretended to be as he was pulled along by his wife. Ginny was searching for her family. They had a quick look in the ballroom where a string quartet was playing a waltz and then stepped into the dining room, which was conveniently set up with a buffet table, a champagne table and several smaller dining-tables that could seat six people around them.
"Oh yes, I seem to recall the name myself. Though I can't see why." To Harry one Potions book was like the other. All dull and boring.
Harry understood it was ‘goodbye’ for good then. His friend had walked out on him a lot of times and Harry always wanted him to come back. However, at that moment, he did not.
"It's going to be all right, Harry." He hugged him, and the physical contact made Harry feel safe. "I'm going to be by your side all the way. I know it's going to be hard. Things are going to get messy, and the press is going to have a field day. However, you have to go through this. For your sake and for the children. In a year, this will all be behind us, and all we'll have to concentrate on is making the wizarding world a better place, and bringing our children up."
Harry frowned. He still didn't like the idea, but he had to see their point and he again had to remind himself to leave the planning to the Slytherin. He sat back down.
"Please add this to it as well." He gave the book to the witch, who nodded and headed towards the cashier. Harry followed her and looked around, searching for his wife. She was coming out of the clothes section with a fairy costume in her hand.
"You also like that I'm hassle-free. I don't want you to leave your wife, or declare me your lover in front of others. All I want is to slide into you and feel you moving beneath me. I want to touch your alabaster skin. Run my fingers down your spine and watch as I disappear inside you. I want to hear your voice cry out 'more', 'harder'. Scream as you spray your seeds all over those green silk sheets you're so fond of. Mind you, I'm fond of them too. I love how they show off your body when you lie down - legs spread, hard and waiting."
"Fascinating," said Draco. "How the Weaselette and you could produce such a child should be studied. Are you sure he's yours?"
“No,” they chorused, but James was still looking a bit surly. He had been with his mother the longest, as she only started to travel a lot after Lily’s birth. Everyone stood to leave.
They both immersed themselves in their work. Harry became a published author after he sent his fantasy book to many publishers. Draco was soon an important part of the night scene as his band got very good reviews for combining classical and rock music, thanks to Draco’s talent.
“However, I’m willing to ignore that, if you do a few things for me.” She reached into her bag next to her and drew out a stack of papers. “This is a divorce settlement. You sign it, and it’ll seem like we parted amicably. I get the children, and you can see them if you want to, but under my supervision. I won’t let you say bad things about me in front of them.”
After a few minutes walk, he did actually reach his destination and arrived to the hotel. It was actually a collection of several buildings near the beach. He walked inside and found himself in a large lobby. The reception was located all the way in the back with many pretty Thai women standing behind the long desk. He walked there and introduced himself, and then inquired about his wife.
“Your mother and I haven’t been getting along as we should. She had been going away a lot, and it just doesn’t feel like we’re really married anymore.” Harry tried to explain without including what he had seen in Thailand.
After the meeting in the pub, Harry went back to work with a heavy heart and a list of things that he couldn’t eat for Dinky. As he sat down, he looked over to the empty desk of his friend and wondered how he was going to face him in the light of what he knew. He squared his shoulders and decided to just get through the day. When Ron did finally make it back from his one and a half hour of lunch break, Harry had enough of a resolve to act relatively normal.
"They positively love you! Recently, all I keep hearing about it what a great man you've grown up to be. I'm very proud of you for deciding to go into politics. It'll make a great career for you." He beamed at the man in front of him. "Molly and I are also glad that we no longer have to be afraid of you getting hurt by a villain. We just wish Ron would take interest in a safer position as well." He sighed at that.
He hadn't heard the bathroom door open. Draco went to sit down next to him, and took his hands in his to force the other man to look at him.
“All right, Potter.” Malfoy had probably realised that that little bit of history was never taught at school and Potter obviously had no interest in politics, so he would not have found out on his own. Thus, he settled back in his really uncomfortable seating and started to tell the story: “About 300 years ago the Potters joined the Wizengamot. They took the place of the Gaunt family. The Gaunts were a Dark Family, but intermarried too much and when not a single offspring was deemed sane enough for the position, they were voted out. At the same time, through an unfortunate accident another Dark Family, the Wenlocks died out as well. The Gaunts made even and the Wenlocks were the deciding vote. However, the Potters were a Light Family and they made it even. The Abbots played both sides as they seemed neutral at the time and managed to get in as well. Only when they had the position, they declared their true alliance to the Light Families. Thus, for three hundred years, the Light Families had the deciding vote,” he finished with a flourish.
"Harry, we only have to get the kids in the evening. We have hours ‘till then. What should we do?" She arrived to stand in front of him and was already undressing him. Harry wasn't very interested, but he scolded himself internally for being a bad husband. Eventually, he followed his wife upstairs, trying to seem as eager as he should have been.
"Yes, Master. Mistress instructed Dinky to put it into Master's fruit juice every morning. When Master didn't want to drink fruit juice anymore, I couldn't put it into anything. Mistress instructed it had to be taken with sugar. Master not eat sugar anymore," the nervous house-elf revealed.
Harry was astonished to see them kiss. He had never seen two men do that and a little voice in his head told him to look away - it was clearly a very intimate moment. However, it was like watching a train wreck; he just couldn't tear his eyes away. The men kissed languidly, clearly very familiar with each other's lips. They were taking their time, enjoying the sensations if their moans were any indication. At last, Draco ended it, but smiled coyly at Adrian.
“I don’t care. She can go and whore herself on Knockturn Alley for all I care.” The redhead shrugged. “Though she’ll probably shack up with whoever she’s sleeping around with. Oi, and Harry, don’t you dare take her in!” he demanded.
He left the room and in another found an open doorway to the gardens. The night was rather cold, but he cast a heating charm and walked out into the moonlight. There were a few lamps lighting the path, but they didn't give the harsh and bright light that electric ones did. He spotted some lovely autumn roses by a wall and went to smell them. They had a strong perfume that felt heavy compared to the light scents of the season. As he was enjoying their fragrance, he heard voices coming from above him. Looking up, he spotted Draco and another man, whom he didn't know, gazing at the full moon. Harry tried to recall if he had seen him somewhere, but it was rather dark and the man had dark hair as well, just like most people, so he didn't ring any bells. However, he was delighted by the chance to do some further eavesdropping, so he plastered himself to the wall and even did a small spell to stop the twinkling of his robes.
As he arrived into the foyer of the great house, he was thankful that Draco had added him to the wards. He didn't know which way to go, so he just started to walk down a corridor. The candles lit around him as he strolled-a spell that seemed to be in use all around the house. When he opened one of the doors, he realised that it was actually Draco's office.
Harry found a toy Snitch and decided to get one for James as he often said that he wanted to follow in his parents' footsteps and become a Seeker just like them. He had completed his purchase, but Ginny was still engrossed in the conversation. He squared his shoulders and got ready to ascertain his authority as a proper husband. A month earlier, he would have just let her enjoy herself, but now he had to change.
"You know you can't promise that. I'll get you something else." He patted her hand on his arm and steered her towards Flourish and Blotts.
Lily also shuffled down, her small legs still having a bit of a hard time on the steps, but she clutched her dragon all the same. That stuffed animal was almost as big as her, but she loved dragons and that one was her favourite. She took it everywhere with her. Harry just smiled at her red head. He always tried to not think of a certain man named ‘Dragon’ when she demanded to be read a story with dragons. He sometimes wondered what Lily would think of Draco.
"Ha! You know why I never did? I didn't care. It didn't matter. It didn't matter that you kiss like a dog, slobbering all over me, or that you have no idea how to touch me. All that mattered was that it was you. Harry Potter, rich, famous and going somewhere. I got over my crush on you by the time I was fourteen. However, I wasn't going to let a great catch like you get away. So I endured it. I suffered through it. I bore you children and then I was free. I went out into the world to finally enjoy my life away from you and those brats!"
The taste of Firewhisky and something else, masculine and sweet. Silky locks in his hand. He found, to his alarm, that the memory was making him hard. That was probably the single most disturbing thing at that moment, even worse than the headache. It also drew his attention to the fact that he was only in his boxers. He tried to shake his head to clear the memory, but it only served to increase his headache. He made himself stop such a foolish action, and he attributed it to not being in his right mind. He had to find his clothes.
"How could you?" she finally spoke up and slapped her husband across the cheek. "That's my family and you just separated us from them! I always knew you were useless when it came to politics, but this is your stupidest idea so far! All you would have had to do was to vote like my father and go along with everything and we would have had a great place in society! I'm not staying in this country anymore I'm going back to Thailand!" With those words, she turned on her heel and marched off towards the lifts. Harry and Draco just watched her as she disappeared inside one.
Harry just nodded. They quickly said their goodbyes and Harry left to return to his table. Just as he sat down, their desserts arrived, cutting off the chance of any conversation. On the plate before them was a brown hill with canary yellow cream around its base. In the middle of the hill, there was a big hole. They were also given a jug and instructed to pour the liquid into the hole. As they did so, foam began to erupt from the concoction and the scent of saffron was in the air. It bubbled over the whole thing.
He looked around and had no idea where he was. He needed to get back to the Floo, but he wasn't even sure if it was open so late at night.
"Scorpius, I hope you're not boring Mr. Potter," the blond man said to his son as he came to stop next to him. Harry was again struck by how much they looked alike.
"You know what I mean. Two days ago I didn't even know I liked men. Now I want nothing but to tear your clothes off."
"That's why I found everything in my room this morning!" James spoke up. "We're still going to school though, right?"
When they got back to the house, Ginny immediately called her brother to inform him. He was livid, but she told him not to come over. Ron vowed to delay the divorce as long as possible. He assumed that they were just itching for Hermione to be free. Harry heard everything and smiled to himself at how well the plan worked.
"Alicia Morag, Witches' Weekly. How did your wife's family handle the news of you changing sides?" asked a pretty witch that Harry recognised as she regularly covered him for the WW.
That over, Harry knew it was time to sit down. First, he looked at Arthur, who patted the empty space next to him. Then he turned his head to Draco, who just looked at him, face blank. He was still leaving an opening for him after everything they had discussed. Harry was encouraged by that. He cast a last glance towards Arthur Weasley and said goodbye in his head. Then to the astonishment of everyone, he turned right, towards the Dark families and walked straight to Draco, sitting down beside him. The Head Mugwump seemed like he was going to comment, maybe tell him that he was on the wrong side, but the determination in Harry's eyes stopped him.
"Oh Harry! It's one of Draco's schemes. You see, we figured that if Ron heard that I was with a man, then he would assume that I was eager to get a divorce myself. Adrian is a great friend of Draco's and was the perfect candidate to play my anxious beau just waiting to find me single and available." She grinned and seemed most pleased with herself.
Hermione just looked at Harry for a bit, her face mirroring the astonishment she felt. To an outsider, it appeared to be caused by what her friend was saying. Yet, it was actually due to the way that he had said those things. If they had not talked it over beforehand, she would have thought his words sincere. When had Harry become such a good actor?
"Well, we first read the manual of the camera. Then there's this great quarter in Rome called Trastevere. We can have a nice dinner there. I'm assuming your stomach will need a bit of rest after the flying."
Narcissa changed a lot less, although she had never been a prominent figure. However, she seemed a lot warmer and kinder, especially whenever they came across each other. She would sometimes take his hand and squeeze it in greeting, as if she was still thanking him every time for all the things he had done for them. Harry had actually grown to like the woman from afar and hoped to forge a closer relationship in the future, after he could publicly ally himself with the family.
Teddy has been in France, attending a year at Beauxbatons. It was part of a scholarship program that the schools have set up after the war to introduce magical students to different parts of the magical world. Teddy studied well, and his scores had qualified him for the program. He didn't write often. As a teen, he was usually more occupied with chasing after girls, than writing to his ‘old' godfather. He had even spent Christmas there, and Andromeda traveled to France to be with him.
"I'm afraid they'll doubt the beginning of their existence. It may also put some of their family in jail. I know they deserve that, but Ginny is still their mother and Ron their uncle. I keep remembering the boy I met on the train. All the things we've gone through. I don't want to destroy them. I don't want revenge," he said, taking comfort from the presence behind him.
The two men got dressed, and went down to breakfast together. In the breakfast room, Hermione was just waking up with the help of some coffee. Lucius was in his dressing gown, reading
He searched for another hour when he decided to get off the streets and try his luck in another club. It was the same as every other before it with loud music and neon lights, but this one seemed to take debauchery to a new level. It had booths that people could separate from the rest of the world by drawing curtains around them. However, these were white and Harry could see the silhouettes of the people inside. He got a bit hot as he realised they were all having sex. In some of these partitions he could make out more than two people. He had only ever been with Ginny and he found himself wondering for a moment about what a threesome or moresome would be like. He shook his head. The place was getting to him. He was just about to tear his gaze from a booth where he could count about five people engaged in enjoying each other, when one of the people stopped and started to leave. As the curtain was drawn back, he came face to face with none other than his wife. She spotted him right away too and they stood staring at each other for what seemed like an eternity.
Harry just wished that they could go to sleep already. After all, the children would wake them up early in the morning.
Harry showed him the ads and Draco admitted that he could see some promising positions right away. True, they didn’t pay much, in some cases only on a gig-by-gig basis, but it was a start. The black-haired teen sat down on the couch next to his love and found his lap full in a second.
The next day Harry woke up feeling more refreshed and alert than he had in a long time. He had only been on the diet for less than two days, but it seemed to be working. Harry had so much energy that he wanted to jump out of bed, run into James' room and rouse him, then tickle Albus awake, and lastly, blow a raspberry into Lily's tummy. But they were with Ginny, he realised, and his good spirit threatened to evaporate. However, he shook himself and managed to not let that dampen his mood. He quickly got ready for the day. It was a Saturday, which meant no work, but Harry couldn't stop thinking about last night and contemplating Hermione's difficult situation.  Saturday or not, he had things to do today.
"All right, Malfoy. I understand. So, I need to get their vote. How do I make my intentions known and start the process?"
Soon after Harry's divorce the news hit the papers, along with a photo of the two of them together in a restaurant. Harry was relieved to see that they were accepted, and heralded as the new force in wizarding politics. It went a bit too smoothly perhaps, but the
“I know, Harry, still, when you are supposedly in love with the girl, you should pay more attention to her. Granted, there was  war going on, but once we went back for eighth year, I was hoping that you would be more passionate with Ginny. Instead, I saw a reluctance in you. Like … like you were forcing yourself to be with her,” she said as she let go of him to look into his eyes.
"We know why." Harry felt it was his place to tell her about what had really happened. "You were being dosed with a potion."
Once Harry was at a safe distance, he stepped on the path again, letting the gravel make sounds under his feet. His thoughts were still on the blond man. He was obviously interested in men, so why did he marry Astoria? Then he remembered that Draco talked about how they were arranged to be married as toddlers. Also, it was possible that he was not only interested in men, but women as well. It wasn't that unheard of, even in the Muggle world.
'With a much better reception too,' he thought as he looked upon Draco's smiling face and grinned back at him.
Harry huffed a little, but knew he couldn't do anything about it, so he took  the box and placed inside his picture of Ginny and the kids, his clock,  quills and parchments. He almost took his files as well, until he remembered  that he was off all the cases.
"Maybe my divorce made her realise that she should put more effort into her marriage. Maybe, she's afraid of losing you," she suggested.
"Great? Sure, he's pretty decent, but I wouldn't call him 'great'. You surely didn't fall in love with him now?" he suggested.
"Yes, Mr Potter. This way." He turned with a grin at the promised play date and started to walk away in a measured pace.
Harry realised that the discovery he had just hear about had opened new dialogues among the purebloods. He also feared that it could give new reasons to fight about in their world, but he hoped that this time they would be limited to the debate table and not escalate into drawing wands over it. At that moment he decided that he would do everything to keep that from happening.
Harry just laughed and stepped out the door while waving goodbye. He almost skipped down the way to the gates, but still managed to put his invisibility cloak on once he neared it. Perhaps, the Malfoy family was even better than he had imagined.
He felt lips on his. Thin but not too thin. More forceful than Ginny ever tried. They moved over his, and then pried them apart to plunge a tongue between his teeth.
"Harry, I couldn't find your trunk and your clothes were filthy. I found you some robes that are a bit bigger and may fit you,' Draco instructed as he went to execute his own morning ritual.
"Years ago." Harry fell silent for a while, silently asking himself the same question. When had he surrendered his own wants and desires to that of Ginny? "It all seems a bit hazy now. I got back with Ginny right after the War. During that hellish year, all I could think about was her and how after it was all over, I could be with her. She felt like home. The Burrow was the warmest and safest place I've ever known and she was a piece of it. So I was with her during that supplementary year. You didn't attend, as I recall, you finished your schooling at home." Draco just silently nodded. "We sat for our NEWTs. Ginny was supposed to finish a year later, but she studied hard and could sit for the NEWTs with us. After school I moved to the Burrow. I proposed to Ginny as I was afraid that the Weasleys wouldn't let me stay in her room otherwise. We soon joined the Auror programme and Ginny played Quidditch. We got married in
"I got into a band! You were right! I'm going to be a professional musician!" he shouted and soon was snogging his partner.
Harry sat in the uncomfortable couch in his living room. He took a sip from his cup of mulled wine as he was looking at the large Christmas tree and got lost in the events of the past year. It was hard to believe that the next day was Christmas morning already.
"Yes! It's a day when people celebrate love and relationships. I got us a table for the occasion," Harry was very excited.
“What if we changed the law?” Hermione asked. Harry almost smiled; his best friend was still the revolutionary that she had been in school.
In the coming hour Harry shook more hands than ever before in his life. Arthur introduced him to everyone important, not just Wizengamot members, but Ministry officials as well. Harry had worked at the Ministry for some years, but he had never even seen half of these people. Granted, when at work he was either in the Auror Department, or out on the field, so he never got the chance to do much mingling. He was mostly of the opinion that the workplace was for work, not for socialising. However, it seemed like his prospective job was more about mingling than actual work. He tried to memorise the faces and names, but after a while it was all just a blur. He smiled at everyone, remarked on the brilliance of their costumes, kissed the hands of the ladies, and was generally trying to make a good impression. He did tire though and told Arthur that he would go and find Ginny, because she would be cross with him if he didn't take a turn with her on the dance-floor. He had gotten slightly better at dancing since the Yule Ball, at least enough to not embarrass himself. Arthur stayed with an old colleague and waved him away.
"Okay, but this is the last one." Draco complied. He didn't want Harry to pour anyway. He was afraid he'd break the crystal.
Harry just pointed at the bottle, still remarkably full. Draco drank down what he had, poured, drank, poured again, and once finished with that, put the glass down.
"Of course I am. I wouldn't have brought it up otherwise. I'll write him a letter after lunch. Have you ever been to Rome?"
After breakfast, they had a look at the shops. Harry spied some digital cameras, and wished he could get one.
Harry swallowed, and lay down on top of the blond to kiss him. He felt the other man's erection through the confines of his boxer shorts, and a flash of desire to touch it and lick it shot through him. He kissed along the long, elegant neck, nipping in places, but trying not to leave a mark. Draco appeared to be very sensitive there as he was keening already. He tasted like vanilla and strawberry, which was just perfect. Harry teased the flat nipples with his tongue, filing away for later that his partner liked that as well. He was in no rush, he wanted his first time exploring a male body to be thorough. As he mapped out every little scar on the beautiful torso, he took note of when the other's breath hitched, when it didn't. He also tried not to dwell on the slightly raised scars he knew were the remains of his Sectumsempra.
Draco woke up and found that Harry had disappeared from his bed. For a moment he panicked. Did Harry decide that he was a crappy lover and left him to find someone better? Was his cock too small? He frowned at his own stupid self-doubt. Harry came three times last night and otherwise made unmistakable sounds of pleasure. Also, Draco was hardly a virgin and from experience knew that his cock was in fact on the large side.
"Well, it's quite simple. Now we are all allies in reinstating the Dark Families as the leaders of the Wizengamot. You have your agenda, and I have mine, but we all want the same thing eventually. Since Potter can't be seen helping you, it has to be me. No one would believe that the three of us are working on this together. Also, it would help me promote the integration of Muggle-borns into Wizarding society. I could even make an example of you by teaching you how to be a proper witch, not just a magic-user," Malfoy finished, grinning by the end at all the benefits the situation would bring to him.
“Yes. You are their father. They need you, but you have to be a good father. You can’t expect your children to love you because they are biologically connected to you. You have to love them and care for them. You also have to respect their mother.
"Members of the Wizengamot," began the Chief Warlock, "today we have the rare and pleasurable task of welcoming a new member amongst us. Harry Potter will be taking over the Potter and the Black votes from Arthur Weasley, who had been safeguarding them for him. Harry Potter," he looked straight at the young man, "please repeat the oath after me."
"I'm sure that the kids love you no matter what," Draco injected in what Harry thought to be an unusual show of support. Hermione wasn't surprised by it though and only smiled at the man.
"Thank you, sir ... I mean, Bart." Harry also got up and watched as the man went back towards the ballroom.
He set the Weasley album aside and his gaze fell on the white wedding scrapbook that Ginny had made. He opened it and the sights and sounds from that day rushed to him. There was a white ribbon from her hair, a napkin from their table and many pictures. He had been so happy that day. They were starting their lives together. It was the beginning of his true life, like The War had never happened. How wrong he had been. For him, the fight was just starting. Then there was Ginny. She had just packed up and left. She had hardly said two words after leaving the Ministry. Harry had to confess that he didn't miss her. What he missed was the promise of his wedding day. They were supposed to walk down the road of life together, side by side as allies. The woman who was beside him was not the one he wanted to spend his life with that day. Or perhaps she was and he had changed? He couldn't decide.
Harry found deep blue robes and white trousers on the bed. It was a colour combination he would have never worn. All his trousers were black or brown and he tended to stay away from blue as well. Except for a pair of Muggle jeans he bought for comfort. He put on the clothes and was glad to find that they did actually fit him. He found a triple mirror in one corner and gazed at his reflection.
"Yes, yes. I've heard that she had been away a lot these past few years and that is probably why you haven't had a child these past years."
"We both have children, Hermione. If this gets out, how will they react? On the one hand the press will tear everything apart. On the other hand, maybe they'll think we never wanted them..." Harry was surprised by what he said, but as soon as it came out, he realised that it's what was underneath the surface of his thoughts.
“Draco, this is our first Valentine’s Day together, but the first of many. This day is about celebrating love and romance. Before you came into my life, I had no idea of what romantic love was really like. How it makes every day that I can spend with you so much more special. Thank you,” he ended and they drank their Merlot.
During their talk what they didn't see was that their neighbour, Summer, had crept to their curtainless window with a camcorder in hand. She was ready to hit record when the men started to make good use of the rather large couch. She didn't have long to wait.
"I heard everything," Draco said as he stepped behind Harry and slipped his arms around the other man.
That evening Hermione got her children back. She returned to the Manor with them, grinning and the happiest she had been in months. They were both in awe of the place, and enjoyed exploring it with their three friends, and their new friend, Scorpius. They were a bit suspicious of ‘Malfoy’ at first, but with the urging of the Potter children they quickly saw past the name and the things their father had taught them. Only the unbreakable charms kept the place intact for the next months as six children seemed determined to test them to their limits.
The air started to change a bit around him. He could feel a sea breeze on his face and smell the water, hear the sound of gentle waves as the traffic lessened around him. Harry got excited at seeing the water and found himself hastening towards it with renewed energy. He finally reached the beach. It was full of people. They were on lounges and under umbrellas, in the water, parachuting over the water. It was a multitude of people and all around him he could hear people speaking in the dialects of British English. The white sand was emitting heat and the sea was azure. He itched to feel both between his toes, but he didn't want to get sandy and wet before he could change into his swimming trunks. He decided to ask one of the other tourists about the hotel, and after a bit of asking around, he finally managed to get reliable instructions from a woman who actually stayed at Banthai herself. She tried to chat him up afterwards, but he quickly mentioned his wife and left.
The children could only be dragged into the house once night fell. Harry silently thanked whoever came up with Warming Charms; as without them, undoubtedly all of the kids would have gotten the cold. Even the promise of presents couldn't tear them away from their play. The bottom of the great Christmas tree in the living room was filled with packages. Everyone received a Weasley jumper, and they all quickly put them on to make the great Christmas family photo in front of the tree. Molly probably started to make them in January every year, since the family was so big with all the children, even though Charlie didn't have any, not even a wife, much to his mother's dismay, who never failed to bring it up at some point during the family gatherings. The dragon-keeper just shrugged and evaded the subject every time. The children also got a little something from their grandparents, but the adults didn't as by agreement.
The control dissolved as another disaster struck at the end of his year in Hogwarts. He was kidnapped by the latest DADA teacher, a young woman named Amethist Delacour. Dumbledork probably thought that a French woman wouldn't be a Death Eater. Well, wrong, again. He was tied to an altar, blood drawn, again, added to a potion, again, Voldemort took a bath, again, and was restored in body to his former glory. Granted, a bit older version of what Harry saw in the diary, but more healthy-looking than before.
“She loves to travel and before she never had the opportunity. I’m glad that I can provide that for her now and I’m happy to watch the kids. Of course I miss her, but as long as she’s happy, I’m happy. I don’t know where you are going with this Hermione. My marriage is a good one. I wouldn’t change anything about it.”
As you can see from the title, Harry and Draco go to Rome. I've spent a week there myself in 2011. The house they are staying in does exist. I've put up a picture of it on my Zelda of Arel Facebook page, so you can check it out. I've also put up some pictures of the works of art I mention here, and the Trastevere, which I mention. Though I was there in September.
Draco did take some time, just breathing. Harry recognised the technique as what men would use to get rid of their arousal. To his surprise and confusion, he had to do it as well because he was in a similar predicament. He couldn't understand why it happened. He reasoned that what Adrian said was so blatantly sexual, anyone would be aroused by it. He seemed to be faster at deflating than Draco, therefore, he silently crept away next to the bushes. As he looked back to take a final look at Malfoy, he could have sworn that the other man was looking right at him. Yet, he couldn't have seen him in the darkness, away from a lamp.
"What should I have told you? That Dean could make me come more in ten minutes than you could through all the years of our marriage? That you're a terrible lover? Well, I guess I told you now."
"Oh, Harry, actually, this is my desk now. Since I'm Ron's new partner, you  need to switch places with me. My old desk is over there, in the corner."  Jimmy pointed towards the desk in the darkest recess of the room. "I already  moved my stuff. Here, take the box I transported them in, I don't need it  anymore," he offered.
That night he returned home with an armful of books. It was rather unusual  for him and he almost fell out of the fireplace. It had been some time since  he learned not to stumble at the end of a Floo journey. Hermione had  volunteered to pick up the kids. She had hoped she could get a glimpse of  her own in the process as Harry's two younger ones were the same age as her  own.
"I guess I am a bit over-enthusiastic. Let's change the subject. Have you seen my kids? How are yours?"
"Well, it’s not an omelette, just scrambled eggs. You'll love them! I get compliments on them all the time." Harry sat down and started to eat.
"We'll take things slow, Harry. We won't go all the way. I just want you to relax about that. I'm just going to show you things. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, or like it's too much, let me know and I'll stop."
"Oh, it's sort of common knowledge. There had been some studies on it centuries ago, but no one bothers with it anymore. You probably want to read up on it now. I'll point you to the relevant volumes in the library."
Harry stopped, and taking his pale god's hand, he pulled him down on the bed. Soon all clothes were off Harry as well, and they both got a bit dirty. Draco complained a little about his skin drying out if they took so many baths a day, but he still joined Harry in getting clean. By the time they got a taxi to Trastevere, it was very dark and they were very hungry.
She just nodded and went to use the Floo. Harry went to Dinky to notify him that he should start lunch and once he was finished, he should put Hermione's under a stasis charm. After that, he went up to read some more. By the time he sat down to eat a delicious-looking meal of chicken and vegetables, it was already past noon. He didn't want to wait for his friend, because he wasn't sure if she had time to eat before the meeting with Malfoy.
The next day, Harry went to work with a distinct feeling of dread. By now,  Ron probably knew that Harry had taken Hermione in and he was not known for  dealing well. As he stepped inside the office, he scanned the area for the  familiar redhead. Ron was nowhere to be seen, so with a sigh, he made his  way to his own desk, edging around that of others'. He barely sat down on  his chair, when he heard the voice of his boss, who demanded that he join  him in his office. Harry cringed and scanned his mind for things he could  have done to warrant such a treatment, but he couldn't think of anything.
"Hello," Scorpius greeted with delight in his eyes. "It's too cold to be outside, but grandpa said we could be in the pool room."
Harry took the papers, and walked over to the desk in the room that he had never used before. He turned to the last page. It occurred to him to read the whole thing, but he trusted Draco. He trusted him with a lot of things. He took a quill, and signed at the bottom, marking the end of a chapter in his life. He stared at it for a while, put the quill down, and looked up at his future with a grin. Draco quickly stood, and rushed over to Harry, kissing him with all his passion.
"Bollocks. And you, letting the Malfoys get away. I don't know what you were thinking. The whole family should have been Kissed and that would have been the end of it, finally."
"The Light is wrong. I … I don't see things the way you do." Harry bit his lip. They hadn't prepared anything for this scene. They knew it was coming, but it wasn't something that they could prepare for. "Arthur, I know that you and the Light see things in a certain way. Women, family, where the wizarding world is headed, but I don't. I think like the Dark does. I swore to listen to my consciousness, to represent all the people in our world equally, but I don't think the Light does. For years, I had been blind, not seeing the subtle undertones of your way of life. When Hermione left, it was all made so apparent … even I couldn't close my eyes to it. I just had to do something. The way you treat women is not right. Many of your ideals are not right. I'm going to change it to the way it should be. All equal." Harry stopped his rant as he ran out of steam.
“Happiness is not the purpose.” Malfoy seemed irritated with her prying into his life. “We have a son and my family has an heir. That’s all that matters. She can do whatever she wants as long as she doesn’t bring a shame on my name, or a bastard in my house. I don’t care. Nevertheless, your expectations in a marriage are different. He would have never meet your expectations, even I could see that from Slytherin.”
"Yes, Arthur. I've been thinking that perhaps being an Auror is not really for me. I do have my children and Ginny to take care of and I'm not so comfortable risking my life anymore." He took a sip of his tea to gather his thoughts more. He really should have taken his time to do that instead of musing over the family of blonds. "I know that I've been terrible at politics. However, I hope to learn from you, Arthur. I understand that you have been holding my seats for me, so I request your guidance in my path."
Harry's utensils fell on his plate in a riot of noise. He stared at her with his mouth agape and she just looked down at her plate. He couldn't believe his ears.
"That's just a nasty rumour," she rebuked and wrinkled her nose. "Voldemort spread it to make us think less of Dumbledore."
Chuckling lightly, Draco freed Harry's legs and he tumbled down to the floor. He slowly got up and sat back on the bed. Malfoy handed him the potion and he gratefully gulped it down. In a second, his headache was a thing of the past and he sighed in relief.
"Too bad we can't use hexes." They both laughed at that and headed towards  the interrogation rooms.
Harry felt like he stood under a cold shower. His law-it backfired on him. A month before he could have just thrown the lying bitch on the streets. Now he was facing a court battle that would probably make all the major publication in Wizarding UK. He turned on his heel and ran out. He didn't stop. He ran down the brightly lit streets, music and the sound of people having fun a cacophony of sounds in his head. He was crying, his vision blurry, bumping into people, but he just ran until he could run no more. He stopped, leaning down and breathing heavily. It was over. His marriage was all over and if he couldn't convince a judge that he should raise his children, then they were gone too. His whole life just broke apart in front of him.
"Perhaps she went to party straight away," the woman said and he had to agree with her. He didn't know it from his wife's accounts, but apparently Patong was party central.
"Can I get my hand back now, please? My ear is still clogged, and I want to get a mint from the stewardess."
I borrowed the foods from the amazing world of molecular gastronomy. On my Facebook page I put up reference links and a video of the dessert.
Ron signed it. It was a bit of a let-down, that after so many hours with the solicitors, the changing of laws, and all the effort they have put in so that the courts would decide in their favour, it all ended in a dingy little interrogation room.
"Please, don't make me throw up, Potter. You’re seriously trying to put disgusting images into my head tonight. Besides, why would my sexuality interest you?" he looked at him puzzled.
"My parents suspected ever since I was little. However, when we had the Yule Ball, Pansy insisted on getting a goodnight kiss. It was the vilest thing I've ever done... Now when Anthony Goldstein pulled me into an alcove during that horrible seventh year, that was the highlight of the whole year." Draco remembered fondly.
Once Harry made it back to Hogwarts, mercifully virginity intact, he was ignored by Dumbledore, patched up by Poppy and blamed for the whole thing by Hermione and Ron. Harry had had enough. He stopped caring about the whole bunch, and decided to leave the Wizarding World.
“Let’s just say that I can be very persuasive. I wanted to do this for us. This way we are rid of her, and we can live our lives. Just sign on the last page.”
"All I could think about was trying to stay alive and keeping my parents alive as well." He shook his head, trying to make the memory go away.
“Let’s sit down,” the host proposed as he felt awkward just standing around. At that Malfoy took a seat in the chair and the two friends occupied the sofa that was at a 90-degree angle to the other furniture. The blond man looked around the room with obvious distaste. Harry couldn’t understand why, Ginny had tried to put into that room an opulent elegance. Frankly, he didn’t care for it much, because all the seats were rather uncomfortable, but it was what Ginny had wanted. He had thought that Malfoy would be pleased with the room at any rate.
"Harry," Draco began and ran a hand through Harry's thick hair. "I know that the loss of the Weasleys is hard on you. However, now you have me and you will always have me. I suspect we'll have our differences, but I will never abandon you. Remember, on the train, when I asked you to be my friend?"
"Yes. The knowledge is beneficial to purebloods. It addresses our concern about the magic weakening in the bloodlines. However, that is not the only reason why we're not inclined to choose Muggle-borns as spouses. Culturally the difference is rather large. You both grew up in the Muggle world and I'm sure you've had difficulties adapting to our way of life." He looked at them, seeking confirmation.
Finally, Harry arrived to his destination and gazed up at the great twin doors that led inside. He did not see a knocker or a bell, and was just starting to wonder how he would make his presence known, when they parted before him to reveal Draco standing there.
"It's Ginnnyy. She's..." Harry shook his head and took another swallow. "A liar. I believed every word!" He shouted, the alcohol getting to him. "Ginnnnyyyy. She said I'm aaawful. Terrrible. Now how was I supposed to know? It's only ever been her. Her. ... Just her." He was wavering between sadness and anger.
"From what I heard, when they're not at school, they're mostly with Molly. She's not very vocal about the situation though." Harry remembered that the last time they had lunch at The Burrow, the subject of Hermione was tactfully avoided.
Next, came phase two of their plan for the day. They had to find a way to have Hermione's path cross with that of Draco's, so in the Alley, they staged it that Hermione would accidentally run into Draco and his son on her way through the Alley. Harry on the other hand simply stood up from his seat, left a few Galleons on the table and Flooed home. All of Hermione's things had already been packed away into her old bag. Harry returned to an empty house.
The blond viewed the tree critically, then suddenly grinned and kissed the dark-haired man. They decorated the tree together. Draco pointed out that most of the decorations were red, Harry pointed out that the tree was green, and they laughed at their antics.
Harry looked at the arm first, then at the wizard standing next to him. His eyes were shining with wonder, his blond hair tousled in the slight wind that blew on the hill. He had never seen anyone so beautiful, and he leaned over to give a quick kiss on the other man's lips. Then he realised what he'd done, and looked around, a bit scared of the reaction of the people around him. Most ignored him, but a tourist couple looked at them with disgust. Harry reddened and looked away, trying to untangle himself from the embrace they have ended up in.
"You, Malfoy. I never would have thought that you would have the same problem as I did," Harry said, grinning at the other boy.
"I kind of guessed that's why she was going there. Harry, you may not know much about the world, but Patong is known for wild parties and casual sex. Men and women go there all the time to get laid. And for the record, I've never been, just heard about it. Apparently, straight and gay people can find willing bodies there equally," Draco explained.
Hermione also retreated to her room to read. That left Harry and Draco to return to Draco's rooms. Harry was a bit nervous about the discussion that he wanted to have, but he was also looking forward to it. As the door closed behind them, however, Draco slammed him against the door and snogged the breath out of him. When he came up for air, both were a bit dazed.
"I take it you don't like flying in a plane either?" Draco asked, referring to how he knew Harry disliked the Floo, Apparating and Portkeys.
The bank never closed. The goblins knew that there was money to be made all hours of the day and knew very well that some clients preferred to take their money out in the middle of the night. Thus, Harry gave his key to the goblin at five minutes past midnight.
"Pool room?" Albus perked up at the news. He didn't like most sports, but the few times they had vacationed at a beach, he had enjoyed spending time in the water.
On the morning of the ‘Great Vote' as he had taken to thinking of it, he was feeling very nervous. Just a few more hours and his life would change forever. As he stood before the mirror shaving with his wand, he was infinitely grateful for the wizard who had invented that spell. His hands were shaking so badly that he would have killed himself with anything sharp. He finished quickly and let Ginny have the bathroom.
Lily extracted herself from Draco’s lap, and she ran after her brothers to the playroom, who were being ushered out by Hermione.
Once they were done with the first stage, Draco and Harry gathered support for their bill. Harry groaned at the thought of courting wizards again for votes, but thanks to Draco he mostly just had to stand by and nod a lot. He also found that most of the Dark Families actually welcomed their idea and took little convincing. That was why in the month of February, they were already sitting in the Wizengamot, ready to vote on their joint proposal.
He first headed to the ballroom in his search for his wife. He couldn't see her there, but what he did see made him stop and stare. He saw Lucius Malfoy, as elegant as ever and dressed as Merlin. However, the strange thing about it was not the fact that one of the greatest Dark Wizard of all time wore the guise of someone so beloved by the side of the Light. The real reason for staring was the elegant woman on his arm, dancing to the waltz perfectly. It was none other than Hermione and Lucius was leading her around the ballroom to the astonishment of many people around them. She was beautiful in a green gown with purple trimmings and around the hems white smoke seemed to languidly dance to the music. Harry realised that she was dressed up as Cliodne, a druidess who cured the sick in ancient times. He remembered her from a Chocolate Frog card, because she was one of the more beautiful people on there. The smoke was also reminiscent of what she had discovered and held in her hand on the card. He couldn't remember what it actually was though. He thought that it was taking the image of a person in a very elegant way. He felt all the more self-conscious in his twinkling stars.
Harry was glad that that was over and hoped that the ringing in his ears  would stop in a few hours. His colleagues around him were looking at him  with narrowed eyes. They probably didn't like being subjected to his family  matters. He let out an exhausted sigh and left the room, deciding to go to  Flourish and Blotts to pick up a few books on Wizarding Law. He was only  gone for an hour, but when he returned he found that his desk was occupied  by another wizard, who was talking excitedly with Ron. Harry went to his  desk and dropped the books he had bought onto it with a loud bang. He knew  his face was dark, but he hadn't had the best of days and felt himself  entitled to some anger.
"A mother who hardly even looked at them. A mother who would only take them away from you to hurt you. Harry, please, for their sake, don't protect her," he pleaded.
"So do I. However, Ginny has not been around much these past years, so that may work in our favour. If we could prove her lifestyle in Thailand, it would also be good grounds for
Harry got ten dollars out of his small bag and he gave it to the boy. They said goodbye and he entered the Floo office. He was glad to see that it was still open.
"You could quickly Apparate over to Gladrags. I know Ginny is a big customer of theirs and I would pay for it. Just tell them that I sent you and I'm sure they'd put something together for you in no time." Harry hoped he had arrived at a good solution. Women and their clothes...
On the shelves many dragons stood. Some moved, some didn't as was indicated on their packaging and they ranged in size. The really large ones were on the ground though. One was about as big as Lily and Harry had a vision of that dragon taking up residence in her bed and her sleeping snuggled up to it. The thing was mostly green, with blue eyes and yellow stripes on its tail. He was sure he had found a great present and motioned for a shopkeeper.
"Still, playing in the pool is not without dangers," Harry warned. He was quite stunned by the proposal as he had not known there was a pool. He supposed in such a big home it would be matter-of-fact.
"The ultimate goal of the Dark Families is to preserve Wizarding Culture. For the Light Families it's to preserve themselves. They are willing to sacrifice our way of life in order to continue on their names. They freely intermarry with Muggle-borns and use laws to make sure that these Muggle-borns are under their thumbs. If the majority of these magic-users leave the Wizarding world, it doesn't matter to them." He paused, readying himself for what he was about to reveal. "There has even been talk of revealing our existence to the Muggles. They think that the Muggles will just accept us and move on."
Harry kept looking out. The plane was still above water. He could see the rays of the sun glisten on the waves below. He hoped they wouldn't end up as shark food. Then they were above the beach, and houses. Still no airport in sight. He was starting to get worried. At almost what seemed as the last minute, a runway appeared under them, and they touched down flawlessly, with just a slight bump. The plane slowed down rapidly, nearly coming to a full halt. Another sigh. At least Draco's hand remained untouched this time.
Their times in private were easy though. Harry found it fascinating that he hadn't realised he was gay up to that point, when he enjoyed everything that Draco's body had to offer so much. Except for letting the other man inside his body they tried everything, but the blond didn't seem to mind keeping it to touching and oral for the time being. He knew he would like the other man inside him, but the thought scared him. Draco did have more experience at gay sex though, and he knew that when the time came he would be in good hands. He also knew that Draco preferred to bottom anyway, so he expected the time for that to come sooner.
He entered the office and noticed Ron sitting in one of the chairs in front  of the desk. Greer Stewart, Head of the Auror Department, was an imposing  figure with his flaming red hair, light-green eyes and not to mention his  build. The budget didn't allow for large desks and his was as small as any  of the desks outside. Therefore, his already bulky Scottish form was made  larger in contrast. He was currently looking with a frown at Ron, who was  apparently trying to appear brave in spite of the stare. Harry admitted that  it must have been a difficult thing to do. In his Auror days Greer had been  known as a fierce interrogator. All they had to do was put him in a room  with a suspect and without saying a word, he would have the guy spilling his  guts out in thirty minutes. Harry quickly sat in the other chair, hoping  that the stare would not be directed at him as well.
Potions master. I always loved it, but I had to follow the family tradition of politics. Not that I don't love that as well. However, I became a
"I have an idea," Draco spoke up. "The potion that they must have used is an old recipe, mostly used by Light Families. You were both introduced to the potion at the Burrow. Therefore, someone there must have given the potion to you. My money would be on the older Weasleys."
Harry flushed and with all the dignity he could muster walked past the blond and into the great marble hall that he remembered. In spite of his memories, the interior of the building looked a lot brighter and more welcoming than on that day over fourteen years ago.
In his room, he again faced the dilemma of what to wear. He had taken the matter under consideration days before. It was very uncharacteristic of him, but he was going to stand beside Draco and all the impeccably dressed Dark families, so he didn't want to look like the poor orphan among them. That brought unpleasant memories back of the time when he was indeed the poor orphan. He selected forest green robes that complemented his eyes. He thought Draco would appreciate that since it was his house colour. He was already dressed by the time Ginny exited the bathroom in a cloud of expensive perfume that always made him cough.
"I'm not sending you away, Harry." Their eyes met and Harry could see something in the grey orbs that he couldn't name.
He forced himself to put away the albums and try to get some sleep. He slowly ascended the stairs up to his room and lay down in his great, lonely bed. He had been restless since the vote and hardly slept. The following day he would take the kids to Malfoy Manor for the first time. While they were supposed to play with Scorpius, the new Slythendor trio, as Draco called themselves the other day, would discuss the new family law they wanted to put through. Draco said that after they had a specific text they could bring in some influential people from among the Dark Families and present their ideas to them.
"Such beautiful things! Thank you!" With those words she placed the box on her nightstand and attacked Harry with kisses all over his body.
Harry woke to the sound of someone banging on his bedroom door. He got up quickly and ran to it. Luckily, Ginny was always a heavy sleeper and didn't rouse to the noise, but Harry didn't want to take his chances. He swung the door open and Ron almost crashed into him.
"I sent out my letters to some available positions. However, I didn't get anything back until we left school, so I had to go to the Burrow." At that point Hermione frowned. Harry recognised the sign of her memories becoming vague, just like his have. "I know I got back answers, but by then I was caught up in organising the wedding with Mrs Weasley. Then we got married a few weeks before you did, Harry. I got busy with helping Mrs Weasley around the house. She kept telling me that to be a good wife I had to learn this and that, and I was so eager to please. It's like I forgot all about my earlier plans. Why did I do that?" her face was puzzled.
Harry frowned at what she was saying. Everyone had known that he would marry Ginny. Probably even sooner than he had known himself.
"This is Draco Malfoy. We were in the same year at Hogwarts. For the longest time, I thought we would always be enemies, but now here we are." Harry smiled at that and the blond smiled back. He also greeted them as his father had.
"Gawain Weasley. He used to be the Chief Warlock about five-hundred years ago. This was his actual robe. My family has preserved it for generations," he said proudly. That explained why the robe looked so old. "He was known for being a righteous man. One of the best Chief Warlocks ever to take the position. Yes, everyone in the family is very proud of his legacy." He puffed up his chest and smiled even broader.
After that, they moved onto the woman Harry hadn't seen much of during his visits. He supposed he should have sought her out as she had been the woman to save his life.
At that moment, it hit him. Ginny was safe, comfortable, part of the Burrow, home but not love, passion, desire. When he was away, training hard, he didn't think of going home to her. He thought of going home to all of the Weasleys. About Molly's pumpkin pie and Sunday roast. Conversing with Arthur about random Muggle things. Chatting with Ron about training. He had only been together with Ginny a year and the thought of sex with her didn't raise his interest. He wasn't in love with Ginny.
The blond sighed, and sat down on one of the sofas. Harry wondered where to sit, but decided to sit in front of him, to avoid getting caught up in something physical.
“I actually play jazz in a band, but I think you could negotiate something with my agent,” the blond said, pulling out a card from his pocket. He gave a cocky grin to the manager and sauntered over to his table. Harry proudly followed.
He tried to spring out of bed, but it proved to be another foolish action for two reasons. One was that the covers were thicker and heavier to what he was used to and when he attempted to fling them aside and jump out of the bed in one motion, he miscalculated. His legs got entangled in the covers. The second reason was that the bed happened to be a lot higher than what he was used to; therefore, what he estimated to being a small step down, turned out to be much steeper. The end result was that he fell out of the bed, legs entangled in the covers on top of the bed, hit his head with a bang into the floor rug, and was hanging upside down in a very uncomfortable position. In his dizzy state of mind, he called himself many kinds of fool, but his morning trial was not over.
Harry was a bit sad to leave Rome on Sunday morning, but was also glad to see his kids again. He had sent them an owl with some of the pictures, also talked through the Floo, but it just wasn’t the same. Therefore, when he was bombarded by three bodies upon entering the Manor, he was beyond happy.
When they were both exhausted, Ginny turned to him as was usual for their Christmas evening ritual. She had her own present for him. Harry eyed the small package and wondered what it was going to be. Before, she would usually have an exotic decorative piece for him, as if to say that she had thought of him while away. When he opened it, it was indeed a decorative thing, but in this case it happened to be a golden 'W' pin with what appeared to be gemstones covering it. It glittered in the candlelight and Harry had to force back the grimace that was threatening to break out over his face. It was a garish ornament and he bemoaned the fact that she would probably make him wear it all the time. He could just hear how Draco would ridicule it. However, he did what every husband would do to keep peace; he thanked her and assured her he loved it.
Once he was vertical again, he extended a hand towards his welcoming committee and introduced himself. The man took his hand and gave his name as Suchart Samarn.
Now, time to thank my lovely betas. Faye adored this chapter. She really liked the last bit. :P Icicle had less work with this one than the previous. She loved some of the imagery towards the end.
They chose a small room on the floor of the courtroom for the meeting. It was obviously used for interrogations, with a table and two chairs around it. Ron sat on one chair, and Hermione on the one facing it. Harry and Draco stood behind her, silently supporting their friend.
Harry sighed too and sat up. The morning had started out so well, and now it had all gone pear-shaped. Last night he just went with what he wanted, damn the consequences. However, in the morning, they reared their ugly heads.
“Oh? Is that so?” He seemed puzzled. “In school everyone knew you two would get married. Though I didn’t understand it myself. A smart witch like you marrying a big stupid oaf like him … such pairings never work.”
Harry wondered briefly what 'girls' she was talking about, then remembered that Ginny sometimes spent time with the women she met at balls and such. She was so rarely home, it was a mystery to him how she kept up her friendships.
A few weeks later, Harry had just arrived home from work, when he was suddenly assaulted by his blond love on the front lawn.
"Well then, I have to thank my boyfriend for arranging it," Draco said, as he approached Harry to give him a long and passionate kiss.
After fifteen minutes of waiting, people were heading back to their seats in the Wizengamot. The chamber was no longer sealed and Ginny took a place along with Ron in the audience. They thought they were going to be the only ones when three lifts stopped and out poured a multitude of reporters. They all gathered around Harry, asking questions about his new position. Arthur stood in front of his son-in-law and halted them. They were slightly disappointed, but headed towards the open doors, clearly intent on observing the Chosen One's first day at his new job. That made Harry a bit more nervous as he didn't expect his choice to go public so quickly. He looked around and spotted Draco over Arthur's shoulder - who was probably saying something encouraging -, and found comfort in the smiling grey eyes. He was the last to walk in finally, and after taking a deep breath, he took the plunge.
The Halloween ball was held at the home of the Minister for Magic, Hildegard Noble. She was a Muggle-born who had quickly risen in the anti-pureblood climate that characterised the decade after the Second Voldemort War. The home itself had once belonged to a pureblood family whose name Harry could not recall.
“So, what do you want, whore? I see you have your toyboys with you,” Ron said, very smug and confident.
Harry still felt uncomfortable, but he knew that the blond was right. He took a deep breath, and captured the other man's hand in his, and they walked on like that.
Harry was a bit nervous as he took in the pale feast of flesh, but he let it go and resolved to enjoy the moment. This was exactly what he wanted.
"Draco, why don't you find something with music?" Harry asked one day after he came home from work and found his lover watching a movie again. "I know you learned to play the violin from the time you were a small boy."
"Help her?" Greer interrupted Harry. "Why would you do that? Potter, have  you not studied Wizarding Law any more extensively than what was in your  training?" he questioned the young man in front of him, who just shook his  head. Greer frowned at his response. "Potter, it is the responsibility of an  Auror to be fully aware of the law and its intent as well. It states that a  wife wanting to divorce her husband can be made to leave his property as  soon as her intent is made known towards her spouse."
"Yes, if you want to know! That awkward fumbling that you call sex and lasts a grand total of about five minutes is not good enough!"
"Ary!" Draco called and a young female elf appeared. "Lead Mr Potter to his room, please," he commanded.
After a few more hours spent in the Burrow, the children were ready to sleep, and the adults decided to break up the party. They all returned to their homes, except for Charlie, who would take one of the International Floos the next day.
Leonardo da Vinci Airport didn't look very big. They didn't need to pick up any luggage, as everything was in their shoulder bags, shrunk and protected. Harry hated to think about waiting for his suitcase to arrive, only to find that it ended up in Kenya, or some other far-away place.
