Hiya! This is a collection of drabbles from my Tumblr, which is linked in the Summary and in the foot note. I’ll also be linking all of the drabbles individually if you want to reblog them! I will be adding them straight to my AO3 from now on so they are easier to find. The tags will be updated each time and most of them have smut. If you check on my profile, I have some more drabbles that I hope to be turning into short series’ if you want to check those out, and a fic I am hoping to update soon. Please check out my Tumblr if you can, if you liked any of the works here following me is the best way to see more! Thanks, I hope you enjoy! <3
With a lazy flick of his wand the note found itself tucked into Harry’s hand. Harry looked up and held eye contact with Draco as he opened the note. He nodded and went back to his book.
“And Draco deserves better than that, Doesn’t he?” Harry stepped past the blonde, getting g up into Justin’s face. “And he certainly doesn’t deserved to be slapped by a broke man, does he, Justin?” His voice raises, his anger now apparent.
The place was the same, par for some pots of paint in the corner and a pile of files on the old oak coffee table. As he walked into the middle of the room to pull on his clothes, he noticed something as he tugged his shirt onto his shoulders.
“Because I’m fucking tired of it! No one knows about us! We’ve been together for 8 months and The Prophet still writes articles about when you’re going to settle down with the
“Er… Draco?”
“How to ask for what you need without hurting them?”
“Yeah, maybe. I probably should have just been more chill.”
“That’s understandable,” said Draco. “May I…?” Draco lifted the arm nearest Harry, seeking permission to put it around Harry’s shoulders. Harry nodded, rearranging himself on the sofa so he could snuggle under Draco’s arm, resting the back of his head against Draco's chest. Somehow it was easier to feel vulnerable like this, held and not looking directly at Draco.
Harry’s stomach dropped. He walked towards Draco, rolling his unfastened sleeves up past the elbow as he went. He leant in to whisper his reply in Draco’s ear, “I’ll cum for you later, if you’re very good.”
“Draco. Hey, Draco!” Harry touched his arm gently. “I won’t tell. I would never. You’re not hurting anyone and I would never make anyone’s sex life public – it would be a violation. It’s ok. You’re ok.”
Draco snorted. “Only you, Harry, would make that kind of comment about the Blacks’ centuries-old wine cellar. But if you want to offer me exorbitantly expensive wine, be my guest.”
Draco laughed; this was not what Harry had been expecting. Not that it was a cruel laugh – not a ‘Potter you are an imbecile and I don’t know why I put up with it’ making fun sort of sound. Draco’s laugh was high pitched, hysterical. The kind of laugh you might use when caught out doing something ridiculous and highly embarrassing. A ‘fuck me, I am so overwhelmed with emotion I have to laugh because I’m probably going to be crying in a minute’ kind of thing. Harry was perplexed.
“Potter, was that a back-handed compliment about my choice of eating establishments?”
, said Harry’s brain. Desire and possibly arousal. Oh fuck. Harry could feel the beginning of a blush prickle the back of his neck.
? Tell me, does that fall under the category of Romance or Erotica?”
“Can we do the cock touching bit first?”
“Thank you,” said Draco, looking slightly stunned, as he pulled on the robe. “I pay them, you know. Pansy and Blaise. They get a consultant’s fee.”
“Harry, over here!” Draco waved to attract his attention. He looked good, thought Harry, as he winded his way through the tables towards the back of the restaurant.
Harry woke sometime in the early hours, to the rumble and clatter of the muggle rubbish collection in the streets below. Draco was curled next to him, the covers wound around his upper body, snuffling and sleep-soft. He shuffled closer and Draco murmured something and pressed his back against him, settling contentedly when Harry looped his arms around him. Harry felt safe and happy and mildly turned on. Not that sex was even a remote possibility – Draco was asleep, and Harry was not going to wake him – but it was still nice. Harry drowsed off again to half-formed fantasies of Draco touching Harry’s cock in various and exciting ways. For the first time, these imaginings were entirely free of anxiety. Dream Harry felt comfortable, loved. Lulled by the haze of half-sleep, Harry let himself believe that this could be a reality and for once it didn’t seem unrealistic. He could imagine having this kind of relationship. He hoped it would be with Draco, but if not, then with somebody, someday.
Harry blushed and looked away.
“I liked going out with you, for the dates, I mean. I would like to keep doing that if you would like to with me. I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said about relationships being basically friendships but with sex. Seems to me that’s what we have. Or at least, that we could do, if you wanted.”
“No! Don’t be absurd, I wouldn’t ever openly plagiarise. Have you any idea how nasty and expensive Intellectual Property Copyright infringement cases are? Besides, it would be gauche. I merely take common turns of phrase and experiences and adapt them to purpose.”
The seats were nice, red velvet with plenty of legroom and close enough to occasionally share body-heat with Draco without actually looking like that was what Harry was doing.
embarrassing....”
“And there is the fanboy meltdown I had been waiting for. Yes, we’re flying together. Hence the flying clothes I told you to wear, twit. You look nice, by the way. Appropriately dressed, as you no doubt would
“What? That I would fancy someone who I enjoy spending time with, who makes me laugh, and also makes me orgasm?”
“Absolutely. I’ll take mine off, too. Shirtsleeves and slacks?”
Harry shook his head, and then bit his lower lip, thinking. “Could we take off our clothes? I would like to see you…” Harry stumbled over the words, blushing.
“Shh,” Draco soothed, rubbing Harry’s back, “I’m here. You’re alright. You’re wonderful Harry, so lovely, just the most lovely thing.”
Draco looked momentarily flummoxed. “Any thoughts on your choice of date?” He finally asked. “We both get to choose one each, under the terms of the contract with
– and all of a sudden you find you’re in stitches? Also, it was very surprising. Your whole career revolves around writing erotica – sorry, romance novels. But honestly Draco, there is
“Oh, believe me, I take every opportunity to blame Hermione for her questionable choices.”
“No, no. That’s fine. I’m… I’m flattered. Are you quite sure?”
Harry and Draco’s first date was because of a bet: Harry’s lost bet, to be precise. It wasn’t even Draco he had lost the bet to, which was unfortunate – insufferable blond streak of
“Settle down, Draco. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, embarrassing as in it’s a public date with a
“Coming?” he asked, voice low, smoky and enticing.
“Merlin. Of course I’m leaving it out. They haven’t paid nearly enough for that kind of content. We’ll leave it a month then do an exclusive with whichever publication bids highest.”
“It just seems… improbable.”
“Yeah, that would be great.”
have if needed, which was the point.
“And that works?”
it to write about it. Research, Potter. It’s great. You should really look into it.”
“What’s that?”
“Sitting with your back against the headboard would be good, I think,” said Harry, something tight easing in his chest as he watched Draco comply.
’s, it’s a very low bar, Draco.”
“Hmmm?”
“Ok, so Brevis will be saved the embarrassment then. Also, no unisex showers? How quaint.”
In the end they didn’t make it to the showers. Once in the dressing room, out of sight of the others, the kissing redoubled, hot and heavy. Draco had both hands on Harry’s lower back, stroking the dimples that sat just above his arse; Harry clutched Draco to him with one arm, carding his other hand up through the hair on the back of Draco’s neck, using this as purchase to deepen the kiss. They were both using so much tongue it was a wonder no gag reflexes had been triggered yet.
“Draco, you must be freezing; you have goosebumps all up your arms. Here, take one of my robes.” Harry wordlessly summoned a sleek grey dressing gown for Draco and an old hoodie for himself.
during their winning streak in the ‘90s, that is during Draco’s formative years as a
“Draco, did you just offer to be my wingman?” said Harry.
“Merlin, no.” Draco suddenly looked terrified. “Harry you won’t… you can’t tell them! It would ruin me…”
“But aren’t the plots supposed to be stupid? I always thought it was a bunch of beefy singers in horned hats singing of facile rubbish. You know. Pretentious, with
“Yes. I’m sure,” Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry smiled, arms crossed, one elbow hugged tight to his chest. “Yeah. Yes. I’ve heard of it. I even thought I might be asexual for a while, but I’m not. At least, I’m pretty sure that I’m not…” Harry rubbed his nose. Draco waited patiently for him to continue.
Draco turned, head in hands, elbows on knees. “I’m sorry,” he stuttered, “you said to go slow. I shouldn’t have done that. I was so turned on – didn’t think... I’m such an idiot. I think I should go.” He made to get up, but Harry grabbed his arm.
To Harry's dismay, this made Draco worse. Draco had disentangled himself from Harry again and had his head in his hands, rocking, and laughing, and crying simultaneously in huge shaking snotty sobs. Harry didn’t know what to do. He rubbed Draco’s back in slow soothing circles and waited. Harry had found, after the war, that waiting quietly was often the best response to somebody crying. It had been something of a useful revelation, he’d had to use it quite a bit.
. There. I’ve said it, laugh it up.”
“Yes, I want to, if you would enjoy it. I’d really like to make you feel good.”
“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “But I’m still sorting out a few of the logistics, and I want it to be a surprise. Your date is next up, anyway. Saturday, right? Have you chosen what we’re doing yet?”
Draco closed the gap between them, and they were kissing. It was good. Good in the way Draco melted into him, warm and willing, their hands and arms and bodies fitting around each on instinct, easy and comfortably thoughtless. Although Harry was worried about being overly spitty, conscious that this was the first time he had kissed Draco and Harry didn’t know what he liked. Harry wanted to deepen the kiss but thought it might be too much. Also, his tailcoat was not designed for ease of making out. Harry kissed Draco once, more firmly, and drew back a fraction, running a thumb along the line of Draco’s jaw.
“How Gryffindor of you,” said Draco, looking highly sceptical. Harry bit his tongue around the words
“Are you telling me that you just copy other people’s sex scenes?”
“What’s a synopsis?”
“Mmm hmm, and I’m not even sorry,” said Harry, walking them back towards his bed.
Except Draco’s clothes were significantly more revealing than Harry’s: that blasted gauze shirt. Now his waistcoat was off, Harry could see Draco’s nipples. As in, it was difficult to keep his eyes off them. Fortunately, Draco appeared not to have noticed, he was too busy looking at him as though Harry were sex on legs. Harry’s brain had been right; Draco’s unidentified expression from earlier in the evening had been that of desire. Now Draco wasn’t masking it, this was obvious. Harry shivered. Draco stretched out on the settee, arms thrown wide over its back, one ankle hooked over his knee.
“I want you to feel good, too, Harry.”
“Er… Draco?”
“Coloured photographs, Potter, and the synopsis, and you might not be interested in reading about the cast and the conductor, but I definitely am. I couldn’t very well take you on a date to the opera and then insist on keeping the programme for myself. Besides,
“Yeah, I know. Thank you. I guess what I would like to know is, would you like anything from me, if I were offering?”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco whispered, pulling back. “Was that not ok?”
“I do very thorough research.”
“Give or take.”
“I have no objection, by the way.”
“Pardon?”
“Ah, should we head in, then?” he asked, gesturing to where the event staff were tearing tickets and ushering people through to their seats. Maybe if he distracted Draco he wouldn’t notice Harry’s discomfort.
“I’m sorry. Have I overstepped? Just, I would really like to go out with you and I thought it was probably better to say so sooner rather than later. Clear communication and all that.”
“And you’re currently coping with this by, what? Self-enforced celibacy?”
“Like a film’s soundtrack mixed up together with the dialogue of the film. But better.” Harry enthused. “Because, live performance, Draco! I can’t believe how loud the cast could sing. Was it really not amplified?”
“I’m having a good time, I promise,” said Harry, embarrassed, “I’m just like this.”
“Certainly,” said Draco, offering Harry his arm. Harry placed his hand in the crook of Draco’s elbow, painfully aware of the heat of Draco’s body, of his closeness, of the tingles that roused in Harry’s stomach and chest.
It was difficult not to think of Draco in the days after; Harry would find himself daydreaming halfway through random household tasks. Or, more alarmingly, during training at work. Fortunately, it was the off season, so he was mostly working on strength and agility training. Daydreaming during a match would be unacceptable. As it was, he was just given stick by his teammates for being absent minded: so, another day in the office, in other words.
Draco twitched into a radiant half-grin. “You fancy that shower now?”
“So, your publishers know that you’re conning their buyers?”
“Showers are all yours, boys!” she teased. “Brevis and I will take the team’s dressing room. I refuse to play gooseberry on your date if there’s going to be nudity.”
. All you need to do is make one mistake and they will
and waited.
“Git.”
“Er…”
“Excellent. Well, that’s all settled then.”
“My word,” Draco hissed.
“Ok,” said Harry and Draco laughed, kissed the top of his head, and turned off the lights.
“The thing is,” said Draco. “Merlin’s pants, this is so embarrassing. You don’t think you could just forget my unbridled hysteria of a minute ago? Self-obliviate, or something? No? You never were very obliging, Potter. Right. The thing is, I am not a collector of virgins. Don’t laugh!”
“You think I’ve dated famous queer wizards?”
“That’s alright then,” said Harry, with a grin. He gave Draco’s arm a squeeze.
Harry curled into Draco’s embrace, he felt shocked and wrung out.
“I don’t quite believe I’m about to say this, but… if you ever wanted to experiment a little with someone you have managed to have this awkward conversation with already, I could… ah… help you out.”
“So, about one hundred years ago, then?”
“What can I do for you?” Draco whispered.
“Some opera plots are a little silly. Usually lots of intrigue and sex scandals, if I’m frank. The horned hats are very specific to Wagner’s
Draco laughed, and curled himself around Harry’s back, pulling the covers over them. Harry felt safe. Draco had cared for him, listened to him, and helped him in ways that made Harry feel needed and strong, not needy and broken. It occurred to Harry that there wasn’t anyone else in his life he would be comfortable spooning while naked. With Draco it was easy. Harry closed his eyes and remembered the way Draco had touched him while they kissed, the way Harry’s skin had tingled, his stomach tightened. He remembered Draco spread in front of him, cock hard and eyes smouldering. The noises Draco had made as Harry had touched him, the taste and feel of his skin on Harry’s tongue. The memories were getting Harry hard, which was a bit odd given that the actual actions hadn’t at the time. Tentatively, Harry palmed his cock. Yep, he was already most of the way up.
“We can shower, if you like,” Draco offered. He was running his hands over Harry’s sides, down to the sensitive dip just before the sharp jut of his hips. Harry shivered.
“There are cubicles! Non-binary players can shower where they like!” said Harry aggrieved, “We’re not that backward.”
“I’ll have you know that Romance and Erotica are two entirely separate genres!”
All in all, it wasn’t really surprising that neither man lasted long. Afterwards Draco hugged him. Harry was sticky and shaking and high on having just orgasmed and hugging Draco was the best thing in the world.
Draco’s eyes went wide.
“I’ll get straight to the point, Mr Potter. I know about your relationship with my son”. His eyes went wide but before he could speak she silenced him with a raised finger. “Draco didn’t have to tell me, but I noticed whenever I saw him over the summer he seemed ravished, which lead me to believe he was seeing someone. The next clue was how utterly devastated he was towards the end of the summer, just as your relationship with the Weasley girl was announced. Of course, this could’ve been coincidence. But when I was told it was
Draco looked down at the headline again.
“You shagged someone else in our bed, Harry. So yes, it was like that.” She looked back at him, her expression neutral.
Harry started to explain with a stutter but she cut him off- “I mean, obviously I knew you were seeing someone else, you’re terrible at hiding things. But I didn’t expect that. I mean, when I found lingerie that was obviously not mine, far too tiny I assumed you were shagging some skinny slag, but I never suspected,” she laughed.
He heard Draco’s shouts minutes before he got to his chambers, causing him to burst out laughing. My, would this one be a handful.
“Pansy?” He spoke, completely ignoring her fellow Slytherins. The black haired girl perked up at him. “Yes Potter?” He handed the book over to her. “‘Mione said to give this to you, and to tell you she’ll be sharing Ron’s bed tonight” Pansy gasped before giggling. “Good for her! Thanks for this, Potter.” Harry nodded at her before turning to the stairs.
“Fuck, and to think we could have been doing this the whole time”. Harry laughed at him and moved to kiss Draco’s neck, causing him to let out a filthy moan.
It was a set up, he knew they’d meant it to be good fun but it was just too much for his anxiety to take and he burst into tears, causing their smiles to falter.
20 minutes later Harry was out of the shower and drying his hair as he wandered back into his bedroom. The blonde still looked so peaceful.
“It’s over, Malfoy, come on!” Harry yelled, still not looking at him. Draco looked away with tears in his eyes and noticed Harry had fixed all of the plates.
Ginny moved over from the bed where she’s been waiting for harry to his lap at his desk, she’d taken her shirt of to try and get his attention but he couldn’t be more distracted. “What’s wrong, Harry?” She asked impatiently. They hadn’t had sex since they got back together in August, and it was now early October. He pushed her off of his lap gently and turned back to his desk. “I’m just not in the mood tonight, Gin, I’m sorry” she stood up with a huff and went to find her shirt. “I’ll see you tomorrow then, but you better sort yourself out, Harry.” With that she stomped away and he let out a sigh. What the hell was he doing with his life? She deserved better than this. So did Draco. He shook his head as he got up to go to Draco’s dorm. They hadn’t planned on meeting tonight but he hadn’t been with Draco since Wednesday and he was all riled up, and what’s more he had just seen Blaise leave so he knew they’d be safe.
“Blimey, you do know how to make a good mess of things, don’t you?”
Harry nodded and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.
This is the fifth work in my Drarry Drabbles Collection. Link to it on
Harry turned back to yell at them but felt Draco’s hand on the side of his face, stopping him in his tracks. “Harry darling, it’s not worth it, come on.” He nodded at his boyfriend and they kept moving.
He reached his hand down between Draco’s legs which were now rutting a against him, desperately seeking friction. “P-Potter,” Draco moaned the name so well out of his mouth. If he’d been trying to say something it obviously wasn’t important anymore as he had sought had Harry’s mouth and once again been captured in the other boys mouth.
He pulled back the curtain gently, pain clenching at his chest at the paled boy in front of him. He rushed forward and kneeled at the side of Draco’s bed wile half wrapping his arms around him. “Gods, Draco I am
“Honestly Harry! You just couldn’t help yourself could you?” Hermione shrieked as she whizzed around the room spelling Draco’s wounds clean and applying ointments. “Well I couldn’t just leave him there ‘Mione!” Harry sighed.
Draco had walked right out of the tower after Harry had kissed him and stormed into the great hall, where his fellow Slytherin 8th years greeted him for breakfast with questioning looks.
“Why?” Harry huffed affrontedly.
Then, Harry had told him about Grimmauld Place, told him he’d put Draco on the wards and he could floo in anytime he liked. And oh did he use that to his advantage.
“I hope you can be happy with me, Draco. I know you don’t want to be a wife but it’s not all that bad”. The blonde boy stayed quiet for a moment.
my cock” With that he pulled out of Draco and flipped him over, to which the bottom replied with an unappreciative moan. “What the fuck Potter! I was so close!” Harry just smirked. He yanked Draco by his hair until his head was in Harry’s lap. “You’re going to suck me off to apologise, THEN you get to come.” The other man took him into his mouth without another word of protest and got to work.
“Hmm?”
Harry loved eating Draco. He sucked the muscle up and moved his tongue around inside until it loosened up, becoming slick. Draco tasted like butterscotch and Harry couldn’t get enough of it. He nipped his teeth on the side of the hole which caused Draco to let out a shout, and then started sucking over the muscle instead. It was now a sloppy, flexing mess that had Draco in shakes. “Please Harry, fuck me!” Being a people pleaser, who was Harry to refuse?
It was still dark in Harry’s room, but he managed to get them both onto the bed without falling. Draco heard him mutter a quick silencing charm as they landed on the bed. As soon as he had Draco pinned down underneath him he started his attack on the blonde’s mouth, who moaned right back into his own.
This is based off of a prompt from keyflight790 which is why they are listed as a co-creator, I've also linked their Tumblr in the footnote.
That really was
Harry had reframed the picture Draco had destroyed, but instead of it being on the side table it now sat on the end of the mantle piece.
“So what if I have? I’m still mad!” He slurred, glaring at Draco’s coffee table ornaments.
“I have loved you every day since we were 14, and when you told me you loved me I thought you might actually mean it. But you left me, you left me and broke my heart!”. He reached out to the wall to steady himself. Harry rushed forward and pulled a reluctant Draco into him.
“Jesus Christ, The Saviour got hot, apparently. When did that happen?” Pansy babbled on. “Looks like his Weasley and he have a good time.” Jacob chuckled. Draco looked up at him.
"I understand your concern, Harry," he tells me honestly. “But, this is the best we can do if we want Dray to be ready on time. If he stays as he is, without access to books, without access to people who can help him, without actually being in this world, then you can be sure that he will not adapt quickly enough in the final battle. Even if you don't want him there, Harry, the truth is that, you know it as much as I do, it's only a matter of time until the wizarding world finds out about two things: your relationship with him and his relationship with Regulus Black, who was bragging dead,” Dumbledore stands still for only a few seconds, then collapses into one of the most comfortable chairs in the small room. “This is our best chance, Harry. I know it and you know it."
Draco waves his hand and soft music fills the room and it enters the kitchen.
“Draco did it himself when he moved in here,” she says.
“She is giving you her blessing the only way she knows,” he says once his composure is back.
"What are the ones that glow with golden light?" I ask Hermione.
Left comments and kuddos they make my day all better, and I love to know what you think about this cahpter.
“Do you want some hot chocolate with Barkley’s?” she asks me, making to mugs floats to us. “I know you like that one. I was waiting for you, Harry The First.”
"Because..." but he doesn't elaborate. He just turns around and start walking. "Prepare yourself Potter. They want to turn your soulmate rogue."
Arthur pats me on the shoulder a couple of times.
But, the healer ignores me in favor to brandish his wand over Draco’s body. He is arm is still healing, bandaged up with gauze and a funny smelly potion-cream. His skull is wrapped up tightly and I can the places where Smart-Healer deemed good to take out chunks of his blond, silky, shiny hair.
Dray smiles and lets the air escape from his lungs, as several things start to break down in the room.
"Excellent piece," the man tells me.
"Hi, I'm Dray," he says to the house elf in a quick tone once his hands carefully close on the old elf's arms. "Did I do something to bother you?"
"She was an obscurial," I say.
And those who are still outside the theater greet him, as we head towards the nearest train station.
I can't help but laugh.
"Harry," Regulus look me in the eye and I see him nod softly.
I watch Dray put a red-faced Voictoire in her rocking chair and take out his cello and then settle in front of her, pushing the chair with the tip of his foot. Victoire lowers the intensity of her crying and falls completely silent when Dray begins to play.
"Remember to take a corner, Dray," the woman says in a semi-scream. "I do not want…"
A huge parchment appears in the air and unrolls and a magic photo is revealed in front of me.
"I know Master Draco is good," he says softly.
"If he have self-esteem issues, that's not my problem," Ginny replies, setting the table. “If you have a problem with something, you have to fix it. Harry doesn't like people who are weak. That's why he went out with me, because I proved to be stronger than the other girls in our house."
“Ah!” the scream fills the room and I look at him, ready to attack.
"I love you, Harry," he says, looking at the dishes and starting to clean them.
Harry's face lights up and I know this is not a passing thing.
Lesath was sixth in the Black and Rosier line. However, my nephew would be the seventh child of the Black and Rosier line, and that gives my bastard sister enough power. Our Lord now knows he is alive, thanks to a Mole, but there's no name to give to him yet.
They are from my husband.
My body start to feel hot in seconds and then, I can feel a pressure inside my chest. I close my eyes and I try to keep my breathe under control. I try to keep my composure.
“It is not Never-Ending Winter, right?” I ask her, trying to wrap my head around all that happened today.
I am so tired. My granfather's health is going downwards and I just want a place to breathe in peace.
I look at Ron and his face lights up as if someone had brought Christmas forward or declared Free Food Day.
“Did you not read the file I sent over stating Potion Master Malfoy actual state?” Smart-Healers press him.
“Cissa,” my father scolds her.
"No one is going to train him to be a fucking assassin," I growl my words, my chest feeling utterly constricted at the mention of those words.
My magic calms down and my grip loosens a bit more. Teddy keeps looking at everything, his little hand in his mouth, while he scratches his gums.
“There was a fucking cat I let inside the house, because astray muggles cat are supposed to be safe,” he says. “It was sporting a bleeding paw and I just… I just thought…”
Shit.
“Well, someone can…” I look them both in the eyes. “And you know him, like face to face.”
Because I need Bill alive. Molly will be devasted if anything happens to any other of her children dies or their minds get damaged, for a Malfoy nonetheless. I take a deep breath, trying to remind myself that I have a family to protect too, and even if this is a hard decision, I know I will choose Bill over Draco any day.
"Are my children awake?" I ask him.
Draco walks into the living room and I stay with James in the kitchen for a few more seconds. I think about my chores for tomorrow and I add to the list taking James' to buy an instrument he might like to learn.
Being in the Aurors is one of the most exciting jobs in the world when you're on a undercover mission. However, it is also a very risky profession. And yet, Robards can make it as boring as classes with Professor Binns.
I amuse myself with sandwiches, waiting for one of our younger children to come down. However, the first to go down is Teddy. A smile is on his lips and I immediately see him reach out for a cucumber sandwich.
"Have you finished meeting Harry's boyfriend?" Molly asks, handing Ginny a steaming saucepan.
"Sure, it's nice," I tell him. Just like you, and that's what I don't dare say. "What's the deal with the soda thing?"
And that act only awards me with a fierce blush blooming in his, otherwise, porcelain pale cheeks. The blush is spreading to his neck and ears and I feel smug to know I am capable to make him burn up like this.
“How bad?” I ask her and suddenly she is taking a long parchment out of her purse.
Bill nods to me and then, he eyes Hermione for a few seconds before downing the potion. When he put away the vial, a grimace starts to make its way to his face. And I see the magic happening.
"He was seen in one of the most decrepit places in France a couple of days ago," replies Winnie Wood, one of the youngest aurors in Thomas Tolstoy's team. “France will send one of their best groups, however, that case has already been taken to Wizengamot. France also wants to prosecute West, once he have been arested."
Leaving my ring to Draco only means one thing: I love you. And you are mine, for until the end of my life. And I am yours, for the rest of eternity.
I had so much fun writting this chapter and even if it's not that long, or if today is not posting day, I just cannot take this idea off my mind. So, here it is!
Yes, because calling him Harry in front my mother is all sort of wrong. It is like confessing. And when you confess something to your mother, there's not going back.
"Auror Moon, your job will be to prepare a team of Aurors for when Potter and Weasley have found the place where Draco Black resides on or, in other circumstances, his corpse."
“Smart-Healer says he wouldn’t be up for another twelve ours,” I say, remembering the hour-long speech about how she will raise an investigation on me if it turns out I wanted to harm Draco by faking be his boyfriend.
So a Hitler with a Narcissistic complex is after Harry, who is a genius when it comes to moving his own body, or that's what I believe after watching Quidditch play. It features Hermione Granger who is an agent equivalent to the M.I.6 and someone who can be considered a colonel for the English troops.
Dray open his mouth, a sexy gesture I think. My magic is humming happily inside me.
Got damn. I have to stop bringing work home.
DRACO
“What have this to do with Draco?” I ask her, not taking my eyes away from the picture.
“I didn’t say…” I try to argue against my mother.
"I want to take you to a place that is special to me," I tell him, putting seriousness in my voice. "I can tell you it was my home until I was seventeen," I tell Dray, "Lead the way, then, Sir Harry," he tells me as I lead us down an alley where I know we can disapparate without anyone knowing.
I nod knowing what she's talking about. I have worked part time every day. The children stay with Molly most of the day. However, I arrive at the hospital at 7:30 a.m. to see Draco before I go to work at 8:00. I return at 1 p.m. until the nurses kick me out at 2:30 p.m. And then I go get the kids, and we spend the rest of the day together.
"I'm so happy for you, Harry," she tells me with a huge smile threatening to split her face in half. “I'm glad that after such a long time you are finally smiling and enjoying yourself. After all, you are just a child,” and even though I don't feel like one, I know that for this woman, I will always be the eleven-year-old boy who needed food and love… Lots of love.
"When's our next Weasley meting?" Scorpius asks me, looking at everything around him, from the black and white portraits that don't move, to some images of human brains on the wall.
"It's Harry Potter," says the girl and I immediately feel that the lake inside me is about to send her to hell. Magic thundering inside of me. "Is this your occamy Mr. Potter?"
"Soda all?" Magdy looks at me and I can see the evil gleam in her eyes.
I hear it gasp.
"Of course not at the beginning," he told me honestly. "But, I learned which fights are worth the effort and which ones were not. I still think that way. Some battles are meant to be and others are just... unworthy your time and your energy," his eyes looks older and wise. "Most of them aren't worth the fight, But, there are others..." he smile is back full force. "Others are meant to be fight for until you win them."
"I'm sure you could feel the spark gently dance inside his body." Zephora tells me, winking at me.
"Better?" I ask James, who is drinking his tea in a hurry.
He nods.
"Never!" he says fiercely.
"Coats?" Draco asks seriously, looking the children up and down.
"Mister Potter-Malfoy," I address him as if he were any other student. "Do you know the answer?" I ask him and I feel like my godfather, Severus Snape. The same person who allowed me to have my children. He nods effusively. "Say it out loud, so the whole class can listens to you, please." And this is protocol.
This ward is working similarly. It’s renovating constantly, but not absorbing the environment around it. This feels more like a repelling. This is a combination between a Fidelius and a Salvia ward.
"He is dead, Harry," Ron says.
“I don’t want to be a rogue person,” I am scare.
the bright letters forms.
Protocol is fine.
“What is the Dumbledore’s Army?” I sit in a platform, my feet dangling in the air.
"You will be working with one of my people." Neekeal say earnestly, without even looking in Moon direction.
"What is an Argentum, Zephora?" I ask the same as Ron, this time without giving anyone room to speak.
I feel him sailing through my mind, until his presence stops, like a huge wall of ice. And in front of me, I see again the little baby that I did not have the guts to kill, who in return I cut off his ears to have a memory to offer to the person who wanted to kill him.
I nod, trying to ease my own mind. This is important. This is important to ensure Dray’s survival. I need him alive. I need to remember this.
He is not shimmering anymore.
I sigh heavily.
You know guys, there's just a month until my Birthday. Yei. Sarah Lee.
“So, we are going to deward his house,” I blanch at what Hermione is saying.
“He knows Dumbledore,” I state, trying to wage if it will do more good then harm.
"Once I'm gone, give him his favorite cake and a warm drink, the ones he likes the most," I say to Hannah, as I turn on my heel and start to leave the place. "Put it in my tab, will you, please?"
He look me in the eyes, his own glinting with mischief and a evil smirk painted in his lips.
“I am an auror, I am aware of the law, sir,” I say to him, not wavering in my words. “You are trying to say that we are living a farse, which we are not.”
“Who else is a mgiczoologist that you know?” I ask them.
December 18th, 2002
"How did you get here?" I ask the snake, sitting on the edge of the bed.
Dray is openning Harry's eyes the best way he can.
"My students?" he asks me after a long silence.
"Just cockroaches," it hisses strangely. "Talk is difficult," the winged snake tells me closing its eyes and letting its head fall on the sheet.
I relax into his touch and try to breathe deeply, concentrating on the relaxing motion of long fingers in my hair. I drop my head against the edge of the tub and feel a large, fluffy towel cushion my head.
“Draco wasn’t depressed,” I say seriously.
"He just turned twenty last month," I say to Hermione.
"Dray," I call him, yet I don't touch him.
"The Death Eater?" Ron asks me hesitatingly, but after a few seconds he writes the name next to the photograph of Druella Rosier and under the name of Evan Rosier the initials of D.E. with a question mark. "I think this is going to get interesting."
"Really?" Draco asks, giving him a smile.
"Your sun is doing that, Harry," I tell him and in a matter of seconds, Harry's sun disappears. But not the heat.
"I am very grateful for the age difference between the two of you," says Dumbledore softly, his eyes on me. "For sure, Minerva's blood pressure would have skyrocketed if the two of you had known each other here since your teenage years."
“To be a better creature,” she says and I can picture her nodding for herself only.
"It could be, but is in the wrong fingur," James tells her, as if she's retarded. His wrinkled nose reminds me of Draco, if my husband had black hair. "On this finger," James tells her, raising his left hand and pointing to his ring finger with his right.
I smirk at her.
Lovegood didn’t close the door.
“Well, the thing remained the same,” Hermione’s keep the conversation going for me. I tunned her out, not wanting to keep up with all the scary things I prefer to hear from Harry. Or not at all. “… Do you think our plan is good?”
I hug Teddy, restricting my strength.
I breathe again, trying to empty my mind just like Redfern has been saying for the last days. It is an excruciating task because I can still feel Harry’s warm magic somewhere in the back of my mind.
Fear.
She kneels in the grass. The soil is warm. Good for dandelions. “I want to believe in that old ta…”
That thrown me off.
“Ron?” I ask, trying to lighten up the air.
"I'll take it to him, and tell him that you send it," she says jovially, just like all the Puffs I remember from Hogwarts.
“Blood thing shit,” Ron says.
He tilts his face and then, his eyes are boring holes into my soul.
"Name," the enchanted book tells him and Dray takes a step back. His gaze is one of horror.
"Be nice to Papa," Draco says to the twins in a serious tone, wiping his mouth with a cloth napkin.
"I will hold you to that, profesor Dumbledore," he says softly, regaining his soft aura. My magic settling inside me.
However, I cannot answer him, yet.
"And what is he like, Harry?" Ginny asks from the other end of the table, practically screaming over the noise that Fred and George have made.
And it is true. We were as support for other aurors, to raid a Death Eater property. A few weeks ago a dark haired boy get kidnapped, Yaxley told us about him in passing. And just this morning, after midnight we were called in duty to help other aurors to raid the place.
“He has no windows?” I ask as I shift the layout.
"Let's go, Dray," I say to the blonde, putting my hands on his shoulders. "I will find someone else who can help Nesha."
GreeneySilvery.
"I know, love," I whisper carefully. "Come on, there's a place near here where we can spend the night." And by close I mean apparating in the middle of a witch's living room.
A few seconds later the enchanted head goes still.
And I can hear pain and shame in her voice. This is Hermione, sweet-caring, Hermione. I look at her over my body, and I can see a tear falling down her cheek.
I am utterly in love and spitting unicorns and rainbows.
And immediately I can see the matron smile and take Dray's hand in hers, then gently shake it.
"Oh, excellent Mr. Handsome," Is Magdy flirting with Harry? "And you two sweeties?" She's addressing the two people I don't know at all, but since Harry said she wanted to introduce me to two very important people to her, I'm assuming these are them.
He smiles to me, a sun blind smile. I try to give him one back, but I am not sure I am doing it right. I know Hermione, Draco doesn’t know her. I know Slytherins, and Hermione is playing all Gryffindor on him.
The elevator opens onto the DLME floor and I see Kingsley on the other side. The children completely forget about the woman as they run to the other side and hug the legs of the Minister for Magic.
Left comment and kuddos, those makes my life happy.
And I'm almost sure that the press is going to take advantage of that.
“He has two broken ribs,” the healer says to me, while she performs a new spell over Draco’s body. “A fracture ankle and his two wrists are bruised and swelling faster,” a baby blue light emerges from his body and I can all the places that are broken or bruised. “His brain is fairly good for the hit he sustained. But…”
the glowing letters are painted like a rainbow.
We nod knowingly, being conscious of what might be at stake if we fucked up. Mostly, Regulus Black will die knowing the location of a Horcrux Dumbledore is not going to give us willingly.
I try to breathe and keep my emotions under control.
“Of course not, Harry,” Hermione says, taking my hand and squeezing it softly.
I feel several eyes in the room rest on me and I feel bad. I nod slightly.
He smiles softly.
“I will let our Lord you are awake,” she turns in her booted heels, skipping a few steps in her childish rush.
Although, maybe it is.
But, Scorpius effusively denies.
And all of that is thanks to my husband.
But Harry needs his sleep. I can deal with the nightmares, and the dread, and the feeling of being suffocating by cold hands on my own. Harry needs a good night of sleep desperately; I can see it in the dark circles under his eyes. His, usually, tanned skin, is pasty and pale. And it, combines with my own hallucinations, makes even the waking hours a complete hell.
2. All kind of love are valids, even more if those feelings are helping someone else to get better.
“Semantics, semantics,” Dray says, maybe getting the statement all wrong. “And the beaters play with the crazy ball, while the seeker plays with the angel-like mini-ball.”
Hermione laughs and I pretend to be outraged. I turn my face and see Ron and his empty plate.
"Leave that alone, Harry," Hermione says slapping my hand and taking it away from the tie.
"His real name is Draco Black," Regulus says out loud, choking me on the piece of toast in my mouth. And from the amount of people coughing in the room, I know I'm not the only one having problems to swallow. "However, his name and magic had a seal. A seal that prohibited his full name from being spoken or remembered, only by those of us who knew his original name from the beginning. We were unable to say his name to a stranger.”
“What even makes you believe you can control someone…” he pauses. “Something like me? A stupid book is not the answer, surely.”
"In a safe place," I tell him, as I lift my wand and start putting ward upon ward. The strongest charm to seal a door, courtesy of Hermione and her eagerness to be safe. And then, I put that same enchantment on the window. Those are not even Auror material, most like an Unspeakeable spell.
"Thank you Merlin that we were good enough to put on our pajamas on last night," he tells me, tracing unknown shapes on the fabric of my sweater.
Left comments and kuddos, they makes my day better... Or night. It deppends on which country you are.
House elves don't know how to make hamburgers. A smile escapes my lip. Dudley was always able to eat hamburgers, I only saw the empty wrappers on the floor, sometimes the odd pickle with stay behind.
"Boys," the lady that took our orders is here with a tray with two burgers. The first completely different from the next.
"You can trust them, Zephora," Albus tells him. “They are the other people who will, morally, help win this war. You can trust that they won't tell anyone or that they will endanger Dray porpousely."
A woman with chocolate hair looks at him.
"No, darling," I say honestly. "Watching you three grow makes me feel like the luckiest man in the world."
… I stop to think for a second.
Dray rises his face as the most beautiful smile in the world is starting born on his lips.
"I don't know, Potter," she tell me, squatting down and watching the floor closely. "It doesn’t look like anyone has forced the door, nor the wards."
“We were raised by a female-Hitler,” then they both salutes her and went out before their own mom can retaliate against them.
And just like that our backups are here, appearing from thin air and going inside the house. We are roughly ten people, and we know we need to be careful.
I stop and look at her over my shoulder, as my hand turns the doorknob and I walk into Kingsley's office. Hermione and Ron will join me in a few seconds, after ensuring that Dray is still where he said he will be today. Safe and sound.
And I get lost in the little world, while the notes go through my head, and my brain compares them to many other things at once. Imagining possible orchestral accompaniments that don't really exist, listening in my head while I place other instruments, other notes... Another essence.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I love you, Harry," Draco tells me in a whisper.
"Molly said sandwiches," Draco replies.
"I want to go home," is the sad sob that escapes his lips. "I just want to go home." If he knew that our Lord feeds on the pain of others.
I open my eyes and look up at him. He takes a step back, concern painted in his features.
But, who receives me is Nesha, her body drags on the floor of the apartment, while her little fuchsia wings flap agitated.
She smiles at me.
Fifteen Minutes to Midnight
“Yes, I can and I will,” his eyes so grey, they look like a storm is rigging inside them. “The only reason of his survival was because Zephora brought him back from the death,” he says, opening the book on his hands and searching for an entry. “The premature departure of one Albus Dumbledore, to the realm of the death, is the catalyst to ensure the survival of Lord Voldemort, since his knowledge will be lost to the Boy Who Lived,” he paused and looks up at me. “To ensure the victory of the light side is necessary to keep Dumbledore alive and to achieve that, a necromancer might be needed.”
“They did, Draco,” she mumbles softly. “Sadly, wizards aren’t the most intelligent people in the world.” She is red in the face now. “Most of the citizen of the Wizarding World has proven to be a bunch of cowards, at least, the ones in U.K. are. They preferred to believe in a prophecy instead of using their brains.”
"Good morning, class," my classroom is silent, while Scorpius stands in front of them. I watch from above how his face is serious. "I hope you slept well and that you are ready for your exam," and he begins to pull out a couple of sheets from his small backpack and grasp them firmly with one hand.
"Family." He whispered and my eyes fall on Ron's. "He was trying to protect someone from her family."
“We will, we need to,” I say to him. “We need to catch this people,” I say to him, letting my eyes rest on the real Draco. He looks better, but he is still unconscious. “Smart-Healer…” I start to say but I am interrupted by Hermione.
I smirk.
James looks at him for a moment and then smiles at his twin.
“Sorry,” I say to him, while I can feel the blood rushing to my cheeks. “But, I though you will be better here, where Kreacher and Winky can both watch over you, while I am out,” I say to him, trying not to stutter.
“I can assure, Mister Bald Lord,” a pun in the middle of his pain? What is so fucking wrong with the Blacks and their preservation instinct. “A
"Auror Potter," Kingsley respectfully tells me. “We are pretty sure there are spies for Voldemort at Hogwarts. He is targeting Muggle-born infants and kids, because even at 17 you are still a kid..." He looks into me and I can feel it. He still sees me as a kid. "Those children who will be the next witches and wizards, Voldemort is extinguishing. Many of us already know that pureblood wizards don't have the same magic as a Muggle-born child. If Voldemort eliminates them, he won't have to deal with people more powerful than him to oppose him when he comes to power. And that, we simply cannot allow."
The oven rings and I move my hand to turn off the muggle stove in the house.
"Saint Mungo's," I say clearly, leaving Parkinson gapping at me.
"I want to meet Professor Malfoy," he tells me with his eyes locked on mine.
(See the end of the chapter for
The man smiles at me.
I take Hermione's hand.
You have nothing to worry about, Harry, I tell myself to try to put order in my own head. Hermione loves Ron.
I see Dray open his eyes and loosen his hands, to loosen the fabrics of my jacket. His eyes are fixed on the tall doors that will open at any moment and then, McGonagall appears on the other side. Her gaze fixed on both of us, while looking with something that can be kindness... But, who knows.
GreeneySilvery.
“You are my universe,” he whispers against my lips. “Never forget it, okay?” He ta
Even if I miss Dray's colorful hair, I have nothing against how he looks now. A dirty, bright and short blonde.
"Ah, a Black," says the hat. "Not many of them has been here in decades," says the hat happily. “I can see your loyalty. However, Dray is not your first name and Black is not your last."
What is wrong with me? Where are my parents? And Luna? Where's Luna? A cold tear scape eye while I think about Luna. And my Parents. And Teddy.
“When is he going to wake up?” Hermione asks to Smart-Healer and the woman seems troubled finding a suitable answer for this woman.
"Are you sure you're not having a spasm, Mag?" I ask her, while an evil smile crosses my lips.
"Remembering old times, Regulus?" she says to me and I see her sit in front of me. "Do I remind you of anyone?" she asks me with her eyes closed, her head tilted to the side.
But, what the hell. I love him enough and I know my feelings are requited as well.
I smile again, satisfied with my course of action. I let my hand fall over the door, knocking before opening the door.
"And he has magic?" asks our Lord. His red eyes staring at Lucius intently.
"Will you join us?" I ask him, as I walk away and start to put the dishes on the breakfast table.
"Yes, Papa will be a hero today," I say to my son, closing the door behind me. And he better get back safe and sound. "Good morning," I say to all the professors present in the spacious room.
"And are we going to eat dinner with Papa?" he asks me, raising his green eyes and focusing on mine.
"How big is this operation auror Potter?" Robards' tone makes me think of Severus Snape.
“Is this his brain?” I ask the healer, still ot believing it. A huge, bright net is here.
"We will make sure that he always know he have a family, that we love him and that we always will." I say softly. I take my husband's face in my hands. “We just have to remind Teddy that we are his family. It doesn't matter what the world says, Draco. They are our children and our only duty is to love them and make them feel loved and safe.”
Dray looks at him and a chill runs through my body. The last time a wizard used magic on Dray the outcome was disastrous and I'm not quite sure I can bring my beautiful angel back from the dead a second time. At least not without the help of Zephora Zambroni.
"Ask him what he can eat," Dray tells me, as he turns around and begins to search for clothes among the only furniture other than the bed in this room. “Really Harry, we have to go buy furniture and paint and pictures for this place. I refuse to wake up in a place that looks like a room that the Adams family belongs to."
He smiles up at me and try to burry himself deeper in my side. Until Nesha crept around us to recoil herself in Dray’s hand.
“He is going to hate,” I whisper.
When I open my eyes, I see myself reflected in the deep green of Harry's eyes.
“They thing, Severus, is that it doesn’t matter what kind of fear is living inside our hearts for the longest part of our lives, the only thing that matter is for us to overcome such human thing.”
“Well, my name is bigger,” I say to him, before tugging my good hand down, breaking my own wrist with this last attempt, and the last shackles is open. “I will see you in hell.” I say to him, through my own pain.
I stand up and walk to the wall that contains the Black family tree. However, Narcissa's branch is extended to show a baby with blue eyes and almost no hair. However, below is the date of birth and next to it is also an infinity symbol.
Still, Voldemort was able to turn me into one of his horrids things.
"No one will spoil them," I say seriously. "They will not even be a Malfoy."
he swallows loudly.
I can feel a smile against my chest and I too, have to oblige to the bubbling feeling inside me. The feel is warm and so welcome inside my soul. I let him go and put distance between us. But, when I catch Draco looking at the floor with his cheeks still red, I take him carefully by his chin, obliging him to look up at me.
"Ok," he says in a whisper.
"Okay," I hear Ron mutter, as he writes the name on the board. "Next."
“Are you listening to that, young Argentum?” He hissed in a raspy voice. “This is the book that is going to give me control over you.”
"Harry, Dray," he greets us, as he sits down at a six-seat table. Someone else will join us tonight. "Did you like Hogwarts, Little Dragon?" Dumbledore asks and Dray just nods.
"Yes, Draco was happy," she says fast and hot.
“I love you, Dray Black,” I whisper against his ear and he blushes so perfectly.
Harry laughs softly. However, it is not a sound of joy. It is a sound similar to that made by a man who has been badly injured. A sad laugh.
There I am, at Eylopes Emporium, looking fondly at Dray, while he petted a venomous snake. His hand is moving in the photo, his lips saying something to the snake, while I try to keep him safe.
"Narcissa Malfoy has a family with a background, you know that?" I tell Ron, as I look at all the Black family folders I could find yesterday after meeting with Robards, one of the first things I did was take a walk through the archives of the wizarding world. "Bellatrix Lestrange," I say to Ron, as he writes the name of the woman who entered Hogwarts, in our sixth year, with the help of Gregory Goyle. She is still free, roaming around the wizarding and muggle world.
"Very much," I say and reveal a truth that only I know, because Draco told me one night after we were married. “But, your daddy didn't want anything to happen to me. He preferred to die, and give me the opportunity to live. And as I live, let the magical world also live. ”
“My jaw hurts, can’t properly open my mouth. Could cause problems while giving a blow job.”
“Great,” said Harry, rolling to one side to get at his own belt buckle. “So, trousers off.”
“Mine. I’ll apparate us.”
Draco kissed him, soft and sweet, gentler than before. Harry hummed and kissed back, one hand cupping Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s hand was on Harry’s waist, his thumb stroked smooth arcs back and forth over Harry’s ribs, careful, affectionate. The tenderness of the caress made Harry’s stomach clench and flutter. He ran his hand, flat-palmed, along Draco’s shoulder blade, drawing him closer and deepening the kiss. Draco hummed his approval and responded in kind without attempt at escalation, letting Harry set the pace. As the realisation hit him, Harry’s whole body softened, his chest loosening, skin tingling where Draco had looped his arms loosely around him, hands warm and open on Harry’s lower back. Harry let out a low moan, kissing Draco open mouthed, hot and heavy, present only to the feel of Draco’s lips, the slide and push of tongue on tongue, the murmur and catch of deep panting breaths. Was this what people meant when they talked about being in the moment, Harry wondered? Ironically, the thought brought him back to himself and he emerged from the kiss. Harry nuzzled his head into Draco’s shoulder, they were holding each other close now, chest to chest, which was fortunate as Harry felt unsteady on his feet, knees weak and thighs shaking.
“Off! Get this thing off!”. Draco heard himself shout as he tugged at Harry’s shirt. The raven haired boy pulled it over his head effortlessly and threw it somewhere across the room, to reveal miles of tanned, toned skin that was laden with scars.
“Why did you do it?”. It was barely a whisper that escaped his flushed lips but it sounded so loud as it broke the silence.
But he couldn’t.
Harry rolled onto his back. He knew Draco was right. In all fairness, he still wasn’t entirely sure how this whole thing had started. It was back at the start of the summer, the war had ended and Harry had decided to return Draco’s wand. The other boy had invited him in, one thing had lead to another and he had lost his virginity. Things just spurred on from there.
If it didn’t fix itself Draco didn’t know what he’d do.
“She said it’s completely over and they both love other people on page three”.
Medieval AU, pre-wand magic. Not explicit smut. Based off of a prompts ask.
“I’m gay”.
Then Draco fell to the floor.
“I’m not sorry for telling you, telling you that I loved you. Because I did, I still do, baby. I love you so so much, and I don’t want to have to spend any longer away from you”. Draco’s heart was pounding.
“I’m going to come, Harry, please let me come!” Draco screamed as Harry hit his prostate at a new angle. “Go ahead, Happy Birthday!” And with that, Draco came, happy and secure.
“I want to get to know you, the real you. Not the one that pretends to have far more nerve than he actually does”. Draco looked incredibley offended at this.
“Ron, what are you doing up?” His wife asked him in surprise.
“Oh.” They sat in silence for another minute before Harry put the eyeliner wand down. “Perfect” He said with a grin. Draco got up and looked round for a mirror.
“He told me he couldn’t do it, anymore, be my secret. Told me to go back to my life, and he left. I haven’t seen him in 2 weeks, I can’t find him, Gin. And that’s when I knew, I couldn’t be without him. I couldn’t keep lying. So I’m sorry, that I’ve hurt you. I am. But I can’t change it”.
Based off of two Tumblr prompts in which Harry is a bad lover (in Draco's opinion)
He couldn’t keep doing this to himself. He got up from the kitchen counter and vanished the newspaper, trying to vanish the contents from his mind, too.
“What do you mean? Did someone take him?” Draco saw the worry rush into Harry’s eyes at that moment.
Harry groaned and slammed his hands down on the counter at either side of Draco.
“I was scared that you wouldn’t want me when you woke up. That you’d regret it. That you only wanted to talk to me to tell me it was a mistake and to forget it- when I could never forget one of the best nights of my life. I’m sorry, H-Harry, truly I am. But I couldn’t bear the thought of it.” The auror’s expression softened instantly, shock registering momentarily across his face.
They were planning to go out again tonight, it was a really fancy club that they’d been invited to by possibly the gayest man Harry had ever met, who adored both him and Draco who adored him back.
After a moment where Draco felt a fool for talking to thin air, Potter’s head appeared, eyes looking back at him, clearly edging to get away. Perfect.
Draco had no sense of where to hold him, held immobile against the door behind them and forced to concentrate on the kiss and nothing else. He wanted to melt, wanted to simply sink into the warmth, the relief that he offered with his lips. Someone had to be proud of him for it; Malfoy’s lived off indulgences and dared others to deny them things, it simply wasn’t done.
“I do - just - let me look a little.”
much emotion on his face.
“Want a taste?”
. Let alone over food. Draco would say he’d always been easily flustered and rattled by Potter, but he couldn’t imagine showing
- Harry I’m not doing this because I’m not
He didn’t miss the narrowed eyes at the cock presented to the cheek, not mouth, presented to him. “Harry, what are you - that’s not sanitary.”
He blinked, and then looked up. At Flitwick’s insistence, he gripped it and tried to pull the paper apart, to no avail. Much like with the other students, Harry gave it a few taps before letting the professor try to undo the spell.
Harry was more preoccupied with the soft wrinkles decorating the corners of his eyes. His gaze swept over Draco’s face, pondering. Apparently for too long, because Draco leaned in and nipped at his lips again. “Hello, Harry?”
He almost wanted to push Harry away, jaw sore and eyes still watering but he couldn’t. Not with that
Harry continued, humming thoughtfully every so often, stroking himself leisurely. He was more than happy to let this go on for hours, as long as Draco would allow. Seeing Draco throw him impatient looks had him pulsing fat drips he wanted to smear into his skin. Let it sit there.
Draco went about his normal breakfast routine before classes. Or as normal as it could be given the circumstances. He’d gotten used to the routine by now. Get up, get dressed, and set his shoulders before walking out to the Great Hall and ignoring any stares or commentary as he sat down. Alone.
Harry wasn’t sure why he thought the way Draco ate was anything to get excited over, let alone something he could be attracted to. In fact, Harry wasn’t sure how he could think anything involving food was attractive. There was good food, sure; but before this morning he’d never had a reaction like that.
It would take more than a fleet of Aurors to knock that out of him.
But Potter - no, he mused,
yours if that makes sense.”
Harry’s hand trailed down Malfoy’s side lightly as he tilted this way and that to catch his mouth. Feather light presses against his body, but his mouth was clearly saying something else. His thumb caught against Malfoy’s stomach and he felt the other teen shift towards him, hips hitching forward.
Draco’s mind was spinning, he had no clue what was going on. He could feel Jacob carrying him upstairs but all he could see was black and purple flashes, and his head wouldn’t stay still. “What’s going on?” He slurred as they made it to his dorm. “Shhh, we’re gonna get you to bed, okay?” He managed to nod without throwing up- but felt uneasy for a different reason.
fuck you like this, Malfoy? Would you let him do all the
“I know it’s you he’s in love with”.
. Oh, what? You think that’s the first time a man has ever tried to do that to me? Men treat me like shit because of my name, because I’m a bottom or just
No, as far as the world was concerned Harry Potter hadn’t spent every night on Draco’s sofa watching muggle television and eating ready meals and takeaway, he didn’t have his own body wash in Draco’s shower, nor did he fall asleep in his bed every night.
“That’s one way to sober a party up.” She spoke in a cold tone that was obviously angry but also mixed with something else. “You saved my Draco, and I thank you for that. But you and I
“So, Mr Potter, can you tell me why you and Miss Ginevra Weasley ended your engagement?”
No smut (lots of smut in the next one!)
Draco couldn’t say anything. He just stared back at Harry. The lump in his throat felt as if it would suffocate him.
“Malfoy, what are you-“ He received no answer from Draco as he was lead out of the Great Hall.
“Tell him that I love him, tell him that I’m going to prove it, and I need him to come back to me”.
“I thought that was my line?”
“We all know she only got back with you because she’d broken up with her quidditch coach at the end of the season, mate. Besides, if you’re gay, you won’t work out anyway, will you?”
Draco pulled him into an alcove and slammed him up against the wall. “You’re gay?” He shouted much more aggressively than he meant to. The other boy’s eyes darkened before shoving Draco away from him.
“I’m so proud of you” Harry smiled, tears in his eyes as he gazed at his daughter. He kissed Draco lovingly, and Narcissa joined them in admiring the addition to their family.
“We could tell you’d been with someone, you were so happy. And then you weren’t happy, and then suddenly you were engaged to Ginny”.
“Now, get down to the hospital wing so they can fix those hands”. She smiled at him kindly as he left.
Harry searched frantically through his old trunk to try and find the map. He’d left it in here for safe keeping, but now he couldn’t even bloody find it! “Aha!” He said as he reached the bottom of the trunk. He fumbled with his wand and tapped on the map. “I solemnly swear I’m up to no good!” The map formed and his eyes started searching for Draco. Why were so many people out of bed these days? Finally he found the label that told him where Draco was.
“Fuck!” Draco yelled, accio-ing his robe over he and a red faced Harry.
yourself Potter.
that I thought
Harry admired his beautiful boyfriend, who looked so peaceful on their sofa, laid out so perfectly. He smiled before approaching him, sucking one fingertip into his mouth before jamming it right into the angel’s ear hole.
Of course, Potter couldn’t get into bed normally, no that would be far too much to ask. No, he had to jump onto the bed like he was stalking his prey, crawling up to the top, where he lent over Draco , who could feel Potters beard on his own chin. “Goodnight, Malfoy”.
She indicated with her knife for him to continue, her eyes darkening.
Goodnight Pansy”
ribs and
“What?”. Her voice wasn’t cruel, or even angry, just completely taken aback.
As Madame Pomfrey promised, Draco was our the next day. He walked down the halls feeling calm as he waltzed to his History of Magic class. All the eyes in the room were on him as he entered and he made his way over to where his friends were sat, making sure he was positioned so he was facing Harry, who had watched him the whole time he’d been in the room. Draco started right back, and raised an eyebrow.
Rage simmered in Draco at the sight of it. He hadn’t even realised he’d done it until the shatter sounded as the mug hit the floor, having wandlessly flown from the top of the box.

“Your Highness, these are the 4 men chosen that have been deemed most suitable to be your future wife, obviously it would have been easier to find more courtiers if you wanted an actual woman to be your wife, but nonetheless they are here. They will each introduce themselves to you and then we will lead on as you choose”.
“No, I’m fine, I just want to hold you you worrier!” Harry smiled down at his husband. “I can’t wait till this baby is finally with us” Harry whispered, one hand resting on Draco’s stomach. “Yes, well I can’t wait to have sex again, pregnancy has done nothing to lower my libido”. Harry burst into a fit of laughter and leaned in to kiss Draco.
“Put a smile on and get rid of that ugly scowl, you bloody brat. You are lucky to be here, that anyone wants you, got it?” Draco’s nod caused a cruel grin to form on Justin’s face.
Harry was wearing tight navy trousers, with an even tighter blue shirt that looked like it would tear if he moved too much. He knew he looked good, there was no point denying it. He liked working out and keeping fit so he could fuck Draco better keep up with his work better, being an auror was bloody exhausting.
He breathed in deeply as he heard the lock being undone, and then, there he was, his cautious face, shocked as he saw who was on his doorstep.
Harry had no idea what the noises were coming from his garden. He knew there was a storm raging, but this sounded like some sort of animal. Letting his hero complex take control, he went to see what it was.
“I just keep telling myself, pop out a couple of kids for him and hopefully he’ll leave you alone, but honestly I’d rather be dirt poor than married to him, but it’s too late now.” His best friend titled her head at him, a knowing look behind her eyes.
“Come here” Harry pulled him into a hug and Draco sighed contently into his shoulder, before drifting off to sleep.
“I love you” They both said at the same time. And they both knew it was true.
“It’s not funny!” Harry moaned.
So Draco just sighed as he read over the evening post, staring at the rock on Ginny Weasley’s finger.
“Thank you, Blaise. Not exactly language I’m used to hearing in the throne room but entertaining nonetheless”.
“Today’s been great, Harry, thank you. I was hoping we could give the other night another try, maybe? When you’re less distracted?” The ginger girl looked up at him hopefully and he nododed. “Yeah, sure thing. Gin” He was just about to make another excuse when a loud slapping sound made them both turn towards the entrance hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry fell down against the wall as he watched his friend walk away. He wished he could be what Draco wanted him to be, needed him to be. He wished he could love him the right way.
“Yes we do! Come on now, Gwain will be waiting.” He pulled Harry towards the door and they set off into the world.
“Scared?” She repeated. Her tone was getting angry.
“Draco, he’s looking over here” informed Pansy, to which Draco turned his head slightly and met the gaze of the grinning sixth year. Draco flashed him his own perfect smile before winking and turning back to his friends. “Yes, he’ll do just fine” Pansy burst into a fit of laughter at the jealousy set on Blaise’s face, who promised Draco he’d get him into bed before too long.
“I know.” Harry grinned into Draco’s shoulder, biting his claim into his skin.
“See”, Harry whispered into the nervous mans ear, loud enough for everyone to hear, “you’re nothing, Justin. And Draco deserves everything. So I’m going to give him everything, got it? You’re never gonna see him again, try and speak to him again, or even beg for his forgiveness, as you really should do. Because he has me, and has always had me, got it?” Red in the face, nodded and scurried our of the venue, slamming doors as he went.
At first, Draco was worried someone had kidnapped James, but he kept hearing giggles around their living room which meant he must still be there somewhere.
“Come for me darling, come on my cock”. And Draco did just that, screaming as he was hit with waves of pleasure, coating them both in his white ecstasy.
“There he is!” He shouted gleefully. In one hand was his invibilty cloak, and the other was James.
He took it. “Come on, lets give them some privacy.” He nodded, following her towards the stairs.
Harry rolled over to face his en suite, where he was met by a slightly damp blond who was drying his hair.
“Potter! Fuck off and let me go!” Draco cried, banging his fists at Harry’s chest.
“I want you to fuck me, fuck me until all I can remember is your name, please, Daddy” Draco’s words wavered as he felt Harry shift his legs, he lifted them onto his shoulders and he murmured the charm that filled Draco’s entrance with slick.
“Would you let
And then Harry kissed him.
Harry made his way over to Draco who had sat down on his sofa, looking rather comical in his silk pyjamas.
He had to find Pansy Parkinson. He had to find Draco.
“Stop being cute, you’re not going anywhere” the taller man said, pushing his hand down on Draco’s chest.
This movement obviously woke up the Gryffindor beside him, as a moment later an arm was around his waist once more. “Get off of me you oaf!” He drawled. Harry chuckled and pulled Draco to his side.
“Harry, what’s the guys name?” Hermione asked.
“No worries”
Draco noticed that Harry hadn’t moved and was still staring at him, but walked towards him anyway- he had to get past him to get to his dorm of course. “What the hell was that?” Spat Potter, rage flaring on every syllable. He turned to meet his aggressor with a bored, taunting look. “You have her, I want him. Get
Draco turned and looked at him then, his face scrunched in anger. “Sorry for what, Potter? Telling me you loved me? Or sorry that I’m not as much of a lap dog for you as you hoped? Did you really expect me to stay when you left me?”.
“Yes, I wanted you to stop hiding me and you decided that meant we had to split up, so we did, Potter. Don’t try and turn this on me”.
Harry slicked two of his fingers and pushed one against the ring of flesh that circled Draco’s hole. He could feel how relaxed the blonde was and how even though they must have had sex a hundred times Draco was still so god damn
He roared with anger at the crowd as he felt his magic bubble over inside and it burst out through him, knocking everyone backwards. Somehow his magic was able yo locate who has set off the spell and Harry tore through the magic to end the spell. “Don’t you fucking EVER touch the man I love. I love him! I’m not going to stop SO YOU BETTER FUCK OFF”.
“You still wear these lacy panties that I love?” He said with mischief in his raspy voice.
“Please don’t do that just because you think it’s what I want, please stop trying, Harry”.
“Well, you’re not married yet. And uh, there’s someone here who, might agree with me”. She smiled menacingly at his confused expression. “Who, Pansy? You don’t mean to say?-” She nodded. He turned around frantically, scanning the room for the man he’d fantasised about every day, and suddenly, he caught his eye, the tall, darkly handsome man capturing his gaze, refusing to break eye contact. “Harry” Draco gasped, before rushing out of his sight and to find his fiancé.
“I feel like a complete and utter idiot, I wish I had a time turner to go and fix everything I did to him. I feel as though some part of me is missing, as if he’s kept my heart and it’s calling out to me. But most of all, I wish, wish, wish he would come back to me”.
“It’s alright”. he choked out on a broken breath. He could feel they were about to reach climax and Harry against his neck lulled him into bliss. Harry’s thrusts got deeper and longer and finally Draco moaned loudly as his release spilled out in between them, just as Harry was emptying into him. The Slytherin tried to get up but his counterpart trapped him in kisses. “Draco, I love you.” He whispered, sadness in his eyes. Draco closed his own as a tear slid down his cheek. “It’s not enough”. He slid out from under the Gryffindor and started fixing himself up, cleaning up his own spunk and making sure he didn’t look freshly fucked.
.” hissed the Slytherin. A wicked grin formed on Harry’s face as he lines himself up with Draco’s hole, slipping just the head in before slamming all the way into him which caused him to howl so beautifully in a mixture of immense pleasure and pain. “Fucking
He got up and made his way over to the shower, standing under the water and letting it wash over him. He reached for one of Draco’s ridiculous shower gels and slathered himself in the smell, before getting out and finishing washing himself.
And he can’t stop looking for Harry all day, watching the boy at dinner in the great hall. And he finally snaps when they go up to the common room and just storms over to Harry, who finds it all very comical. It’s not as if he hasn’t noticed people staring at him all day, but of course he only really cared that Draco was watching him. “How can I help you, Malfoy?”
“Well, I can’t say I’ve missed having sex this past 4 months. I think I’ve wanked myself raw”. Draco rolled his eyes but agreed. “As soon as they give me the all good, I expect your cock to be right back where it belongs” Harry’s breath hitched at the thought, but shaking his head.
Draco shook his head. “I’d prefer to stand, we need to get this over-ah!” Draco shouted out as he was spelled into his seat. He glared at Harry who just continued to smile.
Harry felt himself choke up.
Harry looked up at him in surprise. “What do you want, Malfoy?” With a sigh.
He liked to get lost in the music, and some mornings he’d find himself lost in a strangers bed, but tonight as the loud club music pounded overhead, he couldn’t concentrate on anything, except for the leather jacket and green eyes that were staring at him from across the bar.

“I love you, Potter”.
Hermione nodded.
“Goodnight Harry”
He heard Potter sigh, but he got up and left without further argument.
“I can’t believe you made me wait so long! Hurry up and get naked, I need your cock in me now” the blonde whined, as he bit and kissed at Harry’s neck.
“Honestly? What are you going to tell me next? ‘The diamond in your ring is fake?’ Come on, Harry. There’s no excuse for it. You should’ve just left me, or not proposed to me in the first place. We haven’t even been engaged for 6 months, and already, you’ve cheated on me. Did you really ever think we could spend our lives together? Would you have a little background boyfriend? Hmm?” Her tone has risen, pain apparent in every syllable.
