Walking back out into the Common room, Harry saw that Hermione was already out there, talking with Pansy.  The witch said something, which made Hermione and her cackle with laughter.  Noticing the boys had come in, they hastily finished their conversation and walked over to join them.
“I must say, Mr Chumes, you are a wonderful artist.  I never understood how wizarding portraits were done, but this is incredible.”
Draco stared at the ground at the mention of the trials.  If he was being honest, he had been absolutely flabbergasted that Harry had spoken for him and his mother.  He believed that the man in front of him was the only reason he wasn’t currently being held in a cell in Azkaban.
Harry didn't know how he felt about that.  Gryffindor tower was his home.  Not being there for his last year was going to be strange.
He smiled to himself at how upset Hermione and Ron were for him.  Just as Ron had said, if someone had told him 15 years ago that he would be best mates with Weasley and Granger, he would have had them shipped off the St. Mungo’s.  Now, though, spending time with them was as natural as breathing.  And he was so thankful for their friendship.
Ron put his hands up.  “I’m just saying.”  He stood back up, grabbing his things.  “I think I’m going to head back to the Burrow.  I’ll see you?”
Harry had a feeling he had been missed something important, but just nodded at Draco and stood, following Hermione and several other 8
“Perfect.  Gives us enough time to get in one more incredible shag before you have to go,” Draco said as he pushed the thin sheet down the bed and moved to straddle Harry’s naked lap, taking Harry’s flaccid cock and guiding it into his still-loosened hole.
Andromeda opened a photo of Tonks during Harry’s sixth year, when she was guarding the school.  The photo was taken down one of the corridors, students walking around her.  Tonks was walking towards the camera when she seemingly tripped over air, tilting violently forward, before doing a small pirouette and flashing a huge smile at the camera.
“It’s about 2:00am on Sunday.  You’ve only been out about a few hours.  Not too bad, considering,” Harry smiled gently.
“Can we go to Diagon?  I saw something at one of the stalls a couple of weeks ago that I wanted to get Grandma Molly.”
“That’s right,” Draco said.  “But, I think it wise to wait to get your robes and such until around mid August.  I have a feeling you’re going to have another growth spurt.”
Narcissa and Andromeda took Teddy back to the Manor, and Ron and Hermione took their kids back home.  Harry had picked up their things that were downstairs, while Draco went and grabbed their bags out of the room.
Stepping into his bedroom, he heard light music coming from the en suite.  He paused a moment to pull off his clothes and send them to the hamper.  He pushed the door open and stepped into the bath.
He carefully turned over, Harry’s arm still over his middle, and snuggled into his chest.  He’d missed this; he’d missed his Harry.
As Harry stepped out, he realized the majority of the Weasley family were sitting in the living room, and were staring at him.
WHOA!  I swear, I did not expect to take this dang long to put up a new chapter!  21 months!  I mean, I know my muse disappeared for a while, but I didn't realize she straight up just abandoned me!  I HAVEN'T ABANDONED THIS STORY, THOUGH, I PROMISE!!!
“I know.  Isn’t it great?  He has an eye for the design of things.  Like I said before, he designed the en-suite in my room.  I had an idea, but then he came up, told me I was a blithering idiot, and re-did it all.  It’s brilliant.”  He didn’t speak aloud the words
At that moment, his stomach grumbled, and he realized that he must have slept for more than a few hours.  He got out of bed, glancing around the room at the other four-posters.  Seemed like a lifetime ago that he was here with his friends.  Finding some clean clothes lain on the end of the bed, he quietly thanked Kreacher for thinking of him.
Writing his last word on his paper, he waved his hand over the parchment to let the ink dry.  “Yeah, nearly done.  Just have to paint.  I still need to go shopping for furniture, though, so I've been putting off finishing completely.  Maybe I'll have time to do that today.”  He started to pack up his bag, noting that Draco was doing the same.
This photo was taken when Fred and George tried to put their names in the Goblet of Fire, just as they were thrown out of the Age Line.  The loop began just as they began flying through the air.   They landed on their backs, before they both sprouted long beards.  You could see people in the background, bent over themselves laughing, and began laughing even harder when Fred and George stood and started pointing and laughing at each other.  The loop stopped and then started again.  George was looking at the photo with awe, his smile widening as he continued to watch it.  He finally turned it to show everyone else.
“Don’t worry about it.”  Harry ran his hands through his hair, again, sighing.  Ron stared at him for a few more moments.
The stood like this, eyes closed, wrapped around each other, for several moments before Draco pulled back.
“Draco, then.  And please, no Minister right now.  I’m just an intrigued old man, who has a side hobby of researching wandlore tales.  I’m just intrigued by the stories I’ve heard around the ministry.”
“Hello, there,” Harry said to the bird, touching its foot. Its deep brown eyes were staring deep into Harry’s.  He noticed the specks of black on the white chest of the bird, and its gorgeous brown and gold feathers on its wings.
He looked up at Draco as he reached for the biscuit, again.  Draco gaped at him for a few moments, mouth opening to say something, but snapped shut as he looked up at the clock on the wall.
“NO.  We are getting married in two days.  I love you, and I am ready to be yours for all eternity.”  Toss.
Adelaide locked herself in her bedroom, the music blaring. She had been cruel and sullen all evening. She hadn’t done her Transfiguration homework, and when Draco chided her, she said “You were a good student, weren’t you? Brilliant at magic? Why would I want to be like you? I’d kill myself if I had your life.” And Draco had blinked a few times, the way he always did when she said things like that, feeling as if something had just hit him in the head—and he would know—trying not to show how crumbling it was to be told all the worst things about yourself by someone you loved. He got back to the lesson, she stormed out and locked her bedroom door.
Draco looked away. Harry was too handsome to ask questions like that. He made it hard to focus. Draco tried to shrug nonchalantly.
“What on earth,” said Draco. Potter shrugged, as if it was no big deal. It was so hot that if things had been different, Draco would have jumped on him and gone again. Instead, he dressed quickly, not saying a word. Potter lay naked on the sofa, watching him.
“You’re twenty-seven,” said Timothy, with the air of someone explaining to an elderly pensioner that they’re too old to operate heavy machinery.
Harry felt Draco tense.  He gently squeezed his shoulder, and felt the returning squeeze of his thigh, where Draco’s hand had once more come to rest.  Draco gave a small nod, before waiting for Nott to move away from the table, and then smoothly stood and followed him over to the corner by the floo.
This caused everyone else in the room to cackle.  Harry was trying, and failing, to keep his laughter to himself.  Ron came over to where Harry was sitting, punching him lightly in the arm.
“First you tell me you prefer me in joggers, now you tell me you like me all poshed up.  So, which is it?”
They walked a few blocks over, and came to another store.  Walking in, Harry looked over at Draco and chuckled.  Draco’s eyes were widening as he took in the mountains of pillows, rugs, clocks, and other accessories.  His grin reminded Harry of his own smile the first time he stepped into Honeyduke’s.
Harry smiled at him, pulling Draco towards him.  “Is that right?”  He leant in to give Draco a chaste kiss on the lips.
Draco laughed as they continued on down the street.  “You're right, you do have it far worse.  My poor fiancé!”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat as Draco slid off the bench of the sleigh and knelt down between Harry’s legs.  He nodded quickly, as Draco tossed the blanket over his hand and Harry’s lap.  Harry slid down, spreading his legs, and gasped as he felt Draco take him into his mouth.
Unfortunately for Harry, she was right.  He acquiesced, and so after finishing eating their pies, they all headed down the alley to Eeylops.  Harry braced himself as he walked into the store.  He saw a couple of Tawny owls in the front, with a Screech right beside them.  He glanced over at a beautiful Snowy, but knew that he could never.
Harry walked down the stairs and into the bathroom.  Taking off his clothes, he realized he was already half hard.  Who knew when the next time he would be able to have a nice, long, languid wank in the shower?  It was always near impossible to find time to himself in the dorm, so he decided to take advantage of the opportunity.  Stepping into the tub, hot water pouring down his front, he grabbed himself, bringing his cock to fullness.  He lent up against the back wall, letting his mind wander.
They didn’t talk, and maybe the fact that Harry had been antagonistic ought to have to have made it feel more like—like hate sex, or meaningless sex, or even just sex. Instead, it was sensuous and slow. Each kiss they placed on each other’s bodies felt like an exploration.
“It’s my crying bathroom,” said Draco, helpfully. “It’s where I go when I fancy a quick weep and a near-death experience.”
Harry stroked L’s shoulder blades with one finger and stopped himself from saying it. Of course he wanted to say “I love you”. He wanted to reassure L, to tell him to have faith. But Harry didn’t have faith himself.
Draco did a very bad job of hiding how hurt he was. Narcissa told him to try pretend to be in love with Harry. Draco refused.
“Oh! But that’s too wintery,” said Adelaide, dropping her rucksack and dipping her head by Draco’s arm so he could tap it with his wand. He did, and her hair went bright pink. “It did smell good, though.”
“I…” said Draco. His fingers flattened the powder through the plastic. They were trembling. He frowned. “How’ve you been?” he asked Anika.
Harry shook his head. He felt uncomfortably aware of the fact that he was in Draco's room, and that Draco probably wanted him to leave.
Depressed by the length of his failings, he had gone to the library to find a book to read. It was there that he first came across the Ship of Theseus thought experiment.
Draco’s hand was hot against Harry’s cheek. His fingers plucked something from his skin, and then he held up his index to Harry’s mouth.
Draco seemed to be battling with himself. As Harry opened the door to the house, Draco put a light hand on his arm.
, as if Draco no longer trusted that his low self-esteem was anything but what it should be. His silly banter with Teddy, and his total silence with Clarence.
“Mmmm, taking off my trousers,” said Blaise, doing just that. He stood in front of Draco, wearing only his boxers. His hands lingered over his six pack. “I’ve read your diary, don’t forget. I know I was part of your sexual awakening.”
“Yeah. Sorry I asked. God, how long can cheesy chips take? What are they doing, growing the potatoes from scratch?”
“Yes, baby!”  Harry took over, bending his knees so that he could pummel into Draco easier.  He pulled Draco’s head down so he could give him a wet, filthy, kiss.
Harry was thrown off guard as Draco pushed him back to lie down on the bed, Draco straddling his waist.
“I suppose I do need to at least have a nightcap with Mother.  I haven’t seen her but less than an hour since we’ve been back from Hogwarts.”  He lay there for a few more moments, and then, sighing, pushed himself up to stand in front of Harry.  He put his hands out, and helped Harry stand as well, pulling their bodies together into a loose hug.
? Well, then, let’s make him miserable.  I truly wish I could take everything back.  Truly.  If I knew then, what I know now…”
“Love you more.”  He hummed as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle.  “You know what is not so great about eloping?”
“Hmmm… Want to share a shower,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear.  They held hands as they walked into the en suite.
She nodded in understanding, so Harry turned and tapped the bricks, which opened up to the bustling cobblestone path along Diagon Alley.  Even with Christmas only two days away, the weather was decently pleasant.  There were high, thin clouds, which let streams of sun through, and the temperature was near perfect for that time of year.
Harry had never skated before, but had seen it on the telly, so he kind of knew what to do.  Draco didn’t have the first clue, so took direction from Harry.  It didn’t take long until they were slicing across the ice, with Teddy in the middle.
Harry was lapping at Draco’s left nipple as he started unbuttoning his own shirt.  He glanced up at Draco’s face, but couldn’t really see it, as Draco had pushed his chest towards Harry’s mouth, and had his head pressed back against the door.  A hand had reached up and was carding through Harry’s hair.
“Harry and I did the ritual,” Draco picked up, “but when we finished, we both felt a severe burning sensation in our arms.  It took a few moments of intense pain before Harry was able to release his grasp on the wand, and then the pain was gone.  The wand is mine again, and I haven’t had any issued with it, up until the day of the incident.”
Looking around the room, again, he decided to start on the wallpaper that lined all of the walls.  He used a spell that he had found in one of the books that he had bought at the beginning of term which caused the glue to dissolve, letting the paper fall off in large chunks.  The paper was still in decent shape, so he figured he would put some of it back up in Kreacher’s new nest: he hadn’t forgotten the promise he had made on his birthday.
owl.  He almost felt as if they had imprinted on each other. When the animal bent its head and nipped on Harry’s finger, he had a flash memory of Hedwig, doing the same. It was at that point that he knew he was taking the owl home.
After sitting on the sofa, socked feet propped up on the coffee table, Draco threw his arm around Harry’s shoulder and clinked their mugs together.  “To us.”
“It’s 5:35. My ring is in my pocket, ready for me to slip it on when we are ready.  And, I’m sure some people with start arriving in the next few minutes.”
Harry began thrusting with abandon.  He could feel his release growing, and knew from the sounds coming from Draco, his was imminent, too.
“Well, it was nearly shattered.  There were too many pieces to try and just fuse it back together, so they basically pulled a Lockhart on you.”
Ron’s eyes flicked between Harry and Hermione several times before he said, “Er, well, I was, er, supposed to be helping Malfoy with a project, but he owled yesterday and cancelled.  So, I figured I’d come help George out.”
Blood flowing south brought Harry back to the present.  He discretely pinched his arm, forcing himself to focus.
Kreacher appeared with more bottles of champagne, refilling glasses.  Everyone began mingling around the terrace, some moving towards the edges to see the streets below.
“Watch it, Scarhead,” Draco said with a sarcastic smirk, and not an ounce of vitriol. He grinned at Harry, which made Harry’s heart skip a beat.  “Seriously, though, lean away. I don't mind,” he added with a wink.
She turned and smiled at him.  “He is, isn’t he?”  She turned back to continue watching her boyfriend, a proud smile on her face.
He had married the love of his life, too.  It had taken a lot of atonement, but he had become friends first with Hermione.  Once he started spending more time with her, though, Ron and Harry started being around more and more, and eventually, things just fell into place.
“At least it’s Friday, and we can spend the weekend together, alone, doing absolutely nothing?” Draco asked with a small lilt at the end.
“It’s us, love.  After all the shite that we’ve been through over the years, before and after we were married, we can get through anything.  Sweetheart, please, stop.  I’m here.  I’ll always be here.  I just need you to come back to me.”
“Oh!”  Draco looked shocked at being asked to tell his story to the minister, of all people.  He glanced at Harry, then his mother and Professor McGonagall, in turn.  I, er, well, I suppose so.”
“Mione,” Harry called.  She looked over and her face lit up at the sight of her best friend.  “Give me my godson, and you go follow your husband a daughter, and get some warm clothes on.”  He held his hands out to her.
“That doesn’t mean anything in the eyes of the public.  I’m a pariah.  I’ve come to realize that.  It’s okay.  Anyway, when do you want to go shopping?  I don’t have any plans this weekend.”
But he did start talking to Hermione, after that, asking her careful questions about her work. He seemed to measure every word he spoke three times, and he handled her gently—especially compared with the effortless way he played around with Ginny. Harry couldn’t put his finger on why Draco was so cautious around Hermione. It was an uncomfortable fact that Hermione had been tortured at his house, but that alone didn’t explain it. The only thing that made sense to Harry was that Draco knew Hermione was suspicious of his changed behaviour, and thus didn’t want to expose her to it.
“Harry!” came Ginny’s voice from the sitting room. “Get back in here, you’re missing the beginning!”
Harry was pretty certain, by this point, that Draco liked him. He wasn’t sure how it had happened, given that Draco was a) gorgeous and b) sought after by the entire school as the bad boy darling of the war and c) posh as hell and d) permanently scarred by Harry’s stupidity and e) bound to associate Harry forever more with the worst experiences of his life. But somehow, Draco seemed to have developed a crush on—maybe even
it’s mad, but I can’t see why—I can’t—and you know, I haven’t the best track record with making the right decisions—”
But then he thought of that apology. They had barely spoken since then. There had been something rather fragile about Draco, that night; something delicate about his brittle jokes and swift glances.
“Oh, what do you know, your parents are dead,” said Adelaide. The twist of pain Draco felt at the words wasn’t even about his own parents: it was about all the times he had said that to Potter. Adelaide had some excuse for her cruelty. Draco had just been rotten to the bone.
They were both sitting up now. Draco was still so hard. Potter shirtless was truly a sight to behold.
“Rachmaninov, please,” said Draco, and Harry obediently went to the piano and butchered the Third Concerto with his sight-reading.
“The point,” said Draco, in a tone that suggested that he was forcing himself to be calm, “is that your little
“Even though I’ve had a shit month,” Harry went on, “it’s been so much less shit than this time last year, and
Draco sank to his knees as he read. The list appeared to be roughly chronological, beginning with Draco having apparently insulted Hagrid in Madam Malkin’s when they were eleven (which Draco could not remember) and ending with
“Yeah, well, she wouldn’t say something like that, now,” said Draco darkly. Harry looked as if wanted to ask more, so Draco gave him a tight smile and got out of bed. “Clear out, I want to change.”
Michael stared as they shut the door, then made his way out of the party, wiping his cheeks just once, quickly.
Things were getting better. Harry’s unexpected shift into politics was an improvement. It felt good—it was unpleasant, but it felt good. Like eating vegetables, or working out, or washing his hair when he was tired. He felt as if he were exercising a muscle that had grown flabby over the years.
“That you were engaged,” said Harry, because she was still looking at him. Astoria glanced at Draco, who shrugged.
Harry gave him a Firebolt. Draco unwrapped it with trembling hands and stared the sleek handle, the gold lettering on the polished wood.
When he woke up, the ward was dark, and Ginny Weasley was asleep in his arms. She had crawled into bed with him, and her head was nestled in the crook of his shoulder. Harry was gone.
Harry sat on the end of his bed again and chattered away about his life, the way he used to when Draco had been Lamorak. Draco could not help but admire the easy way Harry talked about himself. It filled silences so well, and was so comfortable. He knew it wasn’t always; knew that Harry was surly and taciturn in interviews, but that made Draco feel special.
TW: there is some discussion of suicide in this chapter, not because Draco is suicidal, but because his anxiety leads him to believe that it may be the practical thing to do
“It would remind Seamus of Dean, and Ron of Fred, and you of the worst day in your life,” said Harry.
, in terrible, rational, dooming loops. Harry sat him down in an armchair and got him a glass of water.
“You guys were literally starting secret societies and defeating the Dark Lord. I hardly think my youthful weed experimentation compares.”
“I’d have bought you a flat,” said Harry. He didn’t need time to answer, because it was all he’d been thinking about since he read the letters. “A really nice one, preferably near my house. And I would have gone to all the doctors appointments, if you’d let me. And I would have been there when you were sick in hospital. I’d have paid for childcare so you could have a job if you wanted. Or paid for you to stay home and homeschool her, if that’s what you would have preferred. I’d have taken her on weekends. I would bring her back and tell you all the funny things she said. I’d have taken pictures of the two of you together, and made her birthday cakes, and just… I would have been there. For her. For
Potter laughed again. It seemed that Potter found Lamorak funny, which was disorienting, because Draco was certain that if he had said the same thing without his disguise, Potter would have glowered at him.
Harry stretched, letting a luxurious smile spread across his face. He could hear Draco clattering around in the kitchen. The sun came through the window in rich, dusted rays, steeping the room in soundless light. Draco was making him breakfast in bed. Draco was his, for as long as Harry would have him.
Lee Jordan just hovered near, as if he wanted to tell Harry something, but he was hoping to wait until Harry was more alone to say it. And Harry wasn’t alone, because he was surrounded by people who wanted to talk to him. Draco sat a few feet away, talking to Hermione, and when Harry caught his eye, Draco smiled.
Harry’s friends continued not to mention Draco around him. Harry felt as if he was paddling as hard as he could just to stay afloat. He drank too much.
“Go on, then, darling.” Draco pushed her gently off his knees. Harry held out his hand, and she took it.
Harry waited until everyone else was asleep. Draco watched him open the curtains with an exhilarated sort of resignation.
Scorpius chattered happily about quidditch for five whole minutes before Harry could even get a word in edgeways. The boy was quidditch-mad. It made Harry’s heart ache. He didn’t really fly anymore. He didn’t really do anything, anymore.
“I feel as if I’ve made it abundantly clear that I’ll get off with you, whenever you want, for just about the rest of my life,” said Draco, then bit his tongue. As if what Harry wanted for Christmas was a sex-crazed clingy pseudo-boyfriend.
Draco’s mother was clawing at her face, and her flesh was so rotten that bits of it came peeling away.
It was one of the most beautiful places Harry had ever been to. The pond, it transpired, was a pool of frozen water in a glittering, snow-clad forest. It was silent and empty apart from the birdsong. Draco taught them a spell to transfigure their shoes into skates—Hermione insisted on doing her own, but it turned out that Draco’s charm made for sharper blades. The ice was thick and strong. Harry had never been ice skating before, so Ginny held his hands and skated backwards until he got used to it. He had hoped Draco might do that, but Draco was too busy speeding along, spinning and jumping and crowing. He hadn’t looked so well in… in years, Harry thought. He didn’t seem ill, or unhappy, or broken. On the contrary: he looked fiercely, vibrantly alive. It made Harry want something he couldn’t explain to himself.
Another house elf appeared. Despite the fact he was wearing a pillow case, he looked very well turned out.
“That works,” said L, finally. He was always shy and vague when they spoke about sex. He used evasive, euphemistic language.
Harry had a vague recollection of Hermione (code name Badger) approaching him a year and a half ago and telling him that romantic entanglements were a liability in this line of work.
“A bit,” said Ron, very casually. Hermione had gone still. They were at a restaurant on Diagon Alley. Photographers kept accosting them. “You could come round, sometime.”
To Harry’s very great relief, they were not sharing. Harry hadn’t felt optimistic about his chances of not being a massive perv if he had to share with Draco the whole year. Professor McGonagall had arranged for them to have a suite, with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a living room. She summoned them a tray of sandwiches, asked Draco once more if he was all right (“Yes, thank you,” he said, through gritted teeth), and left.
“It doesn’t help anything,” said Draco, knocking over Mirth’s perfume bottles as he leant back on his elbows. “He’s just keeping an eye on me. Protecting the masses from my conniving ways. I’ve tried telling him I’m not up to anything, but of course he doesn’t listen to me.”
“Lee Jordan told me once that George regularly has him take polyjuice potion with his hair in it and Lee pretends to be Fred,” said Draco.
Draco was unobtrusively helpful through it all. They didn’t talk—they couldn’t seem to look at each other. But when Harry blanked one evening at the pub (all the sounds blurred together and his eyes prickled and there was something he couldn’t swallow in his throat, and nothing had happened,
Did Harry know Draco better now than he had in those first six months of dating? Because he saw things that he could tell Memory Harry did not. In one memory, Harry and Draco had been sleeping together for four months. Draco was in Harry’s flat and Harry had gone to the bathroom. Draco bent over a copy of Witch Weekly on the coffee table. One of the cover stories featured a picture of Harry with his arm around the neck of a pretty girl on his quidditch team.
“Yes,” said Harry, and Draco’s gaze seemed to sharpen, to intensify. But when Harry leant forward to kiss him, Draco coughed, somehow managing to moan in pain as he did so. He shook his head.
Harry was prodded out of a deep slumber. Draco was poking him with long, bony fingers, whispering “Potter. Potter!”
“Can you think of anything like that, though?” asked Harry. “When you were younger… did you ever wish you could defend yourself, maybe?”
“Not just a drink. He wanted a bottle of rum. When I said it wasn’t safe for him to leave the flat, he asked me to go buy him one.”
“Do let me know if I can do anything else for you,” said the waitress, smiling at Draco in what Harry thought was an unprofessionally flirtatious manner.
“Is there a cure?” asked Malfoy. He asked it casually, but he was fiddling with the frayed edge of the sofa.
“I don’t know, a few weeks ago,” said Draco. He was edging backwards towards the door, desperate to get away. It was taking considerable willpower for him not to turn into a swallow and fly to France. A drunken kiss at a party was one thing, but accosting Harry in front of his
The tea was delicious. Harry tried to stay angry as he sipped it, but found that he couldn’t. Something inside him had loosened, when Malfoy told him it wasn’t his fault. Of course he knew it wasn’t his fault. But knowing was different from believing. And Malfoy, more than anyone, was unlikely to sugarcoat things to make Harry feel better. Malfoy had never hesitated to paint Harry in the worst possible light. If even
Those were the only pictures of just the two of them. The other photographs were more casual— Ginny shoving an ice cream cone into Draco’s face at the beach; Draco, sunburned and miserable, on a hiking trail; Draco, Ron, Hermione and Neville all crowded together in a hammock, wriggling and shrieking in joy. Harry looked at each picture, trying to piece it together, trying to understand. It was late by the time he gave up. He put all the pictures back in the box, the box back in the wardrobe, and closed the door.
“I feel as if I’m going to die,” said Draco, conversationally. “But that’s just part of being alone, I think.”
“He’s been hit by some kind of slow-working death curse,” said Harry. “He’s got four months. I feel terrible.”
“Please don’t leave me alone right now,” said Draco, and sank onto the sofa. “I know you’re angry at me, but please don’t.”
“And this was you doing what you thought was right? Ghosting him and lying to him and making yourself miserable?”
, nothing, and Harry broke the framed photograph of Ron, Hermione and him at Hermione’s twenty-first birthday party, and he broke the ceramic pig Luna had given him “to help with spiritual decay”, and he smashed his fist into the glass case of the curiosity cabinet.
“I’m going home,” he told his secretary. Under a minute later, he was stepping through the grate at Grimmauld Place.
“Tell me the hottest guy you see, and I’ll get him for you,” said Malfoy, his lips touching Harry’s ear on some of the words. Harry leant back to look at Malfoy, who scanned the crowd, impassive. Even if he hadn’t been handsome, Harry would have wanted to eat him up with a spoon.
“No, I… that sounds good. Yeah. I’ll come,” said Harry. He wasn’t sure why. Maybe it had just been too long since he had plans on a Friday night. Malfoy raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything.
“Yes,” said Draco. He turned to look at Astoria, who looked perfectly calm and composed. “Fuck you.”
“You literally took a man out yesterday, armed with nothing but your wits and a pair of nipple pasties,” said Harry, racing to keep up with him.
Lucius died two weeks later. Harry helped Blaise, Pansy and Theo organise the funeral. Draco was unusually quiet, smiling too much and becoming rather polite, even to Harry.
It hadn’t happened in ages. Ages and ages, not since he’d been with Draco. But the only reason Draco had been able to start dating Ginny in the first place had been because Harry was out of the picture, living on some desolate Mongolian plain.
named Rachel Farley, and had Harry write requesting an exclusive interview. He insisted that Harry wear Gryffindor robes for the picture “to reassure the reader that I haven’t changed you”. Draco wore his princely grey robes. "Politically neutral," he said. "Red would be trying too hard."
knows, and from there we’ve got three days before it’s headline news, and who the fuck knows what God-awful things they’re going to say—”
It was like the cottage, Harry realised. Watching Draco with Teddy had felt a bit like stepping into the cottage. It was a similar quality of feeling. A relaxing, a loosening. He noticed it, when he stepped out of the floo, and looked at the soothing paintings on the wall, paintings of landscapes that looked vaguely like the grounds around Hogwarts. He made his way up to his bedroom and he did not know consciously why he was going there until he was standing in front of Draco’s empty wardrobe, looking at the cardboard box at the bottom of it. He hesitated, then pulled it out and opened it.
“I didn’t…” he suddenly understood something. “Did he owl you all and tell you to leave me alone this week?”
Draco looked at him. There was something impossible in his expression, like mingled hopefulness and despair.
Harry nodded, although he wasn’t. What would happen, he wondered, if he said, “Actually, he’s all I think about when I wank.” Or, more accurately, if Harry were to tell them that he and Malfoy talked three times a week, and he’d been really helpful about Ginny, and it kind of felt like they were mates even though Harry paid Malfoy to spend time with him.
for this,” said Malfoy. He drew something out of his pocket and pressed it into Harry’s hand. Harry was so surprised that he took it instinctively.
“Yes, I’ve noticed there’s been a change of opinion about him,” said Hermione, that evening at dinner. “Half the school fancies him, now.”
“He was going to wait till next year,” Hermione told Harry confidentially, “but we decided it might take the heat off you and Draco. Anyway, we don’t want to wait.”
They were drinking tea in the garden, as they did most mornings. Harry peeled an orange for Draco, because Draco hated how the rinds felt under his nails, and passed it to him.
Timothy pulled the covers up to his chin. Harry wished he would leave, then hated himself for being so callous.
Harry called him “Draco” for the first time after that last one. He went back to “Malfoy” right away, but it
“Did you get invited to the Battle of Hogwarts Memorial gala?” asked Draco to distract him, once they were alone. It was the most fashionable event of the season, and Blaise had never yet managed to score an invite. Draco knew how it bothered him. Blaise shook his head.
“It’s good of you to take pity on a Death Eater child,” said Florian, in a carrying undertone. Harry could feel the blush spreading up his face, could see the way Scorpius had become impassive and straight-backed, like a tiny marble statue.
Hermione sent an owl to tell him when she went in to give her pensieve memories. Then Ron, then Ginny, then all the Weasleys, one by one, then Luna, then Neville… on and on it went, and still Harry did not contact him.
“I’d be so lonely without you,” Draco was saying, in a low voice, hands rubbing up and down Adelaide’s back. “I’d miss you so much. We’re family; we’re all we’ve got.”
He slept on his side of the bed. He didn’t leave his hair on the shower wall, because Harry hated that. He didn’t buy coriander even when the recipe called for it, because Harry said it tasted like soap, and Harry might come home any minute, and want to eat a curry.
He was distinctly nervous before Eve’s wine and cheese party, even though he knew Malfoy’s friends weren’t posh. But he’d gone to the movie night for Scorpius, hadn’t he? This was just him hanging out with Malfoy and his friends. Willingly.
“I don’t feel remorse!” he said, louder than he had intended. Harry took a step backwards in surprise— but no more.
“You’re very good looking!” said Draco angrily, as if he was speaking to someone who had just insulted Harry, not Harry himself.
If he could have put the words back in his mouth, he would have, for Malfoy had come into the kitchen, and his easy expression froze as he heard what Harry had said.
“No,” said Harry glumly. Draco broke free of his grasp and climbed, fully clothed, onto his bed. He drew the curtains. A second later, his hand reappeared as he chucked his shoes on the floor.
She didn’t speak to Harry for the rest of the afternoon, was sullen and distant with him. It frightened Harry—what if she changed her mind about him, told Draco she didn’t want Harry to come around anymore? But all the same, he felt he’d done the right thing. Draco needed someone in his corner.
“Um,” said Draco, sounding distractedly unhappy. “So that was, that was nice. But… and I don’t want to make excuses for myself. I messed you around for ages, I know that. But you have to understand, when Neville and I first started dating, it was all right to begin with. And then it just… deteriorated, and I realised that he had sort of despised me all along. I just, I just couldn’t stand the thought of watching you go back to loathing me, not when I was so in love with you. So I broke it off.”
“I think it’s a wonderful idea,” said Luna. She had smiled radiantly at Draco all the way through his apology, and then reminded him that he had already apologised by letter. Which was true. Draco had sent letters to everyone he could think of, after his trial, apologising all over the place. Only two people had responded— Luna and Hermione Granger.
“Youths and non-youths,” said the M.C., who had found different, inventive ways of avoiding saying “Ladies and Gentlemen” each time they came on the stage. “I now present to you, our headline act, the sublime, the sensual,
“Here,” came Potter’s voice, and Draco followed it into a dark dining room. Potter stood with his head bowed, his back to Draco.
“I just want you to be happy,” said Draco, into her pink hair. “You can still change your mind. If you don’t like him after Saturday—”
Harry wondered what Draco thought was the reason Harry “put up with” him. Harry worried Draco thought it was sex. Which would be a weird line of reasoning, really, given that they hadn’t
It was winter, and Cassie was in her second year at Hogwarts. She was, of course, a Slytherin. She was due back for the Christmas holidays in a few weeks, and Draco had already hired a muggle tutor to come to the house four days a week, because he said that the Hogwarts curriculum didn’t prioritise basics like writing and maths.
Harry didn’t answer. He drew his woollen coat closer around himself. It was black with a hood, but Harry had left the hood down, so that snow collected in it.
He hadn’t seen Potter since Azkaban. There had been the trial, of course, where Potter had spoken in his defence, the only reason for Draco’s relatively short sentence. But Draco had been too dazed to notice him then, really.
“Go,” he said, and lay back down, pretending to still be unconscious. He heard her scampering away, heard her hoisting on her girlfriend voice; “
It was cloudy in his head, in any case, because of the dementors. His mother sat apart from him, except when he was asleep. He awoke from his nightmares with the ghost of her touch on his scalp.
Draco, however, wasn’t. His eyes were wide, his mouth serious. Harry was struck once more by the morbid fear that he was somehow pressuring Draco into submission.
Once he could no longer feel his pulse in his throat, Draco focused on the parchment and read it carefully. He would not be able to tell anyone he had even seen Potter, let alone what he had sold him. Draco signed it, still not understanding. Then his eye fell on the potion that he still had in his hand, and he laughed.
“Don’t you dare touch him! You’ll hurt him! I want Nick and Eve and Flora! You just want to hurt him!”
“Well, I had to make it seem like a serious threat. Otherwise there’d have been no cause for him to move in with you. Anyway, I was on hand to rescue him! I have such a sweet little cousin in Highgate, and she very obligingly gave me one of her hairs for my polyjuice. Generally, I’m not terribly fond of small children, but—”
He was interrupted by their food arriving in front of them.  There were sandwiches, crisps, and bottles of Butter Beer and water.
Harry had done a lot of work making it liveable after the war, and it definitely showed.  There were bright colours on the walls, plush furnishings in every room, and the hard wood floors shined.
Malfoy flicked his wand and conjured a small red and green marble.  With his Seeker reflexes, he grabbed the orb out of the air before it even had an inkling of falling to the ground.  Turning away from Harry, he shot red sparks into the air, and then transfigured one of the chairs in the room into a kettle.
In my defense, though, I was sitting on an airplane, waiting to take off, and knew that if I didn't post the chapter right then, I'd forget by the time I finally got home.
Draco screamed and slammed his feet onto the bed, causing Harry’s fingers to slip in even farther.  “FUCK!”
Draco was very proud of himself that he only winced when the name was spoken.  He didn’t know if he would ever be able to hear it and not have a reaction.  It had been ingrained in his psyche for far too long.
Draco grinned as Harry pushed him out the door, rearranging his trousers as they made their way back downstairs.
encounter with another man.  Sure, he had snogged some muggles during the summer, just to test the waters, but he certainly didn’t invite them back to his and complete the snogging sessions with an orgasm.  No, that had just been with Draco.
“Okay, long story, short?  You know how I gave Malfoy back his wand before we went back to Hogwarts?  Well, before-hand, I asked Ollivander about how to properly do it.  He told me about a ritual that we should do, and we thought we did it right, but apparently something happened, because we both suddenly felt as if our arms were being licked by Fiendfyre.”
“Thanks.”  Harry poked Ginny on the shoulder as he passed her on the way to the stairs, nicking a piece of toast off her plate in the process, too.  He laughed as she swatted at him, so glad that they could be friends and joke around with each other.
She puttered around the kitchen, making the chocolate and pulling out things to eat.  She quickly made some sandwiches, and then, with a wave of her wand, everything floated onto the table.
“Dennis asked to see me, because if you’ll remember,” he said, looking over at Ron and Hermione, “Colin was constantly following me around, always taking pictures of me.”  He smiled sadly.  “So, in one box that Dennis had, there were quite a lot of photographs of myself, and he wondered if I might want any.  I’ll admit, I wasn’t too keen to look at them, but after his badgering, I did.
“I didn’t want you to worry.  I just needed some reassurance about something, she gave it to me, and we hung up.  It was nothing.”
“That’s cause your Uncle Harry is a softy and spoils you rotten,” Draco mumbled as he turned back towards the hob, out of ear shot of Harry, or so he thought.  He jumped and squeaked when Harry shot him a light stinging jinx.
Just as Harry was about to ask where they were, Draco stepped out of a dressing room, with dark ebony trousers and an emerald silk button-up shirt on.
Harry drew in a ragged breath, turning to look into Draco’s eyes.  “You counted, too?” he asked in a small voice.
He stood and took Draco’s hand, hauling him onto his feet, and they made their way up the steps to the sitting room.
“Draco, do you think if I still hated you, we would be sitting at my kitchen table, talking like this?  Don’t be daft.  No, I don’t hate you.  I don’t think I have for a while now, if I’m being honest.  I also forgive you.  Completely.  Alright?”
Harry gripped his waist, turning on the spot and apparated them to his bedroom.  He pushed Draco onto the bed, who scrambled up towards the pillows.
“Orion hasn’t been out in a while, and I needed to send a letter to your mum about the final plans for Christmas, so I figured this was as perfect a time as any.”
“So you don’t know how you got to the stoop?  Or how you rang the doorbell?”  Harry moved forward and looked at him confusingly.
“Okay.  I’ll make it easier on you, though.  Here, put on your coat, and then hold him on your front.”
“The Wizengamot has decided that the three defendants, Messrs Philip Hinde, Onyx Chalks, and Miller Rooks, are hereby sentenced to 30 days in Azkaban and 5 years of probation, with a zero tolerance for any additional misconduct.  Case closed.”  He banged his gavel once more, and stood as Aurors came to put shackles on the men and escort them from the room.
“No worries, Nev! You’re always invited! It’s that girlfriend of yours that I’ve got a problem with,” Harry said with a shite-eating grin.
He wandered the rest of the house, thinking of the changes he would like to make.  Finally making it back up to his room, he realized that it was nearly 11:00.  He went over to his bedside table, and pulled open the drawer.  Inside laid the wand that he had used to kill Voldemort, wrapped up in a piece of red silk.  Undoing the cloth, he picked up the wand and felt the warmth resonate from it.  If he was honest with himself, he was kind of nervous about giving it back.
Harry walked over to the counter as he said, “Of course I did!  You’re my mate.  I couldn’t let your birthday just slip by again!”
“Wouldn’t dream of it, but now that you mention it, I’m tired, as well.  Think I’m going to take a shower, and then go to bed.”
“Yes, and then accompany us to the Burrow.  I’m hoping that between the four of us, we can convince mother to join us, as well.  I’m sure Molly wouldn’t mind.”
Harry had again seen him the next day, in the ministry atrium.  Draco hadn’t heard him call his name, so Harry jogged up behind him and clapped him on the shoulder.  Harry was startled when Draco nearly crumpled to the ground.  He questioned him, knowing something was off, and when he wouldn’t relent, Draco dragged him into the gents and showed him a large purple bruise across his back and shoulder.
“We had tea on Friday, and we saw you both at Sunday dinner, but he seemed fine.  He was talking with George and Bill and laughing and cutting up at the kids,” Hermione said.  She looked at Ron.
A while later, Draco stirred awake.  He reached out for Harry, but the bed beside him was empty.  He blearily opened his eyes and saw that the clock on the side table said it was 8:10am.  He sat up and saw that the door to the bedroom was open.  He slipped out of bed and pulled on his slippers and robe.
They stood there looking at each other for a moment, and then Draco almost seemed to almost melt onto the couch.
“As you can see, there aren’t that many of you attending this year.  Because of this, I have mixed up the living arrangements.  Since there are just the five of you ladies, you all will be together in one room.  The door on the right will lead you to your room.”
Harry laughed, bending down to pick up his wand.  “Well, even though that was a wonderful distraction, and the fact that now all I want to do is go take a nap, how about we get some work done before Ron and Hermione get here?”  He turned and lightly slapped Draco on the bum.
Draco had the sudden feeling that Harry and he had been thinking the same thing.  He felt a rush of something, as he said, “I believe what Harry is trying to say is, will we have to inform the ministry about our bond?  Will it come into play when we have to testify before the Wizengamot?”
“Nah, you can stay.  I wouldn’t mind the company.  It’s been eerily quiet being by myself.”  He went back over to the roll of carpet, continuing to pull and roll it up.
“I'll apparate you, if you want. That still might cause a bit of a stomach issue, but not nearly as bad as the Bus.  My floo is still connected to the Manor, because I am lazy, so we can apparate to mine, and then you can floo there.”
Receiving a confused look, Harry continued.  “Do you remember second year when that bludger broke my arm during the Slytherin/Gryffindor game?  Idiot Lockhart thought he was helping, but instead of fixing the break, he completely removed the bones…”  He shuddered, and looked back down at the blond.  “That's really why she gave you Skele-Gro.  You're to grow entirely new bones.  The wrap is to try and remind you not to move it.  It's just about time for another dose, so I'm going to go get Pomfrey.  I'll be right back.”
Harry waved her off as he fed Hugo the bottle.  Draco was slightly startled to feel someone step up beside the edge of the couch but rolled his eyes when he heard the whisper in his ear, “He looks good with a baby in his arms.”
Looking at the three colours of grey on the card, Draco pointed to the colour that was in the middle.  “If you go with this one, you can still get by with a bit darker furniture, and still not have it too dark in here.”  Looking around at the room, again, he continued.  “Yes, definitely go with that colour, and don’t forget to get a clean white for the ceiling and the molding and base boards.”
He glanced up at into his mother’s blue eyes, and then taking a deep breath, said, “I was sitting on one of the beds, thinking about some things, and wasn't paying attention to my surroundings.  The next thing I know, there are four people surrounding me.  One of them spat in my face, called me a…”  He sighed, looking down at his lap.
Teddy was still fussing, though, so thinking fast, Harry started walking towards the door.  Draco moved aside as Harry walked past him.  He didn’t say anything to Draco, but as he ascended the stairs, he knew the other man was following.
The smile that was on Draco’s face, grew slightly bigger.  “Well, care to take a walk around the lake with me, then?”
Harry, who was skirting around the edge of the table to place another plate, nearly tripped over the feet of the end chair at Ron’s voice.
“I’m sorry.  Come here, it’s okay.” They both settled back down, Harry wrapped around Draco’s back.  “Want to talk about it?”
“I do,” Harry said with a sigh, starting to pace beside the bed.  “I do want to get better, and I am, I really am, but I need to know that you won’t leave me if I never get back to how I was.”
Minerva cast another spell, causing their rings to glow bright silver as well.  She smiled as she said, “By the laws of wizarding kind, and upon the completion of the bonding ritual, I now proudly pronounce you married. May your love grow for the rest of time.  You may now kiss your husband.”
Now that he had Harry’s undivided attention, Seamus seemed at a loss for words.  However, after silently conferring with the others, he took a deep breath and said, “We don’t buy this truce thing.  How could you possibly be daft enough to go along with it?!”
They both stopped what they were doing.  After a quick look at each other, they both turned back to Teddy and said, “And we love you.”
Harry gave a loud sigh, throwing himself on his bed with a bounce, preparing himself mentally for the barrage of questions that were soon to follow.
“I can't believe it is almost Christmas,” Harry said.  “I've still got so much to do on the house before then.  This weekend is going to break me.”
Harry squeezed his fingers, bringing Draco back to the present.  He squeezed Harry’s fingers in return.
And now he was leading him, and their friends, to Harry’s new favorite spot.  He was proud of himself for keeping this mostly to himself, and knew this was the perfect opportunity to share.
“Are you going to get married?”  Teddy turned the conversation, causing the two of them to look at each other with raised eyebrows.
“They will likely flip, but I’m okay with that.  Our wedding is supposed to be about us.  Not your mother, not Molly, not anyone else but you and me.”  Toss.
Draco gaped at her, but she again just rolled her eyes and said, “Dear, you’ve been staying here nearly every night for about a year.  You just haven’t brought any of your belongings.”
“When my parents died, Dumbledore took me to my mum’s sister’s house, my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon’s house.  I have a cousin named Dudley.
“I beg to differ, you know,” Harry said quietly, as he pulled Draco’s face towards him.  “I love you so much more,” he said before pressing their lips together in a sweet, sweaty kiss.
“Shit!” Draco yelled, rolling over onto his back, slapping his hand over his eyes.  “I’m sorry, Harry, for getting you involved.  I’ll be right back.”
“I have gone through everything, and have already put back the pieces that I wish to keep, majority of which had belonged to my Godfather.  Everything that is up here, I would like to get rid of, and hope that you will want some of them, or at least know of a place to which I can take them.”
“Your uncle Harry has been through a lot, lately, Ted, but I promise he is doing much better.  And he loves you so much.  It’s just taken some time for him to start feeling better.  I’m sorry, love.”
Draco cast a protronus to call the adults out to the yard, and once Ron, Hermione, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Harry, George, and Angelina were outside, he yelled, “FIRE!” and the kids started pelting their parents and aunts and uncles with snowballs.  This caused them to retaliate, and a half hour later, saw them all lying in the snow, trying to catch their breath.
Draco twitched.  “Well… this may have been… you see, I—” He cleared his throat and mumbled, “Noonehaseverhitmyprostatebefore.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, I love you more than life itself.  It took eight years for me to get over my stubborn self and befriend you.  It took three years after that for me to realise that I was in love with you, and then it took three years after that for me to realise that I don’t want to spend another day of my life without you by my side.  Will you do me the honour and privilege of being mine forever and always?  Will you marry me?”
Harry felt Draco’s channel squeeze tightly around him, which caused his hips to slam once more into Draco as he started to come, as well.  “Draco!”  He tried to keep sliding into Draco’s hole, but his hips gave out and he collapsed on top of the blond.
“I’ve missed you, too.  So much.”  Draco leaned back in for another unhurried kiss.  He pulled back a while later, sighing.  They just looked at each other for a few minutes, reacquainting themselves with their lover’s face.
Rolling his eyes, Harry carefully opened the missive. Reading the letter, Harry felt Draco move up behind him.
“Thanks,” Draco said, nodding towards the men and then turning towards the doorway.  Peering into the room, he could see several more of their classmates, as well as several people that he recognized, but didn’t personally know.  Glancing around fully, he saw Pansy standing with Theo and Greg, talking.  Harry had told him they would be there, but he still found he didn’t believe it possible.  Shaking his head, he looked for Harry.  He found him across the room; he was indeed in the midst of a conversation with Blaise and Oliver Wood.  His breath caught in his throat when he saw Wood put his arm around Harry and whisper something in his ear.  Harry smiled at him, but carefully maneuvered his way out from inside Wood’s arm, turning to tell Blaise something, laughing.  Draco let his breath release, and stepped completely into the room.  Almost as soon as he crossed the threshold, he saw Harry stiffen.
“Come on, Harry.  This is Malfoy we are talking about.  How do you know you can trust him?” Dean asked.
Draco hummed as he kissed Harry once more before grabbing a pinch of powder and stepping into the fireplace.  “See you later,” he said with a sweet smile, before swishing away in green flames.
Landing right outside the Hogwarts gates, Harry made a split second decision to send a Patronus to McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey.  Pulling the memory from the day before of their first kiss, the stag shot of his wand.  “Go tell McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey to meet me in the entry hall.”
Draco opened the envelope to see a brochure to the same wizarding resort where they had spent their Honeymoon, in Sweden.  There was a list of all the activities that Harry had originally planned, some which would no longer be feasible with it being winter, but most things sounded like absolute perfection to Draco.
He sent the packages back up to the shelf in the closet.  He sighed, rubbing his eyes under his glasses.
“Oh, shut it!  Go back to work!  And maybe I will have a special surprise for you when he get home.”  He wiggled his eye brows.
Ron stood, pulling Hermione to her feet.  The trio walked back into the lounge, where Hermione collected her gifts, said her goodbye’s to everyone, and then Ron walked her to the floo.
Harry’s alarm woke him at 7:00am on Christmas morning.  He groaned as he reached over to turn it off.  He curled back under the blanket, not too keen to get out of his warm bed.  He turned over, rubbing his eyes, staring up at his white ceiling.  He blinked a couple more times before reaching over and grabbing for his glasses.
“Yes.”  Harry once again held out his hand to Draco, who huffed and took it.  Harry tugged him up, and led him over to the closet.
The house was loud chaos, as it always was, but they were all greeted warmly by Molly, who gave Narcissa an extra hug when she noticed her, and then shoo’d them off into the living room.  Harry and Draco took their bags up to Ron’s old room, where they would be staying for the night.  The room had been magicked larger, after all these years, and now had three large beds placed in it, as well as a crib.
“Are we sure we want to go home,” Harry asked with a smile, looking around the room.  “Can’t we just stay here for the rest of December?”
He squeezed himself in between them, gripping their hands, and dragging them down the stairs to the front door.  The two adults laughed at each other, and both knew they should cherish every moment that Teddy wanted to spend with them; they knew the day was coming that he would be ‘too grown up’ to want to hang out with his uncles Harry and Draco.
Draco sighed as he nodded, and then stepped back over to the table.  Harry set his cloak on the edge of the sofa, and followed him.
Harry had turned back around to say something more, but the words died in the back of his throat as he realised Draco was standing less than a foot away from him.
“By complete accident, actually.  Like I said, I was putting some furniture up here, and I guess I accidentally cast a revealing charm and the door appeared.  I scanned it for any charms or curses, but, not finding anything, I opened it and discovered this.  It was completely overrun with weeds and trees and even a couple of pixies, but I’ve been cleaning it up when I get the chance.  Professor McGonagall helped me strengthen the temperature charm last week at Christmas, so that’s why it’s not cold.”
