Potter smiled. And
Draco simply gaped. In front of him was the biggest library he had ever seen before. The shelves of books stretched up to the ceiling, and there were so many rows just begging to be explored.
Despite the dried tear tracks on his face, Draco grinned. “Yes please.”
“There is no curfew, Carpo! I’ll come back whenever I want,” he jested, sticking his tongue out rudely and crossing his eyes.
Luckily, Harry's too distracted by the TV to notice him.
"Yeah?"
“Oh. Thank you, Mr. Potter, but I’m afraid we have to stick to the standard protocol for our procedures.”
“I strongly advice that you cease this behavior, Draco. Your little escapades will not go unnoticed for long.”
Harry’s face broke out into a huge grin, and once he finished pulling on his shoes, he kissed Draco fiercely until Draco felt his knees buckle.
Draco seems quite oblivious to Harry’s inner panic as he drapes himself over the arm of the red couch. The couch that they were meant to be sitting on together and talking to each other. Like any normal meet and greet. Not
This is the last part!!
“Potter, if you surrender now, then I shall be as lenient as possible. The police are already on their way and if you resist arrest then- “
A shout brought him out his thoughts.
He only watched intently as Apollo dragged his darling out of the corner they were in, and out of the palace entirely. He caught a glimpse of his darling’s exasperated, silver eyes as they momentarily flashed towards him. Harry froze. The moment their gaze met, he was sure that-
“How much shampoo do you need?” He asks, a hint of amusement in his voice.
Everybody on the ship rose their hands.
“Is everything else in this castle alive?” Draco asked.
“Yes, I am. Pleasure to meet you, although you can just call me Draco. Everybody does.”
didn’t know why.
“I don’t know what happened, Harry. Maybe you should listen to Hermione and see a Mind-Healer.” Draco said after a beat of silence.
"Either you move to the floor or leave my feet up." Draco says.
“Yes,
“Harry?” He turned to look at Hermione leaning on Crookshanks, who was sleeping next to her.
Draco tried to concentrate on it, but the pain from his stomach and ankle and his head were making his mind foggy.
Harry smiled and hugged him tightly.
Apollo’s face lit up. “Yay! Let’s go outside. It’s too noisy here.”
Harry fervently hoped that it was the former message.
With that, he stood up and left the room, only pausing to grab a sage and poppy seed cigar from a refreshment table. He would definitely need it, anyways.
"You're really... passionate about this." Harry mutters, almost to himself.
Chapter 2 is up! I might not always update this quickly, just so you know.
“Hey guys. What’s up?” He smiled as they sat down in front of him. As usual, Hermione had a textbook in front of her and Ron was stuffing his face with food.
“Such a unique name. Much more interesting than mine, to be frank.” Potter let out a small laugh at that, and Draco gulped. Here he was, having a polite conversation with an arsonist, mass murder, and so many other charges that Draco couldn’t even remember. It was quite surreal.
“Because I don’t want to talk to you.”
it. Well, it turns out that-
“Harry.” Harry exhaled and opened his eyes. Standing in front of him was Zeus himself.
“That is the end of the tale for now, but who knows what shall come next?” Mr. Dumbledore smiled mysteriously.
Rufus gulped as Potter reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol from his trouser pocket. He did nothing with it, but the threat was more than clear.
“Fuck Harry,” Draco hissed. “You’re going to make me hard again?”
. And Phillina had even put some warm honey in the centers that oozed out slowly and made his mouth a sweet, sticky mess.
She groaned and went after him, leaving Harry alone next to one of the numerous wine tables in the room. He grabbed one of the glasses and downed it without a second thought. It was a mix of Dionysus’s signature wine and a hint of nectar, making it sweeter.
Draco smiled softly to himself as he inhaled the fragrant scent of the scarlet red rose he had just plucked from his meadow. Its petals were still as soft as rabbit down, and the small drops of morning dew reflected the bright moonlight in broken beams. Its thorns were still sharp and curved, but Draco knew how to hold rose stems properly. He was the god of springtime, after all. If he didn’t know how to hold them properly, then who would, really?
“Here. You can have it.”
, Harry! You can’t stop me from going to Pansy’s!” Draco yelled at Harry, his usually pale face flushed and red. Harry thought he looked beautiful.
“Who’s driving?” Draco would have suggested his car, but driving a Ferrari had already caused enough ruckus around the small town. He didn’t want people putting smudges on his new car.
“Uh, no, but I can ask my dad!” She piped up, cheerfully. She opened her mouth to talk again, but she was interrupted by a much older voice.
“That
“Please may I come now?”
Draco bit his lip. “We can talk more about your childhood, and how- “
“No.” Draco sniffed. He wasn’t going to give in just because it asked nicely.
“Fuck, you look so pretty here, Dray.” And Harry was licking there again, but this time he didn’t stop, and Draco could only moan and gasp as Harry continued to eat him out. Harry threw all caution to the wind, simply laving his tongue over his hole and sucking hard and flicking the tip of his tongue and scraping his teeth against it and burrowing in it and anything and
“Butterbeer?”
*** 'O gios mou' means my son in Greek.
“What? No!” Draco said angrily.
“Answer my question!”
Soon, Harry picked up the pace and started pounding Draco into the mattress with a blinding speed that made Draco’s eyes roll into the back of his head.
“Give it
He sighed and looked up, raising an eyebrow dryly. “Apollo.”
“These are really good.” He murmured.
“I told you that I would smack you.” She grinned.
“Why should I?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. None of the astronauts on the Skeld were friends (well, none that he knew of anyways), and Draco didn’t plan on becoming close to any of them.
Someone yanked him away and Draco gasped as they landed a hard punch on Cormac’s nose.
“Harry!” Harry jumped slightly in his seat, then scowled. Gods, he hated when she snuck up on him like that.
Harry hummed at the back of his throat. “Not to be rude or anything, but I really can’t believe you convinced me to do this.”
Draco woke up in a soft bed. It took him a moment to realize where he was, and the events of the previous night.
“My name is Kore. And do you know why I’m here?”
. With
“T-thank you?” Draco stammered, tucking a strand of loose blond hair behind his ear. He was obviously wondering why Harry had bothered to help him at all. Hell, Harry
Draco’s feelings towards Potter were changing. Granger’s black-and-white view of him wasn’t accurate at all. Potter was much more complex than either of them gave credit for, if he had to be honest.

“What are you doing here? Our assignment isn’t going to do itself!” Malfoy frowned, placing two indignant hands on his hips.
“You know, you’re very cute when you blush,

“You’re really something else.” Harry smiled softly; Draco didn’t know why his heart clenched at the sight.

to get home to.”
me?!”
Footsteps started approaching the bathroom, and Draco flinched when a large hand started rubbing his back soothingly. Another one used a wet washcloth to wipe his mouth and his jaw gently, cleaning away some of the vomit that had stuck onto it.
“He cares more about the future of the family business than his actual family.”
, he's hot.
It had been over a month since the forest incident, and they had fallen into a comfortable sort of banter between themselves. Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
Harry sat in the Gryffindor Lunch Hall, munching on his pizza slice quietly. He had a Forensic Science paper to read (he already had homework on the first day of college; ugh) later in the day, but for now he was-
"Rampage." Harry replies, still staring at the TV screen. From what Draco can make out, there seems to be an extremely buff baldy and a giant gorilla.
His silky hair was as pale as dressed flax, his supple skin looked as soft as a cloud, his-
“Like that?” Harry’s voice was deep and gruff and did unimaginable things to Draco’s body.
Quietly, so he wouldn't be heard, he followed the path all the way to their bedroom. He froze when he heard faint moans coming from the bedroom.
“Is that a bet?”
There were screams, and everything went black.
"Harry?" He finally asked, taking the spoon out of his mouth.
“I’m Ron. You’ll probably see lots of my family here.” The tall boy shrugged, a half-smile on his lips.
Later that evening, Draco left their flat with Harry to go to the pub where everybody was meant to meet up.
"What do you want to watch?" Harry asks generously, handing him the remote. Draco blushes.
was feeling a bit frisky tonight.
“I’m sorry Mother,” Draco said regretfully. He ignored her pleas as he ran out the door. He mounted the horse quickly and galloped away. He stopped at the library to leave a note for Mr. Dumbledore; there wasn’t any time to chat. Once he was done, he let the horse gallop away.
Draco stomped through the seemingly endless corridors, his magic ripping all the tapestries to shreds and even destroying some of the floating chandeliers.
“I came here first!”
French. Fucking French.
Draco smirked as he watched his and Harry’s latest video. In it, Draco had stood behind the camera and started twerking once Harry walked into the kitchen as a prank.
“S-stay away from me.” Draco cursed his voice for being so wobbly. He gripped his knives tighter.
“I missed you.” Harry whispered into his ear. He gripped Draco’s bare thighs and hoisted him up, making Draco quickly wrap his legs around Harry’s waist.
Granger shrugged. “You’re annoying most of the time, but you’re a good person at heart.”
not you two.”
‘Sure. Starbucks on Main Steet?’
“Why the hell would I do that? That’s almost as unlikely as your chances of coming out of here alive, Chief. That is, if you keep on asking me these stupid- “
couldn’t hide his shock at the sight of his darling Kore staring at him with a murderous expression on his face. He was wearing nothing but a flowy white robe that the servants had probably changed him into.
He decided to head out to the back of the house, where he knew there was a large garden there. It was warded off everybody but Aphrodite’s siblings and servants. It would probably be empty.
“I’m sorry, love.”
“I’ll be in my room.” He says, the hint of a smirk on his face. Before Harry can comment, though, he turns on his heel is walks away smoothly down the hall.
Harry sighed, and rubbed a large hand across his face. Sometimes, he didn't know whether to laugh or to be exasperated with his husband.
“Spill.”
“That would be nice.” Draco said gratefully, rolling back the sleeves of the jacket so he could actually see his hands again.
He closed the bag, promising to save the rest for later, and made his way to the Gate of Clouds. However, only two of the
“Harry!” He turned his head to see Ron and Hermione rushing towards him. He smiled. They were his best friends, and he hadn’t really gotten the chance to talk to them with all the stress of moving into his apartment.
“I hereby curse every living creature in this palace into a mere household object, and you, Crown Prince, into a monstrous being. This spell cannot be broken except for true love’s kiss!” She shouted gleefully.
“I didn’t know you worked in a flower shop.” Harry said in awe as he admired the shop.
“What would you like me to do? I can do role-play, or cross-dressing if you-”
books. Harry didn’t complain though; if Draco would be there again then things wouldn’t be so bad.
to hear your moans.”
about everything he wanted to. At the moment, what was troubling him the most was the increasing number of people asking for his hand in marriage. Just over the past few weeks, several more gods had started to leave him gifts periodically in hopes of winning his heart. Not just Apollo, but even Hermes, Ares and countless other minor gods who had merely spotted him from afar. It deeply troubled him that even Ares was willing to leave Aphrodite in order to court him, and Hermes even offered him his sacred caduceus as a gift.
“Yes me, the wardrobe.” It said, exasperated. Slowly, Draco raised a hand to his head to check for any injuries. The wardrobe was
“You’re cute.” Harry repeated. “Especially when you blush.”
“I don’t need one.” Harry growled, slamming his fist on the dining table and standing up, ignoring the way his chair fell over.
Harry caressed his wand almost lovingly, knowing that it was what he needed to complete this ritual.
“You’re lucky I like the tough ones, blondie.” Right as he was about to lunge at Draco, something pushed the man out of the way, sending him into a tree. Draco’s heart dropped when he realized it was the beast. And he looked
“We need to
"Coming right up. You guys just get your seats and I'll bring your order to you." She disappears into the back room.
Harry’s face broke out into a reluctant smile, making Draco smile as well.
They soon got to the boisterous pub, which had a warm glow coming out of it. Harry led him to a set of tables in the back, where there were lots of people Draco had seen before. He only recognized Harry, Ron, Hermione and Cormac.
“No, I don’t think I will. I love the pink and blue dye you put on the ends. And besides, you like seeing my hair in pigtails, don’t you?”
Harry fought the urge to kick something. “Doesn’t matter.”
He pushed the door open and walked up to the standing mirror in the middle of the room, framed with gold. On top, it read
The comments were mixed, and Draco couldn’t tell which one people liked more. Finally, after minutes of tense deliberation and comment checking, he settled on 1.
(III)
As the light faded from his eyes, the last thing he saw was a pair of piercing green eyes that seemed to stare directly into his soul.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so crass, Harry. And just be patient, you’ll see soon.” He picked up the remote from the counter and switched on the kitchen TV that Harry had installed just for him.
(XVI)
(III)
Harry lazily fucked Draco’s arse as he came down from his high, making some of the come leak out of Draco’s loose hole with a loud squelching sound.
“Harry! I’m-I’m”
, minus the hooves and claws and horns. And teeth.
With a snap of his fingers, he and Draco were gone.
"You are an absolute beauty." Draco says to his reflection, pouting. "Nobody even comes close to you. You're just undeniably sexy."
“Please Crown Prince, I am in need of a crust of bread or a drink of water.” She begged.
“This is Draco. We’ve been friends for a while now. He always helps me find what I need whenever I come here.”
“You’ve clearly im-” Draco was cut off when his phone rang. “Ugh, who is that?”
Draco froze when he saw Harry at the door, the large spoon still in his mouth. The laptop kept on playing the movie Draco had been watching until the blond paused it.
“Yes, I’m sure.”
Also, if you guys can check out my latest post, that would be really cool. It's basically a suggestion place for some other ideas I've been having.
"No, don't! ARGH!" He screams as he launches his giant tub of popcorn at the TV. Harry's looking scared now.
Draco steeled his face into a neutral expression. He didn’t like to think that he had too much in common with a murderer. “Good night, Mr. Potter.”
The palace, him leaving Olympus, the meadow, the earth splitting into two-
“Father!” Draco yelled, galloping through the forest at top speed on the horse he had hastily taken from the stables.
He allowed the hands to pull him into a standing position in front of the mirror. Once he saw who it was, he almost fainted.
Also please point out any mistakes I've made. I didn't get a beta (we die like men.)
“Are you done, love?” Harry called out.
, gasping and moaning.
Nobody was around to hear the screams that filled the night sky.
Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and fought hard not to cry.
Harry frowned and looked at the mirror, before taking a deep breath.
“Hmph.” Draco sniffed, rubbing the back of his head.
Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. After taking a few seconds to calm himself by inhaling the smoky scent of the Underworld, he firmed his resolve and opened his eyes to finish the letter.
He looked around, and something caught his eye. There was a castle turret sticking up from the top of the trees. Draco made his way towards it. A few minutes later, he gasped. There was a gigantic palace right before his eyes. It had a massive garden in front of it, complete with dried up water fountains and overgrown hedges. Draco cautiously made his way towards the front door of the palace. It was gigantic, and it took all of his strength to open just one of them. Inside was a large dining room, with other rooms to the side of it and a grand staircase leading to the second floor.
“Please.” Harry pouted and stuck out his bottom lip. His eyes shone suspiciously.
"Draco." Harry swallowed. "What are you doing?"
“That sounds nice.” Draco replied. Since it was the first week, they didn’t have a lot of work to do.
“Hello, welcome to The Little Flower Shop, how may I help you?” In front of the counter was a tall, tanned and rather handsome man with shaggy black hair and glowing green eyes, hidden behind circular rose-gold wire frames. There was a tribal tattoo sleeve on his right arm that highlighted the slight bulge of his biceps.
“You can walk?” He asked incredulously.
“In a minute. Let me just…” He siphoned some dark magic from the depths of his robe, before flicking it onto the woman. The ribbons of dark magic wrapped around the woman, and the three kings started to sit straight in anticipation.
“You’ve already paid me for them, you idiot,” Draco managed to say. He could feel his cheeks heating up from Harry’s unexpected gesture.
To his immense annoyance, Malfoy tsked lazily and twirled a long pink strand of his hair. A rather garish shade of pink if you had to ask Rufus.
“Yes. This time it’s a planet called Alpha. They are similar to East Roamers, but are much worse. They’ve even set up another planet as a base.”
“Ow! What was that for?”

Before Potter could speak up, Cedric interrupted him.
"I mean, you have a fucking Ferrari. You're rich. Ilvermony is like an average town. Hogwarts is even more average."
The soft glow of the early morning sun shone on all the gold bricks and outlines of the square, reflecting broken beams of golden light that made it look even more ethereal than usual.
“Yes, and they agreed to teach me. It will take some time, but I’m sure I can master it.” He said sweetly. His mother smiled brightly at him and leaned down to give him a soft kiss on his forehead. Her blond hair brushed his forehead. It smelled strongly of freshly baked bread, for some odd reason.
Most of the other prostitutes were quiet, which was fine with Draco. He wasn’t one for talking anyways. He knew their names, but that was about it (Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Justin, Blaise and lots of other people he couldn’t bother to think about now.)
“Draco. We need to leave now,” Harry cut in, looking at Hermione sobbing on the floor with no emotion. It made Draco shiver.
“Good morning, Mr. Potter.” Potter cocked his head to the side and observed Draco for a long minute, before nodding to himself. For what reason, Draco didn’t know.
Draco nodded.
“Good evening dear.” His father, Lucius Malfoy announced from the kitchen. Ever since his mother had gotten sick, he had taken over the kitchen duty for her.
Harry smiled faintly. Even as a feather duster, Hermione was still an intimidating force.
After a minute, he kept on walking quickly, trying to look for familiar surroundings. Soon, he found what looked to be the kitchens. There were many animated objects at work, but Draco pushed his way past all of them. He grabbed a satchel from the wall and started stuffing it with anything he could get his hands on; apples, small loaves of bread, jams, knives. If he was leaving, he might as well be prepared.
And Harry didn't regret it for one second.
!” With a roar, the villagers stormed the palace.
. I’ll just pine from afar.” Draco sighed dramatically, laying a hand against his forehead.
Draco grinned so widely his cheeks hurt. “Love you, Harry.”
“Why not?” Draco asked. Sure, his tunic and trousers were simple, but it was just
It didn’t happen often, but sometimes Harry got into an unpredictable rage. Draco couldn’t blame him; it was only a result of his past trauma. He was careful, but he wasn’t scared of Harry hurting him. Harry had slapped him once, but he immediately snapped out of his rage and begged Draco to forgive him for the entire night until he had cried himself to sleep in Draco’s lap. But that was only once, and Harry had promised not to again. And Draco believed him.
“Hermione I- “
. Harry would guide him/
Anyways, he digressed.

Draco stared for a moment, before cautiously making his way towards the velvet chaise lounge. He sat on it tentatively, instinctively relaxing on the soft material of the chair.
Harry smiled and released his chin. “You’re pretty cute when you blush.”
Potter smiled at him again, which made his insides feel funny. “Whatever you want, Doc.”
“Don’t worry, love. You’ll love it.”
be overbearing sometimes. I hope I don’t annoy you too much.”
“Um, hey.” He replies sheepishly. “I’m Harry Potter.”
He repeated the mantra several times until his breaths slowed, and his mind settled.
"That was
As he rubbed the honey mixture onto his face, he pondered idly about the party itself. Aphrodite would definitely overdo it, as she tended to do, but there were a few, ridiculous rumors going around that she had managed to invite to invite the God of the Underworld
Once the last piece fell out, there would be no going back.
"Shut up."
Draco smiled to himself as he swept the floors of the now closed shop, replaying the interaction between Harry and him in his head over and over again. He was just so
“Should I do 1, 2 or 3?” He laid each of the outfits on his bed and held the camera up to show each one.
To say the least, Draco did not have any sort of good relationship with any of the field spirits. Or the forest nymphs. Or the water fairies. The list went on and on. They all complained that he was too ‘arrogant’ and ‘selfish’ to relate with them well. How was it his fault that they were all too stupid to understand what he was teaching them? Not everybody had the patience of Hestia, especially not him. That was one (and most likely the only) thing he and his mother had in common.
“How much is this?”
“Sleep, love. We have all the time in the world.”
?” Draco shivered; his mother’s voice was eerily quiet. She had dark red hair put into a painful looking bun on the top of her head and was in a clean cut iridium dress that stopped at her knees.
To his surprise, Potter pouted and walked up to the clear barrier. Draco knew that the glass could endure thousands of tons of brute force, and there was no logical way that Potter could break it, but he still took another small step back.
The beast led Draco to a seat at the end of the table, where he sat down, quickly removing his arm from the beast’s. It quickly turned away, although before Draco could have sworn that he saw a flash of hurt in its eyes. He didn’t know why this made his stomach churn.
“Isn’t it weird to drink from you?” He asked. The left side of her cup raised and dropped, which Draco took as a shrug.
would also like an explanation is he was suddenly kidnapped and trapped far away from his home. Well, not that anyone
The two of them looked quite ashamed of themselves.
He sped through the hedges as fast as he could, the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He ran and ran, not even stopping once he reached the forest.
“Harry,” Draco whined, bucking his hips.
Harry ignored the pleas of Ron and Hermione as they tried to convince him to get away from the mirror.
“My Lord?” King Rhadamanthus asked, sinking back into his chair.
Xenon was the name of the planet that Harry was from, although he usually shortened it to X for some weird reason.
“Talk?” Draco rose an eyebrow. “You mean dirty talk? I could-”
Harry muttered to himself, and Draco sighed as he lowered his gun. “Fine. But only for you, love.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at that. At least, Draco thought he did under the face mask.
"Walter Mabry looks
“That would be six drachmas,” she said absently, moving to the back of the stand to bring out more cakes.
As he made his way through the long, bare streets, he let his mind drift to other events. Like Aphrodite’s party. He honestly couldn’t even remember why she was hosting it in the first place, but Aphrodite seized any chance she got to hold parties, so he wasn’t surprised. As usual, all of the gods on Olympus were invited, as well as several nymphs and elemental spirits. Her parties were always the most lavish out of all the Olympians’, and Draco was expecting at least a thousand people to attend.
“This should hold until I get a bandage. Please don’t move them or they’ll bleed more.”
Or perhaps, something more.
“Draco Malfoy.” He replies. He holds out his hand. Harry stares at it for a moment, then quickly shakes it. Harry’s hands are calloused and strangely warm, as if there’s a flame inside his hands.
Draco scowled. “
Before he could speak, the beast spoke up.
“Huh?”
Harry kept quiet for a full minute before he spoke up again. “Thank you for your time Zeus. Please leave me be now.”
doing desk work.
(VII)
Draco smirked and walked up to Harry, making the skirt hike up even more, although a bulge was already forming in the middle.
“Why can’t I go to the west wing?” Draco challenged, his tone haughty.
He pushed Draco onto the desk and cast a quick wandless spell that bound the blond’s hands with a silk tie. Draco whined and wriggled around a bit.
Instead of answering, Harry sidestepped him yet again and started to hum as he continued down the hallway. And yet again, Kore stepped in front of him. Some violently red flowers were starting to bloom on his robes, and Harry became even more endeared with him.
The lady instantly tried to backtrack, but Draco pushed past her and stormed out the way she had come in.
Most likely it was his savior complex.
"Stop!" He murmurs to himself. Once he gets started, he would get
Harry had fallen asleep in front of the TV, so Draco had had to half-support and half-drag him to his bed. It was rather hard, because Harry was quite muscular and practically his height. Draco had tried to ignore the way his heart pounded when he gripped Harry’s biceps.
“What’s your name?” The man asked. “I’m Cormac.”
Plus, he was cute too.
Draco hid behind a pillar, watching as the beast walked out of the west wing. He looked strangely happy for some reason. Whatever was in that room, Draco mused, it must be important. If he played his cards right, he could get whatever was in the room and use it to bribe his way out. Not exactly a perfect plan, but Draco was desperate.
“But-”
“What do you want?” Draco asked, bravely. The monster laughed, its deep metallic voice booming around the castle.
“Dr. Granger, you used to work with Draco Malfoy, before he disappeared with Harry Potter. Did you notice any strange behaviors from him?”
Harry’s pace quickened, and the tears in Draco’s shiny eyes began to spill over onto his face. His hard cock bounced up and down as Harry kept on pounding into him like a wild animal, not even slowing down or stopping at all. He looked absolutely debauched, and Harry reveled in the thought that only
As he walked away from Potter’s cell, Potter said something that made him inadvertently freeze in his tracks.
The Mirror-Malfoy was sweeping the floor of wherever he was, completely ignoring Harry and his dilemma. Then, he turned around and bent
“Good morning, Doc,” he smiled.
Soon, its over.

“Perhaps handcuffs, or a paddle, or-”
“Well, I’m gonna check out the Thriller Section now. How about you and Draco take a look around?” And she scurried off before he could object, the traitor.
“I’m your brother, Harry, not your servant.”
When Draco found the nearest lavatory, he immediately went in and locked himself inside. He leaned against the door, taking a moment to catch his breath. And to

Harry faltered. “Excuse me?”
“Leave! Please leave now!” His father begged. His voice was coming from a tiny set of stone stairs hidden in a corner. Draco ran up them until he got to the top.
Only the wealthy owned trees. To even see one was a luxury, not to talk of breathing its pure air.
Draco scoffed. “Apollo is harmless, mother. I know how to handle him if he crosses the line. And please slow down, my new robes are getting wrinkled even more!”
Harry smiled at him. “Then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if I do this.”
As Harry was recovering, she marched up to Draco and ripped the blanket away.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then you may kiss the groom!” The crowd cheered as Harry cradled Draco’s face and kissed him with all the love in his heart. Draco responded just as eagerly.
“Stop!” Draco barked. The two of them quickly shut up and turned to face him.
Draco inhaled Harry’s scent and sighed. He smelt of old wines and red apples and a myriad of other pleasant smells that made Draco’s heart flutter.
Harry manages to gather his frazzled nerves and tentatively walks up to Draco, who is raising a mildly annoyed eyebrow. He gulps once, twice, three times. The man’s arse is quite lovely, if he had to say so himself. It’s round and plump and-
“Love you too.”
He tsked. “Hmm, fine. I’ll let you come, but only after I’ve come inside you. Deal?”
“I’ll keep that in mind.” Harry said, though it looked like he had no intention of doing so.

“Good morning, Kouroi. How are you?” Thallo smiled warmly.

“Anyways, let’s get you dressed up!” Pansy squealed. Before he could react, she shuffled towards him and threw all the dresser doors open.
“She’s alright, but she never does anything when my dad acts like a dick.”
“So, you guys,” He started conversationally, flopping onto his bed and holding his phone above him. “Have you seen this tiktoker called theGoldenSnitch? Like, he’s
Draco immediately sat up from the chaise. “Harry, I’m sorry but I can’t- “
Harry’s green eyes flashed and turned red.
“Please work.” He whispered to himself as he twisted and pushed the pin around.
“If that’s all, then I might as well take my leave,” Draco sighed, putting the note back into his pocket. “Mr. Potter, please try to remain in your cell at all times or I will have to report you to the security personnel.”
“I am.” Harry smiled.
Harry grinned into his neck as he nipped sharply. “All the better to pull you back with while I fuck you into the mattress.”
“Move back.” Draco says. He fishes around in his pockets until he gets the car buttons. He presses one, and the doors of the Ferrari start to raise up and outwards, like a butterfly’s wings. Harry looks like he’s about to melt into a puddle of amazement. Draco gets into the driver’s seat, and ushers Harry in. Harry, still dazed, enters into the passenger seat.

All in all, he looked interesting, and a collab between them sounded cool.
close for Harry’s liking. Harry clenched his jaw as he saw Apollo’s grip on his darling’s waist tighten ever so slightly. That unfortunate little wretch. He bit the inside of his cheek and calmed himself down. If he acted out now, he would ruin his entire reputation just because of
The next morning was devastating. Zacharias had been strangled to death, and the words ‘snitches get stitches’ was carved into his arm.
Slowly, over the course of the next few minutes, Harry pushed in the rest of the two fingers until they were fully embedded in Draco’s arse. He curled his fingers upwards in search of that special spot.
“Let’s get out of here.”
“I can’t
"Um, me."
They were going to kill Harry.
The three judges nodded, and Harry smirked to himself. However, before he could move on to the next soul, the woman shook herself in the guard’s hands and began to
Now, all the ground was made of plated metal sheets, with a few clumps of green grass peeking out of the cracks here and there. Animals had been kept in zoos and laboratories, bred at an inhumane rate just to satisfy the hunger of the human race. Plants were kept in reservoirs and preserving parks. Everything now was cold, metallic and emotionless.
“Fuck off!” Draco shouted back.
“This is amazing.” Harry gaped. Draco blushed a little.
Granted, the third one is really short but who cares?
Harry’s grin turned dark. “It’s something I’ve been working on recently. I call it the Cruciatus Curse.”
“How are you now? And don’t say you’re fine because I know you’re not.”
He sighed and shook his head lightly. He came here to escape from everything, not to brood. Besides, it was daybreak was just in a few hours and he would have to leave before his mother discovered that he was missing.
Draco shook his head again.
Draco smiled and rolled his eyes at the three of them. “I promise I will. I’ll see you three later!”
Harry was standing in front of the window, twirling a purple revolver in his hand.
He held the phone up to his face and smirked. “Don’t worry about their feathers; it’ll wash out easily.”
“Where is the weirdest place a fan has ever asked you to autograph them?”
“So, how’s the thing with Blondie going?” Ron asked nonchalantly, leaning against Harry’s vanity mirror.
He started with raspberry jam. He spread it on a slice of toast. Once he bit into it, he nearly moaned out loud. The jam was sweet and tart and thick, and the bread was warm and crispy.
He flicked his wrist and wordlessly lit up the lavender candles that dotted the place (although they were particularly saturated on the front counter). There were a fairly new development and had only started when Potter became a regular customer to his shop. Not that he did it for Potter, of course. It was simply for his own pleasure, as he very much appreciated the scent of lavender in his shop, thank you very much.
“What’s wrong with him?” Draco whispered, horrified.
“So? That doesn’t prove anything!”
“I agree with what Zach said. Harry is suspicious. And Zach

He didn't move as the beast cleaned the blood off of his palms and wrapped his hands in a sterile white bandage, pinning it together with an iron clip.
Now, in the year 3264, things were as advanced as ever, with robots now outnumbering humans on the globe. The population of humans was slowly declining, and Draco knew that extinction wasn’t too far off. They had gone from a massive ten billion in 2050 to a meager fifty million now. A couple more centuries and they would be gone.
Theo was dead.
love." Harry said meaningfully. Draco blushed.
And waited.
“I’d rather not. Potter.” Draco replies. He's made it a habit to call people by their surnames. It's just how he is. Harry chuckles.
“Who?”
Harry was wearing the same outfit he had worn for their first breakfast, only now the shirt was buttoned up so his chest hair didn’t peek through the top.
Draco waved his hand and magicked his quill to start writing down the order on his logging journal. “How many of each?”
And as confused, but delighted shouts started to fill the castle (no doubt everyone waking up from the curse) Harry swept Draco into his arms and kissed him again.
“How are you, father?” He hugged him. “I got some fish for us, and Mr. Ollivander knocked off half of the price!” He said excitedly.
The tears blurred Draco’s eyes as he started to cover up the wounds with the cloth.
Several comments agreed with him quite fiercely.
similarities between the two of us, Dray."
. He stepped even closer to the man than before, his cattle skin sandals making the leaves beneath his feet crunch noisily.
When the moon started to wane in the slowly-brightening sky, Draco sighed bitterly. It was time to go back already. If he had his way, Draco would choose to remain in the fields for eternity, simply picking flowers and watching the sky fade and morph into bright, beautiful colors. Alas, that wasn’t the case, and he didn’t have a choice in his situation.
Ten seconds later (or ten minutes, Draco couldn’t tell) Harry let up, smiling when he saw the string of saliva that connected their lips together.
“Yeah?”
“They can’t stop me now, my love.” Harry murmured to his lover, relishing in the muffled sob it brought out from Draco.
“What are you doing?” Harry nearly shrieked, blushing.
“When did you hook up with Demeter?”
He grimaced as the creaking sounds in the next room (he refused to acknowledge the moans and grunts that were growing in volume) started getting faster. And louder.
“Free of charge. Don’t worry about that.” Draco said, offhandedly.
Agoraki mou: my boy
“What happened?” She asked fearfully. Draco could only shake his head sadly.
All was well.
Unfortunately, Draco couldn’t just summon the potion because it was in the back room. If he even tried to magick something out of there, it would probably crash into other things and he would end up with all of his extra potions on the floor.
Cedric sneered quite fiercely at him. “So? I’m asking him for

, Draco was happy. He had Harry, and he admitted that he was actually in love. Suddenly, the prospect of a future alone seemed so sad.
He dragged Draco outside by his arm. However, as Draco walked out, he could have sworn that he saw a sharp flash of green in his side vision. When he turned to look at it properly, it was gone.
Draco shook his head. “It can’t be Harry. I know it isn’t.”
“How are you dear?’ She asked worriedly. Draco smiled.
horses) rose out of the ground. The only person in it was a large figure, covered completely in black iron armor.
Draco demolished at least six slices of toast before calming down. He ignored the curious stares of the beast from across the table. This was some of the best food he had ever tasted, and damn him if he wasn’t going to enjoy it.
could sound disdainful.
“Sure.” Draco blushed. They quickly exchanged numbers before setting off to Harry’s car. Since Harry had offered to drive him back to his house, Draco hadn't bothered to call Dobby.
Draco blushed harder and nodded. As he turned around to walk inside the house, Harry took a moment to properly ogle his arse before he walked back to his car.
“It’s just me.” Draco spun around and realized that the wardrobe was
“Let me escort you back to your chambers.”
“So we can push up the honeymoon.”
As a last act of remembrance, he lowered his head and kissed Harry’s cold lips.
Draco sprung up from his lap, quivering out of excitement. He followed Harry to the dining room and gasped. It looked…
The atmosphere had changed since Draco had left. Harry hadn’t even realized how much life the blond had brought until he left. Now, everyone was preparing for the curse to finally become permanent. Nobody had any reason to smile anymore.
“Thank you, I guess.” Draco rose an eyebrow at the gift. As far as mirrors went, it was very beautiful -the gold border of it was encrusted with sparkling diamonds and glittering emeralds- but it was just… a
“Fine. But you must take his place.” It growled.
“Shut up!” The last thing Draco saw was the swinging of a large fist towards his temple before everything went black.
The golden doors were open, and he slipped inside. He stopped in his tracks for a moment, just taking in the scene in awe. There were brilliant rainbows raining down from the ceiling and several corners, lighting up the dark room and coloring everybody’s faces. There were hundreds of people; some at the wine table, some on the railing of the second floors, waving and chatting happily; some even flying and hanging from the chandeliers. Loud, jaunty music blared, most likely from the satyrs and the dancing faeries in the middle of the room. It was chaotic, and Draco absolutely-

Draco felt his face heat up, and he looked away. “Oh, I’m coming!”
“Nice to meet you, Draco.” Harry said, flashing Draco his best smile. All the blond did was raise an eyebrow.
Lucius found himself trudging slowly towards the castle. He didn’t believe the rumors at all and was not scared easily. Besides, if he stayed out any longer, he would surely get mauled or eaten up by feral wolves.
Draco let his mind wander as he rubbed his specialized face cream onto his smooth skin. He wondered what it would be like if Harry carried him.
Rufus Scrimgeour cursed through his teeth as he struggled in the restraints that tied him down to a rusty iron chair. The same chair he had been stuck on for the better part of an hour. His backside was aching, but that paled compared to the fear he was feeling at the moment. And the disgust.
Of course, he didn’t
sick, and so far nothing had managed to cure her ailment. She was getting worse every day, and his father was beside himself with grief.
Draco was willing to do everything it took to survive, even if it meant sacrificing the whole human race.
“Harry?” Harry turned his neck to see Ron hop his way into his room, with Hermione and Crookshanks trailing behind him.
“What are you making, love?”
“Oh no, I don’t think I can sign anyone else’s arse.” Harry laughs. The audience groans a bit, but Harry ignores them. “Well, maybe, if the owner of the arse is up to it, I’m up for renewing the link. Maybe they could DM me with proof?”
?” Harry turned to see Draco standing at the entrance of the courtyard, staring in shock.
“Still?” Mr. Dumbledore sighed. Draco laughed at his exasperation.
“This will blow up in your faces. You have
“You thought
Draco winced and clutched at his middle. He watched helplessly as the man licked at the stab wound, which somehow closed the skin over it. Once he was done, he turned to Draco.
“Good morning.” Draco mumbled, looking away from its piercing green eyes. They were cold and calculating and made him shiver.
Harry shook his head nonchalantly as he straightened out the stack of parchment in front of him. “I’m alright. Just terribly bored.”
, but he obviously couldn’t let Potter know that.
"There were?" Draco asked, holding the laptop tightly while he shifted onto Harry's lap. Harry bit back a moan when his arse wiggled against his crotch.
,” Harry purred. Hermione looked as if she was going to faint. She opened her mouth to speak, but instantly Harry’s hand shot up, pointing the gun at her forehead. She closed her mouth promptly.
“Flirty?” Granger’s sharp tone made Draco squirm in his seat.
To his surprise, Harry starts laughing. His laugh is deep and it makes Draco shiver.
Harry couldn’t even breathe. He could only watch as the man cupped his hands and allowed a pure-white butterfly to land gently on his milky-white palms. The butterfly nuzzled into the man’s soft strokes against its spine, waving its antennae happily. The man laughed softly, his tinkling, melodic voice losing itself in the breeze and drifting all the way to Harry’s listening ears.
“Guess what happened?” His father laughed.
“Excuse me, Granger.” He shot up from his chair and walked out of the room as quickly as he could.
“Hermione, I really don’t need a lecture now. Please.” He added as he saw her open her mouth to start ranting again.
Draco knew that he should be more worried about how Potter got into his office–and even tell somebody about it–but instead he tucked the note into his pocket and took one last sniff of the rose before leaving his office once again.
“Tia. How are you?” He smiled, squeezing her hand fondly. Out of all of his horrible siblings, she was the only one that he genuinely liked. She was kind, beautiful and all together a wonderful person to be around. A much better person than
“No. What is it?”
"Why are the reviews so low?" He demanded. Before Harry could stop him, he summoned his wand and flicked it at the computer screen. Sure enough, the ratings from the movie critics went from mediocre to the absolute best they could be.

And Harry knew that Hermione was right. He could

Draco bit back a grimace. Practicing with his mother meant several hours of intense concentration, staying in the hot sun and generally feeling miserable.

“After the war, the Prince became a delinquent from his grief and became very selfish and arrogant. His behaviors were noticed by a sorceress, who cursed him and all of the people in his castle. Nobody knows what the curse was, but none of the people who were in that castle during the ball have been seen since that day. That was three years ago. Since then, strange sounds have been rumored to come out from the palace at night, and some claim to have spotted figures moving in the window, but none of these have been confirmed.”
“Draco.”
“Yep.” Harry stretched and leaned back into his seat.
He smiled when he thought about Draco. They had been married for five years now, and they were still as in love now as they were when they were twenty-five and newly-weds.
Embarrassingly, Draco whimpered. The sound seemed to spur Harry on, who immediately started taking off Draco’s trousers and pushing his lab coat up his back.
“My parents,” Draco murmured, clutching the mirror tightly.
He did stop, however, when the toe of his boots got caught in some thick tree roots that stuck up from the ground, making him fall over. He groaned. He tried to free his ankle from the roots, but not only was it stuck but it also sent sharp spikes of pain up his leg.
Harry was entranced. His little darling looked
He barely had time to run into the bathroom before he threw up into the toilet, crying and heaving into the white porcelain.
“Figures. You don’t seem like the type to really care much for personal hygiene.” He smirked as Harry glowered at him in the mirror.
Draco nodded and held his knees close to his chest.
Draco smiled back and sighed. “Sorry about that. Anyways, here are the potions. Is there anything else you would like?”
Hopefully, they would be handsome too. If he was going to get fucked, he would at least prefer someone hot. But old and rich worked out too. As long as he got the cash.

“Father!” He yelled. He didn’t care about himself anymore; if his father was here he needed to save him.
“What are you?” He asked, cautiously.
“Am I wearing a

When he finally arrived at the mansion, he sat at the front door step and breathed in the fresh air. His legs were aching a bit, and-
“Better luck next time, pet.”
“Well, he-” A large blast suddenly filled the air, making Rufus jump in his seat (and let out a girlish scream, but nobody had to know that). However, Potter and Malfoy remained still, as if they had been expecting it.
Eventually, the man caught up to him. He grabbed Draco by the hair and yanked him closer. Draco screamed and stabbed at the man’s hands.
In the half-visible, he could see his parents, his friends,
“How are you, love?” Apollo crooned. His grip on Draco’s waist tightened ever so slightly.
Harry got a small ball from his pocket and threw it onto the ground, where it let up several large bursts of purple smoke. Draco heard Hermione’s coughs and screams, but all he could focus on was Harry grabbing his waist and pulling him away. Away from the life he had created for himself.
Next was the olive oil. It was warm and freshly made, and he poured a generous amount from the pitcher into his hands before he rubbed it onto his face, over the honey. Normally, he would wait for it to set by itself, but there wasn’t any more time for that (thanks to
Damn her.
“Whatever,” Draco muttered, sipping his tea. “It’s alright.”
It was an hour before they were meant to meet, and he was recording a live stream to ask for help with his outfit advice and his gay panic.
He ran a hand through his hair and floated out of his room, humming idly. He went all the way through the large palace until he reached the grand front entrance. The sun was almost out of sight, and he could already see the moon starting to rise in the sky. He held back a groan. Apollo was definitely going to be at the party, then. While Draco admittedly
Before any of them could react, Cedric sank his sword into the distracted Harry’s chest.

Harry stood up quicker than lightening, and before Draco could process it, he felt a cold mouth press against his and-
She shrugged and pushed back her short, lead-colored hair. “I’ve been alright, although I’ve been meaning to come here for a while. It’s been a while since I’ve sold any ambrosia cakes this season.”
“I’m the teapot.” She said helpfully. Draco turned to look at her and saw that she had eyes and a mouth carved in, just like Pansy. Then, he realized that everything on the cart, even the cart itself, had eyes and a mouth.
Draco grabbed his phone and went over to his wardrobe to pick out several spray painting cans. Then he ran outside to the front lawn of Malfoy Manor where several albino peacocks were preening in the sunlight.
of Calming Draughts. He had saved a few vials for Potter, just in case of an emergency.
When Harry’s eyes flickered open, it was already daytime. The sun was shining bright in the middle of the sky, and-
Draco was about to file out his paperwork when he noticed a small vase on his desk. It was white and narrow, and in it was a single red rose.
“Your welcome.” He said, snatching his hand away and darting back into his room before the beast could do anything
“I’m sorry for being rude.” It huffed. “Would you please come down for breakfast?”
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco rasped, his voice hoarse. It was their third round of the night, and he hoped that Harry was finally drained.

“Yes, Harry. Besides, getting rid of Scrimgeour once and for all would be nice.”
Harry was already smitten with Draco. He was the perfect mixture of cuteness and chaotic energy.
“Alright. See you then.” He cut the call.
Second chapter ;-;
!” Draco shrieked.
“Is that a Ferrari?!” Harry exclaims. He runs towards Draco’s car, and admires it fervently. Draco appreciates that he doesn’t actually touch it. “Holy shit. I wonder who it’s for.”
“Yes, you will.” It growled.
“Whatever. Have a nice day, Phillina.”
“No more words from you tonight,” Harry murmured. He flipped Draco’s skirt upwards and was greeted by the sight of Draco’s rising erection, partially trapped by the hem. He pushed it up and watched with glee as Draco’s erection sprang up and bobbed against his stomach.
. His brain was moving at thousands of stadia per second but the first thing that he processed was the amount of
But Draco had Harry, and he had love. And that was all he needed, really.
“You’re probably not from around here, then. It’s a normal thing around this area.” To Draco’s surprise, he shrugged his jacket off and handed it to him.
He rummaged through his pack and brought out a tea cloth he had packed with him. He managed to snap off a nearby twig from the tree and had soon fashioned himself a makeshift splint. It was very crude, but there was nothing else Draco could use for the time being. With a groan, he pulled his foot out of the roots, wincing as the movement shot spikes of pain down his leg.
The stars looked especially beautiful tonight. Draco whispered it into the cool air, and he swore that they gleamed a bit brighter at him.
put it there,” he grinned, running a hand through his already messy hair.
The man chuckled and started to approach Draco, who scrambled back as much as he could with his broken ankle.
“Like it?” Harry smiled. Draco nodded, dumbfounded.
“I know she’s been annoying you Draco, so why don’t I just- “
Draco sighed to himself as he chewed on his tasteless meal cube. It was cheaper to provide the workers with pure nutrients than to give them actual meals all the time. He didn’t hold any resentment towards the bosses, but he
“Awake, are you?’ He turned to see the beast lounging on a sofa nearby, flicking lazily through the pages of a small novel. Draco wondered how its claws didn’t tear the delicate pages.
“It’s ok.” Draco smiled, kissing Harry’s nose softly.
He scrabbled against the velvet chaise, sobbing and writhing and screaming as Harry pushed him through his climax, the white ribbons of his come staining the dark fabric beneath him.
“Why do you ask?”
“Why am I here?” Kore demanded, crossing his arms and staring at Harry quite intensely.
“Oh no.” He placed a shaky hand over his mouth. He watched as Cedric led the villagers out of the town square and to the direction of the forest.
Harry gapes at the man while trying to come up with a...
“All the time.” Draco said, wondering why he was being so open with someone he just met. “But there’s not much of a point. You have to do what you have to get by.”
face in his hands.
The best part was that it was the mirror that had led him to the beast. The handy little thing had conjured a map for him that led him straight to the palace.
Draco becomes adjusted to living on the base station.
“What were you doing outside? At this time? The sun had not even risen fully!”
Harry gets a little jelly ;)
"Hey!"
“Harry!” He gasped, bucking upwards wildly as Harry sucked on his cock. The hand on his arse soon turned to a finger massaging his perineum, occasionally moving lower and rubbing the top of his hole.
“What do you mean, ‘what do I see?’ It’s a bloody mir-
“That’s wasn’t a good idea, you know.” Pansy piped in.
you corrupt my son?” She screeched. She slapped him as well, her long gold nails digging into his cheek and drawing blood.
Draco silently wiped his forehead with his handkerchief. He prayed silently that Cedric would soon get the hint, however unlikely that was.
Hermione was beside herself, and couldn’t even form a full sentence. She was automatically removed from the suspect list, although Draco wondered if she even cared at all.
Harry grinned devilishly. “Not yet, pretty boy. I didn’t say
“Because Ron and Hermione
“It’s not only shampoo, Potter. It’s also conditioner, gel, detangler, cream, -“
"I don't want anybody else. You're amazing, beautiful and sweet. You've acknowledged your mistake and have repaid for them many times over, love."
“Are you done?” Draco looked up and saw the beast smirking faintly at him. He nodded.
“Draco?” He looked up to see Cedric looking down at him with a surprised look on his face. Some of his cronies were behind him.
“Draco. Draco Malfoy.” He muttered.
Before Draco could react, Harry had flipped him over and positioned him so that his arse was in the air.
Now, he wasn't going to let him get away again.
It placed a large hand on Draco’s waist and used the other to hold Draco’s free hand.
Instead of giving him an answer, she merely cocked her head. “
"I'll have the pumpkin spice latte and a croissant."
“Would you care to tell me how this got into my office, Mr. Potter?”
"Do you know the names of
“Well, I’ve always been interested in more extreme personalities. They’re just more exciting, and more challenging than a normal patient. And, if I must admit, these criminals also possess a more high-profile presence. And more glamorous one, if I must say.”
“Oh, fine, I’ll make it five. But just this one time, alright?” Phillina had met him a few decades ago when he had ruined her pasture by practicing his then-abysmal skills on it (although, in his defense, how was he meant to know that it belonged to her?) and they had argued for over an hour before Draco’s mother had separated them. She had forced them to become friends (albeit reluctantly) but eventually the bond had become genuine.
With a sigh, he left the entrance and made his way to Aphrodite’s grand palace.
Potter scowled at him. “Back off mate, I asked him first!”
It had been a month since they had arrived, and they were staying in Harry’s tree mansion (apparently,
Not even ten minutes later, the door opened again. Harry perked up and spun around to at least try and apologize; even though it probably (read: definitely) wouldn’t work, it was still worth a try.
“Don’t say my name!” It roared.
He took a deep breath and galloped in.
The first Lucius noticed was that it had spiraled ram horns sticking out of its long, tangled black hair. It was very tall, almost seven feet, and extremely muscular. It had a humanlike appearance, save for the horns, black veins that bulged on its arms, thick hooves that were in the place of its feet, and abnormally long claws on its hands. It scowled devilishly at him, its teeth pointed and cruel.
“No!” Draco sneered at the octopus leg-looking thing that Harry was holding with two chopsticks.
He stepped in slowly, the familiar bell on the door ringing to let the librarian know that he was inside.
“It’s alright Harry, let it out.” Hermione soothed, nuzzling his head with the side of her feathers. Crookshanks mewled and snuggled into his stomach, purring against him. Even Ron had blown out the candles on his hand to pat Harry’s head comfortingly.
! Don’t say-”
About half of the glass had fallen off the mirror, with cracks spiderwebbing around it. As Harry watched it, another small piece came out and fell to the floor, shattering.
“Thank you, sarahisaweirdoxxo. Yes, I
?" Draco says.
“Good morning, sir. I assume that you’re Draco Malfoy?”
Draco’s arse isn’t just well-shaped; it’s very soft as well. Like a peach. A very soft, round, pale, pretty peach.
And at the rate with which the glass was breaking, he had only a few months, if not weeks, left before… before the curse became permanent.
(See the end of the chapter for

“Look, I just had a lot of things to do. I’m really sorry.” Draco sighed. As much as he was annoyed, Cormac

He turned around, and his eyes widened. Even
“Fine.”
The next day, Draco had suggested that Harry go out with his parents in order to reconcile with them.
He had posted a video reacting to it, and for some reason it had gotten a million likes in just a day. TheGoldenSnitch had even commented ‘Can’t wait ;)’
Harry steadily undid Draco’s robes and spread them open, exposing his body. He stared openly at Draco’s body, making the blond blush.
Unfortunately, his darling was with Apollo at the moment, and they were quite close to each other.
“Good morning young man. May I ask your name?” It took Draco a while to realize that Mrs. Weasley was talking to him.
“I- excuse me, Mr. Potter?”
Draco chuckled to himself and straightened his lab coat. Oh, this Granger woman knew nothing.
“Hm?” He hummed, dipping his reed pen into the ink pot next to him to sign the document with a small flourish. Just like the hundreds of other ones he had done that day.
“This is never going to work out.” He sobbed into Harry’s chest, his cheek still stinging from Harry’s mother’s nails.
“I shall see you again, Harry Potter.” He blows a small kiss to Harry before leaving the room in a confident gait.

He smirked to himself, and strutted away from the room, not noticing as another piece of glass fell off of the mirror.

“Your station?”
made Harry roll his eyes. “Anything is more important that our assignment, Malfoy. It’s History of Magic.”
“Fuck, Draco!” Harry hissed as the blond tightened around his cock, sending waves of pleasure through him.
Draco blanched. “Please let him go. He didn’t have anywhere to stay. Please.” He begged, clutching his father’s hand while looking up at the beast pleadingly. It seemed to consider Draco’s offer.
“What is it?”
“Fuck.” Draco murmured. He ran to the window and looked down. It was too high up to try to climb down.
‘Yep.’
They stopped in front of a black Corvette. Draco whistled lowly.
Draco bit his lip and read the note over again. He had no idea how it had gotten into the bathroom, but all he cared about was that Potter actually
“Oh, shut up, old man. Your stupid minions can’t even try to catch us.”
The audience laughs and cheers again, making Harry blush even harder.
As he rose up from Draco’s arse, he noticed that a good amount of precum had leaked from Draco’s rigid cock onto his skirt and the floor. He smirked.
"Yes, love?"
Harry shook his head in amusement. Trust Hermione to get excited over hard college courses.
“Let’s have a vote. All in favor of ejecting Hannah, raise your hand.” Theo said, breaking up the argument.
“Draco.” She rasped, stretching her arms out to hug him.
As Harry walked up to him, Draco didn’t even bother to run away. There was no point anymore.
They both got down and walked up to the door. Once Draco had scanned his thumb into the fingerpad, the doors opened, revealing a very large living room. Draco turned around to look at Harry.
He eyed the sparse trees distastefully. Really, there was nothing here worth coming to see! Why in heavens did he even bother in-
He slowly disentangled himself from Harry, trying to keep the heavy blush off his face. He didn’t dare look up at Harry’s face.
“Draco!” The voice was weak but unmistakable.
“Want to get away from here?” Harry asked conspiratorially, waggling his eyebrows.
“You’re eighteen, right?”
(XXII)
He sighed and put down his fork onto his plate. “Harry Potter is very interesting, to say the least.”
“Like, he gave me his number and I called him so he’d have mine. Then he didn’t even bother to call me for three whole
“Well, I’m wearing this and you can’t stop- ow!” Draco yelped as Pansy smacked his head with one of the cupboard doors.
His feet were bare, but they were
“Not now, love. I’ll be done soon, I promise,” Harry said, although his voice was a bit pained. Merlin, he was ready to fuck Draco into tomorrow, but if he didn’t do his paperwork now then he would never finish it.
He pushed in another finger, still up to the same knuckle. Draco’s hole stretched easily around him, just like it always did.
“No.”
(XIX)
Harry heard a few sniffles, but remained silent.
“That doesn’t matter now.
“Merlin, Potter, have you never heard of body lotion? I’m certain that I would be able to hear you and your dreadful noise from at least a mile away.”
However, instead of going there, the beast led Draco into another room beside it. This room was also a dining room, albeit a smaller one. The table was not as long as the first one, and it was bare.
The only reason he was even outside at all was because Hermione had forced him to go get some ‘fresh air’ as if he needed it. He snorted. He was a
“Ginny! Stop leaning over the edge! You’ll fall out!” A motherly voice shouted. Draco almost leaped out of his seat in shock, before remembering that they were alive.
“Harry, you’re not going to die. Just breathe, please-”
It took a moment for Draco to collect himself. “
A knock on the door tore him away from his thoughts. He turned just in time to see the postal service truck drive off, leaving a lumpy package onto the front doorstep of the shop.
“What was that for?” Harry winced, rubbing it. He was really starting to miss Mirror-Malfoy a lot.
“Nice to meet you, roomie.” Harry smiles. Despite himself, Draco feels a small smile rest upon his face.
And he was handsome too.
“No.”
Harry pushed the tip of his finger into Draco as he stroked Draco’s cock with his other hand, and Draco’s vision went white as he came.
Zeus rolled his eyes. He summoned a small throne, just like Harry had, and sat down on it with a big
However, I've taken my time to like plan the book out and add more tags to it. I don't know if I'll write smut just yet.
“That you are a selfish and arrogant fellow!” She shouted, causing everybody to turn their heads towards them.
Its hands lingered on Draco’s skin before it walked back to its seat, shaking its head fondly.
The caption is just as smug as Draco’s familiar grin.
Draco stared in shock. First of all, how was Potter out of his restraints? And secondly, why did Potter call him by his first name? For some reason, the second problem was bothering him much more than the first one.
Harry sat up properly against the headboard of their bed and adjusted Draco, so they were facing each other.
“What?”
He stood up quickly, gasping when he looked at himself again.
.” Draco trailed off. Suddenly, he put the puzzle pieces together. Dumbledore’s story, the legends he had heard, the rumors…
As usual, the two of them were on the news. Their latest heist was to shut down the power of half of the city (Draco only took part in Harry’s less violent crimes. Harry minded little anyway). However, it seemed as if there was a special feature because Draco noticed that Hermione was sitting across from the reporter. And it looked as if they were interviewing her.
“Just admit that you want it, Harry. It won’t kill you.”
Draco blushed harder, and shoved another spoonful of Nutella in his mouth aggressively.
“Feisty,” Cedric smirked. “Anyways, I just came to arrest your father.”

like the attention sometimes, but it was quickly starting to become overbearing. Besides, the only reason they wanted him was because of his beauty. If they had actually bothered to speak to him and get to know bit, he could have possibly considered them, but they only lusted after his looks.
He felt Harry smile into his hair. “Neither can I.” As Harry leaned in to suck his neck softly, Draco let out an appreciative sigh and ran his fingers through Harry’s messy hair.
Granger gave him a curious stare. “How so?”
By the time he slipped on his robe, it was already time for the party to start. Of course, he would arrive fashionably late, like he always did. He needed to make sure that there were enough people to witness his grand entrance.
.” Draco moaned. Harry slowly pushed his index finger inside up to the first knuckle. When Draco whined and loosened up, he slid the rest in.
“Harry. You’re hurting me,” Draco said, trying to free himself from Harry’s tight grasp. “Harry? Harry, are you- “
“Love you,” he whispered. Harry nodded, and suddenly kissed him, ignoring the panicked shouts of the countless police officers in the background. The bomb would go off soon, anyway, and he needed to get Draco out of there. Quickly.
Harry slowly pulled away from Draco’s spit-covered cock. “Turn around for me?”
, Harry, he’ll
“Draco was interested in Harry from the first day, but he didn’t really start acting weird until he became Harry Potter’s psychiatrist. His
Draco nodded desperately and arched his back. “
“How many times have I told you not to scream in my ear, ‘Mione?” He sighed, opening his eyes to stare at her. She was standing in front of his throne with her arms crossed and her hair a bushy, frizzy mess. Her eyes blazed with fiery fury, making her irises glow almost as brightly as the flowing rivers of lava that illuminated the dark realm.
for goodness sake. The only beings who needed ‘fresh air’ were mortals.
Just as Harry expected, the garden was empty and quiet. It was more of a maze, to be fair, and the tall hedges formed wide paths and forks for any wandering passerby. It would be perfect for him to hide himself in.
He leaned forward and kissed Draco, who returned it eagerly.
You’re

“You’ve been eyefucking me since we got into the house. Don’t think I didn’t notice you.”
“There!” He pointed. “This is where we fight for our lives!”
At first, he had only felt curiosity about Potter and his situation. He was merely interested in the way his mind worked and nothing else. But now… now, Draco was becoming increasingly invested in Potter. Scratch that, he was
“Yes you will or I’m going to smack you with my cupboard doors.” Pansy threatened.
“Contrary to popular belief, no. I do everything willingly. There’s the occasional rough person, but most days I enjoy what I do, even if it doesn’t pay much. I certainly could have been worse off.”
"What do you mean, love?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“But… I can teach you, dear. I can make you feel better than you’ve ever felt before, and you won’t regret it. Besides, don’t you want to do it with me?”
Hermione had hung herself in her room. She had left a letter behind, but Draco couldn’t even manage to read it.
“Now I’ll bring my right foot in, and you step back with yours.”
“When was the last time you bothered to comb it?” Draco sighed as he tried to drag the comb through Harry’s tangled hair- wait, when did the beast become

Draco blushed and smacked Harry’s shoulder. “
Draco didn’t hesitate to answer. “Yes.” Not only because of his love for Harry (although that was a very big factor) but he knew that if he refused, Harry would have no choice but to kill him.

Draco leaned back into Harry’s chest, idly playing with the black hair that had started growing there in considerable amounts. Harry usually shaved his chest hair but had stopped at Draco’s request.

A tall glass vase with two roses in it. Almost exactly like the one he had gotten in his office that day.
let me come,” he pleaded, thrashing back and forth against the wooden desk and arching his back. Harry didn’t bother to reprimand him for talking again; he knew that Draco was already on the edge.
“No you didn’t! I’ve been in here since noon!”
“Yes, I do. Just give me a minute.”
“Merlin.” He muttered. Whatever happened was not good.
“What’s a… Wrackspurt?” Draco asked, confused.
Draco nodded and breathed his mother’s scent. “Yes mother.”
Draco should have expected it to happen sooner or later, but it was still a surprise when the entire building was put into lockdown because Harry Potter had escaped from his cell.
Suddenly, her face paled, right in the middle of Draco’s rant. But instead of showing him to get out of wherever the hell he was, she just muttered “Oh god, Hades.”
, yes
Harry laughed. ‘Lol it is. I was wondering if you wanted to do a collab sometime?’
Draco nodded and keened as Harry moved his mouth even lower and took one of the pink buds between his lips.
Several feet in front of him, the Mirror of Erised stood tall and loomed over him.
As he sniffed the rose again, he faintly registered the coppery, cloying scent of blood on it. He exhaled wistfully at the smell. Aphrodite’s scent was still stubbornly stuck to it, even after all this time.*
Draco nodded. It had only happened some five years ago, and it was still talked about frequently.
"What movie is that?" Draco asks.
“I shall have you soon, my dear. It is only a matter of time.” He said proudly. Before Draco could respond, Cedric kissed his forehead and strutted away, obviously satisfied with himself.
I am so sorry I took so long to update. I have lot of things to work on, but I'm working on new Drarry stories!
“Hi.” He says. The boy falters for a moment.

Draco, who was originally frozen in shock, screamed and ran to Harry’s side, managing to pull Harry back to rest his head in his lap.
“What did he do?”
With a wave of his hand, the woman fell silent. Harry raised an eyebrow at her. Well, at least there was

They were fucking on the living room couch when Harry’s parents walked in. At first, Harry and Draco hadn’t noticed, but the shattering of a champagne glass brought them out of their sex-induced haze.
It was huge and right in the middle of a beautiful garden, with all kinds of plants and flowers Draco had never seen before. It was a shock of green and pink and red and

“Once upon a time, there was a King James and Queen Lily of Gryffindoria. They gave birth to Prince Harry about a year before you yourself were born, lad.”
He took off his Invisibility Cloak and sighed into the empty space. The last time he had been here was in his first year, and
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was soft and chilling.
“Understand?”
“Well, I demand that you allow me to leave!”
Draco looked down at the money register, suddenly very interested in the painted designs on it. “Alright. I’ll see you then.”
“Wanna have sex?” Harry offered.
He ran out of the back door to avoid the mob in front of the palace. There was nobody here yet-
They had been dating for almost a year now, and for the last month or so Draco had been upset because Harry was being too ‘possessive’ of him.
“You still want to try the butter beer?” Harry smiled.
This went on for two years.
“Potter!”
.” Pansy grimaced.
As he got to
Draco sighed. As angry as he was, he wasn’t cruel enough to dismiss a mere child.
“It’s ‘Hades’ to you, Zeus.” Harry said calmly, sitting up straighter. Zeus snorted.
“Good. Very good.” Draco was struggling to keep his eyes open, and Harry took pity on him.
“One of our old ships was found! The cargo is still intact!” He said excitedly.
It was late in the evening when Draco finally finished his shift. Granger had spent most of the day giving him a tour of the entire building, which looked more like a maze than an asylum, if Draco had to be honest.
“You know Doc, you’re really easy on the eyes,” Potter grinned, licking his lips shamelessly. Draco was taken aback by the compliment.
“Hello. Enjoying yourself?” Draco jumped and turned around. Behind him was a tall, handsome man. He has black hair and kind green eyes. He looked around Draco’s age.
Three months later, Harry approached Malfoy Manor with nothing but a wand, a dagger and a lighter.
“Not again.” Thallo sighed, pinching the bridge of her freckled nose. “Good morning Draco. Do come inside already, although Carpo is right. You do need to be more careful.” With a wave of her hand, the gates opened, revealing the beauty and glory of Mount Olympus.

“Who’s Harry?”
“Thanks so much. I’ll see you again soon.” Harry smiled. Draco waved at him happily as he walked out of the flower shop.
Harry takes a deep breath, grips Draco’s arse (tighter than he should, if he’s being honest) and starts to write on it. His hands shake ever so slightly, and he curses quietly as he dots his ‘t’ instead of crossing it.
“I’m so proud of you,
“Harry now, is it?” Cedric’s tone was quiet, even contemplative.
Draco sniggers.

Hey guys.
“Alright then, I guess you have to leave. Although it’s nice that there’s someone that I can actually relate to here.”
He purposely ignored the logical part of his brain that said the beast has saved him, and therefore cared about him, even if it was just a little.
Harry was so engrossed in Mirror-Malfoy, he didn’t even notice when somebody stepped into the room.
He quickly lubed up his cock and gripped Draco’s hips tightly.
Draco was in heaven.
“If you say so.” Draco shrugged. “So,” He started. “Tell me about your parents. What’s your home life like?”
“Well, you could set them up. Say that you want the three of them to hang out, but you never show up. They’ll be forced to talk to each other and eventually confront their feelings. And slow down there.” He said when Harry started filing a bit too enthusiastically.

alive and well. Everything was perfect in the mirror.
“Someone was just a bit rough, is all.” He said, trying to sound nonchalant. Harry didn’t seem convinced.
“Like, his hair is adorable, and he’s so muscly, and he’s just so
Seamus looks delighted by this, for some reason. “And did you?”
As he stormed away in the cold, a large hand on his shoulder pulled him back. He winced as Cormac shoved him into the brick wall of the shop.
“Draco.
I feel better now, and as I promised I'm done with this chapter! I hope you guys like it!
Draco gulped and dug the heels of his palms into his eyes until bright bursts of psychedelic, dizzying colors filled his vision. He needed to calm down. Calm.
“Yes, you are! Do you think I’m dumb? I can see the hickey on your neck!”
Harry could only watch in shock as Draco came up to him and sat on his lap, effectively pushing him away from the paper-ridden desk. Not that Harry minded. His hands automatically came up to grip Draco’s hips tightly.
“I’ve seen the way you look at my son, Harry.” Zeus’ voice had a slight tone of amusement in it.
"What is it made of?" Draco asks curiously. "It smells good."

“Thank you, Harry.” Before he could process what he was doing, he walked up to Harry and

Harry had always had a tiny crush on him, but over the years it had grown. When he had finally gathered the guts to confess, Draco moved away abruptly, leaving Harry dismayed.
"I love you Harry." Draco smiled, pecking Harry on his forehead.
“Draco.” Harry cut into his train of thoughts. He held Draco’s chin with two fingers and tilted it up so he could look into his eyes. Draco blushed furiously.
“Please?” The beast grumbled.
“Love you, Harry.”
He sighed deeply and conjured a makeshift throne for him to sit on. It wasn’t nearly as grand as the one back in the Underworld, but it would have to do. It was still beautiful, as it was made of threads of inky darkness, shiny obsidian and little flecks of molten lava. It glowed ominously in the dark.
The audience goes wild, and Harry momentarily wonders just
Harry laughed as he ducked under her hand. Just like old times.
“To dance, of course.”
“Are you alright now?” It asked Draco. When Draco looked at it he swore that its eyes gleamed.
“It’s incredibly irresponsible, especially if you’re thinking about making money off of this by writing a tacky book about them,” Granger finished, gasping slightly for air. Jesus, she talked a lot. Draco would need to shake her off later, but right now he was only interested in one person.
He spun around to tell the beast how good they were but froze in his tracks. The beast was smiling. A genuine, soft smile. Its eyes glimmered with amusement.
Which was why the universe just
As it locked the door from the outside, Draco was met face to face with a giggling Pansy.
Nothing had worked. He had bought Draco gifts, pampered him, and everything else he could think of. This was the only thing left he hadn’t tried.
“Well, be careful.” She walked away from him with the ominous warning, leaving him in front of the small door that was guarded by at least ten different security guards. The room was hidden deep inside the asylum. All the walls were made with thick, soundproof metal.
He picked up his shaving stick and cast a Silencing Spell on the door so he could trim his beard to a stubble , just the way Draco liked it, without making any noise.
“How are the tomatoes, love?” Harry asked.
Draco looked up at Harry.
“It will leave the recipient in endless, unbearable pain until the curse is released by the caster. Which I have no intention of doing, King Aeacus. Not for a long, long time.”
“I can take you with me for my next mission.”
Slowly, Harry pushed his cock in all the way, making Draco moan loudly and continuously.
He snapped out of his thoughts and turned back to the trembling phantom servant who was kneeling at his feet with his head bowed respectfully, presenting a papyrus scroll to him on a hammered gold platter. It was tied tightly with a thin red ribbon and bore the seal of Olympus on the edge: a mountain surrounded by a halo and twelve stars, each one for a major Olympian. As it was, Harry barely spent any of his time on Olympus, and he was sure that the only reason he was still considered one was because he was simply too powerful to be ignored. Besides, even if he tried to opt out, Zeus and Poseidon would somehow convince him to change his mind. It had happened several times in the past.
‘You live in Ilvermorny, right?’
you?” Just as he expected, Draco shook his head frantically.
“How are we going to do this, though?”
With that thought in mind, he gathered all of his confidence. He needed to be as charming as possible to win Draco’s heart. Draco was a hard-to-get, and Harry loved a good challenge.
Draco felt his blood run cold. “What?”
The next weekend, Draco was sullen and sore. His last client from yesterday had more or less taken him dry, and he was still bleeding from the treatment. He couldn’t stand the thought of telling the ManagerBots that he had anal fissures, so he kept quiet.
“Come on, love. Let’s get back to our rooms.”
“I think I love you.” Harry whispered against his lips.
Before Harry could retort, he noticed that the mist in the mirror had started to swirl again. He looked at Malfoy and saw the blond staring directly into the mirror.
“Brilliant. The humans have started to experience effects of the virus we introduced into their ecosystem. In less than a year, they should be eliminated.”
“Come for me.” Harry whispered into his mouth. With a scream that reverberated around the small room, Draco came.
to bring it up at the worst possible moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
On the way back, he decided to stop at the local library to cheer himself up. Even though he had read all the books there at least three times (it was rather small since people in this godforsaken place didn’t enjoy academic sorts of entertainment) Draco still frequented the establishment.
It took several months of pleading and begging (and making several large, suggestive donations to the asylum) before the admin

They spent the rest of the Saturday afternoon watching
Aeacus snorted in a rather un-kingly manner. “Understandable. Next!”
Ten minutes and four multicolored peacocks later, Draco skipped into the house happily. Most of the people in the comments seemed quite amused and laughed out.
“I-I-” Draco stammered, backing away from the mirror hastily. The beast snarled, its irises fading from emerald green to blood red. It bared its teeth menacingly.
He could feel that the rotten parts had spread from his heart, and had covered most of what was a normally pure essence. Now, he was black and dark and
“I...um... was busy.” Harry muttered. He discreetly adjusted his robes so his hard-on wouldn’t poke the fabric.
“Yes, Granger, I understand how dangerous he is,” Draco said, waving off her concerns. He was much too excited to finally have a session with Potter, and he was already determined not to fall into his trap.
(III)
Harry knew that there was only one way he could convince Draco to love him unconditionally, even if it meant resorting to the worst measures.
“Aren’t ya-” He started loudly.
Harry snorted. The one time Hermione had convinced him to go into the upper world, he had managed to fall head over heels for somebody he had never even met before.
Midnight came far too soon, and they all got up to leave. Before they did, Cormac pecked Draco’s cheek and slipped a piece of paper into his hands.

“Yes. He belongs in the mental asylum, the bugger. Going off about hideous beasts and the Crown Prince himself.” He said with a cruel smirk on his face.
“Mum, Dad? I-I thought-”
“Draco?” Harry murmured, finally lifting up his head.
“They’re alright and send you their greetings.”
Harry howled loudly. The sword hadn’t gone deep, but it had managed to draw blood.
“What?”
“Why am I
“Harry!” Soon, Harry set up a fast, steady pace that left both of them moaning loudly.
“Harry?” Draco whimpered. Harry stayed still.
He was still going at full speed, anxious to get to his father before anything drastic happened. Soon, the horse slowed to a stop, refusing to go any further. Draco sighed and got down from the horse. Before he could stop it, Aries ran off, leaving him behind. He sighed again. Things were not going well.
There was silence for a bit.
“One moment!” He called out from the backroom, hurriedly dusting off his apron and jeans.
Draco sighs, and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Fine. Just this once.”
him, as if Harry was a wild animal and his darling was a rabbit that was ensnared in his trap. His beautiful darling would always beg so sweetly, never wanting Harry to stop and always pleading so prettily for more.
(VIII)
“Um, do I know you?” Draco asked, perplexed.
“Did you ask how our guest is faring, dear? We wouldn’t want him to be… uncomfortable, would we?”
Zeus grinned. “Oh, but it does. You’ll never get him if Demeter has her way.”
The beast laughed. “Well, dinner is at seven, so remember that. Don’t get too caught up.”
“I’m sorry, y’know.” Draco stopped sipping his tea and turned to face the beast. Its face was sheepish, and a bit regretful.
Harry was going to have to be more careful around her now. He knew just what she was capable of; it was why he had chosen her as his advisor in the first place. Her sharp wit and intellect even surpassed those of some lesser gods’.
He stood up and stretched his slightly cramped muscles, groaning softly when his blood rushed unto his stiff muscles. His chiton was a bit wrinkled, but with a snap of his fingers it straightened itself out and artfully positioned the folded strip of silk back onto his shoulder. He braided his hair again, wore his crown and laced up his sandals. He was back to being Kouroi again. Not Draco.
“Not detached. I’m just not one for deceiving myself with useless lies.”
Harry smiled and led Draco into the room. He sat Draco down and started to dish out the food- coq au vin with boiled white rice and roasted greens, along with a glass of sparkling rosé.
And Draco didn’t know what was happening to him.
“Well, I brought you here because I would like to talk to you. Get to know you, even.”
, but he stopped when he noticed his little god standing not too far away.
The thought of his parents brings back the usual ache in his heart, but now it's just a dull throb. They had died in a car accident when he was one. For the next twelve years of his life, he had lived with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. They were rather nasty, especially Dudley, their obese, spoilt son. However, once he turned thirteen, he was handed over to his godfather, Sirius Black. Well, more like Sirius gathered a shitload of lawyers and demanded for Harry’s custody. He smiles softly at the memory. Those had been the best years of his life.
“Can we use it?” Harry asks excitedly.
“Draco, come help me block the door!”
"Where's the stew?" Draco asks, his stomach growling.
“Leave?”
the Crown Prince Harry under a curse. And everyone in the ball had turned into objects!
Draco was screwed.
Draco screamed and backed away from Harry as quickly as he could.
“At least have some dinner first, Kore.”
As he stood up to leave, the beast quickly shot up and intercepted him.
“Your choice, then. Malfoy.” He says pointedly. Despite himself, Draco laughs. Then Harry gives him a grin and walks out, leaving Draco feeling slightly happier.
“How’s your roommate?” Hermione asked curiously.
“Relax, mate. You guys just met a few days ago.” Ron said reasonably.
During dinner, the beast had requested that he change into formal clothes for some strange reason. He had raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment. Pansy had chosen out a long black jacket for him over a fitted white shirt and cream trousers. She had forced him to wear a corset under the shirt, the bitch. His waist was uncomfortable, but he supposed that it looked fashionable or whatever.
He looked at his hands. They were normal. No claws.
He picked up the robe and quickly changed into it.

“Good luck. He’s already started to gather some drunk satyrs. He’s probably going to hold another keg stand contest.”
away from all of the other gods and goddesses alike who pined over him. And that nickname.

Harry chuckled softly. “I would fuck you first, but your arse looks too

“This is amazing!” He exclaimed. Both Harry and Cormac chuckled at that. Draco downed the rest of his drink eagerly, soon feeling delightfully tipsy. Just a little, just enough to feel good. Now, everyone was a little light-headed too.
“What’s next, Doc?”
Draco did it with no small amount of nervousness.

“My Lord, Lady Aphrodite has sent you a message.”
Draco sighed. "Sorry, Harry."
“Sorry, sir.” Draco muttered, looking down at his shoes. He was sure to get fired now.
“I thought you would like it.” Harry’s voice was soft.
“Don’t fucking touch him.” The person growled, holding Cormac up by his collar.

The sound of a horse neighing frightfully snapped him out of his thought.

“Rose! I told you not to go to the grand chambers!” A middle-aged looking woman, who had a striking resemblance to her daughter (or Rose, Draco supposed) appeared from at the entrance of the hallway where Draco had come from. She paused once she spotted Draco.
“Don’t think that I didn’t see you and Apollo, Kouroi,” she said, her voice low and threatening. “He was all over you and you didn’t even try to push him off!”
“As I was saying, how many do you want?”
Soon, he arrived at the fisherman’s stall. He was one of the kinder people in the kingdom and always reduced the price of his fish in return for Draco to help him get worms from the earth.
