Harry would lie if he said that he didn’t feel a hint of disappointment. But he didn’t want to push his luck, after all, Malfoy was already willing to sleep in the same bed as him, and not in his cat form.
Malfoy shrugged, but stayed silence, staring at their joined hands. Harry thought that maybe he should let it go, but he didn’t want to, and he was relieved when he noticed that Malfoy didn’t neither.
Draco scowled, and Potter just sneered, keeping his little administrations, even with a Draco wiggling under.
“Exactly !” Harry exclaimed, breaking the hug to face Malfoy and looked at him dead in the eyes. “I mean, I don’t know what I’m doing half of the time and I ended dying the last time but I don’t care, I’m here for you and I’ll help you with all those bad nightmares or I’m even here if you need to talk !” Harry started to talk a lot and quickly. “I mean, Hermione used to say “Harry, you’re not a good listener, you never pay attention.” but I changed ! Well, I changed a lot this summer, but I’m sure you noticed at least a part, and..”
“Pansy…” Blaise said calmly, his hand clenching slightly on her shoulder, before turning toward the now golden duo. “ May Pansy and I share the compartment with you ? All others are full.” He asked way too politely for a slytherin, Harry thought.
The smile on Harry’s face dropped, realizing that if Malfoy wouldn’t want him to see him naked, it wasn’t only because he was a bit prude or shy.
months. Potter sat down on a armchair, in the other side of the desk, and put Draco the cat on his knees. But Draco was too embarrassed to stay there, knowing perfectly that the professor knew, so he just jumped down, made a few steps before turning into human again, he had no interest at staying into his cat form.
“Well, that now you are not such a big prick as before and I’m sure if you do genuine apologizes, they will be ok.”
Draco gasped, but didn’t move, and Potter dared to be more enterprising. With the hand that wasn’t busy with Draco delicate fingers, he slipped it through Draco’s waist and, caressing him all along, rested his hand on the small of his back. While the process, Potter didn’t stop his soft kisses on his cheek.
Without waiting more, Harry left the common room and went to the headmistress office. At the end of the stair, he stared at the gargoyle statue, trying to remember which was the password. He mildly remembered McGonagall giving the 8th years the password, in case there was any emergency. But he didn’t have to think too much when he suddenly heard a voice behind him.
And she disappeared before any of them could say something, closing the door behind her. They stayed silently for a while, Draco thoughts mixing, from why was Potter still hugging him even when Luna was there to Oh my god Luna saw me.
Draco didn’t even realized that it was ready, or that the sheets were green, he just went to the bed, and at the moment his head touch the pillow, he fall asleep.
When Harry woke up the next morning, it was thanks to Malfoy meowing to his face, following to a bump with his forehead right
And so, here was Draco, trying to sleep on an not that comfortable couch. The beds were better, way better, but now it wouldn’t be possible. He couldn’t help but meowed pitifully, and started to scratch the couch. McGonagall won’t be happy, but she started by naming him Magnolia. Magnolia ! What a stupid name.
“Thank you professor.” Said Draco, but didn’t say the other part of his thoughts. But I’m sure they would be the only ones.
Slowly, Draco walked toward the bed and jumped on it. But he was too self-conscious to stay that close to Potter, especially to a Potter that smelled that good. Damn it, stop it Draco ! So he went to the end of the bed, and curled up.
When the night came, Harry found himself both happy and apprehensive. He didn’t really want to hide to Malfoy the fact that he knew. But also, he was a bit worried Malfoy would panic and went hiding, knowing the blond teenager, Harry guessed that he would feel ashamed. And Harry didn’t want that. Moreover, if Malfoy needed to feel secure to turn back into his original form, maybe just treating him like a simple cat was the best.
But still, it was comfortable, and warm. Like Potter. Draco started his cleaning routine, when he realized that the sun was up. He didn’t know the time, but in the few times he slept with Potter - as a cat, he had to remind himself, nothing fancy- Draco noticed the tendency of Potter to oversleep. So as the good cat he was, he decided to wake up the sleeping beauty. Draco moved slowly toward the head of the bed, and Potter. Then, he suddenly jumped on his head, waking him up in a jolt. It was so funny to see the grumpy face on the wizard that Draco would be hilarious if he wasn’t a cat.
No I don’t like Potter, he is just the only one that accepted me, but now that you’re here Luna, I don’t need him anymore ! Draco thought. But it turned out to be only a pitiful meow.
Okay, maybe it was just a ordinary cat, all these things weren’t that incredible. Even without asking Hermione, he knew this. But he couldn’t explain this feeling, or this sparkle of intelligence that shine in Magnolia eyes.
Potter didn’t try to catch him or anything, it wasn’t a surprise but it still hurt a little. No way, Draco lectured himself, he shouldn’t be hurt, it was stupid. But it happened that he wasn’t the only one to notice it.
Malfoy didn’t answer right away, on the contrary, he looking up straight into Harry eyes, before closing his own and dropping his head down, making Harry letting go his hands.
Surprisingly, Magnolia didn’t sniff it. Instead, he kept looking at Harry into his eyes, with those cat eyes so grey. The more he was looking into those stormy eyes, the more he was convinced that he had already saw them, the way a hint of blue glittered when the light of the sun hit them. Malfoy, Harry thought. But no, it wasn’t possible. Malfoy wasn’t an animated, and there is no way he could have fool McGonagall.
“Great, thank you, you’re a really good one.” She said, petting his head before heading to the bathroom.
“ I guess there is no way trying to deny it. You are right, mr. Malfoy is an animagus, and as you could have seen, he is a cat. Why he decided to became one, I don’t know, and it wouldn’t be my place to tell you anyway. However, I can tell you that mr. Malfoy is trapped in this form.”
“No, no.” McGonagall hided her smile behind her cup of tea. “He was helping the curse breakers with cleaning Hogwarts this summer.”
“Ahah, really funny Potter.” He heard from behind him as he was looking at the wall in front of him. “I’m not a show off like you.”
He was turning around to leave but Harry didn’t let him, he grabbed Malfoy’s wrist and pulled him inside his room, just before closing the door.
Malfoy not answer, not that he really could anyway, and pumped his head on Harry thought, making him smile slightly.
But too late, Draco sneaked through Potter’s limbs, and ran away. Just at this time, the door opened and Longbottom head appeared in the opening of the door. Draco took advantage of the occasion and just slipped between the gryffindor legs. He just heard him asked “ Are you okay Potter ?” before running down the stairs.
“You maybe shouldn’t stay alone tonight.” Harry whispered, sitting next to him, letting his shoulder go.
“I was saying as a cat you brute !” Draco shouted back, his heart beating so fast he was sure that this stupid big gryffindor would be the end of him.
Draco’s heart clutched in his little chest at the sad smile Potter wore. After some more small talks, Draco still snuggled against Potter chest, Potter left the common room and went back to their room. As usual, Draco turned back to stare at the wall as the other’s young man got undressed. He slipped under the sheets, and Draco took his place at the end of the bed. Potter patted the place next to him, trying to get the cat sleeping next to him, but gave up when Draco didn’t move.
“I won’t hurt you, don’t be scare.” He kept murmuring. “Just smell my hand, you’ll see. I don’t mean any harm…”
Hermione frowned as Zabini and Parkinson entered the compartment, the latter pretty reluctantly. Parkinson sat next to Hermione, the farest from her as she could. Zabini sat across his friend, not as ostensibly far as Parkinson, but Harry could still see how stiff he was.
Draco didn’t answer, but he felt Potter tightened his grip around his waist. They stayed in this intimate position for like feel forever, until Potter’s door opened.
He stared at the wall for a while, but the air was hit and steamy, and he was starting to be drowsy. He had to fall asleep, because when he opened his eyes, he was again in Potter arms, he should really not get used to it, and they were in the darkness of the corridor. When they entered Potter’s room, the latest let the cat down. He petted his head and went to bed. Draco stayed for while, a bit dumb.
Harry jumped at a very loud mewl, and whispered a quick “Mischief managed” and threw the map into his truck, under a pile of clothes. A new loud mewl, a more panic mewl he would dare to say, could been hear from the bed. He stood up abruptly and saw Magn-Malfoy looking at him, his cat eyes glowing in the dark.
He knew Malfoy couldn’t answer, but the way he snuggled his head against his neck made Harry’s heart flustered. He passed his arms around the small form, and kissed the top of his head. He wished he had the real Malfoy.
Malfoy closed his eyes, and slowly, he approached his face, and pecked Harry’s mouth with his wet nose.
Harry turned his eyes and watched the cat sleeping by his side. He started petting him, hoping not waking him up, but he couldn’t resist, the light blond fur was so soft. He sighted, knowing that it was late in the night, he would be tired as hell the morning coming, but he just couldn’t sleep right now. He rolled on his side, his head being supported by his hand while the other kept petting Magnolia. Suddenly, the young cat moved and changed his position, without chasing Harry’s hand away, and fell asleep as fast as he woke up. The teenager muffled his chuckle, and kept running his fingers through the fur, until he stopped, his heart starting to race fast.
Draco drew in a breath and reached for Hermione’s hand, his long fingers wrapping around her small slender ones. She clutched back tightly.
“Did your mam never teach you consent, Bryn?” Remus said, stepping up behind them. Draco saw Bryn blanch before he turned around.
“I really thought it would be better this time. I sent Blaise home, but I don’t want to go back there. I can’t bear to look at him, knowing he tried to take you away from Draco, and me. I know it’s different, but I really like you Harry. No-one has ever been as kind to me as you have been, even after all I did to you, and I couldn’t bear to lose you.  I hate Blaise for jeopardising that. I hate him for hurting Draco, and for using you to do it.”
Finally, his brain caught up to reality and he stopped abruptly in the middle of his room, watching as Harry and Ron sat on his desk.
Just then a mediwitch swept in, holding the slumbering babe in her arms. “he has a nasty virus, but he’ll be fine soon. We will keep him for the rest of the day for observation, and I will give you a set of potions that you are to mix in with his milk twice daily. The worst of the sicking up is over, but his fever has yet to break.” She smiled at Harry, and sneered at Draco, before settling Teddy into the cot nestled in the corner of the room. She handed Harry the potions then bustled out of the room. Molly transfigured a sofa from one of the stools in the room, and gently leads Harry over to it. He whispers to her before closing his eyes and she rushes out, returning sometime later with Andromeda and Narcissa in tow. Draco is somewhat taken aback at the appearance of his mother, and shocked further when she goes to Harry’s side first. Andy gently eased herself onto the sofa so that Harry’s head was on her lap, and Narcissa lifted up his legs, settling under them and allowing his thighs to drape over hers. Draco felt strangely left out, but one look at the tortured expression on Harry’s face made him realise why everyone was being so gentle and attentive with him.
“there are actually three different species of snake native to England” explained Hermione as Harry made his way over.
Harry could hear the tell-tale wobble in her voice that meant Pansy was crying. He wrapped an arm around Draco and rolled his body over, so he was now in the middle, and turned to Pansy, gathering her small form in his arms.
The two hags have taken it upon themselves to create ‘interhouse unity’, coming up with plans to lift our spirits. Ugh, how gauche. What’s worse, is that I must attend all these little soirees. As the closest thing to a war criminal, I must show the most willing, or so Pansy says. She's just too busy pining over Blaise and needs me there at all times as a constant buffer whilst he talks about, well, not her. He even waxed poetic about Granger, once. Pansy cried so hard even I felt sympathetic. Like a fool, Pansy laid claim to Theo in third year, and now he’s off gallivanting in France and she’s stuck with a boy to whom she could be invisible, for all he notices her.
“it’s nothing to do with you. Ron is the only person I have ever told. The only other time I have ever spoken about it was when I was testifying against them in court last year, so that Sirius could get custody of me. Ron had to tell his mother, and Hermione. Ginny knows some because of how many times I sought respite in their home, and Luna knows whatever the others have told her- I never asked. Sirius heard it all in court. Molly, Ron’s mum, did learn some of it from me in bits and pieces, but I never sat down and explained it all the way I did with Ron, or in court. I just can’t say it. I can’t give voice to those words. It feels like I'm staining the air around me to say it.”
“yes yes yes Ron, I know my living room is full of Slytherins. They are staying to see Draco and they have actually been really fun company.  Until tonight” Harry groaned at the end, feeling very much at the end of his tether
“You’re a funny man, Peterson” Harry says, and Peterson’s brown furrows deeply. It’s not an attractive look, if I do say so myself.
“Come on, pup. Let's go home, maybe see Teddy? Or do some baking? Watch a film? Whatever you want. I've emailed Minerva at Hogwarts. She knows me, and she’s read the court proceedings; she’s given you as much time off as you need”
She flushed. Being from a Caribbean family, she loved a proper big party, but the culture was so incongruous with British party culture, let alone wizarding party culture, and she never felt able to bring Carib culture to Hogwarts- it was something she wanted to keep to herself but over the summer after the war she had invited Harry to a lime at her uncles house, and he had immediately gotten into the swing of things, learning how to secure a whine from Hermione’s meddlesome older cousins, and she had loved having someone to share that part of her with. He loved the soca music too, and kept trying to persuade her to introduce it to Hogwarts parties.
He was too drunk to deal with this, and all he wanted was to find Draco and be held by Draco and be kissed by Draco. All he wanted was Draco, and he wasn’t going to let Blaise ruin that, he just didn’t know how to fix this. Draco’s dep-seated insecurities meant that he was unlikely to believe it if Harry just told him, Harry would need to show him somehow. Through his drunk haze, he remembered the cracked and decrepit pensive he had stored in the attic of Grimmauld, that had previously stood on a pedestal in the centre of the library.
“What the fuck was that, Harry?” Draco said mildly as he got two cups down. He watched out the window as Hermione went and sat on the doorstep of his little cottage. He sped up making tea for the two of them, and snagged half a pack of chocolate digestives from the breadbin.
At Blaise’s insistence, the group of four teenagers opened a bottle of firewhiskey, and Harry put some music on.
“When are you going to put him out of his misery and actually make your move, mate?” Ron asked, laughing.
“Yeah I guessed that” Draco said dryly, feeling like he had the upper hand for the first time in weeks.
Malfoy closed his eyes, and whispered “yes, please” and that was all Harry needed before he gently tilted his face and pressed his lips against Malfoy.
Draco awoke the morning of his birthday naturally, which meant that he had been allowed to lie in as a birthday gift, rather than being awoken at an ungodly hour of the morning. He got up, dressed and walked over to the big house for some breakfast. He felt surprisingly happy given it was his first birthday without his mother, and opened the front door with a spring in his step.
Draco sat more gingerly next to Harry, and selected a scone for himself. He nearly groaned in appreciation at the first bite, Ron’s mum clearly had talent in the kitchen. Before he knew it he was on his second already, slurping down tea between bites.
“it’s alright. It’s not like I haven’t done this for Ron, or Seamus, or any of my other mates” said harry soothingly, crouching down to rub Draco’s back.
The rest of Draco’s day went as expected. He had English after French. He hadn’t thought that enough boys would have signed up to do English to warrant two English classes, but he knew Theo was doing English, and Theo wasn’t on the register for his English lesson, so there must be another class.
Draco hadn’t had that. He has parents who loved him but were on the wrong side of the war. He’d grown up thinking that Voldemort was right and the light was wrong. He was taught that Death Eater’s were good and Muggleborn’s were bad. It was so much worse when a parent loved you because you were much more likely to trust and respect their beliefs.
Draco tried and failed not to think about Potter. He was still half convinced that it had all been an elaborate scheme to break him. Well if that’s what he was going for, then Potter had done a tremendous job. Draco was utterly broken.
Macmillan nodded. “I knew it. Weasley never treated her right.” he huffed. “It was as if he was always thinking about somebody else.” That would be Hermione…
And of course the rest followed suit. “They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer!” the first-years started to chant.
He sighed, knowing one think for certain. He’d left the manor in an attempt to clear his head but will return with his thoughts more scrambled than ever before.
Well, not anymore. He needed to do better. He needed to be stronger. He had to offer Ms Pritchett the closure that he’d gotten almost a month ago. He had to say goodbye.
Draco shot him a confused glance. “How do you know about it?” he accused lightly, genuinely intrigued.
Draco shot him a rare smile before handing him the portkey. “Trust me.” He whispered as the boy disappeared as if he’d never been there to begin with.
Macmillan turned a deep shade of crimson. “Besides, I’d never be able to score the girl I like with him around.” He stated, and Draco was yet again surprised.
Draco scoffed. Whilst he could wholly admit that Potter hadn’t had the easiest life, he couldn’t help but hate him for how he went about it. Yes, his parents had died when he was a baby. It was perhaps true that his family wasn’t the nicest to him. He very surely was the enemy of a crazed madman who wanted to kill him.
“RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY YOUR CHICKEN IS READY!” Mrs Weasley bellowed as Draco watched in amusement as Weasley ran past with determination.
Draco sighed and attempted to leave, but Potter but a hand on his chest. Draco lifted up his head to meet Potter’s blazing green eyes. “Why don’t you eat eggs for breakfast anymore?” he shouted.
And for the first time he realised that he and Potter weren't all that different. No they were just two boys, that were born into a web of impossible expections. They were just two boys that the world had set their sights on, telling them
Several moments later, and his father turned back to Draco giving him a curt nod. Draco breathed a sigh of relief, as he smiled his father before standing up and turning to Potter. He gave Potter a nod similar to that of his father’s as he followed him out of the Great Hall, and away from his parents.
He followed it deeper and deeper until he reached the foyer of the Manor, and his heart stopped. His Aunt Bellatrix was looming over a figure. A small and defeated figure.
That small piece of paper meant so much. It symbolised and determined so many things. It was the only thing that could perhaps save them all. It made it all
Pansy brought him in for a third embrace. “Okay, okay darling. You need him. I get it. I really do.” She muttered softly.
The trial hadn’t exactly gone in the direction that they were hoping. Many had testified on Draco’s behalf; he had been amazed to see the amount of people who had showed up to support him. Some students that had attended Hogwarts during his seventh year had testified in favour of him claiming that he had saved them from the Carrows torture, by pretending to crucio them. They had even commented on how he’d helped them all hide from the Carrows at times when they had been most vulnerable.
His father opened his mouth to speak but he cut him off. “Don’t you dare interrupt me.” He seethed. “You raised me to believe that we were right. That we were the good side. That the Dark Lord was great.” He hissed. “You raised me to become a
Hermione started to scream yet again. Her eyes puffy, her nose running, her body bloody and bruised. Draco felt sick. He needed to stop this. He needed to stop this Now.
He could've had everything with Theo. The person that treated him with kindness and love, something that Draco so desperately wanted. But instead he'd thrown it all away. For Potter. Why was it Potter. Why had it
Yes, hate the guy that had just been cut in half. He truly wondered what she would do if he was dead or something. He shivered, he really didn't want to find out.
One thing that Draco had always loved about his mother was her ability to make him smile even in his darkest of hours. He’d be crying on his bed, or curled up into a ball in the parlour, and she’d find him. She’d always find him.
Draco nodded, not sure of what else he could say. He feared that she’d react like this, he was used to it.
Pansy looked as if she were about to kill him. “I’ll show you hideous.” She threatened, pulling her wand out and advancing onto him.
Draco felt the air leave his lungs. His head was spinning, his heart was beating painfully within his chest. Everything hurt.
Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Sirius announced that he would think about inviting her to the farm. Draco didn’t understand why Sirius didn’t just do it straight away, but not only was he young and likely couldn’t understand the nuances and complexities of Sirius’ feelings towards his family, he had also only been away from his family for some weeks, almost two months or thereabouts, whereas Sirius and Andromeda had been cast out of the Black’s for years.
“I am possibly even more unavailable now than I was the last time you stayed here, Blaise.” Harry laughed, collapsing onto the sofa next to Draco, who immediately put his socked feet in Harry’s lap.
“If that’s all…” Ron said, flipping the duvet off him looking for all the world as if he’s about to manhandle Cedric out of the room.
Draco swallowed, mouth suddenly dry, and was so busy staring at boy number two that he missed their introductions. The next thing he consciously heard was the roar of the rugby team as they welcomed their newest additions.
“for fucks sake lads, do you not have a bedroom?” asked Harry, chuckling and moving into their kitchen so they could put their pants back on in privacy.
He’s sat at the little desk in his room, Theo off for the afternoon with Daphne, and his vision is wavering in and out of focus as he stares at his subjunctive worksheet and regrets every decision that brought him there. As much as he was loathe to admit it, he needed help, and there was only one person in his French class that he was even vaguely on talking terms with.
He took a deep breath. “I really don’t know anymore.” he told her dejectedly, for it was the best answer he could give her and himself.
He was confident that Potter wouldn’t be making an appearance, especially after his earlier outburst.
Draco let out a deep cry. Tears stained her robes as he let out a waterfall of sadness. “I’m such an idiot Pansy. Why am I like this? Why is this me?” he let out a distraught sob.
Weasley nodded. “She’s right mate. She’s dead right.” No, she was not right. But he wasn't about to disclose that. He valued his life.
She threw her hands to her lap dramatically. “It just feels so good to get it all out.” She breathed with relief. “I mean does he annoy me? Yes. Do I think that he should care more about his studies? Definitely. Do I sometimes want to hex him silly? Absolutely.” She declared and Draco had to admit that he was a little bit scared.
He nestled himself deeper into Ms Pritchett’s warmth as they grieved the little girl who had changed both their lives. Draco realised that he had taken a step. He had taken another step in accepting his true self. He was one step closer to Potter.
“I gave this to you almost two years ago.” He began and Draco’s heart started to beat rapidly within his chest.
To Draco’s complete and utter surprise, Weasley was sat at a desk stirring their potion with the upmost concentration and care.
“Don’t give me your snark.” His father warned, and Draco was certain that he was finally getting to him.
There was no going back now. He'd become a part of Potter and Potter had become a part of him. Last night had been all that he'd ever wanted. It was far more than he'd ever deserve.
Draco was surprised to find that he’d started to laugh. And not your average little laugh. No. his laugh was as big as a Hippogriff.
In all honesty, he had actually started to become quite partial towards the Hufflepuff's. Maybe it was their innocent smiles, or excited laughs, he didn't know. But whatever it was he felt the need to squash it. And he had to do it now!
So, it seemed that instead of spending Christmas alone basking in the peace and quiet, he was being shipped off to the noisy Weasleys. Great, just great.
Damn it! Why did it all come down to trust? Couldn't everyone in Hogwarts just believe others blindly for a few days and save Draco the hassle. He was tired.
Draco extended a hand which she took with her free one, “it’s very nice to meet you.” He said politely.
“Yes, you will!” Draco bit out his voice wavering slightly. “Everybody’s judging me. They’re always judging me.” His body started to shake, his palms heating up.
Potter looked up at him in concern, “You left so quickly, everyone was so worried so I left to come and find you, to put everyone’s minds at rest.” He answered simply and Draco’s face involuntarily fell.
Mrs Weasley’s cooking skills had not been exaggerated by Potter. Draco felt as if he could never eat again. He didn’t even want to eat again. Unless, it was Mrs Weasley’s cooking.
“No shut up. Shut the fuck up.” He snarled at Weasley. “Can’t you see? Don’t you understand? He won’t even bloody look at me anymore!” he screamed.
“She would come home crying every day. She wouldn’t eat. She wouldn’t sleep. She was just walking around like a ghost. I honestly was scared for her life.” She said through tears, and Draco felt violently sick.
“Okay Draco.” She agreed pulling him into one last hug. “I hope you’re not sad anymore and that you’ll draw something happy.” She whispered before running back to the Hufflepuff table. Draco smiled softly to himself, before retreating towards the doors of the Great Hall.
The little boy looked up to Draco with wide eyes. “Everybody knows that it’s risky to be involved with an evil man like that. What if his father does something wrong and He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named takes it out on Draco? What if he threatens him with his fathers life?” he questioned and Draco felt the air being knocked out of his lungs.
His thumb traces a long line along his jaw, and Draco shivers. Potter pushes him against the pillows and kisses him again, and Draco aches for him. “I’ll make it good. I always make it good.” Potter whispers reassuringly.
The Death Eater nodded, “Sorry man, I guess that does sound pretty terrifying, but I don’t understand why—”
“I do, however, know how I felt when I was with him though.” Draco carried on. “I felt free. As if all my problems just dissolved when I was with him. I felt strong, not weak. I felt accepted, cared about. I felt needed. As if he needed me as much as I needed him.” he said. “I still need him.” Draco admitted.
Weasley’s eyes softened. “You and I both know that whatever your relationship is, it’s not friendship.” he gave him a pointed look that Draco couldn't help but disagree with.
Kat stared back at him, eyes wide, quivering with fear. Her dress was torn, her body bloody. Her hair was matted, her smile was non-existent.
help, it was no where to be found. Maybe he was just unconventionally unlucky? Yes, that made sense.
Hermione pulled away from him, locking her desperate eyes onto his broken ones. She looked determined; it was once thing that he’d always admired about her. “You haven’t lost him. She spoke with forceful conviction.
How could you have enough of good people? It was just something that wasn't done. There were good people, and bad people. Opting to venture with the bad people was just ludicrous.
His rhythm is ferocious now as he pumps into him with everything he’s got. “Draco. Oh god, Draco.” He cries and Draco nods too far gone to speak. “So beautiful. You’re so, so beautiful.” he murmurs fucking deeper into him.
“But it’s my fault. It’s all my fault.” He choked out through tears, as he was engulfed into Ms Pritchett’s strong arms.
Draco nodded shakily. “Anyways.” He choked out. “For having such an amazing brain, you’re actually pretty stupid.” He got out and she glared at him. “Not the face. Not the face.” He screamed.
His family and he were still under heavy surveillance by the other Death Eater’s. They were still seen as soft, condemned by all. Draco letting the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts had spared their lives, his failure in assassinating his Headmaster and cost them their freedom.
“You want to know what’s wrong?” he spat and Potter’s eyes widened in concern. “My mother is weak. The man I’ve admired for my entire life is nothing but a deadbeat, idiotic fool who doesn’t care for me.” He bit out. “And let’s not forget the fact that I’m a Death Eater who’s dating Harry Potter, who may I add that I don’t deserve in the slightest.” He growled.
The boy froze. “Well, erm, I wanted, I mean if it wasn’t any inconvenience to get your blessing.” He spat out frantically.
His father attempted to speak but Draco cut him off. “No! You don’t get to talk anymore. You don’t deserve that privilege.” He growled. “Listen here and listen closely. I
He was at a complete loss. He had glitter in his hair and tape stuck to his fingers. His normally flawless hair was sticking up in all different directions, his cheeks were redder than a flock of Weasleys.
He didn’t have the foggiest clue as to who was actually guarding him. It was quite surprising, considering that his house had been overrun by Death Eater’s. You would’ve thought that he’d gotten to know all of them by now. Well, he hadn’t. Fat chance of that happening. Anyways, that still didn’t help him. He needed a plan and he need one now.
“Malfoy.” The cold voice stopped him in his tracks. He knew who it was. How could he not recognise the voice that had being rattling inside his head since first year?
The vote had been unanimous, with every single member of the Wizengamot voting in Draco’s favour. Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt had proudly declared Draco free from all charges, stating that a hero shouldn’t have been on trial in the first place.
His blessing? Who the fuck did he think Draco was? Kat's father. Last time he checked, Draco was only five around the time that Kat was born. So he had the smallest and he meant smallest huch that he wasn't biologically  related to Kat in that way.
Draco sighed, leading her towards a big window as they sat down on the lower ledge. If a first year had noticed, then what's to say that everyone else hadn't noticed.
It wasn’t much. A quick brush of the hand as he walked past, or a brief pat on his lower back if he came up behind him.
“So, I followed you. I realised that you spent every night by the lake, so I made sure that I was there. I convinced myself that it was because I thought that you were up to something. And maybe part of me thought that you were. But another part of me, a  bigger part of me just wanted to get to know you. To understand this new Draco that everyone seemed to like.” He admitted, and
there’s something wrong. Please Draco just tell me what’s wrong, I’m your best friend.” She pleaded and what was left of Draco’s heart broke for her.
This was definitely my favourite chapter to write by far! I absolutely love Ron! And the Hufflepuff army squad are adorable! I don't condone Harry's actions but I wanted to show the why to the what.
He didn’t know what was to think. He didn’t know what to feel. But the one thing he was quite certain about was that he didn’t want to talk about it with his father.
Kat jumped up and down ecstatically. “Really?” she beamed and the rest of them followed her, smiling and clapping frantically.
Draco chuckled. “As great as this all is, I think you guys better go back to your classes before you give Slughorn a heart attack.” He mused, gesturing to a quite green Slughorn.
She smiled, a questionable glint in her eye and Draco was scared. “That’s better.” She preened, and he concluded that she was not a girl to be messed with.
Draco turned away from him. “That won’t be necessary.” He muttered trying to not let the guilt he felt consume him.
He carried on, “I didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I just knew that you were gone. And I didn’t know how to handle that. You seriously don’t know how much I need you.” he admitted and Draco wanted to scream. Potter didn't need him. He shouldn't need him. Draco was bad for Potter. He was dangerous.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “It’s been a month since we spoke in your trial and we’ve spoken to you. A month of dinner cancellation and lunch rejections. This had gone on for too long.” She spat at him angrily.
Weasley growled. “Don’t remind me. I hate what he’s doing to my sister. Playing her like she’s a toy. “ he spat. “Although I can’t place the blame all on Harry. She’s only with him because he’s the bloody Boy Who Lived, she’s blinded by the fame and fortune. They’re both as bad as each other.” He resolved.
Was Draco meant to be intimidated? If that was the case, then these doofuses were doing a pretty shit job at it. “Maybe because I am?” he pointed out as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t want to take this outside. No, I want the bloody world to hear.” He spat, his eyes wide, pupils blown.
He wanted it to stop. He wanted it all to end. But he couldn’t stop. He wouldn’t stop. He had to save Hermione. He had to protect her. To keep her safe. He bore it, so she didn’t have to.
As she held her in his arms, he realised something. He realised that he could have given up. He could’ve ended it so many times. But he didn’t. He wouldn’t. He was a fighter. He was a survivor.
“No, you don’t!” He howled pulling abruptly away from her. “You can’t understand. Nobody understands.” He cried.
“If you were conscious right now, you’d probably be wondering why I tried to kill you.” He carried on and Draco swore that he were psychic. That was the only way that Potter would know what he was thinking.
So, he simply nodded. “Yes.” He answered solemnly. “Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way.” He carried on. “Now you can see that I’m not playing games with you?" he told him seriously.
Suddenly, a great bang erupted and all four of them turned to face Hermione, “This isn’t going anywhere.” She huffed, turning towards Pansy and Blaise. “Just admit that you two were wrong, and we can forget about it.” she urged them.
different to what he'd originally thought. But the Hufflepuff had almost killed him, Draco wasn't going to forget that very easily.
It had just gone nine when he got back to his dorm. Draco lay sprawled out on his bed, too late to be in the common room, but to early to go to the lake.
Hermione glared. “Oh Ronald. I can’t even with you anymore.” She bit out, giving him a look that deemed him a helpless child.
He re-read his Shakespeare. He thought about how, in a year, he would be taking the oxford entrance exams on his return to school. He saw Pansy, and Theo. Blaise was in Italy for the whole two weeks.
Draco hadn’t meant for it to sound so… disbelieving. Condescending. Impolite. Possibly even cruel, but alas, he had managed to sound like the biggest arse alive.
I undress and get into bed, turning my lights off and praying for the best. My hands are shaking, so I tuck them under my pillow. My wish doesn’t come true, and fifteen minutes later there is a quiet knock on my door and a soft “Draco?”
“Yeah, sure, I was about to do mine. Come in, we can do it together.” Harry said, turning and going back into his room. It took Draco’s mind a few seconds to catch up to Harry wanting him to follow. He walked in, looking around in wonder.
“It’s Harry’s day off” Sirius said, but the bags under his eyes and the paleness of his face made Draco believe that Harry was missing because of the dinner the night before.
She seemed like the best kind of mum, Harry thought. He imagined his mum would have been like that, worrying about his friends and offering to drop them home.
“Er, quite non-existent, actually. I haven’t done anything, with anyone” he says, unable to make eye contact.
The film was great, just as the last one had been, but Harry was more concerned at how tense Draco was when lying next to him, a world away from how comfortable and relaxed he had seemed the last time they watched a film together, even with the weight of his parent’s marital problems weighing on him.
His mum, the sneaky woman she was, insisted on going back to his room with him to check everything was okay with Harry. He should have known she had ulterior motives.
And just like that, Harry had a date. And just like that, Draco didn’t want Harry to call him anything other than darling ever again.
Then, at breakfast, Harry had said ‘hope to see you after the game, blondie’ and Draco had felt all warm inside ever since. Apparently, there was going to be a little party afterwards, to which Harry and Ron were bringing their girls, and Draco apparently counted amongst them too. It should have stung, but instead he felt rather special.
Later that night, Draco suddenly remembered his quest to learn harry’s music. “Hoozey!!” he blurted into the darkness.
Draco buried into the soft fabric and inhaled. He could smell Harry’s cologne and a slight tang of sweat that usually followed the rugby boys wherever they went. Draco usually finds it disgusting but when it was Harry it just... wasn’t. Imagine if the boys could see him now. For all that Theo seemed to genuinely like Harry and Ron, he would probably have a heart attack.
Draco looks like ice when Harry comes home, glinting blades, his eyes stars.  They’re alone.  “You couldn’t resist,” is all he says, but his tone is enough of a clue.
“Yeah, I don’t get it,” Ron’s saying, and Harry finds himself swallowing.  “You broke up with Gin to fuck a bloke,” he tells Harry, when this isn’t what he said; he opened a door; he didn’t…  “It’s been six months and you’ve got a bloke on the line who likes fucking.  I mean, there are more difficult sums.”
Wryly, Ginny’s sighing, and Harry wonders if it was easy for her to run out of patience with him, in the end.  She gestures with both hands in front of her.  “Big yellow toy you bought Lily,” she says, “in Tokyo last year.”  She’s explaining, Harry realises.  “Part of that Pokémon game?”
“Maybe –” Sirius finishes despite this, clear-eyed.  “Maybe it was always going to be this way, and there’s nothing that I could have done about it.”  Yet another shade of mocking humour glints from his face, serrated.  He glances off up the hill, and his fingers move to scratch the back of his hand.  “I’d rather this than what he did to get out of living with my
This is all a distraction, of course.  Draco gets a light easily enough, and Lupin’s breathing is easy to mimic.  He doesn’t know if he likes the taste, but of everything that he’s been inducted into over the years, this certainly has the easiest spells.
“Nah.”  Harry shakes his head, stopping, turning around, still in bluebells and birdsong.  “No,” he says, as if they really need to understand.  “Hermione’ll just badger you, always, and she’s either nice about it or she isn’t.  Me…”  He stalls, as though he was running up towards this, but has lost his nerve anyway.  “I dunno what I do.”  He won’t look up, kicking one bare muddy foot idly through the dewy flowers.  “But I know that liking me is dangerous to your health.”
Harry pulled back, blinking into the dimness of the room.  The source of light which he could see above them was harsh, somehow, but then he hugged Hermione and she was warm, her hair large and bushy and soft against his cheek.
When he enters the man’s mind this time, Draco shuffles through thoughts like a healer seeking out a loose tooth.  He needs something raw, a little painful, but not so deeply personal that it will make his skin crawl to see it.  He needs to limit the backlash, no matter that he could probably, with effort, find his way to whatever he desired.  Black’s occlumency is not that advanced.
This was a jungle.  This was the chaos of black space, and Potter was the sun.  Draco had thought, a few weeks ago…  Well, he hadn’t
On the last Hogsmeade trip of the year, exams are well enough over and everyone’s in high spirits – some of them even higher than that.  The summer – which belongs to Gryffindor, surely – is so vividly near that they can taste it.  The Three Broomsticks barely cares for anyone’s age, but for the uptight there are plenty of generous buyers over seventeen, and Slytherin is wilting in the sunshine, unlikely to come near a pack of Gryffindor that is practically the whole of seventh down to third.  After all, they keep third and fourth under very close watch these days.
“In one of our recent SMS exchanges he successfully remembered to ask what I had been up to.  So I told him.  He seemed to think that it meant more than it does.”
A shrug, dismissing Lupin’s tone.  “Something more dramatic, I suppose.  And of course it was that long ago,” Sirius goes on.  “You only had to do the rounds once.”  He puts on a squeaky voice, pushing.  “
“Don’t be stupid,” Harry tells him, and he fears that he’s blushing.  It was Hermione, he tells himself, because he doesn’t remember.  Hermione’s the only one of them who’s ever fancied a teacher…  And it was Lockhart, not Lupin, wasn’t it?
that?  Exactly,” George seems to agree, looking annoyed, his hair thicker and redder than Ron’s and his scowl more intense.  He lifts his pint, and Harry feels terrible.  “Never define us?” he quotes after swallowing.  “My brother is dead!  But I told you,” he goes on, as though this wound is old and familiar, and Harry feels worse, “she says she went off him the first time that she saw him throw up in a drain.”
“They can hold out for longer than you think,” he insists, sounding reckless, with a quick grin.  This is clearly a spell from the Gryffindor common room, rather than anywhere reputable.  “It’s a very orange flame.”
“I think it’s nice that Draco makes you cuddly, Harry,” Luna says warmly, leaning forward to pick out another cake.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry tells her, meeting her assessing brown eyes.  “Maybe it’s wanting to spend Christmas with my children.”
When the point lands, a second piece of news but not strange at all, just exciting, Harry bursts out laughing, pressing the base of one palm to his forehead.  Draco squeezes the other, and Harry wants this to be his life, so badly.  “Did you know about this too?” he can’t help but ask him.
It’s been a year since Harry opened a door in his head, and at this point he’s long walked through.  The other side is only the other side of the wall and the world remains much as it was – but it’s different.  He’s in a different room and there are different things here; different parts of himself.  He doesn’t know if they’re better, but there’s a fresh breeze.
“He was making friends with the Hogwarts mermaids at the time,” he explains.  “And he never brushes his hair.”
“And then I thought,” Andromeda pitches in, as if Harry hadn’t been the focus of her thoughts at all, “if we’re having Harry, why not Teddy’s Uncle Ron and Auntie Hermione?”
“You said that it couldn’t be found.”  Malfoy’s cradling the books, looking down as though they’re newborn animals.  “You said that you were sick of going through Pince.”
– Harry’s coming all over them, his vision flashing incandescent even as he closes his eyes and curls up.
“Harry, I’ve been doing tricks for months.”  Teddy’s amber eyes are deeply sarcastic.  “I can do a 360.”
The leopard yawns, showing its teeth, before it whips off into the darkness as though a thousand miles is nothing to cover at all, running down surf to the sea.
Harry freezes, clenching his fists.  There’s something he’s not saying, but he doesn’t say it, so Draco doesn’t know what it is.  They’re separated by a rug.  The room smells faintly of turning soil, and Draco thinks that it’s coming from him.  All the white and grey in here is awful.
“And it’s a common misconception,” Draco adds for information, “that only Slytherin was involved in the Carrows’ dirty regime.”  He’s ended up looking at his sofa, the square blue lines of it.  “Some of Ravenclaw were sadistic little shits, really, and there was a Hufflepuff sixth year whose name I can’t remember now…”
The bar was very nearly a nightclub now, the music louder than Draco remembered from when he’d arrived, the dancefloor fuller of friends and presumably friends of friends, admirers, hangers on.  Leaving the booth’s bubble of quiet, Potter was easy to find, jumping with a group as though the place was playing thrash metal, when Draco was fairly sure that the muggles called it disco.  It felt like the sound was coming out of the floor.
Lupin says, standing up, setting his tea to one side.  He doesn’t leave the room, no matter that Harry’s expecting it.  He wanders over to the window, looking out into the garden as though these are the manners he’s been taught.  He makes James snort.
“I never joke about the DMLE,” Harry says, before groaning, because Draco’s moving, leaving him cold.
His dad ignores him, wand in hand as he hikes a leg straight over the low garden wall at the end of the Dursleys’ lawn and into the flowerbed, presumably, before striding heavily towards the door.  He’s slammed a thumb against the doorbell before Harry can react.
“Angel, come here,” James Potter says quite seriously, drawing his wife into his lap and kissing her on the neck.  He’s worked it all out, Draco thinks.
Draco risked a glance at Potter, who shrugged.  He wasn’t getting it, apparently, but he could tell that Draco’s questions weren’t aimless.
Even as he says this, however, Ron and Hermione are looking at each other.  Ron’s pulling a face and Hermione’s offering an opaque little shrug.
– and Teddy stands up straight, putting down the knife.  It’s incongruous in Harry’s never fitted, slightly shabby kitchen, a massive wooden table at its heart.  The walls are teal blue.
he can’t help but hint, implication in his tone, and for some reason this makes Draco burst with incredulous silent laughter, tucked towards his midnight blue shoulder.
With a clean run of unbroken small talk, Lupin ends up relaxing into Mrs Figg’s seat on the sofa, entirely by accident, Harry assumes not.  She’s left to perch on the armchair – cats dislodged – looking distinctly ill-at-ease with her teacup and saucer.
The shift in Kreacher’s demeanour now is a sudden and unexpected treat.  “Mr Lupin,” he croaks unguardedly, and the
“Mm,” complains Harry, feeling half-drunk.  He thinks he’s heard a ping, some sort of sting in his ear.
” Harry calls it for now, an ache in his chest.  The unicorn meets his gaze again, and its eyes are kind, its mane an artful mess that it tosses.  “
He’s almost to the front door before he registers the footsteps barrelling behind him.  They’re Ron’s.  Fucking Ronald fucking Weasley is here to keep Draco fucking Malfoy from leaving through the door of his fucking honeymoon fucking house that he shares with Hermione fucking mudblood Granger who was tortured, there, before Draco’s eyes, shrieking and breaking apart from her mind like she should have always been fucking shorn, too fucking clever for her own fucking birthright as cattle, the fucking,
” she suggests, looking at Harry wickedly over her teacup.  “It’s the only thing more interesting than your political divisions.”
“You have a go at me,” Harry continues, light glinting off his glasses, “but then there’s you.  You never sleep, you hardly eat, and you refuse to act like any of us are your friends.”
“Malfoy could never’ve done what Snape did,” he says sharply to his father.  “It would’ve killed him, playing spy.”
“How is he faring?” McGonagall asks, apparently to make conversation.  It takes Harry a moment to realise that she’s asking after Sirius, who isn’t dead.  “It must be a shock to come back after all this time.  I never did have a chance to speak with him during the war.”
“He’s been dithering about proposing for months,” Hermione tells Harry, fondly with a sarcastic look.
“There’s something he’s not saying,” Harry allows about Sirius, in the end, because he can’t help himself.  Draco’s tight arm is making Harry’s t-shirt ride up, and he’s entirely without scruple, running fingers up Harry’s spine.  “How am I supposed…?”  It feels almost impossible, to Harry, getting these words out of his lungs.  “I don’t know how to be this person, chasing down every second mystery and only finding something worse at the end of it.  I don’t –”
Shaking himself, Harry shrugs.  “I mean that me and Draco hired a car.  Went down France.  It was nice.”
Like the seasons, Harry thinks – like an eclipse, like an astronomical event – the moment of the Mirror of Erised comes but once in twenty years, and Harry’s fucked it all up.  His chance is long gone.  Sometimes he thinks about this upon waking.  Sometimes he’s not thinking of anything, too busy reaching for water while his heart pounds, because the dream ends a different way, his hands burning chimaeras, unknown dangers pressing in behind his head.
“But that’s mad,” Sirius is protesting, and Harry feels nothing but a great sucking well of shame.  “He loves flying; he could have gone professional – Prongs, he’s…”
In the mornings, Harry can’t lie in bed.  It’s worse in the dark when he’s alone, in the castle with only frail light coming in through the arrowslit windows.  For too many years, growing up, lying on his own in the dark was the only pastime he had and he can’t bear it now.
And Harry disapparates to Malfoy’s flat, because his insides are curdling and he’s done enough damage and he’s already losing control.
Maybe this wasn’t a job for Potter after all.  Though Merlin knew what he was going to do in a school full of children.
At four o’clock in the afternoon, on the thirty-first of October, 2008, in expensive jeans, a white t-shirt and his aviator jacket – a look which Draco has recently described as
They tend to row as their way of communicating.  Over a decade ago, is Harry’s point now, they agreed that an elf in his eighties should only have to cook, and not all the time.  There’s no way that Teddy’s been dusting, whatever Kreacher tries to pretend.
They’d been walking the hills for a week now, trousers tucked into socks against ticks.  Against the soothing sounds of the woodland, Draco broached a subject that he’d been trying to avoid.
He cast spells to protect them, Harry Potter, one, two, three after each other, one hand caught on Draco’s elbow.  Draco noticed the feeling, but couldn’t place it.  He couldn’t really see his other hand when he tried to hold it in front of his face.
It’s so petty, all of Kreacher’s silver.  Harry’s not thought about it until now.  Silver only harms werewolves if they ingest it or it enters an open wound, and there’s no way that enough traces have been getting in the food to cause Lupin physical upset.  James has been serving him first at every meal anyway, to make sure that what he eats hasn’t touched the sides.  But even then, maybe Harry should’ve…
But he remembers.  He remembers when he felt no shame, and he wants to be a lion like that lion Aslan in Teddy’s books, set in that frozen wood beyond the wardrobe.  He wants to swap places with every cheeky little shit spoilt child and take the knife for them, and then let them keep the Turkish delight.  He wants to rise from the table and see the end of the ice and the snow.
Draco came downstairs the next morning to see three Gryffindors sitting only in t shirts and underwear at the table, ravenously digging into a full English. He was suddenly struck by how young and boyish Harry looked when he wasn’t looking after Teddy. It was, attractive, Draco had to admit. As was the small golden hoop earring glinting in his ear, which certainly hadn’t been there the day before. In fact that was more than just attractive, it was hot. ‘be calm my raging libido, he hates me right now’ thought Draco to himself, before helping himself to bacon and plopping down at the table.  The three collectively groan at the sound, and he laughs at the teenage-ness of it all. He feels young and free for the first time in a long time. He considers that Dean and Seamus must have slept at Grimmauld in a spare room, as the double bed was no longer in the nursery, having been transfigured back to its original state.
He arrived in saint mungo’s around 20 minutes later, hot, sweaty and flustered with the Weasley matriarch in tow. When they were showed to the private room Teddy was in, Harry collapsed into Molly’s arms, tears running down his cheeks with wild abandon.
“oui, bien sur, je suis desolee” Potter responds in an upsettingly good French accent. Rugby boys weren’t supposed to be good at things like French. This was Draco’s domain, where he reigned.
He supposed he should make somewhat of an effort now. He would hate for the other five to form a tentative group only for him to be left entirely on the outside, and he owed Potter big time given that the Saviour was carrying the load of a death-eater, for nothing in return. The thought made Draco uncomfortable. He didn’t know how to do this. He knew how to be mean, and sarcastic and bitchy; he knew how to make enemies but he didn’t know how to make friends. Politics had always done that for him.
He had overheard Harry and Ron discussing it whilst he did his classics homework- as the only one who did classics, he was always alone when working for it.
“I want lots of things, Harry. Right now, I want to be there for you the way you’re always there for me”
“Ron, ‘Mione and I are going to this open air cinema thing in the village in a few days if you want t’come?” Harry asked, casting his eyes back to the sky.
“What do you want, Cedric?” Ron asked in his low, no-nonsense voice, and Harry was so grateful for him.
Draco kicked her and she laughed and said, “don’t lie Dray darling, you wish you were there too.” He turned bright red and knocked back the rest of his glass before immediately pouring himself more.
Feeling unusually brave at having Harry in his room, Draco climbs onto his bed, and sits on the other end of it, cross legged.
“Just to see how well you’re all settling in. let me know if you need anything, Harry” Cedric said, eyes trained on Harry, still simpering pathetically.
Draco was astounded, both at Sirius’ kindness and his confession. He had always known his family were not perfect, the opposite in fact. He still hadn't realised they were capable of such mindless cruelty.
The end of the film found him tearing up, his body filled with bittersweet emotion. He tried to sniff, quietly but the wetness of the tears gave him away.
They had an early dinner, and Draco suspected it was because his mum was allowing, he and Harry an uninterrupted evening. He both hated and loved her for it.
“yea. My uh... Tonks hurt herself so her and Remus are off to the hospital and Sirius is on babysitting so he was hoping I could stay the night here, if that’s okay? I can't get to Remus's house easily from here, sorry.”
So, he did French, and now English? He was invading Draco’s domain. Draco also found it hard to believe a boy with that many muscles was also able to appreciate the beauty of Shakespearean sonnets. Draco also maybe kind of resented the fact that Theo must be in this boy's class, and Draco just had to be in the other one.
“Tell me more about your dream josh, then” Harry said, his face close enough to Draco’s that Draco could feel the warmth of his breath.
“I must say Potter, I am enjoying your company much more than I had expected to. I’m sure Pansy and I will join you. Bear in mind though, Pansy needs upwards of two hours to get ready.”
“I'm sorry you let it hold you back from relationships.” Harry whispered into the space between them.
“please assemble into your groups, and then I will call the name of one person in each group to collect all your wands and present them to me, and then I will give you your portkey, and your charmed device for emergencies. Thank you.”
“I say lads, who are we all bringing to the Halloween ball?” said Theo, clearly wishing to flaunt his steady girlfriend. The ball was next Saturday, the final day at school before the two weeks off for October. The school hosted it every year, for years ten through thirteen.
Draco spent the rest of the morning in a daze. Now all the food was eaten, his bag was at its lightest, which was a godsend to his ruined legs, and every time he caught sight of Potter he could remember how it felt to kiss him and a sense of bliss descended on him. Even Potter chatting constantly with bloody Talgarth wasn’t enough to dull Draco’s spirits, until he saw the group ahead draw to a stop, and saw McGonagall standing there, Portkey waiting to send them back to Hogwarts.
His reply was appropriate it seemed, as he smiled at Draco and nodded. “I can imagine. Life seems so fast-paced in London. I much prefer it here”
“I swear they’re going to get married” said a deep voice from his shoulder. Draco turned abruptly, and found himself staring into the triumphant, smirking face of Harry. Draco felt himself blush and hoped the low lights of the room covered it.
“I had a lovely evening, Draco and I hope to see you again soon. Harry, come with me” and she grabbed his arm, basically frog-marching him out of the cottage. Draco grinned at her matronly-ness and got up to get ready for bed (and possibly try and hear their conversation from his bedroom).
“Aye, that he did,” Harry replied. Draco marvelled at the thick Yorkshire accent and was scared to speak lest they laugh at his accent as well.
Seemingly eager to change the subject, Sirius stopped abruptly and said “right. We just need to pick up Hermione then it’s home for lunch” with forced cheer.
“it’s okay Parkinson. What happened in the war stays in the war, in my opinion. You did what you did to help those you love and I’m sure others would have done the same. Hogwarts was my home and you and your little group were not so bad as to ever change that. The only person who ever made me feel unsafe at Hogwarts was Voldemort, and perhaps snape in first year” -here Draco snorted- “and maybe I haven’t forgiven it all but like Draco said I have moved past it” Pansy just clutched at him harder, and Harry remembered that as old as they may all feel, Pansy is only an eighteen-year-old girl struggling to reconcile herself with mistakes she made in the past. He stroked her back and rocked her slightly, as he did with Teddy. Draco stood up and mouthed to Harry that he would talk to Blaise, before silently leaving the room.
He must have finally fallen asleep, because he woke again in the middle of the night, ensconced in the warmth of Harry’s arms around him. He started grinning uncontrollably again, and turned in Harry’s embrace so he was facing him. He ran his hands up Harry’s arms, over his shoulders, down his chest. He pressed little kisses to Harry’s cheeks and nose, giggling quietly in the darkness, too overwhelmed by the fact that Harry wanted him.
And – Harry finds himself letting it go, giving up on this secret.  It’s like something’s torn from him.  “It’s not nice,” he sneers, rubbing a thumb through one of his eyebrows.  “And it’s not clean.  Someone would’ve had to kill me anyway, because it wouldn’t’ve left me any less of a horcrux.  But it would’ve bought us time, and maybe we’d’ve found the others.”  Maybe he could have lived as he was, and they could have kept Voldemort’s shade in a jar.
Teddy’s grandmother wasn’t impressed.  Lily wasn’t quite born, when Teddy turned ten.  Harry doubts that Teddy remembers it.
If Harry were thinking in thoughts, he would expect for his mum to be distraught.  Instead, her expression is focused and sharp.  She spits questions at the healers, then insists on hovering Harry’s dad herself up the stairs to their room, because it’s a first-year charm and she was always very good at it.  She pronounces it something like
“He can call me Dad if he wants to,” James immediately retorted, breaking through the group to wrap an arm around Harry’s shoulders.  “I
.  Also, he thought that they’d been busy with the cause of the gay liberation.  “When have you been doing that?”
At this, Lee laughs high in his nose, and then he’s covering his mouth, his shoulders shaking.  It’s because of the surreality of Harry talking about Draco Malfoy in the same breath as he talks about romance, Harry thinks – or something like that.  He can see the joke and he can appreciate Lee laughing, but he doesn’t find it funny, feeling hot.  It’s the first time that he’s said any of this out loud.
They talk.  They’ve been talking for years now, in seminars and mandatory sessions of mutual supervision.  They talk about Granger’s boyfriend, the ways that he’s slow but more often the ways that he’s quick.  They do not talk about his secret interest in engagement rings, because Draco is rarely a bastard to Granger anymore – because of time or because of love, perhaps, though neither is his area of expertise.
The outburst is unfair, Draco knows.  If anyone understands him out of this lot, then it’s surely Black, who seems to be setting himself up as some sort of bastard uncle that Draco never knew he had.  His face is full of surprise, grey eyes stormy with understanding and deep, clear guilt, of the kind that Draco feels so deeply.
Rolling his eyes, Harry remembers himself.  “It’s too late for that anyway,” he says dully.  “I’ve left him.”
A couple of times, Malfoy can’t make it, and Harry has nothing to do, so he goes and eats on his own.
“Potter, will you calm down?”  It feels odd to call another man by that name, especially one whose legs are wibbling.  Draco ends the jinx.  “You’ve found yourself in the Department of Mysteries, do you understand?”  You’re the bloody mystery, he thinks.
“Seriously, Malfoy,” Harry says, peering behind him through the door to the sitting room, fixing his glasses on his face.  “No one should be able to get in here.”
And that’s Lily’s voice, Harry hears, coming from his own back pocket.  She sounds tearful – and she looks it, when Harry’s flipped open the case.
Thinking of a handshake, Harry steps back and flicks his wand.  He expects his office in two seconds to be full of a shining magic-white stag, ducking its antlers away from the ceiling and making Puff squeak, rear up and, yes, very likely breathe out another stream of pompoms.
As the light outside turns to dawn, Harry leaves them because he knows that he doesn’t deserve them, and he knows what will keep them safe.  He slips out of the door and makes his way downstairs, turning through the empty doorway to the flat.
“I didn’t know that he was coming,” Harry fails to defend himself, looking past her shoulder to the warm, smart colours of the room.  He can see his Draco, not the baby, small in the corner of Hogwarts' great hall, clinging to the panelling.  “He came with Luna and Ollivander.”
