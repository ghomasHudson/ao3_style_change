“You stand to get the same treatment, Neville,” Harry said. “Lord Hufflepuff,” he added with a smirk.
“You still need me,” Dumbledore protested when it registered what they had said before, about him being forced out of the castle.
“For those staying,” Professor McGonagall said as she got up after Lily sat down, “Headmistress Potter had kindly provided some entertainment for us. The Falmouth Falcons will be playing a charity match against the Appleby Arrows on the quidditch pitch after lunch,” she finished getting a cheer from the magicals in the Great Hall.
“Interesting,” the hat said as it was placed on Neville’s head. “Hufflepuff’s heir. Very loyal, but only to those that deserve it, brave, yes, I see it here, cunning too, quite the snake you would make. Where should we put you…”
“I still don’t understand why you want to go to Hogwarts so badly, Harry,” Neville said as he placed his trunk on the floor.
“Vigilance, Caspian. Watch my son closely, and keep them away, until we can organise a gathering. Harry’s fated, if he indeed has one, will be almost as powerful as he is. If his mate is here and they touch, Hogwarts very well might collapse under the pressure.”
“As you wish, your Highness.”
“Right,” Neville said as he made his way to the stool and sat down. He must have been really out of it to not notice the first years had finished being sorted.
Lily had to take many calming breaths, she could feel her magic pulsing under her skin, singing for revenge, and it was something she would take. She would make them suffer, but first, she had to take claim of what was hers.
“Yes, Lady Lily.”
“You git. I still can’t believe you pushed that on to me,” Neville said disgruntled.
“Poppy, take us to the receiving room, and I think a cup of tea would be nice. And something for young Neville here.”
“I am not a Queen, Rugnuk, and you are a king, why do you bow?”
“What others?” Khidell asked, looking at the Professor.
So while treats were given, they were given sparingly, while trips were taken, they were taken only on special occasions. Outings were special treats, the boys both learnt to do small chores around the house and presents were given only on Christmas, birthdays and other special holidays. So while Harry was being spoilt beyond ever before, Dudley was not. That had the added side effect of improving Dudley's behaviour.
Her husband’s will was read, Sirius Black was in the process of being exonerated and wasn’t Lily pissed off about that, the goblins were moving to free him before she had left the building.
“Are you Unseelie?” Sirius asked surprised.
Lily Potter sat behind her desk frowning at the report Meri was giving her. She looked over at Alice and tried very hard not to smirk at the look on her face.
Lily smiled but said nothing, there was nothing to say. The Fae were a beautiful race, they were spellbinding in a lot of ways and used their beauty as much as they used their power.
“Depending on the severity of the offence, you will receive anything from point loss and detention to suspension and expulsion. A few of you, having gone over the records, are on your last chance.
“Mummy, don’t be mean to Siofra, she doesn’t know any better,” Harry said frowning at his mother. “We just need to teach her.”
“Your King saved your life this day, remember that,” Lily hissed harshly before turning to her son. She pulled him from Khidells’ hold and held him close. “What is it, sweetheart?”
“James,” she whispered as she rested against the door frame, closing her eyes in sorrow. It felt like a part of her was missing, and the ache felt like it would never heal.
“We shall see if we can turn even one of Draco’s parents. I do not hold out much hope for Lucius, but Narcissa has shown to love her son beyond all else.”
Harry and Neville watched as Hermione seemed to fall in on herself, in a defeated sort of way, before straightening her spine and huffing.
“You have traitors in your midst Khidell and they are not the only ones, just the only ones here,” Lily said. She replaced his sword and moved her hand to place her fingers to his forehead, “
Harry and Neville walked into the room, hands still clutched together for comfort as they looked around at the people there.
“I’m sure he will forgive you eventually, Neville,” Harry said of Caspian’s attitude towards him.
“I miss him to mum,” Harry said and pressed a kiss to her cheek. “It’s the main reason I wanted to come here,” he added causing his mum to smile brightly at him.
“Yes, Fae,” Lily said smiling, “and if anyone can fix your son and daughter-in-law, it is my people.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said, while Caspian frowned. “But we don’t tend to let people just fire questions at us,” he added at Capsians look.
“I am so sorry Harry, more than you know. I could say it was the agitation of all the waiting but really, my mouth worked before my brain caught up.”
“Of course, your Highness,” Khidell said and called a guard to him, having a whispered conversation before six of the guard smoked away.
“Lily?” Charlus asked, shaking his head as if to clear it. “Dorea,” he called, his voice high with anxiety.
“Are?” Sirius asked, “I thought they were dead?”
“See Neville, it won't be long and then you can touch Luna,” Harry said smirking at his brother. “We will have to make sure Treva has a front seat to the event.”
“I never should have let you talk me into leaving you behind,” Godric whispered to the now dubbed Fawkes.
“Lily,” came from Snape, his voice brittle and broken.
“Have you been torturing Tom Riddle or Severus Snape?” Alice asked, annoyed, “and why did you not think to invite me along?”
“Why is my mother a Fae now?” Frank asked again, trying to hide his annoyance.
“They will be sent along soon, but we need to get settled and prepared. You know what is involved.”
“He tore your family apart, he deserves everything that comes his way,” Khidell said, “he has not even started to be punished for what he has done.”
“I need to get my godson,” Lily said, “I promised Alice I would take him if she couldn’t.”
“How so?” Malfoy asked as he moved into the compartment.
“Lily,” Dorea whispered, her eyes wide, “you saved Harry.”
“Yes Lady Lily,” Daisy said with a relieved smile, “Daisy will waits for your call,” and popped away.
“Maybe we should go out there and introduce ourselves,” Harry suggested.
“No, she said she did not have to explain herself to those beneath her and vanished,” Draco said looking put out.
“Great,” Augusta said as she moved to sit up. “Young, healthy, spry,” she added, smiling brightly.
“Sure it will, but that’s the point isn’t it,” Harry said laughing at the look on Neville’s face as his mum pushed him down the corridor.
“So that’s what Najee and Nyad are doing?” Harry asked.
all properties
“He was dumped on our doorstep, with nothing but a note, telling us you were dead.”
“I am,” Xeno cleared his throat, “it seems I am unsure how to address you,” he finished, swallowing nervously. “In the wizarding world, it would be Lord Potter.”
“Cas, please,” Harry whined as his face reached a new level of red.
“Lily?” he gasped as his knees began to buckle. Lily conjured a chair before he could fall and smiled as he sunk into it. “How?”
“Khidell?” Lily asked, her voice barely above a whisper in her worry.
“....”
Harry laughed at not only Godric's turn of phrase but at the look on his face. “You have been spending way too much time with Sirius,” he said, smirking the man.
He would be regretting that thought almost immediately when the morning came.
“Today is a very special day for our people,” Lily started, smiling at the crowd. “Today we will be heading back to Elphyne for one of our most honoured traditions, the Gathering. We hold these events so that our kind may find their life partners if they have one. Many among you have been discovered as halflings, and as such have been invited to attend this event, Seelie and Unseelie alike will be attending in hopes of discovering their other half.
“Smart, ambitious, kind, loyal, cunning, strong, brave. Mr Potter, you could do well in any house, but the one that will help you most, better be…”
“Of course your Highness,” he replied as he took a seat.
“Cute as ever my King,” Caspian said as he moved up to flank Harry.
“Ready mum,” Harry answered and reached over to squeeze her hand.
“Wait,” Charlus said, and smirked at his daughter-in-law, “they say the Fae are descended from the Gods.”
“The Minister and Dumbledore have plans to overtake the school. It seems Dumbledore has neglected to inform them that Fae are all over Hogwarts. He has dismissed the rumours circulating that you are indeed Fae as propaganda to overtake the Ministry,” Nyad finished with a bloodthirsty smile.
“Abscondunt scientiam protegam hanc revelationem,” Lily said as she threw her hands out, encompassing the whole room and everyone in it.
“But there is a prophecy,” Dumbledore stated.
A small smile played on Harry’s lips at the look on Capsian’s face. He turned to Neville and actually laughed at the look of horror on his face. Caspian had never threatened Neville before, and Harry couldn’t say it wasn’t amusing to see.
“Daisy not be knowing, Daisy only know that when we be told by Dumbleydore to work at Hogwarts, the Portraits be awake. Lord Potter order us to do what Dumbleydore says.”
“Not that we can tell,” Ivy said as she moved over to place a hand on Narcissa’s arm. “They have had a significant power boost and finished their second awakening as you know. But other than that, all we can tell, until they wake up, is that they are healthy and stable.”
“New teachers have been brought in, new classes added and old ones returned. The Prefects and Head Boy and Girl will be reviewed and either left in place or replaced as we check their records, and of course the most important thing, Hogwarts will go back to being free. Any tuition paid this year will be returned and the only expense for attending here is your uniforms and school supplies. Though please note that any family struggling with the cost, the Foundation has funds set aside to help out.”
“That is indeed not common knowledge,” Capsian said, frowning slightly at the blonde boy. He then looked around the room at all the children, blinking in surprise. “Excuse me, my Prince,” Caspian said as he moved to go speak with Lily.
“Being in the same room as you taints the very air, and makes my stomach turn,” she said and turned to one of the invisible guards. “Magus, take this thing and put it in the dungeons.”
Augusta Longbottom came home quickly, the prickle under her skin too much to bear, and walked into the receiving room, stopping dead in her tracks. Her grandson was sitting on the lap of Lily Potter, who was supposed to be dead, with Sirius Black sitting beside her.
“Hello love, how are you this morning, any nerves?” Alice asked as she hugged and kissed Harry, then her son.
“Yes,” Lily said.
“I have no idea,” Lily answered, “but I’m sure he is aware of the guards being Fae, and of course he would have to be completely stupid to not understand that Harry will be Fae too, and we all know he is a lot of things but stupid isn’t one of them.”
Harry sat on the couch in the common room he and Neville shared, patting his snowy owl. It had taken almost all weekend for Lily, Godric and Helga to talk to the staff and fix as many problems as they could.
“That is good news, Sirius, but what else have you been doing, I know that look after all,” Lily said smirking at him.
“Well if nothing else, it will be fun to mess with him. It has been rather boring here. Nothing but training, etiquette lessons and the like,” Neville said, trying and failing to contain a yawn. Though he did enjoy the fighting lessons, Nyad was a badass teacher, and Godric was awesome when he stepped in to help with training.
“Your Highness,” Khidell said, getting to his feet quickly to help Lily up.
“Crap,” Neville muttered. Caspian would kick Nyad’s arse and then Neville would pay the price when Nyad found out why it happened. Stupid Fae need for revenge.
“Najee, Nyad, you have your mission,” Lily said as they stood in front of the portal. The guards nodded and moved through the portal without a word.
Mother: Lily Lorelei Potter nee Evan
“Yes,” Harry squealed in delight.
“Oh, yes I have those,” Lily said and held out her hand calling the items forth, “I always thought they were just family heirlooms.”
“Of course, he is Heir to the Potter line,” Lily said with a smile, before turning to Harry, “another ring for you to wear,” she said, causing him to pout and fidget with the one he was already wearing.
She couldn’t help her laughter and the look on her son’s face and he flung his hand out, coping her movements and frowned when nothing happened.
“Lily Potter? Is she, look at the ears,” they all heard, causing their guard to spread out and block the view of the gawkers.
“What do I need to do?” Harry asked.
“What about the other Death Eaters?” Narcissa asked.
“All is possible with magic, especially our kind,” Lily said with a vicious smile at the old man. “You will pay for what you did to my family, and my son.”
the voice whispered.
“Would you like me to remove him from your sight, my Prince,” Caspain said, turning to eye Neville for the first time since he entered the room.
“She will be regretting her life choices soon enough,” Khidell growled, screwing up his copy of the paper and setting it on fire in his anger.
“A boon indeed,” Augusta said as she opened her eyes, and smiled at her grandson.
“Stop it, mummy,” Harry said through his giggles. When she ceased he added, “the light told me stuff.”
“You think I should name my owl after the Goddess?” Harry asked incredulously. “I think she may come down and smite me for the insult,” he added, smiling as Neville laughed.
Gypsysue
“Just remember, hold your questions until we are safely in a Potter property,” Lily said and smiled when he nodded. “Okay, let's go deal with the Dursley’s and then get out of here, how about that?” Lily asked.
“They should all be feeling that right about now,” Godric said.
They had been debating over breakfast whether it was a good idea for Lily to go with the group to take Harry and Neville to Platform 9 and ¾ but the write up had outed her as being alive, which made the whole discussion pointless.
“Yes,” Harry said, giving his mum a shaky smile. “When are the other’s coming through?
“I named him Ash when he came to me as a boy. He put up with the childish name with as much grace as a powerful immortal creature could,” Godric said with a sad laugh.
“Remove the old man from the castle,” Harry said frowning at the Headmaster.
“So Siofra will be returning with us, after the gathering? Are they sure she is completely ready?” Lily asked Sirius after they had been informed of everything else going on.
Harry smiled brightly at her, he had asked about his toy dog a few times, “okay mummy, go, go,” he said shooing her out of the room.
“Elves hear things, Mistress. We hear that Dumbleydore be trusting Snapey cause he comes to Dumbleydore and pledges his loyalty. Snapey tells Dark Lord part of a Prophecy, Dark Lord target Mistress and family, Snapey begs for Mistress, but Dark Lords kill her anyways.”
“Where are they?”
Harry sat up abruptly, and smiled brightly at his mother, “I met dad,” he said, his excitement and happiness shining through.
“The Goblins were left in charge of the financial side of the school and the Guidelines of Hogwarts, the book on how to run Hogwarts was left behind for every Headmaster to follow.
“Has he hurt you often?” his gran asked, taking careful hold of her grandson’s hand. Neville nodded his head, yes, and buried himself into Lily’s chest, another small sob leaving him.
“I will be, just the memory of your father is all over this place. I miss him.”
“You should have a ring for Prince Harry, and there should be a necklace. The ring should be placed on Prince Harry’s finger, and the necklace is to be worn by his Regent, which I would assume would be you,” Rugnuk said.
Lily pulled her son close and held on as her laughter mingled with her tears and she finally purged the last of her grief. “We never did get enough time together,” Lily said as she pulled back from her son.
Rugnuk gentle took Harry’s hand into his and pierced the tip of his finger with the blade, and let a few drops fall into the potion. He waved his hand over the small prick and healed it instantly.
“Just be grateful it’s the only one I shoved on you,” Harry said with a glare, “that can change you know. Besides you know that if Helga hadn’t agreed it wouldn’t have happened at all.”
She sighed as she felt the magic build-up, and for the first time was glad for the wards the old coot put up. It would dampen the awakening magic. She knew this was coming, she wouldn’t have been able to do the things she had done in his mind if he wasn’t going to be like her. She had clung to that part of him that lay dormant in his body, using it to achieve her goals.
“Daisy is not knowing what to do with this,” the elf said holding up the parchment in one hand and the cloak in her other.
“Who are you to ask such things?” he demanded.
“Come on, we have to get this stuff packed up and get back to Elphyne. I have to say, I am looking forward to going home,” Neville said.
“How do you know that?” Harry asked Draco intrigued.
“Mummy,” Harry said, pulling on Lily’s sleeve, “let’s go home.”
” Harry said, not realising he was glowing slightly as he pushed with his magic. “Ha!,” Harry exclaimed as Ash gave a pitiful but triumphant squawk and burst into flames. “Dumbledore called him Fawkes, he likes the name but hates the man,” Harry added, as Godric nursed the bird and shivered as he felt the bond latch itself back on to him.
“Well, no, but I thought you might be different. You always seemed to know that you wouldn’t find a match before each of the other gatherings,” Neville said.
“Yes, that would be for the best, for now,” Lily said. “Take her to see the Ivy; Sirius join us as soon as you get her settled, I need you by my side,” Lily added.
The owls head popped up and she hooted in delight and flew over to land on Caspian’s shoulder, running her beak through his long hair after she settled.
“What is happening to my son?” Narcissa Malfoy asked as she walked in, accompanied by a few guards, Lucius at her side.
“As many as I choose,” Lily said, “do you have a problem with that?” She asked walking towards the guard, hands glowing in her anger.
“Thanks, mum,” Harry said, hugging her tightly back. He could feel her anxiety radiating from her body. “I will be at the castle tonight, and Cas won't let anything happen to me, you know that.”
“Yes, your mother had him moved to a more central point. It would not look good if you found your mate at first touch,” Capsian said, and Harry could hear the sympathy in his tone. He knew how much Harry hated this part. “If it makes you feel any better, I made sure Luna was further down,” he added, pleased with the small laugh he drew from his future King. “Unfortunately she seems to have moved herself next to Draco.”
“What are you doing?” Lily demanded as she appeared with Sirius by her side. “Where is Augusta?”
“I need you to bring me the Ward book when we get to the family room, I have to make sure no one but those approved has access to the Manor and then I will need to do the retrieval spell, so I will need a few elves available to put the items where they need to be when they pop in. If you find anything missing I need it to be retrieved.”
“Of course Alice, Harry wouldn’t never let any harm befall Neville, no matter how angry he was,” Meri said, amused by her alarm. “Though by the time Nyad is finished with him, who can say how well he will be able to function.”
“So I am full-blooded Fae now, as any human/wizarding blood is shed when we go through our second awakening. Harry, Harry is still a halfblood and will stay that way, until his final wizard awakening or magical inheritance as you call it, then he will start the purge, it will be complete by his 21st birthday.” Lily sighed heavily, “I was not strong enough yet to save them both. My second awakening happened on my birthday, but there was not enough time…”
“What?” Neville asked briefly looking at Harry before his attention was once again taken by the blonde girl at the Ravenclaw table.
“I’m looking forward to the looks on people’s faces when they see us in the Alley,” Neville said with a smile. “Bidh an cruinneachadh inntinneach dhut. Cha do bhruidhinn thu barrachd air beagan fhaclan ri Draco bho fhuair thu a-mach gur e do charaid a bh ’ann,” Neville added switching to Fae, to avoid the other boy hearing.
It got to the point that they had to bring in teachers from Elphyne to pick up some of the subjects. There were quite a few that were up to date with the wizarding subjects, thanks to Harry and Neville. But Remus was the one with the most Wizarding experience, though he wouldn’t be coming through until tomorrow.
“I must admit when I saw the state of it at first, no, but now that mum is working with the teachers, I am. Some of my instructors from Elphyne are coming to take over some classes and add more.”
“And secondly, my son, Harry Potter, as you know, has joined the school. He will be guarded at all times, so any attempts to harm him will be met with excessive force up to and including death. You have been warned. Let the feast begin.”
“Khidell, Nix, Caspian, Meri, Magus, Iris, Novus, Saira, Mia, Jade, Axis…”
“Do you think you will get some of your history from Harry’s tests?” Sirius asked.
“That never happens, do you know what caused it?” Lily asked.
“Neville Franklin Longbottom,” Alice said sternly as she caught her son in the act.
“She will probably get her own way eventually,” Harry said, “and I for one would put odds on her surviving it and kicking Frank’s arse when she does.”
“We plan to rule it,” Khidell said as he entered the room. “It will be like it was before. Fae will set the rules, you pitiful wastes of magic will follow them.”
“How did the rest of the gathering go?” Harry asked as he sat down on the sofa, next to Draco, in the family room, and smiled when Caspian sat on his other side.
“Yeah,” Harry said, leaning into her, both for his comfort and hers. “He is awesome. He told me how proud of me he was and how much he loved me. He also said how sorry he was he couldn’t be with me and you and to tell you he loves you now and always, and wants nothing more than your happiness.”
“Yeah, he is with Grandma and Grandpa Potter. He said to tell Sirius that he is with Marlene McKinnon and they are taking good care of each other. Apparently, the Order of the Phoenix members that are with dad have formed a new group, the Order of Dumbledore can suck it.”
“Understood!” chorused the guard, bending to one knee and lowering their heads.
“Harry,” Neville whined, “you know that means nothing to us. Why should we care what happens to the Wizarding world, I would much rather stay here.”
“The Founder’s and I, along with the remaining Professors spend a lot of time reviewing the changes and restoring the original charter. And from now on, we will be restoring Hogwarts to its former glory.
“Mum?” Harry asked concerned at the look on his mother’s face.
Harry held onto his mother and watched as Neville did the same, with his. They were shadowed out of the Great Hall and straight onto Platform 9 and ¾ much to the shock of the witches and wizards already gathered there.
“On a lighter note, we are going to Diagon Alley soon, and then we will be going home for the gathering.”
“Okay, I am going to do the retrieval spell so I will need three of you to help out with that so we don’t get buried under belongings. It will retrieve anything taken from any Potter, whether it be from a property or person or vault.
“How did this happen?” Khidell asked as he saw the same thing.
Caspian sputtered, but before he could speak, Neville spoke up behind Draco, “way to drop a bomb on the unexpected,” he said with a chuckle. “No wonder you were Harry’s fated.”
“It’s not possible,” Dumbledore muttered as he looked at her and then at the people surrounding her. Lily brushed her hair behind her ears and laughed at the shocked sound that came from the old man and those around him.
By the time Dudley turned five, the Dursley had been so used to there being two of them, they barely gave it any thought anymore. Mostly because the thought of treating their freak of a nephew as well as they treated Dudley was nauseating to them both.
But Khidell was right, it was time for Harry to stand on his own feet, and she had to stop babying him. He was destined to be King and she could not let her fear stand in his way. By the look of relief on her son’s face, she could tell she had done the right thing, even if her heart gave a thud at the thought of it.
Petunia had just placed a plate in front of her Duddikins spot, sneered at her nephew, who was standing next to her son and turned to dish up Vernon’s plate. When she turned back around she dropped the plate and screamed, causing her husband to come running into the room.
“As you wish, your Highness,” Nyad said and vanished.
Meri grunted in acknowledgement of his orders, but a frown was prominent on his face. He would have liked to kill quite a few of these so-called magicals, just for the way they were eyeing his future King.
Harry turned to Mivian and Aodh, “you have seer blood in your line?” Harry asked.
she whispered and smiled as Harry drifted off to sleep as she said the spell. She encased him in a bubble of silence and sat back, to examine Ragnock.
“Surprise me, I will have the elves pack his things and take them to him after the wards are set to bar him for entering the castle or grounds.”
Gäblin
“Yes,” Harry answered, screwing his nose up. He hated the pomp and circumstance of the whole thing. The scented bath, the robes, the ritual, and then the touching. He was hopeful he would only have to touch one person this time if he could manage to find and touch Draco first. He didn’t want to think about it happening any other way, but he knew the protocol by now and knew he would have to touch a lot of people.
“Harry, Neville come sit,” Lily said as she moved to guide them to a seat. “You remember Mivian and Aodh?”
“Finish up here and meet me at home,” Lily said and smoked out. She needed to hold her son.
“Vernon, of course we can't, what if we put our Duddy in there by mistake,” she said scandalised, her hand coming to her mouth to cover it at the thought.
“I didn’t think of it like that, I guess it would,” Neville said, getting up and placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder in support. “Maybe when we get back you can take me to see Potter Manor and the Godric Hollow place,” Neville added, smiling at his brother from another mother.
“Where have you two reprobates been? And where is Remus, he usually keeps the two of you in line?” Lily asked, ignoring the questions for now.
“You sure did,” Draco said, in between bouts of laughter.
“Seriously?” Neville asked.
“No need to pout,” Neville said, chuckling at his brother's face.
“Thank you, Minerva,” Lily said, “Meri will lead you out, this is Fae business,” Lily added, dismissing the older woman.
Neville gulped loudly, cursing himself for his slip. He and Harry had teased each other all their lives, so it was sometimes hard to remember that Harry would be his King. He had to admit this was the first time Harry had ever reacted that badly. He usually gave better than he got, so Neville was horrified at his actions and the pain he had caused Harry.
“No Mistress,” Jinxy said.
“I have no idea why you let that filth stay in our castle,” Godric said from Lily’s left side, Helga nodded her agreement from Lily’s right.
There was a third option but he refused to think about it.
“I was so busy fighting the part of Voldemort that latched onto Harry, that I could do nothing to protect him, until he was 4, by that time, I managed to purge Voldemort from him and then I could help him, but only a little. It took me a year to get both of us strong enough to push from the other side to join my essence and reclaim my body.” She smiled at their shocked expressions.
“Where is the firebird?” Khidell asked frowning at the old man that still had not moved from his spot.
“Petunia,” Lily said as she entered the room, a smirk on her face, “you may want to call an ambulance, I may have killed your husband.” She knew he wasn’t dead, but enjoyed the look of horror on her bitch of a sister's face.
return all potter property back to me
“Dumbledore,” Charlus spat out, “he blackmailed us, threatened to kill Harry if we didn’t do as he said. He stole our portraits and spelled them asleep after he got what he wanted. How long have we been asleep?”
“What!!” Neville exclaimed, annoyed at Harry for taking his attention away from blonde beauty across the room.
After the feast, Caspian and Nyx led Harry and Neville to the family rooms, much to the boys' confusion.
“Well,” Neville said, swallowing thickly. He knew it could have been him as well if not for his Aunt Lily. He could imagine how bad that would have been. “Maybe we will both find out Fated at Hogwarts,” Neville added changing the subject.
“The other halflings?”
“You can my darling and we will work on it when we are safe.”
“Only you would get a bossy owl,” Caspian said from his seat across the room, smirking at Harry, causing the boy to blush.
“Mummy will be as quick as she can. Can you be a brave boy for mummy? I promise you, Harry, I will come back,” Lily said pulling him into a hug.
“Well,” Harry said as he moved to her other side and kissed her cheek, “someone had to break the stalemate between you and Uncle Frank.”
“There you are,” she said as she found Snuffles under the cot, covered in dust and quite smelly but still in rather good condition. She spelled it clean, summoned a bag to her, and tucked the soft toy inside. Lily searched through the nursery and grabbed anything she thought Harry would like before leaving the room and heading for her and James’s room.
“Narcissa?” Lily asked as she stood next to the other mother, and placed a privacy bubble around them. “What of your husband?” she asked knowing Narcissa would understand.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked as the hat.
“Sure, it will be nice to get to know some of the kids before school starts,” Harry said with a shrug.
“What?” Sirius stuttered until he realised Lily and Harry seemed to be in some sort of trance. He moved to reach them but was blocked by one of the guards.
Harry’s heart jumped in his chest in his excitement as he approached the portal. He could not wait to see his father’s world.
“We were waiting until later for that, my King,” Caspian answered as Khidell was busy trying to suppress Siofra’s anger. Siofra was still young by Fae standards, she had yet to go through her final awakening. Spikes like she was having now, could damage her magic if she were not treated as soon as possible.
“Daisy,” she called, and the little elf popped in right away, fifty elves right behind her, to Lily’s astonishment, “Dumbledore really did take all of you didn’t he,” she exclaimed. She had no idea the old man knew how many elves and properties the Potters had, and she was curious as to how he found out.
“She actually called him a bitter ex,” Luna said with a giggle.
“In a hurry, much?” Harry asked, laughing at Neville’s disgruntled look.
Annoyed she snapped the wand and set it on fire burning the pieces, enjoying the look of horror on the old man’s face. She would never get tired of putting that look there until the time came to kill him.
Lily’s hand went to her mouth as she tried to control her emotions, but the tears slipped down her face as she could do nothing to stop them. Harry pulled her closer to comfort her and she smiled at him gratefully.
Ragnock was starting to sweat, he had no idea what was going on. All he knew was that Slipknot was dead and Bloodrod had taken his place.
“I assure you, with magic all things are possible,” Lily said and frowned at her sister, “sit Petunia, I want to have a word with you.”
“Khidell,” one of the other guards said as they stood.
“Yes my Prince,” Magus answered causing Harry to frown.
The gates swung open, and Harry cheered as they walked through them, watching intently as they shut behind them with a loud clanging sound. Lily looked around as she paused inside the gates, the lawn was overgrown, so she could only imagine how bad the inside would look.
“Yes, I can see that. It looks like there have been other wards added to the Castle itself, without being anchored here. That is not good, the wards are like a house of cards right now. It is not safe for anyone here.”
“No need to be nervous, little prince,” Cas said with a smile.
“Draco’s parents will be at the gathering,” Lily said as they entered Elphyne, and she led them towards their home.
They could all hear the anger in the woman’s voice, and as much as it amused Lily to see one of her favourite teachers go after the old man, her eyes trained straight onto Severus Snape.
“And why would we need you?” Sirius asked, speaking up for the first time.
He did not miss the smirk aimed in his direction from Caspian as he took his place beside his King, and blushed quite prettily as far as Cas was concerned.
“Give them both to me,” Lily said and gently took the items from the elf, trying to contain her rage.
“Ivy seems to think it would do her good. Maybe after seeing so many halflings there are in Hogwarts will do her some good.
“Did she say why?” Lily asked as she moved forward in her seat.
“I see,” he said as his eyes cleared, “it will be dealt with before we return. Caspian, Magus come,” Khidell said, and shared his memory of the traitors with them. “You know what you must do, go to my brother for help.”
“Let’s go, guards first. Caspian, Nyx, stay close to Harry and Neville,” Lily commanded, as the first of the guards entered the portal set for Hogwarts gates.
Sirius paused in his writing, and looked up at Lily, “didn’t the Fae help build Hogwarts?” he asked, remembering something he had read in the Black library.
She picked up Harry, and placed him at the bottom of the stairs before running up them and removing the memories from Dudley and Vernon too, after checking to make sure Dudley would not inherit their legacy. She was relieved to find him nothing but an ordinary human. She then erased any signs of her son, before picking him up and leaving Privet Drive forever.
“Yes, I see that,” Lily said smiling.
“Luna,” Celeste said, hugging her tightly. “This is the reason why I had to leave and why I could not return until King Harry returned to the wizarding world to find his mate. She would have been slaughtered by our kind, before Lily, and even after. You know there are still some Seelie and Unseelie alike that would love to keep the two separated.
“Of course, though it will be difficult for him. His father is a Death Eater and has been trying to persuade the boy to join, but he absolutely refuses.”
“Lazy,” Lily said to Sirius, who just grinned at her.
“Are you okay, Mum?” Harry asked as he hugged his mother.
“Why were your portraits missing?” Lily asked. “And why were the elves at Hogwarts.”
“No that was more of a gut feeling,” Harry said but quieted down when his mother stood.
“I am Lily Potter, Neville Longbottom’s godmother,” Lily answered waving her hand sending the old man into the wall and rushing to comfort a crying Neville. “Shh, baby it’s okay Aunty Lily is here.”
“He’s a freak, just like you,” Petunia screamed, jumping to her feet.
“What is not well known,” Lily continued, “is that Helga and Godric are both Fae, and retired to Elphyne after the death of Rowena, and left their legacy, Hogwarts, to be run under the rules they had set and left behind.
Harry Potter, aged four, sat shivering in his cupboard under the stairs. His Uncle had thrown him in there after Dudley had poured his cup of milk all over Harry and somehow blamed him. He was wet and sticky and the milk had started to turn sour and smell.
“Can you speak Fae?” Sirius asked curiously.
“Who are you?” Algie demanded angrily.
He could feel his mother smiling, and the echo of an embrace in his mind. He loved those feelings but also wished he could feel her real arms wrapped around him.
“Then let us go and see if just the sight of me can make an old man have a heart attack,” Lily said and moved, walking from the meeting room to the side chamber that held the portal that would take them from Elphyne to the human world.
“Maybe this isn’t such a good idea,” Harry said as the crowd continued to try and get a peek at him and his mother while spouting off all sorts of nonsense.
“What do you know of Snape and Dumbledore’s relationship?” she asked as she walked back into the house.
“It will be funny to see his face when he sees you all without your glamors,” Siofra said, “and even funnier when you wipe his taint from the earth.”
“Come, let us take the wards and make an old man miserable.”
“Okay,” Harry said with a smile.
“I remember touching Harry and being surprised,” Draco turned and looked right at Harry, a small smile on his lips. “He’s mine,” Draco breathed out in awe.
“If it were that easy to change wizards and witches into Fae, we would have cleansed their taint from the world long ago,” Siofra said as she entered the room, “and killed the unworthy,” she added with a smirk. “And age has a little to do with it my King, the chances of surviving the change decrease with age.”
“Yes, of course, he is my official Heir now, since you fobbed off the responsibility to him,” Helga said with a small laugh at the look Harry gave her. “Yes, I know, my King,” she added, “you have a lot of responsibilities.”
“They were so panicked and stressed they were sent to let off some tension. I think they are in the dungeons again. They even dragged Remus with them.”
“Explain,” Khidell snapped.
“Gran is going to be so pleased with this hall,” Neville said as he toed the bags full of Honeydukes products.
Lily and Alice had finally taken Harry and Neville shopping in Diagon Alley for supplies, Sunday afternoon. Sirius and Frank tagged along, making sure the boys had everything they needed, besides school books.
“This child is a halfling,” Khidell said standing next to Sirius who held Neville.
“Khidell,” Lily answered.
“Will it hurt?” he asked.
“That could be any Slytherin,” Harry said thoughtfully. He had done his research on who were related to Death Eaters and who were ones.
“You are the mother to the future King. You deserve the respect and the title, your Highness. And since you are Seelie, Harry is both Seelie and Unseelie, making him the King of the Fae.” Rugnuk said. “As for bowing, the Goblins used to serve the Fae, until the King was lost and the Fae became Seelie and Unseelie.
“It seems that Harry, Neville, Draco and Luna are now full-blooded,” Ivy said, frowning down at her patients. “There is not a bit of wizard or human blood in them.”
“You are all tainted beyond the pale,” Siofra answered, scowling at him. “The magic in your veins is weak, diluted, pitiful…”
“Are you alright, sweetheart?” Lily asked, and Harry jumped up in surprise, pulling away from her to get a better look.
“How many awakenings will I have?” Harry asked, always curious about his magic.
“What have you done,” Godric bellowed as he moved to stand in front of Dumbeldore, shocking Harry out of his thoughts.
“Seriously Mr Longbottom,” the hat answered.
“Well,” Alice said blushing slightly, before recovering. “Still Gussy would have a hard time with the ritual and Frank would never risk her that way.”
“I see,” Lily said, “
LeFae - Hufflepuff - Mother
“They will have no choice,” Lily said with a small smile. “Get your things, meet us at Gringotts, I will bring Alice and Frank.”
She had just sat down and pulled Harry up next to her when Daisy popped back in with the Ward book, “Lady Lily needs to be fixing the Portraits too, they be frozen.”
“Harry, sweetheart,” Lily said, running her hand through his hair, “can you wake up for mummy please?”
“Oh, I think I would, and I think it would be fitting if Caspian was the one that reprimanded him for his poor teaching skills.”
“What do you plan on doing to the Wizarding World?” Narcissa asked.
“What is this about, witch?” he asked gruffly. “And know that if you waste my time I will have both your heads.”
“Understood, Highness,” Khidell said, enjoying her bloodthirstiness.
“I should kill you where you sit,” Lily stated, as she took a seat at the table.
“Mistress Lily, we be told you be dead,” the elf said surprised.
The rest of the guards were checking every inch of the school, making it safe for Harry and Neville. It had been a trial talking his mother into letting them stay in the Gryffindor Suites, rather than with the rest of them in the family part of the castle.
“There have been rumours for years that my mum survived that night. Dumbledore has been denying it, but what does that old man know? Mum has been working behind the scenes to thwart his every move. I can’t believe he tried to claim Hogwarts.”
“Some things should never leave your mouth, Neville,” Harry said, frowning at him.
“Besides she is perfectly fine, and now, better than ever.”
“Her parents?” Khidell asked.
“Of course,” Lily said handing Harry over to his guard, “but you must know,” she added before releasing him, “if he is harmed in any way, it will mean not only your death but the death of your whole line.”
“Yes, Jinxy do,” the little elf said and then a few pops were heard through the house and things started to disappear. “We place things in Potter Vaults for Lady Lily to sort through later,” she added and started in the bedroom Lily was standing in.
“We need to leave now,” Khidell said as he entered the room, glaring slightly at a blushing Siofra. “Neville is already waiting with your mother, and his parents.”
“Yes?” Lily asked as Capsian made it to her side.
“So she was never in any danger?” Frank asked.
“And when did you get so smart?” Lily asked tickling his tummy.
“Your Highness?” Khidell asked, looking at the humans with her trying hard to hide his distaste.
She walked down the street, Harry on her hip and a bounce in her step, smiling at her giggling son.
“No, Grandmother, it is Neville,” Luna said smiling as she pointed the boy out.
“Franklin Longbottom,” Augusta whispered harshly, “we do not talk that way.”
“Can you sense anything?” the old man asked Severus.
Lily sighed and lay her head onto the back of the lounge, closing her eyes tightly. “Oh James,” she whispered as a lone tear escaped her. She had been holding it together for so long, just trying to get things in place, but now, in Potter Manor, surrounded by memories, she allowed herself a moment to grieve for her love.
“What? Oh, right, sorry,” Hermione said blushing herself.
“Now you are a dead man walking,” Khidell said, amused by the laughter of his Queen as he led the man from the room.
“Bye mummy,” Harry said and started talking away to Minky as she led him from the room.
“I will not let anything interfere with the gathering, Nyad. We leave for Elphyne tomorrow, but maybe in the morning a full guard and I shall take Harry shopping in Diagon Alley, make sure the information is leaked to the press. I shall have Meri inform Luna so her father may write it up for his paper.”
“Jinxy,” she called.
“With Harry, so I can keep an eye on him,” Neville said.
“It might be a good idea if I have access to all the halflings last names, both from their mothers and fathers to see if we have any more lost children,” Khidell said, frowning. How did this happen, he thought to himself. “It could be another explanation for the large number of halflings.”
“Firstly, I would like you all to welcome back Godric Gryffindor and Helga Hufflepuff, two of the Founders of Hogwarts.” Stunned silence followed that announcement, as Godric and Helga stood and bowed to the students.
“Of course,” Lily said smiling back and Khidell while signalling Saira over to her.
“What’s an errand?” Harry asked.
“It’s okay Harry, everything is fine, we just had some very interesting news. But it’s nothing to worry about for now, okay?”
“We do not know,” Mivian said. “She told us she needed to enter the magical world, there was something she needed to do. She never told us what exactly, and we never saw her again.”
Draco greeted them as they sat at the table and Harry smiled at the boy before paying attention to his mum.
“So is Harry,” Lily said, “and he helped me return, now we need to find a property that we can use. Which Potter properties are available?”
“Remember,” Lily said as they stopped, pulling him into a hug, “Cas and Nym will be with you at all times. You will be pleased to know Khidell talked me into lowering your guard to them two and just Meri and Magus,” she added looking completely put out by the fact.
Harry moved forward and raised his hand, petting the bird, sorrow etched on his face, “he has chained the phoenix in dark magics. What is the bird's name, Godric?”
“Yes?”
“Has to be Dumbledore’s doing, though he seems to have left out the whole Fae thing. Of course, the old man does love his secrets,” Sirius said frowning. “Do you think he realises we are all Fae now, or just you, Lily?”
“Your son is my son’s fated,” Lily said, smiling at Narcissa. “Their bonding was a little unusual, and had an unexpected side effect,” Lily added gently. She could see the worry in Narcissa's face.
Dumbledore seemed to snap back to reality at that point and frowned, “Lily Potter is dead.”
No words were spoken as each person passed by Harry, touching his hand on the way through. Only the females touched Neville, though.
“I would really like to know how you turned 21?” Lily asked.
Harry and Neville stood when Lily and Alice made their way down towards them, “ready son?” Lily asked, smiling at her boy and taking his hand.
Harry and Neville were led to a compartment by Cas and Nym. Meri and Magus having already picked it out. As soon as he entered he felt the wards and frowned.
“Well, we have a lot to discuss,” Lily said to the remaining staff. “Let’s get started.
“I will have you know I am a Pureblood,” Sirius said, indignant at the look he was receiving.
“We will get to that later, what I want to know is where were you when Harry needed you? You left him with Hagrid and he was subjected to over three years at the Dursleys.”
“Caspian, stop teasing my son before he explodes,” Lily said as she moved to Harry and wrapped an arm around his waist.
“Fae,” Augusta said her hand coming up to her mouth in shock.
Sirius and Frank had been keeping him on his toes in the Wizengamot, blocking his every power move. But keeping Harry from him had been the most fun for them, the old man was completely focused on getting Harry Potter under his guidance.
Harry was still sleeping when Lily walked out of Gringotts, her ring firmly back on her finger, the Heir ring on little Harry’s. Three goblins were dead, including Ragnock and Dumbledore was forbidden entry into Gringotts by the time she was done.
He was still surprised by the fact that he was never looked down on as a halfling like Neville sometimes was, but he supposed being the future King had a lot to do with it. Unseelie and Seelie alike were waiting to see him off, causing him to blush slightly.
She quickly moved the bed aside and searched her hidden stash, relieved beyond belief when her wards were still in place. She disabled them and moved the floorboard, reaching in and pulling out the books her mother left her and the necklace and ring that was with them.
“Nervous?” Lily asked when they entered the room.
“He does have a way of rubbing off on one, does he not,” Helga replied with a matching smirk.
“I see,” Sirius said, relieved. Harry had an army of Unseelie to keep him safe. “But why is there a Royal Guard when there are no Royals or were no Royals?” Sirius asked.
“This man is Mr Lovegood, Luna’s father,” Lily said, gesturing to said man.
“Of course, Highness,” Nyx replied before smoking out.
“Mother had books that were passed on to me. I have kept them hidden and can only pray they were not discovered after my ‘death’.”
“Now I know where you get it from, Nev,” Harry said, with a little laugh, causing Frank to glare at him.
“Minky,” Lily called, and the little nanny elf popped in, causing Harry to shriek in surprise and delight.
He could see it spread across Harry’s face when the words had registered in Harry’s mind. Stupid, he thought to himself. Caspian had always been a sore topic for Harry. He had been drawn to the man for as long as Neville could remember, and had hoped Cas would be his mate.
By the morning the Wizarding World would be in the midst of it’s biggest scandal ever.
“Do you have a way to contact her?” Mivian asked.
“The Fae will allow that?” Augusta asked.
“I’m sure a few of the others will be too. Gran has been using that chocolate to bribe many Fae,” Harry said laughing.
“Pardon,” Gussy said getting to her feet and looking down at Lily, she could not believe the nerve of the woman before her.
“I know and I plan to keep it that way. The records have been cleared and his identity will be kept quiet,” Lily answered, looking at Khidell with a frown of her own.
“What else do you have them doing?” Alice asked.
He really couldn’t wait for that.
“Okay,” Harry said as he stood and shouldered his bag, along with Neville, after they packed up their bounty, and made their way to the family room where the portal had been set up.
But after meeting Draco and spending time with him, neither could see Draco sharing his mate. So Harry had lost hope that he could ever be with Cas, and Neville throwing it in his face like that...but at least Harry would have Draco. Caspian had never found his Fated and was resigned to the fact he would be one of the many that didn’t have one.
“Yes they are, but if you turn around, I have a surprise for you.”
“Oh, they should be fine. Full-blooded Fae give off a special kind of magic, and Harry and Neville have been saturated in it since they were five years old. Besides, Harry is the future King, it is within all Fae the need to touch him, to be close to him.”
“And we couldn’t do that why?” Neville asked.
“How?” Harry asked intrigued. He had figured out almost immediately that the voice was his mother. She could not talk to him all the time, she had said it would be a while before she could be with him always. She had to regain her strength. Harry didn’t really understand what it all meant, he was just happy she was with him.
Draco looked at Luna with amusement before continuing. “She also explained that not all halflings will become full-blooded Fae, some will just remain magicals.”
“I’m fine sweetheart, let’s go annoy an old man shall we.”
“It is unacceptable that these children were left alone here. Going through the first of their awakenings at five all alone would have been horrible for them without a Fae to guide their pain. I should know, from my own and Harry’s experiences.”
“It’s nice to meet you,” Harry said nodding his head at the man.
Remus wasn’t so bad either, but since he had retained his werewolf traits even though he didn’t turn anymore, it made him harder to fight. Though, his lessons in Wizarding subjects were awesome, he was an excellent teacher, and one of Harry’s favourites. But Neville himself still preferred his time with Helga in the gardens.
“Really?” Harry asked absolutely gleeful at the thought of not having to stay where he was.
“What else happened?” Khidell asked.
“Harry,” Lily said once he calmed, “do you remember Grandma and Grandpa?”
“Where are you staying?” Lily asked.
“He’s happy?” She asked.
“Have you met them yet?” Harry asked.
“Watch your tongue,” Harry snapped, his eyes shining in his anger, “brother or not, some lines you do not cross,” he finished before storming off, Caspain following him, all amusement was gone from his face.
“As I told her and I will tell you, you do not name a pet after the Goddess,” Harry said disgruntled, “it’s tacky.”
“Not everyone can be Lily Potter,” Alice said with a small laugh.
“Lily. It can’t be,” Petunia said as she lifted her hand to her heart, her face paling dramatically.
“But he is not your guard,” Harry said, having heard his brother's mutterings, “he is mine.”
“Something to get used to,” Neville teased as he moved over to Harry, smiling at his brother’s predicament.
“Neville is my godson, and not only was he born of the secondary Hufflepuff line through his mother, he is also Fae and family. I promised Alice if anything happened I would protect Neville with my life. And so I will.”
All the money and heirlooms that had been taken from their estate were returned and the Minister for Magic, Millicent Bagnold was in trouble she would not see coming until the ICW swept in tomorrow and started their investigation. She had allowed Death Eaters to go free and innocents to be thrown in Azkaban. She had also stuck her hands in the Potter’s wealth with a few of her lackeys.
“With all due respect, your Highness, I think it would be best to leave it between the two of them.”
“Voldemort is being dealt with as we speak. His reign of terror, such as it has been, is coming to a swift end,” Lily answered. “He was always under my surveillance. I have protected as many innocents as possible while letting him wreak havoc on your reputation. But I will be having the pleasure of taking over that task.”
“I hope so for Draco’s sake,” Alice said. “Thank you for talking to Nyad,” she added smiling at her best friend.
“Your Highness?” Narcissa questioned.
“Yes, mummy,” Harry murmured and did as he was told.
“Is that Harry Potter?” Harry heard from several people in the crowd and tried to hide behind Neville.
“Laimbeart?” Khidell said frowning, looking at Lily.
“Neville,” Harry called nudging the boy beside him. The rest of the train ride had been pretty ordinary. They had met a few more people, but most of the students kept to the outside of their compartment and just listened in.
“You felt it did you not?” Luna asked Caspian. “There was only one wizard that you paid attention to, that you actually flirted with, was there not?” Luna looked at the man, amusement shining in her eyes.
“We have Fae blood in our family, most Pruebloods do, though it is not common knowledge.”
Harry blinked rapidly, trying to look around as his eyes adjusted to the afternoon light, “Gringotts?” he asked.
“No, I have no idea at all,” Harry said, sarcasm dripping from his voice, causing Neville to look at him and snort.
his mother whispered in his mind,
“We missed you too.”
“I’ve come to take him with me, and raise him with Harry,” Lily said. “I plan on taking Alice and Frank too.”
“All finished there baby, we are home now, at Potter Castle, and I need your help to get inside, can you help me?” Harry nodded his head while wiping the sleep from his eyes, causing Lily to smile fondly at him, it was an action James used to do.
“Then let’s inform them of what has happened, shall we,” Lily said, smiling as she took her son’s hand and led him from the room.
“Is there? I am sure there is nothing in the Department of Mysteries,” Lily said amused at the look she was getting from the old man.
Harry sat next to his mother, the hood of his robe drawn up to hide his face. Neville sat on his other side, his hood also raised. He could feel Neville’s eagerness, while all Harry could feel was anxious.
Before he could add anything else, and before anyone even though to move Luna Lovegood reached over and grabbed Harry’s hand with a smile.
“How!” the old woman exclaimed, clutching at her chest.
“Well maybe I can finally get a date at Hogwarts,” Neville said reluctantly.
“Hey mum, where’s dad and Sirius? I thought they would be here.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, “the fates wouldn’t be so cruel.” Harry reached for Neville’s hand and squeezed it when the other boy grabbed on. “Besides, I’m pretty sure my mate is going to be male,” Harry added, trying to reassure his godbrother.
“I do not know, your Highness, there is nothing about this in the books. But the last time this was recorded, the Fae involved were full-blooded already. Born and bred of Elphyne,” Khidell answered, before adding, “a halfling has never become full-blooded before their second awakening at 21. It was forbidden to try and change halflings early as it affected their magic and in some cases caused their deaths.”
“Stop calling me that,” Harry huffed and turned to look out the window.
“You did?” Harry asked.
“....”
Harry frowned but moved over to where Neville was under the hat and startled slightly as the stool enlarged. He took the hint and sat, and wasn’t at all surprised when the hat grew and covered both their heads.
“Well?” Ragnock sneered.
“Shut up, and yes, I know that, and you can’t talk with your epic crush on you know who,” Neville huffed, before taking a deep breath. “At least you managed to get Siofra to stop being so rigid.”
She was watching closely, as books, jewellery and even furniture started to pop in and then disappear with an elf. A couple of paintings popped in and Lily stood, completely shocked, until rage took over, “how dare they,” Lily spat out, as she watched her in-law’s portraits pop into view and then disappear again. She was just about to leave the room when she noticed James’ invisibility cloak and a piece of parchment pop into place.
“Yes, but this one is special,” Lily said, picking up her son’s hand and slipping it on his finger.
“Prince Harry should stay here,” Khidell stated.
“That’s handy,” Sirius said as they looked around.
“Jinxy,” she called and the little elf popped into place.
“We were not sure how she would help the King, only that she would be close to him, but it would all become clear when she was in the same room as him. I saw this, but not the outcome,” she said turning to Luna, “is he?”
“Can you hurry?” Harry asked quietly.
“The answer is this,” a woman said, entering the room with Meri holding on to her arm. She held out her other, showing a bracelet that glowed with power. “It conceals me, what I am,” she added smiling at her parents. “Hello Mother, Father,” said, as she removed the bracelet. “This is no longer needed, now that the King has brought us back together.”
“Shouldn’t the wards let the Headmaster know we are here?” Harry asked, confused.
“This is where I would usually call you an arsehole, but well…”
“I am,” Siofra said with a frown.
“Mummy?” Harry asked looking between his mother and Rugnuk.
“I still want Harry as my Heir, is that still possible?”
“Banished to the human world, she was to have no memory of her beginnings, but when I was conceived, she remembered. She wrote that she believed her mother wove a spell to release those memories if she ever conceived a magical child. I found out later that my father was a squib, I think that is what helped activate the Fae blood.
“Non-magical born?” Neville asked at the crestfallen look on the girls face.
“Did you know Morgan Le Fay was Fae?” Draco asked, still shocked over that information. “It’s why there are so many halflings in the magical world right now.”
“Okay, take Harry to play and make sure he has a snack, please, Minky.”
“Fawkes the phoenix, Godric Gryffindor’s own familiar, choose to stay behind and guide the future Headmasters in the running of the school. But over the years, things were changed that were not supposed to be. Headmasters put their own spin on the rules and classes, the Ministry got involved where they were not supposed to and Hogwarts fell short of its origins.
“Well, one minute Draco was touching me and the next thing, all four of us were standing on a higher plain and Danu was waiting for us. I thought we had died to be honest,” Harry said.
“Morgan was worried that we would destroy her magical legacy of witches and wizards she made in her image. Though she is unhappy about Myrddin getting all the credit and corrupting her creations, she was hoping that by reintroducing them to the Fae they would remember where they come from.”
“What the fuck, Neville,” Harry muttered as he turned his face away from the hand hitting him.
“I am going to trade him in,” Siofra said, frowning viciously at the ground.
She frowned before releasing the door with her blood. “It seems like no one has been here since our time, Godric,” Helga said in disgust, as she passed the map to Harry, who deactivated it.
“Many are already dead, and when we have finished here, and head back into the magical world the rest will follow.”
“What do you think you are doing?” Lucius demanded as he was manhandled out of the room. “I am the King’s mate's father.”
“Then she said that it was time for Harry to step up and take what was rightfully his, then we wake up 4 years older with a lot of knowledge dumped into our heads,” Neville finished up.
“Harry Potter,” the hat called, “come.”
“But, I’m the Heir of Gryffindor,” Harry finally managed to say, as Professor McGonagall pulled the hat off of both the boy’s heads.
