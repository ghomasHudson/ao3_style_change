"And you want to give me this…
“Bloody hell, do you have to be so violent?” Harry rubbed at his sore earlobe.
"I wasn't going to." Harry said honestly.
"Don't bother, Potter." Draco cut him off with a raised hand. "Don't worry about me. I can handle him."
you can converse maturely, then I'll ask you my questions. Until then ,
! Wizards and Witches killed! What is blood purity if magical blood is spilt nonetheless?"
"Good thing I have you, then." Dumbledore smiled, and chills ran across Draco's skin. "My old age hasn't touched my mind yet, dear boy. You may not agree, but your loyalties were placed the moment you and Harry aligned paths to the defeat of Voldemort."
"I was involved anyway! I was tortured until my bones ached, and so you'd better tell me the truth about where your loyalties lie because otherwise I'll hex you right here where you stand!"
"Professor Snape created a spell, sir?" Draco asked, confused. He'd never really thought about
Umbridge rearranged herself, setting down her quill and crossing her arms over her desk. “Yesterday...you mentioned something about the Ministry.” She was obviously trying to be as casual as possible but Harry wasn’t that stupid. It still didn’t stop him from stiffening slightly. “I was wondering what you might’ve meant by that. Just out of curiosity, of course.” Umbridge waved her hand nonchalantly, bracing her chin on one of them as if they were two friends out to tea or something.
"We really haven't been involved, Harry." Hermione said beside him.
"Severus, get mister Malfoy to the hospital wing. I'll deal with Harry and the imposter." Dumbledore commanded. Snape spurred in to action, magically binding and levitating Draco away without sparing a glance at Harry. Had Harry had the smallest bit more energy, he would have gotten up to see him off.
"I was angry." Ron admitted slowly, stirring the potion, "But luckily I had Hermione there, otherwise I might've killed Malfoy."
"Evergreen?" Draco asked, inspecting the potion. Sitting there with Snape reminded him of those few times when he was younger when he watched Snape make potions at the Manor.
Harry considered for a moment, wondering if he should involve Ron and Hermione before going to see his rival alone in the dark. Especially when said rival was unconvincingly promising not to hex Harry. He didn't quite trust Malfoy yet, even if they agreed to an armistice. Merlin knew if the boy would pull a First Year and just not show up again.
"What tone?"
“Yeah,” Harry said, glancing at Hermione, who was next to Ron and busy knitting something that vaguely resembled a kidney. He wanted to ask what it was meant to be, but she was still pissed at Ron for comparing it to something very rude earlier that day, so he didn’t want to risk her anger as well.
“Whatever,” he mumbled. Harry relaxed a bit as well.
no Voldemort. It was just your dad, and maybe a couple of other shady guys your dad hung out with. Now it's real, Draco. It's purposely putting yourself in harms way every moment you're around them." Draco noticed his hands beginning to wring in his lap. "You didn't…" Harry voice cracked and he turned his head away from Draco. "He killed him
" He heard Hermione hiss irritably behind them.
"See you tomorrow." She said without looking back. He quirked his head. Merlin, she wanted to see him for tea
Sirius shook his head. "She only visited sometimes. It was my family who lived here, mainly."
Ron sighed, “As I’ll ever be.”
Draco picked himself up off the floor, panting heavily and sweat rolling down his face.
Walking up the familiar path, he blinked out the light from his wand and let his eyes adjust to the darkness. Luckily for him, Draco was paler than fresh parchment and was easy to pick out. Harry snickered to himself at the thought.
"I'm sure you did." There was a teasing lilt to Blaise's tone that Draco didn't like at all. He turned his head to the side where Blaise was busy imparting on his personal space, scowling. "Does it have something to do with what happened at the end of Fourth Year, maybe?"
She peered up at Blaise boredly from the top of her pink-rimmed glasses, then as if it took the utmost effort, peeled her eyes to Draco. Whatever she must have seen, she didn’t seem impressed.
“That night, the ritual to revive Voldemort's body required the blood of the enemy, forcibly taken-”
"Harry?" Hermione asked immediately.
He needed to. Even if he had to disregard himself completely to do it.
"Looks like one." Draco murmured so only Harry could hear.
"For an ex-Auror, you're not." Draco said, trying to sound brave. Moody just laughed, a deranged, menacing sound feeling much too loud for the classroom they were in. Draco gripped his wand tightly behind his back still, feeling the tremors going through them but ignoring the feeling.
" Harry gasped at the assumption, and Draco reached over and smacked him on the back of the head.
"M' alright." Harry mumbled.
"Hermione!" Harry whined. "He wasn't…supposed…to know!" He gestured to Draco violently with his head.
"Dear Mr Potter, the Ministry has received intelligence that at two forty-three, this morning, you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, you are hereby expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk."
Bill smiled. "That's all I could ask for, really. If I could ask you for one thing, however, Draco." Bill leaned in and Draco did too. "Keep looking after Harry, alright? We're all a bit worried about him lately. Another pair of eyes could be all the better."
"I said I don't
-o-o-
Slowly, Draco realised a smile was steadily spreading across his face. He probably looked insane, eyes glazed over and stood still in the middle of a corridor wearing a wicked grin.
Seeing the rest of the Hall, Draco realised they were the only couple still on the floor. Face heating in embarrassment, he quickly made his way off, making sure not to look at Potter. He ignored the many stares from people around the room and made a show of getting a drink from one of the tables and sipping languorously like he did it all the time. More casual music started to the play, and the comfortable hum of chatter regained itself in the Hall. Draco sighed in relief, a tight feeling in his chest but a rush of adrenaline still lingering. His pulse was racing, he felt, as he pressed his fingers to his neck.
Harry shrugged at Cho apologetically as he was dragged away, and turned to hear Hermione chewing Ron out about something. He tuned them out, his mind running over the encounter meticulously. Did Cho like him? It seemed like it, but…
and stop being such a prick in general. You're not you father, so stop trying to act like it - frankly it's quite embarrassing." Harry smiled when Malfoy did, feeling good at getting all of this off his chest. Malfoy stared at his hand for a few seconds considering it carefully. Then he took Harry's hand and Harry pulled him up to stand.
"So, why are you telling us all this?" Harry leant forward. "What makes you feel the need to make us hide from Dumbledore?"
Irritation flared inside him for a moment, but he tamped it down and smoothed a tight smile on his face, hoping it would comfort the child or something of the sort.  “If you’re worthy, then Slytherin will pick you. Easy as.”
"You asked if we inbred our house elves!" Draco retorted.
After a while, there was a steady trickle coming from the wounds and his hand was throbbing enough to hinder his ability to hold the quill. He fumbled with it a few times, cursing when it fell out of his grip.
On top of all that, he had been informed by Snape upon arrival at Hogwarts that he would be meeting with none other than Umbridge herself personally tomorrow morning along with Pansy as they were Slytherin prefects, meaning he would probably miss breakfast. The most important meal of the day, for Merlin’s sake!
“I...It’s been one day, Harry,” Draco said weakly, “She can’t hate you…” he trailed unsurely off at Harry’s expression.
The plan relied on several things, First of all, he kept his promise and stopped going outside at all. He went from classes at the end of the day straight to the Common Room with Ron and Hermione. This meant he only saw Draco a few times a day, sometimes even just once in class expelling mealtimes. He didn't have very favourable odds of the plan working out because of that, but he ignored the fact dutifully. At least he had a plan, right?
"Thank you." Potter said quietly next to him, taking another piece. Draco decided to leave it for now, reveling in the irrational feeling of success of having gotten Potter to eat something. Draco finished his apple and vanished the core with his wand. Maybe he needed more sleep.
He snuck in through the portrait, the Fat Lady giving him a suspicious once over but surprisingly not commenting. He practically crawled in to his dorm, envying the hushed snores of everyone in the room. Collapsing in to bed, he pulled out his wand to set on the side table with his glasses, but stopped once he saw something else come with it.
"Alright, Harry?" Remus asked, a dozing Sirius next to him resting on his shoulder.
He sighed, and finally fell asleep.
“He’s gone mad!” Seamus yelled. Even Dean was looking at Harry guardedly.
to understand that I won't be like him. If you understand, then somehow I'll feel better about it. Like I'm not going against my father's teachings for no reason."
, I don't know what you're planning, or what you've confunded Harry with, but If find out I will hex your fingers off!" Harry, albeit also feeling rattled, sniggered at Malfoy's face. He stopped once the he caught the boys eye, and watched as Ron solemnly walked over to where Padma was talking to her sister. He cursed silently. This whole Ball was a shit show. Ron's problem was that he wouldn't express how he actually felt, and Hermione decided that for once she was going to let Ron figure out how to on his own. He sighed deeply. He knew the two had something going on, but he wasn't going to get involved.
"Yeah. He tried to help me with the egg. I refused, though. It felt weird to get help from a teacher."
"Right…" Draco said, unconvinced, then after a moment of staring at Harry, realised what was causing the boy so much discomfort. Fighting the urge to smile, he said in a serious tone, "You know…if you want, just take one with you."
"He should have killed you." Moody said, "But never mind that now. I will finish to task my Lord sought out to complete." He pointed his wand at Harry, hand shaking in anger.
"And you accepted…" Blaise trailed off inquiringly.
"Yep. He's an Order veteran, too, technically."
Draco yelped and rubbed his face, scowling. While he was scared of his father, when they were around his mother he became considerably less so.
"Harry and I noticed that except for the other Bill and Arthur Weasley, extremely trusted members, there were no Ministry employees inside that room." suggested Hermione.
"Do you think…still…Draco hates us?" She choked out, making Harry squeeze her tighter.
Harry looked at his shoes, nodding, "I understand. They're cunning and self-preserving and will do anything to win." He looked up at Sirius, knowing where his choices lay and trust had been placed, "But they're also loyal. Draco doesn't need to change. His loyalties lay in the same place as mine. I can swear it on my parents, if you'd ask me to."
it per se-"
Hermione pushed them into Binns’ class, and he lost the train of thought. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
"Puking Pastilles." Fred said smoothly.
He quickly looked away, not wanting to see Draco open it, even if he did. It wasn't much, just a short note he probably should have spent more time on, but hadn't known what to say when it came down to it.
Harry thought for a moment, picking up something that looked like an urn and chucking it in to the
Harry nodded, almost too eagerly. “Is that so?”
“More tea, sir?” Draco asked patiently, holding the small teapot up.
“Sir, what do you mean-”
Both and Pansy and Blaise's heads turned to Draco, so he drew in a sharp breath and handed his parchment to Theo, praying for patience.
"Of course not! I came here to eat on my own. Didn't know you'd be here to attack me." Draco said with a smirk. It felt nice for once that he had Potter on the blind side for once.
The bird assessed him, eyes never leaving his. He saw the flicker of something in them he couldn't understand. He'd never been good at reading emotions, but rather more at thoughts. He could see hidden discomfort only if it meant a lie. He could sense veiled anger only if it meant a possible threat. His father had taught him those kinds of things, but could never have been able to teach him how to understand what the beast in front of him held in it's gaze. It was pure, undiluted emotion that burned. He didn't know what it was thinking, let alone feeling, and it left him feeling unsettled and small.
"What? Then who?"
Draco thought for a moment. "Fine. I'd have had Sirius do it."
"Hey." Harry mumbled, face almost completely down in his tart. He was relieved he didn’t feel the same anger he did before at his friends. "Erm, what's up?"
Draco just shrugged, turning his back to Ron then throwing a wink at Harry, smirking. Harry glanced at Hermione, who had an amused twitch in the corner of her mouth.
“Explain what?”
"Right." Harry said slowly, "So what's the secret going to be? It's got to be right, otherwise…I don't really know. I'm kind of confused right now."
"I was
"Sweet boy." Draco remarked, quirking an eyebrow at Blaise. The boy's eyes followed Theo as he went.
There were already masses of crowds surrounding the Lake, and Harry rushed past them to the Champion's podium, heart racing.
At one point, Draco finally found out what had really happened to that over-sized chicken that'd attacked him in Third Year. It was living
"Then there you have it." The man said, as if it settled everything. "You need not to worry. You are not the first to change sides." Dumbledore glanced at Snape, who was looking at Draco with a frown. "I will keep you under my protection, along with the protection of the Order."
and he still had insecurities from it. The boy had the amazing knack for being able to make you feel less than two inches tall.
Umbridge stayed silent, seemingly absorbed in her own work despite Harry hissing in pain every few seconds as he continued to write lines. For some reason, he could tell she was paying attention to him but wasn’t showing it, and anger flooded through him at the thought of her possibly enjoying his small sounds of pain.
"I've heard. Not really good for Quidditch, though, is it?"
"But you believe that Voldemort might be coming back? Nobody's ever believed me, last I would expect was you."
"That's what someone who eventually dies would say." Draco snapped.
Dumbledore’s usual plaster of a smile was gone, and the air had changed to something more serious.
"Wow. Sorry, I forgot." Harry said. "Don't show anyone…"
He felt Blaise stiffen, but the boy stayed silent as permission for Draco to go on.
"Excuse me!" Vernon cut in, "I don't care what demented or dementia came for you, boy. It attacked my son!"
He watched Draco run a hand through his hair, causing strands that shone silver in the wand light to cascade over his face. Draco blew out a long, drawn breath that sounded tired and haggard, and the shadows over his face made him look even more so.
"So you're both like, what…friends now?"
, Draco. Now spill about what happened last night."
Sirius glared at him, then muttered an incantation under his breath that Harry didn't recognise. When Draco had asked earlier if he knew the spell, Sirius had agreed immediately with a sad look in his eyes which Harry didn't understand.
"Close." Sirius said with a sigh, placing his hands on his hips and glancing at the curtains. "Walburga. Nasty bitch."
as they danced. The prat probably came out the
"You condemn me as if the blood and flesh you're made of are not of the same breed." Moody snarled. Harry blanched, remembering seeing Lucius at the graveyard amongst the chaos.
Harry looked at Hermione, ignoring the absurdity of Ron calling Draco his

almost made that mistake! If I haven't, then Harry obviously-"
us, Draco.”
"Will they…" Draco started, his eyebrows furrowed and eyes nervously looking at the ground. "Will they get mad?"
also Ron being a good best friend is the best shit ever. i'll be taking that with me to the grave, too.
"Evening, Professor." He said, his heart beating rapidly but not letting his nervousness show on his face.
Draco frowned. Was Sirius really risking making an appearance here? Hadn't he said his Animagus cover was blown? What if his father saw-?
"It wasn't me-" Harry started.
Harry mused privately.
Harry shrugged, trying to look as laid back as possible. Inside, his heart was thundering and he was feeling pretty sorry for whichever elf was going to wash his shirt later. This was it. There was no going back. Merlin, Draco might actually kill him for this.
The voice raised some more as if coming closer to them, and the door swung open on it's hinges loudly. In sight was now Draco, one hand on the door handle while his body was still turned to the other gaping occupants of the room.
-o-o-
“And I do hope to not see either of you in my office again for the rest of this year
"Yeah. It's me."
"Are you ever going to answer any of my questions properly?"
But that only made Harry laugh harder. After a moment, Malfoy's scowl broke and he just
Draco nodded, feeling slightly shy, "Of Ronald mostly, when I saw them all on the platform the first day we were going to Hogwarts. They were so many of them, and they stood out so much. I saw Molly dote on all of them before boarded the train, straightening clothes out, fixing their hair. She wasn't necessarily…fixing them in the sense of correcting them, but cleaning them up. Fussing. It was the first time I realised that you could be…compassionate and caring rather than curt like my parents were to me."
"I'm not famous anymore." Harry almost laughed, a twitch at the corner of his mouth despite the evident tension throughout his body. "Not like that, at least."
If Draco didn't know better, he'd think his mother's tone was less instructive and more warning. He would have thought it was just his imagination if he couldn't see the intense worry in her eyes that no one but him might have been able to pick up.
Granger glared at him so strongly that he averted eye contact and mumbled, "Fine. Not the Weasel either."
“Yes, ma’am.” Draco said. It seemed that Umbridge wasn’t even acknowledging Pansy anymore.
charm, was the wand movement a loop or a half-circle?"
I’d been spreading around. Hearing that their master was once again coming to power...would cause quite a stir, wouldn’t it?”
?" Draco exclaimed.
"It's easy. Don't." Harry replied bluntly. But it wasn't that simple. Draco blew out a sharp breath, but didn't reply.
"I said I saw a rat."
"My boy!" Aunt Petunia wailed.
like that." Ron grumbled on the way down the stairs, all of them going silent and tensing up around the draped painting of Walburga.
-o-o-
"A Death Eater?" Draco said, "Yes he was. He was acquitted, though. Bit like my father." He spat the last part with bitter sort of venom in his voice.
Harry panicked. "What? Between childre- doesn't matter." He shook himself of the thought. "I don't think the law is much of a hinderance to him anymore, Hermione."
“Yeah.” Harry replied, taking a large bite of some toast. He was mildly worried at how Hermione would take the idea of taking the files from the Weatherby fellow, but he also wondered if Draco would even share that part specifically.
"Right now? Who, Pomfrey?" Harry scoffed.
Slowly, he became paranoid. Where was it all? Did he dream it all up?
Currently, she was getting along fine with a few other girls in First Year. In fact, she seemed to be quite sociable with others, but he didn’t know if that was because no one had realised she was muggle-born yet.
Draco wasn't sure how long he lay there on the cold ground, every nerve in his body sensitive and sending jolts of electricity through him if he moved. He tried to even his labored breathing, his voice raw from screaming for so long.
“Fucking hell.” he heard Pansy mutter, blowing into her cup of tea before sipping it.
Seamus paused, and he shared a seemingly silent argument with Dean for a moment as they just stared at each other. Dean kicked him softly again, gesturing harshly at Harry with his head. Seamus just sighed, rolling his eyes.
"You'll make the squid angry." Harry said, walking down to their spot and sitting down a respectable distance away.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't think Pansy would like coming to Potter's compartment so much as much as you do."
“You expect us to just be able to use the spells on the fly?” The girl retorted with outrage.
. And
"Because you're my best mate, and I know you, Harry." Ron nudged him with a shoulder playfully, "And you seem better after you talk to him. Even before the task, when you were close to murder over every bloody little thing, sometimes you'd come back from a 'walk' less twitchy and riled up. I don't notice a lot, but I know that was because of him." He scrunched up his nose distastefully, "I won't pretend I understand it, but if it works for you, it works for me."
“Why do you ask, Professor?”
“I have one more today, too.” Harry frowned.
He sat down on one of the benches, only to realise Pansy and Blaise were still standing, discussing something amongst themselves like they were parents called in to discuss about Draco in the Headmaster's office.
"Harry Potter! Dobby is to be waking up Harry Potter. Harry potter must be waking up!"
"I'm going to have to agree with Granger on this one, Weasley." He heard Malfoy interjecting next to him. Damn. It looked like the moment the git opened his mouth Hermione and Ron seemed to get angrier. Shit, he thought, fucking abort mission.
Having found a compartment on the train with all of his friends, it slipped Harry's mind that he had yet to get back his Invisibility Cloak. It wasn't until an hour in to the journey that he finally remembered, and hastily shot up out of his seat when he did.
"He's fine." Draco said dully, finishing his sketch of an Asphodel and adding odd lines here and there for no apparent reason.
look supremely pissed off, which probably meant he was in one of those moods of his).
"Because right now,' Harry continued, "I can see you're taking on some sort of burden for me. I'm sorry if I've made you feel…obligated to know things all the time. You don't need to solve everything that's in front of me. I've dealt with stuff like this since I was eleven. You don't need to…worry about me."
"Prefect?" Draco asked again incredulously. "You?"
"Yeah…" Harry said, not really knowing himself where he was going with this. "It was weird. Last time I'd seen him was in that Graveyard." He swallowed heavily, anxiety rising in his throat.
"Always." Harry said, and smiled when Sirius pulled him in to a hug, chuckling. He drew back with a soft smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.
"Bitch." He shot back.
"The Order of the Phoenix." She said, garnering a look from Harry. "It's a secret society that Dumbledore founded. It, erm, fought against
"Yes?" He answered impatiently, not taking his eyes off Harry, whom was staring at him indiscernibly with his back still half turned and pulled taut as if poised to strike at someone.
"Draco."
What was interesting, however, was that people indeed seemed to scorn Harry for whatever reason that applied. The Daily Prophet had really dug its heels into the story about him and Dumbledore over the summer, and the fruits of that labour were being consumed wholefully now as whispers rippled through the students almost the entire meal, almost as if at Harry’s every movement. Draco had heard bits here and there as he ate, dutifully keeping his head down in his plate of food and eavesdropping.
Regardless, Draco's first instinct to leave little old Potter hanging and reject his handshake was unfortunately conjoined with the reason to the proffered hand, which Draco had to analyse
Inside was Harry and Ginevra, as well as Longbottom and another dirty blonde girl he found to seem incredibly strange at a first glance, as she was holding a magazine completely the wrong way round. They all stopped and looked at him when he entered, and Harry, poor, stupid Harry, couldn't keep the idiotic joy off his face when he saw Draco.
“Pardon my niceties.” Draco drew his shoulders back, putting a hand on his hip. “Didn’t recognise it was you there, Potty.”
He quickly went to his  fireplace, just recently hooked to the Floo Network after pestering his mother for a week. He threw in the Floo Powder, and announced, "Prince Manor." with a whirl of green flames.
"Harry?" Draco stepped back a little. It was odd as it is seeing him without glasses, sleeping so vulnerably of all things.
His neck felt awfully exposed, and he shut his eyes in anticipation of any sudden movement. Something in his chest burned at the position he was in. It was embarrassing. Malfoys didn't bow like that. It felt wrong. Vulnerable.
Ron and Hermione didn't move, both of their mouths actually agape and the room so quiet that Harry could hear the faint murmurings of the meeting in the next room.
" Hermione warned.
Hermione blew out a long sigh, and Harry almost did the same.
i'm nervous how people might take this chapter in regards to the overall environment in Slytherin. I don't like to sugarcoat things, especially when they serve as commentary of real life situations (e.g. Draco being much more mindful of blood status within primarily Slytherin environments, as although he technically believes they hold no weight to a person's character, it just becomes relevant information around people who value such labels). Also, the introduction of a muggle-born seemed interesting because there's no way it didn't ever happen and the idea made me curious (or my memory might just be shitty and it was mentioned - it works either way).
" Draco glared at her, his eyes communicating that he'd caught on. "Lot's and lots of them. You see, I have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
?" Draco squeaked. Harry turned around quickly, high on alert, only to see a small, wrinkled creature limping across the hall that adjoined all the ground floor rooms. Upon closer inspection, Harry saw the few defining characteristics he'd seen on his old friend, Dobby.
Harry's mouth flew open, but he managed to shut it closed again. "Shit. It's nothing like that, I swear!" Harry protested. He sighed and slapped his forehead. "Alright, look. That night, we talked about stuff."
, idiot."
"So the task?" He asked.
"I did not
"Hm." He answered.
“Yeah...” Blaise trailed off, and the two boys dutifully avoided making eye contact.
Harry reached up and put his hand over Draco's . He nodded as well in return.
"I know, Ron. I was just too tired to be bothered to change. I'll meet you down at the Hall?"
As always, thank you for reading.
(See the end of the chapter for
At that moment, pain seared through him, not through his head but through the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff. He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her.
"No," Draco prompted with a wry smile, "I really am curious, Potter."
"Which one."
Malfoy dropped his quill and rustled with something on the side Harry couldn't see. A moment later, he brought up a napkin and placed it between them without a word. On it, were some pastries and the same single apple similar to last time. Harry watched Malfoy continue his work as if nothing much had just occurred, trying to gauge any sort of indication of what the other boy was thinking.
"Professor." Draco croaked, trying to get up but immediately falling back on to Harry.
After a moment, he looked away to the Lake, not saying anything.
“It’s Umbridge.” Harry said with a knowing look. The girl’s eyes widened in realisation, flitting back to the woman, who was now tittering away with a reluctant Professor Grubbly-Plank.
” she whispered shakily. “You...it was you?”
"I know, Harry." Draco laughed. "That's why I haven't been using it in front of anyone."
"Muggleborns?" Blaise exclaimed back, "What on earth would you and Potter have to possibly talk about there?"
"I see. We'll make sure to get Potter this time…" His father's voice faded as he and the other men walked away, and Draco took the opportunity to run up the stairs to his room.
"You'd say so." Harry said flatly. "And you're completely, one-hundred percent sure?"
"Apologise to me about everything. Right now. So we can get it out of the way."
-o-o-
At the thought, dread filled Harry at the thought he might never go back to Hogwarts. He looked at all his friends, thinking about what it would be like if they returned without him for the new year. The thought made the contents from lunch time unsettle in his stomach.
Harry saw Malfoy flail his arms in the corner of his eyes, "Of course I believe it! I was raised on it! Blood purity is
"I can tell when people lie." Draco said, and narrowed his eyes at Harry, "Especially you. It's the disgusting Gryffindor traits, I think."
"Who's in it?" Harry asked Granger, ignoring Ronald and Draco. Her eyes darted to him quickly, looking wearily as if he might start yelling again.
"Look, Remus-" Harry started.
“I understand that Professor Umbridge is raising concerns for your ability to carry out your duties, but at the moment we can only go by speculations. We, and most of all you, can not afford to act on assumptions, Mr Malfoy.”
Harry smirked, feeling his chest elate at Ron's words.
"What are we on about?" Pansy huffed, "You and Potter not fighting isn't a usual occurrence, Draco."
"I'm right here." Harry said before she could open her mouth, his tone already beginning to rise to a shout, "Ask
He remembered the words suddenly, from a particularly stifling Sunday afternoon at Hogwarts when he walked up to their spot by the lake and found Draco already curled up on his side, facing away from him. The sun was blazing mercilessly, and Harry stood there for a moment staring at the other boy before he reluctantly moved so his shadow blocked the rays off of him.
"Yes, sir." Draco gulped, body completely still and knuckles white from how much his hands squeezed together.
Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Sirius turned to face him.
Draco patted him on the knee, "We'll have time to talk about it later. I won't make you go over it again."
Ron and Hermione looked at each other for a moment, looking as if they were having a secret conversation with their eyes. Hermione laid a hand on Harry's knee, which took all of him not to pull away from.
"Enough!" Harry shouted. "Stop acting like I'm not here!"
He quickly took the time to grab his glasses and put them on, before pounding footsteps suddenly sounded on the thin floorboards outside his door. They were coming from- Shit. Uncle Vernon's room. The stag immediately blinked out, and the room was dark once again.
“Are you going to tell him about…” Ron gestured to Harry’s hand. Harry lifted it up speculatively, feeling the tightness under the bandage. He swallowed heavily, thinking of Draco knowing about anything from the detentions. Knowing what he’d done.
He messily folded up the letter and took it to Hedwig, whom was pleased to finally be let out of her cage. She grasped the letter and looked at him expectantly by the open window.
"You're really worried about the
"Yes, and?" Harry couldn't help but snap, and Ron quickly looked back down at his plate. Harry looked down at his own as well, having forgotten he was at breakfast. There was food on his plate, but he hadn't put it there. He reckoned it was Hermione who had, but she never knew what he really liked.
Blaise scoffed. “You have nothing I want and I have everything I need.”
Draco said nothing for a moment, “I can’t imagine her if not how she is now.”
Umbridge’s face twisted into that of horror. Her nails clawed down on her desk, scraping across it as she tightened her fists.
“That both makes no sense and contradicts itself.”
"Malfoy?" He said after another moment, looking to the boy who was fixated on the horizon. His ivory skin and platinum hair seemed to absorb the spectrum hues the sunrise brought. The lighting was extremely flattering, and Harry almost felt jealous that someone could look so good with so little sleep.
“Evening, Mr Potter,” Umbridge said. Harry sat down and looked up at her to see her eyes were glittering with something. It could have been curiosity, but it also could have been malice. “Had a good day?”
"Draco-"
. Her and her many, many cats…
Harry looked at Draco, whom was already looking at him. There was more colour in his face, and he looked otherwise unharmed.
Draco nodded. "I'll tell you later - all of you."
Hermione said nothing, and the silence around the house reigned. Harry glanced at his watch, seeing it was only seven o' clock.
Draco began to speak, but Harry held up a hand to finish speaking, "You intend to spy on
"Right. One, two -
"I do remember not seeing you both for a while after that - no, you two actually just disappeared outright after the dance. Merlin, I didn't think it was because you were
They stepped in to the entrance hall, where they were met with one of the house elves that took Draco's school trunk to his room and his mother's outer robes to hang up. Softly, she turned to him and placed a hand on his cheek before leaving to east wing of the house where she usually spent her days. He watched her go, dread filling up his entire body and his mind not really functioning coherently.
"I don't want you to think that you have to figure everything out. That you have to know what's going to happen next." Harry said.
, now would we?”
Harry held out his hand evidently and Ron frowned at it, thick eyebrows furrowing. “It’s ugly.” he said, making Harry snort.
"You both should get along just fine, then." Snape sneered, and Draco did his best not to glare at the man.
Then miraculously, his body filled with warmth starting from his chest outwards. His limbs loosened, and he opened his eyes to see a faint white glow covering his body in a thin, translucent layer. He craned his head to the window and saw the Dementor almost completely inside. He shot up, scrambling off the bed as his heart raced. He glanced at his wand on the other side of his room, then back at the window, swearing.
"Accio!" He shouted on instinct, throwing his hand out and feeling the cool wood of his wand slap in to his palm almost immediately. He thrust it at the window, now completely darkened as the Dementor closed in.
“It’s cool, Ron,” Harry said, confused why his friend was so jumpy about trying out for the team. “We could play together, yeah? You any good?”
"Well...Uh..." Harry started, "Shit," he said, "Ron, even ,em>I don't know. One minute I was arguing with the git, and then he asked me about the Ball, and then…He just made me so
"Sirius!" Draco called out. "Would you mind coming inside for a bit?" His smile turned in to a smirk, "Harry needs your help with something."
Harry arrived at the Great Hall eventually, flushed and panting, but arrived nonetheless. Even the food hadn’t disappeared yet, and it seemed he had time to spare.
Draco paused for a moment, filling in the blank Remus had left in sentence. "Men?" He asked, and Remus nodded. Draco thought for a moment, letting the idea sink in a bit.
Harry batted his hand away, "I'm not sick, you knob! It's the truth, if you'll just
Draco's heart began to thump in his chest uncomfortably.
"When." Hermione said.
"Damn righ- Argh!" Ron started, before Hermione tactfully slapped the back of his head by reaching across behind Harry.
After a rushed dinner, Harry stammered a quick, "Gotta go…Egg. Tournament. Bye!" And tried not to look like he was running that fast out of the Hall. Neither Ron nor Hermione seemed to think anything of it, continuing to argue about something together. He checked his watch, hoping Malfoy would be there already since he wasn't at dinner.
Now many other of the Gryffindor’s had their hands up, and Umbridge eyed them all with venom.
"-not sure. Slytherin didn't, so that's well. I think I saw some Hufflepuff's watching. Maybe some Ravenclaws, although I wouldn't worry about them. Luckily most of the Gryffindor's were gone, but the few who were left were too stupid to realise-"
“Yes, I am-” Draco started to hiss, before McGonagall herself appeared at the door looking slightly irritated.
"Yeah." He heard Malfoy say, then heard the sharp closing of a book and a bag rustling. "We better go now, though. Class is in fifteen minutes. I'll leave first?"
“Dead, no. Returned, yes.” Harry said back, crossing his arms.
To his Headmaster's side, stood Snape. His arms were crossed, nose in the air and fingers insistently tapping on the black fabric of his sleeves. He looked down at Draco as if he were something that had been found on the bottom of his shoes. Based on how Draco was acting, he didn't blame him.
“And you both are...?”
"Oi, Don't use that tone with me!"
“Ah.” Draco felt himself frown. Even though Trelawney was just a crazy old bat, the way Pansy had described it as a ‘path’ unsettled him slightly. “Unlucky him, I guess.”
"What?" Harry said, turning to Ron whom was glancing at Draco as if he might explode like Neville's cauldron.
He stepped In to the house, the heating inside washing over him like slipping in to a warm bath. The sounds of Mrs. Figg in the kitchen steered his direction, and he followed it unthinkingly, with only the brief wondering if she had any chocolate on hand that he could possibly eat. He could swear he vaguely heard the woman muttering something about a thing called a 'Mundungus' as the sound of the kettle sounded.
"Of course! I had to! If I hadn't he would've won! I did myself a favour if you really look at it-"
The window behind him begun to rattle. Draco thumbed his wand in it's holster on his arm. Surreptitiously, he cast a silencing spell over the room.
“What was the saying again?” Blaise continued through a snicker, “If a tree falls down when nobody’s there, does it make a sound?”
"Lights off?" Harry asked, eyeing the fire-lit lamp as he made his way to the door.
“She looks wretched.”
Not only that, but Podmore had been allegedly trying to break into a ‘top security door’, which scarily aligned very well with Draco’s own tormenting thoughts. The fact only spurred him on more, which made him wonder if this is what went through Harry’s head before every decision he made. It’s what finally led him, two weeks later on a Friday morning, to be waiting in Snape’s office for a Portkey to the Ministry.
"Stuff?"
He continued walking as if nothing happened. Harry's friends seemed none the wiser, but Draco managed to catch the boy's fleeting green eyes when he looked back. He nodded curtly and they went on their way.
"You'd better. I don't have time to child mind over your little naps. Go back to Gryffindor and sleep."
"No, wait!" Draco stopped him, then paused. "Will, erm, will Potter be there?"
"Wow." Draco whispered. "You must be glad he's back."
"You know what…" Harry said, "Maybe it's not so imp-"
"Harry!" The woman rushed to him and wrapped him in a bone-crushing hug that had Draco leaning away in order to not get bumped over. Harry hugged her deeply, eyes closed and a single tear rolling down his face.
Draco sighed next to him and turned over, his hands cushioning his head. He murmured something in his sleep Harry couldn't decipher, but found it amusing just the same.
Draco was looking at him, expression indiscernible, and Harry smiled and waved. Draco waved back, but he was still staring as if looking for something. Harry shook his head and looked away. Only a few minutes left. He had to focus on the task now.
"I know." He replied through gritted teeth, trying not to scrunch up the parchment in his hands. Why didn't anyone trust him to protect himself?
What was most unusual was, surprise surprise, Defense class. Draco had been anticipating a generally unsavoury lesson, but not a
“Oh, I will!” The woman replied excitedly. Draco flashed her a smile that always had his mother’s friends gushing over him and turned to leave, Pansy following sullenly behind him.
"Right. They'll obviously take something from you. What that is, we have no idea, but that doesn't matter for the moment. You'll have an hour to retrieve it, or…What was that last bit?"
Draco snapped the large book shut, sending dust flying into the air and making a loud sound that had Mrs. Pince eyeing him sourly.
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. “Take her!”
“What on earth is that supposed to mean?”
Also, happy 100K words ! this is like, bigger than your average novel length, which is weird.
They reached the staircase where they'd split to go to their dorms, and without a word separated. Harry trudged all the way up to Gryffindor Tower, cursing the amount of stairs he had to climb.
“That’s right, or that’s what I believe.”
"I very much
-o-o-
“Alright,” she said with a frown. “What I also wanted to ask was about your hand, Harry-”
"I'll change that." His father ran his own fingers across his wand.
“What d’you mean?” Harry sighed.
“Thank you.” Draco sighed behind him as if finally getting something off his chest. The reality of how much pressure Draco was under hit Harry again, and he felt a strange sense of satisfaction at having not said anything about his scar, just because it lessened the burdens on Draco’s shoulders.
, will lead only dead men." Draco replied, staring coldly at his Headmaster.
. Whatever he was supposedly winning, Draco didn't care, but he wasn't going to let himself be blindsided by Potter. Granted, what Potter did was undeniably very manipulative, very
It was by far the easiest part of their morning.
“You?”
"What are we doing here, Harry." Malfoy whispered next to him, the sound of his voice almost a direct echo of the way Harry's thoughts had felt like just the moment before. Harry was sure if he had verbalised his feelings from earlier, his voice would have had the same wistfulness as Malfoy had done then. At that current moment, it felt as if him and the Slytherin were somewhere else than the rest of the people in the Hall. Like they were behind a glass wall and people were too blissfully immersed in themselves to notice.
Draco grit his teeth and his head collapsed in to his hands with a frustrated sigh.
"I…I mean, it's not like I can't just tell you whatever it is they tell me. Afterwards, that is." Draco said quickly. He nudged Harry playfully, "It is what we agreed to, and all."
"I said they won't ask." Harry repeated. "They don't care."
"Order?" Draco asked.
Harry couldn't suppress a small grin, "You're right. Remind me when I see Voldemort next that his ideas and methods are quite silly."
Seeing Harry's expression, Malfoy rolled his eyes and said, "Lolligo is the Giant Squid, Potter."
"Save it, Harry." Draco said, voice still hoarse and holding up his free hand. He limped slowly to the edge of Harry's bed, eyes assessing him.
"The two have much to do with each other, Draco." Dumbledore said coolly. "Friendship and war."
Harry shrugged, “I’m probably gonna miss Quidditch Keeper tryouts on Friday. Because of detention.”
The mid-day light from outside shone through his window, and it flickered momentarily as a bird flew past. He sat up, glancing at the window and the grounds outside. It was a considerably clear day, especially since the weather in Wiltshire was almost under constant overcast. He saw the mouth of the dense woods at the far end, and moved his eyes to his left knee.
Draco stared at the jewels adorning the woman's neck and fingers. "That's what I call talent." He murmured.
The letter was considerably longer than what Harry had first sent, and probably even longer than the dry responses he often got from Ron and Hermione. Harry climbed back in to bed and hid under the covers. Luckily the first few breaks of dawn started to show through his window, so he didn't have to squint too hard at the words on the parchment to see them.
“Yes, Professor McGonagall.” Harry nodded solemnly. With a curt nod and an expression that seemed to soften, she let them go to collect their things. They travelled carefully through the halls in case anyone might spot them together.
Had Draco been a more prideful sort person, things may have gone differently after that night. Much to his father's distaste, however, Draco had always had his mother's demure, more sensitive attributes in him than his father's ruthlessness and strength. Not that his mother wasn't strong, but his father tried his very best to change those parts about Draco the most in his childhood. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't act how his father wanted him to for a very long time, and he was often stuck in between being himself like his mother, or taking the role of who his father wanted him to be.
He sat in Double Potions first thing that morning, admiring a very resilient speck of dust in the air as Snape rambled on about the thick grey potion in front of him. He knew it probably wasn't best to piss Snape off by not listening, especially after the man looked at Harry with more disdain than usual when he walked in to class earlier, but listening to the man drone on about appropriate cauldron thickness gave Harry no incentive to pay attention. Harry figured it had to do with him and Malfoy at the Ball, but he left the issue for Malfoy to deal with. Harry sighed deeply at all the House Points they were bound to lose that lesson.
?" He couldn't help the laugh that bubbled out of him at Malfoy's sour expression.
After a moment, the sound of frail tweeting filled the air, and out from the ashes emerged a baby bird. It looked around in innocent, vital wonder as if seeing the world for the first time despite the fact that it had probably been reborn as such many, many times before.
The corners of Draco's mouth twitched, and he tightened his squeeze on Harry shoulder for a moment. "Evidently."
Draco frowned. “But Professor,” he reasoned, “she’s a very keen woman. She’s bound to notice something amiss if my father continues to act, and after that, she’ll come after me first thing.”
" He said, pointing a finger at Potter accusingly, "Just your bloody luck!"
He glanced at Draco briefly when Dumbledore said that, and found him staring right back. His hands were clasped in front of himself and his body was turned to the front, but his eyes were on Harry. His expression didn't change from the blank mask he had on, but Harry saw the briefest twitch of his head. His eyes were back at the front within an instant, and Harry looked down when he realised the amount of stares he could feel prickling on his skin. Majority, he realised, were coming from the Hufflepuff table, and he couldn't help the bubbling of nausea rising in his stomach. He immediately regretted eating anything at all, and his muscles felt tense as if coiled to run away within a moments notice.
"Right! Now I don't have any other family except for my mother's sister - muggle woman, of course. So my poor little orphan arse was dumped on my poor aunt, and I was raised in their muggle home for the first eleven years of my life. Nobody told me about magic. I was not told I was a Wizard. I wasn't even told how my parents really died."
Draco set his tea on the table gently. "No sleep?" He asked, his tone soft to match the quiet of the house.
' look. Nott stepped back nervously and stalked out of the dorm without a word as well. Good to know Blaise's impeccably short temper had an effect on Draco's reputation as well. Whether that was a good thing or not, Draco didn't bother to ponder about.
Harry also started throwing on his uniform and robes, realising a full shower was out of the question. “What, you talked to Seamus in the shower? You couldn’t have waited?”
Potter quirked a crooked smile, "I did in class yesterday."
Harry's shoulder's sagged slightly after that and his eyes lost a fraction of anger, "I -"
“I understand what he’s saying, about his father.” Hermione went on.
"I do, Draco, and I'm not doubting your idea, I hope you know that. What I'm trying to get at is do
In first year, it was with Quidditch for the most part (which was aggravated to the utmost degree by Harry being...well, quite amicable at flying) and in Second it was all that bloody bullshit with the Chamber of Secrets (seeing Harry hiss at that snake only made him think about the whole situation more). Third year was with those dementors (Merlin, they were great fun, weren’t they? Not when he made Harry fall off his broom, whoever. No way was that in any way amusing at all… Not even in the slightest…) and Fourth Year was the time when it had been it’s worst, when he’d been thinking about the Triwizard Tournament, and most of all thinking about the circumstances revolving around Harry’s place in it.
Blaise nodded gravely, "Got him sent all the way to Azkaban. Granted it
"Say it!" Both Ron and Hermione yelled in unison, looking on edge from the mystery Harry was alluding to.
"There has to be more that we can do." Harry protested. "Some way we can help!"
In short, he was a glorified, elaborate librarian.
Harry frowned, still looking up. “We’re on at four. You lot better clear out before then.”
“Not funny.” Blaise said.
"Exactly!" Sirius exclaimed, eyes brightening at Draco. "The man's a nut, I tell you, Draco. I've no idea how you lot deal with him as Head of House. Must be a bloody nightmare, let me tell you. Is it true he does random checks on the boy's dorms for the Slytherins?"
“Uh, yeah. Thanks.” Harry mumbled, putting his glasses back on and squinting at the change in vision.
Draco threw his head back and laughed. The thought itself was amusing, but not as much as Potter thinking it was possible.
At Draco's grimace, Bill laughed and clapped him on the back. "Off you go, then. I won't keep you. When Dumbledore gets here, I'll come get you."
what have i gotten myself in to.
"I need to see-"
"But you're not really playing along on our side." Harry added. Draco nodded and Harry finished, "You're actually on our side, but you're pretending you're not so you can get information from
"Only around one week in did they start. After that…" He trailed off giving him a knowing look, eyes puffy behind his circular-rimmed glasses.
Harry grinned, "Yeah. It was bloody amazing. But he seemed to agree with me. He was different after. And then he…"
"Oh no. Harry you didn’t really-"
Over and over, and soon the wounds stopped closing up. He just kept digging in deeper and deeper, blood oozing out and staining the parchment already stained in the first place.
"But what on earth was a Dementor doing in Privet Drive?" She cried.
Doing the same, Harry followed quickly behind to catch up with him. "Rose stems don’t have hands."
Somewhere in the depths of his brain, he remembered why he was there, and that small bit rejoiced because he couldn’t. Rejoiced at the small supplementary image of Umbridge’s momentary expression of unbridled fear before he’d left the room.
Inside, Ron was laying on his back in his bed with his arms crossed behind his head. When he saw Harry, his eyes narrowed and he and turned his back to him to face the wall.
“Oh, that would be lovely.” Lancaster gushed, his cheeks rosy and his smile wide. He then turned back to Blaise to continue what he was saying.
In the mirror, his eyes, the one’s that matched his mother’s and one of the only things he really had left of her, turned from green to a deep and bloody crimson.
"And Lupin is without a job-"
As he passed by a window, he spotted a small figure on their broom out on the Quidditch pitch. Upon further inspection, a familiar flash of ginger hair and the heavy-footed gait of the person told Draco that he was currently looking at no other than Ronald Weasley flying through the air.
, especially when you know that there's Death Eater activity targeting you!" Sirius then went on a lengthy tirade about the man's crimes and misplaced trust.
Harry leant back with a loud exhale, running his hands through his hair again. "Okay." He said, thinking deeply. "I'm too sleep-deprived for this. We'll talk more later with Ron and Hermione. It's too-" He yawned, "-early, right now."
But his train of thought was cut off when the curtain swished to the side and Draco appeared, clutching his stomach and slightly hunched over.
"Christ." Harry muttered grumpily. "Got your Apparition licenses, then?"
-o-o-
"Right." Hermione said, unconvinced. She glanced at Harry, and for some reason he didn't want to look at her, and probably not Draco either. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk. There was something bubbling inside him as he'd watched his friend's joy. It was burning, almost painful and in complete contrast to how he should have been feeling. It felt insipid and hateful, and it's voice almost reached out and grasped hold of him.
Nothing came from the boy across from him for a moment. Draco was just about to assume that Blaise had simply resumed reading his book before the boy finally spoke.
"Potter!" Draco called out to the retreating figure. Potter turned around quickly, and Draco noticed he was flushed and his eyes were terribly bloodshot. He could see the first few buttons of his shirt under his robes weren't even buttoned properly. Potter saw Draco and scowled, but it disappeared as he approached. Draco stopped in front of him, hands on his knees and catching his breath.
"I have." offered Draco, but was only rewarded by a scalding glare from Ron and a light punch to the side from Harry, still slumped over. He yelped embarrassingly, rubbing his side.
"Yes."
necessary?"
Draco nodded, not believing a word the boy said but decided not to push it. "Well, alright then." He said, but then heard a rush of voices coming from behind him as students began to flow out the Hall to all their classes. He looked at Potter, whom was looking back at Draco worriedly. Draco shot him a quick pitying look with his eyes and brushed past him, making sure to shove Potter's shoulder as he passed.
“We’ll see.” Sirius said.
to be one of them. To have
." Harry hissed, exiting the kitchen to see Draco freeze on the stairs with one leg in the air above the step in front of him. Once he saw the look on Harry's face, he broke in to a run.
"Very well. Five points from Gryffindor for loitering around the ingredients tray, Potter."
He took a moment to really take in the words and almost laughed aloud. Lies? None of it was a lie and the bitch probably knew it. She wouldn’t go after Draco’s father if it wasn’t. She wouldn’t work so hard to emphasise they were lies at all if they weren’t. Hell, she wouldn’t have gotten so scared the day before when he...
Potter chuckled and scowled at him seemingly out of habit, then glanced again at the food. He looked at them hungrily but for some reason didn't pick one up.
, Draco." He said, his voice quavering slightly that made Draco's heart sink. "Do you know what he said before he did it?" Draco assumed Harry was talking about Cedric. "He said
Blaise glanced up from the pages, giving Draco a cursory once-over. “Snape’s essay got you down? I can’t say I blame you.”
"About that," Malfoy said, peering at Harry inquisitively, "Did you actually put your name in?"
"You look different." Dean said, narrowing his eyes. Harry cringed, but that didn't stop attention being drawn to him immediately.
"The Black Family Tree." Hermione said quietly, gazing in awe at the tapestry.
She caught the wand deftly, peering at it for a moment before looking back up at him. Draco raised an eyebrow, crossing his arms as well.
"Wow." He heard Weasley say. Draco looked up and saw the boy was actually looking at him in
"What, like a spy?" Harry asked.
Just before everyone had filed out of their Potions class, Draco quickly took out the triangle note Harry had thrown and scribbled something on the back. He folded it up as best he could in to the neat little shape it was, then tried his best to catch Harry's eye.
"Our new line, coming soon." George advertised. "Puking Pastilles! Designed to make you sick enough to leave class for a bit, without lasting effects!"
"Are you here to obliviate me?" He asked dully without looking up.
"You'd better! I'm this close to beating the shit out of you!" And Harry immediately cut him off by covering his mouth with his hand. Draco's eyes widened, seething.
At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black-maroon quill beside it.
"I'm unsure what you mean." Draco said irritably, trying to continue to work.
"Obviously not!" Harry shouted back, annoyed, as the wailing started up again. He scrambled back from the moth-eaten curtain as it screamed some more, seeing it now semi-opened and a pale face looking at him through it.
The tips of Ron’s ears were red as well now. He was staring at Hermione with amazement. “Really?”
"But - I know he risked his life for you and stuff…" Ron said hesitantly, "But how do we really know he won't just get scared and bugger off to his dad about the Order at any given time?"
“Harry?” It was Ron’s voice, but Harry was too busy being sent sprawling to the ground. He fell on his arse and looked up to see Ron with his Cleansweep Eleven held behind his back.
"Sorry, Harry!" He called after Harry through the open door, trying his best not to burst out laughing mid-sentence, "They're stuck down with permanent sticking charms! I'd get one down for you if I could, though!"
"What was he thinking?" Hermione cried. "It's illegal for minors to swear any sort of magical bond! It's like…child marriage!"
by one of his other followers!"
haven't started studying?" Hermione exclaimed.
, what happened with you and Potter? Did you hex him? Did he hex you? You don't look particularly injured. Please tell me you dumped his body in the Forbidden Forest." He pulled out his wand and cast a tempus charm, showing it was only ten in the morning and that everyone else had gone to breakfast. Draco gave a start before remembering it was a Saturday and they had no classes.
"Why me?" Harry hissed back.
-o-o-
Granted, the hand looked suspiciously sweaty, but Draco didn't particularly care at that moment as Harry fucking Potter was offering him his hand. The Slytherin inwardly preened at the site, separating it from the circumstances momentarily and took satisfaction in the parallel it took to their first year. Of course, Draco had let go of the disastrous moment when Potter dug his own grave and rejected the very
"Dumbledore never really specified what made it so, but he did say that he explicitly trusted you, and at some point after Harry was captured and escaped on the night of the final task, you'd saved his life."
"Yeah." Draco said quietly. "I'm worried." He took a large gulp, his throat feeling scratchy and congested.  "I have a bad feeling. I've had it for a while now. And in my head…" He drew his knees up to his chest and rested his forehead on them, looking down. "In my head, it all leads to the same place, like…" He held up his hands and traced lines through the air with his fingers. "Like strings. I don't know how they weave together, but I know where they lead, and they all lead to tomorrow for some reason." He puts his hands down again, staring in to his open palms. "I can't explain it, though. I'm sorry. I wish I knew."
"Hold on." Harry said, sitting up straighter, "Is Snape also…"
assume no one in this house gives a damn about you, because they do. You were in that house on Dumbledore's orders, so neither me nor your friends are going to answer for that. Do you understand?"
"Not hungry." Harry said, and Draco tutted.
“You told me to lay low.” Harry argued, running a hand through his hair exasperatedly.
He knew this feeling. It was similar to that moment in the first task of the tournament, when he'd summoned his broom. He'd held his wand up to the sky, and screamed,"
"It's attractive." Dean reassured him, "Don't worry about it."
"I didn't say it because-"
"Yeah. Uniform? You left us after dinner and I fell asleep before you came back. Did you sleep at all? You look bloody awful." Then a look of horror spread across his features, "Mate…It's not…" He leaned in over Harry some more, making him slightly uncomfortable and whispered, "
Draco looked curiously at Harry, not expecting the boy to have been one for small details as far as his eyes could see. "Ah, yes. The murder forest, the bottomless squid vessel and a boarding school. Beautiful, Potter."
He shook his head slowly, "I would rather die." He said, voice quivering slightly. "It's not what I believe in." He looked up at the man with his eyes, barely moving up his head.
"I hate you. "
Ron shrugged, “Your choice. I’m guessing that's why Hermione doesn’t know yet, either?”
"Oh." Harry said, craning his neck and realising Draco was right, and he could see the entrance. "I hadn't noticed that."
Draco took the time to look down at the rest of Harry, and barely managed to hide the change in his expression. He hadn't realised it before because of Harry's hideous oversized clothing, but Harry looked skinnier than when he'd left for the summer. It was a significant amount than normal in Draco's opinion, and his mind started on the dark trail of thought of what exactly Harry's relatives tolerated in their dislike of him. He shook off the thought for the time being, not wanting to address it with Harry just yet.
Draco barely held back a smirk. "Not what?"
McGonagall followed in not long after. "Oh, dear boy." She said upon seeing Harry, eyes worried and pitying.
"Just a bit of the Cruciatus Curse. I'm fine otherwise." Draco said simply.
Eventually, he'd made himself a significant figure in the house of Slytherin despite his young age. He was as renowned as Potter was in his own House, only the Slytherins were less exhibitive of it. The more he begun to act like his father, the more he became a leader in Slytherin and the more his father rewarded him for it. Praise was sparse from the man, but with every highest mark or best of a muggleborn in Quidditch or classes, his father would actually smile at him for once and he would feel a happiness he rarely ever felt.
"Snuffles means well, Harry." Hermione said, laying a hand on his shoulder that took all of him not to brush off immediately. "He's doing it because he cares."
Oh. He was talking about the counter for the
." Draco said sharply. "Once the Ministry sinks it's talons on the school even a little, do you think they'll just settle for that? They pretty much hate you right now, Headmaster. They'll take any chance they can get to get rid of you." It wasn't like he was concerned for the man, but having him leave his position as Headmaster could only seem like more trouble for all of them. It wasn't lost on him that Dumbledore was still one of Voldemort's strongest deterrents.
Looking at the letter addressed to his father, he was still unsure which side this came from and which side Umbridge herself was on.
"Bloody hell- lay off! I won't! It'll kill me this time, Harry, just you watch!" Draco struggled against the Weasley's grip, but to no avail. He was hauled upstairs to the level with all the Black family bedrooms. Draco saw the door, bigger and more detailed than the rest.
"Obliviate?" He heard Snape repeat incredulously. Dumbledore just chuckled.
It's not like he could do much, but was he be doing as much as possible? He didn't have a lot, just the contents of his room and Hedwig. Harry sat up from under the covers on the edge of the bed. He surveyed the room, the particles of dust floating in the air as a bit of sunlight peaked through the window. His trunk was tucked in the side of the room, but it's contents were strewn about over the course of the few weeks. He eyed his wand, growing it's own layer of dust on his side-table. He knew he couldn't use it, but felt the need to have it there just in case.
“You can just admit you missed school, you know?”
Of course, the wounds on the back of his hand stopped healing early into the evening and there was a steady flow of it as the words only got cut deeper. Blots of blood stained the parchment and blurred over the lines he wrote. At one point, he was sure he felt Umbridge’s satisfied gaze staring at the scattered crimson drops.
"No - I meant…" Draco sighed, gesturing vaguely to their hands.
"Draco, I know you're a smart boy. You wouldn't have done this for no reason. Harry, I'm sorry you've had to take such extreme action for the sake of your friend. Both of you are extremely brave, and I'm not…protesting, because I think you necessarily did a wrong thing."
"Ow! Blimey Hermione, you're crushi-"
Draco looked at the girl. She was wearing a plain dark blue dress with silver embroidered animals - no, birds - running across the fabric. She didn't look bad, but it wasn't anything particularly grand, either. It was nice, if she was going for a house costume contest look. She did look happy with Cedric, however, whom Draco took a bit more time pleasantly admiring.
believe it's genetic."
“I get it, Ron.” Harry tossed the paper into a nearby bin. The room began to spin again and he gripped his head with a hiss.
, Draco." Harry swatted him away.
"Oh." Malfoy said, looking the most inarticulate Harry had ever seen him. Watching Malfoy's cheeks blossoming in pink and feeling himself flushing as well, Harry turned quickly back to his potion, which was now showing signs of preconceived failure. Trelawney would have been proud. The chatter around the room resumed, along with a bit more murmuring than usual.
" Draco gaped. "Why on earth would I do that?"
His arms came up instinctively around Draco's waist, and he couldn't help but sink in to the embrace before he could even think about it. He dropped his head on to Draco's shoulder until his forehead was pressed to it.
Letting go, he tutted irritably. "You were holding
"Your father has a congenial working relationship with Dolores, not to mention you are a pureblooded Slytherin."
"I regret nothing." Harry shot back, rubbing his right hand with the phantom feeling of magic on his skin.
“Me? What did I do?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him. After a moment, the reason for Seamus’s scorn dawned on him.“I… Was this because of the
"I…" Harry slumped back in seat. "Fine. It's just…We can't be fighting every time we're all in a room. Just behave around them, alright?"
Encouraged by the lack of sound inside, he tip toed inside in the hopes of makes a cup of tea before he spotted a shrouded figure in the corner of the kitchen table.
! What you think will kill us all one day. Your father will kill us, and someday so will you." Harry finished with his chest heaving from the exertion. Malfoy stayed silent. He was staring at floor where Harry's feet looking to be thinking hard about something. His faces looked so crestfallen in contrast to in the Hall, Harry wanted to doubt it was the same person.
"Because…you've already broken the Statute of Secrecy once this month." Draco said quickly. He tried to pull his hand away from Buckbeak's, but just ended up bringing Harry's hand with his. The boy, infuriatingly, didn't let go.
“Alright?” Ron asked carefully, taking the wand from his grip and setting it aside. Harry bowed his head, eyes closed to stop any more tears. He slumped on to his bed, sitting with his head in his hands.
Ron scoffed, "Don't bother trying to get me to apologise to that git."
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed his face, stiff from the dried tears.
“Evening.” Harry replied flatly, reminding himself that punctuating his sentences with spitting at the woman would only incur the wrath of several people he knew.
“For real?” Blaise asked, eyebrows raising. “She looks…”
"Yes, this included the blood bigotry." The boy said ruefully. "And I'm still a Pureblood. I still take pride in it, but now I'm rethinking everything. All he does is talk about the war when he does speak to me over holidays. Odd little remarks about the Dark Lord or some muggleborn at the ministry he didn't like. I never noticed it until now but he made it sound like he
"There's a lot you also don't know, Potter."
"Oh! Hello Harry!" He heard Hermione exclaim in surprise in one ear. Almost immediately, he felt both his friends arms come around him, encompassing him from both sides.
"I don't bloody know. Aren't you the Pureblood? Magic something up for us!" Harry said, waving his hand around.
"I did it for your safety. Had you gotten involved-"
Draco laughed again. "Probably."
It didn’t help with Umbridge’s class inspections, which were nothing short of distractions that only put him off his concentration and agitated him further. He also nearly had to leave the room during Defense one day that week, after Harry had landed himself in detention yet again for the same reason as last time. It only cost Draco every nail on his left hand after gnawing at them agitatedly and he could barely even glance at Harry the next few days out of pure anger. He didn’t even bother trying to speak to the boy, lest he lost control and bit his head off.
"Splendid." Dumbledore checked his watch. "My, a little late aren't we?" The old man got up and nodded at Snape. "See you next week, Severus. When is little Draco due back?"
"Well, I told him he could never call anyone a mudblood again, or you a blood-traitor, Ron. In fact, I just told him to stop being a prick in general." Harry felt himself involuntarily smile a little, "And I guess he did."
"Thank you." Harry murmured in to the boy's shoulder after a moment of fragile silence, and he meant it more than anything in the world.
"Malfoy's
“Of course not.” Harry replied smoothly, catching her attention once again. “A punishment is a punishment, of course. Wouldn’t want anyone to hear what I said and have any
Mrs. Weasley leapt to her feet, "Breakfast."
Harry exhaled, unconvinced. “But if they do expel me,” he said quietly, “can I come back here and live with you?”
“Well, it's basically true at this point!”
"Still, I admit not even I believed him. I was sure it was some sort of a trick. You're the last person I could possibly have believed of saving Harry's life, and one of the first to be on the other side of the wand. Not that you were the most evil…Merlin. What I'm trying to say is no one expected it. Most of us were sure you were trying to pull something for your father."
"You're not…gay?" Draco said confusedly, the word still feeling unfamiliar on his lips.
"It'll be fine- Do you mind?" Draco started to panic, and Harry looked at him in confusion.
"Is this…"
Draco left, and the room was submerged in a thick silence. Harry broke it by sighing loudly and taking off his glasses to rub his eyes.
“Because she truly enjoys the solidity of the institution. Rules exist and she has the ability to exercise her control because of them. Without them, what type of person would she be?”
" His voice steadily as he spoke, and Harry looked back at him angrily with furrowed eyebrows and clenched fists.
“But I…” Harry looked back down with a deep sigh that seemed to droop his shoulders impossibly low. “I just got so angry. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
Harry laughed, "I'd rather not. We'd be here all night."
“Oh…” Draco’s coughing settled down. “I don’t suppose you can get out of it?”
“Could you make things sound any more incriminating?” Pansy sighed.
-o-o-
“Erm, yeah.” Ron squinted downwards as he fumbled with his tie, looping it clumsily. “Nothing scarier than telling a bloke to lay off than when he’s got his bare bollocks out and you’re standing there fully clothed cornering him, y’know?”
can of worms right now. "They don't like me. Could we just leave it at that? I'm really tired."
Draco snapped his eyes to Blaise quickly, making momentary eye contact with the boy, who was looking equally stressed.
Hermione smiled genuinely, looking pleased. “Oh, well that’s alright, right, Harry?” Hermione smiled genuinely.
Within a second, he felt the rush of magic through his arm, not leaving his body but travelling though it to his head. There was a red flash of light that came from the spell before his eyes for a moment, but he kept them trained on Umbridge’s. He wondered for a moment whether he could really pull this off...
"Wow." Ron said, "How did you manage to change a ponce like that, Harry?"
The interrogation of Barty Crouch Jr. went by without any time passing at all. Harry just sat there and watched as the man spewed hatred and insanity, completely devoted to his master.
And Malfoy didn't say anything.
"It looks like you've really thought this over." Ron said, looking unamused but considerably more calm than before.
Harry opened an eye and regarded Malfoy coolly, "Don't worry. I'm not."
Standing there, in the Hall, however, Harry for once felt alright. He still felt tired, but now he knew what it was. That it had a name.
"And thus, he's been a pain in the arse since, cooped up here." Remus said. "Dumbledore hasn't really felt Sirius has anything to do for the Order, either…"
Luckily for them, Umbridge wasn’t in the room when they returned and had probably scurried off to the Great Hall for lunch, so they quickly packed their things in silence.
Dumbledore glanced at the watch on his frail wrist, grey eyebrows shooting up. “Why, it’s getting quite late. I’m afraid we must get you back to your dormitory before curfew.”
Trust Potter to cause him hell when he wasn't even
"Ronald, even
"Yeah." Harry grunted.
"Today. Just before you arrived."
"Your dad being who he was, I find that hard to believe." He said, and slapped Harry on the back. "Now go on. Your friends must be waiting."
Draco looked up quickly, seeing Remus looking down at him sympathetically. The man was littered with scars, all of over his face and hands and any other exposed skin that could be seen. Draco briefly wondered about the full moon and when it was. He vaguely remembered it being close, waking up particularly early one morning with the lopsided silver still visible in the dark blue of dawn. Lycanthropy wasn't something he knew a lot about, not if it wasn't something awful that had come out of his father's mouth before, but it definitely seemed to take a toll on the man in front of him.
Umbridge seemed to develop a tic in one of her eyes, but her face was still stretched into a cold, forced smile that he was sure he’d be seeing on his boggart from now on.
"We both love Harry much. What I'm getting at is we're grateful for you, right now. What you're doing for the Order."
Harry's body slumped, his head falling in to his hands with a sigh. "I…Yeah. He's right."
"Reception?" Draco asked, peering wearily at the string.
. Magic could only do
"Oh my god…" He gasped, "You named the Giant Squid…
"Yeah, of course." Harry said. "But aren't they the adults? They're literally the Order itself, at that. Maybe we should just trust them?"
Harry grinned sidelong, "I thought he was your squid?"
Draco shook his head. "I don't think so. I was too naïve. I didn't know then what I know now." He said quietly.
Umbridge tilted her head again as if studying him. Harry let her keep the silence for a bit. She was meant to make assumptions.
Just then, Theodore Nott walked in whistling and looking like he was on top of the bloody moon. He stopped as soon as he saw Draco stood up on his bed, hands still in his pockets.
"Oh." Draco said, the new information sinking in. "I never thought about it that way."
stood at the top. Dropping down were the three sub-roles given to the Heads of each aspect of archiving: organizing, preserving, and securing.
“Yeah.” Ron exhaled, then he frowned. “But Harry, you're-”
"Well what else then? He can't still be in the Forest."
Ronald just laughed smugly as if he knew something Draco didn't, which for the record would
"Erm, right." Harry said, face looking directly in to his food which he was pushing around his plate with his fork. Draco felt himself frown, but said nothing more.
Something foreign was stirring inside of him. It almost felt out of control, like it would consume him completely. He wanted to see her crumble from fear. He wanted her to never even try to mess with him again. This wasn’t even rage, it was malice. It was so foreign to him that his stomach threatened to empty itself again, making his body sweat as he forced the urge away.
"You really want me to answer that?" Harry asked rhetorically, continuing to sweep the droppings.
The terrible feelings surged to the forefront of his mind. A voice coiled itself around his brain, and it was almost as if he could hear it beside him, whispering in to his ears.
Draco shivered, wondering why Albus Dumbledore was trying to tell him he was merely as mortal as everyone else when he was supposed to be the strongest. The reason why Voldemort was still where he was and not ruling the wizarding world.
"What." Draco hissed. "
Draco looked at him candidly, smiling tiredly, “Yeah. Pretty eventful first day, wasn’t it?”
next to it with an arrow.
"You're lying!" He gasped, and Potter just shook his head smugly while obviously trying to hold back a laugh, "That's insanely unfair! Bloody Hufflepuff's!" And Potter finally let out a loud laugh at Draco's dismay.
Draco swore under his breath, "Fuck. I'm fine, Potter's fine. We're all fine! Nothing wrong with us! And he's not a loon, Pansy. You'd know if you could recognise genuine journalism for once." He spat.
"No, Harry." Ron cut him off, "That's all I had to say. I'm leaving."
“Like, access?” Draco asked.
"My hearing!" Harry exclaimed, covered in grime and sweat as he swept at the dried droppings of an unidentified creature on the wooden floors. He stopped sweeping and turned to face Draco with an elbow propped up on the broom handle. "No way she's our next teacher."
"Well, Harry. Ron and I have been observing you for a while now. Since the start of spring term, to be precise."
“Oh,” Harry said, eyes switching between Ron and the broom. “Keeper?”
Remus and Sirius's face both lit up, looking at each other.
Remembering who he was with and suddenly feeling very tense, Harry wanted to put them both back where they were. "I said we would talk, remember?"
"They went to Hogsmeade." Draco answered after he stopped laughing, "I wanted to stay and get some work done."
Ronald blinked once, then gestured around the room extravagantly, "Well, I don't see another bloke here."
"He must have been shaken." Hermione said.
"Right. We can expect some sort of dark magic to make him stronger. For now, what that ritual is, who's in charge of it and when it's going to happen is unknown. I don't think my father's involved, so it will be difficult to know for sure."
"It's all your fault." Draco said offhandedly, instead focusing closely on Harry all of a sudden. His eyes were roving somewhere over his shoulder for some reason, and Harry whipped around to see if anyone was behind them.
“Take this to the DMA’s Head office at the Ministry. It should be directed to its final place from there - the address is properly written on the letterhead if you come into trouble finding it.” he told Athena, stroking her once. Athena hooted, satisfied with the treats. With a strong, single flap of her large wings, she was in the air once again, soaring out of one of the windows into the clear blue sky.
Immediately, thoughts of the Ball sent his stomach down to his feet as a steadily rising anxiety churned in his chest. Harry was used to fucking up, but usually the end result was dying, or torture. He would have gladly taken death or torture at this moment. He squeezed his eyes shut.
"Right." Draco turned back to the twins after a glance too long at Harry. "And these…pastilles. They work?"
The curtain whipped open, and a three people came rushing in. He recognised Weasley, Granger and a middle-aged woman he assumed was Ronald's mother. Draco immediately scrambled up the bed next to Harry, almost dislodging the food on to the floor. He wouldn't get hexed if he was next to Harry, would he? Merlin, he was so
Suddenly, Umbridge shot up out of her chair, hands braced on her desk. “Mr Potter, you may be excused. We’re done here.”
“Goodnight, Ron.” Harry called out.
After a moment of the entire class just staring at her, she sealed the letter and sent it Draco’s direction with a wave of her wand. He caught it quickly.
“Of course.” He said coolly. “Father’s been well. He’s very busy these days with...Ministry things.”
A rough knock sounded at the door using the steel black knocker.
"Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him closely. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.”
"I never intended to join the Order, I just ended up doing it because of Harry."
"Sirius?" Harry asked tentatively. The man didn’t stop pacing, and Harry and Draco shared an uneasy look. Draco looked back at Sirius and sharply cleared his throat, causing the him to finally look up.
"Stop saying sorry." Malfoy said, and it sounded sharper than Harry expected, and he turned his head to him quickly.
"Yes Si- Yes. Thank you." Draco stuttered. "I won't…I won't be like him. I've stopped being like that. It isn't me."
. The boy clutched his jumper tightly, and Draco stood there next to his bed for a long time until the cries lessened in to sniffles, and Harry's grip on him loosened.
“I have quite a sweet tooth at times.” Draco explained. “She spoils me.”
"That sounds daunting." Hermione remarked from where she was dusting an old shelf.
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
"Don't move. You're hurt." Harry whispered to him. Draco's head looked up, eyes shining on his tear streaked face.
"Erm, day after the task."
Draco felt his cheeks burn, and could tell he was flushing horribly. "I didn't really- It was just I got captured-"
-o-o-
"Fine." Harry huffed, then muttered under his breath, "Bloody Slytherins."
"I forgot to tell you." Harry's grip on his shoulder tightened. "I'm sorry. "
In his mind's eye, the flash of green light kept replaying over and over. The room only got colder, and he felt the darkness closing in.
"Madam Pomfrey will give you your last round of potions, then you will go back to your dormitory. Classes are suspended until further notice, and it is early enough that no one will notice your disappearance." Snape said, treating Draco with the same cold disparity he did with any other student. "Do not speak of your involvement to a soul, and you will stay in the Dungeons until students may leave Hogwarts."
Ron followed him without a word, then without a word patched up his hand like the day before. Harry let him, his chest warm at the trouble that Ron was going to just for him. He also felt slightly guilty, remembering how the boy had covered for him during breakfast.
"Bit cheery this morning, aren't we?" Molly said teasingly, and Sirius threw himself in to a chair, bobbing his teabag with a waving finger.
. Let him sort it out. Try and be
"For being…like this." Harry said between heaves of his chest. He hated the way his voice sounded. It was small, too quiet and something he hadn't heard in a while.
"We'll all die, but I won't because of him, alright? Not anytime soon. If I believe that, it might just be true."
"You've gone through enough, all of you. Draco's still got far more a journey to go." Remus waved him off. "What you should focus on now is school, and helping Draco with his role. Keep him safe, and you're doing more than enough for the Order."
"Because it's something he should know." Sirius said righteously, then at Harry's expression added with a wave of his hand, "And I can't keep it from him. He'll find out soon enough."
Ron grunted in frustration and slapped his forehead with his palm.
Harry stayed silent for a moment, his face immediately dispelling itself on any prior carefreeness. "I try not to think about it." He looked away from Draco.
Draco rubbed his forehead tiredly, letting out a long exhale. This year was going to be the death of him.
“But-”
“Shut it, Malfoy.” Harry grumbled, whipping out his wand and pausing with it over the paper. “Erm, spell?” He asked tentatively.
And that was how Draco found himself trudging back to his dormitory, barely limping but still feeling an extra chill he knows isn't really there. It was like his nerves were all heightened in sensitivity, and the thought of someone else brushing against his skin made him shiver. The scratch of his clothes  alone was almost too much for him.
hex or seriously maim Draco. By the Lake they talked, the whole conversation being a blur to Draco except the few parts Potter had spoken about muggles and…muggleborns? Yes, they argued about that for a bit. Then Draco's father came up and…his stomach churned as he remembered Potter's words about his Father, of what he did in second year. Draco truly had no idea what had happened. As far as thing like that went, his father kept him the dark.
Blaise snorted amusedly, and Draco continued, "Then somehow…we got on to talking - no, arguing about bloody muggleborns!" He exclaimed, the memories finally coming back to him.
"Well it was rather what I did, really." Harry said, "I realised he really was telling the truth and he had no idea what his actions were capable of. So I asked him for a truce between us, and he agreed."
He glanced at the couples ahead and saw Fleur with someone from Hufflepuff stride on to the dance floor, all grace and flowing ivory robes. To Harry's amusement, he noticed that Fleur and Malfoy's robes looked jarringly similar, save for Fleur's shimmering translucent scarf wrapped around her and majority of her body, dancing behind her as she glided over the floor. Malfoy seemed to have noticed as well, judging by the slight downturn of the corners of his mouth, and Harry barely suppressed a grin.
"Harry, go!" Draco hissed at him, not looking back from Moody. Harry didn't quite understand. Draco wanted him to leave? Harry didn't want to leave. Would that mean Draco would have to die?
Harry swallowed, a lump in his throat. Indignation fired inside of him, but he just said, “Nothing.”
"Harry…I'm not sure if it's the shock of it, but I'm not even angry yet." Ron started uncertainly.  "I just…I need to understand. We were leaving the Great Hall, Malfoy started his rounds with you and then…I don't even know what happened. What happened, Harry?" He asked weakly. Harry was honestly surprised Ron wasn't kicking him yet. He was lucky that was the case because Hermione wasn't here to help him if he did.
"Nice try, Draco." Snape snapped, setting down his stirring rod and pinning Draco with a steely look. "I'm still coming to terms with your…decision. I don't believe you and the Potter boy decided to put away your differences, so I'm stumped as to why you let yourself be…swept away by him."
"No! I won't do it! Let go of me, Weasley!"
"Where is it?" Ron asked, and Harry grinned.
That snapped Draco back to reality. He tore his eyes away quickly, clearing his throat. "'M fine. No flying."
"Alright, alright! I'll get straight in to it." Malfoy assured hastily, Harry seeing something almost like fear on his face. He settled back down on his spot, crossing his legs. "I want you to know that I'm…sorry."
He checked his watch, a cracked, faded thing he'd found under the bed in Dudley's second bedroom in Second Year.
But Draco was already looking at Granger, "What's all this about?" He asked curtly.
"So what does this mean?" Harry hissed, not understanding. Malfoy drew his knees up to rest under his chin. It was silent for a few moments.
"It was my fathers." Harry said softly, feeling the same tightness in his chest he felt whenever he realised the Cloak had been used by his father as well. His father and Professor Lupin and Sirius and…Pettigrew.
They parted ways as they drew nearer to the Great Hall, Harry gesturing for Draco to go in first so they wouldn't show up at the same time. Draco nodded goodbye, and made his way inside, making sure to look extra smug for someone who had just taken their rival to their Head of House’s office.
“Is he alright?” A hushed voice said - Dean’s.
Draco nodded, "It's today. Now get ready, you leave in thirty."
Draco's skin erupted in goosebumps as he remembered the words from his father. He couldn't let that happen, no matter what.
Harry laughed even though Draco hadn't purposely made a joke.
“Excuse me?” he replied, maybe a little too harshly.
Ron snorted, leaning back on his arms. “Aren’t you two on a truce or something?”
But Draco had a plan. He wasn't a Slytherin for nothing, and a little Gryffindor influence couldn't do much damage. All he needed to do was retrieve something from his trunk by his bed.
Draco glanced at his mother, who was plastering a congenial smile on her face as she stared at Ms. Zabini and the new fly in her web.
Then, for some insane reason, Potter offered him a bloody
"Are you…better now?" Draco asked tentatively. "Not better, necessarily, but just not…yelling?"
Harry glanced at him amusedly, "Do I wanna know?"
"Alastor Moody?" Blaise pondered for a moment. They were both sitting in front of the fire, Draco in the same chair he'd envisioned during the walk there. It was just them and a few others, Pansy having gone to bed not long before. "There's not much anything else to him except going a little mad from being an Auror. He's apparently good one too - or was. He could be round the bend by now. He really doesn't seem right anymore, to be honest."
Once outside, he shivered slightly at the cool night air. He didn’t realise that winter was approaching once again, and only had a thin jumper to combat the chill. The moon was nowhere to be seen that night, which meant he needed to cast a
Harry's hands instinctively went to his head in shock, "

"Worried about
Draco had said that Umbridge might become suspicious of her father, but on what grounds? The woman had no real reason to suspect such a man - especially one who supported the Ministry so much - unless she suspected him of being the one thing he was guilty for that nobody else believed in; Umbridge believed, to some extent, that Voldemort’s side was rising once again.
He stumbled backwards a bit. Briefly, his eyes caught sight of the clock on the wall behind Umbridge, who was sitting ramrod straight in her seat as if prepared against an attack. It was only seven in the evening, but he was almost always kept until half-ten at least.
They led the First Years down to the Slytherin Dungeons, explaining its location and secrecy, how for years it’s been sacred to Slytherins and could be seen as a safe place for any needing refuge.
When he got back to Hogwarts for Fourth Year, he was more sure of himself. He still hated Potter, though, and didn't hesitate to let him know of the fact. If it seemed his usual jabs at other muggleborns or non-purebloods didn't have their usual bite, however, no one seemed to bring it to attention. Draco still believed they were lesser, just like his father had told him, but didn't find it in himself to particularly care or act on it. Maybe it was his mother's blood in him that made him complacent, but he found being that little bit honest with himself over summer had healed the wound in his chest just marginally. Muggles were ignorant, and muggleborns may have been corrupting magical society, but Draco just couldn't find a reason to go after them like he did before. He begun to form a mask of cool indifference around himself, and in turn that protected him from the backlash if his Housemates thought he was a sympathiser to the muggles.
happening."
He then proceeded to explain how he had been forced to cast magic against a Dementor attack, and how it resulted in his expulsion from Hogwarts, which had Hermione in near tears.
Blaise shook his head, smiling wanly. "Sure, Draco. The fact of the matter is you don't need to be the heir of Slytherin to be scary. If you haven't noticed, up until a few months ago you've been more of an arsehole than you are now. All I'm saying is you could be a little nicer. The Slytherins are scared of you, end of story."
"I assure you I most definitely will
"Right," Malfoy said, a small twitch in the corner of his mouth that faded as quick as it came, "What I'm trying to say is, I still believe blood purity is important, but I don't believe it's everything. I only consider it as much as I would about someone's grades or reputation. They're never an accurate representation of who a person actually is, and they certainly don't warrant being killed off or tortured. That's quite silly."
Malfoy caught his look and glared, "One word of this outside this conversation and I'll set Lolligo on you."
-o-o-
"Fuck you." Harry hissed, angry for some reason he didn't care to analyse. Who was Draco to dictate where he should go? He could protect himself. Hadn't he been doing so for the last three years?
"I'm sixty-eight percent sure." Draco said, to which Harry blew a short breath. Draco smoothed down the fabric over Harry's shoulders, letting his hands fall down the sleeves, hands skittering the fabric lightly until they were back at his sides. "Perks of being famous."
"It's my spot." He reminded Draco, yawning. "Get the fuck away from me."
"I do not like the style! And they both know I'm pants at cutting charms, so checkmate. They'll know it was you." Harry said, crossing his arms. Draco's smile wavered, and he stared at Harry with wide eyes.
drawing and labelling a bloody plant."
"I'm sure, Harry." Draco glanced at his watch. "Now you need to get up, or Arthur will be late. You have a hearing later, I hope you remember."
"Yeah, Harry, If you were a

were the one's father that got Hermione petrified-"
"Yeah, I'll get there. Pettigrew, Sirius, Remus Lupin and my father were all friends at school."
But nothing of the sort came his way.
Draco snorted sarcastically, and Snape tutted disapprovingly.
Harry stepped away reluctantly, fists still tight and looked at the Lake to avoid Malfoys stupid face making him angrier. He mentally clapped himself on the back for making the noble decision in defusing the situation before it got out of hand. Hermione would have been proud. Ron would have not. Speaking with his voice tight, fighting the overwhelming urge to scream and punch the boy next to him, he bit out, "Don't talk about them like that. You have
“I agree,” Lancaster said proudly.
Nott lifted a shaky hand and begun to count as Blaise tauntingly encouraged him.
“M’ fine,” he said again, bracing his forehead on one of his arms on the side of the sink. He stayed like that, catching his breath. Luckily, the heaving had stopped for now.
"It didn't come up, and neither directly asked, so I didn't have to tell them. Do you think I should?"
He shot a regretful look at Ron, then left hurriedly. He’d just reached the doors of the Great Hall, ignoring the many whispers that followed, when he was met with another full-body collision as he reared a corner.
"That's what I tried to say!" Hermione cried, Ron nodding furiously next to her.
“Think about it, Harry. It would help the Order-”
Draco thought for a moment, tapping his finger erratically on his leg. "Well, Dumbledore seems to think I'm some sort of…mole, for him." He admitted.
Even thought there was no possible way she would be able to. Judging from her gaze, however, Harry had the good mind to think she had found a way to crawl in to his mind and uncover all his secrets.
Draco pulled his head up tiredly. "Enough of this. Please." He said in defeat. "We're not going down that road." The idea of Ronald finding his mum attractive wasn't something he wanted to think about. Ever.
"What?" Draco looked at him in surprise. "Oh, sure. What is it?"
Harry instinctively recoiled, bringing his hand to his chest, “What? No-”
Lancaster, over the moon that his new wife’s son was showing an interest in his work, mainly maintained his attention on Blaise the past thirty minutes they’d been there. This worked well enough for Draco, who reached over to pour himself more tea into his cup as Blaise nodded his head every two seconds and scribbled periodic notes on a notepad while the man spoke.
And Harry popped open the vial.
"If you're trying to get me to talk, bringing up that argument will not gain you any favours." Draco narrowed his eyes at the man. "And I've already said it, I don't want any part of whatever this is gonna be!"
Harry sat up quickly on his elbows, "Draco, you can't be up-"
"He'll live." Harry said. "There shouldn't be any lasting damage. Just give him some chocolate-"
"You're not fooling me, Harry." Draco said, and his voice was sharp and cold.
He narrowed his eyes at the woman, but she was already turning back to the work she was doing before he entered. It seemed to be marking essays, but he couldn’t be sure from the angle.
"Not a word, Theo." Draco warned, sitting back down and ignoring Blaise's snigger when his feet got tangled up in the blanket. Theo just continued to his bed as if he saw the same thing everyday, which was almost true, but Draco wasn't going to admit that.
The day after the Ball, Harry had sat down with Ron and Hermione in the Common Room while everyone else was at breakfast. Harry sat on the floor in front of the fire and Ron and Hermione were up on the couch in front of him. He spent a good ten minutes trying to get Hermione to comprehend the fact that he went to the Ball with Malfoy willingly.
Most of the students had discarded their robes for the lesson, and were leant over their potions that gave no help in dispelling the heat. Harry puffed his shirt out to air it out and quickly rolled up his sleeves to his elbows. It was Ron's turn to stir the potion, and the boy was almost wheezing over the cauldron.
A hand on his shoulder - Remus's. "He'll be fine."
Lancaster was biting a new one into his lips, looking slightly agitated. It was probably just the serum working against him, but he also had a resentful, bitter glint in his eyes that was completely his own.  “Level Two is where they keep the stuff that’s meant to be
Draco coughed when the woman pulled back, feeling all the attention on him, "Er, It was nothing. We're both alive now and that's good. Uh…and…" He paused, his mouth suddenly dry. "I'm sorry for how I have offended your family and antagonized after your…
"I don't know, Hermione. He said I practically forced him to. Must be some Slytherin power play or something."
Harry nodded, "Especially after what happened at the World Cup, he's gathering strength now. Supporters and the like - Death Eaters. Your father is probably one of them." Harry said, peering at Malfoy for his reaction. The boy said nothing, staring at his hands clasped together in his lap.
"I thought you were against involving them." Sirius said, leaning forward. "They're underage. Not even in the Order-"
Thanks for reading you gremlins. Stay safe <3
"Malfoy." Harry said, sitting down as the boy looked up from his work. "Homework?"
"The law's on your side." He said quietly. "It was self defense. Tell them that, and you'll be fine."
Potter scoffed, "I am not!"
"Surprised you didn't take a swing at him." Ron interrupted bluntly. Harry snorted, looking sidelong at his best friend.
Harry, for the first time in a while, smiled brightly. "They cleared me!" He said jovially, eyes alight, "Charges were dropped." He sounded if a massive weight was taken off his chest, his hands squeezing Draco's arm in the process.
Swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, he rubbed his eyes and glanced at the window. Outside was the street they'd arrived in prior that day. It was empty except for a naked black tree with jutting branches and a few ravens sitting neatly on them. He shuddered at the eerie sight, before heaving himself up with a groan. His bad knee singed in protest, but he ignored it.
"Is she Slytherin, at least?" Draco asked curiously.
then." He said with what Draco could only describe as a
"You stupid boy." Was the first thing the man said to him. Draco did his best not to roll his eyes.
"Uh…Yes." Draco admitted. "I just wanted to ask if you'll be alright…going back home for the summer."
"Fine." Ron grumbled. "I don't get it, but fine."
Harry smirked, jostling Ron back with a shoulder, "And how much of that stuff you said was Hermione?" He asked.
He turned to the woman quickly. As if on cue, his stomach growled. Smiling kindly, he took a biscuit and sat back, trying not to gobble it down whole.
"Right," Arthur said, checking his watch, "We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll be better off there than hanging around here.”
"No, none of that, dear boy."
“Indeed.” Umbridge nodded, “And if I may ask, what brought about this change of heart, Mr. Potter?”
-o-o-
Draco stared at him for a few moments more before nodding silently and leaving, the compartment door sliding until it was shut. Harry gathered up his Cloak and draped it around himself, stepping out a few minutes after Draco and breezing his way down the hall.
Malfoy sighed, "What makes you think I want something?"
"They think I'm at his estate. I go there every August anyway to go through the Potions syllabus for the coming year."
"What?"
Draco's face formed red roses on his cheeks in embarrassment. "It was nothing." He muttered. "Honestly."
"I'm not here for Harry." Granger said calmly, stepping in to the room.
"What on earth could you be sorry for?" Harry asked with eyes stuck on Draco's, which were the most stunning shade of grey it almost made him angry with misunderstanding of how it could wantonly be so.
Snape cleared his throat. Draco glanced at the clock. It had ticked thirty times since the last time Snape had done so. Not too long yet.
(See the end of the chapter for
you to do anything, Malfoy! Trust you to not be able to take responsibility for your actions! Did daddy teach you that trick?" Harry got to his feet, enjoying the outside be damned. Malfoy faced him with his cheeks blooming red in anger.
Harry looked down at the food for a moment, and saw some of it was already in small pieces. Seeing as it was presented just like last time,  he let himself pick one up and start to eat. Malfoy didn't react when he did.
old. Stretching his long legs out in front of him, he felt a dull throb in one of his knees that he'd fucked up somehow in training. The blasted thing had been giving him trouble for a week or so now, and it didn't seem to be going away. Draco shook his head to himself bitterly. Maybe if he got a bloody
He opened them again, and kept them like that until he forgot about the time.
“So Umbridge is just another person, then,” Draco said definitively, just barely keeping the unsettled shake out of his voice. “She can’t do much, if not for the Ministry.”
Harry considered it for a moment, before shaking his head. "Not yet. Let's just wait a bit."
Potter just looked back at the sun, elbows wrapped around his drawn up knees. Draco couldn't see his eyes properly from the reflections of the sunlight in his glasses. "I couldn't sleep." The boy said frankly, and Draco wondered if he was still moody from his unconfirmed fight with Weasley and Granger.
"You should know that, Malfoy."
He wrote at the end of the letter, and sent it away with another stroke of Hedwig's snowy coat. She disappeared in to the darkness, and he noticed the moon was full that night. It reminded him of that first night of the Yule Ball when everything had changed. It wasn't full back then, but it seemed just as bright.
Draco gulped, his mouth dry.
He told his unmoving body. His mind willed it to move, to get off the bed and face the danger, but it stayed stubbornly still. The shadows closed in slowly and the room dropped several degrees. His mind wanted to move, but his body didn't comply.
Harry let Malfoy prattle on about all the possible double meanings of the clue, wishing he was Hermione so he could actually counter the boy's suggestions.
"You look too far ahead, Draco." The man said, still infuriatingly calm. "You will merely do as you have been doing these past few months, which is acting accordingly."
He came back to himself, realising there had been a pause of silence after he’d stopped talking, and everyone, including Pansy, were peering at him curiously.
Arthur was still currently at the Ministry with Harry, and the hearing was set to start any minute now, both having gone there early. He wondered how Harry was doing. The boy was probably worrying himself ragged…
by Wilbert Slinkhard." He heard Draco mutter distastefully.
He stared at the reflection, studying himself as if for the first time. Then quietly and as softly as the hiss of a snake, he whispered for the second time that evening, “
. These little problems with the lower levels...they’re non-issues, clear? Nothing to worry about.”
"Come in."
"Then they asked me questions about me, mostly. Things I expected, really. What I'd been doing over the summer, what my father's been doing, anything suspicious and anything I've learned."
Draco snorted, remembering the day before when half of the Defense class had rioted against Umbridge’s idealised curriculum. It would have been more amusing if Harry hadn’t landed himself in detention. That boy right there was another problem in and of itself.
"Yes, in fact. A few times in my dorms. Scared the bloody shit out of me."
Harry stared at him for a long time, "Has this been done before?" He asked.
"What? Why am I just sitting here waiting for you guys?" Harry cried, rushing up and starting to run towards the Portrait. "See you guys later!" He checked his watch, cursing when he saw he had only a few minutes left before the food disappeared.
"I'm sure Granger can help you with that."
"Merlin and Morgana! Why on earth would he ask
"Bloody tell me then, you knob! That's what normal people do! They don't do it for others!"
"Look." Draco said calmly, "It's for me, alright? I don't know why you-"
"Not used to lots like ours, isn't it?" Bill said with a rueful smile.
"Snape's got points to take off of me, so let's hurry!" He called out behind him, and was promptly followed by Ron and Hermione, whom were very confused indeed.
“I’m glad you think so, Malfoy.” Harry’s owl flapped her wings agitatedly on his arm, to which he soothed her with a few strokes and uttered encouragement. After a moment, he looked back at Draco, the corner of his mouth turning upwards. “Now are you done gawking? I’m sure you didn’t just come here to admire my looks.”
Harry almost smiled at that.
"Eighth." Blaise sighed. "Got hitched over the summer. Bloke had to stand on a
“You’re just denying the truth, Professor,” Harry said, voice now low and cold. “How else would I know about the Ministry? About Malfoy?”
"Right." Harry said, dumbfounded.
“I knew it!” He heard Ronald yell. “You always get away with stuff!” Voices spoke over each other, all of them mixing together by the time their sounds reached the kitchen, and Draco just slumped back in the chair with a sigh.
"Harry…" He heard after a while, when the clock had long struck three in the morning.
"It could be Wormtail." Harry said, having mentioned him earlier. Malfoy nodded, deep in thought again.  Seeing Harry's yawn, he checked his watch and gasped.
"Around as long as you've been wearing red as if it suited your freckled face." Draco retorted.
"You've gotten on pretty well this far."
"No, mate. It's okay. I understand. It's like being back at the Burrow." He siphoned their questionably coloured potion in to a vial, "I love my brothers and Ginny, and Mum and Dad," He said, "But living with them sometimes drives me up the bloody walls. Especially when Percy comes to visit. It doesn't mean I still don't love them - even Percy. I just can't be around them all the time." He put a stopper on the vial and held it out to Harry to carry to Snape's desk, where the man himself was looming. "So I get it. Okay?"
"Oi!" Harry hissed from the outside, head peaking from around the sides of the doorframe. Draco didn't dare turn his back to the creature, now that he'd gotten it's attention. "Go on!"
McGonagall leant back on her chair, thinking for a moment, before bringing forward a tartan of biscuits on her desk.
"How?" Harry asked skeptically. "I heard you giving them some rough ultimatums. Involve me or expect your silence and lack of cooperation? No offense, but what makes you think you have that sort of power?"
“I’m not saying we should.” Draco snapped angrily, “But we can’t exactly let him get whatever it is, especially if it’s for Voldemort.”
"They will." Draco reached out, straightening Harry's t-shirt over his shoulders and smoothing down a few stray wrinkles in the fabric. "You're Harry Potter. They can't afford to just expel you."
, which he needs so he can
A few heads turned to their table in the corner of the room, which he wouldn’t have given a toss about if not for the fact that he and Pansy were in the
"Harry Potter is tied in first place with Cedric Diggory!" The sonorous rumbled after the points were calculated, and Draco couldn't help but clap along with everyone else, restraining from the chants and hollers from other houses along with the rest of the Slytherin's.
“What? You can’t let her get away with this!”
“Weasley.”
On that note, Harry grabbed the egg, his shower kit and the Invisibility Cloak and left the room. He came back a moment later, took out the Marauders Map out of his trunk, and left for real.
Then, there it was. That blasted bloody bird. His doom.
Harry responded by nodding and ripping off his glasses, running a hand down his face with a long exhale. Draco had nothing he knew he could say, so he didn’t, instead waiting silently as Harry collected himself.
When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. She seemed to be marking something down despite the school year not having even started long enough to provide any actual work to mark. Approaching the desk with Pansy, he restrained the urge to crane his neck to see what she was so busy with.
Right, he didn’t need all that. He skipped some more paragraphs until a certain few words caught his eye.
"But…" Harry said, irritation boiling from within him. "I don't want to be doing nothing at all!"
Draco sighed at that, slumping back in his chair, "It's going to be long, I just know it. Any meeting with Snape is bound to be hours long."
It was like his entire body had ice water dunked over it. He could feel the tremors starting in his legs, and his hand twitched over the wand holster on his other arm.
“Shit, Pans, let's round up the little brats.” Draco hastily got out of his seat, choking down one last mouthful of juice down his throat as Pansy followed.
Draco turned his head back to the outside, where people were now sparse having filed in to the train to leave. He swallowed. "I'm not sure what you mean." He said lightly, but Blaise's smug shrug conveyed the boy knew more than he should have. Draco didn't know how, but Blaise's hunches about him were always a bit too accurate.
“That’s no way to talk to your future fa-” Draco started before he received a harsh jab in the stomach. “-Ow!”
The last time Harry had mentioned him, it wasn’t particularly in good taste.
"Of course I will." Harry said surely. "Ron, too."
“The sheer amount of audacity you have is astounding.” The firelight danced off the side of Blaise’s face, flames licking out the fireplace as if they were reaching out to the two of them in the dark, unlit room. Through the windows, the Lake water was a complete, opaque black. He was sitting in his usual black velvet chair, and Draco was stationed across from him on a twin of its kind.
“What?” Harry blurted. “What about me?”
“Later as in after dinner tonight,
He closed his eyes. Harry
Draco couldn't help but snort. "I'd appreciate it if you never apologised to me ever again after all the things I've done to you." He said bitterly, turning and pretending to look through his bag some more just so he had something to do with his hands. "Now are we done here?"
Draco quite honestly didn't know what the appropriate response to such a blunt statement was. He decided to settle for a slight smirk and smug tone as he said, "That's very good to hear."
Draco seemed to choke on air, falling into a coughing fit. “I’m really...I...Thank you…” He bit out between coughs. Harry just narrowed his eyes at him, but pat him on the back all the same.
He had done it without thinking… He had just one goal in mind, which was to trick her...To make her think that he was…
"Why?" He asked, inspecting the weight of the wand in his hand. It didn't feel that strange in his palm, but it definitely had a different thrum of energy to his own.
"No! Of all the bloody forsaken people out there, you had to pick that hag?"
"Sugar?"
And Merlin, it was only the first
"Well I wouldn't have anything to say about it. Slytherin, remember? It's sort of an unspoken rule that you don't be so…expressive and emotional." Draco said thoughtfully, "Especially in a Pureblood environment like that. I'm lucky I found good friends like Pansy and Blaise, but it's still tit for tat kinds of relationships. We can tell each other stuff, but doing things for each other is a different story. There's always an extent to where companionship goes. It's all very conditional there."
. But yes, dreadful covers some of it. I guess most of it is my fault. I went ahead and asked you to the bloody Ball, but only because I thought you wouldn't agree. The rest of the blame goes to you, however, for doing the honours."
"Better get down there." Ronald said regretfully. Granger and Ginevra fell in to step as Ronald lead the way out the door, Draco still sticking next to Harry's side at the far end.
behind him, Harry set off with his trunk and Hedwig hooting irritably in her cage. The moon was low in the sky, but it was full enough to give him enough light to see the prim street of Privet Drive. He considered casting a shrinking charm on his things, but decided not to risk it in case the Trace would track him further. He didn't think he could do it without a wand, either. From the strong Patronus' he'd cast, along with the other wandless spells, he was tired beyond belief. His legs dragged slightly behind him as he trudged along the pavement.
"We can't have help."
all of this?) was asking questions.
"Exactly. It's like I can speak freely here but not with my own friends. How sad is that?"
"You what?" Harry snapped.
"No problem." Bill narrowed his eyes at him as if amused, "Are you alright?"
"He annoys me." Ron said bluntly, and Harry laughed again. "It was already a lot that you were friends, and I was able to trust who he was to a certain degree after I heard about the last task, but all of this is becoming a lot to handle from him."
Harry grunted noncommittally, finally coming to sit down next to Draco.
Umbridge said nothing, her mouth slightly open and smile completely wiped away.
"Soon." The man replied. "He is still weak, but none more than before."
That was how Ron found him barely even a few minutes later, rushing in with his quidditch gear still strapped on and looking flushed and wind-blown.
"Where?" Draco asked.
"Start what?" Draco muttered distastefully.
" Ron exclaimed, "Harry you
(See the end of the chapter for
"We're friends." He bit out. "Least I can do."
" Draco shouted, "You left me when your mark started to
"Draco has a point, though, Harry." Hermione said. "It would be best if you laid low this year, especially with You-Know-Who out there."
Mallory Lancaster was, as Draco thought, a sad, spineless little man. All Draco and Blaise had to do was sit down for some tea, give enough of a shit about the archives long enough to convince the man they really were there for a school project and then they set their plan in motion.
“Oh…” Pansy said, seemingly at a loss for words. He didn’t bother to confirm whether she was suspicious of his sudden departure, instead throwing her a quick smile over his shoulder as he hurried out the Library (not going unnoticed by Madam Pince, whose glare he felt in the back of his neck as he stepped out the doors).
"Do you have something to tell me, Harry?" She asked once, and Harry knew she wouldn't ask again. Merlin, she was bloody
Nausea crept back in.
"Right, whatever. The Fidelius spell I'll have to think about for now. Can you survive like that?" Harry asked curtly. Draco's scowl deepened and he crossed his arms with a huff.
"See Harry, yeah I know." Sirius waved him off, eyes still closed and pinching his nose. "Go on, then. He trusts you for some bloody reason. Merlin, the balls on that boy. It's like James and Lily speaking to me at once. I can't even compete anymore. Look at me now, just listening to a child. I should get Moony to speak some sense in to him…" Sirius rambled with Draco still standing there, unsure what his place was in the man's…triads.
