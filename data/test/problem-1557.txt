It was gone, and he was alive. Draco’s fingertips gently brushed the bruised skin that would never heal properly.
There’s a letter from his mum, who can’t use any of the Malfoy money during her house arrest, and her words warm Draco’s heart. A Christmas card from Longbottom and Lovegood, too. He sets it aside after reading it twice and grabs the second package. The card falls and reveals chicken scratch in blue ink.
“I’m sure she is.” And she was, he knew that. She would even let him live his life without bothering him and would expect the same privacy in exchange. They’d talked about it enough. It would solve everything: they’d produce a child, would love them to the moon and back, raise them together, and they’d never have to touch one another again. But the thought of marrying anyone out of a misplaced and obsolete sense of duty had lost its appeal long ago. He could bet that Astoria shared his opinion. He knew her well: she was part of the tight-knit group of Slytherins who still met regularly since the war, most of them from Draco’s year or below—those who had been at Hogwarts during the war and suffered together. “I still don’t intend on getting married, Mother,” he added.
It was a sturdy little building with a living space that made it look like a tool shed more than a home, and it was cursed with sweltering heat in summer and freezing temperatures in winter. Back in the days, the elves would use magic to regulate the air, but there were no elves left. Draco was on his own, and he was
“I’d have kept your plate under a stasis charm, don’t worry about it.” Malfoy checked the temperature of a wonderful-looking roast in the oven, breathed in, turned around to face Harry and wrung his fingers. “Did you-?”
Malfoy’s cigarette butt falls on the pavement, and a quick wand movement Vanishes it. Then Malfoy puts one foot on the wall and rests his arm on his knee, looking ahead. He might be avoiding Harry’s gaze, who knows. “My friends have questionable tastes in entertainment.”
Draco stepped inside the empty house. He glanced to his left, saw the cupboard and immediately destroyed it, leaving the whole area under the stairs empty. He heard Harry snort and turned around to find him grinning like a loon and looking up at the ceiling.
) influenced by modern adaptations of early medieval feminine fashion. The one he wore today was white with a loose v-shaped neckline, flared sleeves open at the elbow, a gold, embroidered sash left hanging at his waist, and an opening along Draco’s left leg. Harry’s cheeks burned at the sight of Draco’s perfectly shaved skin and bare feet. The git did it on purpose. With his chin-length hair ruffled and slightly curled, and the snake tattoo on his thigh, Malfoy was a sight to behold.
“You kicked my legs and woke me.” Draco threw the cloth to the floor, where it joined the underwear abandoned a few hours earlier. “It wasn’t a dream, anyway. I had to pull you out.”
“We’re doing drills at the moment. Simulations. I- I had a panic attack a few days ago because I had to dodge a fake Killing curse.” Draco tightens his hold on his fingers. “I knew it would happen; I just thought I’d be okay. But it’s too much. I don’t know what to do.”
He brings perfect, gooey brownies to Teddy’s birthday party, welcomed by delighted squeals and a flood of toddler-speak about Pinecone (the Kneazle). He’s fine with visiting, because Andromeda is still grieving. It’s a terrible thing to say, but she’s just like Harry. He feels a connection with her.
The elf appears and peers at him. “Harry Potter needs to drink his tea and get ready for the speech Harry Potter hates to make. Harry Potter can go home afterwards.”
Harry sighed. “If it wasn’t important, you know I’d stay.” Harry was a responsible person who didn’t mind working a few extra hours to fix his own messes, after all. He only worked in the morning unless there was some fieldwork planned, so it didn’t bother him to spend more time at the office. It was
Indeed he was. Harry found him in the kitchen, delicately assembling a sandwich and perusing a Muggle magazine. At the end of the table, Regulus, the cranky Eagle Owl who’d shed feathers everywhere less than a month ago, was fast asleep. Kreacher was in love with the bird and had turned Poor Master Regulus’ bedroom(which was more of a shrine these days) into an owlery as soon as Draco moved in.
Harry figured he might as well respond to Hermione’s latest letter, and he did, happy to use a pen to do so.
“No way. But since you made me wear that stupid Santa hat, you, boss, will take care of Minitree for the season!
The leftovers Molly gave him are in the fridge, his gifts are on the couch. He’s ready to go to bed; he’ll take a shower in the morning, he’s too tired right now. He opens the door to the living room, and his heart misses a beat.
“Obviously, it’s mine! Do you think Mother would send me a Portkey to some sort of backwater Muggle dwelling?”
“I’m not saying it didn’t affect me,” Harry replied with a shrug. It’d given him flashbacks of the cupboard under the stairs. He wanted to tell Draco how touched he was, but he’d always been terrible at talking about his feelings. “Thank you for worrying about me.” He let go of Draco’s wrist and bit his lower lip. “Feels like we need a drink. I’d toast to our life on the road.” Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed like they’d reached a new step in their friendship.
(Image: A cup overflowing with a sugary drink topped with whipped cream and some kind of chocolate or caramel coulis)
Potter shrugged. “You look cold.” Taking a tin out of his pocket and enlarging it, he handed it to Draco. “From Teddy.”
She was on his shoulder now, flapping her wings when Harry moved a bit too fast for her. Hedwig didn’t need a cage or a perch in the compartment. She had her human perch. Harry didn’t mind one bit.
It’s two years later, and Draco has yet to speak a word. He spends time in therapy or in a bed at St Mungo’s. When it gets too awful, and the temptation to cast a cutting curse at his neck becomes overwhelming, there’s always a wave of Harry’s scent bursting under his nose, and he can’t go through with it.
When his consciousness was pulled from the depths of sleep, he wasn’t ready. He woke within a dream and saw the entity staring at him between foggy tombstones, with its many grins and that aura of wrongness. Harry tried to turn away and flee, but the ground had swallowed his feet. The being grew until it towered above him, so high it melted into the black sky. Harry’s scream died in his mouth. Inky drops fell on his skin, and his mind turned numb.
Harry grins, and Draco reaches for the glass of juice, drinking half of it before Harry can stop him. “That was mine,” Harry tells him, eyebrows raised.
There was that, too: Harry’s idiotic, inconvenient crush on both his arch-enemy and a portrait. He’d woken up on the third day with the realisation that he was well and truly gay, had always been, and maybe there was a tiny attraction to women somewhere, but it might just have been his brain trying to fake it. The lack of reaction to full-blooded Veela, or even to Fleur, should have been his first clue.
But something was bothering him. Never one to keep his mouth shut when he wasn’t in the Dursley’s presence, he stomped out his uneasiness and spoke his mind.
Malfoy dips his toes in the water. “Mother brought me here when I was upset. She’d sit in the sand and build castles or dig holes with me because I wanted to see how deep I could go. She never used her wand and didn’t care about dirtying her clothes. She taught me to swim here. I’d always forget why I was sad, or why I had thrown a tantrum.”
Draco won’t discover anything today, though. He’s celebrating the end of his exams at Zabini’s house. Harry was invited, and was almost tempted to join — Blaise has a pool, and Harry wants to swim without getting sand in his trunks. Not to mention, watching Draco interact with his friends is entertaining, because he unleashes the Drama™ he excels at. But Harry is also invited somewhere else, and that’s where he’s going.
With the map in mind, Harry flicked his wand to pack up the spider-free toolkit and finished his tea. He cleaned up and extinguished the fire while Draco disabled the wards and Muggle-repelling charms around the tent. One spell later and their rudimentary habitat was gone, tightly packed in Malfoy’s resized bag. Harry grabbed his backpack, lightened it with a quick charm and made sure Slytherin’s portrait and Noodle were comfortable—Noodle slithered up his arm, hissing in bliss at the heat and confirming that all was well. If a sandstorm found its way through the canyon, at least they’d only lose a cheap Muggle tent and not any of their possessions and friends. They’d been lucky to save them the other day.
“If I buy lemons, I’ll forget them,” Draco says. He wipes his mouth with his napkin. “At some point they’re able to walk on their own.”
. Harry trusted Draco to handle himself. And that simple fact created an explosion of butterflies in his stomach—and the beginning of a strain between his legs.
Then it hit him: he missed Harry. He’d been gone for two hours, and already, loneliness threatened to swallow him whole.
There was a rustling as if a gust of wind was travelling through the plants around the cottage at high speed, and suddenly every vine twisting around the fence and the walls of the cottage shot towards the intruders. Hestia’s eyes rolled in their socket, and she dropped to the ground like a puppet without strings. Smith let out a high-pitched scream, and he and his goons attempted to destroy the plants, but they were relentless.
“Nobody is coming over unannounced with those wards,” Harry tells him, shooing him away as Draco grabs the spatula to taste Harry’s bolognese sauce.
Draco's stomach grumbled in agreement. "Great, I'll be right back." He grabbed his "Muggle World Only" shoulder-bag and a warm coat, aware that he was still dressed for East-African weather, and Apparated quietly to St. Mary's road in Ealing. There was no way he'd get subpar pizza from one of those overpriced, low-quality chains. He'd get authentic, wood-fired Italian goodness from the very best. The owners knew him, not as Draco Malfoy, ex-Pureblood supremacist, but as a regular customer who was polite and charming. As expected, they were delighted to see him again, a stark contrast with the judgemental reactions he still provoked in the wizarding world.
When Harry goes home, exhausted, eyes scratchy and belly still too full of food, night has fallen. He wasn’t the first to leave; Fleur and Bill took their baby home a few hours ago, Andromeda carried Teddy through the Floo, then Dean, Seamus, Luna and Ginny were next. Harry’s escape inside the house went mostly unnoticed, or no one mentioned it. They all had fun, Hermione said, and it helped take away some of his guilt. He found the courage to join the friends who remained longer, but ultimately hid inside again, comforted by another of Molly’s embrace.
took care of his thirst. He then attempted to stand up and winced at the dull pain in his hips. He ruffled through his bag to find a kaftan, selecting a white one to fight the heat of the desert. A few more spells and he was clean, even if magic couldn’t replace a shower. After getting dressed, he rummaged through Draco’s belongings, still looking for his lost sock. This fruitless endeavour had caused a fight the previous evening (Parselmagic did not, in fact, help in finding errant pieces of clothing).
Harry smirked and shook his head. He knew that Draco didn’t mean it; he might not enjoy the heat, but he loved the desert and its otherworldly wonders. He’d fallen in love with it when a curious fennec fox sniffed around their tent, before the sandstorm.
Even if he didn’t want to, Harry stepped forward and put his hand on Hermione’s shoulder. He looked at the other first years and took a deep breath. “I’m really sorry; we’re just excited. We didn’t mean to come in here. We were just looking for a toad.” He then glanced at Hermione, who was finally speechless. “Hermione, right? Nice to meet you. I’m Harry Potter.”
Their hands moved up and down, slow and sweet, and there was more soap, more shampoo—because they forgot they’d already washed up—more kisses, too, and Harry shuddered against Draco’s chest. They stood under the hot stream of water for what felt like many long, blissful minutes. Eyes shut, Draco held him and let himself relax.
Slytherin’s smile turned into a smirk. “Your legendary rival slept late. He was quite worried about you.”
Startled, Harry groaned in discomfort as his back protested last night’s choice of mattress. He sat up and rubbed his eyes, then slid his hand under his pillow to grab his wand. Outside the tent, rapid footsteps accompanied more expletives, and all Harry could think of, was that it was too early to deal with Draco’s sour mood. A quick spell removed the sand from his sleeping bag and the smears from his glasses, and a silent
“I believe we’ve heard your objections,” Croaker eventually cut in, and it reminded Harry that this man had been Draco’s teacher. Not everyone could have handled him and his no-bullshit approach. He was thus more inclined to listen to that man instead of Unspeakable K. “We already have facts. This ties in nicely with my current investigation.” He crossed his fingers and his eyes bore into Harry, who fidgeted under their intensity. “There’s a way for those beings to go in and out of the world in perfect balance, unless cracks start forming. My current job is to find and repair these irregularities.”
Scorpius grows, healthy, smart, cute and happy, and Draco sometimes whispers stories in his ear. Astoria knows he talks to their child and no one else and she lets him. When she gets sick and loses her battle, Draco’s only anchor is Scorpius, who tethers him to reality by merely existing.
He forgot about the crowd around them, about the reactions they might have, and he moved as close as possible, before kissing Draco.
He climbed up the newly built stairs, and his eyes widened. His lips twitched, and he sighed in fond exasperation. Harry was drenched from head to toe, holding a faucet and glaring at the kitchen sink.
He expects something like a scarecrow dressed like Harry, or Mother’s dogs acting silly, but no, what he sees leaves him speechless. It’s a peacock—well, it’s Albert, the oldest and meanest of them all—but it looks like a giant pincushion with a long tail and a neck. The bird is acting like nothing is amiss, pecking at Mother’s hydrangeas, but it has more than two legs. They’re all around its body, sticking out like stiff, thin arms, clawing at nothing—if the peacock were to attempt to roll down a hill, it wouldn’t roll at all, it would just walk.
By sheltering him, Malfoy gave Harry long-lasting protection in a house Harry didn’t despise. Only the strongest entities like the one that had chased him down were still able to harm him; living in that house meant Harry’s existence was shrouded from the weaker ones. But it also allowed Harry to use his ability to see entities to help others, which satisfied his Saviour Complex (which he grudgingly agreed he possessed). While Harry did run errands, he only did it because—well, because that was kind of what a couple did for each other.
He pictures him standing by his side. It’s so vivid he can feel the ghost of his hand on the small of his back. He feeds off the sensation, and his mood swing doesn’t impact him as much as it could have. Hermione clings to him, and he focuses on his thoughts because he’s edging towards a meltdown.
“Okay, first off, you’ve been out of it since last weekend. You missed a weird meeting yesterday; apparently, Gwenog Jones is threatening to sue if we ever mention the zit she has on her nose. And, you didn’t wish me good luck with my try-outs.” She poked his shoulder with her index finger, and Draco winced. “But none of that matters, because your neck looks like you were attacked by leeches, and I need to know.”
“So, I told her, you see, lady, magic has a will of its own, and I had nothing to do with the tree that burst through the bedroom floor!”
“You bribed my godson,” Harry grumbled, itching to draw his wand and cast a Drying Charm. The wand movement couldn’t be done in a crowd of Muggles, it wasn’t discrete in the slightest.
They get detention for being out of their dorms past curfew and Draco is outraged: it’s his first detention since the Forbidden Forest adventure in first year (any detention in sixth year does not count. Extenuating circumstances). Harry just finds it funny.
It’s the worship, the awed whispers, the giggles. It’s so inappropriate. Harry is on display, most of the spectators are not here for the fallen, but to gawk at him and ask for autographs. It’s disgusting and insulting. Someone shouts “Cute bum”, and while many turn around with a disapproving frown, others laugh or whistle. Harry glances at McGonagall, whose lips are pinched, and at Hermione, who looks sick. Ron’s complexion turns waxy. Harry is holding his wand to his throat, ready to cast Sonorus, when someone shoots bright green fireworks.
Draco), but he didn’t initiate it. For him, it felt good, but he didn’t crave it. Draco didn’t care about any of that. As long as Harry was comfortable with him and didn’t force himself, all was well. A silk ribbon around his wrists and the occasional blindfold were some of Draco’s favourite accessories, and they didn’t push too many boundaries. Draco’s filthiest desire, however, was worth leaving a glass of Superior Red behind, but he’d ensure Potter was fully on-board with it beforehand.
“Oh?” Draco tilted his head. “I’m afraid stories are only acceptable when little boys are going to sleep.”
Harry twists his head so fast he gives himself whiplash and forgets all about the pain at the sight of Loki. Well, it could be another crow, but really, that’s too much of a coincidence. The bird taps on the glass, insistent, its beady eyes locked on Harry. He flies straight at him when Hermione opens the window, and drops a piece of parchment in Harry’s lap.
Harry tightened his hold on the quill. “So, they’ll just find another way in a few months. Is there anything else I can do?”
And Potter, as a noble Gryffindor, didn’t mock Draco’s weak Transfiguration abilities. “Show me around? I want to get a feel of the place.”
Harry’s smile grew, and he moved a bit to give Ron some space. His best friend ranted about Robards giving him a last-minute report to fill when he’d already worked since four in the morning, and Harry congratulated himself on quitting the Aurors.
The snow crunched under their feet thanks to a weather-controlling spell, something many ancient families used on their lands to give them an enchanting look when the grass and flowers died. Given the geographical location of Wiltshire, there was no way snow would hold until spring each year. There was also a tiny little detail that made the spell quite annoying: once it was cast, it stayed there. Nobody, Unspeakable or Charm Master, had been able to dismantle one. Even when it malfunctioned, it always repaired itself. Malfoy Manor was thus blessed by pure white snow and freezing temperatures from late November to March, even if the temperature outside of the wards soared. Very inconvenient for Draco at the moment.
It was where the small sailing boat and the gondola were stored, but also where their human warden, a Squib who’d been killed by the Dark Lord, had been living. He’d taken care of the plants around the property for as long as Draco could remember. He’d also been civil when Draco had shown him nothing but disdain and had messed around the boathouse to annoy him.
). He was also like a magpie collecting shiny objects: there was a display case in his living room with old trinkets that Draco had once seen on Dumbledore’s desk. But his most annoying trait, the one Draco would never understand, was sending Kreacher on holidays twice a year, likely seeking the Granger Seal of Approval. Draco knew it’d be a heated topic when he moved in, but he had given up arguing about it.
While he thought about the possibilities of working with curses, he also practised with Malfoy. He knew surprisingly few Defence spells and even fewer hexes and curses. Maybe something wasn’t quite up to par with the Hogwarts curriculum, because even going through a war didn’t give him much to work with.
Sirius and Little Harry were thick as thieves. The ex-convict could sometimes appear childish, but Draco’s fears on that side had been settled when he’d heard him convince the child that attempting to become an Animagus before he was at least thirteen was idiotic. Knowing that his adult self could turn into a snake had created a slight obsession that Sirius had successfully dampened, for now.
“Huh. Goldstein will be glad.” Then Harry grimaced, remembering last December. “Please tell me we’re not getting a real tree.” The fallen needles had been a pain to get rid of. Someone had enchanted them so they wouldn’t be affected by magic.
Teddy loves the place because it’s Harry’s, and kids have an odd fascination with their beloved family members’ belongings. Harry turned the smaller room into a kid’s paradise, with toys everywhere, and he bought movies Andromeda would approve of. They’ve watched
“I’ll tell you all about her and Dad, but let’s do things in the right order. Do you want to call me Cousin Harry? Or Uncle?” Both grimaced at the same time. “No, that’s like being Dudley or Vernon. Call me Jim.”
Hermione giggled and unrolled a parchment that she instantly covered in notes, agreeing with Draco and finding this use of numbers odd yet fascinating. Harry tuned them out, content enough with their presence. He left his seat and kneeled by the fire, stroking Noodle’s spine, sometimes taking a sip of his tea or a biscuit. He kept glancing at Draco, appreciating how he moved his hands when his enthusiasm grew. Draco was such an expressive man; Harry could watch him for hours. In fact, he may well have done that, because the kettle was empty, the biscuits gone and the light outside had dimmed by the time Hermione’s delighted squeal startled him. He’d probably dozed off. Portkey travel was exhausting, after all.
And Potter didn’t mind having the Slytherin Team hanging on his wall. Anyone else would have kept the other three and burnt that one.
Draco holds him close, then pushes him onto the sofa and climbs onto his lap. Harry is so hard he can’t stop the pitiful whine at the back of his throat as Draco sits on his thighs. He catches his lips once more. The kiss is no longer sweet and soft. His hands slide under Draco’s linen shirt and explore the expanse of his back, but that’s where his confidence falters, and Harry is happy to let Draco take the lead.
Then he winced. There’d be no hiding his romance novels from Potter if they shared the same bookshelf. But since Harry’s antics helped Draco cope with difficult days, living together couldn’t possibly be a bad thing. He’d even forgotten to give detention to the students responsible for turning his classroom into a toxic wasteland.
"Her Patronus is a dragon." He tried to remember what her wand was, as she's gotten a new one after the war. A memory of a trip to a French wandmaker came to mind—vine and dragon heartstring.
It’s Mother who decides to take him home, to where she’s living now, in the South of France. It’s a castle rising above lavender fields and a vineyard, and it doesn’t remind him of Harry at every corner. Draco eats little and sleeps his days away, locked in dreams where he’s laughing in Harry arms, where Harry brings him flowers and where they race on their brooms until they reach the sun.
As for Draco, he lived to see Harry’s smile, so he didn’t mind the ache in his chest when he was deep in thoughts. It would go away eventually.
down Harry’s spine. Who could read a book for six hours without moving a muscle. Who only drank high-quality Earl Grey and called anyone who preferred teabags over loose leaf “heathens”. Malfoy, who ate sweets all day long, was brilliant at Quidditch, always dressed like a prince and walked like a king. Who cut Harry’s potions ingredients properly under the pretence of refusing to get anything but an ‘O’, but not necessarily realising that Harry wasn’t even his partner for that lesson - well, Malfoy.
Draco had no clue, but wouldn’t admit it out loud. “Yes. Probably.” He stared at the pictures. “Let’s go with that.
Potter glanced away from him, nodded at someone Draco couldn’t see, then looked back at him with a crooked smile. “Ron says you need to fuck off. So, what’s up?”
When they reach Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, Draco flinches and immediately feels guilty at the horror on Harry’s face.
Harry jumped aside to let the mountain of fabric zoom past him and throw itself at Draco, pushing him hard enough that he fell on the floor, all tangled up. Harry couldn’t help it and snorted loudly, then helped his sputtering boyfriend and carried the blankets to the sofa. “Come on,” he patted the seat beside him. Sulking, Draco joined him, and they spent the next minute rearranging the blankets around their bodies.
After putting on a robe that had belonged to Regulus Black, according to the delicate letters etched on the inner pocket, he exited the bathroom in a cloud of vapour. He followed the scent of warm bread, sneering in distaste at the dark green tapestries plastered on the wall of the stairs. They were just as foul in the morning light.
The boathouse of Malfoy Manor had been built on the pond that Father insisted on calling a lake when Draco was too small to stare at him in disbelief. “Pond” wasn’t posh enough; telling people that yes, indeed, the Manor’s grounds included a lake was much more dignified.
So far, he knew that he wouldn’t touch most vegetables unless they were raw (he loved munching on crispy, fresh bell-peppers), but was fine with potatoes, carrots and pea puree. Squash would be new. He thought it would work.
Being stuck here was like having travelled back in time. The food was always from the Founding era; the clothes had belonged to people who’d been dead for a thousand years; there was no tea (to Malfoy’s horror) and no pumpkin juice. Then there was the privy, and the weird toothpaste (Freshening Charms only went so far), and the tub, and the lumpy bed, and so many things Harry’d never thought he’d ever see or use… Malfoy had had a harder time getting used to it. He must have missed his beauty routine, though Harry believed it hadn’t been a priority for him since sixth year. Not that Malfoy wasn’t attractive. With Slytherin’s nagging, he was also getting healthier.
Heart soaring, Harry nodded so fast he almost lost his glasses. Blaise’s words rushed back to him: Christmas lights. They could go to Hyde Park. “There’s a—I guess you can call it a Christmas market. It’s new. Winter Wonderland, I think, about 20 minutes from here.”
“I need to see you—” Draco gasped as Harry slammed into him faster, pulled out, flipped him around and slid back inside in one long, slow, agonising movement. Draco yelped, his spent cock laying against his stomach. “
Draco landed beyond the weave of charms protecting their tent. “Potter, I’ll strangle you in your sleep.”
It’s not a question, which makes Harry wonder how atrocious he actually looked two weeks ago. “It’s that visible?”
His Mark was different. The skull seemed to be laughing, and the snake was instead a chain wrapped around his forearm. He wasn’t worthy of the real Dark Mark. He was a slave to the Dark Lord and nothing more.
He rummaged under the bed, unable to see anything until he touched the small box he’d hidden there under several Notice-Me-Not and Repelling Charms. Not that anyone could touch it without his consent; familial artefacts of that sort were impossible to steal without their owner’s approval.
“Ah, not really?” Harry was pretty sure she’d guessed, though. “She said she couldn’t reach you and wanted to know why. Told her you were at my place.”
Ron ordered his food and drink and exhaled loudly, taking off his Cannons scarf. He wasn’t gangly anymore; the past few years, spent raising his son and daughters, had given him a bit of a belly. Unsurprising, since he’d learned to cook from his mum and saw no reason not to indulge. Still, he looked good, with a short beard, much fuller than Harry’s, and sparkling eyes. His lifestyle suited him so well; Harry sometimes envied him since he, too, had long wished for a family of his own.
He stirs, looks to his right and smiles. Scarhead sleeps on his belly, peaceful and unfairly attractive (in reality, he’s drooling on his pillow and looks ridiculous, but Draco is blinded by his feelings).
Hermione drops onto the sofa and exhales loudly. She has a few specks of tomato sauce on her shirt. “I had nightmares after the fireworks,” she starts, glancing at him, and Harry pretends to be fascinated by the clear liquid in his cup. “I haven’t had them for such a long time, I definitely did not miss them. How did you sleep that night?”
flew through the room, and Harry caught it with a loud clap, opened it, and checked the table of contents. “Think it’s shortcrust pastry?”
Theo is looking at him and Draco, and rolling his eyes. “Pans, they’re being cute again,” he grits out with a disgusted expression. In response, Draco kisses Harry’s cheek, and Pansy throws her arms in the air and declares she’s not getting involved this time.
Some of Draco’s habits infuriated Harry; he clung to Harry like an octopus at night, threw fits if he found a stain on his clothes—but left messes everywhere because he’d never been taught to clean up after himself. Harry would only pick up dirty socks a dozen times before he started yelling. Kreacher helped, thank Merlin, but he shouldn’t have to. For a Slytherin, Draco had a strange concept of self-preservation, and Harry would find him experimenting with an open flame near flammable material, leaving his cigarette on the sofa and not checking if it was still burning, or gathering Bubotuber bulbs without gloves. He spent so long in the bathroom every day to achieve his looks (“it’s called négligé, Potter”) that Harry always had to use the bathroom downstairs, which was tiny and hosted a massive, purring Puffskein that watched Harry pee. But Draco was also funny, and sarcastic, and charming, and he brightened Harry’s life.
Resolving to sit in bed until the need became impossible to ignore, he coughed again, and let his head fall back against the wall. He’d often acted stupidly to save his pride and his honour as a Malfoy—when being a Malfoy still meant something. Accepting Potter’s help when Draco was the one who’d asked him to visit in the first place should not make him want to hide in shame. He wasn’t even sure it was shame. Perhaps a little? Embarrassment at his own lack of courage, mostly. He should have taken a bag and followed Potter straight away instead of being stubborn and staying here. But now he had a crush on him again, old dormant emotions rearing their imbecilic heads after a walk in the snow. Those feelings were never far from the surface. They surged at the most inconvenient moments because Potter was fit, and kind, and sassy, and great with Teddy, and unfairly intense.
A long road surrounded by twisted rock formations welcomed them. The sky was entirely black, without a hint of a star in sight, and they saw no vegetation from their position. If it weren’t for the multitude of blob-like shapes walking down the winding road carrying white paper lanterns, Harry and Draco would likely be lost in total darkness.
She doesn’t like him. It’s okay; he doesn’t like her either. But she doesn’t loathe him, which is just too fucking strange. It doesn’t make sense. Then there’s Lovegood, who always smiles at him, or Longbottom, who greets him with that new confidence he built during the war. If Draco wasn’t already sure of his sexuality, Longbottom could quickly enlighten him. Too late. Draco knew he was gay when he was a child and crushed on Theo. He confirmed it in fourth year. It was Potter’s fault, then.
Teddy had some peculiar conception of what looked good, and he’d hung glittery glass shrimps, tiny wooden cars and butt-naked cherubs side-by-side on the branches. Draco still couldn’t get over Mother’s horror, though from having seen Teddy’s creations in previous years, he hadn’t been that surprised. The difference now was that the little gremlin did it on purpose.
“I wasn’t sure I could still speak,” Harry explains, rubbing his scar. Did he notice Draco’s emotionless mask? Surely, he must have. If that is the case, Draco is grateful that he doesn’t speak of it.
They broke apart. Eyes shut, Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s and shuddered. Harry’s grip on his back was almost painful.
He could hear Malfoy muttering about brash Gryffindors, so after a few spells cast in quick succession, he told him there was nothing down there aside from a pulse of neutral magic. Malfoy sent floating lights his way, and they scattered to illuminate a wider area. Harry noticed a short tunnel to the right and could see the end of it. Instead of acting rash and walking straight in there without thinking, he closed his eyes and chanted, welcoming the familiar darkness in his head. He found a soft glow at the back of the tunnel, matching the magical signature his spells had detected.
Draco groaned and sneered when Ginny laughed until she snorted. Whoever Wood hired to play Santa this year had chosen a costume with so much extra padding he didn’t quite fit through the door but still managed to wiggle his way in. He opened his arms wide. “Aaah there you are, come on, give me a hug!”
He manages to keep the tears at bay this time, but his body is wracked by violent shudders as his Glamour fails. Kreacher vanishes the sick from the grass when an otter Patronus shows up, and Hermione’s voice tells Harry to contact her if he needs her.
Harry unzipped the tent and immediately cast a cooling charm on himself. Leaving the vicinity of the magical temperature regulator they’d brought with them was always a shock. He found Draco at the mouth of the canyon they’d slept in, casting spells at the sand. “What are you doing?”
“The noise, too. I wasn’t expecting it. I just — can we go somewhere that is not Hogwarts or Hogsmeade or London?”
“Most potions you can make with Basilisk parts are too volatile. I’d waste ingredients attempting to replicate something that hasn’t been done in centuries. I’d rather let someone else try it after I already took their money.”
Eyes fluttering shut, Draco leans back. “Father did me a favour by being conspicuously absent. Mother was frazzled; Scorp transfigured Albert.” Draco tells him everything. He twists his body until he’s facing Harry, and he can guess by the gleam in his gaze that their son’s antics amuse him. Harry doesn’t have the same relationship with magic as Draco or another magical-raised parent. He’s just proud to see Scorpius do anything new; he doesn’t care about power levels. Draco does, still, to this today. It’s not because he wouldn’t love a child without magic, but he’d be worried about their quality of life. Though, really, the ritual that conceived Scorpius used Harry’s, Astoria’s and Draco’s magic. It’d be surprising if Scorpius were a Squib.
After casting a Tempus, he figured it wouldn’t be long before his mum came home. “Thank you, Mopsy. I’ll take my tea in the sunroom.” He watched her pop out of existence and headed upstairs, sparing a glance for the white walls that used to be covered by a Victorian tapestry. Blood splatters and unthinkable fluids had forced them to redecorate after the war. The house went from a tired and old-fashioned Manor showcasing riches in every corner to a bright and welcoming home; the portraits had been replaced by moving pictures of their family enjoying themselves. Gone was the dark furniture, replaced by light wooden pieces and complimented by turquoise curtains. If Draco didn’t know better, he could’ve sworn Mother had found her inspiration in Muggle magazines. Still, he liked his penthouse in Covent Garden a lot better. There was no painful memory to face at his place, and he was far from the gloom of Father’s presence.
Harry inserted a third finger into his arse and spread his legs wider. His free hand pulled on his flaccid cock, just a bit, not enough to wake it up. It’d taken practice; long hours of testing his resistance now allowed him to prevent the pain of a prolonged erection. He’d found he liked soft cocks, too, and Malfoy’s was particularly appetising. Imagining it almost ruined his efforts. He drew out his orgasm, panting against his pillow, and when his wrist was too sore to continue, he finally allowed himself to harden and came after a single stroke. He lay on the sheets, dazed, listening to the rain on the window.
On the right-hand side, stairs descended into the darkness. Straight ahead, though, were several pieces of wooden furniture, mostly chairs and benches, arranged in a semi-circle. At the centre, Harry spotted symbols carved into the stone floor. They reminded him of the runes on Hermione’s schoolbooks. A massive chandelier illuminated the windowless room, and two torches at the back framed a portrait tall enough to represent its subject’s accurate proportions. Malfoy gasped as the portrait opened his eyes and Harry stood by his side, wondering who they were about to talk to.
Malfoy sniffed, nose in the air, and scratched his left arm, muttering under his breath. “Pansy has it.”
“His magic isn’t mature enough,” Harry points out, but Draco shakes his head. That’s untrue. Eleven is an arbitrary age set by the British Ministry; most countries don’t have the same restrictions. He tells him so, which makes Harry’s eyebrows climb up to his hairline. “What do you mean?”
When he pushed the Tupperware aside, he noticed, for the first time, that something was different about his living space. He knew every nook and cranny of his cupboard, could even see the pattern on the wood under each step above his head in his sleep. That extra door had not been there before.
Harry liked snakes, but snakes did not carry messages. Doors didn’t appear out of nowhere either, so he figured he must have been dreaming. Aunt Petunia would faint if she could see that; it would be brilliant.
“Of course. Maybe for the petrified students, too?” He winces slightly because Creevey is dead, but he’s sure his family would still appreciate a donation if the Malfoy name isn’t tied to it.
He left the office without answering their questions once he was done with his last customer of the day (an old man who forgot all about the concept of washing himself), and he crinkled an empty candy wrapper in his pocket. He’d be late, but Ron wouldn’t hold it against him. Hermione might rant about time management, though. They’d agreed to meet up once a month because they were all busy with their own lives—Hermione being the worst of them, obviously. They’d met up almost every day in the year following the war, but then Harry left Auror training, Ron and Hermione broke up, and things were too awkward for a while. They were never quite the same again. They’d all shut the door on their Hogwarts years, and it changed the dynamics of their relationship. It took a while before they were able to see each other without bringing up the break-up. Tonight, they’d have something different to talk about, because Harry didn’t want them to find out in the
“Fair.” He snatched the bottle he’d previously taken, and stopped, realising the problem. “Bollocks. We don’t have a corkscrew.”
He slowed down to peek into each compartment. Some were open, and others had the blinds shut. He didn’t want to bother people, so he didn’t knock. When he reached the end of the train, he was a bit disheartened and had gained a companion, a girl with hair worse than his, who talked so quickly and so much that she was giving him a headache. He just figured out she was looking for a toad. Having no sense of propriety (like Draco would say), she barged into the next compartment, asking if anyone had seen the wayward animal. Before Harry could apologise on her behalf, he heard her gasp.
Harry’s body almost betrayed him at the sight of Malfoy’s blissful expression when he drank his first sip. He shuffled on his seat a little and blamed his isolation for his needs. It had been too long. “He’s very well-behaved. You did a fantastic job raising him.”
“If Teddy made it, it stays there.” He pushed his empty plate aside and rubbed his palms. “You can help me decorate. If you don’t mind.”
It should always have been that way. If Draco hadn’t been such an arse, if he’d even dared to chance it—but his father’s disapproval was what he had feared the most, so he’d acted the part.
“I’ll have to wait until your climate spell melts that snow,” Harry said in an attempt to appear competent, and not like a drooling mess. He gestured at the expense of land. “Do you want to let magic create a home, or give it specific instructions?”
“I am not keen on traipsing through the unknown with the Golden Boy, so if you’ll excuse me, I’ll wait here.”
Draco puts an arm around his waist and they step outside under the Christmas lights decorating the pub. Harry breathes in through his nose. “Thanks.”
Draco spots a grinning Scorpius in the doorframe. “Did you do that?” Scorpius nods. Draco steps away from Harry and kneels, so he’s at eye-level with the child. “Listen, Slinky liked it this time, but it’s better if you don’t use magic on animals. It can hurt them.”
It was late, judging by the yawn the other boy attempted to stifle, and Harry was already in bed, wearing that undershirt that made him look a bit ridiculous. He and Malfoy were now sharing a bedchamber.
“Perhaps not.” Malfoy slides off the wall, bringing awareness to the fact that he’s dressed in tight, white jeans. Harry catches himself staring. Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice, too busy squinting at the lights on the Brewtiful Mandrake with his lips curling in offense. “Is the inside also pretending to be a Christmas tree? Because I’d understand your need to get away.”
“Hello Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, cheeks burning in embarrassment, praying that she wouldn’t find out what they’d been up to. He cleared his throat. “The door was locked, and we didn’t have our wands.”
Without sparing a thought for the other, still unknown being that would spot him, Harry quickly revealed his presence.
Draco, who is now Head of Slytherin, is confiscating the newspaper at least once a week, but it’s because he wants to read it without subscribing. According to Neville, Professor Hooch and Professor Sinistra are doing the same thing. Harry isn’t sure how he feels about his old teachers scrutinising his love life, but it’s not like the
, and it made him want to hide in this villa forever. Draco had been great about everything so far, but though he'd been the one to introduce most of their activities, Harry
Harry agreed. Then again, he also thought any government willing to acknowledge Lady Foley's claim to power and ignore the gross violations of human rights and decency she was committing daily must be a bit mad already. At least with power and greed.
Draco's eyebrows rose, and Harry flushed as he shoved a spoonful of tiramisu in his mouth. No need to get into how closely Harry watched Draco back at Hogwarts just yet. His eyes widened as he took a bite; Draco wasn't kidding, it
The resistance had managed to determine the where of the attack—Leigheas Hospital of Magical Healing Arts—but there was no way to know
A pang of loss and longing went through him, but those were more emotions he couldn't entertain right now. He needed to get these children to safety; everything else could wait.
"Ahh, I've been thinking," Draco began, his hips twitching as Harry suckled at the head of his cock the way Harry knew he liked it. "I'd like to try something. From your lists, if that's all right? You can say no. Or safeword out if we try it and you don't like it."
"What do you want?" Harry asked in between kisses as they rocked together, hard cocks catching and sliding in the most delightful ways. Tonight, Harry wanted it all to be about Draco, wanted to spoil him and give him whatever he wanted.
. Somewhere along the way Harry had forgiven Draco. He'd not forgotten. He wasn't sweeping that ugliness under the rug and pretending it hadn't ever occurred, that Draco had always been the man he was now, the one Harry cared about so deeply. But Harry was no longer carrying that blame and anger towards Draco around in his heart. He'd seen how Draco had changed, and he had reached an understanding of the man Draco had become. They
"All right, this way," Harry said, shaking off the despair trying to choke him as he took off down the corridor. He'd made extensive study of the hospital's floorplans over the past several days and he knew where the closest exit was. Hopefully the way would be clear, as the air was already growing uncomfortably warm as smoke began to fill the hallways. He could hear Cara following behind him, her breaths slightly laboured as Sean whimpered in her arms. He wanted to turn and offer his assistance, but he knew she'd rebuff any attempts to take Sean from her, no matter how heavy the boy got; it wasn't worth the wasted time, not when they had so little of it left. He did cast a few charms to clear the air of smoke, hoping to make breathing a little easier. Unfortunately, given how fast they were moving, the charms weren't useful for long before he needed to cast another, and casting spell after spell was a drain on his magic when he needed to stay sharp in case something bigger and nastier came at them.
sorry, but I'm afraid I'm working that night. In fact, I'm working every night for the foreseeable future. Too bad."
"No, but we already knew things were getting worse," Draco said with a grimace. "I've been working for weeks offering medical care to the refugees coming in from Ireland. There haven't been all that many so far, but the numbers are increasing."
ringing in his ears, it was hard to pretend that there wasn't maybe some kind of sexual component to this whole ageplay thing, after all. Harry wasn't sure he was ready to face that, ready to face what it meant, what it said about him that he could want Draco to call him his sweet, precious boy while Harry rode Daddy's cock. Maybe that was fine for other people, maybe some could get off on it and think it was no big deal, but Harry wasn't sure if that was him; he didn't know if he could handle it at all.
promise that you'll always come first for me, Draco. I wouldn't ever do something like go off to war without talking things through with you and coming to some kind of agreement beforehand."
it would happen, as Foley hadn't given her followers a specific timeline. It made preventing the attack an almost impossibility, as it was critical they not make any obvious moves that would let Foley's followers know they were on to them. They'd lose their chance at capturing the last of her people, and could possibly cause them to divert their attack to an entirely new location, one they couldn't manage as easily. They worked with hospital administration to shore up defenses and covertly reduce the number of patients and staff on site, but it
She looked reprovingly at their de facto head strategist, Fathi Ayad, a handsome man in his forties, with glossy black hair, warm brown skin, and a sharp, eagle-eyed gaze that missed nothing. He'd been head of the Irish Auror Department before Lady Foley had taken over more than a year ago and promptly charged him—and several other of her high-ranking detractors—with treason. He'd only just escaped with his life, and he and several others started working full time to bring her down. From what Harry had seen over the past six months, Fathi seemed like a good man trying his best, but he was worn thin and growing weary. Harry didn't think Parvati was being entirely fair—no doubt Fathi understood an attack was coming but without solid intel there wasn't much he could do, and they didn't have the manpower to monitor all possible targets. Explaining that to Parvati wouldn't do much good though; Fathi and Parvati had been like oil and water from the start.
set came with a miniature town with tavern lights that twinkled and townspeople that cowered whenever Harry commanded the tiny dragon to fly menacingly overhead. Draco sat nearby and watched, joining in occasionally to help with the constructions, smiling encouragingly whenever Harry asked
She nodded, looking terrified but resolute. He wondered if she'd gone to Hogwarts, if she'd been sorted into Gryffindor.
"Oh, can I?" Draco said with amusement, but he obediently switched his attention back to the book hovering in front of him. Harry smiled as Draco's cool voice washed over him a moment later, watching as the pretty lights formed a bright and playful Crup.
feel guilty. "It's not your fault. You're supposed to push me, and you didn't do anything I hadn't said I'd be interested in exploring. It just… I think it made it all a little too real. I never really allowed myself to think about what we were doing together, but when you said…
"I've got the Adventures of Merlin enchanted action figures; some One, Two, Three, Arithmancy blocks; a My First Potions set; and a Charmed Child practice wand."
"Robards," Harry called out, striding over to him. Robards looked at him in sudden surprise before his expression changed, and the look of gentle compassion on his normally gruff, stony face made Harry stumble. Robards caught him before he fell, his hand a large, heavy weight on Harry's shoulder.
Draco's pupils dilated as he ran his hands down Harry's back to cup his bum. He pulled Harry down more firmly against him, grinding their cocks together, and Harry moaned.
The letter was short. Draco suggested they meet that night to talk things over. He made it clear that it was fine if Harry thought it was too soon, but he believed it might be helpful if they had their discussion before the coming week, when they'd inevitably see one another at work. Harry fought off the instinctive urge to bury his head in the sand, acknowledging that Draco was probably right. He didn't need the distraction of their looming talk hanging over him while he was tracking down dangerous criminals and trying to fill out paperwork. Better to get it out of the way first.
"You show it just fine," Draco replied, his voice husky, before drawing Harry into a toe curling kiss.
"Fuck," Draco muttered, rubbing a hand across his face. "We shouldn't do this right now. You're injured."
Now that he was looking for it, he made out the shimmering grey of the shield spell they used for victims that were dead on arrival. Was that where Draco was? He moved towards the bubble as if in a trance, but Robards grabbed hold of his arm stilling him and shaking his head.
Draco's jaw tightened as he began stripping off his robes. "But you didn't tell me Parvati had officially decided to volunteer to go over to Ireland. And don't think I missed how jealous you were when she said she'd finished the last of the paperwork and would be leaving soon."
, but emotionally… it feels like one more thing that makes me different and weird. I'm so tired of feeling like a freak."
Harry climbed up the front steps, Draco a solid presence behind him as he reached out to give the door a firm rap. They only had to wait a few moments before the door swung open, revealing an attractive gentleman who looked to be in his mid-forties. His brow was creased with annoyance but his expression quickly cleared when he caught sight of the Auror uniforms.
He nodded, scrambling up onto the cushions and pressing himself against Draco's side. Draco looked momentarily startled but before Harry could worry that he'd done something wrong, Draco wrapped an arm around him, his gaze softer and warmer than Harry's favourite blanket as he looked Harry over.
By Sunday morning, though, Harry knew he'd avoided the issue long enough. It was probably time to figure some shit out. Because it was looking increasingly like Harry might have a bit of a
Fathi was at the head of the table, as grim faced as ever, but Harry didn't think he was imagining the glimmer of hope in his eyes as he looked everybody over. Harry's racing heart skipped a beat.
"Right, pleased to meet you. I'm Auror Potter, and this is Auror Malfoy, and yes, we're here to speak with Emily about what happened last night."
Draco laughed and flashed Harry a pleased grin that made his stomach wriggle—or maybe that was just the hunger.
"Spread a little wider for me, Harry," Draco said in that petal-soft purr of his, the one that made Harry want to drop to his knees and do whatever he commanded. He inched his legs a little wider, giving Draco better access, and Draco pressed a kiss to his thigh in approval as he began to slide a single finger inside.
"You're right, Draco, you're so fucking right, and I don't mean to imply that it isn't important or necessary. You know I've been helping Hermione with a lot of that here, and I'm not above using my influence to help, but I'm not built for that kind of activism, Draco, not long term. I hate it, and I'm not good at it. But fighting… that I know how to do. I'm meant to be out on the front lines."
. Harry turned to Parvati, frantic and pleading. "If Fathi would just let me question her, I could—"
Finally the room was full. Every chair at the table was taken, and those that had come in too late to snag one were crowded up against the walls, their faces hungry with anticipation. Fathi cleared his throat, and the room went deathly silent.
"I'm into it," Harry said, adjusting his position until he was lying on Draco's stomach, looking down at him with heated eyes. "I like it when you're in control." His cheeks grew warm but he pressed on. "I'm not sure I want a proper scene just yet, but I like the idea of playing around a little bit with some of those activities I said I was interested in."
A sick feeling of dread filled him when no bubble appeared on the horizon, but its absence could have meant any number of things. Harry wasn't sure when the attack happened—perhaps they'd already cleared off all of the victims. Or maybe the Aurors were so busy containing the situation that they'd broken protocol and hadn't cast the charm. Or perhaps the smoke that was still stinging Harry's eyes was somehow blinding him to its location.
Harry got back from Berlin tired, but pleased. He'd accompanied Minister Shacklebolt as a member of his personal security for a meeting of several Heads of State in regards to the escalating situation in Ireland. Great Britain was already offering aid to the resistance on the ground that was trying to bring down Lady Foley, and they'd been taking refugees for months. Minister Shacklebolt was hoping to drum up support from other countries to help put an end to the madness and destruction. Guard-duty wasn't generally Harry's idea of a good time, but the topic of the Summit was one that was of particular interest to him, and there were worse people to spend time with than Kingsley. It was one more way for Harry to feel like he was doing his part to help the situation without actually fighting himself. He still felt the occasional pang when Parvati wrote him with updates from the war front, but for the most part Harry had made his peace with staying in England. He had a life here, one he wasn't eager to leave.
Fathi inclined his head towards Parvati in acknowledgement. "That is correct. And we have less than a week to make an airtight plan of attack, hence this emergency meeting. Byrne has been able to provide us with what he believes is the time and place that Lady Foley will leave the protection of her wards. From that moment, we'll have approximately five minutes during which time Lady Foley will have to create and activate the Portkey—thankfully she's paranoid enough that she won't trust anybody else to create it on her behalf, nor will she create it beforehand and risk it being tampered with. That is our window to attack and take Lady Foley hostage. We can expect up to a dozen of her closest confederates to be with her."
have to talk about it, Harry. All of it. This"—he waved a hand between them—"won't have a chance of working if we don't."
This time it was Parvati's turn to wince, and Harry's stomach dropped when she didn't deny it. Apparently, that was
"He does," Parvati confirmed. "He's talking to Keating right now to get the go-ahead." Keating had been Deputy Minister before Foley had taken over. He'd gone on the run with Fathi and they'd been working together from the start. If Fathi was seeking Keating's approval, it meant his plan likely involved something of questionable legality for which Fathi would need executive approval and a promise of pardon.
"Yeah, I don't think I was really conscious of it, but I guess I really wasn't thinking of you as the boy I knew at school, because Hogwarts wasn't something that was on my radar. You were just like… this person I trusted implicitly to take care of me and keep me safe. I didn't even have to think about it."
Harry snorted and settled into the bed next to Draco. Draco tugged and Harry let his body be manipulated until he was lying on his side with Draco's body plastered against him, his chest hot against Harry's bare back. Harry sighed happily; he loved being the little spoon.
It’s nice to be with someone who doesn’t need words to understand him. They’re so attuned to each other - it’s almost scary.
Oh. So that’s what the smile meant. Harry should’ve known better. Reading Draco’s often ambiguous behaviour hadn’t become any easier in the few months since they’d exchanged letters. However, so far, Harry still thought he knew him well, from years of observation. It didn’t mean he didn’t read his mood wrong, though. Draco wasn’t sweet, or soft, or anything of the sort in the morning. Harry looked at the spot Draco was pointing at and understood instantly, suppressing a full-body shudder at the sight of the giant camel spider that appeared to be obsessed with Draco’s shoes. Dealing with creatures hadn’t been Draco’s strong suit since they’d left England; his charms rarely managed to keep bugs out, and his magic attracted all kinds of strange, many-legged creatures.
Draco looked up and readjusted his woolly hat. He looked cute with it. “I’d love to walk a little if that’s all right.”
“Of course not. This isn’t an abuse case, this is a- whoever wrote this wants to take this boy away and found a convenient excuse. This is barely legal. Malfoy has too many restrictions to get out of this and would be unable to hire a solicitor.” He read the parchment again. “You signed this.” He chuckled. “You actually signed.”
The door opened, revealing Draco with his fake face, and another man who was very thin and very pale, with long hair like Jim’s. He had Draco’s eyes. Harry remembered the stories about Draco’s family; Sirius was his cousin, and he was the brother of Regulus Black, who was a hero in many of Jim’s stories and owned an insane elf. Harry liked hearing about Kreacher.
As hard as this evening was for him, it triggered some kind of realisation, and he’s going to send letters to those he trusts. They probably don’t know how to handle him. He’ll help them. He’ll help himself — as long as his brain lets him.
With a gasp, Scorpius wiggled under his dark blue quilt. The goofy narwhals embroidered in the fabric swam faster. They gathered at the foot of the bed, reminding Draco that he still needed to figure out if real narwhals had been created by an insane Unspeakable after one too many drinks. Sea creatures often rendered him speechless, when they didn’t visit him in his nightmares (honestly, screw the goblin shark). He blamed his son, who had two passions: his Legos and the sea. Draco had been telling him bedtime stories about princesses and dragons, revisiting his favourite tales, until Scorpius started asking questions about sea creatures. At first, Draco had been delighted to educate his precious little boy, roaming libraries and bookshops to find child-friendly material about plimpies, grindylows and selkies. Still, as Draco ran out of magical creatures, Scorpius pressed on, requesting details about ordinary water-dwelling beasts. In Draco’s opinion, there was nothing ordinary about the vampire squid.
Draco turned it off with a flick of his wand. “What happens in a few years? Us being back where we should be?”
The procession came to a sudden halt. Heart in his throat, he held his breath—and the creatures moved again, this time going around an obstacle.
A vibrant orange, almost glittering stone with a carving of the Malfoy Crest fell into his open palms, and Harry froze. “Oh my gods Draco what are you doing!” The wardstone! This nutter had just broken the golden rule of ancestral lands! And Harry could feel the magic take hold, that tingling sensation, so similar to the rush of joy from his Patronus, so welcoming, so soft. “These are your ancestral wards, you can’t just—”
Still flustered, but satisfied that Malfoy’s bath had helped him feel better, Harry feigned a keen interest for a roll of parchment he couldn’t read. He listened as Slytherin spoke of the progress they’d made, how the wards had barely reacted to their occasional spats since the incident that’d gotten them both stuck to a wall. It’d been akin to bickering, without any intent to hurt each other.
“Malfoy.” Harry stepped closer and squeezed his upper arm. “I don’t mind. Can I?” He raised his hand, and when Malfoy nodded, he ran his fingers through soft, thick white-blond strands. Malfoy was now staring at him, a glimmer in his eyes and lips parted, and Harry couldn’t help himself. He pulled him closer, nose and forehead touching, still caressing his hair and trying to get his breathing under control. “Okay?”
Lavender nodded, the scars on her face more vivid as the full moon approached. “I’d rather live in the streets.”
“Yeah, that works. Sweet, please.” He cast a Tempus. Five. Perfect, he still had time before meeting Draco, who would undoubtedly judge his life-choices. After Hermione had left Grimmauld Place, Draco had advised Harry to rest for the next twenty-four hours, not visit Teddy at Hogwarts in the morning and attend a Quidditch match later. Given Harry’s exhaustion despite a good night sleep, he had a point. “I’ll take a portion of fried mushrooms.”
Standing at the window with a glass of wine in his hand, Draco watched the fog gather on the surface of the Black Lake. Pachelbel’s Canon in D Major echoed in his quarters, bringing him some much-needed peace after a long day. He despised Tuesdays. His third-year Hufflepuffs had been in an experimental mood. Melted cauldrons, ruined desks and unusable ingredients had been the least of Draco’s worries because three students had ended up in the infirmary after breathing in the toxic fumes they’d accidentally unleashed.
The room was so big! And the bed? Even Dudley’s was smaller. The quilt cover had drawings that moved! People on brooms, flying, chasing a little ball with wings. The shelves were heavy with books, and the carpet was soft under his feet.
“Go in, find that lantern, and bring it back. I suspect the entity needs the light to find a way out. Do nothing else. Make no attempt at purging, or interacting with anything sentient; use your cloak.”
Strangely enough, he did, and if the shuddering breath he let out was any indication, he must be in some sort of pain now. Harry’s memory of Madam Pomfrey’s most common spells kicked in, and he got to work. It helped that his adventures in the Forest of Dean were still fresh as well. A Diagnostic Charm revealed the depth of the gash, and it looked worse than it was. Harry did his best to clean the wound and numb it, and Transfigured a rock into a long (and slightly rigid) bandage, wrapping it around Malfoy’s thigh despite his protests (Malfoy seemed very reluctant to show his bare leg. Coming from such a poncy little prince, Harry wasn’t surprised).
Harry leaned back, pressing his back against Draco’s torso. “Maybe.” He lowered the heat under the pan and turned around, tangling his fingers in Draco’s hair. “How did it go?”
Susan chose this moment to sit with them and clapped in excitement. “Oooh, that’s where you went after Turkey? Isn’t it gorgeous? Did you try the pistachios?”
“Very well. Do try to survive for the next few hours.” Draco grabbed a handful of Floo powder and left.
He wasn’t in the mood to deal with them. He wasn’t in the mood to do anything but think about Draco, actually. He had the plans of the Manor on his desk and kept thinking that once it was rebuilt, Draco would leave Grimmauld Place, and his heart clenched painfully at the mere image of waking up alone. Hermione would berate him for his pessimism. She’d likely be right; Draco wouldn’t abandon Harry. Not now. They fit too well together.
“You’ll want a young Kneazle, but not a kitten. I would recommend adopting one from Bulstrode’s shelter,” Malfoy says, and he begins talking about all the reasons why, and the shop owner comes closer once or twice during his speech because it’s Malfoy and the Chosen One discussing litter brands and are they up to mischief in his shop. When Malfoy stops, his cheeks and the tip of his nose are pink, and he rubs his neck, pretending to be fascinated by the cat toy he’s holding. “So, um, yes. What I just said. Bring Edward to the shelter and let the cat choose him.”
The Molly-lookalike, who is in fact named Lisa, brings them to the house in her car. Draco is tense for the whole ride, and nearly bolts from the car after it stops, which makes Harry snort.
When Harry comes home from work, Draco grabs his arm and hands him a wooden spoon. “The bolognese is almost ready. I broke the shed and kitchen windows, but they’re fixed. Scorp is watching
He Apparates home into their back garden in Hogsmeade with a giggling boy in his arms, because for some reason, Scorpius enjoys the feeling of being squeezed through a tube. The house stands on the outskirts of the village, near the cave where Sirius Black once dwelled, far enough to avoid the students’ prying eyes on Hogsmeade weekends. They can see the Shrieking Shack from the bathroom window, and the back of the house gives a great view of Hogwarts. It’s the most convenient location for Harry, who teaches Defence and didn’t want to live in the castle. Draco is a stay-at-home dad, but he likes to write when he has some free time. He's published quite a few textbooks under a pen name.
A screeching albino peacock flew at Draco with only one intent in its creepy red eyes: murder. The young man ducked and stumbled forward on the wet grass, then ran until the bird stopped chasing him. He pushed open the door of his childhood home and closed it after one last glare at his attacker. A twig hung in his hair. He untangled his blond strands and flicked the twig away, thanking Merlin and Morgana that Potter hadn’t witnessed his ridiculous escape. He’d seen enough of them.
Draco seemed to understand, giving Harry a kind smile and another ruffle of his hair. "Why don't we start with the action figures? I… may have gone a little overboard and purchased all of the accompanying sets and settings to go with the figures. We can use the other study to set up the castle, enchanted forest, and town village."
Harry let himself be led over to his bed, sitting down amongst the mussed bed sheets while Malfoy looked him over.
"Yeah, okay," Harry said, somewhat dismissively, not sure he entirely agreed. Besides, he had more pressing matters on his mind. "But I definitely
—"caretaker and want to find a proper sub to be with, somebody who likes all the same things you do and doesn't need you babying them all the time?"
While Foley's guard was distracted by the rest of the resistance, Harry focused in on her, channelling all his fury, all his rage, as he cast spell after spell against the protected barrier that was shimmering around her. It was strong, but Harry was stronger, and he could sense the barrier weakening as he hit it with every spell, hex, and curse in the book. Eventually, Foley couldn't ignore him any longer, and she abandoned the crystal goblet she'd been attempting to turn into a Portkey—even her Portkeys were pretentious, no shock there—and whirled on him, her eyes flashing fire.
"I'm Cara," she said, her voice wavering with bravado. A movement behind her legs caught Harry's attention, a flicker of white-blond hair rustling behind her knees. Harry's heart clenched.
Wow, did that statement make Harry feel all kinds of things. He wasn't really surprised that Draco was the type to want to spoil Harry, to give him the very best of everything, but what
"Fuck, I'm already so close," he said, and Harry let out a happy moan. He was pretty fucking close himself, aided by nothing more than the thick weight of Draco's cock in his mouth and his own hand kneading his trouser-clad erection.
Harry collapsed back against the brick wall lining the alleyway, panting with pain and adrenaline as Ron and Malfoy took down the last of the baddies they'd been duelling. They'd been working this case for months, and though they hadn't planned on wrapping things up tonight, in the end it had all gone off without a hitch.
"Oh," Draco replied, his expression relieved. "All right then." He paused before continuing, his words faux casual. "Which book would you like?"
a schoolboy. Just hearing Malfoy's name from Robards had Harry melting in his seat, giddy anticipation flooding his system at the thought of getting to spend the day with him. Which was probably a bit fucked up, considering they were spending time together to interview a likely traumatised young witch about her recent assault.
Harry grumbled but did as instructed. Draco stayed for a few moments, likely to ensure Harry followed his directions, before slipping out of the room. Harry left the scenery he and Draco had constructed but made sure all the loose figures were tucked away where they couldn't get stepped on and ruined, and then he made his way to the kitchen.
Harry turned towards Fathi, waiting for his signal even though every cell in him burned to take action, to take Foley out where she stood. They'd not been expecting so many of her followers to be present while she set up the Portkey, and it looked as if she'd brought along her best duellers. Harry's fingers twitched with anticipation. That was fine by him. He could use a good fight. After far too long cooped up in Fathi's manor, just waiting for some action, they were finally
of him coming was enough to push Harry over the edge himself, and he bit down on Draco's lips as his climax hit.
Harry's cheeks grew warm, and it was a little ridiculous that he had Draco's dick in hand and was currently teasing his rim with the hot, rounded head, but it was Draco calling him out on Harry not wanting this to be a one-time deal that had him blushing.
"You said dinner was my choice so I brought Thai," Harry said, happy his hands were full so he couldn't brush his fingers wonderingly over the hot spot on his cheek where Draco had kissed him. He held up his bag of takeaway, the mouth-watering smell of Pad See Ew and Coconut Curry wafting from the plastic containers and providing a tempting distraction.
"So chivalrous," Draco murmured, a low, seductive edge to his words that had Harry's stomach flipping as he followed him out of the department. He'd made a similar comment last night on their date when Harry had held the door open for Draco as they'd left the restaurant. They'd walked companionably back to Grimmauld Place afterward, Harry's heart jumping every time their fingers accidentally brushed together. Harry's gaze darted down to those fingers now, the smooth polished fingernails, the perfectly maintained cuticle beds, the prominent knuckle bones that would feel so good stretching—
helping, that I'm making a difference. But I don't feel it here." He placed Draco's hand over his heart.
Draco moaned, an obscene sound of pure pleasure, as he licked a bite of tiramisu from his spoon. Harry reached down to subtly adjust himself beneath the table, his cock throbbing as he thought of all the other ways he could get Draco to make that sound.
Draco shook his head and spread his legs a bit wider so that Harry could settle more firmly between them.
begging either. Something hot and hungry flashed across Draco's face, so quick Harry wasn't sure if he'd seen it or just
, looking even more fuckable than usual when he was within pouncing distance of Harry's mattress. Another throb of arousal pulsed through him and he swayed on his feet, feeling light-headed.
Harry's face burned just thinking of what might be on those lists, and the thought of reading them with Draco right there
before tying them around Cara and Sean's faces, then doing the same for himself. He tried a spell to clear the air, but it barely lasted a second beneath the constant onslaught of smoke.
Harry's eyes widened, and he looked once more at Draco, who gave a small, unconcerned shrug. Had they stepped into a parallel universe? Was Harry hallucinating? What possible other reason was there for a grown woman to be dressed up as a little girl and calling her fiancé
"That was lovely," Draco said with a pleased sigh. He flashed Harry a gratified grin. "You were perfect." He settled his hands on top of Harry's, which were still atop his knees. "You follow directions so well."
"So," Draco began somewhat nervously. "I assume the whole Daddy kink thing I introduced has something to do with your flight from Britain?"
"We know, Harry." There was such finality there, the kind of positive surety Harry knew Robards wouldn't dole out lightly.
Harry laughed. "All right, I'll give you that Hugo's still in what I like to call the Mandrake stage, both in terms of looks and temperament, but Rose isn't so bad. And with the kids around, Hermione and Ron will be distracted from your lovely presence. Not that you need to worry!" Harry backtracked at Draco's worried expression. "It's not like this is the first time you'll have seen them since Hogwarts. You've all been perfectly civil when you've run into one another over the past few years."
, and for everybody but Harry to be acting like there was nothing at all bizarre about it? But Draco had asked Harry to trust him, and it was clear there was something going on that he didn't understand. He could ask Draco about it later, but for now, they had an interview to conduct.
As a dedicated (or reckless, if you listened to Hermione) Auror, Harry managed to find his way to St Mungo's just about once a week. It wasn't Harry's favourite part of the job, getting injured, but it had certainly become a whole lot more interesting once Malfoy had been assigned as his Healer a few months ago. Harry had lost track of Malfoy in the aftermath of the war, a fact that bothered him more than it should have. Though in all his vague wonderings of what Malfoy was up to, Harry had certainly never guessed that Malfoy was abroad training to become a Healer. The second Harry saw him again after all these years, his obsession had reignited with a passion. Malfoy being a Healer was so at odds with the selfish, cowardly teenager Harry had known him as, he couldn't help his fascination.
would be where she'd sneak out, though, some instinct that Harry had long since learned to trust. Anticipation thrummed through him, threaded through with something darker and more primal, a hunter waiting patiently for its prey.
Draco shook his head emphatically. "Not for me." He paused, biting his lip before continuing in a hopeful tone, "Next time?"
He sent the owl on with his reply, polishing off the rest of his sandwich before checking his watch. Harry still had a good four hours before he needed to shower and change and start on dinner. Already his brain felt full to bursting with everything he'd learned that day, and all he wanted at that moment was to shut off his mind, if only for a while.
It looked like just about every Auror on staff was working the scene, and Harry scanned for Head Auror Robards, certain he'd have taken charge of such a high profile attack. Sure enough, he was not twenty yards away, barking orders at a pair of Junior Aurors, his face already lined with exhaustion and the heavy weight of responsibility.
See, the thing was… Harry kind of had a massive cock. Which sounded like the dream when you were a teenaged boy sharing a dormitory with a bunch of
Helpless anger and despair welled up inside of Harry, threatening to choke him even worse than the smoke filling his lungs. Hadn't they all suffered enough? Hadn't
Reaching for the crayons, Harry opened up the book to the first page—the outline of a phoenix—and began to colour.
Harry nuzzled against Draco's chest, practically purring with pleasure as Draco ran an absent-minded hand up and down Harry's back. They were curled up together on Draco's sofa, watching some Muggle cartoons on Draco's telly as Harry came out of his littlespace. He'd spent the afternoon in the outfit Draco had modified for him, though it was already beginning to fray, the growing charms finally beginning to take their toll on the fabric. Harry didn't mind—it was still nicer than anything the Dursleys ever got for him—but Draco insisted that there'd be something new for Harry to wear next time, which filled him with a quiet excitement.
Draco sighed. "Yes, I know all that. But haven't you given up enough? You've already fought in a war, you don't need to volunteer for another one." He looked down, picking at a thread in the bed sheets. "Are you… are you not happy here?"
That sounded perfect to Harry and he nodded before sliding off the sofa and onto his knees. Draco gave a startled chuckle, then adjusted himself so he was sitting instead of lying down. He'd barely even got settled before Harry was reaching for his flies, suddenly desperate to feel Draco down his throat. This wasn't the first time Harry had the chance to blow him, but he couldn't seem to get enough.
"That's all right, it's okay. I'm going to get you both out, okay? One of us is going to need to carry Sean, though."
Draco's grip tightened and he began to wank Harry faster, twisting his wrist on every upstroke in a way that made Harry gasp into Draco's mouth. Draco hummed with obvious pleasure, humping into Harry's fist as he kissed Harry hard and deep.
. The two of them fought well together, their magic syncing beautifully and their movements almost choreographed, each of them anticipating the other's moves. It made Harry sad and wistful, thinking of how in tune he and Draco had been the few times they'd gone to a duelling club together.
He murmured a Healing spell Harry wasn't familiar with—which wasn't saying much, Harry barely knew the basic spells—and Harry braced himself for the usual discomfort that accompanied his own shoddy Healing spells. Instead, he was hit with a wave of warmth and a not-unpleasant tingling as Malfoy's magic slid across his skin, knitting it back together. It was quite nice, actually, that strong, building heat radiating from his side. The sudden absence of pain—which he hadn't even realised he'd been experiencing to such an intense degree—combined with the caress of Malfoy's magic, the feel of his hand on Harry's bare shoulder, and his general proximity to Harry's half-naked person, turned the arousal which had been simmering in his gut into a full-fledged boil.
Blood rushed through Harry's ears and his vision went red. He understood now why Fathi had been hesitant.
Harry blinked drowsily as he began to awaken. He was dazed and disoriented for several moments—he was clearly not in his own bed. He seemed to be sleeping half on top of somebody and, based on the fancy coffee table right in his eyeline, they were on a sofa. A movement on the table caught his eye, and he focused on the large children's book in front of him with the happily bouncing cartoon Crup, and all his memories came rushing back.
could survive it, but it's already hard enough with you being an Auror, every day wondering if the next time you show up at St Mungo's it'll be for something we can't fix…" He trailed off, pressing his lips together and looking away as he blinked furiously. When he continued, his voice was rough. "Having you go off into a war zone in another country… maybe it makes me an awful person, but I just don't think I can live with that kind of fear and uncertainty. I… I don't want that kind of life for myself, and I don't want to pretend that I could deal with it just to make you happy."
"You're important to me too," Harry said softly, moving in close to brush a kiss against Draco's lips. Harry knew how much Draco liked control, and for somebody like him it would be incredibly frustrating knowing that Ron and Hermione's feelings about him, and how the night went, was more or less out of his hands. So Harry reminded Draco of what he
Draco swiveled his hips, grinding against Harry and causing them both to moan at the pleasurable friction. It felt so good, and normally Harry wouldn't have any problem at all frotting together until they both came in their pants like teenagers. But Harry had had enough of acting younger than his years for the night, so he wedged a hand between them and began working open Draco's flies.
Before he could second-guess himself, he grabbed a partially bent quill from his junk drawer and penned a reply, inviting Draco over to Grimmauld Place for dinner that night. Harry enjoyed cooking and thought making a meal might help calm some of his nerves. He'd been planning a bacon and asparagus risotto—something nice and labour-intensive to occupy his mind—and he had plenty of ingredients for two.
"Coffee," Harry confirmed, passing one of the steaming mugs to Draco as he climbed into bed beside him. He watched as Draco took a sip, pleasure flowing through him as Draco's lashes fluttered in satisfaction.
Malfoy's nose wrinkled. "I'm not all that keen on the place either, nor are they particularly fond of me, but needs must. Weasley must have something truly and spectacularly depraved planned for his and Granger's anniversary given his reaction just now and I, for one, do not plan on finding out what happens if I don't ensure you're all healed up and unable to infringe upon their weekend."
"Thank you," she said fervently before following the boy out into the sunlight. It was so bright outside that it hurt Harry's eyes and he turned away, back towards the ruined hospital.
Harry reached for his wand, Conjuring a palmful of lube and reaching down between them to pet Draco's hole. Something about the unique feeling of that wrinkled rim always ramped up Harry's lust even more, and he slowly eased a finger inside, relishing the tight heat. He knew Draco enjoyed the stretch of being fucked open, so Harry didn't spend too much time fingering him, just long enough to get him slick.
"Now that we've finished eating, I thought we could move on to another activity while we watched the television."
. All that time at Hogwarts, there was this amazing person buried inside that scared, self-important boy, a person that never would have been able to grow and flourish if not for the harsh realities the war had brought. The war had wrought so much devastation, but Harry was so fucking grateful that it had been the catalyst that burned Draco's old world to the ground so his best self could emerge like a phoenix from the ashes.
It was as if Draco's words had a direct line to Harry's cock, and suddenly he was coming, his release pulled out of him with the force of Draco's command. Draco fucked him right through it, screwing in nice and deep before finding his own release as he held himself inside Harry's arse.
"I've been here before, Harry," Draco said with a raised brow as he began undoing the buttons of his shirt. "You're not the first person Blaise has offered up his villa to. But I promise that story isn't nearly as interesting as you getting naked."
at another piece of parchment ever again, so he focused on making dinner when he got home, though those damned lists still called to him like a Siren's song as he threw together his spaghetti carbonara.
Harry turned accusing eyes onto Ron, the filthy traitor. "I don't need a babysitter!" Nor did he need to spend more time with Malfoy, especially now that the case was all wrapped up. He was starting to reach critical levels of the horn, and too much exposure to Malfoy and the shirt that was currently clinging to his surprisingly defined biceps might lead to Harry doing something… rash and ill-advised. He was already seriously concerned he'd caught a case of the
It had been another wonderful afternoon, and Harry felt sleepily content as his adult brain slowly came back online as if it had finally recharged. It brought with it a renewed sense of awareness of Draco's body beneath Harry's own, so solid and strong. He squirmed as arousal began to pulse through him, and he mouthed at the patch of Draco's bare chest above his unbuttoned collar.
He stood up, giving Draco a shaky smile and trying to look unbothered as he backed away toward the guest room.
Not too late, then. He snuck a glance at Draco, who was sprawled casually across the sofa, the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows and exposing his pale and shapely forearms. A throb of arousal pulsed through Harry. They weren't having sex during their scenes, but surely they'd finished for the day, right? There was still plenty of time left for a different kind of fun. Harry had never felt so relaxed, his mind calm and quiet for the first time in ages.
Which was one of the many benefits of pub nights, when Harry got to spend time with a slightly wider friend group and remembered he wasn't the only one unmarried and without children, that he wasn't behind schedule or missing out. Harry always left the pub feeling energised and happy, reminded of how much he genuinely loved spending time with his friends. He was forever resolving to be better about staying in touch, but somehow time always managed to get away from him.
"Okay, Cara, get ready. Do you see that hazy ball of light way across the foyer?" He gestured to the white halo of smoke and she nodded. "That's the exit. We're going to make a break for it." She looked nervously up at the ceiling, which was looking increasingly unstable, but there wasn't much for it. "I'm going to provide cover for you and Sean, and I want you to just focus on getting there as quickly as you can, all right? Keep low. We don't know yet what's on the other side of those doors, but we've gotta get out of this building. Wait for me before you go through."
