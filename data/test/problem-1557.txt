“This, Mr. Malfoy, is the Mirror of Erised and it shows your deepest and most desperate desires. I’ve only ever brought few students in this room and by far you have had the most interesting reflection”
Draco shook his head.
“What?” he asked.
You’re so beautiful Draco, angelic both on the outside and the inside.
He recalled what they were fighting for and thought about how not all the gold in the world or infinite glory could convince him to fight against a fire-breathing dragon. After all, Draco thought he knew his weaknesses by now and was sure lack of bravery was one of them (along with his fear of spiders).
People still whispered and stared at him when he passed by them in the corridors but he had learnt to just ignore them.
“Welcome to Ravenclaw!”
Draco was really glad he had returned to Hogwarts so soon for two main reasons: first he could be around his friends and girlfriend again and second he was reunited with Snoodle.
Soon it was time to select each champion: he sat nervously in the Great Hall as Dumbledore extracted the names from the cup.
On the way back the two basically had to run to the apparation point where Lily and James were already waiting for them.
“One meal a day. That’s all I’ve been able to keep down” he repeated as if nothing was wrong.
He looked around but didn’t hear anything. Since the cries didn’t stop, he stood up and went to check the bushes near the fence of the garden.
Draco heard some footsteps approaching the door so he quickly hid behind a suit of armor and listened as the conversation changed to school matters.
“Hello Harry” he said and smiled shakily, separating himself slightly from the other man, who was reluctant to let the blond out of his arms.
“So why would you think he’d enjoy getting smacked in the face with some snow at four in the morning?” she asked him gently.
Draco turned around to face him.
Lily’s head popped through and she blushed slightly when she saw how intimately they were laying.
“Quite right, my dear boy. And you modified the charm by yourself?”
It tasted slightly bitter but not in an unpleasant  way like other potions. Immediately he knew Draco had modified slightly the brew to make it easier for him to drink.
‘I’ve got to do something’ Hermione thought as  Ron tried to calm Harry down.
“Really? Are you absolutely sure Lav?” Ron asked.
“What do you see?” Dumbledore asked him.
When he was done they would give him his meal (he was allowed only one scarce meal a day that consisted in leftovers IF he performed well all his chores) and would lock him up in his cold cell down in the dungeons until his father came down to beat him and torture him.
“But Draco’s been eating! He always has dinner and I see him drink tea in the morning. He does skip lunch though because he’s a total bookworm and prefers to study...” Harry protested.
“This is Draco’s handwriting...” he muttered in relief as he uncorked the potion and immediately smelled a sweet scent.
“I don’t wanna talk about it...” Draco mumbled.
A small silence followed as the Potions Professor started speaking again.
Draco grinned.
He took a cloth and wet it in some cold water before gently pressing it to Draco’s forehead.
Only after his words had sank in he said something.
“Dracula” he said.
“Sorry... must have moved while I slept...” she muttered as she yawned.
“You’re a very talented wizard, Draco. Your parents must be very proud of you” Mr. Diggory said. Draco immediately saddened.
“Well, why don’t you ask the lovely Hermione? You haven’t already agreed to go with someone have you?” Draco directed this last question to the brunette.
“So...uhm... what do you want to do today?” Harry asked.
“Really?” Hermione asked him.
After a while, he flipped them over and let her set the pace, which continued to be hard and fast.
Shaking those thoughts away he went to Draco’s wardrobe, opened it as quietly as possible and took a quick glance around. Nodding in approval he closed the wardrobe and exited Draco’s room.
He sighed in content and closed his eyes as he  titled his head up.
“Oh I don’t know!? Christmas?”
While the rest of the Manor has looked elegant and sophisticated, this section was cold, old, dreary and fairly spooky.
“Hey! I’m Draco” he said.
“I’m sure there’s a good reason for his absence, Harry” Hermione said.
Too late, it's gone, it won't come back”
He sighed.
“No, we barely said anything before Astoria arrived”
“What exactly does my father’s company do?”  he asked.
He checked the wardrobe and indeed all of Draco’s clothes were gone. There wasn’t one single thing that had belonged to his boyfriend in the flat.
“What happened?” he rasped out and coughed.
He was just glad his head pains had reduced a lot and now they were at least manageable by pain-relieving potions.
“Do you really mean all that?” Draco asked while panting.
Harry watched them as they danced and for one who had spent basically all his life locked in a cell, Draco was quite elegant and good at leading his partner around the dance floor.
“Wait! No, I’m no-”
“I-I think I love you”
“I’m so sorry” Kate hurriedly said as Draco regained what little breath he could without coughing.
Since he’d never had a friend before Harry he didn’t know how to behave and act in front of them so he opted for sitting back and proceeding with his reading. Harry’s friends evidently had something else in mind.
‘Come on, Draco. You can do this’ he encouraged himself as he took a deep breath before stepping into the room.
“And you expect him to go outside in the freezing weather at 4.30 AM after you woke him up with cold snow?” she asked him. Rhetorically, of course.
In the next few weeks Draco got more used to his new life and got more comfortable with Lily and James. He had already started working on catching up with school and found he actually enjoyed a lot reading and studying all these charms, spells and potions. His favorite subjects were Potions and Astronomy. He also enjoyed Herbology.
Evidently it had somehow found out of his presence even with the charm Draco had put on him.
He had to make things right with Draco.
A red head boy, two brunette boys and two brunette girls burst in the room.
I’m glad you wrote. I miss you too and I wish you were here with me.
Draco raised his head and stifled a yawn. They had been working nonstop for hours as Headmaster Dumbledore had given them the permission to throw the ball on the last day of school and thought it would be a wonderful idea.
I feel like I could go in forever listing all the things I like about you and that would only be the tip of the iceberg” Harry said seriously as he looked straight into Draco’s eyes.
It had been a few years and in all of them he had never thought about doing something like this. During his time abroad he had had a lot of time to think and had concluded this was what he needed to do to fully move on.
He tried to hide his disappointment but failed.
Draco smiled and looked out of the window. The trees were green as the spring cold had started to leave Scotland in favor of a warmer weather.
“Sorry...” Draco rasped.
“I didn’t do anything wrong. I just feel like rewarding you! You’ve been so brave with all that you went through so I thought you deserved a few gifts” Harry said.
Draco leaned in very slowly...
He was horrified as he saw a picture of him and the guy kissing and groping each other in the night club.
The noise stopped as he and Professor McGonagall entered. He could feel eyes looking at him from everywhere.
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows and began reading the article that accompanied the pictures.
“But what does it mean?” Draco looked back at the glass and saw the same exact image again. He hated not knowing what it meant.
“You care for the boy” Headmaster Dumbledore said. It was a statement, not a question.
Meanwhile anger was boiling inside Harry as he heard Draco apologize once more and head out of the Great Hall with that girl.
He drank it.
“Yeah... I’m not hungry. Sorry...” he said quietly.
“You say that now...” Draco muttered.
Ron simply raised his shoulders in response.
“Look, Tori, I think there could be something special between us and I don’t want it to be ruined by the press and the public’s opinions” Draco explained.
To Draco however it didn’t matter: this was his first Christmas ever after all.
“Doyoufindthatguycute?” he rushed out the words as he blushed a deep shade of scarlet.
“I’ll be back in... two hours?” Cedric said as he stood up.
He paced around the room, a nervous habit he had when he was worried.
“I have a crush on Harry” he suddenly blurted out, interrupting her mid sentence. He covered his mouth with his hand and fought the urge to blush a deep crimson.
Meanwhile Cedric...
What did I tell you, folks?
“We’ll go to Gringotts first, it’s the Wizarding bank” James said as they entered a tall building. Inside there was a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling, casting golden light on... little people?
“We have to get him to Madam Pomfrey” Professor Snape said. He mentally compared his godson to the boy that was saved by Krum and saw the latter was fine, if not a little shaken up and cold, but Draco looked like he was ready to pass out any moment now.
Cedric, who had just turned seventeen, unfortunately was old enough to enter and decided it was a good idea. If he hadn’t known he was a Hufflepuff Draco would have though he belonged in Gryffindor.
Draco sighed softly and opened his eyes.
“We’re so sorry, Harry” Hermione squeaked but Harry simply stomped off, angry at his friends.
He did it because his friend needed him.
Draco nodded.
Suddenly he heard a sort of yelp and some high pitched crying sounds.
“Yes, Sir” Draco nodded.
“So all we have to do is submerge the egg in water and listen? You’re a genius, Draco!” Cedric cried as he hugged him.
“And he’s so sweet and polite...” Lily answered.
“What?” Draco said as she noticed her staring.
“You look like a lunatic, do you realize that?” he said sarcastically. He saw Harry gasp and turn to face him.
They seemed to be quite comfortable with each other...
For the first time ever Sev actually flushed a tiny bit and responded awkwardly to the hug.
He also seemed to be unconscious as his eyes were closed and he wasn’t moving at all.
Cedric froze and Draco watched in silence as a single drop of ink fell onto the parchment.
A pregnant silence fell between the two of them.
He had wondered why his wand (which could sense if people had bad intentions towards Draco) hadn’t sensed his attacker when he went to hit him from behind but he had concluded that the wand hadn’t warned him because this person hadn’t actually meant to harm him and only to knock him out, which signified that at least his attacker felt guilty about hitting him.
Harry smirked when he noticed he was still quite taller than her.
For that the Healers initially hadn’t been able to do anything because of the already high doses of potions and medicines he was taking for his other health problems.
“Uhm... actually I was thinking of going alone for a few months to travel around the world a bit...” Draco interrupted quietly while looking down.
McGonagall nodded and resumed eating her meal all while thinking about what the young Ravenclaw had just said.
Draco had grown a bit but his slender figure still remained small and fragile, perfect for Harry to encase with his own body and protect him from any harm.
Harry was pacing around the room, muttering furiously to himself.
“Well, I threw a snowball at him while he slept about two hours ago” he answered.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been more embarrassed in my entire life” Kate wheezed as she regained her breath after laughing so much.
“Then you can set your heart to peace and move on” Lavender said while turning a page of her Witch Weekly magazine.
She claimed Draco was a genius/hero who saved Cedric’s life by almost sacrificing his own.
“Harry, are you okay?” she asked him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder.
By the time his first year at Hogwarts at ended Draco could say he was happy: he had amazing friends, a great family and a loving godfather and his grades were high as well.
“Even if you tried they wouldn’t listen. They never listen to us anyway” Anthony said “we appreciate your offer though”
—————————————————————————————
Draco blushed and Harry felt jealousy building up in his chest. He glanced at the Slytherin.
“Ron, leave it” Harry said. Leave what?
He felt a tingling sensation in his body and a second later they were leaving the fire place and walking into a crowded street full of shops and people. Lily took his hand while James walked close to him.
“Why?!”
“It’s a lovely day” Draco said with a bright smile.
“If you really were half as loyal as you Slytherins claim to be, you would comfort your friend instead of laughing in his face.
“Ah you’re a quiet one ay? Well it’s a good thing you weren’t placed with the Gryffindors because for them meals are like wars: you never know when you’re about to be hit by a flying piece of food until it’s hit you. Look for yourself” Michael said. He turned around to face the Gryffindor table and indeed he did see a lot of food flying around.
“Happy that because of me you nearly died? No thanks I’d rather be a loser and have you alive and well” Cedric said.
“He’s so cute!” Hermione said as she pet him.
Broken sobs tore out of him as he hugged Draco’s body even tighter.
Draco sat on Harry’s bed as a few tense moments passed in silence. They hadn’t talked about what had almost happened the last time they were alone and, despite Harry’s Gryffindor Courage, none of them wanted to breach the subject again.
“Because they’re Gryffindors: from what I’ve gathered, if one points out to them how un-noble an action they commit truly is then they will immediately cease to do it” he said as the Sorting Hat’s words popped up in his head again: ‘Manipulation skills”.
‘How dare she! Kiss him right in front of me and... wait-‘
“Nuh-huh absolutely not. He’ll get awkward around me” he said.
Harry’s jaw dropped.
“Severus. Any news?” Lily asked. Severus shook his head.
That night he went to bed a little earlier than usual and cuddled tightly Snoodle, who was very good at comforting him.
Draco felt it too but it didn’t hurt him.
He turned around and gazed into those green eyes.
“Draco...?” Michael hesitantly called him.
The poor bunny, like his friends, hadn’t been able to visit him at the hospital so his dorm mates took care of him while Draco was in St. Mungo’s. He played with Snoodle and smiled. He had missed his little friend like crazy when he was away and he was eager to make up for the time they had lost.
He had made his way deep into the maze by fighting all kind of creatures: a Boggart, a Sphinx and even a huge boar, to name a few.
It had been over a month since the last time they spoke to each other and he was a nerve wreck.
“You look exhausted: you should go get some rest” he rasped out before going into a coughing fit.
He turned around and smiled.
“No, I was thinking of going away for a month or so and then of course I would come back” Draco said.
“Wait, back up a minute. Why would it make me feel better?” Harry asked after he had processed Lavender’s wording.
Draco and Kate turned around to see the smirking face of Theodore Nott and his two bodyguards, Crabbe and Goyle.
Well that explained his room.
Witnesses say they saw the two of them dancing together until Harry Potter dragged them both to the Floo and brought that hottie home for a fun time.
This was his opportunity. He’d make sure he took it.
Draco nodded.
Draco felt his heart shatter.
As he cried, he couldn’t help but wish that Draco were still with him, hugging and comforting him.
Making his decision, he slowly laid down next to Draco, being extra careful not to touch him in case he woke him up. He settled on the pillow and waited with his breath caught in his lungs.
“I know. But don’t you at least have an idea about what you want to do?”
“But won’t it become weird?”
Draco got on the bed in front of the bunny, who simply turned away from him again.
“Oh, my boy...” James said when he realized Draco was crying.
Nothing.
Draco simply stayed silent as the three boys in front of him laughed.
He would show him how he had changed… or that at least he was willing to change for him.
He had already started to read some of the books they would be using in Third Year and to be fair he was quite impressed: they were clear and didn’t cut short on information about spells/potions.
~The End~
“No, need. I’ve been around Sixth and Seventh Year students enough to know all about sex, Severus” Draco said and smirked slightly when he saw the man’s breathing hitch slightly. He really enjoyed embarrassing his usually calm and collected godfather.
“Nahh. I don’t think-” he turned his head and saw Draco blush at something the girl had said “-so...”.
As his anxiety grew he frantically began searching around the castle, calling Draco’s name over and over again, getting more desperate by the second.
Quickly he penned an answer.
I already have a few ideas for a new story so stay tuned if you enjoyed my writing!
Lily frowned and looked at him very closely.
Harry felt like he could do anything now as long as Draco was with him.
Quickly he took Draco by the arm and started swimming towards the surface of the lake, not even noticing the Selkies that were swimming around him.
Draco’s gift left Harry speechless.
“Isn’t it great!?” Cedric asked him after the ‘feast’.
Finally he could have a normal existence, where madmen didn’t try to kill him everyday.
“How about we celebrate in our Common Room?” Lavender proposed.
Screams and cries filled the air as the people watching saw Cedric laying on the floor, bleeding and unconscious.
“It’s not your doing. Please let it drop, I really don’t want to talk about it” Draco interrupted her as he laid back down on his pillow.
At that Draco grimaced slightly.
“Cedric, please stop blaming yourself over this. I don’t blame you for what happened, I blame the people who organized the task. Please?” he said. Cedric nodded.
That night he went to bed with a smile on his face.
————————————————————————————
Cedric took a deep breath and headed out to meet the other champions.
“Fine, fine. But you know I’ll get you into bed eventually” he said jokingly.
“No! I want to know what’s happening to my godson, Poppy!” Snape bellowed. Dumbledore placed a calming hand on the fellow professor’s shoulder.
“Okay. That’s absolutely fin-”
Immediately Nott and his two dancing monkeys basically ran away with their tails between their legs.
“Your wand, please” he then asked. James took out his wand from the sleeve of his robes and handed it to the goblin, who nodded and returned it.
“What’s going on?”
“No it’s not. What your parents did was not okay and I’ll regret for the rest of my life that I wasn’t there to protect you like I should have. I can only hope to make up for it in the future” Sev said quietly as he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Crabbe and Goyle immediately shut up and stared at him.
“I’ll catch up with you later” James said as he said goodbye to his friend and as quietly as possible entered the boy’s room.
She looked up back at his eyes.
“Yes” he said quietly whilst not looking at her in the eye.
It was even better when neither of the three Slytherins showed up for dinner and the rumors started flying around, saying Nott wouldn’t dare bully anyone anymore. Draco could only hope...
“Nothing it’s just- it’s really stupid...” Harry muttered.
“Kind of. Sometimes they do mess up our dorm when they’re studying: pieces of parchment/books on the beds, on the desks and on the floor; splotches of ink on their fingers and clothes; revision pages thrown about. Luckily for me they never mess up my neat bed because it’s too far away from their ‘study circle’” Draco said as he continued to put away his stuff.
“Mhh... not really. I mean, I’d miss my wand but I’ll have that on me for the whole duration of the task... I’d miss... uhm... my... I don’t know” Cedric said as he frowned.
“His parents cut off all contacts with me just after Draco’s birth. They wouldn’t let me see him at all. If I’d known back then what was going on behind the Manor’s closed doors I would have done everything possible to get that poor and innocent boy away from those monsters”
Never in a million years Draco had thought he would find himself in this position. And yet here he was.
“I’m Hermione Granger”
“You were taken ‘hostage’ as a ‘treasure’ for Cedric to find in the Second Task. Did you agree to participating?” Lily asked him.
Damnit. What had just happened!? This was NOT supposed to happen! She had let her guard down! She had let him take control!
You are absolutely incredible and you shouldn’t have to change for anyone, least of all me.
“Spoken like a true bisexual, Dray” Blaise countered while smacking Draco right on the ass, making the blond smirk at him.
Both blushed.
He noticed the upper body was covered in a hard and rough looking deep red/brownish shell while the lower part was of a dirty beige and looked to be more smooth and tender. The pincers were of this same exact color except for the tips which were red/brown.
“I’m trying...” he said “it-it just hurts so much...” he said as he clutched his stomach when a rush of pain cursed through him.
That night when he returned home to his own happy son and wife he couldn’t help but wonder what sort of life that poor boy had had until now.
As he finished writing, he magically cleaned up the lab and left the potions classroom. He also cast a cushioning charm on the bottle so if he accidentally dropped it, it wouldn’t break.
“You’re right! I’ll go write him an apology letter immediately!” Harry basically shouted as he ran towards the bedroom to grab some parchment and a self-inking quill.
“Of course I care! He’s the closest thing to a son I’ll ever have” Professor Snape said.
“Uncle Sev?”
“Oh please Harry, you can stop with the theatrics. You can go be with Elizabeth if you want to, but honestly I’d rather not be in your presence if I can help it” Draco said coldly.
We need to talk, please. I miss you and I need you to at least know the truth about what happened the other day.
He quietly got a chair and settled on it by the boy’s bed. This child deserved to have someone with him, especially now.
Professor Snape sighed.
He was looking around. He had never been around so many people...
“Draco! Draco, where are you?” a voice sounded from the far end of the corridor as steps could be heard echoing down the hall.
“That’s what I’ve started calling you in my mind. I can stop if you want” Draco could feel shyness rapidly making its presence known in him.
“Of course not! There are a lot more students than that!” Ron said.
Merlin he had missed him. In the three days he had successfully managed to avoid him, he had been feeling miserable.
“I can imagine. Are they boys in Ravenclaw Tower tidy?” she had heard Draco had made some friends in Ravenclaw as well and she couldn’t be prouder of her shy son.
He would have to ask Draco out another time...
The third and last task of the Triwizard Tournament was in a few minutes and Cedric was close to panicking.
“Oh that’s not good. Draco was absolutely crazy for you, you know! We have got to make him see that you feel the same!” Michael said.
Harry noticed his crush was feeling a bit off so he placed his hand on Draco’s and gently entwined his fingers with his.
He turned his head and saw Cedric was standing there with an amused smile on his face.
“You must be hungry! Let’s go home and have a bite. Then if you’re feeling well enough we can go to the Manor and get your belongings and bring them to the house” James said as he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder but removed it when he saw the boy tense.
“Those are goblins, Draco. They work here and are not very social, however they are perfectly polite. Don’t let them intimidate you”
“James, if our son doesn’t want to keep his broom in his bedroom like you and Harry do, then he won’t. We have a perfectly accommodating broom closet” she said without even realizing she called Draco as her son. It just came natural to her.
We've taken what you'll sorely miss,
When Draco woke up about two hours later the sky was starting to darken and the weather was definitely chillier. He realized he and Kate had moved while they slept so that Kate was leaning against Draco’s front as Draco hugged her from behind. He blinked and quietly watched the pretty girl sleeping in his arms.
“I’ve already tried! It came back because I don’t know where he lives!” he said, frustrated.
“Everything alright?” Kate asked him.
It began with casual shoves and tripping jinxes. Then started the knocking books out of his hands and shoving him harder against walls and making him fall.
He also managed to catch up with his homework and refused to be given different assignments from his classmates just because  he had suffered a head trauma and was still recovering.
“Yes, well, we didn’t know for sure what type of perils he would find in there so we also considered the possibility of animals being used as obstacles. Anyway, better to be safe than sorry” Draco said.
He groaned as he watched the picture repeat itself constantly in the newspaper’s front page.
“Why don’t you send him an Owl?”
“Draco, this is Hagrid. He is the gamekeeper and the Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts” Harry introduced him.
“NO IT’S NOT! IT’S NOT FINE! THAT FOUL REPORTER CAN’T JUST SAY THINGS LIKE THAT AND GET AWAY WITH IT! YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON AND I CARE ABOUT YOU A LOT SO I WON’T STAND FOR ANYONE INSULTING YOU AND DOUBTING YOUR INTENTIONS LIKE THAT!” Harry raged.
“A bit but not nearly as much as it does you. All she did was speculate whether I‘m in a relationship with Cedric and if I’m hiding something about myself. I can see how from an outsider’s point of view these two things can be plausible” Draco reasoned.
Harry quietly rushed back downstairs and grabbed Snoodle, who protested once again this time by lowering his ears and making a little cry; he knew Draco would want to have his beloved pet with him when he woke up.
Cedric had won the Triwizard Tournament and had officially declared Draco the reason for his victory.
No matter what he wanted to be completely prepared when he went to school.
He was taken aback when he saw Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lavender sitting at the Ravenclaw Table instead at the Gryffindor one.
But before he could take the last few steps toward his friends, he heard someone call his name. He turned around and saw that a cheery looking man with brown hair and glasses was smiling at him.
Overall he liked it in Ravenclaw.
Cedric hesitantly and slowly swam a bit closer to it and stopped right in front of it. The Selkie seemed to take no notice of his presence so he assumed it was safe for him to continue going forward this way.
“Look he’s even humble too!” Harry said in a loud voice as he patted Draco’s knee. His plan to remain invisible had officially failed thanks to this group of teenagers. He sighed.
A few minutes passed in silence as father and son simply stared at each other like two strangers would do.
“Thanks” Draco replied just as quietly.
She could sense the heat from his  lean body and could feel his warm breath on her neck. She ached to pull him closer to her.
Draco nodded still flushed.
Kate shrugged.
Time went by and soon it was Christmas time.
Lily and James had come in immediately and reassured him it was all just a dream but he was too much in a panic.
“Well, they say people that are good dancers are also good in bed. So I’m guessing you performed the ‘Horizontal Naked Tango’ spectacularly last night” Blaise looked at him hopefully, obviously asking for more details.
“I think that’s enough for today... we can go get your wand tomorrow. After all, the day you get your wand should be special and dedicated only to that” James said. Draco simply nodded. He felt his head was spinning.
After a while he nonverbally cast a ‘Tempus’ and found already half an hour had passed.
Next they went to Flourish and Blotts to buy Draco’s school books as he would have to catch up with the Hogwarts First and Second Year’s Curriculums. James also suggested he buy a book called “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”. It was written by a Muggle guy called ‘Jules Verne’.
Harry nodded and ran down to the Library immediately. He couldn’t stand being away from Draco for more than two days: the blond had been far too busy lately.
‘He’s not your knight in shining armor!’ the voice interrupted his thoughts.
Draco smiled and shook his head no. He helped Harry get up and collected his fallen satchel.
He cried himself to sleep.
“Mate, you’re reading into this far more than necessary. I’m sure they just went to Paris because of that new restaurant opening that evening” Ron explained.
“DRACO MALFOY RELEASES THE OFFICIAL CURE TO SPATTERGROIT’S DISEASE
“-all I wanted was to be like everyone else. To fade in” he said. Cedric placed a hand under his chin and raised his head to meet his eyes.
Draco didn’t open his eyes for fear of what he could see in her eyes. The last thing he wanted was for her to feel sorry for him and pity him.
“Sorry, boys only. You can wait outside. I’m sure we’ll be done in a couple of hours” he said and watched as her face grew red.
“Fine. I’m just worried about finding a date to the Yule Ball” he lied. Draco and the others nodded as well.
“You were amazing! I’ve never seen someone stand up to Nott that way!” Draco said once he was sure the Slytherins were out of ear shot. He really was in awe.
Since Draco had told him his family had never really celebrated Christmas before, Harry had insisted they do everything that was typical of the holiday and in the meantime they could get to know each other.
“Yes, we have them in custody at the Ministry. They are refusing to talk however. They are waiting for their lawyer. Also, I’m pretty sure this is their son, as he has all of the Malfoy traits: a pale complexion, grey eyes and white blond hair”
He admitted he was attractive. Draco liked his expressive and vibrant green eyes and... and his smile, it was comforting.
Harry nodded and the boys started walking in that direction.
Later on they were spotted walking around the ‘Parc Floral de Paris’, a floral park that mainly focuses on intriguing and colorful flowers.
“I saw Draco today”
Draco rolled his eyes but kept a fond look on his face.
Harry shook his head sadly and stood up.
He looked at James and Lily who were smiling widely at him as well.
What he certainly couldn’t ignore were the girls who were practically throwing themselves at him.
“But w-what about my-my...” he tried to say.
“Why do I get the feeling that you don’t want to leave him?” Lily asked with a small smile on her face.
He also had to accept the fact that Kate was gone too.
Draco was absolutely adorable when he blushed.
Draco looked at her for a few more seconds and then nodded.
“Here” Draco said as he held out his hand with Harry’s bag.
Harry shrugged.
“If you show anymore symptoms please come here at once so we can address them as quickly as possible” Dr. Dirwin said.
He walked down the corridor until he was in front of the potions classroom. The room was empty.
—————————————————————————————
He rushed off to answer the door, intending on disintegrating whoever had disrupted their morning “activities”.
Anyway, Harry wasn’t particularly worried to be honest.
The Potions master had treated him well enough but was still horrible to Gryffindors.
Lily watched nervously as Draco sipped at his soup and took notice of the way Draco avoided the bread but seemed to like the soup. This time, not wanting to make Draco uncomfortable, she had poured less food in his plate so he was actually able to finish his meal. She marked this as progress.
“Honestly? I feel alright... Actually, I feel good. I’ve never had any relatives except for my parents...” Draco said.
Draco, although, wouldn’t let this drop so lightly.
A gorgeous mint green leather desk mat was in his hands. He looked in awe at it and then at Lily who was smiling at him.
To strengthen the potion and make it last longer he added some Octopus Powder.
“Thank you” Draco said in a whisper as he wiped away his tears.
“No, don’t apologize. I like it better this way” he said and it was true. Draco smiled.
“We decided we wanted to have dinner with you so we looked it up and found there’s no explicit rule that prohibits students from sitting at another house’s table except for at feats” Hermione said as he sat across her next to Lavender.
Her best friend was laying there with his eyes closed, sleeping in her lap.
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
People around him were shouting, talking to him: Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr. Diggory, Professor McGonagall and Harry, who evidently had rushed to Cedric’s side when he saw him. Such a good person....Harry.
Healer Montary nodded and excused himself.
“It signifies the charm has started working, so now Cedric basically is camouflaged as his surroundings” Draco said.
However, he couldn’t pretend he didn’t see the news of Harry’s sexual escapade with that man. He also couldn’t pretend that it didn’t hurt.
“Draco?” he became aware of Harry’s voice calling him as he emerged from his thoughts.
————————————————————————————
“Draco? Are you Draco Malfoy?” Hagrid asked and he nodded in response.
As the bunny saw him his ears sprang up and he started hopping over towards him.
The hospital had been giving him IV Fluids through an intravenous tube but the years of lack of nutrition couldn’t be erased in a sigle week.
“Don’t ever think that something like that makes you a burden. I dare say it makes you strong and brave. I really wouldn’t have minded ” she smiled at him.
James was in the corner of the room and was looking anxious. Lily hadn’t accompanied them because she wasn’t feeling very well this morning and had a bit of an upset stomach.
Lily was shocked for a second before she started calming down her son.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of, Draco. It is a very common thing that can occur, especially with eating disorders like yours that are based on habits. Starting from now I will follow you with your recovery which I expect you to make completely” she said.
“Bedroom. Now” she said breathlessly between kisses as he went sideways and attached his lips to her neck, making her gasp.
Should he open this even after what Harry did?
“So what do I do now? I obviously want him back” he said.
“We’ll have to warn him to try not to crowd Draco as well. From what I’ve seen he’s not really comfortable with physical contact probably because the only contact he got before was... well...”
To thicken the potion he added some Flobberworm Mucus.
As the night progressed into the early hours of the morning, they talked and talked.
Finally Professor McGonagall called his name as he was left there standing alone.
“Besides the ones I told you about, no. I couldn’t think of anything else” Draco mumbled.
“Sure. What type of potion?” Sev said as he got up and reached for the book Draco was carrying.
“It’s fine, Draco. I understand” Kate said.
“You and your studying...” Ron said, taking the topic off of Draco.
She leaned down and kissed him.
His heart jumped in his chest when he saw it.
“Ah, you’re awake! Do you think you can manage a trip to Diagon Alley to get the things you need?” he asked him and Draco nodded. He did feel a bit better now after his nap.
“Oh Draco I’m so happy for you!” the black-haired girl squealed.
“Champions! THREE-TWO-ONE- GO!” Barty Crouch said, his voice magically amplified by his wand.
Did this mean Harry had only been bluffing when he had told him of how he was his and how he wanted him? But that couldn’t be! Harry was his best friend! He wouldn’t do something like that... right?!
The next day the three of them returned to Diagon Alley to get Draco’s wand from Ollivander’s.
When he found an empty compartment he settled in it and pulled his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around himself.
As the three made their way to the door, Harry glanced back to Kate, who was being held in his crush’s arms. The two shared an intimate smile and for the first time ever Harry truly felt heartbroken.
————————————————————————————
“I’ll take care of it, Tori” Draco said as he got off the bed and transfigured a piece of paper into a dressing gown.
Mr. Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass, childhood friend who recently came back to England after a five year period spent working in America, seem to have hit it off.
“Let’s hope Cedric can pass this one” Ron said beside him, but Harry wasn’t listening.
Would he be able to survive?
“Draco isn’t like your friends, Harry. He’s reserved and kind and doesn’t enjoy pranks the way you do. I don’t know what he’s told you but he didn’t exactly have a happy childhood-” Lily explained to him but was cut off by Harry.
“Yes, he likes him a lot! He just let the words slip out without thinking and hurt Draco! How could he say that to such a good friend!?” Harry said with a frown on his face.
“As you’re well aware, being Head Boy and Head Girl comes with responsibilities such as patrolling corridors at night, removing house points should anyone disobey the rules, giving a good example and planning all extra curricular activities. I’m sure you two will do a fine job with your intelligence and ambition”
He and Harry were sitting in the Library, revising for their final exams as Draco hoped to get high marks in all of the subjects. Fifth Year had really flown by...
“Mr. Malfoy” he said.
Snape then crouched down and muttered an incantation. Draco watched in awe as the ink parted from his belongings and the glass inkwell repaired itself: soon his satchel and its contents were clean once more.
Draco simply nodded and left the shop.
“Hi guys!” Harry said just as loud. Draco cringed a bit.
He still missed the git.
Draco burned them all without opening them.
He heard a shocked gasp and quick receding footsteps from behind him but couldn’t turn his head to see who it was.
Since he didn’t have much to do now, he sat on his bed with Snoodle and played with him for a bit. He made little bursts of light and color with his wand as his pet watched and moved his head along with his wand/hand movements.
“Who wouldn’t want you, Draco? You’re smart, funny, handsome and bloody cute! Anyone would be lucky to be with you! You’re strong and brave, even if you don’t think you are; you’ve been through so much that all I would like to do is hold you in my arms forever and protect you from any danger. Your smile is contagious, just like your laugh. You’re so adorable when you blush and the way you care for Snoodle is just so loving.
“You’re, like, my brother”
“He will be mine...” Harry whispered determinedly.
He noticed she shivered slightly.
As they said their goodbyes, he turned to leave  and just as he had walked a few meters, he heard her voice calling him.
As he entered the Great Hall, he began feeling quite anxious.
“I would accompany you back to your dorm but...” Draco said. He didn’t want to be late for curfew.
Mr. Ollivander took a good look at him and started muttering to himself as he walked to the high shelves filled with boxes, pulled out a case from one of them and handed him the wand inside.
Loud cheers and applauses sounded in the Great Hall.
“We can always come back if you forgot anything, sweetie” she said.
Still a little bit of hope remained in his chest.
“So have you thought about what you want to be once we graduate?” Harry asked after ten minutes spent in peaceful silence.
“Ah there you are!” James said as he saw him.
“I’ll help you”
Suddenly both of them realized just how intimate their position was so they disentangled themselves and stood up.
Draco closed his eyes and for the first time ever he wished he was still in his father’s basement where at least he was safe from emotional pain.
“I guess we better go...” Draco said.
Draco felt nervous: people surely would talk about his ‘brave and selfless’ action.
“I think I’m in love!” Ron said as the students from Beauxbatons walked in the Great Hall.
Truthfully he was a little bit disappointed Draco didn’t like Quidditch but he knew he would soon get over it. Instead he thought about something they could do that Draco would enjoy. Suddenly an amazing idea popped in his head.
He had left their apartment to go out with his friends, as he usually did, to allow Draco some time alone to “think about it”, even though he already knew the answer.
About two minutes ago the Cup had teleported Cedric in the center of the courtyard.
A few minutes passed in comfortable silence.
“No, please no” he said as he crouched down, not caring that he got blood on him.
He was slightly startled because Harry had never shouted this much at him before and it kind of frightened Draco a bit to think about what could happen if someone ever hurt one of Harry’s loved ones. He shook those thoughts away: now wasn’t the time.
“It’s fine, Harry. I know you weren’t directly mad at me” he smiled.
“It’s fine” he said in a low voice.
Lily looked like she wanted to say something more but didn’t.
However, laughing had been a bad idea for Draco as he started coughing.
Draco couldn’t help but feel intimidated yet at the same time turned on by his crush so blatantly staking his claim on him.
They were currently sitting in a pub, drinking beer and discussing Harry’s most recent fight with his boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
“Harry!?” Lavender said.
‘The same you felt with Harry’ a little voice inside him pointed out, but he steadily ignored it. Now wasn’t the time to think about his ex.
Unfortunately now the only thing he could think about was his sexuality.
————————————————————————————
His first thought was ‘But it’s Quidditch!’ but the more he thought about it the more everything made sense: he had simply assumed Draco was embarrassed because he didn’t know how to fly as well on a broomstick but now he knew the true reason his friend didn’t like to be up in the air.
A few minutes later the portrait swung open as Hermione exited the Gryffindor Common Room.
“Am I not normal?” he asked at the bunny, not expecting an answer.
“Sev?”
“Really? I hadn’t noticed” Draco said dismissively. Lily recognized she had hit a raw nerve.
“Cedric! Cedric wake up! I think I’ve found it!” he said as he woke his friend up.
‘Sorry’ he mouthed at him while laughing.
This was such unexpected behavior from Draco! Since when was he this confident!?
“If this is too weird for you we can-” he said as he removed his hand from Harry’s.
“I’m Lavender” the girl batted her eyelashes at him and smiled.
“Hello Draco, it’s a pleasure to meet you! I’m James” he said as he extended his hand.
Draco blinked twice and stared at his friend.
“Is he going to be okay?”
“To Draco!” Blaise toasted, raising his champagne glass and clinking it with his and Pansy’s glasses.
He had absolutely no idea at the moment and desperately wanted some guidance.
He got up and started walking toward Ravenclaw table. Half way through however he lost his nerve and quickly walked back to his seat.
“Awww are you going to cry? You’re weak! You’re not worthy of the Malfoy name!” Lucius said as he advanced menacingly towards him.
Draco sighed.
Draco kissed him on the cheek.
“Oh, is Daddy going to spank me? Have I been a bad boy, Daddy?” he bat his eyelashes.
That’s right folks! Just after the first Triwizard Tournament task Hogwarts’ champion Cedric Diggory was seen embracing Draco Malfoy, a fourth year Ravenclaw student.
“Well obviously, my very presence is always wonderful” she played along.
So he helped in every way he could: studying and reviewing important and useful information. By the time the First Task was due Draco felt pretty confident he had done everything he could for Cedric and now it was time for his friend to proceed alone.
‘Please don’t let her be one of my fans...’ he thought to himself.
“Draco studied privately, Harry” Lily saved him.
As they boarded the train they soon found an empty compartment and settled in it.
Draco raised a single blond eyebrow as the other boy sat there gaping like a fish.
“I know, I know. But this time I promise I’ll put more effort into this — our — relationship. I’ll make it work, you’ll see. I swear: I won’t criticize you ever again” Harry said making Draco chuckle.
She went up the stairs and gently knocked on Draco’s door.
He had spoken with his parents and Sev about his plan to travel abroad and, despite them being a little wary of it, they agreed that it would be good if he explored the world a bit. He would be leaving on the 17th of June and would be returning on the 8th of August. He planned on visiting Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Germany, Switzerland and then finally America.
He blinked a few times and opened his eyes again fully.
Draco had also talked to Sev about how he treated Gryffindors and his godfather had agreed to slowly stop bullying them in class just because of his past experiences.
“Have you been eating?” she asked after a minute of watching her son unpack. Draco froze.
I miss you a lot and I think about you almost every day, wondering if you’re alright, if you’re mad at me for leaving you during such a moment.
By then Draco had started tentatively calling Lily and James as “Mum” and “Dad”. He still wasn’t very comfortable with it but still his ‘parents’ urged him to do so.
The man did as he was told and then left the room.
Harry smiled widely at him and got up to hug him.
He returned the smile and thanked her.
“Only if you let it”
“Only because he’s too polite to say no, honey...” Lily muttered as James practically dragged her and Draco to the sweets’ shop. One could say her husband had a hell of a sweet tooth, just like her son.
“More or less” he said, thinking about how his mother had gotten him to open up.
He examined the Hufflepuff closely: he was in critical conditions.
And yet there he was, snogging Elizabeth as if there wasn’t a tomorrow...
“Won’t it be weird then? Also, I’m not sure I could just get over him that easily” Harry said.
“Yeah... as a result I... I can’t eat that much” he said as he looked to his feet.
Currently he was in his room, packing his trunk for tomorrow as he and Harry would go back to Hogwarts for their Fifth Year. He had already started reading their textbooks and he couldn’t wait until classes started.
“Yes. No. Maybe? I don’t know! This is all so confusing” he said.
Draco chose a fluffy black/dark grey carpet for the floor and light grey curtains for his window.
Why was it so painful this time? When his parents had first started feeding him more he hadn’t felt any discomfort at all but now he was. Why? Was it because last time he had been eating more during only one meal and now he was eating at least eight times a day? Draco didn’t know and didn’t really care.
“Of course! Remember this Draco: you are a nice person who bad things happened to. Besides, it was Lavender’s fault that she got hurt. You tried to warn her but she didn’t listen to you” Cedric said.
It completely blocked Cedric’s way and unfortunately turning around he noticed the bushes had closed behind him.
He certainly hadn’t. He didn’t love Harry.
“Where are we going?” he asked them.
“YOU SET YOUR OWN TIMING!?” Ron basically shouted in shock and Draco immediately closed his eyes. Shouting reminded him of his father...
Instead he would have to wait hours until the blond woke up.
“Hermione, Draco here is just as much as a bookworm as you, if not more: he’s already started studying this year’s books. I’d say he’s more advanced than all of us here” Harry boasted and Draco inwardly winced when he saw Hermione’s right eye twitch in annoyance.
“Your parents?” she finished for him.
“It’s important for people of your age to eat properly so that you can grow” she offered.
“Harry. Have you ever wondered why Draco doesn’t keep his broom in his room like you and your father do? Why he prefers to watch you do tricks while he only sits on his broom? Why he doesn’t seem as eager as you to play Quidditch? Not everyone enjoys flying, sweetie, and the only thing you can do is accept that” she said.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
“You just focus on the task and nothing else. You can do this, I know you can. Also, it doesn’t matter if you win or lose, just make it out of there alive, alright?”
When the time came he had to leave for Hogwarts he couldn’t help but feel nervous. He and his family had went to Diagon Alley two weeks before and had acquired all of his and Harry’s school requirements.
“It’s not necessary, Sev, really. I’m okay now” Draco said.
“How do I tell him? I mean isn’t it going to be awkward? Technically we’re brothers! Maybe he doesn’t see me that way! Maybe he’s not even gay!” Harry said in a panic.
Harry looked conflicted however he sighed and agreed.
“This will sting a bit and produce some smoke but only for a few seconds I promise” he said to the bunny as he let fall a few drops of potion on it and immediately the potion began doing its thing. The baby rabbit squealed so Draco quickly placed the tip of his wand to its leg and muttered the correct cleaning incantation. He noticed the tip of his wand got a red streak of color that then disappeared after a second or two.
‘You know what you have to do, Draco’ he thought to himself. He closed his eyes.
“Here, have my jacket” he said as he wrapped around her the piece of clothing.
Vert slowly he pulled out his wand and moved so the bunny was facing towards him. Carefully he started cutting the vines that were entangled around his legs. When every single one was snipped, the baby instantly jumped forward and unintentionally ended up sitting in his lap.
“Elizabeth!” he called out before the girl could leave the Head Dorms. Things had been slightly awkward lately between them, mostly on Draco’s side. He could see why Harry had warned him about her. She was a sly one...
“No. Unfortunately I can’t. I tried but Headmaster Dumbledore said it would be a good idea if we got to know each other, also it would be a great opportunity for us to work better together as we would have a place to meet up to plan the graduation ball” Draco sighed.
“I’ll be in the stands, cheering for you. I’d say ‘good luck’ but I’m pretty sure that would be overkill” Draco smiled at his friend and left the tent they were in.
He spat the hot liquid out as he read the title of the first article.
“I heard you and Headmaster Dumbledore talking about it by accident...” he said.
————————————————————————————
He swam as fast as he could and gasped in shock and horror when he realized exactly who one of the two students was: Draco.
“They’re in Azkaban...” Draco said.
“You’ll look after Snoodle for me right?” he asked. Draco had been heartbroken when he found out he couldn’t bring his pet along with him. He would terribly miss the little guy.
“Honey, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to King’s Cross?” his ‘mum’ asked him as she and his ‘dad’ prepared to go get Harry at the station as he would be returning from school that day.
They were seen having dinner together last night at a new high class French restaurant in the middle of Paris!
“It’s fine. It wasn’t your fault anyway” he said while pressing a kiss to her forehead.
He didn’t do it because he wanted people to praise his good action.
“I didn’t hear that...” Harry said as he leaned closer to Draco a bit.
She too rarely left the Hospital Wing and preferred to be with her boyfriend, only she got to care for him publicly while he had to do it when he was sure no one was watching.
Harry missed his Draco. He missed the brightness in his eyes, his smile, his voice.
Draco sighed and nodded.
“Didn’t you hear him, Ronald!? Of course he didn’t: he isn’t talking!” Hermione chastised the red-head as she explained the events of yesterday evening.
Draco frowned slightly.
As cheers and cries of victory erupted from the crowd, Harry grinned.
This was what she had always dreamed of! However she could’t shake the feeling that something felt off...
“Because! It’s your broom!” James said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Harry asked to see Draco’s room so Draco showed it to him.
“Yes, and unfortunately starving him left his body in a very delicate condition. Draco is having problems with his eating habits and we are trying to fix them”
The man was inspecting him with his thick glasses and humming to himself in thought.
This parade ended here.
As he picked it up he instantly paled at the words written on the inside label of the bag: ‘property of Draco Malfoy’.
Dr. Dirwin nodded in understanding.
His two best friends entered the flat without saying a single word to him.
“I know” he said.
It was a difficult process as his vision was blurry and he kept on cutting his hands in sharp rocks and twigs.
“But Snape never does that!” Ron complained.
He checked with all of his friends but none of them would tell them where Draco was. Pansy even threatened to hex him if he even went anywhere near Draco ever again.
“But you still talked about it?” Draco nodded in response.
Draco finally reached her and whispered in her ear.
Of course the Hufflepuff was too kind and often praised Draco, not only when they were with other people, but even in the letters they wrote each other. Cedric made sure to always thank him.
They spent a few minutes in silence, each of them pondering between the two candidates.
She frowned at him.
“The Beauxbatons champion is: Fleur Delacour” loud cheers immediately erupted from the french students. Draco and his friends all clapped politely.
Luckily, even Lavender agreed it would be best if they kept quiet about this.
Harry’s head pulled back slightly so now their lips were so close they could feel their breaths mingling; there was hardly any space between their bodies as well. Draco looked at Harry’s lips and subconsciously licked his own.
She opened the door and found Draco was organizing his clothes and belongings back into his room by neatly sorting them with his wand by color and type (shirts, trousers, etc.)
“Shhh”
“We?” Sev raised his eyebrow and tilted his head to the side.
“I admit he’s a gloomy fellow but other than that he’s quite alright. A damn good teacher if you ask me” Cedric said, not looking up from the parchment he was writing an essay on about the International Warlock Convention of 1289.
“Good. Let’s hope he is well enough for us to remove part of his memories so we can see what happened to him...” the chief said as he sat down next to Sirius.
“Children are more vulnerable than adults and should not be included in such dangerous ‘games’”.
Draco in the meantime had also chosen to get a dark grey comfy lounge chair that he would place next to the window so he could read.
“What’s its name?” he asked.
“That’s fine. You can like both!” he said.
Slowly she rose to meet his face and he pulled her in for another kiss. This one was more intense as both of them had been expecting it: they nibbled at each other’s lips as they surrendered to passion. A few minutes later they both broke away and smiled at each other. The kiss had ended up in a very intimate position with Kate straddling Draco.
“Really? Thank you, young man!” she said as she reached over the fence and patted him on the head. He gave her a small smile and returned back to sit on his picnic blanket.
“Oh please, I insist. Such a hot girl can’t be with a wimp like Malfoy. He’s so pathetic” he laughed and turned to his two goons for support. The two, like good pets, immediately started laughing as well.
No one brought up what they had just discussed, figuring it should be Harry and Draco to actually tell them what was going on between them.
“They were... loud. Pretty loud but fine I guess” he said.
“This idea sounds wonderful, honey, but we can’t legally adopt him without the parents’ consent, which they will never give”
Harry simply couldn’t wait until Draco woke up: this was going to be the best activity ever.
He narrowed his possibilities down between Hermione and Lavender.
They talked all night, or rather, Harry talked all night while Draco quietly commented and listened. Dinner was a pleasant affair: Harry talked about his time at Hogwarts, James and Lily asked him lots of school related questions while Draco listened and only spoke when he was spoken to. He preferred to listen.
Harry and Hermione approached him and it was only when they were standing directly in front of him that he noticed them.
He waited exactly eight minutes and seventeen seconds and then added a little piece of Dragon Liver cut into half inch cubes.
He looked at her and saw she was a Slytherin.
There was only one problem: Theodore Nott.
Is Draco Malfoy hiding something foul from the world? What isn’t he telling us?
Draco and Snoodle got along very well and had lots of fun together: Draco liked to read to Snoodle, who instead liked to sit on Draco’s shoulder and listen to what he said.
Draco was smiling as he normally did while that Slytherin girl was looking at his Draco with a predatory look on her face. Draco, of course, didn’t notice this and simply went on as if nothing was wrong.
“It’s fine” he said as he smiled at her. She beamed at him as well. They were still close and entangled in each other and one little movement forward would bring their lips together again.
“Are you sure? No clothes? Nothing?” James asked him.
As they watched their son cuddle with the bunny, they both decided it was best if they brought him to a magic specialist to check out his “gift”.
“So, have you two boys planned something for today?” Mr. Diggory said as they sat down.
“Draco,
“I can drink water, in fact I do, quite a lot actually; I don’t get the urge to eat though and I know it’s messed up considering how much my friends stuff their faces both at breakfast and at lunch” he said.
Draco smiled and hugged him back as Lily and Harry joined them. He closed his eyes.
“You can sit back down“ the healer said to him.
“I don’t really... uhm...have... anything to get... I mean...” he trailed off. He was still looking at his feet.
She had been forced to leave for Beauxbatons when the tournament had ended, before Draco could wake up, and hadn’t been able to return to England because of her parents.
As they went down the stairs, the family settled in the living room.
Stay tuned!
————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————
Draco retired to his room with Snoodle.
“Oh yeah, it’s a fairly recent development from just yesterday actually... Elizabeth found a school tradition that Head Students have their own dorms. So... uhm... I guess I’ll be moving in with her in a few days...” Draco blushed. He really didn’t see why it was necessary for him to be with her all the time as in the Head Dorms he would be all alone, separated from his friends.
“I forgive you”
“That’s... That’s good I think” Cedric said.
As he walked up the stairs, exhausted, he tiredly answered the question to gain access to his old dorms. He couldn’t even bear to see either Harry or Elizabeth right now so he opted to stay in his dorms.
“I just hope he doesn’t end up hurt in the end. I hope they both don’t...” Lily said. She shook her head.
“Sure!” he said.
As Draco let Snoodle out of his cage the rabbit immediately climbed up to sit on his shoulder as he pulled out one of his books and started reading it.
The pair separated and immediately after he wasn’t in Kate’s line of vision Draco put his hands in his hair and slumped up against a wall, closing his eyes.
“Uhm... su-”
As they arrived, Draco opened his eyes and found he was in a comfy living room.
“Draco!” she squeaked “I wasn’t expecting to see you here!” she said and looked at him closely, observing his particular attire, or lack of it in this case.
He inspected Draco’s visible injury (basically his scar) and muttered angrily to himself.
You’ll always be in my heart.
“H-How? I thought you were in America?” he asked as they separated.
He immediately attacked when the creature went to make a move.
“Because I’m afraid Madam Malkin’s employees are big gossips and can’t resist spreading out all kinds of information to anyone who will listen. If we go there I assure you by the end of the day everyone in Diagon Alley will know we’ve taken Draco in and I don’t want him to be the subject to rumors. We were lucky enough everyone at St. Mungo’s who knew the reason why Draco was in the hospital was obliviated. We can’t risk anyone knowing of the abuse he went through because he will very likely be bullied and teased mercilessly and I won’t stand for it. We’ll go to Twilfitt and Tattings. Besides, I think Draco’s parents used to shop there because it is considered more upper class by pureblood families” Lily said and James nodded.
As the sorting ceremony started he stood there nervously.
Since only a few drops were required for such a small wound and animal, he figured he would have to get an object that resembled its mother’s breast and hopefully he would drink.
If you’re one of my readers you’ll know there’s nothing I love more than uncovering a secret romance and that’s precisely what I intend to do! If there’s something going on between these two, do not worry: you’ll be the first to know!
“It sounds perfect!” Draco smiled as the two made their way to the Black Lake.
Draco examined the wand: it was gnarled, of a light color and was very long and thick at the tip. He didn’t particularly like it... and was slightly relieved when he tried it and the vase broke again.
“It actually makes a lot of sense” she piped up  and Draco gave her a small smile. The first she had ever seen. Her heart swelled in her chest.
“I’ve never seen him so mad about something...” Draco said more to himself than to her.
What if by putting on this ring he would become like his father? What if by wearing it he was justifying everything his parents had done to him? Would his father even want him to have it? After all he hadn’t given it to him before... Was he even worthy of being called a Malfoy?
“It’ll be absolutely amazing, Drakey! I have to rush away but I’ll see you later in the Head Dorms!” she kissed Draco on the cheek and proceeded to walk away, completely ignoring Harry.
Harry was sure she had picked that color only to please Draco...
“I don’t know... his parents’ trial is tomorrow and I’m sure they will be found guilty, so they will be spending some time in Azkaban. As for Draco, he will be placed with a foster family until he is seventeen...” James said with a frown on his face.
“Hearing you moan out ‘Harry’ like a bitch in heat... disgusting, faggot! You really thought it was all real. You’d like that wouldn’t you, you useless worm. You’d like for someone to actually want you in this world. You’d like that somebody would come and save you. Well, I wouldn’t waste my time. No one cares about you. No one wants you!”
Snoodle was gently biting at him so he put the bunny down in front of him.
“In you there’s a kind heart, something very rare considering everything you’ve been through, but I also see curiosity and ambition. You wish to prove yourself but don’t conform with other’s believes” the Hat described.
He opened his eyes and immediately frowned at the pain he felt in his body, like he couldn’t move. The room was familiar: it was the cell he had spent most of his life in.
“Don’t apologize, sweetie. It’s completely fine you’re not hungry” she said as they continued with their shopping mission in Diagon Alley.
Hermione said harshly as she got up and left the room.
“It says here that mere-people, beings with angelic voices in water actually sound like shrieks and wails in a loud, high-pitched whine when on land!” Draco said excitedly.
“Let’s hope everything goes well and this is just a false alarm or else I’m afraid we’re going to have a serious problem with this school” Lily said as she turned to Crouch and scowled.
There weren’t many things Draco could actually do except for reading or playing chess.
Kate blushed and smiled at something Draco had said and nodded in agreement to it.
“Don’t you shush me!”
His mother was sitting right beside him.
He watched as from the covers emerged a little black bunny. It’s fur was all tangled from the covers brushing it.
“Perhaps you should do well to remember, Mr. Nott, Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle, that you are members of Slytherin house and as such you will conduct yourself accordingly” Draco turned his head and saw Professor Snape emerge from the shadows of the Dungeons; Nott and his two dogs immediately stopped laughing and paled at the sight of the intimidating teacher.
He supposed this was what differenced him from Cedric, who was a Hufflepuff. He guessed bravery could truly come from anywhere, after all their house didn’t define them personally.
“Vanilla with sprinkles?” he asked, knowing the other Slytherin would understand what he meant.
Mr. Diggory’s curiosity turned to shock.
A second later they were standing in the slightly crowded apparation points in Diagon Alley.
He picked up the baby rabbit and carried it onto his picnic blanket so they were sitting comfortably in the shade. He placed the bunny in front of him and thought about what to do: he had to sterilize the wound and then heal it.
“Surprise?”
Two days passed until something really strange happened.
“I guess so... unfortunately he’s heterosexual and probably won’t notice me in a romantic way. We work great as friends but I don’t think he’ll ever see me as anything more” he said quietly.
“Would you say you’ve grown used to hunger?”
While Harry had polished off his plate, Draco had barely touched his food (he had already had breakfast and wasn’t hungry) and unfortunately Harry had noticed this.
‘Oh that boy’ she thought fondly as she went to the kitchen and filled up her magical watering can and started watering the various plants around the house.
“Draco?”
Draco nodded and pushed away his plate and waited in silence with his head down for the adults to finish.
Draco felt strong arms wrap around him from behind as Harry’s familiar scent filled his nostrils.
“Please relax, I’m not here to stop you from seeing Draco. I suspect nothing could keep you two apart and that’s precisely why I’m here” she said to him, allowing him to breathe out in relief. She continued speaking.
As he worked he was distracted by his thoughts who kept on wondering to the sleeping boy upstairs.
“You can tell me, Draco” he said as he placed a hand on the blond’s shoulder.
“Yeah. Listen... uhm... don’t-”
‘The goal is to help Draco understand his sexuality but not make him fall for anyone else’  the voice in his head said and Harry found himself agreeing with it.
He fought hard to keep them in but his eyes wouldn’t cooperate anymore.
Draco said eventually.
“I’m so proud of you, Darling” Pansy said as she hugged him.
He simply laid there in a pool of his own blood and wished he were dead as exhaustion overtook him.
He had been so happy and proud of Draco. His  work had been praised and appreciated all over the world.
They all looked at the Great Hall’s doors when Harry and Draco entered for lunch.
“See? He says it’s okay!” James said with a hopeful smile.
“You shouldn’t worry, however. He was quite lucky given the circumstances: usually this outbreak ends up being fatal when violent magic is involved. Fortunately for the boy healing magic isn’t as draining as combative magic is and he most likely won’t even notice he’s different from anyone else until he actually heals someone. His wand also helped a lot with managing his new powers” the healer said.
Draco stopped in his tracks as he recognized that voice.
“So what can I help you with, sweet boy?” she asked him as she batted her eyelashes at him.
Draco felt empty.
“Sorry. I promise we can talk some more tomorrow okay? We can all sit together at breakfast” Draco said.
Please, I just can’t stand not seeing you at all anymore.
“What the Hell!” he said to her.
“Thank you..” he whispered in Harry’s ear, making a shiver go down his spine.
Some of the reason why the rumors hadn’t died out was Rita bloody Skeeter, who had wrote a few articles about the Triwizard Tournament over the course of the summer.
As he cradled Draco in his arms he looked at his face. His beautiful grey eyes that once had been so expressive and full of life were staring up at the ceiling, dull and cloudy.
“In Hufflepuff you could show kindness to people and your studies and hard work would pay off. In Ravenclaw your intelligence would thrive and you could demonstrate your wit. In Slytherin you may find yourself a bit more different than others but with those sly and cunning folk your ambition to prove yourself and your manipulation skills would be at their very best” the Hat said.
Fortunately Harry was too busy staring at Draco to notice the brunette girl sitting beside the blond.
“This way I also have some light if I’m by the desk” he muttered.
He also took note of where its eyes were positioned: on the very top of the head, surrounded by the shell.
“Well, Draco was never adopted so he’s only part of your family as a foster kid. Also, I’ve never heard either you or Draco refer to each other as brothers so I’m pretty sure he doesn’t consider you as one” Hermione said.
He was happy.
As his father handed him his trunk he realized this was it. This would be the moment he would be alone in the world with only one person who knew him (without counting Snoodle).
“Oh my God” he said as he stared at the newspaper article.
He let out a shaky breath as Harry kept on breathing lowly into him.
————————————————————————————
The ball was going wonderfully for Draco and Kate...
“Did he say anything about me?”
“If you’re sure...” Cedric said. Draco smiled.
“I saw him walking away muttering angrily to himself about evil and lying women” Kate said as she sat down next to him.
“I suggest you be more careful in the future, Mr. Malfoy” Professor Snape said as he turned around and, with a swish of his dramatic and flowy black cloak, started walking away.
“Hi Hagrid!” Harry said.
“Why don’t you come with me, beautiful? We can have some fun together” Nott brazenly flirted with Kate.
He walked over to Draco and looked down at him lovingly.
Just as Draco was about to say something a sealed letter appeared floating in front of him.
“Oh my God. I’ve lost him haven’t I? Oh Merlin I’ve waited too much! And now he’s going out with Greengrass and then they’ll fall in love and get married and have children and be happy and I’m going to be alone! OH MY GOD WHAT DO I DO!?” he was panicking.
Everything went dark again.
“Draco... Draco, please. Please, please, please...” he begged desperately as he caressed his lover’s cheek: the usually pale skin now had the pallor that came with death only.
Harry nodded, disappointed at the prospect of not spending more time with his friend, who probably noticed his sudden change of mood.
“AQUASPIRITUS-1.5 HOURS”
Suddenly she felt cold and as Elizabeth opened her eyes, she found she was alone in the Head Dorms, blushing like mad.
“So they had sex? They-They had sex! They had S-E-X! Draco had sex with another person. Draco had... sex with another... woman”
“But you’d-”
“She kicked me out before I could find out anything” he said sadly.
He got up and started walking toward the exit to leave.
As he set the bunny on the bed, it immediately hopped over to Draco and settled in the crook of his neck.
Draco had had enough.
James said that today they would be going to a Magic Specialist about his Healing “Gift”. He understood where his parent’s worries were coming from: he too had wondered whether this gift was good for him or not.
So far he had been lucky and he had only gotten a few bruises and cuts from his battles.
He woke up screaming in his bed after a nightmare of his father beating him again.
He had considered writing to Kate about this but he felt they weren’t close enough to discuss such a personal matter. Sure she was his friend and they had been together, but he had never told her about his life ‘before’ and had never intended to.
Draco would die if Harry didn’t like Snoodle. How couldn’t he? He was a soft ball of black fur who hopped and followed you around everywhere!
“I know you’re my godfather, Sir” he said boldly and watched as the man froze in shock.
In the following months Draco did slightly improve his diet and could now manage two meals a day without trouble.
Draco‘s eyes were clouded.
MY WORK MATTERS TO ME.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Oh! Of course, yes...” she agreed halfheartedly, looking just as nervous.
“Sir, forgive me, but where are you taking me? Am I in trouble?” Draco asked. He hadn’t been in this part of the castle before...
“You see, Harry... uhh they were both kinda... sorta... naked” Hermione blushed at the memory, feeling embarrassed.
“I know you’re friends with my mother, Lily, and I know she told you what happened to me during my childhood”
“Now boys. Since presents are supposed to be secret we’re going to allow you some time alone but don’t go wondering by yourselves and be careful out there” Lily said and James nodded in agreement.
“I wanted to apologize, you know, for Rita Skeeter...the article...because I didn’t get a chance before. Also, I wanted to tell you about the egg” Cedric said.
“Sure, why not? As long as you promise you do not let me get drunk under any circumstances”
When dinner was done Draco offered to do the dishes (again) but was denied. Instead Lily offered to help him organize his purchases and by the end of the night all his new furniture had been placed in his room, his books were sitting on the bookshelf, his cauldron and potion ingredients were stored in his cupboard, his clothes had been neatly folded/hanged in his wardrobe, his Quidditch gear was downstairs in the dedicated cupboard and his writing utensils were on his desk.
Draco was a lot earlier than expected; anyway, he took a deep breath and opened the door only to find Astoria sodding Greengrass standing in front of him with a shy smile.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I thought you were alone. I didn’t mean to...” she said as she hugged him from behind and rested her chin on his shoulder.
Unfortunately for the brunette, Draco had heard absolutely nothing during his prolonged sleep and didn’t remember anything since the Third Task.
The last step was to add a pinch of dried Gillyweed to his potion and make sure it dissolved by stirring counterclockwise.
“What do you mean? Didn’t you hear it talk?” he asked.
Draco ignored them all and took out his wand.
Draco nodded again.
“O-Okay... then... uhm where do we start?”
He shook his head to clear his thoughts.
“Draco. Can you hear me?” he looked up and saw his mother was standing right in front of him.
“His parents?” the male healer asked.
It had probably gotten there when the ‘attacker’ had hit Draco’s head and given him a concussion. Perhaps it had been on the ground when he fell. It hadn’t been noticed because the wound was covered in hair and the freezing lake water had stemmed the bleeding.
“Well, I think this was a productive evening! You should head to bed early tonight: tomorrow you’ll have to be well rested” Draco said as Cedric and him dried themselves off.
Although the blond was stubborn eventually he would see how Harry was in the right here and cut down on his work hours to give their relationship time to blossom even more.
“Ready” he said.
He said goodbye to his friend but not before promising he would write that summer.
he turned and walked back towards her.
Hermione sighed.
He smiled cunningly at her and slowly started walking towards her.
“She’ll just have to accept him, Draco”
“Please, baby. I need you” he pleaded as he watched the comatose boy in front of him.
Draco inwardly sighed: he didn’t feel like he could take another step without collapsing; instead he simply nodded and smiled awkwardly at James’ excitement as he dragged him yet again to get another shop. This one had some brooms displayed in the windows.
“Ready?” Cedric asked him and he nodded.
Harry, after realizing Draco wasn’t pleased with him for his little stunt, apologized to him.
“What? Where? When?!”
“We don’t know: James found him locked up in a room unconscious and bleeding during a raid”
“Yes, Sir. Cedric said it was best that I cast it on him and to make sure the charm worked” Draco said.
Hagrid spent the whole ride up to Hogwarts in some sort of carriage informing him of how great it was to have a new student and of how much fun he would have here.
“Hello” he heard as Kate appeared from out of nowhere and sat besides him.
“There’s also one more thing” she said as she summoned the orchid from downstairs.
“How were they?” Michael asked him with no expression on his face.
“Morning” he said and watched as Harry jumped in shock.
As he walked down the stairs, James instantly was by his side.
I’m sorry I have to do this the ‘coward’s way’ but I feel like I wouldn’t be able to get this all out without you interrupting me.
Both Harry and Draco promised they would be back at this apparation point in exactly two hours. As the four divided into two couples Harry immediately asked Draco where he wanted to go.
“I agree” Lily said. Since Draco didn’t have any friends, James worked in the morning and sometimes in the evening and she had chores to do around the house, Draco usually didn’t have that much company during the day except for his books. Perhaps a pet friend would do him good.
“You should tell him how you feel” she winked and left the room.
For example how the room was quiet now and he couldn’t hear the vague voices around him anymore.
“It’s fine. But seriously: what are these?” he said as he speared a soft disk with his plate and cut out a tiny piece.
Snoodle soon settled down as Draco started petting him.
Luck didn’t seem to be on his side as right at that moment Astoria decided to come looking for him.
“Yeah but what if she doesn’t like him!” he was rapidly gaining some color to his cheeks (again) as he ranted on about his beloved pet and of how little he had been seeing him lately with all that had been going on.
————————————————————————————
When the blond didn’t stir in the slightest, he relaxed and closed his eyes.
The woman nodded.
He summoned with a quick and simple “Accio” the bottle of Wound-Cleaning Potion James had told him they always kept in the house in case of any injuries.
“A few times at first when I didn’t know my limits”
When Draco woke up he felt a bit more rested but his head was still pounding and his whole body hurt.
“But I want to help you! I can’t ask you to work this much for me!” Cedric protested.
Let’s be honest here, Theo: you’re not happy.
He groggily yawned when suddenly he became aware of the heat coming from the body laying next to him and immediately opened his eyes.
Silence followed.
Sev nodded.
When he jumped into the water everything was blurry and dark around him and he felt the frigid waters of the Black Lake surrounding him and thought for an instant Draco’s potion hadn’t worked. He then remembered he had to wait for five seconds.
In the meantime Harry quietly opened Draco’s door and tiptoed into his room.
“Hmm, yes I do. Whatever you decide you want to become, just make sure it’s something you like. I want to see you happy. You deserve it” Harry said as he took Draco in his arms and wrapped them in a tight embrace. Draco felt warmth not only around him but spreading from inside his body, in particular his heart.
“I don’t know if you’ve realized but you’ve just ruined your chances with him as well” he said as he turned around with the bag in his hand.
Harry licked his lips, realizing just how close to Draco he was.
He collapsed on the the hard ground, exhausted and bleeding profoundly.
When he did, the owl hooted and flew away.
The Slytherin seemed to be a little taken aback by Draco’s indifference but that didn’t discourage him from insulting the blond. It just spurred him on and made him more determined to have the Ravenclaw running away with tears in his eyes once he was finished ‘talking’.
“It’s alright. Go rest for a bit. We don’t want you to strain yourself: you’re not used to this much activity and food, so we’ll take it slowly”
“Do you feel... anything?”
He’s created a cure for the highly contagious Spattergroit Disease!
Lily sighed and walked over to Draco and took his hand while James took Harry’s.
Wait... HE WAS GAY!?
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked in a sleepy voice.
Loud banging woke him up.
“Well, he’s been taking some vitamins to help him and he’s been trying to stimulate his appetite by eating more frequent meals”
“I’m not going anywhere when you’re like this because of me” he cried when Draco didn’t stop coughing. It lasted for two minutes until he managed to control himself.
“When did you start eating like this?” she asked.
“One meal a day” he suddenly said quietly.
“Please, you go first” Draco said as he pulled her closer to him. Kate raised her head so she could look at him in the eyes.
Why did it chose him? Did it think he had a troubled personality? If there was one thing Draco didn’t think he was was mental. Merlin, did he go insane after all those years spent alone with a bouncy ball in a cold cell? Is that why his wand deemed him a ‘troubled personality’?
In the end he was glad he had told someone about Sev because he felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from his chest. He still had to find out a way to inform his other friends but that could wait... for now...
James took his hand and stepped inside a fire place and threw out some powder and said clearly “Diagon Alley!”.
He thanked Merlin he had studied healing spells.
A few seconds later it sprang open as Harry launched himself to Draco and took the blond into his arms.
“His wand’s fine, Ron” Hermione said.
“I certainly will and I know Lily will keep me informed”
Draco raised an eyebrow. Usually Harry never ignored so blatantly his theatrics.
When he coughed James handed him a glass of water but he refused it: his body felt unusually heavy.
“Woah Pansy, hang on a second! Tori and I have only jest reconnected! We’re not even sure if there’s something between us yet” he said as Astoria came to stand next to him.
“I know sweetie, but if you’re really meant to be together then it’ll happen” Lily smiled at her son.
“Make that three” Draco said “You need it” he added when Cedric looked ready to protest.
How could he have been so stupid! All those glances, those touches, those words... just a lie. Everything had been just a joke to the brunette.
“You gave me a fright” Harry said.
Three. Two. One...
“Thanks! So you’re back for good?” Draco asked hopefully. She nodded and smiled warmly at him. He was overjoyed.
“Yes... It was very nice of you, Severus: being bullied at school after being abused all your life at home isn’t the best of situations. To be fair he does take it all in his stride” Headmaster Dumbledore mused.
Draco enjoyed being praised by his friends, especially Harry, he liked seeing the way his green eyes lit up in excitement.
“How are you feeling, honey?” she asked gently as she placed a hand on her son’s cheek.
Kate got closer to him while he wrapped his arm around her waist.
“The poor thing... can’t even finish a little plate of food... those monsters got only half of what they deserved” James said.
“May I come in?”
“I don’t think so: he asked Kate and won’t go back on his word just because I told him I liked him. Draco’s too chivalrous for that...” Harry said “I’ll just have to hope the ball goes disastrously bad for both of them...”.
“Expecting this?” he asked her while smirking.
“Merlin no! I’m a Gryffindor and my house colors are red and gold” he said in a horrified voice.
“No” she said “Think they’ll go away eventually if we just ignore them?” she added as the knocking continued.
“Yes, I am. We did just fine with Harry. Besides, it’s not like Draco’s a baby... It’ll be fine”
“I’m sorry! I told you not to touch it! It’s very protective and won’t let anyone else use it” Draco said as he took her hurt hand in his right one and with his left he cast a pain reducing charm.
Cedric had fallen asleep about half an hour earlier as it was six o’clock in the afternoon  and they had been researching in the library for hours.
This treatment can be administered in various ways depending on the severeness of the case. It has to be applied externally, like a very watery cream (its consistency is quite denser than water), to treat the blisters and scars, however it is most effective when taken orally as it directly tackles the infected cells in the body and neutralizes them.
He shook his head no.
“Oh, and one last thing. I’m going to take control of your precious family business and get rid of all those who have a shady past and/or present. I’m going to start over and cleanse it of all the darkness it has so that maybe, one day, the Malfoy name won’t be as negative as it is now” he said and left the room, ignoring Lucius’ enraged shouts.
“Wait.. how do you know all this?” he asked.
“This is my bunny: Snoodle” he said.
He didn’t say anything though and let Harry continue talking about all the things they would do in Gryffindor Tower and once they were on the Quidditch Team.
“What do you mean ‘a certain way’. Did you not eat before?” she asked.
“Oh, uhm, actually the password is ‘Caput Draconis’... right? Well, anyway, it’s fine I’ll just wait out here” he said. The lady (he refused to call her ‘fat’) nodded and walked away from the portrait, probably to go find Hermione.
“Draco really should be here...” Harry said.
He took a shaky breath when he saw the man sitting in the interrogation room at Azkaban Prison. Fortunately the one-way glass prevented him from being seen, however it didn’t help with the flash of anxiety that cursed through him.
“Sev!” he said and rushed to hug the man.
“I just have some last few tests to run and if the potion passes then we can start mass production” Draco said while smiling proudly.
“Draco...”
“And does young Mr. Malfoy have his key?” he asked in a weird voice.
The worst thing about all this was that Harry hadn’t even told him himself. Draco had only found out by chance.
“But-”
“Me? But- why would she want me?” he furrowed his eyebrows slightly.
“Busted...” Astoria sighed as she put on her own dressing gown.
Draco didn’t see what was so funny: he was dressed in the usual Hogwarts uniform.
Hermione pursed her lips.
“Harry, you can’t spend the whole night sulking” Hermione said as Ron and Lavender emerged from the dance floor.
“Harry, son, let Draco answer you!” James said before Harry could keep on talking.
Lily rolled her eyes.
Soon James couldn’t take it anymore and went out to speak with his son’s healers while his wife stayed with the poor boy.
“Tell me, woman!” he asked urgently.
Harry had been given a second chance and he would not screw it up.
“I’m sure Draco will realize just how much you mean to him one day. After all, he hasn’t been around people for a long time, unlike you, and he’s probably not sure about his sexuality yet” Lily said.
Time quickly passed as the two of them fell asleep in their comfy position.
As he started eating he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. Turning his head he saw it was the pretty girl from before. He hadn’t even noticed she had sat beside him at the very end of the Ravenclaw table. He smiled.
“Draco...” she said but received no answer so she continued “I won’t get mad if you haven’t been eating but you have to tell me.” she said.
“HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT!? THAT-THAT EVIL WOMAN GOES AROUND SPREADING LIES ABOUT YOU AND YOU’RE NOT EVEN BOTHERED!” Harry shouted at him in anger and stomped back to the castle.
Harry closed his book and put it on the table as he got up and stretched.
He didn’t know what but there was something about Sev that comforted him in a way that James didn’t. Perhaps it was hearing just how much the Potions master cared for him even though he didn’t know him that well?
“Follow me” he said as he lead them to the back of the bank and hopped into a cart. As they rode it he watched as they passed what seemed to be an infinite number of vaults until they finally came to a stop.
He suddenly realized something.
Another wave of dizziness. He ignored it and kept on going.
“Thank you, Sev” he said as he made his way to the door and left the room.
He stood in front of the door and bit his lip nervously. He had returned to England a day earlier than planned because he had something very important that he needed to do before he told his family and friends he had returned.
As she collapsed over him, he marveled in the feeling of her breasts pressed against him: firm yet soft and warm, her nipples hard.
“Really?” Lily asked feeling relieved as she placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco himself looked up.
A little bump started moving under the covers until Snoodle emerged and cuddled next to him, providing support and emotional comfort. The bunny had been with Draco basically everyday while the blond ‘slept’.
“What?”
Stay tuned for more!
Two glasses of red wine and a jazzy piano music playlist later and both of them were sitting on her comfortable couch, talking about anything and everything.
He looked at her closely. She hadn’t changed much. She was wearing a Prussian blue dress that enhanced her lithe form and minimal makeup. Her hair was pulled back in a neat bun and she was wearing a silver necklace with a sapphire gem and matching earrings. She was very simple yet in excellent taste. Just as he remembered her.
As they left the hospital neither of them spoke until they were home. Draco knew that James knew the real reason why he had this ‘gift’ and he dreaded explaining to his father exactly how and why he had wished he were dead every night for years before he was adopted.
“We’re assuming they’re the Malfoys. We already sent a message to our superior, he will be here to clarify the situation” Sirius said and the healer nodded, walked away and entered the room the boy was in.
“Yes, blood types are all different within us wizards, that’s why we use blood replenishing potions, which ‘multiply’ our own blood, as our blood is unable to accept transfusions form others, unlike Muggles. In this case Draco knew Cedric was way past the Blood Replenishing Potion standards for the potion to work in time for Cedric to actually digest it, so he did something which is as brave as it is difficult: he temporarily transferred some of his own blood to Mr. Diggory, to sustain him until Mr. Diggory’s body has enough blood to work on its own. Very few have tried this method to save a life and even fewer have been successful” Madam Pomfrey said.
He did find it more tricky though to learn the defensive spells because he didn’t actually plan on ever using them if not in a situation of great need. Anyway, by the time the school year was almost over he had learnt basically every spell he could and practiced them during Easter break and every other free moment he could spare.
“I’m so proud of you” she whispered in his ear.
His book had been discarded as his new friends kept on distracting him with their questions.
Harry looked up behind him and saw McGonagall and Dumbledore were looking down at Draco, their gazed focused on his left hand, which was still grasping his wand tightly. The tip of the wand instead of being the usual white was stained a crimson red and it had red streaks running down it.
Everyone stayed silent. Shocked.
“That’s horrible” Harry whispered.
Harry stood there blushing for the next twenty minutes before actually regaining control of his body and waking away, suddenly in a very good mood.
His eyes were just as bright as his smile.
————————————————————————————
Draco blinked. What about Gryffindor?
Harry had paled.
“Draco did a very thorough job with healing his external and internal wounds: I’m very impressed. But it’s what he did lastly that saved Mr. Diggory”
He mentally wrote that down as a weakness.
We can only wonder why Mr. Potter would ever leave such a man!
“Thank you! You’re such a gentleman!” she fawned over him. He smiled uncomfortably but otherwise remained silent.
“Oh nothing, I actually just wanted to have you all to myself for a while” Harry smiled as he sat right next to Draco and took his hand.
“But, sweetie, it’s not healthy for you” she said as she placed her hand on his head.
“Very talented for a fourteen year old. I dare say you’ll be a very good wizard when you grow up”
People had called him ‘gay’ loads of times before and he never had been too affected by the word itself, even when it was used as an insult.
I was wrong. You were right and I was wrong, and I clearly see that now.
Harry blushed. He had never been more embarrassed in his life.
What should he do? Meet with Harry and hear him out? Ignore this and simply try to forget the brunette?
His only comfort was that Draco wasn’t with that bitch as he was in Ravenclaw Tower.
He noticed the way Draco’s body was placed uncomfortably on the sofa so he decided to carry the blond to his bed.
“Should I send him some roses?” he asked and Ron mentally face palmed.
He was in awe as her breasts bounced, as her face contorted with the pleasure he was giving her.
“How did they find out then?” Draco asked.
Meanwhile Cedric...
“And are those the only houses in Hogwarts?” Draco asked curiously.
“PROFESSOR DO SOMETHING. PLEASE!” he cried as he cradled Draco’s head in his lap and stroked his soft blond hair. He couldn’t smell Draco’s shampoo over the metallic scent of blood. He was hyperventilating.
As the bouncer let him in, the music filled his ears and instantly he felt slightly better.
The boy was laying motionless on the bed under the covers. He had no visible expression on his face.
“The two looked lovely together!” says a witness “she was wearing a red dress and he had a red matching tie to go with it. Very sexy!”
Draco smiled and hugged her.
“Basically you coat your glasses once a month with these two potions and they will always be clean, un-foggy and won’t break or get scratch marks” he explained.
“Stand up, please” he said and Draco did as he was told.
The two adults noticed Draco wasn’t in a very talkative mood so they made sure to keep the conversation alive all the way home.
————————————————————————————
“Why don’t you stay here instead? With me” he suggested with a low voice.
“Thank you! This is great! Finally I won’t have to ask Hermione anymore to repair my glasses!” Harry said as he very slowly and gently placed his gift with his other gifts.
—————————————————————————————
————————————————————————————
After about two minutes James finally regained his bearings and quickly changed the subject.
“I don’t know yet... I’ll do some research on it. Don’t worry I’ll figure something out” Draco said.
Harry thought for a moment and eventually answered.
“You haven’t heard of this core as it hasn’t been used in thousands of years because of the magical fish’s rarity and the only person who was able to lure them took this secret to their grave to not impact them ecologically. The White Moon Fish Fin core is powerful and loyal and generally produces spells of particular force and elegance.
He took a deep breath, this would be hard...
“But why?! You love our chess games!” Ron protested loudly as they sat at the Ravenclaw table. Harry sat down at the table right next to Draco. He had been late to lunch because he had spent too much time after class with Flitwick discussing his test results.
He didn’t know for how long he was outside by the lake but soon, as he couldn’t feel his body anymore, he wiped away his tears and started making his way to the castle.
Lucius’ eyes betrayed his bored face as they widened considerably, because of all the things Draco could have said, he hadn’t been expecting that.
I left the keys on the kitchen table and I’ve removed all my belongings from the apartment.
“Place him on a bed!” she said as she hurriedly collected potions from a few shelves.
He checked just by the bed and saw Snoodle was sleeping on his pillow.
“Great! Then let’s go get it! The wards will only let you go in because of your blood. I’ll wait for you outside alright?”
That left his Gryffindor friends.
“I’m Draco” he said in a low voice.
He felt her lips slightly move against his so he decided to finally give her a sign he felt the same way about her. He sat up in bed while she placed a hand on his chest.
“We know that the egg shrieks loudly when we open it so maybe I was thinking we need to cast some sort of spell to make it reveal its true content? Some sort of translating charm perhaps? Cedric asked. Draco thought for a moment and shook his head.
His heart sped up slightly.
“I’m sorry! It’s- Oh hey Harry!” Ron said as his friend came into view.
“Sure thing. Draco’s my friend and I don’t want to see him hurt” he said as he thanked everyone and left their Common Room.
They went down the stairs where James was waiting for them.
“I really like you too, Kate” he muttered as well and looked at her. Kate then directed her gaze to his lips and he subconsciously licked them.
The healer nodded and wrote down this bit of information; he then told them to set the boy down on a bed and they would take it from there.
I’ll meet you at our old apartment tomorrow at five o’clock sharp.
“Okay. It’s going to be okay, Draco. It’s not uncommon to go back to your old habits after being used to them for so many years” she said but Draco simply shrugged.
“We just wanted to help you, Harry... we wanted you to be happy so-”
“Draco is already ditching me to be with the Head Girl” an alarm sounded in Harry’s head at this words.
He looked at the other boys around him.
“Ow! Alright, alright no hot sweaty threesome with you and Astoria then...”
Draco was left standing there. Alone.
Closing his eyes, Draco side-apparated to his new life.
They kept on playing together until there was a knock on the door. It was Harry.
As they separated Draco immediately headed back to the library and picked up a very important book. He then went to his godfather’s office.
“How about... uhm...Quality Quidditch Supplies?” he said timidly, knowing Harry would want to go there sooner or later.
We caught a glimpse of them at the International Medical Conference for Magical and Non-Magical Diseases back in London, where the two shared a reunion.
If you screw this up, I won’t see you again.
He needed to show Draco just how serious he was about this. He would not make the same mistakes again.
“Is there anything else you think you need?” she asked him as the three of them continued with their shopping trip.
“What?” Harry said while getting up and coming to stand close to him.
“Sorry...” he muttered and crossed his arms over his chest as he pouted.
As he stumbled through the seemingly infinite paths of the maze he froze when he caught sight of a giant terrifying beast hidden in the partial shadows and foggy mist of the ‘road’.
Lily and James were really proud of their son and couldn’t wait to see which house he would be in. James was hoping Gryffindor but Lily thought Draco was better suited for Ravenclaw or maybe Hufflepuff.
“Sorry, we just came to inform you they’re transferring you to St. Mungo’s this afternoon to get a more precise check up and treatment if needed” James said as he smirked at his son.
Draco quickly entered the office and took a seat in front of the Headmaster’s desk, right next to Elizabeth.
After they had cleaned up, they settled together in bed, still naked, and fell asleep.
Draco’s smile brightened even more.
He figured he couldn’t do this the logical way. He needed field experience.
“Draco Malfoy” the cheers for the previous student immediately died down as he sat on the stool and the professor placed the Sorting Hat on his head.
Draco nodded and returned to staring at the ceiling.
“Please don’t leave. Ron didn’t mean it” Harry said as he followed Draco out of the compartment.
As he pet it, he noticed his fingers were covered in some drops of blood that were coming from the bunny’s back right paw and leg, which had been scratched by the vines.
“Wait” Draco said. He looked down and clasped Kate’s hand in his. Kate smiled.
He also started noticing various little actions Professor Snape regarded him with: he checked his work three times when they were brewing a potion instead of two (like he did with everyone else); he made sure Draco could read the instructions on the board (his desk was in the third row and he couldn’t see through the heads of his classmates); when he entered his classroom he always did a double take on him to make sure he was okay; he handed him back his assignments and tests first.
Draco refused to see him off at the station and instead chose to say his goodbyes at home.
“Yes, don’t worry. I promise you we’ll take very good care of him” Lily said as James nodded in agreement.
Professor Snape held out his book bag to him and Draco hesitantly took it.
Despite this, he was also excited to be returning to Hogwarts because this year the school would be hosting the Triwizard Tournament: a very dangerous competition in which young wizards fought and demonstrated their qualities and strengths for eternal glory.
The next day Draco found he could breathe a lot better than before and he didn’t have a weight on his chest anymore. His throat also felt a lot better and he suspected the Healers had given him something for that while he slept. Anyhow, he wasn’t complaining.
He frowned slightly and opened the window; the owl stuck out its leg and waited for Draco to take the letter attached to it.
“Uhh...” Draco backed away slowly and suddenly he felt his back coming into contact with a wall as Harry pushed against him, pinning him to the stones. If anyone were to see them like this they would certainly get the wrong idea.
Fifteen minutes later the chief arrived at the hospital and brought them up to par with everything that happened in the raid.
Draco also liked his gifts, especially what Harry had gotten him: a set of rare potion ingredients.
A few weeks passed and soon it was time to go back to Hogwarts.
He tried to separate himself from her but she was surprisingly strong. He gripped her hair and cheek as he tried to pull away.
“So, why are you so happy?” he asked. He had a dreadful feeling it had something to do with bloody Kate Aguillon (that was her surname).
Lily stayed silent as she processed the information.
Meanwhile Lily and James
“What does it mean? What is this mirror?” Draco asked as he turned away from the clearly magical object.
Draco would never know Voldemort was dead. There were no windows around and he was quite far away from where the final battle had taken place.
As the two hugged Harry said in his ear:
“All those smiles, looks, touches. All those compliments and blushes” he muttered in her ear. Elizabeth inhaled a sharp breath as Draco’s hand gently started making its way down to her hand, barely grazing her skin with his touch, until finally he plucked the piece of paper from her hands and dropped it on the floor.
Harry nodded absentmindedly and sighed.
“What kind of monsters would do that to an innocent child?” Sirius asked, clearly in shock.
She looked at him innocently but Draco, who was now aware of the real reason behind all of her smiles and touches, easily recognized the look in her eyes.
Then they went to Slug & Jiggers Apothecary where they bought a vast range of Potion ingredients: Asphodel, Bat Wings, Beetle Eyes, Cat Hair, Dandelion Roots, Dittany, Flobberworms, Newts, Salamander Blood and much more.
In fact, over the night loads of people had come over to him to congratulate him on his work. He had never been happier.
“Lucky sod...” Ron muttered.
‘Dear Kate,
“I don’t want to come between the two of you, because ultimately I know that given the choice he would undoubtedly pick you.
The Healers had also asked about his eating disorder and while they had seen lots of progress form his earlier charts (judging by his weight) they still decided to give him a course of intravenous IV fluids since his throat hurt too much for him to actually swallow food.
Draco decided to be brave for once and slowly leaned in. She seemed to get closer to him as well as he could suddenly feel her breath on his skin. They both closed their eyes.
“No, my heart didn’t stop. But everything else is true” Draco said.
Wizards and Witches shaking his hand, smiling and recognizing how difficult and how much work he put into his job.
“You better hope my son is alright or else I swear I’ll break your legs, Crouch” James said.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy and Miss Swart. Please, do come in” Dumbledore said with the usual twinkle in his eyes.
“I understand but I’m okay now. I’ll be out of here in no time” Draco said. Harry didn’t seem convinced but decided it was best to change the topic of the conversation.
“Did she stick out her ass like the whore she is? Did she flash you her breasts from under her slutty shirt? Let me guess: she didn’t wear a bra, didn’t she? Wanted you to take her there and then... well guess what Draco? You’re mine. You’re mine and mine alone” Harry breathed into Draco’s ear, making him shiver. Where had all of this boldness come from?
He deserved this. The cold shoulder.
Draco sighed and put down the copy of the Daily Prophet that Harry had lended him. The two of them were sitting by the Black Lake and were revising their Charms homework, or they were until Harry had opened his news paper and read that article.
So he summoned a latex glove, filled the pinky finger with the potion and poked a tiny hole through it with his wand.
Draco watched from his seat as his friend paced the whole length of the room.
“For what purpose?” he asked.
Even though they hadn’t known each other for long Harry already liked Draco a lot.
But past an hour — the prospect's black,
He looked so content. Harry didn’t have the heart to wake him yet.
“I’m sorry-I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you when you most needed me” Sev said in his ear.
She was slightly late to lunch.
“No. Just half an hour.” he said. She frowned a bit.
“What are you reading?” Lavender said as she glanced over his shoulder and covered with her hair his bunny. He heard Snoodle make a little sound of protest so he gently brushed her hair away from his shoulder and transferred his pet to his left shoulder (this way he could also look out of the window).
“Have I lost him?” he asked himself out loud.
“Hmm... how and when did you ask him?” his mother asked. She really did know him too well.
“What is it?” James asked.
“I appreciate your concern, Harry, really I do, but you can’t let liars like Rita Skeeter get to you like this. People talk, it’s what they do, and they’ll always have an opinion about me: some will be good and others will be bad. What’s important is that the people who matter know the truth. All the rest are just echoes and voices the wind will blow away into nothingness” Draco said. His words seemed to  circle around in the raven-haired boy’s head until he conceded the blond was right.
He didn’t feel brave and didn’t think he would enjoy pranking people. It was mean!
“Are you sure about this? Two children to manage aren’t a walk in the park, Lily” James said. He loved his wife’s idea but wanted to make sure she was sure.
————————————————————————————
To be fair it was a bit early but he had expected the snow would wake him up enough...
Slowly Harry leaned in while closing his eyes. Draco did the same.
He had only ever seen him be incredibly intimidating so this version of ‘caring Severus’ was quite unexpected.
“Not really. I don’t feel hungry most of the time. Just at dinner”
“It wasn’t my place to say”
“So you like grey?” Harry asked him while looking around.
Both the Ravenclaw and the Hufflepuff were covered in blood and had passed out and Harry was panicking. Again.
He felt useless.
“You’re a disappointment” his father said with a sneer as he slapped him hard across the face. Draco could feel the sting of his ring against his face even after his father had left his “room”, or more accurately, his cell.
As the Sorting Ceremony ended, Headmaster Dumbledore stood up to give his speech.
“That-That!?” Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
Ron’s words had really hurt him.
The two of them were sitting on Draco’s bed, studying. Lily had brought them some food for lunch and had left it hovering next to them.
“Why don’t we adopt him?” Lily said, startling James.
It couldn’t have been just a dream! What kind of a dream was so detailed!?
Crab and Goyle, being the two idiots they were, immediately started laughing.
Yes, people, it’s all true!
“So now you’re Harry Potter’s best friend? Playing house with the Potty family are we, boy!?” he said in anger.
Draco lowered his head.
Harry simply crawled on the bed, later next to Draco and took his hand in his.
“It’s too bad your boyfriend didn’t let you drown, Malfoy, he would have done the world a great favor by letting you die” Nott said cruelly and watched him closely.
Today was no different from any other.
“Oh, you’re awake! Sorry, I didn’t mean to barge in, I was just checking if you were alright! Have you been up for long?” Lily asked him as she moved to sit with him on the floor.
“Harry, you have to accept the possibility that maybe Draco isn’t into guys” Hermione gently said as she watched Draco and Kate.
“I trust you’ve seen the article Rita Skeeter wrote? Good. I find her allegations could be quite annoying should she discover something about your ‘past” Sev carefully chose his words and Draco immediately understood he was talking about the abuse he suffered before Lily and James adopted him.
He noticed Harry had been acting very strangely around him the past few months and he couldn’t help but wonder if Kate was the reason for it.
“Harry. Please calm down! Don’t worry, I’m sure everything is going to be alright!” Hermione said.
He understood well his wife’s reasons for not wanting anyone to know exactly why Draco was with them. He already cared a lot for him and didn’t want him to go through even more pain than he already had.
“Nice to meet ya, Draco! I’m Ron!” the red-head said.
Cedric sighed.
“But we already had a ball on Christmas during the Triwizard Tournament” Draco said.
“Why didn’t you tell me? Does anyone know?” Cedric finally asked after he took a minute to process what he’d just heard.
Harry 1 - Elizabeth 0
“Uhm... I’d say the Bouillabaisse but I think you already eat it enough back at home, so maybe... a simple chicken leg with some salad?” he said. That was what he usually ate when he wasn’t feeling very hungry.
Draco gave her a beautiful big smile and placed the plant on the bookshelf, away from the light, because orchids grow best when they aren’t in direct sunshine or else they’ll burn.
“I didn’t want to disturb you” he said quietly.
Silence followed as the woman wrote something down again.
“I’ll come with you” she smiled.
He had just returned from his appointment with Dr. Dirwin and had been feeling quite happy. At least, until now...
Besides, I just wanted an excuse to spend a little more time with you, Tori” Draco grinned at her and she rolled her eyes.
“He only told me a few things you did together...” he said quietly.
He somehow managed to drag himself to his food and slowly started eating his cold poutine, which was disgusting but it was either this or nothing. When he was done thirty minutes later (a long time for such a small meal, but he didn’t have the strength to go any faster and his stomach wasn’t used to receiving a lot of food), he simply laid down on the cold, hard stone floor and closed his eyes.
“This is your family vault: legally, since your parents are in prison, you are the owner of the Malfoys and Blacks’ wealth” James said. Suddenly there was a ‘popping’ sound and a large bag filled with galleons appeared from thin air and emptied itself in the pile of gold and then disappeared.
The two started making their way to Ravenclaw Tower but stopped in the middle of a corridor when they saw Draco and Kate talking together at the end of it. Unfortunately they couldn’t hear what they were saying.
Michael shrugged.
“Then you’re lucky because they usually play pranks on us” Anthony informed him.
“Then why are you judging all of them based on only three people?” he said again.
I woke up about a month ago and I’m feeling a bit better.
As he positioned himself over her he looked her in the eye.
“Why don’t you go and rest. I’m sure you can spend time with your girlfriend tomorrow, Draco” Sev suggested.
“You would do very well in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw but also in Slytherin if your ambition outweighed your kindness” it continued.
“My mother gave it to me as a birthday present” he said. She didn’t say anything more so he stayed silent, simply enjoying her presence. He could stay like that for days. He didn’t know why but he felt relaxed.
—————————————————————————————
She couldn’t think of any reason that had upset her son other than Draco’s injury.
He didn’t want to address their sleeping position just yet so he figured he might as well distract his Draco.
Draco looked up from his page and nodded.
“Thanks” he said as he blushed, not liking the attention on him.
“To the Library. I have to start working on the details for the Prefect’s rounds. Easter isn’t that far away and I need to complete this schedule” she explained as she gestured to the piece of paper she was holding.
He had lost.
It was over.
“Well played, Draco” Lavender said as she smiled at him again and ran her hand down his  arm. Draco awkwardly shifted some more towards the window and away from her. Why was she this close?
“A SHED? YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR POOR BROOMSTICK IN A COLD AND LONELY SHED?!” James shrieked like an eight year old girl and Draco flinched.
He looked at the ‘crab’ and saw the way it held  its four pincers close to its body, like they needed to be protected.
Draco and Cedric trained and studied harder than ever before for the Third (and final) Triwizard Task.
Things were never better for Draco.
“Anyway don’t you think we’re a bit too young for sexual intercourse?” he asked as bluntly as possible and watched Sev blush slightly again.
He missed his girlfriend and he was very disappointed by the fact that they hadn’t managed a proper goodbye and hadn’t gotten any closure of sorts.
“Out of all the names you could imagine, you called him ‘Snoodle’?” James asked him: he had suggested he name his pet ‘Batman’ in honor of the shadowy muggle superhero but Draco hadn’t liked it.
‘This is wrong. You’re betraying Draco’ a voice in his head said.
“We’re going to go present shopping!” Harry said.
He sighed. He knew why Nott had picked today to bully him: Severus hadn’t been present at breakfast because he was busy preparing everything for the test in his classroom; Kate was busy studying so she had told him she would skip breakfast so she could finish her homework. He had offered to help her but she had refused and said she’d rather he have breakfast: ever since she had found out he had problems with eating she had been nothing but supportive, which he immensely appreciated. Harry also had started paying a lot more attention to him and Draco felt the two of them couldn’t be closer.
“Then I guess we’ll have to take him to the hospital and get him on IV fluids again...”
Professor Snape”
“Awww aren’t you just adorable” Blaise smirked knowingly at him.
As they apparated to the station Draco looked around with curious eyes: a black and red train was steaming on the rail while lots of people saw off their children with hugs and kisses and in some cases even tears.
“Ollivander was right, he does have a way with healing magic” Lily said as she and her husband watched their son heal a cute baby rabbit.
He was laying on something soft and and felt a bit warmer than before, although not much.
James then tried to convince Draco to buy a wall broom holder so he could have his broomstick with him at all times. Draco wasn’t sure about this.
“I’ll show her...” he said determinedly. Suddenly he turned around and stalked out of the room.
They were soft and full of understanding.
Harry’s heart swelled in his chest.
The next day he was feeling quite tired because of this and opted to go study in the garden. He was sitting on a picnic blanket under a tree, reading “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”.
“The poor boy...” James whispered. He had heard of people abusing children but never had he encountered a situation this bad before.
“Need you inside me” she moaned out as he swiped up with his tongue.
“I know, sweetheart, but pranking him isn’t the way. For example he enjoyed himself when you two were playing chess by the fire. Try doing something you think he would actually enjoy and not something you and your friends are used to doing” she suggested. Harry instantly had a great idea.
His whole body ached and he couldn’t even manage to get out of bed without help.
Draco could not be dead. He hadn’t survived all these years, going against his parents’ believes, fighting for the side of the Light only to die on the last day.
It was partly true: he did save Cedric’s life but he certainly wasn’t brave and he was no genius. Also, Draco thought people liked to esagerate about risking his own life; sure, he had been in a bad state after the whole ordeal but he hardly considered that as difficult as what Cedric had went through.
“Please?” Harry asked with his ‘puppy dog’ eyes.
“Zshe went outszide” a girl with a heavily french accent informed him. He recognized her as one of the two blond girls Kate had walked with the first time he saw her.
Cedric’s kindness never failed to astonish him.
“Uhm... look I-I’m not really- I don’t... uhm” he said quietly. He didn’t want people to get the wrong impression.
He nodded shyly.
“Oh my God now I’ve just pictured us in bed together and I can’t erase that image from my brain” he said while shaking his head, ignoring his laughing friend.
The next day Draco and Kate had a great time together exploring the castle.
“An announcement: this year a new student joins us and as such he will be sorted with the First Years however he will take classes as a Third Year” a man he assumed was the Headmaster informed all the students.
It was a fairly big room with a window that overlooked the garden. There also was a bed, a desk with a chair and a wardrobe.
Astoria nodded.
“Good. Imagine there was a nice plate with golden brown toast and melted butter in front of you. Would you like to eat it?”
It was addressed to him. He immediately recognized Draco’s neat handwriting on the front.
You’d think my boyfriend would be supportive of me when I’m actually trying to save lives by creating useful medical potions, but no! All I get is a “Cut down on work, Draco, it’s not like it matters to anyone anyway”, “Your job isn’t THAT important, Draco”, “Skip work today, Draco, nobody will notice. You can spend more time with me”.
“You’re the bravest person I know Draco Potter” Kate whispered as Draco felt her soft lips gently make contact with his.
“Maybe he was just tired of Nott’s bullying?” he said. It was a pitiful excuse but it seemed to work with the Gryffindors.
‘Not yet’ the annoying voice in his head added.
He took a deep breath as he walked outside the Fat Lady’s portrait.
He saw Viktor with the corner of his eye and was slightly scared of what he had become: a shark with a human body.
It’s always my fault, isn’t it, Harry?
“I don’t think so...” he said. Right now he couldn’t really think of anything else he would need as he was really tired after several hours of shopping and waking around.
Draco blushed again.
“I mean, they should change the rules so that the Snitch is only worth...thirty points but still ends the game. So the game is more about team work instead of “in the end everything is up to the seekers”. It would be more balanced that way” Draco continued when he received no response.
“I mean, everything about him screams ‘bent’. Look at him!” Nott laughed and only his two goons laughed as well. The entire Great Hall was silent and looked disapprovingly at Nott. Even the teachers were watching, ready to intervene.
Blaise gestured towards Draco and as Pansy looked down, her demeanor immediately softened.
Should he tell Harry and jeopardize their friendship? Should he keep this to himself and do nothing about it?
“Shhh, I know... I know... it’s hard to accept...” James said. Honestly he had expected Draco to break a long time ago and he was surprised his son had held strong this much time.
“What do I do, guys?” Draco asked his best friends.
“Am I good? Pff, what am I even asking, of course I’m good”
“I suppose they’re not all bad... but mark my words you’ll agree with me about Theodore Nott being the Devil reincarnated on earth” Ron said as he settled in his seat and started talking to... one of the brunette boys.
He recognized it now. In fact, he knew this ring well unfortunately. He had felt the sting of it on his cheek and knew the marks it left on his body like the back of his hand after years of beatings.
“Here, this is yours. It should have been given to you when you started Hogwarts....Wear it” James said as he handed him a ring.
So he sat there with the bunny and thought about what to call it, unaware his foster parents had watched the whole scene.
“Alas you can only hope to be there for him in the future” Headmaster Dumbledore said.
“You’re pathetic” a voice drawled from behind him. He froze as he recognized it immediately. It was Lucius’.
Harry looked at the floor and willed the tears forming in his eyes away. He failed again as he felt one of them slide down his cheek. He hastily wiped it away.
Snoodle raised his ears when he heard Draco say his name.
————————————————————————————
As he walked down the street towards the public floo system with his foster parents, he looked at the white wand in his hand: he could feel the magic surging through it from his arm.
“So. What do you want to take?” James asked and Draco raised his eyebrows.
“I like him and I’m proud of him: being this brave and good and kind. If I could I would go back and take him away, raise him myself...” Draco wondered how different his life would have been if Professor Snape had raised him. He wouldn’t have suffered as much, that’s for sure.
Don’t try to contact me.
Next was adding exactly four drops of Essence of Comfrey while stirring slowly at a moderate pace.
Draco furrowed his brow and pointed to the bed as a little bump formed from under the covers. Scared, Harry jumped up.
“Don’t push yourself, Draco: eat only what you want to. It’s natural that you’re not feeling hungry when you were barely fed before. Don’t worry, we’ll get there eventually” Lily said when she noticed Draco was looking with dread at all the food she had placed on his plate.
The blond was looking at the floor.
“Stop it you drama queen” he said. Unfortunately affection creeped in his voice and Harry grinned like the Cheshire Cat.
Harry had looked everywhere for Draco but hadn’t found him. So instead he went back to Gryffindor Tower and explained everything to his friends and asked for their help. They hadn’t blamed him for what happened (as it was all that Slytherin bitch’s fault) but they also had told him it was also a bit his fault as he hadn’t confessed his feelings to Draco earlier, allowing that girl to manipulate both of them.
Draco nodded.
“Guys, lets leave the poor bloke alone. My boy’s tired and needs his beauty sleep” Seamus joked and Draco smiled.
The Cure to the Spattergroit disease was officially released four days later and it made news all over the Wizarding World.
“Nice!” he said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. Unfortunately Draco knew him well...
“What the hell happened to ‘I want Draco back’? Hmm? Did you just suddenly change your mind!? Does Draco really mean that little to you that you would just forget him in seven days?!” Ron said as Hermione hit him repeatedly with the paper.
Now the only person who remained was Harry. He still hadn’t thought about what to give to him. Quidditch supplies first came to mind but he didn’t think it was an original and thoughtful gift. An idea finally came to mind but he had to be quick: they only had twenty minutes until they had to go back.
“Oh that-that ruddy jackass!” James exclaimed. Lily sighed and turned back to her son.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Oh, quite sure, Mrs. Potter. He’ll be fine, if he continues the way he has, of course” the doctor gave him a knowing look.
When his friend turned away from him and stayed silent Michael sighed.
This time the girl did move, although only to change sleeping position: she twisted so that she was facing Draco and buried her face into the crook of his neck.
The two looked completely at ease with each other and seemed to be having a wonderful time. At one point it is even said that Mr. Malfoy reached across the table and placed his hand on Miss Greengrass’ in a demonstration of affection!
“But he shouldn’t have to! That’s the point, Albus. He should have had a happy childhood with loving parents and friends. Instead he was all alone in a small cell for years, barely fed and beaten regularly by his own father” Professor Snape said in anger.
What Harry would have payed to be Snoodle in that moment as Draco ran his fingers through the black fur. Harry imagined them combing through his hair and a shiver of pleasure went down his spine.
Draco was transferred to St. Mungo’s that afternoon where the Healers discovered he had ingested a lot of water during his time in the lake and not all of it had come out. Part was in his lungs, explaining why Draco was having a lot of trouble breathing.
“Lily” Severus said from beside him.
Harry was a bit more difficult to convince because as soon as he found out what Nott was doing he wanted to go and curse the git.
Lily nodded.
All these seemingly meaningless actions actually masked the Potion master’s true feelings quite well and if Draco hadn’t known the man was his godfather he never would have guessed. He still hadn’t told his friends about the matter. He knew well their feelings regarding ‘Sev’ (that’s what he recently had started calling him in his mind as opposed to ‘Professor Snape’) and didn’t think it would be best to inform them of this important bit of information.
He was quite protective and everyday he would ask Draco how he was feeling and if Nott had done something to him.
“Okay” he answered and took the small leather pouch James was offering him.
‘Is it Draco? It has to be Draco! Oh Merlin PLEASE let it be Draco!’ he thought as he opened the portrait and saw...
Draco nodded and pulled out from his pocket a little black bouncy ball. He held it in his hand and showed it to his foster parents.
“Yeah right, lock them in a room or something...” Ron joked. Hermione’s eyes lit up.
“Dean and Seamus” Terry finished for him in a cold voice as Draco nodded.
Draco smiled.
That was no less than what they deserved.
Molten silver met vibrant green.
The brunette wrapped his arms once more around the blond and the two stood there in comfortable silence, unaware of the person standing in an alcove close to them who had heard everything.
He absolutely could NOT do this!
After a few minutes Kate sighed softly and rested her head on his shoulder.
“Well someone’s happy” Hermione noticed.
“Didn’t he explain what happened?” Ron asked.
Well two could play at that game.
He had given Draco an ultimatum: it was either him or his work; and Harry knew his boyfriend loved him so he would definitely choose him.
“Draco is absolutely brilliant! How he cleverly roasted Nott... oh I think I love him even more now!” Harry exclaimed to his friends.
“I was thinking... maybe I could take a little trip after school. You know, see the world a bit before settling down” Draco suggested and watched closely for Harry’s reaction.
Draco wandered the train with Snoodle.
The scent of food filled the air and for the first time ever he actually felt like he could finish a whole meal (something he hadn’t managed to do yet even almost a year after he was adopted and his diet drastically changed).
He kept his head down and resumed walking. He heard running footsteps from behind him as a hand shot out to gently grab his shoulder and stop him.
The same couldn’t be said about Harry’s dancing which was a bit more stiff: Hermione’s poor toes had suffered a lot in one night.
“I really like mint green... but grey is a nice color too” he said quietly.
“Oi Malfoy!” someone said from behind him. Unfortunately he knew this voice all too well.
Turns out one of the paparazzi had seen them going in Astoria’s apartment and kissing on the couch through the window and had snapped a few pictures.
————————————————————————————
Cedric didn’t matter. All that mattered was Draco, who was still unconscious.
“Exactly how that woman gets her information is a mystery to me. All I know is that she wrote it and all the school knows about it” Cedric said.
Once they were inside the two adults had Draco look around as they helped him select some furniture to add to his room.
Draco raised his eyebrows.
He tried opening his eyes but found his lids where too heavy.
For a second he’s breathless.
“Yeah... uhm... Harry, or anyone else for that matter, can’t know what I’m going to say to you today. Okay?” he asked.
‘Hi Draco,
Finally his tired mind caught up with the conversation.
If she was surprised at all, she didn’t show it, as she immediately wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed back just as passionately.
It felt nice to be this peaceful, for once.
“Kate I-”
Food appeared on the table and chatter quickly picked up in the large room.
“Would you like to stay for a drink? A glass of wine perhaps?” she asked shyly, standing by the door.
As Draco went upstairs to start unpacking his trunk, his parents quietly called Harry.
Draco raised his head and looked at her, willing his eyes to comunicate what his mouth refused to.
Besides, he wasn’t a broken little boy anymore. Harry would-
“Sorry” he said as he examined the plate. It had some sort of disks on it covered in a brownish liquid.
“Are you going to cry now, Nott?” Goyle laughed harder. Nott looked at the floor, knowing what Draco had said was true though not knowing how to respond.
Finally he could have the peaceful life with his boyfriend that he so desperately desired.
“Go with your friend, Draco. I’ll still be here when you come back” Kate said with a smile.
“No” Draco whispered as he looked to the ground, which was covered in dark red blood.
He also missed Draco so much!
Draco seemed to be in a daze as he placed Snoodle’s bed where it belonged.
“I didn’t want to… burden you with my problems” he said as he bowed his head. Kate gently took his chin and lifted his head to meet her eyes.
“Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll always make time for you” and then the most amazing thing happened.
There you have it! This cure is going to be mass produced and sent to hospitals all over the Wizarding World, to finally put an end to this highly contagious and horrible disease!
Many people congratulated him as the welcoming feast commenced.
Draco’s eyes widened.
Draco had tried Quidditch with James but he didn’t particularly like it: everything was too dangerous and pretty boring. All you had to do was either chase/beat a ball while balancing on a flying wooden stick up in the cold (freezing) air. It didn’t sound like his ideal afternoon of fun.
“I’m sorry about this, Draco. If I’d known they were going to take you-” Cedric apologized but Draco didn’t let him finish.
“What!? That’s what you think?! Oh no, no, no, no, No! You have got it all wrong, Draco! SHE kissed ME, against my will, just to divide us. That two-faced bitch knew you were coming in the Library, so she kissed me to make you think I didn’t want you!” Harry explained, praying that Draco believed him.
“As you can see, he’s not here” he said and turned his head back to the lake.
“That sounds good, thank you! By the way, I’m Kate!” she introduced herself as she placed some food onto her plate as well.
“We’ll go talk to Madam Pomfrey — see if she can do anything. We’ll be back with you in five minutes okay?” Lily said as her and James got up and left the room, leaving Harry, Cedric, Kate and Draco alone.
He didn’t see why Draco liked that boy; he was far better than him. If only Draco saw that...
He promised Cedric he would help and help he would. Time was against him, however, as the task was tomorrow...
She shivered as all the possible stupid things her friend would do to try and separate the two Slytherins crossed her mind.
Draco didn’t know how he had ended up here in the first place: the last thing he remembered was brewing Cedric’s potion and then nothing until now.
He couldn’t be happier. Everything was in place: Draco was in his arms, Elizabeth was nowhere in sight and Kate was far away somewhere.
People turned to look at him and he put on the most apologetic look on his face.
Draco observed his friend as much as he could with his blurry and unfocused eyes.
Mr. Ollivander’s words stunned them.
Draco simply pursed his lips together in an awkward and uncomfortable half smile.
“How are you feeling?”
They studied in the library together. She sat with him at meals. She sat next to him in class.
He postponed telling his friends as much as he could until one day, about two months after the bullying had began, Lavender noticed a nasty bruise on his upper arm.
“They were found guilty of child abuse. You won’t have to see them again. And as for where you will be staying, you’ll be living with me, my husband, James, and our son, Harry, darling. Is that alright with you? You can say no if you don’t want to” she informed him.
He shook his head no.
Not wanting to be negative, Lily started making a simple meal which she knew could stimulate Draco’s appetite: tomato soup with warm bread to dip in.
His friends nodded patiently and fortunately let the matter drop for now.
But the weirdness didn’t end there.
“I’m fourteen. How about you? You don’t look like you’re seventeen” he said. She still had some more girlish features that her older classmates lacked.
“I’ve never heard of this type of wand core” James said and Lily nodded in agreement.
As Draco left the bathroom Harry stopped him.
“Yes, but what if they stayed in Paris? What if they shared the same hotel room!? What if Draco doesn’t take me back because of her!”
“You already are normal, Draco. You’re perfect just the way you are. You’re not fat or anything and I want you to know that. You literally are the skinniest boy in our year!” Kate said. Draco recognized what she was implying.
He knew Draco wouldn’t have gone to sleep this early so maybe he was in bed, waiting for him.
Harry cleared his throat as he was reminded he wasn’t supposed to be seeing Draco right now as he would be with that two-faced bitch.
The one person that mattered to him the most was gone.
“What are you doing?” he asked. He was dressed in his Quidditch uniform, returning from an afternoon spent out flying, as Draco was busy with the Head Girl. He was in a bad mood because of this.
A lot of students and professors had come in and left flowers and well wishes and their gratitude to Draco for saving Cedric.
At least now he knew he was gay.
He looked at the clock. Well it was pretty late. He could make this decision tomorrow when he was better rested.
However there was something different about it this time: he didn’t recognize the words and the melody was different, more somber, probably because being disturbed in their natural habitat displeased the merepeople.
Draco smiled a bit.
First he picked up the purple colored one and uncorked it.
The man, of course, had taken an Unbreakabke Vow and had sworn not to tell anyone about Draco.
“I guess I could take a break for a while...” Draco muttered as he marked the page he was on and closed his Artimancy book.
————————————————————————————
As the three of them sat at the table, James and Lily started eating while Draco only picked at his food.
Ever since he could remember his parents, in particular his father, had treated him this way.
“Nott, I suggest you try aloe vera: it helps with burns” Draco said with as much confidence he could muster. Kate smiled proudly at him. She knew he could be quite passive and didn’t like to get involved with arguments.
The book had fallen open on his stomach as he slept.
“Not really, no... I just- Am I crazy for liking him?”
“I was hit in the head” he paused to cough and gather his voice “and then I remember nothing” he said. His throat really was painfully sore.
He flinched however when his head throbbed slightly.
Unfortunately both of them were completely unaware of the avid listener who had heard their ‘private’ conversation.
Draco himself had never been targeted by the man (he wondered if this was because of his natural talent for potions and because he was good and well behaved or because Sev had a soft spot for him - personally, he hoped the former) but he could understand why his Gryffindor friends weren’t keen on him: Sev was a ‘bit’ mean to them.
As they left Gringotts, Draco was quite conscious of the added weight on his right hand. He would prove them all he wasn’t like his father. He would prove he was worthy to call himself a Malfoy.
Soon it was Christmas morning and Harry woke Draco and Snoodle up by jumping on their bed and yelling “Wake up! It’s Christmas!” and then running out of the room.
“D-Draco” Harry said.
Both were still red from blushing.
Kate’s eyes turned sad as well.
“Mate, you should get it checked out” Ron said as he warily looked at the wand.
“Don’t broomsticks go in a shed or something?” he asked.
Seconds, minutes, hours, days.
“It’s fine, Draco, really. Anyway, would it be alright with you if we decorated the Great Hall in gold and white?” she asked him.
The next day was a very eventful one: Harry woke Draco up in the early hours of the morning with a snowball to the face.
“Why does he have to go with you?” Harry asked/protested.
It was only half past six so Draco wold have about an hour of rest before dinner was ready. Honestly, they didn’t know if Draco would even be hungry as he had already eaten at lunch.
“Nah, I’m used to it. British weather and all that” he told a little white lie. The truth was he was used to the dampness and cold currents of air that were in his old cell but she didn’t have to know that.
She closed her eyes and bit her lip when his hand came into light contact with the skin of her neck just below her ear.
“No... uhm... never mind...”
“But-But I just wanted for us to be together more!” Harry whined.
I can’t be with someone as controlling and jealous as you. It isn’t healthy for both of us.
The shimmer was still there as he barely managed to drag himself towards it.
As they burst in the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey was immediately by his side.
That was certain.
“Ron! There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be prepared! Final exams are in two days!” Hermione exclaimed.
He still hadn’t healed his wounds and was quite in a bit of pain, although he had gotten used to struggling through it a long time ago.
Uncertainly he teared away the wrapping paper and with wide eyes stared at her gift.
He also had formed a bond with his wand and found now he could easily cast spells and charms.
“Guys, what are you doing here?”
Harry didn’t like her one bit.
She had to do this. For him.
“I’ll take my chances” Harry answered. Draco smiled at him and turned back to his book.
“But you hurt my feelings! I require you apologize and be my personal butler for the week: at my beck and call 24/7!” Harry said while laughing, letting Draco know he wasn’t serious.
Draco looked sadly at his ruined satchel’s contents. He would have to re-do all of his homework and buy new stationary and books... he sighed.
“Oooohhhhh into incest are we, Draco?
“It mainly specializes in land investments and ownerships. It produces a steady and quite large income yearly from what we’re told but for now you don’t have to worry about that, dear: you’re young and deserve a childhood. Lessons in business can come later on” Lily said.
“I told you to close the door AFTER they’d entered not BEFORE!” Hermione hissed at a guilty looking Ron. It seemed like their plan to lock Draco and Harry in a room to force them to acknowledge their feelings for each other was going to fail, as the door to the cupboard wouldn’t open until later.
Draco was both flattered and embarrassed at the same time. He hated being the center of the attention and couldn’t wait until he was in the privacy of the curtains of his own bed that night.
Draco got up and hugged his friend tightly.
The blond reached out and caressed his pet’s soft fur. Snoodle turned around and hopped over to Draco, snuggling into him like always.
“Whatever you say, your Highness” Draco chuckled as Harry shook his head while laughing and returned to polishing his broom.
first of all I would like to thank you all for being here tonight. It is a very important evening, not only for me, but for all of those out there who’ve suffered from this horrible illness.
“Vanilla with sprinkles” he confirmed with a nod.
He had been hoping Draco would enjoy the prank and join him for a snowball battle outside.
“‘Come seek us where our voices sound’ so we know the task will take place under water...” Cedric muttered.
Just because we’re together doesn’t mean you have the right to tell me what to do, claiming it’s what’s best for me.
“It’s alright. It’s not like you were the one who planted a pin in my head” Draco attempted to joke but failed miserably.
“Uhm... yes, I was — I was just checking” Sev stuttered.
“Harry and Draco made up!”
“I can’t. I’m meeting my frien-”
Since having a gift wasn’t a common thing, they wanted to check if it was due to his traumas or to his actual powers. They knew Draco was able to heal himself the muggle way and knew which potions to take in case of an injury thanks to that monster of his father however actually being capable and good at producing that sort of spells was another thing, especially at this age.
“I’m sure he’ll come around, after all you’re his friend and the main reason he’s angry is because of what that reporter said about you”
Harry’s eyes drifted to Draco’s own ones.
Ron opened his mouth but no words came out.
“But I’m not your son. I never was. And that’s okay, because if I were, Merlin knows where I would be now” Draco said while standing up and walking to the door.
He stopped and looked at the woman in the portrait in front of him.
“Of course. I see nothing mentally wrong or unstable with this young man so the only thing we have to work on is getting his body used to eating more food than it has for the past thirteen years of his life. Habits are like a schedule that we have no control of: in this case Draco’s body has gotten so used to not receiving any food during the day that it’s decided to not make Draco suffer by uselessly stimulating his hunger” Dr. Dirwin explained.
He smiled warmly and wrapped an arm around her shoulder.
“So... uhm.... you said you have a son?”
“Harry you okay?” he asked.
He raised his left hand and gently cupped her cheek as the two finally gave into their feelings for one another.
That probably had something to do with the conversation that Astoria had told him she planned to have with the Gryffindor.
I can’t help but wonder: would Lucius Malfoy be proud of his son’s actions?
Sighing he sat at the kitchen table with a cup of tea and began reading the morning paper.
Who knew how many times Harry had been out snogging somebody while he was thinking about how sweet and caring he was.
————————————————————————————
“Is the french beauty you were talking with earlier the reason why you’re so happy?” Dean asked Draco, who blushed crimson red.
Draco fixed it as he pet him.
Draco smirked to himself as a plan came to mind.
By the way, he could tell by her reaction that he had gotten the password right.
Looks like the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy has already forgotten Draco Malfoy, ex-boyfriend of one year and a half!”
He was badly hurt when that bloody thing managed to injure through his front and back, scraping the flesh with its sharp pincers.
He heard a creaking noise and suddenly the bed dipped as Kate sat by his side.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to”
“So?” Harry asked him.
He laid on the sofa for about two hours keeping himself occupied with various activities until he heard some footsteps on the stairs.
————————————————————————————
“So... uhm... where are you going? Weren’t you with little miss ‘Lizzie’?” he growled. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Suddenly his uncle’s arms were around him, securing him in a tight hug. Draco awkwardly returned it.
Finally, he was home.
“No, thank you. I just came to ask for your permission to brew a potion that could help Cedric tomorrow, Sir” he said. Sev nodded.
“I guess so. Let’s just hope nobody else finds out then” he said.
Draco remained shocked into silence.
It was starting to become a little dark outside as the Sun was beginning to set.
Harry sighed and entered the compartment again just as Hermione was shouting at Ron while Lavender, Dean and Seamus watched as the brunette stated how it wasn’t Draco’s fault.
“Now, because you are a transfer student you will be sorted along with the First Years” Professor McGonagall said as they came to a stop in front of two large double doors.
“News and gossip travel fast here at Hogwarts”  she explained. Draco nodded and said he’d see her later. He didn’t want to keep Sev waiting.
“Yes. I’ll be here with Snoodle” he said as he patted his bunny’s head. Snoodle made a little sound of protest, he had been snoozing after all.
The two boys continued studying in silence for a few more hours.
————————————————————————————
“Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a school for young witches and wizards. There you will learn Transfiguration, Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy, History of Magic, Charms and two more electives” Lily said.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Draco. I-I didn’t mean-I was awful and conceited and too bloody arrogant” Harry said as he looked straight into Draco’s beautiful grey eyes.
Draco resisted the urge to stiffen his body and instead rested his head over hers as well.
“How’s your head?” Kate asked him as the three of them started walking to the Great Hall for dinner.
He tensed as he felt Lucius move to strike him.
He suspected James already knew that as well.
Unfortunately the woman’s back was facing the camera and he couldn’t see her face.
“I’ll just go... I’ll see you later okay?” Draco said sadly as he walked away.
When the loud group noticed him they all said they were glad to have him back.
“Well that was...unexpected. Who would have thought: Harry’s gay” James said with a little laugh. Lily turned to her husband and gave him a death stare.
As the students from the other two magical schools entered the Great Hall, Draco caught sight of a pretty and petite brunette girl dressed in a pale shade of blue that was elegantly walking and smiling along with her classmates.
He still wrote to Kate at least once a month as he valued their friendship. He was happy they had agreed to remain friends after their ‘breakup’.
Soon both of them were naked on the bed.
As he descended his stairs dressed in his winter clothing, he found Harry, Lily and James were dressed for the cold weather as well.
As he watched the blond boy from the sky he realized that this was his chance to finally be with Draco now that Kate was out of the way.
“See you later, alright?” he said as he patted Draco’s shoulder.
“Not in a million years. Even if you were the last man on earth with an eight inch manhood I would never ever have sex with you” Draco said finally.
“Vine, 13 inches, slightly springy” he said.
“You’re right” Lily answered, having heard what he had just said. Draco, despite everything, was proving to have fairly good taste. Evidently he preferred simple things to more flashy ones and didn’t like to occupy too much space, unlike her other son who instead filled his room with junk and never tidied up after himself.
————————————————————————————
“Isn’t that a Muggle book?” The red-head boy asked him.
Draco could feel his cheeks heating up slightly.
————————————————————————————
He could understand the stress: first the years of abuse, then the eating disorder, the Second Task and then going in a magical coma for a month. As if the poor thing hadn’t gone through enough.
Even from this distance Harry could immediately tell that student was gone: the body was completely unmoving and a pool of dark scarlet blood surrounded it.
“That must have been so awesome!” Dean (?) exclaimed as he asked him to tell him more.
“My stomach feels... closed. I don’t get the urge to stuff food inside it. It feels like I have some sort of plug that prevents me from eating anything, even if my stomach is empty and grumbling” he said.
James carried Draco up to his room and gently placed the sleeping boy on his bed.
Draco was already preparing to carry the bags of clothes when James magically shrunk them and handed them to Lily (who put them in her bag) while sending a quick wink at Draco.
“Why you li-”
He kept on looking at the ground and clutching his side.
As the door opened a body collided with his, almost tackling him to the ground.
“What in Merlin’s name is THIS!?” Hermione shouted at him, shoving the morning’s paper in his face.
Also, ‘love’? Who said anything about love?
I really want to believe that you’ve changed.
“I know Draco loves you very much. And I also know he was devastated by your actions lately. Despite your attitude towards him, despite your absence and the distance there’s been between you lately, I know he still loves you. Perhaps he may still be a little unsure about his feelings for you, especially if you’re going to break his heart again” she glared at him, her blue eyes slightly menacing.
These last few months haven’t been great: the constant fighting and the many disagreements have just proven to me how incompatible we are.
Was it wise to do this now? It was the start of his Sixth Year: he couldn’t spend his days pining on Harry. Cedric wasn’t there with him and he didn’t feel close enough with his Ravenclaw friends to confide in them.
“I really like you, Draco” she whispered in a breathless voice.
Draco tilted his head to the side and crossed his arms over his chest, not letting any emotion pass over him except for total indifference.
He could feel the rigid body beginning to become cold as the blood completely drained out of it.
At least now Draco knew why he had helped him.
“You don’t know what pancakes are?” Harry asked him with wide eyes.
“Ok” Draco said but refrained from calling James anything for now.
Eventually he heard the click of the door opening.
—————————————————————————————
Ron had apologized and clarified he didn’t think he was weird but Draco still wasn’t so sure. It was moments like this (when his insecurities showed) that he would replay in his head what Cedric had said on the ride home; Harry had been also a great source of comfort and Draco was really grateful to him.
Draco ran up the stairs and opened his bedroom door, finding the little black rabbit perched on his bed by the pillow.
The three of them had stayed up until the early hours of the morning discussing Harry and Draco’s relationship, and while the brunette still couldn’t accept that the blond had left him, he was also unwilling to admit that not everything was Draco’s fault.
The young Malfoy was adopted only a year ago by James and Lily Potter, who took the boy in after Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy mysteriously disappeared.
“Yes, Sir. Cedric said I was better off if I tried to do this alone”
“‘Oh my God’! Is that all you can say, ‘Oh My God!?’” Hermione shouted at him.
By dinner time the whole school knew what had happened that morning during breakfast and a few people had congratulated him about what he had said.
An hour long you'll have to look,
“At least let’s share some body heat” she said coyly and Draco had to stop himself from smirking. Instead he boldly wrapped his left arm around her waist and pulled her in to lean on him. She rested her head on his shoulder and exhaled loudly in content.
“Ehm... kind of? I mean he’s... he’s...” Draco was slightly attracted to him and had to admit he was fairly good looking.
“Alright then! We’ll floo this time because I don’t want to risk your health by apparating again”
“Merlin! I have a crush on Draco...” he said.
“Thank you” he whispered as he buried his face into Harry’s neck and snuggled into him.
His test had been perfect, as expected, so he was very happy about that as well. When Sev has heard about what he did in the Great Hall he hugged Draco and told him how proud he was that he wasn’t scared by bullies. Draco suspected it reminded the man of that time he helped the blond against the three Slytherins who had cast the Jelly-Legs Jinx on him.
Draco just hoped all the drama was soon going to be forgotten so he could go back to being invisible again.
“Hello, sorry to bother you but can you tell me what is this?” she said in a remarkably good english as she pointed to a platter filled with food.
Draco turned his head and smiled apologetically at Harry, who was looking like a kicked puppy at the moment.
Kate sighed and accepted his coat.
I’m sorry it ended the way it did but I just wanted to say I’ll always have a place for you in my heart and I won’t forget the time we had together.
“Hi” he said softly.
“Well, have you considered some options?”
He turned right and went deeper into the lake’s depths. There were fish and aquatic plants all around him. To his luck none of them were aggressive and simply ignored him as he passed by them. Just in case he always kept his wand close by in its pouch and every few minutes he checked to see if it was still there.
Cheers erupted from the Ravenclaw table as he got up and walked towards it. He sat down beside some boys who looked like they were his age.
As he had just finished Potions his next destination was DADA. He was walking down the corridor that led away from the Dungeons when someone cast on him from behind a Jelly-Legs Curse. As he fell to the floor he heard someone laughing.
Particularly one showed Draco lifting Astoria and pinning her up against the wall, her legs wrapped around his waist and her hands pressed against the wall by one of his.
Hopefully Elizabeth had gotten the message and would leave him alone from now on.
“ATTENTION: THE TASK WILL BE STARTING IN ONE MINUTE” a magically amplified voice sounded across the the stands.
They knew Harry’s crush on Draco and they also knew about Draco and Kate.
“I don’t know... maybe? I-I don’t really know what I’m feeling...” he blushed more and Harry felt like he had died and gone to Heaven.
Kate looked up.
“Hey” he said.
—————————————————————————————
Although they hadn’t done anything too serious, he liked to think that at least he had gained somewhat a bit of experience in relationships and knew this one had been a very happy one.
“No, it’s-it’s quite alright” Sev quickly said.
Mostly he still felt betrayed and hurt and didn’t want to even think about how much it hurt when he saw Harry kissing Elizabeth.
He smiled to himself and closed his eyes as he apparated home.
“We weren’t right for each other, Tori. He couldn’t accept me for who I was. Anyway... I don’t really want to talk about it” Draco said quietly, still feeling hurt about the subject.
“We understand perfectly that Draco left you because of your continuous criticisms, Harry James Potter. Hell, if it had been me, I would have kicked your ass out of the door in five minutes!” Hermione said.
“I wish to schedule another appointment with you in about two months, just to check everything is proceeding correctly”
He desperately looked for Draco anywhere he could think of but with no results.
“There’s this house in school called ‘Slytherin’ that’s filled with racist gits and their colors are dark green and silver” Harry said and Draco raised an eyebrow.
————————————————————————————
He left Snoodle to his meal and descended to see if anyone was awake.
“Because I don’t. I think more gets done if I study alone on my bed with the curtains shut. Sometimes I may revision with them but otherwise I don’t...”
“I’m fine! Sorry about that. Did I hurt you?”
“I’m counting on that. I’ll be waiting for you” she winked at him and spread her legs slightly.
He still missed him despite everything...
The thought alone made him smile brightly to himself.
His mind took a moment to register what this meant: Kate was kissing him.
“To add a little more color to you room” she said as she gave him the white orchid.
“Sorry if this may sound weird but I really like your smell. I take it’s some kind of cologne?” Kate said after a moment and Draco nodded.
Draco’
“Depends. What’s ‘normal’ to you?” somebody said from behind him.
He stood with his suitcase as he said goodbye to his family and friends. He wanted to kiss Harry so badly but didn’t as he didn’t feel comfortable with PDA yet. He settled for a long hug and Harry, knowing not to push him, didn’t try anything. They had said their goodbyes in private anyway.
“Detention with Flitwick. Seamus blew up his inkwell again and Dean cursed him out loud. You should have seen it, Draco, simply hilarious!” Lavender giggled.
“You can say that again” Terry muttered.
“On the contrary they could feed me just fine, they just chose... not to.” Draco didn’t want to say too much. He knew Harry wouldn’t go around gossiping to anyone about what he was telling him, however he didn’t want to be pitied either by his friend. Harry was rather protective and had already told him to inform him if anyone was rude to him at school so he would take care of them. As if he was going to take him up on that offer...
Everyone found out.
He was quite nervous actually about meeting his ‘brother’... what if he didn’t want him? What if he thought he wanted to steal his place in the family? What if he didn’t like his personality? WHAT IF HE DIDN’T LIKE SNOODLE?
He had worried what was going to happen once he went back to school: would he have a relapse? Would his friends find out of his eating disorder and not want to be with him anymore? Would they think he was even more weird? What would he say to them when they asked why he was taking pills?
“Sure thing, professeur” she said with a hint to her french accent and left the two alone.
The Ravenclaw mumbled something as he took the pills and drank the potions with them.
Suddenly Mrs. Potter turned around and he immediately stopped walking, thankful for the little pause. He panted quietly, trying to not make any sounds.
As he said goodbye and entered the castle by its main doors he was immediately engulfed in a tight hug by Kate, who carefully made sure she didn’t touch his head. Stitches and all that...
He sat there in his seat, frozen, as Professor Dumbledore finished his speech.
He would get Draco back.
However he had no idea what Harry could have done that could anger/hurt Draco that much...
“That’s it!” You’re brilliant! That’s exactly what we need to do!” Hermione said in a frenzy as she started muttering and planning every single little detail about her plan.
When Harry woke up it was already morning.
“Snoodle!” Draco said as he picked him up and hugged him to his chest.
Hermione looked at Harry pointedly.
“Healer Thorns, this boy needs medical attention immediately, see that he is brought to a room and stabilized” he said. The lady nodded and swiftly moved the bed in front of her while she walked.
When they apparated home Draco went up to his room and started planning an organized schedule which he would follow to keep record of his meals. Every time his wand vibrated meant it was time for him to eat something and his wand would register how many times he ignored this ‘call’ and how many times he actually ate something.
“It’s fine” Kate said as he distanced himself from her a bit and turned around.
“Oh... ok” he said and looked down at his book.
Draco looked amazing and Harry had to make an effort not to stare at him for the whole duration of the ball: he was wearing black robes with a white shirt underneath that enhanced his fair complexion and beautiful ass. Unfortunately also Kate looked stunning in her mint green flowy dress.
He turned his head toward Lavender to ask her about Hermione’s pet but she was giving him a shocked look.
“I have to go now... my friends will want to know about Draco...” Harry said, a bit embarrassed about crying on Draco to his parents. He rushed off to Gryffindor Tower.
James quickly glanced at his friend, Sirius, who also was an auror, and the two of them shared a quick smile.
“He’s not breathing!” he heard someone say.
“Draco! I didn’t hear you come down!” he said as he set a plate in front of him on the table.
“I really like your wand, Dray. Can I try it?” Lavender purred in his ear as she reached to take his wand from his hand. She had sat close next to him when they boarded the train.
‘That’s odd...’ he thought as he glanced down at the letter.
“Yeah! I’m having a hard time coming to therms with it” he said.
Draco recognized the handwriting instantly..
“Will the Head Boy and Head Girl please head to the Headmaster’s office after dinner?” a voice called from his far right.
“This is Draco” he said.
There on the bed lay a sleeping Draco. He looked so peaceful...
Cedric would keep his secret.
Ron was about to say something more but Lavender reappeared by his side and dragged him away to the dance floor again.
He took it and immediately recognized Sev’s handwriting.
“Took you long enough. Not surprising, to be honest, the guy is bloody handsome!” Lavender said.
She smiled sadly as she stood on the other side of Draco’s bed.
“What-What  d-do you mean?” she stammered, the faintest of blushes gracing her cheeks.
—————————————————————————————
“Do you like yourself, Nott?” Draco suddenly asked and looked at Nott.
“What is this?” he asked.
Nott had introduced himself during his second day at Hogwarts (and by ‘introduced’ he meant shoved him against a wall and told him exactly who was ‘the boss’ there). Draco who wasn’t physically strong could do nothing except for stay silent. He had suffered much worser things than this during his childhood: he could take a little bullying.
“I think it’s fairly simple: they’ve taken something you’d sorely miss if you lost it and you have an hour to retrieve this object. If you don’t: then you’ll not get it back. Can you think of something you’d miss a lot? ” Draco asked.
