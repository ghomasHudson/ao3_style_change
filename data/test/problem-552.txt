Draco nodded, sensing Harry’s desire to change the subject, and they continued walking along the river. “I got a promotion, so they moved me from the Manchester bureau a year and a half ago,” Draco said.
Harry found other ways to distract himself, too. He checked a couple more museums off the list he’d made with Draco, which weren’t nearly so interesting without a certain someone’s snide commentary, but he made do. He gave Neville uninformed suggestions on new plants to stock and he listened to Luna lay out plans to set up Ginny with Cho Chang, a rugby player who had recently signed up for Luna’s introductory gouache class.
Thunder boomed overhead; lightning split the sky. A wet finger of rain trickled down Harry’s neck; droplets clung to his curls of hair; moisture fogged his glasses.
Harry remembered the notes Draco had left on his door waxing rhapsodic about danishes, of all things, and the way he had stood silhouetted against the sun, the furtive glances and hand squeezes. His heart clawed its way up his throat.
“Could I actually get two of those?” he asked the barista. She nodded, tapping in the order, but since he wasn’t sure if his neighbour liked cardamom buns, he also bought an apple cinnamon danish, a cherry tart, and a chocolate brioche, just in case.
So this was a first. Draco hadn’t dwelt on the fact that he played football at all; he’d wanted to hear about Harry’s awful night instead. Harry loved his friends more than anything, but he hadn’t realised that he missed meeting and spending time with other people too, people who neither swarmed him in public nor reminded him daily about embarrassing moments from uni, like when he brought Parvati Patil to his first leaver’s ball and then ignored her for the rest of the night to hang off Oliver’s arm instead (he hadn’t been nearly as subtle about his infatuation as he had thought, as it turned out). He was grateful to have friends who had stuck by his side for so long, but he wanted new connections too. He supposed he was relatively new to the national team, but that was different. They talked in the locker rooms as they threw on their football kits, and then they played, and then they went home. No one there had ever tried to forge a deeper relationship with Harry, and no one was going to. Now that he was thinking about it, he’d been lonely for a lot longer than he was comfortable admitting.
“Why’d you move in with your godfather? If you don’t mind me asking…” Draco was still pointedly looking over the water, his shoulders bunched by his ears.
He folded the blanket, leaving it and the pillow stacked on the arm of the settee. He unplugged his mobile from the wall and left the charger coiled on the coffee table, cleaned out their glasses in the sink and moved the coasters to their station on the kitchen counter. Harry appraised his handiwork and frowned. It was still obvious that someone had spent the night on the couch, but he didn’t know what else he could do to tidy up. He’d have to make it up to Draco another way.
Harry sucked in a breath. “I would love to, but I have an away game on Wednesday, so I’ll be heading to Brussels tomorrow. Is there another day that would work for you?”
Draco froze, visibly panicked, his eyes stretched wider than they should ever have been able to go. “It’s not that simple.”
“Of course I’m sure. What else would I be doing right now, anyway?” Both men glanced down at the folder on the table between them, then back up at each other. Harry waited for Draco to take back the request, given their shared acknowledgement of his flimsy reasoning, but he said nothing. Instead, Draco shifted uncomfortably, then gave a shy smile, and even though Harry barely knew his neighbour, he somehow knew this moment was significant. Even when his flat had been invaded in the middle of the night and he was clearly not dressed for company and he had a fucking pen behind his ear, Draco had been fully in control. And now that they’d settled in, the clock inching toward three am, he was letting himself be vulnerable.
Draco coughed, then took a long gulp of wine. Harry’s eyes traced the line of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed. “Sorry. No, the most exciting news at the office is that my boss got a dog, and the public cares about that even less than I do.”
“No complaints! I’ve just been repotting orchids,” he said, gesturing to the plants on the counter in front of him. “They get a bit temperamental when I don’t give them enough attention.”
“Should I trust you in the kitchen?” Draco said, his voice betraying his smirk, even though Harry couldn’t quite see it.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve never had to call one before, but I’d expect so. That’s all right though; I did lock myself out. That’s the price to be paid.”
Harry offered up a sheepish smile and a Tate Modern bag brimming with prints and books and the like. Ron grinned back at the pair of them, his freckles dancing on his cheeks. “We’re just happy you could make it,” he said, opening the door wider. “Everyone’s out back, if you want to come on through.”
“Oh. All right.” Several moments passed, and Harry stared out the front window, trying to distinguish the reflection of the lights in the bus from the innards of the city.
“My ex is the one who leaked the news,” Harry blurted, then gulped down half a glass of water, so he could avoid seeing everyone’s reactions. When he set it down, the whole team was still staring at him.
He loved London on Sunday mornings, especially when the weather was like this: the cool side of perfect, a gentle breeze wicking the sweat from the nape of his neck. There were people on the streets, strolling with their families or taking photos in front of shops with brick backdrops, but it was nothing like the chaos of a Monday morning, when everyone was
When Harry’s alarm went off the next morning, Draco groaned and pulled him in closer. Harry grappled for his mobile on the bedside table, to turn off its incessant blaring. This was made decidedly more difficult by the arms wrapped around his torso, pulling him back into a sea of blankets and his boyfriend’s warm embrace.
Harry plugged his mobile in, made sure it was charging, and waited for a few minutes. Draco scrawled something in the corner of one of the sheets in his file.
Draco sighed in a put-upon way, even as he smirked back at Harry. “Yes, I suppose that was our arrangement.”
“Come over to mine?” Zacharias suggested, placing a hand on top of Harry’s and squeezing. When Harry finally broached eye contact with the blond, he found himself distracted by a smear of tomato sauce by his lip.
She extracted a cigarette from her purse, lighting up with practised insouciance. Harry squirmed under her gaze as she studied him again, eyes dark and penetrating. Pansy inhaled deeply, continuing to stare at Harry, who was beginning to wonder if he had something on his face.
“How charming.” She took another drag of her cigarette, eyes narrowing at Harry. “You seem all right, even if you are famous.” He opened his mouth to thank her, unsure how else to respond, but she ignored this and continued the speech she had clearly prepared. “However, you should know that nothing on this planet matters more to me than Draco’s happiness, and if I hear a single word about you hurting him, I
Draco shrugged again. “I can ask, but it should be fine. I put in more than enough overtime to justify a morning off. That is, if you want me to come.” He bit his lip and glanced away, the vulnerability in his expression thickening the air between them.
A few minutes later, creamy orange soup had been ladled into four ceramic bowls, its tangy scent wafting through the air, and slabs of Hermione’s brown bread were stacked on top of one another in the middle of the kitchen table. Ron fetched Harry a fresh cup of tea, too.
After he heard the door click shut behind Draco, Harry got to business. He brushed his teeth at the kitchen sink, then laid out the blanket across the sofa. He knew Draco had told him he didn’t need to worry about staying late into the morning, but he didn’t want to impose any more than he already had done. His neighbour had already been far nicer to him than, well, anyone had been, since he’d become a name and a face people knew, and he didn’t want to ruin it now.
Harry knew he had the best friends in the world, and he loved them more than anything. But part of him still longed for something else, for
no. He marched up to the hostess and asked if she could show him over to the table reserved for two under the name “Harry Potter,” and she did so, with the bedazzled glaze in her eyes that meant that she knew just who Harry Potter was. He’d always been a stellar football player, and everyone in the sports world had known his name for a few years, but his fame had kicked off in broader circles after he’d been recruited to the English national team. Stories circulated about the
He was slightly taken aback. “I… of course. I don’t want to hurt him. I—” Harry’s brain flitted back to that moment at Ron and Hermione’s the week previous, when he’d caught Draco laughing in the candlelight. He remembered the easy way they touched one another in private: their feet nudging each other under the table as they sat down to eat, and Draco’s hand on Harry’s elbow as they slid sock-footed across the kitchen as they did
“That’s all right.” Ron gave him a small smile. “A little bit of water never hurt anyone.” Harry choked out a laugh, and Rose toddled over to join them, wrapping her arms around Harry’s knee. They all stood there for a moment, silent, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder how he had found such an extraordinary best friend.
“That is my name, yes,” Draco tried to quip, but his voice hitched on the words. Harry took a half-step forward, then paused. They were staring at one another and they were breathing the same air, and Harry waited for Draco to break the moment again, but he didn’t move. Neither of them did. The tension was growing thicker with every shared inhalation until Harry thought he might burst with it. Carefully, he untangled one of his hands from Draco’s and moved it to the other man’s jaw, sliding his thumb across his cheekbone. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut at the touch.
Draco’s light was on when Harry returned home that evening, a golden beacon flashing from the third storey balcony. Harry gazed up at it and shuddered in the evening air, still heavy and hot from the day’s thick blanket of storm clouds. They’d opened up a crack for the first time that day, exposing a shard of inky sky and a sliver of dewy moonshine. Harry stared at it for a long moment, then gathered his nerves and marched up the three flights of stairs.
“Why did you ask what had happened to my parents on our first walk? If you covered football, surely you already knew.”
As the laughter died down, the eyes of the group swivelled toward Harry and Draco, and Harry gave an awkward wave. Hermione leapt from her seat to hug him, her belly large and round between them, her coils of brown hair tickling his cheek.
Pansy waved the point away, then turned her attention to Harry, who knew this official introduction was important but still found himself distracted by the smudge of lipstick Pansy had left on Draco’s jaw, absently wiping it off with his thumb.
Even though he’d never seen her before, Harry had no trouble recognising Pansy Parkinson when she stepped through customs and strode through the terminal. Her hair fell in a sharp black line to her jaw, her heeled black boots clicked across the floor, and her crimson lipstick perfectly matched her glossy nails. She looked every bit the editor of a Parisian fashion magazine. Draco had explained in the car on the way to the airport that they had met at journalism school in Paris and had bonded over being from England, then later, over being queer. He’d been sad to leave her behind when he got his offer with the
Draco never answered the text, but there was a knock on Harry’s door at eight sharp. He’d only just come home himself a few minutes prior; Coach Shacklebolt seemed intent on working the team to death.
“I’m sorry, I don’t think I can,” he said, in what he hoped was a regretful tone. “It’s been great getting to know you, but I’m absolutely knackered tonight. I think I might be coming down with something, so I should probably head home.”
Grinning to himself, Harry checked inside the envelope, and sure enough, it had a ten-pound note, a fountain pen, and a horrible keychain, shaped like a red jersey with “10” and “Potter” emblazoned onto the back. Oh, he was
Harry bit his lip and bent back down to pick up his offerings from Bean Thinking of You, trying to remind his tongue how to form words. “Well, since I caused you so much trouble the other day, I’m here to give you another apple cinnamon danish, as requested.” He handed Draco the crinkled paper bag and one of the cups of coffee. “And my friend Luna swears by this tea when she needs inspiration, so I thought perhaps that could help with your case.” Harry passed over the box of tea as well, pretending not to see the bemused smile on Draco’s lips. “And I was also going to ask if you wanted to take a walk along the Thames, since it’s rather lovely outside, but it looks as if you’re busy.” Harry didn’t know where that bit had come from. He hadn’t been planning to take a walk along the Thames, and he hadn’t been planning to talk with Draco in the middle of a workout, and he certainly hadn’t been planning to do both of those things at the same time.
He pulled out a sheet of paper and the fountain pen Draco had given him, then shook his head. This was stupid. As Draco had once said, they both had perfectly good mobile phones.
“I am so sorry for being late,” he said to the man nursing a cup of tea in the corner booth that Harry favoured. The man wasn’t exactly Harry’s type—he looked a little too much like Uncle Vernon for comfort—but Harry had never known Luna to lead someone astray with a blind date before.
“Whatever is easiest,” Harry said. He’d given up on staring at his blank mobile screen and instead focused his gaze on Draco’s back as he poured seltzer into two glasses. Harry could see his shoulder blade moving underneath his thin t-shirt, and something deep inside him began to stir. Draco carefully sliced two wedges of lemon and fixed them on the rims of the glasses, then returned to the living room. He held out one of the cups, then took a sip from his own.
“I did too,” Harry mumbled, embarrassed to find tears leaking out of his eyes. Ron didn’t comment on it, reaching over and wrapping him in a hug instead. Harry shuddered at the warmth of it, and despite his best efforts, a couple of tears traced their way down his cheeks and onto Ron’s jumper. He was
“Things are heating up over here!” she called out. “The teams, then: I’ll take Neville and Luna, and you take Draco and Ron?” Everyone nodded their assent and went to stand with their teams, and then the game began, ending only when Ron accidentally kicked the ball to the roof. Harry was grinning and mud-splattered; Draco’s cheeks had flushed faintly and a slight sheen of sweat had darkened the hair at the base of his neck, and Harry couldn’t resist the urge to give him a quick kiss, which Draco returned, even as his blush deepened.
Harry spun around, losing his footing on the smooth tile floor and crashing onto his back. He looked up to see Malfoy standing over him, looking vaguely apologetic as he bent to help Harry up.
The walk to the Astronomy Tower felt unending. Harry wasn’t sure if it was his cane, or if it was the dread of returning to the place he hadn’t been since sixth year. Regardless, he made it to the tower just as the clock struck midnight. He took a deep breath and began his ascent.
“Well, there’s not much I could do about it, even if it wasn’t okay,” Malfoy said with a shrug. “You’re not horribly unattractive.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the ceiling, but followed Draco up more stairs than Harry even realised the Manor had.
Not that he wasn’t incredibly pleased that Draco was accepting of Muggle technology. He’d never dreamt he’d hear Draco Malfoy, of all people, confess his love for Muggle technology. And he really did love it; Harry had almost fainted when he walked in on Draco trying to work a computer.
“That’s two questions, Potter,” Draco said quietly. “I’m not giving my answers up as easily as you.”
Harry doesn’t respond. He stands up and goes to bed. He doesn't mean to sleep, but when he awakes screaming to the image of Hermione's werewolf mangled body, he doesn't allow himself to sleep for three days.
“Did I tell you Mrs. Greengrass introduced me to her youngest daughter Astoria the other day? She was very sweet and--”
Harry’s cane clattered to the floor and he felt several pairs of eyes turn to look at him. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t
Harry closed his eyes, forcing himself to breathe, but all he could see was Remus and Tonks. Fred. Collin. Snape.
My internet's still out, so I am currently in my university's business school using the internet. The things I do for fandom. Anyway, this is mostly based on my headcanon that Draco actually really likes sweets. Thank you for reading! <3
“Maybe we’ll get lucky and one of George’s fireworks will misfire, and we’ll all have to leave early,” Harry muttered, grimacing apologetically at the furious scowl Draco sent him. To be honest, he’d rather face a horde of angry and betrayed Weasleys than one angry Draco. With that thought in mind, he took Draco’s hand and let the flames whisk them away.
The man had brown skin, flushed red from the cold wind outside, and there were strands of wild black hair escaping from the red hat he’d crammed on his head. Judging by the strain the fabric was under, Draco suspected the man’s head would be just as warm without the hat.
Draco spelled off the lights in the room, and Harry’s eyes drifted shut, and he let Draco’s quiet heartbeat lull him to sleep.
Harry took slow and careful steps down the front steps of Hogwarts and onto the grounds. All around them, the world was white with snow, and Harry was freezing. Draco, on the other hand, looked entirely too pleasant.
„Are you going to stand there and annoy me with your breathing or are you going to come in?“ Draco called out. He ignored his mother‘s pointed glare.
Potter glided toward him. God, Draco had completely forgotten, how Potter's staggeringly tight trousers fit his thighs and arse. He'd removed his robes as soon as they entered the office and his appearance was driving Draco crazy already. He was wearing the bloody braces as well! Potter stopped a short distance away from Draco. Surely there was barely a foot between them now. Draco's breath caught in his throat.
"You see the button over here? You push it and a beam of light comes out from this end," Draco explained slowly.
„He‘s been in severe pain for the last half an hour at least. I found him on the floor where he‘d fainted. There was some vomit too. He‘s been complaining about being tired since Monday but it was never this serious,“ Harry said in one breath.
"I'm sorry, oh mighty Saviour of the Wizarding World. Did you expect fireworks?" Malfoy sneered at him.
Draco woke up disoriented. The sheets were too scratchy and Harry‘s warm body wrapped around him was missing. He opened his eyes and blinked slowly. The ceiling was all wrong. He was not in Harry‘s bedroom. Neither was he in his flat or at the Manor. It took him a while to realize where he was. The recollection immediately assailed his memory with snippets of the previous evening. Harry shouting at him, the terrible pain running through his body, fainting on the floor of his flat, waking up to Harry‘s panic-stricken face, the hospital, Harry‘s eyes brimming with tears.
"I will do something really stupid now. Promise me you'll do the right thing, promise me you'll do what needs to be done," he whispers against Draco's lips.
„Well, it‘s not like it was supposed to stay a secret any longer, was it?“ Ron shifted in his seat uncomfortably.
"Are you aware of any violent deaths inside the house in the past?" Draco steered his question in a different direction.
It seemed to work as Harry shook off the beginnings of the malaise that had been creeping on him, lifted his wand, and shouted the incantation out loud. "
A bolt of lightning flashed in the sky followed by a rumble of distant thunder. The white, bright light illuminated the attic briefly. Harry could see the slopes of the gable roof, supported by sturdy wooden beams. There were several skylights above him and behind him, providing at least some source of light from the streetlamps, if not from the overcast sky. Harry stepped carefully onto the attic floor and wiped his dusty hands on his jeans.
"Eight degrees," he informed Draco when his blond hair appeared in the opening in the floor. Harry looked around again, trying to locate the origin of the creaking sound he'd heard before. A shiver ran down his spine. He had a bad feeling about this place. Which made it the right place to be.
Potter lifted his hand and stroked his fingers along Draco's cheek. "Are you sure you want to do this?"
"Oh God I can't anymore," Harry begged. "Let me go." He tried to push off of Draco's chest half-heartedly.
Home, was this really Draco‘s home? Harry pondered. Now that he was relatively calm, he was trying to figure out what he‘d missed. There was never any inclination Draco was cheating on him. He never smelt like a different man, never behaved differently, Harry had never seen even the slightest flicker of guilt in his eyes. How long had Draco been cheating on him? Why? And when did Draco find time to cheat? Yes, this week was an exception but before Monday, they‘d spent all of their free time together. Draco was always home when Harry arrived from work, he‘d always found a small present from Draco on the coffee table in front of the fireplace. Sometimes it was a chocolate frog, other times a cupcake from a Muggle bakery nearby. Even though Draco almost never told Harry he loved him, his actions spoke the words for him. Surely Draco loved him, no one could pretend love this convincingly, this deeply. Harry was sure of it. Why would Draco cheat on him then? Harry had to ask Draco if it was true and he promised himself, he would ask calmly.
„You‘re right, I‘m sorry. It‘s just… Draco‘s been behaving really weird these past few days. He's been staying long hours at work. He‘s never done that before. And he‘s too tired to… you know,“ Harry blushed slightly.
"I miss him," she sighed, shoulders slumped. A single tear ran down her cheek and Harry wiped it off gently. "I miss him so much I can't breathe sometimes. There are moments when something good happens to me and the first thing that pops into my mind is that I have to tell him. I want him to see our baby grow, I want him to hug me, kiss me, make me laugh. Harry, what do I do?"
Harry pressed closer to Draco, and tilted his head up, smiling radiantly. "I mean it Draco, you are rather overwhelmingly wonderful."
Everyone knew that Neville's parents had been tortured by the Death Eaters during Voldemort's first rise to power. The Cruciatus curse had been cast on them repeatedly and they were exposed to its effects for long minutes at times, so much so that their minds didn't survive the constant pain. Even now, the husks of their bodies were kept alive in Janus Thickey ward in St. Mungo's.
„You were, but in this case, it actually worked out well for me,“ Hermione laughed out loud. „Madame Pomfrey used a charm to shrink my teeth back to normal. I might have forgotten to stop her on time and she shrunk them a bit more than their original size.“
Malfoy's eyes were half-lidded and he was chewing the inside of his cheek. "No, it's the same one I've worn since… well, since forever."
"What is your least favourite one?" Potter asked curiously, all mentions of wanking seemingly forgotten.
Draco stood up and smoothed his trousers just as the client entered his office. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Gladstone. My name is Draco Malfoy and this is my associate, Mr. Potter. Please sit down and tell us what troubles you."
Pansy yawned and took another drag from the cigarette, her expression daring Malfoy to make her. Their gazes locked and the battle of wills was almost palpable in the air. In the end, Malfoy gave up, rolled his eyes, and disappeared back into the depths of his office with a sigh.
Fuck, Draco thought. He should not be visible, he still had the Disillusionment Charm around him. It must be those strange lenses the wizard was wearing, he thought. Draco bolstered his Protego spell and prepared to spring. He feigned a jump to the left, rolling into a crouch to his right instead, and fired a Stupefy on the wizard. The spell hit the robber straight in the chest and the wizard tumbled to the floor, unconscious. Draco breathed out and secured the offender with an additional Incarcerous to bind him in place. He conjured a Patronus and sent a message to Potter: STILL ALIVE. DON'T SEND PATRONUS BACK. CAREFUL, THEY SEE THROUGH DISILLUSIONMENT.
The lock clicked and the door opened slowly, revealing a disgruntled-looking Harry. His eyes were red-rimmed and his cheeks tear-stained. Draco gulped. He felt as if someone stabbed him through the heart.
Harry sighed and wiped the tears off of his face. Wallowing in self-pity wouldn't help him. He ran a dusty hand through his hair. He was going to make a difference, he told himself. He just had to figure out the Sources. And when Hermione finetuned the spell to extract the ectoplasm, they were going to come closer to solving the Problem. Harry got back to his feet and nodded to himself. As he started out of the room, he noticed that while he'd been brooding, it had gotten dark outside. The ghosts would be out soon and Harry still had to search the cellar. He increased his pace and almost flew down the stairs to the basement. He wanted to leave the house as soon as possible, but not before he located at least one of the Sources. The walls of the basement, as well as the floor, were concrete so Harry didn't have to worry about any bones being buried underneath the floor. He started ripping the mattresses off the cots with a Diffinido spell, levitating the broken pieces of the furniture into an empty corner. He was getting frantic, knowing that any time now, the ghosts would appear and he would have to deal with them. He had to hope he had enough salt in his pockets.
Sure enough, the mini hurricanes turned out to be Al and James, and they did not look happy. Oh, he was in for it now.
,” Draco sniffed, but this seemed to only amuse her even more. He gave her his best glare, although to little effect. “You know, you’re quite different from what I expected as well.”
“Oh, darling, you know better than to call at a girl’s room unannounced. I could have been changing, you know.”
about Potter looking so vulnerable. He was supposed to be all things light; full of spirit and life and daring. He wasn’t supposed to look drained and helpless because of Draco’s stupidity.
Draco pulls off the pumpkin and Harry’s scowl deepens when he sees that the prat has had the sense to cast a Bubble-Head Charm over his head before putting the pumpkin on. Draco’s laughing as if he doesn’t give two Knuts to the fact that his boyfriend is still lying on the ground, bruised and cold. Harry really hopes Harpy-lady hasn’t seen this little affair.
He swerved to avoid another Bludger and that’s when he saw it – the Snitch sitting smack in the middle of the playing field. How it had managed to get there unnoticed, Draco had no clue. He didn’t stop to ask questions though, too busy whizzing towards the Snitch, urging his broom to go faster as he saw Potter make a similar dive.
knew with him. He probably genuinely thinks he needs this many to decorate their house for Halloween.
“Relax, Potter, we didn’t go all the way, although not for lack of wanting on my part. He, on the other hand, insisted that I needed something more meaningful for
Strong arms snaked around Draco’s waist and pressed him even more firmly against the wall. Potter’s hard body pressed up against him from the front so that there wasn’t a hair’s breadth between them and Draco shivered at the feel of Potter against him, angling his head to deepen the kiss as he urged Potter to take control. When Potter’s tongue licked along the seam of his lips, he opened up obligingly, accepting Potter into his mouth with a happy sigh. Their tongues slid against each other in wet heaven and Draco moved one of his hands to bury in Potter’s hair, finding it surprisingly soft and delighting in the appreciative groan Potter gave when he ran his fingers through the raven locks.
They chose their sides and soon the game was in full swing. Potter turned out to be a rather abysmal player though so Draco tried to go easy on him, if only to keep the game going on longer. About halfway through the game Potter suddenly broke the silence with a question.
“Move aside!” Molly bellowed, hurrying over to kneel at his other side. “Draco, dear, can you sit up?”
“Let’s see,” Potter clasped his hands under his chin. “You already know I didn’t return for eighth year. Ron and I had been offered free passes into Auror training, even without our NEWTS.”
Draco took a fortifying breath. He didn’t know what he was doing anymore. “If you don’t need anything, then I’m leaving.” He tried to turn away but Harry grasped his arm tight enough to bruise.
“What’s the matter, Death Eater, a little water too much for you to handle?” the boy taunted, face scrunching up in a piss-poor attempt of a sneer. Draco personally thought that it looked more like he was suffering from a bad stomach-ache but he benevolently kept it to himself.
Granger cleared her throat loudly and everyone finally looked at her. She not so subtly nudged Weasel and he stepped forward, taking a moment to inhale and exhale deeply before looking at Draco.
Draco’s words hit Harry like a tonne of bricks. He’d never thought of it like that before. Even after all these years, Harry still chokes up at the thought of that day; Myrtle’s screams echoing through the room, the blood in the water, the metallic smell in the air, Draco’s deadly pale face… The first time he’d seen the scars, Harry had almost had a panic attack, and he feels like hexing himself for being so thoughtless. How could he have possibly thought this was a good idea?
“You’re Sirius’ heir and the new Head of the House, it’s only proper that you be a part of the tree.” Draco’s words were stuttering now. “Your– your descendants will appear on it too then. Any children you might have.” He held Potter’s unwavering gaze, heart breaking at the thought of Potter starting a life that he could never feature in.
“Potter, get your hand off me before I hex it off.” Draco was working on autopilot now. It was almost as if he was trapped in a body that wasn’t his own. One that had a cold face and a cruel voice and said things that hurt Harry.
Pansy stared at him for a long while, a pained expression on her face. “Remind me why we put up with you?”
Draco could feel a stir of panic forming in his gut. It was all going to be over soon. No more spending time with Potter. No more bantering, and arguing and laughing together. No more sneaking glances or stealing touches. No more of everything that had quickly become his whole world. He was going to be thrown aside again, as oftentimes happened.
Potter stubbornly jutted out his chin. “No.” He tried to do it again and yelped when Draco slapped his hand away.
Draco smirks. “I suppose that would be an acceptable start to how you make up for giving me such a scare.” Harry smirks right back, releasing Draco and gently pushing him towards the door.
Draco was too emotionally drained to get into it today and Mercury seemed to get the hint, giving his ear an affectionate nibble before alighting onto his perch. Just as Draco was pulling the coverlet over him, there was a knock at his door. He sat up, calling for whoever it was to enter.
the eldest living Black male, though seeing as how I’ve already inherited the Malfoy properties, I would have given the Black estate to my cousin.”
“Oh tosh, it isn’t exclusive like that. Anyone is free to come. There’ll be free food anyways.” she said with a laugh.
Draco cursed his luck and wondered if it would be acceptable to hide in the loo for the rest of the afternoon.
“I should have taken you up on your offer to come to Italy.” Draco rubbed his eyes tiredly. “If Ginny kills me…”
“....and Theo would be reading a book and steadfastly ignoring both Daphne and Millie’s attempts at getting his attention,” Draco finished with a laugh. “That
Harry’s already decided the space in front of the fireplace is best, so that Draco finds him as soon as he exits the floo. “Here is good I think,” Harry says, pointing at where he wants the mess to be and Dean pours a liberal amount onto the rug. He’s already assured Harry the paint is easily washed out so there isn’t any fear of ruining the rug. He murmurs the spell from before and the paint turns into a pool of blood. Harry slowly lowers himself to lie on his stomach in the middle of it and looks up at Dean.
. Aunt Dromeda had obviously held more weight in Kreacher’s eyes, although Draco couldn’t say that it offended him in the least. Truth be told, he found the elf’s slave-like adoration for him quite creepy.
“Well then, I suppose I’m going to be having a few words with her in a bit. Now get the fuck out of here before I hex your bits off and then turn them into balloon animals so you can watch them float away.”
Draco looks as apologetic as Harry’s ever seen him and he gives a sheepish one-shouldered shrug. “It’s a simple enough Doppleganger Charm, and I knew Sev well enough to produce a reasonable likeness. I didn’t expect you to react so… explosively,” he adds somewhat defensively and Harry gives him a narrowed look.
“Just having a bit of sport with him, is all,” George said with a careless shrug. “You don’t mind, right, Malfoy?” He put an arm around him and Draco fought the urge to push him off. He had to be polite.
True to her word, Ginny made sure Draco visited as soon as he could – which happened to be the very next day. They spent nearly the whole visit in the sky and Draco could practically feel himself shaking off the rust of too many months with little exercise. Afterwards, they’d lounged out in the garden, eating the warm cream buns Molly brought out to them. Draco had never felt so contented as then, lazing about in the sun-warmed grass without a care in the world.
“It’s going to be pretty lonely without you around,” Potter continued softly. Draco’s hand faltered, almost dropping a pie onto the floor. He kept his face carefully averted from Potter even as he spoke up, voice hesitant.
Draco hesitantly placed the end of the balloon in his mouth and his face scrunched up in disgust. The balloon had an utterly
Draco let himself be held, allowing the soothing scent of his mother to wash over him. Eventually he gently pushed her away and offered her a tentative smile.
Draco could only gape as the boy was engulfed in a hearty hug by Potter. Just then the door opened again and Potter’s brood came trooping out, James holding Lily’s hand on one side while Al held the other. Granger was right behind them.
“I do know my fair share when it comes to flying.” Draco said in irritation. “Think I got the seeker’s position by fluke?”
“Oh yeah!” Teddy started to excitedly tell James about his flying lessons at Hogwarts and the little boy listened agog.
Eventually they came to a clearing and Draco saw another little boy kneeling at the edge of what looked to be a fair sized hole. His little friend quickly made is way to the second boy and Draco knew at once that they were brothers. The other one looked to be a few years older but he had the exact same mop of black hair, though when Draco approached the two, he saw that this one had bright brown eyes instead of green.
sorry that you lost your best friend. I know any losses I had can’t add up to what you’ve gone through, but I do know how it feels to lose someone you care about. To feel incomplete and lost.”
Harry smiles indulgently at the haughty tone and makes his way to the fuse box. As he’d suspected, he finds that the trip has gone off, and reaches out to remedy the problem. Just as he is about to push it back up though, he hears a sound. Tensing, Harry swings around with his wand extended, but there doesn’t seem to be anything there.
Draco’s mouth fell open. In all his life, he’d never seen his mother cook. They had house elves for that, she’d say and truth be told, he sometimes wondered if she’d ever set foot in the Manor kitchen.
“I refuse to believe that you fell for that walking disaster with zero encouragement,” Pansy scoffed, dark eyes narrowing dangerously on Draco. “Are you honestly telling us that Potter never showed even the slightest interest?”
The woman smiled at Al and waved before turning back to Draco. You must be a friend of young Harry’s. It’s so nice to meet you, I’m Alice Spencer.”
“She’s relentless,” Pansy groaned. “Wants me married off and popping out a child before I’ve even reached twenty! I almost wish I was gay, maybe then she’d get off my back.”
George laughed again. “It was a joke.” he smirked as Draco flushed again. “Merlin, you’re so serious. Loosen up a bit old chap.”
Draco shrugged. “Your family is an exception, but most Pureblood families are just as vicious. Blaise’s letter was also smudged and I think his hand had been shaking when he wrote it. He expressed his condolences for my father and said that his mother didn’t really care about what we’d done in the War. For all her liberal ways, Ariana Zabini could be as loyal as they came. However, he said that he had to be there for Pans and if Parkinson Sr. found out that he still spoke with me, he’d ban Pansy from seeing Blaise too. There was nothing else to be done. After Pansy’s mum died, we’d both made a pact that whatever happened, we’d always protect her. I’m pretty sure they were in love with each other too.”
“We were just talking about your mother’s resourceful way of keeping you both from Azkaban,” Thin Lips explained in a genial tone. “Really, you must be so proud of her.”
“Alright, I’m… sorry.”  She didn’t look convinced though so he tried again. “Luna I really am sorry, but I’m back now aren’t I?”
He glanced at the shop windows idly as he passed, contemplating whether his mother would like some pastries for tea. He’d just made up his mind to visit the new patisserie that had opened beside Flourish and Blotts when two small forms bludgeoned into him with the force of a couple of bludgers.
Harry laughed. “Come on Draco, you know the holidays will practically fly by and then you’ll be begging them not to leave you.”
Draco’s jaw dropped as his wand was snatched out of his grip and flew into Potter’s waiting hands. He’d just been disarmed.
Harry looks at the spider and then at Draco’s frightened expression. He sets his jaw and gently pries Draco’s clutching hands off his shirt as he slowly steps down from the chair. Harry is done being cowed by a mere spider and he’s decided it’s time to take a stand.
Harry didn’t know if he wanted to hear Draco’s justification. He hardly knew how to breathe. This wasn’t fair. Draco wasn’t allowed to upend his world twice in two weeks. However, if there was an explanation…
As they heard the sound of the door unlatching, Harry squeezed Draco’s hand one last time, then made to let go, but Draco clutched him tighter.
His thumbs tapped against the bottle of Bordeaux he held as he waited, wondering if there was any etiquette he was forgetting. He shoved the note further down in his pocket, just in case.
“Wow, there’s a lot to unpack there,” Draco said, setting his glass down and leaning toward Harry, a gleam in his grey eyes. Harry’s throat inexplicably went dry. “First off, your date was with a bloke?”
Of course, despite this progress, England had fallen behind its practice regimen in the intervening week, and that meant their new coach held them over more often than not. Harry welcomed the distraction, and he liked Coach Shacklebolt; he was stern but kind, and he was still young enough to demonstrate new manoeuvres and strategies he wanted them to implement, his muscles rippling under dark brown skin.
As it turned out, Draco was an excellent listener. He laughed in the right places, chin tipped upward and the corners of his eyes crinkling with mirth. He raised a single impeccable, incredulous eyebrow when Harry told him about waking up on the outskirts of Bristol.
The key he’d thought he lost on his date with Zacharias Smith had been in his locker the whole bloody time.
missed his stop. Until today, he hadn’t had to double back on the Tube in at least six months, but such records must always be broken. Had Harry possessed half a brain, surely he should have cancelled the date then, but still no.
It was truly mortifying how those five sentences wreaked havoc on his heart rate whenever he read over them again. And they kept doing so, until he stuffed the note back into his pocket and knocked on Draco’s door Thursday night, at seven on the dot.
“Is this the boyfriend?” she asked Draco whilst leaning in closer to Harry, a small frown perched beneath her pert nose. She dragged his glasses down his nose with one finger, her eyes peering deeply into his for a long, heartstopping moment. Under her gaze, Harry felt the distinct sensation that his limbs had got jumbled, that his nose and his hands were much too big for his body.
Draco shook his head and smiled sheepishly, disarmingly. Harry’s stomach seemed to have wedged itself between his waterlogged shoes. “I got a bit distracted.”
The door creaked open, and a barefooted, apron-wearing Ron stood on the other side. “Harry!” he exclaimed, reaching over for a hug. “It’s great to see you, mate!” He turned to Draco and frowned slightly, his forehead wrinkling. “And this is?”
Practice that day was especially brutal, and Harry forgot about his boyfriend entirely as they ran drills to Coach Scrimgeour’s shouts and his teammates' grunts. During Harry’s water break, his eyes idly flicked to the place in the stands where he’d left Draco, but he must have moved to his preferred spot farther down the pitch, since he was nowhere to be found.
“Woah, woah, woah.” These words burst from Cedric Diggory, a ridiculously attractive starting forward to Harry’s right. “That’s quite an accusation, McLaggen. Give Potter a chance to explain.”
The door swung open, revealing the only two people in the world who were both blonde and sharp enough to create someone like Draco Malfoy. They both had unsmiling mouths, but there was a familiar glint in Narcissa’s eyes.
“You can spend the night here, if you want,” Draco offered. “You’d have to sleep on the sofa, but it seems silly for you to pay that extra fee, when it’s only a few hours different.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, savouring the syllables on his tongue as he moved toward him. He pulled the wine bottle out of Draco’s slack hands and intertwined them with his own. “Draco,” he whispered, one last time.
“You’ll never guess what I found,” Harry called out by way of greeting, waving the key in the air. He tossed it over, and Draco caught it nimbly, one-handed.
“Glad one of us did,” Harry said as he stepped onto the pavement. The Volkswagen was pulling away when he remembered his football bag was still in the boot.
“Thanks for this morning,” Harry said as they climbed up the three flights of stairs to their floor.
After he had made himself as presentable as possible, he heeded Draco’s advice, finally pulling that abandoned umbrella out of the corner of his locker. He shook it out, checking for stagnant water, then heard an unmistakable clink. Puzzled, he stared down at the umbrella in his hands, but a glint from the tiled floor just beyond caught his eye. He peered closer, then laughed aloud.
By the time he arrived at Dalston Junction, it had started to rain again, and he wanted to kick himself for leaving his umbrella at work the day before. Drops of water sluiced the grit from the pavement and pushed pedestrians into the shops they passed. Their interiors hummed with a golden warmth, contrasting with the grey pattering of rain outside.
“Still or sparkling?” Draco continued, loping toward the kitchen with an unreasonable amount of grace, given the hour.
“No, I think this is it,” Draco said, carrying two plates of salad to the table, a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette tucked under his arm. “Thanks for getting the wine.” He eyed the table, then nodded, satisfied, and motioned for Harry to sit.
He came home late that night, arms straining to carry a football bag, an abstract painting of a fruit bowl, and a potted pansy. He hadn’t had the heart to tell Neville whom the flower reminded him of.
, or if this really was only occurring to him now. He had just admitted to living in a manor, after all. He probably never had even worried about money.
Harry’s mobile lit up on the arm of the sofa, Apple’s logo blazing up at the ceiling, but Draco didn’t comment on it, so Harry decided to ignore it as well. He began his story, and he couldn’t help but think that this was rather a nice ending to the shittiest night in history.
“It felt like a dream the whole way through, not because you were Harry Potter, but because you were
Draco inhaled, eyes shut, and he rested his head in his hands. Harry could feel the anxiety rolling off him in waves. “One and a half years ago, I was promoted from covering Manchester United to the English national team. I didn’t want to be a sports journalist—I’ve always preferred politics—but Father thought sports would be a better match, because the public still cares about it, and it wouldn’t interfere with his political career. So four months ago, I was thrilled when a whistleblower informed me of possible corruption on the national football team.” He swallowed. “Sorry, could I have some water?”
until now. It’s added a whole new dimension to my art. Neville just ordered a shipment, so we’ll be stocking it soon.”
“Of course I want that,” Harry murmured, sitting down next to Draco on the bed. He found his hand amidst the heaped blankets and squeezed it before bending down to tie his shoelaces. “Just not at the cost of your job. Anyway, I can make us breakfast if you’re ready by seven.”
“Draco.” Harry’s voice was quiet, and Draco finally looked at him, eyes grey and glistening, before he trained his gaze back on the floor.
Shortly after, Luna and Neville announced that it was time for them to go, and Harry realised with a start how late it had got. Somewhere along the way, Draco and Ron had disappeared, leaving only one of Rose’s scribbles and a fountain pen behind—Luna’s thin green paintbrush was nowhere in sight, and more importantly, neither was Draco.
He hummed to himself as he showered and cleaned, moving his spare cleats from the countertop to a shelf in his closet, tossing his old takeaway containers into the dustbin under the sink, and wiping down the multitude of flat surfaces he’d been ignoring for the last few weeks. He smiled as he surveyed the living area. It still didn’t look nearly as polished as Draco’s flat next door—Harry’s squat sofa was a ratty brown thing he’d purchased at a charity shop right after he’d graduated from uni, and somewhere along the way, it had become a rite of passage to sign your name onto the side in Sharpie when Harry wasn’t looking. His coffee table had a splash of white paint on a leg from when Luna had decided to give his last flat an “ethereal” look, and a chipped corner from when Ron accidentally had rammed it into the wall of the stairwell whilst Harry was moving in, and a burn mark seared onto the side from when Fred and George had set off fireworks
“In your dreams,” he muttered as he rifled through his bag for his keys. They weren’t in their normal side pocket. Harry frowned, then kept searching, more and more frantically. He double-checked his jean pockets, then triple-checked them. He completely emptied his bag, shaking out each rumpled jersey and sweat-stained pair of shorts.
When Harry got home that afternoon, a box of Luna’s tea and one of Neville’s succulents in tow, the sun’s rays were slanting across the sky, as sudden as the morning’s showers of rain. The package he’d left on Draco’s doorstep was gone, he was gratified to see. Harry hummed “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me” as he unlocked the door to his flat, relishing the smooth entry of the key into the lock and the soft click it made as he turned it. He would never take it for granted again, he vowed.
Harry glanced back down at his mobile, praying to anyone who might be listening that it would be charged enough for him to turn it on and leave the worst night of his life behind, but the battery remained stubbornly dead.
It was only seven thirty the next morning, but it was already shaping up to be a shite day. Harry had forgotten to set his alarm and didn’t wake up until seven fifteen, almost two hours late. When he’d seen ambient light entering through the cracks between his blinds as he awoke, the jolt in his gut had immediately told him something was wrong. Fifteen minutes later, he was sprinting toward Liverpool Street Station, his football bag banging against his thigh with every step. Grey clouds skulked low in the sky, threatening an imminent storm. He blew past the daily newspaper sellers and a middle-aged man holding out a marker and t-shirt for an autograph, then tumbled down the steps of the escalator, barely entering the train car before the doors hissed shut behind him. As soon as it began moving, he dropped his duffel between his feet and collapsed against a pole, taking what felt like his first breath of the morning.
Harry slipped the thank-you and a twenty-pound note into the paper bag, folded the top back down, and knocked on his neighbour’s door, holding the warm bundle in one hand. When Draco didn’t open, he set it down on his doormat and headed out. He still needed to complain to Luna and to tell Ron and Hermione about everything that had happened last night, and he didn’t want to wait a moment longer.
Draco’s restroom was as meticulously clean and clutter-free as the living room had been, his bath mat the same dark velvety grey as the sofa. Harry wondered briefly if it was strange for him to notice such a thing, then resumed making himself presentable-ish with renewed vigour.
“If you tell them, I swear I’ll end you,” Harry said out of the corner of his mouth, then softened his words with a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
Harry shrugged. He didn’t know why he’d brought this up, but he felt suddenly exposed, his darkest memories floating in the air between them. “Thanks,” he finally got out. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, what brought you to London?”
of them liked her music. And he thought about how home had begun to feel like it was supposed to for the first time since the car accident that had stolen his parents. The declaration that he had been in love before, but it had never felt like this, like it was going to keep flowing into perpetuity, as comfortable as a daily stroll along the Thames, was on the tip of his tongue, before he remembered who sat before him. But Pansy seemed to understand what he wasn’t saying, and she arched one eyebrow as she nodded, satisfied, then stubbed her cigarette out on the edge of the glass ashtray in front of her.
, the football player who had survived a near-fatal car accident as a teenager, only to rise to sports stardom as soon as he had graduated uni. Sports journalists christened him Britain’s
“This can get a bit aggressive,” Harry murmured to Draco. “You don’t have to play. I’m sure Hermione wouldn’t mind the company.”
When they reached the training grounds, Draco signed for his visitor’s badge, then followed Harry into the stands. Harry gestured to the front row of seats behind one of the goals. “You should be able to see everything all right from here,” he said, leaning in to give Draco a quick kiss.
Draco was waiting for him outside the stadium, leaning against the side of his car with the projected sophistication of someone in a sports car advert. The sight of him still sent Harry’s heart stuttering. Despite the grey sky and the rain cascading around him, it was bright outside, the sun’s glow visible behind the layered clouds.
come back to Britain to personally throttle you.” She smiled sweetly, as if she hadn’t just made a threat on Harry’s life. “Understood?”
Harry laughed. “No offence, but I hardly think you could handle a run right now, and I need to get started.”
“Oh. Of course,” Zacharias said, frowning. “I could still give you a ride, if you’d like. Might be faster than the Tube, and that way you won’t risk making anyone else sick.”
Zacharias did so, grumbling about how some people just didn’t appreciate the finer things in life. However, he quickly returned to his bragging from dinner, as if four hours hadn’t come and gone since the meal had started. The car ride passed all too slowly, with Zacharias nattering on about his studies and Harry feeling the pressure at his temples that meant a headache was coming. He was ready for the shittiest night in history to finally be over.
Zacharias waved his concerns away, and that was when things started to go downhill. Somehow, he managed to dominate the conversation with comments on his studies of Biblical Greek at Oxford whilst also gawking at Harry’s lightning-bolt scar and apparent fame. Harry only received a reprieve in the brief pauses his date took to wolf down his spaghetti bolognese, and he unsuccessfully tried to resist the urge to check the clock behind him for the next ninety-one minutes.
Draco brightened at this. “I learnt from my mother. She’s half French, and so my grandmere, who was always quite indignant about the state of food in this country, made sure to teach her how to cook properly, and Mother passed it down. It’s a family tradition, just like the ridiculous constellation names.”
Their faces were only a few inches from each other, and they stared at one another for a heartstopping moment. Harry had to remind himself that despite everything that had happened, this was real, and he could feel the weight of that in his hands as he gently cupped Draco’s jaw. Harry watched as his eyes fluttered closed, then leant in. Their kiss was tentative at first, a question neither of them felt confident enough to answer, but it probed deeper, grew more and more tender as they held each other close. Harry’s heart stirred in his chest, and their eyes blinked open. Draco smiled at him again, pulled him even closer, and the answer to that question was suddenly, achingly clear.
Whilst Ron chatted with Luna and Neville at the front door, Draco slid one of his pieces across the chessboard.
Harry shuffled off the train when it reached his stop, but walked straight past the building that contained his—and Draco’s—flats and flagged down the bus to Dulwich Village instead. The wind had picked up, blowing the stench of the city’s refuse up from the river, and the morning’s promised rain finally began, a lazy drizzle just heavy enough to dampen Harry’s shirt and ruin his hair, or at least make it worse than usual. He clambered aboard, then sagged into the first available seat, trying not to consider what would happen next. The jostling of the bus made it easier not to think about anything, and Harry stared unblinkingly out the window, the buildings he passed obscured by the drumming rain that bounced from the asphalt and splattered the smudged glass. As he approached Ron and Hermione’s street, the rain flung itself from the sky with more vigour than ever, and Harry cursed himself for forgetting his umbrella once again—it had been mouldering uselessly in his locker since the night he had gone on that horrid date with Zacharias and then met Draco, almost two months ago. The newspaper he still carried crumpled in his fist, and he stalked off the bus into the waiting downpour, his heart heavy and aching.
“What’d I miss?” he asked, his presence evaporating the tension that had settled between Harry and Pansy.
. Because you care so fiercely about those you love, and you aren’t afraid to be vulnerable, and you’re unbelievably cheeky, and—”
Harry sighed, tilting his head against the back of the sofa and letting his gaze rest on the silver light fixtures shining down on the pair of them. When he looked back at his neighbour, a gold aura seemed to frame his face. “The short version is that I was set up on the world’s worst date, and he sort of kidnapped me. My best guess is that my keys got left in his car.”
Draco emerged then, carrying an iPhone charger, an overfilled file folder, and another pen. He tossed the charger over to Harry, then settled into the chair opposite his sofa, opening the folder and uncapping the pen with his teeth.
have pressured you to come out to your parents, and it would have been… courteous of you to tell me you covered my bloody team—”
He smiled, but it was a sad smile. He missed living with his friends; over the course of the past year or two, they’d split off and all started to move away. They were all still in Greater London, but it wasn’t the same. Ron and Hermione couldn’t just pop over and chat because they’d heard his footsteps creaking in the flat above. Now they lived a thirty-minute bus ride away, and since they had a child,
“I liked them too,” Draco admitted. “You all seem really close. And I think the fact that I voluntarily joined you with no warning whatsoever speaks to my feelings concerning this. Us. You.” He glanced down at their hands, then back at the empty bus behind them.
“I don’t follow it, precisely, but I know a thing or two,” Draco explained, drizzling vinaigrette over his salad. “Anyway, we don’t have to talk about the game. I just thought that if you wanted to go through the play-by-play, since winning against another national team is no small feat, I was a willing audience. That’s all.”
“Posh, aren’t you?” his neighbour teased as he hurried into the back of the flat. Harry couldn’t help but stare as he retreated; Draco’s trackies were too big for him, the waistband rolled several times over, and that pen still stuck out behind his ear. His clothing choices were made extra puzzling by the furnishings of the place: chic and modern and minimalistic, like Harry’s neighbour lived in a catalogue instead of a home. This flat couldn’t have contrasted more with Harry’s, considering they had identical floor plans. He was pretty sure there were no fewer than three takeaway containers on his own coffee table, and he had an abandoned pair of shoes in every room, including the kitchen. Oh dear, he hadn’t left a pair of cleats on the counter
“Of course!” Harry cut her off before her voice could rise any higher. She already sounded as if she were seconds away from bursting into tears, and he’d never known how to respond when someone cried. He tugged Draco’s hand, pulling him to a stop, and they pressed themselves against the side of the railing over the Thames, avoiding a crowd of tourists ambling past. “We got a late start, but we’ll be there in about twenty minutes. Feel free to start without us. We’ll catch up.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry could see the corners of his smile as he stared down at his plate. “What about you? How was your game?”
“Oh, Harry. I’m so sorry,” Draco breathed. His eyes were as big and grey as a stormcloud right before it released rain. He reached over to where Harry’s fingers were clenching the railing, and gave his hand a brief squeeze.
“It’s just got some sweaty jerseys and cleats and such. Nothing too exciting,” he said, but that didn’t stop the other man from pawing through it before slinging it inside the car, zip still half-open.
Nobody answered. He knocked again, shifting his weight from foot to foot. Still no one came. Harry sighed.
“Marvin, that purple grass is simply delightful!” Luna’s voice rang over the chatter in the crowded studio in the back. “One should never limit themselves to what they see with their eyes.” Marvin, who couldn't have been more than ten years old, beamed back at his teacher. A couple minutes later, Luna clapped her hands together, dismissed her class, then skipped over to where Harry was leaning against a shelf. His eyes caught on the red ladybugs dancing across her apron, and then on the matching red paintbrush tucked behind her ear. He couldn’t help but remember the night before, an image of Draco and his pen flashing before his mind’s eye before he turned back to the matter at hand.
They all stood there for another moment, Draco flushing spectacularly, Pansy smiling deviously, and Harry glancing back and forth between the two of them.
“I’m so glad you’re here,” she said in her pleasant but businesslike manner. “I really thought you weren’t going to come. Forty minutes, Harry.”
Draco sighed again. “You’re right, I did know. It just seemed personal enough that I wanted to learn about it directly from you. It didn’t seem fair for me to know without your consent. I realise that it’s a painful topic, so maybe that wasn’t the right call, but that was my thought process at the time.”
They’d all crowded into a sandwich shop a few days after Scrimgeour’s Scandal, as the press had dubbed it, startling the bored-looking waitstaff, who hurriedly offered up menus and declared that dessert was on the house. As conversation turned toward the inevitable, Harry aired his confession. It had been weighing on him more and more as he’d started to properly know his teammates for the first time, and he couldn’t bear to hide it from them any longer.
“So, tell me how you came to find yourself locked out of your flat at this time of night,” Draco said, a hint of a smile poking at the corner of his mouth.
When he returned to his flat, drenched with sweat and the damp morning air, he half-expected to encounter Draco asleep again in his bed, but instead he found the table set for two and the curtains opened in the front room, letting in the daybreak’s first hints of sunlight. His pillows had been fluffed, the sheets pulled tight across the mattress, and the corner of his duvet was folded back just so. No wonder Draco’s flat always looked like a catalogue, he thought, then set off to shower and prepare breakfast.
“You hadn’t told me you played chess,” Harry said, eyes tracing over all of the pieces on the board.
Harry’s relief at the early release vanished as he trudged to the train station, the clouds overhead scuttling even lower than they had a couple hours earlier, pressing down on the tops of the buildings. The air felt hot and oppressive, and it curdled in Harry’s lungs with every inhalation. His thoughts had raced too quickly during his training for him to track them, let alone the ball at play, but now they crystallised into painful clarity: Draco had used him.
“Coming!” Ron called. “Harry, how’s it—“ he stopped short as he came into view, eyeing Harry’s sodden frame and the utter dejection he was doing a shite job of hiding. “What happened?”
“I should have done,” Harry muttered. “I’m too trusting. Did I tell you I knew he was a journalist? Because he told me. He told me the night we met, and I still went and—”
“It’s nice to meet you,” Draco said in a measured tone, holding a hand out for Ron to shake. “So sorry we’re late—this one here got a little carried away when we were buying your presents.”
In the meantime, the team had begun to spend more time together outside of their usual training bloc, perhaps because their abbreviated practices left them with more free time, or perhaps because their world had been upended the previous week and they all understood what the others were going through better than anyone else could.
Besides the facial expression and the omnipresent pen behind his ear, he couldn’t have looked more different from the man Harry had met two nights prior. This Draco’s hair was slicked back, and he wore a sage green button-up, well-fitting trousers, and shiny leather oxfords. Harry was having a hard time remembering how to swallow.
Draco tensed, so subtly Harry might have missed it were they not holding hands, then shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “I don’t know. Most of them are back in France.”
“What the hell is that even supposed to mean?” McLaggen narrowed his eyes. “Is this your fault? You get into a fight with your girlfriend and she ruins our entire team?”
“Or you could take me with you,” Draco suggested, finally sitting up, hands rubbing his eyes as he tried to open them.
The envelope was made of creamy, thick paper, and his name was written across its back in perfect cursive. Harry tore it open and pulled out the note inside.
“It’s Hermione,” Harry said, an apology evident in his tone. “Sorry, I’m sure this will be quick.” He accepted the call. “Hey, ‘Mione?”
“If I’m not mistaken, I believe you owe me a couple answers now,” Harry said, but he was smiling, and his foot knocked against Draco’s under the table again.
“I have an iPhone too, so if I could borrow your cable, that would be fantastic,” Harry said, wearily sinking onto the couch. The water from his clothes seeped into the fabric, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
Draco coughed, a watercolour blush rising onto his cheeks, which Pansy ignored as she turned back to Harry.
The moustached man had the good grace to chuckle and shake his head. “I’m afraid not, son,” he said. “I’m not expecting anybody. And I’m married.”
Harry wasn’t so unbearably famous that he got harassed on the streets every time he went out or got accosted every time he boarded the Tube. It helped that he wore glasses, he privately thought. No one expected England’s star footballer to wear glasses off the pitch, but contacts made his eyes itch when he wore them for more than a couple hours at a time. Nonetheless, when people met and recognised him, they always wanted something from him. Everyone seemed to think he existed solely to satisfy their curiosity and provide mementoes. He didn’t mind signing autographs or chatting briefly about what it was like to make your career in sports, but he hated it when people decided he owed them such favours because he was famous, when they’d follow him down three blocks even after he’d given them what they said they wanted. Besides his friends from uni, those who had decided he was worth their time before he signed with the Arsenals and then the national team, no one had ever been kind to him because he was Harry. It was always because he was bloody Harry Potter.
Potter made an odd noise and it almost sounded as if he was stifling a laugh, but when Draco looked at him, his face was completely serious.
dramatic.” Draco commented to Lily as he lifted her out of the tub and kept her on the bathroom rug. He gently towelled her off with a dry towel and then wrapped it snugly around her. “Shall I get her into her nightclothes then?” he asked, picking her up.
“I really shouldn’t forgive you just yet… but I suppose I will. After all, I’m hoping some bufflepops will visit me tonight and holding onto negative thoughts are sure to drive them away.”
Draco nodded as he gingerly sat down on the settee. To his surprise, Potter took a seat at the other end and leant back comfortably, completely at ease with the situation.
“Yeah, everyone’s coming.” James put in. “Teddy too, cause he’s part of the family. We’re gonna have an egg hunt and play games and eat lots of chocolate.”
“…Greg and Vince would be trying to fish with no success, whilst simultaneously eating all the crackers they’d brought as bait…” Blaise put in.
“Well, aren’t you a charmer,” Ginny simpered and gave him an exaggerated wink. “You better not have fallen for me, pretty boy, for I am regrettably a taken woman.”
Harry rotates his arm a little and sure, it still feels tender but it’s likely just a bruise so he shakes his head. “I think you’ve scared at least fifty years off my life though,” he tells Draco seriously, feeling well enough now to be angry. “Honestly, what is
Potter looked sheepish. “I know it wasn’t very fair, but I was too eager to join in catching the remaining Death Eaters to care.”
Draco drew back slowly, bringing a hand to cover his mouth. He didn’t know why but he was happy. So happy. He’d never known that a single word could make him feel like he’d been given the world. Could make him feel worthwhile and wanted and
known that this wasn’t going to last forever. He’d also known that he couldn’t go back to spending his days wandering about the Manor – not after Ginny and Potter had taught him to live again.
“Cheeky bint,” Draco muttered, deftly snatching up her drink and ignoring her indignant cry as he tossed it back in one go.
“Why did you leave in the first place?” Potter’s next question was, and Draco considered how best to answer.
Teddy beamed. “You knew my mum too.” he said surprisingly. “Gran says you were cousins which makes us cousins too! I’ve never had a cousin before.”
Dean rolls his eyes but dips his brush into some red paint and begins to apply it with confident strokes onto Harry’s back. Harry watches as best he can by craning his head back, and at first all it looks like are random red lines that look nothing like Sectumsempra wounds at all. He’s about to complain when Dean sets his brush down and picks up his wand. He murmurs something Harry can’t quite catch as he waves his wand over each red line, and right before Harry’s eyes he sees the paint morph into bloody wounds, slicing up his back in a gruesome way.
“Plus, he won’t shut up about you,” Weasley added, silent until now. “It’s like sixth year all over again.”
Just then a large train came to a stop in front of them and Potter ushered Draco and the children through before boarding it himself. Unlike in the Hogwarts express, there were no compartments or corridors, instead there were just seats lining the walls. James, Albus and Teddy scrambled into a couple of seats on one side while Potter moved to the other side.
his ankle,” Potter barked out orders with calm efficiency, wand already in hand. He didn’t ask permission, unmannered boor that he was, and Draco bit his lip as his injured ankle set itself with the sickening sound of bones aligning. Potter flicked his wand a few more times in Draco’s general direction, muttering under his breath, and Draco sucked in a startled breath as some of his soreness left him; his head for one, felt
The situation – which was already surreal to begin with – got even more surreal as Ginny Weasley instantly placed the squirming girl in his arms, not hesitating even for a second.
She must have sensed that he was in no mood for such a talk and quickly changed the subject. “How are Pansy and Blaise doing then? I assume she is still staying at his family estate.”
Ginny ignored him in favour of regarding Draco intently. “He didn’t make you eat anything, right? Smell something? Touch something? Repeat something?”
Thin Lips looked practically gleeful as he took in Draco’s approach. “If it isn’t young Malfoy! Come to join the merry party?”
. The dim light is eerie but better than complete darkness, and now he can see his boyfriend’s pale face inches away from his own.
Draco shuddered at the thought. “My lips are sealed. And anyways, you can always try to make up for it this year.”
“Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry says, knowing all the while that words can only do so much. “It was supposed to be a harmless trick; just to get back at you for all the ones you pulled on me. I didn’t mean to scare you so badly.”
Draco chuckled. He had enough scary stories to write a book, but most of them were certainly not appropriate for the children. The things he’d seen could give them nightmares for years.
Turning back to the door without another word, Draco raised the wand and repeated the movements that his mother had taught him a few hours ago, murmuring the incantations under his breath. When he felt a small snap at the back of his mind, he stopped and turned to Potter.
“With the library over, you’ll be finished helping me,” Potter continued, oblivious to Draco’s sudden emotional turmoil. “You won’t have to spend your days here anymore.”
“Now that he’s gone…” She turned back to Draco. “Darling, you’ve nothing to worry about. Weaslette–”
“Draco, is something actually wrong?” Pansy reached out to place a hand on his cheek through the flames.
To say that Draco was worried about seeing Potter again was an understatement. He was willing to admit he was
Draco drew himself up and steeled himself, adopting an expression that would have done Lucius proud. “Is there any need for you to touch me?” he asked in a voice that he hardly recognized as his own. It was so cold.
“No Al, it’s perfectly safe. It’s Al’s first time taking the tube too.” he said to Draco. He lowered his voice so the Muggles nearby couldn’t hear. “We could have just
Once in the sitting room, he and Potter turned to each other helplessly. Without Teddy or the other children there to act as a buffer, what were they expected to do? They were Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy who until quite recently had hated each other’s guts. Well, Potter probably had anyways. Draco hadn’t really ‘hated’ Potter since maybe around sixth year when other things had taken priority over school boy rivalries.
The owl gave a hoot as if it agreed with his statement, but Draco thought that ‘majestic’ was a far cry from what it actually was. The thing was a ball of fluff, so small it could probably fit in the palm of Draco’s hand. He doubted it was even strong enough to carry a letter, let alone anything else.
His mother sat down at the edge of his bed, her face softening a bit as she took his hand. “Darling, I’m sorry. You’re right; I should have warned you that we had company.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the implications. He couldn’t really see Molly allowing Ginny to sleep over at Potter’s house.
him – I was scared because of what it would do to our friendship, not to mention Ginny. I really valued what I had with her. If it wasn’t for her, I’d still be moping around the Manor. I’d never have made the decision to complete my N.E.W.T.s or turn my life around.”
“Merlin’s balls, Lily! Do you have a death wish or something?” Draco fumed. “I mean I know having Potter as a father must be both a bother and an embarrassment, but surely it hasn’t led you to wanting to end your exceedingly short life.”
When they finally did address the past, Potter apologised for the scars that still marred Draco’s torso, green eyes sad and hands visibly shaking. In return, he’d accepted Draco’s own apologies with a nod and a gentle smile. They finally spoke about the War and the horrors they’d each seen; of how they both still had nightmares and couldn’t sleep unless their wands were securely under their pillows. Draco told him about life growing up with Lucius as a father, always expecting too much and appreciating too little; how even now, he still loved the man in some warped way whilst simultaneously hating him like he hated no one else. Potter reciprocated with tales of his childhood and Draco had listened, disgusted by his Muggle relatives and ashamed at himself for ever making fun of Potter for things that were a result of them.
“Harry, it’s so good to see you!” she said, reaching out for a hug. “I suppose you’re here to try the new tea I found? It does wonders for your hearing. Truly, I never realised how paint
“Would you like anything to drink?” Draco asked, standing up and stretching. He moved to put the pen in his hand behind his ear, but finding the space already occupied, he hurriedly set it back on top of the folder instead.
“Well, you haven’t answered my question either, and I asked it first.” Draco took another sip of wine, one sardonic eyebrow daring Harry to argue back.
“Smith sounds like a maniac,” Draco observed as Harry finished, squeezing the last of his lemon wedge’s juice into his cup of seltzer and licking his thumb. “That is quite a story. I don’t know that I’d believe it if you hadn’t shown up at my doorstep looking like…” He glanced Harry up and down meaningfully.
They were on their way back from the Tate Modern, their hands bumping each other as they walked, and Draco was explaining the political symbolism of a sculpture they’d admired, his voice growing more and more animated as he spoke. Harry was wondering just how bad it would be if he picked up Draco’s hand here in public when his iPhone started ringing, blaring out “A Cauldron of Hot, Strong Love” for all the world to hear. He had
required planning. Neville and Luna couldn’t just water Harry’s plants every morning when he was away for a football tournament or when he simply forgot, because they were always busy with their combined nursery/art studio. The only time Harry could catch up with them now was when he went under the pretence of buying a plant or a new painting. Maybe he’d stop by this afternoon, buy a succulent, and tell Luna about her horrible setup. But before he could do that, there was one more order of business to take care of: coffee.
Harry withdrew his hand. “Oh. Right. Sorry. This is a bit embarrassing, but I’ve managed to lock myself out, and my mobile is dead, so I was wondering if you had a charger I could borrow or anything? I’m so sorry to be a bother, it’s just been an awful night.”
“Here you go, sir,” the hostess said, and Harry gave her a tight smile before turning to his date. He had a stocky frame and a heart-shaped face, with honey blond hair and a fringe that drooped into his eyes. His powder blue shirt seemed to be freshly starched, and Harry winced as he remembered the wrinkled red flannel he had pulled out of his bag of football gear. It didn’t smell
Harry sat back, the wind knocked from his lungs; his football bag fell to the ground with a thump. A tide of emotion was rising through him and he hurriedly gulped it down, reminding himself to inhale, exhale. He pressed his face into his hands, trying to make the thoughts stop coming, or at least trying to make them wait their turn and enter his mind single-file. As it stood, images and ideas ripped through him, one after another after another, whirling past his outstretched fingers when he tried to focus on just one.
. Before he could second-guess himself, he tucked the message into the soil of the potted pansy, placed it on Draco’s doormat, and retreated into his flat, mind still spinning.
“You don’t know?” He hadn’t had to tell the story in years; it was always mentioned somewhere when the papers wrote about him, but he supposed Draco didn’t follow sports. “Right. My parents were driving home from a Halloween party when I was fifteen, and a drink driver hit us head-on. Mum and Dad died at the scene, but I got lucky. Just a few broken bones and this scar, here.” He pulled his fringe back to show the jagged scar that stretched from his hairline to the top of his cheekbone. “Sirius took me in once I was released from the hospital, and I’ve lived in London ever since.”
He waited, expectant. Harry was still trying to process the entirety of the confession, the ins and outs of all of it. He had no clue where to start, but he knew he needed to. Draco looked like he might spontaneously combust if another moment passed in silence
Nothing centred Harry like time with his friends. For a long time, he’d preferred their homes to his own, always dreading the moment he’d have to return to his drab flat. He still felt that way sometimes, if he was honest with himself. But he seemed to be the only one. Ginny had new friends in Westminster, now. Luna and Neville shared an eclectic flat above their equally eclectic shop in Dalston. Ron and Hermione had recently moved to their new place, a quaint house in Dulwich, after they’d announced that Hermione was pregnant with their second and they’d need more space for their family. Harry was excited for his best friends—he truly was—but he got the sense that their lives were moving on without him, and no matter how fast he ran, he couldn’t keep up.
The man in front of him ignored Harry’s proffered hand. Instead, he leant against the doorframe and coolly said, “Ah, yes, I have become well-acquainted with your abhorrent music taste. I’d ask what possessed a man such as yourself to purchase any album by Celestina Warbeck, but I think I’d rather not know. However, I will ask, if you don’t mind, why you decided to introduce yourself at half two?”
“Oh, this was nothing,” Draco assured him, but he couldn’t quite hide his pleasure at Harry’s words. “You can go ahead and eat. It won’t bite you, you know.” He stabbed a halved cherry tomato and popped it into his mouth, as if to demonstrate.
Ron beamed. “I like this one,” he told Harry, clapping Draco on the shoulder. “You should keep him around.”
“But then I started developing feelings for you. Alarmingly quickly, I might add. I’d never felt so conflicted. I don’t know that I ever would have asked you out if it weren’t for the case, but I… I really liked you the whole time. I think I fell in love with you, actually.” He bit his lip. Harry nearly forgot about the water glasses and the lemon sitting atop the counter as he sneaked his way back into the living room. They couldn’t have this conversation with him relegated to the kitchen.
He ducked back into his flat, setting the box of tea and his pen on the coffee table, and Harry kicked at his trainers self-consciously as he waited. He didn’t know what he was doing. Well, he knew he was spontaneously buying treats for and proposing walks with his attractive neighbour who dated men, but that didn’t exactly clarify matters.
confused. You two seemed to have something really special when you brought him over here. And he put up with all of us. That isn’t nothing.”
“Please.” They chewed silently, and after they finished, Draco washed the dishes whilst Harry frantically flung his football gear back into his bag—he didn’t know how it always got scattered around his flat over the course of the weekend, but it inevitably did, necessitating this weekly ritual.
Harry stopped by his flat and grabbed the box he’d left on the sofa, then knocked on the door across from his. He wasn’t expecting Draco to open it this early on a Sunday morning, but it still seemed more courteous to him than dropping the food off without warning. He’d just set today’s bundle on the doormat and was standing back up again when the door opened to reveal a smirking Draco.
There was a brief pause, just long enough for Harry to wonder what he was doing, and then the door opened. A man around Harry’s age stood on the other side, a man with light blond hair, sharp features, and a tall, thin frame. His collarbone peeked out from his worn t-shirt, which had slipped off one shoulder, and he had a pen tucked behind his ear.
Thankfully, Draco returned before they had to make any banal attempts at conversation, squeezing past Harry once again and placing his hand back on his knee, as if he’d never left.
Harry said his thanks and made his way over, picking past a glass coffee table covered in canvases, a row of sunflowers nodding toward a lamp, and a cluster of snow pea plants beginning to bud. Despite the clutter, there was an airiness and a joy to the shop; it was a place that made you feel at home.
“Pardon?” the man said, his newspaper rustling as he set it down, an oddly crisp sound against the chatter around them.
He meant to thank Draco for coming, to say something civil that would ease the tension inspissating the atmosphere, but instead he watched silently as Draco perched on the edge of the shabby sofa.
“We’re almost to Bristol!” Seeing the incredulity on Harry’s face, he rushed into an explanation. “You said you weren’t well, and the sea air always makes me feel better, and I wanted to spend more time with you.”
He scanned the front page, unable to comprehend what he saw there. He knew his teammates had to be concerned about the photo of Coach Scrimgeour in handcuffs, or perhaps the headline announcing all of his drug charges. But Harry’s eyes skipped straight past that, to the impossibility printed beneath the headline:
“Thanks for coming over,” Draco abruptly said, withdrawing his hand and snapping Harry out of the moment. He stood and began carting plates back over to the kitchen, and Harry had to stare down at the table, at his forlorn hand atop it, for a solid minute to register what had happened. When he did, he stood as suddenly as Draco had done and followed him into the kitchen, where he was putting the dishes and food away with the same adroit efficiency he had exhibited before the meal.
Harry leant a bit closer. He was conscious of Draco’s hand, only a few inches away from his own on the wooden table, and he could imagine heat sparking the space between their fingers. “So, you like cooking? How’d you learn?”
Draco’s head turned away as he gazed over the stands. “Isn’t the view better from over there?” His brow was furrowed as he gestured halfway across the pitch to the seats parallel to the center line, right below the press box. “That’s where I usually sit and—” He cut himself off, eyes widening.
The downpour drenched Harry as he stood there, trying to figure out what to do. It was too late to catch a train to Ron and Hermione’s, or to Luna and Neville’s, or to the flat that Ginny shared with her teammates. He supposed he could walk somewhere, but where to? All of his friends lived several kilometres away, and he didn’t think he could find his way by foot without a map.
? For the party we’ve been planning for a month? This was the only weekend that worked for everyone between when we finished unpacking and when the baby is due and—”
“I hope you don’t mind if I brought some things to garnish our breakfast,” he said by way of introduction, holding up a plump tomato and a couple sprigs of basil. “This smells quite good,” he added.
. If anyone could bring England back into the running for the World Cup, it was the team’s new attacking midfielder, Harry Potter.
“Sorry. I’ll see you after work. It won’t be that long.” Harry bumped around his closet in the dark, searching for his trainers.
Draco paused, his drink halfway to his mouth, and stared at Harry. He self-consciously wiped at his chin again.
“So I finished the article. I didn’t feel right sending it in, but I couldn’t ignore what I had found. That would destroy my journalistic integrity. I finally decided to email my boss and explain that I couldn’t continue the investigation because I’d got too close to the case. My plan was to request she send it on to a coworker, and I’d provide him with all the notes I’d collected in ways unconnected to you.”
Neville nodded toward the back of the shop as he packed peat moss around the roots of one of the flowers. “She should be finishing up a watercolour class soon. You can head over now, if you want. I’m sure she’ll be happy to see you.”
It was remarkable how seamlessly dating Draco fit into Harry’s life. After work, he’d pop over to his boyfriend’s flat, or Draco would come over to his. On Friday nights, instead of feeling sorry for himself over takeaway curry, he and Draco sought out new restaurants, and on Sundays, they worked their way down the list of museums Draco had yet to visit in London.
Harry turned away from the sink to look at Draco, whose hands were worrying their way through his platinum hair. “I see.”
“Touché,” he said, before launching into the requested recounting of Wednesday’s game. Draco followed along admirably, periodically asking for clarification on specific plays, and he didn’t have any trouble remembering the names of Harry’s teammates nor the positions they played. They’d moved on to dessert by the time he finished, a tarte tatin that layered a smooth, buttery flavour over caramelised apples, warming him from the inside out.
” Harry sprinted after the car and pounded on the back window. Zacharias turned toward the sound and lowered the passenger window.
“So I knew I had a conflict of interests, as it were, which I was studiously ignoring. I thought maybe the tipoff was a dead end after all, and things could continue as they had been. But when I accompanied you to practice, I found the missing link that I needed to report to the police and publish the evidence. The problem was, I didn’t want to anymore, because I didn’t want to hurt you. I swear I didn’t. I had no idea what to do.
“Sorry to bother you,” Harry stammered. “I… err… moved into the flat across from yours about six months back, and I don’t believe we’ve met.” He stuck his hand out for the other man to shake and immediately regretted it, remembering how poorly his last handshake had gone.
“Shall we head on, then?” Draco asked, breaking the group’s silence. “Our dinner reservation is in fifty-five minutes, in Islington. We don’t want to be late.”
The best coffee shop in the world was three blocks away from Harry’s flat, in the dead opposite direction of the Tesco. He usually only let himself pay for it once a week, because he knew he wouldn’t have a football salary his whole life and he had student loans to finish paying, but today, he deserved a trip to Bean Thinking of You.
“Err, no.” Harry was suddenly profoundly aware of how long it had been since he’d stopped by the shop, how long since he had seen Luna in person. “I actually just wanted to catch up. I went on that date with Zacharias last night.”
“Nice to meet you too,” Harry finally said, sliding into the seat across from Zacharias, taking a moment to mourn his usual comfortable corner booth. “Sorry I’m late. Practice went over, and I had a hell of a time getting here.”
The door opened, a chubby-cheeked toddler half-hidden in its shadow. Rose looked Harry up and down, then turned to the empty hall behind her and shouted, “Dad! Uncle Harry is here!”
“Well, I finally got to tell my neighbour off about his horrible music, and I learnt about a great coffee shop.” He drained his cup, as if to emphasise the statement, then turned to Harry with a wicked grin. “Am I forgetting anything?”
It was approaching two am when they turned the corner and Harry saw the building that contained his flat. Only one light was still on, casting an orange glow over a third storey balcony. As soon as Zacharias pulled to the kerb, Harry sprang out of the car.
He was met with the same surprise the following four mornings, until he couldn’t take it anymore. A few pastries hardly made up for what Draco had done, and Harry still wasn’t sure if he forgave him or not, but he wanted to hear what Draco had to say.
One of his favourite post-game rituals was to hole up in his hotel room and watch the match, taking notes on what plays had worked and where he could improve. But his attention kept wandering to the note he had found on his door when he’d set off for St Pancras early Monday morning.
Once they’d settled into the car, Draco made a visible effort to steer the conversation not just to English, but to topics to which Harry could contribute. They stumbled through a few subjects, until they finally landed on something easy: traffic on the M4. It was horrendous that day, even by London’s standards, and they all readily complained about it, bemoaning the reservation that ticked closer and closer as time continued its unrelenting march forward.
Without a coach and with the tension building between members of the team, practice didn’t get too far. Harry hadn’t been able to focus at all, missing the ball entirely in several basic drills, and his teammates didn’t seem to be faring much better. The assistant coach finally dismissed everyone less than an hour after they had begun, and they all tramped back to the locker rooms, silent.
, but she had to come to Britain for business often enough, and when she did, they tried to meet up, at least once. Picking her up at the airport was a good way to sneak in an extra hour together, despite her busy schedule.
“Please, I’m almost done. I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting since then, and I understand if you don’t forgive me or want me back, but the last few months have been one of the happiest times of my life. Maybe
“Hey, everyone,” Harry said, glancing over the table set up in the back garden. At the far end sat Luna, Neville, and Ginny, who had evidently just said something hilarious, because everyone’s heads were thrown back in laughter, whilst she looked on, smug. Rose’s eyes peeked over the top of the table between Ginny and Hermione, and Harry couldn’t help the warmth bubbling inside him at the sight of his friends, all together, like in the old days. Sure, Fred and George weren’t here—their toy shop on Oxford Street kept them too busy to join, most of the time, and they’d always had other friends anyway—but the rest of his uni family was there, at the house, and so was his beautiful, brilliant boyfriend.
, when commuters acted as if those around them were roadblocks instead of other living, breathing humans.
happiest. I want to give this a fair shot, if you do too. But regardless of what you decide, I think I’m ready to come out to my parents. It’s time I live for myself, instead of for my father. And if he can’t accept it, I’ve learnt a lot about found family from you, and I have some good friends. I think I’ll be all right. Also, for what it’s worth, after I turned in that article, my supervisor agreed that I was more suited to political work than sports, so I’ve transferred departments. I can promise you nothing like this will ever happen again.” He sat back, his expression apprehensive.
“Anyway, it’s nice to meet you,” Pansy continued, kissing Harry’s cheeks in turn. His attention was still trained on Draco, who was studiously and uncharacteristically avoiding eye contact. “I’m Pansy.”
“I’m a man of many talents.” His smirk grew into that same unrestrained grin from their first date, the one Harry was starting to recognise as a sign that Draco was feeling exhilarated enough to no longer care what he looked like, and Harry was absolutely weak for it.
“Hi!” Draco said brightly as he opened the door. The first thought Harry had was that he looked radiant when he smiled. The second thought was that, for once, Draco didn’t have a pen behind his ear.
“If you could open the wine, that would be wonderful.” Draco slid a bottle opener across the counter to Harry, then pulled two stem glasses down from a cabinet. Harry poured each of them a generous cup, then stood, waiting, as Draco bustled around the kitchen, making the meal’s final preparations.
“But… what… your boyfriend?” Ron’s eyes were now as round as two blue moons, taking up half his face.
Harry turned a final corner, head down to brace against the gloomy weather. He reflexively shivered as he stepped into The Painted Plant, the rich scents of pigment and earth drifting into his lungs. He flicked his wet hair out of his eyes, wiped his glasses off on a dry patch on his t-shirt, then made his way over to where Neville stood behind a counter. The shop was cluttered but in a cosy way, hand-painted flowerpots interspersed with Luna’s paintings. Together, they filled most of the flat surfaces in the room.
“I just don’t know which fork to use,” Harry admitted, smiling sheepishly. He expected Draco to reply with some biting retort, but he just pointed to the outermost one and explained that you moved your way inward as the meal progressed. Their feet bumped one another under the table.
“That’s not nearly as exciting,” Draco said, stretching languidly against the back of the armchair, his spine arching. “I’m a journalist for the
Harry nearly turned around when he saw the cheery yellow flowers blossoming in Ron and Hermione’s front garden. He didn’t want to bother his friends with his problems when they had plenty of their own concerns to deal with—Hermione’s baby was due in less than a month, and Harry suddenly couldn’t even remember if Ron was working from home today or not. This had been a stupid idea, although it wasn’t quite as stupid as falling in love with his neighbour had been. He felt like he might sick up; a wave of dizziness made him stumble against the front stoop as the realisation of what had happened hit him once again, full-force.
“Ah, yes. She practised that all the way through uni,” Draco said, ignoring the daggers being sent his way by Pansy’s indignant glare.
“Remarkable,” she finally said, stepping away. “Draco, you did not do his eyes justice in your letters.”
Draco took a deep breath, his eyes trained on his lap, and Harry turned to face him, his heart in his throat. “My best friend is flying in from Paris next week, and if you’d like to meet her, I know she’d be happy to meet you,” he finally said.
. Of course it was dead. That meant he couldn’t call a locksmith either. He had no way to get into his flat and he had no way to contact someone who could help.
Draco allowed himself to pretend there was sadness in Potter's eyes. Don't be ridiculous, he thought to himself.
With the cold came the ghosts. This time there was more of them than Harry remembered. All of them were dressed in a variation of the same clothing - a hemp sleeping shirt, with dried stains on it. The faces of the ghosts were barely discernible, however, a large hole, seemingly drilled into each of their skulls, looked sharper, as if the apparitions focused their conscience on making it more visible. Harry swore he would find out what had happened to them.
Harry watched Draco enter the break room out of the corner of his eye. He seemed even paler than usual, his skin looked sallow and there were deep purple circles under his eyes. Harry wanted to scold him for coming back to work so early, wanted to throw him across his shoulder, carry him to his bed, tuck him in and keep him there until Draco was better. He did none of that.
Malfoy was always early and today was no exception. He was sitting behind his desk as usual, tapping the fluffy end of his quill against his lips as he considered the report in front of him.
The staircase unfolded with a loud creaking sound that echoed through the otherwise silent house. A dog barked outside. Harry coughed as a layer of dust fell down through the unused opening. He steeled himself and placed one foot on the first stair. The staircase was more of a ladder, it was old, wooden, and rather wobbly. Harry hoped it would hold both him and Draco without collapsing under their combined weight. He wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans one by one and checked the temperature displayed on his thermometer. Thirteen degrees. It was getting colder. He took another step, using one hand to steady himself on the flimsy railing, while still gripping the thermometer tightly in the other hand. He could feel the air getting chillier with each step he took as if the attic was drafty. It was hard to tell, in these old houses, when the coldness was caused by a deteriorated insulation and when the presence of ghosts was at play. Harry was in the middle of the staircase when he realized there was a strange sound coming from above him. Almost like… he stopped and frowned, trying to place the origin of the sound.
„I do, I feel like the shock factor is the best way to go about this. This way, they won‘t have any chance to try and talk me out of it. As if they could. Besides, I think some of your wickedness is contagious because I can‘t wait to see Ron‘s face when he realizes I‘m dating you,“ Harry snickered. „And then again when Pansy and Blaise arrive,“ he added quietly, suddenly not so certain it was a good idea after all.
"I would very much like to have a chat with Mr. Malfoy and see what he can tell us," Robards continued. "How about nine tomorrow at my office?"
"Run," Draco shouted and all three of them frantically charged by memory through the thickening smoke toward the entrance door. Mercifully this time, when Draco pulled at the handle, the door gave way, and they all but fell outside through the opening as the three of them tried to squeeze out at the same time. They scrambled a bit on the porch and sprinted across the courtyard and out through the iron gate.
Draco silently thanked her and promised himself he would buy her the most expensive chocolate he could find. He reached for the handle behind his back blindly and tried to open the door. It was stuck. Draco turned around and furiously pulled at the handle. Nothing happened.
Draco smiled and lifted Harry up in his arms. He was knackered but he couldn‘t resist trying to beat Harry at something, even if it was just being able to walk after impressive sex.
He looked outside the window. The shadows had slowly started deepening, and in a few minutes, it would be dark inside the house, with all the lights turned off. "Anyway, Mr. Throw-up-during-blowjobs, I think it's time for you to pull it out and show me what you can do with it."
The lyrics were interspersed with various curses and hisses of pain. Draco wiped the tears from his eyes and buried his forehead in his hand in fond exasperation. For a moment he couldn't believe he was friends with those two idiots, yet he was grateful for them at the same time.
"Oh God, I wanted to do that for hours," Potter babbled. "You're so beautiful. I missed you in Chicago so much."
"Right, and you want me to believe you're doing this out of the goodness of your heart? That you genuinely want to help people?" Tracey snorted derisively.
"Shut up," Harry whispered furiously, hoping Draco hadn't overheard them. Out of all fucking days, Smith had to be there yesterday. Harry turned around and saw Draco's venomous glare trained at him.
Draco felt a wave of warmth spreading through him, accompanied by a pleasant tingling sensation. It must have been really hot inside the club, Draco thought, for him to feel as if he was subjected to a heatwave tearing through his body.
Draco started quickly toward the lifts to the lower floors as if he couldn't stand the press of the crowd around him. Harry realized some of the people around them were whispering, words like Death Eater, scum, and filth reached his ears. Draco held his chin high and shoulders square, his poise as immaculate as ever, his long strides elegant, as he strode purposefully through the Atrium. Harry had never entered the Ministry together with Draco. He had never heard what other people said about him. He had never seen how deeply their words affected Draco, although Harry knew he was the only one who could tell. He suddenly understood why Draco had been reluctant to make their relationship public as the insults would only grow worse once people found out about them. When Harry asked Draco to make their relationship public, he had been scared of the reactions they would get. He never truly understood how much worse it would be for Draco and how much slander would be thrown his way. After the events of the past few days, Harry couldn't care less about what the public thought. He would stand by Draco and defend him with everything he had.
"You're no fun, Harry," Draco complained playfully. "But I meant it, I need some help in the bathroom."
„I don‘t even know where to begin apologizing,“ Harry started talking as soon as the door closed behind Narcissa.
Confusion swims in the grey eyes but transforms into understanding when Harry whispers "Accio Draco's wand."
In the past two days, their flirting had increased both in frequency and boldness, largely thanks to Harry's persistence. He didn't care that his flirting skills were rusty and most of what he said was either ridiculous or gauche. He loved being able to behave facetiously for once in his life and Draco's gruff retorts only made him want to do it all the more. Another reason was that Draco obviously enjoyed the bad flirting as much as Harry did, even though he never admitted it out loud.
He couldn't stay in the office a moment longer with the picture haunting him. He needed to breathe, he needed fresh air. He jumped out of his chair, restless. He staggered out of the office and locked the door behind him hurriedly, his hands shaking.
"Did you? That is so sweet," Harry replied mockingly, even though he was being serious. His stomach fluttered as Malfoy's blush deepened even more.
"You're preposterous," Harry said after a while when they found themselves at the bottom of the stairs leading to the first floor. "That's not what I meant and you know it. I was implying your flirting is rusty."
"I don't know," Draco whispered. Why did it hurt so much, hearing his friends speak about Harry this way? How could Draco not remember what Harry sounded like during sex, how he felt in Draco's arms when he'd been supposedly madly in love with him mere days ago?
Inexplicably, Draco's breath caught in his chest and he suddenly felt light-headed. His heart was beating fast, almost painfully, against his rib cage. How much alcohol was in the drink? Surely, he couldn't be this affected by a single gulp of it. He shook his head to clear it but it didn't help at all.
"Draco, what is it, what's wrong?" Harry moved so quickly to Draco's side it seemed like Apparition.
"Nope, I just said it to get rid of that bothersome hag," came the reply as Draco started off through the corridor, presumably in search of the kitchen, leaving Harry behind.
All of a sudden, there was a knock on the door. Pansy marked her spot in the book and with a grunt, she untangled herself from her cocoon. Bloody Draco, how many times did she tell him to come in through the Floo? His reply was always the same; the Floo powder was hard to wash off completely and he didn't want to risk leaving a trace of it on himself when going out to hunt ghosts. On one hand Pansy understood his reluctance to use magic. On the other hand, the restrictions Draco had put in place still made her want to claw his eyes out sometimes. Especially when she was forced to cook the Muggle way.
"How did you mean it then?" Malfoy sneered at him, shaking Harry's hand off. His grey eyes were sharp and threatening. "Maybe the real reason for you wanting to join my agency is not as innocent as you made it sound. Maybe you think the Problem is somehow my fault? That I'm up to something again?"
Draco ignored him and moved an empty chair next to his own so that Potter could sit next to him during the interview with their client.
Draco squirmed. Harry knew everything about him but Draco didn't know anything. He didn't know how to make Harry feel good, even though he desperately wanted to. Something must have shown in his face because Harry was suddenly there, pressing open-mouthed kisses on Draco's collarbone.
Draco looked over at Harry. His face was raw and he was biting his bottom lip vigorously. There was pain and resignation as if Harry expected Draco would ask him to leave. Draco sighed.
Harry‘s eyes softened and he kissed Draco sweetly, reveling in the softness of his lips. Draco deepened the kiss, sneaking his tongue inside Harry‘s mouth. Their tongues danced against each other playfully. Harry pulled away and sighed contentedly.
"The one and only," Draco smiled at her over the cup of his coffee. It was not a pleasant smile. "Now, tell me all you know about the asylum."
Harry smiled to himself. He loved their banter and taunts. He couldn‘t imagine having a relationship where he wouldn‘t be able to tease his partner mercilessly and his partner wouldn't tease him in return. Hell, who was he kidding, he couldn‘t imagine having a partner who wasn‘t Draco Malfoy. Harry stood up and offered Draco his hand.
The feel of the sticky warmth filling him tipped Harry over the edge as well, his own come painting his sweaty stomach in stripes of white. He slumped in his position, nearly toppling over. Draco caught him and pressed him against his chest.
"Harry, you are fixated on the theory that Malfoy's kidnapping is connected to you coming out as a couple. What if it's not? What if it's completely unrelated? We have to explore all the possibilities. We have to make sure we haven't overlooked anything. You know that Harry, you're the best Auror we've had on the force in a long time. You know I'm going to recommend you for the position of Head Auror once I retire. Don't let the fact that this case is personal mar the excellent instincts you have shown so far," Robards continued.
The wall imploded in a rain of bricks, mortar, and dust. Harry jumped through the hole, strong Protego wrapped around his body. He looked around quickly. The Entrance Hall was packed with the hostages who were staring at Harry in awe. Harry's eyes finally landed on Draco. He was kneeling on the floor, the front of his robes covered in blood. Draco smiled at him and toppled to the floor.
Her words stung more than Draco would ever admit out loud. But if he had to play the part of the bad guy for people to allow him to help them, Draco would gladly take it.
He felt spells being fired at the Shield but so far it held. Draco almost made it. He was nearly through the door to the Entrance Hall when he felt a curse slash through his Shield. It hit him straight between his shoulder blades. Draco fell to his knees, the pain lacing through his whole body. He tried to breathe in but started choking on his own blood. The spell must have slashed through his lung. Panic seized him.
"I don't even know why I'm surprised. Of course, you would be the only person in the whole world to hear and be able to speak to the ghosts. The miraculous Harry Potter," Draco sneered.
Draco rolled his eyes and snorted when Seamus started jumping around the podium crazily, his howling morphing into out-of-breath panting. Meanwhile, Ron's voice reached new heights, screeching like a dying bat.
There was only silence in his ears as if he was out of reach of the Listening Spell. Harry knew that couldn't be right. His breathing was ragged and he couldn't suppress the shivers running down his spine. The light from his wand cast strange moving shapes on the walls as his hand trembled uncontrollably. Harry took a cautious step inside, then another. He was almost at Montague's side when he heard the door slam shut behind him. Harry whirled around, frantically searching the room around him. The darkness suddenly seemed impenetrable and it seemed to suffocate the light of Harry's wand. He couldn't see further than five feet anymore. The silence in the room pushed oddly against Harry's eardrums as he strained to hear anything. All he could discern were his own fast and shallow breaths.
He took a gulp and leaned back against the padding of the booth casually, still holding the glass. His shoulder was pressed against Malfoy's. Harry's breath hitched as a thousand butterflies fluttered in his stomach at the contact. Harry was a bit tipsy which made him bold. He leaned into Malfoy a bit more and drew in a deep breath.
„Potter,“ Draco hissed as his spine bowed involuntarily. Once he gained control of his body again, he leaned sideways, searching his discarded robes for a wand.
"Yes, you git. It's always been you. I'm kind of in love with you, in case you haven't noticed," Potter smiled softly and captured Draco's mouth with his in a kiss that swept Draco off his feet. Potter licked along Draco's lower lip and pulled it in his mouth. He sucked at it as if it was the sweetest lollipop. Draco snuck his tongue inside Potter's mouth and allowed himself to drown in the taste of Potter. He wasn't scared anymore.
„Fuck!“ Harry cursed, a premonition that something bad was happening raising goosebumps across his spine.
Harry nudged her with his chin and spooned her. Hermione didn't ask any more questions but he could feel her body stiffen in his arms.
Draco saw red. His breathing was ragged and he only dully took in his surroundings. The other Aurors were standing still, observing the exchange, an uncomfortable silence stretching around them. Only the last vestiges of Draco's reason saved him from punching Smith in the face. He turned around on his heel and stomped into the relative safety of his office. Smith was an arsehole and Draco would not get fired over an argument with him.
Harry smiled at him and placed a hand on Draco's lower back, pushing him gently in the direction of the bar. As he was being led away, he noticed Pansy, Hermione and Blaise stare after them with similar expressions on their faces. All three of them were smiling secretively as if they knew something Draco didn't. He raised an eyebrow at Pansy in what he hoped was an intimidating inquiry but she only winked and blew him a kiss.
"Shut it, you bint," Draco sneered at her. Her remark cut too close to the truth and he felt angry at himself for being so blatantly obvious. Then again, Pansy had known him since before he could walk so maybe he wasn't being that obvious.
Harry bends Draco's knees, lies on top of him, holding himself up on his elbows. He kisses Draco softly, sweetly, and ever so slowly eases himself inside the heat of Draco's hole. Harry fights his own body not to slam inside. He makes the movements shallow, while he kisses Draco, easing his tongue inside his mouth, his tongue mirroring the movements of his cock.
„I am so tired, Draco,“ Harry whispered, a hint of mischief colouring his voice. „I don‘t think I will be able to wash myself. Will you help me?“
Potter's eyes found Draco's and a corner of his mouth turned up playfully. Not a reaction Draco expected. "I do pay attention to things I find interesting, Malfoy."
„My left pocked,“ Draco moaned while jumping off the table and turning around. He lay his torso on Harry‘s desk and stuck his arse out in invitation.
What if Draco went out to fuck someone else, Harry's mind supplied as he barreled through the corridor into the kitchen. Shut up, he told the ugly part of his brain where the rage still resided. If Draco was sick, maybe he went to see his mother? Harry ran through the kitchen which was dark and empty. The panic inside his chest was like a living beast, scratching at his insides. He stopped as if hit by an invisible barrier when he crossed the threshold to the living room. Draco was lying on the floor, unconscious, covered in puke.
"Don't overthink it," Harry whispered against Draco's skin. "I want to worship you tonight, I'm going to make you feel heavenly. I still can't believe I got you back. Promise me you'll be here in the morning."
Harry‘s involuntary wail sounded like a howl of a wounded animal. It sent a fresh stab of pain through Draco‘s heart.
"What? Tea? How the bloody hell do we have time for tea? I thought you said you wanted to get a feel of the house before it gets dark," Harry stared at him in confusion.
Draco's suspicion that all of his friends were acting crazy only grew. He frowned and observed the silent communication - Blaise's glare and Harry's desperate, wide, pleading eyes. In the end, Harry cleared his throat and stepped closer to Draco.
„That will be all, thank you. Close the door on your way out, will you,“ Draco dismissed her formally.
"Do you need my help with it?" Harry asked hopefully. He was bored to death and longed for something useful to do. He usually hated research but anything was better than another day of cleaning up.
"No, I'm not. Give it back," Draco held his palm up and tapped his foot on the pavement for a good measure.
Draco picked up a neatly folded net made of thin iron chains. "Once you throw the net over the Source, it renders it inert, effectively dismissing the ghost."
Harry saw how frustrated Draco looked at that moment and he realized how hard it must have been for him after the war. Trying to live a life as a disgraced ex-Death Eater, even though deep down, in his heart, he was never truly on Voldemort's side.
"You have the best ideas, every once in a while," Harry replied teasingly, his voice but a hoarse whisper from all the shouting. His knees buckled and Draco caught him reflexively. Harry smiled up at him and pressed his forehead against Draco‘s shoulder. „In a minute, when I can walk?“
"How about we get a pint after work?" Harry offered, unsure what to do. He wanted to be close to Draco, wanted to be there for him. He'd gone through so much in the last twenty-four hours and Harry didn't want to leave him alone. Harry knew from his own experience what it was like to be locked inside his own head with only ugly thoughts for company.
„I think he would actually be upset if I didn‘t praise his divine skills,“ Harry chuckled. „Anyway, I think it‘s time you finally met him. How about dinner? Tomorrow at seven, my place?“
Once Harry relatively calmed down, he decided to fire-call Hermione. He caught her at her office in St Mungo's, in between patients.
"What is it? What happened?" she asked, concerned. Theo was always full of energy these days. His changed demeanor worried her.
"Don't you fucking die, you wanker," Draco felt his head loll against Potter's chest. It was a nice chest, firm and warm. He wished he could lick it and tried to snuggle closer. Pain enveloped him.
"I'm going to make you come like this," Harry whispered in Draco's ear. "You have no idea how much I want you right now."
“You need to stop worrying, Malfoy,” Potter added with a wry smile. “With you on the case, everything will go like clockwork.”
“You know,” and her voice was gentle now. “It’s okay to fall for Harry. I for one, can easily understand why you would.”
“Please, Draco, no young person goes to bed at eight,” his mother interrupted again. “I was quite embarrassed when I had to tell Mr Potter to wait as I sent Blimpy up to rouse you.”
“Thanks for offering to help though.” Potter continued. “Bath time can be pretty hectic and I’m rather tired today.”
. He looked up and Potter was watching him with eyes that shone with pure happiness, his smile wide and true.
They made their purchases and Draco paid this time, insisting that he owed Potter after the film. Then they found an empty table which was unfortunately in the middle of the shop. Within moments, most of the room was staring at their little trio. Al however, was too busy getting the contents of his mint chocolate chip ice cream cone all over his face and shirt to pay them any heed and his father seemed to be not too far from doing the same.
“Draco, you had a noseless, murdering psychopath using your home as his creepy headquarters. If you can survive that, you can survive
“I’d love to actually, but it’s not worth having an angry Auror after me in the end,” Draco sighed. “I modified the jinx a bit so it’ll wear off on its own eventually. Might take a couple of days though.”
Granger opened her mouth to say something but Ginevra suddenly bustled in and Draco’s heart sank, knowing that Harry wouldn’t be too far behind. He really should stop calling him ‘Harry’ even if it was in his mind, but after that…
Draco threw his hands in the air and made an explosive noise that was pure frustration. “You can all thank your precious boy-hero for these,” he groused in a loud voice, gesturing viciously to his whole neck, which was apparently quite a sight if everyone couldn’t seem to stop
“You can go to bed, Mother,” he said softly, keeping his voice low as to not disturb the quiet tranquillity of the gardens around them. “I’ll come in after a bit.”
Draco nodded, wondering if Fortesque’s still sold the sundae he was especially partial to. The ice cream parlour was bustling when they entered but the crowd seemed to part for Potter, and they found themselves at the counter in no time.
Draco hurried on without pause, ignoring the taunts and laughter that followed in his wake. He gritted his teeth as he pulled his hood up to cover his hair and obscure his face a bit. He really should have listened to Mother when she’d told him to cover up his distinctive hair, but after being subjected to the indignity of being forced to leave the Manor against his will, he hadn’t exactly been in a listening sort of mood.
was soothing but when Draco looked at Potter he seemed anything but relaxed, fidgeting in his seat and looking up at the ceiling, expression troubled.
In a few minutes, the stew was done, and Kreacher served them both generous helpings, accompanied by freshly baked buns. The meal was hardly of gourmet standard, but Draco still found himself gulping it down with the occasional happy sigh.
Potter’s face was a picture. He smiled broadly at Draco and for a terrifying moment seemed about ready to engulf him in a hug, but thankfully refrained from doing so.
Kreacher seemed properly torn between the prospects of shooing Draco out of his kitchens and arranging the plate himself, or getting praised by one of the esteemed Black sisters. After a moment of careful contemplation, the elf nodded and disappeared with an eager
Mrs Weasley nodded approvingly. “Good girl.” She turned to the two Malfoys. “Now then, are you alright?” she enquired politely.
“Oh, so you’ve almost finished up with the décor, have you?” Weasley said with blatantly feigned casualness, his eyebrows resting near his hairline. “The cake turned out perfectly, by the way.”
...sticking out all over the place. He seemed to be wearing a shirt that had to be at least ten sizes too big for him and an ugly pair of baggy pants. Add to that, the fact that he was also wearing only one sock and no shoes and was looking around with the eyes of a fanatic, Draco concluded that in the years following the War, Potter had finally gone round the bend.
He was too busy staring at the couple in front of them. They were still ribbing each other and gave off the feel of two individuals who knew each other as well as they knew themselves. It was obvious to any onlooker that they shared a lot of history. At one point Ginevra offered Harry a bag of some sort of sweets. He took one out and bit it, chewing it contemplatively before offering the half-eaten piece to her to try. Draco found himself almost blindsided by the sudden jolt of jealousy that shot through him.
Draco gave a strained smile. His mother had been doing this more and more often these days; making barbed remarks about Lucius. She still hadn’t forgiven him for the hell he’d landed their family in, but most of all, Draco thought she was angered by the Mark that still marred his left arm. It had stopped moving the moment Voldemort had been defeated, but even after almost a year, it was still plainly visible against his pale skin. Faded, but still there – an ever-present reminder.
The following day found Draco shopping in Diagon Alley once more. He’d gone in search of a belated birthday gift for Teddy even though his aunt had told him it wasn’t necessary, seeing as how he hadn’t even known about Teddy’s existence when his birthday had passed. Still, Draco had wanted to give his new cousin something special and really, a child could never have too many gifts now could he? Eventually he’d come across a book on constellations and the myths behind them. Ever since Draco had told him about the constellation for which he’d been named, the child had shown an interest in astronomy – emboldened by their trip to the observatory later on. He was sure the book would be much appreciated.
Well now, Draco had done a lot of things in his life that he was ashamed to admit, but never had he reduced a child to tears. It was unnerving, and he didn’t understand why the child was crying in the first place. Draco hadn’t even said a word and surely he wasn’t so horrible to look at that a child would break into hysterics at the sight of him. He’d never understand the workings of the mind of a child.
“Mother.” Draco growled. “Even if what you suggest is true, which it most certainly is not, you’re forgetting the rather crucial fact that the man is
“Oh, Draco.” Ginny gave him a sympathetic pat on the cheek. “I suppose this is all down to bad communication. I was sure Harry had said something to you.” She looked accusingly at Potter.
Draco described his little expedition to Potter who apart from the occasional interruption, listened in raptured silence. He’d visited places he’d never known existed, seen enough exotic plants to send Longbottom into herbology heaven and met Masters who were as brilliant as they appeared to be mad.
“I just thought I’d ask,” Malfoy said defensively. “People have been staring at my left arm all year like it’s going to devour them, but nobody’s actually
Harry and Draco stood next to each other in the Astronomy Tower, staring out at the grounds. The sky was clearer than it’d been in ages, and Harry marveled at the way the moonlight splashed over the grounds, highlighting the freshly fallen snow. Draco’s breath clouded in front of his face, and his face was flushed from the cold wind whipping around them. Harry smiled at the redness on his lips, left behind by the candy cane he’d eaten earlier.
“Yes, I do understand what a cane is for, you smart-arse.” Malfoy rolled his eyes.“I meant why have you got one? You look fine to me.”
A shrill voice sounded through the room as Harry and Draco stepped out of the fireplace and into Andromeda Tonks’ living room. Harry barely had a chance to regain his balance—he still
Draco waved his wand with his free hand, and Harry groaned under his breath when quiet violin music began to play. Ignoring him, Draco put his wand away and positioned Harry’s hand on his shoulder before placing his own on Harry’s waist.
As much as he despised the ordeal, Harry was thankful. The longer he and Draco were kept in the entry hall, the less time he had to spend in the Great Hall, surrounded by the memories of broken bodies and broken mothers.
Harry ran his fingers over the nearly pressed Malfoy seal at the bottom of the page, done in silver, of course. Harry sighed and wandered into the kitchen, letter in hand.
The boys turned and ran, but not without shooting another foul look towards Malfoy, who was struggling to his feet.
Draco gave Harry a dubious look, but took a handful of powder. He threw it into the fireplace and stepped into the emerald flames. Harry sighed and followed him through.
The door slammed shut, leaving Draco cold, confused, and surrounded by silence. It was only a few moments later that he realised that Harry had had the most startling green eyes he’d ever seen.
“You bought the entire Slytherin team brand new, state of the art brooms. Tact was not your strongest skill.”
Draco led him up and away from the reporters and the guests still watching their every move. They walked quickly, so quickly that it made Harry’s leg ache. He focused on it, on the pain and the burning in his lungs, used it to get away from the reminders of all the ways he’d failed.
“Harry, I understand you don’t want to kiss anybody, but I am getting increasingly irritated at having a conversation with you while you’re three steps behind,” Draco said. “Honestly, you should know by now that I wouldn’t force you to kiss me, mistletoe or not.”
Thank you everyone for your comments! I've been swamped with finals, so I haven't been able to respond to them, but I do see them and they've definitely made these past couple weeks better!
“Never mind. Draco, wait. Where are you going?” Harry hurried after Draco, who had made a beeline straight for the telephone booth. “They’re really not that exciting. It’s just a phone booth.”
The walk to the Great Hall was slow and silent, save for the quiet tapping of Harry’s cane. Though they weren’t touching, Draco was close enough that Harry could smell his cologne, something sweet and strong and grounding all at once. It wasn’t until they were at the top of the staircase leading into the entry hall that Draco grasped Harry’s hand, adjusting his hold to surreptitiously help Harry down the stairs.
Draco took a deep breath and sat on a nearby boulder. His body ached, and he was so tired. He sighed and looked to his left. The thestral stood nearby, staring at him. It took him nearly a minute to work out what it was.
Draco covered the mouthpiece of the phone with his hand and scowled at the man crouching on the floor beside him.
“Why is it the days leading up to Christmas are always so hard?” he asked, keeping his head pressed against the wood.
“No, I don’t expect it does,” Draco responded, looking around. “I see you didn’t heed my warning about the baubles.”
Harry didn’t look at Draco, and Draco didn’t speak, but he pulled Harry closer, feeling like he understood.
Harry loved the scent of evergreen. Christmas had been the only chance he’d really had to smell it, peeking from around the door of his cupboard and just breathing it in, pretending like he didn’t hear the sound of the Dursleys laughing over cheerful Christmas music.
Harry’s voice cracked on the last word, and he realised then that he’d been shouting. Draco looked stricken, like he hadn’t actually expected Harry to respond to his provocations and wasn’t sure what to do next.
Mostly inspired by the fact that I am spending most of tomorrow travelling. It's short because I have to pack now. Thank you for reading!
There were far too many people keen on kissing The Saviour of the Wizarding World this Christmas. Harry was beginning to consider catching a cold.
, remembers the rushing in his ears, the absolute terror stronger than anything he'd ever felt, just before the spell hit him.
"Harry, being afraid doesn’t make you a coward," Draco said, grasping Harry’s shoulders and forcing him to pay attention. "Wanting bad things to end does not make you a coward. We all lost things in that war, and we all gave things, but I doubt there were many who would have willingly walked to their death."
Harry looked up from the letter Hermione had sent him to see, to no surprise, Malfoy in front of him.
“Goodnight,” said Harry, stunned by the feeling of her hand on his shoulder. He heard her shoes on the hard floor and, just before she opened the door, said, “I wanted to see if I could do it.”
I'm posting this on my phone, since my computer is acting up. I think the formatting should be okay, but I'll double check once my computer's back to normal. As always, thank you for reading! Happy Solstice!
“If there’s anything Americans like to buy more from these shops, it’s miniatures of telephone booths and Big Ben,” Harry said cheerfully, holding out the incredibly small bag the shopkeeper had handed him. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
Harry concentrated on the empty space before him, slowly drawing a circle in the air with his wand, and concentrating on the image in his mind. He lowered his wand and looked down.
Harry waited for Draco to turn around before he bent down and picked up a handful of snow. He pressed it into a lumpy ball and, before Draco had a chance to look back to see where he’d got to, Harry threw the snowball, hitting Draco square in the back.
“Not in the least.” Harry grinned. “I think Kreacher made cookies.” He nodded at the small platter of cookies sitting on the table by the tree.
“We live on bread and water, actually,” Harry said. “Neither of us can be bothered to turn on the kettle.”
He stood up and hurried out of the room. Draco watched him go, tucking the ticket back into his book without a word.
Harry did think that Draco was standing closer than usual, and seemed more at ease, but that could have easily been his imagination.
Another short one because I, once again, forgot I had plans tonight! (Yay union meetings and also seeing movies at 10pm! I'm currently writing this in a coffee shop.) Thank you for reading! :D
Grimmauld Place was warm and decorated, much to Harry’s surprise. Draco was standing in the sitting room, looking around with a strange expression on his face.
"This place brings back so many memories," Harry murmured, but he straightened his robes the best he could and ran a hand through his wet hair. Draco cast drying charms over the both of them and then pulled open the door.
“We’ve been outside for twenty minutes, Harry. Stop being so dramatic,” Draco said. “I know for a fact that you’ve taken walks longer than this.”
“Tonight’s going to go perfectly,” he said soothingly, “but we really do need to leave now if we don’t want to be late.”
Finals are over! I am free! (If you didn't notice, Harry emulated some of my feelings about these past couple weeks.) Thank you for reading! <3
He groaned and pushed back from the desk, packing his bag with a wave of his wand. He nodded at Madam Pince as he passed the circulation desk, and could feel her eyes burning into his back until he was well into the corridor. She, much like most of the school, didn’t know what to make of him.
“I never really thought it was you, you know,” Draco said quietly, resting his hand on Harry’s left elbow. Harry looked down at it, then shifted to rest on his back.
At last, Harry was able to wrench his arm free, and he stumbled backwards slightly. Draco reached out as if to steady him, but the look on Harry’s face stopped him.
“Ah, yes,” he said. “ A sweet tooth doesn’t really fit into the Evil Slytherin stereotype, does it?”
"You know what the worst part of it all is? I wasn’t even surprised when I found out Dumbledore had planned it all from the very beginning. I wasn’t surprised that I was stupid enough not to notice it. Nobody else had, after all."
He wasn’t too keen on admitting that last bit, but the fiasco with the letter had forced his hand. (He wished he could say that Hermione had been wrong in saying that he had an obsession with Malfoy, but even he couldn’t convince himself of that anymore.)
