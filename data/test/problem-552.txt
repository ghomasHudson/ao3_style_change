The pitch is empty. It usually is the weekend after a game, but Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if Diggory would have planned extra hours for his team. The field is massive when it’s just two people walking onto it. The stands are empty. It’s still too cold to sit outside for long periods of time. That means they will have some privacy while Draco tries to lift off from the ground.
Harry James Potter
That was the moment Professor Snape was suddenly next to me. He took hold of my shoulders and made me look into his eyes. He warned me not to do anything stupid, that it would be for nothing. He again said that Draco was still alive and that I just had to find him. I nodded and started eating the Gillyweed. Professor Snape smiled at me and said that he would not give me detention for stealing the Gillyweed from his office. Later I told him that Dobby had gotten it for me and asked Professor Snape not to take it out on the elf, that he had just wanted to help me and Draco. But at that moment, I didn’t care where the Gillyweed came from.
James places his arm around Harry’s shoulders and stays silent for a while. Harry turns to look at him and watches as James purses his lips. “I wish I could tell you, kiddo,” James says. “But I don’t know. Even though your mother first rejected me, I knew she liked me too. If she hadn’t, nothing I would have done would have made her change her mind.”
Harry doesn’t need any more encouragement and almost runs out of Remus’ office.
And fuck, Harry is distracted again. He’s supposed to come up with a way to find Pettigrew and stop him. He shouldn’t be contemplating his sexuality and his maybe-crush on Malfoy. The only problem is that Malfoy is on Harry’s mind. He keeps drifting back to him. And no ideas on how to find Pettigrew pop into mind. Or how to even stop him. Will Harry have to kill him? Would Harry do that to save his family? He’s never killed anyone before. It changes you. That is what James once said. That the war changed them the most because they had to kill to survive. Harry doesn’t want to change. But he also can’t have Neville or Iris in danger.
When I woke up again I was in the hospital wing and headmaster Dumbledore was sitting next to my bed. I freaked out a little and told him that Quirrell had the stone. But he told me to relax and that everything was fine. I looked around then and saw that the table next to me was piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. The headmaster said they were tokens from my friends and admirers since the entire school seems to know what happened in the dungeons, even though it’s a complete secret.
“Yeah, that sounds nice,” Draco answers. Harry pulls him in close and hugs him. The hug lasts a little longer than usual, and when Harry moves away, he gives Draco a soft kiss on his cheek.
“Come on, Harry. We need to speak tactics,” Oliver says. “Your brother won’t die if he has to go see your uncle alone. But you will die if you are late for Quidditch practise again.”
Remus sighs. “You know I will.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asks.
Harry groans and then drops his head on the table in front of him. Neville laughs and Iris pouts her lips. “What’s so funny?” she asks.
Draco looks up at Harry and shakes his head. “No, Harry. You love Christmas dinners at the Weasleys. I won’t ask you to stay away from it.”
By then Hermione was pulling me out of the Great Hall. People on either side of me drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Hermione dragged me all the way to Myrtle’s bathroom before she turned on me and asked me why I had never told her I was a Parselmouth. I told her I didn’t even know what that mend and she explains it means I can talk to snakes. I told her I know I can talk to snakes, that I once accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo. I thought loads of people could do it, talk to snakes. But it turns out it’s very rare and that it was bad. I asked why it was bad. Didn’t people understand that if I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin… And that is where Hermione cut me off and told me that she could only hear me speaking Snake language and that it sounded creepy. I had never realised I spoke a different language, and that still freaks me out a little. How can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it? And then I asked again why it was bad and Hermione told me that being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for and that now the whole school will be certain that I’m his great-great-great-grandson and therefore the one who attacked Colin and Mrs Norris.
Harry shakes his head. “He won’t. He feels the same, I promise.”
Harry leans forward and kisses Draco. “I love you,” he tells Draco.
“So, what is it that you’ve been thinking about,” Harry asks when the curiosity gets the best of him.
And then we talked about Black. I asked him if he had known him too as they had both been friends with my father. He said he did. He didn’t really want to talk about it. He looked at the picture on his desk and then looked out of his window. He told me they had been friends for so long, that he still can’t really believe that he did what he did, kill all those people. I think Professor Lupin was close to tears. His voice was trembling and I just couldn’t tell him what I had overheard, that I now know that Black was my godfather, your best friend and that he betrayed you, dad.
Something hits Harry. It’s not the ground and he starts to slow down. He opens his eyes and spots the stands in the distance. He can see Draco’s blond hair next to Hermione’s big bush of curls. They must be so scared. Harry wants to shout that it will all be okay. But when he opens his mouth, the ground collides with him. His head bounces on the grass and then the world goes black.
But, like I was saying, I was just flying around, spinning upside down and enjoying myself when Malfoy started staring at me. And he didn’t stop. He just kept staring at me all day. And when he was lying in bed he didn’t close his curtains all the way, so he could still stare at me. I closed mine as soon as I was ready for bed. Ever since then, he stares at me a lot, but only when the others aren’t around or aren’t looking at us. I don’t know what to think of it. It isn’t like anything else changed. He still makes fun of my inabilities whenever he gets a change and still insists on sitting next to me in most of our classes so he can bump his arm against mine when we’re taking notes.
“It’s wrong,” Harry says.
When the crowd comes in for lunch, they all pack away their books and decide to move over to the Gryffindor table, just to make sure nobody makes a fuss off them all sitting together. Draco comes along. Percy gets up to say something about it, but Ron stops him before he even gets a chance. “He’s our friend and he’s not eating alone,” Ron says. Percy backs off, as Fred and George whoop from across the table.
Harry turns around to continue his track down the carriage to look for Iris. He only makes it two steps before a force hits him in the chest. Platinum blond hair and angry grey eyes are in front of Harry’s face. Malfoy’s fists slam against Harry’s chest, over and over. Harry tries to get a hold of Malfoy’s hands to stop the assault.
“He doesn’t like it that you’re gay?” Harry asks.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. Every time he hints to Draco stepping fully to his side, he backs away. He wants to tell Draco again that he can’t love Harry and still fight against him. And that he will do everything in his power to keep Draco’s mother save. But all the words so far have been wrong. Ron once said that silence can be all someone needs to figure it out. And maybe he’s right. No matter how badly Harry wants to tell Draco he has to make a choice, maybe all he needs to do is show Draco how much he loves him until Draco is ready to make the choice all by himself.
Fuck, Harry hadn’t thought about that. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin Christmas, " Harry says.
Draco was fine. Madam Pomfrey mended the cut in about a second and gave him some potion to calm down. Hagrid was really sorry and we told him not to worry about it. It was just an accident, we both know that Buckbeak didn’t mend to hurt us. Madam Pomfrey then told Hagrid to go and talk to the Headmaster and made sure Draco and I got some dinner before she sent us back to our own common room.
Granger’s eyes widen and her mouth freezes before any sounds escape. The insult she planned to fling at Draco lost at the sight in front of her.
“You tell him, Ron,” Fred shouts.
Harry waves his hand to free George. “Don’t worry, I’m sticking around,” Harry says, his other hand still firmly planted on Draco’s stomach. “I don’t want to miss a single moment of our little miracle.”
“Yes, always too busy with his dragons,” Ron answers. “But I’ll see them after. We’re spending New Years at my place. The fireworks are better than the Muggle stuff you see sometimes. I don’t want to miss that.”
After that day, Nott and Crabbe avoid the common room and sit alone during meals. None of the other Slytherins like it that they almost destroyed our chances to win the Quidditch Cup this year. Draco says it’s deserved after everything they did to me, but I feel sorry for them. I know how hard it is when the rest of your house hates you. I hope everyone just forgets about it soon and things go back to normal.
“Yeah, well not everyone falls pregnant on their first try,” Draco answers. “I’m sure you will hear it when we’re expecting again.”
Ron also taught me wizard chess. It’s the same as normal Muggle chess except that the figures are alive. It felt like I was directing troops in battle. Ron his chessmen listened to him and did what he wanted, but the pieces I had borrowed from Seamus Finnigan didn’t trust me and kept shouting bits of advice at me, which was very confusing. Image a general giving his man orders and them all ignoring him and telling him how to do its job. It would be chaos, just like my chess game.
“Great,” Ron answers. He slides into the seat Malfoy just evacuated. “Now I can copy her notes,”
“I’ll get Madam Pomfrey,” Harry says. He jumps off Draco’s bed and starts for Madam Pomfrey’s office.
Draco laughs and tells Hermione they will. They say their goodbyes and Draco puts his phone away. He rests his head on Harry’s shoulder and watches the telly with him in silence. His mind races and he can still feel the hole in his heart, but the strong arm around his shoulders helps, and maybe soon the pain will be replaced by the joy of a new little miracle of their own.
"Wish it was just that, Ron," Harry answers.
Only Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Draco’s sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. He said in wonderment that his master had given him a sock and that he was free. Mr Malfoy just stood there frozen, looking at Dobby, Draco and me and then he lunged at me, shouting I had stolen his son and his servant. And then there was a loud bang, Draco’s father was thrown backwards and Dobby shouted at him that he shall not harm Harry Potter. Draco’s father got up and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger and told Draco’s father that he shall go now and that he shall not touch Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy. Draco’s father gave us one more incensed stare and then he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
Love you
“He’s a Slytherin. Let the Slytherins deal with him,” Ron says in a flat voice.
“Don’t be so surprised, Mr Potter,” Mrs Prince says. “Mr Malfoy has been in this library almost daily for the last two years. It didn’t take long before I realised he can’t hear it when I speak to him. He never complains that I found another way to tell him it’s closing time.”
“Yes, dad. Go feel her,” Lily says excitedly.
Remus stands up and then pulls Harry in a weird sideways hug. “Harry. I might be your teacher now, I’m also still your uncle. You can always come to me when you need help.”
“It’s for school. We drew a farm today, and I had blue cows. But Olivia said that cows can’t be blue,” Teddy explains.
“I know we promised dad,” Neville says. “But I think we need to go look for Pettigrew. He was in the castle two weeks ago, he can’t be far away. And the Aurors don’t seem to be able to catch him.”
Malfoy stops and turns to look at Harry. “You called me Draco,” he says.
Draco puts Pansy back on the ground and looks at her. “You said the interview was one disaster.”
Draco lifts his lips and kisses Harry’s skin. “We’ll be together forever,” he whispers. “It won’t hurt, I promise. And I’ll be here when you wake up.” He puts his mouth over the wounds again and drinks more of Harry’s blood.
Professor McGonagall than raised her voice at Hermione, asking she would lead me to the Gryffindor common room. But Headmaster Dumbledore simply answered that I had known the location since Christmas break last year, when he had given the Weasleys permission to take me there, so I wouldn’t have to spend all my time alone in the Slytherin common room. I couldn’t believe my ears, the headmaster was telling a lie to help us out. Isn’t that amazing.
On Monday a new package gets delivered during breakfast. Harry looks for a clue about the sender, but there isn’t anything except the Hippogriff feather. Ginny giggles beside him and Hermione just lifts her eyebrows.
Neville raises his eyebrows and grins at Harry. “I don’t think that ever works,” he says.
I know I like it when he holds my hand. And I know that kiss made my heart pound in my throat. And I miss him really bad. I want to talk to him, see him. I want to stroke my hand through his blond hairs when they fall in front of his face. I even dream about him. Does this all mean that I like him? And that I’m a poof? Because I’ve been kind of thinking about what it would be like if he would really kiss me, on the lips, not just on my cheek. And I think I would like it. I think I really do like him. I really like him, as in I want him to be my boyfriend like him.
* * *
“You two are crazy,” Lily says and then she walks towards the house. “I’ll start dinner and try to forget that you two are useless.”
“I know it’s stupid, okay. And impossible. And never going to happen. So you don’t have to worry about anything,” Harry snaps. He knew Ron would never understand.
Harry hands him a steaming cup and Malfoy sips it carefully. This is the moment. They’re still alone. Harry should say it now before Malfoy’s colleagues arrive.
“Okay,” Neville says. They both stare at the ceiling again. Harry tries not to think of what it would mean if Draco rejects him as a friend because Harry is gay. He doesn’t want to lose him. Is that selfish of Harry, to keep his sexuality from the one boy he’s falling in love with? Because he is. He does not doubt that this is what it feels like to fall in love. His heart skips beats when he looks at Draco’s smile. His stomach is filled with butterflies and he blushes more and more when someone mentions Draco. The feeling is scary and great at the same time. And Harry has no idea what to do with it because he knows that Draco will never feel the same about him.
“No, sir. Dobby knows how. You need to take the Gillyweed.” He pushes some kind of herb into Harry’s hand. “Now hurry. You need to get young master Malfoy back.”
They both don’t say anything else. Harry is glad Hermione doesn’t push the subject. It’s clear that she suspects. And Harry can’t blame her. Neville also thinks it’s not just because Malfoy is deaf that Harry can’t leave him alone. And maybe it’s crazy to keep it a secret. Only Harry doesn’t want anyone to know yet. People will look at him differently. What if they won’t like him anymore? Or what if Wood kicks him off the Quidditch team? Harry can’t risk that. And it’s not as if there are a lot of gay students walking around Hogwarts, are they? It’s not common. And still frowned upon by many.
The minutes dragged by and I felt sad and lonely, even with Draco walking next to me. So I dog up my courage and told Draco I was sorry he had gotten into trouble because of me and that I missed him. Draco didn’t say anything back and when I looked up at him I saw he was crying. When Draco noticed that I was looking at him he whipped an arm over his eyes. In a soft voice, he said he missed me too. But his father had been very angry with him and it had scared him. I said again that I was sorry and asked if we’ll ever be okay. He said we would and he said he was sorry for ignoring me.
“Yeah, that sucks,” James says. He pulls Harry against his side and squeezes his shoulder. “Still going to be an amazing birthday party. All your other friends will be there. I know it’s hard to believe, but the entire world doesn’t revolve around Draco. You are allowed to have fun without him.”
“It’s worth a try,” Harry says. “As long as he doesn’t need to take anything, I’m open for it.”
Harry is glad the topic has changed. He takes the quill from Draco and writes: ‘That’s cool. Uncle Sirius is fun. He hates being deaf. He misses sounds. Do you also miss them?’
Harry shows him the movement Draco came up with. Neville repeats it. “Similar to dragon, smart,” he says.
Draco reads the note and a soft smile forms on his lips. ‘You don’t have to,’ he writes.
Malfoy sits at their usual spot. He doesn’t even look up when Harry slides onto the chair next to him. He just pushes a book towards Harry and then continues his scribbles. Harry picks up the book and laughs when he sees it’s about potions. He leafs through it and sighs. It’s mostly text. A lot of text.
“Nothing,” Harry says. “Just need some help.”
“You promise?” Iris asks.
Draco did it. He’s in the house team. I knew he could do it. Is it stupid that I’m happy for him, even though he ignores me all the time? I feel stupid about it. I should hate him by now, shouldn’t I? Ron and Neville have made up their minds about him, saying he’s a lowlife. Ron said that his parents were right that there could never come anything good from the Malfoy family. Hermione is a little more tactful, not really saying she thinks he’s an idiot, but I know she thinks it. Ron thinks Draco is only on the team because his father had bought new brooms for the entire team. But I know better. Draco was one of the better players to try out for the opened up Chaser position. Only no-one believes me when I say that. Hermione just gives me sad looks whenever I do.
I could see myself in the mirror. I was pale and scared-looking at first. But only a moment later, my reflection was smiling at me. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. Then he winked and put the stone back into the pocket. And at that moment I could feel something heavy drop into my real pocket. Somehow I had gotten the stone.
Hagrid has lost all his confidence when it comes to teaching. After the incident with Buckbeak, we’ve only learnt about Flobberworms. And let me tell you, those are the most boring creatures in existence. It’s really sad to see, and Nott and Crabbe like to point out all the time how crappy Hagrid is at teaching. Draco almost got into a fight with them last week. If Blaise and I hadn’t pulled him back to the castle I’m sure he would have been suspended to play Quidditch and that would make our loss even worse since Draco had scored all of the points we got that game.
Harry grins and takes his quill. ‘You don’t want Gryffindor to win?’ Harry writes. He’s laughing as he slides the parchment back to Malfoy who just rolls his eyes and points to his tie.
I think it was a good thing that Wood was a keeper because he looked like he wanted to hurt one of our team. Points went back and forth for some time, but Slytherin stayed in the lead. If was just never enough to win the cup. So even though I spotted the snitch a couple of times, I didn’t chase it. Every time I spotted it I faked a look of concentration and pulled my Firebolt around toward the other side of the field. McLaggen kept following me, not spotting the snitch but being stupid enough to think I would lead him to it. Like he could outfly me if I would spot it first.
Draco and I are doing fine by the way. I’ve had some talks with Ms Davis about that day of the second task. She said it was normal to fall back to thoughts like that, that it was fine and that it was a good thing I asked to see her straight away. She also wants to have some sessions with me and Draco together, to talk about our condition (that’s what she calls it, I’m still not sure how to name it). You remember the bond I mentioned between me and Draco in my last letter. Well, it’s called Corpora Anima Una. That is Latin for ‘the bodies of the soul’ and it means that we share a soul that lives in two bodies. Professor Snape tried to explain it all to us, but I still don’t fully understand.
After lunch, Draco and I said goodbye to our friends and made our way to the edge of the village to the foot of the mountain. We found a nice place to sit just outside the village on some boulders. We talked for a long time. About the bond, and what it means. How it explains how Draco had known in second year that something was wrong with me. How I’d felt so alone and broken when we weren’t together and how it made my depression of that year even worse. And the dreams I had, of Draco disappearing. We think it was because of the bond to. That I somehow could sense that my other half was slowly being taken over by Tom Riddle. It also explains why we always needed to touch each other, always linking our hands. And it explains why after we had sex it became less important to touch, but that we can sense each other all the time.
-x-x-x-x-x-
Tuesday 2 June 1992
Andromeda shakes her head, and Harry laughs. “That’s good advice from your grandma. We wouldn’t want to spill the tea you made us,” he says.
Draco shakes his head, afraid to open his mouth and puke all over his husband. That will ruin this Saturday morning, and Draco doesn’t want this morning to be ruined.
“Just like you hated him?” Hermione asks.
“I don’t care, you know,” Ron says now with some more confidence. “As long as you don’t try to kiss me, or Hermione for that matter, we’re cool.”
Neville points his wand at the map and mutters: “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Lines and figures start to appear on the parchment. Harry still doesn’t know how his dad, Sirius and Remus made the map. They won’t tell the secret. But he loves that James gave it to him when he first went to Hogwarts.
“How long is this going to last,” Draco asks between cramps.
‘Fine, I won’t help you. But will you help me? I could truly use some help with Potions,’ Harry writes. He gestures at the book in front of him.
“They became Animagi before they graduated Hogwarts?” Ron asks.
Even at top speed, it seems as if the castle is still miles away. Harry pushes forward. He breathes loudly as his legs take step after step. As quickly as he can he makes his way back. He bursts through the door and looks around. He’s got no clue which way is to the Hufflepuff common room. It’s not the same way as the Slytherin dungeons. Whenever Harry walks with Draco to his common room, he’s never seen any Hufflepuffs. So it must be the other way? Down the stairs to the right, instead of left? But what if Harry is wrong? What if he goes the wrong way and doesn’t find Neville in time? Neville could die.
“I remember,” Harry says.
We also ran into Terence Higgs, who introduced us to his parents and told us that he had dropped out of his potions masters studies because he got signed by the Puddlemere United reserve team. I told him Draco was made captain of the team now that Marcus had graduated and Terence said the right man got that job. A little further we saw Adrian and Miles who waved at us while they cooked breakfast for their families.
“What the bloody hell,” Harry shouts. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
The hour was over before we knew it and I was a bit disappointed I hadn’t spotted Draco again. But that all changed when we reached Flourish and Blotts. First Hermione went mental when she discovered that Gilderoy Lockhart was going to be there for a signing. Just like Mrs Weasley. We met up with her, the rest of the Weasley family and Hermione’s parents inside the shop. They were already in line to get his autograph.
The next day we had our Care of Magical Creatures exam. Hagrid didn’t seem like himself but we all had to focus on our exam so we didn’t really have a chance to speak to him. Potions was that afternoon. And even though Draco helped me study I just couldn’t get my Confusing Concoction to thicken. It was kind of frustrating to see Professor Snape’s disappointed look when he came to check my potion. Draco asked me afterwards what whet wrong, but I didn’t know. I thought I did everything as we had practised in class.
The door at the end of the carriage opens and something slides inside. A creature with a hood moves closer as the air around Harry seems to freeze. What is a Dementor doing on the train to Hogwarts? Do they think Pettigrew is on it? Will he be on his way to Hogwarts to try to avenge his master by finishing the job that killed Voldemort? Is Neville in danger? Neville is in one of the carriages from where the Dementor came. Maybe something might have already happened to him. And what about Uncle Remus? Neville was on his way to get him. Are they still alive? They are probably dead. And little Iris, still defenceless with her limited control over her magic. What if Pettigrew found her first? Will Harry be the only child returning to their parents tonight? It will destroy mum if something were to      happen to Iris. She was scared to let her go to Hogwarts with Pettigrew on the loose. James said there was nothing to worry about. Not with Dumbledore at Hogwarts and Uncle Remus as one of her teachers. But it wasn’t enough to keep them safe. Nobody is safe. Pettigrew will kill them all. Harry will be alone in this world.
But everyone who had known was dead. Sirius had passed soon after the agreement was made. Dumbledore fell. So did Snape and Tonks. There was nobody but Harry who knew of Draco’s mission for the order. The only one still alive that had seen Draco struggle with the fact that he had to take the Dark Mark. The mark that stood for everything he was against. The mark that clouded the Wizengamot’s judgement and just claimed his guilty without a proper trial.
Harry steps closer to him and kisses him. “You are a champion for having her,” he tells Draco. And he means it. No matter how difficult these last couple of months have been, they both know little Gwyneth will be worth it.
I think I just witnessed a real prediction from Professor Trelawney. I happened right after my exam, which I don’t think I’ve passed. Professor Trelawney saw us one by one and the waiting took forever. In the end, it was only me and Draco left. Draco went first and he wasn’t really happy when he came back down. He said he thought he failed, he couldn’t see a thing in the crystal bowl, so he made stuff up. He asked if he needed to wait for me but I told him I’d see him in the common room afterwards. I knew he wanted to write his mom about how his exams had gone and if he could do that before I was done we would have more time to spend with just the two of us.
The hallway of this carriage isn’t empty. At the other end, Malfoy just steps out of one of the bathrooms. He looks at Harry and his friends without moving. Harry shakes his head and looks in the first compartment. His sister isn’t there either.
Next, I ran into the Blast-Ended-Skrewt. And Cedric was right, it was enormous. I tried to stop it with a Stupefy, but the spell just rebounded on his armour. Then I tried Impedimenta, but that rebounded to. I stumbled backwards and fell down. The Skrewt was coming closer so I yelled Impedimenta as loud as I could. The Skrewt froze in place, so I got up and ran as fast into the other direction as I could. I think I hit the Skrewt on his fleshy underside with my second attempt of Impedimenta.
“Can we go open presents now?” Teddy asks.
“And what is that?” Remus says with a smile on his face.
Black then told me that he would never betray the two of you and I believed him. I couldn’t speak, my whole world had been turned upside down again so I just nodded. Pettigrew fell down on his knees after that and started to beg Black to remember that they are friends, and he pleaded with Lupin to believe him. At the same time, Black and Lupin looked at each other. Black said he was sorry for never telling Lupin that he wasn’t the secret keeper, and Lupin said he was sorry for ever believing Black was capable of betraying you. And then they decided they would kill him together. They threw Pettigrew onto the floor and asked him if he had sold you out to Voldemort. Pettigrew started crying and he confessed he did it. Black and Lupin raised their wand and I knew they were going to kill him. But if they did, nobody would ever believe that Black was innocent.
The Minister had arranged that I could stay at the Leaky Cauldron for the rest of the holiday, but Draco’s mom and Mrs Tonks wrote back to the Minister, telling him that I would stay with the Tonks family until term starts. They were very worried about my safety. Saying it was irresponsible to leave a thirteen-year stay alone at an inn. Especially with Sirius Black on the loose. Nobody wants to explain to me why I would be in danger of a criminal that was arrested when I was just a baby. The only thing Draco and I found out until now is that Sirius Black used to be friends with you, dad. Draco’s mom let that slip before Mrs Tonks shut her up, saying it was not important and that it was nothing we should worry about.
Harry knows this. He wants to have fun. But it’s hard. He just misses Draco so much. And not hearing from him. Harry gets that his parents don’t want Draco to visit Harry. But sure he’s allowed to send letters. There is nothing wrong with letters, is there?
“What?” Ron asks in surprise at the same time as Hermione looks at Harry.
I took off alone, past the giant snakeskin. The tunnel turned and turned and I was afraid I would never reach Draco in time. And even if I did, how was I going to save him? I had no skills to fight a Basilisk of even the person that had taken Draco. I’m just a mediocre wizard, I have no extraordinary skills.
Love you both,
But first I had to get on the train, and I can tell you that never happened. Don’t worry, I made it to Hogwarts thanks to Ron’s stupid plan, but I’m here and still getting my education. It all started with the chaos of having six children getting ready to leave for the entire school year. We got up extremely early and still managed to only arrive at King Cross minutes before the train was leaving. We hurried to the barrier between platforms nine and ten and the Weasleys started to go through. First Percy, then Mr Weasley, the twin, Mrs Weasley and Ginny. They went through without any problems, vanishing as you would expect.
Dobby disappeared with a loud crack and Draco slumped back into bed, his watery grey eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing. I couldn’t look away from him, he looked sad and lost. Maybe he does still care about me.
Ron opens his mouth the answer, only the door to the Great Hall opens before he gets a chance.
Draco wants to tell Harry that he shouldn’t, that he’s an idiot for loving him. But instead, he just drops his head and keeps silent. Harry won’t hear him, he never has and he never will when it comes to this.
“Sure, not crazy at all. He just never says a word. And then they call Luna loony,” Ginny replies.
“You are wanted by the headmaster,” Professor Snape answers.
“Nothing, Ron. We need to go,” Hermione says. She stands up and drags Harry with her. They are out of the portrait hole before Ron can object. Hermione leads them out of the castle before she asks Harry what happened.
Harry knows that Malfoy studies in the library from time to time. Hermione loves to drag Harry to the library in the hope Harry will focus on his homework for once. The last couple of times Harry has spotted Malfoy there. Always at the same table. It didn’t help Hermione’s plan to get Harry to study. Normally he already is bound to find ways to do as little for school as possible. And there are always people that want to talk to him. About the upcoming Quidditch match against Slytherin or other non-school-related stuff. And now Harry has an extra reason to be distracted. He can watch Malfoy in the library and figure out how to make him talk to Harry. And today, Harry has figured out the perfect plot. He’ll join Malfoy in the library and study with him, no matter if Malfoy likes it or not.
Harry James Potter.
Hermione shakes her head and dishes some potatoes on her plate. “You’re disgusting, Ron,” she says.
“My brother. The ‘Boy Who Lived’. Have you seen him?” Harry says with narrowed eyes. How can they not know who Neville is? The entire school knows Neville. He’s a celebrity. A dead celebrity if Harry doesn’t find him soon.
“Draco, wait,” he shouts.
Harry James Potter
“If that was the case, Teddy would have kept us up all night,” Draco says.
“I’m truly sorry,” Hermione repeats. Tears well up in her eyes and Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t want to upset her. She should be happy and glowing. Draco knows the feeling, wishes every night that he could get that feeling back. He was an idiot to think that once he would stop with the birth control potion, he would be pregnant straight away. It’s only been three months. The average time for someone of his age to fall pregnant is five to six months. There is nothing to worry about. Their time will come. Draco just needs to be patient. And stop thinking about the baby he’d already lost.
Time stretches on. The only sounds heard are Draco’s sobs and the clock ticking in the corner. If only they could go back in time. To a time before the Dark Lord returned. When Draco would cry over a scraped knee or a missing toy. All that was better than the reason he cries now. Those were pains his mother could heal. This pain will never go away.
Harry laughs. “She has a point,” he says.
“Yeah,” Harry says. He hangs back on his chair. “Now that Hufflepuff has beaten Slytherin, we have a chance of winning the cup again. Wood wants to analyse the Hufflepuffs game, to see how we can beat them.”
“Mr Potter was found holding Mr Malfoy’s body. He cradled him, as you cradle someone you love,” Ron says. “He was crying when I arrested him. The only hesitation he had was when he had to let go of Mr Malfoy’s body. Other than that, he came willingly.”
“I’m happy for you,” Neville says.
Then we were moved to a differed memory. This one was the trial of Ludo Bagman. He was found guilty for passing information to Lord Voldemort’s supporters. Mr Crouch wanted to send him to Azkaban, but the crowd protested and they brought it to a vote. Nobody voted for imprisonment, they even complimented him on his win with Quidditch. Draco muttered that it was a disgrace, that Mr Bagman got away with his crimes just because he was a famous Quidditch player. I told Draco he could do the same once he became the star player for the English team. But Draco answered that he would never help the Dark Lord and therefore would never need to be acquitted.
Iris smiles, gets up and walks over to the Ravenclaw table. She waves towards Harry and Neville and then sits down between her new housemates. Harry slumps in his seat and stares at the Ravenclaw table. “She can’t be,” he whispers.
“You have your own sweaters,” Harry once complained.
“Of course you can. She’s just a baby who wants to meet her uncle Draco,” Hermione tells him. Draco looks at Harry on the other side of the bed. He hopes he’ll take Rose instead. Draco doesn’t know if he can keep the fake smile on his face in place if he has to hold the little one.
“He’s more understanding than you give him credit for. And I hate lying to him. He thinks you’re hung up on Cedric,” Hermione says.
Hagrid showed us some shining silvery stuff on the ground. It was unicorn blood, meaning a unicorn was hurt and we had to go look for it. He said he found a dead unicorn last weekend. Draco was afraid that whatever had killed the unicorn would find us first. But Hagrid said we would be fine if we were with him or Fang. We were split into two groups. I was going with Draco and Fang, while Hermione and Nott went with Hagrid.
Our last exam was History of Magic and I was grateful for all the time I had spent studying with Hermione and her call cards because I remember most of the dates and everything about the battles and rebellions we had discussed this year in class. I was really looking forward to the week off after the exams, two weeks of them is hard. So I cheered with everyone else when Professor Binns told us to put down our quills.
“Okay, yes, we can do that. Right, Draco?” Harry asks.
“GET OUT!” Draco yells. How dare she turn this around. Pansy never needed Draco. She just liked to use him whenever she’d screwed up. And Draco is sick of it. Of all of it. He’s been nothing but a friend to Pansy in all the years they’ve known each other. And now she’s done the worst thing possible, getting pregnant just to show that she can have what Draco isn’t capable of.
Remus chuckles. “He’s okay. Professor Snape has him.”
Cedric and I both went our separate ways again. And I know I ran into a Sphinx and that he had a riddle I had to solve, but I can’t remember what the riddle was any more or how I solved it. I only know that I did and that the Sphinx let me pass. And when I took the corner I could see the Cup. I started running towards it until I saw Cedric come out of a path further ahead. I knew I would never be able to catch up to him, with his long legs. I stopped in my tracks and just stared at Cedric getting closer to the cup.
“I know,” he says instead. “About all that. It isn’t like you said. I don’t do like boys and girls. It’s just boys. Only boys,” Harry stammers.
“I know, love. Just be glad you didn’t share a house with those two for over a year. I was afraid to eat from my dining table.”
“You can tell me them too, you know that right,” Ron says. Harry feels a little guilty for shutting Ron out, but he’s pretty sure that Ron won’t be so understanding when he finds out that Malfoy is part of the gay panic he just had.
“How much information about werewolves did you find?” Ron asks.
James snorts. “Oh my,” he says. “So you’re in love with a boy who wants to date girls, and Neville is falling for a girl who wants to date girls. What did I do wrong? Where did I fail as your parent?”
“What’s going on?” Harry says. He notices that Malfoy shakes beside him and without thinking, Harry pulls him even closer and keeps his arm around his shoulders.
“Think you’re wrong there,” Neville says.
Neville, Hermione and Ron noticed. They shake their heads and whisper among each other when they think Harry isn’t paying them any attention. But they don’t say a word to Harry, or tell him to stop. And Harry kind of loves them for that. They know him well enough to know that this is just something Harry needs to do.
“You’re drunk, Pansy,” Draco tells her.
“I know he’s got Greengrass now,” Harry says. “The perfect pure-blood witch to marry and make his father happy.”
Love you,
“His name is Draco,” Harry says. He feels tiny all of the sudden. He shouldn’t have told his dad about his crush. He knew it wasn’t going to go over well. And it’s never going to go anywhere anyway, so it doesn’t even matter.
Dear mom and dad,
‘Doing my homework. And you?’ Harry writes. With a grin, he pushes the note back to Malfoy.
Harry looks up at him and shakes his head. “Don’t. Please don’t. This is not your fault.”
“Sure, go ahead,” Harry tells him without looking up from his homework.
Tuesday 22 September 1992
Harry takes a better hold of his broom and points it upwards. The Snitch goes into the cloud and Harry follows it. Cold rain slashes against his face, but Harry doesn’t take his eyes off the Snitch. It’s so close. Harry stretches out his arm and speeds up a little more.
Some older Slytherin students made me leave the Slytherin table in the great hall this morning, saying I should go hang out with my Gryffindor friends since I was only planning on shaming my house. I hope they won’t do anything worse to me, like what Nott and Crabbe had done to me in March. My eye has healed mostly by the way. I did need new subscriptions for my glasses because my eye is a little worse than before. But I can see everything just fine with my new glasses.
That night Draco had woken up in sweats, the screams still hunting him. He wondered what the potion had been his father had made. He moved from his bed and down the stairs, hoping he wouldn’t wake up his parents. He made it into the dungeon and opened the forbidden door on the right. The potion was still admitting smoke into the room. Draco looked at the bubbles and smiled. The potion was a beautiful green, similar to his bedding upstairs. For a moment Draco wanted to touch the potion, see if it was truly as hot as it looks. But he remembered the woman’s screams and shook his head. He turned and walked to the side his father had disappeared to that afternoon. At the end of the room was another door, one made of bars instead of wood. Behind the bars sat a man, shaking and crying in front of a pile of bones.
“You can, you’re much stronger than me,” Harry says. Draco doesn’t understand where Harry’s confidence comes from. Doesn’t he know that Draco is a coward? That if it wasn’t for his friendship with Harry, Draco would never even thought about going against his father, against his family, against the Dark Lord.
I didn’t really look where I was going and walked straight into Hagrid when I turned around a corridor on my way back to Myrtle’s bathroom. He was on his way to the headmaster to get permission to put a charm around the hen coop since something was killing the roosters. It was either foxes or a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, whatever that may be. And then Hagrid took another look at me and could see that I was crying. He asked me again if I was sure that I was alright. I quickly pulled the sleeve of my rope over my eyes and told him it was nothing and that I had to get my books for my Defence Against the Dark Arts class I had next.
Draco was still waiting for me in the Great Hall when Cedric and I left the small room. Draco took me in his arms as soon as I was through the door. Cedric hovered a little around us. He asked me how I’d gotten my name in. Draco told him to get lost if he was stupid enough to think Harry wanted to compete in the stupid tournament.
Not that it matters anymore. None of it does. Not since the moment they took him. Not when Harry found out he was too late.
And you will never believe what I found under my sheets. Neatly folded with a note on it saying: just in case. It was my invisibility cloak. I was so happy to have it back. That and the fact that Draco is talking to me again make everything just a little easier. We are still scared about Voldemort coming back and I’m still going crazy from all the studying, but Draco is helping me again. He also noticed that Nott was hitting me again and he now makes sure I’m never alone in the dormitory. We study together almost all the time. Hermione said she misses me, so I told Draco I’ll have to go study with her tomorrow. But for now, we are just hanging on Draco’s bed trying to remember the names of Jupiter’s moon and all the other stuff we need to know for our exams. They will start in two weeks, so I probably won’t write again until after.
“I know,” Harry answers. He looks away, and Draco knows he’s scared. Healer Burke is aware of Draco’s past, and still, she prescribed the stupid things. It only means today is going to be hell for Draco, and for Harry, who will have to watch helplessly.
It’s really cool to learn about magic, even though I’m not always that good at everything. Flying is the only thing that comes naturally and I really enjoy it. It’s a shame the lessons will end when Christmas break starts. I will miss sweeping through the air.
It was the week before exams would start when Draco figured it out. I had told him that I had heard a voice saying it was going to kill before all of the attacks. And he knows that Hermione was carrying around a mirror when she got petrified. The monster of Slytherin was a Basilisk. That was why I could only hear the voice. I’m the only one we know in this school that understands Parseltongue. A Basilisk kills you instantly with the stare of his eyes, but none of the victims had looked it straight in the eye. Hermione had used the mirror, Colin saw it through his camera, Justin was looking through Nearly Headless Nick and Mrs Norris had only seen the Basilisk reflection in the water that had been on the floor. That’s why none of them had died.
“It might. Maybe there is a simple cause to why we are struggling. And if they can find that and fix it. Isn’t it worth a shot?”
“Neville, please drop it,” Harry says. He can’t do this. He won’t cry in front of his brother again. No matter how much it hurts, Harry will forget about Draco. He has to. He picks up the newspaper and goes over the article again. “Do you know where this street is they mention?” he asks.
Dinner was good and we were all in a happy mood until Headmaster Dumbledore gave the direst news of the evening. There will be no Quidditch Cup this year! No flying on brooms and practice twice a week with our team members. We looked at Adrian and Miles and they looked just as shocked as us, unable to believe that we won’t be continuing our winning streak this year. I was looking forward to it, seeing how well Draco would do as our new captain now that Marcus had left.
Draco is here, at Grimmauld Place. Officially he’s staying with his aunt and uncle, the Tonks. You remember, they were the once that took me in before third year started and I had run away from the Dursleys. His mother had arranged it all, to make sure Draco is safe. Mr and Mrs Tonks were at the train station, only Draco refused to go with them. He wouldn’t leave me, so he came home with me. He’s still here. I think he’s scared that if he loses sight of me, something bad will happen again.
“Do you want to order some pizza? We kind of skipped the dinner part, and I don’t feel like cooking anything,” Harry says. Draco lifts his head and sits up a little straighter.
I lighted my wand with a Lumos and told Ron and Professor Lockhart that they should close their eyes at the first sign of movement. Ron asked why and I told him about the Basilisk and how it could kill him with his eyes. We moved forward and discovered that the entire floor was littered with small animal bones. I struggled to not imagine what Draco might look like if we found him, what if the Basilisk had eaten him and there would only be bones left.
“You don’t have to,” Harry continues. “I just worry about you. I know you haven’t been feeling well lately.”
“I’m sure he will explain. Now hurry up, we don’t have all day,” the professor snaps. It seems he’s in a bad mood again and even though Draco wants to ask a million more questions, he knows when to keep his mouth shut around his head of house.
Only Harry doesn't comply. He slides out of Draco and lays down next to him. His hand strokes Draco's back again, only not like before when he was admiring Draco's body. Now it's a gentle stroke, filled with compassion and love. A stroke that Draco doesn’t deserve.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry doesn’t respond. He’s busy reading the friendly words of his uncle. Harry hadn’t told him about Malfoy, but of course, Remus has told Sirius. And now Sirius is offering his help. Sirius says he has his doubts, the boy is a Malfoy of course. But he knows Harry and what he’s like when he’s set his mind to something. He gives tips for some helpful books to get from the library to help with the      communication problems. And if the library doesn’t have the books, Harry should let him know and he will send them along with Remus as Sirius owns them all.
As soon as Dobby was gone, Draco fell back on his backside and hit his face in his hands. He was trembling and crying so I sat down next to him and pulled him in my arms. We just stayed like that for a while until Draco lifted his head and looked into my eyes. And I know I shouldn’t find it beautiful when his eyes are all red and wet from crying, but I do, mom. I could look into his eyes all day long if I had the change.
Harry can’t help but grin at that. They both know that Harry is more like James than either of them will ever admit.
Sometime later, Hermione calmed down a bit and we strolled around. And then we overheard a conversation between Hagrid and Madame Maxime. It turns out that Hagrid is half-giant and when he asked Madame Maxime if she was too, she got really angry. Draco later explained that it’s a shameful thing, being part creature. Just another thing the wizarding world is stupid and short-minded. And giants are also seen as vicious and violent creatures that like to kill. So we all agreed to keep Hagrid’s secret and not tell anyone else.
Harry shakes his head. “The greenhouses are too light. And how would he get there during the day? No, we need to figure out which student never makes it to Herbology to find out who the vampire is.”
Harry looks at Draco who’s turned back to his homework. He never minds that he can’t follow any of them. He loves the silence. Harry has learnt that by now. But still, it would be great if all their friends would be able to communicate with him without the need for translators or pieces of parchment. But that doesn’t change anything to the fact that Draco will be all alone this Christmas. Harry doesn’t think any Slytherin ever stays over at Hogwarts during Christmas. It will be so depressing. Harry can’t stand it. He has to make sure that Draco has a good Christmas, one he will enjoy.
Harry James Potter.
Draco is glad for the out. He can’t go and see Pansy and her new baby boy. She’s better off without him anyway. The only thing Draco is good for is hurting others. First by choice, and now because it’s all he’s good for. If only Harry could see that. He should leave and take Teddy with him. Draco will only be able to damage their boy. And Teddy will hate him for it in the end, Draco is sure of it.
Draco can only nod his head and then the tears break free. He covers his face with his hands and tries to roll away from his mother. Narcissa won’t let him. She puts her arms around Draco and pulls him in a sitting position. Then she lets him rest against her chest. In the same way, Draco had comforted Harry from time to time in the past year.
Love Harry James Potter
Hermione slaps Harry on his arm. “Don’t be mean. I’m not a drama queen,” she says.
‘You want to come to my place for Christmas?’ Harry writes. He places the parchment on the book Draco is reading. Draco looks up and raises his eyebrows.
“Sweetheart, Hermione says a shower might help. She likes to take long hot showers when she struggles with menstruation pains. So if you want we can see if it helps.”
“But Pettigrew got away,” Harry says.
"But he won't, Harry. You've got to believe that." Ron says with a certainty Harry wishes he’d had himself.
But it hadn’t been the only time Harry had found him in tears. Or screaming at him or their children. And Harry could deal with being the one that got yelled at. But seeing Lily burst into tears because she made daddy mad, or have Teddy declare he’ll move back to his grandmother if Draco wouldn’t leave him alone, had hurt. But Harry doesn’t know what to do about it. He tried to tell Draco to keep it together around the kids, only to have the man fall apart in front of him. Harry doesn’t want to hear Draco say that he thinks he isn’t fit to be a farther, to raise their children, because Harry can’t think of anyone that would be better qualified than Draco. The man that gave up his job to become a full-time dad because he didn’t want them to be raised by nannies or house-elves. The man who braved modern technology and discovered YouTube so he could learn how to braid their daughter's hair. The man that gets up before dawn, so he can go watch the sunrise together with Teddy because the boy wanted to see it so badly.
Next stop was Flourish and Blotts to get our new books. Here we met up with Hermione after Draco and I had words for the first time. I found out he added an extra class to his schedule, namely Care of Magical Creatures. The idiot did it because he knew I wanted to have all my classes with him. The fact that he’s terrified of Magical Creatures makes this the worst decision he ever made, even worse than ignoring me for almost an entire year. I told him he was stupid and he threw back that he did it for me. I don’t want him to do things like that for me. I know it is because he still worries about me. I think he’s still scared that if my life isn’t perfect I’ll do something stupid. I hate myself for giving him that fear.
Chapters 32-48 - 3rd year
But back to the point. I asked Professor Lupin if he could help me with the Dementors. I remember that Draco told me that Professor Lupin made the Dementor on the train go away. The professor promised he’ll try to teach me some defences next term. He’s really busy right now. He’s been ill and has a lot of work to catch up to.
“He doesn’t want anyone to know,” Harry says. He looks around again, but there seems to be no other students in sight. This part of the library hardly ever gets used.
‘Don’t be an idiot,’ the note says. ‘You never do your homework in the library. What do you want from me?’
“Do we have any of these books?” Harry asks as he holds out the letter.
I’d also written a letter to Sirius about it all. He wasn’t very impressed with me, taking off with Viktor in the middle of the night. I had to return him a promise that I won’t go wandering around at night and that I make sure I keep myself safe. He told me again that my name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident and that the person responsible is on their last chance of attacking me. He told me to go and practice stunning and disarming spells. And maybe some hexes. His message was clear, focus on the third task and forget all the crazy business with Mr Crouch. He told me again to trust Dumbledore and Professor Moody, and asked me please to not break any more school rules and to keep myself safe.
“Harry, it’s okay,” Remus says in a gentle voice. “We know now. And we will help Malfoy as much as possible. But he has to want it. We can’t make decisions for him.”
“But that is not what you are concerned about, is it?” Remus asks.
I could hear the Basilisk’s heavy body slithering across the floor. I kept my eyes shut and began to run blindly sideways, keeping my hands stretched out. Voldemort was laughing when I tripped. Something heavy hit me then and I was smashed into a wall. I was sure the next thing I would feel were some fangs biting me and killing me. But that never happened. I could hear mad hissing and something thrashing wildly off the pillars. And I couldn’t help myself; I had to take a look. And you will never believe what I saw. Fawkes had punctured the Basilisks eyes.
“Harry, you are allowed to help Malfoy if he wants your help,” Hermione says. “Why don’t you want me to tell Ron and Neville? Do you truly believe they will object to you helping him?”
I just hope I can manage it before Saturday. I would hate to not have a game plan when I have to face that dragon.
And that’s when everything started to go wrong. Draco didn’t come back. I kept looking at the clock, watching time slip by and still no Draco. I could feel that something was wrong, that Draco was upset. I checked the Marauders Map, but couldn’t find Draco on it anywhere. And even though it was already past curfew I still went to see Professor Snape. He was the one that had wanted to see Draco. Maybe Draco was still there. But when I arrived at Professor Snape’s office Draco wasn’t there. Professor Snape told me to go back to bed, that there was nothing to worry about and that I would need my rest. And I tried to get some sleep, only the bed was so empty with just me in it. I tossed and turned until I couldn’t stand it anymore. Draco was missing and nobody seemed to care.
“Ron assures me they never did it on our dining table, so please can we keep it?” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear.
The Dementor doesn’t pay any attention to Harry. And Harry can’t do anything to stop it. He can only watch as Malfoy’s face is lifted off his legs and held by the Dementor.
I even ignored the fact that I heard professor Quirrell whimpering in a classroom on my way back to the dungeon after a study session with Hermione. It sounded as someone was threatening him. And when Quirrell hurried out of the room he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. I’m sure Snape had been the one threatening him and had finally gotten what he wanted. I told Hermione and she reminded me that Snape doesn’t know how to get past Fluffy, but I’m sure that’s just a matter of time.
“Don’t worry, she says,” Ron shouts back. “You got kidnapped by the Merfolk, and you tell me not to worry.”
The day before Christmas I visited the owlery, in the hope Hedwig would speak to me again. She has been upset with me ever since the car trip to Hogwarts. Hermione has been feeding her for me. But it seems Hedwig has forgiven me. She was nibbling on my ear in an affectionate way while I gave her some threats. I told her I had missed her and that I was sorry. She squeaked happily and I was glad I had visited her. After that, I went to the library and started on my homework, in the hope that Nott and Crabbe won’t find me there. And they didn’t, so Thursday was an okay day.
I have to go now and get ready for astronomy at midnight. I promise to write sooner again.
‘Don’t care,’ Draco writes. ‘You want to get better at Potions, then you need to read this.’
Draco drinks every last drop of blood from Harry’s body. His love had died a couple of minutes ago. His blood has been the best Draco ever tasted. He turns Harry’s body around and lays him carefully on the pillows. He rests his head on Harry’s chest and waits for him to wake. He’ll be back with Draco before the sun will rise tonight. Draco also woke up just before sunrise, in the arms of his lover after losing his virginity on a new moon. Draco had spiked Harry’s wine with his own blood to make sure he would turn. Hours pass and nothing happens. Harry’s body stays still and unresponsive. The sun starts to rise in the distant. Draco knows he should move, that he should put his clothes back on and make his way inside. He knows it didn’t work, that Harry won’t come back to him. He closes his eyes and lays back down on Harry’s chest.
Only that also never happened. The Dark Lord sits, eats and talks to his Death Eaters. He never contradicts the lies that are told about Draco. He keeps up the ruse that Draco killed Harry Potter, that it was intentional and not an accident. If only Draco knew why. Maybe then all this would make sense. Maybe then he can prepare for the years to come. For the life he never wanted. The life he choose to fight against. On that faithful day, when everything changed for the entire world.
“Shut up, Ginny,” Neville tells her. “Just hold on a second.”
I was more impressed by the Durmstrang group. They arrived in a ship that rose out of the water. Their headmaster is professor Karkaroff. Draco knows who he is. I’ll tell you about him just now. He has a goatee that finishes into a small curl. I think it looks ridiculous. But that was not the great part. Among the students of Durmstrang is a very special person, namely Victor Krum, the star Quidditch player from Bulgaria. And to our great pleasure, he sat down in Great Hall right next to our little group. Draco told him we’d seen him at the World Cup and that it is an honour to have him at our school. Krum was very kind and thanked Draco for his compliment. And then Greg said he’d love to see a Seeker game between me and Krum, but Krum kindly declined, saying something like he was only here to compete in the TriWizard tournament, and not to play Quidditch.
After our talk, I collected the book from the floor that had been thrown at Myrtle and I recognised it directly. It was the little book I have seen Draco write in this year on several occasions. I thought it was his diary and I didn’t understand why he would throw it away. Only the year on the diary wasn’t 1992 or even 1993, no the diary was fifty years old. And that just made no sense so I opened the diary to look inside, but all the pages were completely blank. There was only a name on the first page in smudged ink. The diary had belonged to someone named T. M. Riddle. And when I looked at the back of the diary I found out it was from a store on Vauxhall Road in London. And that made even less sense. Why would Draco have a diary that’s fifty years old, that was bought from a Muggle shop and used to belong to a T. M. Riddle. And why would he want to get rid of it, when it was clear nobody ever wrote anything in it. But that wasn’t right either, because I’ve seen Draco write in it.
Draco looks up into Harry’s eyes. He nods while the tears start streaming again. He can’t seem to stop crying. Harry pulls him against his side and pusses Draco’s head onto his shoulder with his free hand. “It’s okay, sweetheart,” Harry whispers. Draco wants to scream at him that it isn’t, that everything is wrong. Hermione and Ron are coming over for dinner tonight, and instead of telling them that Draco is pregnant, they have to say to them that Draco wasn’t good enough to have a baby. That he wasn’t able to keep Harry’s baby safe.
Harry raises his eyebrows.
The staring started after our fourth flying lesson. I was just spinning around on my broom, it was good fun. I teased Hermione a little, who still struggles to stay upright in the air. I don’t think she likes flying that much. She’s much better in charms and transfiguration. Oh and she’s brilliant when it comes to history of magic, she seems to know all the names and dates and she really is a big help with my essays. It’s a shame the others have started teasing her as well. It’s not as bad as with me, but they keep asking her if she likes being the poof’s girlfriend. And with the poof they mean me. And the Gryffindor’s aren’t much better. Ron just glares at her every time she knows the right answers in class or when she’s the first one to master a spell or charm. She’s the best in every class, except for potions, where Malfoy beats her every time.
“No, you can think it over, and when you come back next week for the second scan we can go over it all again, and you can decide what you want then.”
“Here you go,” he says with a grin on his face.
“Fuck you, Draco. I will never be better off without you,” he spits out.
“She’s just worried, as always,” Ron says. “She means well.”
Harry picks up his presents and opens it quickly. “It’s perfect,” he says. He opens the book and starts paging through it.
It is really nice being here, and I’ve been writing with Hermione for the last two weeks, but there is one thing that is still upsetting me. I’ve written a letter to Draco, telling him I miss him and asking if he is okay, but I haven’t heard back from him. Ron doesn’t really get why that upsets me so much. What else had I expected from a stuck up Slytherin? I told Ron that I was also a Slytherin, but he said that I was different and that I was also half Gryffindor since I spend most of my time hanging out with Gryffindors.
“Morning,” a sleepy voice says next to Draco. A soft kiss is placed on Draco’s cheek and he smiles. What will Harry think if he knew what was going on inside Draco’s head right now? Nathan is only four months old. Draco hasn’t even been able to get his old shape back. He’s going to be a fat stay at home dad if he continues like this. Draco turns to look at Harry.
Harry puts his book down and strokes his hand over Draco's back. He leans over and places a kiss on Draco's neck, just below his hairline. Draco used to love it when Harry would do that before sex became a necessary evil. Now it’s just a reminder of how big a failure Draco has become. He doesn’t want this to last. He just wants Harry to dump his sperm inside him. What does it matter if Draco enjoys it or not?
Harry swallows and plays with the whisk. "Yeah, he's…" Harry wavers, the word that just popped into his head scares him. The last time Harry saw a depressed Draco was when Draco was fighting his potion addiction.
“They are off on another private conversation,” Ron complains as Draco pinches his lips together and shakes his index and middle finger twice.
Fourth-year starts with the Quidditch World Cup and the disappointment of no Quidditch at Hogwarts this year. But it brings the Triwizard Cup, where Harry somehow turns into one of the champions. How will he and Draco deal with all the attention it puts on them? And how long can Sirius sit back and let all this happen to Harry?
“I’ll be fine,” Draco stutters between his tears. “Go back to Teddy.”
Viktor promised to look after him while I got the headmaster. I ran back to the castle and up the stairs towards the headmaster's office. And just when I reached the stone gargoyle it opened and professor Snape stepped out. He wanted to know what I was doing there and I told him all about how Viktor and I found Mr Crouch in the forest and that he looked mad and wanted to talk to the headmaster. Professor Snape told me to calm down and explain myself clearly. So I took a deep breath and told Snape all about Mr Crouch. And just when Professor Snape said we should get headmaster Dumbledore the gargoyle moved again. The headmaster stepped out and as soon as Professor Snape told him I found Mr Crouch we all set off towards the forest.
Hermione was waiting for me when I knocked on the frame of the fat lady, to let her know I was there. We had to wait for Peeves to get of our way in the entrance hall, where he was playing tennis against the wall, so we were running late. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate, saying he had packed it’s teddy bear in case he would get lonely. We covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and somehow managed to get back to the castle and up all the staircases until we reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
The pain is indescribable.
“I fucking know that! If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have defended your behaviour. I wouldn’t have convinced Harry to let you stay here every time you screw up. You know that he only puts up with you because you are my friend. He thinks you’re spoilt and selfish. And I finally see how right he is.”
“Why?” Harry asks. “We’re just friends. Nothing is going to happen.”
‘I would love that,’ Draco writes. ‘You don’t mind if I spend some more time with him?’
They had been together for eighteen years, two months and four days when Draco disappeared.
Hermione stands up. Her hands shake a little. “Harry James Potter, you are charged for abating Draco Lucius Malfoy’s escape from prison. How do you plea?”
Harry rolls his eyes but says yes anyway. Iris’ eyes are red and Harry never meant to make her worry. Neville pulls her back a little so that Harry can look around him. Hermione and Ron stand at the end of the bed. Ron’s face is redder than usual and Harry is glad Ron at least feels a little bad about wanting to rush off to dinner. And then someone on his other side moves. Harry turns his head and then has to close his eyes when the world starts to spin.
“They are from the shop, grandma.”
“Use your reflexes, Ron,” Harry shouts back at the same time as Neville picks up some snow and throws it at Hermione.
Harry’s hand cups Draco’s face. His finger strokes over the skin like it’s made of porcelain. “Then there are other options we can look into. Dean said they might adopt in the future, and Hermione showed me some leaflets about surrogates.”
Hermione’s teeth are smaller now then they were before Nott made them grow with his stupid spell. She said that madam Pomfrey gave her a mirror when she shrunk Hermione’s teeth and that she told Hermione to tell her when they were back to there normal size. And Hermione just let them become a little less long then they used to be. I know she had been trying to convince her parents for ages to have them shrunk a little, and I’m glad she finally got what she wanted. She’s just a little upset that Ron hasn’t noticed yet. But Draco saved the day for him, by saying that it’s a good thing, that it means that Ron always thought that Hermione was beautiful.
There are so many things wrong with that statement. Harry wants to tell Malfoy, but he doesn’t think it will help his cause. He can’t push Malfoy away now. He’s just opening up. Harry has to hold on to that.
“Good plan,” Draco tells him and they both laugh.
Dear mom and dad,
“Fine,” Pansy snaps. “You could make that easier if you didn’t bring him up, like all the time.”
“Maybe. But you can still talk to him,” Remus says. “We haven’t done anything yet. And I can wait until you have discussed it with Malfoy before I talk to professor Flitwick, if you want.”
I hate what happened next. Voldemort spoke to the person next to Wormtail. He called him Lucius and I knew it was Draco’s father that was standing there. At the moment it was clear that Draco just lost his home. Voldemort wasn’t happy with Draco’s father. Said it was a disgrace how he couldn’t even control his son and teach him the ways of a true wizard. And Draco’s father said he was sorry, and that he won’t disappoint the Dark Lord again, that he would teach his son to obey. I have no idea how I’m going to tell this to Draco. I won’t let him go home this summer, I’m sure I will never see him again if I do. Draco will never betray me, and I’m afraid his father will kill him for that.
After a while, the headmaster came back with professor Snape and the Minister. Draco releases the recording from his wand and we could all see and hear how Scabbers turns into Peter Pettigrew and how he confesses to being the spy and framing Black. The Minister looked shocked and he kept shaking his head. I just rested my head on Draco’s shoulder and made a note to myself to never mistrust him again. Not only did he stop me from killing my own godfather, but he also saved him from a faith worse than death.
The next thing I remember is waking up when the train was moving again. The lanterns had come back on and I lay on the seat. Draco was knelt next to the seat, his hand brushing through my hair. I felt really sick and was glad I was laying down. Draco asked me if I was alright and I told him I was fine. I asked what happened and what that thing was. And finally, I asked who screamed. Draco told me that nobody screamed. I stuttered that I heard someone screaming. Draco looked at me with his worried face and kept petting my hair.
“What did he say?” Ron asks.
Dear mom and dad,
Harry stares at the Hufflepuffs. Do they truly believe this is funny? And why haven’t they checked on Neville? The only thing they do is just stand there and laugh. Hufflepuffs are the worst.
“We brought you a little gift,” Harry tells her. Draco holds the wrapped packages he’d been holding up for Hermione to see.
Back in the common room, I spend half the night speculating with Draco, Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Millicent about what happened to Mr Crouch and what was wrong with him. Draco said it looked like he was under the imperious curse and was fighting it to warn us about Voldemort. All I know is that we hardly had any sleep that night and that I fell asleep on Draco’s shoulder during History of Magic the next day.
