With all that is going on in the world at the moment I debated with myself if I should write and post fanfiction. There are more important things after all. But I decided that the world needs distractions I hope that this helped someone to smile at least a little.
“Wingardium Leviosa…” Pansy said with as much confidence as she could muster pointing the tip of her wind at the blue feather in front of her. The feather twitched for a moment and then fell back onto the desk. It didn’t seem like much in her opinion, but Flitwick seemed to be delighted.
“Yes, sir” Harry swallowed again before there was a sound of a voice clearing which sounded like a sniffing. He looked to the right of Tobias and saw a woman dressed in a bright pink outfit. She looked like a toad wearing a string of pearls wrapped around her throat.
“So, do you…Um…”
“Go-Good mor-Morning...” Harry stammered in the cute way he did his face turning the most delightful shade of red. Pansy was right, not something he would ever openly admit it to her face, but Harry really was like a doll with his fragile features and his mannerisms. It made him want to squish him in a hug every time he saw him.
“Nope, your eyes are beautiful, they are a unique shade of green but not unpleasant at all. It’s like a spring green” Draco hummed honestly, looking into those eyes that were hidden by the ugly glasses. Harry gave him an almost shy smile his cheeks a bright pink as he whispered;
“Please, just call me Chuck” The teacher said his voice higher than he probably wanted it to be and he quickly cleared his throat with a cough. “Um…Mr Shurley is too formal”
“I have no intention of letting this out, the boy will have enough difficulties next year without the entire school knowing of his troubles”
“Actually, pushing something? Or being pushed?” Nino hummed her head cocking lightly to one side as her honey brown eyes searched his. Harry realised, not for the first time, that she was short even for a woman not quite the same height as goblin but no where near as tall as Narcissia. She reminded him almost of the elves that he had seen in children’s books at school near Christmas time. He flushed a little and then answered in a whisper
“Oh, I though perhaps you would care to introduce your quests, Severus? After all you seem to be causing quite the stir?” The woman said not in the least put out by Severus’ tone. Her accent was thick with a Scottish twang, something that Harry had heard only in movies before and he nervously hopped from one foot to the other suddenly aware that they were the centre of attention. Almost all the school were staring in confusion. The only ones who weren’t were the students that he had met at various meetings within Malfoy Manor, they were giving them friendly waves while whispering to their friends clearly informing those that didn’t know that he was Snape’s son.
“Are you sure about this Harry?”
“I should hope so, I’ve been playing since I was five” Draco shrugged attempting for nonchalant, but he couldn’t hide the way his ears flushed a bright red and the way his chest puffed up. Harry’s mouth dropped open, he’d known that Draco had started early but he never imagined that it would be that young and he spluttered
“Thank-you” Harry said flashing her another weak smile before he heard a laugh from the female...auror....hat had come with them. She was wearing purple robes with an insignia on the breast rather like a muggle policeman and Harry wondered if that was what she was.
“Its just a friendly but the Honeysuckle Hummingbirds really are Japans best team and they only have one male. The keeper. Almost all are in the Japanese national team though the seeker is from Thailand” Draco commented stepping into the fire with Harry and taking enough Floo powder for them both before shouting “The Rose Stadium, Green Entrance, Ireland!”
“I’m reading through the potions book that Draco sent me...” He answered sheepishly and Mrs Figg smiled nodding as she pottered over to the chair and eased herself into it. “Were you sad? When you found out that you couldn’t use magic?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course, Uncle Rem! I would be honoured” Draco puffed out his chest in pride the tips of his ears and his cheeks colouring with spots of pink while Harry got up from the table and came around to them. Without a word the young black-haired boy wrapped his arms securely around them both and hugged them.
Anyway Pansy was meant to appear in this part but Narcissa took over >.<
“Well done, Dray, try again, knock that dummy out!” Nino shouted clapping her chunky hands and Draco puffed up like a Peacock focusing his attention on the dummy again thin beads of sweat appearing on his brow. “So, all of the times your magic has only manifested when you have been upset and angry? It’s not uncommon, heightened emotions are triggers for accidental magic. You have had to deal with a lot, Harry, more than I could possibly know and now you are happy. Your magic doesn’t feel the need to come out and protect you and that’s fine. It’s a good thing, it will learn to adjust to coming out when you’re happy. Draco hasn’t needed that that’s why his magic is freer…I’m guessing your family hated magic?”
“I think...I mean, I’m almost positive that I can talk to them...I...” Harry’s voice became even softer as he looked down at the shoes Narcissa had just brought for him. Draco almost let out an undignified and ungentlemanly squeak. His eyes widened for a moment his mouth dropping open. Was it possible that Harry Potter was a Parselmouth? It didn’t seem at all likely but then he had defeated Voldemort when he was a baby, who knew what connection they had?
“You are the only surviving friend of James Potter, his best friend, the man that the Potters wanted to have their son if the worst should happen and we have the wills to prove it” Lucius looked triumphant his eyes gleaming silver with the delight of taking Dumbledore down even further. Of course, the case against Lupin alone wouldn’t do much harm, he was a werewolf after all, but that coupled with the abuse it would seal his fate. “Dumbledore can argue till he is blue in the face that he was doing what he thought was right, but the fact of the matter is you were always meant to have Harry, both of you and he denied you even the chance to have the wills read and for you to have him. And when his scheme started to unravel, he then threatened you. James and Lily both knew of your creature status, correct?”
“Bless my soul! You look just like your mother!” He said with a squeak jumping back for a moment before apologising and introducing himself. Tormuld cleared his throat and then very slowly explained everything to the small Hogwarts professor. As they spoke Narcissa found herself studying the two half goblins closely wondering how common it would be for the two races to marry and produce children. There were a lot of likenesses in the pair. “Albus surely you can’t think that somebody was able to bypass the security of Gringotts and access the Potter vault when you had the key and  mess with the will record?”
“I would like sometime in Autumn” Remus said softly as though he had read Severus’ own mind. “But other than that, I would be happy to leave it to you Cissy, you have excellent taste, but…It should be…in the middle of…”
“Lord Potter. It is an honour to see you again. I haven’t seen you since you were a baby, you have grown as beautiful as your mother” Narcissa said and Harry gave a very small smile pink flaring in his cheeks as his eyes turned to the floor shyly. Draco smiled at the action wanting to reach out and touch him just to make sure he was indeed real. Music started and Draco reached out to Harry.
A Yrun is sort of like a goat. The milk is meant to be the best thing you will ever taste
“...Sorry, but you heard her, she likes you...”
The single bed was a lot cosier than their bed at home, but they were used to snuggling so they figured out pretty easily how to wrap their arms around each other comfortably. Draco spelled the curtains closed, complete with a privacy spell, so they were lost in their own world. The excitement of the day had made Harry tired but his trepidation about his first day of real listens refused to allow him to drift to what should be a welcome sleep.
“Draco! To what do we owe the pleasure?” Narcissa said happily as Draco swept into the lounge room both his parents were sitting in. Narcissa rose from her chair to place a kiss on each of his cheeks while Lucius barely looked up from behind the rag of a newspaper he was reading. Both his parents had changed little in looks in the years since the war, but Draco was sure their outlooks had. At least he hoped so.
“Yes, I arrived home only moments before Harry and Draco made their rather spectacular entrance” Lucius chuckled again raising from his chair and walking to his wife. He touched both Harry’s and Draco’s heads in a gentle fashion before kissing Nacissa on the cheek. “The healer sent word that he would be here exactly on time.  He is bringing a member of the child protective service department with him. Dumbledore tried to insist that he should be there as his guardian but since Kingsley has stated you have guardianship his pleas were thankfully ignored. He did insist on having somebody else with Harry, I suggested Mrs Figg. Is that okay with you Harry?”
“I want to, but sometimes…I still find it hard…” Harry hated to admit that given how much the Malfoy’s and Severus had done for him but his mind still went back to the Dursley’s and the teachers at school. The mind healer said that it was perfectly normal and that it would take time, but Harry still felt incredibly guilty.
Harry stood nervously to one side of Masaki watching as four three headed creatures came running towards them like excited puppies. One, the largest, had a mane of long black hair around a very lion like face while the others had only a small smattering of fluff. They approached Masaki first both Lion head and goat head excited while their snake tails swished about hissing nonsense. The male lion pounced on the Magi-zoologist almost knocking him over as a pink tongue lolled out of his mouth lapping at his face.
For the story…I hope you don’t mind the fluff with Snape and Lupin…And the twins and Flich…Hagrid is here…
“Come on boy, that attic isn’t going to clean itself” She said sharply and Harry nodded following her out. The sun was already bright as they made their way over the road to her home. Once inside Harry was amazed to see that there was a breakfast set out on the table along with another letter in Draco’s beautiful script propped up against a teapot dressed in a blue tea cosy. “Sit down and have some breakfast while you read your letter...”
“How did I end up with my aunt and uncle?” Harry asked wondering if his father had had any family that might have taken him in. It didn’t seem likely and now he knew why strangers in the street seemed to know him even when he had never seen them in his life before. “Why wasn’t I told that I’m...A wizard?”
“It was interesssting to meet a ssspeaker…Perhapsss we will meet each other again…” The snake flicked her tail in goodbye and then slithered off into some bushes by the great lake. Harry and Draco watched until she was out of sight and then turned back to the castle and headed inside.
Harry took the wand and just for a moment it felt right but then a spark flew out the end and smashed a vase. There was a sharp blinding pain in his forehead and his scar grew hot. Gritting his teeth, he fought through the pain and then the wand in his hand cracked showing what appeared to be a feather. The pain left him immediately and he sighed flushing with embarrassment when he saw the now cracked wand.
Listening to his two friends having a full, and rather loud, pillow war Harry brushed his teeth and then climbed into the shower. He scrubbed his body and hair and thought about the day ahead wondering how his life would change in a few short days when they were at Hogwarts. He had friends in Gryffindor, he knew the twins would look out for him, but he really couldn’t imagine being separated from Draco. Even the thought of it made him sick to his stomach. Finishing in the bathroom he pulled on the clothes that had appeared by the door. He had picked them out the night before and left them on the chair by his bed. He had forgotten them in his rush to leave Draco and Pansy and he gave a grateful smile.
“Light throughout the darkness and oranges are a healthy fruit” Draco answered, though it was clear that he didn’t fully understand it either and that he wasn’t as interested in the orange as Harry was. Probably because he was used to it. “Mother does the oranges, there is a protection charm against ill health on them. You don’t eat it until new years eve, just leave it on the bedside table. It will keep until then”
“My heart, you a like a fussing hen, but she is right Harry, you should have some of the beef, it is wonderfully cooked” Lucius said taking a few slices from the serving dish and placing it onto his plate before adding some of the roast potatoes. Flushing brightly Harry lifted the cutlery and carefully took a bite of the beef. It was juicy and extremely well cooked with a smoky aftertaste and he imagined that it had been slow cooked all day. He swallowed it down and took some more along with a corner of the potato which was just as amazing on his taste buds. “You like?”
To say that Severus was surprised and disappointed to arrive at Malfoy manor’s and have the butler elf inform him that the masters were all in the duelling room would have been an understatement. He had spent his morning dodging Dumbledore and teaching children who didn’t want to learn and had been looking forward to a few hours teaching Draco and Harry.
I hope you enjoy today's chapter
Remus had always liked the village of Hogsmeade. It was as petty as a picture with small country cottage style houses with wooden doors and thatched roofs. In any season it looked like a John Constable painting and he had always wanted to be able to afford one of the cottages with the thatched roofs. He could imagine himself in a pretty garden with flowers creeping up over the door. He had only shared that dream with one person, Lily, who always teased him that maybe there would be a dark-haired man with a big nose inside. She was also the only one of his childhood friends that knew about his sexuality. He hadn’t been able to tell James, Sirius, or Peter, scared that that might have been one revelation too far even for his most accepting of friends and even if they didn’t mind they wouldn’t have accepted his attraction to Severus.
I hope that this is okay!
“Is there some kind of problem Robertson?”
I have my second vaccine today, I am not looking forward to it, the first one knocked me sideways a little but I know that it has to be done so wish me luck!
Just a short chapter today... New year soon and an unfortunate return....
“…Old Welsh family, Death eaters, but you’re talking about their son, Kaiden, I think you would be a good father for him.”
“And what about accidental magic? What kinds of things has happened around you?”
“You can’t threaten me!”
“And fetch them I did!” Pansy came down the stairs with Draco and Harry following behind. The twins stared in awe at the costumes both boys were wearing. Draco looked fantastic with a wooden leg that seemed to thunk as he walked down the steps. His hair seemed to be longer, almost the length of his fathers’, and he was dressed in a beautiful blue coat. Harry looked like the muggles idea of a fairy dressed in green and decorated with beautiful flowers and fluttering butterflies.
I hope that you enjoyed this part…
“You’re right, thanks Harry” She tucked her arms around his leaning her head on his shoulder as they finally reached Madam Malkins robes for all occasions. The shop was blissfully empty as they headed inside and at once Madam Malkin herself appeared from the back room, summoned by the twinkling bell above her door.
Sorry for any mistakes you may find in this story. I try and get them all but since I write mostly on my phone or tablet I do sometimes miss them, >.<  I also write for another fandom (I try and post there every day too) so I do know that I make mistakes but I’m making more than normal as I have a Japanese exam on Tuesday and have been trying to study for it hopefully when that’s over I will be able to catch my mistakes better >.< anyway I hope that they are not too bad or distracting, sorry again >.<
Some fluffy Severus/Remus as payment for the angsty parts that we’ve had. I am so tempted to do a little one shot of them at school together if anyone would like to read it? I imagine Remus to be the soft poet of the Marauders with floppy hair and a soft gaze.
“The Rose stadium, Green Entrance Ireland”
“Boy! If you’re not out here to make breakfast in five minutes!” Petunia warned not finishing the threat. It wasn’t needed. Boy knew what would happen. He would be forced to walk on the cooling coals until his feet were blistered and the hem of Dudley’s old clothes were covered in black cinders. Barely awake he hurried out of the straw nest he used as a bed and scrambled out into the muddy patch of earth between the barn and the thatched cottage. “Tidy your hair!” Petunia screeched looking him over and Boy absently pulled out some chaffs of straw and brushed it through with his fingertips. Today was not going to be a good day, he knew, but later he would be in the forests with his friends.
Hope this part is okay
“Yup. We went to the Dragons. Did you see them? They are only Welsh Greens, but they are amazing! They are huge! It is breeding season, so they are territorial, and the male was doing awesome displays!” Draco said happily guiding his friend over to his parents. “It was amazing!”
“And you Dray, how has your morning been?” Pansy asked slotting herself in between Harry and Draco and threading their arms together. The group of 7 completely ignored Ron, even when he made some nasty comments at their retreating backs. Harry felt the warmth of Pansy settled against him. Seamus introduced him to their new friend Dean Thomas, a Muggleborn, who smiled and nodded at them without any judgement. It was nice and he could easily forget about the horrible feeling he’d had since herbology.
“Yes, my dad’s will was…He made jokes. Said he wanted a funeral with everyone sobbing for him…”
“I met with Harry earlier at the Club. He had arrangements this afternoon with Luna and Rolf Scamander. Since I was in the area, I thought I would come and see you both.” He said smiling at his mother while his father let out a dry snort and hid himself behind his paper once more saying just loud enough to be heard.
“Hullo Harry, it seems you remember me” The man smiled from under a scrappy moustache that matched the colour of his hair perfectly. Harry felt deeply confused but he was matched in that by the way Severus was looking between them. His black hairs were unfathomable as always but his tone was light as he said softly;
“Am I allowed, Uncle Sev’?”
“But you said you would never have imagined Sev’ having a boyfriend”
“Hem-hem...I am Delores Umbridge, I have been sent to oversee the examination” Her voice was harsh, simpering and nasally and there was a sneer to it that made it chilling. Harry shifted backwards until he was pressed up against Lucius’s legs. The Malfoy lord placed his hands gently on his shoulders.
“Oh, they are mostly used for storage now. We haven’t had an iron maiden in years, though I’m sure that father could arrange for another one to be brought if you so wished. It’s been ages since I got to play like that” Draco said dryly only the corners of his mouth twitching to show that he was only joking. Harry rolled his eyes and let out a laugh nudging his arm.
“I still can’t believe you get into games for free!”
“Yeah, but he doesn’t look nearly as good as you” Twin winks were sent in his direction and Harry rolled his eyes moving to attach a large collar of flowers around Moony’s neck. The wolf gave him a stare but accepted it yawning as he got up and stretched out his back. Severus let out a shrill sound fluffing out his wings and Harry laughed.
“I will start work on the Wolfsbane potion immediately. There is almost a month before the next full moon I should have a batch before then”
“Harry, why…Yer know, why is Dumbledore so set against you? From what I’ve ‘eard he made a big stink at the ministry. Me mam thought he was sure that he who must not be named were coming back or had a kid or summot”
“I’m not…I mean…I…Was…I…”
“I didn’t know. Not until Dumbledore and Hagrid came to my Mas…Uncle and Aunts home two weeks ago and told me I had to leave” Harry answered honestly nervously tugging at the expensive fitted clothes he was wearing his green eyes moving nervously around the ballroom. It was only then that Draco remembered they weren’t alone, and that hundreds of people were listening in trying to understand what was happening between their prince and the young lord. “I’m sorry, I left a note with Moony…”
A thunderous applause sounded out from the students at the tables and Draco found himself scowling at the hat. He had no idea where it would put him but he wasn’t not going to be with Harry. He would set the hat alight before being separated he decided as McGonagall moved to it and lifted it up.
“I never doubted you my love” Narcissa smiled pressing a kiss to the tip of his nose and then the corner of his mouth before laying her head on his chest with her arm slung across his middle. “You are perhaps not a good man, altogether, but you are a great one and I love you”
“Okay! We’re in the press box, best seats in the house! You see all the action! This way…Stay close!”
!” She hissed and the Lion head gave a grumble “
“Chocolate please, Sevvie”
“Sorry about me mam. She can be a frightful bore sometimes”
“We’re not sure, he has always been a little...Odd” Draco said diplomatically looking at the House Elf that had been magically restrained by Jinx. The elf then shoved him into a corner and draped a tablecloth over him. “Mother thinks that he might have suffered some magic damage when he was young. He often has to be restrained or he might hurt himself, more so when he gets into a fit”
“How did you respond?”
“Ahem, sorry to interrupt Lord Malfoy, Lady Malfoy but I think you should contact Gloria Longbottom too, she is the minister in charge of Muggle born. Her department is small and nobody really takes it seriously but she does” Hestia said carefully getting to her feet. “Um...I can floo her if you like?”
“You’re very welcome. I really must be going, I will see you for dinner Severus?”
“What is our plan next my love?”
“Severus Snape? The best but, feared potion master to grace the dungeons of Hogwarts”
“Yup, well two of them…Harry and Draco…” Nino moved quickly her hands coming to rest on each of their shoulders and Harry swallowed nervously but the man, Sho, smiled in a friendly way his eyes genuinely warm. He dipped his head in a polite bow and then grinned a little wider as he motioned to Nino.
“You have your own bed as well, Dray, yet you sleep with Harry every night. What are you going to do when we are in Hogwarts? If you are in different houses?”
“I’m Fred, he’s George”
“Weasley’s? And a dirty Irish half-blood”
“It’s okay, you’ll be amongst friends, and we’re at home if you ever want to get out of the ballroom just give me a nod and we can come up here with just our friends, alright?” Draco assured him his hand slipping into his and Harry felt the frisson of nerves slip away. He squeezed the hand in his and nodded before letting go and allowing Remus to help him into his costume. He blinked as flower, bees and butterflies flew up out of the box and decorated one side of his face and entangled themselves into his wild hair. “Wow! You’re the Fae Child! You look so good!”
“Oh, such as?” Draco hummed waving for another whiskey while studying Potter finding it amusing that his new confidence seemed to fade just a little making him look like his school hood rival once again. There was something oddly comforting in that. Harry looked a little sheepishly at his drink before draining the last of it in a swill as though he was downing a brandy for some Dutch courage. It was extremely amusing to watch and Draco found his inner Slytherin delighted that maybe he had something over Harry once and for all.
“Shut up prat, it wasn’t pity, I was distracted”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I want to stay with Draco, Jinx...And the Malfoy’s if...If I can...Please...Don’t make me go back to the Dursley’s...Please...” He whispered staring into the Auror’s face and to his and Dumbledore’s surprise Kingsley nodded and smiled.
Another player in our story is Draco Malfoy, prince and heir to the kingdom of Hogwarts. A fox-shifter and an alpha. It is a month before Draco’s seventeenth birthday party where our story truly starts and like with most stories of magic, romance and happy endings, our story starts with a letter…
Umeda introduced the idea of a wand to Japan during one of the many wars that were fought between seven lords. She believed that being able to focus her magic into a wand would be the best way to help her lover when against his enemies. It worked, with her help he defeated all six of the other lords and gained all their land. Following on Umeda’s example more people started using wands, but it was difficult and dangerous so Umeda decided that a school would be the best way to teach people her way of doing magic. When it was first opened it was only for those that were loyal to Emperor Hashimoto and Umeda and lived nearby. Umeda taught at the school until her death, her descendant teaches at the school today his name is Matsumoto Jun and he has the rather impressive eyebrows”
“My aunt always said that they were freakish”
“For your information, Granger my parents are due to arrive any minute. I was told to give you this Potter. It is an invitation to the Malfoy ball. As you are a Black you have a right to be there” Draco huffed taking out a cream coloured envelope from the depths of his robes. Harry accepted it slowly his fingers brushing against Draco’s as he did so. “The invitation includes your friends” Draco told him this with a scowl motioning to Ron and Hermione who both stayed silent with shock. “Well then, I bid you a very merry yule, Potter”
“Ughnnn, Draco”
“The yule log?”
“Lilis, Dumbledore is trying his best”
“They are so in love its gross!” Pansy cooed as they left and the twins nodded shuddering, there was really some things that you didn’t want to see your teacher like.
“What else can I do?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco? Oh, we met last year, in Hogsmeade, Hadrian and Draco were there with Hadrian’s fathers…Was not good timing, we were meant to be in class.” The twins said taking it in turn to speak as they let out loud laughs. “Bit awkward, but it turned out good…”
“You will use one of the Malfoy owls, we have several in fact one of the snowy owls chicks has recently fledged she was to be sent to the Emporium to be sold but perhaps you would like her, I forgot that we haven’t yet given you a birthday gift” Narcissa said happily and Harry swallowed fighting tears that came to his eyes almost instantly. It suddenly felt overly warm and stuffy in the breakfast room and he was very glad when Draco stood up and took his hand saying;
Yes my parents are both pure blood, in fact my mother was second cousin to your father through the Black line (I have enclosed a small family tree). I see, father says that muggles get jealous over what they don’t have. The last time we tried to expose ourselves to Muggles they tried to burn/hang us. Of course that is impossible and mostly they ended up killing themselves for the most part. Although you haven’t said much your family sounds like the worst kind of muggles. Your cousin is unable to read?
“Are you excited?”
“It’s not that bad!” Draco whined flushing bright red and staring down at his feet while Harry clung to his hand in sympathy at his embarrassment as the adults chuckled.
I really hope you like this part
“Nice to meet you. Thank you for putting up with my Nino. I know she can be a brat”
“I’ve pushed those things…Sometimes at school and I cut the grass with a lawn mower”
“I bet that’s what they did, I imagine that they even had yellow ones picked out in case we ended up in Hufflepuff. Are you ready to head back to the dorm and get our books, Harry? Ladies?” He said including Chao-Xiang and her friend who laughed and nodded pushing their empty plates aside. Harry was glad that Draco had included the girls. They were the only ones being normal and nice around them and he wanted peace in his house even if they had Pansy, Seamus and the twins outside of it. As they made their way out of the great hall Harry saw Ron sitting all alone at a table in the far corner his face dark and scornful as his top lip curled.
“That’s if you can see them, they often like to be invisible”
“A sleeping potion” Harry answered quickly hoping that he had remembered correctly. Severus didn’t nod or answer this time but from the next question he had gotten it right.
“I was only joking Harry, you know that. But I know what people say about me” He shrugged, and Harry remembered how upset he had been when he had been talking about people avoiding him because of his family.
“No, Harry, he is the advisor to King Lucius I think…Severus Snape, I really must go, the crowds are making me nervous.” Remus did look a little skittish as he looked at the milling crowd but for once no eyes were on him all focused on the man in front of them who had raised a hand. Remus hurried off in the direction of the forest and Harry watched him go before turning back to the man who had started to speak.
A scream tore through Harry’s body as he woke with a jerk. Panting heavily he looked around terrified that the nameless figures from his dreams would be standing over him waiting to finish the   job they had started. His heart racing and his eyes unfocused from the lack of glasses it took him a few moments to realise that he was the bed in the Malfoy’s home. Unlike last night he was alone and the large empty bed was enough to frighten him as much as the dream and the figures that were lurking in there
“She wouldn’t do that”
“Pleased...Pleased to meet you...You sir” Harry spluttered bobbing up and down awkwardly as the black eyes turned to stare at him. He was still expressionless but Harry was positive that the air in the room grew colder.
“I trust you” He whispered feeling incredibly tired now and he didn’t hear Draco’s reply as he drifted to sleep his dreams surprisingly free from nightmares.
“…Is it? Is that what you really think? Or is that what those muggles told you? I think you should talk to them. I really think you upset Remus” Draco told him and Harry nodded rubbing his face with one hand. He had grown so much in the time that he had been with the Malfoy’s and he knew that he was in some ways a lot more mature than some children his age but in a lot of things he was still very much a child.
“See, at least someone thinks I’m awesome” Nino chuckled ruffling Draco’s hair and the blonde flushed with a tiny, shy grin smoothing out his hair while Nino introduced the twins and Pansy to Sho. “Sho got us the tickets. He is following the hummingbirds for this year and doing a book about them”
*-*-*-*
“Dobby is so sorry masters! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!” He screamed smacking his head against the wall in a fit of panic. The elf was special touched he had to be none of the other elves acted the way that he did.
“He tells nobody anything but he is of the belief that the Dark Lord will return” Severus said pushing the thoughts away as he drained his drink and Lucius gave a nod his grey eyes moving to Draco.
“The Weasley twins startled him”
This will be Severus and Remus (Sorry if people wanted Tonks she will be here but not with Remus)
“Youse is going to hospital, Dobby!” Jinx said appearing at the elf’s side sporting a bloody nose and a black eye. Her tone was gentle but wary “Youse is needen helps! Master Lucius is finding youse a good healer! Youse be right as rains…” The pity in the elfs face told Harry that she probably didn’t think it was true but Harry knew that they had tried everything else to help Dobby, but they just didn’t know what was causing his problems. Jinx clicked her fingers and the manic House elf was bound in an armless, legless, pillowcase with only his head sticking out. “Sorrys, young Master Harrys…Jinx be taken hims now!”
“A pleasure as always”
“I’m glad that you are getting to experience things now. I wish that I had never listened to Dumbledore and had come to find you”
“Yes, mother, c’mon Harry” Draco’s hand slapped him on the back and Harry continued to his bathroom. The bathroom held a large free-standing tub with golden feet that looked like the paws of an animal. The skin was set against a window that overlooked a lake and Harry already spent a lot of time staring out at it when he was brushing his teeth the night before. “Are you feeling better?”
I promise I will be updating Classmate as soon as I can. This story is just more or less finished and I wanted fluffy, smutty Draco/Harry…Yes Harry is bottom in my story because I feel that there isn’t many bottom Harry stories for Draco/Harry and there are already many wonderful stories with Top Harry I just want to mix things up.
sorry for the shorter chapter, never dd i know that Japnese particles were so difficult to understand >.<
“Are you asking me on a date?”
“Thank-you, and I am sorry...”
“Bridget. It has been a long time since Hogwarts. How are you? And this is your son? Bridget and I attended Hogwarts together. I was in the year below” Narcissa acted as though she couldn’t see the icy glare that was being sent her way and Harry was both proud and offended. Narcissa was truly the strongest woman he had ever known and the kindest. It wasn’t fair that people thought they could be cruel. “Please come in, the boys have been excited at having young Seamus come to join them for the day, along with Pansy and the dear Weasley’s” Harry was truly amazed that Narcissa found the Weasley twins as fun as exciting as she did. When they had first taken tea with her, they had somehow been so nervous they had made their cups explode and had covered her with chocolate cake and jam. They had pulled pranks and were loud, but like Remus, Narcissa seemed to enjoy the pranks and, on one special occasion, had even helped them prank her husband. Lucius had been…Amused…In his own way when he had seen the laughter in Narcissa’s face. The twins had been terrified for all of ten minutes and then had burst out laughing when their hair had been turned different shades of blue. Who knew that Lucius had been talking with Remus about performing his own prank? “Shall we have tea, Bridget? While the children play? Nino…Harry’s and Draco’s tutor and Jinx one of our house elves will watch them”
“Where did you hear that?”
“You will be staying Harry, have no fear on that, neither Narcissa nor myself will let you go”
“Blackmail?” Remus hummed in some surprise his amber eyes widening.
“Thank-you Mrs Figg” Harry grinned almost running to the table and flipping open his letter and reading it while he ate buttered toast and drank tea.
“Harry...” Harry corrected him lightly with a smile and Draco blinked slowly his lighter than light eyelashes somehow managing to capture the sun as though he had put fairy dust on them. “It’s been years, you’re looking well though Draco”
“That sounds…Boring” Draco said his pointed nose wrinkling, and Harry nodded biting the head off the snake and settled himself against his headboard. Draco let out a sigh lifting an orange which was decorated with cloves and holy with a small candle stuck in the top. “I prefer our festival”
“I see, that elf is growing ever more tiresome. I will send for a healer from Saint Mungo’s or a specialist in elves” Lucius sighed pinching the bridge of his nose “I’m very sorry, Harry, pay him no mind. He has always been a little troubled, ever since he was young. I have always suspected spell damage but lately he has grown increasingly worse. Unfortunately to give him clothes and send him away would only make matters worse”
“No…She was really nice…She said…She said that there was something bad…Something inside me…It didn’t want to be tasted” Harry whimpered his scar throbbing as the four snake heads whispered between each other the male seemingly scolding Josephine. Masaki looked troubled his deep brown eyes watching the scene unfold trying to make sense of it.
“Good Night father”
It is strange writing a Christmas part when we haven’t really entered autumn yet but hey ho…The twelve days of Christmas is something my group does. It is rather long and tiring and frankly I’m happy that this year we will have to cut back. 12th night cake is basically Christmas cake now but is made with baked marzipan and is soaked in way too much alcohol, you start making it months before Christmas and feed it alcohol the entire time, though it is a lot nicer than Figgie Pudding xD
Sorry for the short chapters but I'm so frigging busy 😫
Nino and Sho were speaking in low voices somewhere behind them, but Harry was focused on the pitch. Music had started and an announcer was running through the names of the teams.
“If I had wings, like Noah’s dove, I’d fly up the river, to the one I love. Fare thee well, oh Honey, Fare thee well. I knew a man, who was long and tall, he moved his body, like a cannonball. Oh Honey, fare thee well. Remember one night in the drizzling rain and around my heart I felt an aching pain. Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well. One of these days, it won’t be long, you’ll call my name and I’ll be gone. Fare thee well, Oh Honey, fare thee well. Fare thee well…” His voice only slightly wobbly. Chuck had helped him with his breathing and although he wasn’t perfect, he knew he had a decent voice when he let himself and since his only audience was Draco, he had a boost of confidence. The blond had changed positions and was now sitting crossed legged on the bed watching him with a smile his eyes softer and more relaxed than they were around other children. It made him look more like the child he was, and Harry couldn’t help but grin goofily back at him. Once the last note fell away Draco started clapping and Harry flushed a bright red. “I made tones of mistakes.”
“I see, Dumbledore’s doing no doubt, wanting to spare him the fate of growing up with the weight of the world on his shoulders, perhaps even mould him in someway. In a year he would then send a friendly face to Potter, a fully light wizard who will show the boy that the world is only black and white when everyone knows there are many shades of grey” Lucius hummed clicking his fingers and a House elf, thankfully not Dobby, appeared to pour him more coffee and to take away the plate. “You must help him see that the world isn’t the way some families will believe. Something your mother said intrigued me, she said that you showed her a letter and you had reason to believe that Mr Potter was ill treated with his relatives?”
“Come on! The twins are here already! Maybe you will like their costumes more!”
“Prat! Of course I’ll marry you, put it on...” Harry handed the ring to Draco who slipped it on his finger before kissing him again. Tomorrow Draco’s parents would come and Lucius could either be happy or leave but nothing will take away their happiness. Not now, not ever.
“I had other things on my mind”
Harry woke to the feeling of somebody breathing against his neck and arms wrapped around him. It was obviously much later in the day as the sun was now creeping around the curtains. There was a rattle from across the room and Harry gasped pulling out of Draco’s arms as he saw a beautiful white owl flying around. It was almost completely white but there were a few black feathers here and there. Its eyes were yellow and they were watching him closely. Its beak opened and it let out a loud screech and flew towards him. She cicled his head for a moment and then landed on his should.
“Because if you use too much Arrow-wart you can end up in a coma, Dad” Harry answered with only a moments hesitation. Severus’ lips curled into a genuine smile as he nodded and turned his attention to Draco who was helping George.
*-*-*
“Hey-ya cutie! How’s my little sunshine?” Harry asked tickling the boy’s stomach until he started laughing and he gave a grin which faltered as he remembered what Draco had told him about the Stonebroke child. “Hey, Luna what do you know about the Stonebrokes?”
“She is very beautiful; she takes after her mother” Kingsley confirmed and Narcissa gave a smile shuddering again as one of the Dementors felt her happiness and came closer. Its hooded face sniffing around for the scrap of joy so it could suck it away. “I hope that one day she will be as strong as you” Kingsley distracted her holding her elbow, the warmth of his hand pulling her gaze away from the disgusting, sightless creature.

“Severus, you find us in the middle of a meal, won’t you come through?”
Hestia smiled and then looked around the room that they were in. Harry did the same trying not to gasp hard at the splendour of the room. Everything seemed to be made of shiny stone and gold. Though the floor was checkerboard pattern like a chess board with the surrounding edge was block back with statues and flowers in huge pots. There were benches every so often and there was a huge set of bottle green doors with ornate stained glass. This room alone was bigger than his aunt and uncles entire home and he was surprised that there was no echo when he whispered;
“I know you have to say that Harry because you are living with him, but it’s quite alright, we’re friends you can tell the truth. Don’t you think Crow has a head shaped like a muggle lightbulb? The top of his head is much bigger than the bottom”
*-*-*
“Jake Pointer” A boy with mousy brown hair that curled around his temples squeaked nervously as the door closed behind the last of the boys. Draco arched an eyebrow before moving to his trunk leaving Harry to introduce himself and his friend.
“It is” Remus chuckled his eyes fond as he looked at both Harry and Severus. “Shall we look at the map and find our way to the Chimera enclosure…?”
“Like this…” His head came almost completely off his torso with only a thin patch of skin and muscle holding it in place. The girl, Hermione, flinched her nose wrinkling while a few more children let out more vocal noises of shock and disgust Seamus on the other hand cried out happily,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was thinking how perfect this moment is and how at last I can call you lover”
“And why not?”
“Yes! You were amazing! You played really well!”
“Of course, not”
“Don’t worry, I wasn’t going to make you wear one. Okay! I’m ready to get married” He announced walking to the door with Moony coming to stand beside him while Severus followed his sharp talons dangerously close to the twin’s faces.
“Are you still tired Harry?” He asked seeing his friend rubbing his eyes and trying to fight a yawn. Harry gave him a sheepish smile and a nod
“No denial I see, well if you had known Theo in school you would have known that he always wanted to be a designer. After the war Madam Malkin was the only person that would give him a chance and since she is not so fast on her legs anymore she is more than happy to let him be her successor” Draco’s answer was unexpected and Harry felt a twinge of pity for Theo being tarred with the same brush when as far as he could remember he had never really had a side during he whole rivalry. “Don’t look like that Potter, surely you should have gotten over your hero thing by now. You can’t help everyone, much less from peoples opinions. Theo is happy, if you think you should help somebody look into what’s happened to that Stonebroke kid”.
Anyway! Back to the story! I hope to keep posting more soon!
“Professor Snape…Um…What can I get you, sir?”
Thank you so so much to everyone that has liked commented and bookmarked ♡♡♡♡
“Chuck?” Draco asked with a smile as Harry flipped the page and saw some notes already carefully placed onto the sheet in front of him. Unlike his writing the notes were all carefully done. It was a simple enough tune, but Harry knew that his skills weren’t good enough.
“Of course, it is the least I can do for the boy, but Severus, you must answer me honestly is Harry safe with the Malfoys?” She asked her grandmotherly concern flowing out and Severus gave a nod and then turned to his potion’s cabinet. After unlocking it with a bronze key he searched for the small vial that he kept there for emergencies.
“I highly doubt that Mr Potter, forgive me, I haven’t introduced myself properly, I am Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father” Lucius held out a gloved hand and Harry hesitated only a fraction of a second before reaching out to take it whispering;
“Swish and flick, no exaggerated movements, the wand is just the extension of yourself.” Flitwick told them excitedly after explaining that they would be making feathers fly. Harry and his friends had taken up almost an entire row and were all looking at each other nervously. Hermione on the other hand was almost falling out of her chair on the opposite side of the classroom looking like she wanted to be the first to get her feather into the air. “Practice the movements a few times! Swish and Flick…No, no, Mr Finnigan, not so heavy handed, gently does it! Yes! Very good Miss Parkinson, you may attempt to combine the movements with the incantation!”
“I don’t see why you would, I didn’t care to speak of my personal life to students who barely managed a passing grade” Severus huffed “Now, if you please, my family and I would like our ice creams so we might enjoy the park”
“That still doesn’t mean I should be given courtship presents or whatever. How do I stop this?”
“And they still wanted you to have the boy. Dumbledore can go suck a lemon drop, since he is so fond of them”
“Shut up Harry”
“And how long would it take to get such a meeting arranged?”  Lucius asked while Harry suddenly felt cold wondering if his parents were going to tell him that he was best left in Dumbledores care. Tormuld gave a grin. It was clear that he respected the Malfoy lordship more than he did Dumbledore as he bowed his head low exposing the back of his neck.
The muscles in his arms twitched for a moment remembering the way Dudley would push him out of the way in the lunchroom at school and how Vernon would shove him into his cupboard. The actions had been easy, you just moved the muscles and shoved. A tingling sensation curled around his body and he tried to focus it into his hands and then towards the doll, but it soon fizzled out.
“What? Why? Did she hurt you?” Draco asked instantly. His eyes running over his mother for any sign of injury even as his expression became afraid. Harry didn’t know much about Azkaban. He knew that it was a wizarding prison on an island somewhere and that its name alone was enough to make many would be criminals think again, but he did know about Aunt Bellatrix Lestrange. Draco had nightmares about the woman even though he would have only met her when he was extremely young. He had read things about her however and the things that she had done, that was enough to make him shudder.
“Auror department” A tired male voice called carefully pushing the door open and stepping inside.  A female auror came in behind her wand immediately coming to her hand as she saw the Malfoy’s inside with the muggles cowering on their knees on the floor covered head to toe in boils that looked close to bursting “Lord Malfoy...What...What is going on here!? Drop your wands!” “Now you have arrived we shall lower our wands, but you should know that it was I who summoned you. These filth have been abusing a child for ten years. If you look into the cupboard under the stairs you will see his so called bedroom” Lucius said waving his hand as he lowered his wand but didn’t drop it. Narcissa did the same while the Dursley’s looked torn about what they should do. It was clear that they didn’t like the looks of anything that was happening and they didn’t seem to trust the aurors that had just arrived.
“You look great! The flowers would have looked strange if you were still wearing them” Fred enthused happy when Harry started smiling again. Draco took Harry’s hand in his giving it a squeeze as he gave the other boy a soft smile. Growing up they had only heard bad things about the Malfoy’s and they had been inclined to believe it just from stories but meeting them and getting to know them behind the scary persona they let out when in public they realised that they were just as loving and soft as their own parents if not more so. Narcissa and Lucius respected each other in a way that their parents never did, and they seemed to be partners in everything.
“Welcome, welcome!” The man said coming to stand directly in front of Harry so he could peer into his eyes. “Welcome Mr Potter, I wondered when I would be seeing you…It seems like only yesterday your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. And you Remus, a tricky little customer you were, but we got there in the end…How is it? Still working out for you?”
“Pops is teaching us history because Dad doesn’t like Binns”
“He wasn’t looking where he was going! He trod on my foot mummy!” Dudley whined and Petunia sucked in breath.
“Hem, hem, a threat Lord Malfoy? Hem hem...”
“In much the same way Muggles believe Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit you have to have a little bit of faith” Remus chuckled with a shrug taking a sip of his wine glass his engagement ring shining in the soft candle light. “Whatever the case, he was an incredibly powerful wizard just as his younger sister Gwenddydd was a powerful witch though not as well known. She was born of Merlin’s mother but had a human father. She married a northern king, Yaris Ravenclaw, and her daughter was one of the founders of Hogwarts. But we can talk about all of this in our next lesson, Harry”
“Justen nows sirs shalls I tells thems to go to the sittings rooms, sirs?”
“I wonder why he doesn’t seem to trust Quirrell?” Draco asked in a hushed voice as they walked through the school dungeons up to the main floor. It was a shorter walk than to Ravenclaw tower, but it was teeming with both Slytherin and Hufflepuff students and almost automatically Harry reached for Draco’s hand as though it was an anchor to ground him. Draco threaded their fingers together tightly and carried on walking until they were almost knocked over by painful pushes to their backs. “What do you think you are doing?” Draco hissed spinning on his heel and finding himself face to chest with a burly third year in a Slytherin green tie. The boy looked like Dudley if Dudley had had his face repeatedly hit with a spade. The third year’s nose was smooshed against his cheek after having been broken so many times, the angle causing his top lip to lift in the middle to reveal yellowing buck teeth. His hair was a simple short back and sides. “Blackmore…”
“Oh! Um…Thanks…Um…Shit, I forgot to put a privacy spell on it…” She gasped and this time it was Ginny who was blushing and stammering as she pulled her hand back and looked around nervously as though she were expecting a reporter to appear out of the shadows. As the best Seeker England had had in years it was understandable that she would be nervous, from the way Luna told it Ginny had had more press than him in the last few years. Harry quickly set a privacy bubble around them which included a minor illusion spell which stopped anyone being able to take a photo of them. “Thanks, its just so new I keep forgetting and we aren’t ready to go public, not until the world cup…”
“I see, then you are in good hands Harry, the spell for the brace can be taken off at night but must be recast straight away in the morning”
“…Having sex…I was okay until Draco said that…”
“Yer got some kind of problem, pal?” The Irish boy was smaller than Harry, but he was bulky from years of boxing. Ronan Finnegan was proud that his son had followed in his mother’s footsteps and had inherited magic, but he had wanted something between them, and they had fallen on boxing which had recently started becoming kickboxing, so even at eleven it was clear that there was muscle under his robes. Ronald’s face almost immediately matched his hair as he looked around for support before shrugging and gesturing to his and Harry’s joined hands. Immediately, Harry started to pull away in embarrassment, but Draco held him tightly. “What about it?”
“You would be testing an untested and unproven potion Lupin, in cases like these the potion master supplying the potion pays you” Severus rolled his eyes looking away from the ant so he could look up at him and Remus felt his mouth dropping open before he managed to squeak;
“You know I love Potions, Dad! And helping curse damage sounds really interesting.” Harry said with sincerity and Severus felt a wide smile spread over his lips. Never in all his years would he have dared believe that he would have a son that would share an interest in potions. “Do you think it would work?”
“I know, but I have to at least try, mother. There was always something between Harry and me. As a child it was rivalry that grew out of petty jealousy that he chose Weasley over me, as teens it was more complicated but still we were connected…I think that always there has been a part of me that has longed to be by his side…I will regret not seeing what will happen more than trying and having it go badly” Draco admitted nervous about having so much emotion on display but needing his mother to understand what he was feeling, what he had been feeling since Harry had held out his hand and introduced himself. Narcissa gave him a smile squeezing his fingers. “This isn’t a game for Harry, mother, anymore than it is for me.”
“Madam Ninomiya has agreed to teach you again this year Draco, I’m sure that she will be more than happy to have a second student. Severus has agreed to tutor you on the day where he has an hour spare but, I beg of you, don’t be a dullard and waste his time. You know how your Godfather gets” Lucius said and Draco nodded seriously before flashing Harry a grin.
As Nino finished there was a loud, almost deafening bang, and they both looked up to see that Draco had completely sent his dummy and Harry’s flying. The shock on the blonde’s face was laughable as his gapped at his hands like a fish delight shining in his blue grey eyes.
“Ah like piggie in the middle! Dudley would play it with my glasses” Harry said with a flush deciding that Muggle in the middle sounded a lot more fun. Lucius and Draco lifted a matching eyebrow before nodding and smiling;
“We are. We are to be married sometime in the next year I proposed to him on Christmas day.”
“Malfoy manor has been around for a very long time, all of those that live inside have made their name on the walls here as soon as they have gotten their wands. You and Draco will have that pleasure next year” Lucius explained pausing in his steps to hold the lantern closer to the wall to show his own name with Narcissa’s beside it though it must have been done before the were married as she had signed it Narcissa Black.
“Wow! This is the best Hot chocolate I’ve ever had!” Hestia said cheerfully as she dropped into the wicker chair. She had loosened the robes she was wearing her legs crossed in what his mother would describe as a very un-lady like way and he saw that her undershirt had something that looked like sauce spilled down the front.
Had a bunch of treatment and am under a heart specialist... Then they ran another test and found blood where blood shouldn't be... So I was back in the hospital for another round of tests as they thought I might have cancer. Thankfully not. Turns out I have the insides of a 55 year old because I have had undiagnosed crohn's disease for a number of years.... They took a bit of my insides out and hopefully I am now on my way to recovery or at least getting to where it can be treated. I'm still in recovery but as soon as I'm able I will be posting this and dragon tamer! Sorry
“My parents, you knew them?”
“Oh, just ignore him, mum was giving us a lecture about the Evil Malfoy’s being death eaters” George said dropping into the seat beside Draco and Harry. “Are you a little death eater, Draco?”
“Actually, I am several minutes late. But I can see why you may have lost time, is there a reason that you are engaging in fisticuffs with effigies of Harry’s former tormentors? Not that I can blame you”
“Slytherin!”
“Promise you won’t think I’m crazy?”
I hope this was okay
“We should. I have already decided that I would like to co-adopt Harry, but as secondary parent. You will be primary…”
“Only when I have bad dreams. I sometimes see a flash of green light and it hurts when I wake up. What does it mean, dad?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know, Dray, I promise I will.” Harry nodded settling into the bed again with Draco securely pressed against his side. Listening to the gentle breathing of his friend Harry drifted back to sleep and dreamt of Cherry Blossoms in Japan and the way the pink blooms had rained down around them like raindrops. That was a dream he happily remembered when he woke the next morning to the sounds of the other boys getting ready out in the dorm. Hearing the movement of the others made him realise that meant that Draco had left the bed and broken the spell that he had placed around them the night before. The curtains were still closed however, and he pretended to be asleep listening to Albright who was chuntering loudly.
“What? Seriously? Awesome!” The twins gasped knowing what they were while Harry was still studying them with a confused expression. He held them to his eyes and played about with the dials shocked when the pitch suddenly seemed to be right in front of him and he could see the woman on the bench talking to the man next to her. If he had been able to read lips, he would have been able to read what they were saying. A woman to the right of the first was munching her way through a box of pastries. Her mouth was open and when Harry pressed another button, he watched her chew on the same cake five times. It was certainly not something he was expecting to see but he couldn’t deny that it was awesome.
“Is that a yes then, Wolf?”
“Maybe because you’re enough of a romantic old fool that you would ride on the back of one and have it take you off”
I hope that this is okay :)
"we since I'm already number one on people nobody wants to eat with I suppose we would make quite a pair"
Sorry for the absence! It wasn’t planned but after my second jab I needed some time. The AstraZeneca vaccine is a bitch!
“No, but you will, and you will be great, you and Draco will make excellent fathers.” Luna beamed and Rolf’s laugh filled the cosy kitchen waking Lorcan with a whimper.
“I have had lovers, Severus, not many and none that lasted but I have not been a saint. However, even in 50 years I still imagine that I would be pulled to dark hair and dry wit. If you were willing I would very much like to see where this attraction between us may go” The words were out before Remus could convince himself to stop them and Severus looked at him with his dark as sin eyes, twin spots of colour appearing in his cheeks.
“That is somewhat…I…Are you sure, Harry?”
“That is the Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent. It is an ancient animal worshiped by the Aztecs. The Teotihuacan people in pre-Columbian Mexico worshiped it as a God. Their priest was said to be able to talk to the snake” Remus answered lightly as they walked through the doors to what appeared to be a replica of an Aztec temple. It was warmer inside than it had been outside and almost the entire building was taken over by a large case. There were children all around, but they were trying to force their parents into hurrying up wanting to see the dragons.
“I hope that after the way he has treated Harry he will be taken down altogether. Why wasn’t the will heard before?”
“Sleep well, Harry, Draco, Jinx will watch over you, if you should need anything” Lucius said carefully and Harry allowed himself to sink into the warm soft bed wondering if a beating from his aunt or uncle had gone too far and this was his heaven. If it was he was happy with that he decided happily falling into a happy sleep, with a warm arm wrapped around his waist, where he dreamt of a different woman, one with red hair and eyes like his own holding him against her breast as she sang a song in his ear and told him stories of magic.
“So I would imagine madam, I have already made them along with my own statement, Harry, I have been working on the spell for your brace, although it is the same spell the sizing needs to be changed. I will need to see if more adjustments need to be made...Stand as straight as you can for me, there’s a good Lad” Tobias flicked his wand and muttered an incantation that caused Harry to feel as though pressure was being tightly woven around his bones. It tugged at his hips and his spine before settling around his shoulders and then his neck. It made him stand straighter than he had ever stood before. It made him cry out in pain and surprise more so when his legs felt as though they were being twisted and straightened. “I’m so sorry my lad, but I promise that it will help once it starts to work. Perhaps we shall keep the spell on for only half a day at first, Lady Malfoy”
