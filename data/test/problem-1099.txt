She was sure that Dumbledore was planning something and it had to do with the last war.
"Looks like Harry wins this time but maybe not having this discussion on the stairs while you keep guests waiting would be preferable." Severous said interupting the silence from behind them.
"I suggest we wait to be sorted before we debate which house is better than the others hmm? Even if you do already know where you are likely headed. We've been surprised before after all. Now come along students. Once we reach the front the sorting ceremony can begin. Just come forward and sit upon the stool. I will place the sorting hat on your head. Once placed you will join the table with your new house mates. Those students will be like your family during the school term until you graduate at the end of your seventh year. Now follow me please." She advised as she led the to the doors as they swung open revealing the Great Hall.
"I thought the same. I should have delved deeper in our occlumency lessons. Of course you weren't progressing. No one can while they are troubled and of course you were. The obliviates were tampering with your memories. Had I done more than just graze your surface thoughts I would have seen it, though I had thought it best to teach you more gently. I am sorry." Severus added. His speech was shorter though a lot more profound to Harry at that moment.
Still he surprised himself by not flinching when the door to his compartment slid open with a soft whooshing sound and a small click at the end.
"Wicked.... Im Ron by the way. Ronald Weasley. Anyway I'd better be off. My brothers were gonna show me a spell to turn Scabbers yellow. See you at the sorting and all that." Ron said before getting up and leaving.
"Great, now Im sure he's gone mental." Ron commented off handedly.
Well Harry didn't have an argument for that so off he went with her.
"Lucius, thank you for taking us in at such short notice." Severus said greeting Lucius first.
"It's time already? Thank you Miffty. When he gets here I will show him to the parlor myself, just have tea ready to be served once we take seats." Harry instructed.
Then, just to add salt to the wound Ron Weasley was one of his room mates along with two others. And while Dean and Seamous were both respecfully leaving him alone where they could, Ron was showing how bloody ignorant and rude he could be as often as possible.
Harry gave his grandfather an exasperated look before standing and going to pack his school things in his new trunk. He wouldn't grace his grandfather with a response to his obvious question.
"Oh no you don't." Umbridge called. Using her wand she shut and locked the classroom door before Harry could leave.
Thus problem five.
They moved into the parlor for tea while dinner was being prepared. Thats when Draco couldn't really contain himself any further.
"That is a portkey. It's a special little thing too. You can not speak of it, you can not remove it, and you can not cunfund it to send you anywhere but its designated location. It won't work here on Hogwarts grounds, but should you step outside of the school, you will find yourself in a very unpleasant place. Even you have Hogsmede duties after all. You can't avoid it forever. And when you get to where it will take you, it will turn to ash. And when you get there, I will pay you back for every drop of his blood that you spilled." Snape was not playing around. No one saw the inside of the Dark Lords prison cells and lived.
The nearest empty compartment faced the platform and the boys waved to her promising to write and waving bye. It was another ten minuets before the train left and they had time to settle in for the long ride.
Am I going to go there? Yes, yes I think I will.
"That means if someone is attacking students then they are smart enough to not attack yours. However, the relationship between you, Draco and Harry is still unknown. They either are attacking a group to hide that Harry is their primary target, or they don't think anyone will do anything about it." Lucius reasoned.
That had caused her cheeks to redden in obvious anger and just a hint of shame.
Harry marched nervously to the pitch. He felt only minimally better as Sev had reminded him how natural he was as a kid on the small practice brooms he and Draco had raced each other around on. Sev even told Harry how his birth father James had been an ace flyer in his Hogwarts days, despite Sev's dislike of Harrys biological father.
"I will use your floo if you don't mind. It would be faster." Severus said as he grabbed the floo powder and left. He traveled to the Leaky in diagon alley and then apperated from behind the building.
"Good. Let us be going then." Severus said as he gestured to the fireplace.
"Please, Molly, I know we never got on or even really knew each other, but from one mother to another, I can no longer stand the dark shadow hanging over mine and Dracos heads." Narcissa was never known to beg and for all that she loves her husband, her child will always come first. Pride and marriage be damned.
"It won't be easy. Besides, once away from the school, the Dark Lord would want to speak with me. He wants to see you turn sides, as it would negate the prophesy and the need to kill you in one swoop." Severus explained.
Ok, so i may have had to reread the first book again. A few of the planned scenes i may have originally pulled from the 2nd book instead of the first on accident, and since Im planning a full rewrite I needed to get a few facts straight.
Lucious couldn't understand most of the drivel that he heard but a mans voice calling a small child a freak and sounds of things smashing were disturbing enough. A door slammed from inside near enough to the door that the next sentence could be heard quite clearly.
"This is the first I've heard of this as well. Doesn't happen often, but once a blue moon my mother decides on something rather suddenly. Though you won't see me complaining too much." Draco admitted freely.
"Did you know Harry, that most of the potions I use here are made by the newt students? Obviously Severus keeps an eye out to make sure they will work properly, but the newt students are partially responsible for the potions I require here." Poppy said conversationally as she started to unwrap his hand.
"Of course Lord Potter. I shall be going through the Potter accounts and sending all records here by owl post. Then we can set a date to update the family wards. Welcome home Lord Potter." Griphook said kindly (for a goblin anyway) before he turned and vanished.
So, it was with mixed emotions that he noticed a white owl (not Hedwig, Hedwig was prettier) that dropped a letter for him at breakfast that Friday.
However, Harry Potter had yet to actually do anything in class or in her general presence, that would facilitate a detention. The boy had quietly dealt with her (even to herself) useless lessons and her jabs against his character.
After Draco fled in embarrassment, Harry was only alone for a few minuets before his former friends found him. One long, awkward, silent train ride later, Harry was glad to finally be at the castle.
This was on purpose, Harry knew, since the first years were to be seated later so they could be sorted.
"The longest six months ever. I will mend this Lucius. Tomorrow I will find out what's going on once and for all, and when I do I will fix it." He may not have said it out loud, but Severus vowed to himself to make amends someway, but first he needed to know what he was up against.
But he was more guarded.
"I agree, we should go. Father hates how much is missing from the curriculum here, and with this, Father has an excuse to pull me early. You've wanted to quit for years and leaving in the middle of the year would be just the kind of statement to the old man you need anyway Sev. There would be no doubt of your loyalties then." Draco continued.
Ron was shocked along with the rest of the common rooms occupants who had learned quickly how shy and reserved Harry was.
Hermione took one last look at Harry. Her friend was still not moving and the look on his face was so tense it aged him. He was under far to much stress as it was.
"Harry, I know we asked you before, but we are concerned. We want to help you but we can't unless you tell us what's going on." Draco started. Severus seemed more inclined to watch him, see his reactions.
Harry thought it was appropriate. He would certainly be rising from the ashes of his current life now he was emancipated. Starting with never returning to the Dursleys ever again.
Sure enough he turned to see Malfoy and son. The elder held his wand out, likely having been the one to counter the stunner that had been aimed at Harrys back.
Harry was now officially frustrated. Neither he or Hermione had any ideas about a stone that could recreate a body. Draco, being the stubborn pointy git that he was, only had one idea, but the Philosophers Stone was cosidered a myth according to every text they read.
"So, that happened." Harry supplied unhelpful as ever.
By the time they got back to the estate poor Harry was exhausted. He went down for a nap without much effort and Snape couldnt help but smile a bit. The child was shy but well behaved. He was far more forgiving than he should be and though he was malnourished, he clearly had an appetite so getting him healthy wouldnt be difficult. He was glad that Lucious was such a push over for his wife as it prompted everything in motion to save the poor boy from further abuse.
So what's it like being famous? What was it like when you found out you defeated the dark lord as a mere baby? Are you excited about Hogwarts? What house are you thinking you'll be in?
Ok, so it was mentioned to me that Snape was a master of the mind arts but never noticed what was going on by delving into Harrys mind. That gets explained here.
"You'll be better off in the end and a lot happier for it. And isnt that all a mother really wants for her children." Narcissa countered, leaving Draco to board the train with the Weasleys and Harry himself.
I am spoiling you guys with updates today.
"Something like that. I'm no fool. I learned very early on not to trust anyone lightly. If what you two want, is an end to this madness, then help me end it with as little blood spilled as possible. If things continue as they are, magicals in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland will be extinct. And all for a war between two people." Harry continued.
Still, in the last two weeks Harry had learned a great deal, and knew he had a lot of very embarrassing apologies to make to several people. The Malfoy family and Snape to name a few.
"At least I don't prefer the snakes to my own house!" Ron proclaimed loudly looking angry.
Ron had decided that Harry being the new seeker was some kind of publicity stunt and was a great offense despite it being his fault to begin with. And he proclaimed it to anyone who would listen as loudly as possible. For the last two weeks.
The following weeks saw Harry even busier than normal and he was exhausted. He often went to bed directly after he finished his homework.
"Then I suppose I'll wait. No need to learn it early anyway. I almost never lose things anyway. Have a pleasant trip. And thank you again... Err..." Hermione stalled not haveing gotten their names.
"You want it. Come get it." Ron challenged, taking his broom and lifting into the air.
At least until he was called for by his head of house.
Now Harry just had this meeting to get through.
That led him to problem number four.
Harry was still unsure about the whole thing and only didnt skip the whole class because of Hermione basically dragging him.
He followed Clover to the guest room he had been assigned. The room was beautiful and true to its name, was decorated mostly in blues, accented luxuriously with gold and white.
Everywhere Harry looked he saw gorgeous gowns and dress robes. There were crystal goblets and fancy foods across an entire wall. Harry was beginning to feel the ever encroaching shyness that plagued him when Draco wasnt around creep in.
"Who is?" Harry dared to ask as he grabbed his other three shirts and two pairs of pants (Dudleys hand me downs).
"The mom, Mrs Weasley. She gave me a really strange look as we moved to the platform before stepping through. Nothing bad just odd." Harry explained.
"Ron stop it. Honestly, you're becoming obnoxious. If you've got that much energy why not help me figure out more about the hallows or even the horcruxes. But for Merlins sake drop it about Malfoy." Hermione finally said in a slightly annoyed tone. How had she come to like this git.
Moving on in to Harrys pov. Hes four and i have never written in the mind set of a four year old so this will be different.
"No Harry. Don't. You'll only get into trouble." Hermione said grabbing his arm to stop him.
"Never heard the term best for last then have you?" Harry quipped back. A smirk on his face as he teased the blonde.
They were dressed oddly though Harry hardly cared.
"Yes, though why vote twice?" Harry asked.
"Perfect then. I can send a few elves to get the place clean and child proofed for you. I would suggest making sure you have everything you need though. Just know we would be happy to help wherever we can." Lucious was for once 100% sincere.
Just a little bit of redemption and what I pictured happening behind the scenes.
"I look sophisticated. At least I'm not cursed with your mop. Did you even comb it?" Draco retourted sneering at the insult.
Severus was dead set determined to force it out of his system.
the Lord of a Noble house, and had generations of accumulated wealth and knowledge at his disposal. Not that it looked like he used it at all.
"Of course sirs." Miffty replied before popping away to finish the last little things to make a perfect tea time.
Snape has started Harrys occlumency lessons, but it is not going well and Harry is getting frustrated by the memory lapses.
He was bemused to also learn that he had finished early. So, he bottled his potion up and started cleaning up his work station.
"Welcome to Potter Manor, Lord Malfoy. Please follow me, we shall take tea in the parlor." Harry greeted him politely just as his grandfather had been drilling into his head.
Harry knew the situation was manipulated and sure Draco Malfoy was a brat in first year, but to snub a potential friend so thoroughly right out of the gate and so publicly, it would be a miracle to mend bridges there at all, no matter how much he might want to be friends now. Draco was a wealth of information. If Harry hadn't been so hasty, Draco could have shown Harry how to handle everything properly. Harry was sure that the young Malfoy heir was groomed from birth to take his fathers mantle, and likely could have helped Harry to not make a complete arse of himself quite so regularly.
Debating on redeeming Lucious later, what do you guys think?
"Hail Mister Potter. I am Griphook, manager for the Potter accounts. I was beginning to wonder when you would come in to settle your accounts. Now that you are here we can get started. First and foremost, congratulations on your emancipation. Let us proceed." Griphook didn't necessarily speak too quickly, but had dropped a proverbial bomb on Harrys psyche.
"Expelliarmus! Protego!" Harry really wanted out of this room. He could still prove what was going on as long as he had the quill and lines themselves.
Human psychology is interesting. I think we should all study people and see what makes us human because it helps us so much.
It was the same as always. Once again, the burning feeling etched itself into his skin as the altered blood quill forced the words over and over again until it was unreadable on his skin.
The copies were made out of parchment and wouldn't hold up under any real scrutiny, but Harry hoped it would take long enough for anyone to notice that he and his mates were long gone before someone went after them.
"Grandfather explained a bit. But I don't know if anything has changed since his time or not. I couldn't find anything in the library about how those proceedings take place." Harry admitted.
"Well, I guess you should take some time to figure it out. We aren't going to force you or anything. Though we would like you better as an ally. Im frankly done with all the fighting. Save that energy for Voldemort you know." Harry said.
"Why not just do that then?" Harry asked surprising both slytherins.
"Glad to see you made it. I was beginning to worry." Draco said as soon as the door closed behind them.
That year he saw Potter get well and truly angry.
"Give it back Ron." Harry demanded.
(See the end of the chapter for
And it was all coming to a head tonight apparently as he stepped into Severus' office only to see him sitting beside Draco, both with glum stone-like expressions.
Ugh, Harry could not understand how Uncle Lucious dealt with these people every single day.
He had so much apologizing to do and that wasn't something the potions master was good at.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco is Draco. He has begun plotting and all of Slytherin house is behind him. Zabini and Parkinson especially. It seems they are working silently with the lions. These have been the quietest potions classes I have ever held. It is bliss I tell you. I worry though. If Potter and his infamous luck and Draco with his cunning start working together instead of as rivals, those two could tear this school apart and likely get away with it." Snape joked. He actually joked. So clearly he and Malfoy were friends or comrades of a sort. Possibly both spys. That just made sense with how open they were with each others secrets. And if Malfoy wasn't dead, then that means he had to have been shocked by his wifes actions enough to convince Voldy that he had no part in her betrayal. But based on the conversation at hand, he knew that Snape and Malfoy were on the same side, and Snape was definately against Voldemort after his best friend (Harrys mother) was murdered.
There was a moment of silence where Draco put away his carry on travel bag that likely held his casual clothing since he was also in his uniform already.
However, this seemed to be the wrong thing to say.
Though he would never admit it aloud, Draco found himself agreeing with Ron. Harry must have cracked and gone officially mental. Though he was flattered Harry seemed to take any notice of his mental state, Draco couldnt assess why Potter would care enough to bother.
That decided, he marked the last essay, the beginning of the year essays were always the easiest, and made his way over to the office and quarter of one Pomona Pomfrey. They needed to have a talk about a certain sport and childrens health.
"Hello Professor Snape. I'm here settling my accounts. Can't imagine what else I would be in the bank for." Harry answered, allowing his annoyance to clearly show through.
"If you are quite finished hiding from us Draco?" She called from the couch by the fire. Draco was very much reminded of his old tutor (boggy old cow) whenever she had caught him doing something he shouldn't.
"Honestly, there really is just a lot on my mind. I still have one more horcrux to find, and even then we have to get Nagini away from her master. Then there's all the responsibilities that come with my house, things that have gone unchecked since before I was born, since my father never took up the lordship. My finances are an absolute mess, no thanks to the headmasters meddling after he died. Plus I am likely going to need to stay with the goblins over the break. They are the only ones I would trust to purify the horcruxs. To be perfectly honest, it's a lot to keep track of. Plus, I really need to figure out what's going to happen after school. I mean, what would I even do? I hardly care for authority so the aurors are not an option, There's no way I could be a healer, not with my potions grade where it is. I wouldn't mind being a curse breaker, but even I need human interaction every once in a while. I guess, I just don't know what to do after all this is over, provided I live to see the end of everything. Actually, I have no idea why I'm even telling you all this." Harry ranted finally giving in under Dracos glare.
Draco was suddenly struck by how the others were talking amongst themselves about mundane topics regarding the upcoming school year, giving Draco valuable time to gather his thoughts. For which he was grateful.
Once they landed, Harry could see the huge grounds and impressive manor beyond the gates that held his family crest.
Well, Severus would just have to prove to Harry that he could be a good protector.
He also found that many of the votes cast in his name as of the last few years, didn't really align with his beliefs anyway, which saddened him greatly. His current proxy, a certain headmaster, wasn't voting for the kind of reforms that Harry was told he would be fighting for. Just recently for example was further restrictions on werewolves. Dumbledore had voted in favor of those restrictions using Harry's seat.
For starters, he found it very odd that he could never remember much from the detentions that Umbridge was giving him, and he found it very annoying that no one believed him when he said something was wrong.
It took a week but Lucious managed to pry information about the Potter boys whereabouts. He owed his friend Severous greatly for prying it from Dumbledore but there it was.
The man knew though that his mates not being there would only aggravate the young mans rejection illness. A fact that he tried to relay to Dumbledore, but without telling him why their presence was so necessary, Dumbledore had them both removed, to return at the end of the day.
There was just no way Harry wasn't aware, after a month and several visits to Madam Pomphrey, what was happening to him. Severus was quite sure that something likely happened and Harry found it too embarrasing to tell the what it was. That said, it was affecting his health quite severely and Severus and Draco had decided to intervene.
Ron looked at her puzzled.
The only real upside was that Ron had no time to bully him much. The downside was he had no time for friends either. He hadn't seen Draco in over a week and that hadn't happened since they were 9 and gave each other the dragon pox.
"Harry Potter and I need a blood test and an over view of my accounts please." Harry wasn't really thinking he would be able to access his accounts yet, since he was under age, but he still thought that maybe, if he was of creature blood, his father might have left a few books regarding what he was and what to do about it from there.
Lucius had outdone himself and figured out what the horcruxs were. He had even secretly gathered a few leaving very well made fakes. Severus had been an immense help on that front. Now the only ones left to figure out were Nagini, the diadem and his own.
"Yes, you had not reported in a while. How are things at the castle?" Of course he wanted a report.
The rest of the train ride was uneventful. The others were bristling when they heard Harry recount his encounter with Ron. Fisrt he insulted their house of choice but they also called Draco and his Father evil which they knew first hand was false.
Still at five minuets before seven that evening Harry knocked on the door or Umbridges office.
On the one hand he could still obey orders and kill Dumbledore and Potter, cementing his place with the Dark Lord and maybe make his Father proud of him. Not that the second past was very likely but out had been his goal for a very very long time.
Umbridge cast a lip lock at him, keeping him from speaking about his detentions or even writing about them. Well, damn.
Was she serious? Here? In front of the entire alley? She was going to do this here? He wasn't even her child to chastise.
Harry lost his appetite and left lunch early. He would head to the dungeons and read while he waited for the start of his double potions class. He could only hope to be left well enough alone.
The mess was not yet cleaned up and the minister was still very stressed about it. As the senior undersecretary to the minister, she had volunteered to go to Hogwarts and figure out what was going on.
The incident in question was him walking Luna Lovegood to class when she was getting bullied. The girls pestering her had tripped her and Harry was helping her up.
Umbridge dodged and let out two curses that Harry didn't recognize.
Breaking his own depressing line of thoughts, Severus arrived at the infirmary.
"Alright, right aboard then, and we'll be off. Twelve sickles that." The driver said not even acknowledging the wings and horns. Harry could fold his wings until they were so tight against his back that you could barely tell they were there, but the horns were fairly obvious.
That said he could also decidedly not be a murderer and follow his mother's example, fighting for your freedom despite the obvious death that hangs over their heads for it. Still, Draco had been thinking death would be better than serving Voldemort lately anyway. So there is his chance to get out and be a normal student for once. Maybe actually enjoy school for a bit.
The first Wizengamot meeting of the season was next week. It was inconveniently on a bloody tuesday. Who scheduled a major meeting on a tuesday anyway.
"Had to wait for Seamus to fall asleep. He tends to go to bed early from time to time. I couldn't start packing until he was snoring. Great sound cover though, especially when Weasley joins in.." Harry explained.
catch up after everything was in proper order.
That was odd. If he was looking for his brothers then why was he looking for a seat. Surely hed just sit with them. That was odd.
"If you could do me one favor. Make sure that pink toad faced swine ends up as his new favorite plaything." The nurse answered darkly. For her to threaten violence could only mean one thing.
Now, with these situations it is standard to forge a new key. Before that though we must do a bloodline test. This test will not only confirm you identity without a doubt, it will also tell us what creature you are. For this I will need you to give three drops of blood onto this parchment." Griphook laid a flat parchment across his desk and handed Harry a small pin, to prick his finger with.
"And Draco, how has he seemed?" Now Lucius sounded concerned and it created a warped image of the man who nearly shot the killing curse at a twelve year old version of himself.
"Im Harry Potter and this is Draco Malfoy. And no problem Hermione. It's a pleasure." Harry said nicely ignoring Dracos grimace.
Harry just giggled.
In fact, Harry had pointed out to her that with his grades going up and his behavior fine tuned, that the removal of points was an abuse of power since all Dumbledore wanted was to control him and as his head of house she should be ashamed of herself for allowing it.
There we go. Another chapter down. We finally get to really meet Voldemort next chapter.
"I'm in." Draco said quietly, just enough to be heard without truely interrupting. It was a weight lifted from his shoulders and rolled off.
Harry sighed as he thought things through. He
Griphook had patiently and painstakingly, explained everything Harry needed to know about keeping his books straight. That alone had taken a few hours before they moved on to working out everything that had happened with his accounts since his grandfathers passing. For the most part everything had just sat doing nothing except gathering interest, but there was something peculiar with his primary account.
"An old friend o Dumbledore. He's famous he is. Invented the Sorcerors Stone and lived longer than any other wizard since Merlin imself...... I shouldnta told you that." Hagrid said hastily.
Sorry for the delay but life sucks and work has been busy. Working in a liquor store at the beginning of summer is no joke. Excuses aside, enjoy the chapter.
"Eloquent as ever Potter. Any other sage like observation or can we move on?" Draco sneered back.
I started here because the entire childhood would have been far too slow a burn for me. Oh here goes.
"You really are a different kind of stupid. Did you forget that I am emancipated? That I have taken up my familys lordship? Or that I have a seat on the board of govenors and the wizengamot? Do you really think I won't be reporting this? That I, as a member of the board, would allow this to continue? You really are a fool." Harry grabbed the parchment and the quill and rushed out of the womans office.
"She and Draco are safe then?" Lucious confirmed.
The man wouldn't show it, not any more than Lucious would anyway, but to someone who knew Severous well, it was clear.
So yeah. Im a bit rusty but here we go. I couldn't find my original notes so this is going forward based on memory alone so we shall see how this goes.
Harry was none the wiser about the entire exchange. Still completely lost to the world.
"And don't listen to Grandfather too much. He isn't up to date on modern styles as much as he would like to make himself believe." Harry joked, seeing his grandfather enter the portrait just outside the floo room.
However crafty he was, however, his friends saw right through him. Specifically Pansy.
Lucius had stopped by and mentioned that Harry didn't seem to be feeling alright either and asked what was wrong. Harry told him he had no idea and that the school nurse couldn't figure it out either.
As he did the night before, Harry ate with Mr. Snape. It was nice to have someone eat with him, the Durselys always ate first and Harry only ate the left overs after by himself.
"Now, now then what's all this. Surely you wouldn't attack a young lord in public like this. I'm almost tempted to summon the aurors myself." Harry knew the dark tones of that voice by now.
In the grave yard against the Dark Lord he had space and luck on his side. Here not so much. He was in a cramped classroom full of large desks and such with his only exit locked.
"Where are we going?" Harry asked.
"Come now, I'll be back for the holidays, no need to fret like this. Mifty, you have the list of things that need to be done by the time Christmas holidays role around right. The manor needs to be completely updated and such, send all plans to me via owl. The gardens can be stripped bare and prepped for next spring so the plants will be settled by summer and the outside of the manor needs a good washing." Harry reminded her, although he doubted he really needed to.
Sure he smiled and joked and laughed like normal, but it felt like a script. Like he was acting. But surely that couldn't be, nothing seemed to have phased him before and Draco would have noticed in the previous years if something had changed.
When Harry finally found it within himself to tell his grandfathers portrait what had happened while he was out, Charlus Potter spent a good half hour laughing uproariously.
"Coming, coming! Whats this about a guest?" Arther Weasley was just as Narcissa expected him to be, red hair a mess, wrinkled ministry robes, and clearly whipped by his wife, though he was still as boisterous as he was in their Hogwarts days.
Just who was Harry James Potter, The Boy Who Lived?
Umbridge shows her toad skin. I can not express to you how much I hate this character. In canon she isn't given much in the way of a character other than nasty. She is every PTA Karen Mom/ Political lying pig in history smushed together to form one person and that is her entire personality. So, my version is going to include a bit more depth than a bone dry kiddy pool.
"And if were you? Would you fight Arthur if it meant your children would be happier and safer?" Narcissa countered.
"Gringots in London, please." Harry answered.
The first wizengamot meeting has come up. Harry waited to see if Malfoy Sr would keep his word. Harry begins shifting sides.
"Alright. We will leave tonight then. Harry, pack your things quickly and meet myself and Draco in the dungeons just after curfew. Use that blasted cloak of yours to get there safely. We will use the floo in my office. I will tell the headmaster there is a meeting tonight that I must attend to keep my cover. You two will floo with me to my manor and we can go to Malfoy manor from there." Severus planned quickly.
They had likely been told via the gossip mill that Harry had awoken and was currently barely existing without them.
"So, shall we get to business at hand. Of the three topics up for vote, I don't see them affecting you too terribly much, but it is perfect to teach you how the wizengamot works. And while making something as innocuous as not walking around in public intoxicated illegal may seem silly, you have to see things from all angles. So, what are your thoughts." Lucius probed him.
Harry decided one of these days he'd have every sash in the manor burned.
"Its 'may we go' Draco. Don't forget your lessons just because of a new friend." Mrs. Malfoy corrected.
Draco goes to Uncle Sev to figure out what to do with Harry.
Harrys birthday came and went. The boys were exstatic about starting school and Harry was indeed pleased with his new broom. He hadnt really needed one but it was the best in the market. The nimbus 2000 was stationed in his fathers office at the school waiting for Harry to put in his dorm depending on his house.
The Aurors were always looking for a reason the shut down Borgin and Burkes and the vanishing cabinet there led to the one he saw in the room where Potters little defense club practiced the year before. He had no idea what it was doing in there when it clearly seemed broken and he had watched it vanish into the room when Umbridge burst in. He knew what it was almost instantly from the rune carvings on the door.
"Indeed, I do look forward to seeing how he handles himself tomorrow. He is obviously receiving training from somewhere. He handled that situation very well. Not perfect but well enough.... What's that look Draco?" Lucius noticed a peculiar look on his sons face.
They weren't even doing much. Just laps at ten-fifteen feet only as fast as each person was comfortable and only two flyers per height meaning 6 at a time to prevent collisions.
How was he to ever make this up to Draco?
"No one is doubting that there's a lot to think about. Especially for you. That said, Harry, you act like living is a chore anymore. If you don't want to survive, then you drag everyone down with you. You have any idea what kind of a balancing act you are doing right now. If you fall into depression or choose to not survive before you're even facing the Dark Lord, everyone else feels that too. No one, and I mean this, is following Dumbledore. We all are looking to you. I don't report what the Dark Lord is ordering me to Dumbledore, I tell you. The entire order, at least those I have met, all look to you before following an order from Dumbledore. They answer to him because you haven't taken up the mantle yet. If you were to try, you would likely be the real leader of the light. You have your own followers and your own spies. You have the resources and you have used them to your advantage. Now, you just have to act like it." Draco ranted back at him.
"Malfoy Manor. It's the safest place really. The manor has ancient  defences. Not as old as Hogwarts, but just as strong, and several are dark." Draco answered.
However, Potter was showing that, although he was breaking away from the headmasters grasp, he also wouldn't be going to the ministry either. That would require punishment.
Sure it seemed silly, and Harry had no real experience with public intoxication, but Vernon could get brutal when on the sauce so to speak.
"Something else is different. Your aura changed too. I can sense it even though I won't get my own veela inheritance until I turn seventeen. What's up with that?" Draco was being decidedly blunt today.
If this was what these men were like under the facade they showed the public, then Harry felt rather privilaged to see it. He hoped he would see more of it.
A dark dread crept through Dracos veins.
"I agree. This will take time and effort on all our parts. Here is what I propose. We have dinner together twice a week. Just the three of us in my chambers. We can start with that. We can sit, eat and talk." Severus proposed.
He blamed Oliver Wood completely.
"Well now you know what the headmaster is hiding. I assume you can use that information to keep yourself alive Mr. Malfoy? Your son worries for you, not that he'll say so out loud." Harry said in an emotionless voice that honestly worried both adults.
"Get a regular publicist anyway. The other prints can't ask you for interviews, but that doesn't stop them from printing about you in general if there is a good story. You are a public figure after all and that means there is always something to write about." His grandfather added.
So, off he went to the street the night of his birthday, having not received even a note from his friends, and flagged down the night bus.
Still, a lot would depend on what happened soon. If Lord Malfoy kept his word and came to visit him regarding the wizengamot, then he had decided he would hear the man out regarding Voldemort and his beliefs on the matter. It almost felt like the whole war was put on hold after the tournament, and Harry hadn't felt his scar burn once since the Dark Lord had risen. Now, he was curious to see what was really going on.
so cute. All the kids together. So what house should I put Harry in........ I cant decide........ Ugh wheres a four sided coin when i need it.
Well, putting things lightly, it was rather hectic at work for a while after that. And the goblins were not happy that something was carried out against the will while they were meant to be the acting benefactors. Dumbledore got quite the tongue lashing (enough to make Lucious giddy though he'd never show it), and it was decided that with the clear abuse on top of the legal aspects Harry would be out of the Dursleys hands fairly quickly.
"Hello there Granger. Hello she-Weasley. Good day to you both." Pansys voice echoed in Hermiones skull though the other girls voice was quiet.
"So there was no plan. She just... In front of basically the entire school? Bloody hell, Dra, what are you going to do?" Pansy asked now legitimately concerned.
He showed her respect to a degree, though no more than was expected to show to ones teacher. He turned in his assignments on time and they were all a proper length with appropriate 'ministry approved' information.
"Actually, Headmaster, unless it is pertaining to school or classes, nothing else is really any of your business, and I'll ask you kindly to stay out of it. . . . And I'm not your boy." The entire hall had gone completely silent watching the exchange. It was true then, THE Harry Potter, was no longer siding with Dumbledore. It would be across the whole of Britain by morning.
"You would be correct. There's a lot I'd like to know. That said there's something about you changing that has got my curiosity wholly peaked. You see the first time we bumped into each other this summer was at the bank. Severus, he's a vampire by the way, said you smelled different and it actually managed to distract him. Then yesterday at the alley. Draco said your aura had changed. I find myself wondering about this since, I sensed no real change myself. Severus mentioned smelling creature blood but not knowing what it was." Lucius wanted to know what kind of creature he was?
"Magic, dear boy. And come out. Theres nothing to fear from a house elf. Dinsy keeps the house clean and serves meals. If you need anything she'll be more than delighted to help you." Mr. Snape explained.
Sending both letters together after supper through Molly, Narcissa felt a weight she didn't know she'd been carrying lift from her shoulders. And for the first time in a long long time a whistful and hopeful smile lit up her face revealing the beauty she always had been under the several layers of stress and pain time had laid upon her.
Draco was standing just outside waiting for Harry most likely. As a prefect Draco had reason to be out after curfew if he was turning in reports to his head of house, so it wasn't too strange for him to be waiting for Severus outside the mans office.
"So anyway what's up with this new development? Is your mother serious about joining the order or what?" Granger asked bringing the conversation to the proper topic.
"No I don't think he does. But he'll be punishing me for treason, Draco for failing and Cissa for never joining at all in one shot. It would be perfectly effective too." Lucious basically spat the last words out.
Then he finds out the truth.
"The Dark Lord wants you to teach me to guard my mind? How exactly is that beneficial to him? He has been trying to kill me up to this point after all." Harry countered, completely confused.
"Yes, actually I would go and have that checked. Most dark veela are breeders and the pheonix is known for self procreation, meaning they have both male and female organs and can have their own young. Yes, I would get that checked." Charlus said mostly to himself.
Harry was pulled out of his thoughts when a hand rested on his shoulder. Harry turned and faced Dumbledore himself. Harry wasn't sure how he hadn't noticed him, but here he was none the less.
Harry had sent an owl off with a formal complaint to the minister and a copy with a letter and bottled memory to Lucius so it couldn't be pushed under the rug.
"Uncle Sev wheres the playroom. Can Harry and I go there instead?" Draco asked pleadingly.
Harry waited no more than a few moments before a warm wash of magic that felt so familiar, though he had never felt it before, welcomed him in, and he watched in amazement as the gates cleared themselves of any rust or vines and swung open without so much a creak.
It showed Harry that Severus was at least trying to respect his privacy by not delving too far into his mind while teaching him, but it also meant that he missed things.
"Well, if it isn't Potter. And what, prey tell, are you doing here unattended?" Harry knew that voice and really, really wished he could ignore it.
"I would hardly blame him either. He would probably see it as a mercy for you to die rather than remain as a puppet. Much like when you were a baby I suppose." Draco added hoping that made sense to the still distraught looking lion.
The tiredness he had felt the last several days was only made worse by his lack of sleep and the very thought of eating felt like a chore.
Snarky arses
"Excellent. I didn't put up a privacy spell for nothing then. Now here's the plan..." Pansy went into infinite detail.
As far as Delores could figure, the closest people to the headmaster were his staff and one boy-who-lived.
It was the letter from his mother that perked him up though.
Harry very gently tugged on Dracos sleeve to alert the boy he had arrived, and Draco led him into the office.
'I'm part veela. My veela feels rejected by its mates.' Harry thought to himself.
But what stone could possibly recreate a body?
"Harry?" Snape called to him once he was done and Harry couldn't help but flinch. Not only was Severus really scary right then, but he was still feeling the results of the quill on top of rejection sickness.
If Voldemort thought Lucious had sent his wife and son away so he could act as a spy, there was no way he'd survive the night.
Sure enough, not even a full second after the clock went silent after chiming twice for the time, the flames turned a brilliant green and Lord Malfoy stepped out. Lucius Malfoy was dressed casually (at least as casual as Harry assumed the man was capable of) with a typical button down silk shirt and dark grey robes. The outer travel robe was elegantly removed and hung up before the older man turned to face Harry.
He had even shown initiative with a project she had assigned last minuet by creating a diarama of the creature she had assigned them to study. He was well informed and the whole thing was rather impressive.
"Well thanks again Harry. And you too Draco. Enjoy the trip." She said before leaving, presumably to return to toad in her hands to the poor sod who lost it.
When he was done Harry sat down and started looking over the next potion they would be going over in class. They were working specifically in healing for the next few weeks and the next potion was specifically for dragon fire burns. (Huh, that would have been useful last year)
Harrys mind was spinning. This new perspective was more than he could wrap his head around.
Ok so, should i do a full rewrite of the whole series or should I just make this go faster. Im not really sure. Its a slow burn regardless but a full rewrite of all the books could take a while.
"How long have you known all this? Why not come to someone sooner?" Severus asked, feeling a bit off balance and more than a little embarrassed for not noticing all this during the failed occlumency lessons.
"She's switching sides. Pulled the mother to mother card on me. Couldn't leave her to what Voldemort would do to her if she encouraged his orders to be ignored. She agreed to tell us everything she knows and even fight of need be." Molly said defending her actions in a way that left no room to argue.
Stamping down his shock and ... distaste, for the room and the other person in it Harry stepped in and closed the door behind him.
"I plan on it. I read that somewhere in the library here, I just haven't made an appointment yet. It still messes with my head a bit that I might be able to bear kids myself. It wouldn't be all that bad though to be honest. I wouldn't mind having my own family to take care of. I'm kind of tired of being the strong one all the time." Harry admitted.
Harry, however, barely reacted to their presence aside from flinching as the infirmary doors creaked open. Of course Harry likely sensed his mates coming and wasn't sure about how to react if at all. Still he nodded to Lucius as he left but didn't turn to face Severus or Draco.
"Can you ask him? Maybe he could come for my birthday." Draco was basically mumbling his eyes turning dark with sleep as the covers were lifted around him.
The Slytherin group understandably giving him space and a few sympathetic glances. Hed need to figure out where a few of them stood on the matter once in the common room at the school.
The grounds were overgrown and would need maintenance, and the outer walls of the manor would need a good scrubbing. Harry could imagine the sheet covered furniture and layers of dust within without needing to see it.
To his credit, Severus softened his features, and nodded before speaking.
Ginny catching on quickly took her wand from her bag and slipped it up her sleeve, just in case.
Draco and he hadn't really interacted at all since the train ride, but that was telling in and of itself. Harry read it was the olive branch it was.
Love yas
So, here Harry was outside Umbridges office ten minuets early (no point in making it easy to claim he was tardy) and praying for something fairly easy. Most of the students who had had detention with the woman had claimed it was only lines so he wasn't too worried, not that he dreaded the one on one time with the crazy woman.
"But isn't magic bad? Uncle Vernon says it's for devils and evil people. Thats why i get in trouble so much." Harry asked confused.
He could already tell that class would be a chore this year. She reminded him so much of some sick love child between his Aunt Marges dog ripper and a diseased toad, that he almost laughed at the mental image.
Apparently Lucius would be at the school to both visit his son and speak to Severus. And since he would already be there, he wanted to meet with Harry regarding the meeting. That was on Saturday. Well, Harry had all the time in the world since he decided against returning to quittich that year.
It was no secret that the Malfoy family to some degree had always supported Lord Voldemort, though no one spoke of it and it was never confirmed to what degree.
The last few letters were from Lords wanting marriage matches for their daughters or sons and promising many heirs to the Potter name to regrow the family and name.
Harry a little flustered by the ... Confrontation? was a little at a lack for words and just sort of went with it and nodded.
He was just getting to Sev's room when he heard voices from inside.
The rest of the evening went like that as they discussed different things and picked at their food, both far to intrigued by the conversation to really focus on food.
"Mother have you seen where Fathers gone off to?" Draco asked once the pudgey woman shed been talking to noticed them and allowed a break in the conversation.
Madam Hooch went to him immediately but it was clear she was fuming.
Sorry it has been a while. My fiance was attacked while at work and we have been dealing with hospitals and law suits and stuff. He's ok, but since I was also working the whole time, I've been a bit busy.
"Of course." Hermione felt offended that she would dare question her intelligence.
This gave Harry a bit of pause since this meant that he really didn't need the money, and really once he started investing again, wouldn't even notice it. That said, theft was theft, and he was still angered by it on principle.
Back at the bank:
Harry hadn't been in a single detention all year. He had kept his head down and kept quiet no matter how much he wanted to obliterate the toad woman. Wasting a year of education aside, she had been down right nasty from day one. She had tried so hard to rile him up and it had come close a few times, Harry had clenched his fist under the desk so hard at one comment that his nails had actually punctured the skin of his palm.
After a while though, Harry steadily began to show his true abilities with potions that he usually reserved for his exams and papers.
It was one particular Saturday, the elder years were at Hogsmede and the younger students were enjoying the free day.
"Doesn't matter who or where boy. Just get out of my house." Vernon looked about ready to bust a vein so Harry stopped asking as he put his few clothes into an old shopping bag his aunt handed him and he was handed to two men he didn't recognize.
Now Harry was starting to get really tired very easily and quickly. He couldn't figure out what was wrong and all the added stress of that made any progress in occlumency near impossible.
So, what all does Harry really know?
Those were also properly declined, Harry stated in them that this was not the time for such things as he wanted to see his name and estate stable for a few years before he brought on a wife, husband, or children into the mix. The answers to that varied, but most were positive, stating understanding and to come back to the topic after he graduated and his affairs were settled.
Harry stumbled only to be caught by Severus. Draco couldn't help but snicker as Harry righted himself and seemed to be the  only one covered in soot.
Both Hermione and Harry left quickly, heading for the library. They needed to figure out what was guarding the stone and why Sev and Professor Quirell were after it.
So this story is gaining a good bit more attention than I ever thought possible when it decided to pop itself in my head. I can not thank you guys enough for all the kind comments. It's really motivating.
He was in far too much pain. Red hot glass shards seemed to have slowly carved their way into his chest and no amount of dreamless sleep had helped.
Lucius quietly thanked the woman for her ability to always know what her patients needed as he watched the small shocked face of one Harry Potter as he stared at the now empty potions vial, the dregs of which still swirled with a deep blue and bright silver.
Awkward........ Is a tentative alignment in order? What are the teens discussing.
"Lucius, what are your thoughts. You said he did not look well when you last saw him either, before the wizengamot meeting last week." Voldemort turned his attention to the elder blonde. Lucius had quickly grown to respect Harry and was fast at gaining his trust.
The others nodded solemnly.
The woman with him was beautiful and regal looking though she appeared kind. The boy with them was their son who looked like a tiny carbon copy of his father, just prettier.
"Oh yeah." Harry said pushing back his bangs to show the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.
Back in Snapes office, Severus watched Harry leave, but he knew the wounded look on his face would haunt him. Draco, who had yet to enter his magical inheritance, had begun pacing. His instincts were trying to come out but they weren't there yet, dulled by his premature magic.
"Oh, and I think he's researching something or other. He and Granger have gotten fairly close. I overheard them talking about a stone or something. If he's trying to exhaust himself, a research project on top of everything else will do it." Draco mentioned it off hand but seemed to have noticed how Sev had stiffened slightly.
Not that anyone bloddy well knew what to actually think about the whole thing. Of course he heard the confirmations regarding the Malfoy family backing the Dark Lord, and a few saying it was a trap to kill Harry and a few others that wondered absently if Draco had switched sides or was just influenced by his mother.
He had always enjoyed the rivalry between himself and Draco. Sure, at first Dracos haughty attitude had reminded Harry of his cousin, but after that first year, Harry actually found Dracos quick wit enjoyable and would have happily reversed his decision to become friends if not for Rons inevitable whining.
"I don't know what to do Lucius. I've never had to take care of someone before. I don't know what I am doing." Severus said, hoping for some kind of wisdom from his long time friend.
"Just a moment Mr. Snape. I didn't wish anyone to interrupt Mr. Potters detention. I will be right there." Harry did not like how close her voice sounded to him. Harry had been distracted by Severus possibly saving him that he hadn't paid attention.
Lucious Malfoy was becoming weary as his enamored son once again asked for the story of Harry Potter. Yes, Draco was a surprisingly (or perhaps not so surprisingly) spoilt child. Being an only child in a disgustingly wealthy family had its perks after all.
The castle was beautifully decorated. The draping for each house on either side of the door to the great hall. The enormous double doors stood heavy and ornate and very very closed.
"He's over by the drinks table with the Minister. You ready for your gifts I assume?" Narcissa asked with a pleasant smile.
"Don't you speak to me like that. Now come, we can finish up your shopping and you can stay with us the rest of the summer, but I expect you to apologize for worrying Albus and your family." Molly went to grab his shoulder to herd him and Harry stepped out of her reach.
And so it was with both excitement and trepidation that Harry awoke, three days after that disasterous Friday.
"Where have you been?!" Draco demanded from him with a sneer across his face.
Draco nodded just as Severus came back into the office, having finished his rounds of the school early, hoping to run into Harry had he been caught.
About an hour later Harry heard a knock on the front door. The cut on his arm had since stopped bleeding but it still hurt if he touched it. He tried to sleep as his Uncle went to the door. He didnt care about what was being said as it didnt involve him. Nothing ever did.
This will let you have your time away for your potions and such without endangering a child and will give him another child to play and interact with. Plus Narcissa has been bugging me about making sure he comes over often anyway." Lucious was perfectly fine with the idea of Draco spending time with another child to get him more active anyway.
"You are a constant headache, do you know that?" Snape couldn't help but get that dig in could he?
Harry hadn't slept.
higher than five feet.
It was at this time that his door resounded a knock. Harry and Draco had created a pattern when knocking so Severus knew when one of them were there versus another student or teacher. He never stopped the practice since it did no harm and he didn't need to put up occlumensy shields either.
She did not, however, give the points back. A fact that Harry found rather petty and caused him to lose a lot of respect for the woman.
He should have been normal. Nothing was though. And try as he might Harry couldn't stop the not so normal things from happening. Just yesterday Harry had been trying to help his aunt by holding things for her as she worked in the kitchen to make something for a guest.
"You attract nothing but the most horrid of luck dear grandson. And after he saved you as he did, you had no room to refuse him either. I remember Lucius of course, but he was a young lad when last I met him. It was briefly after that horrid incident your father caused. He was friends with the student your father often bullied. I met him then. Had a good head on his shoulders that one. He's probably just like his father was I bet. All aristocratic and has the kind of personality that makes you want to do as he says. His father, Abraxus was his name, was just like that. Always had to be a step ahead of me. There's been a family rivalry between us for generations. I'm sure Lucius was amused by you and his own son continuing the tradition. All in good fun of course. There's a marriage contract between the families too. If a breeder or a daughter were ever born they would marry into the other family. Problem is, neither family ever had girls after that contract was made. Abraxus used to tease me, saying it was the Potter curse at work. It's quite funny really." Charlus rambled a bit. That was odd, but it must have been his way of showing nerves.
Once settled though Lucious had another problem.
"Best get going or it will be even more crowded. And do try not to be so noticeably nervous while out in public. You've done all you could in the last two weeks to prepare and you have soaked it all in like a sponge. You can do this Harrison." Charlus encouraged him and the tenseness in his shoulders lessened if only slightly.
It wasn't until the seventh line however that something started to drip warmly from his hand.
"Ronald Weasley if you dont drop it I will hex you from here to the library myself. I swear if you keep this up you'll make our ears bleed." Ginny added. She had also grown tired of her brothers ranting.
It was with a bit of consternation that Severus walked briskly to the headmasters office. His arm was burning.
"Reclaim the family seat? Looks like Dumbledores little puppet has started cutting his strings. This should be exciting. The Dark Lord will be pleased if we don't need to kill such a promising youth. You should probably wait a few days to tell the venerable headmaster though. Let the boy get the wards reset first..... Are you listening Severus?" Lucius asked.
Lucious Malfoy gracefully walked through the Ministry of Magic. He needed to speak to the minister immediately if not sooner.
Now though, he had an excuse, and he was positively giddy about it.
"Will it make you go away?" Draco sneered. He hated how little muggle born children were prepared before being dumped at school to learn something they had no knowledge existed until a month or so ago.
"Mrs. Weasley, with all due respect, this is neither the time or the place for this. I have been emancipated after the headmaster allowed me to compete last school year. I do not answer to him or you. As for where I have been, I was at home. My real home. I have reclaimed the Potter Seat and taken the lordship. Besides, unless it involves my education, the headmaster has no business contacting me at all." Harry countered. He would not let himself be a door mat in public ever again. The world was about to see his back bone, Merlin damn it.
"Oh come off it Hermione. You know Im probably right." Ron answered hotly.
"Winning the tournament also got me emancipated. Magic felt it prudent then to give me my magical inheritance with my nearest birthday. I went to the bank to figure it out while the Dursleys were out of the house.The goblins were kind enough to tell me the honest truth about a few things. That's how it started. Anything else?" Harry asked. He knew Draco was likely a gossip like his father so he figured if he said everything now then he likely wouldn't need to repeat himself later.
Why wouldnt you?
They actually found Narcissa first.
That led to problem seven (he had a lot of problems ok).
It took the boys a while before they noticed the adults watching them with obvious entertainment.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not well at all My Lord. And Draco reported he was declining quickly as well. He is quite worried. That said, if Harry says he doesn't know what's causing this illness, whatever it is, then I'm inclined to believe him. He doesn't lie if he can help it. If the change was sudden, I would observe the rest of the school. Severus, are any other students showing such symptoms?" Lucius asked turning to his friend.
It would be another week before Harry would step into Snape estate for the first time. Thats how long the boy had to wait but Severous was determined to help him heal and learn to see the estate as home.
Oh, he had gotten the detention alright, but only because he was walking to close to a female student and had 'put his hands on her'.
"Hes not worth it Harry." Draco added.
"Parkinson. I see you brought help. Come on out Zabini, I saw you through the shelves." Ginny called. The boy rounded on the opposite side of the isle as Pansy had, effectively blocking any exit.
Harry blamed Dumbledore for that as well. Harry was certain that his father had never been reprimanded for his bullying ways while in school, and that compounded upon the fact that afterwards he was thrown into the war in early adulthood, meant his father had never been giving the tools or opportunity to grow up and act like the lord that he was.
"Ah, Draco is off finding our other friends. There's six of us all together." Harry answered.
"Something wrong, Mr. Potter?" Umbridges voice called from her own desk.
Harry wakes up and there is a conversation to be had, but will the hurts ever really heal.
First problem were his finances.
They were in the middle of a war.
She had a smug looking grin on her face.
"Gryfindor of course. Best house there is. 'Sides it's better than Slytherin. Not a single wizards gone dark that wasnt in Slytherin. Id watch my back if I were you and you landed there." Ron finished. Harry was beginning to get annoyed
Lucius remained silent. Of course Harry didn't know about the family wing. Who was there to visit him after all. From what Lucius could gather, there was bad blood between him and his muggle family so they were unlikely to visit a magical castle. Sirius was a fugitive so that was out too.
Then, the next year happened. Umbridge took over and that was an obvious mess. When Draco found out about the quill, he had nearly sicked up. The idea of any wizard forced to write in blood was barbaric. The ruddy things were used in magical contracts and only for the most serious of matters. Really only the goblins had access and so did the minister. Gross.
That was unfortunately anyones guess still.
"He was ... acting? He was only playing a part? Oh for the love of magic, you must be joking." Harry exclaimed. Not really ready to believe any of this.
"Considering Harrys abysmal luck, I admit to surprise, but there was not a single hitch." Harry immediately stopped laughing at Draco to glare half heartedly at Severus. The whole scene was quite entertaining.
Once over, it was time for the Malfoys to leave. Harry was a bit sad to see them go. He rather liked having a new friend and wasnt quite ready to see them go.
And all of it was for Harry.
"Well met. I was wondering where Harry was receiving his training. I remember meeting you though it was brief and not under very good circumstances.
Harry took a seat and proceed to prick his finger and squeeze out the three droplets of blood onto the parchment.
cant resist a good cliff hanger. Sorry not sorry. See yall soon.
"Well, using that reform specifically, I agree that it should be illegal. Different people react differently while intoxicated. Sure, the vast majority may just act embarrassingly, some do tend to get violent. And even if your just acting silly, there's those that take it too far and become a public nuiscense. That can damage the establishment where they are drinking or any that they go to afterwords. And that's not even mentioning the health problems that drinking to excess can cause. I personally wouldn't want to be the person cleaning up the whole alley every night." Harry answered.
He had just sent Draco back to his dorm when the call came and now he had Voldemort to deal with when he really just wanted to figure out what to do about Harry.
"No I'm just glad. You seem to have more energy than last time we saw you. Its kinda boring if you aren't yourself." Harry explained causing Dracos face to tint slightly pink, easy to see on his pale skin.
Short chapter I know. The next one will be more than story filler I promise. That said I have work tomorrow and it's 11pm. Sleep is definately needed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You clearly don't trust me, and that's understandable I guess since I don't think I really trust you either. We  haven't had the greatest of relationships before now, and it was naieve to think we could jump into the role of mates so quickly. If we can't learn to trust one another, then, mates or not, this won't work. We need to lay a new foundation I think. Start at the beginning and get to know each other, spend time with each other." Harry said as he hung his head again.
"We will floo together. I want only one floo travel to be on record, just in case." Severus said as he stepped into the empty fireplace.
While normally Snape would applaud (quietly and where no one would be able to see) such a slytherin tactic made by a gryffindor, he would not stand for Harry to be just shy of passing out in his classes.
"That's true. Actually, I think I know exactly who to ask, and it would eliminate the need for a long term publicist." Harry stated, immediately thinking of Luna.
"Not you too. Severus said his scent was different too. I have noticed no change short of the obvious." Lucius was beginning to wonder what about Potter had enchanted his son and best friend. It was most peculiar.
"There is. We sell them for a small fee of 2 galleons. Here, the glamour is in the stone." Griphook handed Harry a gold pendant with a brilliant blue stone. It was simple enough and could easily be hidden under his shirt.
The man working just smiled, glad Harry liked it so much, and told Snape the rest of the order would be ready in a few hours.
Narcissa gave her husband the same look as before.
I don't think that information would have changed in the last, oh, fifteen seconds." Harry snarked at his professor. He spotted the blond aristocrat coming up behind Snape and really cursed his lack of luck at that moment.
"I thought he wanted a truce anyway." Harry said confused.
It wasn't until a little later that his door was pulled open roughly by his uncle that he cared.
So, yeah. Hope you guys liked it.
Plus is guaranteed as little loss of life as possible. No use letting magical blood to waste when it was entirely unnecessary.
Harry grabbed his wand.
"He has made little progress my Lord. I have been instructing him, but have not delved any deeper into his mind that to read the surface emotions. I... I did not wish to pry where I wasn't trusted yet, and he has yet to ask me." Severus didn't show it, but he was sure both Lucius and the Dark Lord likely saw he was hurt by the idea.
"Don't you roll your eyes at me young man or else." Sev said in a rather annoyed tone. There were a few things that set off Sevs annoyed dad persona. Rolling your eyes and shrugging being the top two followed quickly by cursing.
Harry wasn't sure how long after that it took to lose the Weasleys, but he managed eventually and afterward went home to relish the peace and quiet.
Wait. Godsons.
Harry was feeling some kind of way. He hadn't decided if he was more angry, disappointed, or flabbergasted. Maybe he was feeling all three at once. He wasn't entirely sure, but the last two weeks since he had moved into Potter manor had him completely overwhelmed.
"Mint, please take Severus to his usual room. Clover, if you could take young Harry to the blue guest room please. Rose, do alert Marvolo as well as the kitchen elves that our guests have arrived and that Draco is home." Narcissa delegated with skill.
Voldemort calls Snape and they have a chat.
"Alright there Scar Head?" A voice in the void of his mind called out, dragging him from his depressing thoughts.
"I'm home." He whispered as the doors swung open for him, and he was greeted by the head elf.
The headmaster had a long white beard and longer white hair, and he wore brightly colored robes. He gazed down at the new students through half moon specticals and he had this look about him that seemed too contemplative. The man seemed detatched almost.
"And eat or drink nothing that the headmaster gives you without testing it for potions or other enchantments. Have at least two professors with you while speaking with the headmaster. Try to never be alone with him. Yes Grandfather I remember." Harry interrupted.
"Yeah go get it then." And Ron tossed it as hard as he could at the castle wall
Turns out it's rather easy. Sharing his toys and things with Draco was fun and the two were running about the large room hiding and finding each other and starting a game they made up on the spot where if the other caught you, you'd have to do something silly.
Both boys nodded.
"Unfortunately that would be difficult. He's set up shop at the Manor. Unless you figured out how to kill the bastard for good, it might be safer to go about as is. I do want you to do me a favor though. Off something does happen to me, make sure Cissa and Draco get these." Draco handed Fudge two letters one addressed to his wife and ther to his son.
"Oh, good. You all made it alright. Lucius and Marvolo were both incredibly worried for you three." Narcissa Malfoy came into the parlor, greeting them all with a worried air.
"Come in." He called and while he loved his godson, he was a bit sad to see Harry was not with him. It only made him vow to get Harry either off the regular team or at least get Wood to stop these insane practice times. Even the older students were starting to get burnt out.
"No need for ink dear. That's a special quill you see." The woman did
Severus knew Harry was likely to be extremely uncomfortable, but could do nothing to soothe him at the moment. He was terrible at being comforting, and considering the situation, it would be up to the Dark Lord to prove that he meant Harry no harm over time.
"I can do this all night, you may as well come back out." Umbridge called.
"I'll teach you to joke about that." Pansy then proceded to tickle Harry senseless.
"Yes, master. All will be as you say when you return. We will bring the manor back to its former glory." Mifty answered.
The boys both blushed crimson as they ran the rest of the way down, and marched to the ballroom at Malfoy Manor.
At least Draco was easier to decipher.
Many of the children had taken Potters lead from the start of the semester and had begun to veer away from Dumbledore. She didn't even really need to do much.
That wench has been..... Severus, you know I don't say this lightly, but if what Dumbledore has said about He-who-must-not-be-named returning is true, does that mean you are spying again?" The nurse asked as she busied herself with the unrecognizable gash that tore deeply into Harrys hand.
His manners. Oh yes, Harry had gone over etiquette books in the library with his grandfathers portrait. Charlus Potter was an absolute gift, trying to help his grandson fit the mold of a young lord in a short a time as possible. The man was charming and kind, but also aristocratic in a way. He was somehow both formal and casual at the same time somehow and Harry soaked up everything he could from the man.
So far, Harry though the whole thing made sense and was really glad for Lucius who was patiently explaining this for him.
According to Griphook, nothing in that account should have been touched. Even his magical guardian (Dumbledore) shouldn't have been able to touch anything without his say so. That said, when they went over them, Griphook noticed that the interest wasn't right. Keeping in mind that the interest was quite a lot of gold to begin with, it seemed odd to Griphook that the percentage was wrong. Harry was grandfathered into ((pun slightly intended)) a certain percentage after so many generations. The percentage of interest was higher for Harry since the account was originally opened back in the ancient days.
That could solve the worst of the problem. Voldemort alone could probably defeat Dumbledore alone with how weak he seemed lately, but the entire auror force without his henchman.... possible but unlikely.
"You dared use a highly illegal dark artifact on the students of this school? How many more times do you think you could have obliviated him. Had I known this is what he meant by writing lines, you would have been dead a month ago. As it is, I can't do much but I can do this." Snape spelled some kind of charm onto the womans bracelet.
This was not the scene Harry prefered though. Harry liked the years previous where he and Draco celebrated together a week after Dracos birthday and 2 weeks before his and exchanged gifts in the comfort of friends and family.
Indeed Professor McGonagall had arrived and was giving the group a stern but amused look.
"I really hate to break up the beautiful moment, but if you linger any longer you will be late to dinner Severus. No need to make the old man any more suspicious now." Lucius stood in the doorway looking far to smug to not have interrupted at that moment on purpose.
"Harry....." The warning in his grandfathers voice had Harry standing from the desk to take the aforementioned break before the man had Miffty bring out the sashes again.
Is Draco right about there being something wrong with our boy hero?
Seriously, Molly was gaining more and more of her respect by the second.
Narcissa is a beautiful character when given half the chance. Her experiences and expectations growing up were always something I thought shaped her. But she's also an intellegent and cunning person herself. I wanted to delve a bit into what that meant for her growing up and how that turned her into the woman she became. What would happen if after so long she finally let's go of everything she was forced to believe was important and just let her instincts and natural intelligence guide her, rather than her parents and husband.
"Is that so? Well then. If Molly is alright with it, I'll stand by it, it's the others that'll be hard to convince though. That said off I go. Good luck dearest, I reckon you'll need it. Welcome Mrs Malfoy. I suspect well speak more at length later." Arther spoke quickly and though animated all in one tone, a skill all its own for sure, before taking the floo assumably to the ministry for work to keep up appearances.
"I'm sure he'd like that very much." Narcissa said with a small motherly smile.
He would help Harry recover, whether Harry wanted him to or not.
Someone tell me they can feel the tension I'm putting between Harry and Draco. It feels like I am but also not sure if its angsty enough either....
Well I hope it was worth the wait. I hope you guys like it. Let me know what you think.
Yes the young Prince of Slytherin was definately in for it once in the common room. Not that he had many answeres for them.
When the day came though to board the train, Harry was immediately overwhelmed. The sheer number of people was unnecessarily claustrophobic despite there being plenty of room since people still felt the need to walk so close as to bump into him.
Draco had never seen such fury and it frankly scared him.
Once his outer robe was fastened he had no other means of wasting time, yet still he lingered, really not wanting to face the public.
Harry and Hermione were standing with Draco and the others and Ron was glaring in their general direction.
Umbridge had come around the corner and had laid the detention on him and when he tried to tell her the truth of what happened, she had called him a dirty, filthy liar and that she was ashamed that he would do such a thing.
Lucius was apparently free around dinner, choosing to spend the morning with Severus and lunch time with Draco. He had even made a snide comment about Severus being a 'disgustingly early riser' and how he would really rather they all got along so he could just get it over with in one conversation.
"What is this? What are you doing here?" Umbridge had come out of her shock, her accusitory voice reminding Harry very much of Petunia.
"Sorry Draco. Even on your birthday they won't leave me alone." Harry said sadly as yet another ministry person, some lady wearing all pink (who frankly looked annoying before even speaking), left unsatisfied as Draco had to politely tell her to buzz off.
He sat at the other end of the table, clearly separated from Ron and Hermione. The entire hall was staring at his except Draco who couldn't look at him without blushing now. And cute as it was Harry understood he had a reputation to maintain.
But he had never given in. He hadn't given the toad the satisfaction. And it payed off.
He did notice Lucius come in and gather Draco from the Slytherin table and leave. The man nodded in his direction in greeting, which Harry returned, before leaving again, Draco in tow.
"Yes, I do believe we have finally had a break through. I'm sure you'll behave from now on. I do wish you hadn't forced me to obliviate you every time, but I just can't have you reporting me. Still, just to be sure, I think one more session on Tuesday will drive it home. You can't be too careful you know." It was just as Umbridge had finished her little monologue that the first drop of blood dripped down his hand and landed on the floor next to his bag.
If he could fix it and lead the death eaters to it. There could be aurors waiting for them. The Dark Lord was banking on the final battle in order to seal his win over Dumbledore. He planned for Draco to fail his mission so obviously he could punish the Malfoy family, and his mothers betrayal wouldn't help matters. But, he could lead them into a trap.
"But you see, it is. I am banking of you winning this bloody war, and if we are going to survive it then whatever has that defeated look you are always sporting needs to stop being a problem. And I intend to make that happen." Draco said, stamping his foot for good measure, reminding Harry of a petulant child not getting to play with a toy. It was more than a little adorable and Harry couldn't help but chuckle a bit.
"..... I know but if Potter fails we all die. You know as well as I Severus. He must be ready." That sounded a lot like Malfoy senior. Thank Merlin Harry was wondering after hours with the invisibility cloak tonight or he'd have walked right by Snape while musing.
"By the way Potter, the wardrobe update is much approved. You look good in green." Draco said as he left to follow his father.
No one deemed it necessary to tell him about the blood quill and since Delores was obliviated of the entire event, she wasn't saying anything about it.
Severus landed in the Dark Lords meeting room. Sure enough there was Lucius. Although first things first.
"No you're just too short sighted. I didn't even want to be in this house. But no, I got stuck rooming with a loud mothed, ignorant, hate mongering red head. So shove your opinions where it hurts and bloody leave me alone." Harry replied almost calmly before leaving the common room to find his father. Surely Sev would know what to do.
Lucious entered the Minister of Magics office. Fudge was next to useless with the actual war, but he made a good go between for the Order of the Pheonix and the old coot Dumbledore. No it wasnt a lie that he didn't like the old headmaster (always seemed to know too much with that stupid twinkle in his eye that never failed to make you wonder what you were missing).
It was later that night, curfew not really allowing him to avoid it any longer, that Draco found himself trying to escape his friends.
"Why didn't you believe me?" Harry finally asked, looking up just enough to see their faces but refusing to meet their eyes.
We all know what happens with Wood so I am skipping it.
"Not a clue. Safehouse of some kind, I'd wager. I was sent on the train with the Wealeys and Potter before Mother was told where it was. Thats provided of course there even is a safehouse and Mother isnt at their hovel." Draco sneered. He couldnt help it. The thought of his mother dressed like Molly Weasley living and a hovel like that was enough to make him feel ill.
They never reached the door that had held fluffy, as that was at the end of the hall, but instead stopped at another door.
Draco sat down, just as the trolly lady came through. They both ordered a few snacks, Harry getting a few Ice Mice and Sugar Quills while Draco got a few chocolate frogs and a box of Bertie bots every flavor beans. When she left Harry closed the door to their compartment.
"I'm not sure, but I intend to find out. I will need to excersize more caution this upcoming school year. If Potter does start to pull away from the headmaster, then I may try to speak to him. It would be nice to speak to my other godson without the ruse of hating him. It is becoming exhausting." Snape admitted to his friend.
"Give it back Ron." Harry said, looking seriously at Ron.
"Come now boys, dinner is ready." Mrs. Malfoy said kindly in the sweet motherly way she did.
"It's ok guys, I got this." Harry whispered lifting off into the air. He wobbled a bit but quickly had his balance.
"The stone is here? Thats what you got from Gringots isnt it?" Harry figured.
Time to visit the goblins at the bank again. He had spent nearly all of his last break at the bank, pouring over the estate his parents had left him, fixing Dumbledores meddling with his accounts and figuring out how to manage it all. And for a fee, as expected, he was taught all this by the goblins themselves. What they couldn't teach him they offered books (also for a fee).
"Flamel? Why does that name sound familiar?" Hermione asked, mostly to herself but loud enough to hear.
"This will do. Do start supper, the boy appears half starved and I have no doubt we will have a long road ahead of us getting him to full health." Mr Snape replied and the thing snapped its fingers and was gone with another pop.
"Yeah well if your dad could stop inviting more people than what fits in the ball room I'd be more likely to stay. But I dont much care for the idea of getting squished by heavy gowns and gold tipped shoes. Thanks ever so." Harry elegantly (not) switched topics.
And the feud continues.
After the first term however, he had seemingly gone back to normal.
"Honestly, we have been looking everywhere for you. Where have you been? The headmaster has been trying to get a hold of you for weeks now. You should be ashamed of yourself running off on your poor family like you have." Molly ranted.
Draco beamed at him with a huge grin, which was more than a little infectious. Harry smiled back more shyly.
Both Draco and Severus had been forced to return to their classes and so it was up to Lucius to explain their absense.
just call him 'dear'. Just ugh.
Indeed, there were no cobwebs or creepy shadows. The corridor was brightly lit, with a plush running carpet down the middle. The statues that had creeped him out as a first year were now almost tasteful. Funny what a duster and a bit of light will do for a place.
"A marriage contract? Between the Potters and Malfoys? I had no idea. And no one had a daughter or breeder in the family after that? That makes no statistical sense." Harry said, keeping up the random conversation.
We are really getting into the tea now.
"Hello Draco. Shall I assume you created a privacy bubble again." Harry really didn't need to ask. Draco had begun to talk to him, if he was found alone, over the last month.
As promised, when Harry asked, Dimsy was more than happy to get more juice for him and seemed genuinely glad Harry wasn't scared of her anymore.
"But Sev, this whole thing is foolish, even for him." Draco had gotten out of the habit of calling Severus 'uncle', but refused to stop calling him Sev purely out of habit.
Indeed, as he started, reddish brown ink flowed from the quills tip. However his writing hand was getting very itchy.
Either way, here they were, about to knock on the door to number 4 Privet Drive when the loud sounds of yelling were heard.
Tonight the tides of the war would change one way or the other. Of that, all three were certain.
The front entrance had a tall three story cieling with a parlor on the right and a large entry room to the left.
"Bugger off Weasley. Im not exactly thrilled with this either." Draco shot back.
Snape Estate was honestly huge. Harry thought he could get lost.
If nothing was forth coming at the next 'lesson' Harry was bound to do something he would regret. That said, his occlumency was coming along nicely. No more creepy dreams from the creepy half snake dark demon lord or whatever Voldy was calling himself lately, ta ever so, no nosed git.
So, a short chapter tonight, but still important. Next time though we will start getting into the war part of the story.
Even if Sev had served the Dark Lord in the past, why would he now after losing his mind and killing innocent people, Harrys parents included?
"Yeah but his magic is off on another level. The Griffindors may be able to help you get over being shy around others." Gregory Goyle was a nice enough bloke though he didn't say much. Neither did Vincent Crabbe but still nice enough.
"Technically one of them is. I can see it now. Little Malfoy-Potter-Prince babies running around. That is a mouthful though. Maybe one title each. Hogwarts will fall, the world will burn..." Lucius joked.
"Of course not. Whoever it was though was obviously a genius. Bloddy hilarious." Ron said chuckling. Just about everyone save a few of the gryffindors all were a bit disgusted by Rons behavior.
On the other hand, Harry was actually a little daunted by what would apparently be his new home. Mr Severous Snape was his new guardian and apparently he was fairly well off.
The potions were getting to Severus as well, since that particular potion was becoming more and more frequently brewed. He couldn't figure why so many students were suddenly anemic.
He had even earned house points. Only two, but from Snape it felt like a hundred.
Still Harry stood up straighter and took a pinch of floo powder and set off.
Indeed the day seemed to both crawl and move too quickly. He dreaded the detention that was to come tonight, and he was sure that Umbridge was going to send him back to the hospital wing as she always seemed to.
(See the end of the chapter for
As it was, he joined the golden trio and the red head clan in a larger compartment to figure out what the heck everyone made of this entire situation.
Harry had been tortured with a blood quill for a month, right under his nose, and he had chosen to not believe Harry when he said he had no idea.
"No worries. I'm prepared for a bit of backlash. I'll not appologize for standing by my, though I'm aware of the atrocities that came with. I didn't care because my job was never to steer my husband away from anything only support his choices. At first it want that horrid either. Lord Voldemort preached how he would return the wizarding world to the wizards and wanted to purify our race and traditions once again, but just like last time, things got out of hand. I was relieved when Voldemort vanished since my soon was born by then and I didn't want him to grow up as a killer as his father and i had become. Life went back to normal and i raised my child to be a proud traditional pureblood as expected, but then He came back and ruined everything. Now i don't care. I don't care if thefamily line dies and I don't care if is tainted and i don't care if i die trying, but by Merlin I will save my son." Narcissa, in a desperate moment of clarity, became far more outspoken than she had been since her school days.
With that though Harry nodded to them both and slipped back under his cloak and walked away. He heard Snape and Malfoy call out for him, but he had long since learned to walk silently when he wanted to.
"Your faces were hilarious." Harry said between fitss of giggles.
"We learn it early on at school. It's part of the first week curriculum in charms." Harry answered, trying to make peace as the girl, Hermione, made a face at Dracos attitude.
The boys broke out in laughter just as Severous and Narcissa walked into Dracos room.
That meant he was a horcrux. Harry really wished he could bring himself to be bothered about this more. That doesn't mean that a certain headmaster wouldn't be hearing it from him when he saw him next.
Severus felt absolutely awful. He felt completely responsible for the state Harry was in. Of course Harry couldn't tell them what was wrong if he was constantly having his mind wiped of the whole thing. This explained his being suddenly anemic also.
He wrote a simple missive to his father.
Weird.
And for the first time, Harry kind of missed his old friends. He almost wished he could go back and forget about everything he had learned. Puppets don't feel pain like this after all.
"Not our fault you are too shy to tell them to push off. Besides....." Their soon to be argument was cut off by the door opening. Theyd been to engrossed to notice the train had begun moving but the door basically slammed open.
Harry was currently hiding behind one of the desks in the farthest corner of the room from where Umbridge was.
I am stoked that I get to write this. It may be slow going but I dont think it will go too terribly long, only time will tell.
"Harry! There you are!" The voice of one Molly Weasley called out in the crowd. And sure enough, the entire clan was out with her, looking innocently like they had been buying their own school supplies even though Harry knew from experience they always went the same day the letters went out as long as it wasn't too late in the day. The letter had sat on his own desk for more than a week now.
Harrys head hit the desk again.
Suddenly there came a knock on the door.
If anyone was more shy or jumpy than Harry, it was Nevel Longbottom. Harry felt genuinely bad as he watched the trembling boy mount his broom silently.
He was in a really bad spot for this.
Maybe he shouldn't have gone easy on Harry with occlumency either. Had he delved even a bit further he would have sensed the obliviates in Harrys mind. So many opportunities to help him lost because he was trying to be gentle with a type of magic that was known for its abrasiveness. He was a master, of course Harry couldn't feel it if he was being gentle about it.
"Of course. We can talk at length once the children are settled. Were you looking for a place to hide out?" Molly asked, ever the optimist despite probably being the fiercest member of the large family.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You are trying. That is what counts. And for what it's worth, you are forgiven. That is not, however, what I wished to speak to you about. I am curious about your choice in proxy. The wizengamot will begin the years season again and you need to pick someone soon. Have you given it any thought?" Lucius asked right out of the gate as Miffty served tea. A green tea with lilac and ginger that tasted amazing with just a splash of cream.
Ron, who Hermione wanted to hex at this point, was again berating Harry about how Malfoys been lying when he said hed switched sides. Quite loudly. Harry seemed lost in thought and wasn't paying much mind.
It was only ten minuets later that Lucious announced the party was moving on and things began to move as everyone scattered to enjoy further conversation in the gardens while the family and closer friends and very few others stayed to see the gift opening.
Harry removed it to find his family ring.
The first shop they went into was clearly for clothes though. Harry thought the idea of new clothes was interesting and he stood still while his measurements were taken and Snape proceded to buy him an entire new wardrobe. The man behind the counter gave him a sad look and asked if they were willing to wait abou 15 min and he could have the first one made so Harry could get out of the baggy 'muggle' clothes. Snape agreed and Harry was treated to see a bunch of fabric and needles and pins and thread lifted into the air all by themselves and started to fold, snip, stitch, and seam itself together with no real effort.
"No. After everything that's happened, I have made sure that you can no longer control me. Go find some other Golden Boy or whatever. I quit." With that Harry turned to leave. Harry may not have made an entrance, but he made an exit for sure. He was up in the tower, changed for bed, curtains spelled closed and silent, before he sighed and lay down for sleep.
Hermione was beginning to think actually talking with the Slytherins was the only clue they were going to get. Besides, if Draco was on their side now, it only made sense that most of Slytherin house was as well.
"By Merlin just take the boy to dinner, talk politics to your hearts content. I don't care. Just leave my classroom you great buffoon, lest I sick Narci on you." Snape jested back.
"And what have we here? Snape was looking menacingly at the blood flowing from his mates right hand. The unhealable cut on his hand suddenly made sense.
Looking over, he saw Potter grinning at him happily, causing ... A feeling, of sorts. Regardless Draco blushed and looked away quickly. Ugh what even was wrong with that guy?
Still, he had to look unaffected by it all.
"Sorry Mother. May Harry and I go there instead?" He corrected.
"Hey mate. Where you aiming for?" Ron said from behind Harry clearly addressing him.
Harrys head fell onto his new desk, ruffling a few parchments.
She immediately pulled her son into a tight hug while cooing at him.
This just made Harry wonder about these people though. Who offers their children to marry if they don't think the spouse would be mature or responsible? The arranged marriage part didn't bother him so much as he had thought it might, but seriously, he would never arrange his own children to marry people he thought wouldn't be responsible and take care of them. It just didn't seem right to him.
Harry paled a bit, but nodded resolutely. The last encounter he had with a certain Dark Lord running on repeat in his mind. Of course there was no portkey to get out of danger with should this whole thing go belly up.
"Well met Lord Malfoy." Charlus answered.
WHY in Merlins name was he LAUGHING like NOTHING was WRONG?
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was sore everywhere. He was so tired most nights that he passed out before 8pm most nights.
"Iam more than a little aware of that, but we also need to make sure we perform the ritual correctly. Even with the stone it could go wrong. He is himself as a spirit but you know what he was like before. We need his sanity to come back with him as well. Now leave, I will do my part but I'll not risk cutting corners at the risk of our Lords mind." Severous replied.
"Most only sense the change in their destined mate. Harrison, if your mate or mates were male, it would answer the question of your breeder status without needing an appointment." Harrys grandfather appeared in the empty portrait above the parlor mantle.
But that didn't make sense.
"So I'm Potter again am I? See you never
