Draco nodded, grateful that he had chanced upon the correct Weasley. “Yes, I would, thank you. Shall I wait here, then?”
Fortunately, the same tawny owl returned just as he was about to leave the house, and Draco eagerly dove at the attached scrawl, unrolling it with shaking fingers.
“On the contrary, Harry,” Draco snickered. “You’ve demonstrated multiple times that you know exactly what ‘suck’ means.”
Harry studied his face closely. He disagreed; Draco was unquestionably the constellation more often than not. But that didn’t seem like something he should say.
“I know,” Draco muttered. “But they’re not exactly on the greatest of terms with me. What if they never accept us? What if they never believe that I’m good enough for you?”
“Look, Draco,” Harry said, meeting his eyes. “We don’t have to have sex tonight. Or ever, if it’s not what you want. I’m certainly not expecting anything. Believe it or not, I didn’t write you that letter as some plot to get you into bed with me, and… well, honestly, it kind of sucks that you think I’m just looking to shag you.”
But dammit all, he was too appealing! Must he always run his hands through his hair like that? Must those confounded jeans hug his arse in such a perfect way? And oh, Merlin, he couldn’t even get started on how maddeningly endearing Harry was with Rose. How on earth was Draco supposed to resist such a fit man when he was with a baby? The pair of them painted such an adorable image that, for a moment there, Draco had nearly cried at the sight of it.
“We’re not having sex,” Harry murmured into his lips. “But I want to jerk you off. I fucking need to.”
He took a pair of socks, a smart blue v-neck jumper and a pair of his most casual grey trousers out of his wardrobe and pulled them on, and then he kissed the top of Harry’s head one more time, just because he could. He quietly left the room and closed the bedroom door behind him as he made his way down the small hallway, running his fingers through his damp hair as he went.
Draco couldn’t help the snort that escaped, but Harry was laughing along with him. “Like I said, it’s dumb.”
Draco laughed out loud and leaned down to kiss Harry as thoroughly as he knew how. Harry leaned up on his knees and, as always, kissed him back until Draco had no breath left in him. Finally he pulled Harry up onto the couch beside him.
Ron didn’t seem suspicious, only a little confused. He gestured at a short wooden stool tucked underneath the desk in front of Draco.
He was speaking as casually as if he was reading his grocery list aloud, completely unaware that every word was a sledgehammer to Draco’s walls.
She placed his teacup on the ledge of the fire pit in front of him. “No, athletics have never been my forte. Aside from my strong arm, of course.”
The foyer was hardly big enough to accommodate the two of them, and Harry was entirely too close for his liking, so Draco swiftly sidled over a bit as he watched Harry survey his sitting room.
“Then I suppose I’ll have no other choice but to force it out of you,” Malfoy replied, grinning at him. “And Merlin knows Slytherins have little patience for impertinent, rude liars.”
Draco laughed. “Harry Potter, despite your desperately long list of faults, I think you’re the most magnificent specimen on God’s green earth. And if I don’t make raucous love to you soon, I might run mad.”
day life; there was certainly a limit to how much Weasley he could handle, after all. Though he had to admit to himself that the evening had been rather nice, all things considered. This Granger-Weasley bunch wasn’t so bad, really. He and Weasley had fallen into a mysteriously comforting back-and-forth of good-natured insults, Rose was an absolute angel, and even Hermione had warmed up to him as dinner progressed. And Harry… well, he was Harry. How strange it was that spending time with his former enemies should bring him a sense of belonging for possibly the first time in his life.
“Oh bollocks,” Harry laughed. “I can’t decide if that’s the cutest thing you’ve ever said, or if I want it obliviated from your memory forever.”
“My former comments still stand,” Draco muttered, tapping his quill against his lip. “Anyways, my tastes have changed since then.”
Harry. Had that really danced so effortlessly into his thoughts? After all, whatever else they were to each other, Harry had started out as his boyhood enemy, and later, just the subject of a piece he was writing for work. And yet, somewhere along the way, Draco really had begun to think of him that way. His.
PS: May I presume that you will be buying the first round, as you have so rudely deprived me of my wand for four years? You know, in the spirit of not making things awkward?
Harry held his hands up as if to deflect the question. “Absolutely nothing, actually. You dress very nicely.”
Draco swallowed. “I’m meeting with him again tomorrow evening, and potentially his mates in the next couple of weeks, though they’ve not yet confirmed.”
“I mean, I know Harry isn’t short for anything,” Harry continued, trying to formulate a halfway workable answer. “But you’re right, James is for my dad, obviously. I think I remember Sirius telling me I was named after my great-grandfather on my dad’s side, but I guess I don’t know for sure. Can’t really ask anyone now, can I?”
He came up close behind Harry and ran a hand affectionately down his bare back, resting his chin on the top of Harry’s shoulder. His body was hard and smooth and warm and… Merlin, completely mouthwatering. Draco smelled his own soap and body lotion on Harry’s skin, and while he missed Harry’s normal smell, it still made his heart sing.
“Don’t fucking stop, Harry,” Draco demanded in a strangled whisper, tangling his fingers through Harry’s hair and pushing his head back down where it belonged. “Just… go slow, alright?”
“Don’t forget Mr Potter,” Harry reminded him facetiously, ignoring the tingle in his stomach at the sound of his name on Draco’s lips.
She folded her arms across her chest and finally said, in a surprisingly concerned voice, “That was a hell of a curse you took.”
“Just what I said,” Draco smiled. “You’re always so positive and upbeat and good-natured, but at times, when I look at you, it’s like you’re still carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”
“You’re projecting your own misguided self-loathing onto me and you’re assuming that’s the reason I didn’t tell them.”
Draco smirked at him, a flutter of excitement blooming in his chest. He truthfully couldn’t remember the last time anyone had asked him about himself, let alone looked so eager for an answer.
“I love you, too, Harry,” he muttered through a smile. “Now let’s go, before you’re late, because undoubtedly your house needs more tidying than you’re anticipating. And don’t forget you have to change the bedsheets in your guest room for Teddy before you pick him up.”
“It’s not my fault you’re dressed for summer,” Harry teasingly repeated his earlier words back to him, aiming a casual chin-up gesture at the jacket hanging uselessly over Draco’s arm. He could tell Harry was fighting off a grin.
That being said, it was frankly impossible not to notice--and appreciate--Potter’s striking good looks. Draco may have learned to be non-judgemental over the years, but Merlin, he was not blind: Harry Potter had aged like a damn fine wine.
He quickly pushed himself up from the couch, fetched his wand from the kitchen floor, grabbed his beer off the coffee table and migrated to the armchair. There, now Potter would be a few feet away at least. It might help.
“Hey,” Harry said, his voice full of anxiety, “don’t be stupid. Just tell me what’s the matter. You’re scaring me.”
“Fuck… I’m sorry, Harry,” he said, and his voice was so soft that Harry felt another lump rising in his throat. “I’m obviously very, very bad at this.”
He continued with his defense. “I will ensure that I don’t have a single responsibility on my plate except for this story for the next several weeks, and I will put my entire soul into it. You have my word on that, ma’am.”
Draco wasn’t entirely sure, however, how to put into words what he was feeling--nothing out of the norm there--so he simply sighed.
“Ron’s giving Rose her bath,” Harry explained, observing Malfoy’s ever-graceful movements. “And Hermione’s still not back from work.”
“You called me a wanker within three minutes of not one but both of our meetings thus far,” he began.
Harry’s tongue drifted lower and licked up and down Draco’s arse, surprising him only a little, since Harry had only done this once before. He silently thanked every deity that he had showered only a short while earlier.
Harry glanced up from his journal, did a double-take, and blanched; that immaculate head of white-blonde hair could only belong to one person.
Harry stumbled back a step and ran his hands through his messy hair. They were having another baby? Why hadn’t they told him? Because of his feelings… but which feelings exactly?
“And Harry,” she said tentatively, “maybe… maybe talking about everything would be cathartic for you. It might even do you a world of good.”
“Yes, I do, but this one’s not so awful,” Draco said, still gazing at him curiously as he stepped forward and sat down next to him. “After all, how often do I get to witness the Chosen One admitting that he was wrong?”
Draco felt as though he had been confunded as Harry took a swig from the beer bottle. His eyes never left Draco’s, and Draco could hardly breathe. He physically could not look away. He felt like his body had turned to jelly. Merlin help him if he tried to stand up now, because he knew he would fall flat on his arse.
Draco glanced down and realized he still had the grey throw blanket draped over his shoulders like a cape.
Draco stepped out of the fireplace with all of his usual grace, and finally, Harry registered that his face was stony and ashen. All of his worry instantaneously increased tenfold.
“I am serious, Potter,” Draco said, a little affronted. “We obviously had some latent attraction to each other, even then.”
But as he grew older and did eventually join that world, he was disenchanted not only with the dull company, but by the ridiculous duplicity of it all. Draco eventually found that he didn’t quite agree with the seemingly universal opinions that they tried to coerce him into. He was terrified to think how close they had come to succeeding.
“Potter thinks I’m a good writer?” he whispered, humiliated that that was the one fact his shocked mind chose to cling to.
“Stop being so fucking nice to me, Harry Potter,” Draco said, his voice coming out quieter than he had anticipated.
When he opened his eyes again, Harry was standing in front of him, and he had his hand over his mouth, once again looking like he was barely stifling a laugh.
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly as he tried to process Harry’s words; they hit a little too close to home. He wasn’t sure if he should be insulted or flattered, but as it happened, he was a good amount of both.
She gazed at him curiously. “A lot has changed since Hogwarts, Draco. You may be surprised at the amount of empathy people might have for you now.”
Hermione didn’t respond, and Draco took a sip of tea. He tapped his quill against his lip and sighed, trying to regroup. He had expected to feel a wave of familiar self-loathing this evening, but he wasn’t prepared to be so completely overrun by it.
Draco was suddenly flooded with shameful memories of how he had treated Grimby in his youth, and of all the horrors the old elf had been a victim to when the Dark Lord had taken over the Manor. Draco stopped himself from extending a pitiful olive branch and asking after Grimby’s health, as he knew it would only lead to consequences for the house elf if he was caught fraternizing with the Master’s son.
Draco once again forced himself to count to five and take a deep breath. He was losing grip and he realized that he needed to regain some equilibrium before he spun out of control again. He had known from the beginning that he couldn’t think clearly when Potter was around him; he never had been able to. When it came to Harry, he was completely and utterly helpless. He felt as if he was on a runaway train that kept gaining speed.
“Three weeks as of last night,” Harry said softly, his head tilting to the side. “Any complaints so far, Malfoy?”
Draco leapt up from the couch when Harry started to reach for his hands, and he began pacing, running his hands through his hair. He tried hard to calm his erratic breathing.
“Although, even children have some control over their behavior,” Potter muttered into his butterbeer. “Despite how they were raised.”
Yet something about Draco made it easy to give him the benefit of the doubt. Trusting him suddenly felt effortless, even to Harry, for whom trust never came easily these days.
“Well I need you to be less calm!” he answered nonsensically, and as odd as it was, it made Draco smile.
Harry grinned back at him. Merlin’s pants, Draco really was adorable, and there were no two ways about it. Harry didn’t know how anyone could be so well-spoken after a night at the bloody pub, but then, this was Malfoy, after all.
Harry didn’t say anything, but his eyes were fixed on Draco as he stirred the sauce with his back to the three of them.
Draco was feeling warm and happy as he beheld his surroundings on this warm early-June evening. Despite living fairly close by, he couldn’t remember the last time he had simply strolled down the road and enjoyed the atmosphere.
“Point taken,” he conceded, crossing his legs. “I suppose I’ve fancied him since I was around fourteen, though my feelings were largely nothing more than infatuation. Obviously I never acted on them, until he reached out to me a few weeks ago.”
“It’s done anyway,” Ron assured them. “Just needs a few more minutes to let the flavors mingle, and a touch less heat. And obviously a more faithful stirrer.”
Draco took a deep breath. He needed to tell Harry what he was feeling again. It felt scary, but not as scary as it had before.
Draco peered down at his list of questions to avoid the glare of it, and he decided now was the time to ask this next one.
“Because you never really lied to me,” Harry told him. “You were mean to me, but at least you were always honest.”
Draco sighed. “It was a pureblood marriage, arranged for us by our parents when we were teenagers and put into effect as soon as they felt we were old enough. The wizarding world had next to no interest in us Malfoys at the time, so our wedding flew under the radar in most circles, and we managed to escape a lot of public gossip as a result.”
Harry glanced at the old grandfather clock propped up against the wall of his bedroom: 2:37. That ruled out his local pub, then. He stroked his prickly chin for a moment, weighing his options, until inspiration finally struck.
She peered back at Draco with curious blue eyes for several silent seconds, and then he was rewarded with an angelic smile. He smiled back without a second thought; honestly, he thought his heart was about to split open, she was so precious. He reached for one of the throw blankets and flung it around Rose’s shoulders.
“No particularly bad incidents, no,” Draco replied. “Though, ever since I was assigned to the Potter feature--pardon me, Harry, to
Draco chuckled. “Yes, do that. You feel a little warm; better take the day. Plus it would be more fun to wank with you in the room.”
Draco ignored the disturbing chill of fear in his spine and held Harry closer. “It was a nightmare, sweetheart. Only a nightmare.”
“Things changed for me, too,” Draco said, so quietly that he was surprised Harry heard him, but he must have, because he turned to slowly face him again.
“Hey, I like to be comfortable,” Harry objected, turning away as he continued folding up the blanket. Under Draco’s appraisal, he suddenly felt shy… and overheated. “And I happen to think these jeans look good on me.”
Harry smiled at him, but it was another shy smile, one that made Draco second-guess every one of his principles.
“You know me,” Draco repeated, realizing how true it was as he stared deep into those liquid emerald eyes. “All the vicious remarks, all the cowardice, all the insecurity. Every failure, every shortcoming, every betrayal. You know all of it. You know… me. Better than anyone. You have no idea how disheartening that can feel at times.”
“Well, they have for me, anyway,” Harry grumbled. “I suppose I should go, now that I’ve said my piece and can officially die from humiliation.”
“Alright, we’re all here now,” Hermione said, coming down the hallway before Harry could analyze his feelings further. “My apologies, Draco, we’ve been deplorable hosts.”
“Of course I wish,” Harry replied, standing up and dragging a chair over so that he was sitting across from Draco, close enough that their knees were not only touching, but sandwiching each other. “But only if you want to.”
“I’ve thought about us fucking in public,” Harry continued, stroking his cock furiously. “Going out late at night, and before we head home, you pull me into a back alley that’s not even all that secluded, and you pull my trousers down and turn me around and fuck my arse, hard and fast, before we get caught.”
Draco wanted to laugh at him, but he knew that one wrong move would destroy the bubble of trust that he’d spent the last few days building with Harry.
“Do you really want my stream-of-consciousness thoughts?” Harry laughed. “I think that might be what scares you away for good.”
“Are you hard?” Draco blurted out before he could think better of it, staring deep into his astonishingly green eyes.
“Mmm,” Harry murmured once again, flopping like a fish onto his back and kicking haphazardly at the blankets until he was finally partially covered. “That’s so much better.”
Harry’s hands had stilled on Draco’s back. It was silent for a long moment, so long that Draco was suddenly a little afraid that he had put Harry to sleep.
“When have I ever been able to ignore you?” Harry muttered. “For that matter, when have you ever been
Draco nodded to himself. It wasn’t an earth-shattering response, but it was… well, quite nice, all things considered. Potter enjoyed spending time with him, then. Draco had been fairly sure it wasn’t one-sided, but it was nice to have it confirmed all the same.
“I am, actually,” he replied. “I have a ton of writing to do. And anyway, I have a meeting with my editor to discuss what happened tonight.”
“I’m sure you could, if you tried hard enough,” Draco replied. “I bet you could visualize me doing a great many things, Potter.”
“You’ve missed having a cock in your arsehole, haven’t you?” Draco asked, any remaining nerves entirely dissipating as he watched the sheets ruffling between them. Their legs were still touching; Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body against his.
“No,” Harry interrupted, reaching out to him before evidently thinking better of it and pulling his hand back. “I’m the one who should be apologizing. You’re right. You’re absolutely right, I should’ve told you it was me straight away. I’m sorry. That was fucking terrible of me, and I’m so sorry.”
“These fickle sods were singing my praises not ten minutes ago,” Ron complained good-naturedly, using his wand to pick up a runaway noodle from the floor.
There was no resisting Draco’s pull now; Harry’s body had taken over his logic, and the idea of putting distance between them was abhorrent to him now. In fact, there was too much distance between them as it was.
“They’re not our hosts, they’re Ron and Hermione,” Harry replied illogically, standing up and summoning the blankets into his arms. Draco thought he was definitely a little annoyed now.
“I think we’re always going to be a little nervous to tell them, no matter how long we wait,” Harry reasoned. “And I just think it’ll go down easier if they know we told them fairly early on, as opposed to waiting until, like, three months down the road, or something. They might be hurt that we didn’t tell them sooner, if we wait too long.”
Harry smiled up at him, Draco’s favorite half-smile, and then brushed his knuckles along Draco’s jaw.
Harry sat very still on top of him, breathing heavily, staring at the multitude of large pink scars that had once marked Draco’s body as vividly as blood against snow. They had faded some over time, but even now, they were a stark silhouette against the pale skin of his hairless chest.
Draco could not honestly say that any of his friends would say the same of himself, or at least they wouldn’t admit it so openly. The thought made him sad.
“Thanks,” he said, some feeling coming back into his body. Ron and Hermione were having another baby. Fuck, he was too tipsy to handle this information.
Draco groaned. “Honestly, the way you’re dragging this story out just to torment me is positively Slytherin.”
“You always sound so poetic,” Harry said in that wonderful sleepy voice. “You’re like a really smart fairy.”
“Ah, did I hate you?” Draco asked warily. “At Hogwarts? I suppose it’s likely, since I hated most people there. Did I mention that I was a prick?”
“Yes, ironic,” Harry murmured, finally responding. “At least I think it is. I’ve never really understood the meaning of irony. I mean, does anyone?”
And with that she turned to assist another customer, who was approaching the counter with an armful of items.
He took another long swig and then set his beer down on the coffee table. He was suddenly quite sure that he had had enough for the evening.
Draco sank down into his armchair with a groan and folded himself up, hugging his legs. Harry stood frozen a few feet away, merely staring at him, looking on the verge of tears himself.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. Very sure. I want to climb onto your rooftop and tell the entire world, actually.”
Draco fixed him with a curious look, but still he said nothing. Harry pouted at him, trying his best to work the pitiful angle to his advantage. He really was dying to know more about Draco.
“He was intelligent, somber, raven-haired, and mean to everyone but me,” Draco explained over Harry’s laughter. “Precisely everything young Draco wanted in a man.”
Harry laughed at him; he was running out of d-words, but he didn’t mind losing this particular game. “Discrimination?”
“Similar adjectives, though,” Harry said with a grin, and Draco wanted to pull him into his arms, just for being so damn sweet.
“Next time,” Draco repeated, gently nudging at Harry’s foot under the table until he finally smiled up at him.
“I’ve dealt with a lot worse than disapproving parents, Malfoy,” Harry argued. “And don’t you think they want you to be happy as well?”
“Go take a quick shower,” Draco suggested, finally sitting up in bed. “I’ll clean up our cummy sheets and find some breakfast for you to take to work. I can head off when you do, and I’ll get ready at my own place.”
“Well,” Draco said thoughtfully, “as much as it pains me to defend the Weasel, I haven’t quite given him a reason to think any differently. We can’t exactly blame him for being dubious of me, or of this relationship.”
Draco could feel Harry’s heartbeat picking up speed beneath his fingers, and he thought he might burst open with the sheer ecstasy of that observation.
“Erm--” Harry muttered, and when he licked his lips, Draco realized with astounding clarity that he wanted to kiss him, a real kiss, one that neither of them would ever be able to forget. He wanted his tongue in Harry’s mouth, his fingers in Harry's hair, eyes closed, world falling away, his pessimism shattered for all eternity.
But Draco didn’t want him to backtrack. He wanted Harry to talk about the rest of their lives, all the time. He wanted ‘for the rest of our lives’ to be a given. He wanted Harry to hold him like this forever. He wasn’t afraid anymore.
Draco raised his eyebrow and decided to let it go, assuming that whatever it was that had Harry looking so befuddled could only mean good things for Draco. He lifted his hand, holding the baby pink macaron up to Harry’s mouth.
He walked to the bathroom as quickly as his legs could take him. Draco let his mind wander as he relieved himself.
“I have,” Harry said, “but just casual dates. People Ron and Hermione knew from work, people I could trust not to blab to Witch Weekly this time, fortunately. But never more than just one or two dates, and it never led to anything physical, aside from the odd brief snog. The last date I went on was with a bloke, though. Maybe two weeks ago. He was fit.”
“They did?” Draco asked, looking up from his portfolio with wide eyes. Harry loved the joy on his face.
“Only larrikins such as yourself would call it a waste, Potter,” Draco scoffed, ignoring Harry’s (rather cute) impatience and deliberately taking his time adjusting his stance on his broomstick. “And I hardly think your opinion counts, given that you’ve never touched a hairbrush in your entire life.”
Draco paced, trying to follow his thoughts, but all he could think was, I want to kiss Potter. I want Potter in my bed. I want Potter in my house and my life and my head until we both die.
“So I tell her I am happy,” Harry said. “The happiest I’ve ever been, hands down. And since I’d just whinged about work for a solid half hour, she assumed it couldn’t be work that was making me feel that way. So Hermione, being Hermione, asks me point blank if I’m seeing someone.”
“Well… in hindsight I probably should’ve told them before today,” Harry admitted, setting the sugar bowl onto the tea tray. “I suppose I--”
“Right, I’m a freak, in a good way,” Harry summarized, grinning at him as he popped the last bit of his scone in his mouth.
“I wonder how many hours of life you’ve wasted just doing your hair,” Harry teased him, flying low in a circle around Draco. “Dammit, would you bloody well hurry up, Malfoy?”
“Sorry,” Harry said, even though he wasn’t. “Don’t think I’m not going to pester you about your third dosage in the morning either.”
“Perhaps we’ve been saying everything to each other for far longer than we realize,” he said softly, brushing Harry’s hair away from his forehead.
Potter pretended to make himself comfortable on his stool and held his drink up again for Draco to cheers, which he did.
Draco shook his head before he accidentally admitted that he’d been enjoying every second of flirting with Potter like a randy teenager. And that was the root of the problem, wasn’t it? Draco was angry that he had actually enjoyed spending time with Harry, and that Harry had known who he was and not had the decency to reject him immediately and be on his merry way. He was angry with Potter for dangling the carrot and then cruelly yanking it away.
The shy nervousness in Harry’s expression didn’t dissipate, and the animal deep within Draco purred in pleasure. There was something about the innocence in Harry’s eyes that made Draco feel staggeringly powerful, and so,
His father, on the other hand, had never really learned to accept the things about Draco that he didn’t approve of, and he most certainly had never approved of Harry, in any respect. When he told his father the news, Draco was sure he would leave the room in a fit of fury and wounded pride, and Draco would probably not hear a word from him for months. That suited him just fine, now he thought about it.
Harry smiled back at him. “I guess not. But I’m sure you can think of something, given that your imagination is just as vivid as mine.”
“We won’t survive either, Harry,” Hermione said, and Harry glanced, startled, to his right, at her translucent body. She held Rose in her arms and Ron stood behind her, wrapping both of them in a tight embrace. All of them were pearly white ghosts. “You can’t save us.”
“Okay. Erm…” Harry scanned Draco to glean some inspiration, but his immature and overly randy mind was immediately inundated with nothing but filth.
“Oh fuck, sorry, love,” Draco said, though his laughter seemed to suggest that he was anything but. “Are you alright?”
Harry sighed and bent his head down so he was staring at the floor. Draco knew he was trying not to cry.
“Draco…” Harry breathed into his mouth before capturing Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth. “I need to…”
Harry smiled and shifted so that he was sitting cross-legged on the bed, turned slightly away from Draco. No, that would never do. He shifted once again, trying to get comfortable.
“I did!” Draco said honestly. “Fit, dark quidditch player? Popular? Muscular? He was precisely my type.”
“But for every sweet memory, there are ten more that demonstrate so clearly why I became such an insecure, insufferable twat in school,” Draco said bitterly. “Those moments when my father would grow impatient with me for not grasping the broom handle properly, or when I was reprimanded for picking up something that our house elf had dropped on the floor, or when I was told not to hug my mother back, because it was improper for a boy to be so demonstrative. Merlin help me if I ever failed to show adequate pride in our pureblood status, or questioned why I should give a rat’s arse about upholding the family name.”
“No,” Draco said immediately, instinctively clutching the folder tighter. There was no way he could allow Harry to see it now. ‘
“He was nice, too,” Harry said, ignoring the insult. “Actually that was quite mean, calling him an idiot; I didn’t really mean that.”
Before he knew it, Draco had wrapped a hand around his prick, rubbing it slowly over the soft fabric of his trousers. For a moment he considered waiting for Harry, but then a memory from the previous evening came floating into his mind like a heavenly proclamation.
Once they’d all eaten their fill of Ron’s admittedly fantastic spag bol (Draco’s with copious amounts of parmesan), he had momentarily ceased his diligent note-taking to help the Golden Trio tidy up the kitchen, letting his self-writing quill work alone for awhile. Draco had coaxed several colorful stories about Harry from Weasley (Moaning Myrtle trying to cop a feel in the prefects’ bathroom in fourth year being his personal favorite), and they were all laughing heartily before long. Harry had stood a little closer beside him than necessary as they fired drying spells at the dishes together, and though he must be embarrassed to be discussed so candidly, he hadn’t stopped smiling the whole time.
“No!” Harry backpedaled immediately, placing a hand on Draco’s forearm, afraid that he was about to leave. “No, I’m bisexual. Sorry, I don’t know why I said it that way… But yeah, I’m bi. I’m into blokes. I mean, I like women, but, yeah, I like men, too.”
Draco made a defiant ‘hmph’ noise and raised his chin in the air. “I believe the word you were looking for was
They each took another long sip of tea, and he watched Harry almost unconsciously point his wand at the bowl on the table, levitating a red Bertie Bott’s bean into his hand.
Hashing out the war was not something Draco wanted to do. Not right now, anyway. He wanted to rekindle the spark of hope that he had felt just a few minutes earlier. He wanted Potter to smile at him again.
“Good to know you’re not above attending business meetings in tracksuit bottoms, Potter,” Draco replied dryly.
“So you’re my… boyfriend.” The word felt strange on his tongue, but he felt he could get used to it easily.
“Are you sure you still want to ask me out?” Harry finally said, positively vibrating under Draco’s intense eyes. “I feel as if I’m blowing it.”
Draco continued to tease him, alternating between taking his cock deep in his mouth and licking it, kissing it, stroking it. His own cock was leaking as he fucked his hole with his fingers, but satisfying Harry was the most important thing to him now.
“Honestly, you could’ve just told me I was a horrible prick and that you hated me,” Harry muttered against his lips, “but fuck, if that wasn’t the sexiest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Draco watched in fascination as a glimmer of relief brightened Harry’s eyes, and he smiled tentatively. “Merlin, is that teenage Malfoy coming out to play again?”
The observation really shouldn’t have taken Draco by surprise; Harry was rapidly developing a rather disconcerting talent for seeing through him.
“They put me in a localized body-bind the moment I arrived, so I couldn’t move anything above my shoulders,” he continued quietly, rubbing his thumb over Harry’s calloused finger. “I hated that, as I'm sure you can imagine, so I asked one particularly condescending mediwitch to remove it. God she was bothersome, speaking to me as if I was a bloody infant... Anyway, eventually Healer Belland did. Remove the body-bind, that is. On the condition that I try to keep my head and neck as still as possible, of course. I’ve managed it fairly well, except for one ill-advised turn of the head, when I went to reach for my wand. It hurt like hell, but it didn’t last long.”
Draco snorted again. Really, alcohol turned him into quite the barbarian. “Gryffindor stubbornness, more like.”
Draco sighed. He supposed he should try and be open with Harry in the same way Harry had repeatedly been open with him.
“I beg your pardon, I did not steal anything,” Draco said loftily as he pulled on a pair of pants. “You left that here last weekend, remember? Also, what’s yours is mine, etcetera.”
“It’s bothering me that you don’t have more hands,” Draco interrupted contentedly. “By all means, continue.”
“Anyways, the only other physical experience I’ve had was a fairly steamy makeout session with one Ravi Hewitt. I was in sixth year, he was in seventh. He found out I was gay, or guessed it maybe. So he took a chance and cornered me in the locker room after a Quidditch practice and kissed me. And how could I resist such bravery?”
“I have before, twice,” Draco said. “The first time just after she arrived, and the second when I helped Blaise move.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco snorted. He stared straight ahead and took a deep breath. He could say it again; he had said it earlier. But this time felt heavier.
Draco paused. “But before we do that, I suppose I should formally thank you for defending me at my trial three years ago.”
Ron leaned close to Hermione and squeezed her shoulder, planting a sloppy kiss on her forehead. “Can you blame me?”
Once he’d retrieved the small jug, he leaned back against the counter and cradled it in his hands, looking at Harry pensively. “May I ask you something?”
Harry showered in haste, but he killed some time baking a batch of scones for Draco in an attempt to take his mind off of the eventful night. Unsurprisingly, he wasn’t met with much success.
And that, too, was precisely the wrong thing to say, he realized once again too late. His face burned quite hot now, and, looking up to see that Potter’s eyes flashed bright and darted to Draco’s mouth, he decided another swift subject change was in order.
He finally got out of bed, tucking the note into his floral box with the rest of Harry’s letters. He thought about Harry the whole time he was getting ready.
“Not with the bloody story, Malfoy.” Ron glared right back at him. “My best mate has never looked at anyone like he’s been looking at you all night. And the same goes for you. I may not know you all that well anymore, but I know an eye-fucking when I see one.”
Draco laughed. “Believe it or not, I know exactly what you mean. About the mysterious facial expressions, that is.”
Draco cocked his head to the side and looked up at her, waiting. Hermione had dropped several thought-provoking insights in the past half hour or so since they’d begun talking, and he was fully expecting another one now.
But Harry pulled his hands free and slowly traced his fingers along each scar, gentle as a whisper. A crease had formed between his eyebrows. He wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes.
“Alex, eh?” he muttered, trying to sound uninterested despite his immediate curiosity. Draco’s head whipped around to look at him, and he dropped his quill on his desk. “Boyfriend I don’t know about?”
“I’m here, dearest,” Draco whispered, kissing Harry’s sweaty neck. “It’s alright. You’re alright. I’m here.”
“Ah, I love how you talk,” Harry laughed. Draco laughed with him because there was just nothing else to be done. “Tell me about this kiss.”
“I see,” Draco nodded, letting the information settle as he scrutinized Harry. “And… you’re sad about this?”
Draco said nothing, but he laid himself down on top of Harry, tucking his hands in on top of Harry’s chest, weaving his legs between Harry’s, and resting his head in his new favorite spot in the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry was everywhere again, just like he ought to be.
Draco chuckled at that. “Not like that. Believe me, Weasley, you’re the last man in the world I would ever look twice at.”
Reluctantly pulling his hand out from behind Draco’s neck, Harry leaned back a little. Well, that was a bit of a buzzkill.
“There’s one example, sure,” he agreed, before doing a comical double take. “Shit, is it really three a.m.?”
But self-control hadn’t gotten him very far, had it? What was the point of it anymore? Merlin’s sake, what was the bloody point?
“What?” he asked in a strangled whisper, leaning back as far away from Harry as he could. “Are we… are you giving up just because they don’t approve of me?”
“Let’s go inside,” Draco uttered, louder than the moment called for, and he stood up suddenly. “Will you take in the blankets? I’ll handle the bottles and grab the tea set.”
Boldly, Harry lifted his arm off the table and moved it to his lap, rested it on top of his leg, and inched it over, slowly, so slowly, his ears ringing from the thrill of it, until he felt the tips of his fingers touching a leg that was decidedly not his own.
Harry didn’t wait for him to change his mind and he kissed Draco, slowly and deeply. Harry tasted predictably grimy, but Draco hardly cared. He was happy to remain frozen in this moment, kissing his beloved indefinitely. They had all the time in the world for what might come later.
But surely he was just overthinking; it was what he did best. He took comfort in the fact that Rosalind was a fair, albeit somewhat gruff, editor. She had been the one to hire him, had suggested (and subsequently defended) his working under a pseudonym, and, mercifully, seemed to actually like him. Truth be told, he quite liked her as well; she reminded him fiercely of Pansy sometimes. He reasoned that there were no obvious grounds for worry.
“You realize I’m going to have a dozen more love bites to vanish, thanks to you,” Draco said, smiling softly.
Draco smiled to himself and dumped the biscuits onto a serving dish unceremoniously. Then he hastily grabbed a small stack of napkins, admitting to himself that he was eager to get back to talking with Harry. The thought still made him shake his head in complete bewilderment, but it felt a little less alien to him now. Because of course he wanted to talk to Harry. Even as enemies, Draco had longed to talk to Harry. Now that he was finally getting his wish, he dare not question it.
Draco talked and talked, surprised that so much was coming out of him, and even more surprised that he was okay with it. Harry made it easy for Draco to tell the truth. Harry made him feel safe.
“Code of ethics,” Draco began. “Possibility of getting sacked. Conflict of interest. Potential awkwardness. Extreme unprofessionalism. Journalistic integrity. Take your pick.”
“And you’re the one who can fix that for us, are you?” Ron said, hostilely. “The reformed death eater suddenly has all the answers?”
“You can never die, Potter,” Draco finally said, pulling him tight against his chest. “I won’t allow it.”
“You can stay over,” Draco suggested, a little shyly. “If you want to, that is. Remember school is officially out for summer, so I’m not obligated to be anywhere at all on Monday. Or all summer, come to think of it. And I remember you mentioned that you weren’t starting until the afternoon on Monday, so we might have a little extra time together, in the morning.”
“Well I’m happy,” Harry replied, smiling contentedly. “My boyfriend came to my rescue and put an end to a fight between me and my best mate.”
Harry grinned and disappeared from the doorway, presumably continuing his hunt for clothing down the hall and into the sitting room. Draco sighed serenely and slid back down onto his back. He could scarcely believe that he’d been riding a wave of pure bliss for three whole weeks, but here he was. He inhaled deeply; he could smell Harry all around him.
“Oh, no,” she laughed, gesturing towards the back of the shop. “You can just head on back, sir. Just through there and down the hall, on the left. Door’s always open.”
“No, we just kept pointing out how odd it was that we were spending time together at all, much less enjoying it,” Draco said, thinking about it fondly. “Not that you and I are enjoying this, of course.”
Harry let out his own moan at the same time. Their arms were wrapped around each other, bodies pressed tight together, breathing heavily.
Draco was jolted from his morose thoughts when, all of a sudden, Harry moved one of his hands in his sleep, pulling it off the pillow and resting it heavily on Draco’s hip. It was an undoubtedly innocuous touch, but Draco felt it deeply… He felt it
Draco set the firewhiskeys on the slightly sticky table and sat down again. Without thinking he held his glass aloft for Potter to clink, a gesture he would do with anyone and so thought nothing of. Potter’s eyebrows once again flew upward, a look that didn’t quite have the same effect when he was wearing this face. Nonetheless, Potter raised his glass and tapped it against Draco’s.
“I want you to come first,” Draco said, as authoritatively as he could, despite his quivering voice. He was fighting off his own orgasm, and he knew that seeing Harry come for him would easily push him over the brink.
“Maybe I’m just not used to them flirting back,” Harry replied, more honest than he probably should’ve been.
“Harry,” Draco whispered. “Don’t worry. Surely you knew that Lucius Malfoy wasn’t going to be doing cartwheels when he heard that his only son and heir was in love with the Chosen One.”
“Don’t,” Harry murmured gruffly, gazing down at Draco’s body, unapologetically studying every inch. “Don’t be self-conscious. You are absolutely angelic. Draco, you’re perfect.”
Draco closed his eyes and leaned his head back onto Harry’s shoulder, contentedly soaking up the kisses Harry was once again raining upon his neck. Draco felt as if he could die perfectly happy right now.
“Noted,” Harry said shyly, his imagination already running amok, even though Draco had been joking (he assumed).
“Indeed,” she agreed. “Regardless, they want you to come down to Auror headquarters for questioning this afternoon.”
“Actually, I was lucky to get the job at all,” Draco said, as he absently slid over to make more room for Harry.
“Two butterbeers, please,” Draco said, figuring that it was better to stick to a weaker drink and remain at least reasonably sober for this meeting. On second thought, perhaps more liquor would make it all go down easier.
They smiled at each other, and Draco’s insides were once again twisting into knots. Bloody hell, this week apart was well-timed; Draco’s emotions were entirely too involved for his liking.
Harry snorted. “Whatever, Malfoy. You go right ahead and be the voice of reason in this relationship. I’ll be the mushy optimist. I am perfectly happy with that arrangement.”
“Well, after cheating death so many times in your life, how could I allow dehydration, of all things, to bring about your ultimate downfall?” Draco replied. “How humiliating.”
Draco bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from breaking down in tears again. He knew Harry made a very good point--a point that Draco had introduced, really. But it stung, and it all amounted to the same thing: Harry was ashamed of him.
Harry wrinkled his nose in disgust as he summoned himself another butterbeer. “What an awful thing to say.”
Harry lifted his teacup to his mouth. “That’s a pretty loaded question. Rapid-fire, remember? Easy questions only?”
Just like that, Draco’s hand--and his leg, and his arm, and his warmth--were gone, and Harry glanced up at Ron in a panic, the trance broken. Had they been caught?
“No,” he replied, shaking his head for emphasis. “There was an unforeseen hiccup in the plan. When we had failed to procreate after four years or so, Astoria and her parents decided that it wasn’t quite such an advantageous marriage after all, and the union was dissolved.”
Even though his impulse was to burst into the room and demand explanations, Harry felt himself turning and walking away as silently as he was able back to the sitting room and plopping down on his favorite armchair. Draco was using his wand to return the now neatly-folded throw blankets to the wicker basket beside the couch. He peered over at Harry curiously.
“Because… I’m…” Draco fiddled with his wand, just to distract himself, to keep his hands busy, to expel a fraction of the energy that was surging through his veins at full speed. It was making his ears ring, this intense feeling. His stomach… he didn’t think he could stand the feeling…
Harry quickly pulled his hand away and Draco yearned for the touch again, felt starved for it. To distract himself from the loss, Draco opened the drawer in front of him to grab two spoons. When he turned around he expected Harry to be staring at him, but to his surprise, Harry was opening and closing his cupboards.
“Okay, not ancient history, exactly, but what’s the point in bringing it all up again?” Ron shrugged. “Anyway, it’s only Malfoy, no?”
Draco glared over at him. “Heavens above, please tell me you didn’t just make a portmanteau of Prophet and office.”
Oh bugger. He had really just cocked it all up, hadn’t he. He wished for all the world that he could be swallowed up into the floor and never heard from again.
Draco told himself to calm down, as he knew it was nerves that had caused that reaction. He took Potter’s sweater and turned to hang it up on the wall hook ahead. He couldn’t help but glance at the way the sleeves of Potter’s t-shirt rode up to reveal deeply tanned biceps, well muscled from years of Quidditch and Auror training. Draco cleared his throat.
Harry lifted his head at that moment and stared at Draco with a wary look on his face. Rather than break their eye contact, Draco stared back, mesmerized. Now that he was really looking, Harry Potter was actually even more attractive than he’d initially thought. No, Harry Potter was…
Before Draco could stop it, he released a primal, strangled yell as he felt himself come, shooting harder than he thought he could, onto Harry’s hand, his cock, his green t-shirt. He felt in utter ecstasy, as if he left his body, barely hearing Harry’s own guttural groan as he came only a few seconds later. The feel of it splashing against Draco's skin made him shiver all over.
When he looked up again, Harry simply nodded, his green eyes wide and acquiescent, and because Draco didn’t know how to interpret that nod, it only served to excite him further. He had never felt so aroused before. Flirting with Harry Potter was dangerous, and wrong, and stupid. All of that only made him want to do it ten times more.
Harry shimmied down lower in his seat and glared into his tea, pursing his lips defiantly. “I told you, I wasn’t flirting.”
Draco left shortly thereafter; his father, unsurprisingly, hadn’t reappeared. Nonetheless, he knew that the evening had gone as well as could be expected, and he arrived home in a reasonably good mood, and far earlier than he’d estimated. He hoped Harry would be early as well; he couldn’t wait to see him.
“Harry, tell me what’s wrong,” Draco demanded in an authoritative voice. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“Because, regardless of how you may feel about me, and however justified your feelings may be, your best mate and I are in love.”
“Cheers, Potter,” he said, downing the glass in one. “Shall I go ahead and get the next round now? You know, to give us something to do whilst we sit here in the awkwardness that we so wanted to avoid?”
“And you’re saying that’s a bad thing?” he asked. His butterbeer-infused brain couldn’t quite follow her logic just then.
As usual, Draco felt his gaze follow Potter’s movements as he made his way once more to the bar. He watched as Harry leaned casually up against the bar, resting on his elbows and making friendly conversation with the older witch beside him while the barkeep served another customer. Draco knew he was looking at Potter’s arse, but he found he didn’t much care. The alcohol must be affecting him.
“Because this was an aggravated assault, and it took place on company property,” she informed him bluntly.
Before he could think of something to say, Malfoy glared at him and cast a stealthy silencing charm around the two of them. “Very well. Let’s have it, then.”
Draco began fumbling at Harry’s flies with shaking fingers, suddenly desperate to get him naked. Harry’s lips were on him in an instant, kissing him, hard and eager. Draco moaned when Harry twisted his tongue lecherously against Draco’s, and he pulled clumsily at the zipper and button of Harry’s jeans until they were finally undone. Quickly he tugged at them, Harry taking the hint instantly and lifting himself up, helping Draco pull the jeans down a few inches, over his arse. Draco could see the top of Harry’s cock struggling against his jeans...
“Sure,” Draco agreed, though Harry could practically see him making a mental note to check his plate for suspicious additions before he began eating. Or maybe he was just planning which pair of fancy slacks to wear. Who could tell with Draco?
“However, when the Greengrasses chose to extricate Astoria from the union, my mother convinced my father that it was the right decision for everyone. By that point, I imagine even Father could see that I would never grow to love her, as he’d repeatedly tried to convince me I would.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well, I’m not in any rush. This relationship has happened fast enough as it is, Potter. Let me retain a semblance of control, at least in this aspect.”
“No?” Potter said, tilting his head to the side again in that same familiar way. He felt oddly nostalgic seeing it again. He found he had missed it.
“I never said…” Potter started, but then just huffed out a groan. It made Draco feel wonderfully nostalgic and he couldn’t stop smiling. “You’re putting words in my mouth. You
Harry heaved another audible sigh. “So you just sacrificed your own happiness because you thought it was your duty.”
Draco reached over and gripped Harry’s hand for a brief moment, before he seemed to remember that he shouldn’t, then snatched it away again.
“No, I suppose not,” Draco agreed. “Although wearing that hideous jumper in public certainly makes you at least moderately perplexing.”
Gareth snorted and tried to disguise it by jotting something down on the paper in front of him. “Quiet, Potter. Not your case, remember?”
Malfoy,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes, ignoring his pleasure at hearing Draco’s delicate laugh. There was a nice lilt to his voice when he said the word ‘together.’
“I would love you watching me,” Draco agreed, closing his eyes for a minute. “I’d put on a show for you.”
“But you’re not a stranger, are you?” Draco asked, though it was more of a statement than a question. “I feel as if I know you, but I’m quite certain I’ve never seen your face before.”
Harry groaned. “Don’t, Malfoy. I hated you, just as you hated me. I wanted to keep my enemies close, as it were.”
To his disappointment, Draco only smiled, looking absolutely delighted to have once again gotten a rise out of him. Harry recognized that cocky expression all too well, not to mention the way his insides squirmed when he saw it.
Draco ignored those pesky snitches and did his best to look haughty. “If you honestly think that I’d say yes to a proposal that pathetic, you are exponentially more delusional than I thought, Potter.”
Draco had never strictly masturbated with anyone before. He and his housemates at Hogwarts had always had the decency to put up privacy charms, or to get off in the shower. Every time he’d slept with Astoria, it had been with a very let’s-get-this-over-with mentality, and other than her, it had just been… well, no one who was interested in mere wanking, anyway.
“Weren’t we sucking each other off just now?” Draco asked, smiling as he scooted back tight against Harry’s toasty warm chest. “Did we fall asleep?”
“I know that, Draco,” Harry said, sitting down again. “It was a shitty thing to do. Are you sorry for it?”
He heard Draco’s breath hitch, and Harry swallowed, staring straight ahead, his nerves so tense that the slightest breeze through the open window might’ve knocked him to the floor. Was this allowed? Was he crossing a line? Merlin, he must be; this felt fucking illegal. Draco had only to move his leg away, or to slide his chair an inch or two to the left, and the spell--and all that was left of Harry’s hope--would be shattered.
“Yes, please, Harry,” Draco allowed himself to mutter, staring into Harry’s eyes. “Take me into your mouth and let your tongue slide over my cock, up the base, over the tip. Lick up my precum and listen to me moan your name.”
“I remember he gave the most thoughtful compliments, too,” Harry said fondly, and Draco once again gripped his quill tighter. “Like, he used to tell me my smile would turn all his rainy days into sunshine. How sweet is that?”
And there was Harry, his Harry, the Harry of dreams and the Harry of reality, proving himself a hero once again by simply being there. Harry hadn’t left. Harry had stayed.
Everything about the statement rubbed Harry the wrong way, and he knew that the look he shot at Draco reflected it. “First of all, no one’s against you, Draco.”
He hadn’t bothered to inform his parents of the injury (he shuddered reflexively just thinking about that unsavory prospect), and, aside from a logistical owl to Astoria informing her that he would be away for the evening, the only person he’d wanted to talk to was Harry. And that didn’t surprise him in the slightest.
Slipping through the doors the next evening at precisely 7:59, Draco nervously glanced around the crowded pub looking for Potter, doubting that he would be on time as promised. He immediately spotted him, however, despite the glamor charm, sitting unassumingly at a corner table on the far side of the pub. He was wearing green as promised, albeit in the form of a tattered Weird Sisters t-shirt.
“And if I say no again?” Harry challenged, doing his best to sound confident; but he knew he didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of saying no to a flirtatious Malfoy.
Draco had shaken his head, but no words had come out. When he’d peered across the Great Hall, Harry was looking back at him with total revulsion in his face.
You horrible man. You had me thinking that you were delivering some dreadful news, but instead, you were merely reiterating just how Hufflepuffian you are. I will most certainly not send kisses with your owl, Potter, whatever that means, although I know you will pretend that I have. Honestly, you are the worst, and I am unmitigatedly besotted with you.
Weasley’s face went red again. “You’re dating my best mate, despite being enemies for most of your life; you’re both saying you’re in love with each other after only a few weeks; and now you’ve barged into my place of work unannounced with the very purpose of discussing it. I’ll ask whatever personal questions I damn well please, Malfoy.”
“Nice week?” Harry asked, moving aside to make room for him in the narrow entranceway. He was close enough to smell… and he smelled divine.
“And I’m asking you to come up with some possible answers, you half-witted, infuriating man,” Draco huffed. “Let’s figure it out together, as you so often say.”
“Tell me what you would do, Harry,” Draco breathed, looking down at Harry’s cock, rock hard, slippery with lube, flushed red and dripping with precum. “What would you do to me if I was posing like that for you, my arse in the air, begging for your cock?”
Nothing was working right. Harry couldn’t remember how to spell ‘perpetrator.’ His broomstick didn’t turn as easily for him. His glasses always seemed filthier than usual. He couldn’t finish his Kung Pao chicken; hell, he could barely taste it. Everything was just a little bit off. It was damn annoying, really, and yet, when he finally arrived home and opened his journal that evening, all he could write was ‘
It was tiny, to be sure, not a whole lot bigger than the average garden shed, but it was well kept, if Draco did say so himself. The brick exterior was warm and quaint, and dozens of red and purple flowers blossomed delicately in the baskets he had hung from the two front window sills. He had also planted a small but stately birch tree in the front yard upon his purchase of the house. He hadn’t expected to take a liking to gardening, but he found it was a calming and diverting experience, and he took great delight in seeing things grow under his care.
Bloody hell, this was really Draco Malfoy standing in front of him, smiling instead of sneering, and looking really, really…
“Why are you giving me your angry face?” Harry asked, smiling again. “That was all halfway complimentary.”
“I know I pissed him off yesterday,” Ron grumbled, more to himself than to Draco. “I… well, I went off on a bit of a tangent against you, and I guess he took it personally.”
When they’d first gotten together, they had both quickly realized that between Draco’s long, draining shifts at the school and Harry’s somewhat unpredictable Auror schedule, it was the most sensible option to only see each other at the weekends, which, fortunately, they both consistently had off.
“And then you wanted me to shake your hand,” Potter continued, as if they had never paused their conversation. “In front of everyone, all haughty and proud, as if it was a done deal. Like I owed you something.”
“I want to have sex with you, too, for the record.” Draco forced himself to say the words out loud, and he found that they sounded less terrifying once they were out of his head and dancing in the space between him and Harry. “Emphatically.”
“Says the bloody reporter,” Harry teased. “So did you move back into Malfoy Manor after your divorce, then? I mean, I assume you’re divorced?”
“My worst enemy just witnessed me sicking up after a grand total of five drinks, Potter,” he muttered, half hoping Potter would not hear him. “Of course I’m not alright.”
Draco’s eyes flew open at once, and he was instantly blinded by a sliver of brilliant sunlight just beginning to peek over the hill some distance away. Everything came flying back into his mind in one great whoosh, flashes of the previous night playing against his eyelids like scenes in a movie.
Draco had certainly been telling the truth the other night: looks were of little importance to him anymore. Perhaps because of the countless rejections he’d suffered over the years, Draco had learned not to be picky about men’s appearances, and somewhere along the way, he’d almost ceased to notice them at all.
“Harry,” he whispered again. He knew it sounded strangled, and pathetic, and weak. He knew he was about to break. But Harry pulled Draco into his arms and held him close, as if there was nothing to consider.
“I think you like my clothes,” Harry said, and Draco snorted. “I think you envy my casual, boyish charm.”
“Do forgive my outburst, Ms Peters,” Draco muttered. “I… I really don’t know what to say. I’m quite at a loss for words.”
“Of course I am!” Draco admitted bitingly. Anyway, that was a more plausible excuse for his anger than that damned messy hair. “You let me make an utter fool of myself for Merlin knows how long, and all the while, you said nothing!”
Harry waited for him to add something else, but Draco merely poured their two cups of tea in silence.
Draco unfurled the scroll, biting into a scrumptiously sweet cherry tomato, and read it with a beaming smile.
“You and I are good at flirting,” Harry said, leaning back in his chair. “Can’t deny that. And honestly, I… sod it, I just really want to flirt with you.”
“I know,” Draco said, sighing once more. “I feel almost normal already, really, albeit a bit sore. But you of all people should remember that I’m a terribly dramatic patient.”
“Yes, well,” he ventured, “I replied with my assent. We met, and he returned my wand, and we… spent some time together. And talked.”
Harry studied him, wishing that he could crawl inside that blonde head and read his thoughts for a minute. He couldn’t wait to hear what he would say next.
Hermione pulled her hair back into a loose ponytail as she smiled at her toddler. “Yes, she’s a real charmer, isn’t she? She’s all Weasley.”
“Washed his hands of me, I believe, was the phrase he used.” Draco was trying desperately to keep his voice upbeat. “Hardly surprising.”
Harry shook his head and rubbed the back of his neck, looking shamefaced. “I’m sorry. No, I didn’t tell them.”
Draco shook his head, kept shaking it as he fought back the embarrassing onslaught of emotion that threatened to spill forth at any moment.
“Well, first let’s flesh out my relationship history, because you should know that I did kiss Pansy in fourth year.” He started chuckling.
“You said you’d rather tell your parents alone,” Harry pointed out. “And that you thought it’d be better if I told Ron and Hermione alone, too.”
“Harry,” Draco began, noting the way Harry’s eyes softened immediately upon hearing his name. “I don’t need to talk about anything like that. All I want to say is that I want to take my time with you, because this feels like more than a one-night thing to me.”
“Are you sure you’re still okay?” he asked again, squeezing Draco’s arm and kissing the top of his head. “You’re not hurting?”
Draco thought that was a very romantic thing to say--and next to a flowering rose bush, no less--and he pulled Harry in closer against his chest.
Drawing from his meager supply of courage, Draco silently took one of Harry’s hands in his own. It felt rough, a little dry, but warm, so warm in his. He looked up into Harry’s eyes and saw that Harry was already looking at him, surprise etched on his handsome face. Draco forced himself to swallow his fear. For Harry.
“You have some very telling mannerisms,” he said, leaning back slightly and observing Potter over his glass.
Harry leaned forward on the deep red armchair, folded his legs up underneath him, and sighed. After several intense hours of dissecting the war, and seemingly every single detail of Potter and crew’s infamous year on the run, Draco was pleased but not exactly surprised that Harry had come out of the conversation in relatively high spirits. Harry’s unfailing optimism was still one of Draco’s favorite things about him, though that list could fill volumes now.
With Harry sprawled out on his stomach in the middle of the bed, Draco had just enough room to scoot in close, curving his arm around Harry’s back and nestling one of his legs in between Harry’s. He leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder and thought to himself how utterly wonderful this felt. Harry was warm, almost too warm, and even a little bit sticky with sweat, but his heat felt lovely against Draco’s bare skin.
Taking a couple of fortifying gulps of coffee and straightening his robes, Draco took the long way around the back of the now-busy newsroom (sans praiseworthy letter) as confidently as he could. A minute later, he knocked softly on the frame of Rosalind’s open door.
Ron scoffed and Hermione furrowed her brow; Harry’s reaction had been similar as he’d read the most recent letter that morning. While he supposed it was understandable (if slightly unnerving) that people were still interested in the Battle of Hogwarts, he was completely befuddled as to why anyone could possibly want to know more about
“I’ll pick a good one,” Draco promised. “And you can request a different one if you don’t like the one I choose.”
Draco tilted his head down again, watching Harry’s dexterous fingers as they quickly opened the flies of his own jeans. His erection was tenting his pants, and Draco’s was still painfully hard in his trousers. The kitchen counter was digging into his back and he knew it would leave a mark, to join the ones Harry had been leaving all over his neck already, but it made him feel marvellously wanton.
“Borrow some of my clothes if you refuse to use a cleaning charm on your own, you barbarian!” Draco called after him.
“You’re submissive,” Draco whispered, massaging his balls instead, and watching intently as the motion of Harry’s hand continued to flutter the sheets. “You want to be told what to do. You get off on it.”
“Ha!” Draco interrupted him. “You’ll do what? I would absolutely love to hear what it is you’ll do if I say it again.”
“Would you like another cup of tea, by the way?” Hermione asked him, shimmying forward in her chair and reaching for the pot. “Or something else, perhaps?”
Draco took another sip of his tea while studying Harry closely. He didn’t want Harry to be angry, even if it was his typical righteous anger. (Honestly, Potter was going to give himself premature wrinkles if he wasn’t careful.) But, all the same, Draco was very, very touched.
However, he supposed it was inevitable now; he owed Harry an explanation, if nothing else. He sighed.
Harry didn’t hesitate for a single moment. He picked up his wand and fired a series of silent spells at his cock, rolling onto his back and pulling Draco swiftly on top of him. Draco balanced on his knees over top of Harry, and he saw that Harry’s cock was now dripping wet with lube.
hair. Why was Potter always fiddling with his hair like that anyway, even a decade later? Why didn’t he just cut it if it was so bothersome?
Ron continued to focus on his daughter and to ramble on about goodness knows what. As much as Harry loved Ron, he could’ve burst into flames in that moment and Harry probably still wouldn’t have moved.
Draco now faced an entire evening alone, and he found himself pathetically wishing that he had gone with Harry after all. He fought off the sudden compulsion--but only just--to apparate directly into Harry’s sitting room and declare that he had changed his mind, and then to shower his ravishing face with a deluge of kisses.
To his dismay, however, Harry wasn’t wanking; he was still asleep and evidently having a nightmare. Draco instantly sat up on high alert and leaned over Harry, who was now thrashing about, covered in a sheen of sweat.
Harry leaned back and got comfortable in the chair as he gestured with his hand for Draco to continue. “Please do.”
In Draco’s limited experience, people simply didn’t flirt with him, but on the very rare occasion that they did, it certainly wasn’t in hopes of anything lasting beyond an hour or two. He had long since given up wishing for someone to express genuine interest in him, even if, in this case, that someone had been so very charming, and sweet, and funny…
“Mmm,” Harry murmured happily. “I can’t say as I agree with you on any of that, but I am happy you feel that way.”
“You like being praised, too,” he guessed, breathless desperation in his voice. “You like to be a good boy for your man.”
Harry ended up staying the night after all, and Draco found that he was more than happy about it, until he woke in the middle of the night to the sound of strangled moaning next to him. He sighed and tried to rub the sleep from his eyes, convinced in his exhausted state that Harry was boldly jerking off in the bed beside him. He turned to face him, a little annoyed but more than willing to take over.
Harry turned around and Draco nearly ran into him again. He stopped himself just in time, only now, there were mere inches between them. Suddenly he felt as if all the air had been sucked from his lungs.
“Make-up sex is nice,” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair a long while later, after they had cleaned up a bit and entwined themselves into a comfortable snuggle.
Well… he supposed it was time to lay all his cards on the table. If Harry was going to be scared off, Draco would rather it happen sooner than later. They were, after all, a team now, and after everything Draco had learned about him over the past weeks it was only fair that--
Harry shook his head and looked down at his hands in his lap. Draco furrowed his brow as the cold truth slowly crept under his skin.
Draco paused, not sure if there was a word in any language that could accurately say what kissing Harry was.
“And is his brother aware of this treatment?” Gareth continued. “More importantly, was he ever an accomplice?”
He threw down a fistful of floo powder and stepped out of Ron and Hermione’s fireplace a moment later, haphazardly dusting off his well-worn jeans as he glanced around their cozy sitting room.
“Suit yourself,” Harry said with a sigh, handing Draco his mug back. “How’d it go with Hermione? Or am I not allowed to ask that either?”
He pulled away and looked Draco deep in the eye, his face only inches away. “When I get back you can lick my scar some more.”
“Just for a few minutes, until Andrea’s lunch is over and she comes to get me,” Harry answered, feeling unexpectedly self-conscious about his reaction. “Do you not want me there?”
Draco held out his hand and Harry took it and shook. After a moment, they looked up into each other’s eyes, both smiling like children as they squeezed each other’s fingers.
Draco smiled delightedly despite himself. Harry was very right, and he felt warmed to know that he was still being observed like this.
“It was aggravated. You were unconscious for two hours. You’d be completely justified in suing, Malfoy, and I would support you, should you change your mind. You’re the victim here.” She released a long sigh. “Anyway, on top of all that, Morris is a complete and total arsehole.”
Draco stared unapologetically at Harry’s naked body, his now-exposed cock already stiff. Harry wrapped his hand around his length and sat down on the couch next to Draco. Draco could smell him, that intoxicating fresh cologne mingling with the scent of his arousal, and Draco was already on the brink of finishing. Their bare thighs rested against one another, and Harry licked his lips as he stared blatantly at Draco’s fist pumping his own cock.
Six days after their groundbreaking first interview, Draco had once again agreed to meet Harry at the place of his choosing. Though public, this seldom-used quidditch pitch several kilometers outside of London was a reasonably secluded meeting place, particularly since the weather was still so brisk, so they luckily had the place entirely to themselves.
“My files!” he bellowed, panicking with the sudden realization. “My portfolio was still at Harry’s last night, but all of the transcripts from our interviews were in my cubicle, Alex would’ve had access to them, he might’ve taken something…”
“You’re right, though,” Harry muttered. “I have a great imagination, and I plan on putting it to good use.”
“You’re right, that should have been obvious,” Draco admitted, stroking his smooth jaw. “Perhaps I’m more than just slightly inebriated. Or perhaps you’re tampering with my otherwise impeccable ability to use deductive reasoning.”
Finally Harry managed to stop staring, though it wasn’t easy. He pulled his gaze back down to the open page of his journal and pretended to continue writing. The last line he’d written stared back at him: ‘It just seems like nothing ever changes.’ This struck Harry as ironic.
Draco took the bottles from him and set them determinedly on the counter, ignoring any residual nerves. He took Harry’s hands in his, cold now from the beer, and pulled him backwards, the two of them stepping in sync like a waltz until Draco felt his lower back hit up against the countertop behind him. Harry stood facing him, questions written all over his face. There was a foot of space between them, which would never do, and Draco pulled Harry gently towards his body. Harry’s breathing began to shorten, and Draco’s did as well. Having him so near, and feeling the warmth of his body, felt so right and so easy that Draco hardly felt the fear at all anymore.
Somewhere along the line, Draco had forgotten about the simple joy of waking up beside another warm body. He’d shoved it down, a rare pearl alongside all of his bad memories, and it had died there among the rot. Waking up next to Harry reminded him that there were things about his past that he could think of with fondness, things he didn’t have to shove down. It reminded him that there was a future there as well, a future that perhaps he didn’t have to be afraid of… a future with Harry.
“I figured you’d say that,” Ron sighed, nodding back as he opened the top drawer of his desk. “I’ll owl him now.”
Draco rolled his eyes and laughed. “I warned you, my dear. I’m afraid you’ve just lost your sex priveleges for thirty days.”
Draco turned to Harry and discreetly mouthed, ‘pregnant?’ while Ron kissed Hermione’s cheek. Harry shook his head no.
He’d never witnessed Harry having a nightmare before, although Harry had previously warned him that they happened on occasion. Draco furrowed his brow, wondering if he should try to wake him again or if it was better to let Harry sleep through whatever horrors he was witnessing so he might forget the episode in the morning. Before Draco could decide which course of action would lead to the least suffering for his boyfriend, however, Harry shot up in bed, panting and muttering unintelligibly.
Harry snorted and smeared his own toast with marmalade after Draco had finished with it. “Hey, you were up really early.”
“Well would you please stop moving your damn head?” Harry commanded irritably, placing both hands on Draco’s shoulders in concern. “Stay still, or so help me, I’ll put you in a full body bind, whether you like it or not.”
“So was I,” Harry said. “Expected to be up early, that is. But I’ve always liked the early mornings anyway.”
She lifted her hands, looking just as nonplussed as he felt. “He told me you were old friends, which is certainly news to me, since you two have been notorious rivals for years. But he also said that you’d only very recently reconnected. Which, by the way, is the only reason I forgive you for not using your connection to procure the damn interview for us sooner. Either way, he knows bloody David McKinnon is bloody Draco Malfoy, and he wants bloody Draco Malfoy to interview him.”
Draco’s bedroom, like the rest of his cottage, was tiny. There was hardly enough room for more than a bed, a nightstand and a small wardrobe, and so the only place to sit was the bed itself. Draco decided this was fine by him, and he crawled back in beside Harry, in nothing but his pants.
“Well you say things, just out of the blue. Mid-conversation you just take a turn in your thoughts and you voice them out of nowhere. It makes me smile.”
“I appreciate the apology, Potter,” Draco told him, and his voice was like steel. “Obviously you should avoid butterbeer at our meetings from now on.”
“Mr Potter asked that you owl him to let him know that you’ve agreed, and to arrange your first few interview times,” Rosalind informed him, opening the rings of the thick binder and picking up a quill. “And I do mean times, plural, Malfoy. This article is your full-time job for the foreseeable future, you understand?”
Draco swore his heart skipped a beat as he lost himself in Harry’s summer green eyes. “I suppose not, given that you’re dying.”
Draco sighed, directing his regret inward so that it became anger. “Look, I didn’t mean… dammit, can we just acknowledge that I’m a shit person who says the wrong thing sometimes? Must you always look so hurt by what I say? God, I hate it when you look at me like you’re a puppy I’ve just abandoned.”
Oh god. Of course he had left swiftly; he must be livid to have missed another interview, and all because Harry had been tipsy and moody and exhausted and--
“I was just teasing about the wanking part,” Harry went on, chuckling. “Although, come to think of it, I might actually have to, because I’m still really, really turned on. But I won’t do it in front of you, of course. I mean, unless you’re up for it, that is, because I sure am.”
Or maybe, as Hermione had suggested, he just needed to talk about it; he didn’t think it made much difference who he talked to. Why not the Prophet? Kill two birds with one stone. It might be cathartic, as she had told him. He hadn’t wanted to hear it earlier, and he didn’t like thinking about it now, but maybe Hermione was right. (Shocking.)
“Well it’s nice to know that you can manage it when forced,” Harry said. He squeezed Draco’s hand to let him know he was teasing again.
“Your fault,” Draco muttered, giggling further. “You’ve turned me into a foolishly romantic, filthy-minded, immature schoolboy, and for that I will always hate you.”
Draco couldn’t handle such gentle words, he simply couldn’t. He swallowed a few times, shoving down the lump in his throat.
She waited, and he felt his stomach churning unpleasantly as he forced himself to be strong for once in his damn life.
Harry smiled tentatively at him. The fear was still there, deep in his bones, but he didn’t feel the impulse to ignore it this time, because when Draco was looking at him like that, fear was nothing but background noise.
I see, too, that your penmanship has not improved since our school days, but I can’t say that I’m surprised.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe I’ll skive off work and hang out with you all day. I’ll coddle your complexion some more.”
“Relax, Malfoy,” she said, taking another swig of whiskey and leaning back in her chair. “Your office has been searched, and the Aurors cast all the appropriate spells; no Dark Magic was detected, and nothing looked disturbed, or remotely suspicious. Richards is positive that he saw Morris leave empty-handed, so if he was, in fact, snooping, then he didn’t take anything tangible with him. Unless he put an undetectable charm on your files. Or shoved some of them down his bloody trousers or something.”
When Draco hadn’t replied for a few seconds, Harry shifted awkwardly on his feet. Perhaps he’d read all the signals wrong. Perhaps this was nothing more than a physical thing for Draco. Perhaps he had only agreed to a date last night because he’d been woozy on potions and overly tired and… Oh god, did he even
“I should’ve told Ron and Hermione about you,” he said, flopping back down onto the couch behind him. “About us.”
“I know,” Draco replied, “but you’re also hard because of me, aren’t you? It makes you hard when I touch you, even like this.”
Draco’s ears began to ring as he watched Harry slowly slinking across the room towards him. Draco uncrossed his legs and sat up straighter, as if readying himself for an attack.
“Richards said he wasn’t in robes, either, so that’s further evidence that he wasn’t hiding anything,” she continued enthusiastically. (Heavens above, no one relished a gripping mystery like Rosalind did.) “He described Morris as looking ‘panicked and afraid’ when he escaped, which also lends weight to the Aurors’ theory that the fool was trespassing without a goal in mind, which in turn ups the likelihood that he didn’t take anything. By all accounts, it looks as if the attack was not premeditated.”
“Sorry,” Harry muttered. “But I don’t like it when you get so down on yourself, and call yourself something you’re not. You’re not a Death Eater anymore and you’re not awful and you don’t deserve to be treated poorly for the rest of your life just because you made some stupid mistakes in your past. Okay?”
Just as quickly, that lovely thought fled his mind as he remembered that there were things Harry still didn’t know, things that needed to be said, things that Draco had kept from him. Draco hadn’t said everything, and despite his terror at the prospect of doing so, he knew it was time. And he knew Harry would understand. He hoped so, anyway.
“You like loaded questions, they keep you sharp,” Harry said with a wink. “Hold on, let me go find my wand. And my shirt.”
Draco squirmed uncomfortably in his seat, knowing that Harry hadn’t meant that as a personal slight, but feeling the impact of it anyway.
“It’s no trouble at all,” Draco promised, letting Rose hit him all she wanted with Oscar the Owl. (Oh dear, he was going to be one of those hopelessly indulgent fathers, wasn’t he?) “You must take after your mother; as I recall, she has quite a good arm.”
“Sorry,” he muttered, looking uncomfortable. “I don’t know why I’m cleaning up. Maybe it’s because I just feel, oddly, very at home in your house.”
Harry shrugged. “Because I always want to hold you. And I said some truly awful things, too. That’s what fights are.”
