Christmas morning dawned cold and white. Hermione and Sarah, who had been staying in Hermione’s dorm with her, burst into Harry and Ron’s dormitory, startling the three boys awake.
“All of you can fuck off,” Pansy declared loudly. She turned to Hermione. “Hermione, darling, you are the only sane one here. Save me from their imbecilic ways.”
“How on earth are you just sitting there?” asked Harry in amazement during one of the quieter moments.
“I swear those two are my favourite people ever,” Sarah sighed, still looking at where the twins disappeared.
“I got Head Boy alongside Hermione,” Draco explained, a smug grin on his posh face. “We’ll also be working with two seventh years but the main authority resides with us.”
“No,” said Ron, answering Harry’s question. And just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.
.” He turned bright, storm-cloud eyes toward Sarah. “I don’t know why I feel like this but I’ve just been so upset all day.”
“Wonder what the tasks are going to be?” said Ron thoughtfully. “You know, I bet we could do them, harry. We’ve done dangerous stuff before…”
“I already saw Blaise and the others,” Sarah continued. She put her feet up on the seat opposite her and crossed her ankles. “He’s in a piss because Pansy got prefect and wasn’t there to listen to him complain about his newest stepfather.”
Eventually, when nearly the last person had trickled out of the common room, she finished. She yawned widely as she tidied up her work before trudging out of the common room and into her dorm, where she fell asleep before her head even hit the pillow.
Sarah kept her makeup to a minimum as well, except for her lips, which she painted a deep red to match her dress.
“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!”
“I gave you plenty of time,” Narcissa said with a slight smile. “And now you know, so I say we enjoy a nice brunch before you all head off for a delightful lunch at the Burrow.”
“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice, which put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawny’s conversation, “that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again?”
“Not to mention the Slytherin team,” he went on, “Most of them are friends of Deaumont’s, although, potentially it was a bad decision to have the opposing team Captain’s boyfriend versing him as Seeker. Maybe that’s why they haven’t won a game against Gryffindor yet.”
Ron turned a little pink and went to glare at Ginny, only to see that she had disappeared from the kitchen. Sarah noticed that Hermione, Draco and Harry had also slunk away.
The others followed and nearly ran into Ron as he suddenly stopped, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mould and, in pride of place, an enormous grey cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON: DIED 31
“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,” said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy, bloodshot eyes. “We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.”
Draco hummed in acknowledgment and then smirked. “Do you remember when we convinced Flitwick that you were actually me in fourth year? And you managed to get me out of detention?”
mean that I am willing to betray his trust and reveal anything he may or may not have confided in me about. Do you understand where I’m coming from?”
Katie was removed to St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Sarah, Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.
Harry was beginning to stress about the egg. Draco had thought that the screeching had sounded familiar but he couldn’t remember what it was. Cedric had given him an obscure reference at Christmas to take the egg for a bath – something that he was, admittedly, quite hesitant to do.
Sarah saw that Harry wasn’t as calm as she thought – he was shaking with anger, his green eyes morphing from a blank stare to a fiery gaze.
“No clue, I didn’t follow him,” said Sarah. “I didn’t recognise the girls but they didn’t look happy.”
“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome – the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you  - Dimitrov!”
She stood up and raced down the steps, ignoring what was happening in the air. She burst through the barrier and tried getting Fred or Angelina’s attention but to no avail. Ever since Fred and George had been producing their Skiving Snackboxes, they had made sure Sarah always had the antidote to the chews in case anyone gave her one. Sarah had been helping them work on the Nosebleed Nougats’ antidote because they were having difficulties counteracting the Blood Blisterpod to stop the blood flow once ingested. Fred, the loveable idiot, had given Katie an unfinished chew, meaning that she had only consumed the Blood Blisterpod.
“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depts of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.
They all pointed their wands high in the air, so that the little gold cup sparkled in a five-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.
“Is Sarah all right?” he asked, reaching out a hand to run it through his best friend’s hair. “What happened?”
She couldn’t resist rocking backwards again and the hand tightened on her hip, drawing her body back harder against Fred’s.
Sarah barely refrained from rolling her eyes at him. Instead, she kicked a stray rock into the water.
“Are you going?” Sarah asked Harry, who was idly tracing patterns on Draco’s hand as Draco spoke energetically with another Ministry official.
The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Sarah kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Sarah had felt extremely relieved when Remus and Sirius had appeared on the Burrow’s doorstep the next day and she spent many hours with Remus just talking quietly. Harry was restless, he wanted to set out on the mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.
Class passed quickly. When it finished, Sarah followed Draco and Hermione to a secluded corridor before watching them turn the Time-Turner back one hour and disappearing into thin air. She quickly made her way to Transfiguration where she was soon joined by the pair again, who looked slightly out of breath but quite happy.
The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped their hands and walked away, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what Sarah knew were sobs. Harry watched her for a moment before turning away to begin the protective enchantments. Instead, it was Draco was walking slowly over to Hermione to sit beside her. Sarah made a hasty exit as soon as she could and returned victorious with two full bags of food and new clothes.
She began showing Harry the different techniques to use and helped him finish an, albeit messy, complete braid.
“I’m going to go find George,” she announced to the group. Blaise and Pansy didn’t look up from where they were pressed together, Pansy’s head resting on Blaise’s chest. Draco merely nodded and squeezed her hand.
“Although,” Snape added after a moment, turning back to Umbridge, “I would like to know why you have my godson tied up like a common criminal.”
“Well, it wasn’t too bad, was it?” asked Hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. “I’m not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time – did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn’t sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much – and on questions twenty-three – “
Blaise shuddered slightly. “He was one of the few people I regret getting with,” he said. “It was at a party the Ravenclaw’s threw last year. Horrid person, he is.”
“What the fuck are you doing, Crabbe?” snapped Sarah. “You’re not a Prefect, you can’t take points.”
The crowd separated to let the four pairs of partners through. Cedric had Cho Chang on his arm and Fleur was accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, Roger Davies. Once they were all standing around Professor McGonagall, the doors opened to allow everyone else inside.
At every House table, Sarah could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore or else whispering fervently to their neighbours. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.
“Well, it’s a good thing you thrive on drama, isn’t it?” Lyra smirked, happily turning back to her own meal.
“No, I’m serious,” George continued with a grin. “The universe wouldn’t be able to cope if Lyra Malfoy was suddenly a Hufflepuff.”
“When did you get this?” Harry asked, folding the letter carefully despite his urge to rip it to shreds.
The Dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Sarah could panic any more, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street and a rough voice said, “Potter, in here, quick!”
Fred was silent for a long moment and Sarah knew he was thinking through his response. When it at last came, it was, “Have you thought at all about seeing a Mind Healer?”
“Well, you’re making a defense or a shield against someone trying to enter your mind,” Sarah explained. “Theoretically, if you learnt how to do it, you might be able to block Voldemort from your mind.”
“Can we go have cake now, darling?” Draco asked Harry, having finally gotten his breath back. “I spent much too long choosing the flavour to miss out.”
“Give this to Goyle if you can,” Hermione whispered. “It’ll knock him out for about an hour and he won’t remember it.”
“What the fuck, Pans?” she cried, turning around to see that Pansy had thrown a paperweight at her. “You could’ve knocked me out.”
They both muttered apologies and were silent for a few minutes as they dutifully took down notes. Eventually, Draco couldn’t stand the tense waves coming off of the other boy.
“I’m not worried about my father,” Sarah whispered. “Not really. I think it’s just the possibility that unnerves me.”
The spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretence, Ron pushed his chair backwards, as far away from Moody’s desk as possible.
“My game ended earlier than I thought,” Ginny said. She didn’t look too happy with the entire situation but Draco couldn’t really blame her. He, however, wanted to be as far away from the hostile redheads as he could get. Judging from Harry’s firm grip on Draco’s hand, he was out of luck.
She sighed as she began slowly flicking through the pages of the book. It was going to be a long night.
“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy – “
Fred and George jumped in surprise as she pushed between them and stopped at the end of Harry’s bed. He was lying completely still, his face as pale as Draco’s. a large bandage surrounded his head and his left arm was wrapped tightly in a sling.
“I can’t say I’d have any complaints about rooming with the Gryffindors,” Draco commented easily as though he hadn’t just bodily removed someone from his lap.
“Five points to Slytherin,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these are bowtruckles and, as Mr Malfoy rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?”
“Things will get better, Sarah,” he said, something unreadable flickering through his grey eyes. “It may not seem like it, but it will get better.”
“I’m not blamin’ yeh,” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s apology aside. “Though I would do some grovellin’ ter those two, they deserve it. Still tryna defend yer even when yer both being idiots. I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats. Tha’s all.”
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry sarcastically. Sarah snorted but Draco frowned slightly.
“If that’s a reference to him repeatedly hitting the floor earlier, I will break up with you,” Sarah said, threatening Fred with her fork.
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his two best friends. The war had finally brought them together and they were both happier because of it. Blaise absolutely adored Pansy, who loved the attention but also genuinely cared for the boy in return. The only other relationship similar seemed to be of Granger and Weasley but Draco didn’t want to think too long about them in that way.
Sarah and Theo glanced at each other. No matter everything Greg had done, being shipped off to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban wasn’t something he deserved.
Draco’s eyes lit up and he pulled Harry over to the bookcases, perusing them eagerly beside Hermione.
Sarah shrugged at Harry and Draco before following Dobby, her stomach growling at the delicious scents that assaulted her nose.
And then a silver hare, a boar and a fox soared past Sarah, Fred and Lee: the Dementors feel back before the creatures’ approach. Three more people had arrived from the dark corridors to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie and Seamus.
Fred snorted and lay an arm across Sarah’s shoulders, the smooth fabric of his robes tickling the bare skin.
“Cormac McLaggen,” Sarah replied. “Harry, Blaise and I met him when we had lunch with Slughorn on the train. He’s vile.”
stands for Selwyn…I am related to the Selwyns…Indeed, there a few pure-blood families to whom I am not related…A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be said for you. ‘
Sarah sighed and glanced across the hall, seeing Harry’s dark head bent toward Hermione’s and Ron’s.
Umbridge was now attending every Care of Magical Creatures lesson, looking for an opportunity to fire Hagrid. Thankfully, he was following the approved curriculum. After his disastrous first lesson back – where he had shown them Thestrals and Umbridge had arrived and mocked him for being a half-wit – he had been careful to avoid provoking the Defense teacher, as he was already on probation.
“This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St Mungo’s,” said Pansy, looking amused as she crumpled up the paper.
She threw the powder into the fire and shouted, “The Leaky Cauldron!” before pulling Harry into the fire behind her. They swirled in a haze of green flames and Sarah tightened her grip on Harry’s arm.
“I have a problem,” Harry announced to Hermione seconds after he had barged into her office at the Ministry.
“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hanging round our necks,” said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.
Harry’s green eyes filled with fire and he clenched his fists tightly at his sides. “Don’t call it that!”
The crowd surrounded them, pushing them in every direction. As it thickened, Sarah was wrenched from Fred’s grasp and pushed further away from the group.
A dark figure came bustling towards them, and Sarah saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s sword.
“He’s sided with Ron,” Hermione said miserably. “But I think that’s partially due to me. I snapped at him once by accident.”
She smirked down at him and leant down to kiss him. He reached up to thread one hand through her hair. When Sarah pulled back, they were both gasping slightly and Fred looked dazed.
“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and – “
Crabbe was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine much!”
Knowing that Fred and George were downstairs testing their new products on first years while Hermione glowered at them in disapproval, Harry frowned. He sent a message back to Draco.
“I’m so tired from helping Pomfrey,” Sarah explained. “And Smith, the little shit, tried to curse me in the corridor. I don’t think I can physically lift my arms. Pass me some of the roast, would you?”
She left the other students to talk amongst themselves as she followed Draco out of the Hall. She spotted Sirius curled up beside Remus on the makeshift hospital bed, both of them sleeping peacefully. Fred was sitting by George’s body again, and Sarah thought that he might have been talking quietly to his brother, telling him that they won, that they were okay.
“Harry, he definitely would not be making such an effort to spend time with you if he wasn’t interested,” she told him. “He also went out of his way to let Teddy spend time with the animals up for adoption.”
“May I?” said Professor McGonagall, but she didn’t wait for an answer before pulling the Firebolt out of the boys’ hands. She examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was no note at all, Potter? No card? No message of any kind?”
“We’ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed – “
“We’ve been helping Harry as well,” Sarah confessed. “I think it’s ridiculous to think that the champions should do it purely alone.”
“Let’s go,” Draco called from halfway up the stone steps. “This isn’t right. Sarah, Harry, come on, let’s go…”
“Oi!” Ron called after her. “We’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, Sarah and Draco, “she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What’re going to do in Binns’ class – read again?”
“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Sarah could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official. “If you’re telling the truth, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up.”
Professor McGonagall hurried over, her lips in a thin line. Before she could explain, Sarah started talking.
Harry took a deep breath and pinched his nose, reminding himself that she had sought out his help even though he had just landed her brother in the infirmary. The thought made his stomach churn uncomfortably.
Harry blinked at him a few times before he remembered how to respond. “What? Oh, I’m fine. Just a bit tired.”
She took a deep breath as the giant snake got close enough for her to feel its hot breath on the back of her neck. Deciding that petrification was more preferable than a venomous bite, Sarah opened her eyes wide and stared directly into the reflection of bright, yellow eyes above her.
The words had barely left her mouth when a great explosion of water erupted from the lake and Harry shot out of it. He landed heavily on the ground and Sarah immediately descended upon him.
“Nothing,” Draco said airily. “I’m just not surprised you didn’t let her speak. You have a habit of ignoring when people say something you don’t like.”
After she ended the curse this time, Bellatrix roughly pulled Sarah’s shirt up to expose her abdomen.
“Erm, not so pleasant, truthfully,” Sarah said, spinning widely before coming back to her original position. “Things have been getting worse, even before Dumbledore’s death.”
Sarah looked around and sniggered when she saw all the other children on the ground. Draco offered a hand to Harry while Fred and George pulled themselves to their feet.
A bandage unravelled at the mummy’s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.
“How long has this been going on?” Ron asked, eyes darting back and forth between them then falling onto the hand that Harry still had wrapped around Draco’s arm. He resisted the urge to drop it.
He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, “Whoops – my wand is a little overexcited – “
Harry started to explain, but more people arrived, causing him to stop and wait for everyone. By the time eight o’clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clinked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. He went to stand at Draco’s side and gripped his hand as Harry looked at everyone slightly nervously.
“Thank you, Luna,” Lyra replied, not sure how actually to respond to that. Luckily for her, Ginny appeared and dragged Luna off to dance. The youngest Weasley had finally started to become less icy towards Harry, Draco and Lyra, although Lyra blamed Luna’s influence on that.
Draco came to a quick stop as his brain tried to register the shock of seeing none other than Harry Potter standing in the middle of his clinic, a small brown bundle held securely in his arms.
“Not that we don’t appreciate this welcoming committee,” Draco said lowly, “But I would much rather have a shower and a nap before we have any intense conversations.”
Draco leant forward and gripped Harry’s hand tighter, not realising until that moment that he was still holding it.
Fred rolled his eyes fondly at her and said, “Draco talking about getting a drink after this. Apparently, a few of his colleagues were going to celebrate Hermione’s promotion. I asked if you wanted to go.”
To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term. Sarah didn’t really care about the trip and Draco had already declared that he was staying at the castle.
“NO!” shrieked Sarah, and with a deafening blast from her wand Fenrir Greyback was thrown backwards from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.
None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing.
“Well, I don’t own anything this casual,” Draco answered as if it were normal for them to share clothes. He picked at the grey fabric which Harry hadn’t realised matched his eyes so perfectly until that moment.
Harry’s head shot up when he heard them come down the stairs and he half-rose out of his chair, extending a hand toward Sarah.
She spun around and left the hall, pushing through the giant double doors and out onto the grounds. She didn’t bother to check that the others were following before making her way toward the lake and the large tree that she and Draco liked to study under.
Sarah pressed close to Fred again and gripped his hand tightly. Luckily, no one else had heard their conversation.
Harry smiled down at Sarah. “Five minutes in here and you manage to scare all my dormmates away,” he teased.
“Of course it is!” said Griphook with a nasty laugh. “Who amongst the wand-carriers protests when house-elves and goblins are slaughtered?”
“As some of you will have noticed,” she was saying, “we have an additional cohort with us this year. Due to lack of room in the normal House dormitories, the eighth years will be taking up residence in the newly renovated rooms which previously housed teachers in the East Wing. Professor Bayard will be your designated Head. Should you have any issues, please go to him. Now, Quidditch trials shall be held – “
Just after the hour was up, ripples appeared on the lake. Gasps rose from the stands as Cedric appeared, followed closely by Cho Chang. The Hogwarts students burst into cheers.
“Why so melodramatic, Coco?” she asked with a smirk. “Was it the amount of skin on show? Because, I have to say, even I was feeling a tad flustered.”
“Honestly, you two are so problematic sometimes…” she muttered as Harry laughed brightly behind her.
“Harry’s still angry that I haven’t told him our line-up,” she commented absently. “It’ll be quite amusing to see his face.”
“Friends of yours, Neville, dear?” said a formidable looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat decorated with a stuffed vulture. She must have been Neville’s grandmother.
“I vas hoping to catch you,” he said, his accent thick. “I thought I saw you earlier – may ve sit vith you?”
“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.”
devastated!” Blaise exclaimed. “I am merely in dire need of some sexual stimulation to relieve me of all this tension!”
He gaped at the far corner where Hermione, Harry, Draco, Luna and Rita Skeeter were all sitting grouped around a table.
too. Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry’s reactions. Most of them looked away when they caught sight of Sarah and Draco’s glares.
Something must have shown on his face because Draco leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s lips. “Everything okay?” he whispered.
“Harry’s boggart turns into a dementor,” Professor Lupin explained, looking at them curiously. “That means it will be a great help to us tonight – You and I just need to stay out of its line of sight, Sarah.”
Harry’s domineering figure allowed them all to march straight up to the fireplaces, which were currently being sealed, preventing anyone from exiting.
“They have spirit,” Weasley argued hotly. “I’m sure that with some better players, they’d do great.”
“I hadn’t been planning on going back anyway,” admitted Sarah. “There was always a chance that I would run into my father.”
Amanda opened her mouth to reply, her blue eyes bright, when suddenly the door to the room swung open, revealing the dishevelled boy standing in the doorway.
Professor Lupin hesitated for a moment but then said in a low voice, “I – er- never mentioned it to you and I don’t know if your mother did…but…well, she made me your godfather when you were born.”
“Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.”
“Right in one, pup!” Sirius grinned, falling into the seat opposite her. “Old Dumbly doesn’t want you kiddies in here.”
“I know you didn’t and it’s not really your fault that you didn’t,” she said softly. “But do you see now how you’ve been hurting everyone?”
“Such attitude,” Voldemort snarled, “I think I know how we can remedy that.” Voldemort smiled cruelly down at her and backed away.
“What a night,” he mumbled, falling into a well-loved armchair near the extinguished fireplace. “Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned…”
in a relationship,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “As soon as she realised he was dating Draco, she gave up on him. No point going for someone who bats for the other team.”
“I’ll look at that up at the castle,” she said as the bell echoed distantly over the grounds for the end of class.
They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were near a staircase far, far away from Lockhart’s office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them.
Harry and Sarah both settled back against the pillows. Sarah thought there was no chance of her falling asleep, but the soothing motion of Fred’s hand in her hair quickly drew her into a dreamless slumber and she tumbled into darkness without a second thought.
Harry nodded and cast the familiar charm. He began to slowly stroke Sarah’s hair until her breathing evened out. It was a long while until he drifted off to sleep.
. We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: the next password will be ‘Mad-Eye’. Keep each other safe: keep faith. Goodnight.”
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.
Harry ignored her again and watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.
It was Sarah’s turn to get examined by Greyback and it was with a sinking heart that she realised that she hadn’t changed her appearance.
“Oh, good, there you are,” Mrs Weasley gushed, patting down her hair. “We’ll be able to see him soon…”
“But she’d never let us live it down,” Harry pointed out. “She’d make lewd comments at every available moment.”
“What do you mean Smith tried to curse you?” Blaise demanded, piling some slices of meat and vegetables on her plate.
Sarah immediately jumped to the side to avoid his spell and shot her own back at him. Harry ducked so Sarah cast again while he was distracted. Harry swore and lunged forward to stop his wand from flying away. He shot a spell at Sarah who shielded it and shot another back. Harry cursed as his wand flew from his grip into hers.
She smiled up at him and brushed a hand through his messy hair. “Whether they mind or not doesn’t matter,” she said brightly. “I want you there so they can deal with it. Besides, they like you.”
“Er – it kinda sucked me into – I don’t even know what it was, truthfully. I think it was a memory,” he rambled.
“You were at the top of the North Tower!” Hermione said. “Your voice couldn’t have carried all the way down to the grounds!”
“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.”
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst of it out of his eyes.
Black conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright again, left arm chained to Draco’s right, right arm to Ron’s left. Ron’s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’ true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.
“What?” Draco said, looking around at them. “It’s in all the genealogy books. The Potters are direct descendants of Ignotus Peverell. He was quite a famous Potioneer, that’s why Harry’s family started creating potions.”
The new safety measures imposed on the students meant that the only chance they had of talking to Hagrid was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons.
“Easier said than done,” Harry muttered bitterly. He never thought he could hate someone more than Snape but Umbridge sure was testing it.
I say!” said Professor McGonagall’s voice through the darkness. “On what grounds are you attacking him? He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such – “
At long last, the reached the end of the tunnel. The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off.
But relaxing was the last thing on Sarah’s mind as the match drew closer. Draco, in particular, constantly found himself on the other end of Marcus Flint’s morning tirades.
?” Sarah said in a deathly quiet voice. The dichotomy between the two levels of sound shut everyone up as she glared at Ron. “I can’t imagine how horrible it must have been for you,
Through the dim glow of the lamps, Draco realised that the short figure was a goblin and that the face of the other man was strangely familiar.
“I’ll give Mr Potter a call this afternoon letting him know the surgery went well,” Rosie said, swirling her fluffy pen between fingers with nails painted vibrant blues, purples and pinks.
“Ugh I hate you, Sarah,” he groaned, turning to burrow his head in her back to avoid the sunlight now peaking through the clouds.
Lyra huffed behind him and quickened her pace, her shorter legs struggling to keep up with Draco’s long strides.
Sarah was tense as they crowded into the Potions classroom after lunch. She eyed Harry, Ron, and Hermione warily as the lesson progressed.
Sarah and Draco exchanged a quick look. “I got a letter from her the day after we got here. She said that she was okay and that we wouldn’t be able to contact her. She would contact us when she could.”
“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,” said Draco. “Ignotus Peverell.”
“This is mad,” Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his thestral’s neck. “Mad…if I could just see it – “
“Very well,” Draco said, smiling at the boy. “I shall endeavour to call you by this bizarre nickname.”
“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred, coming over and resting his arm around her shoulders. “We decided it was safer to leave it to him.
“You both would have been extremely helpful before; I usually need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Sarah idly played with Draco’s silky hair and chatted with Neville as she watched in amusement as Harry and Ron fought the crowd to get to their table.
The teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Slytherin twenty points when Sarah handed her a bag of fertiliser; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of speaking sugar mice on her at the end of Charms, said ”
It wasn’t surprising that their spirits were affected by whether they had a full stomach or not. Sarah knew that she was being harsh in rationing out the food they had but also realised it was necessary. Draco understood that and didn’t raise any issues. Harry was dealing with it extremely well, but Sarah feared it was due from him suffering periods of near starvation at the Dursley’s; Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights were Sarah only allowed them to make small meals until they found more food, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron’s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.
The tree’s branches were whipping around violently, stopping from them getting nearer. At the base of the trunk was a large gap in the roots – Ron was fighting furiously with the dog still dragging him away. Soon, all that was left was one leg, hooked around a root in an attempt to slow the dog down. But a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot and Sarah cringed; Ron’s leg had broken and a moment later, he vanished completely.
“It would change everything!” shouted Sarah. “For one, your friends wouldn’t be divided between each other. Have you noticed that Harry is staying by your side despite the fact that it’s causing him and Draco to fight? Harry knows you’re in the wrong but he’s still supporting you, even against his own
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder. Sarah saw the regret on Harry’s face that his plan had backfired.
Lyra hummed but didn’t say anything else on the topic. With a nod to them both in farewell, she raced across the common room and threw herself on top of Blaise, who was reclining on a couch.
“Well,” Ron said quietly as the others in the room began to talk loudly with George and Lee, “I was thinking – we need a way to
“No,” said Hermione, ignoring Sarah. She held the letter out to the boys, lip trembling. “I just thought you ought to know…Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.”
Draco, Harry and the others had congregated in Draco’s room, all of them somehow managing to fit on the large bed.
The pair trundled into the common room and waved at Blaise and Theo, who was sitting half-asleep by the fire.
“I did originally try,” she told him. “But after a few months of you both pining for each other with neither of you making any moves, I had enough.”
Harry went an even deeper red and hid his head in his hands. Ron made a pained sound and began to shovel food into his mouth.
“Maybe you need more practice,” she said happily. She threw their wands back to them and stalked up to Fred, giving him a quick kiss. “Less pranking, more practice.” She left them speechless behind them and arrived in time to see Pansy spectacularly disarm Blaise. He scowled at the dark-haired girl.
“M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets…”
Sarah swerved as a serpent lunged at her, she soared upwards and straight towards where Ron, Hermione, Harry, Draco and Goyle had vanished. Then, through the smoke, Sarah saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled her lungs and she collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
“Nearly eleven,” replied Harry. He got up to get her a cup of tea which she gratefully accepted. “Remus said that the Weasleys might be coming over today. They obviously don’t know that I’m here yet.”
“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Sarah noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?”
“I – erm – well – “ Harry stuttered, blushing a bright pink. “I was going to see if you were okay,” he finally said. “I wanted to apologise.”
“My turn, love,” Sarah said brightly, plonking herself into Hermione’s vacated seat. “All your training has lead up to this moment.”
“I’m fine,” she said softly. But her eyes pricked with tears. She placed her head in her hands and tried to hold back the sobs that threatened to break out from her.
“Just making up for all those years you insulted my family,” George replied airily, not looking the least bit annoyed.
“It wasn’t my information to tell,” Draco bit out. “I wasn’t going to go around shouting about how Neville’s parents were in the Janus Thickey ward because my aunt tortured them until they lost their minds!”
Harry tapped his foot as he waited impatiently in the abandoned classroom. Sarah was late. What if Draco didn’t want to talk to him? What if they couldn’t move past this? Merlin, he had
“But I want to help!” Harry exclaimed. “I want to know how we’re fighting against Voldemort. Has Fudge finally come to his senses yet?”
“That’s my final decisions and if you don’t get out of the way for the Keepers I’ll hex you,” Harry bellowed at the rejected Beaters.
,” she whispered. She felt her magic flow through her arm and out her wand and gasped when a silvery mist formed, before disappearing just as fast.
“More?” said Mundungus. “That wouldn’t have been effing difficult…bleedin’ gave it away, did’n’ I? No choice.”
“That’s it!” exclaimed Sarah, standing up and gripping her wand. “Harry – change of plans, we’re going straight to curses and Draco has just volunteered as test subject.”
Time ticked by slowly, the only sounds being Draco’s even breaths and the quiet noises of animals outside. Harry nodded off at one point, his head resting on Sarah’s shoulder. She sat in silence, watching as Draco’s bandaged chest rose up and down. Every two hours, she tipped a potion down his throat and then some water, cringing at his bloodless face. In the early morning, Madam Pomfrey told Sarah to get some rest and promised to watch over Draco. Exhausted, she sagged against Harry’s side and let herself fall into a dreamless slumber.
“Very well,” she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. “Very well, Mr Potter…I have offered you the chance t tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Vincent – fetch Professor Snape.”
“Professor McGonagall already had the same speech with Harry and me, so spare me if you will,” Sarah muttered.
Out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. They all fell backwards, Neville’s legs waving wildly. Suddenly, they kicked Harry’s hand and the prophecy went flying from his grasp.
They raced back the way they came, down the winding stairs and out into the middle of a raging battle. It seemed that only a few Death Eaters had gone to see Dumbledore’s demise while the others remained down here to deal with what was obviously the Order and some members of Dumbledore’s Army. Hermione’s shocked, bloody face caught Lyra’s eye as they ran past and Lyra hoped she looked distraught enough to communicate that she wasn’t willingly following Severus.
Her feet slammed into the ground; Draco staggered slightly into her and she held his taller figure upright. The Portkey dropped to the ground with a heavy thud.
“And I see that now,” Lupin calmly replied. “But the Malfoy’s I grew up with and knew never would have acted the way Draco acts. I know he is different from his father.”
Sarah ignored Mr Diggory’s reply. She leant against Fred and closed her eyes, smiling when she felt his arms wrap around her.
“It’s fucking frigid!” Draco snapped, pulling his scarf higher up his face. “My nose is going to fall off.”
“You know…” Lyra said carefully, “you could always take a chance with Harry? It might go better than you think.”
“Because Dumbledore left the five of us a job,” Draco said carefully, “and we weren’t supposed to tell anyone – I mean, he wanted Harry to do it, and us – “
doing there in the first place – why did you suddenly arrive back with the boy? How do I know that this isn’t some jacked-up plot of yours to embarrass me?” Fudge blustered, his face gradually getting redder and redder.
Behind him, Lucius’s breath quickened. His father stepped forward and placed an arm around Draco’s shoulders.
They heard the front door open close and a moment later, Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.
Sarah was beginning to fall behind on her homework. She now began to follow Harry up to the Gryffindor common room to complete her homework alongside him, as he as drastically behind as well. She helped him with his Potions essay while he redrew her bowtruckle diagram, being surprisingly proficient at sketching. When they finished, they staggered up to Harry’s room, where they fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep immediately.
She rounded a corner and nearly plummeted through a hole in the floor, barely throwing herself back in time, arms pinwheeling to keep her balance. A pair of arms grabbed her own and pulled her out of harm’s way, causing her to collapse against her rescuer.
Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Sarah sagged back against Fred, tears streaming silently down her face.
“I dropped Divination,” Hermione repeated. “Professor Trelawny was going on again about the Grim and how my mind was ‘so hopelessly mundane’ and I just gave up – walked right out.”
“You sure?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment. He once again grasped the packing case lid. “Concentrating hard? All right – go!”
Suddenly both she and Potter were swept aside. Professor Snape knelt down near the fallen boy and began muttering an incantation over his chest. As he waited for the spell to work, the Professor barked some orders at Potter, who raced from the room, returning a few minutes later out of breath, and clutching a book to his chest.
Lyra looked at the other small body and realised that it was a first year Ravenclaw. Their arms were curled around their body as tears streamed down their face. Across from them, Lyra saw Draco appear in the crowd, his face paling as he looked down at his best friend.
A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters.
“I also went to the liberty to add some things I think will be useful,” Sirius went on. He was smirking widely at the teenagers’ discomfort. “And I know I’m no artist but I threw in some diagrams to help you understand some positions – “
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately – and separately. It’s urgent.”
On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Sarah spent her lunches in the hospital wing with Madam Pomfrey, learning the basics of Healing and occasionally helping tend to the simplest cases. More than once, Harry or one of the twins slouched in sheepishly with injuries varying from a twisted ankle from falling down the stairs (Harry), burns (Harry), and suspicious boils or unstoppable nosebleeds (Fred and George). Sarah would always just roll her eyes and direct them to the beds she and Madam Pomfrey had unofficially designated as their own before tending to them.
“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they’ll be fine. And a Death Eater is dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere – “ Fred said.
“We should at least give her a chance to explain,” urged Sarah. “I would give you that opportunity if you ever broke up with Harry.”
This meant that Sarah, Draco and Hermione focused primarily on their increasing workload, as well as putting the final edits to Buckbeak’s case.
Draco brushed the fur off his coat and quickly washed his hands before stepping through the swinging doors.
“I’m glad you’re back,” she said sincerely. She nodded at Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Narcissa before following Ron through the Floo in a flash of green fire.
“No…she wouldn’t tell me…and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and…and then I tried to grab it from her…and – and – “
“Even I’m on it,” Sarah said, pointing at a branch off to the side. The name ‘Sarah Deaumont’ shined in bright gold letters under ‘Antonius Deaumont’. “It even shows that I’m related to the Malfoys further back. Not surprising, considering we were two of the largest pureblood families from France…”
He laughed nastily and hauled Sarah toward the door. Hermione was being held roughly by Cassius Warrington. Sarah watched in dread as Umbridge stalked down the corridor, Ginny and Luna following behind her being pushed forward by other members of the Inquisitorial Squad. They were pushed into the office, where Umbridge had pulled Harry’s head out of the fire and grabbed both his and Draco’s wand. Another loud commotion sounded and Ron and Neville were led through the door, Goyle and Montague grasping their arms tightly.
“You can’t say you don’t want to show off a bit,” Sarah counted, accepting his arm and allowing him to lead them through the now empty common room and corridors.
“Don’t be ridiculous, I still have the money that Narcissa exchanged for me at Gringotts – your parents don’t have to give me any,” retorted Sarah, quickly changing into the clothes Hermione had laid out.
his girlfriend!” – but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive them all this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with her about Ron’s feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Sarah would have happily forgone.
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and tuned, his eyes comber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying toward him.
They all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Sarah could hear them sprinting down the corridor.
As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: all five of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.
,” Sarah reminded him, calmly throwing a hex at George. Harry was having them revise some of the spells they had learnt last term. He and Draco were currently walking through the crowd, adjusting posture and offering advice. Harry was stubbornly avoiding going anywhere near Cho and had asked Hermione to check that area considering Sarah was busy consoling her angry boyfriend. “It’s not like I didn’t not just tell you.”
“Talk soon!” she called as her mother shooed her out the door. “And remember what I said about beetle dung!”
“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to ‘Arry Potter in person,” he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.
“As a matter of fact, Blaise,” Draco said with a smirk. “I quite enjoyed that bit.” He turned to Pansy and said sweetly, “Darling, may I have my scarf back now?”
Sarah groaned as Professor Snape strode toward her. He looked furious; his black eyes were flashing and his thin lips were curled into a deep scowl.
Harry beamed at her and released her. “Eat up then. We’ll let the others know what we’re going and then go.”
Draco was, as expected, furious. Not as much as with what Ron had said but more that he thought Draco didn’t care about Harry.
Lyra lay beside Draco, watching his chest rise and fall shallowly. He had been unconscious for three days now, with Lyra herself only waking the day before. Tremors still shook both their bodies and Lyra watched as Draco stirred in his sleep, face contorted into a grimace.
Harry threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose. Mundungus stand of stale sweat and tobacco smoke, his hair was matted and his robes stained.
,” she stated firmly. “I won’t have you grieving me for the rest of your life. You will know that I will always love you and then you’ll be happy.”
“It probably was just a hex,” Sarah said. Movement suddenly caught her eye and she saw Fred racing toward their table.
Lyra shook her head. “Forgiven,” she said. “Now, are you finally going to confess to Draco or will you continue the way you are?”
She turned around to see Professor Lupin standing beside her, smiling and wearing a threadbare Gryffindor scarf.
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting…A few people kept checking their watches…
With that, she disappeared up a cramped set of stairs. Weasley led them into the living room and Lyra allowed Draco to place them on the couch, angling himself slightly in front of her.
Sarah sat up, ignoring Madam Pomfrey’s tuts and saw that Draco, Harry and Hermione were in the beds opposite hers. Ron’s red hair stuck up wildly from the bed next to hers.
“Oh – er – “ Harry said haltingly. His eyes darted to where Draco was still sitting, face suddenly an indifferent mask rather than the open smile it had been minutes before. “Well – “
He sighed deeply and observed her for a moment. “You’ve mentioned issues with your father previously. With me being your godfather, it would mean that, if you wanted, you could come live with me during the holidays instead of going back to your father…” Lupin said carefully, looking straight ahead.
“Do you think it’s theirs and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Draco snorted.
He was propped up next to Draco against a tree as the blond read. Ron was lying across Sarah’s legs as she tried to braid sections of his hair.
“I never said tha’” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway, “Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on midnight, I need ter – “
When her name was called, she smiled once at the others and then walked calmly into the Hall. She exited at the end extremely happy with her results. They weren’t permitted to go back into the small chamber and were instead send to their common rooms to have some time to study before dinner. After dinner, Sarah, Draco, Theo, Blaise and Pansy submerged themselves in studying for Transfiguration next day.
“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,” he said, shooing some of the younger students away. “
? But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter and Malfoy using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown?”
“Sirius, I’ve seen some weird things in pureblood houses,” Sarah said as she eyed the cabinets with slight disgust, “But your family is on a whole ‘nother level.”
Lupin sighed. “I didn’t know how much like your mother you were,” he answered earnestly. “I feared that you would take more after your father – especially once I had heard you were best friends with a Malfoy.”
“That’s Fudge’s voice,” Mrs. Weasley whispered. “And that’s Minerva McGonagall, isn’t it? But what are they arguing about?”
“Come on, we have to get him to the hospital wing,” Draco said and Lyra rushed forward to take some of Blaise’s deadweight. Pansy tried to assist as they trudged along the corridors but she was still blinded by tears, her face as white as a sheet.
“But Sirius said he couldn’t go anywhere, there wasn’t anyone else he could take orders from?” Harry said.
“That’s a shame,” Bagman shook his head comically. “I was hoping to discuss the goblins with Antonius, he always did know how to deal with them.”
“You need to get out of here,” he whispered. Sarah stared at him, open-mouthed. “I mean it, Sarah. Find the others and get out. Vince is here too. He wants Potter.”
Why couldn’t his life be simple for once? Why couldn’t he have just fallen in love with Ginny and gone and had the perfect life complete with kids, house and a dog, like everyone expected of him.
Tuesday was Care of Magical Creatures, with Astronomy theory Wednesday morning and the practical at midnight. That afternoon was devoted to Divination, Arithmancy and Ancient Studies.
The fifth years’ workload was also increasing as O.W.Ls drew steadily closer. Every afternoon found large groups of fifth and seventh years piled into the library, stacks of books hiding each other from view, the only sounds being the scratch of quills on parchment. Harry and Sarah had hardly found any time to make a lesson plan for patronuses, so Harry kept pushing it further and further back.
Harry’s shout had awoken the other boys in the dorm as well as Sarah. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.
“Draco and I are friends, Ron,” he explained. “He helps review my books.” It was a very thin explanation for what he and Draco talked about but Harry didn’t think that Ron would be able to comprehend the thought that Harry fancied the blond, regardless of said blond’s potential feelings in return.
“The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,” continued Bagman. “The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.”
The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favourite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read “Pinhead,” kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Sarah didn’t even care that Crabbe was making loud, snide remarks about their new sweaters from the Slytherin table. Pansy and Blaise had joined Sarah and Draco at the Gryffindor table, seeming as if they belonged there.
“Boys, if you don’t want to out yourselves to Draco’s parents, try acting a bit confused,” Sarah advised, inclining her head in Lucius and Narcissa’s direction.
“We had a mishap with Neville’s plant,” Harry explained, looking very happy now that his boyfriend was sitting next to him.
“And Harry is just dependent,” Draco said as his boyfriend waved impatiently at them. “We better go before they come over here and drag us away.”
“Right, we should get going!” Lyra said suddenly, jumping to her feet. “Harry, lead on, darling. Should soothe the masses hopefully,” she added in an undertone, the only indication of her worry.
“Very well, thank you, Sarah,” Luna said in her dreamy voice. “That Wrackspurts have been clearing up this month – it’s been very refreshing.”
“Er – how are you, Professor?” said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron’s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Lockhart’s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place, though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry, Ron and Draco’s memories at the time, Sarah’s sympathy was limited.
Sarah just shrugged in reply. They skidded to a halt about ten metres away from the pitch where the rest of the team was waiting.
Sarah and Harry quickly backtracked to lean against the wall and Draco’s steps faltered in surprise when he turned the corner to see them.
Lyra stuck her tongue out at him childishly. He copied the action before they both burst into laughter.
“Enough, Crabbe,” she snapped. “Your insults are childish. Come find us to spar when you finally grow up.” She pushed past the dark-haired boy, who was now flushing in anger.
“I’ll be seventeen in two- and a-bit months’ time,” said Ron grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!”
“It’s okay for you to have bad days,” he said. “If you need to cry, you can. If you need to shout, you should. Don’t let what others think get to you.”
“Hmm,” hummed Sarah, remembering Fudge’s purple face as he argued with Dumbledore about Voldemort’s return. “Guess we’ll have to watch ourselves then.”
“You’re not a disappointment or a burden,” he continued. Harry turned toward her and caught her eyes, green locking onto her altered grey. “Draco told me what your father writes to you,” he added sheepishly.
The term began to pass extremely quickly, each week bringing a new level of control for the Ministry. Professor Trelawny was publicly sacked by Umbridge one evening, her distraught screams still echoing off the stone walls hours after Dumbledore had stepped in to keep her in the castle. A centaur named Firenze – the same one who had rescued Sarah and Harry in the forest in their first year – replaced Professor Trelawny as Divination professor. Umbridge was furious and had enacted another Educational Degree, tightening the Ministry’s lease around Hogwarts.
Mrs Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Remus strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.
“It was so much fun!” Teddy said. “Do you get to pat cats and dogs all day, Draco? I saw all the other ones in the cages when we visited Fluffy. Are they all hurt?”
He nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a particularly horrid pair of socks, which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.
The rest of the funeral passed extremely quickly and before she knew it, Sarah was standing at the kitchen of the Burrow, watching out the window as the Weasley boys finished filling in George’s grave. Fred had chosen to have him buried beneath a favourite tree of theirs; apparently, there had been an incident when they were children where they climbed the tree and George had fallen out, claiming that he was dying when in reality he had a tiny scratch on his knee. Fred had thought it was fitting.
Harry rested his head against the pillows as Draco began to prepare him slowly, gently pushing his fingers in and out in stretching motions. Harry pulled Draco up to kiss him as Draco slowly entered him, both of them moaning into each other’s mouths.
Theo hesitated slightly before saying, “Apparently he’s taken some time off for personal reasons. His usual business is conducting itself.”
Harry stared at his boyfriend with tear-lined eyes and took Draco’s free hand, holding it tightly in his own.
A tense silence followed Sarah’s outburst. She sank back into the chair, unaware that she had even risen from it.
Sarah started at the sudden voice behind her. She didn’t know how long she had been standing in front of the office, building up the courage to knock.
“Honestly dear, call me Poppy already,” Madam Pomfrey said with an exasperated sigh. “You make me feel old.
“I’m not sure how I’m feeling,” Draco confessed to her, staring down at their clasped hands. “I know I should be sad but I think I’m more…relieved?”
“Don’t worry about that,” he said, wrapping his arms around her waist. “Narcissa will deal with it.”
She pushed the thought away and tried to put a smile on her face. Judging by Theo’s tightened grip around her shoulders, she guessed she hadn’t done such a good job.
She waved her arm pathetically around at the horizon which mainly consisted of fields, grass and yep, you guessed it, more fields. There was a group of weak-looking saplings at the top of the hill they had just climbed.
They had barely managed to wake up in time for breakfast and the day just got worse from there. First, her father sent her another letter warning her against her chosen friendships and calling her a ‘disappointment to her pureblood legacy’. She choked back the tears that threatened to make an appearance and instead scrunched the note up, throwing it onto her empty plate. Her mood lifted only slightly as she watched the parchment burn.
“So, how has Draco been threatening you?” she asked brightly. “You looked as if you may vomit at one point.”
There was a bang and flash of red light as the Snatcher was Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand.
Hermione turned back to the window as Sarah settled more comfortably into her seat. After a few minutes of silence, Hermione sighed and said, “I know what you’re going to say.”
Sirius drew Sarah aside later that night and muttered to her quietly, “Do you still have the Mandrake leaf?”
“I said, drop them!” Bellatrix screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione’s throat; Sarah saw beads of blood appear there.
Sarah began to explain but broke off when Professor Dumbledore stood up to the podium in from of the teacher's table.
Ten minutes later, Sarah, Draco, Hermione and Ron sat in a small huddle under a large Umbrella charm. Draco cast a few Impervious charms around the edges to stop the wind whipping them and Hermione dried their clothes. It wasn’t the most comfortable but it was bearable.
“You know I could have walked down that entire last corridor?” Sarah said, poking Harry’s limp form.
Draco nodded in agreement and flashed Harry a tight smile. The other man’s response looked more like a pained grimace than a smile.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor was barely leading, sixty to fifty. Ron had been making some truly spectacular saves, despite Sarah, Blaise and Simon’s best attempts. Victor was also struggling slightly against Gryffindor’s Chasers, the benefit being that Sarah managed to get through some complicated goals. Her Beaters were working spectacularly together, breaking up the Gryffindor formations whenever they attempted to gang up on Victor.
Sarah and Draco were absolutely useless while Harry took down the baubles, his face blushing a dark red the entire time. By the time he had finished, Sarah and Draco had gotten the worst of their laughter under control – until they would look at the blushing teen and burst into uncontrollable giggles again. This was how Luna Lovegood found them when she wandered in through the door.
“Draco has both their tickets,” Narcissa said, smoothing down Draco’s hair. “Be good and I’ll see next summer, I imagine you’ll want to stay at Hogwarts during Christmas break.”
Harry thought for a moment and finally said. “I don’t know, Sarah. I didn’t expect to live this long.”
They crept forward, staring behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near-total darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as empty lanterns. They passed row eighty-four…eighty-five…Sarah was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement.
Sarah felt smug at the idea of Ron having to suffer through detention with Argus Filch, the caretaker who was loathed by the entire school.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Neither of them asked when they would be allowed to stop. They knew Umbridge was watching them for signs of weakness and Sarah refused to show any, not even if that meant she had to sit here all night, cutting open her own hand with this quill…
For one nasty moment, Sarah thought that Hagrid was going to lead them into the forest and she felt Draco tense up beside her. He was even more traumatised by forests after the incident in their first year. Luckily, Hagrid strolled around the edge until they found themselves outside a kind of paddock.
Draco scoffed. “I think you’re underestimating the Slytherin in her,” he said. “No way she could have convinced them all to do it without an ounce of cunning.”
“If you see Draco on the way back, can you warn him please?” Sarah said sweetly. “He may not want to kiss his boyfriend when he’s covered in sap.”
Both Draco’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Draco hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horror-struck at what he had done.
“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means I only need to stay here for four days. Then I can – “
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.”
The three Chaser candidates hopped onto their brooms and into the air, Ginny flying up behind them. Sarah barely contained her grimace as she watched them fail to catch and pass the Quaffle.
Draco rolled his eyes again and grabbed his bag. When he got to the door he turned around and said quietly, “Bye Harry.”
“I’ll talk to Dumbledore,” he whispered and Sarah clung to him. “I’ll tell him I won’t do it anymore.”
“You are hardly the first student to covert the diadem,” she said disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered me – “
“And I’d distract you as you cooked,” Sarah went on, “probably scarring aforementioned friends enough to make them send warning before dropping by.”
‘em.” He reached forward and grabbed Sarah’s copy out of her hand and unravelled the rope around it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.
Ron opened the door and rattled the bars gently. He leant further out – Sarah grabbed his shirt to keep him from falling – and rapped his knuckles on the window.
“You’re right,” Lupin agreed softly. “I should have. I should have done many things but I didn’t. And now, all I can do is ask you for your forgiveness. I shouldn’t have kept that information from you but I know that if I had to do it again, I would – if only to keep you from the pain you, and Harry, and are feeling.”
“Lyra, Draco! There you are, I thought you might have forgotten,” Granger called, waving them over to a table that, amazingly enough, had some free space left. Unfortunately, Granger’s shout had attracted the attention of all the other Gryffindors in the room.
“If you’d just stop and listen for a minute I’ll tell you what I think,” Sarah said, raising her eyebrow and waiting until Harry nodded and remained quiet. “I don’t think Voldemort is possessing you. But I
“You are right,” she finally conceded. “Antonius would do such a thing – even to his own daughter.” She shook her head in disgust. “I’ll make sure you won’t have to go back there again,” she vowed.
Snape’s jaw tightened as he spun back to his desk. “It would do you well not to interrupt me again, Miss Deaumont,” he said quietly, a harsh edge to his words. “That, however, did not encompass the actual identifying descriptors…”
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks – I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock.
“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.
No matter how many times Sarah did, Apparation still sucked. Fred steadied her when they landed in the Burrow’s garden.
The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Sarah, Draco, Ron, Harry, Hermione, Fred, George and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet Stunned, the other Transfigured: and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed, temporarily, at bay, the world was rent apart. Sarah felt herself flying through the air, and all she could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was her one and only weapon and shield her head in her arms: she heard the screams and yells of her companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them –
The music started and all the couples began to move smoothly across the golden floor. Out of the corner of her eye, Sarah saw a bemused looking Draco leading a hopeless Harry.
“Well, now that that’s all over, I’m starving,” Sarah announced, jumping off the bed and grabbing Harry’s arm. “Come on, darling, we’re getting food. You’re looking a little peaky.”
“You scared the kid half to death!” Draco exclaimed, laughing slightly. “He was so worried the two of you were going to be separated.”
?” Sarah said sarcastically, crossing her arms with an unimpressed look on her face. “Well, I guess that makes it all better then.”
“I want us heard,” she answered quickly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. “You’ll see…I hope…”
“I’d hope you be on my side,” Draco said, glancing at her and frowning slightly. “But I don’t like that idea.”
“You’ll be pleased to know that the Ton-Tongue Toffees work,” George said to Fred gleefully. “Mum gave Dad a right earful when he explained what happened – we’re going to have to be on the lookout.”
“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.
Sarah turned to Harry and said, “We’ll see you back downstairs.” Harry nodded and Sarah pulled Draco out of the ward and back down the stairs.
“Mr Lovegood,” Draco said evenly. “We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But – “
“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means – I don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive – but we can ask Mr Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important!”
them, don’t we? And what do we know has the ability to destroy them?” He paused expectantly to give them a moment.
Draco couldn’t help it, he burst into uncontrollable giggles. Harry soon followed and they lay there, laughing madly in the afterglow.
His black eyes seemed focused on Harry and Sarah was worried about whatever horrible treatment he was planning for her friend. The bell rung then and all the students scrambled to leave the classroom.
“’Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing thinks from inside You-Know-Who’s snake…Obviously, Potter doesn’t realise what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him – “
“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “He, along with the help of Sarah Deaumont, risked their lives to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts. They showed bravery in facing Lord Voldemort.”
Sarah groaned. “This is going to back it so much harder for Draco to beat you,” she said, looking at the Firebolt reverently.
“Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it,” said Fred fairly, squeezing Sarah fondly.
“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Sarah. “Sirius was horrible to him. And when he was ordered to get out, he went to the next member of the family – Narcissa.”
Sarah saw the exact moment Harry and Ron realised they had forgotten about their promise to Hagrid. Harry glanced at Sarah and Draco was grimaced when they sent unimpressed looks their way. With all the fuss about the Firebolt and then Scabbers, neither of the boys had made any effort to join Hermione, Sarah and Draco in researching – and the trio wasn’t interested in asking them to join either.
“All right,” he said quietly to them. “OK!” he called to the Room at large, and all noise ceased. “There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Something – something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?”
“You’re such a dick!” she hissed at Draco, scowling half-heartedly before turning around and settling into her original position.
“Er – yeah, he is really good at it,” Harry said, commenting on Sarah’s previous words. “I feel loads better, now.”
Lyra looked around the room and had to admit that, despite what it lacked in finesse, the Burrow was quiet homely in a very cramped, messy way. There was something on every surface whether it be a crochet doily, a well-thumbed book or a gleaming photograph. Mismatched chairs and cabinets were scattered around the room, all facing the weather-worn fireplace, currently unlit in the Spring heat.
She rested her head on his shoulder and just stood with him as his family grieved around him. A sudden thought struck her.
Crabbe and Goyle were standing in the doorway. All of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing than Sarah had ever seen them. It infuriated her.
“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. “I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”
Draco shook his head. “It’s a miracle that I manage to get up in time to feed the animals at the clinic,” he said after taking a large gulp of coffee. “Rosie keeps telling me that I should do the afternoon shifts just so that I can sleep in.”
“I didn’t know you two were together,” she said bluntly, her grip tightening on the glass she held. “How long has this been a thing?”
“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows – at lease, not that cruse sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.”
They stook a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Sarah heard Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: they zoomed through it. Water filled Sarah’s eyes and mouth: she could not see or breath; then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Sarah heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something and felt herself glide back towards the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over,” Harry said, playing for time.
The sudden shout caused everyone to jump. A moment later, Granger appeared in the doorway with her hands on her hips, glaring at her husband. Her expression faltered for a second when she saw Draco beside Harry but it soon returned in full force.
“Yes, I know,” snapped Hermione. “He was the only person I could think of who would really annoy Ron.”
Madame Maxime had drawn herself to her full, and considerable height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle filled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.
“Yes, well…” Draco floundered for an explanation. At this point, Cassandra and Charles weren’t even pretending not to be eavesdropping. They both watched on in gleeful interest, identical smiles spreading across their dark features. Draco sighed heavily. “The boy – Edward – he’s my cousin, or at least, his mother was.” The others’ mouths dropped open in shock but Draco continued. “I guess a part of me wants to make sure he knows I do actually care about his pet. I never got to know him, our families were…estranged.”
me, Padfoot,” Remus interrupted, glancing at Sirius in an unimpressed manner. “Why don’t the children go up to their rooms while you and I have a
She stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
people?” Sarah said as she joined the group. Harry and Ron had saved some seats near them at the front of the table so the Slytherins split up to sit down. Draco dragged Sarah over to the two seats beside Harry, despite her glare.
Fred nuzzled her neck and tightened his arms around her. Pressing a kiss to the hollow where her neck met her shoulder, he said, “Don’t worry about it, babe. You’re here now.”
“That’s right,” said Remus encouragingly, “come on, let’s all…let’s all have a drink while we’re waiting.
“He wanted me to bring his body back,” Harry muttered. “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents.”
Just then, Ron accidentally nudged a fallen goblet with his foot and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.
“They’re staying,” Sirius said stubbornly, the echo of his and Mrs Weasley’s argument from a few weeks ago hanging in Sarah’s memory.
up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.
“Are you projecting your sexual frustration onto me?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. He pushed his way into the common room and quickly found an empty corner to sit in. Lyra dropped down beside him and lowered her voice.
“I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Crabbe, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?” asked Umbridge sharply. “In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that school children should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these” – she gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville, Draco, Hermione, and Luna – “escape.”
Ten days of horrid, terrifying written and practical examinations until they couldn’t tell up from down.
Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.
Sarah smiled at him and ran a hand along his face. “Someday, we’ll have a nice house with a cat and maybe one or two kids running around. I’ll be a Healer and you’ll run the joke shop. We’ll be incredibly busy and we’ll probably fight about stupid things but every day, we’ll both come home to a house full of life and know without a doubt that we love each other.”
“The legend of the Hallows is true,” Sarah said. “Mother and Narcissa used to tell it to Draco and me all the time as children. Draco, didn’t your great-uncle get lost looking for them?”
“All this snow!” Hermione whispered. “Why didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints! We’ll just have to get rid of them – you and Draco go in front, Harry – Sarah and I’ll do it – “
“I really hope you’re right about this Luna,” she called as she gripped blindly at the horse-like body beneath.
“I think I want to create things – fix things. I think I want to try to restore my parents’ old house,” he said at last, finally turning toward Sarah. Her face was lit up by the sunset and her blue eyes were shining brightly at him as she smiled widely. “What?”
The pair sat there, laughing at the top of their lungs whilst clinging to each other, tears of mirth running down their faces – the pain of before long pushed aside for joy.
Sarah shook her head and ducked closer to Fred’s chest. The sound of his heartbeat beating strongly under her ear helped calm her own erratic one.
Ron nodded quickly. “I spoke to them before I came here. That’s how I knew where you were – Harry told me.”
Sarah watched as Harry choked the Gillyweed and dove into the water, waving his wand absently at his face to secure his glasses to his face.
“Snape never beat Dumbledore,” announced Harry. “Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! He was planning on dying undefeated, the wand’s last true master!”
“Right you are, Hermione,” agreed Lupin. “But the four of them were unregistered. They would keep my company during my transformations and keep me in check as we wandered the grounds.”
Madam Pomfrey suddenly came storming over, shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!”
The excitement of soon being able to discover her Animagus form filled Sarah up so much that people began asking if she had been taking a Mood Improving Potion. They (Fred or George) usually received a punch to the arm in return.
He kissed Draco’s cheek quickly and waved to everyone before walking to where his Uncle Vernon was waiting with a frown on his ugly face. Harry ignored his uncle’s question and just marched away into the crowd, his uncle struggling to hurry after him.
“Really, that’s no way to speak to of a pureblood,” Sarah said. “It’s no wonder Narcissa doesn’t visit you.”
“I sent my mother an owl,” Draco said in a rush. “Luckily, I caught her on a day that father was out doing business. She said that Kreacher
Draco’s eyes lit up in excitement and he immediately turned toward Harry and wrapped his arms around the other boy’s neck.
“Millicent is shagging Anthony Goldstein now,” Blaise said breezily. However, the effect was ruined by his pinched expression. “That caused quite a scene a few hours ago.”
On the day of the trip, Sarah, Harry and Draco waved goodbye to Ron and Hermione and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still and quiet.
“Blaise, pay attention!” he cried. “What was I thinking? I must have gone completely mad. Saying he could
“Thank you, Lyra, seriously,” he said sincerely. “If you ever need anything, you let me know, okay?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he sounded sincere. “So…Sarah’s always shouted at me about this but…do you think I was being possessed?”
“You mean to tell me that this whole time you’ve been building up the courage to tell me you loved me?” Draco smirked.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “Voldemort wanted to know what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t know.”
“I’m twenty-five, Draco, not thirty,” Pansy drawled. “I’m allowed to have fun. It’s not like I have to settle down anytime soon, despite what my mother thinks.”
“I’m fine, pup,” Sirius said, managing a small smile. “It’ll take a lot more than a few harsh words to break me.”
“Yes, I dare,” said Harry, “I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?”
Ron was gasping for breath on the couch, the platter of mince pies forgotten. “Oh Merlin, you should see your face, Sarah –
“One of the only good ones,” Blaise tutted in a teasing tone. A winning smile crossed his face as they reached the table. “Padma, darling, would you be interested in a dance? If Ronald has no objections?”
Draco huffed a breath but answered anyway, ignoring the way that his voice shook slightly at the intensity in those emerald irises. “All right,
“Sorry,” he replied, slightly sheepishly. He tilted his head toward her, watching her carefully. “So…you’ll come with us to the Burrow?”
“Considering that Potter won’t talk,” muttered Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, “maybe a bit of incentive will loosen his tongue. I hear you’ve apparently undergone this curse before, Deaumont?” Umbridge raised her wand again.
“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased. “Weasley’s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole stock, we’re going to have to start again from scratch now…”
“I shouldn’t have acted the way I did, you guys were just trying to help me out,” he went on, the tips of his ears were a bright red and clashed horribly with his hair. “I’m just – you know what I’m like when you guys talk about money – I really am sorry,” he finished lamely.
“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good…”
“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the low coffee table with the usual, sonorous, clanking crash.
The three Gryffindors finally reached her; Potter sitting down immediately in front of her while the other two awkwardly shuffled behind him. He gave them a pointed glance until they sighed, settling down on either side of him.
He bid her goodnight, kissed her on the cheek, and then left in the direction of Gryffindor Tower. Sarah didn’t stop to talk to anyone still awake in the common room and instead rushed to bed, hiding herself beneath the warm covers.
The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face.
“I need to talk to you in private,” Harry muttered to the four of them as the train picked up speed.
Draco’s affronted protests mingled with Sarah’s laughter and were swallowed up by the night as they walked back to the house.
“I just wish I could get out of here,” Hermione grumbled. “I’m so bored. What’s been happening in the school now that Dumbledore’s back?”
Xenophilius dropped the tray: the bowls bounced and smashed. Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment, the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous
“I was helping Professor Sprout in Greenhouse Three,” he replied. Neville was covered in dirt and there were a few leaves sticking out of his blond hair.  “What are you still doing out?”
He sat down on his couch, a cup of tea clasped in his hands and contemplated how much effort it would take to go shower off the feeling of the dirt left over from the alley when a sharp pecking caught his attention. He turned to the window to see a small grey owl peering at him, a letter clasped in its beak. Letting it in, he fed it some nearby treats as he flipped the letter over, eyes widening slightly at the sender’s name.
Sudden awareness of what she was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Sarah as Harry spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, she felt a violent urge to fling the locket from her. Mastering herself, she shuddered slightly and thrust it back into Harry’s hands.
Everyone went to bed that night full of hot chocolate and cakes, tired from all the excitement but happy that they were with family. Fred crawled into Sarah’s bed behind her and they moved together, seeking out each other’s pleasure before they both crested and relaxed in blissfulness. Sarah had fallen asleep with a smile on her face, feeling as though the family she had lost years ago had finally been reformed.
Draco’s mouth fell open and he gaped at the Headmaster for a few seconds before pulling himself together. He turned to Lyra and hissed, “And you didn’t think to talk to me about this first?”
“Right, all that inbreeding has finally accounted for something other than your unearthly hair,” stated Ron, eliciting a rude gesture from Draco.
“Well we can get something to eat then,” Hermione replied dismissively. “My parents love that I’m having friends over – I never did it before Hogwarts. Also, have you seen my cream shirt?”
Draco looked into the mirror and froze. A familiar pair of emerald eyes were staring back at him from the doorway.
Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faced turned to him.
He threw the heavy-looking brooms down to them and they all jumped on, Hermione sliding on behind Ron. They soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room.
Harry look terrified for a moment before he said, “Er…well, I think Lyra is right, Ron. Even though Kepler is a good Chaser the others are a bit…well…”
“The Death Eater searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Remus went on. “They found the ghoul but didn’t want to get too close – and then they interrogated those who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but nobody knew where you had gone. Sirius and I were already gone by then but Arthur filled me in via Patronus.”
“Draco, Lyra,” he said in a tight voice, “I need you to do something. This man – tell us, is it Potter? We must know…we must be sure…”
“You don’t have to apologise,” Lyra said with a sigh. “I shouldn’t have dismissed the idea so quickly. And besides, it’s not as if you were wrong.”
“They feel angry of course,” said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. “Because they told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe them.”
“I just don’t think it’s what people expect me to do,” he admitted, shrugging. “They will all want me to go into being an Auror and catch the bad guys – “
“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been, places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking baffled. “Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?”
relaxing in the sunlight,” Lyra said with a smirk and Harry had the grace to look embarrassed. “Haven’t really had to opportunity to do so, considering the circumstances.”
“Yeah, everyone knows there’s nothing really that great about him,” Aleksander teased, throwing a thick arm around Viktor’s shoulders. “He’s just a big softie with some talent for riding a broom.”
“Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,” said Harry. “I would have if it had been me…wouldn’t have wanted anyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?”
Harry opened his mouth to reply but stopped when Nearly Headless Nick drifted toward them through the crowd.
Sarah managed to avoid leaving the hospital wing and ripping McLaggen’s head off, but only barely. After she and Madam Pomfrey had fixed Harry’s cracked skull, she let Draco and Hermione in.
“I think I’m going to fall asleep,” Harry muttered, pushing himself up slightly to look Draco in the eye. “Will you stay?”
They had gone out shopping again after lunch, mainly for last-minute things they had forgotten, and Hermione had wanted to get herself an early birthday present. Unfortunately for Ron, she decided her birthday present would be a gigantic, ginger monstrosity of a cat which had nearly scalped Ron when they went into the magical pet shop for some rat tonic for Scabbers.
There was a sudden explosion or choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fishbone. At last he spluttered, “The
Fudge, Snape and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore alone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.
Hermione looked angrily. “Normally, I would agree but with Ron being the way he is right now…” She blinked away tears.
When they went down to the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the centre of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.
“At this rate, we’ll be the only ones left,” Ron told them one night in the library. “Us, and Crabbe and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it’s going to be.”
All she could think of doing was keep talking. Neville’s arm was pressed against hers and she could feel him shaking. She was hoping the others were also thinking of ways to get out of this.
Pettigrew stuttered out a response detailing how Sirius had cornered him on a muggle road and how he had shouted that Sirius had betrayed the Potters while hiding his wand behind his back. He had then cut his own finger off and blasted the road, causing a major explosion which killed all the muggles. Within all the confusion, he had transformed and escaped into the sewers with the rest of the rats.
Excited chitters echoed across the room but neither Lyra nor Draco reacted. Kingsley looked down at the twins, a flash of sympathy crossing his face.
Legilimens, not amateurs,” said Snape silkily. “You would most likely damage Potter’s mind more than it already is.”
“What’s this I hear about you and your paramour engaging in a display of public indecency in the entrance hall?” Blaise trilled from his reclined position next to Theo. “Darling, you should have told me. I would have
“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs Longbottom. “I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?”
“He’s good for you, Draco,” Rosie continued softly. “I’m not going to let you give up something wonderful because of one horrible occasion.”
“You’ll be okay, pup,” Sirius whispered. She leant into his arms, Fred moving back to give her some space.
He stood in shocked silence for a moment as he took in the lights floating above everyone’s heads and the multiple tables heaped with food. Ron caught sight of him and marched over, a face breaking out over his freckly face.
He stared at her in disbelief. “What on earth was so important that I had to endure Charms alone?” he said, disapproval evident in his tone.
“Er – yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of obvious once fourteen of us fly off to Tonks’ parents’ house?”
“What are you all doing here, anyway?” Harry demanded of the group. “Molly didn’t mention anything when I dropped Teddy off yesterday.”
“Wasn’t my calling,” Potter said in a self-deprecating tone. “Turns out I actually like books when they aren’t trying to bite me.”
“So when are you going to ask him out again?” Rosie asked. She sat herself on the desk, barely missing the papers Draco had been filling out. “You
“That’s my point!” snapped Sarah. “This is the wand that tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and tortured me and Hermione. I think I’m allowed to be disgusted by it.”
“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve been telling him to get a move on.”
The pair sunk to the floor as Harry’s voice began to crack from his shouts. Sarah took a deep breath, said, “Sorry, darling,” and then slapped him hard across the face.
Remus hesitated for a split second before saying, “Dumbledore has his reasons, Harry. We need to trust them.”
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch the snowball fight between Sarah, Draco, Harry and the Weasleys rather than participate.
“Cheers,” whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face. “Oh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next…They multiply by ten every time you try…”
“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. “There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?”
“I saw my mother,” she sobbed. “I saw her. We were happy – all of us. She was alive and so was James and Lily. My father wasn’t there. But – but – but then I saw – s-saw V-V-Voldemort – “
“Brilliant,” she drawled sarcastically. “I’m sure you’ll still be saying that after staircase number three.”
Before they could begin fighting again, another owl landed on the table. It hopped in front of Sarah and presented its leg to her.
“I know that you are preparing to fight.” There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.”
“It’s from Sirius!” Harry exclaimed, reading through the letter quickly. “He and Buckbeak are safe. Oh – it was him who sent me the Firebolt…”
The front rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled even lower, coming in to land at tremendous speed – then, with an almighty crash, the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.
“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.
“And here I was thinking that you might be a Seer, Hermione,” Sarah teased, shaking her head. “It would make Divination an absolute
Harry took Hermione’s advice to heart and started initiating conversations with Draco whenever he saw the other man. Which tended to be quite often. Teddy loved visiting the animals and Draco himself always appeared in Harry’s store on his half days.
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit me a lot since Christmas. Mainly with Sarah and Draco, that’s why I’m not talkin’ ter them – but also alone. Bin righ’ upset. Firs’ yeh weren’t talkin’ ter her because o’ the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her cat – “
“Great work of art?” Sarah scoffed. “You usually hang in an unused room, I’d be thanking us that you may have the opportunity for a change of scenery.”
“It doesn’t change the mindset of people,” Draco stated. “But it doesn’t matter. Lyra and I will both work hard and hopefully, someone will act like an adult and give us an opportunity.”
Cho had got to her feet, but Draco said rather fiercely, “No, Luna will take Harry and me, won’t you, Luna?”
They quickly threw on shoes and jumpers and joined the boys outside. Fred immediately grabbed her hand.
Sarah nodded and pushed down the well of emotion that had risen in her chest. She broke away from Draco and hugged herself tightly.
Harry’s eyes softened slightly, as though he could tell where her mind went. He reached across and gripped one of her hands tightly.
“So according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?” Harry said, his voice shaking.
“Did you hear that the Patil twins’ parents want them to go home?” Hermione suddenly said the next morning, looking toward the staff table. “Some students have already been withdrawn.”
“They were one of the earliest families to go extinct in the male line. Their descendants had different names through their mothers,” she explained.
“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in the world…we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain…”
“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, a long time ago,” he said without prompting. “I saw You-Know-Who trying to find it. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it any more: it was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know – but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumour, it can’t have been that difficult.”
,” she continued, cutting off Harry’s next question, “it might be worth checking it out. Who knows? Maybe Cedric gave you a serious hint.”
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. Draco drew in a sharp breath beside Sarah as Snape stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.
Sarah tuned out as Ron interrupted Hermione and continued to go on about the various sweets at Honeydukes. She opened her eyes, however, when Harry said sullenly, “ Suspect it will. You’ll have to tell me when you find out.”
Sarah and Draco glanced at each before telling them what had happened, albeit a slightly edited version.
Well, the exam itself wasn’t, it was fine. Sarah answered all the questions easily thanks to Draco’s meticulous note-taking. It was an hour into the exam where it began to go downhill.
Harry cut him off with a firm kiss. Draco gasped slightly and Harry quickly pushed his tongue forward, moving one hand to grip Draco’s jaw. Draco groaned slightly and grabbed Harry’s waist, pulling him up and over until he was straddling the other boy. Harry deepened the kiss and snaked one hand up into Draco’s silky hair. They began to rock together and soon descended into a mess of shedding clothes and hurried kisses.
“I don’t care if I have to drag you away from him butt-naked,” Draco interrupted. “You’ll bloody well sit down and listen to my problems. Harry has a habit of day-dreaming without realising it and my superb oratory skills are wasted on him.”
At five o’clock, Sarah bid goodbye to Draco, Blaise and Theo and mournfully left the Slytherin table for her detention with Umbitch.
“I offered,” Sarah said at the same time that Fred said, “Bribery”, Draco snorted, “Exploitation”, and Harry grumbled, “Manipulation.”
Hermione gasped, whether at his words or the slap, Sarah didn’t know. Harry was sitting in shock, his face blank as he stared at his best friend.
“You go and tell Ron and Hermione what you need to and then come meet Draco and me in the library,” Sarah demanded, already dragging Draco away in the opposite direction. “And I swear to Merlin, Potter if you get caught…”
The worst thing were the nightmares. Every night, Harry dreamt of the graveyard and the flash of green light which had killed Cedric. He had been hoping to talk to Dumbledore more about what had happened, what
Before they knew it, they were waving goodbye to Fred, George, Sirius, Remus and Mrs Weasley at platform nine and three-quarters as the train chugged away from the station.
“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said Professor McGonagall. “You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.”
Sarah jumped a foot in the air at the sudden shout. Mrs Weasley had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.
“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Sarah had to push her ear very closely against the crack to hear. “I am trying to help you. What is your plan?”
“No idea,” Sarah answered truthfully. “Now if you wouldn’t mind leaving, your presence is affecting my appetite.”
“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?” said Harry. “All last year I kept it on me and – “
“Gillyweed,” the boy repeated, “it’s a water-plant. It’s used for deep water dives. It lets the person breathe underwater for a certain amount of time, depending on the amount ingested – although there are some debates about saltwater versus freshwater – “
Harry didn’t know how much he had drunk but definitely knew his body hated him. Even worse, the Slytherin boys’ room had been locked tight this morning when Harry had tried to go and see if Draco had any Hangover potions on hand. His next stop would have been Hermione if it weren’t for the fact that Ron’s bed was mysteriously empty. That was
She cut herself off and groaned, falling sideways to collapse against Blaise’s shoulder. He patted her gently on the head.
“Okay,” said Draco, “well then, Harry and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak and we’ll sneak into the office and use the Floo. Sarah and Hermione, can you two stand guard at the door?”
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge.
“Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated, I didn’t do it so well, Splinched myself again” – Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly – “and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we’d been…you’d gone.”
But Harry wasn’t the next one up. Fleur suddenly appeared further down the edge, merpeople heaving her up onto the ground. She was shouting in French as she tried to go back into the water.
“Pas de soucis,” Sarah said softly, leaning forward to kiss Fleur’s cheeks twice. Draco copied her actions and whispered something in Fleur’s ear that Sarah couldn’t hear. Fleur smiled at Draco and kissed his cheeks, nodding eagerly.
“He’s with Harry,” Sarah replied, sitting beside Theo and accepting a platter of bacon. “Apparently my stunt yesterday required
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads – “
Classes were amping up. The fifth and seventh years could always be seen in either the library or their common rooms, working frantically through the piles of homework they were being given. On top of that, Umbridge had enacted an Educational Degree disbanding all clubs, something which made Sarah believe that they had been overheard in the Hog’s Head.
“Technically, Ancient Studies isn’t a set N.E.W.T,” Severus said. “You’d be gaining extra credit but it wouldn’t be one of the large exams.”
“Where are we going, Professor?” Sarah asked. Professor Moody didn’t reply and just continued to lead Sarah back toward the school.
“Basically, you have no reason to act like this,” summarised Lyra, tapping her quill feather against her cheek. “And besides, is there actually any problem with George and I dating? It’s not like I’m dating you.”
Harry groaned while the others laughed and the conversation quickly dissolved into light-hearted teasing and horrified renditions of Lockhart, broken only by the arrival of ice-cream.
“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”
Harry stepped up behind him and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, dropping a kiss to one of the many reddening marks on the blonde’s neck.
“I don’t think I want it up here, though,” he finally said. “Why have a constant reminder of my ancestors.”
“What did you do?” Harry asked. Behind him, Professor McGonagall was shouting at Moody and dispersing the crowd.
Sarah immediately returned to her star chart and inputted the remaining constellations. Just as she was checking to ensure everything was correct, there was a loud
“Fuck it,” she muttered. Taking a running start, she leapt at the tree and managed to grab the branch. It was only years of Quidditch training with Draco that gave her the ability to pull herself up.
They wandered over to the Bulgarian tents next. The tents had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows.
Harry pondered the idea for a moment. “Yes,” he said truthfully. “I feel like my life would have been a lot easier if I had run away when my name came out of that Goblet.”
Summer at The Burrow was nothing like anything Sarah or Draco had ever experienced before. For one, the sheer number of people sharing the same space was, admittedly at first, extremely overwhelming. Sarah could barely walk between one room and the next without bumping into someone.
“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. “Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!”
“Don’t do anything I would do,” Sirius said, smirking at the pair as they left the room. Sarah held her middle finger up to him as she slammed the door behind her.
“Let’s get this over with,” he said. They reached Professor McGonagall’s office and Harry wrapped his knuckles hard against the wooden door.
“What the fuck?” Blaise exclaimed, staring down at the sleeping girl currently resting against his shoulder.
Harry made a noncommittal sound and sipped his tea as Draco and Sarah began to bicker about the colour of their Weasley sweaters.
“And now, please greet – the Irish National Quidditch Team!” yelled Bagman. “Presenting – Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaaand –
She spun around and walked toward the exit, the perfect representation of poise and grace despite the churning anger flowing through her bloodstream.
“Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without a password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr Filch restore her.”
Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he turned even more red), then said to Draco, “ And you too – you ‘elped – “
The next hour was spent in a dull blur. Sarah helped Madam Pomfrey to keep her mind off the figures of the dead. Of Lavender, who’s face was ravaged even in death; of Tonks, who was leaving behind a beautiful baby boy. Sarah gripped the edge of Remus’s makeshift hospital bed to stop herself from collapsing.
“Can we do something for you?” Sarah asked with as much dignity possible for someone covering in Stinksap.
Once their footsteps had disappeared into the back, Draco took a deep breath and dialled the number. Potter picked up on the second ring.
“Well, Alchemy and Potions are very useful in Healing,” the mediwitch said. “Lots of research around potion development and diseases involved in those fields.”
Sarah quickly pulled the boys out of the kitchen when the looks between the adults became heated. They trudged up to Draco’s room and collapsed on his bed. Sarah felt Harry’s hand come down to brush through her loose hair.
there’d be a giant snake intent on suffocating me,” grumbled Sarah. “I blame you entirely. I never would have done something so Gryffindor if you hadn’t been in there. You’re a horrible influence.”
Sarah heard the hospital doors burst open. She saw Harry sit up in the bed opposite her, unnoticed by any of the people around his bed.
George leant around him to address Sarah. “He threatened to hex people if they didn’t move,” he divulged.
At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Sarah walked into the History of Magic classroom to find Harry and Professor Lupin already waiting, a large packing case between them on Professor Binns’s desk.
“Thank you, Luna,” he said quietly, his voice rough from the screaming earlier. “Are you warm enough?” he asked the other girl, eyeing the pathetic excuse for a blanket she was given.
“Do you have any recommendations for what I should do if I do pursue that career?” Sarah asked. Harry had taken a seat beside Draco’s bed so Sarah followed Madam Pomfrey into her office so they didn’t disturb the sleeping boy.
Sarah just went up to Professor Snape and asked if Draco could be exempt from the potion-making today. Snape barely lifted his gaze, just giving her a shallow nod before waving her away.
The pair took a few more steps forward before Sarah and the nurse was upon them, levitating Draco to a bed and cutting open his tattered shirt.
“Sarah!” she said in relief as soon as Sarah closed the door behind her. “How’s Harry? I couldn’t stay down there, no one was listening to reason. There’s no way he entered!”
“Yes, we do!” she snapped in reply. “We will not go racing headfirst into this without making sure that it’s real!”
would’ve come down hard on him is by finally succumbing to the weight of his ego and falling down the stairs,” Sarah muttered harshly, loud enough that the surrounding students could hear her, causing them to quickly smother their laughter or scoffs. Sarah swore she saw Professor McGonagall’s lip twitch upward slightly.
Sarah, Pansy, Theo and Draco all got to their feet and pushed through the oak double doors. Once they were safely on their way to Charms, Theo let out a great sigh.
“I’m surrounded by children,” Hermione said with a sigh, looking down at them all as they struggled for breath around laughter and wrestled in an effort to get upright.
“Did you get much of a holiday, Viktor, after the World Cup?” Theo asked, surprisingly calm for someone who was meeting his favourite Quidditch player.
“I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. “I just don’t like the way they move…”
“That’s the girl that Ron drooled over last night,” Harry revealed, clapping loudly with the rest of them.
“That Ravenclaw bloke in your year?” George asked. Sarah nodded in agreement. “I didn’t know he swung that way.”
Phineas Nigellus went quiet and then groaned, “You’re that Slytherin girl, aren’t you? The friend of Mr Potter’s? Deaumont, if I’m right?”
“I didn’t mean it like that,” he said, confused hurt painting his face. “I know you guys are really smart...”
Gilderoy Lockhart slowly came into view and Sarah wished he hadn’t. He had wavy blonde hair that seemed stuck in the same position by excessive potion usage, the image only exaggerated by the wizard's hat sat precariously at an angle on top of his head. He was in forget-me-not blue robes that matched his eyes and he was beaming and winking at the crowd. The worst thing about the entire event was the multitude of posters of his face that smiled at everyone from all angles. Everywhere she turned, she couldn’t escape the blinding white small of one Gilderoy Lockhart.
“Well, yes,” said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. “Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the
mimicked the woman to the left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet from Sarah and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Sarah’s eyes.
the Cloak, what about the Resurrection Stone?” Hermione’s fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!”
“You were lying unconscious in a hospital bed after nearly bleeding to death,” she hissed in reply. “I did what I had to.”
“Miss Deaumont!” Professor Umbridge interrupted with a sharp smile. “Whilst I admire the research you have done into this topic, I’m afraid it was unnecessary. You see, the Ministry has approved certain texts and that is not one of them.”
“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re about to perform,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split-second advantage.”
“’Important stories he thinks the public needs to know’?” she said witheringly. “I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag?”
Fred huffed and threw another hex, earning an “Oi!” from Lee as the dark-skinned boy dived out of the way.
Sarah raised an eyebrow. “If it makes you feel any better, we didn’t do anything,” she said, calmly cutting into her bacon. “Unlike
. Sarah cringed. Defensive Magical Theory sounded extremely boring. She just hoped that whoever Dumbledore had found as their Defense teacher was adequate.
Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Sarah put down her wand and said, “I still think he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.”
“No worries, Arthur,” Sirius replied, resting his elbow on Harry’s shoulder. “Sarah enjoys tormenting my mother, it’s very refreshing.”
Lucius was currently away for work which meant that Draco was free to explore muggle London with them without worrying about his father’s reaction.
“Last I saw, he had his hands up Parvati’s shirt so I’d wait a while before looking for him,” Blaise said calmly as if he hadn’t just dropped a bombshell on them.
“We’ve been up for nearly an hour,” Hermione said, throwing presents at the boys. “I’ve been adding more lacewings to the potion while Sarah adamantly ignored its existence. It’s ready.”
“Drink this, dear,” she said, shoving a purple potion into Draco’s hands. “It’ll help with the residual scarring.”
“Rosie dragged me to a club down there,” Draco was saying, pointing across Harry’s chest at the alley they had just passed. “It was completely horrendous. The drinks were expensive and tasted like shit and the music was so horrid that I had a headache for days afterward.”
Nonverbal spells were now expected not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts but also in Charms and Transfiguration, too. Their workload was also increasing substantially. Already, Sarah was beginning to feel the strain of her extra courses. Not only was she doing more subjects than even Draco and Hermione, she was also working on her Healer apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey and working on her Alchemy research. It turned out that Snape had gotten permission for her and Draco to do the course separately during one of the free periods, only a single Ravenclaw joined them. By the end of the first week, Draco pulled her away from her massive pile of books and notes and looked her sternly in the eye.
Draco sat glumly back down and scowled at the back of Crabbe’s head. Meanwhile, Fred passed the Quaffle to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had obviously not been expecting it, but caught it by the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.
Snape nodded and Sarah stood up, glad that her legs didn’t wobble. Before she left, Snape rested a hand on her shoulder.
“Oh, by the way, Lyra, Draco,” Blaise said suddenly. “Millie and Theo wish to speak to you both about this. We’ll be meeting in our dorm after dinner.”
Unable to stand the bickering, Sarah slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. She headed downstairs toward the kitchen and made herself a cup of tea. Just as she hopped up on the table and took her first sip, she heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.
Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary at first glance but Sarah knew it wasn’t. Harry watched in confusion as Sarah, Draco and Ron all pushed away from the table in fear.
Nothing could have prepared her for the pain of that spell. It felt as if ten-thousand knives were piercing her skin while acid flowed through her body. Every bone felt as if it were being repeatedly broken and repaired, only to be broken again. She writhed in pain, screams tearing through her throat without her control. Tears flowed down her face as she curled into a ball, trying to hide from her father, from Voldemort, from the pain that was ripping her nerves and muscles apart.
Sarah pushed a potion vial into Draco’s and the girl’s hands and told them to drink. Fleur led her sister away, muttering lowly in French as Sarah wrapped a towel around Draco’s shaking shoulders.
Sarah nodded along with his words, already knowing this. “Any particular subjects I need?” she asked.
“Son of a bitch…” she muttered. She looked at the stairs and contemplated how much effort it would take to drag herself to her feet and walk down
They walked off, leaving behind the dumbstruck faces of Harry and Draco, the gossiping forms of Lavender and Parvati, and Ron with his strangely blank expression.
Lupin gave a resigned sigh but nodded his head. Harry turned away and began to pace quickly as he thought of a memory.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too.
“They think Sirius Black helped them escape,” Theo whispered, reading the article over Pansy’s shoulder. “Do you think that’s true?”
“I’ll get you for that one!” Harry shouted again and Sarah merely flipped upside down and stuck her tongue out at him.
“Because you have a homicidal maniac currently living in your Manor?” Pansy answered flippantly, not looking up from where she was painstakingly painting Lyra’s nails black.
“Sarah, stop!” Harry said, pushing her arms down as she tried to communicate with Seamus from across the street. “Don’t worry about it, mate!” Harry called to Seamus, who shrugged and walked away.
“Harry? Harry, what’s going on?” Sarah fired questions off questions as Harry raced around the boy’s dorm.
“It’s the perfect first step,” Lyra countered. “Have you thought of the possibility of asking him out? He’s obviously interested.”
But then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice said, “Gilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?”
“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champions must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,” said Dumbledore. “Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.
Sarah nodded. “I didn’t think I’d have to do one until my Traineeship,” she admitted, rolling up her sleeves.
“Go ahead,” she said weakly. She scanned through the article and saw that Rita had included everything she and Harry had said, nearly word for word.
Harry beamed at him in response and gripped his arm tightly a moment before they were sucked into the dizzying whirlwind of Apparation, appearing seconds later in Harry’s cozy living room.
Harry had wanted to stay at the Ministry until everything was finalised, but Kingsley had sent them all home, stating that it would take a while for the Malfoys to be ready to leave.
Applause broke out as they separated, with Sarah immediately grabbing Draco in a tight embrace as Fred was clapped on the back and hugged by his brothers. The chairs cleared away for a dance floor and the everyone began spreading out.
All five of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, open-mouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man’s head.
“It seems like just yesterday that you were a blushing mess over realising you liked him,” Draco laughed, leaning back slightly so that they could look at each other.
“Now, Draco,” Narcissa continued. “Your father is away for the week, so I don’t see why you cannot stay with Sarah tonight and accompany the Weasleys to the station tomorrow.”
Sarah shook her head. “Not tonight, hun. My head’s not feeling the best.” She turned to him and smiled at his excited expression. “But that was an improvement! We know now how to clear your mind.”
They had made good progress. They had managed to finish the visible wing of the first floor, with Sirius locking the door leading to the other wing and claiming that he would do it later that year. A few of the bedrooms were now habitable, meaning that when the Weasley’s moved in at the end of the week, they wouldn’t be strangled in their sleep by a rouge set of cursed bedsheets.
“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who was gazing down at his brother’s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. “Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be a – a real - ?”
“Harry, come on!” shrieked Hermione from somewhere. Harry was still struggling with Dobby, who was trying to do himself serious injury.
Sarah felt a chill in her stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. She knew all about a dementor’s fatal Kiss and realised why the Professors were so angry: the key witness was gone – nothing about tonight could be proved except for Harry or Sarah’s testimonies.
“What do you mean?” Sarah said, sitting up slightly. On the floor at Remus’ feet, Sirius stirred and blinked up at them.
“We’ll go to Hogsmeade,” Sarah said, “and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Everyone under the Cloak.”
“Honestly, I don’t care,” Draco said, looking slightly green. “Can we move? I feel as if I’m about to be sick.”
“They’ll need the Hospital Wing!” Fudge was saying loudly. “The boy is obviously ill – You-Know-Who, returned? Preposterous!”
Harry led Sarah to an alley between two shops and stood awkwardly in front of her. She leant against the wall and crossed her arms, looking at the sheepish, pacing boy.
,” he hissed quietly. He took a step back, releasing Lyra. “I will come find you in your common room tomorrow.”
“Maybe,” agreed Hagrid. “An’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an’ all. Gotta walk past ‘em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. ‘S like bein’ back in Azkaban – “
Mrs Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.”
Lyra jumped slightly and turned to see Luna standing next to her, wearing a very pretty white and holding a steaming drink.
“Of course not,” Blaise scoffed. “But one can only deal with Theodore and Pansy for so long without help.”
“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!”
In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Sarah wondered what Luna could be doing.
“Don’t be like that,” Sarah said, sitting up and placing a hand on his chest. “We’ll be together the entire year.”
They found Harry and Ron staring at each other; the former annoyed and hurt, and the latter disbelieving and angry. They looked up as the girls entered.
The five of them quickly made their way across the field, trying to avoid the trail of slugs Ron was leaving.
“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge on to the tracks, which Sarah knew, now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposters in Gringotts, they have set off defences against us!”
The boys looked up at Luna’s voice. They looked relieved to see Sarah and Hermione up and walking. Draco stepped up beside Sarah and put an arm around her and she gratefully leaned into him; Ron did the same to Hermione.
“I don’t want to lead this alone,” Harry said quickly. “I’ll help teach you but I’m not running this by myself.” He turned to Draco with a hopeful expression. “Help me? Please?” he said, looking up at Draco with his big, round, green eyes.
applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise in the present climate.”
“Hmm, sure,” said Sarah. “Hermione, I’m going to be blunt here. I know you and you looked about ready to hex Lavender when she smiled at Ron.”
Sarah rolled her eyes and said, “Stay still, darling.” She pointed her wand at his face and began to slowly transfigure his features until he looked nearly identical to Lucius. “There, you look terrifying.”
“We all know it’s the truth,” she said, leaning further back against Theo’s chest from where she was sitting between his legs. He was resting against the headboard of his bed, arms wrapped around Lyra’s waist.
Sarah rested her head against the wall and stared out toward the slowly rippling water, a thousand thoughts flitting through her head. She couldn’t wait to see what her Animagus form was; maybe then she would be able to fly somewhere far away or run where there were no problems to batter her down. She closed her eyes and hoped for some silence to the storm within her mind.
“Hello, Peeves,” he said pleasantly. “I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you. Mr Filch won’t be able to get into his brooms.”
“He’s barely four months old, Potter, he’ll hardly remember us,” Lyra said, secretly smiling to herself.
Sarah nodded in agreement, not brave enough to open her mouth lest her lunch decided to make a reappearance.
Sarah could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when the three of them arrived. Harry and Draco soon disappeared to a quiet corner while Sarah walked around, laughing with people distractedly as she looked for Hermione or Ron. As she was ducking toward the drinks table, she walked straight into Ginny, who had Arnold, her Pygmy Puff, riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.
Sarah faltered too, the exhaustion finally catching up to her as adrenaline flowed out of her body. Fred caught her and directed her to a free bed as Madam Pomfrey swooped down upon her.
Harry sulked for another minute before admitting defeat, grabbing a spare sheet of parchment and quill from Draco.
“It destroyed her, what they did: they were never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it: it turned inwards and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet, and scared, and harmless. And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aberforth, “and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in St Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it in any longer.
Draco finally nodded and put the book down. “How much time do we have before we need to meet your parents?”
“Foul!” echoed Bagman’s magically magnified voice. “Dimitrov skins Moran – deliberately flying to collide there – and it’s got to be another penalty – yes, there’s the whistle!”
“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.”
“Harry, I think the reason you’re so angry about this is because he never told you himself,” Hermione said.
“You’re sitting with him,” Lyra declared, pulling Draco into the room. “I didn’t put so much effort into your appearance just for you to waste it.”
Sarah’s reply was interrupted by the doorbell ringing. The girls exchanged bright smiles before grabbing the last of their things and running downstairs. Mrs Granger had opened the door to reveal Narcissa and Draco, dressed impeccably in the clothes that Sarah had sent to him the day before so he wouldn’t wear robes.
“Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.”
Sarah sighed in frustration and focused on the feeling of her magic, visualising it spreading through her and out of her wand. For added benefit, she also pictured the Stinging Hex hitting Pansy squarely on the head.
“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake…”
“G’night, Draco,” mumbled Harry, pressing a kiss to Draco’s shoulder as he snuggled as close to the blond as he could get.
Sarah and Draco said goodbye to the others and took their seats at the Slytherin table, greeting Blaise, Pansy, Millicent and Theo.
“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We’ve got Aurors and all those extra protective spells, and we’ve got Dumbledore!”
Sarah nearly wept with relief as Draco appeared above them. He was on a broom and had three others in his arms.
“I’ll start writing up a plan,” she said. Then she yawned widely. “Tomorrow,” she added, rubbing her eyes. “After I get a decent night’s sleep.”
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was nobody there.
“Yes, Theo, the beast has been soothed,” Draco said back loudly. Sarah smacked him across the arm and he shied away from her, pouting slightly in mock-pain. “Harry, look how she treats me. Will you kiss it better?”
Sarah had made the effort to smack Ron around the back of the head as she passed him, causing Seamus, Neville and Dean to break out into fits of laughter.
“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.
“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black, nudging Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to make sure.”
Sarah pouted and opened her mouth for a snarky retort but was cut off when a great cloud of frizzy, brown hair obscured her vision.
Sarah didn’t know what to do with herself. She had already finished all the preparatory Healer examinations in May and had already been accepted into an advanced program with St Mungos for an August start. Hermione and Draco had decided to pursue careers in Magical Law while Ron and Seamus applied for the Aurors program. Surprisingly enough, Blaise was joining Sarah at St Mungos. She still couldn’t get the dumbstruck look on Draco’s face out of her head when Blaise had told them. Pansy would be terrifying the world doing whatever she pleased while Millicent tried to keep her contained. Theo was doing a Potions Mastery under Slughorn and Harry was kicking back and relaxing for however long he wanted.
Sarah tugged on his arm to get him moving again, the sooner they were in his common room, the better.
“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. Sarah gasped quietly behind him. “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him – he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it…”
Sirius huffed but said nothing, instead, quickly moving toward Harry’s bed and resting his hand on his godson’s shoulder.
“That’s a wonderful idea,” Luna said brightly. “I also think you should get him to clear his Wrackspurts. Daddy says they always make you say things you might not mean.”
“Define ‘good’, darling,” she said with a sweet smile. “And I’ll have you know that I didn’t go to all that trouble of getting drinks just for my boys to miss it. You’ll be there – you’ll have fun and then you can go fuck like rabbits for the rest of the night if it pleases you.”
“Write to me as soon as Ron replies,” Hermione demanded, squeezing Sarah and then Draco in tight hugs.
“A change of scene might be beneficial, I think,” she said, sliding off the ledge and pulling Harry with her. “Can I use your book to let Draco know? Mine’s in my trunk.”
Sarah nodded. “We’ll meet you guys in the Three Broomsticks in a bit,” she said to the others as they left the quill shop.
“Yes,” said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. “Yes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf…”
“As intriguing as that conversation will undoubtedly be,” drawled Snape’s low voice from above them. Sarah leant back to see Snape standing beside the Gryffindor table, peering down at them. “Miss Deaumont, I have had several people sign up for Quidditch trials. I expect you to organise them for this weekend.” He handed her a long slip of parchment.
They sat in comfortable silence for a while, watching Buckbeak excitedly throw rat corpses into the air before catching them in his beak. Harry suddenly sighed.
