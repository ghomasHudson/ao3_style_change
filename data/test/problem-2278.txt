"Don't be daft, Harry. You can't go on a rescue mission with an empty stomach." she said, making Harry smile.
"I always am. Now, finish your pasta." she commanded and Draco found himself obeying.
"I need to get him out of there, I need to bring him with me." Harry said.
(Next night after their first lesson with Umbridge.)
"What?"
“Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?” Theodore Nott had slid out from behind the door, followed by Parkinson, Bullstrode, Crabbe and Goyle. Looked like Crabbe and Goyle had found themselves a new leader..
"What about you? How did you do?"
"I do, in fact, have a plan. Stop meddling in my business! The Dark Lord gave me this task not you!" yelled Nott.
Ron smiled.
Harry's heart sank.
"I'm sorry, Blaise, but I can't tell you."
"What the hell is wrong with you?"
Harry's eyes widened.
"I.. I obliviated them.."
He could feel Malfoy's eyes tearing into his skull, from the other end of the hall. But, he didn't look up. He didn't know how to face his arch-nemesis after the stunt he'd pulled. Who in their right mind decides to kiss their arch-nemesis?
"Be quiet, you foolish boy--"
"Yeah, Hermione did.." Harry replied, his thoughts still lost in the discussion he'd had with Ron and Hermione about teaching them DADA. First, Draco, now them..
"Happy Christmas, Harry." he replied and nervously put his hand over Harry's.
Then, Harry told him everything that had happened on the day Arthur was attacked and what Dumbledore thought of his connection with Voldemort.
"Stupefy." Draco said and stunned Pansy.
"So.. You told Granger..?"
"Well, are we going to get him?"
"My father and I have a bet, you see" Harry heard Malfoy drawling as he jumped down from the tree.
"Hey, you look happy.." Harry replied, raising his eyebrows.
"See you." he said without turning around and left.
"Why don't you tell me the properties of moonstone, then?" Harry replied, rolling his eyes.
"I suppose you're right. You could teach them? I mean I do help you, don't I?"
Draco's eyes burned. He would not cry. Not in front of Severus. Not while having this conversation.
"What is it?" Hermione asked, coming closer to peek inside the curtains.
"Dra-" but Draco had grabbed his hand and now was staring at it in horror.
"Just let me know if you're in trouble."
"It'll be okay, Draco.. I promise." he said, squeezing Draco's hand.
"Ouch!" Draco had shrieked.
"Draco, that's.. I can't just sit there without any news from you! I have to know you're safe!"
Harry's answering glare shut him up.
"Where?"
"Harry Potter."
"I don't hate you. This is my dorm and common room, too.. I'm allowed to bring my boyfriend here." Harry replied.
Harry took the answering hoot as a
"Should I not be?"
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry glanced at his potion. It turned out to be good enough despite him not paying much attention to it. He had Draco to thank for that. When Snape came to inspect his potion, his frown deepened.
"Don't call him that."
"Hullo, Harry." Hermione replied and smiled at him.
"Take him to your room, Harry, he looks like he could use some rest." Molly said when they arrived at the Burrow.
"I know." he said, through clenched teeth.
"I'm happy for you, Harry." she said.
"WHAT?" Ron yelled.
Dumbledore nodded.
Draco giggled.
"Flobberworms." Harry replied.
Malfoy flushed and looked away. He started talking to Pansy but Harry kept staring.
"Fine. But, this conversation is not over."
"Well, what do you have that cloak for? Put it over us."
"PANSY!"
A sob escaped his throat as his eyes stung with tears.
Draco was pursing his lips.
"Slughorn?"
"He said it was meant for Dumbledore."
"Harry, relax! Pacing around and not eating won't bring his reply early! Now, eat.. I'm not leaving till you eat." she said, sounding like her mother.
She looked up from her books
"He's never here, you say? And for how long has this been going on?" Hermione asked, trying to put two and two together.
"Er.. failed History and Divination, A in Astronomy, O in DADA and E in the rest."
There was silence.
He glances at Ron from the corner of his eyes. He's looking towards the floor. He's listening. Harry really doesn’t want to have this conversation, right now.
"I did have a great personal tutor. I think you helped me more than that little group of yours.. And I was good, anyway." he replied, haughtily.
"Back to Potter, now, am I?"
"Potter, I.. Can I talk to you in private?"
Harry chuckled.
Soon, it became hard to breath and they had to break the kiss.
"There is no bloody girl, Blaise! Sod off!" he replied.
"I'm not really hungry.. See you later, Herms." Cormac said and left after kissing Hermione's cheek.
Snape had surprisingly gotten fed up from Draco's recent potion mishaps and paired them for that day's potion.
Draco rolled his eyes and swished his wand.
"Where were you?"
"I.. I would want to.. I don't know if I can."
"What rumours?"
"Uh well.. you know how she's crying about Cedric and we just had an argument about that and.. and she was mad I was meeting you on the day of our date and well.."
"Harry, I'm here!" Draco appeared beside him and Harry hugged him fiercely.
a small voice in his head told him.
"Hi."
"I'll come with you." Draco replied and Harry grinned.
Wait, when did be become Draco?
"I'm not saying you'll tell them deliberately. I'm just.. Well, Snape told me about Legilimency and what if someone tries to read your mind, Draco?" Harry replied.
Draco was late like always. But this time it was because it was his first night of patrolling as a prefect. He might be breaking a lot of rules by meeting Harry, here, but he was serious about his prefect duties.
Harry glared at him.
Now, everyone knew Draco was the person he'd miss most.
"Draco, please just-"
"I presume you're with Potter, now?"
"You stink, Potter." said Draco, scrunching up his nose.
"I could ask you the same. In fact, I just did. Where are you going at midnight, Draco?"
"Don't be."
"Iwantedtoaskifyouwouldliketogototheyuleballwithme."
She plopped down on the couch in front of him.
"She would never leave father. Let's go before she comes looking for me."
Draco smiled. It was perfect.
Harry rolled his eyes and finally looked at Malfoy.
"I.. um.."
"Suppose so." Harry shrugged, not wanting to talk about it.
"Draco-"
"I.. I MEANT LITERALLY SLEEPING! JUST SLEEPING." Harry yelled at the compartment door. "Though, I wouldn't mind if there was more than sleeping." he mumbled to himself.
"You have no idea how much better I feel." he said, putting his forehead against Draco's.
"Huh?"
Harry denied it but he had hesitated for a few seconds which made Draco suspicious.
"It's Valentine's day, tomorrow." Harry said.
"I can't, Harry."
"Right, er.. See you after the Holidays, then."
"Hm?"
"I.. I'll learn Occlumency, then! I'll ask Severus to teach me! I won't tell your secrets to anyone, Harry."
"Of course.. What about dinner?"
Harry turned to face him.
"I just had a row with the Minister.."
"T'was fine. I made them practice expelliarmus, today.. It went better that I expected. We're calling it Dumbledore's army.. Oh and I think you're right about Cho fancying me, by the way." replied Harry.
Scrimgeour nodded.
Harry smiled at him. He looked beautiful on the broomstick, looking absolutely ethereal with the sun shining on his platinum blond hair.. Harry was so distracted by his boyfriend's beauty, he didn't even realise when Draco had dived for the snitch. Eyes widening, Harry followed him but the snitch had disappeared.
"Shut up, Potty, Helena is dying."
"Oh fine."
Blaise rolled his eyes and went back to his food.
He was now imagining life with Harry in Slytherin. Harry being his best friend and later, his boyfriend.. Them cuddling in the common room, them sharing a dorm, them not having to meet like this..
"Well.. Then, you leave me no choice." Draco said.
"Huh, what?" Harry replied, bursting out of his thoughts at Hermione's yelling.
“I’ll do anything,” Draco says, his hot breath brushing against Harry’s ear before he gently bites the lobe causing him to shudder from pleasure. “Just tell me what you want me to do.” Harry’s hips jerk up unbidden, seeking out more of that delicious friction he craves.
“Come on then, can’t have you catching a cold on me. Granger would have my head.” Draco loops an arm around one of Harry’s and tugs him away from the wall. “And then all of that work to convince her I’m not still a...” Draco pauses to recall. “What was it she called me?”
Before Harry can think too hard about it he’s closing the distance between them. The hand in his hair tightens slightly, sending tingles like electricity through his body, and finally he is kissing the mysterious man. It’s a gentle kiss filled with hesitance and absolute care. Almost as if the boy is scared he might break or run away. It’s a little awkward given Harry’s lack of sight but it still manages to steal his breath away.
His thoughts are interrupted by the boy– no Malfoy’s tongue reciprocating the timid exploration. And suddenly, Harry has the overwhelming urge to protect him, to hold him close and make him his.
Draco's legs immediately start to cramp up from the awkward position, but he stubbornly refuses to touch more of Potter's body than is absolutely necessary. He settles his hands on either side of Potter's crossed legs, studiously avoiding his gaze. Someone who sounds suspiciously like Finnigan wolf-whistles at them, causing another round of giggles to pass around the circle.
"Ah, Parvati, love, fancy anyone in the room then?" Draco asks, kicking himself for not being more creative. The part of his head screaming at him to follow Potter makes it a tad bit harder to concentrate on a game he already couldn't give two shits about.
In, out.
Harry grabs his wrist and hold his arm up between them. “This doesn’t define you. It’s a part of your past just as much as my scar from Voldemort. Both proof of how we were forced into a predetermined path set out for us in which we had no say or choice.” Harry places a hand on Draco’s chest, his breath catching as his fingers run along the sectum sempra scars he knows are still there after catching a glimpse of them in the Quidditch locker rooms. “We both made mistakes. Everyone did. We were children caught up in a mess so much bigger than us. In a war.”
“Yes?” Comes Draco’s response, guarded but cautiously hopeful.
No such luck. Blaise is in bed with his back turned to Draco, but they've been rooming long enough for him to know when the prat is faking it.
"Alright, alright, I'm lucky that you really like me," He says with another soft laugh to which Harry nods in approval. "Apparently."
," Potter says grimly, the bottle already spinning in front of him as he seems desperate to shift everyone's attention away from himself.
Draco thinks, not caring how petty, childish, if not downright ridiculous it sounds. Rounding up any remaining brain cells he has left, he refocuses his energy on Potter's neck. He alternates between biting, licking, and sucking until he's positive it's going to leave a mark that'll last at
He reminds himself firmly.
Seamus groans heartily. "
Draco's brain is effectively reduced to mush, leaving him floundering for something remotely intelligent to say.
Harry brushes a hair out of Draco’s face and tilts his head back up so he can look him in the eyes. “But it’ll be worth every second I get to call you mine and I yours, right?” He says, gently bringing their mouths back together in a tender kiss. Harry can feel Draco smile and finds himself mirroring it, pulling back and taking in the beautiful boy in front of him. He can’t recall a time he’s ever seen him with such a wide genuine smile gracing his features. It makes him look younger almost, softening the usually harsh edges of his face.
. It's one thing, Draco thinks, knowing this is affecting Harry as much as it's affecting him. But it's another thing entirely
that I didn't see this coming!" He defends himself quickly.
“It wouldn’t make you much of a gentleman to shag me on the first date?” Harry finishes for him with a crooked grin.
“Arse,” Harry grumbles, flicking him on the cheek.
day tomorrow?"
He finds a strange amount of comfort in the expansion and deflation of Harry's lungs beneath his fingers; in the feeling of Harry's body against his: solid, warm, real,
can he not see it?
They both smile.
“Hey, don’t worry, I’m not going to do anything you’re not comfortable with. I’m not that much of an arse,” The boy says, tone implying a self-deprecating smile has made its way onto his face.
"I'm going to bed now," Draco says flatly, tugging the covers over his head and rolling to face towards the wall.
Ghosting his hand along the door and feeling the strange but familiar pattern, his hand finds its way to the handle, twisting it and tugging gently. The door swings open to reveal what looked empty at first glance but as he bends down to get a closer look he sees something inside.
The boy seems to hesitate a moment longer before threading a hand through Harry’s hair. Harry’s eyes flutter closed as long elegant fingers start running through his hair. It’s such a simple gesture but something about how gentle he is has Harry’s stomach doing somersaults. He nearly misses the boy say a quiet “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.” with a light laugh before the hand in his hair guides their mouths closer together until they’re mere centimetres apart.
Harry laughs as he makes his way back to the vague circle the others are sitting in, Draco close behind. They find a space on one of the squishy couches and sit down, thighs and arms touching. And as he is sucked back into the ridiculous game of Truth or Dare (After the hat had chosen its next victims, Blaise and Ginny) Harry finds himself threading his hand through Draco’s, giving his hand a light squeeze which he returns.
"Perhaps," Draco says.
doesn't like the way Pansy is currently looking at him, Blaise's conspiratorial glee mirrored in her eyes.
both having something to prove
There’s a moment of silence as Draco’s eyebrows shoot up, his expression that of a deer-in-headlights. “Well, yes, it would seem that way.”
“You’ll hate how messy I am.”
"Do you want to talk about it?" Harry asks, holding him closer in response.
"You sure, mate? We only just started," Weasley asks, confusion mixing with mild concern.
Following Draco's terrified gaze, Harry seems to realize his mistake and places his wand on the bed, holding his empty hands up in a peaceful gesture. His lips move and Draco thinks he's trying to ask something but he can't make it out through the muddled ringing. Harry seems to ask something else, though this time he adds hand motions; first indicating his own slow breaths and then gesturing towards Draco. Harry continues to take long exaggerated breaths and, finally understanding, Draco tries to match them with his own.
Harry’s brain short circuits.
despite what houses suggest
Now green means belonging.
He doesn't even try to stop the hand that dips below his waistband, merely using the other to grab his wand and throw up some half-assed privacy charms. He places his wand back on his nightstand then absently feels along his throat, flushing as he recalls the mouth that had been there not too long ago.
“This is all just some kind of cruel joke to humiliate me, is that it?”
Potter looks alarmed. "You know, I was under the impression dares were supposed to embarrass the person
When they eventually draw apart, after what feels like hours but could’ve been mere minutes, they both stay in place. Draco rests their foreheads together as they both attempt to even out their breathing. His thumbs gently trace along Harry’s jaw and cheeks and eventually drag at his lower lip.
you offer a hand
Say, two?" Harry asks redundantly, a giddy smile breaking through his serious façade.
Now that he knows exactly who he’s with, he doesn’t even hesitate before pulling him fully onto his lap so that Malfoy’s legs are on either side of his hips. They break apart momentarily to settle into a more comfortable position then Malfoy is kissing him again like his life depends on it. Harry can’t help the groan that escapes his lips, lifting a hand up to grasp a handful of platinum blond hair.
Draco's never been one to want to simply kiss somebody for hours, but he's beginning to come to terms with the fact that Harry has been, and will always be, the one exception to most things in his life.
Harry reaches a hand out to run it through his hair, pushing the platinum blond locks back and out of his face. "If you're sure." Harry says with an odd little smile that looks much too endearing for Draco's liking.
"I dare you to..." Pansy takes an excessive amount of time to mull over her options, roving gaze considering each person around the circle. When her eyes land on Potter, she pauses, contemplative pout morphing into an evil grin. "...give our lovely Savior here a love bite!" She finishes sweetly.
“Looks like Winky left some tea for us under a warming charm,” Draco utters past a yawn.
Moving away slightly, Harry turns around and looks at Malfoy, waiting to see what he is going to say.
Before she could say anything about him walking in with Malfoy for yet another morning, Harry cuts her off by quickly blurting out, “I don’t want to be an Auror.”
“Thanks again for letting me stay here with you,” Hermione says as she lifts Crookshanks’ cage while Harry unlocks the door and drags their trunks through.
Surging forward the few steps, Harry closes the distance between the two of them. With a handful of Malfoy’s hair, he crashes their lips together. Unsure which one of them moans at the contact, Harry deepens the kiss.
Harry finishes cleaning up and gets the tea kettle going as the kitchen fire flares green and Malfoy steps through once again.
Opening her mouth a few times, Hermione finally replies, “okay, what do you want to do then?”
“If your back is hurting that bad, you don’t have to sleep down here.”
Harry shrugs a shoulder and replies, “if I can’t sleep, at least I can be productive.”
Harry had never admitted that to anyone. It felt really good to say it out loud. Malfoy clearing his throat brings Harry out of his musings. Looking towards the other boy, he realizes Malfoy must have said something a few times before he finally caught Harry’s attention. An embarrassed blush tints Harry’s cheeks as he mumbles an apology.
“What made you change your mind?” Harry asked as he brought the tea to the table.
“Harry you were spending too much energy on trying to be what everyone else wanted. I didn’t know for sure until you just confirmed it, but I have suspected for a while now.”
Malfoy never mentions anything about it. While awake he always seems to stay as far from Harry as possible but their bodies gravitate towards each other in their sleep
“Yea that sounds lovely,” Hermoine says as she follows him.
This time, Hermione’s eyes bug out of her head a little bit. Harry sees her struggle to pull herself back together. After a few moments she manages to calmly state, “Harry you’ve said you wanted to be an Auror since fifth year, what changed?”
After putting in the 3 Ninjas, Harry grabs some blankets and starts a fire, “we may as well get comfortable if we’re going to be watching movies all night,” he tells Malfoy as he hands him one of the blankets.
“You know I could have hexed you at any point in the last four hours right?”
They quickly finish stowing away the rest of the pillows and set their tea things to the side and soon they are heading towards the Great Hall. They go their separate ways at the entryway. Noticing Hermione sitting at the end of the Gryffindor table by herself, Harry hurries over to her.
Kreacher stocked the kitchen in anticipation of Harry returning to the house. They found a common ground the summer after the war. Harry didn’t ask much of him, but Kreacher kept the house as best he could and made sure the kitchen was always full.
Looking close to tears, Hermione finally comes out with what truly seems to bother her about the situation, “Harry, I just wish you felt like you could talk to me about it all. We experienced most of it together, didn’t we?”
After almost a month of watching movies with Malfoy most nights and falling asleep on the couch, Harry’s body is protesting the horrible sleeping conditions. And it is obvious that Hermione is tired of hearing Harry complain.
“Of course I don’t, this is my house,” Harry quips with a lopsided grin, “I get to sleep where I want.” He tries to use humor to stop himself from admitting he sleeps better down here, uncomfortable couch or no.
The next few weeks are a blur of studying for the NEWTs and late night meetings in the Astronomy Tower. During all of this, Harry struggles to get Hermione’s warning out of his mind. He pays attention to the fact that he and Malfoy start sleeping in the tower more often than not. So much so that they have started stashing blankets and pillows in an alcove. He notices that he has had some of the best sleep in his life on the uncomfortable ground, a few feet away from someone who used to be an enemy.
Thinking back to when they met on the train their first year, Harry extends his hand to Malfoy. “You aren’t the kid whose friendship I rejected in first year because you were a prejudiced bully. So, can we try being friends now that we are both different from the boys who first met?”
“If you want to watch a scary movie, that’s a good choice. I haven’t seen it for a long time.”
of duets alone
He wracks his brain for something to do to help reassure him, but right as an idea starts to formulate he ends up knocking into someone walking in the opposite direction. He stutters out an apology but the man just gives him then Draco a dirty look before spitting "Oi, watch it! Fuckin' fairies."
"I don't even want to think about how oily my hair is going to be after this." Draco grumbles.
Now green means warmth.
If you had told Harry that he would run into Draco sodding Malfoy after work, he would’ve shrugged it off, seeing as it’s not an entirely uncommon occurrence. With them both working at the ministry it’s damn near impossible to not run into each other or make awkward eye contact every now and then. Especially when Harry’s brain seems set on actively seeking out those stupid pretty grey eyes and those stupid pretty platinum blond locks. (Old habits die hard, Harry guesses)
Harry, in turn, leans further onto Draco, resting his head on his shoulder and wrapping his arms around his waist. "No. Fuck you. You're warm and stable and I'd probably fall over and die somehow. And that would kind of defeat the purpose of you walking me home, right?"
“You don’t seem to be all that surprised yourself,” Harry says back.
Harry desperately tries not to think about how much his body reacts to the simple gesture.
“I’m a Slytherin, Potter, self-preservation is our specialty, it’s in our blood. It’s not like anyone else will look out for us,” Draco says, though something in his tone pulls at Harry’s heart. He doesn’t realize he’s stopped walking until he feels a tug as Draco’s arm slips out from around of his. Draco turns around with an exasperated look on his face. “What is it now?”
"Yet here you are, walking me home because you're worried about my well being," Harry says with a grin.
"You're not in danger anymore."
Draco laughs quietly and Harry ignores the way his chest flutters at the sound. "Yes, apparently so," He says with an amused smile. "Do try to refrain from vomiting on me, this coat was rather expensive and I'd prefer it not get ruined."
every day you watch him fly
"I don't think I want to know," Potter says with an embarrassed groan, as a cackling Pansy hands him a small handheld mirror. He looks in the mirror then fixes Draco with a scandalized expression. "
makes you want to taste the rain
Harry shakes his head and laughs then stops shaking his head because it makes him feel horrid. "Sure, alright, whatever you say Malfoy."
"I hate when you're right..." Harry says with a barely concealed pout.
He curses his inattentiveness when Blaise elbows him, gleefully informing him that the bottle has landed on him.
He can't recall a time he's been more turned on in his
Draco makes a sound of affirmation but says nothing. A gust of wind blows past them, still managing to make Harry shiver despite the extra warmth radiating from Draco’s body.
"Jumping right in, are we?" Blaise comments with a cackle. "This should be good."
Now green means Harry.
Draco’s face flushes a brilliant shade of pink when he realizes what he’s referring to, as if just now remembering that, only a few minutes ago, they had been quite furiously snogging on the floor of a closet. “Oh sod off,” He says, holding out a hand to help Harry up. “I didn’t hear you complaining.”
calloused hands wipe off
Harry glances at his door, glances back to nod solemnly at him, then twists the knob and faces his redheaded doom.
"I think you need to re-evaluate your definition of sweet, Potter," Draco says, leaning his head back on the wall then turning it towards Harry with a soft smile that crinkles the corners of his eyes.
But then he realizes he recognizes these floor tiles. Tiles that had once been stained red with his own blood. His stomach lurches as he finds himself in a very familiar bathroom.
The kiss is laden with desire and promises of things to come. Ending much too soon for either of their likings. It's with a gargantuan amount of effort Draco pulls himself away from Harry, though they remain joined at the hands for a moment.
even in rainfall
"He's what?!" Weasley sputters as Potter's face goes bright red. Draco barely stops himself from asking the same thing, thoughts kicking into overdrive at this new information. He can't help wondering what
"You're safe now, it's okay."
then quirk an eased smile
Well, now he has a Hogsmeade late lunch date with the git. His heart races at the reminder, and he groans internally, wanting to kick himself for acting like a teenage girl the night before the Yule Ball.
," Harry groans against his neck.
Potter looks shaken as he digests this statement. "Sometimes, I find myself imagining how different things could've been if I'd just talked to you instead. If I could've saved you," He continues, swallowing thickly and looking about ready to kick himself for not being able to keep his mouth shut.
yourself, Malfoy," Potter murmurs, bringing his other hand up to wrap around the back of Draco's neck.
dare-" The words die in his throat as he seems to realize how close Draco has gotten.
It's a breathtakingly beautiful sight and Harry hopes he never forgets this moment. Just the two of them, drunk and laughing their arses off at the ridiculousness of their night as they walk home together.
He becomes vaguely aware of the fact that Potter doesn't seem to have breathed since he started the kiss, and he wonders if this is affecting Potter as much as it is him. But just as he begins to ponder the likelihood of Potter passing out on him, he lets out a controlled breath that skates warmly across the side of Draco's face.
"That was absolutely horrendous," Draco says with a disbelieving laugh that makes his shoulders shake. "You're mental."
“Brilliant,” Draco says, kissing him quickly then moving towards the door. “I’ll pick you up say…ten tomorrow morning outside of Gryffindor tower?”
Almost like Butterbeer.
“Oi I offered tonight! You just wouldn’t let me–“
So much fire.
"It's not my fault if you have spaghetti noodles for arms!"
┗━━━━━༻❁༺━━━━━┛
"As if you'll be dragging your sorry arse out of bed any earlier than noon," Draco says with a pointed look. Harry opens his mouth to retort, but at Draco's raised eyebrows, he closes it again, looking put out. "
green eyes bright alive
Now when he remembers the green flash of Avada Kedavra, he thinks of the flash of anger that burns in those eyes at injustice. That boils inside those green pools every time he catches Draco hastily healing that days bruises and hexes in their room. How the first time he had been so angry he nearly cried as Draco insisted that he was fine and to not get involved.
Smug bastard. Harry thinks with an internal laugh.
And, after a suffocatingly awkward exchange in which Draco had approached Harry in order to thank him for speaking on his behalf then shocked everyone by genuinely apologizing to Ron and Hermione, one would almost consider them to be on friendly terms.
But then Pansy decided they should play a different game. After explaining how the new game worked lots of people seemed to be on board and so started before Harry could get himself out of it. The basic idea was that she would put everyone’s name into a hat that would magically pick two people with the most chemistry and then they would be given ten minutes to do ‘whatever they want’ in a closet. The catch was that the first person was blindfolded and thus did not know the identity of their person. And the only way the blindfold can be taken off is at the end of the ten minutes or if the second person takes it off for them during the ten minutes.
He feels the unknown person approach his spot on the floor followed by the rustling of clothes as they sit down.
Grief floods through his body as he looks at the poor innocent creature now laying lifeless in his hand. He goes to run the back of his finger along the soft feathers but the moment he touches it, it begins to decay and turns to dust.
"C'mon 'Mione, I mean, the thought of him
"This will pass."
His self-preservation entertains the idea of shoving Potter away and making a break for the safety of his dorm room. His hands even get as far as grabbing the front of Potter's jumper. But when he goes to push him, his own body follows right along with him until Potter's back meets the wall with a satisfying thud.
Draco is momentarily confused by the action until he feels Harry's lips ghost up his neck. He shivers when Harry's lips come right up to his ear, murmuring "It's only fair I return the favour, yeah?"
Finally, Draco pulls away, blowing cold air on the mark as a finishing touch just because he can. He watches, gratified as Potter shivers, and breaks out in goose flesh. Before he can think better of it, he lifts his gaze to meet Potter's, and Merlin, he's so fucked. The picture of a slightly breathless Potter sporting a bright red love bite is one he's not soon to forget.
At first, he wonders if it's an unfortunate mouse that has found its way in but never made it out again. Hesitantly, he bends down to pick up the unknown lump.
"Yes," Draco replies, grasping onto the front of his t-shirt and settling against his front, knees on either side of his hips. He leans his head down on Harry's shoulder who moves his arms to wrap them around his back, pulling him even closer.
Harry stops dead in his tracks (to Draco’s great dismay). “Fuck. I just realized.”
attractive.
begging to be brushed away
“You wouldn’t like the answer, believe me,” The boy mutters, voice tinged with bitter sadness.
but now have no idea
Harry turns to Draco. "Dunno,
This only ends up making Harry’s face even pinker. He wants to laugh as he realizes Draco didn’t even need to give him the scarf to warm up his face.
whirling thoughts seem to be stuck on an endless loop of...
Accepting his fate, Draco downs the last of his drink, knowing he'll need it to survive whatever god awful plan Pansy has up her sleeve. He puts on his best 'bored' expression, looks her straight in the eyes, and says, "Dare," with all the nonchalance his pureblood breeding can muster.
He vaguely becomes aware of something hard pressing against his stomach which only serves to increase the tightness in his own pants. Harry, caught off guard by the small moan the realization elicits from Malfoy, loses his balance; sending them both toppling to the ground. Thankfully, the hand in his hair keeps his head from hitting the ground very hard.
He had almost forgotten the pain of that spell which haunts his dreams more than anything else these days. He can feel each cut as vivid as if it was actually happening; blood pooling out and around him as he struggles to breath, the taste of copper stinging his mouth.
And maybe that night he doesn’t need it anyway, because who needs the scarf when you can curl up with the real thing?
safety!"
for this.
The following silence is suffocating, but Draco's legs refuse to budge no matter how badly he urges them to let him run away. When Potter lifts his gaze and meets Draco's, he's taken aback by the intensity of his eyes from this proximity. It's only now that he realizes he must've stepped toward Potter at some point, leaving less than a metre between them.
Rubbing his eyes, he fixes his glasses and looks up at her, “how do you know all of this? You knew before even I did and it’s my life.”
Malfoy seems to be questioning Harry’s definition of awesome.
Neither were ready to face him yet since he still didn’t seem to understand their reasons. Harry knew Ron was going to take him not going into Auror training even worse than he did school. Putting that off for as long as possible seemed like a good idea.
Malfoy had been intrigued when Harry explained what they were during one of their meetups at school.
Quickly finding some scrap paper, Harry scrawls a short note along with his floo address. Leaving the mess of sandpaper and tools, he heads downstairs to make some tea. The flames in the kitchen fire turn green a few minutes later and Malfoy steps out of the grate.
“Alright, Harry. I will drop it. But one final piece of advice, I see the way you look at him when you think no one is looking. Be careful, please, because I don’t know if he will ever feel the same way about you that you do about him.”
“What changed? Hermione, the war changed everything! I have seen enough death and darkness to last any normal person a lifetime. I don’t want it anymore.”
Harry notices he is warm as he wakes up, warmer than usual in the drafty house. The next thing he notices is the body pressed up against his back and the arm wrapped around his waist. His brain makes the connection quickly despite the early hour. He tries to figure out how to extricate himself from this situation without waking Malfoy up. Before Harry can make a move he feels the other boy tense slightly as he withdraws his arms.
Between giggles, Harry manages to understand that he has a tile glued to the bottom of his jeans. Malfoy’s eyes glint with a look Harry has seen before, as his smirk settles on his face, Harry makes a decision since he can’t get Hermione’s words out of his head.
Scrubbing his hands through his hair, Harry continues, “I know you worry, that’s what you’re best at besides research and mastering new spells, but there is nothing to worry about. We have actually become friends.”
Rubbing the red spot he created, Harry sits up, “alright, let’s go.”
Harry feels a jolt of warmth at the glimpse of pure, open happiness on Malfoy’s face. All too soon the moment passes and Malfoy’s stoic mask slides back into place.
“Okay, sure,” Malfoy says as he looks over the movie case. Handing it back to Harry, he turns towards where the couch used to be and stops short.
“Let’s take the tea in to the library and I will show you.”
As Harry settles back in the bed, he tosses a blanket to Malfoy. The animated movie starts but he barely even stays awake long enough for the muses to finish their opening song.
Malfoy finds Harry a few hours later in the bathroom off the master bedroom, laying tile the muggle way. Harry stands up and he notices has bits of plaster in his hair and a line of caulk across his cheek. Turning around to find a towel to wipe his face with, Malfoy starts hooting with laughter.
Looking around, Harry realizes the ‘project’ of renovating this house was going to take even more than he thought. He had forgotten exactly how depressing the house was.
After a few moments of silence, Harry offers, “I’ve set up a television and VCR in the library. Want to go watch a movie?”
“Oh, Harry, you would be surprised how many people would be willing to support you in following your dreams. Wherever that takes you.”
“Oh, you need me to

“I’ll do a basic mind-viewing, to see if our progress has revealed any sort of trail in your mind—I might be able to see how much of the path is left,” Draco offered. “But not now. You need a break, we both do. You must feel as though you’ve just finished running across the country,” he said, and Harry huffed, nodding.
Ten minutes later, Harry broke into a run, seeing the end of the treeline, the edge of the earth. Draco yelled in alarm, but Harry was too excited to wait any longer.
“This, Potter.” He wiggled his quill, drawing Harry’s eyes down to the indigo ink smudges on his fingers.
“I take it you weren’t friends,” Kramer muttered, “considering his… background.”

“What?” Ron mumbled, his mouth full of curry.
The only things Draco could hear were the hush of the rain, the gentle music from the record, and his own pulse hammering in his ears. He knew Harry wasn’t thinking about the steps at all, anymore, the way they were moving so fluidly in that imaginary little box on the floor. The world had shrunk to this small, plant-filled, glass room, and the only thing that mattered to Draco in this moment was that he continued holding Harry close to him, no matter what.
That man is
“It’s a good film,” Harry said, smiling. He kissed Draco’s hand again. “The scene is of a bloke telling a girl all the great things he’s going to accomplish someday. He asks her what she wishes for—he’ll give her anything she wants, he’ll do whatever it takes if it makes her happy.” His smile fell as he examined Draco’s slender fingers, which curled gently around Harry’s hand. “Even lasso the moon.”
Potter’s bottle green eyes practically glowed against his coppery skin, and Draco had to take a subtle deep breath to maintain his composure on meeting them. Their intensity made his heart race. Yes, he was a beautiful man, objectively, but currently, said man looked positively
of green flame.
Malfoy shivered, but otherwise didn’t move.
He dropped the scroll onto the desk, where it immediately rolled itself back up. He scrubbed his face with his hand, trying to breathe.
The evening light dimmed as the sun set, until the only light came from the crackling fire and a few candles. Ron had his arm around Hermione on the sofa, and Draco was sat on the sofa opposite them, wearing his fuzzy slippers, his arm boldly around Harry’s shoulders. Rose had fallen asleep in Harry’s lap, wearing her very own pair of Oscar the Grouch slippers, courtesy of Draco.
And then, it was hilarious.
, stuffing his hands in the pockets of his robes to keep from touching anything.
Harry raised his eyebrows, his lips spread in a disbelieving smile. Draco scoffed, remembering Harry’s nervous, awkward dancing at the Yule Ball in fourth year.

to Harry, even if he did protect and help him.
Harry had never actually been in the Licensing Department before. They had simply given him his apparition license after the War, they hadn’t made him take the test at all. But looking around at the place, he was glad he’d avoided it before now.
Yes, this was bad. Very bad. Timsy’s glare kickstarted something in Harry’s brain, and now he remembered: an overdose like this would last for hours, and Draco would soon go into more painful convulsions, and there was nothing either of them could do about it.
conversation with something or someone who didn’t immediately think you were… different, who simply spoke to you as you are,” Draco muttered, thinking hard, carefully avoiding that awful word:
at him, and Draco was too stunned to do anything but stare, open-mouthed, as Potter turned and walked away, laughing to himself, a little bounce in his step.
“Why are you here?”
and even the fact that Draco called him Harry now, when less than a month ago he was facing a furious Potter in a hospital bed for the first time after eight years, was enough to make him feel a bit dizzy.
Stiff. Sore.
His lips pulled up into an unstoppable smile. He felt he would burst with how much he loved this outrageous, infuriating, full-time man, part-time ferret.
Harry only frowned, his face dropping into a half-hearted glare. He started writing again.
Harry nodded and left, making his way to the Pensieve Room to deposit another memory. He walked leisurely, not in any hurry to see it again, and stuffed his hands in his pockets.
“He’s stopped responding to my letters,” Narcissa said quietly, not meeting Draco’s eyes. Draco set his teacup down on the table.
“How observant.”

“Safe from what?”
“Oh?” Draco prodded.

Kingsley gave him a curious look before replying, “I’ll be in touch, Draco.”
Harry’s lips threatened to smile as his eyes found a shelf of wizard romance novels. He recognized those.
“Teddy, this is your cousin, Draco,” Andromeda motioned towards Draco with her hand. “Aunt Cissy’s son.”
Unfortunately, he couldn’t think of anything else. He couldn’t think of a single time he’d placed something he wanted to do over something he was told he had to do. It had never actually mattered, to him. He’d certainly never gotten anything he wanted at the Dursley’s, so he hadn’t bothered wanting anything. He’d only ever
“Dead serious.” Ron shook his head, adjusting his grip on the sandwich. “But honestly, er… I might be the only Senior Auror here who gives a fuck about what happens to a Malfoy.”
“You absolute

Draco sat on one of the chestnut leather sofas opposite Weasley, just as Timsy apparated in with a quiet
“No, I—” Harry swallowed. “—I know you weren’t.”
Lucius’ lip curled derisively. “You dare speak to me that way,” he growled. “I have been studying Love for months, Draco. I think I know more about it than you do.”
Draco flexed his fingers against the arms of the chair, briefly reasserting what little control he had over his body. He wiggled his feet against the floor, and suddenly remembered he had yet to find a pair of Grouch slippers for little Rose. He quickly moved that to the top of his mental priorities list, right after somehow getting himself and Boran safely out of here and locking his father away for life—or killing him, whichever came first.
No one knew what to say to that.
Harry pressed closer, their chests brushing, Harry’s nose grazing Draco’s cold cheek. He could feel Draco shaking, could hear the sound of his own heartbeat racing in his ears, and he knew Draco would be able to hear it, too. Harry’s hands came up to rest tentatively on his chest, and Draco let out a soft whimper.
“I am not boring!”
“Your pride wouldn’t allow you to be rescued by
that kind of power, Harry, I don’t want to be that kind of—“ Kingsley was yelling back, and Harry lost it. The heavy chairs in front of the desk flew to the side, landing with hard

“Thank Circe he did, Harry was about to tear down the whole of Great Britain,” Ron grumbled, taking another bite of naan. Rose was humming quietly to herself, making a little puppet with the bread, blissfully unaware. Draco simply stared at Harry in disbelief, and Harry didn’t know which part of this news was the most worrisome.

“Okay,” he whispered. “Okay. That’s a start. I’m—I’ll figure it out, I promise.” He picked up the blanket from where it had fallen on the step. “Do me a favour and… look away, or something, because I’m going to climb in bed with your son.”
Harry looked thoughtful, and sat back in his chair, putting his notebook down on the table.

Draco had been waiting in the crowd, that night, complaining to Pansy and Greg about how long Diggory and Potter were taking in the stupid maze. Meanwhile, Harry had been dueling the Dark Lord, while Draco’s father watched—Harry was so unbelievably young, and he’d been fighting for his life, no one left to save but himself,
Harry’s notebook read.
“He” sounded like a friend, or someone this person knew. If Harry believed his attacker knew Draco personally, Draco probably had a one-way ticket to Azkaban in the near future.
“You’re sure you want this, knowing
“I suppose,” Harry agreed, with an amused nod.

Draco’s vision fell forward into Harry’s head, where he existed somewhere outside of Harry’s mind, seeing once more the writhing, glowing, gold and red and green web of thought and magic that made up
“Right,” Draco replied, looking a little ill.
“Not sure what that means,” Harry admitted, smirking. “But I’d probably agree with you.”
Draco huffed a laugh, shaking his head in wonder. He wanted to snog the living daylights out of him, he wanted to take Harry apart right there in the garden, he wanted to climb on top of him and make him come undone.
She took it gingerly, adjusting her grip a few times, and looked back up at him with a question in her eyes.
“I need to speak with the Healer directly. Now,” Harry urged.
"Draco, it's me," Harry said, panting, while Draco gripped his wrists hard enough to bruise. "It's me. It's Harry. I first kissed you on the front steps of Grimmauld Place—I got too excited and accidentally bonked your nose so hard it bled. You laughed at me for an hour. It's
“Harry,” he said in a low voice. Harry didn’t look up, but he flinched, barely.
“I’ll be blunt, Malfoy—”
Therefore, when Harry appeared in the walkway at nine, Draco had the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows, crouched on one knee in the dirt in his expensive trousers, with an armful of yellow and white flowers. Not an ideal professional Healer look, in his opinion.
Ron and Harry both raised their eyebrows at him.
“I fight off greedy men all the time, Potter,” she replied in a low voice. “And even after being hit with
Draco steadily held Harry’s gaze with his own—grey against green, like fog above grass.

“Why not?”
his bowl of chicken soup nearly forgotten on the floor next to him. Occasionally he would hold up a record to show Draco, his face full of silent questions, which Draco dutifully answered.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered. Harry shook his head, breaking off a piece of chocolate and handing it to Draco. He picked up his notebook to write while Draco ate, feeling the warmth of the chocolate spread through him. It didn’t escape Draco’s notice that this was the second time today Harry had taken care of him.
“What?” Harry lifted his head. “What part?”
“What’s the occasion for bubble tea?” Draco asked, desperate to move the conversation away from his own feelings for a moment. He turned to grab the cup, stabbing the straw through the lid with relish and then humming in happiness as he took a sip. Honey milk tea, light ice. Just the way he liked it. He turned back around, expecting a very Harry-like explanation of spontaneity and love, but Harry looked… nervous. Scared, maybe? Whatever the emotion, it was wildly different than the effusively quiet happiness he’d been exuding this whole time, and Draco reached out to cup his cheek.
When he finally reached Harry, he lay his hands hesitantly on Harry’s chest. Harry froze, his heart pounding against his ribs, as if trying to reach that simple touch.
she added in another mutter, igniting another surge of guilt, and Harry felt he might actually be crushed under the weight of it all.
It looked like any other memory. He glanced up at the door, then at the Pensieve on its plinth, and back.
Draco probed, turning to face him fully.
“And the second you stepped foot into the Department, you wouldn’t be coming back out,” Harry added grimly. “All they’d have had to do was throw a

“No, something more specific, maybe, like the name of one of the chambers,” she clarified.
“And me,” Draco had to supply. “You’re going to have to trust

This seems to stun Draco speechless, which Harry had expected, so he takes the opportunity of his rare silence to barrel on.
knows.”
So far, nothing of note had happened. It was an average, bustling cafe with overworked and underpaid employees who still managed to smile at every customer. Harry sat at a small table, alone, nursing a large, delicious mocha that had long since gone cold. The baristas were clearly too busy to worry about the state of their in-house seating, which was alright, Harry thought. Someone had abandoned a porcelain cup of Earl Grey tea, with two lemon slices on the side, on the table next to him—probably before he’d arrived, as no one deigned to sit next to the creepy man sitting there
Draco furrowed his brows. “What’s unfair?” Harry shook his head, disgruntled. He returned the pen to paper.
“Like
Harry felt faint.
Eventually, Draco sighed and glanced at his watch. “We’re out of time for today, but…” he raised his wand to his temple, concentrating hard on a memory of sitting on a beach on the Amalfi Coast. He made sure he was fully clothed in this one, not exactly eager for Harry to see his scars. It was boring, but peaceful—Draco had simply sat there, on the beach, for hours, trying and failing to read a book, distracted by the beautiful scenery. He focused on the scents of the lemon groves and the feel of the sea breeze and the sun on his skin, the sounds of the waves on the rocks. Draco carefully pulled the strand of memory out of his head, stood up, and took an empty glass vial from a drawer in his desk, placing the memory inside and corking it tightly.
Draco raised his eyebrow. “And you want me to…”

“For when you have something to say that can’t be communicated with hand gestures,” Draco explained. Potter examined the notebook, opening it and touching the blank pages, rolling the blue pen between his fingers.
“Okay, so a wealthy pureblood with long hair—doesn’t have to be a woman, I’ll thank you to look in the mirror, Ronald Weasley, you mess with your hair all the time,” Hermione summarized, frowning, unable to resist the jab.
Potter nodded again, eyebrows slightly furrowed. Draco set his own notebook and pen on the side table, and handed the blank one over to Potter.
Harry laughed thickly; the air felt barbed in his throat. It looked exactly as it had when Draco wrote it, sitting crosslegged on the bed, hunched over the journal on his knee, his long hair falling onto the page.

Harry immediately sagged, landing his face in his hands. Draco called Timsy for chocolate. He pointed his wand at the chalkboard, drew a dot towards the left side, and labeled it “31/10/81”. He hated writing out morbid memories on display. He knew the date, which would be reference enough.
Draco gestured to the chalkboard. “I’ll do the mind-viewing, now, if you don’t mind,” he explained, “but while I’m in there, I’d like you to think of all the breadcrumbs we’ve seen so far, which, yes, I know, is a lot. But they may show themselves as you focus on them, which might help me see a pattern.”
“Is it working?”
until Hagrid came into the picture, and Harry apparently hadn’t known he was a wizard until then, either, just assumed all the odd happenings around him were because he was some sort of
and he never had problems finding the right words in any of them. But this dynamic was completely new, he hadn’t needed to speak around Draco before, in this sanctuary, as a man who honestly just wanted to be around him.
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but hesitated. He
“You’re better at it. Especially this one.”
He asked, exasperated, and both Harry and Hermione shook their heads, chuckling at him. Ron’s crush on Victor Krum in fourth year was their favorite thing to tease him about. As well as his subsequent feverish jealousy once Krum got with Hermione.
“And they did nothing,” Draco said, “so you watched me yourself. You had to.”
He reached the black door, and stared at it for a moment—he remembered Harry’s memory of Lucius talking to Fudge, in front of this very door. It was awful, seeing the settings of those horrible memories come to life. It made it all much more real, much too close. He felt wretched, knowing so much about Harry, walking the paths he’d walked, aware that they would never speak again. Draco took a deep breath, ignoring the tight feeling in his chest, and opened the door.
“He stopped responding to my mother’s letters, six months ago,” Draco said quietly. His knees were starting to hurt from kneeling on the hard floor in front of the fire. “That could mean anything, but my mother… I’d appreciate it if you could just… check,” he fumbled, cringing at his lack of eloquence.

She eyed him intently. Draco recognized this look, she usually wore it when she poked and prodded Draco for his secrets. “How did you find out it was American, anyway?”
“I hate you,” Draco whined, his hands trembling where they held the back of Harry’s jacket. His lips parted over Harry’s skin, his breaths hard and desperate. Harry’s hand slid to the back of Draco’s neck, into that silky hair, so much softer than he’d imagined it would be.
Kingsley walked over to Harry as Ron moved on to give the rest of the team their orders. His face was strained as he approached.
but his throat felt too dry. He cleared it awkwardly, taking another deep breath before opening his eyes again.
him. His face was strained—he looked like he was trying to force words out through his eyes, through his pores, but they wouldn’t come. Draco couldn’t help but stare back at him for a moment, before making himself speak again.
And when he showed up three minutes late, no one would suspect he had been standing in his house, eyes glued to his watch, for the past half hour, determining the exact moment his arrival would be appropriate—not insultingly late, but not right on time as if he’d been itching to go, either (even though he definitely had been). He palmed his wand, and disapparated to the coordinates Weasley had given him.
“‘Mione, can you…?”
Ron raised an eyebrow at him, and he glared again.
Draco released the spell, his vision returning to Harry’s face. He stood up and quickly walked over to the chalkboard, summoning the nearest piece of chalk.
The incessant tapping noise was real, apparently, coming from his window, and getting louder by the second. Draco refused to leave the bed in his… state, however, so the aggressive owl would just have to wait.
The chalkboard still took up a large portion of Draco’s wall where his bookshelves usually existed. Draco’s feeble notes on
He corked it and placed it on the shelf with the rest, examining the lot of them.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco whispered, knowing his voice would shake if he tried anything louder. He felt a massive weight lifting off of his shoulders, and he tried not to crumble with the subsequent rush of relief.
Harry watched him from a few meters away, both of them half-listening to their conversations. Draco’s knuckles were white around his butterbeer, the glint of the spring sun off his platinum hair nearly blinding. He nodded occasionally at Molly’s chattering about the garden—she was trying, at least, Harry thought fondly.
Draco frowned. “That? That was the worst?” Harry pressed his lips together, and continued writing.
The room seemed smaller than he remembered. Maybe it was the light, maybe he was just a little larger. Maybe it was the absence of Luna and Dean, Griphook and Ollivander. Maybe
When he opened his eyes and met Harry’s gaze, he saw that Harry’s face was tense, but resigned. That was probably as good as Draco was going to get. He raised his wand, holding it delicately, and aimed it at Harry’s head.
Pansy laughed. “I thought the same thing, when the muggle at the shop sold it to me. I handled it like a volatile cauldron for weeks, before I realized it’s quite benign. I think they call it that because it emphasizes the bass in the music, or something.”
“‘S’alright, love,” Draco whispered, just loud enough for Boran to hear, slipping subconsciously into his endearment for Camila. “We’re gonna get out of here.”
I shouldn’t have expected anything less from you. I’ll bet the tears came straight from the bird’s eyes. Please tell me the phoenix cried on you, Harry,” he implored, giggling helplessly, and Harry smiled at him as he nodded. Draco was fully laughing now.
Harry hid his shock behind his glare. Malfoy had a point. Harry would call bullshit if he started apologizing for anything, there was nothing Malfoy could say right now that would make Harry trust him at all. Harry needed to see it for himself, he needed to experience this new Malfoy, but he wouldn’t get the opportunity if he didn’t let himself have it.
“Dumb it down, ‘Mione,” Ron interrupted.
“I’m sorry to break this to you Harry, but you’re wrong,” Draco argued on their way back to the study. “Backstreet Boys was and remains inferior to N*SYNC, no matter how many more albums they made. I’ve tried telling Pansy, as well, but N*SYNC did what the Backstreet Boys wouldn’t and got out while the going was good,
“You’d obviously prefer that I don’t.”
, talking about themselves constantly. Harry evades their questions, and leaves with no one.
The snow that covered the Manor gardens made Harry think of Hogwarts, all bright, luminescent white over old stone and dark greenery. Harry watched it fall, pushing aside the curtain in the high, arched window in the library. Delicate white flakes floated down onto Malfoy’s unnaturally still form, pale and probably freezing where he sat on a marble bench in the gardens, staring unseeing into the air in front of him. Harry saw him blink, only a few times.
He wondered if Narcissa had known that. If she’d orchestrated it all to get Harry in the investigation, to bring him around Draco as much as possible. She was capable of producing feelings, perhaps she’d even made Harry fall in love—
Harry let out a bark of laughter, pulling back to look at Draco properly. He shifted his weight onto one arm, lifting the other to push his glasses firmly back onto his nose. A cool breeze ruffled the deep black curls that escaped Draco’s hands, and Draco futilely smoothed them down with his fingers.
“I’ll be there,” Harry says, stomach flip-flopping at the excited smile on Draco’s face.
“I’m just going to pretend you’re also worried about my well being, not only whether you’ll live through getting back on Hermione’s bad side,” Harry says with a tired laugh.
“But if you knew then why did you–“
Draco contemplates chucking the jumper he just removed at him, but instead turns and says, "Yes, and it was very traumatic, so I'd appreciate it if you would
"Then have me," is Potter's straightforward response, forcing Draco to meet his molten gaze.
"You finally dating then?" Seamus cuts in with a smirk.
I know the ending is a bit rushed, I was working on a deadline and my procrastination won out a bit but I will be reworking the ending eventually and editing this, I hope you still enjoyed it though!!
After levitating their luggage to the landing, Harry heads towards the kitchen, “cup of tea and then we can figure out which room you want to take?”
“Hermione, I’ve offered him one of the bedrooms. He always says he isn’t planning on staying and refuses. I’m not just going to leave him to sleep on the couch by himself.”
Malfoy stops folding the blanket and leans against the wall, “I’m not really sure to be honest. I could take over the family businesses but it would take a lot of work to build everything back up to what they once were. I never really thought about doing anything other than that. I’m not even sure what I would be good at.”
Laughing at his shenanigans, Hermione shoves his shoulder, “you’ve studied for all of these. Only two more and then we are set free.”
Malfoy finally pulls back just enough to whisper, “I’ve been waiting for you to do this,” before he nips at Harry’s lower lip and kisses him again.
“Oh Harry, you are so oblivious to a lot of things. I may not be around you two very much, but I’ve seen the way he looks at you. If nothing is going on yet, it’s not because he doesn’t want it to.”
With a shake of his head, Malfoy queries, “how can you trust me that much after everything I’ve done?”
His eyebrows raising with interest, Malfoy eagerly replies, “lead the way.”
“Oh well,” Harry begins, he rubs the back of his head sheepishly. A small blush creeps over his cheeks as he continues, “Hermione is sick of me griping about my back. Since you won’t just admit you are going to fall asleep here, I figured I could transfigure the couch into a bed. I made it big enough that we will have plenty of room to share.”
Waking up slowly, Harry feels more rested than he has in a long time. Stretching out the crick in his neck, he realizes he is still in the Astronomy tower. Looking across from him, he notices Malfoy staring at him curiously.
“Harry, it will be ok. I’m sure all you have to do is write to Kingsley. Let him know you are declining the position. Even if he doesn’t understand, he probably won’t ask you to explain,” Hermione tries to reassure him.
“Alright Potter,” he says as he claps his hands together, “what do you have picked out for us to watch this time.”
Hermione opens her mouth to respond but Harry cuts her off, “I know, you’re going to say ‘that’s what friends are for.’ And I love you for it, really I do. You are like my sister and I know I can come to you with anything. When I try to talk to you about it, I dunno, the words just get stuck. With Malfoy they just come blurting out.”
“I don’t think something scary would help either of our nightmares,” Malfoy states matter-of-factly.
“Why do you always have to say things like this, Hermione? I am still coming to terms with the fact that I might have feelings for Malfoy. That most of the reason Ginny and I didn’t work out is probably because I am gay.”
“Only one of the best movies ever made, Malfoy. Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder came together to create a brilliant story that has been told so many times over but never quite like this.”
Before long, the train pulls into Kings Cross Station. Mrs. Weasley is there to pick up Ginny while trying to convince Harry and Hermione to stay with them for a few weeks. They both make their excuses. Ron still hadn’t spoken to either of them since he’d said some pretty harsh words about them ‘abandoning’ him to go back to school.
Harry spends the rest of the day thinking about what Hermione said. He really does need to sleep on something better. Realizing she is right, he is a wizard who was decent at transfiguration, so why subject either of them to an uncomfortable couch anymore?
“Friends with Malfoy wasn’t really in the plan either. It just happened.”
Malfoy eyes him with a skeptical look but still follows when Harry heads back towards the couch.
He hears the chair scraping against the floor as Malfoy sits down at the table, “trying to distance myself.”
Harry watches Malfoy’s reaction to the movie more than he actually watches the movie himself. He only realizes it is over when Malfoy looks over at him and sputters, “what the hell was that?”
“Okay, fine, what do you want to watch?”
Harry nods, “pass the NEWTs and then figure it out, that sounds like a decent plan.”
Rifling through his tapes, Harry grins as he pulls one out, “this is one of my absolute favorites. I think you will like it better than the last one too.”
Malfoy doesn’t show up that night in the Astronomy Tower. Harry waits until the sun has risen and unless he hurries to pack his things immediately he is going to miss the train.
After a tense moment of looking between Harry and the bed, Malfoy takes his shoes off and climbs up. Harry slides the movie in and presses play. Before moving to his side of the bed, he hands Malfoy his tea and they settle in to watch Harry’s favorite Mel Brooks movie.
“I haven’t had a chance to replace the couch, so it’s not very comfortable.”
“He may understand, but not too many others will.”
“Hermione, there really isn’t much else to tell you. He sleeps as little as I do. We meet up and talk most nights when we can’t stay in our common rooms anymore. It’s better than just wandering the castle like I used to, isn’t it?”
As Harry sands down the floor of what will eventually be his permanent bedroom, he hears a peck at the window. With a quick glance to the clock he notices it is after midnight and wonders who is sending an owl this late.
“I said, we should probably get going so that we aren’t late. You know how Hermione worries if you miss breakfast,” Malfoy repeats.
It’s been two weeks since the end of school. Harry notified Kingsley that he was turning down the Auror position the day after they returned from school. It took him three more days to tell Ron. He and Hermione had gone to visit the Weasley family and he told everyone at once. Ron did not take the news well at all, refusing to even tell Harry, and by extension Hermione since she supported his decision, goodbye when they left.
“Malfoy, we could have hexed each other multiple times throughout the last few months. I’m pretty sure you would have already tried to kill me if that was your intention.”
As if sensing Harry’s scrutiny, Malfoy starts to wake up. Pulling his gaze away as the other boy stretches, Harry turns his gaze to the familiar trees. Hoping the blush burning on his face isn’t noticeable.
After he placed the tea next the the television, Harry showed Malfoy Young Frankenstein.
He notices a slight mistiness to Hermione’s eyes as she bats him away, muttering a small, “always.”
“It has to be better than the stone floor at school.”
Harry pauses as he lets Hermione’s words sink in. Heaving a large sigh, he throws his arms around his best friend, “thank you,” he whispers, as he squeezes her tight. He hopes she understands everything he can’t say. Thank you for always being there, no matter what. Thank you for keeping me alive when I would have died a thousand times over. Thank you for supporting even though you don’t always understand. And most importantly, thank you for being the best friend I could ever ask for.
“Hermione, what the hell are you talking about? We are just friends.”
Groaning, Harry bangs his head on the table, “no,” he mumbles.
After a long pause, he finally whispers, “that was the best damn sleep I’ve ever had.”
“I thought you were going to become an Auror when you are done,” Malfoy states.
Smirking over at Harry, he remarks, “you have really weird taste in movies.”
The teasing glint in Malfoy’s eyes is all Harry needs to see to know there is no truth to Malfoy’s statement. As they sit and banter back and forth while they finish their tea, Harry watches Malfoy’s shoulders become less tense. He sees the strain ease off his face. And after finishing their second cup, Malfoy takes a deep breath as if he’s been starved for oxygen and has finally been able to find some.
It takes Harry a week before he is tired of transfiguring the couch in the library and after he spent so much time renovating the master bedroom, he decides to just move the television and VCR into his room. Malfoy doesn’t put up as much of a fuss as Harry expects. The weeks stretch on with the same routine. Harry works on parts of the house, Malfoy comes over at night to watch movies, they wake up wrapped around each other in the morning.
Draco’s piercing gaze follows every movement before snapping back up.
“I’m glad you decided to not-celebrate your birthday with me...I...had a lot of fun if I’m being honest.” Harry laughs self-consciously, feeling his face heating once again.
"You're a bloody handful, you know that?"
"Right, yeah," Potter answers faintly, a dark flush beginning to creep up his neck and dust his cheeks. Draco pointedly tries
“Gods, save it for the bedroom!” She says, sounding scandalized. “I’d really rather not have that mental image in my head, thank you very much. Just the thought of you two snogging is nightmare material enough.”
Okay scratch that. Perhaps “ex-enemies who now have no idea how to interact with each other so they avoid it as much a humanly possible without seeming downright rude” would be a tad more accurate.
"Don't fall in," Blaise calls after him on instinct.
“But I’m here now, right?” Harry says after the admission sinks in. “And I’ll be here for you as long as you’ll have me,” He says, threading his fingers through Draco’s and squeezing. Draco stares down at their joined hands as if he can’t comprehend it, and perhaps he can’t. He rubs his thumbs against Harry’s hands, taking a deep breath and feeling the most calm and grounded he has in years.
"If it'll get you to shut up about it," Draco says with an eye roll. He takes the glass and downs the whole thing before handing it back, nestling back into his spot against Harry's chest. "Tastes like piss."
That night (though not unlike most other nights if he's being honest) he dreams of mischievous green eyes, scruffy black hair, and a private, fond smile that has him falling all over again.
Sensing Harry's sudden change in mood, Draco attempts to lighten it by teasing "I'm shocked! Golden-Boy finally knows something and he learned it from Granger!"
He cracks a wry smile. “Is that your way of asking me out?”
“Absolutely,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s hand back. And then he’s pulling him back in and kissing him so sweetly Harry’s heart melts a little bit more.
Wanting to encourage the boy, Harry gently cups his cheek, running his thumb along sharp cheekbones and smooth skin. Shifting the angle of his head slightly, Harry slides his tongue along the boy’s bottom lip as if asking for permission. This seems to catch the boy off guard, if his tiny gasp is anything to go by. Harry takes the opportunity to slip his tongue inside the boys slightly open mouth.
"Sure you have." Harry says with a soft chuckle, patting his head before resuming his gentle strokes.
makes you yearn to fly
"Okay but seriously you should drink some water." Harry says, conjuring a full glass and holding it out towards the pouting boy in his arms.
“Your nose was turning pink,” Draco blurts out as doubt seems to creep into his head.
everyone's.
He begins saying "It wasn't real, just breathe," over and over in his head like a mantra as he tries to regain control of his erratic breathing. His head feels fuzzy and a ringing in his ears drowns out all other sound. "It wasn't real dammit," he repeats in barely more than a whisper; each breath he drags in feeling like it's being forced back out before it reaches his lungs.
"Yeah, yeah, just know who you'll have to deal with if you hurt him, alright?" Weasley throws over his shoulder, though more out of duty as Harry's best friend than with any actual malice.
"Fuck, Potter," Draco says, those three words shooting straight to his quickly hardening cock.
If, however, you told him he would later find himself going to a gay bar with said Draco sodding Malfoy, he would’ve gawked then laughed in your face.
“Lets make his life even more miserable! It’s what scum like him deserves after all, isn’t it?”
Malfoy, who has apparently been pining after him for four fucking years. Who Harry had been trying not to stare at the entire night (key word trying). The boy who could always get his attention and get under his skin like no one else. The boy he used to hate, now here, kissing him in a closet like he’s something to be cherished.
"Right, sorry," Potter stumbles, pulling an odd face at the unexpected crudeness of Draco's phrasing. He steps into the hallway, and Draco nearly trips over his feet in his haste to get inside.
Seeming to sense that Draco has pulled away, Harry opens his eyes and fixes him with a confused look. His eyes widen when he too seems to notice the approaching voices and becomes aware of their quite compromising position. But then, with a devilish smirk, he shrugs and drags Draco back in for a languid kiss.
"Fuck yes," Harry gasps, dragging Draco's mouth back to his and claiming it hungrily. Greedy hands roam all over Draco's body before gripping his arse, encouraging the achingly slow grind of his hips. With the next thrust, he guides Draco's hips to a slightly different angle, moaning "Yes, right there, feels so good."
it makes you want to
Harry glances over at him from the corner of his eye and it seems as if he's holding his breath unintentionally. He looks shocked, or like he's figuring out an extremely difficult potions recipe. Harry can practically hear the gears turning in his head. But a second later he seems to come to a conclusion, and then he's letting the breath out and ever-so-slightly leaning into Harry's touch.
“If you wish to word it that way...yes,” Draco says with a long-suffering sigh before offering a small smile of his own.
“Harry would
He didn’t have time to dwell on it, however, because at that moment, a small human with a full head of turquoise hair came dashing around the fountain in the middle of the huge, plant-filled, glass room, stopping in front of Andromeda and holding up something wiggly and potato-shaped in his hand.
Draco let out a whimper of mixed fear and relief as Harry's hot, trembling body covered him. "I waited—"
it had happened. Taking in his surroundings, he guessed this was a muggle pub. He felt drunk, distantly, and knew he was experiencing the memory as… as Potter. This hidden memory was of Potter, drunk, at a cozy looking muggle pub.
Draco looked away, retrieving a blank notebook and another muggle ball-point pen from his desk, gathering up his own notebook and making his way towards the comfortable wingback chairs that faced each other in front of the fire. He gestured for Potter to join him, doing him a favour and taking the seat with his back to the door. Potter eyed him thoughtfully as he sat down across from Draco, his calloused fingers rubbing the rich leather of the armrests. His shoulders were tense, and he kept his feet firmly planted on the floor, instead of leaning back or crossing his legs like Draco.

However.
and if you die, know that I won’t be bothered with your funeral.”
His hair had grown barely past his chin, just long enough for him to tie half of it up to keep it out of his face. The roses along the path were in full bloom, a myriad of colours, made brighter by the summer sun. Harry watched as Draco looked back over his shoulder, smiling at something Narcissa must have said, laughing fondly when he saw a camera aimed at him.
Harry grinned at this, looking incredulous, and handed him the containers of rice and creamy Chicken Tikka. Draco dug into it eagerly as Harry tore himself some naan and started in on his Vindaloo, a contented smile on his face.
Draco unlocked the secret cabinet and pulled out the Pensieve, floating it over towards where Harry stood, in the middle of the room. He plucked the vial labeled “Dobby” off the thin shelf, and made his way back to Harry.
Dudley swung open the door before they were even fully off the bike, and Draco froze, his jaw dropping open. Harry’s cousin sauntered over happily, greeting them in his booming voice.
“Don’t want to let go,” he said. Draco chuckled sadly.
“Would you like anything to drink? Make a ‘C’ with your hand, for coffee—“ Draco demonstrated the gesture, “—a ‘T’ for tea, or a ‘W’ for water.” Potter tilted his head, and made a ‘C’ with his hand.
chair. He watched Harry for his reaction, still slightly worried that he would be angry at the thought of Teddy visiting Malfoy Manor. Draco certainly never wanted Camila to step foot there, but perhaps that was his own baggage. Harry’s last visit there hadn’t been a very

him. Draco stuffed his hands in his pockets, clearing his throat softly.
Willem flapped his hand dismissively from the cockpit. Harry stepped out onto the bow, his knees bent and thighs tense to keep himself balanced with the boat’s rocking movements. Willem cut the engine and stepped out to watch.
Harry turned to Hermione, practically begging, thrusting a hand out in Malfoy’s direction. Hermione only pursed her lips at him.
“Rose, come say hello,” Hermione urged, and the girl walked slowly out from the hallway, half her face hidden by her hair. Draco was reminded of Camila, who was also terribly shy with strangers. She hid her face in her hair the exact same way.

, Harry.”
His eyes darted around every corridor and doorway nervously. He would probably never stop feeling unsafe, in his childhood home, after what it had seen. They could scrub the blood out of the stone, but they couldn’t scrub out the memories or the nightmares, or the unnatural, heavy weight of Dark Magic residue. Draco had only become more sensitive to it with his training—another thing his mother didn’t understand.
“Yes,” Harry answered, turning his glare back to the Minister, holding his hand out towards the door. “After you.”
Harry only shook his head again, and picked up his notebook and pen to write a response.
it was even through the torture of his bonds, and know that he’d never have it again, or to have never kissed Harry Potter at all, and gone his entire life wondering
Draco’s lips were an incredible shade of dark pink, his sharp, pale face flushed. His jumper was disheveled from Harry’s wandering hands, and his brilliant smile reached his eyes, the grey of his irises nearly glowing against his face—like drops of morning dew on new, spring grass, refracting the light around them. Harry was utterly mesmerized, torn between the desire to stand there and continue staring at him like an idiot, and the urge to close the distance between them and kiss him again.
