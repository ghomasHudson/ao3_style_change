“Yes, that’s exactly where the bonus will go” Draco couldn’t stop laughing at Harry’s humour, he leaned back against Harry’s chest and let himself be kissed by Harry “I love you, my soulmate”
knew how to make chocolate
” He let out a small whimper and covered his mouth again. Luckily, Draco and Harry were yelling so they didn’t hear what sound Ron just made “
“Please stop doing that, you look like you’re about to have a stroke” He said, making the guy frown, only four minutes to go. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and watched the guy embarrassed himself thinking he was successful in wooing Draco. This guy was a menace, he looked at Pansy for help but she could only give him a grin and a shrug. He should never trust Pansy every again.
“Me…confessing to you through a letter, but you left” He mumbled, Harry rubbed his back and pulled Draco to look at him
“Maybe I am” He said, picking up his quill and started writing. Maybe they’d suspect him for acting odd, but it was for the better, he could take it.
” Draco mumbled to himself, he clutched on his bag and shook his head, his right foot tapping repeatedly on the ground, he was standing in the middle of the Great Hall alone, his back against the wall. They have just finished eating dinner, and guess what day it was,
“Oh, okay…”
, and Pansy wants you to join your bloody party. If we don’t bring you back, she’ll kill us” Ron said as the guys carried Harry up in the air using magic “It’s your birthday, for Merlin’s sake, you should celebrate it”
!” She yelled the last word in Draco’s face and ended the call
! You’re up for makeup, that means you go to Draco for it, after that, go to Theo for clothes!” Pansy yelled and Terry Boot stepped up first “Hurry up, people, we don’t have all day, tick tock motherfuckers”
“We’re just gonna moved to that spot, next to Blaise and a drunk Ron” Pansy pulled her wife with her, just three steps away from the two Aurors. She locked her arms around Hermione’s neck and mumbled “You think it’s gonna work?”
again”
“Oh, yeah, totally”
Theo couldn’t care less, he swallowed Neville’s length and kept going, his hips moving on its own, pushing back against Neville’s tongue inside him, it felt
to be easy to forget”
Pansy shrugged and gave a small shriek when Hermione walked in the pub with Neville and Theo “
“It’s not that easy” Theo nudged him “I
“A what?”
“Yeah, I was…surprised, I didn’t say anything”
“It’s just, Merlin, you’re beautiful” Harry said, shaking his head and looked at Draco when they arrived on the second floor “You’re just so fucking gorgeous, I can’t believe this is real”
!” Hermione hummed, her nose crinkled every time she focused on thinking about something “The room is filled is people! How do we get the two of them to be next to each other and kiss right at midnight? You know some people here want to kiss Harry!”
Potter said, looking at Draco up and down, which only made the blond realised he was once again in his thin silk bathrobe in front of the Auror “I’m here, er, because, I, I want to—…”
“Yeah” Hermione nodded “And, Fred, George, and Mundungus Fletcher”
“What’s wrong?”
“No, why do you think I lost something?”
Draco yelled and Pansy laughed loudly before getting out of the room, the blond turned around and cupped Harry’s face “Are you alright? Did I hurt you?”
“Alright”
“Well
“You are already that” Blaise smirked but stopped when he realised Ron was serious “I can put up with that, I like you being jealous, it means that you like me enough”
suggested Madam Pince that some people should organise the books in the library,
“He has a boyfriend”
“Thanks” Potter said, cupping the hand Draco still left on Potter’s face with his and spoke “Er, you look-…”
“You’re friends with Granger?” He asked but Pansy only chuckled at him again, running her hands through her hair
“Want me to go back with you?” Draco tapped his shoulder and Theo turned around, the photoshoot quickly ended after an hour because Cormac wanted to redo his photoshoot and it took
“I was just in the bar earlier” Potter said and sat down “Just saw Pansy and she told me to go in first”
“Er, well, not
“You two are crazy, you hear me?
“Oh” Draco put a hand on his heart and pulled Pansy in for a hug “You’re so sweet”
Draco shook his head and pointed at their locked hands. He pressed their hands against his chest “Er, I…
“Well, can I ask you something?” He asked, waiting for a nod from Draco. He only continued after a few seconds, his hands playing with the sleeves of his robes, he was anxious for some reasons “Okay…do you know the guy that…brought me to the hospital wing?”
“Oh, dear, don’t cry” Molly said, pulling him in a warm hug, she smelled like biscuits and cocoa when he embraced her. He didn’t know something like this could make him cry. This was what Molly wanted to say, what the Weasleys wanted to tell him, that they accepted him, and it made Draco’s heart warm. He clutched the sweater in his arms as she caressed his hair softly “It’s okay, Draco” She squeezed him tight and he could hear the door creaked open “Oh, Harry, dear, come here” She slowly let Draco sit back and stood up so Harry could replace her in the spot “I’m going to check on Teddy”
He exclaimed as reality started to hit him. Did somehow the mirror took him to another world? A parallel world perhaps?
“Draco, you came” Luna said, he stared at her shirt, the one that says ‘
“It wasn’t really a confession, to be honest” Draco explained, Ernie was stuttering the whole time so he wasn’t even sure what he was trying to get at “He just babbled a lot, I finished his sentence for him, then I gave him the address”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine, just traumatised a bit, perhaps”
Another week passed by and Harry was still sulking at home, all he did was working and sleeping, as usual, he didn’t have the motivation to do anything, he felt like there was something missing. After the uncomfortable situation on the opening night of Ron and Blaise’s restaurant, Harry had headed outside and stood there, leaning on the wall of the place, he felt suffocated just being in there at that time. Maybe he stood there for ten minutes, maybe half an hour, he didn’t check the time, he went straight home after that. Harry looked up when he heard his phone ringing, it was Draco. The Auror sighed harshly, he wasn’t ready to face Draco yet, he was such a coward. He waited until the call ended and continued watching the television, though he wasn’t sure if he was
Draco stepped to the side, totally forgetting the fire near him, there was a loud thud from the door. Draco walked up carefully before jolting and stepping back as the door was crashed opened by a…
listen to my advice, er, when did you ask me and didn’t…”
“Is Blaise tolerable?” He asked while waiting for Ron to make his move on the board “He can be cold”
“The three of them are all wearing robes, and she’s the first one you noticed?”
“You’re obsessed with him”
“What?” He mouthed as Potter scribbled something else down for him
“Yes” The blond nodded, putting Theo’s legs around his waist “Pansy might have given me a book on sex positions on my birthday two years ago”
Pansy clutched on her wife whenever she felt speechless, Hermione was the one to always be able to finish her sentence “
“Custom made?”
remembered saying I don’t trust this guy but you went and dated him anyway,
“We’ll
The redhead yelled, calling Potter to his spot,
“Come on, Ravenclaw, used to be a Chaser, and the Quidditch’s captain?” Draco smirked, glancing at Davies, who was standing next to Neville “That’s a catch”
Pansy bellowed loudly, bringing the attention back to her “
“His cigarettes” Draco said, picking up the boxes from the table, the jerk always had a thing for cigarettes, which Draco hated, he threw it in under the girls’ chants and smiled a bit, the bastard deserved it “His car keys”
“You know me so well” Pansy grinned and pinched Draco’s cheek
“I hope you’ll ask me”
?” Little James’s eyes lightened up at Harry’s words, Draco chuckled at it yet he couldn’t deny what he had said “What does it mean?”
“Why?”
“The same reason as you, I guess, Hermione suggested we stay, and we all did” Potter said shortly, his fingers playing with each other, he rolled down his sleeves again and gazed at the blond “And, uh, well, it felt less lonely here”
“Ron—…”
“You cannot believe what just happened!” Pansy squeaked and Hermione immediately looked up at her, smiling and then giving her a kiss
“Are you seriously asking me that?” Granger chuckled, pushing her hair back behind her ear “A lot, I might say, he’s been in love with you for a long time, always wondering what you’re doing, always wanting to be with you, to see you. At first, I didn’t understand why he’s so swooned with you, but when I got to know Pansy, I know how he feels, and I can say that he’s in love with you very deep, Draco. Why do you suddenly want to know?”
“A baby sheep” He said and Draco froze, he has to stop himself from laughing. Pansy was really crazy with this. He squeezed some moisturiser into his hand and started applying it on Boot’s face
“Okay, fine, you and your eyes” Draco sighed, retreating his hand so he could open the gate. Once there was nothing between them, Harry took his hand again, intertwining it and pressing his lips against Draco’s knuckles “Harry”
“Done
“I can be a tease too” Harry chuckled and stood up, facing Draco again, the blond buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, unable to speak when the Auror was still hitting his sensitive spot inside
” He cursed softly, feeling Blaise hitting that sensitive spot inside him. He couldn’t believe he was letting Blaise fuck him in the bathroom stall right now, with his cock up in Ron’s arse, his hand on his waist, Ron felt hot all over. Blaise turned his face around for a kiss and Ron couldn’t even kiss him properly, since he was so focused on trying not to fall on his knees every time Blaise shoved in deep
The girls must be lying. Because there’d be
“What happened to your hand?”
about him that Harry couldn’t figure out, he just wanted to rip the mask off so he could see more.
“Yeah”
“Alright, no big deal” He ran his hands through his hair and tried to fix it while calming his breath, Draco ran for five straight minutes without stopping, he has to have a break first “Just knock” He murmured to himself, and knocked on the door twice. Draco waited, tapping his foot on the ground and fiddled with his fingers, he looked around, there was no one around, only the streetlights. He knocked on the door again and bit on his lips, maybe Potter was asleep, it was an hour after they got home, and it was nearly midnight, so it was possible that Potter has gone to b—Draco stilled himself the second he heard the doorknob rattled, he braced himself for this moment, it was all or nothing.
you left, Draco called and told Pansy, we all knew immediately”
“Sorry, I didn’t bring my handkerchief with me” Draco said softly “Better?”
“I like you” He said in a rush “I like you so much, I have liked you since Eighth Year, I have liked you even more when I’m 20, I still like you now, even greater than that, I thought I could hate you but I can’t. And I realised I like you, like, I just ran here, I never run” He stood on his tiptoe and leaned closer to Potter “I’m sorry I took this long”
Pansy whispered and poured more wine into her glass, pretending like she didn’t say anything seconds ago. Harry cleared his throat, it was time.
knows”
“What-…”
Draco finally forced himself to open his eyes, only to see a red ceiling above him, red curtains, red beds, a red tie at the end of the bed. He looked around, it was…it looked like Gryffindor dorms. Draco looked down at the person hugging him, black hair, steady breath, and shirtless.
“What clue?” Draco asked but Pansy just clicked her tongue and rested back on her chair “Hermione? What the hell is your wife saying?”
help him after all.
He began licking away the chocolates, his hands pulling Draco’s trousers down and throwing it on the ground. With the wave of his hand, Draco felt a cold flow of magic in him. Harry slid his fingers over Draco’s rim as his mouth was still latched on the blond’s skin, sucking off all the remained chocolate. He put one of the strawberry on Draco’s nipple in his mouth and sucked on his bud, twirling his tongue while his finger pushed inside Draco’s lubed hole.
“Just so we’re clear, I
Ron shouted after him, their glasses clinking against each other again, spilling it all over the table. Theo sat back down, his eyes twinkling when he spotted Neville again, Draco smirked knowingly
“Hey,
“Okay, that’s cool” He nodded, folding the napkin on his lap as a way express his feelings, he felt like his heart was like a piece of parchment rolled up into a ball, thrown into water and got eaten by the giant squid in the Black Lake “
Draco ran to the couch and grabbed his phone, he clutched it to his chest before taking a clear look at the guy. Sharp jawline, round glasses, untidy black hair, broad shoulders, Draco has never been so mesmerised by a guy before, he was now “
“I’m done” Draco said loudly to announce Potter and the Gryffindor finally curled up on the bed next to him. They both looked up and then it got quiet
Brandon is here” Harry sighed, he never asked the guy’s name, he didn’t really care.
Pansy, look at Harry with that stupid smile on his face” Hermione grinned at him “You two look incredibly happy”
” Rose argued, wiggling in Harry’s arms, Harry pressed his lips together, this night could
“I was, on the night of the restaurant’s opening. But, er, Brandon appeared”
bad, maybe some got in his glasses “Please don’t rub your eyes, sir, it will only generate more infections” He let his eyes fall down to the man’s body, he was wearing a black leather jacket outside a white t-shirt, and a pair of black jeans with black boots, this man didn’t seem like a ‘
Draco turned around to see Weasley screaming, pointing his finger at the cauldron, with Potter standing next to him, staring at Draco from afar.
“I want to kiss you badly right now” Harry said, earning a chuckle from Draco, the blond leaned closer and pressed his lips on Harry’s. That kiss during the game was already way too much for him to handle, but now, it was even more than that.
“Why are you blocking my view?”
, I didn’t expect it either” Theo laughed and sighed happily “I felt it, you know, in my heart, that he’s right for me, Neville is right for me”
“Okay, just, okay, stand here in front of me” Ron pushed Blaise into the spot he was standing earlier and stood behind Blaise, poking his head out to the right to look at the girls “So, I have something to tell you”
“Yeah, I actually was going to ask, er, for your number anyway, well, I considered it, I thought you were pretty out of my league” He gave Draco a lopsided grin and scratched the nape of his neck “So I didn’t know whether I should ask or not”
“I know, me too, I know now, I only need you” He said, sniffling a bit and pouting at Harry when he remembered what happened back in the pub “When I saw you, I also thought you’ve moved on, you were smiling with everyone”
Theo snorted and pulled Neville down by his neck “Then show me what you got from your ‘
“Why are you staring at me?”
“Yeah, I was kind of held back”
getting on your back, Potter” Draco stepped back carefully, there was no way he would ever do that
!” Ron beamed when he saw Harry and Rose “Oh no, who bullied you, Rose?”
“I don’t know how to do it, once I get back” It was what he was worried most when he got back. How could he do it, facing someone who hated him? Before this, it’d be fine because he hated Potter too. But now, it was different.
“Harry, no, I can’t take it” Draco said, pushing Potter’s hands back when he opened the small black box to show two rings inside, it was silver and looked the same, it seemed like a pair of promise rings. He could not take it, it was not meant for him “Harry, stop, I’m not the Draco you know”
he didn’t notice.
Draco hasn’t run like this for a long time, the moment he was out of breath, he was already there.
“The Hufflepuff girls dared her to play a drinking game, I couldn’t stop them” Luna sighed, it was true, the girls in Hufflepuff were really persuasive, and Ginny was overly competitive, it was a deadly combination
“Yeah, I’ll catch up later” Potter said and then there was only the two of them left in the hall, Draco stood there, his heart still beating fast.
with other Houses, which means now I have to sort out the library with
“Yeah, she just did today. Didn’t you see them holding hands at the end of the ceremony earlier?” Harry asked and Draco shook his head, he was so caught up in his own messy thoughts that he didn’t notice anything else “She didn’t ask Ron because he’d get protective and all, Hermione was busy so she didn’t want to bother her, so she asked me for some advice, I told her I’m not good at it so I just advice her to tell the truth”
“Oh, nothing much” Pansy shook her head, pointing her wand at Draco’s clothes and transformed it into a dress robes, startling the blond. Rose started running to Draco’s spot and smiled at him
“You’re worth it” Theo couldn’t help but let out a smile after hearing Neville’s response.
“I thought you and uncle Draco were a…c…a—…” She paused, trying to think of the exact word “A
Draco.
“So two years?”
“Blaise and I are fine, the honeymoon were spectacular. And, did Pansy leave because of Hermione again?” Ron cackled when Draco nodded “As usual. So…” The redhead looked at the both of them before talking again “Hannah told me what she saw when I came in”
“And why? To humiliate myself?” Draco put the jar back in the box once he was done and picked up the lotion “Stand up”
“Oh well, we have couple massage tomorrow, to deal with your soreness” Pansy suggested “Not before hiking though”
I felt it!”
“Do you like herbal tea?” Draco turned around to see Harry looking through the kitchen cabinets, his back flexing when he reached up to the high shelf. The firefighter didn’t even put on a shirt, how dare he? Who could actually be
She grunted at him and kept repeating her actions
“Is Harry your name too?”
“Let her” Harry chuckled, he has no intention of leaving this office until his birthday was over, that was why he decided to do paperwork tonight “She can do whatever she wants”
“That’s because that mirror right there, it’s the Mirror of Eramthgin, that’s what my parents call it, now the young ones call it the Mirror of Nightmare” He said, explaining to Draco the difference.
Dean approached her from behind, tapping her shoulder and breathing heavily, seemed like he just ran here “So I talked to Leanne, since you asked me to ask her about her dad’s broom shop, but she said his shop is also out of Nimbus 3000”
, and for a while now too, even though Hermione insists that I have been in love with you way longer than that. But, er, the point is, I still like you, and though at first, we weren’t really getting along when we first got assigned in the same dorm, but I guess everything works out fine” He smiled at Draco, showing a bit of dimples on his cheeks “I like how…you bite your lips when you’re thinking, I like how you always drink
He murmured and walked past it three times, watched as the door appeared. When he opened the door, Harry was there, standing in front of the Mirror of Erised, his body stilled like a statue “Potter…what are you doing here?” he asked, stepping forward to Harry’s spot
“What’s wrong? Why are you not eating?” Potter asked while peeling his shrimp
“Hey” Hermione swam to their spot and joined in the conversation “What are you talking about?”
did it seven years ago!”
“Oh…” Draco said. Was his intuition right the whole time? Should he say something? Should he let them be? “Thanks, don’t tell Theo that, okay?”
married, after so many proposals that Harry has stopped counting,
“Thank you, Poppy” He let out a soft smile as she left the bed and headed to the door. He was alone again, and the moon was his only company.
“Er, not really” Boot said “I don’t know how to pose with my animal”
, oh my boss is going to fire me”
“Trust me, I don’t want to be here, but
“Where have you been?” Pansy looked up from her Witch Weekly when Theodore came into the dorm, it was the boys’ dormitory, but somehow Pansy got in anyway
“Absolutely, we will have lunch, then we’ll go to that horse ranch, then swim, then dinner, and then finally…we’ll be sitting at the beach again to stargaze, and then we’ll be home before midnight, I’ve already have the Portkey made and ready” Pansy said “We can make it”
” Draco mumbled to himself.
“That’s my cue” Ron smiled, standing up and looked at himself in the mirror again “Oh, and, you should…trust your feelings too” He said, winking at Draco and walked away. Draco furrowed his eyebrows and stared at the guy.
“Why? What’s wrong with him? He just sat down next to me” Draco exclaimed, it wasn’t like he could tell him to get away. He thought this was a world where people were nice all the time “What was I supposed to do?”
“Whatever you say, Draco, all I know is you’ve been asking why the girl Weasley broke up with Potter since this morning. That’s why Blaise’s sitting far away, he doesn’t want to hear you rambling about Potter anymore” She said, pursing her red lips and flipping the pages in the book like she was actually studying “Maybe she’s interested in someone else, maybe Potter’s interested in someone else, you don’t know. The point is, it’s none of your business, Draco. Why do you even bother?”
“Maybe Harry should carry you on his back again”
“Oh, that’s Harry” Penelope said while leaning on another car with Draco “He’s our best detective, the one with the red hair is Ron, his best friend, also a very good detective”
“Sure we do” Draco said “But, don’t you two have a private dinner?”
teasing him. Draco bit his lower lips when Harry stroke his hard length, he also hasn’t had sex in days because he was so busy with his work, he felt so pent up all over his body.
disobey her. Ron pressed his lips together and switched places with Harry, sitting down next to Blaise. If Draco moved when Harry sat down, Blaise didn’t move an inch, and now their shoulders touched, Ron had to stop himself from blushing
“Why?”
“And huge, I’ve seen it” Pansy winked at him “So it
“Hi, Weasley”
“Are you tired?” Draco asked, they have been walking for a while now, or
sprayed at the next man he saw,
“Does Pansy need tutoring again?” He finally stopped writing and looked at Draco “I thought she’d need it once we’re a day before the test?” Somehow Eighth Year took a little longer to end than the semester he had spent over there, so now Draco has to study again for the N.E.W.T.s tests, but it was fine, he enjoyed it.
Draco moved his hips on his own, making the other piece of strawberry fell from his chest. Harry picked it up and put it in Draco’s mouth, his finger pressing on the blond’s plump lips.
“What on earth are you talking about?” Draco stood up, facing Harry, his face was clearly enraged “How could you assume things like that? Brandon is a sincere guy”
I just blurted that out?”
that she’s the waitress, so Blaise will help her if needed, you just sit here, talk to Draco, and…
feel something wrong when he saw Brandon hugging Draco
“Not really” She pouted, fidgeting with the bracelet on her wrist “But I am eager to talk to that one right there” She pointed at a blonde girl and Draco gaped
“I don’t know, I just feel like this is a special day for us” He said, kissing Draco’s cheeks “I want to love you in a special way today”
“Why do you need one when you have a
“How to say no?”
“I don’t see anything” Draco said after eyeing his arm carefully “You were bitten?”
“She’s all about the alcohol, the games, and dancing” He said, remembering all the parties Pansy had created for the Slytherin “But it won’t absolutely be bad, since Granger and others will still be there”
“It’s…” Harry swallowed hard, Draco’s eyes were glued on him, staying there, looking into his soul, like he was searching for the truth himself “I like someone, and, and they have blond hair, so Ron thought it would make sense”
” Rose finished “And for drinks, we have B…Beau Joie Rosé Champagne, because my mummies have it” Harry smiled at her, how could a kid be this cute? He glanced at Draco, but the blond was focused on Rose as well. Draco changed, he was even paler than before, he didn’t look like he eat properly, Harry felt his heart dropped when he thought about how Draco didn’t care to eat, Draco always eat when he was with Harry, he’d never let Draco go hungry “It’ll take only a few minutes, I think” Harry watched as the little kid sprinted into the kitchen and felt the silence rising again. He needed to break the ice.
“Come, I’ll show you my room” Draco took his hand again and they both walked up the stairs.
” Draco covered his eyes with his hands at the sight, Pansy only has her
“I-I’m sorry, what?”
“Only kiss?”
“It’s what you secretly love about me” Harry said, beaming like a kid. Then there was a moment of silence, just both of them looking into each other’s eyes. And as though someone was nudging him, Draco leaned closer like Harry and closed his eyes, the blond could feel his breath ghosting over his lips, he liked the Harry here, and maybe he can like the other one too, once he knew how to go back. When a sudden cold breeze hit him, Draco opened his eyes again, there was no one in the room.
“Are you al-…”
Draco gasped, clutching on the balcony as Harry started lubing him up while squeezing his arse, luckily he was always prepared for sex, but Draco has no idea where Harry found the lube. The firefighter’s tongue began running around his rim, teasing him mercilessly until Draco whined “
He exclaimed loudly, shutting the door by magic and walked to Draco’s spot “Tell me what you know”
” Draco turned around and gaped at the man that just bumped into him in the pub, he hasn’t seen Potter for…maybe months “Nice to see you here”
“You promise?”
” Harry said, turning off the tap, Draco’s boyfriend stopped at the sink next to Harry and started washing his hand, they remained in silence for a while until Brandon spoke
“You have a point”
Ron gasped, staring at the board with wide eyes “
“Hey, is there a problem here?” Draco’s eyes widened when he looked up to see Potter standing behind his lounge chair. When did he get here?
“Then why are you hiding in the kitchen instead of staying out there to talk?”
was late and lost the big booth we usually sit in”
” Pansy nodded knowingly and elbowed Hermione “We should go, we still got another part of the date we haven’t got to do”
” before coming inside him. Theo let out a relieved laugh and released his legs from Neville’s waist, lying satisfyingly on the floor
“Okay” Hermione said, winking at them both “We’ll go, see you this Sunday. You’re in good hands, Harry’s a good guy” She said with a warm smile, and walked back to her car together with Pansy
“What did she say?”
” Draco rolled his eyes and flopped down on the chair in front of her. He should have known Pansy would be the one to plant this idea in Potter’s head, the Auror would never do this kind of stuff “Who’s gonna be there?”
“Draco” Harry said after staying in silence for a minute, he actually got all of the voicemails Draco had sent him, asking him out to eat, he just didn’t have the guts to answer. Instead, he buried himself in work “I’m sorry, I’m busy tonight, it’s an Auror case”
“I heard it” Hermione chuckled softly “Honestly, I’m not surprised since Draco got the same after-sex hair like Pansy”
Did you have a concussion when you fell down?” Pansy scoffed and started laughing, clapping her hands together “That’s funny, Draco”
?” Ginny added with a snicker before chugging on her wine “
“Wait, you’re
Pansy squealed, opening her arms wide and smiled when Draco sent death glares at her. How could she tricked him like this? But again, she was Pansy after all, he should have seen this coming. He could not believe this was happening right now
“Neville Longbottom, the shy one? Tall, wears striped sweaters all the time?” He said but all Theodore did was shaking his head “Gryffindor? Always at the Greenhouse? The one that killed Nagini?”
“Depends” She chewed on her lower lip, she was probably still torn between accepting it or not “Would you want anything in return?”
“No, not her” He shook his head, overhearing Ron’s mumbles about how he was tired of studying and smiling unconsciously “Are you interested in tutoring Ron Weasley?”
“What do you mean what? You always have the highest score in History” She said, ruffling his hair and giving his forehead a flick as he hissed “Did you actually lose your memory? I’m starting to think it’s true”
” Draco cupped Harry’s face to stop him from babbling, he couldn’t stop smiling “I want that, you hear me? I want all of that with you, from the small things to the big things, I want all the arguing and making up, I want everything, with you”
“Oh how I wish you could see yourself there” Draco mumbled so quietly that Blaise couldn’t hear. This won’t work, he needed another way to make them study together.
ruin your relationship with Harry here. Look, Draco” She tugged at his robes and looked up at him “You don’t know it, but Harry really loves you here, and you love him just as much. It’s already painful enough that you’re not telling him what happened, but now you’re hurting his feelings. Draco would never do this to him, he knows his Harry”
” Draco murmured the incantation, observing the way his magic healed Potter’s arm. As soon as it looked normal again, he let his wand down and touched Potter’s shoulder, getting a hiss from the Gryffindor “What? Are you still in pain?”
“No, I didn’t lose anything, don’t worry about it, I’m just tired, that’s all”
available” Pansy pointed out and Draco gave her a shocked look “What? You said you didn’t want to join, so Harry i-…”
Draco rolled his eyes at his boyfriend’s humour. One of the things he loved about Harry was that he always managed to make Draco smile, always, it was surreal.
Was this a sign? Draco leaned over, pulling at Pansy’s robes “Tell me everything”
“I think the box under your bed would like to disagree” His mother gave him a smile that somewhat looked almost like a smirk “Lastly, we are surprised you want to move in with Harry. But if it’s what makes you happy, you should do it”
“She got a point” Pansy spoke up, shrugging when the two Gryffindor looked at her “What? I know him, and she’s right, Draco’s brilliant”
“You’re sure you can guess?” He asked, he didn’t really believe Harry could know everything, moreover, he was the expressive type of person, Draco should be the one to guess. On the other hand, Harry might not understand the action he has to do do “Alright, I’ll act” He could feel Harry nodding and watched as Seamus and Padma standing up.
“Do you get this now?”
her?”
about this, he will never know about it”
“You don’t get it, we’re arch rivals!”
“Are you lost?”
” Draco yelped and cling on his neck “Still full of surprise, I see?”
“Me” Dean stepped up and said cheerfully
“Please, I’m a nervous wreck”
Draco asked for another cocktail when people were switching seats again, he wasn’t in his right mind right now. It was hard for him to look at Harry, it was harder to see him smiling with others
Ron gasped when the guy opened the door in, honestly he thought that the guy didn’t look like a normal stripper at all. If anything, he looked like a high class stripper who only do fancy performances and stuff, which he was. He wasn’t as tall as Ron, but his body was lean, wearing a Slytherin robes and even has his hood on, the robes was covering his whole body but Ron could hear the clicking sound of his heels on the floor, his long blond hair falling down his chest, the mask has covered his whole face so Ron couldn’t even really see what the guy looked like, just his eyes under the dark light of the room “A Slytherin uniform?”
. I’m so sorry” He grabbed the man’s arm and led him to a bench near the escalator “Okay, sit down, here, here”
sensitive, or useful in sex.
” Theo murmured, his heels digging on Neville’s back. He would do anything to always be Neville’s, this was both the worst and best day of his life, but the ‘worst’ part was slowly replaced with the ‘best’, now that Neville was fucking him deep, with every stroke that hit his prostate, he could come any second now. Theo squeezed Neville’s hands, and the Auror slammed in harder. It wasn’t fast and short like with other men he had been with, Neville was slow, soft, passionate and so, so

“Draco?”
“Oh, and er, do you think I…”
Pansy scoffed loudly, which made Draco rolled his eyes, he didn’t have feelings for Potter and he never had them, not that he ever noticed them “Not that I want to say this…but didn’t you have a wet dream about him once?”
“Why do you care? You abandoned him as soon as I arrived, I’m the only one he has now” Brandon smirked, turning around, Harry tried his best to hold back and not fight Brandon right now “Thanks to you, he’s sadder each day, and I’ll get in his trousers sooner or lat-
“Let me tell you something” He said, leaning to Potter’s side and whispered in his ear “
Draco snapped, his voice slightly raised, everyone on the table stared at them a bit before minding their own business again. Potter looked down, playing with the peas on his plate and sighed
tomorrow won’t work” Pansy whined and buried her face in Hermione’s hair
“Theo, Theo” He called and Theo looked up, their eyes locked yet he didn’t stop hollowing licking the Auror’s cock “Turn around”
“You kissed me”
“I’m glad my two students are getting along” She said softly “However, please keep your…
“Well, I suppose I was surprised, I knew it was coming, but still surprised” Draco replied “To see how happy Pansy really looked for the first time ever. Before the war, she was always influenced by her parents, telling her what to do, she almost had to marry Theo, they’re all Purebloods after all, but after the war, she was free to do whatever she wanted. She was better since then, but something was missing, I guess Hermione was what’s missing”
” Ron halted when a moan was heard from the bedroom.
“You were going to
“He isn’t your type, right?” Potter asked once the waitress was gone
easy, you know me. We just…made out a few times”
” He exclaimed when Harry started thrusting, he arched his back, pushing back when the Auror shoved in. Draco placed his arm on the wall and leaned his forehead on it, he was blabbering incoherent words every time Harry jammed in, his cock angled at just the exact spot, hitting that bundle of nerve and bringing Draco closer to climax
Brandon huffed out a breath when Harry grabbed his collar and pinned the guy against the wall.
“I don’t know, feels like it”
“This is
“Okay, okay” Pansy nodded, clearing her throat “Do you, Harry Potter, take Draco Malfoy to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
“Oh, yeah, I actually did it for you” Hermione replied “I know what you like”
“Yeah, he is, I’m sorry”
“Who’s that?”
He mumbled quietly and she nodded, he knew she loved him and only wanted the best for him. It has always been like that, she has always been his rock for over 17 years, she knew what she was doing, so he believed that she did this out of love “I know”
“Hey” Blaise approached them with Rose on his arms while she finished her dessert, Harry quickly put the ring box back in his pocket so they wouldn’t see “Ready to open?”
“Uncle Harry” Harry looked down and saw Rose tugging at his jacket, she was holding a stuffed dragon and still in her pyjamas, she was probably up from her afternoon nap
“I guess” Neville said, putting the glasses on the table, glancing at Theodore, who seemed like he was asleep already. Draco had also apologised to Neville, right after Ginny, Neville was hesitant as well, but he was easy to warm up to, so Draco thought he would say yes to this “What is it?”
“Don’t torment me” He murmured “You just feel glad because a guy like you for the first time, it disgusts you, right?”
“I just
“How do you know?” Pansy nudged him with her elbow, leaning her head on his shoulder “If you hate him there, how do you know how he will act when he likes you. What if he acts the same? You might not know this, but when Harry found out he likes you, Merlin, he was so helpless”
no” Harry stepped back and cleared his throat, looking at Professor Slughorn and then back at him “Are you wearing cologne?”
“So?”

“Okay, shut up” Ron blushed and covered the words written on Blaise’s shirt “It’s just…a

“Fine” Draco breathed out, looking at Potter again and meeting his eyes. There was that warm tingling feeling again, he cursed himself for feeling like this “What were you preparing?”
cling to you” Finnigan nodded like he has seen it many times before and got back to changing into his pyjamas
“Not really” Boot answered
” Harry heard Ginny groaning nearby but he was still confused. Did Draco like someone?
“Are you
“Really? You are friends with Blaise’s fiancé? Wow” Draco gaped, he never would have guessed they have so many connections and… “
“Who’s Brandon?” Ron poked Harry and asked again, putting his chef hat on the kitchen counter and leaned on it next to Harry, their shoulders barely touched “Oh, is it Draco’s new boyfriend?”
what she made for Hermione, and it’d be better if he never saw it
“Yes, Ginny, I got you your present” He said, smiling at her she squealed in delight. After all, it was the only present that was wrapped like a broom, the latest version that she loved and he had promised to buy it for her as a gift.
“Yes, actually, I have seen their auras since they came in, it’s glowing” Luna said softly “Glowing means they had sex”
“They are, Harry” Draco said, he has caught the couple snogging secretly in the Restricted Section in the library many times but it wasn’t his business to tell anyone. And based on the way Harry was still staring at him in shock, Harry has no clue about it “They’re just doing it in secret, they have been doing it since the beginning of the year. Everyone knows, how could you not know? You guys live in the same dorm with them. And they just kissed in there when the ceremony ended, didn’t you see?
“Hey”
“Do you?”
“You’re a beauty” Harry smiled and pressed a kiss on the blond’s forehead, Draco felt a blush creeping up his cheek and buried his face in Harry’s neck. Draco’s eyes widened when he remembered where they were again, in a pub, where their friends could come back any second now.
“That party is definitely going to be wild, Potter, everyone will be done with studying by then” He scoffed, two minutes left “And Pansy’s one of the people who host it, I’m sure it will be insane”
“I said that my husband looks better in that robes”
“What’s the big deal? Men do it all the time. Women do it all the time,
“I love you” He said softly to his mother as she tightened their hug.
“You did, yesterday. I saw you with my own eyes, you don’t have the flu, you never have the flu”
“Harry, tonight is Blaise and Ron’s opening, you
“You know why. Come on in, enjoy the party, Hermione’s in the kitchen if you want to see her, Pansy” Blaise said before dragging his spouse away
Harry sucked on his bottom lip, his tongue exploring Draco’s mouth while his hands found Draco’s face and he cupped it, warming the blond up. Harry smelled nice, like treacle tart and chocolates, just what Draco loved. He clutched on Harry’s hair, pushing deeper into the kiss.
“I didn’t mean to be late, I was…I was preparing something, for you”
“I’ll come with you” Draco shoved the letter in his robes and followed her. As he walked with her in the hall, it seemed quite different. The atmosphere was definitely different, people weren’t as joyful like in the other world, it was for many reasons anyway “Where’s Blaise by the way?”
Harry spoke, kissing his cheek again
“Nope” Pansy shook her head, she needed to make up more lies “Since you didn’t go to any parties for years, you probably don’t know but Ron refused to kiss anyone on New Year four years ago? So he ended up being kiss by everyone that night”
“Hey!” Ron waved at them as soon as he arrived at the table, Harry greeted them as well, but Draco didn’t care
“Maybe we should stop”
“Oh, Pansy, you’ve underestimated my ability to ‘
Harry to get it checked but his best mate wanted to
“You’re my everything” Harry said in a shuddering breath, his hands on Draco’s waist, holding him tightly before Draco’s knees threatened to fail him “I want you to meet them, I want them to love you” Draco realised he was crying as well, he pressed his forehead on Harry’s, hugging the boy close to him. There was nothing else to say, he loved Harry more he could every say.
“Oh, when I woke up I saw it in the nightstand” Haley said, showing her left hand, which has the ring that was supposed to be Draco’s on her ring finger “I hope it wasn’t anything special”
“He was stuttering, avoiding you, then he talked to Hermione and I, asking for our advice, he was a mess, he didn’t know how to act towards you anymore” She chuckled, hooking her arm around his “That’s when Anthony appeared, since he avoided you. Then he saw Anthony, getting all jealous, we told him to just confess to you, and he did, right at that Quidditch match. It took him just the right nudge to finally confess”
“So I did a good job then?” Harry teased, pulling Draco close to him “The
It felt the same,
“Do you feel dizzy?” He asked, touching on the place with no blood on his forehead, observing if Potter has any reaction to it “Headache, blurry vision, trouble walking, nausea?”
“Quit that” Ron said softly, pointing at the ashtray and Draco noticed Blaise hesitated for a second before putting the cigarette out, the one he just started smoking, the blond smirked to himself, Ron has
“Okay, fine” Harry groaned, feeling the wind blowing by when they finally got outside of the Ministry, he closed his eyes as he remembered that day “It was one time, twelve years ago, I bumped into Draco in a pub, we talked, we laughed, and we kinda had sex”
like it”
“I told you, Draco. Hermione has got this great friend—…”
“What are they like?”
“I’m sorry” He said, extending his arm to hold Theo’s hand, and Theo let him “I’m sorry, I don’t know how many times I should say it, I’m an idiot and I was wrong. I let other people affect my decision, fuck, I’m so stupid”
Harry licked the skin under Draco’s ear, making the blond shiver. He wasn’t sure when he got so filthy either, he was a virgin just three years ago for Merlin’s sake, now he was begging for Harry’s cock repeatedly “
“Yeah, I, I didn’t notice that before” Draco suddenly realised the words were different, this was a different mirror “I could never figure out what it meant”
times by accident “Come in”
” Harry grinned from ear to ear as Draco approached him, the blond stepped in between Harry’s open legs and locked his arms around Harry’s neck, his hands playing with Harry’s hair
” His voice softened up, the chocolate was in the shape of the Ravenclaw Tower looking from outside, he made it exactly like it, Draco stared at it and couldn’t stop smiling happily. He remembered…
“What’s wrong with him?”
“Because…because I thought you’d date him” Harry said, looking up at Draco again and pushed his glasses up “And, well, I thought if I could live with you, it’d be…nice”
“Yeah” Harry laughed dryly, his hand running through his messy hair “So, he confessed to you?”
hurts my eyes” Draco commented as soon as the Auror sat down
“Oh I can’t believe this” Draco kept fidgeting with his jacket and mumbled “I cannot lose this job, I just had an argument with my father yesterday and he said I could not keep a job for more than a day and I wanted to prove him wrong but well, now here I am, my first day and I did
“I want you” Harry pulled Draco down until their faces were centimetres away, their breath ghosting over each other, he could tell that Draco was nervous “Scared?”
Draco couldn’t say anything as Harry took a step forward “Why are you staring at the Mirror of Erised?”
As Sirius walked confidently down the path leading to the walkways that are framed by university buildings and fall accented trees. He could feel some of the appreciative glances shot his way by passersby, but he didn't spend the energy engaging, as most of them are probably his godson’s age and that’s just a no all around. At some point, he felt a buzz from the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out his phone. As he texted, he walked slowly forward, trying not to get in anyone’s way but not wanting to halt just yet
“I don’t really know what to say now,” Draco said, surprising himself, after more sugar and cream found its way to his stomach. Ron laughed around the spoon in his mouth before drawing it out.
“Okay, I’m ready to go,” Krum announced after giving Ron a hug goodbye and a quick kiss on the cheek. Cedric and Harry nodded and Cedric opened the door, sending a “goodnight” over his shoulder as he went. Krum followed him, smiling over at Ron and Draco and held the door open for Harry. Harry grinned over at his best friend and Draco, hefting the bag a little in some sort of solute - Draco wasn’t sure - said, “‘night boys!” and walked through the open door. Krum closed it behind them and then Draco and Ron were left alone in the common space that felt a bit too empty and quiet now that it was just the two of them.
Hermione answered “nothing” but Harry said “badly written books.” Ron grinned brightly at the two of them. There was a beat of silence before the same blond waiter brought Ron, Harry, and Krum mugs full of coffee, orange juice, and more coffee respectively, all balanced on a black plastic tray. They thanked him after he assured them their food would be coming soon.
“Okay, yeah, that would be nice,” Draco replied, “thank you.”
“I should have done that. Instead, I just took classes that looked interesting, both semesters last year.”
[to Hermy 6:03] k ill get us a table
“No,” Harry laughed, “Sorry you had to carry all of your stuff over. How’d you manage it anyway? Those bean-bags chairs are huge.”
Draco blushed, “it was.” He had almost wished he had not stopped what they were doing, but he was feeling like he might have let it get carried away, which he didn’t think he was ready for. There continued a pleasant buzzing feeling in his body, and he was so proud of himself for letting something so unexpected and nice to happen.
[to Pansy Parkinson 12:46] Can we skype sometime soon? Haven’t seen you in a while.
“That would be nice,” Hermione said kindly but didn’t have much else to add. Harry suddenly wondered if he maybe shouldn’t have invited Draco along. It wasn’t like they were dating or anything like that at all, and Draco was a new friend, so maybe it was a little weird to invite him over for something more family related.
“We’re having a movie marathon, we need all the sustenance we can get,” Cedric said seriously, patting Blaise heavily on the shoulder, “also, the left-overs are gonna be amazing!” Blaise laughed up him but raise a butterbeer bottle off the coffee table in mock salute.
The two of them walked toward the coffee house and neither said another word. Sirius wasn’t put off by this however, it didn’t feel like a bad silence. He took some time to consider the man he was walking next to - Remus clearly was closer to Sirius’ age than most of the people they passed, had a disheveled but elegant style, and radiated a comfortable air of authority. He was long and thin and taller than Sirius, but not by much, his curly mess of hair giving him some more height than Sirius suspected he had. Remus’ hands, clasped tightly around his disorganized pile of papers caught Sirius’ attention several times as he glazed over the man as they were spotted with ink and one pinky was painted a bright green. Sirius was completely charmed.
“Yeah, for sure,” Ron reassured him, and reached over to pat his bony knee, “and I’d like to get to know you better anyway, not just ‘cause we’re sharing a space. You seem cool enough.” He grinned teasingly at Draco who gave him a tentative grin back.
“Yeah I saw them when I added what I brought.” Draco replied and thought for a moment of how to phrase what he wanted to say next, not wanting to sound annoying or patronizing by wanting the space clean. “I’d really like to keep this space, maybe not completely clean, but orderly maybe?  We’re not children and we don’t need to make a chores list or something, but it would make me feel better if we both tried to keep things from getting too messy or anything.”
“Weird! But exciting!”
“Oh yeah, I forgot that’s something you haven’t done before.”
Draco’s class was that history of sexuality one with Harry, so he could most likely count on having someone to sit next to. It was taught by Dr. Remus J. Lupin who was relatively well known on campus - or at least within the humanities majors - for being a fantastic and understanding teacher. His ratemyprofessor granted him a 4.9/5, the red chili pepper of hotness (which Draco was sure people meant as a compliment, despite the creepiness of the rating), and a plethora of glowing, praise-filled comments. Draco had heard about him before and was intrigued to take a class with him. Harry being there was honestly just a wonderful bonus.
“He seems like a nice guy, all around, a bit anxious maybe.” Ron nodded at that.
“Blaise wants to know if we’re doing anything,” Hermione shared with the whole group.
Once they worked through the problems that Draco had marked, they reviewed the entire packet together, so that Draco could revise his previous work while Blaise pointed out things to him that he had done correctly or help correct the missteps that he had taken which he had thought were fine. All in all, it did not take too much time, as a lot of the concepts were intertwined and basic, but the act of reviewing and learning in such a focused way brought Draco to a point of ease with stat that he hadn’t felt before. He could feel himself becoming less and less tense the more he and Blaise talked.

“Yeah, seems like it. And her bag was amazing - have you seen it? Well I’m sure you have but it’s painted like an octopus and she offered to paint mine.”
“Yeah that makes sense, and it would be a really nice thing to do, in general, and we’ve mentioned it before. I think I should probably talk to Harry about his crush, though. It seems like maybe he’s more into Draco than we thought he was?”
“Nah, it’s ok, I don’t really care. I just thought it was weird.”
She laughed and then said, “Blaise and Luna are gonna join us. I saw them come in. They’re just gonna get some food and then head over.”
We hope that the time you have taken from your education has been fulfilling and gave you the space you required to return to your studies. After this coming semester, your ability to maintain a place at this school without taking classes will have run out and your spot will be given away to a transfer student on our waiting list.
“Oh, why?” Harry asked before jumping up and towards his computer, “I’m just gonna get some paper and a pen so that you can write things out instead of keeping it all in your head.”
[from Scarface 2:04] it scratched me when i went over to say hi can you believe that
After Krum finished unloading all of his bags and some of Cedric’s he came over with a butterbeer and a chocolate bar to Ron who wiggled to the side of the bean-bag so Krum could climb in with him. Ron moved so his head was resting on Krum shoulder and their legs tangled a bit in front of them. Krum kissed him in the side of the head and asked, “So what are we watching first?” He twisted off the cap of the butterbeer bottle and offered it to Ron who sipped at it happily.
“Oh,” Draco said, trying to get his thoughts in order, “well, yes, that was a bit forward and a bit presumptuous, but I don’t really mind. I just don’t really know how to respond. No one’s ever asked me like that before. It’s flattering, though shocking, to be honest.” Draco wondered if Blaise would still want to kiss him now that what he had understood as flirting had merely been Draco attempting to be friendly.
Blaise stood up as well and winked at him, “Anytime.” He leaned over and placed a soft kiss on the corner of Draco’s mouth before sauntering over to the door and holding it open for him.
“What are we fighting about this time?” he asked joyfully.
Ron looked rather proud at Draco’s words, “yeah, they’re a pretty good group of people, if I do say so myself.”
“We’re happy to know you,” Hermione said kindly, “and you can meet a few more of our friends if you come with us to dinner. You game?”
“No, I don’t have much in it yet. I was hoping to head over to Diagon Alley at some point in the next few days before school starts to get a few things, but I brought some things from home.” Draco thought about this small stash of food in his room, most of it came at the suggestions that Mr. Dobby made for him when they talked about the details of him moving out of the mansion. He had essentially put together a kit for Draco, full of all the necessary dorm-things that he would need, stuff he hadn’t even realized he needed until they were suggested. Draco had a sudden feeling of being out of place - taking a year and a half to not do school wasn’t that much time, but it seemed to be a long enough time for Draco to forget that he would require things like sponges and an umbrella.
“Hi Draco.”
“It was a few months after she started going to my school, in 10th grade. I think we dated for about a year maybe, probably a little less.”
Draco reread the letter three times, worrying the edges of the paper with his fingertips. His heart clenched and thumped loudly in his chest at this new information. It was something to think about that he had not even considered. He wondered if going back to school might help cure this apathetic attitude and listlessness that hindered his human experience this past summer.
[to Hermy 6:03] yeah but can he give us like 10 mins to talk tho?
Since Draco didn’t add anything to what Harry said, there was a beat of silence before Ron spoke up, “nice, that’s cool. So you’re a… sophomore?” Draco shifted a little at the question, feeling his insides twist at the question.
[from PP 2:17] i’m out with padma, lavender, and her boyfriend for dinner, not sure what the plans are after that, but ill let you know.
“Do you mean, that it made you question why you had been unhappy and apathetic for a year? Or bigger questions, like what you wanted to do with your life?”
[from Pansy Parkinson 12:54] goodnight [heart emoji]
“That would be so fun!” Hermione said after some chewing, “though I think you should talk to Draco before we get this ball rolling, to check in with him about this happening and find out if he thinks it might be something that could help him. If he thinks it might not, we can come up with a new plan.”
And Harry began to understand what his friend was unsure about. It was always scary to try new things even with people you loved and trusted. Ron was nervous about trying out a completely different sexual experience than he’d had before. Harry was a bit nervous in return that he couldn’t offer that much in the way of advice because while he had been a top in the penetrative sense, as well as a bottom, it was probably a bit different if you were a person who had a penis. He wondered if it would have been better for Ron to talk to Hermione or someone else with a vagina about this, but then felt bad for thinking those thoughts. He could and should be able to support his friend, even if their experiences were different. He blurted out the first thing that came to his mind “Oh, okay. So, what, you got a strapon or something?” He cringed a little at those words but Ron snorted.
[from Scarface 1:25] parents just left, told me to tell you they wish you a good semester lol
Draco heard the three people coming down the hall moments before Ron even opened the door. He finished putting one of his posters on the wall before getting down from his bed so he could leave his room and meet Ron’s friends. Ron seemed nice enough. He had been helpful with moving Draco’s things from the car and made sure he was okay with bringing strangers into their shared living space. Theo hadn’t been like that, he rarely said a word to Draco other than a random ‘hello’ every once in awhile. He hadn’t been all that messy but some of his things managed to get into weird places in their dorm - Draco was pretty sure that he still had a few of Theo’s shirts somewhere in his closet, just by accident. Like Draco had told Ms. McGonagall, his last roommate had been fine, not good or bad really. But the fact that Theo would put a sock on the door handle rather than just telling Draco he was going to have someone over was rather annoying.
“Who wants to share this with me?” He asked the room and Cedric happily took him up on the offer. Harry made a disappointed sound as he looked at his card and passed it to Ron before snapping the frog in half to hand over to Cedric.
“Cool, I’ll walk back to the car and drive over to your dorm. Want me to grab you anything on the way? I’m at, uh, Madam Puddifoot’s.”
“I love you too,” Ron said and smiled. They sat quietly, listening to the sound of their own breathing, holding each other. The mood in the air shifted gradually until Ron instructed Krum to take off his shirt. He brought his hands up to Krum’s neck again, his left thumb pressed lightly on his Adam’s apple. Then his hands slipped down to slide down his chest, his fingers feeling the lines of his muscles and pressing into them a bit. “You know,” Ron interjected as his right hand moved towards Krum’s left nipple. His index finger traced circles around the hardening flesh, “the nice thing about this new roommate arrangement…” Ron’s left hand moved to trace the skin right above the top of Krum’s pants. Krum kissed the next words out of Ron’s mouth, before he could say the things they were both thinking, but it didn’t last long. They were both impatient with want, having been teasing each other for the better part of the afternoon. They separated so they could remove the rest of their clothing without bumping into each other. After he was completely naked, Krum sat on the side of the bed and reached into the top drawer of the bedside table, hoping to find condoms, lube, and Ron’s vibrator, and was rewarded by finding exactly what he wanted, and something else.
“Ok, fifteen-minute break! Get some snacks, stretch, walk around, go to the bathroom. Then we’ll start again. Dean, glad to see you could make it.”
“No, thanks to you, I think I might actually understand that mess now,” Draco said as he pushed up from the ground and stood up, stretching his body. “Thank you, for the help and the, um, you know.”
Draco nodded again and then spoke up, “Yeah, yes. Um, but just kissing, if you don’t mind. I always like doing that, but I don’t think I’m ready to do anything else, you know.” he wasn’t sure he was comfortable sharing his body with anyone, let alone a platonic hook-up, but kissing was fun and easy. He figured he actually might enjoy doing a bit more than kissing, he had a faint interest in the idea of jerking Blasie off, by hand or by mouth, just to see how pretty and soft he would look post-orgasm, but he didn’t feel ready to express that, especially if he wasn’t interested in letting Blaise reciprocate. The imbalance seemed a bit too strange to negotiate at such a new and explorative experience, and he didn’t feel the need to bare all his insecurities just yet.
“Well, if you’re not a student, what do you do, besides chauffeur your grandson?”
“Wow,” he whispered against Blaise’s lips.
“I don’t know her all that well, actually, but we both recognized each other. It was nice to see a familiar face. Oh but to get back your question, other than the three I already mentioned, I also took an intro to gender and women’s studies, and western civilization 101. I actually think my first semester here was pretty normal. It feels like this one will be similar.”
“I just gotta make sure I talk to Ron before Draco talks to him, just so we’re all on the same page.”
Once in Madam Puddifoot’s, Sirius took Remus’ order as the man went to grab a table, heading over the counter to place both with the barista. It was short work and Sirius decided to add in a couple of chocolate croissants as well, hoping that Remus liked butter and chocolate.
“What?” Harry’s hands paused in their tangle of Ron’s short hair, “Don’t you two already fuck? Haven’t you been having sex for a while now?” He looked down at the top of Ron’s head with incredulity.
“I’m almost done,” the blond boy said over his shoulder as he arranged his shoes at the bottom of this closet.
“Yeah, can you guys let me up?” Blaise said through the phone; Hermione could hear movement and voices around him and she pictured him in the Prefect lobby, watching as other students rushed by.
“To be sure,” Krum agreed as he pulled some Hershey bars, a container of small chocolate chip cookies, and a box of brownies out of one of the bags. “Oh, and we got some butterbeer, too. We thought about getting actual beer, but we didn’t know what brands people would like, so we figured, we’d just go simple.”
“Yeah I kind of got that impression. I’m not really interested in anything concrete or beyond platonic, so I think we kind of matched up well in that regard. Does Blaise make out with anyone else in this group?”
“Um, well, I have a history of sexuality class, with Harry -” Harry grinned brightly at the mention, and Draco smiled back “- and I’m taking another history class, it’s an American one, covering the 1940s until now. Oh, and an intro to astronomy class, for the science requirement, but I’m kind of excited about it. Also Statistics, because math. Um, I enrolled in a creative writing and poetry class, but I might drop it if five classes is too much…” Blaise smirked a bit and leaned forward.
Ron chuckled, unsure as well, and offered him a smile, Draco found a smile for him as well and Ron said, “Thanks,” paused, and then added, “know that we know these things about each other, let’s finish the ice cream before it melts.” They two of them leaned forward with their spoons to dig at the container between them. Draco was glad for it, happy that Ron had trusted him with this knowledge and that he got to come out to his new friend without it being weird and strange. Ron seemed more relaxed, which was definitely a good thing, but Draco knew this wasn't and shouldn't be the last time they talked about these types of things.
“Dumbledore again,” he said to Harry, seeing his questioning glance. Harry groaned as well and grabbed a different box off the table. Draco looked between them confused. “What? You’ve never had a chocolate frog?” Ron asked, “ but they’ve been around for ages. Bill - my oldest brother, even has some from when he  went here.”
Two people named Blaise and Luna joined their table quickly, Luna sitting between Draco and Krum, Blaise between Hermione and Ron. There weren’t any more empty chairs and everyone sat evenly spaces, with the exception of Ron and Krum who never seemed to be able to extract themselves from each other. Draco noticed they even were sharing the same three plates and reached over each other to get to them.
“Of course,” Draco said, “thank you for telling me, though.” He would not have guessed it, but that spoke more to his general obliviousness than anything, he was familiar with how close Blaise and Hermione were.
“Cool,” Harry said and began to dig into his own meal.
As they slowly made their way around the room, the students twisted in their seats to look at people as they talked which was both nice and intimidating at the same time. Some people stumbled through their introductions while others powered through, seemingly used to doing things like this. Draco didn't really think he had anything to show for this summer and so when it was his turn to speak he mumbled out something about giving himself time to relax. He felt slightly undignified declaring his indecision in the case of his major, but was gratified to note that he wasn't the only one. He learned that Harry’s friend was named Oliver Woods and that Harry had gone to a Battle-of-the-Bands type event with Ron and Krum. Oliver’s fun summer fact was his engagement with a local soccer team and placing third in a small tournament. He was most likely one of Cedric’s friends, Draco figured, which was how Harry knew him. Draco’s assumptions were confirmed when he followed Harry and Oliver out of the classroom once Dr. Lupin dismissed the class after skimming quickly over the syllabus and asking if anyone had questions. There were a few, but they didn’t take long for him to answer
” Draco smiled at Ron’s emphasized words and agreed, quickly standing up again.
[from Scarface 2:14] Ron Ron
[to Hermy 6:15] got a table near front of main entrance and food
A few minutes later, a sinister looking woman emerged from the hallway that was previously used by the front desk man. She looked over at the waiting area and her eyes landed on Draco. “Draco Malfoy?” She asked.
Ron hummed around his spoon before saying, “yeah that would be awesome. Do you need help moving it?”
“Hey, Draco,” Blaise said, happily, spearing a tomato with his fork and popping it into his mouth, looking at Draco as he bit into it.
“Definitely not something to miss,” Hermione said, as she watched her friend viciously devour his lunch. She shook her head at the sight before taking more measured bites of her own.
She shook her head, “I think it’s ok, and he seems a bit lonely and unsure of himself sometimes, so I’m sure you inviting him was the right thing to do. Just maybe a bit early, since he’s so new to this group,” she played absently with a spoon in front of her, “and really the only people who ever join us at family things are significant others which isn’t very often anyway… But I don’t think you did the wrong thing! Maybe we can meet him halfway and not subject him to Ron’s avalanche of siblings, and all of our parents, like going to a show or something.”
Ron huffed out a semi-amused bread and said, “Well yeah, but like, I mean we’ve never done the Ron-is-on-top in a penetrative kinda way, you know?”
and he likes being intimate with them. So you, as a new friend, who is interesting and attractive, it makes sense to me that he would be interested in getting physically closer to you. He tends to kiss a lot of people, I’m not saying that in a bad way, but just so you know.”
Draco smiled over to him, “yeah, I think it’s going to be really interesting.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” he said, in a quiet but strong voice, “Mr. Malfoy, you need to wake up. You have an important meeting in an hour and a half.” Mr. Dobby poked Draco gently on the shoulder as he talked, “Mr. Malfoy, you were supposed to be awake twenty minutes ago… Mr. Mafoy, Mr. Malfoy,” and finally Draco began to stir, shifting the laptop along with his body. He murmured indistinguishably as he did so and Mr. Dobby smiled softly and allowed him a moment before continuing to wake Draco up.
They leaned away from each other a bit, to give each other some space to allow their breath to come more evenly. Blaise let go of his hand slowly.
“I can help you take back your chairs if you want,” Hermione volunteered and Blaise accepted gratefully.
“Well it’s a small school. I’m Hermione by the way and I use she/her pronouns, what are yours?” Hermione said, raising her hand so that Draco could shake it, “Why don’t you sit with come sit with us?”
“Yeah, no, I’d like to talk about stuff, I guess I’m just not sure how to begin.”
“For sure, and he’ll be coming with me and Mom and Hagrid to the Weasleys, for at least one meal. I mean I miss Molly’s cooking for a few months here and there, I can’t imagine not having it for a full year.”
For the rest of the meal, the group of five exchanged stories about their weeks and the projects they were working on. Cho was doing her thesis on competition and neo-liberal capitalism within organized sports and how that affected marginalized individuals and Harry was fascinated. He asked her all about her research and methods until Luna started pulling her away for some late night bowling. Cho, smiling lovingly at her datemate, asked for a moment so she could exchange contact info with Harry and, winking, told him to text her sometime.
[also, i have an on-again-off-again beta, so there might be some mistakes here and there, sorry]
“Wow is right,” Blaise smiled back. He pecked at Draco’s lips one more time before pulling back. Draco watched his eyes flick up and down his face, probably taking in his mussed hair and red, swollen lips. He took that as an invitation to look at Blaise’s face more closely as well, he truly was a beautiful man. “That was fun, thank you.” Draco reached a hand forward to Blaise’ chest, as if to even out the attention, but Blaise just captured it and held it softly within his own.
“Of course, and you can really talk to me about this kind of stuff anytime.”
“I guess I don’t actually need help, I just wanted to talk to someone about it other than Krum. I mean he’s my boyfriend so of course we talked and are talking about it. But like, I’ve never done something like this before! It’s a bit nerve wracking.” As he talked, Ron moved to lay on his back. His head lay in the space below Harry’s extended arm, and his his knees folded up so his feet were flat on the bed. Settled, he rest his hands on the flat of his abdomen and joined Harry’s observation of the ceiling.
Draco interjected, “I’m not sure of the kind of hours I’ll be keeping, just so you know. I haven’t been in college for a while and I want to keep up with my work.”
[to Pansy Parkinson 12:52] Sounds good, looking forward to hearing all about it
“Also, a huge amount of horrible deaths that just kind of happen, like how the queen-witch in Snow White died. Even if it’s for kids, Disney movies can be pretty dark,” Krum added to Hermione and tucked Ron a little closer to his body.
he thought to himself.
They chatted a small while about which songs they hoped Quidditch International were working on, before Hermione turned to her tablet and they both lapsed into quiet. Ron finished his lunch and bent down to grab his computer from his backpack. They typed away on their respective devices, every once in a while pausing to mention something that came to their minds and share a laugh. It was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon
“That would be really nice! And a better idea,” Hermione said, but not unkindly.
Draco said, “Yeah, a bit,” quietly.
“Yeah, that makes sense, and being on campus when it’s quiet is nice.” Harry mused and then answered the question, “I’m gonna go see my mom and step-dad for a few days and then spend the rest of it with Ron’s family. Hermione’ll probably join us at some point. And I wouldn’t put it past Krum to show up too, at least once.” He paused and glanced up at Draco’s eyes, ensuring his attention, “you’re more than welcome to come by as well - if you want a break from the monotony of campus. Ron’s parents love hosting people.”
“I’m just that strong” Blaise answered, flexing his muscles and wiggling his eyebrows. He then smirked over at Ron and put a finger to his lips. Ron grinned and turned to whisper loudly in Krum’s ear, “He had a friend help him.” He then looked back over to the rest of the group and asked if they were ready to start watching the movie. The resounding affirmations from everyone made it clear that they were, Ron pointed the remote and his computer on the coffee table for someone to finish setting it up the movie. Harry grabbed the remote and tapped at the computer for a moment before snatching two cookies and a cauldron cake for Hermione, and pressed play.
“...the only person who’s let me paint their bag is Neville. I think everyone else just thinks my paintings would be too eccentric for them, but I’d make sure they’d match people’s comfort levels, I don’t think they quite believe me though...,” Luna told him and he could understand why, but it made him a bit sad. He didn’t think he’s like to get a lot of attention and carrying around a bag painted in such a way would definitely get him noticed, but Luna seemed trustworthy and open, regardless of, and rather additional to, her whimsy. He chose not to say that, and instead informed her that he thought her bag was magnificent and would be honored to have something painted by her - though, perhaps, not his backpack.
“What have they done this time?” Hermione’s voice surprised Draco, he hadn’t realized she can come over to the table. She sat down on Harry’s other side. “We haven’t scared you away already have we?”
“True,” Blaise acknowledged after he dropped the other bean-bag chair and then pulled the lawn chair bag off his shoulders so he could open and unfold the chair inside. Ron took the bag and placed in under the coffee table so it wouldn’t get in the way. Harry and Hermione walked out of Draco’s room and sat on the couch, Blaise joined them. Ron made himself comfortable on one of the beanbags and smiled over to his friends.
“Oh that’s so nice, I was wondering how you knew her. I saw her around a bit last year, but I never knew who she was. Her hair is pretty noticeable”
Ron laughed and added, “we’ve tried to train him better, but you know… old dogs, new tricks, not a great match.” Harry scowled at his two friend, and swallowed loudly.
“Creevey was also a bit of a mess. He stayed up really late a lot, he’d let me turn out the light, but he wasn’t very quiet.”
. Seeing Draco struggle as the Midterms grew nearer made Harry’s heart hurt.
Hermione was intrigued by the list of classes Draco had decided to take. She was also a bit weirded out by the fact that Draco had begun to pull shoes from the bottom of the box with his eating items, but she resolved not to say anything. People packed their things in odd ways sometimes. Lavender had a thing about packing her dresses in the same place as her blankets and sheets which Hermione never understood.
“I helped Draco out with some stuff when he visited McGoogly earlier this summer,” Harry grinned and Hermione laughed a little at the name. Draco offered a small smile back, glad that Harry didn’t mention how he had needed help signing up for classes, he didn’t want to seem incompetent to these people he barely knew.
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy. What can I help you with?”
“-used it it, yeah I know, that’s what they’ve been telling him all night.” They both laughed a bit at that. “I’m sure he’s fine with it, I mean, I don’t know, but when I asked just now it didn’t seem like he minded all that much.”
Ron flashed him a tiny grin and said, “It’s silly really, and you probably don’t want to hear about mine and Krum’s sex life, but…” Ron trailed off and looked down as his lap, freckles bright.
Harry nodded, “again, same. I asked Draco what he was doing for his break and he didn’t seem sure, so I mentioned that we all kind of congregate at Ron’s. He said he'd talk to him and then maybe join us!”
“No, no, don’t apologize,” Draco tried to share what he was feeling, without further alienating the two of them, “look, I’d be happy to kiss you, I mean you are a very kissable person, do not get me wrong, because really, really you are. But I haven’t really done that in a long time and I’m not looking for a relationship or anything. I’m sorry if I lead you on, I didn’t mean to.” Draco was sure his cheeks were burned with embarrassment and shame at his own hesitant desire, where before they were inflamed with confusion, though he was glad for himself for getting his words out at least somewhat coherently. He looked down at his lap so that he didn’t have to look Blaise in the eyes.
“Oh, Luna, Blaise, um… Ron vaguely and sometimes you too.” Hermione bumped her shoulder with his for emphasis and smirked at him, “I don’t really think he notices that he does it actually, but you two definitely flirt a bit. Maybe if this thing with Cho doesn’t go anywhere, you could try more with Draco.”
[from BZ 2:17] anyone doing anything? just woke up and im bored.
“Oh yeah, sure” Hermione snorted and rolled her eyes. She checked her phone again when Parvati answered and noticed that Blaise had also sent her a message.
As the three of them made their way through Diagon Alley, Harry found his attention split between the two men he was with. Ron had a look on his face that Harry recognized as ‘I-need-to-talk-to-you-about-something-vaguely-uncomfortable-but-I’m-determined’ but he chose not to prod at his friend until they were alone. Draco on the other hand, Harry found rather fascinating. He was an enticing mix of nervous and proud (of what Harry wasn’t sure). The blond held himself with such grace and poise that the anxious twitches of his fingers and the flush of his cheeks seemed out of place. While it appeared that he knew what he wanted, he second guessed himself quite often, especially in a grocery store where there was very little to wonder about - other than the decorations and the floaty music that danced out of the speakers and into the shop.
“Can I kiss you?”
[deleted and reposted due to an error in formatting i noticed after it was posted (hope it's ok now)]
“Yeah it was,” Draco answered, tucking the blanket more firmly to his body and sat back down on the chair he had occupied earlier.
Harry perked up at that, “Maybe we could all go see Krum’s band!”
Hermione nodded along to Harry words. “Dean said something to me the other day about Seamus feeling the weight of the upcoming exams. Neville also - I was talking to him and Luna yesterday and we thought maybe getting a study group together to meet every day might be helpful. Having a bunch of people who all need to do work could be motivating.” Harry considered her words as she continued, “We’ve kind of been doing that the past few semesters, but maybe making it official in some way could create a productive atmosphere.”
That night, as he picked his way though General Tso’s chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce, Draco contemplated the life he was currently embarking on. His parents had died when Draco was just about to start his Spring semester of his Freshman year, a year and a half ago. He pulled himself out of school and took some time away from, well, everything. He found himself a few menial and mind-numbing part time jobs throughout the later progression of months to keep himself from dwelling too much on the reality of his life. At the beginning of this specific summer, however, he decided to quit his job and spent most of it moping around the house his family left behind. It wasn’t like Draco really needed the job, but it had been a nice thing to pass the time and find some sort of responsibility. The problem was that the job that he managed to acquire ended up boring him too much, which was why he quit in the first place. But it also had become tiresome to interact with customers and often Draco left his job feeling more uncomfortable than not in his own skin. In leaving his post, he created a situation that allowed him to be just as bored and uncomfortable, but in the privacy of his own home instead of at a commercial institution. That night, Draco didn’t so much fall asleep as he did melt into his bed and let his consciousness bleed away once he had finished his dinner, mostly because he couldn’t think of anything better to do. The next morning was a little different.
“Cedric said he’s finally completely unpacked and starving, so he’s on his way here,” he looked over at Draco and informed him that Cedric was his roommate and a soccer player. They had mostly finished eating and were on seconds of drinks by the time Cedric ordered and sat down with them, squeezing between Krum and Harry. Draco introduced himself and Cedric politely did so as well before turning his attention down his own meal, eating it a pace that made it seem like he was trying to catch up to everyone else. Hermione and Harry had gotten back into arguing over books again sometime during all of this and Draco elected to simply sip his coffee and listen.
“Moms are like that I suppose.” Sirius wouldn’t know, however, as his mom had never been proud of anything he did and had cut him off when he turned 16 - but now was not the time, especially when he was getting to know this new lovely man that he definitely wanted to spend more time with. Remus nodded sagely at his words and took a rather enormous bite from his croissant. Sirius, not sure what else to say, mimicked him and they chewed in happy silence for a moment.
She grinned at him when she noticed him looking and said, “I know someone else who’s taking an astronomy class. Maybe you’ll be in the same one.”
Ron let her trail off and then replied, “Oh, I wish he had asked me first? But I guess I wouldn’t have minded…?” He looks at her a bit helplessly, before fishing out a piece of cantaloupe from his fruit cup.
“Don’t make fun of me, okay?” She pleaded jokingly when he smiled, “I just like ending the summer with stupid, easy to read mysteries with ridiculous plot holes and conspiracy theories! It makes it easier to start reading all the academic stuff we’ll get assigned soon enough.”
“Well, math and science, like I said. I took an ancient mythology class which was pretty interesting,”
“Cool,” Ron said and Harry nodded, his cheeks full to bursting and looking a bit like a chipmunk to Draco.
“It’s okay with me,” Draco assured him.
By the time it was Midterms, Harry was pretty confident in his new friendship with Draco. There were a lot of things about each other that they did not know and so many boundaries between them that only needed time to fade away, but none of that was bad, it felt good, and it left a lot of room for them to grow into their relationship. Draco, however, did not seem to be very confident about anything at present. Whereas Harry often thought of himself as an average student, he managed to be quite good at time management and diligently working through stress rather than succumbing to it. His new friend, on the other hand, seemed to drown a bit under the stress of due dates and large graded assignments. Draco’s time managing skills were decent when he had encouragement of others and felt passionately about the work that he had to do, but due to anxiety that often felt crippling and assignments that either were too important to him or not important enough, those skills did not matter - Draco could plan all he wanted, but it was really difficult for him to just
[to PP 2:14] Thanks for letting me know! I’ll be back after dinner probably, if you want to watch another episode of Shameless.
“A few,” Draco answered, standing up from where he was kneeling with his clothes to sort out the mess that he left on his desk, “I mean I’ve only completed one semester here so far. I did a math class and a science class to start to get some of those gen-eds out of the way. I’m still taking one of each this semester to finish them up.”
On their way over, Ron asked, “So what do you think?”
“I think it was a spur of the moment kind of ask, he didn’t seem to have really thought about the implications of that, especially to our parents,” Hermione reassured. “I mean he knows the two of them aren’t in a relationship or anything beyond friendship - though I think we know he might want to be. He just didn’t want Draco to be alone over break.” Ron nodded in understanding. “We thought maybe we could try to meet Draco another way, like to see Quidditch International play a set, you know?”
Ron was surprised, he never heard of anyone getting a librarian card before. Once, Luna got a chocolate frog and with it, Argus Filch’s (the head of Maintenance) card and that had seemed pretty rare until she found out that Terry Boot, who was a fellow student of hers in one of her courses, also had a Filch card. He said this to Draco and Harry nodded along with his words. Slightly wide-eyed, Draco placed Pince’s card next to Dumbledore and took a bite of the chocolate frog’s head. Harry picked up the card to look over it himself before replacing it and grabbing the third, and last, box from the table.
“Ran into Blaise and I invited him to join us. Hope that’s ok,” Harry told him.
“I can go with you tomorrow if you want,” Ron proposed, bringing Draco out of his thoughts, “Mom left me with a lot of food, but it’d be nice to check it out anyway. Maybe Hermione can join us, she mentioned wanted to get groceries the other day I think…”
“Yeah basically.”
Draco was honestly rather shocked that he had landed a roommate that was so nice. He hoped Pansy wouldn’t make fun of him for it the next time they skyped. He hadn’t seen her in a long time, but they managed to keep in contact while she was away at college and she knew how anti-social he had become after his parents' death and always pushed at him to try to make friends at his workplace. Over the last year and a half, he had seen her only when she came home for breaks and their visits were short and infrequent. But Pansy kept him up to date with all the gossip and news from the various families that they had grown up with and she shared with him her the dramas at university. Draco realized he hadn’t seen her during the summer and wondered angrily at himself for not noticing until they were both away at college. They had made tentative plans when she returned to her own family’s estate in May to get together at a local coffee shop, but he had let his aching anxiety and subsequent inability to pull himself out of pseudo-laziness get the better of him and they had not managed to make it happen in the end.
“Yeah” he said and Krum wiggled down his body faster than he had the last time. He pressed kisses into Ron’s thighs before placing his hands where he wanted them. As Krum let one of his fingers dip into him, he moved it slowly and gently. His other hand reached for the bottle of lubricant that had slipped onto the floor when they removed the blanket. He uncapped it and took his finger out of Ron’s body so he could coat it in lube.
“Definitely, but not in a bad way,” Draco said and then moved over to his second to last box, pulling out a water heater, some non-perishable food, and plastic eating utensils. “The barista at Puddifoot’s, Tonks, she was in that class with me two years ago.”
Harry and Hermione moved to sit on the couch which wasn’t a very big or comfy one so  Ron went to his room and pulled out one of the folding chairs his dad left him. He sat down on the other side of the coffee table. He was about to ask the two about their summers when Draco emerged from his room.
“Good. I’m glad Mr. Potter was a resource for you.” She said as turned towards her desktop computer, “I have already granted you access to complete the final step in the online portal so you can officially enroll in your classes.” Draco nodded at those words and followed her instructions, clicking the buttons on the screen in front of him to complete the process. When it was done, he looked up at her. She was leaning across the desk with his cookie jar open and an expectant look in her eyes. “Take a cookie, Mr. Malfoy.”
Blaise smiled over at him, and he smiled in return. He reached over and touched lightly at Draco’s chin, tilting his head up so that he was able to look at his face. Draco let him, feeling warm inside at Blaise’s kind words and gentle hand. He looked into the brilliant eyes of his friend and again thought over what he said. This whole conversation felt so abrupt and unlike any other that Draco had had, but Blaise seemed so overwhelmingly genuine. And he really was totally kissable. He gave himself a moment to take in the earnestness that was written on Blaise’s face and let the idea sink in. He let himself relax a little and then nodded slowly. Blaise smirked slightly, but said gently, “does that mean that I can?”
“Makes sense. How many times have you read that one?”
“Oh, I was wondering why you looked familiar. But you used to have purple hair, right? That was a good class,” Draco thought back to the ancient mythology class he attended freshman year and added as an afterthought, “Malfoy is my last name by the way, Draco’s my first. What was yours again?”
“Mr. Dobby!” Draco called over his shoulder, to the general area where he assumed he would be. “Do you mind coming here for a moment, I have a question!” Mr. Dobby came a few moments later, looking a bit out of breath and actually surprised to be acknowledged.
“You eat like this too, you idiot, you just restrain yourself when your boyfriend is around,” He bit back, smirking at his friend, “‘specially when we order in Chinese food.”
Ms. McGonagall had called a few days after their meeting. She informed him that moving in day for returning students was September first and of the rooming arrangements she had been able to arrange for him. He would get a pseudo-single in Prefect Hall (where mostly upperclassmen lived), meaning he would have his own room but one that was attached to another person’s room with a bathroom to share. He would have his own sleeping space but not his own living space, which was disappointing but decidedly acceptable. He hadn’t expected to get any kind of single and he tried to count himself as lucky. Ms. McGonagall assured him that it was a good option and that the person he was paired with would most likely be someone he could get along with. She also told him that she was sending an email with everything she had just shared and more logistical information for the moving in day, but he could call again if he had any questions.
“No worries,” Hermione assured him, smiling at the newcomers. She looked over at Cho and introduced herself and Harry along with their pronouns. Cho returned the gesture with her own name and pronouns, throwing in her major and class year as an added measure. It turned out she was a senior - older than all of them, including Draco. She and Luna had been platonically dating throughout the semester so far and they had decided maybe it was time for her to meet the rest of Luna’s friends.
* * *
“Yes, I would like that as well. Here, give me your phone, I’ll plug in my number,” Sirius handed it over, delighted, and Remus thumbed at it quickly, “I texted myself so I’ll have yours as well.”
“Yeah that class was really cool, I took it last fall semester!” Hermione interrupted and Draco smiled. “Trelawney was kind of eccentric, though”
Draco was taken aback by the question and merely shook his head, weirded out that she would offer him a cookie in the first place. Ms. McGonagall seemed to notice his surprise and her eyes crinkled in a way that seemed like she was hiding a smile.
When Ron said he had friends coming over, Draco hadn’t entertained the idea that he would recognize any of them, but the moment he stepped out of his room to say hello, his eyes landed on the curly haired boy - Harry - who had helped him out at the administration building.
“See you soon, Sirius!” Remus lifted a delicate hand in farewell.
It was late when the last movie, X-Men, ended and Cedric stood up and stretched. Draco watched as his shirt rode up on his stomach, exposing the lower portion of his abdomen and the light dusting of his happy trail. Cedric smiled at him when he caught him looking before asking Krum if he wanted to call it a night and walk back their dorm with him. Blaise stood up as well, tossing a small now-empty container of ice-cream into the trash bag the group had slowly been filling the past bunch of hours.
They walked back to the original study room and rejoined their friends just as they began the next, and last, study break. Harry smiled, a bit knowingly, at Draco and the hickeys that were beginning to form as he sat back down in his chair. Draco didn’t let himself dwell on it too much. He chose not to say anything, but return to his flashcards once more. He really needed to process this development - not in a bad way, he had never done this kind of thing before with friends with this much intentionality. But maybe, in this group of friends, platonic kissing was a normal thing. He didn’t think Blaise would have been this forward with him if it wasn’t an established kind of thing in some way. Draco definitely didn’t mind it. He wondered if that meant that more people were randomly making out with each other. Was Harry? And what about Ron and Krum - did they ever let someone else into their relationship? Now that he thought about it, if his own interactions could be understood as flirting, there was a fair amount of it that everyone seemed to engage in. He hadn’t thought anything more of it before, but thinking back on his own conversations and those he had seen around him... He wondered about Tonks and if it was possible they had been flirting too, even when he didn’t know it.
“I’m Draco and I also use he/him,” Draco said, “it’s nice to meet you.” He looked around out the four people in the room, “it’s nice to meet all of you, honestly. It’ll be nice to start the semester knowing some people.” Especially people who didn’t seem like assholes and were surprisingly (to Draco at least) somewhat gender inclusive. He hadn’t ever shared his pgps outside of a classroom environment, admittedly only one class, and it was interesting to see it normalized to the degree of everyday conversation.
Draco, with his hair damp and newly adorned clothes neatly situated on his body, sat on his bed with a breakfast bar and his travel mug of freshly made tea, and mentally prepared himself for class. The hour-long class was easy to sit through and it was a fairly short walk to and from his dorm. When he returned to his room, he leaned back on his cushions as he scrolled through his emails, waiting for Pansy’s facetime invite to come through. He knew she might be late but did not mind in the slightest - it wasn’t as if he had anything pressing to do anyway and he was looking forward to their conversation. Just as he was about to leave his email behind and check on a blog he liked to keep updated with, a notification came in from Pansy, and he clicked to that instead. It took a moment for the screen to change and his own camera to work, so he adjusted his position and fiddled slightly with his drying hair.
[from Scarface 2:04] hows the new guy? better than creevs i hope
Packing up his belongings did not take Draco as long as he thought it would. Mr. Dobby helped by retrieving suitcases from somewhere Draco didn’t know and by quietly bringing items to him that were scattered around the mansion. They had discussed whether or not to close the mansion while Draco was away and decided against it. It would be good for Draco to have somewhere to go if he needed space, especially since he hadn’t been able to get the housing  he wanted, and Mr. Dobby was not inclined to find another place to live.
Draco took the card from the box and flipped it over to read the back. “It’s one of the librarians, Irma Pince. I remember her. She was rather unpleasant.”
Ron watched as his friends debated over movies and then as Draco emerged from his room and joined in on the conversation as he sat down on one of Ron’s chairs. Ron was happy to watch any of the options his friends were discussing so he let them chose and he nodded his head every once in awhile. After they finally decided to start with Pirates of the Caribbean because that was an easy choice and then probably move on to Deadpool or Empire Records, depending on how they were feeling, Ron got a text from Krum telling him that he and Cedric had come. It was Harry who went down to get them this time because Ron was comfy in his bean-bag and didn’t want to go back down again. Hermione started popping the popcorn in Ron’s microwave and Draco looked over at Ron. It seemed like there was something Draco wanted to ask him, like there was a question on the tip of his tongue he wasn’t ready to let go of. But the blond didn’t say anything and just let his face soften into a polite, blank kind of face.
At first, he wasn’t sure what he could do to help, but he wanted to show Draco how important their friendship was to him and also that he could provide emotional support for the duration of Midterms, as well as all the rest of them (and Finals) to come. After a particularly short study session with Draco in the library, in which Draco expressed his nerves for an upcoming paper he had due for an American history class with a professor Harry had never had before, Harry made a decision - to go to Hermione for advice. She was usually good at coming up with ideas and had a lot of tools for being a supportive, sympathetic, and empathetic friend and Harry trusted her with basically anything.
“That zombie comedy show with Drew Barrymore, it’s actually amazing! I just got to the middle of the second season.” Ron explained as he reached his doorframe, picked up his backpack, and turned back to face Draco.
They were in an odd position on the bed, with Ron lying down fully on it a bit sideways, the pillows and blankets mostly still in place, and Krum somehow half on the bed, half kneeling on the floor as he continued his descent. He smiled into Ron’s hip as he noticed this and then pushed his legs straighter so he could get back on the bed. Krum moved between Ron’s legs, folding his own under him, and placed each of his hands on one of Ron’s hips. He trailed his fingers along the skin, along the tops of Ron’s legs, moving closer and closer to the warm, soon-to-be-if-not-already wet v between them. He flicked his eyes up to meet Ron’s and sent him a silent question, making sure it was ok for him to proceed.
Mr. Dobby took a moment to read it before saying, “Mr. Malfoy, this isn’t a decision I can help you make, but I can help you figure out the logistics once you make one for yourself.”
“Well they sounded pretty interesting when you described them last night. I’m mostly taking gen-eds this semester to get them out of the way since I have a better idea now what I want to be studying in the long run.” Hermione watched as Draco re-folded the last of his clothes from his suitcase into the bottom-most drawer of his dresser. “Do you have many gen-eds left?”
“Tell her I say ‘Hi!’” Harry said, which Draco delighted in Harry’s casual extension of friendship. He supposed he had mentioned Pansy quite often to his new group of friends, so much so that he didn’t need to clarify who she was anymore. He knew she enjoyed her tiny pocket of recognition. “I’m so lucky my study group came with me to Uni, otherwise I don’t know what I’d do.” Harry shook his head at the thought. “But yeah, I think it’ll be fun and everything, Hermione has
Before he could say anything else though, Harry said, “Yeah, um, and you’re Draco. Nice to see you again, man!”
“I was thinking The Dark Knight would be nice because Heath Ledger, but then also 10 Things I Hate About You for the same reason,” Harry said. Draco inclined his head in agreement. “But those would be fun and Ron said something about Zoolander. I’d rather not watch tv shows, though.” Hermione reached over and patted Harry’s hand which had begun to fidget with Draco’s blanket.
” Harry’s voice was loud, speaking above what sounded like the general clamour of mass student exodus from a large room.

“Um well, actually I think I’m still technically a freshman,” he somehow managed to choke out conversationally, “I did a semester here two years ago, but then I took some time of.”
“You two are ridiculous,” Krum said before reaching over to Ron and kissing him lightly on the cheek. “They’re always like this, Draco.”
“Yeah, too many options though,” Draco answered before realizing he hadn’t gotten utensils. He asked the couple where to find the silverware, and then went off in the direction they pointed him in to retrieve them. As he walked back, Harry came up and walked with him. They smiled politely at each other and walked in silence to the table. Harry sat next to Draco, directly across from Ron, and began shoveling food into his mouth. Draco stared at him for moment, before looking down at his own plate and beginning to eat.
Hermione let her thoughts drift away as they entered into Prefect Hall. She didn’t think that anyone had minded her being lost in her own world as they walked from Puddifoots to here. They probably hadn’t noticed, as the three boys were now busy trying to figure out which movie to start with.
“Wait, you two know each other?” Ron asked, looking between the two men. Draco stepped forward towards the sitting friends, “cool.”
Throughout the chocolate-frog conversation, Hermione and Blaise had turned on the closed captioning of the movie and were commenting to each other about what was happening. Ron glanced down at Rowena Ravenclaw smiling up at him from the card and shared an annoyed look with Harry. He tossed it to where the other two cards lay and then settled back against Krum, who took a bite out of the frog when Ron offered, to watch Deadpool.
“Not yet. I looked over the textbook list once you helped me chose the classes,” he answered, looking out in front of them, noticing the buildings and people around them, “but I remember what it was like when I was here a while ago, so I figured I would wait until classes start to see what the professors actually want from us.”
Krum leaned down a placed a dry kiss on Ron’s belly button again, “sure, baby.” His hand was now flat against Ron’s center, finger-tips teasingly tapping lightly on the hardening nub. “Is this still ok?”
“Oh,” Draco said, not knowing what else to say, “that’s cool that you got to go to university with people you already knew.” Hermione smiled and finished her cake, using her finger to make sure she got all of the icecream and crumbs.
“That makes sense. I hadn’t really considered the price of the books before, I forgot how expensive they would be. What’s the site you use?”
When Draco finally set his packet and calculator aside, they continued to chat, Blaise’s deep voice filling the room with its warmth and friendliness. Draco appreciated this balance, enjoying the company and the ease of it all. They were fairly close, Blaise’s body right up next to Draco’s, familiar lines of comfort between them, and Draco couldn’t stop looking at Blaise’s hands, which he used expressively as he talked, they were so strong and big. He was fairly taken aback when Blaise cut off what he was saying to ask,
Neither of them seemed to know exactly what to say next, Ron knew that Draco had something on his mind that he had been wanting to talk through, but really did not want to push him or presume the subject. He thought it might have to do with the Fall Break thing, but Harry assured him that his and Draco’s conversation the other day had gone pretty well and they were all looking forward to hanging out for a bit during their time away.
Hermione asked, “Do they have another gig lined up?”
“Give us a second,” Ron said standing up and looking down at his boyfriend, “I have a present for you, remember?” Krum nodded and pushed himself off the floor. The two of them walked to Ron’s room and shut the door behind them. Draco got up as well to get his phone and wallet from where he left them on his desk. He looked over at the unmade bed with posters laying on top of it and the boxes scattered around his room. He sighed as he realized he probably wouldn’t have the energy to deal with all of it that night and resolved to have it all unpacked by tomorrow evening, even if he wanted to spend time with these new people.
Having been given the all-clear, Ron had practically flung himself into Krum’s lap, much to his boyfriend’s amusement. They ended up sharing a packet of gummy worms while chatting quietly to Cedric, who had thrown his pen down and cracked his knuckles in front of him dramatically, releasing some of the tension in his tendons. He nodded at something Krum said and Ron grinned widely. Luna had chosen to continue her studies instead of taking a break, and Dean had started laying out his own study materials in the small table space left. Seamus, instead, had dropped his bag on the ground and bounded over to Blaise to talk enthusiastically at him about a new bar someone had told him about. They agreed to check it out over the weekend.
Draco spent the rest of the day watching Netflix to take his mind off of what was to come. He ended up making an enormous amount of popcorn for himself and resolvded to stay in the small movie theater in the basement of the Manor until it was all gone. (It was a room Draco designed while tired at work one day and later managed to convince himself it wasn’t a ridiculous use of the money left for him by his dead parents.) Draco rarely used the movie theater room until now, however, as it usually provided him with feelings of excitement or passion, which very often was too over stimulating for such a bored and listless person. Draco made sure not to forget its existence though, merely choosing to avoid it. He still felt like it was a bit an inconsiderate choice that he made with his inheritance.
“Yeah,” Hermione interjected, “Parvati’s twin, Padma. She’s really looking forward to it.”
“Sounds good and let’s do that for the common area too, just like keeping it as non-messy as possible.” Ron allowed, and Draco felt a tiny bit of tension in his shoulders slip away. It seemed like Ron wasn’t put off by Draco’s want to keep their dorm tidy. He added, “tonight was good with the trash bag and everything, it really wasn’t that bad at all,” to which Draco inclined his head in agreement and reached out to spoon another mouthful of ice-cream from the container in between of them.
“Do you wanna come to lunch with us?” He asked. Draco felt a small jolt of shock rocket through his stomach -  he hadn’t been expecting Ron or his friends to go out of their way to include him in their activities. He nodded quickly, despite his surprise.
“We’ll figure it out! Or we’ll just have a stupidly long movie marathon. Either way, we can order in food or something.”
Startled, Draco complied and took one. As he bit into it, he remembered one of the questions that he had forgotten. “I remembered one of the questions that I wanted to ask you!” He said and Ms. McGonagall inclined her head in a manner that told him to share his thought. He chewed his bite and swallowed before asking “Do I need to get a dorm on campus? I, uh, I, have a house already. It’s not too far away, but I was just wondering about that.”
“Well, maybe not the average student age, but there are all kinds of students here. It's a fair question.”
“Maybe I shouldn’t have,” Harry thought out loud, and Hermione seemed to understand what he wasn’t making explicit.
“Don’t - um, don’t use your mouth tonight, though, love, just your fingers okay?”
It took Ron and Krum a few moments to untangle themselves, Draco noticed and thought it was very endearing. As the day passed, Draco felt more and more comfortable with this group of people, letting himself curl up on his chair in a very un-Malfoy-ish way, with his knees drawn up to his chest so his entire body was on the seat and under the blanket he pulled out of his room during the second movie. His blanket had kept him warm and cozy when he shifted under it every so often, but he certainly hadn’t felt as comfy as Ron and Krum had, cuddled up together sharing body heat. Even Harry, Hermione, and Blaise managed to make a notably uncomfortable couch warm and welcoming. Draco and Cedric had been the only one without people to share space with, which didn’t seem to phase Cedric in the slightest as he burrowed into Blaise’s bean bag chair. Draco didn’t let this phase him either. In fact, he had had quite a fantastic night by all standards - with good food and good company and fun, silly movies to enjoy. But he as he watched his new friends beginning to move around the room, eat little snacks here and there as they cleared the garbage and tried to return the room back to its original space, he couldn’t help but feel exhausted. It was a good kind of tired, though, not like the empty tiredness that had plagued him throughout the summer. It seeped in his bones in a very different way, heavy, but not debilitating. Draco unfolded his body from his chair and wrapped the blanket around his shoulders, not wanting to part from it. He collected a few wrappers and the chocolate frog boxes into the trash bag that Cedric passed to him.

“It’s ok, I do that too, or at least I try to,” he assured her, paused for a moment and said pointedly, “but with better books.” She rolled her eyes and swatted him playfully on the shoulder.
“I didn’t know you were in my Stat class though. You didn’t say anything at dinner the other night,” Draco added as they walked through campus, he wasn’t sure where Luna was going, but he didn’t mind trailing along with her since he had so much time before his next class. He was content to walk with her for a bit until she got where she was going.
“I think I’m going to head out, too,” he said, yawning widely as Krum nodded to Cedric.
The two friends lapsed into a calm silence; Harry reached for his phone laying facedown on the table to text Draco to see when he had time to talk. As they exchanged messages, Harry considered how dark Draco’s lovebites would look as they matured. He thought about how delicate they would make his neck, how inviting. He thought of what it might be like to add to the collection, to pepper his skin with more bruises, what kind of sounds Draco might make, the way he might flush at the attention. Hermione setting her coffee cup back on the table after taking a sip jolted him out of these thoughts, but they still lingered and danced at the back of his mind. He reached for his own mug and took a small sip of it.
thing or a
“One minute,” he said loudly in the direction of the door as he slipped a shirt on and then proceeded to stumble across the small room to open it. Ron stood in the doorframe, his day clothes and smile making Draco self-conscious of his disorderly appearance.
The first week of classes went by in a blur for Draco. His first class, intro to Statistics, was at ten o’clock on Monday and taught by Professor Vector. She seemed like a nice enough teacher, if a bit strict, but Hermione had high praise for the class and its teacher, so Draco wasn’t that worried. The three-page syllabus she had asked everyone to print out and bring to class - which maybe only about a third of the class actually did - was succinct and to the point. Vector went over it in a timely and efficient manner before ending the class and allowing the students to leave early, reminding them of the online assessment they needed to complete by their next class, on Wednesday.
Pansy came on screen looking as polished and beautiful as ever, a full face of makeup and grace that he so much appreciated. Of course, they had not always gotten along, but he didn’t ever think he’d tire of looking at her face, made-up or not, the symmetry of it and the clearness of it and the way it was able to hide and control her emotions so completely. He let his eyes move over the image of her face on his screen for a second before offering a small smile and raising his hand in greeting. She returned it and asked him how his first week was.
“We literally have been flirting for at least a month - or at least I used to think we were,” Blaise said, “but I mean, you’re half right, I am bi, so there is a small part of me that is straight, I guess, if you want to think about it that way. I’m actually crushing on a girl right now, so...”
“It’s Dan Brown, actually, and you really shouldn't be judging
They watched quietly as the first scene of the movie unfolded, grinning to each other a little when Elizabeth Swan sang the creepy pirates song and later when Will Turner introduced himself. The first person who spoke was Blaise, though, after the flashback saying,
“And, listen,” Ron continued, “I don’t want you to feel like you have to tell me something, just because I’ve noticed you have something on your mind. But I’d like to hear what’s going on and what’s been tugging at you.”
“You just didn’t do well because you didn’t ask for help. It was easy, really.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have a friend like that - Pansy - I think I told you guys about her. Our parents were close so we were often placed in the care of the same babysitter when we were young and they went to parties and functions and all that.”
“Yeah, of course. I don’t really wanna try something new right now anyway,” Ron said and then moved back onto the bed fully, pulling at Krum’s arm as he did, “just wanna keep it on the table.”
“Pirates of the Caribbean,” Harry exclaimed as he accepted a bag of newly-popped popcorn from Hermione. She passed one over for Ron and Krum to share, one to Blaise who was still sitting next to Harry, one to Draco who was on one of Ron’s chairs, and one to Cedric who deposited himself the other bean-bag after putting a few things in Ron’s fridge. Ron watched as she wedged herself between Harry and Blaise who said,
“I definitely have an inkling of what went on,” He gave Draco a happy look, “you have some very pretty hickies to prove it, but why don’t you tell me what happened and what’s been on your mind about it?”
“I’m excited to see Quidditch International with you all over break,” he ventured after a little while.
“No, I don’t have any other questions,” Draco replied slowly before reaching up to the open jar and taking another cookie. “Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to me. This has been very helpful.”
“Oh, I didn’t know that! I guess I haven’t talked to her in a while. That’s nice.”
As they all started to make their way over to the door to leave, Hermione watched as Draco went and said goodbye to Tonks himself. She was surprised to see that he seemed more sure of himself around her, she hadn’t realized that they knew each other. Not that she knew Tonks at all really. Hermione noticed that Harry was observing their interaction as well. Ron and Krum shared a quick hug and kiss before their two groups split up outside Madam Puddifoot’s.
The walk to the dorms was pleasant. With Krum and Cedric gone, Ron engaged more with her and the two other boys, keeping a flow of conversation between them easy and constant. Ron managed to get Draco to open up more about himself. They learned that Draco’s parents had sent him to a private high school in New York with a ridiculously fancy French name, Baeuxbaton, that sounded really impressive. Hermione figured this meant that he came from money and perhaps the reason his name sounded familiar was because his family had some kind of social standing that afforded them fame. He didn’t talk about them specifically or what they did, so she couldn’t be sure, however. The only reason they had gotten to the topic of high schools was because Ron mentioned that he took Hermione to senior prom in high school and Draco shared his own prom experience with his friend Pansy, who was going to college in the south.
“Oh, hi, Harry, right?” He said a little louder than he meant to, and his face felt a rush of heat. He realized that he hadn’t acknowledged his roommate or the girl sitting on the couch next to Harry.
[from KnowItAll 2:03] Harry just found me and we’re on the way over. :)
Draco, having taken the carton and was spooning the last of the ice cream into his mouth, just inclined his head to show that he heard and gave himself a moment to swallow before telling Ron that he understood and would try as well, “it shouldn’t be that hard, right?”
“Yeah, see you.” Draco said, and waved awkwardly over his shoulder, before heading through the glass doors to the outside world, taking a second bite out of the soft chocolate chip cookie as he did.
“Well, Nightmare Before Christmas and The Black Cauldron seem to have just as much, if not more dead people,” Ron said after a bit, “it looks like there are actually a bunch of scary, strange, weird movies that Disney made over the years…”
“I need your advice,” he said quietly, “well not really your advice, more like encouragement… maybe?” Harry offered him a smile and moved to sit on his bed. He motioned for Ron to join him.
Harry took pity on the look of mild confusion on Draco’s face and explained to him that Clara Ivanova and Aidan Lynch were two members of Krum’s band. They had an on-and-off drummer, Tony Silva, but they could never really count on him. They had been working together for about three years now and had a small following. “They’re band’s kinda weird. Because we know Krum to be mostly a fluffball, but when he’s on stage he looks grouchy and mean and his eyebrows scrunch up into a unibrow. And Clara’s like that too. She kind of reminds me of Ginny - Ron’s sister- because of the red hair and she’s a really nice person but when she’s up on stage, she looks like she could reach her hand into your chest, tear out your heart, and eat it, just for the fun of it. Aidan’s kinda chill all the time though, but that’s mostly just because he’s a stoner.” Harry continued, “Band’s called Quidditch International, it was supposed to be a joke, but no one understands it except for them, I think even Ron doesn’t know what it means.”
“I don’t know. Sometimes it seems like she does, but other times, I can’t be sure.” Blaise sighed, but didn’t look sad or anything like that about it. “It’s Hermione. Please, don’t say anything but I don’t mind you knowing.”
“Uh, yeah. You’re in the right place. Why don’t you take a seat over there,” he pointed towards a waiting area, “And I’ll go tell her you’re here. What’s your name?”
At some point, Ron wandered out of the dorm to let his boyfriend in the building. Draco was confident the two of them had been texting consistently since Draco had arrived. He mentioned that to Harry and Hermione in Ron’s absence, in a joking way, and they smiled almost identical knowing smiles at him.
“Hey! You here?” She said into the phone as she walked back into the common area where Ron and Harry had successfully installed the TV and were now trying to get it connected to Ron's computer.
“Yeah, um, well, I guess because we both have our own rooms, we don’t have to worry about getting in each other’s way or messiness. But we do share the bathroom and the common area.” Draco answered, gesturing behind him to Ron’s open door.
, obviously.”
“Do you want us to pause it?” Hermione called after him.
Two nights later, on the eve of Draco’s meeting with Ms. McGonagall, he lay in bed, unable to drift off into any sort of slumber, even an unsatisfying one. He was keyed up and anxious, knowing that this meeting was the beginning of a new chapter in his foreseeable future. He ordered Japanese food earlier that night because he had thought it a calming and relaxing meal but now, hours later, he was rethinking his complete ability to make decisions, from food choices to life ones. Finally, after sighing a few too many times at his now dark ceiling, Draco reached over to his bedside table and pulled his laptop onto the bed. He sat up with it and browsed through random tabs and internet pages, unsure of what he wanted to do, just knowing that he wanted to do something until he realized that perhaps he wanted to watch a movie, a feel-good one at that. So Draco found a good, albeit illegal, online version of Josie and the Pussycats and settled into his pillows. It made him feel a bit reckless if he was going to be honest with himself and it was nice to watch something in the comfort of his bed and not alone in a mini-movie theater.
“No, super more vanilla than that, sadly enough.” Ron smiled tightly like he didn’t really want to before trying to look serious, “cuddle?”
“Yeah I mean I don’t mean to, it just happens, you know that.” They smiled at each other, and he pressed on, “I’ve noticed him and Tonks, they’ve gone out for drinks a few times. Who else does he flirt with?”
“It’s nice and actually pretty similar to Ron and Draco’s set up, except that it’s only one single room instead of two. The freshmen on the floor seem nice enough I guess, maybe a bit bookish -  but I’m used to that.” Harry sent her a knowing smile. “And their mostly cute and terrified!”
“Awesome! Thanks and you’re welcome! See you soon.” Harry called after Draco, and he turned around.
“No, I know what they are,” Draco assured him, “I just didn’t realize there was anything special about them.” He gestured towards the card Ron had placed unceremoniously onto the coffee table. “I didn’t even know they had - what? trading cards? - in them. I kind of just figured it was chocolate shaped in a frog mold and that was it. I guess I never saw anyone actually with a chocolate frog before.”
“Yeah I’ll send Ron down.” She said, hung up, and then looked over at Ron. Having heard her, he made his way out of the room and down the hall. Hermione walked back into Draco’s room and Harry followed.
Harry and Ron had dropped Ron’s bags of purchases and Draco off at their dorm, before making their way over to Harry’s. He side-eyed his red-headed friend as they began their walk, not wanting to push him into revealing whatever was bugging him, but he knew Ron would spit it out eventually, no matter how weird or embarrassing it was, though, at this point, Harry didn’t really know how Ron could think anything was embarrassing between the two of them. They’d known each other for so long and literally talked about everything that there wasn’t really a subject that could phase them, probably. And it’s not like they didn’t hang out over the summer and know everything about each other anyway. But Harry let Ron think through it and take his time. Eventually Ron decided to just make small talk on their way to Ravenclaw Tower and Harry went along with it, prattling on about classes and what their professors might be like, not wanting to make his friend any more uncomfortable than he already was. It wasn’t until they closed the door behind them and looked around Harry’s new living area that Ron turned to Harry, ears burning.
He fell into step behind her, and was startled by the strange images that were painted on her backpack. It appeared that Luna, or someone else, had painted a purple and pink octopus across the fabric, over the zippers and pockets. The octopus’s tentacles which were covered in violently bright magenta suction cups were wrapped around paintings of various objects including a pencil, a radish and turnip and a pear, and a rather indelicately squashed looking birthday cake; it seemed as though the more he looked at the bag, the more he discovered. Draco stumbled after her hurriedly to give her a compliment which she accepted gracefully and offered to paint his bag for him if he wanted.
“Mr. Malfoy, you haven’t gone through the mail in over a week,” he said quietly and then  paused, causing Draco to look up at him, questioningly, “I’m worried about you.” He said sadly as he set the mail by Draco’s right elbow. “Please let me know if you need anything else.” Draco watched the older man leave and wondered why he hadn’t fired him yet. The constant reminder of his loss was a strain on his mood and appetite.
Draco let out a small, shocked laugh, “that might be the only question I know how to answer! Or at least, it’s an easier one.” He paused and let himself gather his thoughts before continuing, “I got a letter from HU a while ago reminding me that my ‘spot’ or whatever was going to be passed on to someone else if I didn’t come back - since it’d been like a year and a half. I had been so bored and apathetic over the summer, a note like that kind of felt like a
His new roommate hadn’t arrived and no one had texted to say hi yet so Ron slipped into his room and flopped onto the neatly made bed complete with extra pillows and a handmade blanket. He messed around on his phone while he waited for something to happen, whittling away an hours staring at an overly bright screen and giving himself a headache that he definitely did not deserve. Hungry and waiting to hear from Harry or Hermione or Krum, Ron riffled through his newly stocked mini-fridge to see what treats his mom had left him. He laughed out loud when he found a box of trix yogurts, and made a mental note to send his mom a nice text to thank her. He opened it and emptied the yogurt cups into the fridge, stacked them neatly, and then took one with him to the bed. He licked at the cup without bothering to find a spoon, happy to get a little messy with the sugar-filled treat.
“No one will, I promise,” he said, setting his bag down on one of the sides, “I do this all the time. Everyone’s too focused on their own lives to notice other people leaving their stuff around. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone getting their stuff stolen - at least not in this way.”
“Yeah, I’m not sure I can ask people stuff like that, at least not yet. Thank you for talking to me about it.”
“Regardless,” Draco bumped his shoulder with Blaise’s, “Hermione isn’t the kind of person to let something like that break up a friendship, especially not the one she has with you.”
Krum kissed Ron’s belly button and looked up at him, “oh, yeah, we are definitely keeping this on the table.” He shifted back, though, to place the strap-on into the drawer and take out a condom and the lube. Krum placed the items in reaching distance on the bed and then delicately climbed on top of Ron, not wanting to squish him. He leaned down to claim his mouth in another kiss, but he didn’t stay there long. He kissed his way down Ron’s body, mapping his progress pressing little licks and bites into his skin wherever he could reach. Ron hadn’t taken off his binder, so Krum knew to leave that area alone this time. He hoped that Ron would be ok with taking it off later though when they went to sleep - Ron had been wearing it at least all afternoon and it would probably not be good for him to wear it for much longer. He nipped at Ron’s navel and the redhead let out a small sound. Ron moved his hand from where it had been resting on the bed towards Krum’s head and Krum turned so he could kiss it lightly before returning to Ron’s abdomen.
“Then it’s settled,” Krum said and finished his drink with dramatic finality, roughly putting it back onto the table and grinning over at his boyfriend. “I can make the stop to Honeydukes, if you all want to go straight to the dorm to set up.” Everyone nodded and Cedric offered to accompany him. Ron texted Blaise back while Hermione brought a stack of dishes over to the counter and Harry followed her, juggling mugs and utensils a little more precariously. Tonks thanked them and started to clear the dirty dishes away.
The three of them ate quietly for a few moments. Draco then stood up to get himself a glass of water and asked if either Harry or Blaise wanted some too and they both said yes. A few minutes later, Draco was making his way slowly across the Great Hall, his fingers stretched over the three cups, so as not to spill any water. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw someone approaching him so he came to a stop. Turning his head slightly he realized it was one of Theo’s friends and found himself unsure what to do. The man walked up to him and offered a strange smile which Draco did not return.
“Oh stop it, I don’t have a
“Well I guess we’ll just have to see.” Krum responded distractedly. His train of thought regarding family reminded him of the picture on Ron’s bedside table. He felt the warmth wash over his body once again - not that he was cold or anything to begin with. He moved his hands so they were resting on Ron’s hips. “I just wanted to say, though - on a different note - I really like that picture of us and that you put it on your bedside table. I get that it means a lot and I just, it makes me happy, and I love you a lot.” It was Krum’s turn to blush, thought he saw the happiness in Ron’s eyes as they flicked from the table back to Krum’s face.
Harry bumped his shoulder again and moved up the bed so that he was lying down, Ron flopped down beside him and then turned his body so his face against Harry’s side, one of his arms slid across Harry’s abdomen. Harry brought a hand up to tangle in Ron’s hair and started playing with it absently. He felt them both relax as they settled on top of the blankets. “So what are you trying to do then?” Ron answered him, but the words were muffled, Harry smiled up at the ceiling and tugged lightly at the soft strands of hair between his fingers, “come on, you can tell me.”
With midterms coming up and also Fall break to worry about, Draco was experiencing a growing level of anxiety. He knew that Pansy wasn’t going to be coming in to town for her break, so he had to decide if he wanted to spend it back at the Manor with Mr. Dobby by himself, or stick it out at Hogwarts, also by himself. He and the butler chatted over the phone every once in a while and, in this case, Mr. Dobby reassured him that he just needed to know a day or so in advance to prepare some parts of the house if Draco was indeed coming for an extended weekend. Midterms were a whole separate can of worms, and Draco knew he was stressing himself out and affecting the people around him. He worried since he hadn’t been a student in quite some time and he did not want to do poorly, now that he had committed himself. It wasn’t that he thought he would necessarily fail his exams or papers, but the effort required to study for tests and the research that needed to be done for papers… It felt like a lot and he didn’t want to do anything wrong.
“Here, look at this,” Draco said as he handed his butler the letter, “I need help making a decision.”
“True,” Hermione allowed, “like that Smart House movie was creepy as hell.” That comment garnered her murmurs of agreement and they all turned their attention back to the screen.
“I don’t know.” Blaise sighed, but turned his head to smile down at Draco, “I don’t want to change our friendship, but I think she might feel at least somewhat similarly. I can’t be sure.”
“Let’s go somewhere other than the Great Hall,” Krum said, “we ate there yesterday and we should show Draco the other places on campus anyway.” Ron nodded in agreement.
“I thought so as well,” he said. “Would it be ok with you if I moved my minifridge into the main area? It doesn’t hold much, but it takes up space in my room and it could be useful out there, especially if we have nights like this again.”
After that, he didn’t have much patience and brought his hands past his stomach to his sleep shorts, pushing them off him and then the bed without ceremony. It doesn’t take him long to conjure up images in his head of moving bodies and sweat-soaked skin and roaming hands, letting himself sink into the familiarity of his own imagined pornography and his hands do the work. Draco’s right hand came up to pinch at his nipples again, pulling each in turn, prodding them so that they remained hard and sensitive on his chest as his left hand spent time with his cock and balls, playing and teasing. He let his breath get heavy and his stomach grow tight with the slow building pleasure, holding off his orgasm for as long as possible, wanting to draw it out and let this be more than the quick jerk-offs he’d allowed himself the last few days in his shower.
Draco looked down at his hands which were holding twisted strangely around the half-eaten sweet. His experiences of the past few months floated through his mind - the boredom that snaked its way through his veins, the dust that settled on his skin from the unused air of the still and quiet mansion that surrounded him. He took a small breath before meeting her bespectacled eyes, “I’ve thought about this a bit since I sent in the fax with my information. I do want to live on campus in a dorm - but in a single. I don’t think I could handle living with another person.” He flushed slightly and looked away. “ There wasn’t anything wrong with the roommate I had a few years ago - Theo was fine. I think I just need my own space.”
From the stairs at the end of the corridor emerged the Scary Elderberry, Lonny or Lotty or something like that, followed by Pansy Parkinson who was crushing on her very hard. Elderberry seemed to be amused by it. Pansy was too young and female to spark her interest (not that she was adverse to women, but she preferred men). She liked Pansy, though, and since the girl was following her around she was happy to take the role of a mentor.
But they had no idea of the extent Snape’s involvement. None. All the curses he surreptitiously knocked aside, all the misfired spells. It wasn’t just gaining Voldemort’s trust and acting on Dumbledore’s plans, he, Snape, personally saved two dozen lives with none the wiser. He was so good at acting covertly!
“I don’t suppose you are here wanting to change your wand,” said Ollivander and there it was, the glint in the eye. It made Harry’s skin crawl.
ooOoo
It was nice.
Clothes are optional in dreams so Harry was able to feel immediately how soft Malfoy’s hair was, like a big piece of silk rubbing against his thigh, from down the knee up the inner thigh and to the groin. Malfoy’s eyes might have been pale blue in the dream, who knew? They weren’t important, not like his mouth, his lips, pink and shiny.
Draco returned almost an hour later. Harry saw him before he reached the door because by pure chance he had been sitting near the window looking at the street waiting for a silver white figure to appear. Draco was coming at a trot, looking over his shoulder and with his wand in his hand. Fenton was pulling on his leash to go on the other direction, and Draco was almost dragging him back to the house. The moment he reached the door he began to pound on it.
“Had fun then?”
Would Draco even want to be stopped?
“…All right, Draco. Drink your tea.”
“Did you see that? Did you
The end.
“All right,” said Harry. “All right.”
Harry smiled nervously. “Truth is… I am afraid”.
Which is how Draco was banished to the Costa Café nearby, where he doodled five drawings in the paper napkins. Mort looked them over with the eye of a Gringotts’s globin assessing a purchase. He rejected the shield of Hogwarts right away even though Draco had got the four animals pretty well. He settled on paying three pounds for a drawing of  a quidditch player dodging a bludger, and one pound each for a cauldron with a potion boiling and a shelf with a set of ingredients.

Draco knew it. Goyle was ambitious and stupid and that made him extremely easy to manipulate. They think that Goyle might have died heroically. That he stood up to whoever was doing this, that he tried to save the witches. (Witch? They know at least one of them is alive but they can’t be sure about the two of them).
“I got
He nodded, unable to trust his voice at that moment. Seemingly satisfied for now, Healer Benson spelled the door open and led the way into the corridor where Ron and Hermione waited, standing as soon as they saw Harry step through.
Harry patted her head reassuringly, trying not to laugh as her voice raised with every passing word. “I know, ‘Mione. It’s why you do so well at work.”
Looking at the list of everyone involved in the Secret Santa swap, Harry smiled to himself as he scribbled through Ginny and Pansy’s names. That only left… Fifteen people, if he had counted correctly. Not impossible, he thought to himself. He would just have to be strategic so Malfoy didn’t catch on to his plan.

“Not at all. We were just leaving,” Ginny said as she grabbed Harry’s arm and gestured towards the front door with her head.
“We could stop at the sandwich place by Grimmauld so we don’t have to talk to anyone.”
“Does that mean everything Scorpius said wasn’t true?” Albus asked, puzzled expression on his face. “Because he said a lot about the war, and I want to know what was true. His dad doesn’t sound like a liar.”
Draco shook his head quickly, eyes blinking a few times. “I, um. I didn’t expect to see you here.”
Harry read the parchment in his hands once, twice, three times over before crumpling it into a ball and throwing it with more force than strictly necessary at the waste bin in the corner of his enlarged cubicle. It missed by a mile, ending up on the floor for the milliseconds it took Harry to decide to send a wandless
“Hermione Granger, and yes. I’m Harry’s friend. We live together, so I just wanted to make sure he hadn’t forgotten to tell you a few key details.”
“Er, kinda.” He shrugged, knowing there was no point hiding the details from her anymore. “He’s busy with work anyway, and we’ve both got kids—”
“Well, I think it was about the colours again. Dark meant something bad—but these were all stories, mind you.” Arthur scratched at his head for a minute, lines in his forehead becoming more prominent as he thought. “If they were the other colours though, the blues, the yellows, the greens…It meant that they were a perfect match.”
There wasn’t much rhyme or reason to any of Draco’s mutterings but it had clearly meant enough to him that he’d excused himself promptly and all but sprinted out the door to disapparate. That had been Thursday, and by the time Sunday rolled around and Harry had been hoping to pry some answers or even just sensical words from the other man, Draco had owled to say he would have to take a rain check on their visit to
“Give me one minute! Then you can stuff him to your heart’s delight.”
There was a pause, Malfoy seeming to think on his response quite intently for a while. After what seemed like an eternity, his shoulders dropped and he shot Harry a despairing look. “I’ve been dating.”
“It’s Harry,” he shot back. “A few years of not seeing each other doesn’t change that.”
“Harry.” Ginny clicked her fingers in front of his face, incredulous stare on her face. “Do I have to march you out of the house myself?”
Hermione looked at him as if she knew precisely what had just transpired in his thoughts. “Just… I don’t know. Do what you want, you’re an adult. But be gentle with Ginny, okay? I’ve never seen two people work so well together in a relationship and yet I’ve also never been so intrigued by what keeps it working. And I’m sorry if that’s too much, I’m sorry if I’m overstepping. I’m observant, you know!”
“I feel cheated! Why isn’t she here now?”
“Draco…” Harry gave up at the blonde’s expression. “Fine. Tell me something you’ve done since I last saw you.”
There were lots of hugs and tears once they made it out the other side of the brick, Teddy’s ecstasy at finally stepping foot on the platform being quickly overshadowed by all other emotions that came with leaving home for the first time to attend Hogwarts.
Shaking his head slowly, Harry cleared his throat. “I wasn't sure. Draco’s spoken about you, of course, I just haven’t seen any photos in the
“So she’s safe without you there?”
Yet the irony is strong
“I do want to see you! I just didn’t know what to…” He trailed off, and he knew from the look in her eyes that she already knew what he was about to say.
“You didn’t insult his father, call him a Death Eater, tell him you think he’s up to something...?”
“Um, Mister Potter?”
Shrugging, Ginny leaned back in her chair. “I mean, he told you to stay away until we figured things out, didn’t he?” At Harry’s confirming nod, she continued. “I’m not saying it would change anything. I’m not saying you should do anything. I just want you to know that if you’d been more upfront with yourself and everyone else about how you felt earlier on you would have lived a very different life.”
“We? Oh, you and Ginevra.” There was a pause as he hesitated, before reaching forward to finish the rest of his coffee. “I’ll be in France with mother, I’m afraid.”
Thinking on just how much had changed for him since that fateful night at the kitchen table two years ago, Harry gave her an echoing smile of his own. “No, I don’t.”
“How do you mean?” Draco asked, voice shaking even as he tried to keep his tone neutral.
He froze.
“No, Harry. I should have done this a long time ago.”
Sipping her tea, Ginny raised an eyebrow at him over the rim of her mug.
First stop on the agenda was the new cafe that had taken residence in Fortescue’s old parlour space; though his heart panged at the memories, the other Aurors wouldn’t shut up about how great it was and a few were known to duck down on lunch breaks and bring back coffee for the office. Harry had been out in the field every time this had happened, so he figured he ought to take the opportunity while he was here.
“It’s nothing, really. Just a bad dream.”
Cursing, he moved to quickly sit up in the bed and grimaced as his stomach lurched with the motion. Bracing himself on his elbows he let out a heavy sigh and jammed his glasses back onto his face, his unfamiliar surroundings coming into focus. Ron and Hermione were in the far corner of the room by the entrance and an unfamiliar Healer stood opposite his bed, all slightly blurry even with his vision restored. He realised that someone had put up a
“Er, maybe?”
“I was worried that—”
Lifting his glasses enough to wipe his other hand across his eyes, Harry yawned and forced his body upright. Scooting forward on the bed so that his toes were brushing the hardwood floor he called for Kreacher before considering that perhaps he should have dressed prior to inviting the elf in.
He lay there waiting for the telltale sound of footsteps coming up the stairs, hoping that Hermione would be too caught up in preparation for tomorrow to come and mother him immediately. There was a big legislation push, he knew that much, and Hermione had somehow slotted herself right in the middle of negotiations.
“The Chamber of Secrets was in here, did you know that? I almost died in my second year.”
“Draco Malfoy, not complaining? Now there’s a Christmas miracle.” Laughing at Draco’s pout, Harry nudged his shoulder with his own and shook his head fondly. “Come off it, you prat. Now tell me more about the goblin negotiations.”
Having the decency to look sheepish at being called out, Harry grimaced. “Why the kitchen?”
Following Malfoy towards the ruckus deeper in the store, Harry looked around at all of the animals surrounding them. Maybe it was time to start considering another pet, he thought. It had been almost two years since he had lost Hedwig and while it still stung him to think about, being surrounded by all of these creatures made him think that maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea he’d ever had. Considering who he was currently keeping company with, it would at the very least be far from the worst idea he’d had today.
