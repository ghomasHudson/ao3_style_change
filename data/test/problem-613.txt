Harry was a bit behind in the crowd, listening to Hermione and Ron who were beside him, arguing about the homework’s answers. For once, everyone was on time (which annoyed Snape - taking points from a house that’s not Slytherin was the joy of his day, especially taking points from Gryffindor).
He pounced on Draco, wrapping his legs around the other’s waist as tears were starting to spill down his cheeks, burying his face into his neck. Draco, startled,
“Of course he is. I can’t stay. He’ll die before I do. It’s like asking to be found. I couldn’t possibly put him in that sort of danger, now could I?” he paused, then frowned when she didn’t answer. “Pansy?”
“Will you Gryffindorks stop being so loud?” Someone called from the Slytherin table. Harry turned to see Draco who had just arrived, glaring at them. However, his glare softened when Harry turned to look at him.
He slowly entered the Hall to see that Draco wasn’t there. He frowned but didn’t let it bother him. He made his way to Ron and Hermione who weren’t arguing for once. He sat down and started eating.
“Well, I thought that was a given,” Draco said, slowly taking a step back. He could sense what was about to happen, and he dreaded as the moment was slowly coming.
No one said anything, which just made Harry feel even worse. Draco gently squeezed Harry’s hand again, giving him a reassuring look as he pulled Harry close to him, wrapping his arms around him. Harry slowly crawled onto Draco’s lap, resting his head on his chest.
“Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.” Harry reassured, sensing the tone in Draco’s voice. He walked out of the bathroom and chuckled. “I mean, I lived in a cupboard under the stairs until I was eleven, you really expect them to buy me-”
“Draco, it’s Monday,” she raised an eyebrow. Just as she was about to ask what had happened, he quickly left, practically running down the hallway. Too hungry by now, she entered the Great Hall, deciding she had more pressing matters to get to.
“Draco?” Astoria asked, waving her hand slightly in front of him. “What do you think of these glasses?” She held them out. “I like the elegant design on them. Should we get a set of six?”
Draco looked into his sparkling green eyes. No one’s eyes shined this way. Only Harry could make Draco feel this way.
Then, Harry got up, gently putting his lips to Draco’s hand. Then he slowly let go of Draco’s hand and left to go to class.
“That would be more ideal than the situation I’m in right now,” he slipped before he could stop himself. To his surprise, Draco actually laughed out loud.
The two watched Hermione and Pansy go, both giggling to themselves like little school girls. Draco shut the door behind them, turning to face Harry. “That was…”
Although Harry had said it in even less than a whisper, those words still echoed in Draco’s mind as loud as possible.
“What?” Harry asked confused when Draco eagerly smiled, walking over to Harry and handing him the box. “Draco, you didn’t have to-”
“You need to pretend to be in deep conversation. Then slowly look up - casually - and stare into his eyes with a smile. It’ll get him flustered.” Pansy explained. “Now, laugh.”
“You can’t just ignore me forever,” she said. The two looked down at the TV remote that was on the coffee table, both scrambling to grab it. They did some back and forth before she eventually won, quickly turning it off. “We need to talk about this. You can’t sit here and mope!”
“Hey...” Ginny appeared out of nowhere. She had been crying. Hermione walked over to her and asked her what was wrong. “Dean and I had a fight.” Ginny glanced over to look at Harry to see his reaction, but he was busy watching Draco.
Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds in disbelief, before looking down at the bottle in his hand, then glancing back up at Harry. “Uh… you could say I know him a bit too well,” He said rather awkwardly, deciding to just let the conversation continue. He thought it was better if Harry talked to him rather than anyone else while drunk.
“...about how you’re feeling right now?” she raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you think he’d take it the wrong way? You know, maybe think it’s about him? Besides, I thought each poem had to be about how sorry you are.”
He would bump into his father every so often. Lucius would nod at him while Draco gave him a cold look. There was nothing he wanted to say to him.
Harry frowned, but decided not to pester. Draco probably needed space. Harry turned away, taking a step back from Draco. But then Harry remembered what it was like for him whenever he was locked away under the stairs inside the closet, how he would just want someone to hug him till he’d forget about the pain that filled his mind and his chest; so Harry took a step forward and wrapped his arms around Draco, walking over to the nearby bench and holding him tightly.
Harry bit his lip, taking a long sip from the bottle of Firewhiskey, “Can I trust you?” He asked in a low voice, staring at the other intently, leaning in. Draco nodded, and Harry burst into hysterical giggles. “Okay, shh… you can’t tell anyone. I’m… I’m in love with Draco Malfoy.”
“Ask the absolute motherfucker,” Draco said, putting a hand to his cheek, unable to even look in Harry’s direction, but knew damn well that he was staring. He felt severely humiliated, his silver eyes gleaming as he frowned. He was unable to fathom what was happening. Gulping, he swiftly went towards the door, face getting warm.
Pansy and Draco exchanged glances. “Probably,” she replied, using her eyes to tell Draco to stay silent. “Anyway-”
“Oh, shut up, Malfoy.” Harry snapped at him, but the Slytherin and Gryffindor shared a look in their eyes that knew they didn’t mean what they were saying at all.
“You know it isn’t,” Draco replied. “Harry. It just slipped, okay? I didn’t mean it like that.” Draco looked down at his left arm - he still didn’t have the courage to wear short-sleeved clothes. It was still full-length shirts, his Dark Mark tucked away neatly. People knew to not bring it up; to leave it be. Most just steered clear of Draco.
“I know but… I couldn’t bring myself to it.” Draco said with a sigh, placing his head on Harry’s chest. “I’m on your side okay? Even if I have to lie about which side I’m on. I’m always on your side, the good side.”
“Yes, Harry, I am. So please just tell me. This seems more like just a fight that happened,” Hermione said. She was now feeling nervous. If looks could kill, Hermione would have been long dead by now. But she contained eye contact with Harry.
“They won’t hate you! It’s really hard for them to hate people, okay? You’ll be fine. Trust me,” Harry tried to reassure Draco, and frankly, he didn’t know if it was working or not. “Okay, let’s go inside. I’m freezing.”
Harry turned to Draco, nodding slightly. Lucky for the two, Hermione and Pansy started a conversation about Astoria and Draco’s wedding, which kept the group in a less awkward position.
Draco let out a snort, and Hermione and Ron behind Harry stared at him, eyebrows raised. He cleared his throat. “I mean, is that really the best you can do?”
Hello! I just wanted to say that this story can also be found on Wattpad. Not sure if I'll keep it up there or not, just wanted to try it out.
“On it,” Draco said at once, turning to his closet. “Go drink water. If you get lost, call out to me.”
The Gryffindor gave him a small smile. “I cry all the time. Well, not all the time. I think I felt a few tears come down my face last week when I dropped my book. Now that’s embarrassing isn’t it? I also cried three days ago because I was in the shower and the water wasn’t hot enough,” he rambled. He looked up to see Draco smiling through his tears. “Sorry.”
“Hey,” Blaise said, pursing his lips. “...Pansy helped me realize that what I did was out of line and stupid. So… I’m sorry for everything I said. I didn’t mean to sound so homophobic.”
When they pulled away for the last time, Harry looked up at him nervously, breathing heavily. He put a hand to his own lips, not taking his eyes off Draco, too overwhelmed to say anything. The two flopped down on the couch, still buzzing from the kiss.
He took out the note from his pocket, holding it up somewhat accusingly. “The poem. It’s beautiful. You ought to give it to the girl who you wrote about. Rather than sending it to me. I don’t really like getting poems meant for someone else.”
He looked up from his book, raising an eyebrow, gazing at her amusedly, fiddling with the ring on his finger. “Alright, give me some, then.”
“You’re right,” Draco admitted, getting out the picnic blanket and spreading it over the grass and sitting down, “you are too cute. Plus, you know what they say, don’t leave kids alone in forests.”
Harry didn’t mind, he knew that they had to get by like this, faking the hate. He slowly took his bag and joined Hermione and Ron who were waiting for him at the door of the classroom.
But that didn’t stop him from being a complete jerk. Harry couldn’t approach Draco now. Harry had been a dick towards him. Draco had every right to be upset - even though he had said some things about him too, Harry knew that he took it too far.
“I win,” Draco smiled, but it faded after a few moments. “Are you okay, though, Harry? Do you think these lessons with Dumbledore are really necessary? It seems like it’s only stressing you out.”
“Oh, look who’s talking. ‘NOTHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, SHUT UP, I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING.’” Draco imitated Harry right back, sitting up and rolling his eyes.
Sorry for the short chapter but I wanted something to be out before my school starts. I hope I'll be able to make enough time to write! I have finals coming up in June so quite stressful. Especially stressful when the only time I'm inspired to write drarry is when I'm supposed to be doing homework hahah
Ron simply shrugged. “I dunno. It’ll probably just wash out. Come on, I’m hungry, let’s get to breakfast.”
“Fuck you, Harry! Stop making things harder than they already are!” shouted Draco. “Haven’t you done enough to me?”
“Harry…” he whispered as he let the other pull him into a kiss, wrapping his arms around his waist. “What about the factors? Our mistakes?”
Harry stayed silent for a moment. “I was under the impression it was making you feel good here,” he said, putting his hand over Draco’s crotch, who gasped slightly. The two stared at each other for a moment too long. Harry’s lips twitched in amusement. “Am I wrong?"
In the depths of the Slytherin dorm rooms, Draco was, despite his best attempts, unable to sleep. Checking the watch on his bedside table, he stared in disbelief. It was only midnight - he had been trying to sleep for what felt like hours. Removing the covers off of him, he picked up a sweater that he knew belonged to Harry, but made no effort to think back to when he could have possibly taken it by accident, perhaps on one of their Saturdays (or Saturdates as Harry called it once, and was given the silent treatment for the next twenty minutes).
“I do consider myself lucky,” he stated. He sat up, intertwining both of his hands with Draco’s, looking up into his eyes. “Tomorrow’s Sunday.”
“Yeah, what about it?” Harry asked. “Why? Come on babe, if you told me you were coming in advance, we could’ve showered together.” He teased.
Hermione put a hand on his shoulder. “Draco? It’s time to tell him. He deserves to know. The pain he’s in, it’s… it hurts to watch him go through it every day.”
Harry gently pressed his index finger against Draco’s nose. “You should’ve seen the look on your face!”
Hermione and Pansy entered the Hospital Wing, going to Harry’s bed. It was quite late at night. Hermione and Pansy sat down on two chairs beside the bed, not noticing that Harry was wide awake.
He was surprised, to say the least, and to be frank, he wasn’t sure if he liked this new side of Draco. “Um… you know, you don’t need to come every Friday if you don’t want to,” Harry pointed out. “I’m sure you’re busy with friends.”
“Yeah, um… she fell sick last year and lost her hearing a few months ago,” he spoke, chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. “That’s why I was asking you for lessons. Anyway, uh… now that she lost her hearing, I thought she would get better, but… my father said it comes and goes. I’m just… worried.”
“Well… it just feels like you’re the only person who listens to what I have to say, and…” Draco felt his eyes tear up. “Fuck, this is so stupid.”
“I don’t know why you’re so adamant about it…” He rolled his eyes and shrugged. “I don’t know. You seem apologetic, but seriously, why do you care if I forgive you or not? You didn’t seem to care when you threw my hearing aids into the lake.”
“Good morning,” said Draco as he reached over and ruffled Harry’s hair. “Finally, you’re awake. I didn’t want to leave without you.”
“You find it hard to sleep?” Draco asked quietly, his silver eyes glinting with an emotion that Harry couldn’t decipher. Harry studied Draco’s white hair before slowly nodding.
“Something funny with my teaching, Mr. Potter?” Snape asked, coming into Harry’s view. “You’re already behind due to your… disability. I wouldn’t want you to be further set back by Mr. Weasley here.”
“He’s just helping me learn WSL and I’m helping him keep up with his classes. Nothing else,” he put his hands up as if to tell her to calm down. “Seriously.” he folded his arms, then looked at her again.
September flew by quickly and things were eerily calm. Draco entered the Slytherin Common Room and sat down beside Pansy, who turned to him with a smile. It was a late Friday evening and he had just finished up a WSL lesson with Harry. Though, if they were being honest, it wasn’t much learning and more… making out on the couch, amongst other things.
“Harry, what the hell are you doing?” Hermione snapped, leaning over and picking up his books. She followed Harry’s gaze and realized what was wrong. “Oh, it’s just Malfoy; it’s okay, Harry.”
“...well, if you really feel that way, then I’m sorry. Tell me if I’m overstepping again,” she said, her frown helping Harry understand that she actually did feel quite sorry. “Let’s go. Last lesson before the holidays, huh?”
Harry looked over to Hermione, too surprised to continue listening to their conversation. “I’m sorry, what?” he whispered. “Is she saying that as a joke, or?”
“I’m not the world,” Harry pointed out, frowning, “and I sure as hell shouldn’t count as just ‘another person’ to you.” Harry unclenched his fist, lifting his hand and hesitantly touched Draco’s that was on the table. “I would have listened. And I would have tried to understand, to help. Draco, I’m not just anyone else. I
Five minutes to midnight, Harry was seated at his desk, staring at the clock. Sighing, he adjusted his t-shirt and looked down at his homework that he had finally decided to do, but was nowhere near finishing.
“Draco!” he heard his father hissing. Draco slowly got on his two feet, trembling as his father motioned for him to come over to him. Draco slowly, and carefully, took a few steps towards Voldemort. He turned to face Harry’s body.
Molly had sent him an invitation again, and he felt it would be too rude to decline. Taking a quill, he dipped it in ink and started writing to Molly Weasley, accepting her invitation to the Christmas dinner.
“Hermione, could you not?” Harry folded his arms, tilting his head as she stood in front of the TV. “You know, this isn’t making me like you any better right now.”
Harry had spent the last few weeks looking at the Marauders Map, trying to find out where Draco had been going, he was disappearing during classes from time to time.
Pansy burst out laughing. Draco stared at her in utter disbelief. “Sorry, just the thought of you being with Astoria was too much for me to take.” Pansy said with a laugh. “Come on, you were with Harry last night, weren’t you?”
Draco and Harry both took a few steps back from the cauldron, then turned to look at each other. The potion was still somewhat of a light green slime and now it was on their faces. There were a few quiet snickers. Harry quickly looked away, trying to hide his smile.
That evening, Harry and Draco hurried to dinner after sneaking out of the room of requirement. Hermione eyed her best friend suspiciously as he sat down beside her, humming out of tune as he served himself.
“Uh, can we get back to the conversation, please?” Harry asked awkwardly, shifting as Draco faked a gag. Ron and Hermione slowly pulled apart, breathless and grinning, turning back to Draco and Harry.
“Will you let me finish?” Harry said, leaning forward and smacking his shoulder lightly. “All I’m saying is, it might take some time to get used to it. I’m sure after dinner they’ll all love you as I do.”
“Okay, really, that’s more than enough,” Hermione said after a few moments. The two pulled apart, their hair messy, grinning.
Harry shook his head, gulping. “I’m okay. I just…” he trailed off into silence, looking up at Draco, who was frowning, sincerity and worry etched upon his face. “I just remembered how much I love you.”
Harry felt his chest sink deeper as he sat in the Eighth Year Common Room. He looked over at Pansy who was reading a book beside him, unsure if he should ask her where Draco was.
“Oh shut up, Draco.” Harry’s arms were now wrapped around Draco’s neck and he pushed their lips together. Harry had jumped on Draco’s front. The kiss lasted long again, the two knew that they probably wouldn’t be able to freely make out until Saturday.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry said, slightly breathless, knowing he had to speak quickly before the countdown was over, “Before midnight, I just want you to know that… that… well… whatever the new year brings us, well I’ll… I’ll still love you and, I will never, ever let you go, and… and I’ll stop being such a pain in the ass.”
It was like fireworks. Harry felt Draco put his arms around his waist. This time, when their lips met, it was as if they were greeting each other again, the kisses being soft but quickly turning to rough, with deep lust and a need for more.
“No,” Harry snapped, tears in his eyes. “It’s tainted now. You can throw it away. I, uh… I don’t want to look at it.”
The bottle landed on Draco. This time, Draco was quick to stand up, running to the dorm. Harry was close behind him. As he entered, Draco grabbed his hand and slammed the door shut, pushing him against the wall right beside the door.
Harry didn’t quite know where he stood with Draco. If they stood anywhere at all, even. But as each day passed, each poem seemed to be deeper, more real. It was a raw version of Draco, and Harry liked being the only one to see his poetic side, as weird as it sounded.
“Hold on. That can wait,” Harry cut him off, leaning forward and kissing Draco on the lips. At first, Draco froze, but he eventually kissed him back, the tension leaving his body. “I’ve missed you so much.”
“Oh come on, you’re not looking too great, and Draco is barely surviving. What happened between you two?”
“No partner, Mr. Potter?” He asked, glancing over to Ron and Hermione who were awkwardly moving to get the ingredients they needed.
Pansy cleared her throat loudly, “Hey, Potters, maybe try not to be gay in the middle of the hallway?”
“Professor, did you really just do that?” Draco asked, getting angry. “You have absolutely no right to look through-”
Opportunities? Or time in Azkaban? Draco kept his thoughts to himself, nodding. His expression was unreadable, and he hoped he seemed at least somewhat composed in front of him.
Harry watched him leave, finding himself almost mesmerized by his every move. Draco moved so effortlessly. Even if he wasn’t, with his confidence, you’d think he’s the most handsome person in the room. Well, it was hard to be in a room where someone was more attractive than Draco.
,” Harry stood up too, tears streaming down his face. He reached out for Draco’s hand, who moved away. It stung him, but he stepped closer. “Please. Just-”
Harry took his hands. “Like I want to hear you speak forever,” he smiled. “Talk. I haven’t heard your voice in so long. Last time I heard it you were probably telling me how I was going to lose the Triwizard Tournament.”
It was an hour till noon and Harry was getting really nervous now. He entered the Gryffindor Common Room.
Draco heard a distant shout of someone cursing right outside the Hospital Wing. He lied back down, shutting his eyes tightly, knowing well that it was Harry.
“Harry, we have class in five minutes,” Draco whispered as Harry kissed his neck, unbuttoning the first few buttons of his shirt. “Harry…”
After their first DADA class with Umbridge, the three were already tired of Umbridge and her stupidity. Ron and Hermione sat down beside Harry, who kept his eyes on the fireplace, expression blank.
He slowly opened the box and picked up the device, looking up at Harry in confusion. “You got me metal? I mean, thanks? What are these buttons on the side-” Draco let out a blood-curdling scream when the phone lit up, “What the fuck?! What the fuck, what the fu-”
After Draco had told her everything, if possible, his grin was even wider than before. “It was perfect. I wasn’t sure if it would go well, you know, considering we couldn’t possibly do what normal couples do, but… we made it work.”
had gotten their communication right. Harry just hoped it was enough to keep them together when they were on the cusp of war.
“It’s not finished,” Draco said, putting his hands over the paper, aware of how close Harry’s face was. He could practically feel his breath on his neck. To make matters worse, he only leaned in more so his chest was against his back, removing Draco’s hands.
Draco looked up, raising an eyebrow when he saw Blaise and Pansy approaching him. He stared down at the faded wounds on his knuckles, trying not to think about how gently Harry had wrapped the bandage around his hand. With an icy expression, he folded his arms.
“Take your own! Luna gave us plenty,” she rolled her eyes, sitting down beside him, taking another bite. “I didn’t expect her cake to be so big.”
“That hickey on your neck says otherwise,” Pansy sang. Draco quickly put a hand to his neck - of course, his pajamas didn’t hide his neck, as well as his shirts, did. Harry put a hand to his neck as well, feeling so awkward that he was smiling.
I hope you guys like it! I think we can all guess what's going to happen in the next chapter... oof.
Groaning, Draco sat up in his bed, reaching out for something - or perhaps it was someone. He stared at the empty space beside him, unsure of what he had done wrong to end up in this position. He remembered the lonely nights during the war, longing for Harry, but deep inside knowing that they would be together again. That feeling wasn’t there this time, and he realized that’s what made him so afraid.
“Quite reckless of me to come back, isn’t it?” Draco laughed nervously. “I’m laughing because I think I’ll cry if I don’t. By the way, your spell and wand work is so much better. You did really well back there against everyone, thanks to me."
“I don’t think that at all,” Harry took his hand carefully. Draco pulled away, but after a moment, he reached back. “We have our own battles to fight. I just want you to know that transparency would probably do us good.”
“Harry, look,” Hermione said. “Harry. Look at me,” she said sharply. Harry slowly turned to face her.
Draco picked up the Invisibility Cloak which was on the couch, slowly opening the door, looking over at Harry, rolling his eyes when he noticed him struggling to put on his shoes.
Harry looked down at the blank piece of paper he was going to use to write back to Draco. “I don’t know, guys. I don’t even know what happened. One minute I could hear, then… I came back through the Portkey and it was gone.”
“He’s so in love,” Ron said, shaking his head, not realizing that anything was wrong. He got into bed and fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Draco scoffed. “Godfather? My own father doesn’t have the right to look through my mind.” Draco hissed.
“Ron! Ron, come here.” Harry called out. Ron, who had just finished putting on his school uniform, walked over to Harry.
“Shut up,” Draco whispered, swiftly placing his lips on Harry’s, kissing him roughly and with passion. Of course, Harry kissed him right back, his tongue dancing in the other’s mouth, shutting his eyes and wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck.
“Just some secret admirers,” Harry said smoothly, taking the paper from the owl and smiling as he quickly left the Great Hall. He had taken a liking to Draco’s owl, who seemed to be much nicer than his owner.
A week passed. Ginny Weasley was finding every excuse to talk to Harry, but he wasn’t up for it. Eventually, she gave up and simply just stayed by him as he remained silent.
“You know, technically, only one of has to be under the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry pointed out, folding his arms. Draco shook his head after realizing what Harry meant.
On Saturday morning, Draco walked to the tent. It was mostly empty. He walked over to the couch and saw a pile of clothes neatly folded, and a piece of paper placed on top.
“Oh, Hermione, just because you don’t believe in something doesn’t mean it isn’t real,” Luna replied, practically beaming. “Believing or not believing, they will still be real.”
“Shut up,” Ron spoke up. “Do you really have nothing better to do than obsess over Harry? It almost seems like a personality trait now.”
“Alright, alright,” he said, standing up, pushing his hair out of his eyes. Pansy quietened almost immediately, eyes slightly wide. “What is it? Captivated by my beauty?”
“Shut up!” Draco shouted, getting very frustrated by now. Out of instinct, he took out his wand and pointed it at Harry. “You know nothing. This is not about you, Harry.”
When they made it to the Gryffindor table, Harry turned to the Slytherin table to make sure Draco was there.
Draco’s face was pink by now. He gripped his cup tightly, unsure why his chest felt so tight. The underlying hope that Harry would enjoy his poems were there, yet to hear him say it was something else entirely. “...forget it,” he replied, shaking his head. “Has the chamomile tea been helping you?”
“What… are you doing, Draco?” Pansy asked as she reached him, watching him pace back and forth near the entrance of the Great Hall. “I’ve been watching you pace from all the way over there,” she pointed behind her, which was a long hallway.
“No no, I’m waiting for you. You stupid git,” said Draco, but he was grinning at Harry, his silver eyes glistening as he stared at him, who rolled his eyes and walked into the bathroom.
She took his hand. “Just be honest when it happens. Whatever it is that you’re dreading. If you guys work through it together it’d be easier.”
Harry could feel something was wrong; right as the Hogwarts train started up. He frowned, biting his lip, staring out the window as he leaned his head on the glass.
“Merlin, what?” Harry asked, almost dropping one of the plates on the floor. “No! No, Draco and I are dating. We’re not… we’re not friends with benefits… Merlin, I didn’t even know people in the Wizarding World did that!” Molly smiled sweetly at Harry.
Ron and Hermione didn’t think they were doing anything particularly romantic that would make Harry feel like a third wheel. But then again, they didn’t think they were making Harry feel like a third wheel at all.
“I love your eyes.” An unfamiliar voice was telling Draco. “They’re just so handsome. And your hair, oh, your hair…”
“No!” she exclaimed, startling him. “Certainly not. That would just make it more difficult for both parties involved. You don’t want to keep going back and forth.”
“Malfoy, you didn’t have to,” he said, staring down at the hearing aids. He carefully put them on, adjusting it, staying still for a moment. He shook his head in disappointment. “I expected it not to work. Whatever happened to me was some sort of dark magic. It was a longshot anyway.”
“If you really have to…” Draco whispered, leaning forward and placing his head on Harry’s chest, trying to hide the fact that there were tears streaming down his face. Harry, of course, knew that he was crying. But he simply wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him onto his lip and rocking him gently.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were learning sign language to communicate better with Harry,” she smirked. “Look at all these notes! You’d think you were taking this as a second language.”
“That’s the best kind,” Hermione said excitedly. “I know it’ll seem weird at first, looking at someone in a romantic way when you never even dreamed of liking them that way. But, in the end it’s the best kind. Unexpected love.”
Harry let his eyes adjust, realizing that he had fallen asleep with his glasses still on. “I’m… sleeping?” he replied, raising an eyebrow. Seeing Ron’s annoyed expression, he sat up. “What’s up, Ron?”
“What word is that?” Harry pointed to his hands. “Did you actually learn the signs for the potions?”
She smirked as she looked past him. He followed her gaze. Mouth open, Draco frowned, his name spilling out of his mouth-
“Sleep,” Harry said. He stopped writing and set his quill down, adjusting himself before patting his empty lap. “You need it.” Draco raised an eyebrow, but crawled onto Harry’s lap, resting his head on his left shoulder. Harry used his left arm to hold Draco, and his other to start writing again.
“That’s exactly it,” Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s neck. “I’m teaching you to have the upper hand even without being able to hear. So, here’s what we’re going to do. You need to get ten times better at lip reading, and memorize hand movements. Alright?”
The four (Pansy, Luna, Ron, and Hermione) shot Harry a look but went anyways, to the nearby stands that were selling sweet foods. Luna hung back for a few seconds, sensing something was wrong but caught up with the others when Harry noticed that she was still there.
He gave him a quizzical look, exchanging glances with Hermione, who seemed confused too. “What do you want?”
“Funny… funny, yes,” he nodded, waiting for her to leave before taking out the book Snape had given him from his closet, grunting in frustration when the book refused to open. “Seriously?
“I don’t think they’re even trying to look like enemies anymore,” Ron replied, frowning as he stared at Draco and Harry, who had both stopped insulting each other and were just staring into each other’s eyes; both looking like they’ve never seen something more beautiful before.
Sometimes Harry found himself questioning if he really deserved a second chance with Draco. But, it was different when you loved someone. You always wanted to see the best in them. And Draco loved Harry.
“To please my father,” He admitted once he had snapped out of his thoughts, a sheepish smile on his face as if he was ashamed to say it. “He prefers it like this. That’s a bit difficult for me to say.”
“Then leave,” he said, taking a step forward. He set his bag down to the floor, not taking his eyes off of him. “I’m not going to force you to be here.”
He paused, rubbing his stubble. He hadn’t shaved in a few days nor even gone for Hermione and Ron’s New Year’s party two weeks ago.
“Well, that’s quite a relief,” Draco sighed, but smiled, leaning forward and kissing him softly. He felt his heart flutter and his chest easen up. He had been too nervous about today. He didn’t know what he would’ve done if the hearing aids hadn’t worked for Harry.
“Thanks for the tip,” Draco sarcastically replied, giving him a mocking smile. The two sat in silence for the next five minutes, but Harry was too busy watching the blond in front of him scribbling onto a piece of paper to be reading. “Got it?” he asked, looking up.
On Monday morning, Harry made his way to class. He was nowhere near in a state to be out of bed, but he had forced Madame Pomfrey to let him come to class. He had no choice but to do so, with their exams coming up in just a few months.
Draco raised an eyebrow, taking the box from him and opened the wrapping neatly (unlike Harry who ripped it open), placing it to the side, frowning as he stared at a box that had “iPhone 7” written on it.
“Yeah, I think you ruined whatever was left of my eardrums,” he said, standing up, putting his hands to his ears, then turning around to look at them again. “This is ridiculous. I thought you guys believed me.”
Harry needed less training and it wasn’t as if Draco had much time, so their Saturdays were gone too. Now it was just the Friday evenings, that sometimes one of them wouldn’t even show up to, because they got too busy with other things. Harry with Dumbledore, and Draco with - well. It didn’t need to be said.
Harry laughed, and Draco found himself trying not to smile at the way Harry’s face lit up as he laughed… then Draco remembered that he was under the cloak, so his mouth widened into a grin as they exited the Room of Requirement, on their way to the Eighth Year Common Room.
Since the number of students for the Eighth Year was actually quite small, it was two people per room. Pansy and Hermione decided to share a room - they had surprisingly become friends.
“As in, if the Dark Lord was after me,” he explained, trying to tread carefully, “for whatever reason… would you sacrifice me for him?”
He stared at the white streak in his hair before slowly turning to his bed, fixing it up before he could lie down on it.
Harry was too busy staring down at his hands to lip-read, helping him sign out the phrase. “Don’t get it confused with ‘I need help’. That goes in the opposite direction, like this,” he said, pulling Draco’s hands towards him. “Did that help?”
“There are more important things than being a poet, Harry,” he scoffed. “And I’m nowhere near good,” he gulped. He felt rather uncomfortable to talk about the poems he wrote, especially when they were about Harry. “But… uh… thanks.”
“I don’t know what to think,” he shook his head. “I just… want you to be prepared if the marriage actually… takes place.”
“Just… you look great,” Harry managed to say. Draco blinked before biting his lip, his pale cheeks turning a light shade of pink. Harry’s cheek went slightly pink too.
And so they went to Pansy’s dorm. “Alright, I’ll be asking you many questions to get information, answer as quickly as possible.” She made him sit down on her bed. “Take in a deep breath and-”
As he sat in that room by himself, hearing the chatter and laughter from downstairs, Harry realized he hadn’t felt this alone since he was eleven years old.
He put up his middle finger, to which Harry laughed. “Seeing as you’re not lying about being deaf, I don’t think you’re lying about… You-Know-Who either. So don’t you think you should be learning your spells?”
Harry slowly got off Draco, wiping his tears away as he sniffled slightly, looking up at the taller male. “Draco, let me be there for you,” Harry whispered softly, taking a hold of Draco’s hand.
Draco clenched his fists, chewing on his bottom lip - all he wanted was to see Harry. But it seemed like that was too much to as for. “Really, now?” said Draco in a firm annoyed tone, “I think it’s best if I listen to my mother.”
“Harry? Harry, are you even listening?” Hermione asked, snapping him out of his daze. “Are you still on about Draco being suspicious?” She said with an annoyed expression on her face as she turned to look at Draco, who now shot a glare at her as well.
Closeby, Draco was playing with his food again. “Is it too soon for a second date?” He blurted suddenly, though quietly so only Pansy could hear him. Pansy laughed slightly.
“Oh, you know me, I’m perfect,” she grinned. “How’s your Potions store? I’ve been meaning to visit!”
Looking over to the group that seemed to be politely talking, Harry pursed his lips, then squeezed in beside Hermione, who was the furthest away from Draco in the circle they were standing it.
“I’ve been studying with someone the past few weeks,” he blurted, holding his gaze to the ceiling, too embarrassed to even look at Pansy. “And my whole opinion on them is changing.”
Luckily, the two hid it quite well. Arthur Weasley, who was staring at Draco and Harry, nodded. “Interesting, interesting. Well, congratulations.”
“Well… I don’t see a reason to. It was given as a gift, was it not?” Draco asked in a defensive tone. He looked down at Harry, who looked at him as if he didn’t believe him one bit. “Shut up.”
Draco rolled his eyes and took the basket from Harry. “How long has your arm been hurting for? Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Harry, dear, could you help me out with setting the table?” Molly called from the kitchen, and Harry quickly got up and went as asked, flashing a smile at her as he started helping her out with setting the table.
“Exactly! Everything’s still going to be in stock. Come on then, boys,” she nudged the two. Groaning, the two followed after. Hermione had grown her hair out to just below her shoulders and from what Harry could see, she was happy with Ron. They bickered now and then, but it was usual for them to quickly move past it.
“Why didn’t you come to me sooner?” Harry asked as he kissed his cheek. “As if I’d let you break up with me over this. I guess we’ll have to be more careful. How did Snape even find out?”
“Talk it out,” Harry repeated with a scoff, still staring at Draco. “Yeah, I really don’t think so.”
“Stop blaming yourself for the Sectumsempra spell,” he mumbled. “Seriously. It was my fault. It clearly said ‘for enemies’. And at that moment… I thought you were my enemy.”
I can think about,” Harry snapped, standing up and towering over her. “Can’t you just leave us alone? Haven’t you done enough?”
Draco pulled Molly Weasley into a hug. “Thank you,” He whispered softly, “but I didn’t get you anything, and-”
Before he knew it, Lucius had his wand out. “What do you know? You’re a lowlife. You’re probably only with my son to get his money.”
“Why would someone go abroad suddenly?” he asked, face flushed. “I just… I wished he would send me a letter to say goodbye. Maybe… even talked to me one last time. I… I wanted a goodbye. End whatever our relationship was on a proper note. I know that’s stupid, since that… it was me who hurt us, both of us…”
“D-Draco, stop,” Harry whispered softly. “Draco, I said stop!” Harry suddenly bellowed, pushing the other off of him, unable to calm his breathing. “Just… just leave me alone!”
“Oh, Merlin, do you seriously do this every Saturday?” Harry asked them as he shut the book he was reading. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances and turned to look at Harry, not saying anything. Hermione clutched the dress in her hands as she rolled her eyes at Ron.
Harry realized it was probably not a good idea to talk to Draco, but before he could walk away, the door opened and Draco stood there, staring at Harry.
There was silence for a few seconds, as a shaking Harry lowered his hand. The professor that had been teaching the Dark Arts lesson walked in immediately and somehow managed to get the Boggart away and back into the classroom.
“Honestly, you know how hard it was for me to push your hand away without Snape noticing? Merlin, I wanted to push you to the ground but I, of course, couldn’t.”
no me and Harry anymore! Why can’t you understand that?” he practically shouted. “I’m married, Pansy! This isn’t a joke! I gave him his chance and he didn’t take it. Why can’t you just accept his decision?”
“You need any clearing up on those pages?” Harry asked, leaning forward and scanning the page. The other shook his head and he nodded. “Alright. I’m just finishing up a Potions essay.”
“Wait, Draco!” But before Harry could even finish his sentence, Draco had already left and he was long gone by the time Harry got out of the broom closet. Harry sighed. He knew that something was definitely up with Draco.
He immediately stood up and left the Hall, Draco following a few minutes later. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances when Harry practically ran out of the Hall.
“Pansy,” Draco groaned. Pansy quickly got up and walked to where they were. Harry slightly hid behind Draco.
Draco gently used his hand to tilt Harry’s head upwards, his platinum hair falling into his eyes. “Nothing has to change,” he shook his head.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Not that I would be complaining, I think there would be a problem if all of them love me as you do,” Draco said, snickering slightly. “Well, I am quite an attractive man, but, I don’t think I’d want all of the Weasley family to lo-”
Luna skipped off to class, taking her sweet time as she did so, her shoes in her hands. Harry simply chuckled before quickly going to his first class.
Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, before shrugging. “It’s more just a dinner party… It had been a while since we’d seen everyone. Besides, we needed an excuse to get you here. You haven’t come to visit us once!”
As the three made their way to their first class, Potions, Ron and Hermione exchanged glances when they heard Draco call Harry’s name.
“Obviously, I’ll go with him,” Astoria smiled. “I’ve always wanted to stay in America anyway. I think it’ll be good to get away from Malfoy Manor. Mr. Malfoy can be a bit… overwhelming.”
The poems to him, however, had stopped. It was an insufferable, Friday morning, but the hope that they would be meeting in the evening to study gave him a shred of excitement, and it was enough to work with amidst the chatter of his friends that he couldn’t possibly join. They were all talking way too fast, and it felt like they were having three conversations at once.
“I was only curious of what you were up to! I knew you had changed when I saw you on the train. I had to see.” Harry explained without thinking. Their eyes locked for a few moments before Draco cleared his throat.
Harry picked up the quill, dipping it in ink, putting an arm over Draco’s shoulder, trying to reach the paper and quickly writing. “Hmm?” he hummed, showing the blond, who was trying to keep his breathing steady as his heart beat sped up.
When they reached, he carefully let Harry off the broom, then took off his blindfold. “Whoa,” he breathed, looking over to Draco, still holding onto his hand. “Draco!” he stepped forward on the cliff, looking out at the golden sky. The sun was rising. “Now I’m not mad that you made me wake up so early!”
“Oh, fuck off!” Harry snapped as he slammed his hand against the steering wheel. “I swear you cheated.”
Pansy smirked, but she had no time to say anything in reply because Slughorn started off the lesson.
“Harry, don’t just-” Draco, who had just exited the Room of Requirement, was stunned when he saw himself standing in front of Harry. He slowly hid behind the wall, peeking his head out to see what was going on.
Hermione walked to their table and set Harry’s textbooks down. “Draco’s totally worried. You can completely see it on his face. This’ll get him to talk to Harry for sure!” Hermione told Pansy somewhat excitedly. Harry was barely listening, he was more focused on trying to focus which was barely working.
“Well, then, rule seven: you need to start actually combing your hair. I mean, what the hell is this, Potter?”
Many thoughts were running through Harry’s mind, but there was one that hurt him the most. It was as if someone had reached out, cut open his chest, and ripped his heart right out.
Sorry it took me so long to update! It's been a busy week. I have loads of school work and my birthday was a few days ago too ^^
Draco kept his eyes on Pansy, who was trying not to laugh. “Fuck you,” he mouthed, his body tensed. He cleared his throat, dumping some food onto his plate, almost dropping the serving spoon when Harry reached past him for a glass of champagne. He smelled… the same, but different. It was the same, comfortable scent that made him feel at home, but mixed with cheap cologne, it seemed.
“It helps me not cry,” he whispered, voice hoarse, but there were tears streaming down his face. “I was afraid of this, Draco. This happening to you, or to Hermione, or Ron. I thought it would be fine. That I could stop it from happening.”
“Oh, and,” Harry set down his fork, “I… want to go to the cliff. Please. I know you said you're busy, but...”
“This is supposed to be a hate poem,” Draco pointed out. “About these two people bickering and arguing all the time.”
“I don’t have the strength to fight with you, Harry, so please,” Draco shook his head, his eyes glistening with tears. He took out his wand, his hands trembling, wiping his face furiously - as if he was ashamed to be crying. “Stay safe for me.”
“Alright, so I don’t really know what Malfoy likes, but I got my favorite,” Ron said, handing Harry a paper plate that had a freshly made waffle with chocolate syrup, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. Pansy stared down at Draco who had a faraway look in his eyes as he stared at the ground, slightly confused as to why he seemed so upset.
“Accept? Merlin, I accepted that long ago. I was talking about how I accepted that I’m mad at Draco and I don’t think we’re going to get back together,” Harry muttered with another sigh.
“Oh, yes… He left around this time last year without a letter or anything. Closed up the shop and was gone. He sends occasional letters sometimes. All I know is that he’s somewhere in America.”
The wedding had made him feel worse. He had allowed his mind to go to a place he had never thought of before. An image of him and Draco having a wedding of their own popped into his mind. It eased the pain in his heart a little bit, only to be reminded just how impossible that was.
Draco took many steps back, staring at Harry. “I can’t be with you anymore,” he said, cutting off Harry. He had to say it as quickly as possible. He looked away from Harry as soon as he noticed the smile fading, and the expression of utter grief-stricken smeared across his face.
“You… used to make a specific face when your scar started hurting. Besides, I don’t think a headache has ever been that painful to you before.”
“You don’t need to,” his voice was shaky, following Harry’s gaze. “It’s pretty obvious.” He rolled up both of his sleeves. “No Dark Mark here, but do you want to inspect the rest of my body, too?”
Harry couldn’t help but feel so overwhelmed. Along with his unexplained feelings for Draco, he was getting visions of the Dark Lord, and was barely able to communicate with anyone. He was quite grateful for being deaf during the holidays. It gave him an excuse not to speak to anyone.
He actually felt fine for once. Everything in his life seemed to be balanced, and he was pretty happy about it. He had Ron and Hermione, he had Draco. For once, he didn’t feel as if anything was wrong in his life.
“But it’s funny, isn’t it?” Blaise pestered, realizing he seemed to be hitting a nerve. “The bloody git can’t even hear us talking about him one feet away. He’s a bit of an idiot-”
“Oh, I really have to thank you. Draco was so unhappy until you came along, and now that you’re here, he really does seem happier-”
“I just said, that’s interesting,” Hermione said. “Look, Harry, it’s really obvious that Draco isn’t-”
“Yes… you have.” Ginny said, a weird twinkle in her eye that she didn’t notice. “You’ve always… been here… for me.”
“Don’t worry about it,” she said, going over and pulling him into a hug. “You take care of yourself, alright? And stop by next week, if you can.”
“Worth the risk,” Harry echoed, nodding, as if he understood now. He reached into his pocket, taking out a small box and slamming it on the desk forcefully. “No, I suppose it’s not.”
“Trust me, Potter, I really wouldn’t come to you for anything if I had a choice,” he rolled his eyes. “Don’t think you’re some bigshot or something.”
“Anyways, I hinted that we would have a second date and he said that maybe we would dance on the second date. I said I hated dancing and he told me that we should try out dancing for the next date. So, we slowed dance.” Draco ranted. It felt good to talk about it to Pansy, he had kept in the feeling of excitement he got every time he thought of Harry and now he could let it out.
“To what? More of your bullshit? For all I know, you’ve been playing me this whole time,” Harry snapped, “as more Death Eater work.”
“Harry,” his voice cracked slightly. He reached forward and took his hand, gulping. “I’m sorry you’ve had to go through something like that.”
The week was slow, and Harry didn’t know if he should’ve been grateful for that or not. While he couldn’t wait for Friday, he was deeply dreading Saturday. It was a moment of truth; or a test he had to pass, except he had brought it upon himself.
Draco would be able to quickly sneak out and get his wand and luggage and leave without his father spotting him - just getting out of his room was a problem, as Lucius has locked it before he left.
“The thing is, Harry, you don’t even hang out with us much anymore. The past few weeks you would ditch us to see what Malfoy’s up to, and now you just seem distant.” Hermione admitted. Harry blinked and turned to face Ron, who was nodding along to what Hermione was saying.
She elbowed him in the ribs. “What have you been doing that makes you too busy to hang out with your
“Of course,” Harry said reassuringly. He started drawing circles on the back of Draco’s hand with his index finger. By now he was right beside Draco, almost on top of him.
“I think you’re ahead of me in WSL now,” he said, and the two exchanged a small smile. “Anyway, he can do whatever he likes. He’s a coward, really. The worst he could do is learn more insults in sign language.”
Harry, who hadn’t noticed that Draco was there, jumped slightly when he heard him speak, looking up. Harry’s eyes widened as he quickly wiped his tears away. “Draco, I…” He didn’t know what to say. What could he do? Apologize for his deepest, darkest fear was Draco being evil and not loving him this whole time? “The Boggart came out of nowhere, and-”
“Uh… pardon?” Harry asked. A confused Draco looked up at Snape who was looking at him. Snape gave Draco a stern look before turning to Harry again.
“Bullshit,” Draco whispered, “You know the Boggart’s the same. Whether you’re prepared for it or not.”
“Thank you,” Harry sighed, moving to sit on the bed. Draco, who still had his hands on him, followed. “I wouldn’t want to be caught in the first place I’ve been hiding. That’d be quite a failure.”
Harry, excited, practically grabbed it from his hands and tore it open, revealing a small box, his eyes widening as he looked up at Draco. There were two, shiny gold rings inside.
“I see what you’re trying to do here, and I’m not going to fall for it,” Hermione huffed, looking away. Pansy rolled her eyes, continuing to pester Hermione, poking her and teasing her.
“I think it’s cute,” said a dreamy voice from behind them. Luna Lovegood was smiling at Harry and Draco who seemed to still be insulting each other’s hair. “Besides, you don't need to worry. No one even pays attention to what they have to say to each other anymore. If they do, I think there’d be a problem. I mean, look at them.”
His father’s cold eyes bored into his soul. There was complete silence, until finally, he spoke in his usual icy tone. “Don’t ask me such ridiculous things, Draco,” he said finally and left rather swiftly.
“Love?!” Harry exclaimed, receiving a few looks from fellow Gryffindors that were within hearing distance.
“That’s okay,” Hermione said, watching as Ron put his arms around Harry tightly. “You weren’t obligated to say yes to him. If you don’t think it’s a good idea for you two to be together, that’s perfectly acceptable.”
“Oh,” Draco cleared his throat awkwardly. “I… didn’t think you would care. I’ve just been sick. Besides, haven’t I written you enough poems already?”
He looked at her, somewhat confused. He didn’t know how much Draco had told her, so decided to play dumb just in case. “Malfoy… wants to see-”
“Your mother is so lovely,” Harry said with a sigh as he shut the door behind them, looking around Draco’s large room, plopping himself down on the bed, too tired to look through Draco’s stuff in his room. “She’s so nice… I really wasn’t expecting that.”
“Draco, I want you to forget about your father, okay? I used to try and distract myself with other things until I was able to address the issue without it upsetting me. I know that isn’t quite a helpful or the right way to go about things, but… it’s New Year’s Eve, and the rest are also going to start asking what’s wrong, and… and I don’t want you feeling like this, especially today…”
“I told her everything. She told me she would help make it seem like I was marrying her. My father signed a contract to get rid of the curse on my wedding day. It didn’t explicitly say that I had to be marrying Astoria.”
Most nights spent together were now silent. Harry didn’t have to explain that he was having a bad day. He would usually take his hearing aids out when he was feeling down, keeping to himself or leaning on Draco, who didn’t mind. What mattered to both of them was the time being spent together
The second night, not so much. He checked his watch. It was nearing five. He had barely been able to sleep the entire night. The sun was starting to rise, so he decided to get up. Ron was snoring soundly and Hermione was passed out. She was probably exhausted from the stress. She tended to take on a lot of pressure from situations.
“You would, if you treated me as you usually would. I’m your friend, ‘Mione, not some charity work. I need your support, but I don’t need you to be my lifeline.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry. “Hello,” He finally replied, slowly looking away. It hadn’t occurred to him that Harry was drunk - sure, he registered the strange behavior but didn’t think too much of it.
“Draco, don’t,” Narcissa warned, frowning at her son, who was frowning too. She hadn’t seen a single smile on his face since his fifth year. “I’ll go get the owl.”
“I tried fixing your hearing aids,” he sighed, bringing them up on the table. “I still feel horrible about what happened. I tried every spell I could, but…”
But he was already walking away, as his Dark Mark burned, as his insides lurched, as he tried holding back what felt like a storm of tears.
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked, now frowning too. “You seem upset. Is it because of Draco? You can go to him, you know. He’s probably sitting where Pansy was. Pansy, which compartment are you sitting in?”
In shock, he stared at the other for a second, then punched Blaise back. The two went back and forth until Pansy finally stood up, unable to take it any longer. “Knock it
Draco was seated in between Pansy and Blaise, staring at the food on his plate but not eating. Harry noticed that the food on his plate was untouched.
Hermione and Ron went into their usual bickering session and Harry only half-listened, finishing off his breakfast faster than them as usual and standing up to get to class. He had fifteen minutes till class started.
“You must end it, Draco. If The Dark Lord finds out, you will be in big trouble, and so will your family, and so will I. And so will Harry.”
Both of them said it at the exact same time, at the exact same moment, with the same look in their eyes.
“Later,” he sighed. “I know she’s going to ask me a billion questions if I tell her. I need to prepare for that kind of thing.”
Hermione was glad to see Harry picking himself up, but she couldn’t help feeling sad that Draco and Harry hadn’t cleared things up between them.
The silver-eyed boy found himself unable to stop smiling. “We could try right now. It’s just you and me here.”
“The first class we have is Defence Against the Dark Arts with Snape,” Hermione stated, before listing out all of the classes they had. Harry focused on his food, only half paying attention to Hermione when a dreamy voice behind him spoke.
“We can get through it, can’t we?” his voice cracked as he took a step forward. “We always make it through. I don’t… I don’t want to marry her, Harry. I want you. Only you. If we could try this again, we could…”
The two didn’t want to break the uncomfortable silence, so they decided to stay there like that for a few moments.
Draco and Harry Apparated together in front of Malfoy Manor, and Draco took a hold of Harry’s hand, holding it tightly. “You’ll be okay,” He said softly.
“Harry, we should switch now,” Hermione said as she walked out of the tent. She took in a deep breath, sitting down beside Harry who was staring into the blazing flames in front of him. “You okay?” asked Hermione.
“We’re like… acquaintances, but not quite, you know?” Draco answered absentmindedly. Harry looked at him a bit strangely and he gulped. “I just mean… I wouldn’t treat you like an enemy anymore. It’d be like going back to square one. And while I don’t think you’d ever want to be friends with me, I’d like to think that we’re on neutral terms now.”
“Ah yes,” Draco said as he quickly got out his quill and ink, “dinner with the Dark Lord and the Greengrass’s. Quite fun. It’s for sure going to be a party in here!”
Draco pushed him to the floor, and a huge gasp came from everyone that was watching. Blaise fell against a table then onto the floor. For a moment, it seemed as if he wasn’t going to get back up, but he stood up quickly, punching Draco in the face.
He sighed. “It isn’t exactly a huge emergency. It’s just… um…”She frowned, walking closer to him. “What’s up?"
He stood up, scoffing. “Of course you need something. Why was I stupid enough to think that you actually were sorry for once? Who am I kidding? You’re a Malfoy. All you’re made of is cowardice and cruelty.”
Harry jolted to the side on the carriage, gasping loudly. Everyone who was on the carriage - Hermione, Ron, and Pansy - raised an eyebrow at Harry who awkwardly cleared his throat.
The practice went well; apart from Harry making a few mistakes here and there. The team forgave him for it; after all, Harry had taken a long break from Quidditch. Everyone went into the Changing Room after practice.
“You kept count?” Harry said as they exited the arcade. They had played almost every game, from gun games to air hockey, anything which didn’t require them to be too close to each other.
“I was…” he looked down at the piece of paper, quickly picking it up. Draco snatched it from him quickly. “You… I mean… I was just trying to write a poem for you. Since you always write me ones.”
As if on cue, Hedwig came in flying through the open window. Draco smiled again, taking the letter from the owl, who seemed to like him.
“I would like to speak to you,” Snape said, motioning for Draco to follow him. It was Monday evening and everyone was going to dinner. “Do you have any idea why you’re here?”
“Wow, Potter, just when I thought you couldn’t get more stupid,” Draco said with venom in his voice. “Are you sure your glasses even work?”
“If you-” he stopped, taking in a deep breath. “I understand if you are afraid, Draco,” he said in a calmer tone. “But this isn’t something to be afraid of. You’ll soon understand what opportunities I’m granting us.”
“You know… I could feel the pain he was feeling… it was weird, but I could, I swear I could. Do you believe me?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded slightly. “I just… I feel so te-terrible…”
Draco was still very confused as to what was going on, but Pansy wouldn’t let him question anything.
Lucky for Harry, he now was able to process the wand movement, quickly understand what spell was being used, then able to counter it before the spell could hit him, or he would duck out of the way and then think of a spell. Draco thought it would be more efficient to be able to counter the spell as quickly as possible.
“Shh!” she put a finger to her lips, adjusting her dress as she stood outside the bathroom door. Even Ron seemed a bit excited to be eavesdropping on their conversation.
“I wouldn’t call it stalking. I was just worried about you. You’ve seemed a bit weird lately.” Harry told him. “Uh, you told me you had to study? What are you doing right now?” Harry asked, finally paying attention to the things around Draco.
Draco put a hand to his left cheek, where his father had hit him. He bit his lip. He was used to his father doing that, hitting him, locking him in his room - but this time it just felt worse than it usually did. Perhaps because Draco knew that if he didn’t leave now, he wouldn’t see Harry. Not for a long while, at least.
“You should’ve seen the look on Malfoy’s face. He looked so smug. I bet he’s boasting about it now,” he chewed on his lip anxiously, then stood up. “I’m going to bed.”
Draco looked around. He had no time to go to the bathroom to hide. So he jumped on Harry’s bed and closed the curtains around the bed right as Ron walked in.
Draco turned around when he saw someone behind him in the mirror. His face was pale, his lips were dry, his face was streaked with tears and his eyes looked lost. As a natural instinct, he immediately got out his wand and pointed it at Harry.
Shutting his bedside light off, despite himself, he thought of his boyfriend, with his stupid smile and his stupid hair, because at the very least, he had him for one more week, and he was grateful for even that.
“Hey, Harry.” Draco murmured, sitting down at the end of the couch. Harry was lying down. He now put his feet on Draco’s lap as he continued reading. After the conversation with Snape, Draco was not able to think straight.
“I can’t, really. I got some work to do right after. I’m terribly sorry, love, but results are on Monday, I need to finish up essays for extra credit.”
Why did his heart beat abnormally fast every time they touched, why did he find himself aching for more? He was Draco Malfoy and he was Harry Potter. They weren’t supposed to be friends, let alone…
Just then, Draco heard a faint tapping against the window. He slowly turned around and saw an owl tapping its beak against the window. He slowly opened it and let the owl come in, realizing that it was Dodger, the Malfoy family’s owl.
“It’s… okay,” he replied, surprised by how apologetic he was being. “Seriously, you’re making me feel bad for pointing it out.”
He pulled away to catch his breath, staring at the man in front of him. “Do you really not like my hair gelled back?”
Sorry for the inconsistent posting but I want to write when I feel that I am able to produce the best quality, not just rush to write whatever so I can keep view numbers up. I want the best quality for this fic because I truly love it so much. I hope you guys can understand. Some days I just don't feel the writing is going to be the best I can do, so I take breaks. However, I'll try my best to be consistent.
The train ride this year was refreshing. Harry found himself taking in every sound that he could - the muffled chatter from other carriages, the train. Harry had even missed the sound of Ron’s loud chewing.
Lie. In fifth year, the night after he kissed Cho, he had dreamed that it was Draco who he was kissing. He played it off as a nightmare rather than a dream, and never told anyone about it, and pushed it to the back of his brain.
“Just ignore him,” Hermione mumbled, continuing to walk. Ron nodded. The two really weren’t in the mood to see Draco and Harry fight again. “Yesterday already caused somewhat of a crowd.”
The image of Harry’s teary eyes came into his mind, and he felt regret flood through his chest. It bit at him, almost like a stabbing pain. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt Harry again, and that was exactly what he did. He almost wanted to go to Harry and tell him that they could be together, but he knew he couldn’t. It was too risky for both of them.
Harry was right on top of Draco. He quickly sat up. Both Draco and Harry’s eyes went down to Draco’s left arm. The sleeves were rolled up, so his Dark Mark was visible. Harry moved and sat right in front of his arm so nobody would see it, especially Ron and Hermione.
“No, Draco, I need to make sure I know everything if I’m going to have to fight Voldemort,” he sighed, sitting up in his seat. “I just wish this… wouldn’t have to be me sometimes. And I just wish you wouldn’t have to be on their side.”
Harry found himself exiting the castle and going near the lake, where the entrance of the Forbidden Forest was. He entered and walked into the forest. He remembered the last time he had walked through here, he was with Draco.
“Take good care of him,” She whispered after leaning in, “He’s such a sweetheart. Don’t let him get hurt.”
“What? Draco’s a... Death Eater? But Harry said…” Hermione started but then sighed. “It all makes sense in a way now. The way they were acting... I saw Harry carry a huge jar filled with this weird sludge once. That was for the mark, wasn’t it?”
Harry simply shrugged, pulling Draco into a kiss, wrapping his arms to hold Draco up, their tongues dancing in each other’s mouth as Harry slowly moved towards the desk table, setting Draco down on the table, starting to kiss his neck, biting at it to leave a mark.
“Draco, if we are the ones who hand over Potter to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven,” said Lucius, before pushing Draco forwards towards the boy who was kneeling, his deformed face making him unrecognizable.
Draco had been on his bed, staring up at the ceiling - all he could think of was how Harry. He felt terrible. He had promised Harry he would be at Hogwarts - Draco just wanted to see Harry’s face. He felt as if he was going mad. Draco slowly stood up and walked to the door, hesitantly trying to turn the doorknob - he had been trying every hour since he had been thrown into the room.
After a moment of awkward silence, Draco decided it was better to just pretend nothing happened. “Um… alright,” He started to sign. “I’ll brew the potion. You tell me the ingredients.”
“I’m fine, just… God, I didn’t expect to see him today. I didn’t… mentally prepare for that,” he said, drinking the last of his champagne, setting the glass down to the side. Taking in a deep breath, he centered himself, then nodded. “Okay, let’s just… pretend we haven’t seen him yet. You know, he might not even come here.”
“What?” Harry asked after a few moments. His chest felt heavy, and he was finding it hard to take in. “You’re kidding, right?”
“Um… I suppose since the end of sixth year,” she said, looking down at her feet. “We didn’t say anything because we were afraid it might interfere with your relationship. Soulmates aren’t exactly something that should be forced.”
“If you had just let me fucking explain, you would have known already!” Draco snapped at him. “Go ahead, Harry. Hex me. Curse me. Use whatever spell you want. You know you want to. I’m on Voldemort’s side, aren’t I? I deserved to be treated like trash.”
He quickly rolled up the paper and sent it off with Hedwig before could overthink it. He knew it seemed clingy in a way, but he couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help but feel something was wrong.
Pansy pulled the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them, walking after Harry, who was now at the entrance of the Gryffindor Common Room. He stopped right at the portrait.
“I’m guessing you don’t want to tell me, then?” she said playfully, handing the shirt that she had folded to Harry. He gratefully put it into his trunk neatly. She moved on to the next shirt. The two of them were now just folding Harry’s clothes. “Is she pretty?”
“How have you been?” he asked as he sat down beside Draco, deciding it was probably time to stop beating around the bush.
Was loving someone a choice, or was it this dread that crept up on you while you slept? Loving Draco wasn’t dreadful. It was something Harry was afraid of. He was afraid of what he’d do if he lost him. But love wasn’t supposed to make you feel afraid, was it? It was relieving to realize that he wasn't the only one afraid. And maybe that's what made him tap his watch three times as a confirmation.
Harry constantly looked over to Draco. He knew it was stupid to approach him. They’d probably just end up arguing again. And Harry hated that. One thing he couldn’t stand more than arguing with Draco was when he could feel Draco’s pain as they argued. Which was exactly how Harry felt. Harry felt like he was being overdramatic, or just imagining it - but it had been true. It was almost as if Harry could feel his pain.
“Merlin, just forget it. I’m leaving,” he announced, turning to the door, but she quickly stood in front of the door. “Move out of the way, Pansy. I don’t even want to look at you right now.”
“How it’s possible to be so attracted to someone’s face when their personality is so shitty,” he responded. Draco pushed him back a little, and they stared at each other in silence until they burst into laughter, moving to kiss each other again.
Draco watched him, frowning, then took a careful step forward, placing his hand on his shoulder. “Do you need to… um… talk about it?” he signed sloppily after walking into Harry’s line of vision.
Ginny was grinning from ear to ear. She slowly leaned up, to kiss Harry on the lips. Harry, who was daydreaming while staring at her, didn’t notice.
The next Saturday was almost just as the dull as the last. It was Ron’s birthday, so it was definitely more interesting than the Saturday before.
“Just seems like an ego issue to me,” Harry shrugged, smirking. “Did I hurt your ego, love? It’s okay. I can shake your hand now if you like,” he said, holding out his hand, letting out a laugh when Draco, defeated, simply smacked his arm away.
. And a token of love from me. You’re in the shower right now, so think of this as a gift… I love you so much, you know that? Too much, honestly. I even feel happy listening to you sing in the shower like you are right now. Well, anyway, this is how videos work, so… any time you want to see me and I can’t be there… here I am.”
He quickly attached it to a school owl (which offended Hedwig deeply) and it speedily went to the Hall. Not even five minutes later, the owl came back with a quick response:
Harry breathed in slowly, trying to understand her perspective. He had to be patient. “I know. I know it’s selfish of me, and I know it’s a huge risk, but…” he stared down at the watch on his wrist. “It’s killing me a little bit. Not being with him.”
Harry and Draco, from what they decided a while back, don’t really do big gifts. They do… poems and small things that remind them of one another, like the charm bracelet Harry got last year.
sorry,” he mocked, then rested his head flat against the floor. “I can feel the beat thumping into my head.”
“There was an article that talked about how I moved to America, so… it’s surprising what kind of things can land you in the newspaper.”
“No, Harry, you can’t see Draco because he isn’t-” Pansy paused when she realized what Harry had said. “I didn’t see you looking around the train. How’d you know?” Pansy and Hermione quickly looked over at each other, exchanging glances.
Draco kissed him back, shutting his eyes. He lost himself for a moment, then quickly pulled away. “No- I mean, yes, but… now you’re just turning me on, Harry.” He placed his hands on Harry’s hips, who was grinding on him. “So much for trying to be honest with you.”
“No, no. I was just a bit worried, in case I hurt you in some way. But you’re okay, right? Not too tiring?”
“Oh, no, nothing like that, love,” she sighed. “I just wanted to know… did you actually intend to kill Dumbledore that night? Snape told me about your hesitation. He said it must be due to your inexperience, however… I know you haven’t been a perfect boy, but… you’re not a killer.”
Short chapter, but as I wrote it, it felt right to stop with Draco and Harry in each other's arms <3
“I said we should mess with Potter again. We can do it more discreetly if you’re worried about getting into trouble,” he said. “What do you say?”
But nothing helped Harry’s fever. Not even a strong potion that Madame Pomfrey requested Slughorn to make for him.
When Draco had finally come up with something, he looked up, opening his mouth to speak, but no words came out, not when he saw the look on Harry’s face when realization hit him.
Harry took in a sharp breath and slowly turned back to the table, sitting down and starting to eat. Around ten minutes later, Harry was almost done with his meal when he turned again, just to check if Draco was there. Sure enough, by now, Draco was sat in between Blaise and Pansy, picking at his food. He seemed to be listening to what Pansy was saying.
“Splendid,” Harry said, sitting up, annoyed that he was disturbed. “What the fuck does it take to get some alone time around here?”
She knew how much Draco honestly hated being referred to as Malfoy, but she would call him this on certain occasions when she felt he was being too soft, or when he needed reminding that he was a Malfoy. This had been mainly during times when they were with family.
“But it felt like something changed, and something did. It was my father. He started forcing Mother to see his perspective, forced her to join the Death Eaters… after that, Mother had changed. Father had always been cold, but now she was too. I felt disconnected from her. After joining Hogwarts, I felt a little better. I had Slytherin friends, I had a cute enemy, I was busy with studies. Forgetting home was easy. That’s how it was till the fifth year.
“You would be too if you fought with your best friend,” he answered, yanking his hand away from Harry. His touch burnt, but unlike a scalding, sizzling wound, he found himself desperate for more. His fingers were soft, warm, gentle - caring. “Thanks, but you don’t need to worry about me.”
“Yes, it’s not like Voldemort’s trying to kill me or anything. And it’s not as if you’re helping him do so.”
“Well, of course, dear! Why wouldn’t I be?” Molly asked with a smile. “Well, you know, I always had a sort of hunch. Why did it take so long for you to tell us? You should know we’d all accept you.”
Draco slowly sat up. He had no appetite, nor did he want to leave his room. He looked over at his bedside table, surprised to see a book out and open, left on the table. Draco didn’t remember doing such a thing. He slowly reached out and took a hold of the book, closing the book to see the title.
“It’s okay. You don’t necessarily need to say goodbye right this second. You still have time,” Narcissa told him, picking up the piece of paper that had been torn by how hard Draco had scribbled on it. “How about we go out for lunch, hm?”
The agreement between Draco and Harry was that they would continue to insult each other, but keep their friends out of it, in the risk of saying something that could possibly start something. That way, they were making it believable enough without causing issues between the friend groups.
He quickly sat up when he heard a knock on his door. Lucius came striding in without waiting for a response. “What are you doing?” he asked. Draco sat up, confused. “Come, sit,” he patted the chair beside him. “I need to talk to you.”
And with a soft kiss - much that felt like goodbye to this moment, or whatever peace their relationship had left - Harry was walking away, an ache in his chest, because he knew for certain things would never be the same again. He opened the piece of paper, which revealed a poem. It was the first one in months.
Harry shook his head. “Nothing makes sense anymore. I had… I had a plan,” he whispered. “It was a sloppy plan, but… it made sense to me. I was happy just knowing that the plan would work out, but… now I know it won’t.”
“Oh, right, you can’t hear her crying,” she rolled her eyes, then subtly nudged her chin in Lavender’s direction. She was several seats down at the Gryffindor table, crying while being comforted by her friends, who gave Hermione a dirty look when they caught them staring. “They’re done.”
“Harry, calm down,” Draco whispered, seemingly unbothered by Harry’s outburst, “deep breaths, remember? Calm down, love.”
Harry hurried over to the door to leave when he heard footsteps on the other side. He turned to Dumbledore who waved his arm as if to tell Harry to come back. Harry did so. He stood a little far from Dumbledore.
“Are you kidding? With Ron and Hermione as friends, I don’t know why I didn’t go sooner. All they did was treat me like glass. Besides…” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “at least in America I don’t have to see your face on the newspaper.”
“Your task was to kill Dumbledore,” he said at once. “You were set to kill Dumbledore?” Silver eyes met green ones. Dumbledore took a step back; almost as if he had been waiting for Harry to break out of the bind.
Draco clutched his arm and Harry put a hand to his forehead. Both of them noticed the other in pain at the same time and scrambled over to each other, Harry put his hand on Draco’s Dark Mark and Draco gently using his index finger to massage Harry’s forehead.
He took Harry’s hand carefully, pursing his lips for a moment. “Always on your side. Always, love. This is just something I have to do to survive,” he said quietly, as if he was afraid anyone else would hear him. “And I hate every moment of it.”
“You wouldn’t let me do that; you’d force me to study until it’s drilled into my brain,” Harry replied in a soft tone, his eyes still shut, a smile twitching at his lips when he felt Draco stroking his hair.
“Harry,” he tried staying calm, but his eyes were already welled up. “I thought… you made your decision about me. About us.”
Astoria Greengrass was kissing Draco Malfoy roughly, her tongue dancing in his, smirking as she did so. No, that wasn’t the worst part.
“Sure, this is a color-changing spell, you won’t need it,” Blaise shrugged. “But it’d be rather embarrassing to fight the Dark Lord - since he’s supposedly back - when you can’t even pronounce your spells properly. Maybe you ought to just take your defe-”
“Hey Draco,” Pansy said, setting her book down as she continued to smirk. Harry bit his lip, unsure of what to do. Her eyes immediately went to the Gryffindor and Slytherin’s intertwined hands.
“I’m going,” he stood up, and Pansy burst into laughter, grabbing his hand, pulling him back down. He stared down at the WSL book in his hands, then looked back up at her. “Can you tell me something?”
Draco looked up at Harry. Of course. How could Draco fucking forget? He wanted to smash his own head against the wall. “Harry, I-”
I have many ideas left for this fan-fiction. The problem is, I don't have much time. But I don't know, if you really want me to finish this fanfic (which I feel I owe to Draco, Harry, myself and you), I will try my best. please comment below your opinion if you want to (which would be very much appreciated).
“Fuck off,” Harry whispered. “This is probably just a fucking relief for you than anything else. Stop with the fake tears.”
“I think we should break up.” Draco blurted. He didn’t mean to say that. Originally, he was going to tell Harry how Snape found out. Harry quickly sat up and put the book aside. Just by looking at Harry’s face, Draco could see what he had said was a huge mistake.
“Shut up, you suck at compliments,” Draco said, but both of them knew that Draco secretly loved it. They walked out of the dorm - holding hands - and into the Slytherin Common Room, where Pansy was seated, reading a book. She looked up and saw Harry and smirked as if she was expecting Harry to be with Draco.
Draco looked at her with a deadpan expression, shaking his head at her, but he couldn’t deny it. “...I dunno,” he said finally, chewing on the inside of his cheek nervously. But the answer was yes.
“Harry, it’s not about that,” Draco raised his voice, starting to grow somewhat impatient. “You and I could
Classes were starting again, and the first lesson they had on Monday morning was Defense Against the Dark Arts, where Harry and Draco had to sit beside each other.
But Draco simply ignored Harry calling his name, not even looking at him. He walked into the hallway and into his dorm, shutting the door, as well as using a different kind of spell to lock it. He couldn’t have Harry entering; he couldn’t have him getting too close. Draco, not even for a second, wanted to doubt his father’s words. He didn’t intend on finding out what the curse would to do Harry.
He opened his mouth to answer, but something had grabbed everyone’s attention. He followed their gaze.
“Harry, in a relationship like yours, shit can get pretty complicated. I’m not trying to make excuses for him or anything like that. I’m just trying to understand how to fix this. Are you close to making a decision?” she asked, sipping her hot cocoa.
The two stared at each other, unsure of what to say now. This was a new, strange territory. They seemed to be civil with each other, but it wasn’t as if they could say they were friends. No, they were a long way from friends. More like… acquaintances.
Draco figured that Harry still blamed himself for what happened. Maybe it was wrong of him to hide the scars for so long; it was bound to take a toll on Harry since he had moved past it.
Harry and Draco had not talked since their argument; and things were rather depressing. There were no poems written, none sent. Draco didn’t want to face how he was feeling, nor the fear that they would not be able to move past this.
Now that Harry thought about it… he looked around and noticed everyone in Platform 9 and 3/4 staring at him.
“Wouldn’t be normal for them if they weren’t arguing about something stupid,” Pansy replied as she walked up to the four along with Luna. Draco and Harry gasped dramatically before they shot everyone a look.
“If everything goes to plan, three months. I’ll be there for a few years at the least. Not sure if Astoria will stay with me the whole time. I mean, it’s not like she’d miss me or something,” he chuckled, his smile fading when he noticed Harry was staring down, eyes widening when he realized he was crying. “What’s wrong?”
“Spectacular,” Draco replied, not looking back to Harry. He wondered why Harry was talking to him - and pretending as if they hadn’t argued, though he was slightly relieved. Draco had pushed the whole argument to the back of his mind so that he wouldn’t think about it. Bringing it up now probably wouldn’t be the best idea. “And you?” Draco added after a few moments, slowly turning to look at Harry.
“I love you too,” Harry whispered back. He had no idea who it was, nor whether or not he was dreaming or not. But his mind held a long-lasting hope that it was a certain boy with white hair and silver eyes.
“Well, yes, but why would I say anything? I hate to break it to you, but I didn’t do this. Although I’m sure you’ve been actively waiting for me so fuck something up between us,” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry.
“I should probably get back. You go in a few minutes to not raise suspicion,” Harry stated, standing up and moving towards the door, then turned around suddenly, his hand gripping on the handle of the door, opening his mouth to speak. Draco stared at him, practically urging him to give whatever just happened some sort of closure.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You only need to be here for ten minutes. Besides, I promised to buy you something in return, so stop complaining,” he turned to Harry, who nervously cracked his knuckles. “It’ll be fine, darling, I promise you. We’re not going to hurt you.”
“So, Draco, are you really going to America for a case?” Hermione spoke up, giving her two friends the side eye as they reached for the glasses of milk to have with the cookies Molly left for them as a snack.
“Umm… Draco, a word?” Hermione said, glancing over at Astoria. Nodding, he walked into what was probably Ron’s room. Shutting the door behind them, Hermione turned to Draco. “You
“Fuck off,” he rolled his eyes, but he was smiling, letting Draco’s hand rest on his face for a moment before the two awkwardly turned back to their work, realizing what had just happened.
“You’re being stupid,” Draco scolded. “How hard is it to remember the ingredients? Tell me. What ingredients do you need for a Wit-Sharpening potion?”
Harry tried putting his hand over where Draco was bleeding, to get it to stop, but he couldn’t. There were too many wounds.
“What?” Harry asked, putting his hands under Draco’s sweater, looking up at him. “I can’t stand myself sometimes?”
It was five a.m. on a Saturday, the middle of March. A month had passed and things for Harry had been growing tense, but he barely said any of it to Draco. This was mainly because he didn’t want him to worry, but also the fact that Draco was really the only distraction he had from all of it.
“Stop worrying,” Draco cut him off with an eye roll, though he was smiling (of course he loved how Harry was worrying about him), “I’m fine. Just tired today. Of course, you pick today to procrastinate and work frantically, so now I can’t relax either.”
“Right,” she said down near the foot of his bed, watching as he turned to lie on his back, staring up at the ceiling. “Why do you seem so stressed?”
Meanwhile, in another carriage, Pansy Parkinson sat down, almost regretting doing so because she knew she had walked in on one of Draco’s rants - but not just any rant. It was the twinkle in his eyes that appeared whenever he talked about Harry.
Harry opened his and smiled when he saw it was a sweater with the letter ‘H’ on it. “Thank you!” He said, quickly pulling it on and giving Molly a hug, before turning to Draco. “Hey Draco, we should- Draco?”
“For the love of God, what?” Draco finally responded, looking up from his book, an annoyed expression on his face as he looked over to Harry, who was pouting as he stared at Draco, his arms folded. “What?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s hips. “I’ve missed you too,” he replied. “I was on patrol duty. Just had to check areas not to find you per se, but at least those on your side. I genuinely didn’t think you’d be here. And don’t worry, I’m sure no one else would think to look here. I won’t tell them I was here. I’ve been looking in places I thought you wouldn’t be, but… here we are.”
He simply shook his head and made his way to the Gryffindor table, afraid if they looked at each other a moment too long they would burst into laughter. It was incredibly funny to throw insults at each other when they knew they didn’t mean it.
“Don’t you dare fucking say that. No sentence ends well if it starts like that,” Draco’s voice shaky, but firm at the same time. He was now stroking Harry’s hair holding him close.
When Draco received no response, he looked down, staring at Harry. The light from the fireworks was reflecting on Harry’s glasses, and Draco found himself unable to look away. The sight of Harry beaming as he stared up at the sky was utterly beautiful; Draco had no words to describe the way he was feeling.
“It hurts, it hurts!” He managed to say before he was hit with even harsher pain this time. Harry turned to see Draco’s Dark Mark. His whole hand was completely red and Harry could feel the sweat in Draco’s hand.
“I love being Draco with you,” he said softly. “Just Draco. Not Malfoy, not a family full of Death Eaters, not a follower. I love being your boyfriend.”
“Yeah, I thought I’d go over for dinner or something. But that was when we were still dating,” he put his hands in his pockets, awkwardly shuffling his feet.
“We have twenty minutes till breakfast,” Draco said with an eye roll, “why do you always wake up so late?”
“Hey, Malfoy isn’t here.” Ron pointed out. Hermione and Ron stared at each other for a few seconds before bursting into laughter.
She blinked in confusion, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “You don’t think Harry will say yes?”
The letter wasn’t long, but Harry wondered why it hurt him so much to read it. Maybe it was because it was so short. Hand trembling slightly, he chewed anxiously on his lip, looking over to the owl that seemed to be waiting for some sort of letter back.
“I think it would be more interesting for you to find out on your own,” Lucius said with a smirk. “Now, off you go. I want you to study hard for the rest of the year-”
Harry smiled slightly, “Thanks,” he said, sighing in relief. “I guess I never really, uh… thought about telling anyone. It was more just about being with Draco rather than telling anyone about it.”
“Hey,” he said, pushing Harry back gently so he could see his lips while he talked, keeping his hands on his face, “I’ll give the Muggles this game. It’s good, realistic, and- are you listening, Harry?”
Later on in the day, Ron accidentally ate chocolates that were meant for Harry and they had to go to Slughorn. And then, Ron got poisoned.
She rubbed her hand gently up and down his back. “You should experiment, you know. Go out with boys. See how it feels.”
Draco just smiled, knowing even if he spoke, it would be pointless. Harry couldn’t see nor hear him. Bringing out his broom, he nudged Harry, who put his hand out.
“Oh, I’m sure we can come up with something better,” Harry said, picking up the apple pie. “Do we have enough time to remake it?”
“Draco,” Harry muttered under his breath, looking up at the sky, the green skull with a serpent tongue, hanging right above the Hogwarts castle.
“That’s… more of a rule for yourself, Draco. Rule four: you have to understand that sometimes I don’t want to talk about my dreams.”
Draco and Harry jumped so suddenly that Harry had to lean against the table, and Draco hit his head against the wall, quickly pulling his pants up before Narcissa could walk in. Narcissa walked in, smiling as she set down the tray of hot tea, before looking up. She studied Draco’s messy hair and unbuttoned shirt, and the fresh hickey on his neck, before going to Harry who’s glasses were tilted, his shirt was half tucked and half untucked, and then taking in a deep breath.
He shook his head, turning his attention back to the fireplace. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. Much to their surprise, he spoke. “Yes,” he sighed, craning his head to look at them, “but I don’t want to talk about it. Okay?"
“Please, let’s just leave it at that,” Harry whispered in a hoarse voice with a whimper. Draco nodded. Harry leaned forward, and softly placed his lips on Draco’s, kissing him softly, gently, with love and with pain.
“Especially you,” Draco said with an eye roll, taking the waffle from Harry’s hands and starting to eat it. Harry stared at him, pouting, turning away and folding his arms. “Oh, come on, I was just joking!” Draco said when he noticed Harry pouting and being overdramatic. He pulled Harry to face him, pressing his lips on his and kissing him softly. Harry was happy to kiss him right back as their tongues danced in each other’s mouth.
“Tons,” Hermione said, taking his hand and dragging him to the drinks table. “Uh, here’s a glass-” She stopped talking as Harry grabbed the whole bottle itself and starting chugging it down. “Is everything okay?”
“You’re not forgiven,” Draco said with a smug look on his face. “Aren’t you too pretty to be a boy?”
“Looking for a way for you to get out of here,” muttered Draco as he looked around, a confused, searching look on his face.
Harry tore open the envelope, seeing his name on the decorative piece of paper. “Draco and Harry’s…” he looked up to see Draco down on one knee, far away from him, eyes glistening. “Draco…”
“Oh shoot, I think I left the Snitch out on the field,” Harry said, suddenly realizing. “You go ahead to dinner, Ron.”
“Could you not wake up the whole of Hogwarts? Thanks.” Pansy said annoyedly as she approached him. “It’s seven in the morning! What are you so hyped up about?”
Draco’s hair fell into his eyes as he gave Harry a long look. “...Merlin, you just reversed everything I had tried to do to hate you in the past few months. Harry, me being a Death Eater is something that
“Wait, someone was trying to get you to fall in love with them?” Draco asked, getting annoyed. “Who?”
“You didn’t?” Draco said. His hair fell into his eyes. Today he didn’t gel it back for the first time in two years, letting his brown streak be visible. “Anyway, I think it’s safe to say that we probably used up all your Muggle money. I can pay you back in Galleons.”
“I’ll think about it,” Draco sighed, chewing on his lip. “I know I wasn’t exactly the nicest either, but… I need to think about it.”
They stood there for a moment, Harry clinging gently to Draco’s shirt, digging his feet into the ground as if something would root him in his spot.
“I’m sure you know you can’t owl him. Or anyone, for that matter. I don’t trust that source of communication anymore,” she stated, biting her thumb. She eyed him somewhat suspiciously. “You won’t, right?”
“It’s Harry Potter! The Boy Who Lived!” Harry heard someone shout. If everyone wasn’t staring at Harry before, now they surely were. Everything and everyone was silent for a few seconds. Though it was only a few seconds, it certainly didn’t feel like it for Harry.
“I hate this, I hate this, I hate this!” Harry groaned as he dramatically fell back on his seat, rubbing his temples.
“Working on it,” Draco finished for Harry. “Don’t tell anyone Pansy, or I swear to Merlin I’ll murder your ass.”
“No, yeah, I’m so deprived, aren’t I? I didn’t have a proper childhood. And, let’s face it, I have no proper family either. So, really, I’m-”
“We have tried to the best of our capabilities to make all of your classes easier for you,” Professor McGonagall said. Harry looked over to Hermione who was signing what McGonagall was saying. “Most of the teachers will write down anything important on the board for you. If you are having any difficulty with keeping up with the classes, please come to Dumbledore or myself.”
When Dobby had Apparated Harry and Ron out of the cellar, Harry went running towards Draco, tackling him to the ground.
“Hello, love,” he said softly, then looked around, spotting the new table. “Wow, you really went all out for this date.”
And Draco may have not known what Harry was thinking, but his heart could feel it. He could read Harry’s green eyes, and he could read how he had hurt Harry with just that one sentence.
“Physically? Yes,” he sighed, rubbing his hands together, groaning when someone knocked again. “Could you also get the door?”
“Well, I don’t think that could work out too well if she’s meddling,” Harry deflected, then shook his head. “Listen, I just think it’s easier if Draco and I go our separate ways.”
Harry and Draco smiled at Molly, saying bye to everyone before turning. Molly tapped Harry on his shoulder, and he turned around, wondering why she was calling him back.
Harry closed the space between them, and in that moment, he knew he didn’t have to answer the man in front him. In that moment, it felt as if he was in Sixth Year at Hogwarts. That they had just made it to their tent and could kiss and cuddle and make out as much as they liked. Things were simple - or as simple as things could be for them - back then.
“You don’t need to say anything,” he shook his head. “I just wanted you to know that. I don’t want to fight with you Harry, not ever again. If you want to forget about…” he pointed to the mistletoe, “I understand.”
The rest of the week went by painfully slow, and Draco had not realized until now how many classes he and Harry actually had in common. It was strange to go back to not talking daily. He found himself thinking of things to write in a poem for Harry, only to remember poems weren’t necessary anymore.
“Draco, you made it,” Luna grinned, pulling him into a hug. “It’s so good to see you again. And you too, Astoria.”
Hermione smiled. “Always so overdramatic,” she said with an eye roll. “Besides, something tells me that it’s not over between you two.”
Harry stayed silent, looking outside the window. “Why are you here, then? Did you think I would take you back in my arms willingly? Or are you here for forgiveness, hmm?”
“Come down now!” she shrieked, pulling the covers off of him and grabbing his arm. Harry barely had time to answer as she dragged him downstairs excitedly, then shoved a newspaper in his face. Raising an eyebrow, he looked down at the article.
“Coming!” He responded, then turned to Hermione and Harry. “So we’re in agreement, yeah? We’ll stay for the wedding?”
“What are you complaining about? I gave you my scarf, my gloves, my hat, would you like me to just give you all my clothes?”
hello hello! so sorry for the late update but... i think this is sort of what works for me! updating every *few* weeks. i've also kind of been stumped as to where this fanfic should go. i have many ideas, but writer's block can be super frustrating!
“I’m just glad everyone else is in class and they’re not here to see this,” Pansy said as she facepalmed. Ron and Luna exchanged glances, but the four were glad to see them together - bickering, like always, but still - it made them happy to see that they were happy.
“Yes.” Draco felt like he was overreacting; being dramatic, even. So what if his father was a little strict? All parents are strict. That didn’t make it…
It was a peaceful night. The two were in silence, but in a comfortable silence. After they finished their work, they gathered their stuff and went to the Room of Requirement. The two were already in their pajamas as they got into the large bed that the RoR had conjured up for them, cuddling up close together and falling asleep.
“Yeah, um… I’m not sure what there is to say. And I certainly don’t want to talk to Hermione about this. It seems most of it goes to Pansy when it’s supposed to stay between us.”
“Yeah,” he replied, then carefully took off his hearing aids. Draco signed ‘stand up’, and he did so. Looking down, he moved to adjust his shirt. When he looked back up, he swiftly moved to the left, dodging a spell from Draco just by an inch. “What the fuck?”
“You’re not losing me,” Draco said softly. “I’m always here,” he reached forward and touched Harry’s chest gently. “And I’m always up here too,” he pressed his index finger gently against Harry’s temple.
She gave him a sarcastic smile. “Witty. As I was saying, are you sure it’s a good idea to go searching for the Horcruxes?” she asked, her expression suddenly turning serious.
Pansy, who was waiting for Draco to pack up, caught Harry’s eye, who winced. She gave him a subtle nod. He chewed on his bottom lip, slowly walked out the classroom and waited by the door.
He scanned through the most recent poem in his journal, one he was supposed to send to Harry, finding himself smiling bitterly. It was stupid; letting himself fall. No, it wasn’t that he let himself fall. It was that he didn’t think of what would happen once he hit the ground - once reality hit both of them. It was something looming the past two months, yet easily ignorable, if they tried hard enough.
“Oh, please, they bicker all the time,” Pansy rolled her eyes, fixing her hair. “Seriously. I don’t know how you’ve dealt with it all these years, Harry.”
Harry could’ve thought of more things to say, but after seeing Draco’s hair, he stood up and left the living room, saying he was going to go see if lunch was ready. The four sat in silence until Ron and Hermione awkwardly shuffled out of the room as well.
“Well, S-sir, I intend to spend the rest of my life with him,” Draco said, his chest tightening as he chewed on his lip. Harry put his left hand under the table (Draco was to his left) and got a hold of it, squeezing it gently.
oh gosh this is definitely one of my favorite chapters. i loved writing this, and i hoped you loved reading it just as much!
Harry grinned and picked up a piece of paper to write back, but jumped when Hermione burst open the door. “You scared the shit out of me-”
Two days before Christmas, the poems had come to an abrupt stop. There was no owl tapping on Harry’s window. He decided not to question it - holidays were busy times, and he had a big family. A family full of Death Eaters…
“Well, I know we all hung out in Eighth Year and such, but… I was the one who broke up with you, so it didn’t seem fair for me to stay in the friendship group. There was obviously going to be space only for one of us, and I wanted it to be you.”
Harry eventually noticed when Draco started poking at his arm, constantly swiping his finger across it.
Harry nodded at Draco, before feeling dizzy and falling right on Draco, “The room is really spinny today,” He slurred slightly. Feeling Draco’s hand touch his head, he flinched and got up, glaring at him. “Okay, excuse me. I don’t mean to be rude, but I have a boyfriend.”
“This isn’t about you, Draco,” Harry fumed, “it’s bigger than you. It’s bigger than me, even. If I trust the wrong person, the entire Wizarding World could be in danger. What part of this is so hard for you to understand?”
“I was riding around on my broom a few months ago… upset about things. I needed to get away from my friends and everyone… I love Pansy and all, but…” he trailed off into silence, then shook his head. “Anyway, I found this place. I come here to clear my head sometimes.”
Harry Potter. You’re fucking Harry Potter, and your parents are dead. You will never understand.” Draco had said it before he could stop himself; before he had the time to realize what he was saying was wrong.
“Same, mate, same,” Ron called out from his bed as he slowly sat up too. Harry and Ron turned to face each other, both massaging their temples in an attempt to get rid of the pounding headache the two were getting.
“Besides, I don’t think you’d be able to handle being alone,” Hermione said quietly so that only Harry heard her. He snapped his head in her direction. Ron and Ginny fell into a conversation about Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
“Is that how you greet your father, Draco?” he asked, setting the newspaper down on the table in front of him. “Re-enter the room.”
telling myself that it was for the better. That we were better off not together. But… last month, our date… you felt it too, right? The warmth. I felt like I could…”
He stared at him for a moment, then nodded. “Right, okay,” he said, then started to sign ‘you’re a dumbass’ to Harry, who wasn’t sure if he should laugh or get mad. He settled on the latter.
“I don’t see how I spend my Friday evenings is any of your concern, Pansy,” he folded his arms, holding his head up high.
“What did you do?” Draco said after a few moments, realizing that he was not in pain, nor did he feel any different.
Draco’s face was paler than usual; and Pansy was practically force-feeding him. “Come on, I’m not your mother, Draco!” she complained. “Are you going to tell me what happened or just sit here like a baby?”
“Harry!” Hermione said, jumping out of her seat and running over to pull him into a hug. Laughing, Ron stood up and joined the hug, both exchanging some quiet words. Everyone at the table was happy to see him, all letting out murmurs of excitement.
Meanwhile, Harry slowly made his way to the Potion’s closet. As he got inside, he turned on the light and tried to shut the door behind him, but someone was there. Harry immediately turned, hoping and praying it wasn’t a Professor.
“Each and every one of the forty-one that you wrote,” Harry answered with a smile. There were tears welling up in Draco’s eyes. Harry pulled him closer. “Listen… if I die tonight-”
“I suggest you stop,” the blond threatened in a low voice, aware of all the people staring. Gritting his teeth, the pure disgust was evident on his face. “You don’t know what you’re saying.”
“I thought you’d never tell us,” Hermione said, getting excited all of a sudden. “You know, Ron and I did suspect it. Sneaking off for walks, not coming for dinner, not coming to your dorm till late night? You have a secret girlfriend, don’t you?”
Draco slowly fell to his knees, absolutely astonished, his eyes prickling with tears that threatened to fall down any second. He couldn’t register it. Nausea filled Draco’s stomach. His heart was struggling to keep a steady beat, and his chest felt like a wolf was eating at it, ripping out his skin, his heart, leaving him with nothing.
They fell into a silence as Harry got started with his essay. Draco picked up his WSL book and started reading, surprised to feel Harry’s hand rest on his thigh under the table. He couldn’t help but realize Harry was right. In this room, where they were away from everyone, they were in fact just Draco and Harry.
“Well, of course, but shut up! I spent most of sixth year being the one under the cloak!” Harry protested, and Draco rolled his eyes at him.
“Shh! He’s here!” he pushed Pansy out of his way, quickly making his way near the Great Lake. “Potter! Oh, right,” he muttered, turning to walk over to him, but it seemed Harry was already charging towards him.
Draco, who had been trying to avoid this very situation, embarrassedly pulled his hand away, taking off his robe and putting it to the side. He cleared his throat then nodded. “...right, the next ingredient?” he asked, lowering his hand and trying to hide it.
Draco sat down beside him kissing his cheek. “You did good today. By the way, I… probably should tell you, I won’t be able to do Sundays from now on. I have some… homework. You know.”
“Gee, thanks, Weasley,” Draco replied with an eye roll but nodded slightly. “But Harry, I want you to meet my parents too.”
“He told me everything,” she smiled slightly. “You don’t need to pretend. I know you’ve been helping him with sign language.”
Pansy and Draco exchanged glances, both going near the door so they could listen better. From the looks of it, the roles had been reversed.
“Uh…” Draco turned to face Harry, unsure of what to say. Neither of them ever really discussed how they were going to say it.
“Oh, no,” she shook her head. “I suppose you’re right. Though I wasn’t welcome lovingly. It was more just of an acknowledgement.”
“No, I just figured he’d be somewhere around here, though,” Pansy said, her eyebrows slanting into a frown as she slowly shut her book. “How do you feel?”
Harry turned to look at him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Well, it’s not like you should be telling me anyway. Don’t you have some sort of pact, I don’t know, where you can’t say it out loud?”
“Stop signing,” the other said. Draco followed his gaze, which was to Hermione and Ron, who were both staring at him suspiciously. “Just talk to me normally. I can lip-read.”
Draco chuckled. “I fucking hate you,” he whispered, pushing Harry down on the couch. The two smacked each other repeatedly, both squirming and giggling like little kids until Harry rested his head on Draco’s chest. “You’re lucky it’s in the best way possible.”
“Hey, guys, what are your plans for Christmas?” asked Ron as he sat down on the sofa in the Common Room, beside Draco and Harry who were holding hands under the blanket that was over both of them. “The holidays start in a few days.”
Then she left. He hugged his knees, resting his head against the wall. He loved Hermione and Ron for everything they were sacrificing for him; he did. But it just wasn’t the same. It was so difficult to be grateful when all he wanted was Draco. He wanted to see him. Their last night together; on their anniversary - which was now tainted by Dumbledore’s death - was good. Even after the chaos and mishaps. But when he’d woken up, Draco was gone, without a trace, except for a small note.
“Yes,” he signed, picking it up, lower lip quivering as he tried putting it in his ear, sighing when he heard nothing. He took it out and pocketed it, looking back up at her. “Sorry, Professor.”
A confused Harry mouthed ‘What?’ to Draco as Narcissa pulled him into a hug, before pulling away and starting to rant.
Harry grabbed him by the chin and carefully turned Draco’s head to look at him in the eyes. “You’re right. I’m Harry Potter. And I love you, because you’ve spent the last four months trying to make sure I don’t die in battle,” he stroked Draco’s cheek. “Because you respect my boundaries. And especially because when you kiss me, everything else seems a little less gloomy.”
“Draco, honey, don’t you think it’s unnecessary to invite the Weasleys?” Astoria questioned, staring down at her large diamond ring. “Babe.”
“Oh, fucking hell,” she threw a pillow at him, sitting up slowly. She raised an eyebrow when she noticed he let the pillow hit him. “It’s six in the morning, Draco.”
“Oh,” he said, putting a hand to exactly where the streak used to be. “I dyed it white. Got sick of looking at it, you know? Anyway, where’s my tux? I’ll go to the bathroom and get ready.”
Pansy frowned. “I mean, I just walked past their carriage. Ron and Hermione were signing to him, so…”
Draco stared at Harry with an amused expression on his face. “And who may that be?” He asked, his lips twitching into a slight smirk. Harry shook his head vigorously and continuously until he felt dizzy again, this time able to regain himself before he could fall over again.
“It’s not like they’re whispering,” she said. “Besides, it’s easy to lip read their conversations when they enunciate so much.”
Harry didn’t even pay attention as the class started, he was too self-conscious of the fact that Draco was right there beside him. After twenty minutes or so into the lesson, Harry felt a hand touch his thigh from under the table.
“Oh… sorry. I just felt like calling you Dray.” Harry said. He found himself staring deep into Draco’s silver eyes.
“Oh, I apologize. I didn’t quite feel hungry,” he turned back to his journal, staring down at his half-written poem. He shut it and turned to look at her. “I woke up a few hours ago, but… I couldn’t quite sleep last night. I just needed to gather myself.”
As a given, Ron and Harry took a room, one at the very end of the hallway. The Eighth Year rooms weren’t split into different sections for genders - just the girls’ dorms on the right and the boys’ on the left, right across each other in a hallway down the Eighth Year Common Room.
“No buts. You’ve made your decision, and you should accept that it’s over. I know it’ll be hard, but he’s married now. I know this isn’t what you want to hear, but…” she trailed off into silence, then sighed, putting her arms around both of them. “You’ll be okay, Harry.”
“Doing anything with you is memorable, Draco,” he said before he could stop himself. It was the first time that day he had said his name. “I… I better go, then…”
“Harry, calm down,” he said, putting his hands on Harry’s shoulders, looking at him reassuringly, but he was still trying to get out of bed. Draco quickly stopped him.  “Hey, calm down, you’re safe.”
Draco undid the spell for the locked door and finally opened it. As Harry heard the door swing open behind him, he turned to face Draco, a slight smile on his face, standing up so he could face him properly. “You finally opened the goddamn-”
Harry, who was not really doing anything in particular, choked on his saliva, coughing like a maniac, before looking up at Draco. “Excuse me, what?” Harry asked, “A dinner with the Malfoys! Outrageous. It’s almost as if you want your family to hate me.”
“Seriously? Arguing when it’s so close to the New Year?” Hermione asked with an eye roll as she and Ron approached Draco and Harry. Ron just rolled his eyes, implying that he agreed with Hermione.
The two were making out for what seemed like forever, which to them, wasn’t something they were complaining about. Harry’s heart was almost leaping out of his chest, as if this was their first kiss, as if they had just confessed their feelings for each other.
“Yeah, mate, I agree with ‘Mione,” Ron said with a nod. Harry fell back in his pace, watching as his two best friends rushed into class, slowly following after him.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco replied with an eye roll. “You know that I’m on your side, right?”
“Uh, anyway, what’s the purpose of this? Do you expect me to just forgive you and date you again? Because… I get where you’re coming from with all of this but… I don’t think I can move past it."
“Harry…” Draco heaved a sigh, then motioned for Harry to follow him, who did so, a smile on his face.
“Like a log,” he answered, his voice still raspy. “But I’m still tired,” he yawned, smiling when Pansy put some food on his plate. “Thanks.” He looked up to see the family owl in front of him on the table, jumping.
Harry loved her sometimes. He quickly snuck away and walked up to the room of requirement, sighing when he saw it was empty. Maybe Draco had just left, or maybe he hadn’t had a chance to get away.
“I’m… going to… study somewhere else.” Harry said slowly. Lately, he hadn’t even been able to speak properly - he did everything in slow motion. Harry slowly picked up his textbook and walked down the Great Hall.
“Harry? You think you’ll be able to stay awake during this lesson?” Pansy asked quietly as she helped him sit down.
“Must be easy for you, since you can’t hear him. Though, I must say, this past week without his stupid loud rambling has been quite peaceful,” Hermione pointed out.
Of course, Draco knew where Harry would go. That’s why he wasn’t able to find him. More so, he didn’t put in much effort to find him. He went to general places where Harry would usually hang out.
Harry sat on the bed of the Room of Requirement, quickly wiping away the tears on his face and turning to Draco, “How’d you know I’d be here?” He asked in a soft tone, biting his lip, sniffling slightly.
“We’ll be there, Harry,” Ron said when Harry told his two best friends how he was going to go in search for Horcruxes.
“Thanks for visiting!” Harry beamed at a few customers, turning back to restock the shelves. He had dyed his streak brown again. It had been three weeks since his encounter with Draco, and day by day, he was pushing it further away from his conscious mind.
Harry stared at her for a few seconds. It was almost as if she knew about how Harry felt colder and more drained when Draco wasn’t around, just the way he felt when he had been away from Draco in the summer.
Draco took a step forward. “If you want to be competent in a duel, Harry, you need to learn to fight without hearing aids. Chances are, once anyone sees them, they’re going to knock it right off your ears.”
“Hmm? Oh!” Harry snapped out of his dream, feeling a little embarrassed. “Sorry. Lost myself for a second. What were you saying?” Harry asked, turning a little pink as he sheepishly smiled at Draco.
Suddenly, either everyone was getting back to their goodbyes, or walking up to Harry. They were shaking his hand, some even hugging him, all talking at once. Harry noticed that even Hermione and Ron were getting bombarded; though the only difference was that Ron actually seemed to be enjoyed the attention, while Hermione and Harry simply awkwardly stood there.
Harry entered and sat down. It had been five minutes and Draco wasn’t here yet. Harry decided to just change into his pajamas. He took off his shirt and was about to pull on his very oversized t-shirt, when-
“They’ve really cut down on the insults, haven’t they?” Hermione pointed out as she raised an eyebrow at the two males refusing to tear their eyes off of each other. Pansy nodded in agreement.
“Whenever you’re ready, send it,” Then she left his room. Draco searched his drawer for a blank sheet of paper and realized he hadn’t had any left in his room. He quickly slipped out and found a stack of papers lying on the table in the hallway.
“You think I can?” Ron whined. “I can’t get rid of Lavender and this whole thing with Hermione… it’s just all a mess!”
“Harry.” Hermione cut him off, giving him a demeaning look with a glare, making Harry immediately run into the bathroom to get ready. He changed into random clothes that he found in his trunk and met Hermione in the Gryffindor Common Room right on time for dinner.
Harry shook his head. “No, you’ve gotten me enough,” he said as Draco tried handing him another box. “I’m serious, Draco, the watch was more than-” he looked down as Draco opened the box, a pair of hearing aids inside.
Startled, Harry watched as he stood up, walking towards the door. He paused at the doorknob, hand trembling as the Gryffindor spoke up. “I can’t not worry,” he was saying, his voice shaky. He was unsure of how loud he was being. “I thought you said we were friends.”
“Why are you doing that?” Draco whispered. He was afraid to ask because he knew Harry would stop as soon as he did, but it was weird. Odd. Almost made what Blaise had accused true.
“It’s fine,” Draco said, folding his arms and holding his chin up. Seeing Harry’s face now made him less worried and more irritated. “It’s only been an hour. Guess it would’ve killed you to owl me or something.”
“That was before I fought someone because of him,” he said rather harshly, stuffing his face with a mouthful of food. “Before his stupid touch made my skin burn. Now all I want to do is dig a hole and bury myself in it. He definitely took the fight the wrong way. I was just trying to stop Blaise from making bizarre accusations.”
That was, until the evening. Harry had eaten whatever he could and exited the Hall as quickly as possible. He was walking down the hall when he saw Draco. This time, he didn’t flinch but did take a step backward when he noticed Draco was with someone.
“I don’t know what I want,” Harry’s voice was low, heart beating faster than he could ever imagine. “I don’t know if I…”
“Still thinking about it, aren’t you? I told you; I’m fine. It was nearly two years ago. I’m all healed.”
“I fucked up, I fucked up,” he said, pacing a few more times before stopping in front of her. “I feel sick. I’m going Madame Pomfrey. I’ll probably be off for the rest of the week.”
“I understand if you’re upset, or even if you hate me. I just… I wanted one last date with you. We don’t have to talk ever again if that’s what you want. But today I’m asking for one last time.”
“I love it,” Harry said, choking up, trying desperately to hold back tears. “It’s beautiful.” His hand trembling slightly, he picked up one of the rings, taking Draco’s left hand and putting it on his ring finger. “There,” He said in more of a whisper than a loud voice.
“Okay, one,” he sat upright, “you were being a dickhead! Who in their right mind would be friends with someone who’s insulting their friend? Two, not accepting your handshake didn’t mean we had to be
“Just sort out old files,” Harry answered, so grateful that Hermione had interrupted them that he pulled her into a hug. He quickly pulled away and awkwardly stood in front of the two girls.
Draco just hated how it would never go away. How every time he would look at it for the rest of his life, he would feel instant regret.
Harry had no answer for that. “Where the hell is my Invisibility Cloak?” he asked, quickly changing the subject. He dumped his clothes back in the trunk, closing it and sighing as he started looking for it under his pillow and on his bedside table.
Harry heard the echo of Draco calling after him, he felt the tears spilling down his cheeks, he felt his legs walking away and away, far away from Draco.
Harry found himself zoning in and out. He felt mostly blank, the guilt had washed away. He had forced himself to block out any sort of thoughts of the incident. But every so often, he would see someone in the hallways that looked ever so slightly like Draco, making him flinch and drop everything he would be holding.
Harry, panting, let out a loose laugh, leaning up so their lips were brushing as he spoke. “Do you really want to discuss your hair right now?”
Draco’s hand trembled slightly as Harry held it. Harry noticed, but didn’t say anything, his green eyes sparkling as he stared into glistening silver ones. “You could never understand,” He said slowly and in a quiet voice.
“You don’t have to be sorry. It’s not your fault. Neither is it mine,” he said, a hint of a smile on his face. “I’m sorry there’s something bothering you, though,” he tilted his head, leaning forward and kissing Draco’s forehead gently. “I heard that makes people feel better.”
Even Draco seemed surprised by what he was saying. “I just mean… it’s not unreasonable for you to feel this way. And not unreasonable for you to need a break.”
“Coming,” he called out, getting off of him. “Okay, it hurts a little now,” he sighed, trying not to smile as he watched a flustered, pink-faced Draco tuck his shirt back in properly. “Draco?”
Harry said nothing, clutching the invitation tightly in his hands. Draco’s face fell and he stood up quickly.
“I know, don’t worry,” he squeezed the other’s hand gently. “I remember our deal. And our rules. I trust you. But I see… you quite disrespectfully forgot rule six.”
This Friday evening, they both had made it, but had barely uttered a word to each other the entire night. Their session was coming to an end. Harry studied Draco, who was beside him - he barely put gel in his hair anymore, despite constantly telling him that he would put gel in his hair because he liked it that way. He had dark circles under his eyes and his body seemed fragile.
“I think it’s a good idea to be with you despite all of that,” Draco shook his head. “Don’t you understand, Harry? With every mishap, argument, or fight, I never… I never truly stopped loving you. Even when you used that spell on me. Hell, it made me want you even more. Because I knew that it was my mistake-”
Draco folded his arms, his expression darkening. He had forgotten about the bad things for a moment. “There are still responsibilities waiting for me, Pansy. I just didn’t want to be in a situation where I would hurt him again."
“Have I?” Harry asked, a smile still on his face, clutching his bag. “I’m just glad to be going home, you know, seeing everyone.”
Harry wasn’t exactly a lightweight, but he wasn’t a heavyweight either. He was quite somewhere in the middle; which was probably why after chugging down the bottle and drinking another one had perhaps made him drunk.
“Draco? Are you okay?” Harry spoke when he was sure the rest were out of earshot. Harry tried to speak in a gentle voice, pulling him carefully away from his chest so he could look at him. “Did something happen at lunch today with your father?”
“Harry, you didn’t even ask if I could come?” Draco whisper-shouted, before turning to face Molly Weasley. “I really don’t mean to bother you guys… I think it’s best if I go-”
Draco, by now, had taken the bottle from Harry’s hands and put it aside, staring intently at him, curious about what he had to say. “What do you mean you knew the pain he was going through?” He asked questioningly.
“Really,” Draco nodded, then frowned. “Unless… you decided this isn’t worth the risk. I completely understand. I mean, it’s your life at stake-”
Draco rolled his eyes. “However, you aren’t,” Draco said as Harry tripped over his foot for the umpteenth time. “Here, let’s go a little slower.”
So. I need a little help. I can guarantee that not even one person is still reading this story, but I'm taking all the chances I can get.
“But Harry, we haven’t even had dinner yet,” Ron started, but Harry looked away, shrugging as he left for the boys’ dormitories. He exchanged glances with Hermione, who looked just as concerned as he did.
also, I don't know why I did such sort of parallels at the end over there, I don't know how to feel about it tbh.
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Draco shoved him, but he was stifling a laugh. “Right, so, the deal. What do you think?”
They made their way to the Great Hall. Harry avoided looking at the Slytherin table at costs. If he saw Draco, he was unsure what he would do. It was better if he simply avoided him because what he knew was that the cold, empty look in Draco’s eyes would be too much to bear.
She wrapped an arm around him. “You’re right, I’m sorry. You’re not obligated to say yes to him. Let’s go up. I’ll make some hot cocoa for us while we talk.”They went upstairs in silence. Harry watched her make the hot cocoa. He offered to help, but she just told him to sit down and relax. “Well, now that you’ve said no, are you going to move on from him?”
“And I’m trying really hard not to punch you in the face right now,” Harry replied. Both Ron and Hermione tugged at him. Gulping, he looked over to Draco, who seemed to be apologetically staring at him.
Draco’s hand was slightly trembling, and he gulped down what felt like a storm of emotions, picking up his textbook, blinking back tears. He had answered so softly that Harry almost didn’t even hear him.
Harry slowly made his way down the hallway before dinner. He hadn’t seen Draco since their meeting in the Potions closet many hours ago, and now he wanted to see him again.
Draco felt his Dark Mark sting. He looked away from Harry, biting his lip. Draco knew very well that it was his fault. And that it was his fault for getting him worked up now. But let’s face it, once Harry’s worked up, there’s no point in trying to calm him until he’s said what he’s needed to.
Draco didn’t say anything. His eyes slid away from Harry’s, still feeling the other’s gaze on him as he bit his lip.
“This is the only place we can hang out freely without people catching us,” Harry said with an eye roll. “I mean, we could use the Room of Requirement but I haven’t been able to get the room in a while.”
As Harry looked around Platform 9 and 3/4, memories of the previous years flooded his brain. He felt his heart beating quickly as he looked around, in hopes to find a certain white-haired boy.
The holidays for Harry were rather depressing, if not lonely. They had gone to visit Arthur Weasley who had been attacked, and he barely talked to anyone the whole time. The whole mood had been ruined by the visions that had been bothering him. Their first night back at home, Harry had gotten a ‘dream’ about Arthur through the eyes of the snake, and they had all rushed to the hospital.
Harry had calmed down slightly. He hung his head low, staring down at his lap. “Is that really all you think of me?” He asked in a low voice.
“Draco, if you don’t want to talk about it, it’s okay. We can skip past that bit.” Harry said softly, taking Draco’s hand and holding onto it tightly.
“Shh, will you? I’m trying to give you a hickey,” Harry mumbled as he bit at Draco’s neck, smiling when he heard Draco trying to hold back a soft moan but failing. Harry looked up and jumped onto Draco, wrapping his legs around his waist, smashing his lips against the other's.
“Ah, yes, Pansy, you assuming I was gay for Harry Potter right since the beginning and thinking we were dating even when we weren’t really helped me.”
“It’s time to bring the factors… and our mistakes… back in,” he whispered in his ear quietly, then took a few steps back, turning to leave. “And yeah. I seriously hate your hair when it’s gelled back."
“H...Harry, what… what are you doing here?” Draco stuttered, standing right in front of something that looked like a closet, so Harry wouldn’t see it.
One week before the wedding, Draco picked up his quill, unsure of what to say to Harry. Maybe there was nothing to say. Maybe there was too much to say in one letter. But all he could think of when the quill touched the paper was scribbling on it vigorously.
“It wasn’t my choice. Besides, I thought since you’re soulmates, you two would be able to work things out.”
“What, Harry? Just tell me, I won’t judge you,” Hermione said in a comforting tone, sitting down beside him.
“You should see how panicked you get sometimes,” he laughed. “You don’t need to worry so much. I really don’t think we’re friends or something.”
“I’m just surprised no one’s noticed,” She replied, frowning slightly. “They went from death threats to insulting each other’s hair because they have nothing else to insult the other with. Doesn’t get any gayer than that.”
“Bloody hell, I didn’t know that we were so popular!” Ron said - rather excitedly - as he sat down beside Hermione, practically grinning from ear to ear. Harry was sitting opposite them, awkward playing with his hands when Ron and Hermione started holding hands and starting to converse with each other quietly.
“What are you doing? Are you talking to that Siri person?” came Draco’s muffled voice from behind the camera.
“Ron thinks I’m getting old and getting grey hair,” Harry said with an eye roll. Ron shrugged at that. Hermione turned to look at Ron. She looked so done with his logic.
For the rest of the time, while they waited, it was just playful bickering and eating some more waffles and drinking hot chocolate. Even Blaise and Theo had shown up; as well as Dean, Seamus, and Neville.
“You are?” Draco asked, turning his head so he was staring up at the ceiling, too afraid to look into his eyes now. His heart was thumping.
He gazed out the window, looking up at the full moon. He hoped going back wouldn’t bring back everything he had been trying to forget.
“It seems to me there’d have to be some love,” Harry shrugged, sitting down beside Draco. “Why spend so much time together if all they’re doing is arguing? There has to be more to it than that. Besides, you already wrote here that they want to spend time together forever.”
“Tell me about it,” Ron replied as he sat down beside Harry, grabbing a piece of chicken for himself. “It’s kind of stupid how they expect you to stay on top of work if they can’t do much to accommodate to your needs."
“Yes, I did. I came here after dinner yesterday. It took ages but I had to make it. It felt empty without it. Besides, I thought maybe… you need a place to get away from everything.”
,” Hermione said with a huge sigh as she flopped herself down on the seat of the train compartment, “I thought we’d never be able to escape.” Harry nodded in agreement, but didn’t say anything.
He pushed Draco backwards. “You’re so infuriating,” he rolled his eyes, standing up. “Alright, then, come at me. You have the clear upper hand here.”
“Another letter,” Hermione said, trying to take it from the owl, who quickly flew away from her and onto Harry’s shoulder. “Who keeps sending you these anyway?” she said, folding her arms.
“Sorry!” Harry readjusted Draco’s tie, looking up at Draco’s silver eyes. They didn’t have much of a height difference, but Harry was just a bit shorter than Draco. Harry softly placed his lips on Draco’s, kissing him gently. Draco was taken aback but immediately responded, kissing him back.
“Harry,” Draco sighed. “You don’t trust me. I don’t know how we can go forward. Maybe it’s better if we break up. I don’t want to waste my time on you anymore. What I’m really mad about is that…
“Proof? Who needs proof! It’s clearly true!” Pansy said with a laugh, standing up and resting her elbow on Luna’s shoulder, clearly amused by Hermione’s outrage and her need to tell everyone the right facts.
“But you two are soulmates,” she gulped. “This sort of thing doesn’t happen to just anyone. Don’t you think you should fight for it?”
“You’re ignoring me,” Harry complained, leaning forward and resting his head on Draco’s arm, still pouting. “I’m bored.”
Draco leaned forward, gently and carefully slipping them on to Harry’s face. “Better?” He asked, sharing a quick kiss on the lips with Harry, before leaning back and grinning.
The next morning was dreadful. Harry woke up to the sun shining on his face. Since it seemed alarm clocks - or the chatter of his roommates - would not wake him up, he had to sleep with the curtains of his bed open. Blinking, he slowly put his glasses and got ready.
“I am too,” he said. “Does this have anything to do with that girl who’s been sending you love letters?”
“I don’t think there’s a way out, Draco,” Harry told him quietly. Draco sighed in defeat. Ron was busy talking to Luna who had appeared to be in the cellar for days.
Harry was smiling awkwardly, “and here I thought I was stupid for saying it to you,” he mumbled, adjusting the hearing aids on his ears. “I love you too, Draco.”
“What? I’m hwungwy.” Draco said through a mouthful. Pansy was so disgusted that she didn’t even bother to roll her eyes. She just focused on her own food.
“Don’t worry, this is his way of showing he cares about you. He thinks it’s better to scold you than to actually try and care about you.” Pansy whispered with a smile. Harry laughed.
“Er…” he looked around at everyone, avoiding Draco’s eyes. “Yeah, something came up, so I’m afraid I have to leave. Sorry, Molly.”
“No, I just… this week has been so frustrating,” he answered. “Blaise has done practically everything to get on my nerves, and most of the Slytherins keep giving me dirty looks. I have no idea what he told them, but I’m sure it wasn’t something good. And, on top of
“A wonderful anniversary, isn’t it?” Harry said. Draco gave him a blank expression. “Oh, come on. Don’t be like that. I know none of this is your fault.”
She squeezed his shoulder gently. “It’s okay. Let me get you something to drink and we can talk about it more.”
He jumped when he felt two hands on his shoulder, turning around to see Draco in his room, wearing a sweater and black trousers, a bag slung over his shoulders.
Groaning into his pillow, he jumped when he heard Pansy laugh. “What are you doing here?” he asked, watching as she shut the door behind her. Harry and Draco had met up earlier in the morning so they would be able to sneak out easier.
They let the whole disc play, dancing erratically and basically jumping about. There was something that made it so easy to be around Draco, something Harry had not even recently felt with Hermione or Ron. They were his best friends, but it was different with Draco. He was putting conscious effort for Harry, despite the asshole he had been.
Two weeks had passed since Harry had fallen sick. The next Quidditch game was against Ravenclaw, coming up in a week.
“Do you think him and Pansy are talking about it right now?” Ron asked. The three stared at each other in silence.
“Clearly you haven’t seen our living room,” Draco rolled his eyes, but the two were smiling. He sighed when he noticed the time on his watch. “I have to get going, but…”
“Since when do you care what’s said about Potter? Don’t tell me you’ve become his bodyguard, just like the Weasel and the Mudblood. Or worse, don’t tell me he’s won your heart over,” he let out a loose laugh. “Got a boyfriend, have we? Feeling a bit protective?”
He looked down at the letter in his hand, folding it. “Forget it, Harry,” he said, wiping his tears away quickly. “I’m fine.”
Harry was speaking so fast that he didn’t even bother to sign, his face starting to turn red. He didn’t know if he was even comprehensible, but he didn’t care.
Draco tried to keep his laughter in. “I have no idea what you’re talking-- oof!” he balanced himself as Harry pushed him backwards. The white-haired teenager felt somewhat satisfied. He had hit a nerve - good. He went near the edge of the water, holding the hearing aids out. “Alright, that’s it. I don’t know what this stupid thing is, but I might as-”
Draco was nearby, but kept his eyes at his feet, knowing well that there was nothing he could do to stop Blaise without raising suspicion. Pansy caught up to him. “Why are you standing-”
“Talent, my ass,” he fumed, standing up from the car race game, looking around the arcade. “Well, given that I’ve won most games today, I guess you sort of need this win for your self-esteem.”
Of course he had to sit beside Harry. Of course today had to be the first time they met after over a year. Of course today had to become more difficult than it had to be because their two friends had decided it would be funny if they sat right. Fucking. Next to each other. Draco had only one thought running through his head at that moment.
Hermione just hugged him tightly, followed by Ron. After that night, Harry came clean to them. They already sort of knew judging by their behavior but comforted him nonetheless. It wasn’t easy avoiding Draco for the rest of their Eighth Year, but they tried their best. Draco and Astoria started dating just before their graduation and they got engaged last year.
Harry didn’t move from his bed at all, for most of the day. He stayed in the same position, hidden behind his curtains, his face emotionless, his mind blank.
“I only had three hours with you, though,” Harry murmured as Draco laid beside him, stroking his hair gently.
He looked around at Molly, Ginny, and Ron, who were all smiling at him. “It’s probably way too expensive,” he muttered, putting the newspaper down. “And we don’t even know if it would work. My hearing was lost because of dark magic.”
“I’m going to regret asking, but...” Pansy said as she sat down beside Draco in the Slytherin Common Room, “why are you reading that book if you don’t believe he’s deaf? And where did you get it?”
?” he sneered, folding his arms. “Potter, the only one who’s pathetic here is you, thinking that we’d believe your lies.”
Harry looked around. Mostly everyone had gone to Hogsmeade, and the younger years were keeping to themselves in secluded parts of the common room.
Dinner was a bit weird for everyone. Draco and Harry sat down beside each other - Draco really did not want to sit next to anyone else, he still felt super awkward.
“So, Draco,” said Lucius, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. “You haven’t been staying at Malfoy Manor for a while.” Draco could already see this conversation going in a bad direction - it was probably a record; they had gone five minutes into the meal without starting an unpleasant conversation. Lucius raised an eyebrow, waiting for Draco’s reply.
“No, no… nothing like that…” Harry muttered, chuckling slightly, unable to take his eyes off of Draco - no, Harry didn’t
Draco found himself looking over at Harry every few seconds, however, he was just staring at his drink and murmuring quietly to Ron. Did it really have to be this hard to even be in the same room as him? The regret of the past two years had been looming over him for a while, but in this moment, all he wanted was to apologize and take Harry in his arms, but he knew he couldn’t do that. It’d be outrageous, putting aside the fact that the curse placed on them would hurt him.
Draco and Harry had managed to avoid each other - which was actually quite hard. There was quite a less amount of Eighth Years, which made it harder for the two. After the war, everyone put their differences aside, and usually, they all hung out together.
The quill scratched against the piece of paper, his grip tight. Finishing off the letter, Harry tied it up and handed it to his owl, Hedwig Jr. Sighing, he watched as the owl flew out the window, well on his way to Mrs. Weasley, agreeing to go to their home for dinner.
Draco finally turned to look back at Harry, his silver eyes gleaming with tears, screaming for help, frowning profusely. His eyes were screaming, shouting, for Harry to just
“Good. Now get to your classes,” she ordered. Draco stood up at once, quickly leaving. Harry lingered for a moment, and she sighed, placing the hearing aids on the table. “I managed to get it from the lake, but I’m uncertain how well they would work… are they Muggle hearing aids?”
The brunet didn’t look up, so Draco walked towards him and stood beside him. Harry looked up finally, looking surprised. He fumbled around for his case before he put his hearing aids back on. “Sorry, I didn’t want to be distracted by any noise, so… what are you doing here?”
Draco put it on for Harry, who was struggling. The only light source was the moonlight from the window and the lamp on the desk a bit further away from them. Harry turned his wrist, smiling. “Thank you, Draco.”
Draco watched him, standing up as the soft, slow music started to play. “Dance with me?” he put his hand out. Harry took it, and they swayed to the music. Draco’s hands were on Harry’s waist. “I like this song. Sirius had good taste.”
“Honestly, Parkinson, the difference between you and your family really appalls me. What in Merlin’s beard is that supposed to mean?” He folded his arms.
“It’s not that, but… talking about it with you…” Trailing off into silence, Harry ran a hand through his hair, knowing that what he was about to say would be bad. His eyes moved down to Draco’s arm. “I’m not sure it’s a good idea.”
“I’m telling you, Malfoy’s behaving very strangely!” Harry started up again. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances. “I was sitting next to him throughout the whole class! He’s got to be a Death Eater-”
“Luna, not you too!” Harry groaned. His face was flushed as he lifted his legs, wailing slightly in embarrassment, leaning on Draco.
I don’t even love him anymore. I just want to be able to explain to him what happened,” Draco pleaded. “I just need you to undo the curse. What if we run into each other and he gets severely injured?”
Hypocrite. A huge, huge, hypocrite, Harry was. But he felt as if someone had just torn his chest open, pulled his heart out, and put it back inside, leaving a huge, open wound.
“You’re strange,” she commented. “But you seem… happier. Did something happen? Did Malfoy get into trouble or something?”
“I was at risk of all of it before you,” Draco folded his arms. “I’m a Malfoy. My life is going to be at risk whether I like it or not. If I’m a Death Eater, I’m risking my life. If I’m with you, I’m risking my life too. It was
“Barely a day and a half, actually,” Harry corrected, “and that’s not nearly enough out of seven days a week. Not when Friday evenings are spent
Hermione, impatient, tapped him on the shoulder. “Harry, what the hell are you two on about?” she asked, but he didn’t even look in her direction, too fixated on Draco.
“Stay,” Harry said, his eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t lose two people in one night. God, Draco, this hurts so much.”
“Shh,” Draco put a finger to her lips, keeping his eyes on the jewelry in front of him. “I need to get him something special. I want him to know how I feel. So I need it to be perfect.”
Pansy and Astoria nodded, watching as he left the store. He stared the shops around, but instead entered a new bar. He sat down after ordering a whiskey, staring out the window. Everyone else there seemed to be on a date. He tried to ignore the stinging in his chest.
“And you’d be okay with that?” he asked, his eyes stinging with tears when he noticed Harry’s trembling hands. Gulping, he held his hands with both of his own in an attempt to steady them. “We’d have to go back to being enemies.”
There was a pause. Until Draco’s cold expression crumbled. “I hate this, Harry. I hate that this is happening,” Draco mumbled, his hands starting to tremble. “We… shouldn’t do this anymore, should we? It’s a bad idea… it’s-”
"It can't be undone, I'm afraid to say," Lucius replied. "Once the curse has been made; it cannot be undone."
“It’s got all sorts of things. Muggle things, though. One of my dorm mates is Muggle-born, I just took it from her.”
Hermione turned to look at the two who were desperately trying to hide their hickeys, quickly standing up and walking over to Ron, sitting down on his lap.
“What is it with you and ferrets?” Harry questioned, shaking his head. “It always comes back to ferrets one way or another.”
“What? I didn’t say that. I just- um--” he cleared his throat awkwardly, standing up and dumping the book inside his book bag. “Shut up, Pansy. You know I don’t believe that stupid Gryffindork. Now let’s go for breakfast.”
“Oh, shut up! This is coming from the guy that thought Oreos dipped in orange juice was a good idea!”
“Harry, don’t go. Stay with him for a bit. The medicine he’s under is pretty strong, he’ll be out for hours.”
“How does it feel, Potter?” Blaise was laughing amongst Crabbe and Goyle, who were standing on either side of him. Was this it? Now that Draco wasn’t at his throat, it was Blaise. “You can’t even do a simple color-changing spell now!”
“Yeah, we should’ve. I’m just glad I got to see you. This summer has been so… awful,” Draco was saying. Somewhere in between a half-asleep conversation with Draco, Harry fell asleep.
“You underestimate me, Harry,” Draco smiled as he put his hands on Harry’s face, using his thumb to wipe away his tears. “Listen. I know I can’t make any of it go away. Let’s take it one step at a time, alright? Right now, I’m here. And you have all of me.”
There was a small sound from the nearby room, followed by footsteps. Ron was still snoring and the footsteps sounded slightly heavy. Neither Hermione or Ron would be wearing shoes, since they’d have just woken up. It had to be someone dangerous. A Death Eater, maybe?
Harry looked up to see some of the Slytherins snickering, but much to his surprise, Draco wasn’t one of them, pretending to be focused on his own spell.
“Snape found out,” Draco finally said, running a hand through his hair. “And he wants me to break up with you. He said that The Dark Lord will find out by reading your mind. But you had Occlumency lessons, didn’t you? Can’t you block him out?”
“Merry Christmas, my love,” Draco replied, running his hands through Harry’s hair, turning to face the fireplace that was in front of them. “I got you something.” He slowly picked up Harry and put him down on the sofa, going to the Christmas tree and picking up the small box, walking back to Harry, smiling slightly as he handed it to him.
It echoed in his head. The words went into his brain. But he couldn’t register it. His heart stopped, and his body practically jolted upright.
“Thanks for calling me a girl, darling,” Harry told him sarcastically. By now, the three had reached the classroom of Defense Against the Dark Arts. They were the first ones there. Draco and Harry went to sit in the front of the class, and Pansy went to her usual spot, somewhere in the middle row.
The next week was chaotic. They had finally left Grimmauld Place behind after breaking into the Ministry, and Harry was, somehow, starting to feel more settled into his life as someone on the run. It felt a little fake, however, due to the fact that he was still meeting with Draco on Fridays in the comfort of Pansy's house.
“Do you think you can- oh!” he gasped as Draco lifted him up carefully then placed him down, just like the Yule Ball dance. “You did that quite well, I must say. Parvati wasn’t pleased with my skills as a date
“Hey, so,” Draco said as Harry was gathering his stuff, “Do you want me to help you with Potions or something tomorrow?”
He quickly shut up Harry by capturing his lips in a kiss, who shut his eyes and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, who pushed him down on the ground, kissing his neck. Harry arched his back, leaning his head back, smiling. Draco had told him what he was hoping for, and now, he could melt into his touch without having the lingering feeling at the back of his head, telling him that Draco would leave him soon.
“Can’t remember,” Ron said, getting up and quickly running to the bathroom before Harry even had a chance to stand up. Harry groaned but laid back down on his bed, realizing it was probably better that he got to relax a bit more while waiting for Ron to get out of the shower. Harry felt around for his glasses and slowly placed them on, surprised to see a glass with a little water left in it on his bedside table.
“You two, work together. For the sake of my sanity, be civilized with each other,” he snapped, then quickly walked away. Harry, annoyed, readjusted his robes and set down the Potions textbook in his hands.
“Happy anniversary. I love you too,” Draco said quietly, then took out a small piece of paper, handing it to Harry. “Don’t forget that, okay?”
“I have no right, I don’t, I don’t. But he… he just let her kiss him, he just let her! I know I shouldn’t be so upset, I’m being a huge hypocrite since I kissed Ginny, but I didn’t even want Ginny to kiss me, I don’t even like her. But he might like
“Get over the hair gel, will you?” he snapped, resting his chin on Harry’s head, involuntarily putting his hand to his hair. “What I meant was, I’ve become stupid for someone I’m in love with. You know, Pansy’s always going on about how love is blind. I think she’s actually right. I’ve dumbed myself down for you. Also, I’m doing sappy romantic things that I usually found disgusting.”
Draco quickly reached for his sweater and put it on as Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Sorry, were we being too loud? I was sure we put a
“You really are sorry, then?” Harry asked, staring down at the books in front of him. “Not using me just for your own benefit?”
“UH, I don’t think so.” A voice firmly said behind Harry. Harry turned around, shirtless, and confused. Draco held a box in his hand. Not a plain old cardboard box. A bright, red box, with a big gold bow on top of it.
Harry felt his vision blur, quickly wiping his eyes. This was stupid. Why was a poem from Draco Malfoy making him emotional? That aside, who was it even about? Who was ‘she’? He felt a tinge of anger. He didn’t want to get the discards of poems that were supposed to be for a girl he liked.
“I was just in the shower and forgot about the time, and-” she groaned. The three of them were too distressed to notice the doorbell ringing. “I ruined the Christmas dessert!”
He paused and the two stared at him, expectantly waiting for an answer. Hermione’s gaze, as usual, was somewhat judgemental.
She ran a hand through her hair. “You and Harry could meet here. Once a week or something. Spend some time with him,” she offered. “I do request that if you’re going to have sex, do it in the guest room down the hallway. In fact, you can hang out there.”
“Please shut up,” he said, quickly leaving the room. She exchanged glances with Astoria, who shrugged, frowning. He had been like this the past few months or so - easily irritable, almost fragile. But he hated that word. Fragile.
!” Draco whined, his face getting red as he embarrassedly turned to Harry. “She’s just joking… I didn’t wish that at all… pfft.” Harry simply snickered to himself, turning to Narcissa who was grinning, winking at Harry sneakily before returning to eat her food.
“How did you even get it?” Harry asked out loud, realizing he was way too bad at sign language to be able to understand him. “These were in my dorm.”
“I’m not,” Draco replied with an eye roll. “I didn’t want Harry to take it the wrong way so I made something up… okay, maybe I’m a little paranoid.”
Everything seemed lonely. It was so strange - him and Draco have probably been broken up for more time than they’ve actually dated, but this seemed like something he couldn’t get over. It had been two years, but he couldn’t just throw this away, could he?
Draco looked at him, a confused expression on her face, then cursed under his breath. “Pansy told me that you wanted to talk to me,” he shook his head in disbelief. “I did think it was strange that you asked her instead of just sending me a letter, but… whatever."
“Oh, Draco,” she smiled warmly, “you don’t need to apologize for anything. I understand completely.”
“This was the dullest Saturday ever,” Harry stated as the three walked down the hallway to go to dinner.
He broke eye contact immediately. Gulping, he tried to keep his smile as Molly Weasley got up from her seat, greeting him with a hug, followed by Ginny.
“I say, you’re being stupid,” Draco stated, looking down at his coffee. “Seriously. Don’t you think it’s better to just leave it? I mean, I already got three weeks of detention. I don’t need anymore at the risk of being caught. Besides, I’m a prefect.”
“No, I’m going,” he raised his voice, walking to the living room. Ron and Hermione followed after, and he stopped. Draco and Pansy left the bathroom as quietly as possible, trying to listen in from the hallway.
“I can tell. It’s a bit creepy, actually,” she commented, then flopped down beside him. “Tell me everything.”
“Fuck you,” he set his cards down, folding his arms. “This is the fifth time in a row you’ve won. You’re definitely cheating!” he exclaimed.
This is a short chapter, but I just wanted to post this so you know I'm not dead and I'm actually writing lol.
His smile faded. He set down his half-finished glass of lemonade, cracking his knuckles as he frowned. “I think… I should write to him.”
Someone lightly knocked on the door to Draco’s room. “Draco? I need to talk to you,” said Narcissa as she slowly entered. She was holding a book. She carefully shut the door behind her, frowning at Draco. “Why are you sitting on the floor when you’ve got a perfectly good chair over there?” She asked, gesturing to the chair beside him.
“I don’t even want to know…” he sighed, head in his hands. Harry was starting to make it a habit to sign while he spoke. It felt more natural to him this way, and it helped him become more comfortable with sign language. “I just don’t understand what his deal is. I never… I never wanted to be
bloody stupid,” Harry said with an eye roll. They slowly entered the Hall. Harry made eye contact with Draco and quickly looked away, starting to smile.
Draco didn’t need to say a word, he didn’t need to explain. Harry didn’t need to say words of comfort, he didn’t need to ask. All they needed in that moment, was one thing.
“I can’t have you failing the year now, can I?” Draco responded. “Don’t tell me you’re falling asleep. Honestly, if you were so tired, why did you even want to meet up?” Draco asked, continuing to stroke his hair, biting his lip.
pain in the ass,” Harry winked, grinning widely and fiddling with his necklace. “Good luck. I can’t even stand myself sometimes. I’m being a hundred percent serious-”
“Right…” he said. “If you’ll excuse me, then…” he stood up and left the room. This was how every visit was for him. It was lonely, cold, and silent. He thought of Harry, wondering if he was alright. They wouldn’t be able to communicate except for letters. Draco realized he would probably have to send his letters early in the morning to avoid the risk of his father or anyone reading it.
“Were you just with him?” she questioned, her eyes moved down to his neck, where a greenish-purple ‘bruise’ was just above his collar. “You need some concealer or something, honey?”
“Why, is Harry on the front cover again?” he asked, taking it from her hands, searching for Harry’s face. Narcissa eyed him, but didn’t say anything.
After a few moments, Draco awkwardly cleared his throat and looked down, before quickly eating his food and leaving the hall. Harry took it as a signal to eat his food as possible too, quickly leaving too.
“You’re the one who’s making it difficult!” Draco said outrageously, but begrudgingly put his hands out. “Okay.” He started signing the sentence but stopped halfway, forgetting how to sign one of the words, letting out a groan.
Harry rolled his eyes. What was he getting himself into? Strangely enough, though, seeing a stupid rhyme in Draco's poems every morning always made the day a little more bearable. By now, he had a small box under his bed with all of the poems from Draco. It felt too meaningful to throw away after reading.
When Draco entered, Harry coughed and set the soup down on the bedside table, trying to avoid his gaze.
“Harry. I simply do not have the time nor am I willing to put in the effort to argue with you over anything of this sort. We have
Draco stared at his mother for a few seconds, frowning, before nodding slightly. “I… I see. I didn’t know that you knew this whole time… Thank you for not saying anything to father.”
“There’s barely any space,” he started, but watched as the room suddenly grew significantly larger, more than enough space for them to dance, along with a dance floor. “I’m not sure if that was a requirement.” he groaned as some loud, ballroom dancing music started playing. “Music? really?”
I just wanted to thank you all for reading, liking and commenting this story. I honestly worked so hard on it and the comments make me so happy. I'm so, so happy you guys like this fic. Don't worry, I have quite a few ideas left so this fic will be continued!
“I don’t want to hurt you, Harry,” he whispered, holding back tears. “Pushing you away feels awful.”
“Draco, I have to. Here, hold on to my Cloak to dig your fingers into for the pain.” Harry handed him his cloak and took off, sneaking into the Hospital Wing.
And just like that, Dumbledore was gone. Everything would change. Nothing would ever quite stay the same anymore. Harry, as he moved down the stairs to chase the Death Eaters, tried not to think about what that meant for Draco and him.
He had been betrayed again. It shouldn’t have hurt this much. Harry found it abnormal that he was just in so much pain.
“Would you ever… tell me if you were asked to do Death Eater work? Because… you know that I’m here for you, right?”
The brown in Draco’s hair shined and glistened as Harry broke out of the bind, pushing the Cloak off of him.
“Harry, did you do your Potions homework?” Hermione asked, breaking the silence that was between the three as they sat in the library. Ron and Harry looked up from their textbooks.
“Well, uh, Arthur,” Harry gulped down the food he was chewing, setting his knife and fork down, clearing his throat awkwardly, “Draco and I are um… sort of, kinda, in… a relationship.”
“Okay,” Draco was too busy staring into Harry’s green eyes, feeling his warm hands against his skin.
“Yeah, ‘Mione’s right, mate. Don’t worry. I know this isn’t what you want to hear right now, but you need to let what’s happening pass. I know it feels like an eternity, but it’ll be over soon. Don’t worry.”
Harry exchanged glances with Draco, before sighing. “I’ll explain it later. For now, we need to focus on the actual matter at hand. It had to be someone from the group,” he spoke, turning his attention to his friends.
“If you’re sure?” Draco asked, pulling Harry closed to him so that they were cuddling close to each other. Harry nodded. Draco took in a deep breath, looking up at the ceiling before smiling slightly.
