Harry sat up in the blink of an eye, smiled and bit his lip. He looked over at the Slytherin who looked as if he had been staring at him and it made him blush a little. "Want to head back up to the library's secret room now?"
Cedric noticed the emptiness in Harry's eyes which he grew concerned about and told himself to keep an eye on Harry throughout the year. "My week has been great!" He hesitated and looked down at Harry with worry expressed over his face, noticing just how dull and down the Gryffindor looked. "Are you feeling alright, Harry?"
Cho got the giggles and covered her mouth with her hand. "So, Harry, are you two finally a thing now?" she asked though the kissing she saw told her it must be a yes. The last time she ever saw the two together was when they crashed into each other in one of the corridors and didn't lose eye contact. She bets they could have stayed that way for hours.
"Mr Potter?" called Professor McGonagall, standing a few meters away from him. She had no idea how her student will survive this. "The task is about to begin." Harry looked up at Professor McGonagall and nodded. He then got up off the ground and started walking off in the direction of the big tents with his professor by his side.
"Yeah, it was fun," said Ron with a shrug, remembering talking to Blaise a lot. The Italian Slytherin, as he found out today where Blaise came from, mostly flexed on about what he likes to do on the weekends such as going shopping or walking the maze out the back of his family's house. It was interesting to listen to, but he mainly watched the Slytherin bite his lip and it was somewhat amusing.
They heard a scream, a female scream. It's not the only scream they've heard tonight. But it was creepy as hell.
"Hello, Harry!" Hermione said, putting down a book about jinxes and placing it on the coffee table to her side. She noticed Harry's red chapped skin and smiled. It must have been because of last night. She hoped there was some kissing involved between Harry and Malfoy. "Were you out with Malfoy last night?"
Draco decided it was time to end the snogging session even if he didn't want to so he slowly leaned out, opened his eyes, and looked back into emerald green ones. He had a lot of words to describe what they just did and 'bad' wasn't on that list. the word 'bad' doesn't exist on his list of vocabulary describing words.
Joslyn looked over at Draco, smiling as he knew about her assignment. Wait... she thought to herself, biting her lip. He's been reading my work. How? I didn't know ferrets can read- Oh never mind, he isn't really a ferret after all.
Harry then sees a few pink, white, and red gifts on Dean's bed including a bunch of red and white roses wrapped in a pink ribbon. There is a cluster of roses on Seamus' bedside table and what looks like a bunch of chocolate boxes. Then it hits him. It's Valentine's day.
"I am not sure," Harry said a little quickly as he tried opening the Ravenclaw door. It wouldn't open either. There must be some spell to cast on it. The door looks quite old actually and the doorknobs look centuries old.
Hermione knew Harry was lying as she didn't see him eat anything for breakfast or even lunch. Except for half a sandwich, of course. She's beginning to really worry and feel concerned for Harry. She just doesn't know what's been happening with him.
The sound of footsteps running through the corridors makes Draco panic a little and look around. He would actually like the whole of Hogwarts to know about his and Harry's friendship, but he just doesn't want word spreading to his father about it. Who knows how his own father would react to him befriending Harry Potter?
George told Harry how they thought Ron was gay thanks to the Marauders Map because he was always sleeping with some guy named Peter. Harry laughed so hard at that and told George the whole story from Scabbers and everything, even though George knew the rest. However, the thought of Ron being gay did make him wonder if Ron would accept him which he still needs to let out. Yet again he still needs to come out of the closet to Ron.
"But mate, you've only nibbled on your toast," said Ron who looked a little worried at the little amount of food his best mate consumed. Not only the food but he was worried for his best mate who he knows doesn't eat much. "Aren't you hungry?"
And then the Grand Hall doors opened into the lightened room of the Great Hall. Harry, Fred, Hermione, Viktor, and the other contestants walked in. There were claps and gasps coming from around the room. Harry knew that the surprised and shocked gasps were because he came to the Yule Ball with a man. He looked at all the girl's confused faces and just smiled, glad he could come out like this. He looked over to the right side of the hall and saw Draco with Ivy and Pansy drinking butterbeer. He listened to the music that was playing, nearly tripping over his feet but managing not to.
"Of course, It's Pansy," Hermione said with a smile towards the Slytherin girl. She could probably faint from the sight of Pansy back in her Yule Ball dress again. "She's downright beautiful! Didn't you see her at the Yule Ball? That dress she was wearing looked so amazing on her but everything it seems looks incredible on her."
"Hurry up, Potter! You're walking slower than my grandmother when she's shopping!" Draco yelled with a smirk though the Grandmother part was a lie. She's unfortunately not alive anymore and he never got to know her either.
They walk down the Christmas decorated corridors together, admiring how well the professors and prefects had done when decorating. And then they walked into something which they couldn't get out of. They tried walking forwards, backwards, and to the side but they just couldn't get anywhere. It seemed that they were stuck in a sphere. They actually didn't mind it though as they were stuck together.
George got himself up of off the couch, his twin following, and started walking towards their dormitories. "Anyway, we're going to bed now, Harry," he said and gave a little wave goodbye. "Good night!"
"What about us?" he heard as he pulled Harry out of the Great Hall by the hand. He knew the voice was from Finnegan and Thomas. Right now, all he cared about was snuggling up to Harry on a bed or a couch.
Harry looked down at the wine bottle and smiled. "It's just a game where you spin the bottle and whoever the lid points at, you kiss them." But just as he touched the bottle, the sound of thunder in the distance echoed in the sky.
Harry was blushing as he put his right hand on Draco's waist and his left hand held onto Draco's hand. "Thank you, Draco," he says and is aware people are staring at them. He doesn't mind though. It's a good thing because it gives them the realization that enemies can become lovers in a rare occurrence.
Harry widened his eyes a little and stared at him in disbelief. His best mate had kissed a guy. "Oh my god, Ron!" He beamed. He never thought he'd be able to have a conversation like this with his mate. "How was it? Did you enjoy it?"
The boys looked under their desks, seeing two large birdcages that weren't there before. Harry reluctantly picked up the birdcage and placed it on the desk, asking himself why he was here when he should have ditched classes earlier.
"Wait, don't forget his sweets!" Narcissa said as she walked to the door and out of the room in search of some sweets to give her son.
The boys now faced each other. Harry placed his arms loosely around Draco's neck and Draco's hands slipped their way around Harry's waist. They had their foreheads pressed together and they stared into each other's eyes lovingly. The next flash goes off. Draco kisses Harry on the nose. The next flash of the camera happens.
All heads looked their way, but the boys chose to ignore them and sit at the Slytherin table. They began dishing up food on their plates and talking to Ivy and Blaise while Ron stayed quiet and ate in peace.
Harry returned to his bed with the single blade in his right hand, he rolled up his left blue pyjama sleeve and studied his bare scarred arm. He brought the blade to his left arm and slowly but quickly sliced the blade across his arm vertically. He let out a hiss of pain as he watched the blood slowly form in the cut he made. This is good, this pain is good, he thought as he watched the drops of blood slowly fall down his wrist.
Harry couldn't help but let every tear he had come out. This wasn't helping him at all. He felt even worse and felt like he needed to be alone. He knew what to do and how much he had to bleed. He pushed Draco away from him gently, even though he didn't want to. He could see the confusion written all over his boyfriend's face and he wiped his tears away, but it didn't help as more tears plummeted down his cheeks like rivers. "I'm sorry Draco," he said and broke down even more. "I don't deserve you; nobody deserves a freak like me. I'm not good enough. I'm just a pathetic-!"
Harry sighed at this news that he must go and looked to Draco with a smile. "Thanks again for the night, Draco," he says and leans away, intertwining their hands together. Then he leaned closer until his mouth was next to the blonde's ear. "I really enjoyed the time in your bed too."
"Why do you want to climb the tree, Draco?" Crabbe asked curiously, looking the tree up and down like it would give him a reason why his buddy wants to climb up the tree. It didn't give him an answer though, which was disappointing to him. Even Gregory was looking for an answer beyond the tree and from Draco.
But of course, as he entered the bathroom he couldn't cut. He just wouldn't. He wanted to, he had the urge to, but he couldn't. Not when Draco thinks he is safe in the common room or somewhere. He just didn't want to worry Draco. That urge was now twisting in his gut. He paced back and forth trying to think it away, he tried to rid it out of his mind as he splashed his face with water, but it didn't work. So, he just scratched hard at his wrist.
That just made Draco blush even more. Merlin... Potter can turn him on. "Right," he said awkwardly, rushing over to Blaise. "We have a dark git to help kill." He strolled down the corridor, yelling, "Let's go, Blaise!"
"Not if I get there first," Draco shouted back, smirking at the thought of the challenge he must beat Harry to. This is going to be so much fun.
Joslyn was patting her fluffy white ferret, who she found just today in a park and she named him Draco. Who wouldn't call a fluffy white-blonde ferret Draco, since he was transformed into a ferret by Mad-Eye Moody.
Two other people in the strangest uniforms were right behind him, a girl with fluffy brown hair and a ginger-haired boy. No way, Ron and Hermione?" she thought to herself, trying to hold back a 'Reeee' since she's a crazy Potterhead fan. She just couldn't believe her eyes. But Ron was taller and had a lot of freckles. He was nothing like Rupert Grint. And Hermione, who's hair was bushier and longer, definitely didn't look the same as Emma Watson. Gosh, it's like Joslyn just walked into another dimension.
Some of the other Gryffindors overheard Ivy singing. Some were looking confused whilst the others looked at her in amazement for her pure talent. Most of them even clapped and swayed along with her and the others.
Draco leaned in closer to Harry, stealing a kiss from his boyfriend and tilted his head to the side to make Harry believe he was going to deepen the kiss. He didn't. He quickly pulled out of the kiss just for fun, but he didn't want to.
When Draco noticed Ron had stopped at a picture of a large lady in a pink dress, he turned to Harry, trying to ignore the word Weasley said that opened the portrait into what looked like a tunnel leading into a common room, he pulled Harry closer and brought his lips to Harry's. Draco kissed him gently, pressing his mouth to the Gryffindor's. The feeling of fire completely consumed Harry, and he was lost in the kiss they shared. The kiss was a long one, full of mutual passion and a shared love. Harry buried his hands in Draco's white-blonde hair, running his fingers through it as he kissed him with an unearthly fire and passion. But then they finally broke apart, breathing heavily and staring into the other's eyes.
Harry caught the Slytherin staring at him and gave a small smile. "Are you coming to breakfast?" he asked and went over to grab his Firebolt from the wall beside Draco's Nimbus 2001. He needs to make a pit stop at Gryffindor Tower in his dorm room so he can put his Firebolt away. "I would dislike it if you weren't there, Draco."
Fred nodded and Harry watched as Fred's cheeks reddened, which made him chuckle a little. "Oh, um... I've never thought about that," he told the older Weasley twin with a quick side-smile. "I do think I'm gay. I notice myself looking at guys in Quidditch weekly more than I should, and Muggle magazines. But I just want to have my first kiss with someone that I like." The thought of kissing Fred just crossed his mind. He knew Fred was what? Two years older than himself but dang... those handsome looks.
Draco finally looked up into concerned emerald green eyes and smiled at Harry. “I love you,” he mouthed to the Gryffindor. He was so pleased to have Harry as his boyfriend in his life, especially since the Gryffindor always manages to brighten his day up with just a smile or a shimmer of his green eyes.
Harry looked around the room but the strange thing was He saw Ivy. Did Draco and Pansy not see her? Odd. He narrowed his eyes to see a little more clearly and saw that Ivy had a black flask in her hand and poured some reddish liquid into her Butterbeer. He smirked, thinking that it is probably a beer or some kind of wine.
He leaned away from Harry's prick – even if he could just watch it forever, but then Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's torso and flipped them both over so Draco was now lying on the bed and Harry was on top of him. Harry chuckled and Draco whimpered as Harry moved his legs to the side and let his prick dangle against Draco's arse hole.
Draco watched his friend hop onto the bed and silently lay there. What happened to jumping on the bed and acting all childish? He chuckled at him and walked up to the bed, rested his hands on one of the posts and watched Harry close his eyes, deep in thought. He just wanted to join him, be close to him, hug him, kiss him.
Dean moved on his bed, uncomfortable on the position he sat in. This was a little awkward. At least someone else found out about the relationship with Seamus that he has.
"I'm a lesbian," she said and gave his arm a little nudge with her elbow. Harry just nods at her as he knows this already because Draco has told him in the past.
He gave the head a nice kiss while looking up at Harry with his eyes, loving the way Harry's mouth parts from the pleasure and ecstasy he must be feeling and Merlin, he wants to feel what Harry's feeling. His cock is already throbbing from wanting the pleasured attention of Harry's hand, mouth, and tongue. Just the thought could make him come already.
Draco raced out of his bedroom through the double wooden doors, down the darkened hallways of the manor lined with windows as tall as two doors with long black velvet curtains that nearly touched the floor, centuries-old wall candles that lit up the hallways and dark wooden floorboards that seemed to go on for miles. As he neared a T section of a hallway which led to another side of the manor, he took a right and ran past the statue of 2 grey dragons, down the large silver and green luxury bifurcated staircase. Nearly tripping over the last step, he strode into the Entrance Hall to greet his beloved cousin.
Harry's attentions went on for a long time, and Draco became so worked up that he could feel the perspiration pooling in the shallow dip of his spine. He wondered how much more foreplay he could take, hoping against hope that he would have Harry's cock inside him in no time at all.
"Lumos," muttered Draco. The tip of Draco's wand had lightened up, flooding the darkened hallway with some light. Harry got out his wand and pointed it towards the darkness and muttered, "Lumos Maxima!" A great big ball of light escaped from Harry's wand and flew down the hallway, at the end of the hallway stood three doors in the shape of arches. One door was at the end of the hallway, the other was on the wall to the right, and the last door was on the wall on the left. Harry and Draco exchanged curious looks and continued walking down the hallway until they were right in front of the doors.
"Harry, look at me," a gentle voice said. Harry didn't want too. He didn't want to look at Uncle Vernon. He didn't want to get hurt.
Lavender looked up from her curried egg sandwich. "The Fat Lady's Portrait which goes into the Gryffindor common room?" she asked them quietly as she leant forward so they could hear her better. "I mean, it's easy enough."
Narcissa shook her head with a frown. "Nope, but I fear I have an idea of who he's currently with," she says a little weakly, and Draco also frowned, knowing whom his mother meant.
Narcissa shook her head. She didn't want to intrude on any possible relationships blooming between couples. "No, I think it is best if we leave that alone as what's important is the image of our son dancing with Harry Potter." She knew her Draco wasn't interested in girls, it's quite obvious when you've been shopping in Muggle London with him for the past years.
For payback, Ron walked over to the Ravenclaw table to Luna, bent down and asked her a question and Harry refused to look at Ginny. He instead, looked over at the Ravenclaw table to where Ron had disappeared to and saw that Luna shook her head. He felt kind of bored as he didn't want to know about his friend's secret shagging life. He stood up from his seat with a sigh and walked over to the Slytherin table and kissed Draco's cheek.
When Draco dug his fingers into Harry's buttocks, the split-second pain wrenched Harry's orgasm from his grasp and it barrelled out of him, flooding Draco's hole with an incredible volume of hot, slippery come.
Draco leaned up away from Harry and pinched his nose when he got a whiff of Harry's breath. "Augh!" he said and wrinkled his nose. He was only being a git of a boyfriend by saying that his boyfriend's breath stinks. "You have morning breath."
Harry chuckled at the Slytherin and his beliefs, pondering why he thinks so low of the Hufflepuff house when they are actually pretty nice. "And that's bad because...?" he asked the Slytherin and raised his eyebrow, making Draco's cheeks colour slightly.
Professor McGonagall sighed at her student. She pointed her wand at the half pig half cage on the floor and said the reverse spell, turning it back into a cage. "Mr Potter, it's your turn."
Draco had to admit as he stared down at a basket of muffins, that that was a very adorable story. But all that was on his mind was Harry, and that he hoped he was okay wherever he ran off to. He hopes Harry's safe and away from blades if that's what he uses if he does hurt himself. He wants to find out if Harry does use blades, or if he just deals with the pain. He needs to know.
"We do, don't we?" Draco asks but it wasn't really a question. Smiling at Harry's chuckle which he found adorable, he then took Harry to the library of the castle. From there they had to sneak through the library and try not to get caught by the Librarian Irma Pince. After a few shushes and giggles later when sneaking their way through the library, they were in the section of the library in front of the old bookshelf.
"Couldn't sleep," Ivy said and let out a yawn which she covered with her hand. "A girl that you don't know. Millie Rickson. She was having dreams about her boyfriend again. She started moaning and making kissing noises in her sleep, so I had to get out."
"Yes, my dear. I tend to go wild when shopping for an apology and gratitude gifts," Lucius said, levitating the bag with the two final gifts to Molly. "The last two are for your oldest two sons. Bill and Charlie, am I right?"
"A lesbian is a girl that doesn't want to date guys, she only dates girls," Ivy said and started picturing a Gryffindor with brown eyes and curly dirty blonde hair bouncing up and down as she skips along the corridors. "It's like the definition of gay but you swap the gender around."
Draco chuckled with his mouth not even halfway on Harry's cock, and he seemed to not care. He didn't care though. He was just enjoying himself right now. He was on his knees, his hands pressing Harry's legs outwards, and he accompanied a few more inches of Harry's cock in his mouth. He had about half of Harry's cock in his mouth when his left hand moved its way to the base of the cock and began jacking the rest of it.
Blaise stared at the centaur and rubbed his hands together as he had an evil plan to get to work on. "Hehehehehe. The plan is a go."
Harry blushed but continued to look at his best mate, even if he wanted a proper kiss with Draco now.
"PANSY!" Blaise and Draco grabbed her arms and pulled her away, knowing this was bad and they needed to escape.
Harry and the class turned their potions book to the required page quickly and read over the ingredients. 'Cherries, Chicken and spiders'.
Throughout the morning, Harry had been feeling quite lonely and depressed and time seemed to be going really slow. Ron still wasn't talking to him. It made Harry feel even worse as Ron was supposed to be his best mate and support him through this damned tournament that he shouldn't have been put into in the first place.
Harry stood up and quickly walked over to the Trophy Room, ignoring all the stares and the quietly whispering to each other. This was just great. He felt his social anxiety increase and that panic attack actually start happening, but he continued breathing deeply to try stopping the possible panic attack.
"Bloody Hell!" whispered Ron, rubbing at his thighs under his yellow and red checkered pyjama bottoms. He scratched at his cheek, confused about this weird lady talking to them when she's not in the room "What's a Purge?"
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. "You wish," he replied, trying to sound exactly like Potter was back in their second year. He hated when people were right other than himself. He admits that he is jealous. Jealous how Potter can get anyone he wants with just a blink of his eye. But he doesn't want anybody else, he wants Potter and he realizes it now.
"Yeah," Draco agreed with a distant nod. The manor looks brand new when every room is painted a slightly lighter colour than it was previously. It feels like they've moved into a new manor, or even their French countryside manor.
Harry turned to look at Hermione while Draco just stared at Harry like a lover. Harry didn't seem to mind the staring though. "I-, um-," he stuttered and looked back into Draco's silver eyes, hoping he'd come up with something other than 'snogging and sleeping together in a secret room for the night'.
Nothing happened with the cup and water of course. "Thermos!" said Sam and Jensen, their wands pointed at their cups filled with water. Harry actually smiled at this, thinking it was funny at how this friend of Mike's thinks that 'Thermos' is a spell. Maybe he needs to get a Thermos so he can use it in front of Ron and possibly Draco.
Draco's face reddened even more from the compliments. His pupils dilated and he licked his lips as he looked down at Harry's lips that he wanted to moisten by kissing him. He swallowed and said, "You have really pretty emerald green eyes too."
Harry grinned as he ran out of his professor's office. Where can he go? He decided to check the bottom floor of Hogwarts first, the basement. Mostly stunned bodies and a lot of bloodshed, nothing else. A lot of stunned bodies as he could tell. He sighed and with his wand, he sent a Patronus to Severus so he can take these students to the Funhouse. But he sent around five bodies, with a levitation charm, to the Room of Requirement. All the professors are in costumes, except Snape, and are around Hogwarts somewhere. When they see stunned students, they take their bodies to the Funhouse and lay them down in a room. Harry doesn't know what rooms, but he knows the students will wake at around 10: 15 pm at the max.
Ivy sighed and patted her cousins' head, to his displeasure. She liked doing it anyway. Annoying her cousin was fun. "You will be able to do it, I believe in you," she told him softly.
Seamus tried helping Cecelia, but the Nun threw Seamus across the room without even touching him. She made him land in a chair, just so she doesn't actually hurt him. She didn't want to hurt anybody, but she will just to make everything look real.
Harry looked at him with surprise. He couldn't believe that Viktor Krum would really want to go flying with him, and even better, with Draco as well. But Krum had mentioned flying with him after the first task and here he was asking again. He grinned broadly, "Sure! I would love to go flying-" Harry broke off as he saw something moving through the trees.
Draco smiles lovingly at him, wanting that kiss more than anything. He only gives him a little peck as he and Harry aren't alone in a room somewhere in Hogwarts. "Harry," he whispers and brings his hand up to cup Harry's cheek. "We can do this after class." Harry frowned and looked down at his classwork he had to do, and Draco frowned with him and got back to repotting the Leaping Toadstools.
"I'm going to have to go now," Harry says quietly to Draco though he doesn't want to go anywhere but stay in the arms of his lover who gave him heaven earlier. It was an incredible feeling which he's never felt before and he's glad it was Draco that he shared the pleasure with. "I'm probably going to get bombarded with questions from my dormmates relating to if we're dating."
"Dra-co," came the slow voice of a tired Harry Potter below them, and Draco and Blaise looked down at the half-asleep Gryffindor in Draco's arms. "What's happening?" He didn't even open his eyes, he just lay there, only his chest was moving up and down as he breathed in the citrusy scent of his boyfriend.
Harry looked up and saw the two boys who were snogging looking at him with sheepish smiles on their faces. "Um, hello!" he said and scratched the back of his head. Oh, what should he say? He walked in on them not the other way around.
"Seamus?" asked Ron, slamming the door behind them shut so the girl can't follow them. But he was sure the girl wouldn't as she disappeared. "What did you say to the ... girl demon thing back then?"
Draco sighed in relief and stared down at the ring Harry gave him for his birthday. "Thank you for believing me, Pansy," he said, watching as the emerald was shining beautifully in the morning light just like Harry's eyes do. He hoped Harry believed that he really didn't go to that interview. "This is why you're my best friend."
"Ron, please don't go there," Harry said with disappointment and collapsed backwards on his bed with a slow sigh. "I just wanted to make sure he wasn't-"
"Yeah, I guess," Hermione said and shrugged his hand off her shoulder. She just wants to practice the spells while a teacher is present instead of practising them in the common room. A long moment of silence had engulfed the trio, making the trip to Transfiguration seem even shorter.
He remembers the time during the war, when he was faking his death and Draco's mother came up from behind and asked if her son was okay. Such a dark time of his life, besides Sirius' death. Even the thought of Draco, back then, dead, really saddened him. Yes, they never got along well during school, but he did care for the Slytherin. Why wouldn't he? He cares about everyone around him, no matter how rude they are. But Draco's note rude, he's actually very sweet.
“I don’t see what you’re so worried about Pierre.” Daphne said deliberately emphasising his fake name.
Draco was already shaking his head. “No you won’t.” He said stubbornly. “We’ve talked about this, you know how I feel. I’m not a charity case. I accept your friendship and your support in that way. That’s been hard enough for me, you know that, to allow anyone in... to help me…”
Also he hadn't been out to the pub in a while either. He definitely wasn’t planning on getting drunk ever again, not properly anyway, but relaxing with a few drinks on a Friday night with a mate sounded nice. No whiskey, just beer, beer would be good. Draco hated beer and they didn’t even have any in the house. Not because he’d banned it or anything just because Harry hadn't really bothered to get some for himself. He enjoyed sharing a bottle of wine with Draco or guests when they had them, much more so than he used to, but if Draco wasn’t drinking then Harry didn’t see the point at home anymore.
“So, erm, how did the room decorating go?” He asked, stepping back from Draco slightly but still smiling at him. He never wanted to discourage him but he was worried now that he’d realised it for himself that he’d end up stupid blurting out the ‘l’ word at some point soon if he wasn’t careful.
“I have more evidence on Professor Snape’s actions and intentions that aren’t relevant to this trial but the Minister and I shall be clarifying his involvement in the war at a later date even if he... is no longer with us. But I will confirm that Professor Snape killed Dumbledore, not Mr Malfoy and I do not see why Mr. Malfoy should be punished for failing to fulfil Lord Voldemort’s orders.”
“Erm, he’s here but he’s going to stay in the players box with the family, sorry Harry.” George said quietly to Harry.
Potter paused for breath but he was still looking directly into Draco’s eyes. It was almost hypnotic.
“Look, Draco... when you’re at school houses matter I get that. Hell, I certainly didn’t have any Slytherin friends at Hogwarts and yeh... most of them I’ve worked with at the Ministry aren’t great... but I work with some Gryffindors that are right prats too!” He let out another little chuckle before his expression turned a bit more serious.
“I’m, er, I’m really sorry Fred but I, er, I promised… well you know, the boyfriend,” Harry stuttered not wanting to say Draco’s name out loud around here just in case. “That I wouldn’t hug you.” He finished awkwardly.
They’d had a breakthrough in the case yesterday and had a number of possible locations that could be the criminals headquarters but they wanted to hit them all at once in the hope that one of the groups would be successful and could call in the others. Ron was worried if they hit them one by one then the gang might become aware of the fact that the aurors were onto them and they would flee all the locations before the aurors could get to them.
“Er, the lounge I guess.” Harry suggested not wanting them in his private office or any of the bedrooms. “It’s downstairs but Blaise and Daphne know their way around.” He said casually.
Harry had tried to interrupt him several times but a loud slightly drunk Ron was hard to stop once he got something in his head.
“Yeah I’m sure you can.” Harry said flatteringly. “Feel free to try anything out in the kitchen any time. I’m sure between that cooked breakfast and Molly’s Sunday lunch I definitely won’t be hungry later so you and Kreacher you can feed yourself today!”
Potter smiled this time when he spoke. “No that’s great thanks, although I have to say I’m really impressed with how you can get me to speak about someone and then just know how to create a unique blend for them. I might just give you a list of everyone I know and their birthdays so you can handle all my gifts!”
For the second time that morning Harry was over in a flash sitting on the edge of the armchair, not thinking about what he was doing just acting on instinct as he so often did.
They both happily accepted their drinks and Draco walked around to the head of the table by the one empty chair.
“Harry dear, so good to see you.” She said pulling him into a tight embrace but he felt her looking over his shoulder as she did so. “Have you come alone? I thought I told you that you should bring this boyfriend of yours, I cleaned the house especially and I made your favourite-”
The truth was he wasn’t a massive drinker nowadays. He indulged a couple of times in nights out in Paris as it did help him forget but it also made him feel slightly out of control which he did not like at all. He had his own methods of forgetting things and preferred to keep his wits about him. He did like the taste of wine and enjoyed it as a pairing to food but he never over-indulgenced.
Harry looked at him but didn’t say anything. Fred reached over and took Harry’s hand gently again and pulled it into his lap.
He was supposed to be recovering from a broken heart. He was not supposed to ogling men, especially if said man was Malfoy. Get it together Harry.
It was Daphne’s turn to entertain them during dessert as Blaise drilled her for information about her budding relationship with George. Draco was surprised he hadn’t asked her the minute she returned from her date last night seeing as they lived together but then it was highly like that Blaise had been out himself until late. Draco stayed mostly quiet again enjoying the humours interactions that Blaise and Daphne had and happy to be out of the spotlight for questions.
By the time both twins had showered (turned out George won the race today!), got dressed into their casual clothes and returned to the kitchen, the curry was simmering away nicely and Harry had two more beers opened and ready for them.
“Shh, baby it’s OK, I’m OK. I’m sorry, you're right I’m an idiot. I’ll get the forms changed, I’ll tell the whole world that you’re
“I wasn’t aware that I had to tell you where I was going all the time and inform you the moment I came back.” Draco said defensively.
Draco got out his wand and levitated Harry, then he transfigured the desk chair into a small chaise longue that would be more comfortable and carefully lowered him onto it. He was completely out of it and barely stirred. Draco leaned over to kiss his forehead.
Harry grinned. “We broke into the Ministry during the war and stole a necklace right from Umbridge’s neck in the middle of her conducting a trial.”
“Merlin Harry must you be so crude and arrogant about it?” Draco said rolling his eyes and neither confirming nor denying how much he really did fancy Harry.
“You did the right thing. Don’t beat yourself up about it. Fred needs to learn that he can’t always get things on his terms. He can’t make his mind up about whether he wants a relationship or not and you were the perfect in between for him but it wasn't fair on you. He needs to learn that some people do want to get married and live happily ever after!” Harry noticed that George seemed a bit frustrated with his twin.
“Master Draco Black is in the fire calling for Master Harry? Kreacher is honoured to serve the noble house of Black. Kreacher will go fetch Master Harry for Master Draco. Master Draco be waiting there one moment.”
“I’m not opposed to that.” Draco said smiling slightly too but trying to hide it. He wondered how much further they might go tonight. “You’ll have to wait until Blaise and Daphne go though. Assuming you get back before they leave like last week anyway.”
“Well, he’s certainly got a sense of humour and I thought of him for you because you seem to have a bit of a mischievous side which he definitely does, he’s a bit of a prankster. He’s certainly witty in conversation; he could give you a run for your money I think.” He said with a fond smile.
“Oh.” Was Harry’s only response. That was strange, did he feel… disappointed by the fact that it was only a short term thing? A little… but it would make sense that Draco would rather live with his friends of course. Harry shrugged it off. “Sure, however long you need.”
Harry thought for a moment, he didn’t think Draco would mind if Teddy came round for a short time if Harry could give him plenty of warning and he could just lock himself in his potions lab for a while.
There was something in that look and the way he’d said ‘you’ that made Draco panic again. It wasn't the first time that he felt like Potter knew who he was but how could he? Surely if he’d worked it out he would have made a scene?! He probably would have hexed Draco and stormed out and there’s no way Potter would trust him with him if he knew who he was. Merlin, he could poison him if he really wanted to.
Just then Harry came into the room. He saw Draco with the photo in his hand but he didn’t seem to mind.
“Blaise!” Draco cried out. “Don’t tell me that now when we have to meet Harry in 10 minutes! What’s wrong with it? Should I go home and change?”
Walking down the stairs he was met with amazing smells coming from the kitchen. He’d been doing a bit more cooking with Harry this week and found it was something he enjoyed. He didn’t really know what he was doing yet, he mainly just chopped and stirred things but he was learning. The food around here was always good though and again he found himself very lucky to have found himself a man that cooked. There was something quite sexy about it too, watching Harry work in the kitchen.
They both had a tear in their eyes now. Harry had cried a fair few times in his life but he wasn’t a massive crier and he wasn’t sure if he’d ever seen Fred cry, not even at Percy’s funeral. He had the suspicion that the only person who’d ever seen him cry before was George. Fred buried his head back into Harry’s chest again.
They asked Ron if he wanted to stay for dinner but she said he’d rather get back to his wife and baby. He invited Harry over for their usual Friday night dinner together as the ‘Golden trio’ that they hadn’t done in a couple of weeks and Harry happily accepted. Draco had already said he was hoping to go with Blaise anyway, he was just waiting to see if the other man was free.
Blaise was the third man to throw his arms around Daphne in as many minutes but George didn’t seem to mind as Fred clapped him on the back looking just as relieved as everyone else to see Daphne unharmed.
“No Draco that’s-” Harry tried but Draco was in full force now. His wand was drawn and he was furious.
But Ron cut him off again with a groan. “Oh no, this is going to be harder than I thought.” Then he frowned and seemed to remember something. “Hang on mate, er, don’t you have some secret boyfriend or something? Merlin’s bollocks that’s even worse. I’m guessing your new boyfriend doesn’t know that you have a crush on your temporary housemate?”
“They might not be happy about it but that’s the thing with Ron and Hermione, that’s what I’m trying to explain to you, they always end up coming through and supporting me no matter what. Yeah sometimes we fight about it first but underneath everything our friendship is always still strong. They didn’t like me being with Fred but it didn’t stop us being friends. I’ll admit that there was a kind of awkwardness there about it sometimes but they didn’t really give me any grief about it after the first few months or so.”
Harry pulled him close and kissed the top of his head. “Remember we said that they will always be with you in here?” He asked, pointing to Teddy’s heart. Teddy nodded again. “They will still always be your family Teddy and we’ll make sure to put them on your tree.”
“Ron is kind too, he has a good heart and always wants to save people but he values his own life in a way that I have never done. He has a wife and a child waiting at home for him to return. He has a mother and a father who have already lost one son, siblings who have already lost a brother. Those always helped remind him that his life was worth something to others. He wanted to stay safe for them.” Harry was speaking in a soft romantic sort of voice that was soothing Draco.
“Hey yourself.” Draco said with a small smile on his own managing to find the words and stop himself from staring at Harry.
Fred looked up at George who had come to stand next to the table in between Fred and Harry and they had another one of their silent conversations.
“Of course.” Fred and George said instinctively at exactly the same time. The twins looked at each other and smiled then turned back to Draco and Harry. “What do you need us to do?”
As far as he was aware Lucius hadn’t had any dodgy dealings with anyone since the war. The ministry was still keeping an eye on him and mostly Lucius and Narcissa just kept to themselves. They hardly ever left the Manor anymore and they had more than enough money that Lucius never needed to work even after his business developments and investments had collapsed. He put the thoughts out of his mind determined to enjoy himself tonight. Lucius was not going to ruin everything for him.
Harry suddenly stood up straighter and looked around having obviously remembered about him now. Draco was mildly offended he could be forgotten that easily. Hmm, he would make sure Harry never forgot about him again.
“Ah such a shame, I have already promised them an exclusive on our ‘not-a-date’ date.” She said with a smile.
“Yes, I don’t want everyone flirting with you when you go out tonight.” Draco said with a pout that Harry knew was entirely serious even if it did look a bit funny.
Potter frowned slightly at him but seemed to choose to rise above it. A new one for him. Instead he gave a sensible answer.
“Again, not trying to pry or anything it’s just… well…” Potter started awkwardly. “I think maybe you’ve buried a lot of stuff too, I think maybe there’s still a lot about the war that you don’t understand and you haven’t dealt with. You could just read the book once it comes out of course but like I said, there are still some things that can’t be general knowledge. You write it with me and I’ll tell you everything.”
“To be frank I don’t care as long as it’s away from here. This hasn’t been my home since you invited a Dark Lord to murder and torture people within these walls.” Draco said, his loud getting louder and angrier. “Why did you think I left in the first place? I only came back because I had no choice but I’ve been working hard and saving my money and now I can afford to strike out on my own.”
Potter was quiet for a minute just looking at Draco and he suddenly felt a bit embarrassed that he’d gotten carried away, opened up too much.
Lots more fluff here but also some meaningful character developmentss with a couple of different relationships!
Harry and Draco also have their first day of romantic tourist attractions during the day but Draco plans something more authentic for the evening. At least his won't be romantic... right?!
Harry seemed to be affected by Draco moving closer to him. He took a small chance by trailing his fingers down the side of Biscuit’s head, stopping to rub his ear slightly and then sliding his hand to rest it on Harry’s thigh just lightly.
“Looks like I just did. Now you’re going to be thinking of me for the rest of the evening in front of Blaise and Daphne, not being able to touch me in the way you’d like and letting your mind wander to what I’m going to do to you tonight.” Draco said not even looking at Harry and speaking much more boldly than he felt.
“Well he said I did the right thing but it’s just hard when Jones is pissed off with me about it, I thought he was a decent bloke.” Ron said, shrugging.
“Blaise, it’s not your fault, please know I don’t blame you. You couldn’t have prevented the spell, we didn’t see it coming and the fire was too powerful for Aguamenti.” Draco said sincerely.
“Mr. Potter, although it would seem like you are in fact OK, you know we can’t let you go without a quick diagnostic check so if you would please return to your bed I can perform it for you. Once I am satisfied then you will be free to go.” He said in a professional but stern way and Harry knew the quicker he could get the healer to sign off on his health check the quicker he could go home. He didn’t even know exactly what happened.
“Yes you’re a real domestic God Harry, you're fit, you're rich, you can cook, you have a nice house, a house elf, no need for a job...” Blaise was ticking them off on his fingers as he said them. “Draco you should marry this one before I do.”
“Yeah,” Harry said nodding. “I think they’re really honoured to be involved and they both said they’re happy to draft something up about the Order with a bit more information for the public about what they were doing during the war. They said they’d run it by Kingsley as to what they could include and send it back to me in the next week.”
“I’m sorry neither of you ever knew your mother. I know how that feels.” Harry said reaching out to grip Graham’s shoulder quickly before letting go again. In a way it was funny to think of someone being part muggle but growing up as a witch not knowing the muggle world at all. It was almost the opposite of Harry’s life.
“I…” Potter sighed. “Yes I agree if you really don’t want me to. I think maybe we could discuss that again at the time. I’m not sure how much you know exactly about what she did and why other than what was said at the trials but we can talk about it. I agree not to try and contact her and I wasn’t planning on mentioning your father by name anyway. I will also agree not to tell anyone you’re helping me. I don’t know what happened between you and your family but if you want to keep your identity and your whereabouts a secret that’s fine by me, I’ve already promised not to say anything.”
He floo called Blaise on Thursday evening managing to catch him before he went off to wine and dine another potential client and told him he’d pick him up at 6:45 on Saturday evening before then going to meet Harry. Blaise agreed but he couldn’t stay and chat for long and Daphne had left work promptly as she had her first dinner date with George that evening so Draco was alone once again. He didn't mind though, he changed from his Pierre outfit and into his  comfy joggers and went to the cellar to get busy with his creations. This wasn’t technically work though, these were for Harry and Draco was determined to make them perfectly.
Ron was much slower to realise than Hermione but even he could pick up something from the way Harry talked about Draco.
Just like that Draco slipped back into his familiar Malfoy manner that he hadn’t had to adopt in weeks. “You’re welcome Mother. It is good to see you too.” Was his instinctive formal response.
Heading into the kitchen he decided to heat the leftover pie in the magical oven as they had time and it always tasted better than a quick warming charm. Then he set the table and got a beer out of the cooling cupboard for himself opening it and swigging straight from the bottle. He knew he probably drank too much but that was a problem for another day. He went back through to the sitting room and drank his beer whilst waiting for Fred and George. It was during these times that he wished he could put a TV in the twins flat but they didn’t really have anywhere good to put one in the small space and Arthur had said that Diagon Alley was far too magical to cope with muggle technology like that. Once again he wondered what wizards did in the evening without TV to watch, there were only so many books to read or games of chess to play! It was quite rare that he was relaxing here by himself though and he was never bored when the twins were in the room.
Just then the mood was utterly ruined by Kreacher appearing back in the kitchen floating a trio of bottles and mumbling rude about the french. Harry and Draco just stood there a moment staring at each other frozen in time as Kreacher moved around them.
“I have no idea what you mean Draco.” She said with the tiniest hint of a smile returning to her magazine.
His mother’s face was flicking through a number of different emotions and for the first time in his life Draco truly couldn’t read her. She didn’t seem to know what to say. Draco turned to nod at Blaise and then just walked ahead straight out of his suite. Blaise followed him levitating two large trunks in front of him. With any luck they wouldn’t even see his father on their way out and his mother could relay the news.
“We’ll keep you posted with the case at every stage. What is your preferred method of contact?” He asked.
Small warning, this chapter does talk about bullying behaviour and bullies at school so proceed with caution if that's something that might upset you but I hope I've addressed it sensitively. As always, constructive criticism is welcome if you don't think I have. It also briefly mentions internalised homophobia.
“I have a list of everything I need for the shop and I assure you it will look very good. The contractors are coming in tomorrow to transform the space based on the designs I drew and I know exactly how much it will cost, that’s fine I have the money set aside. I will be honest and say that I have a small amount in the budget to make my living space more homely, that money will now have to be used to buy clothes. I can get away with fewer items that I had before but I will need to look good to meet any customers. Appearance is everything when you are trying to secure people’s business, I don’t need to tell you that, but I’m not as vain as I used to be. I actually prefer to brew and create in comfortable clothing anyway so that won’t cost a lot. The furnishings for the flat I can live without.”
Maybe sex was just what he needed though, perhaps he could go with Blaise when he next went out in the Muggle world as no one there would know him. He was a good looking guy, he could get someone easily he knew that. He made up his mind to ask him about it at dinner tonight, that would help him get Potter out of his head.
Despite the fact they said they’d do it on Monday, they didn’t get round to discussing the fourth year stuff that evening. Harry had gone for a run, he said he hadn’t really been in a good head space after starting to write his fifth year memories and Draco sensed that this would be where it would start to get hard for Harry. He was a little worried about how digging up all these repressed memories would affect Harry but all he could do was to be there for him as they had been there for each other over the past couple of weeks.
Not wanting to think about what Harry had written just yet and not knowing whether he wanted to pursue Harry as more than friends or not he decided to put it all out of his mind for now. Daphne would be here soon to open up the shop so he headed downstairs ready to greet her as he always did.
In that moment it was just the two of them in that room both trying to understand one another, both thinking for so long that they had been on different sides of the war yet, seemingly, that illusion had just shattered. Did Potter really believe the words he was saying? But then why would he say them? Potter turned to look back at the Minister which is when Draco vaguely realised he was speaking again, conducting the trial once more.
He sat up on the bed and Draco did the same. Then Harry slid his hands over Draco’s shoulders and peeled the open shirt away from him as he had done to Harry. After that he gripped the base of Draco’s t-shirt and slowly pulled it over his head, Draco raised his arms to help and Harry discarded the white tee on the floor somewhere.
“It’s OK, it’s probably a safe bet to assume that to anyone who isn’t as insecure as me.” Draco laughed slightly in a self-deprecating way.
Sunday was every bit as hard as Harry thought it was going to be as he stepped into the kitchen of the Burrow and was immediately accosted by Molly.
Draco called into the shop quickly after breakfast to check in on Graham. He examined all the potions the shop assistant had made yesterday and the stock list that he’d done and was pretty impressed. It was a relief to him to know that Graham could be relied on and he made sure Graham knew how much his help was appreciated. He gave Graham the job of restocking the shop and brewing the additional potions that were needed for the shelves and he took the list of perfumes and other products that needed restocking back to Grimmauld Place to make as he didn’t quite trust Graham with those yet.
“I’d give you the whole world if I could.” He whispered, kissing Draco on the head and then scoping him into his arms ready to carry him to bed.
“Yeah I thought I’d incorporate an early morning swim in with Biscuit’s walk if that’s OK with you?” Draco asked. “I haven’t been for a proper swim all week but it’s something I usually do and Biscuit loves the water too, but you can walk him on the beach if you don’t want to swim.”
“I think I also just never quite felt safe there though and it was getting to me more and more even before Mother came to the shop. We all have our ways of coping... I don’t take potions but I- I meditate before bed routinely. I’m very strict about it, it’s the only way I can block out the negative stuff in my brain before I sleep. The trouble is it’s most effective if I’m in a calm, safe space to begin with so as time went on it was becoming more difficult for me to soothe my mind before bed in the flat. This room here… it’s just so nice and relaxing I can’t tell you what that does for me. Plus I had another bath last night while you were out and that really helps too.” Draco finished softly as Harry turned back around to face him.
“That is all I ask for now, Mr. Malfoy. We shall speak further on this matter once term has started. As you know, we will need to meet monthly so I can assure the Ministry you are meeting the terms of your probation. For today’s meeting let us simply discuss the first month of your probation.” She looked down at some notes and letters on her desk. “I have been having regular correspondence with Auror Proudfoot and he assures me that you have been compliant with all the security measures at the Manor.”
George turned back around to look at him. “Why? Got someone special waiting at home for you?” He asked with a grin.
Daphne nodded again. “I thought you’d say that. I’ve already closed the shop. It’s as secure as it’s ever been. Let’s go back to Blaise’s and we can sort something out.”
It was around five o’clock on Tuesday that Kreacher came into his study to tell him that Draco was calling him from the fire. Harry jumped straight up and sprinted to the drawing room desperate to see the man.
P.S) for anyone interested in Draco's bracelet I have put an inspiration picture on my Pinterest page for this story (link below). I know that selenite is not often used in jewellery as it's quite fragile and scratches easily but this is magic jewellery so... I'm sure it can be magically reinforced and protected!
“I do need your help Harry. I know I don’t deserve it after the way I treated you though and I want you to know how sorry I am.” Draco paused. “I genuinely already made up my mind yesterday that I would come and apologise to you and explain things. I probably would have done it tonight regardless but I will confess that certain circumstances today have forced my hand slightly which I am annoyed about as I am worried it will make my apology seem less genuine.” He said eloquently.
“Come on then get dressed, it’s already half nine and I haven’t had my morning coffee.” Harry said giving Draco’s naked arse a playful slap.
evening to get Potter drunk and learn all his secrets could be fun. He pretended to take longer to think about it as he cleared up behind the bar.
“Trust me Draco it wouldn’t” Harry insisted. “It’s a good department now I swear, it’s not like it once was. There is a strong system in place and it works. Also, to be honest with you, not a lot happens now, half the job is stopping drunken duels and dealing with petty thefts. An unforgivable would go straight to the top team and would be a priority case. There are good guys in there now, we worked hard to get rid of prejudices at the Ministry and they wouldn’t treat the case any differently with the name on the file. You have two witnesses, even if your mother won’t speak out then Blaise is still a witness. Lucius only narrowly escaped Azkaban after the war but he was told he needed to be an exemplary citizen from now on. He had a life sentence once before, this alone would be enough to put him back inside for sure.”
Harry started grumbling and stirring slightly. He reached out to put his arm around Draco and pulled him closer without actually opening his eyes. Draco leaned over to kiss Harry on the forehead.
“My mother would come to the school room or my bedroom sometimes, that was nice and I think she wanted to do more but he had power, influence and eyes everywhere. The house elves in the Manor were required to report everything they saw to him so there was no escaping… I vaguely remember my mother reading to me when I was really young but then my father said that it was the information in the books that I needed to learn, it didn’t matter who delivered it and that she had better things to do. So he had the house elves read to me after that until I could read on my own and the books were always educational, never fun… Every now and then there were little moments when I thought that my mother cared for me, I think she does really, but she was always Lucius’ wife first and my mother second. Which makes my relationship with her complicated. I think there would have been hope for us, but part of me resents her for not trying harder to be the mother I needed. I sometimes wish she would have stood up to Lucius more but then I guess I can’t talk really…”
“I am sorry I worried you Mother.” He reached out and tucked his arm through hers as he led her back into the rose garden. She was right, it really was rather nice out here. “You were right I suppose, yesterday was… difficult and I believe the rest has done me some good. Thank you. Let us sit, I would like to have your company for a while.” He said equally formally but much warmer than before.
Sadly my mental health has not been good, I've basically been hiding away from the world and I just wasn't in the right place to write.
On reflection he was rather looking forward to having something else to focus on and challenging his mind into something useful. He knew he didn’t need to work really, he could live off the Malfoy estate for the rest of his life but he had to do something. He was unconvinced that anyone would actually hire him but at least having good qualifications wouldn’t hurt.
Draco was fidgeting very uncharacteristically and rubbing the empty space on his finger where the Malfoy heir ring used to sit. It was a nervous habit he’d picked up since removing the ring this morning. He hadn’t worn it the whole time he was in France but he’d had it on the past two years to keep up appearances with his father and now being without it felt strange again. He’d left it on his bedside table purposefully.
His mind made up, he made towards the stairs and out into the shop below. Verity was behind the counter, Harry suspected Fred was out the back making a start on the owl orders but he didn’t look for him or George. He greeted Verity politely and went out the front door into the street. He stood outside the new shop for a few moments giving it another look close up. True, it was a little bit poncy for Harry’s taste but it was also very sophisticated and really rather beautiful. He read the sign in the window about bespoke gift baskets and thought it was the perfect excuse to speak to the shopkeeper about something for Hermione. It would be nice to get something especially made for her anyway. He still couldn’t see anyone inside but it was definitely open so he placed a hand on the black wooden glass panelled door and pushed it open.
… the smooth muscular skin felt amazing beneath his hand and he just wanted to keep touching it. He wanted to carry on exploring this feeling that was on the one hand very familiar but on the other hand new and exciting.
“It’s alright.” Potter shrugged and he genuinely didn’t seem to mind as he carried on. “After the battle, we found... comfort in each other you know, we've always been close and there was part of me that really wanted to be with her again. I missed her last year, I thought about her so much when we were on the run and I always thought if we made it out somehow that we’d be together. I think she did too but it just wasn't the same… I went back to the Burrow with them all, I didn’t really know where else to go. I thought Ginny and I could spend time together but it was hard being there... after Fred… We were kind of
Draco knew what his friend was doing but had to admit it was a clever proposal. It allowed Blaise to help him but still get something out of himself so it didn’t really feel like charity, especially if he was paying for Daphne too. Draco also considered the fact that he likes spending time with his friends both separately and together. Given the fact that he would see Daphne at work everyday this would work well and he also very much likes routine and would probably look forward to being properly fed twice a week. He could survive on sustenance potions the rest of the week if he had to.
“It’s fine, wear whatever you want.” Harry said casually, standing up and walking past Draco and into the kitchen. “I’m glad you feel comfortable enough to do so.” He called over his shoulder.
“You know the business must be making enough money by now for you to buy a couple of owls.” Daphne pointed out. “It’s got to be cheaper in the longer run than renting the post office owls each week.”
“Of course I have.” Draco said defensively. “I just clearly haven’t looked properly, I don’t have a lot of time but I’ll definitely get some… things in.” He said, trying to cover his tracks.
Hermione gave him the tiniest smile and it was the first time her face softened and seemed less serious. “Do you- do you love him?”
“Draco, I know Sunday kind of made things a bit awkward between us but we’ve both said sorry and explained our side of things so can we just move on now?” Harry started. “Like, we can learn from it so stuff like that won’t happen again and I think we both need to get better at expressing how we feel but otherwise let’s just pretend it never happened?” He suggested.
Draco was waiting for Harry in the kitchen. The minute Harry walked in Draco was all over him. He vanished the bread bowls wandlessly and accepted Draco’s advances.
“I let them in. It was via a vanishing cabinet in the room of requirement at Hogwarts school. I spent a lot of time during my sixth year there repairing it. The other was at Borgin and Burkes, they formed a passage.” He said, defeated. More muttering of the Wizengamot broke out.
*Trigger warning: very slight mention of a suicidal thought in Draco's speech towards the end of the chapter
“Of course, anything you want to include is fine.” Harry reassured him. “I’m going for a run first though this morning.”
“Yes there was actually.” He said politely. “I have actually been a customer of Monsieur Defoi -Sorry if I butchered the pronunciation there- for a while now. I have a weekly standing order with him and have been impressed with the quality of his potions. I think that this shop is owned by him and I guess I was eager to check it out. It’s nice to see that he has a premise now with more products.”
Draco swallowed trying to fight back the tears that were threatening to spill over again. “I don’t even know why… I guess I was just scared really. I’ve always been a coward. I just didn’t want him of all people to see how I was living. I- I wanted to impress him. I wanted to show him that I’m- that I’m worth something. That I’m a self-sufficient business man who has made something good from his life… I thought if he saw how I was living he’d see how worthless I am, how pathetic and useless I am that I can’t even feed myself because I don’t know how to cook or where to even shop and that I’m secretly poor…”
“So that’s where you were staying before… with him?” Draco said thoughtfully again although he still didn’t seem to mind.
Harry stopped what he was doing and turned to Draco with a look of surprise. “What? You serious? I thought it was just old storage down there, I’ve never looked. I was a bit afraid of what I’d find to be honest. We always saw Kreacher going in and out of that room during the war, we figured he was hiding stuff in there too that he didn’t want us to get rid of.”
She looked at him curiously for a moment before asking something which he did not expect. “Has Harry told you that he loves you?”
“It seems like her heart just stopped beating in the night while she slept. They’re not too sure yet but they think she might have had a weak heart for a while but just no one knew about it. I dunno if she just didn’t tell anyone how she was feeling or if she just didn’t really notice her own symptoms… If they’d known they probably could have healed her but now it’s too late.” Blaise said sadly. “She was a lovely woman, really sweet. She was always nice to me whenever I went over.”
“I could have so easily become a killer that year though, at sixteen, my soul would have been ripped apart forever. I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.” Draco said quietly into Harry’s chest. “I nearly didn’t you know… live with myself I mean… I nearly threw myself off the Astronomy tower several times that year… I used to go up there sometimes at night and just wonder whether it would be better to just let myself fall… It’s fitting really in a twisted way that’s how it ended for him…”
Harry knew that Draco still had difficulties, saying Dumbledore’s name. They’d talked that all through obviously that first day they’d really spoken about anything. Draco knew logically that it wasn’t his fault but it still didn’t stop him feeling guilty about his death in a small way. Harry understood that feeling, it was how he felt about Sirius.
He bought all the things he needed from her and told her to keep the change as she had been so helpful and then went off to buy the fish that she had recommended. After that he looped back to the stall he’d seen earlier that had a large selection of vegetables now he knew what he needed.
Draco wasn’t sure how much he was allowed to just go snooping around but Harry seemed pretty relaxed and he figured if his house elf said it was OK then it would be. “Harry said there might be some space down there for a potions lab, would I be able to go down and have a look please?”
The woman, Mattie apparently, had got a blue Nokia phone out of her pocket but put it away at Malfoy’s words. “Hmm, well I’m getting you both a drink to celebrate regardless.” She said stubbornly.
Draco shook his head and looked down at the bed. Harry wasn’t sure how much to push this, he didn’t want to upset Draco but he wanted him to know how important this was to him.
“Master Malfoy is very kind to be wondering about Pinky. Pinky has been staying safe at Hogwarts sir on Mistress' orders. Pink even fought in the battle sir which Pinky is proud of! Us house elves followed Harry Potter’s elf sir and Pinky wanted to protect Mistress and Master but Pinky is pleased to be back sir now that Mistress has returned and all is well. Although there is much work to be done to get the house back in order.” Pinky spoke freely in a way that Draco had never heard before.
“Oh yes, I did actually come to say something about that.” Harry started. “Hermione just floo called me, Rose has got a cold and she’s not feeling great either so she asked if we can give tonight a miss which I guess means that I’ll be here but if it’s a problem then I can go-”
If he was honest with himself Draco always felt incredibly guilty for the way he’d treated the man recently, especially during sixth year. Looking back, he realised he had only been trying to help but Draco had been too scared to accept it so. He’d pushed everyone away that year, he thought he had to cope on his own. When he was Headmaster, Snape had done his best to protect Draco from the Carrows, he knew that and was grateful for it but the two of them hadn’t really talked, they never really reconciled. He regrets that now, there is so much he would ask him if he had the chance.
He just shrugged but smiled anyway. “It’s just so empty, shagging some guy in a club. Just doesn’t do it for me anymore. It never really did in the first place but at least it was kind of fun before. It made me forget for a while but now…” He sighed. “I thought I was happy being alone, I haven’t felt anything about it in ages but then, erm, well, something happened to make me feel something again and now I want more but I can’t have it.”
“Interesting.” Said Harry carefully, already smiling at his next words and still looking for any reaction from the twins. “I actually thought he was a perfect mix between Bill… and Draco Malfoy.”
“I don’t think you’ve used me, not at all. That was the whole point Harry, you remember? That’s what I told you all those years ago, that I would be here for you for anything you needed until you found the one who could make you truly happy.” He insisted.
“Fit?! Are we talking about the same Harry Potter? The scrawny boy with ridiculous glasses and atrocious hair?!” Draco said looking at Daphne suspiciously.
Dinner seemed to last an awfully long time though as they had dessert as well and then for some bizarre reason Narcissa asked Kreacher for a cheese course. Even by the end of all that it was still only half eight but Harry just couldn’t take it anymore. He made his excuses saying that he had a bit of headache and he said it would be nice for Narcissa, or Ms Black as he kept having to call her, to catch up with Draco. He pointed out politely that Draco could show her around and she had two house elves now seemingly who would attend to her needs. He told her through slightly gritted teeth to make herself at home and then took himself to bed much earlier than he usually did and for once, without Draco.
For years he had longed to get away from his parents but now that he had he felt their loss. He no longer had a father in his mind and that was fine by him, he never wanted to see the man again. Part of him knew that he still had a trace of the mother’s love he had always longed for and she had shown that today. She had let him go when he asked her, she’d been on his side when it mattered the most, but what would happen now? Would he ever see her again? Would she be able to have a small part in his life or was he effectively an orphan now? He also felt guilty that he had left her. She didn’t have any family left and she lost contact with all her friends after the war. She was alone in that big house with him. He knew rationally that he couldn’t do anything about that, she had married him and she had failed to protect her son from him, Draco couldn’t feel guilty for rescuing himself from that situation.
“Excellent, we have a majority. Sentencing of a 12 month probation period has been passed. Mr. Malfoy, you may leave the courtroom with your mother and return to Malfoy Manor where you must remain until term starts again at Hogwarts school. You may collect your wand on the way out and Professor McGonagall will arrange a suitable time with you for your first probationary interview. Good day Mr. Malfoy.” The Minister concluded the trial and the Wizengamot started rising to their feet and just like that it was over.
“Yes, let’s. Thank you George.” She replied fondly and allowed herself to be led over to them with George’s other hand just gently pressing into the small of her back.
He nodded once to her and then left the room. After checking in with Hopsy about dinner he went to get changed into something more comfortable. His mother wanted to see what they were like here together then fine, she would. He thought smiling to himself as he put on a pair of grey cotton jogging bottoms and a simple black long sleeved top. Definitely not a look his mother would have seen on him before. Then he went to check in on Harry who was still sleeping deeply where he left him.
“I guess, what I’m trying to say is, in the real world you learn to make your mind up about people yourself, not judge them based on what some old hat thinks they’re like at 11. I’m an auror, I know how to read people, it’s part of my job and... from what I’ve seen, you’re alright.”
Harry felt that panic and discomfort at those words in the same way he did whenever he thought about the forest. “Kind of.” He said in a slightly shaky voice.
“Well we both actually agreed that the two of you ending up together seems kind of inevitable in a way. Weirdly it seems to make a lot of sense and with who you guys both are now… well we can see you being good for each other… but…”
Draco made Harry promise him that he would do more cooking when he went home because it seemed to make him happy. He understood the importance of healthy eating for athletes of course but he hoped that Harry and his team would find some sort of compromise.
They entered the meeting room and Ron immediately started waving his wand on the big screens they had in their bringing up a big picture of Lucius Malfoy and everything they had on his file. Quickly the seats around the table began filling up with a small team of aurors, about ten including Harry and Ron.
A couple of hours later they were relaxing in Blaise’s luxurious sitting room looking out the big glass panels onto the nighttime views of London with some cocktails. Cocktails were Daphne’s favourite and she’d gotten a bit carried away at the bar that Blaise had in his apartment, waving her wand around to make all sorts of colourful mixes. She said they were celebrating but he still didn’t really know what.
“So, I believe you wanted to discuss a bespoke gift basket for a friend?” He asked, reaching over for his quill again ready to make notes in the book in front of him still not meeting Potter’s intense gaze.
“No.” Harry said so suddenly that Fred and George looked at him again. He sighed knowing he needed to say it. “Draco implied I was an addict… he said it was pathetic… but I’m not though… right?” he added with uncertainty.
“Oh I’m counting on it!” Said Blaise happily. “Won’t be the first time they’ve printed that you’re gay!”
“Fine! I’ll listen!” Draco huffed taking a seat next to Blaise and reaching over to get the Pad Thai dish he’d ordered. “So, erm, did you mention Potter- er, Harry, and some security measures?” He added quietly.
Daphne smiled with a knowing look. “Perhaps not for too much longer.” She said cryptically. “And Slytherin has nothing to do with it, I actually think he’s got a bit of a Slytherin side himself.”
Walking into the room it wasn’t like anything he’d expect to see in a Black family house, actually it wasn’t like anything he’d expect to see in any wizarding house. He’d only been to pure-blood homes after all or Blaise’s penthouse. Clearly Harry had redone the whole place. It was a modest room, not really that small but it had lots of furniture in which made it seem quite cosy. It was quite simple and stylish still but slightly less modern looking than the kitchen and a bit more homely. It had quite a masculine feel to it again with a darker colour palette of rich browns and deep greens but there were lighter tones thrown in so it definitely didn’t feel oppressive. In fact it was very nicely done and there was something about it that was very Harry. Draco had half wondered if his whole house would be in Gryffindor red but he was pleased to see the greens. Green was his favourite colour. Green like Harry’s eyes...
“Yeah but we’ve already established that there might be more to that engagement that meets the eye… and he could be bi anyway.” George countered.
Draco couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped him. “You two have thought about this a lot! You’re crafty little snakes through and through aren’t you?!”
“Not at all, it will be nice to see the house being used more and it’s nice to feel like I’m helping.” Harry shrugged. “We’ll set it up tomorrow.”
“I have been returning to some of my old ladies circles, lunch dates, shopping trips, that sort of thing.” She explained. “Just trying to keep my ear to the ground and pick up anything new. It was hard at first, I feel like an outsider now and many of my old friends are long gone but I managed to pick up little things here and there from conversations and magazines. I started hearing lots of positive things about a certain new french potions and perfume shop that had recently opened up in Diagon Alley so I decided to check it out. As soon as I walked in I could see you all over the place, in your design, your drawings, your labelling.”
“Do you have plans to meet him again? There isn’t anything in the diary I assumed he was sending your gift directly to the recipient.”
As always if anyone wants to see pictures that inspired some of the outfits, places, food and other things I describe then you can check out my Pinterest board. Just be warned that I use it to plan future chapters and just pin things as I see them so there are spoilers for future chapters and indeed future stories on there.
“Of course.” Narcissa said in her stiff formal manner. Blaise and Daphne nodded but said nothing. Draco just sat there silently.
Blaise sat up straighter and looked at him in the eye. “Do you actually want me to look for a secure place for us to live together?”
Draco knew that Daphne was the sort of person to think very carefully about every aspect of her outfit and her appearance usually said a lot about her. This outfit was feminine but fun and very carefully balanced between the sort of outfit you’d wear out with your friends for the day and the sort of outfit you’d wear on a date. That was interesting to Draco and he then remembered the other men that would be in the box with them. Was she adding these playful patterns and colours to attract a certain famously fun prankster? Would she truly be interested in one of the Weasley twins? Draco just couldn’t see it.
Fleur who was hovering nearby saw Teddy and recognised this emotion too. She mouthed to Harry to check he would be OK but Harry could see her already struggling with a crying baby Louis in her arms and Dominique running around her legs so he gestured to her that he would be fine but thanks.
Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d cried but suddenly he was crying about everything. He was crying about the fact that he was lost and lonely and so fucking tired. He was crying about the fact that he just wanted a normal happy life but he didn’t know how to get it. But most of all he was crying about the fact that he’d just allowed himself to believe that he could be happy, he’d just allowed someone in who he thought could be the one and he’d fucked it up already.
Talking about shop management got Harry thinking about the shop opposite again and what would be going on there this morning. Well truthfully he hadn’t stopped thinking about Draco. He realised now more than ever how much he’d grown to care about him in such a short space of time and the idea of not having Draco in his life was much more painful to him than his hand. He would spend today thinking about it and making a plan for how to apologise to Draco and win him back. It might take a long time but Harry was stubborn and he wasn’t giving up.
Draco mentioned he was hoping with Graham brewing at least one day for him in the lab at the shop that he could still have Sundays off but that would depend on Graham’s skill level and how much Draco could delegate to him. Overall Harry agreed that it was a good plan and apparently Daphne was pleased with it. She liked Graham enough from what she knew of him at school and their brief meeting today to welcome him onto the team. Harry could tell Draco seemed much more relaxed tonight and remembered what he said before about needing structure in his life. This was good, things were all working out.
“No one else can know what they would have done in another person’s situation.” Harry said gently. “I mean, yeah maybe if I was in your position and if it was just me that would have paid the price then yeah I probably would have done but what good would that have done in the long run? If you’d have stood up to Riddle and he killed you then you’d be dead and he’d find someone else to do what he wanted. But it wouldn’t have been you who paid the price anyway I’m guessing. You did it for your mother right? He was threatening her life if you didn’t do what he said?”
"I- I can't. I couldn't. It's too much to bear." He couldn't risk to be inhibited by such a relationship with anyone other than Delphi.
He glared at the wall in front of him, eyes fixed at the hole through which his serpent used to enter his miniscule abode. She was far too large now, her body was the diameter of an American football. Several times larger than the small rodent sized entryway. So, for a couple years now he slept entirely alone. No longer able to depend on the loving comfort of Delphi when he woke up from his nightmares.
"I don't think I've seen her, mister, sorry. I think you should be going, my mum doesn't like me talking to strangers. I'm supposed to be weeding." Harry did his best to appear anxious about his 'mum' being upset, instead of the danger posed by this stranger. Harry realized he was leaning awkwardly to take pressure off of his tail bone. He straightened his posture, his jaw tightened at the twinge of pain.
"I've waited a long while for this!" Growled Vernon, a grin spreading across his face. He was straddling Harry's hips now, Harry could feel the man's warm sweaty crotch grinding against him. Vernon stroked Harry's cheek, as the child shied away.
As he closed the door behind him, she walked toward her desk and leaned heavily on it. Her whole body seemed to sag with the weight of what she was being forced to do. She slowly trudged to her quarters, to rest and prepare for tomorrow's task.
On instinct his magic lashed out, and grasped the disc in the air; it remained there, suspended, Harry's hand extended towards it. Suddenly, a cold wash flooded the kitchen. The hairs on the back of the obsidian haired child stood on end.
Harry yelled and swiped his hand through the air in front of him like a claw, large gashes appeared along his front. The obese man's abdomen split open along the most prominent laceration, his intestines and waxy yellow fatty tissue spilling onto the floor in front of him. Vernon no longer had the strength to struggle anymore, his body went limp, the light drained from his eyes.
The bearded wizard contemplated her words for a moment, her breath felt as if it were caught in her throat.
The flavours melded and complimented each other. Harry couldn't hope to finish it all, he's never eaten anywhere near this amount of food in a single sitting, ever. Halfway through the second waffle, and as he started his second leg he began to feel nauseous from the amount of food in his belly. He sat back, his stomach uncomfortably full, and waited for his server. He asked for a to-go box as the man passed.
Harry was frustrated, he had been standing on the corner trying to get some attention for 15 minutes. Finally, Harry decided to call out a particular man on the street.
He marveled at the virtual mountain of food in front of him. He doubted he could finish it all, but he decided to dig in. He tackled the waffles first, occasionally taking bites of the fried chicken. It was delicious, the waffles had a crispy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The combination of the sugar and the syrup added a delectable layer of sweetness. The chicken was also amazing, sweet and tender thigh meat coated in a crispy and crunchy exterior. The breading was flavourful, tasting of rosemary, thyme, and dill.
His mind raced to discern some explanation or possibility. The bittersweet taste of the food and water made sense now. Harry managed to calm himself down to think properly, and reached into his core for his magic. It floundered and slipped in his grasp, as if it were a water balloon coated in oil. He couldn't pin it down and allow it to flow. Anxiety crept back into his mind, flooding with terror over not having his magic to defend himself as planned.
Soon enough, a man dressed in robes walked casually down the sidewalk. Long grey hair, and a beard to match. He had a kind face, framed by a pair of half moon glasses, which aided steely blue eyes. Harry watched him intently out of the corner of his eye. Delphi had hidden herself among the flowers, she hissed quietly to Harry.
Delphinium slithered up to his feet, and slowly made her way up the sofa. She was sluggish, since she hadn't been able to sunbathe whatsoever. The serpent siphoned what heat she could from the television, it was enough to keep her going. Harry would have to talk to Lupin about getting one of those heated lamps he'd seen in a pet store once. The ones all those reptiles basked beneath during all hours of the day. Meanwhile, she draped herself around him, and rested.
By this point a couple other people stopped to watch Harry's little show. Harry walked over to a small white sheet that sat in a pile behind him.
"Because my goals are more important than some stupid muggles! Did you not hear me? You haven't a clue what I've gone through!" Harry shouted at Remus now. He couldn't stand to have his revenge criticized by this man who didn't even know him. Nobody knew him.
Harry strolled back to his crate, trying not to display any sign that he was in pain, which was very much the case. His rump ached severely, and his lower back protested. He held the cloth toward the man he had called over.
"The... killing curse? I thought that it left no marks! How could it have scarred me even if I did survive? Actually, how did I survive? None of this makes sense!"
Dumbledore's subtle, crooked smile confirmed her suspicions. "You either know me too well, or I am too easy to read, Minerva. You're correct. I was going to say, you could maybe escape said consequences by doing one simple thing."
"Yes, I've already expressed my concern to you about his state of wellbeing. It's been eating at me that he's in constant danger, while residing in a place that's supposed to be his home." She wasn't exactly lying, that helped her not to betray her to his impeccable sense for lies.
Harry wasn't sure what was happening, all he knew was that he'd heard someone speak. He only had a vague memory of what had occurred earlier. All he knew was that he'd managed to stop Dudley and Co.'s abuse. He wasn't sure how though. All he knew was that his body still in a lot of pain, and there might be someone, somehow, in his cupboard with him. His vision was still blurry, and it was dark in his cupboard. He was barely able to make out the shape before him, it was long and patterned. A sort of wave ran along it. Then he realized he was face to face with it, it being a snake. His eyes grew wide, and he tried to scramble away from it, the sudden movement reminding him again of his wounds.
Harry opened his eyes at the sound of shattering crockery. His pupils contracted and focused on what used to be a flower pot. Now in it's place was a litter of red dust and shards of brick colored debris. His eyes were wide with absolute astonishment. A smile crept up on his face, giddyness rose within him as if he were a child on christmas morning and there was a sizable pile of gifts beneath the tree. His smile faltered, and fell flat.
“Yes, I’m sure. I honestly think you’re the best man for the job.” Harry said looking at his friend in a determined way. “I’ll miss not working with you, but it’s just not for me anymore. I’m more of a liability and I don’t enjoy it like you do. I did my bit after the war, helped get the department to the way it is today but so did you and now you can lead it.”
Draco hadn’t said anything but his annoyance seemed to dissipate with that sentence and Harry could see his shoulders relax.
When he finished it he smacked his lips and put the empty glass back on the bar top. “That was pretty good actually. I’m impressed. Coconut water, spinach and… some kind of fruit. Banana?” He guessed.
“I’ve fucked it up haven’t I?” Harry said quietly. “Draco’s right, why did I have to be so God damn nosy.”
A little bit of fluff and side characters thrown in to break up the Harry/Draco moments in this chapter (although there is plenty of Harry/Draco too!)
Just like that Ron strolled out into the corridor wand in hand. Harry quickly put on the crimson robes over his jeans and long sleeved T-shirt. He used to dread putting them on each morning but weirdly they felt comforting to him now as he remembered how professional and powerful they made him feel. He pinned the badge to the belt on his jeans and followed Ron grabbing his invisibility cloak from the back of the door on his way out and tucking it into his robes.
“Well if you’re sure you don’t mind Harry then that would be really nice.” Draco said earnestly. “I was a bit worried about when I’d see Blaise again and I know I see Daphne at work but it’s not really the same. I’ve been worried about her and I know they’ve been worried about me.”
Harry simply nodded but didn’t really elaborate. Ron was frowning and thinking. It was quiet for a moment as Ron finished his beer. Harry’s was only half drunk, he wanted to pace himself tonight.
“Yeah, it was really nice of him to let me have you guys over, especially as he’s so private about his home. It feels a bit weird without him but I’ll admit it’s nice to see you both and have the chance to relax the three of us again after the week we’ve had.” Draco said, taking his usual spot on the sofa nearest the door.
Draco nodded his head slowly. “You know I think I could. I don’t know him well but…” He trailed off thinking back to all those years ago.
Harry thought about it. “Well if it does end up being Daphne then I honestly think she’d expect it and not be too bothered. She’s very practical and pragmatic like that plus she likes her own time and she would still want quality time with Blaise -those two are really close you know- and she’d still want time with Draco and with her family too… She’s not the clingy or controlling type at all. Have you met her yet?”
“Anyway.” Harry said getting back on track. “I never wanted to feel vulnerable again and you wouldn’t believe how many times I dropped my wand during field training with the aurors, it was kind of embarrassing really. So I started thinking more about wandless magic again for the first time in ages. I knew I had the potential to do it because I’d kind of already done it but I wanted to do it deliberately. I started with the summoning spell, I thought if I could wandlessly summon my wand then I’d never worry about not having it. It was like practising for the first trial in fourth year again, I just tried over and over again but nothing happened. Every now and then it would move a bit towards me and one time it flew across the room but I couldn’t ever do it properly.”
“I’m not marrying her so-” Draco started to say but his mother silenced him effectively by simply raising her hand.
Draco had access to the general Malfoy family vault and he had used it a few times over the years to buy potions equipment and ingredients but he knew his father kept a very close eye on it and any large withdrawals would be questioned. He only had one vault that was his alone which had his trust fund in. He’d gained access to it once he came of age and he was the only one that had access to it. It had a reasonable amount in it, enough to invest in his business and also to buy a small place of his own but that would pretty much be it and he needed something to live off too. There was a much larger vault that was in his name but he would only have access to it once he got married to someone his parents approved of so he doubted he’d ever see that money.
“He came straight out with it saying he knew that Pierre was really you. I thought he might ask me but he told me so maybe the twins had already confirmed it I’m not sure… Anyway, I didn’t confirm anything at first. I wanted to find out what he wanted but he said he just wanted to talk to you and wanted to ask for my help in how to best approach you.”
He took it and sent his coat and briefcase into the corner of the room with a flick of his wand. Then he went over to give Hermione and Rose both a kiss.
Harry let out a low chuckle and Draco looked confused but waited patiently. It wasn’t really funny, he supposed, just strange that the worst thing the Durselys had done was not tell him about Voldemort.
In a way it had been nice to have Draco’smother around them a bit, it kind of made their relationship feel much more real. He thinks he even has her approval in dating her son too which means an awful lot to him. Narcissa hadn’t said it in so many words, Harry didn’t feel like that was her style, but Draco was right really (as usual). By not saying she disapproved, she was basically saying it was OK… right? That’s what Harry was telling himself anyway.
Still, if there was one thing that Harry did know was that in their fucked up relationship they had always felt drawn to one another. Harry had always been intrigued about Malfoy, he’d always wanted to know more… where he was, what he was up to and what his motivations were. He’d always told himself it was because he was the enemy and it was wise to keep your enemies close but really he’d always known it was more than that. He’d never put a label on that feeling he just knew there was
“We always agreed that we weren’t right for each other, long term and I was supposed to be using the time to find someone who was but I never pushed myself to look for them… like I said I was just coasting along really.” Harry started explaining. “But things started coming together for me when I quit my job and when I decided to write the book. For the first time in a long time I was thinking again about what would actually make me happy and I knew that wasn’t it and I was never going to find it if I stayed with him.”
He’d been told before how his face lit up when he talked about Draco and he thought it probably had now as Hermione was looking at him very strangely. No doubt she was already working it out but it didn’t much matter, he wasn’t hiding it anymore anyway.
The tension was thick in the air and Draco’s chest was hurting in anticipation, a knotted fire just pulsing there. He wanted so badly to feel Harry’s lips on his but somehow he couldn’t bring himself to do it. What if Harry pushed him away? He wasn’t sure if he could ever cope with that rejection.
Currently he was sitting in a holding cell at the Ministry with his mother next to him and his father on the bench opposite. Two aurors that Draco didn't recognise were stationed at the door and he didn’t know where Leo or Auror Williamson were. They were probably glad to be rid of the Malfoys and having a bit of a break. Draco wondered if he’d ever see Leo again. They weren’t friends exactly, he knew that but he’d been glad of the man’s company and he begrudgingly admitted that he might miss it. He wasn’t sure when the next time he might see a friendly face would be after today.
I originally wrote Blu-rays and was going to have Draco make a joke about 'Blue... something or others' but then I realised they weren't a thing until 2006! Now even the concept of a Blu-ray seems old! xD
Ron turned round to his brother who was standing just behind him. “George! That’s not the important question, I don’t want the details of blokes kissing!” He turned back to Harry. “I just want to know who it is.”
“Oh my sweet Harry, you’re so cute when you’re confused.” Draco’s words had gotten away with him a bit there but never mind, can’t be helped now and it was nice to call Harry his. “I talked about hot guys fighting dragons and mentioned a broomstick too, admittedly Cedric was hot too but you were the only one that flew during that task. I told you how much I noticed you in your dress robes at the Yule Ball, I said how I did anything possible just to get your attention in any way during fifth year… I thought you might have pieced it together.”
“No.” Draco corrected quickly. “I’m not annoyed about it. It’s your life Harry, you don’t need my permission for anything. You want this, I could see it in your face yesterday and if it’s what you want to do then you should do it. I’m not going to stop you, I’m not Lucius.”
I intended for him to have lots of little moments of realisations as Harry explains more and more, Draco would have flashbacks and slot in pieces of the puzzle. I feel like this story has got a bit too big for me though and probably has a mountain of inconsistencies as I can't quite remember what I've said before despite reading back over my work a thousand times!
Narcissa’s face was determined even though her eyes were still showing an element of fear as she non-verbally disarmed him and grabbed Lucius wand from midair as it came flying towards her.
Blaise sat down at the far stool immediately and took a sip of his juice. Daphne smiled at him and took the next stool but Draco hesitated slightly.
His father stepped forward into action. Draco saw a jet of flames shoot from his wand and he knew what was happening to the trunks behind him even though he didn’t dare turn to look. He could sense Blaise moving behind him too but his eye was still on his father as the older man had now turned his wand on his son.
Draco wasn’t surprised by this, he knew it was coming and as much as he hated being treated like a child he probably wouldn’t really Hogsmeade this year anyway. ‘Fun’ didn’t really have a place in his life anymore so that wouldn’t be any different. Besides, who would he go with if none of the other Slytherins came back, which he doubted they would.
Dromeda sighed. “Yes, truthfully I do think about them from time to time. It’s strange and a bit sad to think that I do have family out there who I don’t speak to.” She seemed quiet for a moment before she spoke again. “I wrote to Narcissa you know, after the war.”
“No Miss Miller, for your information Mr Zabini and I are just here as friends alongside Miss Greengrass. However if I were on a date with him that would be completely fine and none of your business.” Harry said flatly.
“Yes and you’re already the happiest and most relaxed I’ve ever seen you.” Blaise said directly with a knowing look.
“I just didn’t want to forget my manners, but in that case please call me Harry.” He smiled back at her.
“Harry…” Draco began gently. “Harry, it’s fine, remember, we discussed it and I’m fine I forgive you.”
“Come on Draco, drink this it will help and you should trust it as it’s one of yours!” Harry said with a faint tone of amusement in his voice mixed with worry.
Harry seemed shocked at his surroundings and stood there frozen for a moment. Then he clocked Draco staring at his wand. “It helps me focus my magic in emotional situations… I think.” He mumbled, still frowning at the mess in the lab.
As Draco reached Harry’s left hand he became slightly gentler again as his lips came into contact with the rough scarring there. Then he flipped Harry’s hand over and caught his thumb in his mouth sucking it seductively whilst looking into Harry’s eyes. He trapped the tip of Harry’s thumb in his teeth nipping at it slightly and then when he let go of it Harry trailed his thumb over Draco’s bottom lip as Draco stared into his eyes.
The waitress passed the menus out lingering a little longer than usual over Harry as she leaned in to give him his. Harry however didn’t seem to be looking at her or encouraging her interactions in any way and when she no longer had an excuse to stay she left them to it.
Well, there was nothing for it. He could sit there and think about his father or he could write this sodding letter to Potter. Sighing, he called out for Pinky and asked for a fresh french press of strong coffee knowing he would need it for this task and begrudgingly walked over to his desk. His first attempt was awful and he hastily scribbled it out.
“Maybe.” Draco said smiling and then he looked slightly more serious though. “I will admit that I would be a bit upset if you wanted to go back full time. I like our life here and the routine we’ve established. I think it’s important for us to have some proper time together. It’s for your benefit too though, I like that you eat properly, you sleep well and that you have time for yourself and your family now. All those things have contributed to your emotional state and mental health as well, it’s not just me.”
“They’re apology letters, you know... for the way I was at school, the things I said. I thought, well I don’t know if it will help or not but it just felt like the right thing to do. I know I’m a coward but apologising in person would be harder I think and when I see them on Sunday everyone else will be there. This way… well they can read them and hopefully see that I have changed now and I am sincere. At the very least they’ll have time to process and adjust before I see them.” Draco said, trying to sound confident but his voice was cracking slightly.
So Thursday was spent with Draco at work in Diagon Alley and Harry at home in Grimmauld Place. He was writing in his study as usual going back over all the notes he’d made when his mind hadn’t been in the right place so that the next few chapters actually made sense now. After his chat with Draco over breakfast he was feeling good, it really did help him to talk about his problems and he felt stupid for repressing things for all those years. Maybe he should have spoken out sooner, or maybe this was the just the right time to start dealing with everything now that Draco had come into his life again as a friend. Of course he’d started the process with his surrogate family before talking to Draco but then they became friends at just the right time it seemed.
“Draco…” Harry started to say something but he wasn’t sure what and he started trying to get Draco’s loose shirt off him too but Draco batted his hands away.
Harry smiled slightly at the look that Draco was giving him. He couldn’t deny that everytime Draco looked at him like that it made him feel pretty good. He’d always been mildly uncomfortable when other people looked at him like that before.
His mind once again drifted to the scrolls Harry had given him. They were sitting on his bedside table and he’d had yet to read them. He didn’t know why he hadn’t read them last night. There had been plenty of time after he’d got back from Daphne’s but maybe he was just trying to put it off. Harry had indicated that what he’d written in these chapters hadn’t exactly painted Draco in a good light and he could well believe it. If he’d started in first year, which he assumed he had, then Draco knew he’d be reading about himself as an arrogant bully.
“Well I never thought I’d say this but I’m going to side with your other Weasley friend.” Blaise said cheerfully. “Loser has to pay for the three of us to go out for dinner somewhere next weekend.”
Tuesday and Wednesday were both full on days. Draco had hired the best magical contractors to come and transform his shop space. They were pricey but he’d saved for this and would not settle for anything less than perfection. Blaise had obviously recommended the contractors as he knew everything and everyone. The director of the company assured him they would send the best people and Draco trusted Blaise’s recommendation but it was still hard for him to put the vision of his space into the hands of others.
He realised that Malfoy had made a humorous comment that Harry was supposed to react to but hadn’t as he was now staring at Malfoy…
He stepped past Daphne who had stopped in his single reception room and walked towards his bedroom door. He stopped just before it and turned back to them where Blaise had just whispered something in Daphne’s ear and she had laughed.
“So, I guess we’re at the start of the Horcrux hunt now then? How much have you written about your time on the run?” Draco asked Harry.
“Yeah well you would say that but I never really knew what you saw in Fred! At least looks wise!” He laughed. “Plus you know, the whole ugly ear thing.” He added in a half-joking, half bitter tone.
“They contacted me over a year ago, apparently a friend of theirs was really impressed with my potions. I don’t know who exactly, I have a number of anonymous clients but they said that he really recommended my dreamless sleep, calming, headache and hangover potions so I think I know which client it is. I would worry about them if I cared enough but you know, not really my business and they pay me well for them whoever they are. All I know is that they get the potions delivered directly to their house elf and that the money goes into my vault. Anyway, the twins said they were looking for a potions expert to collaborate with on some of their products but they needed to meet me in person to work on them. They offered me a lot of money to be honest, they must be doing well, and I really needed the money but I said I needed to keep my anonymity so I couldn’t meet with them. At first we were sending letters back and forth for a while and I was helping them with their products that way but it wasn’t ideal, really I needed to see the products for myself so I said I would meet with them in disguise. Anyway, we ended up working together for a few months before one day, one of them accidentally called me Malfoy.”
Draco worried about her, she seemed just as lost as him but neither knew how to comfort the other. He knew she had lost her sister Draco could tell that she was sad about that in a way. Narcissa was mourning the young girl she had once loved, not the cruel crazy woman she had become but whatever she had been, she was still family. Although Draco could not pretend he was sad about her death to be honest.  When the others were around Narcissa would put on her Malfoy mask but there, in that room Draco could see how frail she was. He wondered if his father had even noticed.
Dromeda shook her head slowly but then thought better of it. “There was no letter at all but… but about two months later, when I’d all but forgotten about it, a beautiful eagle owl arrived while I was sitting in the garden and dropped a single Narcissus flower into my lap. The owl flew off again straight away and I didn’t know what to make of it… I wondered if it had been from her. Maybe her way of saying she’d received it but…”
With the weight of Harry’s body gone, Draco suddenly felt cold and empty and he wanted to draw Harry back. There was something about the way Harry distanced himself from Draco that he didn’t like. Ignoring the wet patch in his pajama trousers he sat up quickly and scooted over to Harry.
I just really wasn't in the right head space to write and I was really struggling with this chapter at the beginning. It's come together over the past couple of days finally though so hope it's worth the wait!
Harry thought about it for a moment before he revealed something he’d left out of his confessions earlier. “I- I-...” He trailed off not knowing how to say it.
He started massaging it into the back of Harry’s shoulders and neck rather than simply just rubbing the cream on normally. It felt even better than Raphael’s hands had the other day and Harry never wanted it to stop. He felt himself float away on a little cloud just enjoying the touch.
“Well, they may have done more of the physical work, that was just the way of things.” She looked into his eyes before continuing “but I was still there Draco, I’ve always been there.”
“Yes, mostly. Technically, as she has no wand and I put some extra security measures in place then I can leave her here and just check in on her once in a while,  but I don’t think that’s quite right. It was talked about, back at the office but I said that someone should be here really, at least at night. No one else was that keen honestly so I volunteered. I take this job seriously and I’m more concerned about her safety than her escape. The Death Eaters are still out there, some anyway, and this was their base. They might come back and they might want revenge on your parents for defecting. Your father has offered to help the Ministry with their search too giving information on the escaped Death Eaters so yeah… I’d rather be here in case your mother needs protection more than anything.” Leo explained.
They stayed like that for a minute as Daphne allowed her words to sink in and then she withdrew her hand. Harry took another sip of wine just to have something to do with that hand again.
Harry laughed but he seemed happy. “You’ve clearly never been to a proper coffee shop then. The muggles have loads of them and there are so many different types of coffee, they’re much more into it than we are. I got into coffee when I started working as an auror, I seriously needed the caffeine and at first any coffee would do. Then I started going to this muggle coffee shop round the corner from the Ministry sometimes on my break just to get out of the building and the coffee there was just so much better than what we had in the office. After that I couldn’t go back!”
He was feeling very anxious today and he didn’t cope well when he was anxious. During the war and the aftermath he’d suffered panic attacks and nightmares repeatedly, it had been bad. It was only meditation, exercise and being in the water that helped keep him calm in his daily life. His new life here didn’t include being able to swim or even relax in a bath but the addition of his daily yoga was helping. Yoga was something he’d picked up from one of his french muggle-born lovers and he liked it. He didn’t really understand all the spiritual connections that some muggles apparently had with it but as a basic form of exercise and meditation it was good so he’d researched it more and come up with his own little routine. He usually only did it along with his meditation exercises in the evenings but he had lots of time this morning and he needed to calm himself down.
“I know you said you value the time with them though and… well you also said ideally you wouldn’t be living with someone so soon into a relationship… I don’t want to like, smother you or something, for you to feel like I’m always around.” Harry said awkwardly.
“We are happy.” Draco said, feeling on top of the world as he turned and practically skipped down the stairs towards Harry.
Blaise held onto Draco’s arm as Draco took them just on the edge of the little park in the middle of Grimmauld place, deliberately arriving behind the big tree he knew was there just in case any muggles were watching. The park was deserted just as it had been the other day though. Draco told Blaise to wait there as he went to knock on Harry’s door. He also had the boxes of products to give to Harry.
He really wasn’t sure how much Draco knew about the war, about Voldemort. Draco was still a bit of a mystery to him, obviously he had changed and changed for the better but when, how and why? Harry found himself wanting to spend more time with the man getting to know him, who he was now and what had happened to him since the war. That wasn’t necessarily a new feeling, he had always wanted to know everything about Draco but this time it was more for a positive reason. For the first time in his life he actually very much wanted to be Draco’s friend.
Next chapter is finally going to be Harry and Draco's first date. What do you think they're going to do?!
Harry felt Draco stiffen up slightly besides him and heard the slow inhale and exhale he took before speaking. “Thank you Mother. I don’t think that will be necessary but I appreciate it.”
“And the most expensive sweet white wine you have please, large.” Harry added with a smile but still looking at Draco rather than the waitress.
Deep down he’d only ever wanted someone to take care of him yet somehow his first instinct was always to push away anyone who tried. Not Harry though, Draco thought he’d pushed away when he’d yelled at him but Blaise was right, Harry was stubborn and wouldn’t scare that easily. If he really thought about it it was scary how much he was starting to rely on Harry being there in such a short space of time. He could no longer imagine his life without the man which terrified him as he knew he didn’t want to be without him already and they hadn’t even begun anything resembling a relationship yet, but Draco was determined not to let his insecurities get in the way of what could end up being a very good thing.
“Yeah…” Harry sighed knowing he’d have to explain it. This was the hardest bit. He couldn’t bear to Look at Draco so he focused on a particular spot on the coffee table again and spoke as if he was just recalling facts that meant nothing to him emotionally.
“Yeah well I wasn’t exactly looking at what I threw on this morning.” He shrugged as Malfoy stood back up with the rope in his hands. “Not that I can take any credit for my clothes. Sam buys most of my clothes.”
Draco knew he’d have to make up for pushing him away in sixth year but it seemed like Blaise still genuinely cared about Draco on some level so that was a good start. It would be really nice to have a friend, Draco thought honestly, even if it sounded a bit pathetic. Well, he had been offered an olive branch and he would be a fool not to take it, he thought as he started to write his reply.
“Good idea.” Draco said casually, then he turned more serious as he looked through the notes he had made of Harry’s fifth year chapter. “So fifth year was pretty shit for you right?”
Daphne turned her cheek in expectation and Harry kissed it lightly as friends would before she followed Blaise into the house.
Harry thought for a moment and spoke honestly as always. “Yeah I understand that, it makes a lot more sense now knowing what I know and for what it’s worth I’m sorry.”
The thing is, I haven't been feeling too great recently. I'm not sick or anything, my mental health just hasn't been very good. I've been pretty depressed and lost in regards to my self worth.
The emerald eyed boy sighed to himself. He would be there for a while, may as well enjoy what he could of it. He lazily grabbed the remote as he leaned back, clicking the button to turn on the telly. He watched random programs for a while, some newscasts which amused him (most of them still covering last night's misadventure), some boring and overdramatic soap opera's, some bizarre children's programs. Soon he felt his eyes grow dim, and his eyelids heavy. He couldn't fight off sleep as it claimed him, gently tugging him away from lucidity.
Vernon dragged Harry to the hall near the stairs, the boy prepared to be tossed cruely into his "room." He was unfortunately surprised by the walrus' next actions.
The noise seemed to disturb the walrus of a man's stupor. Suddenly, fury envelopes his face. Blood rushed through his skin, veins popped in his temple, his teeth were bared. He lunged forward and grabbed Harry roughly by the scruff, ignoring the cries of pain as his meaty fist gripped his supple skin.
Once Harry had broken the bones he wanted to, he started on Crocker's teeth. Forcing open his mouth, and with a flick of his wrist, wrenching each individual tooth from it's socket. Blood was gushing from the new holes in the gums, the dark crimson fluid coated the molesters mouth with a copper like flavour.
The windows nearby rattled with such force that they flexed and cracked, startling Petunia, who had been listening intently to the "scuffle" as it escalated. She ran outside to intervene, and found a clear new path that had been torn through her prized garden. Her already brewing anger boiled over into rage at the destruction of her (Actually Harry's) work. She ran around the garden patch, not wanting to contribute to the damage. She found more devastation just around the corner. Scattered around the sideyard were peices of jagged white wood and a few child sized bodies, surrounding a small shallow crater. At the center of said crater was her abomination of a nefew.
Somehow the distance between them seemed enormous, and Dumbledore appeared as a giant. "Your removal from your position as a professor here, at the very least. I'm honestly not entirely sure what more could happen, but I'm sure more has the potential to ensue."
"Yes, miss." Harry suddenly threw his arms around the older woman, surprising her. She smiled and held him closer. Soon she sent him home, and returned to Hogwarts to confront Dumbledore once more.
She was on the verge of tears, she was being forced to break her promise. She was terrified of the consequences this would result in, more for Harry than herself. "Thank you, Albus."
He followed the strange cat for a short ways. They stopped after ducking behind a shed down the street. Harry was a bit confused.
She nearly flinched as Dumbledore started walking toward her, she realised she was still standing on front of the door as he said, "I'll be excusing myself now."
Draco felt a little irritated that Finnegan pushed Harry out of the way, instead of lightly tapping him on the shoulder to get him to move or to nicely ask him to move out the way. But what he was a little confused about was the game Harry mentioned. "What's spin the bottle?"
Draco turned from the cheering crows to grin back at him, "Most fun I've had in a while. You should make better use of your mouth more often, Potter".
"Ronald!" Hermione snapped back at him but in a warning tone and she crossed her arms over her chest. She just couldn't believe Ron right now and how rude he was being. "Don't get pissed at us for being ourselves. We're still the same people as we were yesterday, and the day before."
For the rest of the walk, Mr Diggory and Mr Weasley talked about ministry things whilst Cedric walked towards Harry, Ron, and Hermione to chat about Quidditch and who they think will win. Harry couldn't take his eyes off Cedric and nearly fell over a rock when Cedric laughed about something Ron said. Jesus, the fella's distracting.
"Harry!" Aunt Petunia screeched, followed by her bony knuckles tapping against the door. "Get down here and start making breakfast!"
Neville nodded. He can easily do that. "Only if you ask him out," he said and crossed his arms, trying to look confident when standing up to the Slytherin. "And please, just call me Neville. And trust me, Ron likes you back. Even if he's been a complete git about it. It'll take some time for that small brain of his to wrap itself around reality but that time will come."
Draco had to agree with the Weaselette there. What about Cho? He knows what happened on that week before Christmas. It doesn't take long until information starts to spread in Hogwarts.
Harry smiled slightly. No, a kissing cam did not seem like Malfoy's cup of tea in any sense of the world. "Well, who knows. We might get some entertaining matches. Can you imagine it zooming in on McGonagall and Umbridge if she were still here? It may not be the type of chemistry most thing of, but it's still there".
When Ron told him that he would try out for keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, he felt a rush of near excitement as his best mate would be playing with him. It was actually pretty funny how Ron was hiding from Fred and George like he did something terrible. It even cracked Draco up too when he saw it.
Draco sighed, at least he knew Harry's in this place somewhere. Just where... and is he wearing a costume? He wants to go looking for Harry, but he just doesn't want to interact with anybody right now. He's still shocked with everything he's been through and seen tonight. All that blood... but how did they make all that blood? It all looked so real!
"What the s-s-sodding hell is going on tonight?!" Draco asked loudly as the corridor was filled with too many screams for Blaise and Pansy to hear if he whispered.
Harry made his lips form a straight line, and he smiled. That was definitely something and he quite enjoyed it. "Well, now I can say that I'm definitely gay." He knew it already, but he just wanted to say it.
Ivy smiled down at her friend and her muggle reference which she introduced her to. "Yes, you can do that but without the shoving," she said in a slightly stern voice and pointed a finger at her. "Just politely say something like 'Hey, can I dance with Hermione for the next song?'" She then looked to her left at Draco. "Same with you too, Draco. Just go up to Harry and ask if he wants to dance with you. Simple. I could even go up to Lavender and ask her, but I don't exactly know where she is."
"Are you sure your bottom is only sore from hitting the floor and not from somebody in particular?" Ginny asked, smirking when looking over at the Slytherin table at Blaise Zabini. She can't wait to tell Fred and George this. Unless, of course, she was too late and they already know.
Draco sighed as the Hufflepuff knew exactly why he snuck in here and he nodded. He just hoped to Merlin Harry was okay, both mentally and physically. "Is he okay?" he asked with a serious look on his face. He just needed to know how Harry was.
Draco smiled and shook his head, a little bit of mischief showed in his face which made Blaise and Ivy silently chuckle. "Here, let me get it for you," he said and reached his hand over to wipe his thumb over Harry's top right corner of Harry's mouth. When the jam was now on his thumb, he popped his thumb in his mouth and sucked it clean. He kept trailing his thumb over Harry's top and bottom lip. "You know, you have a really pretty smile." He sounded a little dreamy, but of course, he was always in a loving mood when Harry was around.
Harry blinked again. Then he burst into laughter. David Tennant? Surely Draco could do better at giving himself a fake name than David Tennant, the guy who plays Doctor Who. The legendary first Doctor from the incredible tv series of Doctor Who.
Harry couldn't help but stare at Draco's ass as Draco walked after his parents, watching it move as he walked. When he caught himself staring, he blushed and headed back inside up to Ron's room. Although, when he came to George's door, he couldn't help but peek in. Harry discerned George was crying, he crept inside the bedroom and frowned. "George?" he called silently.
Pansy moved out of the hug and turned to Blaise. She shook him, trying to awaken him. She needed her friends right now.
" 'ow little are you?" Viktor asked him, raising an eyebrow at the younger boy beside him. The sudden question brought Harry out of his dark thoughts.
Oh right. Of course, he doesn't know what a movie is. "It's basically like a moving picture, but longer...," Joslyn said, not exactly knowing how to describe it so he would understand.
Harry said nothing and didn't move a muscle. But as he did, he motioned towards the back door before placing his hand on the knob and looking at her sadly. "I'm going to go for a walk... I want to clear my mind."
The Slytherin gave him a soft expression and he cups his own mouth with a smile. He adored how much Harry was stuttering and mixing up his words. But that compliment, if that's what it is, he will never forget about it. "Let's go, Harry. To the Library."
George and Fred shook their heads at him, knowing Harry would have never done it in the first place. "Harry, we know you'd never do something that silly." They admit that at first, they thought Harry would have done something but it took them a day to realize that Harry wasn't stupid enough to do something like that.
Lavender slowly looked up at the vampire, wincing a little at the slightest pain she felt on her neck like it was cramped but that little inch of pain suddenly went away like it was never there. She stared at the vampire's mouth curiously which white fangs glistened with her own blood were showing. "Wow," she says as she watches, almost hypnotised, as the vampire licked the blood away from her white fangs and in a second, the fangs had disappeared like they weren't even there. She had to blink and make sure she wasn't seeing things.
They were gliding across the floor together, George still whispering mischief that he and Fred had done over the years. "So, I still haven't gotten a kiss from you yet," he said, smirking and fluttering his eyelashes at him. "When will that be?"
Draco looked down at Harry's finger that shushed him, and a slight blush rose up to his cheeks. He nodded and turned away from Harry to open the yellow door up. He stood aside from the door for Harry, just like he did earlier in the day. When was it closed? "After you."
"Nope," Pansy said, smirking as she shook her head. "Payback, Dray!" She opened one of the bottles and tipped it upside down, getting ready to squeeze it in case Draco comes too close to her. "Just one squeeze and I will smell the sweet scent of revenge!"
Draco watched as Cedric left the tent. When the Hufflepuff was completely out of his sight he turned his head back to the raven-haired Gryffindor sitting on the hospital bed. His face softened and he furrowed his eyes worriedly, "So, how are you feeling? I saw what the Dragon did to you, is it bad?"
Draco patted the space next to him, whispering, "Well? What are you waiting for? I don't want you catching a cold. Get in!"
"Yes, my Dragon," said Narcissa. She was already thinking of redesigning the loungeroom area to look a little more modern but antique. "We can surely do that."
Everyone nodded in agreement, even if it was hard to move their necks to the side as they felt stiff from shock. They all mainly were staring at the blood on the floor from Cecelia which still sent shivers down their spines at what the thing did to her.
When the creature looked up at them, Harry grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him behind a tree. He knew it still wouldn't be a safe space, but it gave them some time. "Know any spells?" he whispered, taking out his wand.
"Is Harry Potter at this party?" Draco had to ask. He hoped he could find Harry. He needed his gorgeous green-eyed Gryffindor boyfriend. "And if so, is he wearing a costume or...?"
Draco pouted a little at Harry, and he intertwined their hand from under the table. He didn't want Harry to go but he must. Harry has a dorm to go to and so does he. Plus, he wants to try the moon lamp and study the solar system in the crystal ball until he falls asleep. "Harry, do you have to go?" he tried but to his disappointment, Harry nodded. "Alright. But can I walk you there?"
"Light orangish brownish to grey or olive," Harry said and staring at the cauldron, then into Draco's silver eyes that seemed to sparkle when they looked back into his own eyes. It made his insides flutter at the thought of kissing the silver-eyed Slytherin. Merlin, he doesn't understand love at all.
"Hermione, you have the best ideas," Harry said who displayed a wide grin on his face. He watched Hermione's Niffler jump out of her arms and disappear into the mounds of gold. "You should totally do that! I'm sure Dumbledore would love it."
Professor Moody entered the classroom, everyone could hear the familiar 'Clank' of his staff. All the students watched as the professor taught them about the next unforgivable curse called the Killing Curse. They even gasped in shock as the professor used the curses on a poor spider. Hermione had to raise her voice and tell Moody to stop, but of course, he didn't stop.
Draco shook his head, clearly not pleased with what Harry's saying at all. "How do you not know what an Ebony rod is?" he asked him, and his eyebrows drew closer in together. "We were taught this in the first year. Were you listening at all?"
Draco kissed him, taking his wand from Harry, and placing his other hand on the back of Harry's neck. Then they began to dance one last time. It wasn't a slow dance, just a waltz together.
Ron nodded again, looking at the mess of hair Harry had. He ran a hand through it and smirked, feeling how messy and curly it was. It wasn't tangly or had knots in it which he thought his mate's hair would feel like. In fact, this was his first time feeling his mate's hair. He was thinking of a good hairstyle to do for his best mate. "Okay, but firstly, have you finished getting dressed?"
Ron jogged after him, making sure no one tried to have a go at his best mate though the thought wasn't really on his mind. Nobody has really had a go at Harry from what he knows and he's glad. "So, figured out the task yet?" he asked immediately with a little bit of curiosity.
"I forgot to tell you..." Draco said in between kisses. He didn't mind if he could taste himself on Harry. The only thing that matters is if Harry enjoyed it and by those sparkling green eyes, he can tell he has. "That you're beautiful too." Harry chuckled and sucked on Draco's bottom lip. "You're very...sucky today, aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah," said Ivy with a nod and she fiddles with her black fishtail braid. "Same goes with me. It was going to put me in Gryffindor, but I told the hat not to. I like Slytherin, I don't like the people though as they can be very rude. I chose Slytherin only because I like the colour green, as well as the gothic architecture and furniture throughout the dungeons. I know, I'm weird."
Harry shrugged, not really caring if Pansy Parkinson saw. She seems like a cool girl since she's Draco's friends though he hasn't had any conversations with her. Perhaps he should though so he can get to know her and Ivy as well as Draco.
Joslyn was finding this whole thing a little funny. C'mon, Draco Malfoy, a wizard, in her bedroom? It's just impossible. "Is this some kind of joke?" She asked him, crossing her arms, and hoping this was just some kind of prank where people with cameras will just hop out of her cupboard and say it's all fake. Although, she really hoped this wasn't a joke.
Harry rolled his eyes at the impossible thought of getting haunted. "Fine," He said as he walked over to the wardrobe at the other side of the bedroom and looked for some Pajamas in the drawers. Surprisingly, he found a blue and green set of checkered guy Pyjamas. They were good enough. He would have liked red though. "I'm going for a shower; I'll be back in a minute."
"Sure," Cedric said awkwardly, nodding in agreement as his pink face darkened a little. He rubbed the back of his neck, smiling sheepishly. "Oh, I have this pamphlet for you." He reached into his robe pocket and pulled out a blue and white folded pamphlet. "It will help... um... all I can say is that it is very useful. And here's some lubricant too." He gave a shy smile, held out the rolled-up pamphlet for Harry while trying to hold down a giggle. He reached back into his pocket and grabbed out a small black bottle and handed it to Harry also.
"Whoa, Harry," said Fred a little worriedly, and raises his eyebrows. "What happened here?" He points to his own right jaw but studies the bruise a little further. Harry's anxiety suddenly goes through the roof and he curses himself for not taking care of the bruise from the punch Dudley's friend gave him or even bandaging it up. He looks to Dudley, who gave him a serious look to say he should lie and that's exactly what Harry did.
But first things first, Cody, the tall blonde boy who's the older brother of Christina who both dressed as Purge killers, whipped his phone out, pressed play on an audio recording and set his phone down on the ground. Christina spelled Cody's phone with a loudspeaker charm, making the video sound x100 louder.
Draco crawls around the food to Harry and sits by his side. When Harry finishes the toasted sandwich, Draco grabs a twiggy stick, breaks it in half so there's no more than a few inches and holds it at mouth height. Harry knows exactly where this is going, and so he bites onto his end of the twiggy stick and Draco does the same. They continue biting towards the middle of the twiggy stick, knowing what's next and taking their time until they reached the middle. That's when their lips connect and they both focus on the feel of each other's lips on their own. Draco tilts his head to the side just to deepen the kiss a little, and his hands come up to Harry's arms which are covered in Harry's black hoodie. The feel of Harry flinching from touching his arm worries him a little, but he still continued to kiss him just to calm Harry down a little. His hands move their way down to Harry's hands and he intertwines them together.
Harry gave a smile and sighed. Who he wanted to go with is Draco but he just doesn't have the bravery when he needed it. "Great!" He pointed at Fred and wriggles his finger. Hopefully, that was Fred he pointed to. "See you in the Gryffindor common room at 6:00 on the dot."
Draco rocked him slowly, rubbing his back in comforting patterns until his eyelids felt leaden and he knew he could be asleep in seconds. The Slytherin gripped his arse cheeks and with a slow move downwards and a tug towards him, Draco's softened and slippery wet cock slipped slowly out of Harry's arse and fell splat on his stomach.
Harry rubbed soothing circles around George's back and sighed. "He would want you to stop hurting yourself, George. His death wasn't your fault. He would want you to get better, to continue with the shop, to fall in love, to live life to your fullest as he won't be able to."
Harry noticed that Ron was sitting up in bed with his arms hugging his legs. He wished he could sleep like that, so peacefully. "Your awake," Ron said in a sleepy tone and rubbed at his eyes.
"No, I mean he probably sees things in black and white," said Cedric and he hoped Harry was getting what he was saying. "You don't desert your friends. You defend them. Friends. Enemies. No middle ground. You moved from one side to the other, now he is going to protect you."
Everyone in the Great Hall, during the feast, listened very carefully to what the Headmaster said. That was until he said the next and final sentence. "And might I please prompt you, that it is not tolerable to perform sexual acts on the Hogwarts Express. That includes if you are locked in one of the compartments with the windows down," he said, looking quickly from Harry to Draco and back to Harry with a twinkle in his eye.
Harry chuckled, knowing the Twins would do a lot of mischief in the dance team if there even was one. The thought of a Hogwarts dance team was just unbelievable. He knows there are famous dancers in the muggle world but what about the wizarding world? Would the wizarding world have famous dancers too or just singers? "I wonder if Dumbledore was a dancer."
"Pansy, keep your voice down," Draco then said, a little uneasily as he looks down from where he stared at and at them. He swore he heard a gasp come from above them. "I don't want people finding out." He then furrowed his eyebrows, knowing Harry has an invisibility cloak. A quick glance over at the Gryffindor table he noticed Harry wasn't there, but Weasley and Granger were. Finnegan and Thomas weren't there though. He just hoped what he thought wasn't true. He leaned a little closer to them from over the table and said, "You know what my father will do if he finds out, don't you?"
Harry stopped thrusting and looked into those brilliant silver eyes; he couldn't believe what he was hearing again. "I love you too, Draco Lucius Malfoy and I'm sorry I haven't told you those three words earlier during the year." He leaned down to Draco's mouth and kissed him, his prick still inside Draco.
"As it is, Mrs Malfoy," said Harry, smiling at her. He suddenly felt a little nervous. This was Draco's mother he was talking to. The one who will accept him for liking her son if he impresses her well enough to give him her blessings to date Draco. "I'm actually here to see Teddy, but I'd love to have a chat with you as well."
"Professor Hagrid," Draco said softly and he rubbed his lower arm up and down nervously. He hated this. He wished he could go back in time and just not follow Nott out to the Courtyard where Rita Skeeter was.
"Tell me more!" Hermione said excitingly, and her eyes gleamed as her grin grew wider. She was just so curious to know what else happened between Harry and Malfoy as it was noticeable that they have been getting along quite well together. "What happened? Did he watch you? Did you guys talk?"
"Wait..." Harry said and hesitates for a minute. He blinks repeatedly at her and asked himself if she was speaking with honesty. But it just couldn't be true. "Do you mean...?"
"Mr Potter, you seem eager to spend more time with Mr Malfoy," said Professor Sprout in a loud voice and it echoed through the Greenhouse. "Mr Zabini, you will be Mr Weasley's partner. Mr Potter, stay where you are." Draco's hand slipped as he was holding the Wiggentree sapling. Harry cursed and looked over at Ron who was shaking his head in disbelief.
While filming Prisoner of Azkaban, the pockets of Tom Felton's Hogwarts robes were sewn shut to stop him sneaking food on set.
Ron rolled his eyes at his bushy-haired friend and her ranting about wanting to learn more in one lesson. "Oh, brighten up Hermione," he said and gave her shoulder a little pat. "I'm sure we'll be taught many more throughout the year."
He grabs Harry's sweater in one fist and yanks Harry down further towards him. Harry hesitates a little, knowing what the Slytherin wants and so he gives it to him. But first, his right hand came up and caressed the blonde Slytherin's pale cheek with a tinge of pink just to feel the softness of him, and to study his face close up.
"Um... It's fine," Harry told her, pushing the blade onto his thumb. "There is nothing to be worried about." He looked ahead of him at the door, wondering if he should get up and escape. "Anyway... I should get going down to breakfast." He stood up and placed his blade back in the tin. He spelled it shut, put it back in the cupboard, cleaned off his arm and headed down to the common room to go to the Great Hall.
"I want," Harry whispered, rubbing his hand up and down against Draco's prick. This is what he wanted to taste again. He wanted to taste the blonde Slytherin wizard's spunk and swallow it all again. He is craving it.
Draco was thinking of making a pouty face at Harry just to make him stay, but he just sighed. He didn't want to be here all alone and in a dead woman's bed. He would rather Harry be here with him all night but if Harry wants to go... "Can you stay here with me, please?"
Harry threw the man against the cobblestones of the wall, a thump echoed through the dark and dirty alleyway. The raven loosened his magical grip on the rapists throat just enough for him to breathe, but only barely. The man's limbs were thrust against the wall, he couldn't move them from their place no matter how much he struggled. He made futile efforts to scream and yell as Harry approached him, slowly.
"Before I take this sheet, do not be scared, under it lies my assistant!" He pulled it of in a wide motion, revealing Delphi beneath it in a coil. A woman gasped, the man next to her put his hand over his mouth.
Harry's eyes would have popped out of their sockets like corks from over pressurized champagne bottles if they were any wider. Why could he possibly be famous? What could he have done to warrant his name being common place among witches and wizards like some sort of pop culture icon? Such a large revelation, yet it only brought forth more questions in his head. Nothing was making sense.
When he awoke, the room was brighter, but not by much. Soft sunlight filtered through the closed curtains of the sparsely furnished room. All that resided in the room was a twin sized bed, and a nightstand sitting beside it. Atop the nightstand stood a lamp, next to it a glass of water and an analogue clock which read nine a.m. He also noticed the weight of a shrunken Delphinium coiled onto the bed beside him. He whispered the engorgio charm and returned her to size. She continued to sleep beside him.
There was a sound like metal hitting brick to his right. He turned to see two wires laying across the floor, leading to the shaking held Razer gun in an officers hand. The man wrapped his digits around the handle of his pistol and prepared to pull it out.
Harry's glittering green eyes glared at the bulging, roll covered back walking toward the front door. The fabric of the large man's sweater vest stretching and pulling across his flabby skin. Sweat darkened the crevices between the folds.
"What's wrong, Professor?" His brow knit together, he hasn't seen her like this yet. She didn't speak for a moment, electing to simply stare at him as if he were barely there. A fight unfolded behind her eyes. Suddenly her expression hardened, she looked stern, but hints of pain flickered in her face.
Her mind raced to find a suitable explanation, and it begged the question as to why she hadnt done so preemptively. She couldn't let Albus win this battle of wills, she needed to beat him. Him and all that cunning that stormed behind those steely blue eyes. A thought occurred to her, she was never explicitly forbidden from seeing potter.
Once again, he was in the front yard, tending the flowers. Gradually tending each plant as necessary. His tools all felt leaden in his hands, and each task lacked his usual attention and grace. He bore the pain as well as he could, resulting in a barely acceptable gardening performance.
Delphinium lay silent, thinking about his definition of love. It took her a few minutes to develop a response.
He recognized it wasn't only a pile of trash that he had tripped over, as the mound of newspapers and torn bags stirred beneath his legs. A very angry homeless man rose up from beneath the refuse grumbling.
"I have had everything taken from me! Everything. I never had a home. I never had a family. Nobody loved me. I didn't even know who I was until I was six, and even that was taken from me!" Tears streamed down his face.
His bonds snapped apart, startling Vernon, who flinched at the sound. He stared wide eyed as Harry slowly pushed himself into a kneeling position, glaring at him with molten fury.
Remus looked shocked, and his face grew sad. "I- I didn't know. I sympathise with you, but what has that got to do with any of this?"
His green eyes scanned the sky, it appeared to be midmorning, a couple hours after sunrise. Most shops would be open by now.
His tone verged on begging, so she complied. They laid there, quiet for several moments. Harry was the first to break the silence.
Massive pudgy hands fumbled with the wholly unnecessary belt around his waist, the buckle seemed to slowly come undone to Harry. Vernon roughly yanked the belt from it's loops. He gathered it in his bear-like paws and folded it in half once.
She was simultaneously surprised and annoyed to find Dumbledore in her classroom once again. He was facing a window, quite dramatically. His wrinkled and weathered hands clasped behind his back.
Harry was almost entirely unsure of what to do with that explanation, it was too mystical. It felt, psuedoscientific (not that he knew about psuedoscience, he was only six after all). But, alas, Harry only had that to utilize. So he did so, as best he could. He looked nearby for some sort of target, next to the back corner of the house was a short stack of empty small flower pots. The tiny child took one and set it apart from the others, giving himself ample space for him to narrow his focus.
Harry's thin pale face lowered, his hand lowering to his side. Emerald eyes peered from under his brow up at the mountainously obese man. "Apologies, sir. I got- distracted..."
Harry was in denial, and in his denial he'd given away the true damage that had been done to him by the monsters that caged him. The cool blooded creatures heart ached at the revelation. She'd seen children bully each other, and fight. It seemed a generally normal occurence, a part of human life. But never once had she ever seen offspring so mistreated by caretakers. From what she'd gathered most parents were compassionate and kind, only appearing to change their demeanor when a child had done something wrong or displeasurable.
"Well, yer not gonna get 'em! Not 'til we grind your sorry ass to paste." Harry saw Dudley toss his glasses haphazardly behind him. The specs made a light noise as they fell into the packed grass a few feet away. The pressure on his leg increased. A grimmace sprang onto the visually impaired child's face, tears built up in his eyes and dripped down his ears and into the grass. Harry let out an agonized scream as he felt his leg snap audibly at the joint.
Apparently last night he had managed to travel a little over 38 kilometers. He attributed this distance to delirium and unconscious use of magic to fuel his muscles, along with potentially numbing his pain. He continued to explore the city.
Harry wasn't quite sure how to respond. He remained silent for a moment. "I did what I felt had to be done."
"Before I went to sleep, you mentioned food?" Coincidentally his stomach growled loudly at that moment. Harry blushed.
The two groups had no choice but to engage, creating a diversion for Harry. He came close to the gate of which he had mangled the lock. He just barely saw the small group who had been stationed there to ambush him. Again on instict he used his magic, completely destroying the gate. Shards of metal and twisted bars showered the men, incapacitating all of them.
The guitarist felt his heart break. He had been lied to. Harry wasn't safe in the Dursley place. Remus set the plate on a small table beside the sofa. He had wondered where all of those scars had come from, he attempted to extend a hand toward the boy.
"Oh, but I am. Furthermore, you will not continue to insist upon his removal from the Dursley household."
Soon the weight was gone from his body, and Harry felt himself being flipped onto his stomach and propped up onto his knees. Harry tried to struggle, only to be struck heavily on the back of his head. Tears streamed from his eyes, he couldn't even to begin gathering his thoughts due to the terror that scrambled his brain.
Vernon felt himself being pushed backward through the plastic sheets, his skin sliding along the concrete floor of the remaining room. His head and back collided roughly with the far wall, he watched Harry limp through the sheeting. The light behind him cast Harry into a menacing silhouette.
Harry giggled. "A magician never reveals his secrets." While he acted relaxed toward the man, he remained guarded. His instincts told him to be wary, and not reveal anything about himself.
She attempted to comfort him as he cried into her scales. She wanted to ask what happened, but she could tell his pain was too great to talk about at the moment.
It was a plague doctor costume, a very high quality one too. The costume was made of thick cotton cloth, which made it heavy, though managable. The mask was beautiful, made with real leather and glass. It was well ventilated, which prevented it from getting stuffy. Though it was made for an adult, the reducto charm eliminated that issue. Now it was the perfect size for him.
Remus turned to look at Harry, incredulous. "What the hell do you mean 'had to be done?' You murdered... well I don't even know how many people last night!"
She spotted her son nearby (not a hard feat honestly, he would be recognizable from a kilometer away) and her anger all but dissapated. Her motherly instincts brimmed and she ran to fuss over his (oh so very minor in comparison to Harry's) injuries. Once she realized that the walking blob of adipose tissue that was her son was just shy of unharmed, she ran to her sisters child. Petunia's rage reappeared in a flash boil, as she roughly grabbed the critically injured boy and ignoring his groans of agony dragged him into the house and threw him into his cupboard.
Tears continued to coat Harry's cheeks. "Those men deserved to die! I know what it's like to have that done to me!"
Harry choked as a wad of soil and sod was stuffed into his mouth and crumbled down the back of his throat, the fibres of grass tickled his uvula. He gagged as he tried to rid his mouth of the debris. The boys surrounding him laughed. As he managed to spit out most of what was in his mouth he recieved a blow to his facs, courtesy of Dudley's dirt covered leather dress shoe. Harry felt his jaw nearly dislocate. He lay in the grass another few seconds, his blind daze deepening. More blows began to rain down on him from all angles. One thought ran through Harry's head. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
"I'll allow it," he finally said, his expression grim. She had a feeling that he secretly knew about, and enjoyed the pain this would cause her. "I want it done tomorrow, your usual time, if you would."
"Oh, yes. Well over the years I read some books, and learned from teachers where I could. Practiced a lot. Pretty similar to most who play, I would say."
His heart sped up, and tears threatened to form in his eyes as shame and fury boiled in his chest. It was a volatile reaction, akin to dumping potassium metal into a vat of water. The documents contained a wealth of information, such as the prison Charles was released from several months ago. This, along with it's address.
This isn't a ploy to get attention, I don't mind if I don't get much in the way of feedback while I'm on hiatus. It would just be appreciated, and might help me get back on track creatively.
It had been a few days since Harry had seen Minerva, he was beginning to get anxious. His eyes scanned the sidewalk for any hint of a glasses clad tabby cat. Something collided painfully with the side of his skull. He clutched his now aching head gingerly, that would bruise soon.
"How do you know my name?" Harry knew the voice, though he couldn't see who it belonged to. The room was dimly lit, what little light sparsely illuminated the space made Harry's eyes ache slightly. He heard Lupin let out a chuckle.
Silently, Harry left the house, not even bothering to shut the front door. Without a noise, Delphinium joined his side.
The costumed boy ran even harder, hoping to outrun whoever may still be pursuing him. He managed to reach the front doors, running out into the expanse between the complex and the perimeter fence. He got around 10 meters from the building before he felt a terrible pain in his leg almost instantly following by a deafening bang. He tumbled to the ground, and looked at the prison.
He opened his eyes again to find his mask being removed, still in the street from the lights. He was in the arms of a vaguely familiar blur. He didn't remember the rest of what happened.
Satisfaction and glee shined within his startlingly blue eyes. She knew that he was only doing this to torture her, to get an admission of guilt. He was enjoying watching her struggle with her thoughts, her words. A small,  sinister smirk played at the corners of the old man's mouth
An item that caught his eye was called "chicken and waffles." He'd never considered that the two could be paired, much less taste good together. It was also the cheapest option at 13£. So he ordered his meal and waited. A server shortly came and set down a glass of water, several ice cubes floated in it, with a lemon wedge slotted onto the rim.
Harry set his gaze on the pot, and felt inside himself mentally. Looking for any sign of his magic as it had been described to him. He pressed his eyes shut, and searched deeper. He opened his eyes again, only to see the pot undisturbed. It hadn't so much as moved a milimetre from the spot he'd placed it.
"Yes, sure, boy." The man chuckled a little as he pulled out a cheap ballpoint. Harry took it and placed it on the crate. Harry held out his arms, showing off his palms, and rolling up his sleeves.
Bernard was sitting in an office chair at the desk, intently watching the computer as it scanned for items pertaining to his search terms. It was almost excruciatingly slow. Harry looked around, a few feet away, sat a large machine. The raven assumed that it was the printer, though it had a variety of slots, trays, and buttons he supposed served other utilities.
"Harry, dear, it's me, McGonagal. Please calm down, what happened?" She spoke as calmly as possible, lowering herself closer to the ground. Doing her best to make herself as non-threatening as possible. Harry barely managed to get the words together.
Remus returned to the flat, feeling he needed to check on Harry before heading off to work. He was startled to find the bedroom door open, Harry and his serpent gone, along with the chair that used to stand by the dinner table. Then he heard Harry's muffled voice echo from the lavatory.
She paused a moment, she didn't remember ever having a proper title. Her mother had never given her one, and she'd never been asked on account of her life essentially being a constant competition for survival.
Harry thought, honestly, you probably would have to be if you started hearing snakes talk as if most humans couldn't even comprehend words. And then to go on about how snake talkers made friends with snakes because they did magic.
"What of the boy's abilities as a Parselmouth? Surely that warrents some attention. It would be a waste of potential to have his growth stunted by such hostile surroundings."
Those words made her nervous. She hoped that Delphine's animalistic intuition was enough to warn the two not to give any vital information. Cautiously, she attempted to dissuade him, while also doing her best to not seem nervous about his newfound "concern" for the raven's wellbeing.
The steady rise and fall of the werewolf's chest told Harry the Lupin had fallen asleep. He snored quietly as His head rolled back, resting against the back of the couch.
His question was answered when what had been a cat suddenly became a tall, stern faced woman with glasses. Harry stepped back in suprise, eyes bulging from their sockets at the display of magic. He definitely wanted to learn how to become an animal at will, he felt it extremely advantagous.
Harry froze, he'd nearly forgotten about the strange way that the assault had suddenly stopped. He never thought about why they stopped, not that he had been given the chance. He was barely conscious until a moment ago, so all in all, not a lot of time given to reflect on that situation.
"I saw your little performance the other day. Very impressive tricks, mind my asking how you did any of it?" He questioned, playfully, knowing what answer he would receive.
"What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!" He looked at Harry, terror in his eyes. "How- Who the fuck are you?"
She offered, she still didn't quite understand the concept of currency and theft. Nor that the latter was considered unacceptable and could land them both in extreme trouble.
Within the first few weeks Harry had an elementary grasp on almost everything a first year would have learned up to that point, the animagus was astonished how well he grasped each subject considering his age. He excelled in the theoretical aspects of magic the greatest, often coming up with complex analogies that nonetheless made near perfect sense in relation to the actual magical action or occurrence. Sadly, their lessons would cease soon enough.
"How do you know my name?" He asked, a wave of scenarios and explanations raced through his head most of which involving magic in some way. Though what he really wanted to know was why she knew his name. He'd only recently discovered his magic and doubted that outside of being able to speak with snakes he wasn't terribly remarkable. Really, what strange perverted reason would this woman be stalking him for?
He looked over to see a remarkably large snake sluggishly slithering toward him, in the dark he could almost swear he saw a groggy expression on her face. He knew this was a ridiculous notion, considering she was a snake, with no ability to emote. But he couldn't shake the impression.
He knew that he couldn't just wander into the place. He needed to find another avenue. He clung to the shadows, and considered what to do.
He needed someone. He wanted love. He crave acceptance. Maybe he could find it. Not in a person, but something else.
When Harry woke up he didn't know what time it was, or what day it was. His eyes were nearly crusted shut with sleep. He felt bloated and sore. He looked over his arms, which lay limp in front of him; his skin was a myriad of ugly bruised colours. The surface was coated in thin long scabs, like someone had scraped him with a stick, repeatedly. His skin looked like a quilt, swollen and lumpy.
It wasn't long, but to Harry it felt similar to an eternity. The whole time he couldn't gather his thoughts enough to reach his magic. All he could think was the raining lashes upon his body. Finally, it was over.
Harry began to run out of ways he could think of with what magic he knew, while also having the man remain identifiable. So the green eyed child decided to terminate the older persons suffering. With a wave of Harry's hand, a large slash appeared across Charles' throat. He soon died of his external bleeding, paired with whatever internal bleeding he was already suffering from. Harry left him behind, a mission formulating in his mind.
Delphi slithered down from his torso, traveling down his leg and disappearing into a nearby brush. The woman stared at the empty space left by the serpent. She hadn't seen anything like it for a long time. His stomach was horribly distended, the snake had been able to fill the space so well that he looked normal until she'd left. His ribs were so apparent she could have counted them without needing to feel for them. Hell, he looked like a human xylophone. Now she took a closer look at his arms, they were extremely thin. His legs were no better, she almost couldn't fathom how he functioned. She was sure that he was unconsciously using magic just to stay upright. Then there was the bruising, a large amount of his skin was blotched with purple and red. Like his ribs had been broken. Is that why I stopped seeing him for a few days? She needed to talk to Dumbledore immediately, she could not believe he would leave this child in this environment. Bloodline wards be damned.
One of the guards he had taken out when he entered was conscious, and holding his gun, it's barrel pointed toward Harry. Anger boiled up into the raven's chest, and he flung his hand at the officer. The uniformed man was flung into the adjacent wall with such force that he left a red smear on it as he flopped lifelessly to the ground.
The two prisoners shared a moment of confusion for a second before Harry's target began to bleed crimson from the entire circumference of his neck. Both prisoners eyes widened, and the molester burgled in surprise as blood filled his severed throat. He took a step back, which revealed the extent of Harry's attack. The backward motion cause his head to slip forward from it's perch. The head fell with a solid thump, the gorey clean cut stump spurted dark and viscous arterial spray as the heart continued to pump. His cell mate exclaimed in surprise, pressing himself firmly into the corner where the wall and bars intersected.
Harry arched his back as he felt something slowly and agonisingly push its way into his rear. His entire body tightened and relaxed repeatedly with the pain of the intrusion. Nausea welled up in Harry's stomach, nearly causing him to vomit. He screamed ineffectually, the audio being muffled by the tape over his mouth.
The bearded wizard contemplated her point. "I'll think about that. Private intruction may prove difficult, should I allow it."
"Hmm." Acknowledged Harry, thoughtfully. He imagined the man spending time in libraries, studiously practicing notes and chords. Playing through practice scales and such. He absently combed his fringe over his scar, which almost seemed to catch the gentleman's eye.
"How could their lives mean so little to you?" Remus still didn't understand what drove Harry to these measures.
Harry looked away, with an expression on his face that made McGonagal's concern to grow. He seemed afraid, as of he were looking for some threat in the distance.
"Of course. I know what I am doing, he needs to remain at the Dursley household. The wards set by his mother are the only thing standing between him and Voldemort. If he were to be removed, we couldn't hope to replicate the level of security he has in that place."
He didn't know where he was when he stopped. His bleary and exhausted eyes could only see that they were in the outer edges of a city. Light was beginning to creep its way over the horizon. He stumbled blindly into a nearby alleyway, collapsing into a pile of trash bags. He didn't remember losing consciousness.
But what would he do? He didn't have an instrument, much less the skill to play one. He wondered what talents he could put on display, something he could entertain with. He relayed his thoughts to Delphi, who was attempting to sunbathe in the back of the alley, where some warm gilded sunlight managed to peek through the light grey cloud cover.
"What? No?" She almost yelled, incredulous. "How could you possibly not remove him from that place? He is suffering abuse, you should have seen the bruises. Children his age shouldn't react that way, days after any form of 'discipline.'"
"Look, Harry, please settle down! I won't touch you! I want to understand!" Remus pleaded in a panic, fearing what Harry would do if placed under further stress.
Her heart stopped, so had the motion of her tail. How had he found her out? He couldn't have really, she hoped. She decided to continue playing the role of unambiguous stray. Her head cocked to the side to, her face neutral. She made a quiet noise like she was annoyed, as a normal cat would be if a person decided to interrupt their peaceful sunbathing session. Harry furrowed his brow, his jaw set.
It really was no wonder the child was wailing, he was far from comfortable (or safe for that matter). The milk was beginning to secrete a sickly rotten smell, he had akward glass shapes pressed into his backside, the hopelessly ineffective cloth that swaddled him did next to nothing to trap his body heat. This was the beginning of a long and unpleasant stay in a house of monsters, whose hearts pumped scum and prejudice in place of blood. These monsters would be the first to participate in the project of turning an angel into a formidable abomination.
She stared angrily for a moment in silence, before turning on her heel and leaving his office. She returned to her office, slamming the door behind herself. She leaned against the door, and slid down until she sat on her classroom floor. She closed her eyes, as tears slowly fell from them. She felt as if her promise to Harry had already been broken.
