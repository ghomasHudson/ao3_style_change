meant to be making it up to you.” And then he dropped to his knees between Draco’s splayed legs and blinked up at him, his green eyes framed so prettily by his long lashes that Draco forgot how to breathe for a second.
“I enjoy it,” he said defensively.
“I’m sure you can do it with a little glass of wine,” Pansy said. She handed him a glass that even a giant wouldn’t describe as ‘little’. A bit of wine sloshed onto the floor.

Fucking
“They’ll handle it. I don’t want to leave you to fend for yourself after forcing you to come.” Her smile was watery.
He went back to the hem, checking it was even. The issue with work was Draco had got to a point where so much of it was muscle memory that his mind was free to wander and it was only interested in wandering in one very specific direction.
, that’s what was so maddening about it. He was wrong and he wouldn’t
“They’re saying he’s claimed five of the killings but it may be as many as twenty.”
He curled his hands into fists and pressed his nails into his palm, and listened to Rolf’s story.
“Yeah.” The word was filled with an exhausted kind of defeat.
(But, as a treacherous voice pointed out, they looked best on Potter.)
“Get this thing off,” he mumbled into Harry’s mouth.
. Out of the two of them, it was definitely Malfoy who would be entitled enough to come back and complain. He wanted to point that out, but he could feel the woman watching him with wide eyes and he didn’t want to appear rude in front of a stranger. Even if Malfoy deserved it.
“I didn’t do it for you,” he said. “And you still need to leave. You can’t attend a funeral you weren’t invited to. Especially not barefoot in your pyjamas.”
“I’ll pass on the message,” Draco said with a cultivated smile, holding the door open for Madam Malkin, who could only walk with the aid of her carer, clinging onto her arm.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, I can understand.”
“Your attitude. I imagine if people
He stood for a long moment, waiting for the urge to kill someone to dissipate enough that he could take a step back from the door without putting his fist through it.

“Uhh…” Harry racked his brains, trying to remember if he should know there were plans after work. He ran through all the usual occasions for a post-work pub trip (birthday, leaving party, new recruit, end of a case) but came up blank so he asked, “What’s tonight?”
“Please stop,” Draco begged.
He admired his reflection in the darkened window of the shop across the cobblestone street as he waited in the queue to get into the bar. He wore tight black trousers with dragonhide boots and a white shirt under a waistcoat the same shade as his trousers. Over the top of that, he wore a half-cape, half-Muggle coat that fell to just above his knee with wide three-quarter length sleeves. He’d chosen his favourite cufflinks, little gold snitches, seeing as they were on show tonight. Pushing the cape to the side, he slipped his fingers into his trouser pocket, revealing the length of his leg, and decided he was completely
Harry snorted at the perfunctory note and lack of question mark after what was clearly a question and glanced at the calendar hanging on his wall. It took a moment for him to remember what day it was, and then another long minute of staring at the blank boxes, trying to remember if he’d made any plans and what his work schedule was.
He sighed and headed to the Apparition point.
She was surprisingly heavy. Draco had expected it to feel as if he was holding something delicate, like a baby bird, but the child was quite
“I don’t need
“What do you mean?” he asked. He watched Draco with a speculative tilt to his head as Draco paced the room, looking at the dust-covered end tables and chintz settees.
Malfoy was clearly waiting for Harry when he arrived for his fitting, even though Harry was pretty sure he was early. He scowled at Harry as he pulled the door open and Harry reflexively glared back. Harry thought back to the last time he’d seen him in the bathroom of that Muggle bar, wearing the bizarre half-Muggle, half-wizard poncho-cape thing that he somehow pulled off. If Harry ever wore anything like that, he was sure he’d look utterly ridiculous, but it worked on Malfoy. Even though his style didn’t exactly blend in with the current Muggle trends (the shirts and waistcoats were more suited to the nineteenth century) his confidence allowed him to pull it off. He looked eccentrically fashionable by choice rather than ignorantly bizarre, like most pure-bloods who tried to blend in with the Muggles.
Her back was to her grandmother and she clenched her fists tightly in the piles of fabric before taking a deep breath and turning around. Draco tried to blend into the background, not wanting to be part of the inevitable fight, edging around the walls to the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee.
“Yeah, I didn’t really know her. I was there for my friend.” There were books on the coffee table in the centre of the room and Draco read a few of the words on the spines —
“Just?” Millie prompted.
“Twenty galleons,” Draco made up on the spot. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Maggie’s jaw drop and he surreptitiously kicked her.
“Yeah, but that wasn’t going to happen for years still,” Harry whispered.
At work the next day, Draco asked Maggie if he could borrow some of her glossy Muggle magazines.
Which, obviously, they weren’t. Potter didn’t have feelings for Draco. He had just been under the influence of a curse that left him disoriented and led to poor decision-making. Sort of like being drunk, Draco imagined.
“Siberia,” she said with a smile. “I have a friend who needs help looking for a yeti.”
They pounded at the door again and Draco hurriedly pushed himself out of bed, ruining the post-orgasm bliss, and grabbed his dressing gown from the back of the door and his wand from the bedside table. He pulled the robe on and tied it around his waist — for the first time, regretting the black satin choice. It was better suited for haunting the manor halls on Saturday mornings with a coffee morning than confronting midnight visitors, but it was all he had at hand.
She shrugged, looking back at the grave. “I’m glad it’s over, I think. Will you come to the wake?”
talking about his problems, but sometimes it felt like it was all anyone wanted to do. He didn’t tell anyone
name’s here too, Potter,” he said, then sighed and turned his palms outwards — a conciliatory gesture. “It was perhaps a rash decision. I can see now that our evidence was weak and we should have examined the validity of our sources. I’ll schedule a training day to refresh everyone’s memories and I’ll talk to the Minister about adding additional clarity to the Auror policy on raids. You can contribute your opinions on how to improve in the meeting. What do you think?”
. Having thought of nothing except Giles Thorne for the last six months, Harry’s team jumped on the new case with gusto. The board in the briefing room quickly filled with photos of potential suspects and a map of all of the mirrors discovered so far, the red threads beginning to spread like tendrils from a vine.
“Fine. Maggie’ll sort out the token for you then,” he said and walked back into the sewing room without a second glance.
“Master Malfoy,” he croaked, stepping back to allow them in.
“What was that for?” he asked breathlessly when Draco pulled away.
“I was just thinking that when England offered me a chance on the team — I didn’t have to think about it because I knew it’s what I wanted.”
Harry’s breath stuttered. “We are?” he asked.
“I suppose that partly explains it,” Draco said with a grimace once they were alone.
The man noticed Theo’s attention wavering and spun to face Draco, wand out and pointing right at his chest. His face was vaguely familiar — thin and framed by a bad haircut — and Draco realised it was the man from the bar who’d called him a twat.
“Would you like to try on your robes quickly, Mr. Potter? Just to make sure there’s no final alterations we need to make?” she asked.
He zoned out, not noticing the passing of time until Pansy sighed and sat back on her heels, dropping her wand onto the picnic blanket. The sun’s warmth gradually returned, the warm breeze wrapping around him like a blanket.
, actually, Harry. More like violently explode.”
sounds more like a Taboo.”
“No, Harry ordered them from
“She’s gone,” Draco called, dropping back to all four.
Pansy slapped her hand down on the hem he was working on. He considered stabbing it with a pin.
He kissed her forehead as they parted. “I’m just doing it for my end-of-year bonus,” he said.
He had never hated his fair skin more than in that moment because he knew his blush stood out clearer than sunburn.
. He wondered whether Harry could see his heart racing because it felt like it was about to beat straight out of his ribcage.
“Dra— Malfoy, listen to me. I really didn’t
Potter?
“How can I—” He cut off his question when he realised who it was chatting with Maggie. “Potter,” he said, shortly.
Except ‘crush’ made it so childish: a simple passing fancy that one could get over with a bit of distance and some ice cream. A crush wasn’t meant to inspire thoughts like,
“I don’t see any Aurors in here, just a couple of Death Eaters. And I don’t think your word will mean much.”
Draco nodded and smirked. “See you around, Potter,” he said.
There were several concealment charms on the door between the Muggle front and the sewing room. They were so strong that Draco would sneeze if he lingered by the doorway for too long, but Maggie was terrified of accidentally breaking any of the secrecy laws and having her business shut down, so she’d spent far too much of her start-up money hiring the kinds of security professionals that were more used to warding the Quidditch World Cups than a small, independent business.
“…Pardon?” Draco asked, certain that he’d heard her wrong.
“I need to get her down before dinner or I won’t be able to have a bite without her crying,” she explained as she took her daughter from Ginny. “Don’t wait for me.”
It was for the War Recovery Ball and his stomach twisted unpleasantly. He’d always wanted to go — it was the kind of party he and his friends would have been at every summer if their lives hadn’t turned out the way they had. It was exclusive and luxurious, filled with only the top brass of wizards and witches, which no longer included former Death Eaters and their friends.
“I just stopped by to pick up that dress I’m working on for Pansy,” he said defensively.
his arse) the whole way.
The first time their dicks brushed, Draco thought he would come right there. He was already sensitive from earlier, and the feeling of being pinned against the wall as Harry worked him over was exquisite torture. Harry seemed to be of the same opinion. He dropped his head to Draco’s shoulder, the sweat beading between their hot skin and dripping down into the hollow of Draco’s collarbone. Harry lined their hips up and thrust up, making them both groan loudly.
Potter shook his head. “Hermione first. I’d rather have an idea of what this thing is before I go about airing my business to strangers.”
“Sorry, mate,” she said, patting his shoulder. “We miss you.”
from that,” Harry said defensively. “The bar? The
Potter didn’t (couldn’t) argue with him. They both knew he was right, after all.
He stalked to the nearest Floo Station in a terrible mood. The wizard behind the bar didn’t look up as Draco burst in and headed straight for the fireplace.
If only Potter could have stayed out of Draco’s life, everything would be fine. But always he had to insert himself where he wasn’t welcome and Draco was once again at a disadvantage because of it.

They didn’t answer, of course, but then that wasn’t unusual even when they’d been alive.
The first time he’d bit into one of the extra-spicy chicken wings, he’d begged Pansy to take him to St. Mungo’s, convinced that someone had set his mouth on fire. She’d laughed at him until he forced her to try one herself and she’d run into the park opposite and hidden behind a bush so she could cast A
. Three harried-looking Emergency Healers had set up a makeshift triage, and a long line of wizards waited to be checked over. The red-robed Aurors buzzed around like flies, interviewing the injured, talking to each other in low voices, and helping shopkeepers collect their scattered inventory, Vanishing unsalvageable debris. Most of the wounded bystanders just looked a little dazed but there were a few who were monopolising the Healers’ time with bloodied robes and tear-stained cheeks.
“I think they come in every so often and throw away some of the old takeaway tupperwares.”
“Fine,” he sighed. “I’m not making any promises, and I’m also not giving you a
. While he may have all the relevant experience, Harry couldn’t imagine himself leading a department. He was only twenty-six and he couldn’t keep a relationship going, let alone a national branch of law enforcement.
The conversation was rapidly veering off track. “Sir,” he said, shortly, trying to steer it back to the topic, “Respectfully, I don’t see how interfering in private businesses is worth our time?”
“Can’t you just fuck off?” Draco asked.
“I don’t know how you passed any of the observation modules,” Belinda said to him, shaking her head.
“I should go,” he said and Draco didn’t know whether he was imagining the tone of voice that suggested he didn’t
“Oh, sorry I’m not begging for the chance to lick your boots like everyone else in the world,” Draco said, scathingly. “It might surprise you to find out that some people
The next morning, the owl was waiting patiently on his sewing table. Potter’s reply was succinct:
“A sleepover,” Luna corrected, pulling the throw cushions off the sofa and making a nest on the floor close to the fire. The other three chose chairs.
“Ambrose,” someone called from the other room. The Auror let his robe fall and left them without a glance.
. That train of thought wouldn’t take him anywhere good. He went back to counting the fence posts and thinking of a job he could do once he got home to keep him busy for the evening. He’d weeded and pruned the entire garden until three o’clock in the morning the previous night, waiting until he was on the verge of passing out before collapsing into bed. Now
“What else would I do?” he asked. Ginny’s eyebrows twitched upwards questioningly, so he elaborated. “If I turned down the promotion. What would I do instead?”
Harry interrupted, “From the woman who cared for Madam Malkin, Robards told me.”
It was surprising to realise that there were still simple things that could bring him joy.
Ginny’s hair was plaited tightly against her scalp in her Quidditch style and her skin was still pink from her shower — she liked the water to be scalding. She grabbed a piece of bread from the bread bin and dropped it into the toaster. She turned her back on it while it toasted, crossing her arms over her chest and kicked one foot back against the cupboard door.
“Didn’t Professor Binns spend all of your Fourth Year going on about it?” Draco asked.
“Yeah. It’s a thing.”
Harry piled his bags into the
He found Pansy underneath a large oak, leaning against the trunk, fanning herself and reading a book. He dropped the baguette he’d bought from a Muggle cornershop on the picnic blanket.
“I miss you,” he whispered, and then headed back up to the Manor. He had some sewing to do.
What he wanted
“It’s impossible, there’s no way I can make it work,” he complained to Pansy as they walked from St. Mungo’s to Blaise’s house one evening.
“How was your weekend then?” she asked.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Yes, how did you…”
“A wizard. He wanted dress robes.”
“What a fuckwit,” Millie said.
“I’ve been thinking a lot over the last two years about what makes me happy. I feel like I’ve spent my life doing what I
“I’m not an oaf because I don’t care about clothes,” Harry argued.
“Morning!” she sang out, chucking the paper down on the table.
“I’m fine.” He tried to smile to make it more convincing. Behind him, the door banged open.
“I did some fucked up stuff back then,” he murmured, his eyes closed. “I don’t think you need to apologise.”
He didn’t take much from his office — just his favourite quill, old robes he’d forgotten months ago, and the photos of his parents, the DA, and Ron and Hermione’s wedding. For the thousands of hours he’d spent inside those four walls, very little of his life was there.
“Yes,” Rolf agreed. “On an unrelated note, Luna’s going to be heading to Siberia on a completely non-hunting related mission…”
“Oh yeah, it really looked like you were hating every minute of it. I could tell by the way you were
, he’d wallow, and if he wallowed, then he wasn’t sure if he’d ever convince himself to get out of bed again.
“…What do you mean?”
The illustration in this chapter was created by
“Alright,” he replied.
Draco lost track of time. His thoughts slowed to a crawl, so preoccupied with the feel of Harry’s lips, the warmth of his hands, the comfort of his weight pressing down on Draco’s chest. There was nothing to think about except the way that Harry held him when they rolled onto their sides, catching their breaths for a moment before Harry bumped his nose against Draco’s, nudging his face up to slide their lips back together.
“What are you here for?” he spat.
“I think it was a culmination of lots of little things,” Potter said awkwardly.
Draco yelped and grabbed him by the shoulders and spun to face him, pulling him into a tight embrace which Harry returned reflexively.
He glanced over as Potter also fell quiet. He was watching Draco with a soft smile, his eyes flicking down to Draco’s lips and back up to his eyes.
“You have to cast those for them to be of any use,” Ginny pointed out.
They sprang apart instantly, their faces red and hair mussed. Harry spun around, reaching for his wand as he looked for the source of the noise. Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
She glowered and poked him. Hard. “Fuck off or I’ll make it hurt.”
“The things that didn’t involve my friends were all about being outside or about Hogwarts. And then Hagrid told us he was retiring and moving to France with Madame Maxime, and Ron made a joke about how I should take over because I know the Forbidden Forest better than anyone and, well, it sort of stuck.
“Blimey, Harry, how’d you manage to get so many?” Ron asked, jealousy tingeing the admiration in his voice.
“No, I can’t—” the Muggle protested.
“Well, off you go. You might have forgotten that I’m actually at a funeral right now and I’m not about to abandon Maggie.”
“I can see that,” Potter said and paused awkwardly before asking, “Um… Who died?”
Theo’s blood from it.
insistent?”
“I don’t mope. It’s undignified.”
about it — or at least not look like Harry was marching him to an execution.
Harry moved faster, his tongue licking from side to side as his hands circled the last inch of Draco’s dick that he couldn’t quite get in his mouth. Draco stared down in awe at the sight, trying to commit it to memory: his swollen, spit-slicked, cherry red lips; his long lashes that fanned across his cheeks; the size of his bicep as he worked his own cock along with his movements.
Draco glared at him. “I need to measure you.”
“I’m going to get a refill — anyone else want one? My lord?” George Weasley asked, curtsying at Harry, who gave him the finger. He gestured at Draco, but he shook his head, his mind full of memories of the twins’ pranks at Hogwarts.
“I decided to buy some focaccia.”
“What. The.
“But we’ve talked to everyone here,” Harry said. “You’ve shown off our robes and I’m sure there’ll be fifty new clients on your doorstep tomorrow morning — can’t we go?”
By that point, there were six men standing in a small room. Draco backed up into the sinks, staying as far out of the way as possible when there was another knock on the door and Potter let in Greg and the Muggle witness. With the eight of them crammed into the bathroom, Draco was practically sitting in a sink and Naismith was trying to sidle into a toilet cubicle (though maybe that was an escape plan).
Was that true, though? At the back of his head, the memory of Malfoy’s fingers against his throat surfaced and a treacherous thought pointed out that
“Yes,” Draco said and, as an afterthought, added, “Please.”
Draco pursed his lips. “How about an unlimited budget and I’ll show you the design before I start making it.”
He collapsed onto his bed, sated and satisfied, his eyelids finally feeling heavy. He probably would have been asleep in seconds if it wasn’t for the loud knocking on the front door, echoing through the empty manor and causing the security wards to buzz angrily at the intrusion.
The shapes didn’t fade away like the other ones, instead Bill pushed them forward and they floated down and passed through Harry and Draco’s chests and then reversed direction. By the time they reached Bill, he’d conjured a piece of black parchment which he used to catch the symbols. They bled onto the parchment like ink and read them with pursed lips.
“Guess I have. Sorry,” he sighed and ran his hands through his bird-nest hair again, “I don’t know what I’m doing here. I should go.”
“What? No,” Harry said quickly. “Of course not, I was just… Saying.”
“Sickle for your thoughts?” she said.
But when he’d asked what she meant, she’d burst into tears and left.
“Bet you a Galleon it’ll be on the front page,” Ginny said with a grin, flopping onto the sofa next to him.
The issue was Potter, as it always was.
? Harry couldn’t remember ever noticing it at Hogwarts but then they’d been in uniforms. Draco undoubtedly had new robes every year and he’d always looked put-together but not like
“I’ll come visit after work tomorrow,” he promised, as he carefully handed Rose over to Ron, trying not to jostle her awake. As he put the chair back against the wall where he’d found it, Parkinson eyed Ron suspiciously.
“So, if you won’t come back, what are you going to do?”
“They, er, don’t like me very much,” Potter admitted, glancing around the shop anxiously as if he was expecting the Ministry suppliers to come jumping out from behind a mannequin.
Her eyebrows shot up and her mouth fell open in amazement.
“I’m not having a crisis,” Potter argued.
Besides, they were in the middle of an argument and Harry refused to let Malfoy win a fight, even if he couldn’t quite remember the point of it.
Draco pulled off, panting. Harry grabbed his forearms and pulled him back up so their eyes were level once more. He groaned as Harry rolled him onto his back and gathered his wrists with one of his hands, bringing them up above his head and pinning Draco under his weight. Draco was aching with want, so acute it was almost a

to what he wore last week. You got Millie to sleep with him.”
Naked but uncaring, Harry took his hand and pulled him out into the hallway and through a door opposite. Draco didn’t have a chance to snoop before Harry pushed him onto a king-size bed. He knelt on top of Draco, sitting on his thighs, looking down at him, his eyes dark. He splayed his palm across Draco’s chest, on top of the mess of silvery scars that adorned his chest like feather stitches.
Not only was he going to be late for lunch, he would also be empty-handed. Pansy was going to hex him. He groaned.
His cheeks heated. “Uh, well, I mean, I guess— I don’t really know much about this stuff.” He plucked awkwardly at the fabric.
He returned to the sewing room, yawning and stretching and looking forward to a decent night’s sleep. Hopefully this time uninterrupted by the stress dreams that had been haunting him for the last few nights.
“Urgh,” Theo groaned, cupping his nose. “Thanks.”
” The spell was directed at Theo, who slumped out of the Body-Bind Curse, sliding a few inches down the wall unsteadily until he got his feet under him. “You all right, Nott?”
. I refuse to take your word for it,” Draco sniped and pushed the robes towards him again, but Potter didn’t move to pick them up this time. He glanced between Draco and Maggie, rubbing the nape of his neck.
“Is the Beast done?” Maggie’s voice piped up from the floor, where she was cutting up a set of bedsheets she’d bought from a Muggle charity shop to use as scrap fabric. They hadn’t referred to the project as anything other than
“Yes, fine,” he sighed. He rinsed the blood from his hand in the kitchen sink, leaving the tap running for a moment longer, watching the pink-tinged water spiral down the drain. He rubbed his thumb against the fading red line on his palm.
“Stay still,” Draco ordered softly as he took Harry into his mouth.
“There was a woman who came in and spoke with Belinda. She testified
“Unfortunately there are downsides of this job,” Robards said. Harry wasn’t sure he’d heard an
“You heard already?” he asked.
“You looking good today. The others were talking about it after the meeting.”
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
A sliver of white amongst the yellow caught his eye. Curiously, he put his glasses back on and pulled out the misplaced square of white card, only for his heart to immediately sink when he realised it was just the invite to the War Recovery Ball. He spun in his chair, about to frisbee it toward the bin, when he abruptly lost track of what he was doing.
“I do,” Potter said defensively. “It means, um, it’s held at nighttime?”
“I’m going to be blunt. What would it take for you to consider going back?” he asked.
“Long day?” Harry asked, putting Ginny and Ron’s mugs down on the coffee table for when they came back in.
Not even mentioned in the file was the rest of Draco’s strange behaviour, but it was certainly playing on Harry’s mind as he read the file. Why
, because he didn’t want to know what Harry Potter looked like from this angle.
“Keep supporting her head,” he said.
Harry’s birthday, so he followed him out, closing the door behind them.
“Thanks? I guess?”
“I have my sources,” she said, tapping the side of her nose. Her brow furrowed as she regarded him speculatively. “I thought you’d be happier about it. Why aren’t you happy?”
“I—” He deflated. “Sure. Good luck with try-outs tonight.”
His stomach dropped as he soared upwards, the wind whistling past his ears so loudly he could hear nothing else. The sheen of sweat on his forehead evaporated in the cool breeze as he raced from one end of the pitch to the other.
? Harry blinked as he tried to come to terms with the idea of Draco Malfoy having any kind of denim hanging in his wardrobe.
“Cheers,” he said, holding his glass.

Not even enough evidence that an
she demanded.
“Well you’ve done a great job on that,” she said shortly, downing the last dregs of tea and picking up her purse. “See you later. Will you tell Hermione I say good luck if she goes into labour before I get a chance to see her.”
He forked over the small fortune, thanked them both and left with his new fixed robes in a bag as six o’clock arrived. The other shops on the street were just flipping their signs to ‘closed’ and there were only a few other last-minute shoppers with Harry making their way back home.
“Just so we’re clear, I still hate you,” he prefaced, “but I think you should go to the hospital.”
He directed Potter to the mannequins. “Which of these do you like?”

“Coffee?” he shouted, jerking his thumb towards a coffee shop.
that no one had thrown out yet. Absentmindedly, he flicked through the pages, ignoring the stories themselves in favour of dissecting the photos.
The yellow streetlights became sporadic and then sparse, like the outer edges of a spider web. Harry flew straight until they disappeared altogether, giving way to fields and farms that looked darker than the sea in the night. He dived lower, performing a slow motion Wronski Feint for his own amusement — revelling in the surge of adrenaline as the ground got closer and closer before he yanked the handle up at the last moment. He dangled feet from the stirrups, dragging his toes through the waving stalks of wheat and frightening some resting skylarks as he levelled off.
Draco exhaled.
“Of course you can,” she said.
Potter shifted his weight from foot to foot and ran a hand through his hair again. “I wanted to apologise,” he said.
Ginny nodded and followed Harry into the nearest cafe, which was busy with Muggles on their way to work and the queue stretched from the counter to the door.
In his office, Harry skipped over the pile of memos that had collected on his doormat over the last few days and threw the file straight onto a stack of other papers that he was very good at ignoring. He sat down at his desk for a moment but he was too filled with energy to stay still and he leapt to his feet and began pacing back and forth. The green carpet was so worn out it had faded to a greyish brown, trodden down by decades of Aurors before Harry. Everywhere else in Harry’s office was a mess of rubbish. Old cases, broken umbrellas, spare pairs of shoes, and empty takeout bags littered the floor, but Harry kept this space free of debris so he had some room to pace.
“Any strange feelings, urges to find Mr. Malfoy?” he asked.
Draco joined him. They were on the first floor, and the view was mostly of the kitchen roof but the bottom of the garden stretched out just past the tiles where two small children, blue- and blonde-haired, were running about in the rose bushes growing against the stone wall.
He gritted his teeth against the cold and sat as still as possible. To keep his mind off the bone-chilling discomfort, he watched Potter and his friends. He hadn’t seen the three of them together outside of photos in the
,” he seethed. His jaw ached from clenching it as he reviewed the wreckage of Maggie’s shop. It looked like it had been the scene of a duel. The Aurors had torn clothes from their hangers and removed all the wizarding pictures in the workroom, smashing the frames for good measure. Every drawer had been pulled out and their contents emptied onto the floor. Everything in the supply cupboard that had held most of their magical tools (small, helpful gadgets like self-stitching needles and hovering magnifying glasses that couldn’t pose a threat even to the stupidest of Muggles) had been confiscated.
. I was being
Draco slid his finger up from Harry’s chin to his jaw, cupping his cheek as he kissed him deeply.
Slytherin had deservedly won the House Cup in First Year if not for Dumbledore giving out a hundred and sixty points. They also would have won the Quidditch Cup in his Second Year, if the whole Chamber of Secrets debacle hadn’t occurred. After all, Draco had undoubtedly been one of the best Seekers in Hogwarts at the time. He didn’t have a choice but to be, given the amount of money his father had poured into broomsticks and lessons with the best coaches. The Malfoys had always been excellent at Quidditch, and Lucius was determined that Draco would be no exception. For Draco’s ninth birthday, his father bought a set of Quidditch hoops and set them up on one of the empty fields on the other side of the duck pond. Draco had been so enamoured with his present, he refused to go inside all day. His mother had to bribe him with five Galleons to get off his broom and blow out the candles on his birthday cake in front of his relatives.
“I’m sorry, for what it’s worth. I really didn’t know what was going on with the raid until a few minutes beforehand, and I swear, I

“What the fuck do you want?” he spat.

to give you tips on how to seduce Draco Malfoy. Can you see how it’s a bit of a weird position to put me in?”
“Thanks — tell him not to rush. We can wait,” Harry said with a charming smile. The mediwitch blushed and
“I think you still have to make that up to me,” he whispered.
“Wouldn’t bother, mate,” he said when he noticed Draco going to the door. “There are some right weirdos in there — think they must be on ket or something.”
The clouds hung so low on Thursday morning that it felt more like December than May. It made Harry feel even more tired than usual when his wand emitted a loud, piercing screech at 5 AM. The warm shower almost lulled him back to sleep and he got dressed mechanically, not paying attention to if he was putting his limbs into the right holes. Kreacher was in the kitchen, laying out breakfast and Harry sat at the table, washing down slices of toast with coffee as he stared at the fire crackling in the grate.
“You,” he gasped, bucking his hips forward, desperate for more. “Touching me.”
And then, of course, he’d personally ransacked Draco’s job in front of his friends, thereby ruining any chance of it ever going anywhere.
“Of course,” Pansy said, not sounding at all convinced but she changed the topic, throwing the half-eaten baguette at him. “Put this far away from me or I’ll eat the whole thing. Have I told you about Mrs. Mudgeon yet?”
Harry bristled. “I hang around with the right sort of people who don’t care about stuff like that.”
“Uh. Robes.”

. Perhaps Harry had turned into some kind of Divination master in the last twenty-four hours and his dream was actually prophetic.
different about this measurement than an arm or a head.
“Alright,” Robards announced at seven o’clock on the dot, rapping his wand against the lectern. “Morning all. Let’s get straight to business. Giles Thorne’s trial has been scheduled for next Monday at 9 AM, those of you who’ve been called to testify will be sent memos so keep your eye out for those and make sure you’re
“Ha ha,” he drawled. He picked up the scraps. “Maggie will give you a token — when it turns green, it means you can come back to pick them up.”
The next time he let it go, he waited a full five minutes. He spun lazily in a small circle, nearly lying flat on his broom handle, one arm dangling into the air below. It was terrible Quidditch form — the kind of lackadaisical posture one could expect from the Hufflepuff team practice — but no one stood on the ground, shouting critiques up at him, so he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Or you could read your memos? Then you could guarantee you wouldn’t miss any big events,” Robards suggested lightly.
This, though? This view of Malfoy on his knees with an eyebrow quirked like an invitation? This was something else entirely.
Rolf was explaining the yeti situation. “There're rumours one’s turned up in Siberia. Of course, if the governments find it first, they’ll order it to be culled because of the Statute of Secrecy and all that, so I want to find it first. Get it back to the Himalayas rather than kill it.”
“Oh, cut it out, Draco, we’re your friends. Everyone knows it’s acceptable to gossip about your friends.”
“Harry?” Robards asked.
But in actuality, he felt none of those things. Just more grey.
Even on a headless, armless model and with Harry’s incredibly limited fashion knowledge, he could tell they were remarkable. True to his promise, they were all black, except for the high-collared white shirt. The black lining on the inside of the cloak was the same type of fabric Draco had been holding earlier and the sunlight picked up golden threads woven into the expensive silk. There was a row of three silver buttons down the waistcoat, which matched the delicate silver thread that lined the cloak. Every item of clothing was immaculately pressed, not a wrinkle in sight.
“You’re better at dealing with your emotions, everyone knows that! You’ve told me
“Alright Malfoy,” Weasley said. “D’you want any tea or coffee?”
It distracted him from work: his mind would drift in the middle of a hem and the next thing he knew, an hour had passed without him making a single stitch. He offended Maggie multiple times by zoning out in the middle of conversations. He might have gotten away with that, had he also not gone to check their tie inventory for a customer, only to forget what he was doing while in the workroom and leave the man unattended for twenty minutes before he eventually stormed out. They didn’t have the traffic to lose a paying customer, and Maggie didn’t speak to him once for the rest of the day.
Filled with purpose, he put down his cup and went to get his broomstick. Nimbus slung over his shoulder, Draco strolled down to the broom shed and retrieved a set of practice Quidditch balls. He gave the training Snitch a minute’s head start before kicking off.
He stood, which was harder than it should be due to the enveloping velvet couch cushions, and picked his way over Millie’s legs, heading to the crowded bar. Uninterested in waiting for half an hour and missing even more gossip than he already had, he shouldered his way through, ignoring the Muggles’ angry mutters. Aside from a tall, lanky man with dark hair that flopped over his forehead greasily who sniped,
Harry blinked at him. Draco grimaced.
With the last minute fee added, they ended up costing an eye-watering amount of money — more than Harry had spent even on his Yule Ball dress robes — but he would pay his entire Gringotts vault to Malfoy if it meant he didn’t have to face Venus in the Auror uniform supply office. The last time she’d given him a new uniform, she’d said on no uncertain terms that if she saw his face again in the next three months, she would hex him and send him out into the field in his underwear, and she hadn’t been joking.
She had a point, though.
of the grandfather clock in the corridor, muffled by the closed door. It was late. He should be asleep. He had a mountain of housework to do tomorrow, as well as all the work he hadn’t done on Potter’s robes to catch up with. Unfortunately, his body hadn’t got the memo, and he was painfully awake.
“For heaven’s sake,” Pansy said, elbowing past Draco and rapping smartly on the door twice.
Struck with the sudden, intense urge to be
“Thank you. I’m sorry,” he said again.
“It wasn’t bad as in
It was opened by a wizened house-elf who peered up at them with enormous eyes that only got wider when they landed on Draco. It was a strange sight, especially given that he was wearing one of those joke Muggle t-shirts with a tux printed on the front. It fell to his knees like a dress.
Draco tried not to blush when he sat back at his desk. Clearly, he didn’t do so well enough.
As soon as he fell asleep, he was transported to the witch’s exhibit. Except instead of inspiring women, it was a celebration of Potter’s greatest moments: the Battle of Hogwarts, next to an eleven-year-old Harry lifting the House Cup, and then one of Harry fighting an enormous snake. Each of them had a little plaque that explained the feat of bravery that was depicted.
with his own taste, style and expectations. It shouldn’t have been such a surprise to him that their personalities didn’t fit together: from their very first conversation, they had been opposites — their lives on entirely different trajectories, different astral planes, even. This stupid project felt like an attempt to reconcile more than fifteen years of opposition into a single design and, as Draco was quickly coming to realise, it just didn’t work like that.
Robards mimicked Harry and sat back, crossing his arms as he regarded him. “You seem confused,” he observed.
The uncontrollable, jittery energy returned and he leapt to his feet. His hands itched with the urge to punch something. With a wordless shout of frustration, he slapped a mug from his desk, but the subsequent shatter of porcelain didn’t improve his mood. Instead, he just felt a bit stupid as he waved his wand and gathered all the pieces into the bin.
,” he said.
“It feels like everywhere I turn at the moment, you’re there!” Draco interrupted. “I
“I was respectful earlier, and it didn’t work,” he fumed.
“So this is the thanks I get for taking my granddaughter out to breakfast?” Madam Malkin said as Draco stirred a teaspoon of sugar into his coffee, intently focused on not clinking the spoon against the mug.
He slipped two fingers between the tape and Potter’s neck.
“I care about giving my best impression,” Malfoy said.
to tell you that there’s lots of work that you could do for me,” Madam Malkin said. “Surely that would be better than sitting here waiting for a single customer?”
“Thanks.”
you know that right?”
He strode down the corridor and into the front hall, trepidation rising. He held his wand out in front of him as the door reverberated again with three swift knocks.
“I’m not really sure,” Potter said hopelessly. “There’s this charity ball I have to go to and I just thought that I’d need new ones. I haven’t bought new robes since the Yule Ball. Do you have any recommendations? I’m kind of hopeless with this.”
“Hm. Sit down, I was just making breakfast.”
Maggie bit her lip and glanced at the shut door, effectively answering his question.
“I—” he began to say, but then an Auror was calling his name. He snapped his mouth shut and straightened his shoulders, brushing past Draco.
As Hermione and Rose disappeared up the rickety stairs, Ginny collapsed onto the newly vacated sofa.
“Oh, right. Um. Thanks,” he said, trying to smooth down his hair one more time.
Draco rolled his eyes. “It was just a Stunner.”
It was still ten minutes until midnight, but the glitz of the ball had lost its enchantment. All Draco wanted now was to go home and leave those robes in piles on the bedroom floor (and maybe make a case for why they needed to at least extend the hut to have a bedroom big enough to fit a king-size bed).
Draco crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. He did
“Even though she’s a Muggle?” Greg asked, crossing his arms across his chest. The pose made his biceps bulge threateningly. He’d always been a big lad, and the years of working a physical job had only added more muscle.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I won’t make you look like
“Luna,” Draco greeted. “This is a lovely party.”
“What’s the extra work? Are you still going to be on this cursed mirror case?”
As Hermione tried to help him clean up, Harry swooped back down and easily wrestled the baby from Draco’s arms without even waking her.
“Yes, isn’t it?” she said dreamily. “I like your robes.”
“You know you can talk to me,” she said, her voice gentle.
Harry sat back in the chair, a bit stunned. It wasn’t
off!” George protested, aghast.
Draco glowered at her, any positive emotion he had ever felt towards the woman evaporating.
He went home and stood on the doorstep for a long minute as his mind raced.
issues, I won’t lie. But we’re going to change things. We won, after all, we’re in charge.”
The steam from his coffee curled around his face as he raised the cup to take a sip, the hot, wet tendrils leaving a layer of moistness on his cheeks as he stayed hunched over his mug for a long moment.
Somewhat desperately now, Robards got to his feet as he beseeched Harry. “Think of what you’re giving up. You’ve been working towards this for years.”
Potter hung back.
His room was a mess of fabric and half-sewn clothes and patterns and discarded designs. Some of it was work Draco had brought home, but there were also passion projects and late-night ideas he sketched to keep his mind busy when he couldn’t sleep, the folds of fabric keeping the past from pressing down on him and driving him to insanity.
“How are you? How’s Rose doing?” she asked.
They both came to a stop in front of the lifts. The clock-like semi-circular bronze display above the doors announced that the lift was currently on the ground floor, Harry pressed the button to call it to the sixth floor and wished the hand would move slightly faster as it crawled upward. Parkinson flipped open a file and scanned it with a distinctly Slytherin air of disinterest.
The Healer raised his hands and shook his head. “Don’t be silly! It’s an honour to help you, Mr. Potter!”
He rubbed his hand up and down Draco’s back, bringing back memories of evenings spent listing the things that made them happy.
The Aurors had dispelled the Concealment Charm to the Muggle section of the shop and from in his new position against the wall, Draco could see them tearing apart the shop: wrenching out the contents of cupboards, going through the till, pulling the paintings off the walls.
Harry left, swinging the door shut behind him a bit too hard so that glass rattled threateningly. A few heads jerked in his direction and he stared at his feet, blushing faintly, as he strode to his office rather than meet any of his colleagues’ curious glances. At least when he was Head Auror he wouldn’t have to deal with Robards ordering him around any more — not that he
“Do you need anything before I go?” he asked, peering around the mannequin. Maggie was lying on her stomach amongst the cotton strips.
“It’s barely six thirty, that’s not late for people who have jobs. Maybe you’ll understand one day.” He threw an arm along the back of the sofa around Pansy. “Did anyone get me a drink?”
They’d stood side-by-side, ignoring the small collection of chairs laid out haphazardly in front of the grave. He hadn’t dared ask why no one else came, though he’d always wondered bitterly where Draco’s friends were. How could they live with themselves after making him go through that alone?
Harry pulled a face. “Do you really want the details?”
Behind her, Millie waved bottles of wine in the air with a grin. Blaise brandished four wine glasses in his fist, held by their delicate stems.
He shook her off. “It’s not even noon. I’m fine.”
He smiled at the memory. He hadn’t flown there in years…
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, I could buy a new broomstick for that much, I’m not spending it on dress robes. Four hundred.” His eyes darted back over to the example mannequins, resting for a moment on Draco’s beloved peacock-coloured robes. “And they have to be black.”
“That’s nice of her,” Hermione said.
“Well that was eventful,” Potter said in the strange silence that followed.
Draco waited by his chair as Maggie walked up to the grave, which had been magically filled with dirt, and lay a lily on top of the fresh soil. She was wiping a tear from her cheek as she returned to Draco’s side.

“Did you know him?”

The floorboard creaked under his weight and she turned with more speed than a woman of her advanced years should reasonably have.
The Auror pointed towards the Muggle front. “That’s a Muggle street,” he said.

it open for the next four years. Her grandmother visited the shop regularly to moan at Maggie for her lack of loyalty to the family legacy in an obvious attempt to guilt-trip her into closing up shop and working at Madam Malkin’s, but Maggie was brave enough to stand up to her each time. Draco was especially grateful for that, given that there wasn’t a hope in hell that any shop on Diagon Alley would hire him.
“Stop freaking out,” he murmured, and kissed him softly. Obediently, pliantly, Harry opened his mouth to the kiss, letting Draco explore with his tongue, but then he pulled away and traced one scar with his fingertip. Draco shivered.
Malfoy continued, unaware of Harry’s turmoil, “What time do you call this? You know we have lives outside of work, right?”
of an Apparition. Most of the group followed his lead, turning out of sight.
What if it
“Stop,” Potter interrupted, holding up his hands and it was clear as day to Draco how uncomfortable he was. He turned to Draco, the artificial lights reflecting off his glasses. “Malfoy — why were you duelling in a Muggle toilet?”
“Maggie’s going to be heartbroken,” Draco sighed, mostly to himself, but Millie reached out and put her hand around Draco’s clenched fist. She squeezed gently.
“I’m going to take Ron his hangover potion,” Hermione said tactfully, getting up and making a swift exit as Harry stumbled around for an explanation.
Harry was quiet for a moment, then he said, “That wouldn’t be so bad.”
“You alright, Malfoy?” Ron asked.
Malfoy shrugged.
. The more he thought about it, the more it seemed likely that he’d fallen a bit in love with Draco Malfoy without realising.
said he was nipping to the loo, and he’s come back missing half his clothes with bruises all down his neck, so heaven only knows what happened to him.”
“Were you sleeping?” he asked.
“Not too bad for a Friday yet,” Greg said smoothly. “What are you drinking?”
He sighed and turned back to his desk, ready to make a dent in the leave requests when he felt it again: that

It had been a decade, but watching Potter stumble his way through a waltz with Pavarti remained one of his favourite memories. Trying to demonstrate Potter’s bumbling steps to the lower years in the Slytherin common room the next night while bent double in hysterical laughter had been even better than watching Potter get chased by a dragon.
like Pansy’s asked, but it couldn’t be because there wasn’t a single conceivable reason Pansy Parkinson would ask after Granger and call her ‘Hermione’. Confused, Draco whipped around to find the source of the imposter’s voice, but there was definitely only Pansy sitting there, looking at Potter with a raised brow.
“Can’t help but feel like I’m getting special treatment though, seeing as she got that for free while I’m spending a month’s salary on robes at the moment,” he continued.
It took his eyes a second to adjust to the gloom of 12 Grimmauld Place. Compared to the bright sunshine in the back garden, the quiet old townhouse felt like a mausoleum. He’d potentially been to the Black’s house before Walburga Black’s death, but he had no memory of the corridors. He located the bathroom, but after he’d splashed water on his face and checked his reflection in the mirror to ensure he was still looking good, he found himself heading in the opposite direction of the party.
“Do we still owe you for last time?” he asked as Greg deposited a large glass of red wine in front of him.
The trepidation was clear in his fiance’s voice. Draco glared at McGonagall, trying to tell her through his stare that he wouldn’t let her say no. If she rejected Harry, he would quit his job and dedicate his life to sending her to an early grave—
“Normal?” Harry asked.
“I really don’t have a clue what’s going on,” he said and yawned.
He shrugged. He wasn’t sure what to do with these adult-versions of Weasley — who offered him tea like he was a welcome guest — and Granger, who asked whether he was okay. He still thought of her as the girl who punched him in the face.
Could he tell her? Was it weird?
He’d resented them for it at first, even after the apologies, but after a few months back in the wizarding world, he understood why they’d acted like that. For all their lives, they’d been on top of magical society — it was difficult to adjust to one where they were at the bottom. The others hadn’t even been Death Eaters, just
His ideas from the weekend were unstructured and incongruous: a sleeveless outer robe on one page, followed by a dozen different ideas for cufflinks for the cuffs that didn’t exist yet, most of them scribbled out. Around one of his later attempts were annotations for possible tailoring charms that would work well with the fabric and achieve the impact Draco was aiming for.
Another issue they had to overcome: Muggle money. None of them had a clue how it worked and there were so many different pennies and rectangles of slippery paper that they didn’t know where to start. Eventually, Greg came to the rescue and said he’d handle all of it. After all, he got paid in Muggle money so was having to make weekly trips to Gringotts to convert his wages. He started paying for their drinks with his elektrick money card during his shifts and then charging them back in Galleons every few weeks once the tab had racked up.
“Are you coming to dinner at Ron and Hermione’s tonight?” he asked as they joined the end of the line, examining the limited choices of drinks (tea, coffee, tea with milk, coffee with milk).
The silk sheets twisted around his body as he fidgeted, impatient for sleep to come, and he forced himself to lie still.
It was better but it still wasn’t
“I told you, I didn’t see any of the action.”
“I’m not.”
a funny look.”
The rest of the team were already there nursing steaming cups, and they mumbled sleepy greetings.
“I want creative control and an unlimited budget,” Draco said.
“I don’t know,” he said.
She cuffed him around the back of the head as they reached the head of the queue.
That was a harder question to answer.
He held out a rectangle of white card, definitely too nice to be from the Auror stationery cupboard. It had a border of monogrammed gold filigree designs and Harry’s name written in painstakingly precise calligraphy in the centre of some typed text.
“Neither,” Draco spat. “She left earlier.”
He wore Muggle workout clothes: hideous knee-length shorts in a lurid green and a black vest made of a stretchy material that should have offended all of Draco’s sensibilities but didn’t. His mouth went dry, and he had to tear his eyes away from Potter’s biceps.
His stomach dropped as the windows were smashed in. Blaise, Millie, and Pansy jumped to their feet, reaching for their wands and sending their glasses skittering across the table. Wine spilt in dark red pools, turning the white shirt burgundy. Draco didn’t have time to spare a thought for his stained clothes as he dashed to the shop floor where Pansy was standing, spotlighted in the glare of several
“Maggie told me to come in,” he said.
She nodded encouragingly. “I’ll be here. Need to find the pins,” she said, pointing at the floor but shooting him furtive glances as he crossed over to the door. He quietly cleared his throat as he pushed down on the handle.
Maggie shrugged, twirling her quill between her index and middle fingers. “Wouldn’t know — I don’t think I went to a History of Magic class after the first week. Merlin, they were boring.”
“It’s not—” He cut himself off with a disgruntled groan. “I just mean I’m not a doll.”
He couldn’t see Potter anywhere, which was probably a good thing. Draco wasn’t sure if he’d be able to restrain himself. He might not have his wand, but he could land at least one good punch before the Aurors took him down. The satisfaction of his fist colliding with Potter’s cheek might even be worth the inevitable Azkaban sentence.
He rocked back on the chair, balancing for a moment on the back two legs as he glanced through the door into the wizarding section of the shop. The ties in the tie display were askew from the witch who’d dropped by to get her daughter measured for a flower girl dress. The girl had run havoc and refused to stand still, then burst into tears when Draco had accidentally caught her ankle with a pin.
“You can have a hundred Galleons and I can veto anything I don’t like about the design.”
“No,” Harry said slowly. “No, sir, not confused. Just coming to terms with the idea.”
Still, despite his friends’ reassurance, Harry got the distinct impression that they thought he was insane. Before he could challenge them, the crackling flames roared upwards, tinged with green, and Ginny came skidding out onto the hearth, brushing ash from her cape.
His robes — the ones Draco had practically made from scratch — flared behind him. It was exactly as Draco had designed: the straight shoulders made his already impressive figure even more imposing; the cuffs buttoned tightly around his wrists, keeping his hands unobstructed for wandwork. It fell to his mid-calf, but the charmed fabric didn’t tangle around his limbs like the others. They were both practical and impressive, and the sight of them made Draco sick to his stomach.
Draco spun around and sure enough, there were Potter, Weasley, and Granger (or the Granger-Weasleys, he supposed they were now) wandering off the paved road through the middle of the park, heading for a free patch of sunny grass. They were wearing the kind of clothes that gave Muggle fashion a bad name in the wizarding world: shapeless, ugly denim jeans and baggy t-shirts. Granger’s ill-fitting dungarees were stretched across her enormous, swollen stomach.
Draco swallowed hard and once again, the dark clouds were hanging heavily overhead and it was only him and a modest row of empty seats — just in case someone arrived.
“Piss off George,” Harry said cheerfully. He met Draco’s gaze across the table and smiled at him. Draco’s cheeks flushed lightly.
.” Millie waved her hand in front of his face and he blinked, coming out of his reprieve. Everyone was looking at him.
The spell that hit him was lightless and soundless. In fact, if it hadn’t lifted him from his feet and thrown him into a display of artisanal pickled vegetables, Draco wouldn’t have known he’d been hit by anything at all. At least he hadn’t been the target, for once; it was a simple case of bad luck — wrong place, wrong time. The wrong place being Underborough Market and the wrong time being the morning of the Aurors’ attempt to capture a serial killer.
Potter practically dragged him to the end of the queue. A witch who was sitting against the wall gingerly holding her wrist glanced up at them and then did a double-take when she spotted Potter. Draco scoffed and crossed his arms. Potter looked a bit uncomfortable as he scratched the back of his neck with his wand.
He couldn’t say which of them moved in first: it felt like a simultaneous decision to lean over the uncomfortable chair arms, tilting their heads in opposite directions so their lips slotted together like jigsaw pieces.
Hermione shrugged. “I know she was one of the worst at school, but it
As he and Ginny gathered their stuff, ready to leave, Ginny casually asked, “Oh, Harry, do you mind if I pop in for a moment? I want to grab that mug I keep forgetting.”
“I’m fine,” Draco said shortly. “Stop worrying about me.”
Robards grimaced. Harry’s dislike of formal events was infamous; he made his hatred very much known whenever he was dragged to an event, to the point where most people had stopped forcing him to come though the invites never ceased. He was content enough with giving a generous donation and then getting to bed early, his conscience clear.
His tie was crooked. Draco reached up to straighten it, and it was only when he had both hands under Harry’s jaw that it clicked what an intimate gesture it was. He coughed and dropped his hands to his hips.

Harry wanted to scream, but he bit his tongue. When he had control enough over his temper to be sure he wouldn’t throw punches, he spoke. His voice was icy with rage.
straight into her mouth from her wand, the snot dribbling from her nose mixing with the tears streaming down her face. It had turned into a group favourite and they often stayed the night at Pansy’s just to have an excuse to get dinner from Peri’s.
“Give me a moment with Theo first?”
“What are they doing?” Draco paused at the door.
It turned out natural inclination towards dark, muted colour schemes actually worked better in Muggle clothes than the garish designs favoured by most wizards and he discovered ways to blend the two worlds together.
helping people.”
“Was he there?” Hermione asked.
He scoffed. “Yeah. Right. Well, do me a favour and have your little sexuality crisis on someone else’s doorstep.”
A gentle breeze tickled the hair at the nape of his neck, carrying over a low monotonous voice, the words indistinct. He glanced over his shoulder to see that the ceremony had started. The back of Maggie’s lilac head was bowed, and he sighed. “Fine. What’s their fireplace address? I’ll Floo over after the ceremony.”
“It’s only May?”
The Sixth-floor boy’s bathroom. The Astronomy Tower. The War Trials. His mother’s funeral. The scenes that played out behind Draco’s closed eyes every time he tried to sleep. It was strange and infuriating and
“We’re doing a whole raid on one business? Isn’t that a waste of resources?” Oh god, what was
“Hey,” Harry greeted, awkwardly coming to a stop by her side.
Harry swallowed and plastered on a polite smile. “No, never mind. It wasn’t urgent. I’ll catch him later.”
“It’ll take too long to explain,” he said. “Next time, I promise.”
That’s what she’d screamed at him at the end of their worst argument and Harry had told her everything he could think of: he couldn’t remember the last time they’d laughed but they yelled at each other four times a day; she hated that he wouldn’t talk about the war or his nightmares; they hadn’t had sex in five months; he’d forgotten their anniversary; they both constantly found reasons to stay late at work and even when they didn’t, their timetables never matched up; he hated the
reasonable court would issue any kind of punishment. The spells that concealed the magic side of the shop from the Muggle side were well-constructed and met all the codes in the Statute of Secrecy. There wasn’t a trace of magic in the Muggle front of the shop.
As the Healer got his wand out, he explained, “This is an exvoco potion, it can dissolve bonds between two people — often it’s used as an antidote for love potions, but it will work well here too. Once you’ve drunk it, I will remove the Taboo. It should all be over within a minute.”
“Ah, well, thanks all the same. Is, um, Malfoy still there? I’d like a word.”
“Where—” he asked as Harry gasped, “My bedroom’s across the hall.”
“I was just trying to make polite conversation. This is weird,” he said, gesturing between them.
Malfoy?” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “She might need both of us to work out what’s going on. Will you come?
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Don’t send him down the red carpet in jeans — but you’re getting really good at the whole Muggle-wizard mash-up thing. Remember when Blaise wore that shirt covered in mushrooms and a top hat to Greg’s restaurant? Compare
Hermione put her mug down and leant forward. Her voice took on a serious tone. “And if they’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve said I didn’t want her anywhere near me, but I was a bit addled by the pain to care who was doing what. And she was surprisingly good too, much better than the Healer. Pansy actually listened to me and whenever she did something, she told me exactly what was going to happen and why — the Healer just cast spells and didn’t say a word to me about anything. Don’t worry, though, I’m not going to be her best friend suddenly,” she reassured him quickly.
He gritted his teeth. He
. He had to rest a hand on Draco’s hip to steady himself as they broke apart for a moment, his eyes still closed, as they sucked in a few, ragged breaths — the only sound in the otherwise silent shop.
“This is a very weird conversation to walk back into,” Ron remarked as he and Ginny clattered back in, a little muddier than before.
“Very funny,” he said scathingly, summoning a stitch unpicker. “Where did you even learn those words?” The needle dropped to the table innocently.
A knock at the front door of Grimmauld Place roused him for the second time, but this time, the memory of the dream didn’t vanish. He could still feel the warmth of the Scottish sun on his skin and the press of Draco’s lips against his as he listened for any sign of Kreacher.
He glanced at her, frowning. “Why?”
He placed the tape measure just underneath Potter’s Adam’s apple, trying to keep his touch as light as possible as he looped the rest of the tape around his neck to take the measurement. His fingers were icy against the warmth of Potter’s skin and he could feel Harry’s pulse thrumming beneath his fingertips. The silence was so fraught with the inexplicable tension between the two men that it felt illicit to even speak and Draco felt wrong even whispering the measurement.
He didn’t judge Potter for it. After all, Draco had experienced similar flights of fancy before, given that there were many attractive men in London. For a while, Greg had worked with one of the most gorgeous men Draco had ever laid his eyes on, and he had spent many nights leaning against the bar, appreciating his dark curls and chiselled muscles. He was a Muggle, so it had obviously been a purely aesthetic appreciation and Draco had never acted on it — but he’d spent a few drunken nights rhapsodising with Millie and Pansy about his beauty.
He wanted to take two steps forward and close the distance between their bodies, but his feet were stuck to the floor. It was midday and between the sunshine and the ticking clock, everything felt too… Bright. Their physical relationship had been restricted to darkened shop corners and midnight trysts, and while he wasn’t about to assume he knew what went on in Draco’s head, it didn’t feel like the time or the place.

deserve to be loved. She saved the goddamn world and yet Draco had stood there for so long, waiting, thinking he was the only one left in the world who loved her as the downpour began.
Potter glared at him. “Oh right, of course, because you’re the poster child of humility and modesty.”
Harry did as he was told, dropping his head to his hands.
Draco sat back at his table, holding the coffee mug with both hands to warm his fingers as he tried to think of anything productive he could do. He’d already organised their fabrics by colour and material, ordered their fashion magazines by publication date, and straightened every tie on the shop floor with a ruler. He was running out of ideas.
He dropped his keys into the bowl by the door and pulled his robes off and kicked them into a corner of the entrance hall. He made it to the kitchen before doubling back and picking them back up, brushing away the dust bunnies with a sigh. He was being stupid. It wasn’t like he was going to need to wear them anymore — he could burn them and no one would bat an eyelash, but something stopped him and made him hang them neatly on the back of a dining chair.

“I’ve been pretty busy with these mirrors, sir. I judged it to be the priority given its urgency and the potential for harm.”
Unfortunately, the rest of the file couldn’t be mocked so easily. There were reports that talked about the weak barriers between the Muggle and wizarding sections of the shop; using magical methods to make Muggle clothes; Ms. Malkin’s anonymous backers and the only member of staff being a known ex-Death Eater. The file listed the various ties the Malfoy family had with cursed Muggle objects and a litany of raids at the Manor which had found them in possession of all sorts of hideous dark magic artefacts. Harry’s stomach clenched as he read about Draco Malfoy’s past crimes and proven relationship with Borgin & Burke’s.
He waited until the latch clicked before turning to Harry, arms crossed and a frown etching deep creases into his brow.
“Bloody hell, is that the time? Why are we awake?” he asked when he caught sight of the clock.
Draco walked over and squeezed his shoulder. “I know you didn’t.”
No wonder Ginny was acting weird about the mention of Malfoy. He’d forgotten
it read.
“Unfortunately, I have a meeting with the Department Heads so I can’t stay, as much as I’d like to.” When he next spoke, he lowered his voice. Gently, he said, “I can only imagine how you’re feeling right now, Harry. It’s difficult enough to admit that your life isn’t what you pictured it without being a public figure.”
“Hey mate, you busy?”
Speaking of.
The glare Draco directed at the door was so fierce Harry wondered if Maggie could
What the fuck. What the fucking fuck was he thinking.
“Is that it?” Pansy said.
She rolled her eyes. “And stop by at Peri’s on the way back?”
“What are
“There have been reports that Malfoy is breaking the Statute of Secrecy and performing magic in front of Muggles.”
He shrugged, his heart hammering. “Do you want to?”
“A month,” Hermione said.
a small, niggling voice pointed out.
“What’s
“Why are you being such a dick?” he asked, barely hearing his own words over the roaring in his ears.
“Whatever scheme you’ve got going on, whatever little
“Why are there so many fucking buttons?” he mumbled into Draco’s neck as he finally freed himself from the waistcoat onto get to the shirt underneath.
“So, why don’t you do that?” Pansy asked, about to step out into the street without a second glance.
So far away from the unrelenting life of the city, the stars twinkled brightly in the sky. Harry tilted his head back and picked out the constellations he remembered from astronomy — Cassiopeia reclining in the northern sky next to Ursa Major, Leo still visible but losing its race with the horizon. It was nothing compared to the night sky at Hogwarts, where Harry used to look out of the dormitory window and see a river of stars meandering across the sky above the Great Lake.

“She’s so proud of you getting on the team,” Harry said. “You should have heard her telling George’s new girlfriend all about you playing for England.”
and being helpful. The pile was so tall it was becoming unstable — threatening to collapse any day now. All Harry had to do was go through them and throw out the ones that had nothing relevant, maybe circle anything particularly interesting. That was it. But each time he considered making a start, his stomach would shrivel into a dense pit and he would suddenly think of a hundred other chores that he’d been putting off — like watering his tomatoes, or Vanishing the leaves out of all the gutters — and he dodged it for another day.
Harry’s stomach tightened uncomfortably. He didn’t like where this was heading.
“…Draco?” Pansy asked. “You alright?”
He could tolerate it.
“Yeah, of course I do,” Harry said.
they?
“Aw, she likes you,” Granger cooed.
Harry snorted. “I’m not Ron’s number one priority — you’re making it sound like I’m his bit on the side.”
“Morning,” Ron greeted through a yawn so wide Harry could have counted every single tooth if he’d wanted.
echoed through his head along with an angry bitterness because she
Maybe it was the combination of post-work out fatigue and sudden Apparition, but as he landed in the alleyway next to Malfoy’s shop, he was hit with another wave of vertigo, like the one in the coffee shop two days earlier. It was so strong he had to hold onto a wall for a moment to stay upright.
“Thanks Bill,” Harry said. “Really appreciate it.”
He put two fingers under Harry’s chin and lifted his head so he was staring up into Draco’s eyes.
“But-”
“I’ll get to work,” he sighed. “Unless there’s anything else, sir?”
Harry sighed again. “
Harry approached reverently. He put the bouquet he’d hurriedly bought from a twenty-four-hour Waitrose on Hermione’s bedside table as he peered over the blankets at the little face. She had Hermione’s dark skin and her eyes, as well as a little fuzz of black hair that peeked out from under the knitted pink hat she was wearing. She squinted up at Harry and burbled.
Her shrill voice, so out of place in the quiet solitude of Draco’s shop, was like a bucket of ice water, and cold, hard reality slowly seeped into his bones, weighing him down like cement.
Some of the confusion cleared from her face, but her forehead remained furrowed. “Hm. Yes. I remember you. The Malfoy boy, isn’t it?”
“Yeah. I do,” Draco agreed quietly. There had been a lot of people, it was impossible to remember everyone you’d hurt.
“You’re looking well,” he said.
Kingsley nodded, his face settling into a serious expression. The wrinkles in his forehead and around his eyes deepened, the only sign the man had aged since the war.
“Didn’t you make this woman’s robes, Maggie?” He tossed the paper down next to the coffee, pointing at the photo of the serial killer’s shell-shocked family arriving at the Wizengamot.
at his mercy. Like the time on the Hogwarts Express in Sixth Year, except that Potter wasn’t hexed, he was standing so still under Draco’s fingers by choice. Did he feel as vulnerable as Draco felt powerful in that moment?
“Well, tell them you don’t
“Please do, though I’m not sure
“They were okay, sir. Quite quiet, just caught up on some chores.”
“Like crap,” Harry said with a weak laugh. “I can’t drink like I used to.”
He glanced over, his eyes resting on Draco for the briefest of moments before returning to the floor. A fiery red blush had spread from his cheeks down his neck. Pansy elbowed him sharply in the side as Millie, Blaise, and Theo pelted Greg with questions about the girl.
“Underborough?” Potter guessed.
“That plan relies on me sticking around for a decade and you haven’t got me down the aisle yet.”
“Shouldn’t I be the one asking you that?” he said.
that she’s been in the shop several times in her capacity as a Carer and she witnessed Malfoy using magic in clear view of a Muggle street.”
Harry snorted and, before he left, stepped up to Draco and kissed him dirty and quick, leaving Draco breathless before he strode out. Draco waited in the dark, panting, until he heard the telltale sound of an Apparition at which point he closed the doors and finally went to bed.
,” he muttered, tapping the parchment with his wand and creating a copy of the design next to it. He slipped it into an envelope along with a note.
“Keep an eye on the door for a moment, will you?” he asked and began to charm his shirt clean.
“See what?”
“Oh, right. Normal. Good,” Harry said.
“You’re very insistent,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “Maybe a bit
Blankly, he stared at the invite, trying to decipher the words on the card as his thoughts emptied from his brain like water down a drain.
“There are a few possibilities,” Granger said.
“Were you there when they actually caught him?”
“See you ‘round, Potter,” she said, and headed off down a corridor without waiting for Harry’s reply.
“Because of what you said in the alley after the raid,” Harry said. “About me following orders, even when I knew they were wrong. I didn’t want to do that anymore. Also, I fucking
The next morning, he went to work with a sense of purpose he hadn’t felt in years. He waved at Belinda in the corridor but skipped his usual trip to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee and sat straight down at his desk, grabbing a blank MLEP enquiry form which folded itself into a paper aeroplane and zoomed away when Harry pointed his wand at it.
“Yeah, I want it to be,” he said.
“Christ,” Harry cried into Draco’s shoulder as he thrust again, lifting his head up slightly to kiss Draco’s clavicle. Draco grasped a handful of his long hair, tugging it sharply. Harry groaned and let Draco pull him up for a kiss as his hand skimmed down Harry’s ribs and against the hard abs he’d felt through three layers of dress robes. There was hardly any space between their bodies, which made it difficult for him to get a hand around Harry’s cock.
moaned into the pillow, muffled by the fabric until they might as well not have been words.
Still, he was relieved when Maggie’s father stood up and thanked everyone for coming. Quiet murmurs rippled through the crowd, and people sidled gradually into the aisles, stopping to talk and mingle with other guests.
his problems for this very reason!
“Oh. It’s really not that kind of party,” Harry said hurriedly.
They walked back towards Harry’s as Rolf explained the mating rituals of yetis (confusing and, frankly, terrifying) and imitated some of their grunting calls, attracting strange looks from passersby. Ten minutes away from Grimmauld Place, the other two left Harry to browse an outdoor shop for some cross-country skis.
“So you say. And, anyway, I was going to tailor all of these to make them look less like something Granny would sell.” She pointed to the enormous stack of robes. “Oh! That’s right, I have a bone to pick with you — why did your charmed needle embroider boobs instead of flowers onto my robes? It’s not funny, Draco, I wore them out on a date! Stop
“Do you not get Ministry-supplied shirts then?” he asked.
“Did he? I dunno, I didn’t really hear anything — it wipes my brain for a moment.”
It was Draco’s pet project in the shop since he had started working there; originally, customers buying dress robes were measured and fitted in the front of the shop, along with the general public because that was how Madam Malkin did it and Maggie, despite all her bluffing about independence, still followed her grandmother’s example. It took Draco months to convince Maggie that they should create a partition, specifically for dress robes, to make getting robes for a special occasion feel like a special occasion in itself. She agreed when Draco had said they could use furniture from the Manor to cut costs.
He ran his tongue down Harry’s neck, kissing and sucking the skin, leaving faint marks behind as he continued down and down. Harry’s hands fisted in Draco’s hair and he gasped, arching his back off the bed, as Draco ran his tongue across the length of his cock.
“Sure he wasn’t secretly involved?” She was smiling but there was a steeliness to her tone that belied the joke.
He opened the first file and picked up his quill.
“Is it true? What Malfoy said?”
Draco shrugged. “That’s good to hear. For my ego, you know.”
“What do you mean?” he asked.
, though? Draco’s lips were soft and smooth, and his breath was sweet as he sighed. Every part of Harry felt electric and he yearned in a way he hadn’t felt in years, his body begging for
Remembering their last conversation just made Harry’s frown deepen. He’d yet to hear back from MLEP about the situation with the wizard they’d arrested and he hadn’t had time to walk down to their offices himself now that the team was one person down.
He snorted and wrapped his arms around Harry’s chest to adjust the hang of the outer robe, pulling it open a little way and- yep, fucking hell, there was a definite bulge in the front of Harry’s trousers that hadn’t been there before and he watched Malfoy’s eyes flicking down in the mirror.
He’d certainly run away quick enough afterwards for Draco to assume that he did, but then again, he’d been the one to drop to his knees... Draco didn’t suggest that. Although, on the other hand, Potter had waited until the middle of the night where there were no chances of witnesses, which was very much the time and place for doing things one would later regret.
Ambrose wandered into the room and joined the group of Harry’s admirers — his strong Aussie accent was particularly at odds with the gloomy London morning. “Morning, what are we… You had a haircut, Harry?”
“Hey Mags,” Draco said softly, gripping her elbow and squeezing gently. “How are you?”
Ambrose snorted. “There’s been a tip off about a business breaking the Statute of Secrecy and the Muggle Protection Act.”
was not a sensible thing to think about when he was hot and naked and agitated, but his drunken brain latched onto the thought. He blinked and the same memories that had been distracting him all week flickered behind his eyes (his hands on Potter’s waist, the broadness of his chest when he fell into Draco, how he looked in his underwear) except now with new material from tonight. Potter, flushed and sweaty. Earlier, he’d been indignant and angry but Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Potter in bed, lying next to Draco, just as flustered but this time with hair mussed and a line of bruises from his collarbone to his jaw, put there by Draco.
Ginny frowned at him. “Do you even want to be Head Auror? Not even now, but ever?”
“I’d be a fool to take that bet.”
At first, Draco had taken Maggie’s innocence about the war as purposeful ignorance but over the years he’d come to realise that she
Some nights they would stay up late drinking red wine and Hermione would explain to them Muggle card games that the Dursley’s had never played. Ron would then teach them the magical variation, and they’d create some kind of hybrid of the two, making up increasingly ridiculous rules. Harry would end up crashing in their spare bedroom.
“The wedding’s planned for summer in two years,” Draco said, and McGonagall tutted and shook her head regretfully.
They kissed until Draco’s lips were swollen, and his chin and cheeks were raw from the abrasion of Harry’s stubble, and he was dizzy with desire. Harry was pliant under Draco’s hands, letting him roll them over so Draco was now straddling him, pressing him down into the mattress.
“No,” Harry interrupted, “this isn’t me throwing my toys out of the pram because I didn’t get what I wanted. What we did was
“There’s no story,” he muttered.
Malfoy said nothing. He handed Harry the garments he’d removed, and Harry rushed to dress himself, finding a comforting protection in each layer he added. He pulled the outer robe on with a sigh of relief, adjusting it so it hung mostly closed, obscuring his crotch.
He jumped up and down a couple of times to demonstrate his
“We’re off, Harry,” Belinda announced, making him jump. “Are you coming?”
“How’d that go?”

, save me from men. Utterly useless, the lot of you! Fuck, is that the time?”
He stopped talking, relentlessly pulling up handfuls of grass like a bored child. He forced himself to still as he remembered where he was. He pulled his knees to his chest, hugging his calves, and tilted his head up to the sky.
“The others will be missing us,” he murmured, but didn’t move.
Harry glared at the fireplace. “This is different.”
Making robes.
“What?” he muttered.
“He’s not,” Pansy said. She was sitting on the other end of the table, perched on the edge of the picnic bench next to Hermione, and had to shout to be part of their conversation. “He’s a fan of Sex On The—”
“Fuck, I can’t believe we’ve both been moping over
the files into his hands after giving his office a cursory search and not immediately finding them. They shot out from under a pile of napkins, toppling them from the filing cabinet like a landslide. He sighed and swivelled his chair so he didn’t have to look at the new mess — he’d clean it up before he left. Maybe.
He didn’t care that Potter hadn’t called — it had just been a bit of fun with an attractive man. Draco wasn’t a stranger to that: he had many notches in his own bedpost. Perhaps he and Potter were using each other for nothing more than a good time. He’d be the first to admit that they made a surprising pair, but if the sex was good and no one found out, who cared? After all, Potter had a surprisingly nice mouth when it was being put to other uses.
,” he muttered, watching the skin knit itself back together.
“Not really? I have new robes, is that it?”
“Well, you’d probably be the most overqualified Groundskeeper Hogwarts has ever had. Certainly, we’ve never had an applicant come along with a letter of recommendation from the Minister of Magic before.”
“How did you know I was here?” Draco asked. “Are you having me followed or something?”
“Don’t tempt me,” Ginny said darkly, her tone at odds with her expression as she made kissy faces at Rose. “I think Alicia might beat me to the punch if he asks her out one more time, to be honest.”
“I’m going to write to him,” Draco said stubbornly. “I’ll still do the accounts, though. If I leave them with you, the Auror Office will be the least of our worries.”
Harry already knew the spells (he wasn’t a virgin, of course he knew the charms) and he was eager to learn what he didn’t know.
“But…” Harry protested.
He’d probably stunk of the crup kennels he’d been working at, but Maggie hadn’t asked about it. She’d simply inspected his work and then asked, “Are you any good at transfiguration? I need some mannequins but I can’t manage more than a collection of arms and I don’t think displaying the robes on some sort of eldritch horror is going to entice people.”
“Yeah…” Harry sighed. No one said anything as they exchanged loaded glances, apparently conducting an entire conversation through their eyebrows. Harry grimaced.
“Yeah,” Draco said roughly, dragging a hand over his face. “Just…” he trailed off, not knowing where to begin with the bubbling, burning anger that roiled in his gut. It all focused on one person in particular.
“Get everything?” he asked.
Then again, it was apparently only Potter who was being pulled around by the strings of fate. Draco hadn’t ever got an ‘urge’ to show up on Potter’s doorstep in the middle of the night, so maybe the love spell
Draco scanned the crowds of Muggles to see if Theo had gotten waylaid on his way back to the table, but he couldn’t see him. Blaise clocked on to their worries.
Harry hoped the combination of the dim room and his dark skin masked his blush.
Despite Draco’s pleas, he and Harry were members of the latter group.

discount or anything.”
“Can’t get the bloody thing off the wall,” he said, coming to stand beside Draco.
Malfoy had a small smile on his face, which morphed into something slightly less cheerful and more sinister as he stalked back to where Harry lurked.
He went home that night with his pockets full of seed packets that Neville recommended in the gift shop — with pointed comments about how they were
“Potter, of course. Don’t know why he—”
Any pretence of decorum had gone, along with any ability to form coherent thoughts. Only a few words remained that fell from Draco’s tongue without conscious thought. Words like
He’d been having
“Does that happen often?” His expression was flat and unreadable.
“I thought you weren’t a fan of Mai Tais, Draco?” Blaise asked as he walked over to an empty chair between Millie and Luna. Harry headed around to Ron’s vacant seat next to Hermione.
