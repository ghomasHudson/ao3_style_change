Malfoy had seemed. And that had infuriated him. So, he had picked a fight. And another one. And another one. And another one. And, eventually, it had become a habit.
“You shouldn’t have. I mean, look at this.” He dropped Draco’s hands gently and ran a finger across one of the lines, as a tear rolled down his cheek. “You shouldn’t forgive me for
Harry wanted to say yes, he really did, but his throat wouldn’t let anything come out except for a short sob that he regretted instantly.
Draco smiled proudly and Harry laughed, unable to help himself at the ridiculousness of the story. “Well, that’s definitely a different take on why the two fell out.”
“And this way, we can see the new common room.” Blaise said as he looked around, his eyes darting across every inch of the room until they found Harry. Pansy seemed to notice Harry at the same time, too, because she stopped smiling.
Malfoy exhaled sharply. “You seriously can’t go one minute without fighting with me.” He shook his head. “You’re insufferable.” He turned his gaze away from Harry, but something changed in his expression.
He moved his hand until it was in Draco’s hair, feeling Draco relax into the touch. He moved his fingers in his hair, smiling at how soft it was.
Ron and Hermione both spoke at the same time again, and Harry couldn’t make out a word either of them said.
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I had some paperwork to do.” He got up from his table and went behind the counter.
Hermione grinned. “It’s the fright of it. I only know a couple from when I was younger, but they scared the shit out of my friends when I was little. Of course, I was already fairly certain something was wrong with me at this point, what with all the magic I was doing, so it didn’t bother me as much. Do you want to hear one of them?” Her grin widened and Harry realised he hadn’t seen her like this in a while. She was… back to her old self… sort of. None of them could really go back, but it was nice for a while, at least.
Harry laughed. “I only just hired them, I’m not going to leave them with the shop while I go away for a week.”
Draco exhaled heavily and walked over to Harry with purpose, so Harry met him in the middle, melting into him as they held each other. They kissed each other hard, but it wasn’t heated. It was beautiful and sweet and Harry thought he could stay like this forever.
Everyone looked rather amused at the idea, but they all got changed nonetheless, taking it in turns to use the Gryffindors’ dorm rooms. When they all came back together, Harry found himself smiling at the Slytherins’ pyjamas.
“No, they haven’t, mate.” Ron’s face was full of concern as he spoke. “They speak about you being… you know… into guys. And they say it like its a bad thing.”
Harry wondered if Draco would ask for a favour eventually, but he inwardly shook the thought out of his head. He shouldn’t want Draco to ask for a favour. He
Harry smiled. He wondered if this was a good idea, but he didn’t have a choice and he was sure that, if Draco had changed, Theo probably had, too.
, Hermione.” He fiddled with the blank parchment in front of him, curling up the corners of it and flattening them out again.
He, Ron and Hermione were quietly studying in the eighth year common room. Well, actually, Hermione was quietly studying, whilst Harry and Ron had been staring at their books for about an hour, just waiting for Hermione to let them leave.
at least, but nothing came out of his mouth. All he could do was stare in silence. And, god, was there something to stare at. The most obvious being Malfoy’s face. The face that Harry had seen every day for seven years in a row. The face he hadn’t seen since the trials six years ago. The face that he had fought with and insulted and hated and cut open and watched as it was sewn back together. The face that he was used to. And now… the face that he had scarred.
He saw Draco roll his eyes at how much of a pushover he was, but Harry didn’t care. The Slytherin common room was actually a rather nice place to be, and he was definitely tipsy already.
He was making a sweet drink this time, something resembling the colour and flavour of a red velvet cake, although he had adapted the recipe slightly over the years, adding a double shot of espresso for Malfoy’s night shift.
“Draco had already asked me. We’re really good friends.” She said. “And it was still new. But, now… Now, it’s official, I suppose.”
Draco sighed, moving around slightly and reaching for his wand. “The best laid plans, Harry.” He turned on a lamp, giving the room a bit of light.
The days were long and it was sometimes difficult to keep the cafe afloat, but he adapted - he would stock ice cream in the summer, sell dozens of hot chocolate flavours in the winter, and spring and autumn were filled with as many pastries as he could find. He was happy here. His life was conflict-free and calm and his adoring fans honestly didn’t bother him too much anymore. Sometimes he wondered if he had made a mistake choosing this life. He had offers from the Ministry in every department, and McGonagall had offered him a job as a Quidditch Professor, but he hadn’t been interested. He wanted peace, and chasing down criminals or children was not the way to get it.
“Starting next week, classes will no longer be taught to single houses. Your new timetables will be provided at the end of this week, and your new lessons will be mixed with people from every house.”
“Fine, there are some downsides. But we both need this. And, if the world knows I’ve forgiven you, maybe they’ll start to forgive you, too.”
So, when he was eventually there, in France, standing outside of Draco’s door and breathing heavily through the anxiety, he was grinning. He was grinning so much that his face was beginning to hurt. But it didn’t matter. Nothing did. Nothing except -
“It’s Hermione and Ron.” Hermione’s voice was dripping with concern and Harry let out another sob at the sound of it, muting it with his hand.
“You seemed to panic, after you said you liked men and women. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. Besides, Potter, didn’t you know? We’re dating.”
Harry cried as they held and comforted him. He tried to warn them, tried to tell them that they didn’t know the whole story, but they waved him off and said, “we don’t need to, Harry. We love you” which made him cry even more. As he sat sandwiched in between his two best friends in the whole world, he realised nothing could ever be too bad if they were there. This was awful, but so was everything else he had endured in his short lifetime, and Ron and Hermione were always there to help him through it.
And that's As Real As We Are finished!! Thank you SO much for reading and commenting and giving kudos - it's meant the world to me! My tumblr is @redthoughtsblog feel free to message me about the fic or about anything really! Hope you enjoyed!!! <3
He heard Seamus’ laughter, reaching him from a few seats down. He rolled his eyes. Even the Gryffindors were talking about it.
Harry laughed, crossing off the Black name as Draco spoke, and writing a note next to the Malfoy name that simply said, ‘Lucius’.
“Oh, no, it’s fine. We’re basically ready, anyway. Ron’s just finishing up. So, Draco, how is it to be back in Britain after all this time?”
He found it hard to focus on any of that, however, because Draco’s hair was so soft on Harry’s face and Draco seemed to have decided that his hands weren’t sufficiently occupied, because he had started tracing the lines of one of the snitches on Harry’s pyjamas trousers, tickling Harry’s knee in such a relaxing way. Harry had noticed that Draco was affectionate with his friends - he supposed that he, Pansy and Blaise were all very affectionate people - he had just never expected to be one of the people that Draco felt he could be affectionate towards. And he had never expected it to feel this right.
Harry felt a twinge of guilt again, and he looked Draco in the eyes, his words sincere. “You didn’t have to do that.”
Malfoy’s friends were there, too, of course. They had all arrived separately, walking in with smirks on their faces and joining each other on the dancefloor. Luna was dancing with them, with all of the Slytherins, as though the war had never happened. She was dancing with
He spent the rest of the day waiting impatiently for the Ministry owl to arrive. When the owl finally came to his window, he was pleased to find a very detailed piece of parchment from Kingsley Shacklebolt himself, explaining and confirming the ins and outs of the transference of assets.
He tried to focus on his own work, staring at the parchment until his eyes hurt, but it was no use. He gave up with a dejected sigh and decided he would much rather people-watch. He looked around, watching as his fellow Gryffindor students worked or read or laughed around him. He stared at the door for a while, seeing who was arriving and leaving. He looked across the room, where the Slytherins usually sat, and watched Malfoy as he laughed with Parkinson and Zabini.
So, Harry stood up, holding onto his bed for support, before making his way into the hallway. He knew that Molly had made up a room for the Slytherins, right beside where Harry and Ron and Hermione were sleeping. He also knew that Pansy was in Ginny’s room tonight, and Blaise was still in the living room with Charlie, his soft laughs travelling up to Harry’s ears. Which meant that Draco was alone in his room. And Harry
“Finish you dessert, Harry.” He said with such a firm tone that Harry had no choice but to oblige. He was so busy picking up his fork that he barely even registered how
Harry’s eyes widened and his heart sped up. Draco was avoiding his gaze, a blush on his cheeks. Harry could feel Pansy’s triumph coming from beside him, but all he could focus on was trying to breathe through this new information.
He saw two men in the mirror, one in a black suit, the other in a light blue suit, both across from each other, as Harry and Malfoy were. As Harry moved, the man moved with him and Harry was sure he was going insane. He was sure of this, because, although the man in the mirror should be Harry, it…
But, he thought to himself as he heard a muttered hex fly from the Gryffindor table, that didn’t change the fact that inter-house conflict was at an all time high, and no one had any idea how to stop it.
After a while, they all went down to dinner, each going to their separate tables, and promising to return back to the Gryffindor common room when they were done. They were all still in their pyjamas, and Harry heard people murmuring about it, but none of them seemed to mind. After fighting in a war, their reputation in school wasn’t the most important thing on each of their minds.
She shook her head. “Sorry. I just meant… Everyone’s been struggling since the war. You didn’t have to hide it.”
Harry asked himself as his heart started beating considerably faster and he felt his hands shake slightly.
“So,” Draco said, between kisses as he toed his shoes off, “I thought you should know, I will be looking stunning tonight, so you should dress nice.”
Harry somehow managed to breathe a sigh of relief and have all the wind knocked out of his chest at the same time as he took in the sight. Malfoy was also wearing a suit, thank god, and he looked better than words could describe. His suit was light blue and fitted him perfectly, and his tie was grey and embellished with little blue flowers to match the jacket. It was delicate, and beautiful, and,
He was about to ask Hermione, but McGonagall let her gaze travel across the room, from Harry to Malfoy. She started speaking again, pointedly looking at the both of them.
Ron mentioned the war once, talking about how crime rates increased afterwards, but he laughed it off and said his work felt boring now in comparison. All things considered, Harry had a pretty good time. No arguments were started, no punches were thrown, and he and Draco left with smiles on their faces, promising to come back for another breakfast-dinner in the near future.
Luna beamed at Harry when she saw him. She was curled up on an armchair with a book, but quickly put the book down when she saw Harry approaching.
distracted. He was looking at Malfoy as he put down his notebook. He watched as he removed his jumper in the glaring heat, shaking his hair slightly as he pulled the jumper off. His eyes flicked down to the area of his pale chest that was exposed when his shirt lifted up as the jumper did. And his eyes widened at the sight.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “At least take a fucking day off. I know my company is excellent, but surely you have better things to do than sitting here with me all night.”
Harry decided not to think too much about this. They might as well have fun this year, considering all their other years at Hogwarts were so terrible. And, if having fun like this felt this good and kept girls from following Harry around, it couldn’t be so bad.
“Well, she’ll only be allowed her assets for as long as he is imprisoned, I’m afraid there’s nothing I’ll be able to do afterwards.”
He hadn’t talked to Draco in days; he had tried calling him again and again, but eventually his mother answered and told Harry that he didn’t feel like talking. He was considering going to the Manor so Draco had no choice but to talk to him, but he knew that was unfair. He felt so helpless and he didn’t know how to fix it.
Harry had told Ron and Hermione everything about the Dursleys. They had been as supportive as ever, but he had never told anyone else. He found it odd, but he wanted to tell Draco. He wanted him to know, for some reason.
After a while of dancing, Malfoy finally left the group to go to the drinks table. Harry was planning to follow him, ready to interrogate him. But, as soon as he started making his way over, he found himself being squeezed tightly by Luna.
A silence washed over the room and Draco shifted closer to Harry, not by much, but enough that Harry noticed. Draco rolled his eyes and looked at the boy who had asked the question. “You did ask, didn’t you?"
Harry was in the Slytherin common room, as he usually was nowadays, when Luna showed up. She came in, calling Draco’s name and frowning at a piece of parchment. The four of them (Harry, Draco, Pansy and Blaise) were sitting around the fireplace and Blaise was telling them about his summer in Spain, from which he had come back with quite a few stories, a
Harry didn’t know what to do. His hands were still pinning Malfoy’s shoulders to the wall, and Malfoy’s finger was still pressed against Harry’s lips. Harry finally looked back to the blonde, looking into his eyes with shock. Except, Malfoy’s eyes were still on Harry’s lips. And, for a split-second, Harry thought he was going to kiss him again.
Harry spent the next week in his room. He went to classes, of course, but he never showed his face in the Great Hall, or anywhere else, for that matter. Hermione and Ron would knock on his door and give him a bundle of food to keep him going before asking if he needed anything and leaving when he said no. Hermione completed his homework for him without asking, and Ron would come up to his room at lunch sometimes with a game or some sweets. He was extremely grateful for them, but he could only focus on what he had lost.
And Harry tried to say yes, he really did, but he was sure it was a lie, and all that came out was, “I don’t know.”
Harry was explaining this in a letter to Draco, writing what he couldn’t say out loud. His writing was awful and he knew Draco would comment on it, as he always did. They had been talking on the phone every day (a muggle practice which Draco was surprisingly familiar with) and regularly writing letters to each other, but Harry was still missing Draco terribly. He had thought the space from him would be good for him and would allow him to clear his head slightly, but all it was doing was making him realise how much he was in love. He had just finished signing the bottom of the letter when Ron burst into their room.
Harry grabbed Draco’s cock through his trousers as Draco licked his way back up to Harry’s mouth, kissing him until their lips were numb, until Harry’s hand moved so fast he could barely feel it anymore, until Draco came on Harry, moaning his name. Only then did Draco roll off of Harry, laughing breathlessly.
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry too much about the plan, Harry. When have your plans ever worked out, anyway?”
Neville looked startled. “Not really.” He sighed, the Veritaserum clearly already working. “Why me?”
To the rest of the world, Harry and Draco were still just friends - and Harry supposed they really were friends now, just enjoying each other’s company, rather than pretending to like each other - but Hogwarts had definitely picked up on the fact that they weren’t so keen on using their last names anymore. Hermione and Ron had asked Harry about Malfoy quite a lot, but after a while of Harry’s short replies, they decided to steer clear of the subject. He hated lying to them.
Harry smiled at his words. There was a silent rebellion in them. Something that said that they really
Ginny leaned down, placed a rather chaste kiss on Pansy’s lips, and pulled away, her hair falling in front of her face as she murmured, “Still bored?”
Harry sighed, but opened his eyes nonetheless. He frowned when he realised that he was, in fact, lying on a person, and that person was Draco. He sat up carefully, making sure not to wake him, and realised that he couldn’t move his legs. He looked down to see Ron sleeping peacefully, his head resting on Harry’s legs.
Draco opened his mouth, looking ready to protest, but instead he sighed and looked down at his feet. “Fine. Yes, I am running away.”
Everyone in the room smiled and nodded, murmuring about how they were in need of one of these before everyone else returned to school. Harry agreed, of course, but it was difficult for him to say much else, because Draco’s hand had found its way onto Harry’s knee and he was tracing patterns onto his jeans.
Sam shoved Harry out from behind the counter. “Don’t worry about it.” They said, a sweet smile on their face. “I’ll make you both a drink. Decaf, Harry?”
Harry saw it coming from a mile off. He saw Sam’s smug face and watched as Malfoy smirked at Harry. He saw his smirk turn into Malfoy trying to hold back a laugh. He heard the mischief in Malfoy’s voice as he said, “Ah, yes, I do apologise. You see, I couldn’t tell you the truth, because Potter told me not to.” Harry sighed deeply. “What
Draco yawned and seemed to sink further into the sofa, his hand still moving lightly on Harry’s knee. “Let’s do it in the Gryffindor common room tonight.”
Whilst writing this, I realised that we never actually see Hermione receiving a Weasley jumper, which I thought was crazy!
Everyone else was, too, of course. The Veritaserum seemed to be challenging them all. The truth was mere inches away at any given moment and it was intoxicatingly exhilarating. They were all killing time, really. Just waiting for the potion to wear off. None of them were out for blood tonight - not even Pansy. They were all content simply laughing and breathing together.
She started turning off the lights around them with a flick of her wand, one by one, until only the fire was spilling light onto the floor in front of them. Harry could have sworn he heard Draco hold his breath.
Harry woke up to the sound of Pansy and Hermione laughing quietly. In the back of his mind, he registered that something heavy was on his legs, and that he was lying on something
Harry smiled. “They’re looking forward to it.” It wasn’t a lie, really. Ron and Hermione really were looking forward to it. It’s just the others were… apprehensive. “Listen, don’t worry too much about it. They’re all nice people. And they’ve all forgiven you.”
Malfoy laughed. “Depends on who I’m speaking to. Sometimes, it was a witch who put a curse on me as a baby because my father had betrayed her. Or it’s Voldemort’s punishment for me after the war. Oh, or it’s one of those situations where I make a new line every time I kill someone - that one always goes down well.”
Seamus caught Dean’s eye and gestured for him to come over. He spoke as Dean grinned and got up. “Well, I saw that you had come out, and I thought, if the bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World can admit it, why can’t I?” He spoke quickly, as usual. “So, I told Dean I’m gay, and he said that he’d been into me for a while now and, well, I suppose the rest is history.”
McGonagall was not happy, and Harry realised just how fucking stupid the house system really was. One dance between teenagers had reignited a rivalry that was as brutal as ever. Harry would walk into the Gryffindor common room and find no Slytherins in sight. After the war, most houses mixed into other dorms, and the passwords were basically redundant. But now, the common room was quieter than normal, much more hostile, and the passwords were changed twice a week. He hated it.
Harry wanted to ask him how he knew it was normal, how he knew he’d be okay, but he suddenly realised just how close they were to each other. They usually sat across from each other during the day, but Harry had switched seats so that Malfoy could better explain their potions homework to him. He supposed, in the many hours since he had moved next to him, they had just kept on moving in closer, adjusting their seats to lean in to each other’s voices.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up as he busied himself with another recipe he was rather fond of. “You’re working here?”
Hermione smirked and Harry knew she knew the real reason why he had come early. Thankfully, she seemed to be in a generous mood because she said, “Well, the place looks fantastic”, and handed Draco a bottle of Firewhiskey. “For the host.” She said with a grin.
They sat there for a while, talking about muggle ghost stories, discussing muggles’ grasp on magic. Hermione was even bold enough to talk about the politics behind it. Harry saw the challenge in her eyes, the slight crease between her brows that proved she was sussing the Slytherins out. But, the three Slytherins nodded along enthusiastically.
Harry winced. “When asked to elaborate further on his use of the word ‘abomination’, Mr Malfoy said, ‘Finding out your son is -” Harry took a deep breath, “- perverted. It’s worse than Azkaban.’”
“Harry, you look like a madman.” Draco said, his lips quirking up slightly as he steadied himself from the impact.
Draco smirked. “So, are you going to tell me why you’re here, or are you just going to walk in circles around my room?”
Malfoy seemed to try for a small smile for a moment, although it didn’t reach his eyes. “So, you’re going stag?” Malfoy asked, stretching his back slightly and sighing.
Malfoy sighed but started leading Harry, anyway, turning him around as he went. Harry was an awful dancer sober and after a few drinks he was even clumsier, but every time he stumbled, Malfoy tightened his grip on his waist and kept him upright.
Harry tried to stop his face from heating up, but he failed. He had a good time, but his hangxiety was making it hard to remember the fun of it. “What about last night?” He asked weakly.
Harry nodded, grabbed Draco’s hand and led the way, squeezing his hand in support as they walked to the Great Hall. Ron and Hermione followed, although Harry could practically hear their stunned silence behind him.
know how rough you must be feeling today.” She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small vial. “This is a hangover potion. Which I will give you if you tell me what you’re up to.”
Even after he went back into the castle, even after he had fallen asleep, all he could think of was that stag on Malfoy’s stomach.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t been expecting Draco to ask about that. “Umm… not really. I mean, we’re friends. And it never felt… right… when we were together.” Harry decidedly stopped himself from thinking that
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione’s voice was gentle and she squeezed his arm slightly. “I don’t think he has much choice in the matter.”
Harry laughed and dragged himself up, stretching once more and shimmying out of bed as Draco gracefully slid out. Harry would roll his eyes in frustration at the bastard’s elegance if he didn’t find it so bloody attractive.
Harry smiled at that, and they both lay in silence for a while before making their way to the tea room, which was where, Draco informed him, he and his mother usually ate breakfast.
Draco sighed and tightened his hold on Harry. When he spoke, his voice was barely a whisper. “I know, Harry.” He pulled away, but stayed close to Harry, wiping the tears off from Harry’s cheek.
He opened his eyes slowly, trying to remember where exactly he was. He had had rather a lot to drink the night before and his memory was a little fuzzy at the moment. He lifted his head slightly, but realised that was too much for him, and let it fall back down as he closed his eyes again, frowning as he did so. Yes, he was definitely lying on a person.
Draco looked almost touched at Hermione’s concern for him, but Harry watched as he schooled his features back into that of indifference. “It doesn’t really bother me. I get much worse on the street, anyway.”
They were all rather drunk by the time it was Pansy’s turn again. Harry was two drinks away from passing out and Draco seemed to be swaying closer to him whenever he spoke, his face softer and smiling more than usual. Although, Harry supposed Draco did smile quite a lot, anyway.
Draco still came into the coffee shop, asking Harry to surprise him, but they mostly met up outside of work, instead opting to make dinner at home and watching a movie, or going out to a restaurant and rushing home to undress each other. Of course, it wasn’t all easy. They both still had nightmares and sometimes Harry would come home to find Draco curled up on his bedroom floor crying. But, they worked through it together. Harry found it easier to talk about the war with Draco. He didn’t have to explain everything - they had both been there - but he was still an outside perspective that Harry was in desperate need of.
Harry nodded along, but his mind was elsewhere. He couldn’t believe he had just outed himself. His eyes were darting all around him and he couldn’t keep his hands from shaking.
Harry breathed himself out of his laughter. “Yes. Sorry.” He said. “I’ve got to… Someone just called in a favour.”
“Where the fuck did you get Veritaserum?” Harry asked Draco quietly as the Firewhiskey was passed around.
I know the use of the phone makes it seem like this is set now, but it's not! It's set in the late 90s so its a bit of an older phone!
Hermione must have seen the look on Harry’s face, because she touched his arm gently and spoke again. “Listen, Harry, you and Malfoy have a… complicated relationship, to say the least. And, a lot of studies show that personal connections can influence magical connections. There could be a dozen magical reasons for your dreams. So… give me a day or two and I’ll let you know what I find.”
“I’m mentally preparing myself for the Burrow.” She said, clearing her throat. “Do they know about Ginny and I?”
the meet cute.” Malfoy said, his voice thick with sarcasm, as per usual. “Although, I think my family imprisoning you was rather dramatic.”
There was a pause where Draco frowned and opened his mouth to speak again, but Harry knew what his next question was going to be, so he spoke quickly before the word, ‘why’ could leave Draco’s lips. “I was almost sorted into Slytherin, you know.”
Harry nodded. “Don’t you find that strange at all? McGonagall’s forcing us to go with someone from another house - that’s odd, don’t you think?”
They continued to play never have I ever for a little while longer, and Harry came to learn that Draco had had quite a few memorable experiences when it came to sex.
He looked at her in silence for a few moments. He swallowed and closed his eyes for a second, then took a deep breath. “Well… I have been. Hiding it.” He looked at Harry again. “It’s been… more difficult than it seems. I’m not happy.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Shut up, it’s a good present, but I have to tell you what it is before you get it.”
“So?” Harry asked as they sat down at the Gryffindor table, his voice hopeful. “What do you think of them?”
It hurt that the first person he had ever truly loved like this, in this way, was leaving him. And he couldn’t do anything about it. He couldn’t fix it.
Pansy’s smile grew. “Excellent.” She tapped her finger against her chin in thought, but Harry was sure she already had a question prepared. “Hmm… Who in this room have you fantasised about?”
Sam rolled their eyes. “I read the fucking papers, you idiot. I know some of it. And I’m telling you it doesn’t matter.”
The four of them smiled in agreement, but Ron rolled his eyes. “You’re only saying that because you’re getting a shag out of it.”
As Draco kissed Harry, his breath sweet from the vodka lemonade and his touch eager, Harry couldn’t help but notice how amazing he felt in this moment. He was truly happy, which seemed almost foreign to him after the years he’d had. The alcohol had left his vision blurred and Draco’s hands on him feeling delightful. He was surrounded by people he genuinely cared about, and he felt safe for the first time in a long time.
He and Sam eventually waved Malfoy off to work before closing up and Harry dreaded what Sam would say tomorrow. Harry knew they knew.
The third time, Harry was interrupted yet again. He had managed to get out the words, “I need to ask you about -”, when Malfoy’s friends had yanked him away, laughing.
“I have hangover potions in my desk.” He murmured, still half asleep and making no move to actually go get the potions.
Harry was sure he had never heard Malfoy say that to him before, so he took a large gulp of his drink and said quietly, “No problem.”
Harry smiled. “Yeah, I suppose it has.” He thought about it for a moment. “I don’t travel much. You know, I have to stay here to keep this place open, and I never went on holidays when I was younger.”
“You should be on holiday or something, Potter. You need a break. Or at least a day off, for fuck’s sake.”
“So, why did Pansy decide I would be the first Gryffindor invited to the top secret game night?” Harry smiled as he spoke.
They worked all the way up until dinner, when they eventually decided to call it a day and pack up. They made their way to the great hall together, brainstorming ways to bring an end to the Sacred 28 (although, many of Draco’s ideas involved violence), and sat down at the Gryffindor table with their friends.
“Okay, no questions asked.” She said, sitting down next to him and ignoring the whistles that were surrounding them as she picked up a piece of toast.
At dinner, Harry made sure to glance at Malfoy regularly enough that Hermione and Ron jumped in, their voices quiet.
have a strong connection. I mean, you’ve saved each other’s lives a dozen times, you can use each other’s wands as though they’re your own, and I’m sure you both know each other rather well after seven years of fighting!”
Oh god, Harry hadn’t been listening, but Malfoy was looking at him with a strange look in his eye so Harry smiled and nodded, hoping he hadn’t just been asked a question. There was a short silence, which concerned Harry, but he cleared his throat and asked, “So, can I get you anything? Or did you just drop by to say hi?”
“It’s okay. I could do with the fresh air, anyway.” Draco smiled and put some money down on the table.
“Honestly, they learned fuck all from the war.” Pansy said, rolling her eyes as she spoke. “We still have more to learn, too, of course, but it’s as though they’re not even trying.”
Harry was embarrassed by the story, to be honest. He had a few drinks and somehow he had managed to almost get into a fist-fight with Malfoy,
“Potter?” Malfoy’s brow was furrowed in confusion, and Harry was sure that a splash of fear filled Malfoy’s eyes for a moment. “What are you doing here?”
Harry couldn’t take the grin off his face as he realised the flowers were very much blooming right now. He also realised that, even if Draco hadn’t really meant to do it, he was now permanently a part of Draco, even if it was in some small way. “I love it.” He turned towards the tattoo artist, “Thank you so much.”
“Like what?” Malfoy said. He hadn’t spoken much since they had arrived at the library, and his voice was slightly startling.
Draco smirked. “Of course. It’s my game.” He nudged Harry with his shoulder. “Go on. It’ll be fun.” His eyes darkened and Harry already knew what two words he was about to say. “Scared, Potter?”
Harry was exhausted by the time Malfoy came in. He had gotten no sleep the night before - tossing and turning while overthinking his interactions with Malfoy. He was used to having nightmares since the war, but last night was different. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Malfoy’s face, smiling at him. It was exhausting.
was wearing muggle clothes. A muggle suit, to be more specific. A light blue muggle suit that was shining and in need of attention.
“Ah, but Harry, we must show off all of the work we did last night.” Draco had said whilst smirking and tilting his head so Harry had a better view of his hickeys.
“I swear to Merlin, if you two don’t shut the fuck up, I’m kicking you out.” Draco said, looking directly at Harry and Pansy, who both responded with a snort and a “sorry”. Draco continued speaking. “Everyone pair up.”
Ron and Hermione stared at Harry for a moment, before Ron finally spoke. “Okay, mate. Whatever you need.”
Draco stopped and held both of Harry’s hands, looking into his eyes. “Stop it. Of course you’re not.”
He tried not to realise how close he and Draco were right now. Their bodies seemed to be as close as two people could be without touching each other. Harry could practically feel Draco’s warmth from where he was sitting and he had to stop himself from melting into it. All of the humour of his and Draco’s act in front of Slughorn had turned into something else. Something… stronger. At least, on Harry’s end, it was.
Harry laughed. “It would seem so.” He watched as Draco piled up his plate for him. “I’m glad to see you’re wearing the present I got you.”
He sat back and laughed along with his friends, smiling at the scene before him - Theodore, Ginny and Pansy were sitting next to each other, and Pansy had her head on Ginny’s shoulder, her fingers in Theodore’s hair (it seemed she got on rather well with Theodore nowadays, much to Draco’s shock), Hermione and Ron and Blaise were sitting in a huddle, sharing smiles whenever the laughter got loud in the group, Luna was sitting with Neville, Seamus and Dean, playing a seemingly complicated game that Harry had never seen before, and Draco was sitting beside Harry, his smile wide and hot as ever.
Draco’s eyes were still closed, but his eyelashes were fluttering slightly. “No, not this year. With my father being in Azkaban, our family is being watched rather closely.”
There was an extremely awkward silence where Malfoy’s eyes widened comically before he threw his head back and let out a laugh - a real, loud laugh - and Harry found himself wondering if he had ever seen Malfoy laugh before.
fine. Because, sure enough, when he arrived at the showers, someone was already in there. Harry froze at the sound of water running, and he stood silently, unsure of what to do for a few moments.
Harry was surprised at this. Perhaps Draco was being affected by this break-up, too. Perhaps he felt more for Harry than just friendship. Harry shook that thought out of his mind. That couldn’t be it. He was likely just acting the part, pretending to be heartbroken.
Harry winced as he stood up. He spoke as he started taking off his jumper slowly. “Where do I have to go?”
“I didn’t really sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, full of shadows and darkness. I told my parents the next day, and they said they believed me, but I could tell they were worried about me. So, that night, I kept my curtains shut. I didn’t want to look outside - I didn’t want to worry my parents. But, as I drifted off to sleep, a gust of wind came from the window. I was sure I had shut it, but it blew my curtains open nonetheless. It was so freezing, it was almost painful. It took me a few minutes to get up.”
Narcissa came up to Draco’s room before he had woken up. She poked her head in and smiled at Harry warily.
Harry spent the night at Malfoy Manor, which is something he thought he would never do. When he had realised he would, in fact, be spending the night in Malfoy Manor - when Draco had lay in his arms, his tattoo blooming and his breaths slowing - he had no idea what to think. He had put down the book that he had been reading to Draco, and he had snuggled in, but he hadn’t closed his eyes. Not for a while. He had lay there listening to Draco’s breaths until his eyes shut naturally, and soon enough, he was waking up to the sun shining, the birds chirping and absolutely no recollection of falling asleep the day before.
Narcissa nodded as she chewed, waiting to swallow before responding. Harry was reminded of just how differently he and Draco had grown up - Draco was raised to never talk with his mouth full and Harry… well, Harry was raised to never talk and to never keep his mouth full.
She shook her head once more. Harry wanted to cry out and to tell her that the war may be over, but it was still hurting. He wanted to tell her that the war may be over, but the grief wasn’t. He wanted to tell her that the war may be over, but he still couldn’t see past it. He wanted to tell her that the war may be over, but it was still blinding and heavy and the days were a blur and nothing meant anything, anyway, so who cares if he started a few fights?
“Mr Shacklebolt,” He said firmly, “May I remind you that you would not have a meeting to get to if you were not the Minister for Magic. And, may I remind you, that you would not be the Minister for Magic if Voldemort were still alive. And, may I remind you once more, that Voldemort would still be alive if
It occurred to Harry that Draco was probably looking for a distraction, so he breathed out a laugh and said, “What about you? Didn’t you and Pansy used to date?”
Molly laughed and squeezed their cheeks. “Hello, my loves.” She patted their shoulders. “Now on you go. I can’t be standing around all day. Christmas is a busy time.”
Harry gave her a small smile. He found that Luna was one of the few people that could make him smile these days. “Yeah. You deserve to be happy, and she apologised to me after the war. We’ve all done things we’re not proud of to survive.”
Dean shook his head. “Seamus is right, Harry. Now that you’re out, it’s easier for us to be out. It was… dangerous before.”
“Oh, so you don’t want to impress your fake boyfriend when you’re fake shagging him? That’s cold, Draco.”
“What the fuck?” Harry hissed at him. “You definitely owe me an answer about that bloody tattoo now.”
It was mainly the Gryffindors, at first. They would hex the Slytherin students who had been on the wrong side of the war, and they would call them names, and refuse to sit next to them in class. And then, it had been the Slytherins. They didn’t do much, really. They only ever hexed the Gryffindors after they had been hexed themselves, and they never picked fights, only ended them. This had all started with the eighth years, of course. The ones who had been most affected by the war. But, soon enough, the rivalry had spread throughout the school like wildfire and even the first years were joining in. Harry knew he hadn’t enjoyed the Slytherins’ company as a child, but he had never been
Harry laughed at that, but Luna just smiled and said, “Obviously” and Harry was left realising just how fucking oblivious he was.
have gotten the tattoo for Harry. And, the thing was, it was getting harder and harder for Harry to think of any other meaning for the bloody thing. He didn’t know what to do about it.
Harry nodded and left them, finally letting out his laughter when he was an appropriate distance away. While he was laughing, he bumped into Draco. Literally. They slammed into each other and, after the shock of it, Harry let out another laugh.
“Merlin, you look like Greg when his father had made him take a family photo in matching robes.” Draco’s eyes glinted with amusement. “The pictures are hilarious.”
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, then took a deep breath and looked at Malfoy again. “We need to find Hermione.” He said, his voice certain. “Right now.”
as he took a bite, and he looked at Harry with such lust that Harry thought he would die right on the spot, and,
“Well,” Draco said, moving in closer until he was next to Harry’s ear, “I own a pair of tight leather trousers that would drive you positively insane.” He whispered, as Harry shivered at the thought.
Purebloods did need heirs. And Malfoy was the only person who could give his family one. Harry wondered what Lucius Malfoy would do when he heard the news. Luckily, he was in Azkaban, but Harry was sure he still had a lot of power over Narcissa. He suddenly felt very grateful for his and Malfoy’s agreement. It could cost Malfoy a lot.
Draco shook his head and took a deep breath. “I do, Harry.” Harry tried to interject, but Draco kept on speaking. “Us being together doesn’t change what I’ve done.”
He didn’t enjoy it, really. As much as he wanted to, he wasn’t pleased when he saw Malfoy’s genuine smile turn into a scowl. He didn’t do it because he enjoyed it. He did it because he
The next few days went by in a blur of laughter, noise and Molly’s cooking. Hermione went home, promising to return with gifts, whilst Bill and Fleur arrived with hugs. More and more Weasleys began coming home, greeting each other warmly and helping Molly out in the kitchen. Fred’s absence was noticeable, and George spent a lot of time in his room, only coming down for meals, but the rest of them kept themselves busy.
“Come on, the sooner we figure this out, the sooner you’ll know if you accidentally dedicated a tattoo to your high school nemesis.” Harry said, a slight glint in his eyes.
They made their way back through the corridors, and Harry dropped Draco off at the library before going to find Tracey and telling her it was done. She was so pleased she hugged him, which made the Ravenclaw boy squirm slightly beside her.
Draco grinned back. The three of them were wearing Slytherin green silk pyjamas. “Shut up. As though
Malfoy was apparently thinking the same thing, because when their dessert arrived, his leg somehow found its way into the gap between Harry’s legs, and all Harry could do was shift forward in his seat slightly. Malfoy had smirked at that and had taken a bite of his tiramisu and,
“Wait.” Harry could barely breathe as he thought it through. “Sirius left me Grimmauld Place after he died, right?”
As they pulled away, Harry found himself looking at Draco’s lips again, just for a moment. He quickly looked away, but saw something that caught his eye and grinned.
Hermione was growing more excited about the baby by the day, although Harry knew that he would miss out on seeing her baby bump grow. When he had told Ron the news of his move, Ron had pulled a face and said, “Bloody hell, even Rita Skeeter couldn’t drive you away, but Draco fucking Malfoy is the one to make you move?” Harry spent a lot of time with the two of his friends, making the most of the time they had with each other. He had never expected to be leaving them so soon, but it was for the best. Soon, they would be busy with the baby and Hermione’s job, and Harry knew he would just get in the way.
“Well, no, hang on a minute.” Ginny said loudly, catching the room’s attention and turning her head to face Harry. Harry inwardly cursed. Being with Pansy had only increased her need for chaos and mayhem. “Harry, have
“What sort of ‘other stuff’?” Ron’s voice was just above a whisper, but he made sure to look around him whilst speaking.
Harry’s lips quirked up slightly, but remembered he was supposed to be mad at them. “So what if I stay open past closing time every once in a while? Like I said, we’re friends.”
“You guys aren’t the best at… communicating. Obviously.” She said, a slight smile on her lips. “But, Harry still found a way to… reach out to you, Malfoy.” She shook her head. “Look, all I’m saying is that, maybe you did ask him for help.”
Harry could barely focus on what Malfoy was saying, because his head was spinning. The bastard had kissed him.
Harry laughed and relaxed further into the sofa, allowing the warmth from the booze and the laughter and Draco to spread through his body. This was just what he needed after last night.
know anything. And, if they ever claim to have seen something, people mostly think they’ve gone a bit mad.”
Draco laughed. “Thank you. I love it. But, you know, the first present sets the tone for the later presents you buy, so it can only get more expensive from here.”
Harry’s eyes darted from Draco’s eyes to his mouth a couple of times, before Draco leaned in, grabbed Harry’s face and kissed him, causing Harry’s eyes to flutter closed. Draco was a good kisser, Harry thought to himself, before realising that, holy shit, okay he’s going for tongue. Harry’s momentary freakout lasted all of a second because, suddenly the room went quiet and he remembered what was going on and told himself to just enjoy it.
Sam and Malfoy continued laughing well into the next conversation they had, occasionally commenting something about a wand, or some other sort of innuendo, and Harry had to bury his face in his hands all over again.
Harry was sure he had never been more nervous in his life. Even when he was on his way to the Forbidden Forest to die, at least he was
Harry put a line through the name. “Okay, you’re right. I’m sure it’s possible. Although, I do wonder why Millicent asked me to do this.”
A quick note - I think the queer community have so many more stories to tell than ones that are solely based on coming out. However, I wrote this to make me feel better about my own experiences with coming out, which is why I made Harry and Draco's sexualities such a large part of this fic. I apologise if you are sick of coming out stories!
couldn’t help snooping and ended up unintentionally sending him your bloody patronus while you were asleep. You’re idiots and I’m leaving.”
Harry smiled, standing up and putting on his coat. As they walked out, Draco’s hand was on the small of Harry’s back, gently pushing him. He could hear the room go silent, and knew that they would be in the newspapers tomorrow. Hopefully he would have some peace from his younger fans now.
Harry didn’t want to say anything. He really tried not to. But, he found that he was unable to stop himself.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, just slightly, before he quickly schooled his expression back to that of indifference. “Why? Shouldn’t it be the other way around?” Malfoy’s voice had lowered, although Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was aware of this.
Harry smiled sheepishly. Theodore Nott was a truly excellent kisser, and Harry knew that, so he let it go. He felt Draco let out a sharp sigh, but he didn’t argue anymore. Harry kept his attention on Pansy and felt sorry for the poor bugger who she was about to ask.
Harry shook his head. “I tried selling it once, about a year ago, but people prefer their coffee to be sweet rather than savoury.”
He tried a few times. But, every single time, without fail, some students would snicker and Malfoy would frown at Harry’s greetings and leave. Which is why Harry had finally reached the end of his patience when it happened.
Harry had no choice but to answer, the Veritaserum pulling it out of him. “You’re right.” He ground out, and Draco laughed in glee.
“Harry, my…” His voice was quiet, so he cleared his throat and continued. “My father doesn’t… he’s not letting me see you anymore.” He looked up at Harry, and the look on his face made Harry want to cry. He was looking at Harry with fear in his eyes - but not the kind of fear that he had of his father - the kind that he had of Harry. He was afraid Harry would judge him.
it was a stag, but maybe he had been wrong. He hadn’t actually seen the tattoo for very long, and he was so distracted by the shock of it all that he hadn’t really gotten a good look at it.
He missed Draco every minute, counting down the days until he could see him again. He had packed up all of his belongings rather prematurely in anticipation and every part of him ached to see Draco, to touch him, to hold him.
There were significantly less people in the room now, and Draco didn’t need to stand up to be heard now.
Luna was on the other side of Harry, and she greeted him with her usual whimsical nature. “Hello, Harry.” She said, before grabbing his hand and lightly stroking it absent-mindedly as she paid attention to the conversation taking place beside her.
“Merlin, who knew we scared people away that easily?” Draco said quietly, a small smile on his face. Everything about him was quiet right now. His voice, his movements, his expressions. It was as though he didn’t want to disrupt the still of the room, and Harry tried not to find it endearing.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so nervous, Draco. Watch this.” Harry grinned as he spoke loudly across the room. “Blaise! Are you shagging a Weasley or what?”
Draco nodded. When he spoke, his voice was rough with tears. “I’m… I’m sorry. It’s just been a bad day. And I haven’t slept at all the past few nights. I… I think I need some company while I try to get to sleep?”
There was silence between them for a minute, before Ron started moaning to Hermione, asking how much longer they had to study for, but Harry wasn’t really listening to what they were saying. He was too busy thinking about what Ron had just said.
All of a sudden, Harry realised that he should be comforting Draco, it shouldn’t be the other way around. He realised that… even after all of the good that Draco had done, he still saw himself as evil.
Draco was doing to him, and why Harry hadn’t asked about the fantasy that Draco had had about him and if he could recreate it.
He had thought it would be easier to deal with at Christmas - he wasn’t seeing Draco everyday, and Molly had kept all the papers away from Harry so he didn’t have to read whatever foul thing they had to say about their relationship in their latest edition. But, he found himself to still be falling more and more in love with him. He would have a conversation with Arthur, and he’d laugh at something Draco had said. He was pathetic, well and truly pathetic, and he didn’t know what to do.
Harry’s thoughts were interrupted abruptly. Malfoy had leaned over the table and pressed his lips to Harry’s. Hard.
Pansy was still in a good mood, of course, from the results of Draco’s turn, and Neville’s question for her didn’t seem to sour her happiness.
“I don’t know.” Draco said it particularly loudly, and Harry cringed at how much pain this brought him.
But, the next day, Malfoy had made a joke. Nothing big, just a small comment about the war, and Harry felt his stomach turn. Malfoy had opened his mouth to say something else, a question, perhaps, but Harry spoke before he could.
Hermione breathed out a laugh at Molly's familiar rushed manner. “Yes, they’ve been doing well since the war.”
Harry snorted. He knew everyone around him was watching them intently, so he leaned over and whispered into Draco’s ear, “Oh, they’re as real as we are, baby.”
Malfoy must have heard him walking down the corridor, because he looked up, the smile still on his face. When he saw it was Harry, the smile vanished, although a frown didn’t take its place. In fact, Harry was almost certain that Malfoy was still smiling slightly. And that just wasn’t fair. Harry had had an awful day, all fast breathing and heaviness and attempts at a smile, and yet here was Malfoy,
After about 10 minutes of eating and chatting to his friends about the day that he had missed (and Hermione telling him she had already written out his notes for the day), he made his way downstairs, still shocked that Ron and Hermione had done this for him.
They played for a little while longer before people started to leave. The seventh years were the first to go, and then the Gryffindors until, finally, only Harry, Draco and Blaise remained. Pansy and Ginny had already left earlier in the evening, both of them making their way to Pansy’s room with smiles on their faces and Seamus cheering them on.
By the end of it all, he had looked at Draco, and said, “Guys, I’m… I’m really sorry. For everything I did to you. I never really… You guys apologised, and I never did.”
. It was a little bit difficult to do, of course, because there was a table in between them, but they were
Ron and Hermione started dancing again, grabbing him to join them. He obliged, but his eyes were wandering around the hall, unsure of what he was wanting to find.
Harry waited until he stopped laughing to speak again. “Fine, fine. I’ll tell you, but seriously, don’t tell anyone. I’ll look like a right nutter.”
They entered the Burrow to the sounds of Molly rushing around the kitchen, distant alarm clocks waking the house up, and excited chattering coming from the living room. Harry smiled at the look of wonder on Draco’s face. It was a truly fascinating place to be.
Everyone started speaking at once, and Harry sighed as he remembered that they all had to tell the truth. Slughorn looked overwhelmed at the response, and waited until everyone had finished talking to say, “One at a time!”
"Where are your parents, Hermione?" Harry had asked her as he watched his breath form a cloud in the cold air.
After a minute or two of waiting, Draco burst into Harry’s room with a smirk on his face and a joint in his hand.
been happy. He had fallen in love, for fuck’s sake. And now, he was losing all of it because of Lucius fucking Malfoy. And because, unfortunately for him, Draco didn’t love him enough to fight for him. In fact, he didn’t love him at all. And now, he was sitting at his last ever back-to-school feast, and he couldn’t even enjoy it. That was
“Harry, that would be an even more complicated legal process and the Ministry likes to cut corners as much as possible. Besides, they would need Lucius’ signature, which he would never give.” Hermione was frowning as she spoke.
He heard the door shut behind him heavily, and then the sound of Malfoy rummaging around was heard, before a muttered, “lumos”, gave Harry his sight back. As the wand brightened and Harry could finally see in front of him, he realised that he wasn’t in a small space at all. In fact, a whole room appeared in front of him; large and open and comfortingly bright.
Harry blinked. “Umm… okay.” He skimmed the paper. “He says, ‘My son has always been rather impressionable. The Dark Lord’s influence over him is what caused the Malfoy family to become involved in the war, just as Potter’s influence over him has led to this… abomination.’”
They continued their conversation, speaking as though Harry had never said anything, and Harry was grateful for it.
Harry couldn’t believe he had never seen it before. Of course he was in love with Draco. He supposed some part of him always had been. From the moment he had met him in first year he had been captivated - he just couldn’t leave him alone. Especially in sixth year, it had been pure obsession and he hadn’t even realised. But now, he
On top of that, Harry was getting no better at falling asleep and staying asleep. For the past week, he woke up feeling worse than ever - the strange dreams that he couldn’t remember driving him crazy - except, last night was different. Last night, he finally remembered. And it was unsettling, to say the least.
Pansy shrugged, tying half of her hair up as she spoke. “A simple temporary sticking charm.” She tilted her head slightly. “Well, an adapted version that works on people.”
Ginny made her way over to Pansy, who stood up and met Ginny in the middle, hugging her briefly. Ginny whispered something to Pansy, and her eyebrows shot up, but she nodded and pulled away.
“Well,” Malfoy spoke between laughs, clutching his stomach whilst doing so, “It’s just, you must be joking.”
They kissed gently and slowly, neither one of them in a rush. Even as their touches became more urgent and heated, they kept their movements slow, savouring every moment, gripping on to each other for dear life and refusing to let go. They had never done it like that before - Harry found it intoxicatingly beautiful. When he called out Draco’s name, Draco had said he loved him, and they both finished saying it, over and over -
Harry looked at Malfoy, who was looking extremely uncomfortable. Harry was sure he looked the same way, but after thinking it over, he realised that it
The rules were loose, but Harry figured out the game went a little something like this: Someone spun the bottle, and whoever it landed on had to go into one one of the nearest dorms with the bottle-spinner. While they were in there (for seven minutes) the rest of the players played Truth or Dare. Or rather, Truth or Kiss. Whenever someone picked truth, the players would have to move around the room without touching the floor as the questions were asked and answered. Whenever someone picked Kiss, they had to swap a piece of clothing with the person they were instructed to kiss. Of course, they were drinking as they went - whoever went into the dorm without
He couldn’t get it out of his mind. He couldn’t stop thinking about the stag, it’s antlers stretching up Malfoy’s stomach, drops of water covering it, the rest of his chest exposed, and only a towel covering up…
That infuriated Harry even more, and before his brain could even process what his body was doing, he lunged towards Malfoy, grabbing his arm and turning him around.
Narcissa walked in the room with a tray in her hands and a small, almost sad, smile on her face. “How are you doing, Draco?” Her voice was full of concern.
“Come on, Malfoy, you know it makes sense.” Malfoy began to open his mouth, so Harry quickly said, “It has to be a boy. You know it does. Otherwise all of those girls will think they still stand a chance.”
Malfoy’s eyes changed all of a sudden, his avoidance becoming slight panic, and he finally looked at Harry.
He felt her eyes on him, but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Malfoy’s tattoo. Even when Malfoy pulled his shirt back down, oblivious to Harry’s shock, he kept on staring at the area where he had seen it.
Draco cleared his throat. “He’s… He’s doing okay, I suppose.” He sighed. “After Vince died, he wanted to take some time off from school. He’s doing some travelling now, trying to clear his head.”
Pansy smirked. “Theodore Nott.” Harry and Draco both made sounds of protest at the fact that she hadn’t chosen one of them, and she rolled her eyes. “Draco, we were 14. And Harry, you should understand, you’ve kissed Theo before.”
“So, Harry,” Draco started, and Harry was worried he was about to say something about the fact he hadn’t come to class, or maybe about Ron and Hermione inviting him into the Gryffindor common room, but instead he said, “You
Harry stood for a few moments, unsure of what to do, before eventually sighing heavily and leaving the hall in defeat, feeling an awfully large number of eyes on him.
They sat for a while, only talking about happy things, about their friends. When it was time for class, Harry felt calm, and extremely grateful for Draco.
Draco had Harry pressed right up against the wall now. Harry didn’t know what to say, so he looked at the window behind Draco, avoiding his eyes. Draco must have taken that as an attempt to look for an exit strategy, because he put his hands on either side of Harry’s shoulders, his palms flat against the wall.
Draco was wearing the leather trousers he had mentioned to Harry before, a white shirt and a smirk. He looked positively delectable.
Everywhere he went, he either saw Malfoy in his mind, dying by the Great Lake, or in real life, laughing with his friends and drawing in that fucking notebook. And he was exhausted. He was too tired to do anything anymore, so he would often find himself running into Malfoy in the bathroom, not bothering to check the map. He would run into him after his shower and see the tattoo’s gloating presence every single time. It would be infuriating if Harry had the energy to get angry.
, really. And, now that he’s gone, she’s much happier. She would divorce him if it wouldn’t leave us penniless.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up. “Wow. You know, a part of me always thought they’d end up together, but I guess I’ve missed all the latest news. Was it a nice wedding?”
Harry nodded, making sure to keep the books in his hands from falling as he followed Draco to a small table at the back of the library. They settled down into their seats and Draco pulled out a piece of parchment and a pen. He started scribbling, muttering to himself and pausing every once in a while, biting his lip and looking up at the ceiling in thought.
In the spirit of keeping the year fun, one Saturday morning, as he and Draco were lying in bed, he said, “We should sneak out to muggle London tonight.”
Malfoy scoffed. “Oh, so now you also have to pretend you’ve forgiven me? There’s no way you’d be able to keep this up, Potter.”
. He went back and forth in his mind a million times, his feet speeding up, his hand gripping his wand tightly until his knuckles turned white.
“How odd.” George said. “Expected, but odd.” He shook his head and made his way onto one of the sofas. “Merry Christmas, everyone.”
A familiar crease formed between Hermione’s brow. It was the same one that always made an appearance when she was stumped. Harry would find it unsettling if it weren’t for the fact that it was always followed by an epiphany - whether an hour later, or a week later - which was a slight comfort to him.
Seamus smiled and looked over at Dean on the other side of the room. “Because of you, me and Dean got together.”
The halls were quiet when they entered, but their voices soon began echoing throughout the building and they all made their way to the Slytherin common room without speaking about it. It was natural for them, now. They all collapsed onto the Slytherin sofas, sighing as they went.
After staring for a long time, Malfoy finally noticed, looking at Harry and instantly frowning. He didn’t look angry. He looked… tired. Harry glared at him, and Malfoy glared back, but neither of them did anything.
Harry nodded and looked down at the scars. He absent-mindedly traced them with his finger, each touch reminding him that he had Draco. Yes, he had done some awful things in the past - as had Draco - but now, they had each other. And he wasn’t planning on letting go. Ever.
When he and Draco sat down, Harry realised that Neville was sitting next to Theodore, his eyes fixed on a Herbology book that was laying open beside his plate.
In fact, it seemed as though the Weasleys had all gotten more affectionate after the war, as though everyone was trying to make up for the presence that was missing. As though, if everyone was warm enough and loud enough, no one would even notice that Fred was gone. But, of course, they all did. George, especially. He seemed different after the war. His smiles weren’t as wide anymore and his laughs sounded hollow. Harry sometimes caught him passing a mirror and doing a double-take, as though he had seen a ghost. Everyone could feel his missing presence, but no one mentioned it. And Harry found it suffocating.
Harry sighed. He had no clue what they were brewing, but he stood anyway, following the crowd to the potions cupboards and grabbing whatever ingredients he saw his classmates collect. The knotgrass was on a particularly high shelf and Harry almost winced at the thought of having to reach that far up. He started moving towards the shelf, but Malfoy got there first, reaching up and grabbing it rather easily. As he lifted his arm up, his shirt came up and Harry saw the tattoo again.
He didn’t really know where they were walking to, but he didn’t really care. He just needed to breathe.
“She just showed me the latest article. Apparently, Rita Skeeter has managed to ‘gain access to a visitation spot at Azkaban’ - which is basically impossible, by the way - and plans on getting Lucius Malfoy’s opinion on ‘his son’s newest romance’.” Ron quoted her with disgust.
“Hey.” Draco said, forcing a smile. Harry didn’t know if he was performing yet, or if he really just couldn’t bring himself to smile.
“I wish he could just… quit his job.” Harry said, a dry laugh escaping his lips. “Or, I wish I could.”
Arthur’s eyebrows shot up and he took a moment to answer. “I’m glad to hear house rivalry isn’t everything anymore.” He cleared his throat. “How did you become friends?”
“Thank you, sir.” Harry was about to leave the call, but quickly added. “And, we really should catch up sometime soon. Goodbye, sir!”
Draco looked quite proud of himself as he went through Blaise’s clothes and brought out a pair of pants.
Harry didn’t know what to say. This would crush Draco. “I… I have to call him. I have to call Draco.”
There was a pause where Harry made sure Draco had said everything he needed to say. Harry smiled a small, sad smile as he spoke. His voice was a whisper now, too, but he knew Draco could hear him. “You know, it’s funny, I had one of those moments, too.”
Harry laughed slightly as he unscrewed the flask and took a swig from it. “Thanks.” He said, his face screwing up at the taste of Firewhiskey.
“Fuck.” Harry growled. “You shouldn’t have bothered to put clothes on, because I’m just going to have to undress you again.”
Harry was shocked - this isn’t how they were to each other, not anymore - but he didn’t know what to say, and he could tell that Draco didn’t want him there, so he left. He stood up, grabbed his things, dropped the newspaper on Draco's bed, and left. Draco shut his bedroom door before he got a chance to say goodbye, and Harry stood there for a moment.
gotten the tattoo for Harry? What would he even do then? He continued taking sips from the flask as the night wore on, and he was sure McGonagall was suspicious of him, but he didn’t care. His vision was blurring slightly and he had a nice buzz going.
Harry raised his eyebrows. Harry wondered why they were allowing him to be here in the first place. Perhaps his recent plan had been more successful than he had realised.
“Right. But, if Narcissa is the reason that he was able to keep his assets, why wasn't she just given them? She’s the one using and protecting them, and Lucius won’t be needing them - not until he’s out of Azkaban.”
Dean smiled and Seamus placed a kiss on his cheek. “Harry, I was sorry to hear about you and Malf… Draco.” Dean said, his eyes sincere. “You know, I really thought that was it for you two. I thought… well, I guess I thought you guys would stay together.”
Draco smiled. “Decorating. It’s the last game night before we go away for Christmas, so we’re going all out.” His smile widened. “Which reminds me, are your friends free?”
Harry had spent his entire Saturday morning trying to get a hold of Kingsley Shacklebolt. He had contacted every area of the Ministry that he could think of and had gotten nowhere. His head had been stuck in the fireplace in the eighth year common room for hours (he was lucky most of the eighth years were at Hogsmeade, in their dorms, or were minding their own business) and was about to take a trip to the Ministry itself when Shacklebolt’s face appeared rather unexpectedly.
That was when Harry had woken up. He woke up still seeing Malfoy’s eyes. Far away, but clear. It was terrifying and exciting all at once, and Harry was cursing himself yet again for choosing to go to class today, because he could still see Malfoy’s eyes in his mind.
Harry nodded enthusiastically, realising that he must have been staring for quite a while. “Yes. Sorry. Could… could I come in?”
“On what?” Ron asked, and there was a pause where Harry tried to come up with an answer and failed. “Look, mate, it just seems like… It seems like you already know what you want.”
