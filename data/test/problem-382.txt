She gave her a small tap on the back. “Don’t worry, he’ll be released later and then you can see him whenever you want.” She offered the dejected Puffs who's moods instantly changed.
When Potter had said that he’d
It looked a lot like revenge. How very fitting.
“Were you Dumbledore’s spy all along?”
He realised something.
Draco was currently sat next to Potter at the dinning table, surrounded by a flock of chatting Weasleys.
Draco was a man on a mission. Well he was a man on a lot of missions, but one served to be of the upmost importance at the present moment.
“Holy fuck,” he gasps out as Potter pushes gently inside, his tongue still lapping the head of Draco’s erection. He pushes in further and Draco clenches around his thick, long finger.
How in Merlin’s name did she already have so much energy?
He was a realist. Was that really so hard to comprehend?
But what happened when there was no hope left? What happened when the light burned out? There would be darkness, only darkness. And Draco was engulfed in it.
So he wanted to believe her, he so desperately wanted to believe her. But he couldn't.
fall true.
For the first time in a really long time, they did not watch the sunrise together.
It was small and white, with a patch of light blue hair dusting its stomach. To Draco, it represented all that was pure in the world. All that the world could
“Not that I don’t like the Hufflepuff’s.” Theo whispered, “but wasn’t this supposed to be a date?” he asked light-heartedly.
He carried on, eyes red and puffy. “I hate this. I hate you two interfering with everything. None of this is any of your damn business.” he snarled at them.
“Well, I’m not a very nice person and your idiot of a leader deserved it.”
He didn’t have a chance to dwell over the dream when Madam Pomfrey appeared at the foot of his bed. So, he was in the hospital ward. That made sense.
“I make you happy?” she questioned shyly, pulling away.
It was quite funny actually. So, after a few days of Hufflepuff's following his every move, it was hard for a man not to get attached. So, now you could say that Draco had adopted them. And he was most definitely better for it.
normal.
He was also a father that bathed him when he was young. A father who brought him his first broom. A father that picked him up and kissed away his injuries when he’d get hurt. A father that had tears in his eyes whenever he would hurt him. A father who’d held him when he had nightmares, who brought him chocolate when he was sad. A father that read to him, dressed him, smiled at him.
Potter?
“Since I found out that you won’t get into Auror training if you’re shite at potions.” He answered honestly.
they should be.
Draco blinked a few times, as if he could not believe his ears. He looked shyly at her big beaming smile, and felt for the first time, that she may be right.
It was quite easy to spot in all fairness. The boy's lips had curled at the words 'hypothetically', and let's be real, no one smiled at a stranger they did not like or somewhat trust.
growled at him, as she pointed her wand at him accusingly. “Of course, it’s a good idea. We spoke to Kat’s mum,” she started, and they both winced at the name. “She told us what happened to Kat but also how happy was in the Draco Malfoy Pride.” She stated and Draco hung his head down in shame.
No, Draco was currently staring at the floor as the Headmaster berated him for his actions in potions yesterday.
“Yes, until they’re not.” Severus pointed out.
He sat down next to Luna. She gave him a searching look, “it’s not your fault, Draco.” She said with assertion.
Kat nodded. “Alright, I’ll see you tomorrow Draco.” She grinned before speeding off down the corridor.
. It all made sense. It had been his only physical comfort during the war. It kept him close when he was sad, it glowed when he was happy, it kept him safe when he was scared. It went cold when the war seemed lost…
Potter’s eyes blazed with anger. “Help?” he spat out ludicrously, “You two wanted to fucking help?” He raged.
As he made his way back to the Slytherin dungeons cautiously so he wouldn’t get caught, he decided that Potter
He huffed, glaring at them in determination. “Did I or did I not wiggle my arse suggestively as an indicator for you all to follow?” he growled out.
“Problem Potter?” Theo asked with a hit of annoyance.
smart with me, Malfoy.” He warned.
Her eyes widened. “You haven’t?” she gasped. “But you’ve been in love since Christmas!” she declared.
Draco sunk to his knees, tears falling down his cheeks. He’s never felt pain like it. It was as if someone had torn out his heart, leaving him with nothing but a blackened soul. His rock. His head. His heart. Was gone. And Draco didn’t know if he was ever coming back.
“Draco!” Kat tugged his arm, snapping him from his thoughts, he looked up at his friend dizzy with worry.
“And how’s that?” Draco asked curiously.
Draco sighed, knowing that he was fighting a losing battle. “Fine.” He bit out. “I have no bloody idea what we are or were should I say.” he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was
She gave his shoulder a quick squeeze. “Oh darling, what can I do?” she urged, and Draco couldn't let her. He wouldn't let her get caught up in all of this.
But no one was there. And he
He was still a danger to Harry. A danger to his life and the whole wizarding world. He had to protect him. He had to keep him safe. No matter the cost.
Draco smiled sadly. “I think that’s an excellent idea.” he told him, wanting to just have a few precious moments without the weight of the world hanging from them.
Draco’s eyes started to well with tears, “it was my fault. I’ve lost him, and it’s all my fault.” He choked out in realisation.
“Don’t be silly, you have me.” She stated, giving him the warmest smile yet.
A problem.
Draco shook his head, too upset to talk. He just wanted it to all go away. He just wanted it all to stop. Even if it were just for a little while.
It was an impossible task.
something to fight for. And right now, Draco was fighting for himself. He’d finally chosen himself.
Just when he thought that things couldn’t get any worse, he looked up, straight into the tired eyes of Katie Bell.
“Are we clear Mr Malfoy?” The Headmaster’s calm voice tore him from his thoughts.
He swallowed loudly. “And then you took it all away. My escape. A place where I could be myself. My rock. You took it all, and I broke. Hermione calls it a psychotic break. I’m not too sure how I feel about that.” He chuckled, but it sounded forced, desperate. Draco didn't like that. He didn't like it at all.
He missed the days where he could just curl up into his mother's arms, safe from any harm that would come his way. What was he now?
Without a word, he stood up and walked away. He didn’t need to listen to this bullshit. Draco felt a deep satisfaction to be the one to leave Potter alone. It was petty, but he didn’t care.
Somehow though, he didn’t mind all that much.
So, he sat there, drawing until the sun came up. Potter never left his side.
She nodded slightly. “Don’t thank me. This is all because of you. You accepted us two years ago without a second glance. You let us follow you around, you let us laugh, you let us be a part of something bigger than ourselves. So, thank you.” She squeezed him just that little bit tighter.
Draco said nothing, instead he optioned to raise his brow in acknowledgement.
Typical. Of course, when he wanted the infuriating bastard to speak, he kept quiet. His father may have changed a considerable amount over the years, but Draco was sad to say that he was still the proud git that he’d always been.
Draco smirk, “I live to serve.” He flared dramatically, as the sleeve of his robe was tugged quite forcefully.
He coated his hands with water, slowly running them through his hair. He preened. He was no longer Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince, and typical Bad Boy. No, he was Draco Malfoy, profound hairstylist, and a friend to all Hufflepuff’s. He smirked, now that was a name he could get on board with.
He’d forgiven his father. There had been no other option. Forgiveness wasn’t the trait of the weak, but an attribute of the strong. Draco had been given a chance, one to create a new beginning. And forgiveness, he mused, that was the only way that he’d truly be free.
Funnily enough, it wasn’t the whole ‘first-year Hufflepuff's stormed into the potions classroom and hexed the shit out of Smith’ incident that the Headmaster was discipling him about. In fact, he hadn’t even brought it up.
He’d forgotten it all.
“Your Hufflepuff’s were amazing today during potions, Smith looked about two seconds away from passing out.” He chuckled. The git deserved it Draco mused. “And don’t get me started on the Draco Malfoy Pride badges, I mean what in Merlin’s name is up with all of that?” he teased.
He sighed, slamming the door behind them, and leant against the frame. He loved his Hufflepuff’s he really did. It was just
“No, it’s not fucking okay, Ron.” Potter shouted and the Hall went silent. Seriously, you couldn't even hear a pin drop.
killed.
The Headmaster took a deep breath, “why don’t we go to my office?” he offered calmly.
Draco’s eyes widened, “No!” he yelled. “He can’t find out. Not now. Not yet. I have a plan.” he told her somewhat confidently, because he did, have a plan that is.
. The badges sat proudly on the robes of nearly everyone in the Great Hall. His eyes teared up at the sight, it was truly overwhelming. The smiling, accepting faces of all those around him gave him the last piece of hope that he’d never really realised he’d lost.
He could tell you one thing, he was
Draco gave her a rare, genuine smile. “Enough of this lovey dovey feelings talk, tell me how you first day of classes are going.”
every Slytherin had a teeny-weeny piece of Hufflepuff within them as well. Not that he’d admit that to anybody. Ask him and you die!
Draco knew what they were saying was right. Potter and he were both broken. They were both fragile, full of deep hurt and destruction. He should stay away. He knew that he should stay away.
His father was okay with him being gay? His father had sort of made peace that he was dating Potter? Draco wasn’t even dating Potter for Merlin’s sake!
Potter grinned goofily, “So I’m guessing that you like it?” he teased and Draco nodded frantically giving him a small peck on the lips.
Or as Draco liked to call it, manipulating the truth.
Like hell was he going to stay in this mouldy old room just because Potter told him to. Who the hell did Potter think he was? No, Draco was going straight back out there to fight, whether perfect Potter liked that or not.
The slamming of a door broke him from his thoughts. Draco looked up in surprise to find Kat standing in the doorway, a band of Hufflepuff's trailing behind her. They promptly ignored Slughorn’s protests and marched up to Smith with pure determination.
Draco gulped, “And Potter?” he asked, even though he wasn’t sure as to why he was asking. It wasn’t as if they were together.
It was as if his hope had been sunk. Potter was right, he hadn't changed. No, he had just masked the truth.
thing to do. He didn’t remember his time with Potter, he didn’t remember what he said or didn’t say. What he admitted or didn’t admit. By giving Potter the letters, he was disclosing the person that he once was, and was offering the person that he hoped to be.
Potter squeezed him a little tighter, “I’m here.” He reassured him softly, his eyes scanning gently over Draco’s face, as if searching for an answer he desperately wanted to find.
“Oh, hello Draco dear. I was just about to pop over to the manor and check where you’d gotten to. Looks like you’ve saved me a trip.” She exclaimed merrily, and Draco suddenly felt scared. Very, very, scared.
And part of him knew that he could go to sleep right now, that he could forget all about it but, would he be able to rest? That was the question.
He promptly ignored any attempt of conversation from Blaise or Theo as he got himself ready for bed. He felt awful. He hadn’t realised that’s why Pansy was upset, that she cared so much about him.
“Oh, shut the hell up Draco. You know I wasn’t talking about that.”
Draco took a deep breath and glanced at both of them apologetically, “I truly am sorry. I’ve just needed a bit of time for myself.” He admitted quietly.
To Draco’s complete and utter surprise, Weasley was sat at a desk stirring their potion with the upmost concentration and care.
Draco thought about it. He
well talking about?” he sneered.
Kat slapped him playfully on the arm. “You’re a big, fat liar Draco.” She teased.
“Well, you don’t talk much. You're friends with Hufflepuff's and, you don’t insult any of us much anymore.” he told him, and Draco slightly agreed.
“No shut up. Shut the fuck up.” He snarled at Weasley. “Can’t you see? Don’t you understand? He won’t even bloody look at me anymore!” he screamed.
Potter had been his whole life ever since he started Hogwarts. Their jabs and taunts. Their spits and spats. It had all been about him. It always had.
He already knew that he wanted all of Potter. He knew his faults, he knew the things that he had done, and he loved him more because of them. He needed to know that Potter accepted him in his entirety. And this was the only way to do that.
Draco was currently sobbing on his bed, an abundance of Portkeys spawled beneath him. He hadn’t managed to give them to the Muggleborn’s yet and he was running out of time.
Potter shook his head vigorously. Before walking over to Draco and pulling him over his shoulder.
to break his muggle device, that's all her cared about.
He’d saved her. He’d saved her, just like he should’ve saved Kat. He may have protected one innocent, but he’d failed to protect the one innocent that meant more to him than he could ever express. Something about that deeply unsettled him. It was something that he didn’t think he’d ever get over.
That would be foolish. And he'd bet on his last galleon that Nathan was anything but foolish
He wanted to help. He desperately did, but how could he possible comment on a question that he didn't know the answer to?
He gave her a weak smile. “You seem to be in an uplifted mood.” He remarked.
Blaise grinned, “Let’s also not forget the time that—
“Draco darling, don’t you think you’re being a tad dramatic?” she asked him and he glared at her. He was
Severus glared, “I can’t decide whether you are dumb or just stupid. Since you’ve decided to openly go against the Dark Lord, I must settle on the latter.”
Draco couldn’t help the smile that formed at the edges of his lips. “Thirteen!” he exaggerated. “Well, I guess that makes up for it.” he eyed her sceptically.
Draco rolled his eyes, because yes, Draco normally sounded exactly like a younger Snape. He should thank Potter for that stupid observation.
In fact, he couldn't really bring himself to care about anything much. And his ability to turn off, to detach himself like that. Well... it scared him.
His mother pulled him into a tight squeeze. “You know, there was a time when I believed that you would never say that.” She said honestly, and Draco’s cheeks started to warm up.
“They’re right about that. Hufflepuff's are very much brave and kind.”
Tears full of defeat and agony were pouring down his face. His body was shaking, his heart smashed into unfixable pieces. He felt every part of him break as he read what was written just below his own words.
“Excellent.” Blaise purred as they sat on one of the couches. “So, pray tell, do you have anything to do with why Theo looks as if his crup’s just died?” he asked.
He put a hand on his hip. “If you were wondering, I get up every day to fix my luscious locks. Do you think that
Blaise laughed. “I’m shaking in my designer shoes.” He teased, faking terror.
Draco turned around and headed towards the Great Lake, his mind caught up in thought. He decided that Theo was right, it had just taken him some time to realise that. He was no longer Draco Lucius Malfoy, esteemed pureblood, and Malfoy heir. No, he was Draco, just
Potter looked up at him intently, vulnerability lacing his feature. “Then look at me.” He started, and Draco on reflex looked into his eyes. “Look at me and tell me that you don’t have feelings for me. Tell me that you don’t
“But then you found me.” He breathed. “You looked at me. And I mean
War was all about moves and countermoves. Victory and loss. Emotions didn’t fit into that equation.
The Dark Lord a name that stayed at the forefront of his mind. A name that he so desperately wanted to be rid of, but could never escape from. it shook him to his core.
(See the end of the chapter for
He took a deep breath. “I’d rather we’d be together alive than dead.”  He said honestly.
Not being himself at all? Seriously? Draco was currently in a life or death position. Watching his life be ripped from his clutches, and you didn't see him screaming at people.
“It’s time we put our narrow minded, bigotry beliefs behind us. That we learned to trust and believe in one another. I am no different to you and any of you are no different than I.” she gave Draco a small smile. “Katerina Pritchett knew that.” She stated and Draco’s breath hitched as he started to cry uncontrollably.
Draco nodded. “Fair enough.” He agreed. “So, do you really like him then?” he questioned.
He sighed, “Did you need anything?” he asked with a huff. All he wanted was to grab his sketchbook and leave. Was that too much to ask?
answer that he had ever heard. He's drawing? What the
“It was nothing.” He nodded at her as she left the little alcove.
“Wait!” Potter half-shouted, half-pleaded.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I apologise. I never realised that killing your Headmaster made you a man. I’m sorry, I’ll do better.” He drawled and he could feel Severus' burning gaze drilling holes into his skull..
to apologise?” he spat angrily. “Oh, go suck Weasley’s dick.” He flipped her off.
He’d had enough. That crazy, demented, psychotic bitch had taken everything from him. His best friend. His future. His fucking freedom. She would not take his life either. That wasn’t hers to take. He wouldn’t let her.
nervous.
He wanted to tell her to smile. To tell him that everything was alright. He wanted her to hold him when he cried. To make him happy when he was sad. He wanted his mother back. He
How was he feeling? He didn't know. He really didn't know.
Potter shrugged. “You’re right Draco, I accepted your invitation without your permission and I’m sorry.” He started and Draco glared. “But you’re going no matter what, so don’t attempt to fight me on this.” He informed in defiance and Draco saw little point in trying to object.
It was time.
did you think it was a good idea to attempt to kill me Potter?
“What else could I have
Draco put his pencil to the soft parchment, willing himself to draw something. Anything. It had to be happy not sad. Be full of emotion, not void. He let out a harsh cry. Why wasn’t it working? Why was he so messed up?
it was.
He looked up at her with big, hopeful eyes. “Do you really think that Blaise will help?” he asked almost shyly.
A dutterhead. He was trying to reason with a complete dutterhead! Draco huffed, “meaning that we can control how long and how much you’ll become insane.” he'd have more a better chance trying to talk to a brick wall.
Neville sighed, “I don’t think that anyone deserves to die.” He said honestly, “But people like her… well, they don’t deserve to live either.” He gave Draco’s shoulder one last squeeze before joining the crowd.
“Ooo! That’s so exciting!” Kat exclaimed before going into a long rant about Slytherin green hair. Pansy gave him an

He was almost finished with his sketch. He reckoned that it had turned out pretty well. It was subtle, sweet, simple. But it showed so much. He felt so much when he looked at it. It reminded him of all that was right in the world. All that made him happy.
His eyes were closed and he was just about to fall asleep when something shook him violently.
His eyes widened slightly, staring at her in wonder. “She’s not smiling much, is she?” Kat asked.
“No and mind your language.”
Who did he think he was kidding? You don't just apologise to someone months after the incident had occurred. What game was Macmillan playing?
If Draco’s hair was long enough to flick, then he’d have flicked it right about now. “Don’t worry, it’ll fit and you have the Malfoy genes to thank for that.” He boasted.
Draco nodded before pulling off his blanket and getting out of the bed. Like hell was he going to stay here any longer than he needed to.
“So, I’m sure you all know why I’ve called you here today.” he told them seriously as he entered the abandoned classroom.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t hate him. I could never hate him. Not anymore.” He decided.
He was going to tell Potter.
Free to be himself. Free to laugh. Free to smile. Free to love. He was free to be everything he had always know himself to be. For the first time, in a long time, there was nothing blocking his path. He was loved, he was safe, he was accepted. He was
He hated him because he was right. Draco’s heart hadn’t been in it. He didn’t want to do it. he still didn’t want to do it. But he had to. He had no choice.
“Oh!” he quirked. “Just in case I forget.” He said digging into his pockets retrieving a circle.
He opened his mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off by Hermione as she stood up. “Just think about it.” she smiled before she was gone in a flare of robes.
good.
She smiled, a questionable glint in her eye and Draco was scared. “That’s better.” She preened, and he concluded that she was not a girl to be messed with.
Draco repressed a smile, “I suppose you muggles call it drawing,” he quipped, placing his pencil down gently next to him.
He looked up, coming face to face with the rather repulsive faces of Ernie Macmillan and Zacharias Smith. Had Merlin not punished Draco enough?
Draco let out a small sob, his body threatening to shake with tears. He didn’t like this. He didn’t like this at all.
changed him. It had made him ruthless, wary, and cruel. But, it had also made him strong, accepting, and loving. War had given him some of the qualities that he hated most about himself. But if given the option, he wouldn’t go back. For war had given him everything that he didn’t realise he so desperately needed.
The necklace lay in his pocket, a silent reminder of all that he has done. Of what he will continue to do.
He could see it now: and this kids is how Draco Malfoy single handedly drove Theodore Nott off the edge. He was sure that it would become a fan favourite.
He laughed. “That you are.” he gave her the best smile that he could muster
Oh yes, the manor wards! He really needed to get round to changing them some time soon.
“What do you mean you’re not close anymore?” he asked, Macmillan's answer being far from what he had expected.
. He realised that he wanted that. He wanted all of Potter, and he wanted to give all of himself to Potter. Suddenly, all that his mother had said finally made sense.
“I’ve not changed.” He blurted out suddenly. She gave him a baffled look. “I’m still the same git that I was before.” He carried on.
He shot her a smirk, “you’re a Gryffindor right?” he said almost mischievously.
“Well, I don’t think that I need to listen to this attack for any longer.” He huffed, rising to his feet in a swirl of robes and blonde hair. He’s said it before, and he’ll say it again, Severus Snape would be jealous. And as he should.
It was his turn now. It was up to him to make sure his mother felt as safe as she’d always made him.
Ah! This girl had a little piece of Slytherin in her. You couldn't tell him differently. He wouldn't hear of it.
He decided that he was quite similar to Macmillan in many ways, well apart from the stupidity, but the biggest difference, was Macmillan's drive to change. Draco was still stuck being his father's puppet, too cowardly to stand up for himself.
Well, not anymore. He was tired of running. It was time to fight for the one person who had never stopped fighting for him.
Well, he couldn't disclose that piece of information. He deemed it quite inappropriate for the dinner table. So, he found himself at a loss.
Draco rolled his eyes, “what is it that you want that requires my undivided attention?” he asked impatiently.
them ignorant.
Weasley took a scared breath, “we really have to go. Come on!” he yelled as he took the house elf’s hand, Hermione following suit.
Purple?
“Why are you all wearing those badges?” he asked with caution.
“Draco!” Greg nudged him hard in the arm.
Potter stayed with him until the sun came up.
Draco had spent the whole summer worrying out of his wits. His mind was constantly submerged with bothersome questions like what if Potter forgot about him? Or what if Potter never wanted to see him? Or the dreaded, what if Potter fell out of love with him?
In fact, he downright envied Macmillan. He too, wished that he could become the person that he'd always wanted to be, a person that he was proud of.
He honestly didn't know how Jerry's parents put up with him, but he gave them a small round of applause in his head.
The now Hufflepuff second years had stormed the courtroom, their ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badges proudly on display and had testified that Draco was the best Slytherin in the world. They’d spoken about how he’d guided and cared for them when nobody else had. Piggy had even commented on how he’d saved her life during the final battle. They’d ended their testimony threatening that if anything were to happen to Draco, their friendly butterflies, wouldn’t be so friendly anymore.

Harry cringed, turning around to face her, his eyes ablaze with fury. “How the
Meddling little buggers!
He sighed, Potter had gone to get a few of his things from Gryffindor tower, and Draco was surrounded with confusion.
Pansy shook her head, continuing to block his path, “you don’t care? You don’t care?” she repeated hysterically and Draco could swear that they were going around in circles.
. But he couldn’t find the words. He could see it in Potter’s eyes, he could see the love that shone deeply within them. Potter loved him, there was no doubt about it. And Draco… well he didn’t know how the
“I am not a softie.” He snapped, glaring daggers at her.
Draco turned to face the bloodied body that was his aunt, he took a deep breath. “I’m already tainted.” He growled out defiantly.
At least someone wanted to help him. At least
“Draco we’re going to be late for breakfast.” Pansy yelled as she burst into the room, and Draco shielded his face from her.
His mother’s eyes shone with tears as she ignored the gasps and shrills, nestling herself in Draco’s warm open arms. He hugged her tightly, despite everything he was safe. It was him and his mother against the world.
She reached out to grab it, her hand hovering over it. “Do I make you happy?” she choked out,
“Hey, don’t get all
Draco sighed contemplatively, he reasoned that he just didn’t care. He really didn’t care. What was the point? He was trapped in a net of expectation and duty. His life was and would always be a product of his father’s choices. What was the point of caring for a life that wasn’t his own?
The Slytherin’s as well as the rest of the students stared at them in shook. He didn’t blame them, for the little girl next to him was making history before their very eyes. Never, in the whole of Hogwarts, had a Hufflepuff sat at the Slytherin table.
Draco splutter incredulously, “But I’m dirty. I’m tainted. You need to stay the hell away from me.” He shouted.
“You can barely hear me, you say?” he asked and Draco’s stomach started to fill with dread. His father chuckled with glee, “then I’m sure you won’t be able to hear it when I say that Potter you
having intimate relations with a bloody ghost.
Luna shifted closer towards him, resting her hands softly against his own. “Do you think, that, perhaps, you meant that in more ways than one?” she asked intently.
Draco’s face lit up with excitement. “Oh, that is my toasterer.” He smiled proudly. “I’m trying to find the bread.” He declared.
“Then it shall be the most honourable death known to man.” He joked, feeling much better than he had in days.
Not today.
Draco groaned at the statement, heat pooling between his legs. “You’ve had it before?” he asked, conscious of the slight edge to his voice.
Oh no. Oh dear. Oh god. Oh whatever else that came after 'oh'. This was bad, this was very, very bad.
best friend.” He spat possessively deeming them as enemies.
. The Headmaster had known all this time and he hadn’t done anything. That angered Draco. He could’ve stopped him. Intervened. Even killed him. But he hadn’t he let Draco descend down the path into darkness, sell his soul to the devil himself. He hadn’t saved him.
It was the right thing to do. It was the
Draco raised an intrigued brow, “whatever may that be?” he questioned intently.
But he wasn’t alone.
Kat shook her head. “I thought that they were nice before they started saying mean things about you. But you’re my best friend in the whole entire world, if they don’t like you then I don’t like them.” She stated firmly.
“Ignoring you?” he accused, shooting daggers at him.
Weasley turned a very bright shade of red, “if you meant that I realised how much of an idiot I’d been, then yes.” He admitting placing a chaste cheek on Hermione’s cheek, who also began to blush.
“Can’t you see what’s going on here?” she asked, and Draco shook his head. Pansy took a deep breath, “You’re doing what you always do. You’re ignoring the problem hoping that it will go away.”
“But nothing, nothing at all.” he finished, panting as he tried to catch his breath.
“Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she’d bare a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of Meade with one laced with poison?” he said and Draco froze.
“You make me crazy Malfoy.” He admitted.
Potter smiled. “And that is why I put your name on every gift I’ve brought them.”
He needed him. Potter
“I’m Draco—”
It had just gone nine when he got back to his dorm. Draco lay sprawled out on his bed, too late to be in the common room, but to early to go to the lake.
it hadn’t been years, but it had been one so it still counted! Anyways, after years and years of analysis he’d realised that every Gryffindor had a little bit of Hufflepuff within them. And maybe, just
He stayed silent. A silence that meant that he was tired of fighting, now that there wasn’t anything left to fight for. His silence meant that he was tired of his feelings, not wanting to feel them anymore. His silence meant that he was ready to adapt. His silence meant that he had chosen.
Maybe that made him naïve. Maybe it even made him a little bit selfish. But he didn’t care. Everybody had that one thing that kept them going. That one thing that gave them hope. His was Draco.
He continued to sketch. His messed-up attempt at happiness. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t normal, but it was his.
Draco couldn’t breathe. Was he brave? No. He decided. He was not. He was a coward; a braver man would’ve never taken the mark in the first place.
“Draco?” at tentative voice asked and Draco forced himself out of his parents embrace as he looked up into the hesitant eyes of Harry Potter.
Draco felt his cheeks start to heat up. No one had been this nice to him in a really long time. Of course, he didn’t agree with her, he knew that he was evil incarnate. Still, it felt good to hear such things.
“Like it?” he started, “I absolutely love it.” he said honestly.
He nodded. “I’m perfectly fine Sir.” He answered, his voice void of emotion.
They stayed like that for several seconds before slowly pulling away. “This is the craft shop.” She inclined her head slightly towards the store in front of them.
“Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right.” a high voice commanded.
Which is why, Draco felt his heart break as he gazed down at the tear stained woman lying on his lap. “It’s okay mother.” he repeated over and over as he gently threaded his fingers through her hair.
He took a deep breath. “Kind of. It’s a portkey. But after it activates it becomes just an ordinary ring.” He started and Potter looked at him sceptically. “It’s a promise. I charmed it to bare my magical signature. So that you always have a piece of me with you. That you remember that no matter where you are or who you’re with, I love you.” He said with a shaky breath and Potter’s eyes widened.
He felt his eyes swell with tears for the seventh time. He wanted it with Potter. He wanted to have it all with Potter. He knew how he felt. He was definite that he wouldn’t feel like this unless what he had with Potter was the real thing. But that wasn’t enough. He felt as if a part of him was missing, and he wouldn’t be able to fully give himself to Potter without finding it.
It all seemed to be a waste of his time. He felt long for all the things he could be doing at this very moment, if only he didn't have to listen to Pansy act like a complete and utter bitch to be frank.
Potter.
Pansy reached over, picking up a triangular cucumber sandwich and stuffing it into her mouth. “You and I both know that’s not true.” She said through mouthfuls of crumbs.
She nodded. “Yes. And don’t you forget it.” she threatened. “So, tell me what on earth is going on. Is it Potter?” she asked and he felt a bout of annoyance.
Abruptly, Draco pulled away to catch his breath. He gazed up into lust filled green eyes. They brimmed with much unsaid emotion. Draco’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He’d never felt like this. He didn’t think he could ever feel like this with anyone else other than Potter.
“Kat, I don’t know what to say—”
It also was taking everything he had in him not to snap. He had two minds not to grab their pathetic cameras and shove them up a place they’d never be found.
Draco blushed. “Well, it is a pretty fabulous arse.” He murmured taking a sneak peek at the wonderous bump.
She reached over, placing a hand atop of his. His eyes flew up, shocked at the action. Her hand was warm, it didn’t ignite butterflies in his stomach like Potter, but it was nice, nevertheless.
It stood tall and proud before him, radiating a vibe of grandeur and deceit.
He scoffed. If she really thought that would grind his nerves, then she was very much deluded. If fact, this was perfect. Without the pressures of being prince he’d be able to get the attention off him for a change.
He coughed, “what are you doing here?” he asked, shamefully embarrassed of everyone looking at them.
was wrong. He couldn't afford to be upset, things couldn't be wrong. They just couldn't.
It could be heard throughout the Manor.
“You idiot! Why didn’t you tell me.” He bit out.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, I can assure you that I do. In fact, if I were you, I’d feel extremely proud to be in Hufflepuff.” He gave her a small smile as he forcefully tried to prevent himself from turning green with disgust.
“I hate you.” She spat. “How
Weasley nodded. “See you, mate.” He said before they walked out of the room.
Draco shook his head. “No, but I will be.” He spoke surely.
Draco raked a hand through his hair, stopping her from answering. “Because I’ll tell you. It’s really fucking hard.” He spat out with an ounce of hysteria.
Ms Pritchett stepped aside and he entered the house. He figured that it would have been homely even just a few weeks ago. Now it just seemed melancholic. The lights were dim, dust lined the floors. The white walls appeared grey, and the air was stale and old.
He gulped, willing himself to be dragged into a sleep which he would never wake from. “You were different. More subdued. You didn’t fight with me. You didn’t pick on me. You didn’t even call me names. You just ignored me. As if I wasn’t good enough to be a part of you life. That hurt.”
And those were just the first years. Don’t even get him started on the presents he’d had to get Hermione, Weasley, Potter, and surprisingly Lavender Brown. Because Draco just
was a colour he could get on board with.
He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. The Headmaster would one day die, but it would not be by his hand. He’d made his
He just wanted it to stop. He wanted the pain to stop.
Ms Pritchett smiled as turned to face Kat. “And what about you, young miss?” she asked her and Kat blushed, also nodding frantically.
Draco focused on keeping his head down, refusing to rise to Weasley’s taunts and jabs. A year ago, he would’ve been more than happy to shoot a few insults right back at Weasley. Hell, he’d probably had been the one to start the insults. But he was different now. Perhaps it was partly because he’d grown up and realised that there were more important things than taunting and bullying your classmates. Mainly, it was because Draco was already a terrible person, he didn’t need to succumb to things that would make him worse.
Draco took a deep breath, lowering himself onto his knees so that he was eye level with the small girl. “Something’s happened. Something’s going to happen, and I need you to listen to me. I need you to do as I say.” He said seriously.
So, this was how he wanted to play it? Well, they didn’t call him Draco Lucius Malfoy for nothing. Well, okay they did, but that was besides the point. Activating Draco’s inner Ravenclaw! “You don’t believe me do you? Are you an inbred? Spiders are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and their really fucking hairy.” He commented pointedly.
A large part of him knew that he should be spending his time trying to execute the task that the Dark Lord had so graciously set him. But right now, he suspected he cared more about dragon dung than the noseless bastards wishes.
On the sketch, her pupils were wide, full of joy, her brown hair was falling onto her face, her cheekbones were raised and strong. And her smile. Her stunning smile was larger than life, lighting up her entire face. She was the epitome of pure innocence and beauty.
But that wasn’t the case anymore.
A thoughtful look passed her face as she gave him a goofy grin. “What about you?” she prodded.
She looked up at him in concern. “Draco..” she stared.
He looked up at his father with tearful eyes, “I’m not fine.” He admitted, his heart threatening to explode.
A single tear slipped down his cheek. And all he wanted in that moment was one thing. One person. He wanted Potter. He wanted
Draco hated himself. He hated that he’d let his guard down. That he’d been naïve enough to feed into Potter’s words. To be vulnerable with him, to almost open up to him. He’d been a fool.
, gone. All because he’d been set an impossible task that he couldn’t fulfil.
He tutted, “The essence of Insanity.” Draco answered calmly.
“Hello Draco.” Luna chirped as he sat down next to her. She looked better than she had a few days ago, brighter, fuller even.
If the Dark Lord thought him complacent, then he'd become expendable. And if he was expendable, well... he didn't want to think about that.
But what he did know, what he so desperately knew was that Potter made him happy. Whenever he smile, whenever he spoke, every glance, every touch, Draco found himself being submerged deeper into everything that was Potter.
She laughed, “no need for the pleasantries, we’re family. It’s about time we met.” She gave him a wide grin, “and this is Teddy.” She gestured to the small child, who waved shyly, his little eyes sparkling. “He’s a little tired right now, but I can already tell that he likes you. He doesn’t wave for just anyone, you know.” She remarked.He felt his cheeks growing warm at the statement, “well, I think I like you too.” He said lovingly at Teddy who gave him a huge smile in return.
She came to an abrupt stop once she lay eyes on him, “Oh…Draco.” She murmured pulling him into a tight squeeze. He let himself fall into her grasp, wallowing in his own self pity.
“Just get to the damn point.” Draco spat.
Potter carried on. “All I can do is keep you close and carry on showing you how much I care about you. And I care about you so much.” He said earnestly. “I keep on thinking that this is all a dream. That one day I’ll wake up and you’ll be gone. And it scares me. Because your it for me Draco. I’ll never feel this for anyone else but you. You’ve completely ruined me.” He replied, gently.
Harry paused for a moment, digesting everything she had to say. He supposed that she wasn’t entirely wrong. Draco still loved him; Harry was sure of it. He’d just forgotten.
Pansy stopped abruptly as she laid eyes on him, “Oh Draco.” She whispered bringing him into a tight squeeze. “It’s okay, it’s going to be okay. I’m here. I’m here.” She soothed running her fingers through his hair gently.
Potter moaned as he arched into Draco’s touch, “and I love you doing that.” He gasped out. “But do you know what I like better?” he asked flirtatiously.
Draco glared at her. “And I like it when you’re quiet.” He deadpanned. Do you know what Draco wanted? Sleep.
It had been a few days since the death of Kat, and he hadn’t cried since. He didn’t need to scream, nor shout, no, he didn’t have time for that. He didn’t have time to feel. If we all stopped and let every little misfortune break us, then where would we be?
And Harry had lost him.
Potter shifted in his seat, “I want to believe that it’s because you’ve changed. That it’s because you’re different now. But I can’t.” he admitted, and Draco's heart sunk.
That sounded like a good plan Draco decided, before he spun on his heel and got the hell out of there.
So, with shaky fingers, he sat down, and he wrote.
Part of him winced at his words. They were harsh, even for him. But, sadly you could take the boy out of Slytherin but you could
Draco felt horrible. It truly sounded like a wonderful idea. From a group of Hufflepuff first years following him around as if he were some hero, the group had transformed into a sanctuary for all those who needed acceptance. Kat would’ve loved it.
To Draco’s utter surprise, his father started to chuckle. “Of course, I am. I’m absolutely furious.” He said and Draco’s face fell. “Not because you’re gay, but because you’re dating Potter. My son, a
Didn’t Potter realise that it was rude to follow his alders? If Draco had to guess, and a guess it was because he didn’t know. He’d guess that Potter was 56 days younger than him. Not that exactly, because he definitely didn’t
Is this how it felt to let your child roam free in the wild? This was horrible. Why did people do this?
to understand that.” He said judgingly.
Theo came to an abrupt stop, lifting Draco’s chin to face him. “Draco, you seriously don’t know how gorgeous you are.” Theo beamed, “Well, let me inform you.” He said matter-of-factly. “You. Are. So. Fucking. Gorgeous!” he exclaimed.
Draco stared at him for several seconds. His black curls were messier than usual. His eyes were greener and brighter then he’d ever seen them. His oversized pyjamas hung effortlessly to his golden skin which glowed in the moonlight. How the hell did Potter manage to still look so good this late into the evening?
“I waited for you.” Draco told him quietly.
“What’s been going on with you lately?” Theo asked, his voice laced with concern.
It was now one day before he’d be boarding the Hogwarts express, and be on his way to Hogwarts. He was nervous. He was really, really nervous. He’d spent most of the summer cooped up in the Manor, except from the many Weasley family dinners that he had attended.
“Did your parents divorce?” she questioned innocently. “My parents divorced a year ago and it made me cry.” She started and Draco gave her a sad look.
He didn’t want this. He didn’t bloody well ask for this. He just wanted to be free. Free from the expectations. Free from the guilt. Free from the pain. Free to be Draco. Not Draco Lucius Malfoy. No. Just
“Besides,” Potter carried on, “No one declines Mrs Weasley’s food.” He narrowed his eyes at Draco, “
Potter gasped and Draco held his breath. Inside was two pieces of paper. One was a sketch of Potter and himself by the lake, looking up at the stars in awe. It was the moment that Potter had told Draco about his parents, and the moment that everything had changed. It captured the moment that Draco felt safe, free, like he belonged.

Since the Astronomy scene used some quotes from the Sixth Book I wanted to put in another Disclaimer: I do NOT own Harry Potter. I mean would I really have deprived the world of Drarry if I did? Spoiler.... NOPE!
Before him lay a sketch of a smiling girl. Her eyes were wide with wonder, her smile was vibrant and pure. She looked carefree, beautiful, alive…
He gasped. “Hermione?” he whispered in disbelief, edging closer towards the crying girl.
“Why are you always fucking ignoring me?” he questioned desperately. “Can’t you see that it hurts?” he cried, and Draco froze.
She shook her head viciously. “Don’t you
Hermione was screaming and crying in sheer agony. “Stop, please stop.” She begged as his aunt carved the words
different, Luna.” He said honestly.
Hermione chuckled. “Who knew Hufflepuff first-years could be so daunting.” She commented and Draco froze. Ah! Her first mistake
“I’ve done something terrible. I carry it with me all day, every day. It serves as a scar. A reminder. Of what I am. Of what I’ll never be. Of whom I’ll always be.” Potter’s eyes shone with fresh tears. “I wish I could say that I didn’t want to do it. That I was forced. But the truth is, I wasn’t. I thought I was being brave. I thought I was making my father proud. But I wasn’t. I never have. I don’t think I ever will.”
In fact, he had just finished writing a letter to Potter. He had been desperate. He needed someone to listen. Anyone.
“A second chance.” She breathed out, a single tear escaping from her grasp. “Before we only knew today. We knew then then, and the right now. We knew strength. We knew how to fight. We were well acquainted with the present.” She carried on unwavering.
“I don’t know Harry. I really don’t know.” She whispered as she started to pull Harry away both her and Weasley shooting Draco and apologetic glance before leaving.
Draco smirked at the baffled Death Eater, “do you believe me now?”
“Whatever for?” he questioned.
“Stop!” A voice yelled, and Draco turned to face no other than Neville Longbottom. His face was bloody, his clothes were ripped and torn.
“Well I have, ever since I was young. I still do.” He mused. “I didn’t really have anyone when I was younger. My family don’t like me all that much.” He admitted and Draco’s heart broke a little for him.
Ah, revenge was sweet.
She nodded. “You were. Oh god, Draco you were.” She gave his hand a little squeeze, “sixth year wasn’t the best for you, as you know. But every time you came back from your little nights with Potter, you were lighter. You’d be smiling ear to ear, and you were no longer the boy destined for misery. You were free.” Pansy stood up and pulled him into a tight hug.
She smiled up at Draco, “I think that it’s brave to do all the wrong things, but for all the right reasons.”
Draco took a deep breath, “Ms Pritchett?” he asked hesitantly. His mind whirling with anticipation, as he feared for what he was about to do.
! What would a Gryffindor do? What would a Gryffindor do? “Erm…” he started nervously, “I saw a spider?” he questioned more than he stated. A spider. Really? Ron Weasley would be proud.
“I need it.” Potter gasped, pulling Draco from his thoughts. “I need

Draco turned to face the beautiful, kind girl. “Do I like them?” he asked giving her the biggest smile he could muster. “
“I am hard on you. Not because I don’t care for you. But because I don’t just want you to survive. I want you to
Potter smiled at him before handing him a neatly wrapped present. Draco’s fingers shook as he carefully unwrapped the present to find a ring attached to a necklace. He gasped, his hands flying to his mouth.
Not a moment too soon, another cry came from behind the pillar. It was louder this time, more distressed.
Kat beamed. “Were you listening to what I was just saying?” she queried. Truthfully, he hadn't heard one word of what she'd just said.
Draco cringed, imagining his father’s face if he ever found out that not only had his son ventured into muggle London, but he was also using muggle art appliances. He shuddered, silently praying that he’d never have to find out.
Madam Pomfrey chuckled. “Oh yes, you appear to be quite popular.” She remarked before pulling back the curtains.
“You saved me.” He whispered quietly.
She clapped her hands excitedly before picking up a large gift bag from the floor and plonking it down to the table.
. After all, he was the one putting his blood, sweat, and tears into wrapping these presents.
It was all too much. He wasn’t supposed to feel like this. Potter wasn’t meant to make him feel this way. So, Draco did the only thing he could do.
His features lit up. “Oh, thank you, Mr Malfoy, sir.” He said enthusiastically.
Draco was just about to correct him when a shout came from outside the hospital door.
that.
of the damn time.
And that’s after the rest of them had scurried off back to the Hufflepuff table when Snape had reprimanded them for overcrowding.
It was nice.
Kat shook her head in annoyance, “you have got to stop lying to me Draco.” She bit out. “If you do, then I can’t help you.” she said so earnestly that Draco couldn't help but give her something.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “Nice try.” She started. “What I’d like to do is leave. So, if you excuse me.” She tried to move but Blaise shot a sticking charm at her.
His father growled. “You know exactly what I mean. I raised you better than this.” He snarled.
She shook her head, her eyes brimming with tears. “I do Draco. I do.” She repeated.
Stupid, stupid Hufflepuff’s. Make friends with the Hufflepuff’s Draco. They’re lovely, Draco. Their friendship
“Draco?” another voice said.
But, he didn't. No, he had much more pressing matters to put his time and energy into.
With a sigh, Draco ripped open one of the presents to find a large black sketchbook. He gasped, a hand flying up to cover his mouth.
Instead he was lost. Broken. Engulfed in a path of devastation. He’d realised he had never truly felt pride. Nor loyalty.
She shook her head. “That’s not what I’m afraid of.” She told him, and Draco gave her a confused look. Wasn’t making friends the number one thing that children were afraid of when starting a new school. Wow, how times had changed.
I’m helping a friend out.” He snapped. He'd had enough. Seriously, he'd had it up to
Maybe he was a little bit on the dramatic side. But what did that matter? All the best people were.
He also couldn’t comprehend his sudden obsession with Potter. How he was drawn to Potter, or the sudden feelings he had for Potter. It was if they had come out of nowhere.
Draco shook his head, taking a hesitant step towards her. “I’m not going to hurt you; I promised didn’t I?” he tried his best to shoot her a reassuring smile.
Why did the paper fold like that? Why were all the ribbons torn? Where the fuck did he put all the glitter? Why were there so many colours? No, seriously who thought it was a good idea to print numerous colours of the same bloody thing?
When Draco entered his dorm, he walked straight to his bed, but instead of climbing atop of it, he crawled under it.
Blaise shook his head, “No you’re not, but that’s okay.” He reassured. “Anyways, please think about giving Theo a chance. I think he’d be good for you.”
And what was the
Toilet? He could share her toilet. In order to do that he'd need to be dead, and if Draco was dead then... he shivered, he didn't want to think about that.
“I’ve lost him.” he sobbed into her shoulder, crying harder than he thought humanly possible. “I’ve really lost him.” he almost whispered.
“What are you doing here?” a frilly voice spat.
Draco’s heart stopped. Potter’s lips were chapped, the warmness of them igniting a fire within him. Their lips fit perfectly together. Mashing together in a surge of power and dominance. Potter kissed like he fought. Assertive and with a bout of passion.
Potter shook his head. “No, you didn’t, you called it a toasterer.” he said again and Draco wanted to chop his balls off. He would've done it most definitely. It was just now he had formed an attachment with Potter's balls that he didn't plan on severing any time soon.
“No.” she said abruptly as she stood up to face him. Draco looked up baffled, as he stared into defiant eyes. “She will stay here. With you.” She said determinedly.
Potter had gone round the bend.
Draco narrowed his eyes at his friend, “I’m not miserable, I’m simply just detached.” He countered, secretly hating how pathetic that sounded.
He kept his gaze firmly fixed onto the ground below, his father was urging him to join them. He wouldn’t go. He’d never join the Dark Lord’s side. Not after what he does. After what he had done.
Reluctantly, he pulled away. “Goodnight Kat.” He gave her a small nod.
She smiled. “He was so scared. He ran away like a big fat coward.” She preened and Draco couldn’t help but chuckle.
Pansy eyed him sceptically. “Really? Because you’re acting like a child. This is certainly not Daddy behaviour.” She teased, whilst putting one of her fat hands onto his shoulder.
Draco felt his heart stop, the name sending shivers down his spine. “I’m fine.” He said simply as he attempted to come across emotionless.
Hermione sighed. “I know but—”
Potter shrugged. “It’s been almost two weeks Malfoy, are you still not going to speak to me?” he asked.
Draco shot her a comical glance, “no disrespect, but this is the last fucking place I want to be.” He assured her before walking out of the room.
Draco had accepted.
“But mum, I just wanted to try the chicken.” Weasley moaned.
Hermione looked at him pleadingly. “Don’t for one-minute think it’s because we think you’re not good enough for him, because it’s not.” She assured him, completely ignorant.
Pomfrey sighed in defeat, “Fine, you may leave. But don’t let me see you in this hospital ward again anytime soon.” she warned.
Weasley shook his head, “why are you looking at
Draco held her tight. “Well you’re the kindest, sweetest most beautiful person I’ve ever met, and I’m happy to call you my best friend.” He answered.
Gently, Potter pulled the ring from its chain, before letting it drop to the floor. Now, holding two rings in his hands he muttered a charm and Draco watched in amazement as the two rings fused together to form one.
Draco nodded. “I understand perfectly, but I like my Hufflepuff’s and I’m keeping them.” He said firmly.
He smiled. “I like to think that they’re up there, watching over me. That they’ll always to be there to guide me and protect me. That no matter where I am, at night I’ll always be able to see them. A bit like their love for me, I may not be able to feel it, but I know it’s there. Always.”
Blaise smiled. “In that case, there’s a couple of Gryffindor’s waiting outside for you. They said it was important.” He informed and Draco nodded.
So maybe, just maybe Draco finally understood what Blaise had meant when the Hufflepuff's had started a coup. Although he was proud of his Hufflepuff's, he had to be honest, part of him was secretly glad he'd been confined to a coma during their little upheaval. They were terrifying.
Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Draco cut him off. “I’m not a good person. No, I’m a terrible person. I’m giving you a way out. A chance to find someone special. To find someone better than I am. Someone who isn’t a disgusting Death Eater. Someone who isn’t me. Go. Just go.” Draco ordered sadly.
Both Weasley and Hermione gave him pleading looks. “I’m sick of this! I’m sick of everyone interfering, thinking that they know what’s best for me.” He carried on, “well newsflash, none of you bloody well do.” He seethed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter nodded; his eyes wide. “I’m alive.” he reassured Draco stepping closer towards him, and his stomach started to churn. “So are you. Oh, Draco I was so scared. I was terrified that you wasn’t going to make it. That I wasn’t going to make it. But we’re here. We’re alive.” he sighed out in pure relief.
The rest of the Slytherin sixth years had gone home for Christmas leaving him without anyone. Pansy, Blaise, Theo and surprisingly Weasley, had offered for Draco to spend Christmas with them, but Draco had politely declined. It just didn’t feel right to spend Christmas with anyone who wasn’t his mother.
Her eyes lit up with glee and Draco pulled out her present out of his Santa bag.
that. Stupid git said he had to do something so he’d not coming back till tomorrow.” Weasley bit out in frustration. He furrowed his eyebrows, “don’t try and distract me.” He turned to Pansy and Blaise, “I expect a handwritten apology by tomorrow.” He simply stated.
Potter smiled, observing Draco with interest. After several seconds he took a deep breath. “Have you ever thought of the world?” he asked.
Kat moved closer towards him, whispering in his ear, “Daddy’s new girlfriend doesn’t wear a lot of clothes.” She mumbled secretively.
She nodded. “Yes, but what does that have anything to do with it?” she eyed him sceptically.
Potter huffed. “For fucks sake Malfoy. I’m speaking to you.” Really? Draco mused. He hadn’t bloody well noticed.
Theo was waiting for him outside, a chirper smile on his face. Draco wanted to wipe that smile right off his face. He didn’t deserve kindness. He should suffer. He needed to suffer.
“You think?” Draco deadpanned.
“You should hate him.” she said simply. “You should absolutely hate him.” she urged him, and Draco wanted to scream.
“It’s obvious that you want to do something awful to her. What would Draco sodding Malfoy want with a Muggleborn first year? You won’t get away with it, you git. I’ll make sure of it.”
He’d taken the final step to a life with Potter. The rest was in Potter’s hands now. his stomach lurched with anticipation, love, and relief, as he absently realised that he never did see that blue rubber duck.
Now he knew why.
Draco sighed. “Yes, yes you can be shallow later.” He muttered distractedly, jumping up from his bed and put the last present in a giant red and white velvet bag. “I have some presents to deliver.” He said determinedly.
Potter took them hesitantly, bafflement dusting his features. “What are these?” he asked.
Draco’s eyes widened in fear. “No. No. No. No.” he raked a hand through his hair anxiously. “I need him Pans. I need him so much.” he begged her, clutching the hem of her robe tight.
He sighed closing his eyes firmly. “Good, now close your eyes and think about what your future would be.”  She started and Draco attempted to imagine his future. She carried on, “is it long? Is it short? Is it everything that you could possibly want?” She asked.
Draco kept on walking; the battle was still going on with full force. He was blocking and shooting hexes at every turn, as he made his way through the destruction.
“What shall I do?”
“So, I followed you. I realised that you spent every night by the lake, so I made sure that I was there. I convinced myself that it was because I thought that you were up to something. And maybe part of me thought that you were. But another part of me, a  bigger part of me just wanted to get to know you. To understand this new Draco that everyone seemed to like.” He admitted, and
“I can’t.” Draco whispered.
She cried. Pulling him into another embrace. They stayed like that for several minutes, seeking comfort in one another before Draco pulled away.
He gave his friend a pleading look, “the Dark Lord wants to be the one to finish him. It’s his right, we can’t take that away.”
“I’ll come with you.” Theo offered.
Macmillan snorted and Draco blinked. He’d forgotten about Macmillan. How disappointing. Well, if you’re looking for someone who’s even more irrelevant than Neville bloody Longbottom, than Macmillan is your guy.
The Headmaster nodded. “Are you sure that you wouldn’t like a lemon drop?” he asked, gesturing to the bowl.
His aunt hit him again. And he felt worse. If that was even possible. His mother’s screams and his father’s cries were echoing throughout the room. They were pleading, no begging, for his aunt to stop such a ludicrous act. He tried to listen to them, to lose himself in the sound of their voices. But all he could hear was the blood pounding in his ears.
Bloody coward.
“I didn’t, I’m the reason. It was me. It was all me.” He cried out in complete agony.
“But Slytherins don’t like Hufflepuff's.” She stated as she shifted slightly.
He sighed. “I really don’t want to talk about it.” he muttered, hoping that she would take the bait and leave.
“The world has
Draco grinned before picking up his appliance and following Potter out.
“Touché.” Weasley supplied and an awkward silence befell them.
Tears were falling freely as he set down a single white rose onto the mound. “You made me happy. You will always make me so, so happy.” He finished before holding the ring that hung from his neck close, as he let his grief take over.
Tell her. Bloody
“When are we going to work on our project?” he questioned and Draco grimaced. If looks could kill, Weasley would be six feet under by now. Draco inwardly smiled at the correct use of the muggle phrasing that Kat had taught him earlier. Anyways, Draco had just managed to forget the project he’d been told of just moments ago, and now Weasley was idiotic enough to bring it up again. What was with all the rude Gryffindor's today?
Severus nodded smugly. “I thought not.” He snarled. “The Dark Lord fears that you are becoming complacent.” He remarked and Draco felt something close to dread start to build within him.
Draco still loves you.” She breathed out.
He must be in hell. That must be it!
There’d been so many times where he was sure that he was ready to give up. He knew the feeling; he knew it all too well. When he was just waiting. Waiting to get home, to get to his room, close the door, fall onto bed, and just let out all that he’d been keeping in. The feeling of both relief and pure desperation. Where nothing was wrong, but nothing was right either. When he’s tired. Tired of everything, tired of nothing. Just wanting someone to be there and tell him that it was okay.
He knew from their tired smiles that something was wrong. That something was going to happen. He made his way towards them, with something acute to dread pooling in his stomach.
Draco took a deep breath. “I used to admire you. I used to think you were wonderful. That you were so powerful. You were my hero.” He admitted solemnly. “I even took this bloody mark for you. Because I believed you. Because I looked up to you. Because I wanted to make you proud.” He choked out.
lost. They’d all lost. It was over, it was all over because Potter was dead.
He became absently aware of the new presence next to him, but he played it no mind. Instead, he focused on his sketch.
“And why’s that?” he asked in amusement.
Potter carried on, “But after a while. Those nights. Well, those nights became everything to me.” He reminisced. “They became an escape. A place to hide. To get away from a world that only saw me as their saviour. I was free to be Harry.
The love he felt for Potter was so intense he had no idea how he’d ever come to feel it. He may never remember how he’d come to feel it. But before he gave himself wholly to Potter, he had to understand
“Babbling.” Draco growled, cutting him off promptly, he really didn't have time for this.
A few of the girls sighed in agreement.
In all the 'excitement' he should say, he'd never stopped to think how his accident could've emotionally impacted the Hufflepuff's.
Draco glared at him, “ask sodding Smith if you really want to know.”
They’d protect them both.
Pansy pulled away after several moments and sat back down, she took a deep breath. “Then seventh year began and you were shadow of the person you had been around Potter. I tried mentioning him once..” she started and Draco’s breath hitched.
“Oh,” Kat said dejectedly whilst pulling out a neatly wrapped square box, “I’m sorry about the cauldron.” She handed him the present. “This isn’t a cauldron, but I hope you like it.” she muttered shyly.
“I gave this to you almost two years ago.” He began and Draco’s heart started to beat rapidly within his chest.
Macmillan rubbed his palms on his robes nervously. “I wanted to say that I was sorry.” He repeated a little louder this time.
Hermione pulled away glaring at him, and Draco had the sinking feeling that he was in trouble. “How
“NO!” he shouted rounding his wand onto his friend. He had to protect Potter. He had to keep him safe. It was the only way.
Draco was sitting at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall when the Malfoy family owl landed right in front of him.
Potter let out a scoff. “What’s wrong with you Malfoy?” he asked, “why won’t you answer me?” Draco remained silent.
A softie! she'd be calling him a Hufflepuff next. Wait...
“Unfortunately.” Weasley muttered before focusing his gaze on the potion in front of them.
So, that's it! 'The Draco Malfoy Incident' is officially over! I just wanted to take the time to thank each and every last of you for your continued support, it allowed me to finish the fic. So, thank you! I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed writing!! :) :) :)
Granger shook her head. “No, I don’t think so.” She considered. “We’ve been talking for quite a bit of time, and not once have you said anything insulting or aggressive.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up to his hairline. “What?” he choked out in surprise.
He had finished fixing the vanishing cabinet.
die. And I will not let that happen.” He said firmly.
He had to protect her. He had to bare the burden of responsiblity by himself.
Draco felt Potter abruptly being pulled off him, his arms replaced with stronger ones. “Foolish boy.” Someone snapped, but Draco was too far gone to even attempt to recognise who it was.
“Nothing.” he simply told her. Because
That had to be the most
He couldn’t let anything happen to Potter, not after what he’d admitted just moments before. He loved him. Harry Potter
She locked eyes with Draco, and he gave a small reassuring nod. She continued, “But now, now we get to experience
something was terribly wrong. That’s how we knew that you still loved Potter, but somehow, you’d forgotten how you’d fallen in love with him.” Draco didn’t know what to say. How hadn’t he realised his friends had known this, that they’d felt like this?

Blaise shook his head. “Can’t a guy check up on his best friend? Or are you too pretentious, even for little old me?” he joked.
?” she spat out exasperatedly, “Draco your mini temper tantrums put Snape to shame.” Putter old Snape to shame... he could get on board with that.
Weasley groaned. “Listen Ferret and listen closely. I don’t like you; I really don’t like you. But I’m willing to work with you because despite what many people might think, I actually care about my grades.”
with you.” Mrs Weasley bellowed out and Draco froze.
She nodded frantically. “Yes, you are. I never said that I would die my hair Hufflepuff purple, that would be atrocious.” She laughed and he whole heartedly agreed, “Anyways, I’m quite partial to Slytherin green.” she told him and his ears immediately perked up.
Well, he didn’t think that he wanted to be a Malfoy anymore. He admitted as he allowed the tears to softly fall.
It was an unusual romance, one that no one had seen coming, One that he hadn't even seen coming. But now that he had it, now that it existed, he found himself never wanting to let it go.
His daughter too, let out a throaty laugh, “grandpa’s silly, isn’t he?” she stated and Draco couldn’t help but nod, because yes, his father was very, very silly.
Blaise tutted. “Now, now Draco. Let’s not get stroppy.” and Draco
He had always been and will always be a victim of his environment. Why did he have to live a life that others had dictated for him? Why couldn't he just be free?
Well, that was all going to change. Draco suddenly felt a protective urge wash over him, “why are you telling me this?” he snapped out.
The Weasley twin laughed, “I’ve missed you Malfoy. Harry has too. He’s been a complete mess after you rescued them back at the end of your sixth year.” He mused.
Draco brought an embarrassed hand to his face as his father continued. “And whilst I may appreciate your quidditch opinions, I do
Maybe, just
“But—” he choked out a sob.
“Woah, Draco it looks like someone died in here!” Blaise drawled dramatically.
Draco shrugged, “but Potter isn’t here.” He countered.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “is that right?” he mused.
His mother had always been so strong. A visionary, filled with hope. Now she was defeated, giving into the darkness that threatened to submerge them all.
she would be safe with you. But she’d be safer at home where the Death Eater’s can’t find her.” she said rationally.
Draco sighed; he had work to do.
“Yeah!” a boy cheered. “No should dare to hurt Draco and just
is that supposed to mean?” he asked in threat, and Draco couldn't bring himself to try and even care.
he felt.
He needed to be alone. He needed to get his emotions in check before attempting to deal with the cabinet again. And he
Draco smiled at her. “But
But he didn’t.
Oh hell, Draco mused. What were the little mixes up to
Potter shook his head. “What have I done?” he howled. “What have I done?” he repeated deliriously.
Something deep inside of him told him to run towards it. That he needed to get to the source, no matter what.
okay?”
It was an adventure that was needed. He had to let go for a while. To forget about everything, while he still could.
“NOOO!” He shrieked, crawling towards his best friend. He dragged him broken body along, ignoring the sheer agony of it. That didn’t matter, none of it mattered. He was close, so, so close. He didn’t care what he had to do. What he had to endure. As long as she remained safe.
Theo shook his head, “You haven’t said yes or no.” Draco opened his mouth to correct him but was abruptly cut off. “If I were you I’d keep your mouth shut.” He warned, and Draco decided that keeping his mouth shut seemed like a pretty good idea.
Pansy hummed, “Maybe they just see you for the big old softie we all know that you are.” She joked and Draco wanted to bite her head off.
Draco melted into the kiss. It was fierce, desperate, and needy. It was tangy and sweet, expressing all that they couldn’t find the words to say. It was passionate but refined. Slow but long.
He gave her an amused look, “And what
Wow, you know what they say, if you want something done, then you have to fucking do it yourself.
He hummed. “I’m glad.” He locked his fingers into Draco’s messy hair. “We have to get up soon, we have to get to the Weasley’s for lunch.” He sighed dejectedly and Draco knew know he felt.
Blaise laughed. “What are we going to do with you Draco?”
“I know I’ve been horrible to you. There’s no excuse for it. I’ve been a real git.” He attempted. “You don’t deserve it. You don’t deserve any of it.” he admitted. Couldn't he see. Didn't Potter understand? He did deserve it. He couldn't begin to explain how much he deserved it.
Weasley’s eyes softened. “You and I both know that whatever your relationship is, it’s not friendship.” he gave him a pointed look that Draco couldn't help but disagree with.
“Daddy Draco.” Pansy purred. “I like it.” she grinned at him mischievously.
He’d felt it the second the Dark Lord had succumbed to the darkness. The dark mark had let out a tiny surge of power, it was miniscule, but the shock was indeed noticeable. It was almost poetic, a mark destined to radiate an abundance of power, reduced to nothing at it’s Lord’s demise.
They were content.
to be.
another living, breathing human being. And it was his aunt at that. He’d killed his own blood.
Why couldn't he be himself? Why did he barely know who that was? Why did it hurt so much?
Smith howled. “Who would’ve thought it? Draco Malfoy so much of a coward that he needs a few first years to do his bidding. How pathetic.” He insulted.
He was nearing the dungeons when he heard a small cry come from one of the pillars. He blinked before carrying on with his pursuit towards the dungeons. He reasoned that it was probably a ghost or something.
Draco looked up and gathered all the strength he had left. “Then wait for me.” He urged Potter. “I know what we have is real. I can feel it. I don’t think that I could live the rest of my life with anyone else who wasn’t you. But we can’t be together. Not yet. Not like this.” He finally admitted, because it was true.
But then that would be a lie.
But despite everything. Despite the insults, the disappointment, and the doubt, he had become Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter at age nineteen. It had been the best decision that he had ever made.
Severus narrowed his eyes at him. “You act like you didn’t almost die a few days ago.” He pointed out, like Draco didn't already know that.
, it was.
be attending today. And you
He could feel his resolve start to crumble. It wasn't fair! Why did this always happen to him? Why couldn't he just be normal. He wouldn't even mind being a muggle. They seemed so loving, so carefree. It sounded like a life that would benifit him greatly.
Well, that was just adorable. He thought that this night couldn't get any better, obviously he was wrong. He normally didn't like being wrong. But in moments like these, he couldn't say that he minded all that much.
Draco rolled his eyes trying to put up a brave front. “That cabinet is nearly impossible to fix, and do you know how bloody hard it is to kill one of the supposed greatest wizards of all time.” he supplied almost truthfully.
“What do you think you’re doing Malfoy?” he spat out menacingly.
He smiled with glee pulling out a purple badge from his pocket and pinning it to the Death Eater’s robe, ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ it read. He was still a Slytherin after all.
He could see it now, being followed around the school grounds by a purple Hufflepuff. Well, that just wouldn't do. He'd have to charm her hair back when she wasn't looking.
Draco blushed, feeling hot under his gaze. “If Draco will have me?” Theo said, staring at Draco expectantly.
He sighed, “Perhaps they were right, you should stay away from me.” He put his clammy hands into the pockets of his robes. “I’m not a good person.” He added for good measure.
It had all been ripped from him in a blink of an eye.
Blaise looked positively offended, “us? You want
there’s something wrong. Please Draco just tell me what’s wrong, I’m your best friend.” She pleaded and what was left of Draco’s heart broke for her.
When Draco entered the Great Foyer, he felt sick. There were bodies
Potter scoffed. “You started making friends with first-year Hufflepuff's. You made a friend in Ron and Hermione. Everyone got to have a piece of this new Draco. Everyone except me. And I was confused. I was so confused. I didn’t know why I cared. Why it mattered so much.” He sighed.
“Yes, it does.”
“Do you find the painful death that the Dark Lord is planning for you funny?” He asked and Draco's blood ran cold.
She wasn’t allowed to be dead.
He took a breath of relief, sealing away the last letter that he would ever write. It was as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Draco still hadn’t made a decision, but he knew that he was one step closer to making the right one.
He remembered how that conversation had gone. Draco had been more frustrated than ever. He felt alone, abandoned, as if a chunk of him was missing but he hadn’t known what. Now he realised that that piece had been Potter, but back then he hadn’t known that.
Draco took a calm breath. “I’m not crazy, Nathan.” He attempted, to reason with the quivering boy.
“What’s going on with you Draco?” she asked, her voice laced with concern.
So, nothing was wrong. He had to believe that was true. He just had to. Or else he feared he'd go insane.
“NO!” she screamed abruptly standing up and walking up to him in threat. “Don’t you dare come into
It was all too much. Far, far too much. Draco felt his throat close up, he was gasping for breath. Grabbing for life.
She shivered. “I’m grateful too. But why does this feel like goodbye?” she asked her eyes filling with tears.
He sneaked a peak below him, and sure enough, Crabbe was following him up the stack and he figured that Goyle was climbing up the mound beside him. They’d be okay, he thought briefly.
“Mr Malfoy.” Snape characteristically drawled. “If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a moment alone with you outside.”
The Weasley twins coughed. “Oh so, Dark Young one” they said at the exact same time.
Draco ignored him, focusing his attention on the lake before him.
Draco hoped that one day he could be happy. He was tired of this temporary happiness. He wanted to feel truly happy. Without the weight of the world weighing down his every step. Without having to think of moves and countermoves. Without all of the lies and deceit. Just happy. Draco wanted to feel only happiness.
It was the first time he’d been to Diagon Alley in months. After that talk with Pansy, Draco reasoned that he need to think. And a stuffy manor full of uncomfortable memories wasn’t the best place to do that.
“We don’t like you.” Kat spat at Smith, the other Hufflepuff's nodding in agreement.
He reasoned that no one would ever live up to Kat's level. Oh well, what a shame. Kat was going to be single forever. How very, very sad.
So, it began.
was unexpected.
Weasley shot him a confused look. “Why do you say that?” he questioned sceptically.
“Draco?” a voice asked, the person in question sitting down next to him.
The rest of the battle had taken place with thankfully minimal losses. It was if Potter’s fantastical emergence when times had looked bleak, had given the light a newfound strength. Everyone was more determined than ever, hurtling hexes, shooting jinxes, and throwing curses like there was no tomorrow. Draco muses that if the Dark had won, then there wouldn’t have been much point in tomorrow.
“I swear to Merlin Draco I
“But at least we’d be together.” He pleaded with Draco.
Potter came back the next night.
“Let’s try something different.” He offered his friends; he took a deep breath. “Okay… ONE, TWO, THREE….. TALK!” he shouted encouragingly. They remained silent.
He opened his eyes wider, almost excitedly as he took in surroundings. His heart dropped a little as he saw himself in an unfamiliar place. His heart plummeted even further when his eyes fixated on none other than Harry bloody Potter.
During the day Potter acted as if Draco was worthless, as if he were nothing. He laughed at the jabs Weasley threw at him during potions, he smiled when Draco was hexed. He rolled his eyes when Draco spoke, he growled whenever he was around friends.
Draco’s eyes widened as the chatting in the Great Hall came to an abrupt stop, everyone’s eyes were on them.
are you talking about?” he stated as if Theo were crazy.
“You’re coming to the end of your book.” She carried on, gesturing to his nearly empty sketchbook. “Are you going to get a new one?”
“Me too. Me too, sweet girl.” He mumbled into her shoulder. “But I swear that when you see me again, it’ll be as if no time has gone by at all.” he reassured her.
Jerry nodded mutely, and Draco shoot him a vicious mile. “Good.” He carried on, “anyways, I need them for my Muggle class project.” he lied through his pearly white teeth, hoping they wouldn't ask any questions.
Potter shook his head. “Why did you do that? How could you do that?” he spat out. “I trusted you!” he screamed.
He smiled, this was going to be fun. “Well, I could never do it. Mercilessly murder those chickens. Spend years upon years with mud up to my eyeballs. Don’t even get me started on the sweaty factories, the time and effort just to check one chicken. And all for minimal pay.” Draco droned; he was lying through his pert arse of course.
“Certain.” He assured her. “Well, why don’t you go back to the Hufflepuff table. I probably wont be returning anytime soon.” He offered and she nodded.
“Malfoy?” a deep voice asked and Draco whipped his head round in alarm.
about a girl?
He had to tell her the truth, it was the only option. And maybe, just
The Dark Lord was dead.
He couldn't possibly believe that. Draco Lucius Malfoy, the esteemed Slytherin Prince giving up the password. To a Gryffindor at that. No, he just wouldn't accept it.
Pansy had carried on, “So, is this, or is this not all your fault, because you’re a stubborn little git?” she asked smugly, to which Draco had replied with a simple “Fuck you”.
“Malfoy!” a tight voice called and Draco sighed, couldn’t a man catch a break around here?
“Murder!” Myrtle screamed as she thrashed around in the air frantically.
was dangerous.
It wasn't that he didn't want to go with Potter, of course he waned to go with him. But he couldn't. Not after what he was about to do. As much as it broke him, this thing with Potter had an expiration date.
“Why would I be?” he asked Kat.
“Five points from Slytherin for such poor language.” He tutted before carrying on with the lesson.
Weasley huffed, crossing his arms firmly.. “We still should have never gotten involved in the first place.” He admitted. “Whatever is going on between the both of you is absolutely mad.” he huffed out and Draco couldn't help but agree.
He would always forgive Potter. That thought used to scare him, but now it made him feel peace. It helped him to remember that he was capable of feeling anything but sadness. He felt passion. He felt need. He felt happiness.
He laughed, “I was just getting to that. Once you’ve selected the best, bring them outside the Slytherin dorms. Do you remember where they are?” he asked and she nodded.
In some twisted way, Macmillan had seemed to have grown up a little. Had become a person that he was proud of. Draco would never admit it to anyone, but he was slightly jealous of that.
It was time.
give me some bullshit about seeing Ms Pritchett. She’s not the only person in the world, it’s unhealthy.” She stated firmly and Draco promptly shut up.
How could this man before him not be Potter? Draco would always be able to spot Potter. Always.
“Draco.” A strong voice bit out, snapping him from his thoughts.
All and all, Draco thought he looked acceptable.
Draco was amazed how they could even stand to look at him. How they all managed to appear somewhat functional after all they’ve had to endure.
“Draco?” A hesitant voice asked in almost disbelief. Draco’s breath hitched as he took in the deep green eyes of Harry Potter.
He was currently in the Slytherin dorms in his bed, letting the tears fall freely. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to think. What was going on with Potter? What had Draco done to make him feel as he did?
him to say? There was nothing he could say that would make much sense at the moment, so he kept his lips firmly shut.
Just then, Smith was attacked by a flock of angry butterflies, them pecking and nabbing at his exposed skin. He screamed in pain.
Draco couldn’t quite believe it. But he wanted to believe it, he wanted to believe it so bad. He didn’t know what he had done to get Potter to love him. He couldn’t remember. He was sure that something had happened between Potter and himself. The way Potter looked at him gave him away.
“This one.” Draco excitedly said. “And this one.” He decided. “Oh, and let’s not forget about this one.” He commented throwing yet another box of chocolate on the outrageously large pile in Theo’s hands.
They’d kept in contact with Ms Pritchett over the years. She was Kat’s godmother. She had become a part of their little family. It had taken some time, but Draco could finally look at her without being riddled with guilt. It hadn’t been his fault. He knew that now.
Crabbe and Goyle. Well, Vincent and Greg as he supposed he should get used to calling them as they were his friends after all, spent the entire of transfigurations attempting to cheer him up. He’d spent the entire time trying to tell them that he was alright, but they either thought he was fine but still wanted to make him smile, or he wasn’t very convincing. Draco suspected the latter. Still, it was sweet, nevertheless.
With a choked sob, he smiled at the star and whispered, “you’ve done it. You can rest now.” he told his best friend, who’s love had saved them all.
He took it back.
Kat huffed, “that can’t be true.” She complained.
The battle had drawn to a close the moment Potter had struck down the Dark Lord with the help of a backfired
“Well, we both know how that went.” She sighed. “Blaise and I were distraught. We knew you’d be upset about losing Potter, but we never would’ve dreamed that you’d act like that. It was if somehow you resented Potter more than you loved him.” she gave him a saddened look.
When he’d reached his destination, he sat down cautiously. The Great Lake lay silently before him, reflecting the multitude of stars that lit up the nights sky.
The buzzing in the hall fell to a stop and Headmistress McGonagall took the stand, she shot Draco a small smile before she started to speak. “I would like to welcome you all for a new year at Hogwarts.” She looked at them warmly, and Draco’s heart clenched.
Mrs Weasley glared at her two boys. “Fred and George Weasley. I’d keep your mouths shut, or so help it I’ll cut of both off your tongues!” she threatened and Draco decided that he liked this woman.
Macmillan shook his head. “I can’t say.” he told him, his eyes glazing over, and Draco just
“I know you’re up to something Malfoy. I know you’ve done something to that girl. What, were your cronies not good enough that you had to settle for an innocent girl?” Potter hissed.
he feel now? He could lie. He could shake his head in defiance and say that he felt absolutely nothing towards Potter.
Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to shout NO he wasn’t choosing Theo over him. That he didn’t think that he could choose anyone over him. And that hurt. It hurt so much. It also scared him. It scared him so far to the point that he didn’t know if he could come back from it. It terrified him. It terrified him because he didn’t know why. And that was a realisation scarier than death.
He dismissed her with a wave of his hand. “No don’t give me that. I don’t want your pity.” That was the one thing he couldn't take.
worth it.
Draco pulled out the rusty tin can, before handing it to her as she disappeared in a whirl of green light.
Jerry shook his head, and finally, finally he shut the hell up.
“Good.” Severus approved, and Draco was begging to feel tired.  He just want to get away. To be anywhere else but here.
with all of us.” Piggy snarled and Draco felt a slither of admiration for the pig-like girl.
It seemed fitting. It really did, that Potter would find him when he didn't what to be found. He had a knack for seeking Draco out when he least wanted it.
“Come on Draco. Let’s kill him.” Crabbe urged and Draco felt his heart plummet.
didn't work like that.
His emotions towards Potter were all messed up. He was so confused. It was as if he’d forgotten the years they’d spent antagonising each other and now saw him as a beacon of hope. It was strong. He just felt so strongly towards Potter. He didn’t understand it.
“I’m not being stroppy.” He dropped his arms to the sides of his body dramatically.
“You’ll always have a piece of me with you.” He said sweetly and Draco looked up at him in awe, a single tear rolling down his cheek. It was beautiful. He was
And that was why Draco was currently sitting on his bed surrounded by glitter, paper and presents, silently praying that the Dark Lord would come to his senses and AK his fine arse.
To say that it had been a weird week would be a bit of an understatement. He now could honestly say that he had made friends in the Weasel and Granger. Or Weasley and Hermione as he now calls them. Between working on his potions project as well as the occasional out of class conversations with Weasley and Hermione’s and his daily library study sessions, Draco was well and truly flabbergasted. His new friendships were completely unexpected, but welcomed, nevertheless.
Anyways, the past three weeks had given him time to think, to understand and accept himself. He was still a long way off, he shifted slightly as he raised his hand to knock on the door before him, but he hoped that what he was going to do today would bring him one step closer to happiness. After all, the closer he was to salvation, the closer he would be to getting Potter back. And he wanted Potter so much.
Draco couldn’t breathe.
He nodded. “Yes, I find that extremely hard to believe. I’ve been horrible to you.” He said honestly.
Draco slapped his arm playfully, “you’re an idiot.” He laughed as he dragged himself out of bed, suddenly aware of the fact that he was stark naked. Potter eyed him hungrily.
“Were we not good enough for you? Didn’t you love us? Why did you put us in harms way? Why did you damage me so? Aren’t we enough? Why wasn’t I enough
He was ashamed to admit it, but he was glad to be free of his posy of Hufflepuff's for the minute. They were adorably unbearable. Kat he could handle, she was starting to become that of a sister to him. But with her came a whole band of excited, overbearing little Hufflepuff first years and Draco wanted to AK himself.
“So tight.” Potter gasps out as he takes hold of Draco’s wrists, pinning them above his head, as he presses into him with small, soft strokes.
Kat beamed when she saw him. “Oh, Draco! They said that you were still alive but I just didn’t believe them.” She said sadly, and his heart broke for the hundredth time that day.
“And how do you suppose we test if the potion works? Because I’m sure as hell not drinking it.” Weasley grimaced.
“Well, I don’t give a rat’s arse what you asked. Now can you please leave me alone.” He spat, before closing his eyes.
He couldn't change. He wanted to, desperately. But how could you change the person that he was always destined to be?
It hadn't been this way before the start of sixth year. Potter hadn't been acting so.. unstable. No, it had started around the same time that Draco had become more subdued.
He let out a low cough, “are you sure that’s the best idea?” he asked hesitantly.
Mr Weasley smiled, “a rubber duck, doesn’t only come in the colour yellow. No, I’ve found a
close to ripping his throat out.
Draco gave him a small smile, “Yes?” he asked.
“You didn’t stay to watch the sunrise.” He bit out with a hint of sadness. Draco looked at the ground. Rub it in Potter! Make him feel worse than he already did.
been clear enough. Sometimes he really didn't know what to do with the Hufflepuff's.
“There you go again. Ignoring me like you have been since the beginning of the year. Go on then, run away you bloody coward!” Theo spat and Draco turned on his heel.
“What’s going on in here?” Madam Pomfrey tutted, walking in briskly, shaking her head in disappointment in her wake.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t want your pity.” He snarled.
“I don’t have to tell you anything.” He hissed at her, looking determinedly at the floor.
Potter’s eyes were burning into his, them filled with determination and an unspoken sense of hope. “Why didn’t you tell them.” He asked, and Draco froze. “At the Manor, you knew it was me, but you didn’t say anything.” He challenged and Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
And he meant
In fact, it was kind of nice that he had somewhat of a friend who saw past his thoughts, or even didn't acknowledge his faults. No, she just saw him. Just
It was like nothing he had ever experienced. He didn’t know how to deal with it. How to make it make sense. He felt so little, but so much all at the same time.
Draco sighed. “I guess now that I’ve had a taste of death, I find it terribly addicting.” he sarcastically said. What the
She rolled her eyes. “You weren’t listening to a word I was saying, was you?” she chastised and Draco knew he should feel bad. He
“NO!” Draco shouted a bit to loudly and Kat’s face fell. He softened his features and sighed, “I mean, no, it’s okay, I’ll only be a few moments.” he smiled. Totally saved it!
“So, we’ve decided that the Draco Malfoy Pride can be a group where everyone is accepted and loved. A group that is also led by the man who sacrificed everything so that we could live. The pride is somewhere where we can all be safe. I thought
He stared at it in complete awe as he tried to remember why it was there in the first place.
Sulkily, Draco began to make his way towards the door. “Hold on!” Slughorn’s chirper voice ordered. Draco groaned before turning back round, “there will be
She opened her arms, hugging him close whilst she sobbed into his chest. “You’re not. You’re not. You’re not.” She droned deliriously.
Pansy gave him an almost sympathetic look, “you’re right… they’re just pathetic.” She deadpanned and Draco wanted to strangle her.
He slammed his hands to his side in annoyance. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” Draco cut in.
“I have no idea why, but I don’t quite believe you.” The Death Eater narrowed his eyes at him.
Suddenly, he heard Crabbe scream. Screw that. He had a friend to save. Frantically, he ran back towards the fire, ignoring the pleading screams that Potter sent his way.
Weasley nodded. “She’s right mate. She’s dead right.” No, she was not right. But he wasn't about to disclose that. He valued his life.
They sat in peaceful silence for a while with Draco absently aware of the warm heat rubbing off Potter. It was quite distracting.
together.”
“Go and get me some more chicken?” he asked hopefully.
Draco gave her an apologetic look. “Sorry, Blaise conveniently forgot to tell me that you were waiting out here.” He said, internally think of all the ways that Blaise could 'accidently' trip down the stairs.
It was all coming back to him. The first time he’d met Potter at the Lake. The tears he’d cried that night. The first time they’d watched the sunrise together. The first time Potter had been vulnerable with Draco. The first time Potter had broken his heart. The first time they’d made love. The first time Draco had spoken to Potter. The first time Draco had told Potter that he loved him…
Draco gave her a sharp nod. Kat beamed. “Please let me have a look.” She asked shifting closer to him. When Draco shifted away, she let out an exasperated breath, “please, please pleaseee.”
What was even more crazy is that he even missed Potter. Just the smallest, tiniest bit. He missed their jabs and taunts. He missed the sneers and the spats. He even missed Potter’s stupid greens eyes, his stupid smile, and his stupid scar. He hated that scar.
Potter scoffed. “You know what, you’re not worth it.” He growled. “You’re pathetic.” He spat before pushing past him and continuing down the corridor.
he wanted to plot each and every one of their unfortunate demises.
Suddenly, he felt a large weight slip from his fingers. His eyes snapped open, as he watched his friend plummet into the fire below, in pure horror. What had he done? He didn’t save him. He couldn’t save anyone. He couldn’t even save himself.
Blaise shook his head. “Don’t say anything, just do the right thing.” He whispered quietly, and Draco finally saw reason.
It had been nineteen years and his husband still never failed to get under his father’s skin. It was actually quite amusing to sit back and watch their relationship. It was the most peculiar thing he had ever witnessed.
Draco looked up at her with reassurance. “And I bullied him for five years. Made his life hell. Called you a mudblood. And spent my days criticising Weasley’s family.” He said. “I’m not perfect. I made mistakes. But I learnt from them, as will he.” Draco finished hoping that they'd understand where he was coming from.
Weasley sighed. “I’m sorry mate, we were just doing what we thought was right. It was unhealthy.” He started and Potter glared.
He glared at the boy, “And just what is your name?” he enquired, shooting him a sharp look.
Neville had revealed Draco’s killing of the renowned Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, slightly exaggerating that Draco’s actions had saved his life.
Then again, what kind of name was Ricky. It sounded so mundane. So normal. And Kat was anything but normal. She deserved someone that was on her level.
He’d refused to eat. He’d refused to sleep. He’d refused to talk. Everything reminded him of Draco. He saw his smile in the flowers. He saw his hair in the sun. He felt his love through the stars.
She looked terrible. Her hair was matted upon her head, her cheeks were hollow and worn, her walk had a slight limp. He had done that. He had done that to her.
Theo racked his hands through his hair, “that you haven’t given me an answer.” he pointed out and Draco was tired.
Draco nodded. “You do. You make me so, so happy.”
“Well, she’s not yours either.” Blaise said pointedly.
Why wouldn't he help her make friends. She seemed to be in a state of disbelief, so vulnerable. Draco felt almost enraged as he figured that someone must've done something to her. Someone who had made sure that friends hadn't been an option for her.
He couldn’t remember where it was from, he just knew that he could never part with it. It was a part of him. He’d rather die than leave it behind.
, I was just getting to that.” He took a deep breath. “As you know we have just over fifteen Muggleborns at Hogwarts, Kat being one of them.” He smiled at her and she preened.
His father growled. “Son, I’m only going to say this once, so listen closely.” He told him. “It’s
And he
He knew what he had to do. He ran.
“And why’s that?” he questioned.
Only, Draco didn’t go to the bathroom.
His father’s nostrils flared. “I will not be treated with such disrespect, boy!” he spat pointedly.
Draco sighed as he attempted to swallow down the bile that was creeping up his throat. What Weasley didn’t realise, what nobody had truly realised was that Draco and Malfoy were the same person. And they were both gits.
“I guess—"
Theo eyed him hungrily, “Don’t worry, I’m extremely thankful.”
“Are you seriously not going to speak to me.” He repeated again, “after all that?” he gave a defeated sigh.
Harry knew he was still alive. He felt him all around him. He felt his magic thrum throughout the ring that hung from his neck. He felt him in his heart.
Weasley? That was hilarious, he had to bite his tongue to stop him from bursting out into a fit of laughter, there and then.
He shook his head violently. “The only thing that’s dramatic is you thinking that I’m dramatic.” He stumbled.
Her words stayed with him for a very long time after that.
Pansy gave him a conflicted look and he took a deep breath, “You must hate me.” He said sadly. Of course she would, he would hate himself.
He shook his head. “Yes, he is. He still loves a man who is a follower of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.” he hissed his tone of the verge of becoming vengeful.
me.” He begged and Draco could hear the finality in his tone.
Kat did. She knew him better than anyone.
Draco moaned. “More. More!” He begged, arching up against him, pulling him closer than humanly possible. Potter chuckles before slamming into him, hard, fierce, and sure, giving Draco exactly what he needed, of what he’d always needed.
He looked over at his aunt hovering over his best friend, a menacing glint in her eye. He couldn’t save her. He couldn’t save anyone. He couldn’t even save himself.
He heaved, letting it all out. “Because he’s going to kill her. He’s going to kill her and I can’t—”
Weasley gave him a hesitant glance. “Actually mate, you’re part of the problem.” He muttered.
As she held her in his arms, he realised something. He realised that he could have given up. He could’ve ended it so many times. But he didn’t. He wouldn’t. He was a fighter. He was a survivor.
He waited patiently for several seconds before sighing deeply. It was clear that they would not show themselves. He supposed he hadn’t expected any better. They’d probably sensed what a traitorous, murderous bastard he was and were too scared to have anything to do with him. He couldn’t blame them; he wouldn’t have either.
She gestured to the badge, “she created a place that anyone could go. Somewhere to be safe. To be free. She believed in tomorrow. And it’s up to us, to carry on the light that her memory and so many others have gifted us with.” She urged them all.
a joke to him? All Draco wanted was to wrap his presents in peace. Was that
Am I still breathing? Yes. Then no.
Draco took a deep breath, ‘Operation Be an Impulsive Gryffindor Like Potter’ was a go.
It didn’t seem real. These sort of moments only happened in the safety of ones imagination. Draco shook his head in pure disbelief, “you’re here.” He whispered his voice drenched with pure wonder.
He took a deep breath looking at the list. He felt a huge weight fall from his shoulders. He may not be able to stop the Death Eater take over, but he could help in this small way. He would do whatever he had to, in order to make sure that the students at risk remained safe.
going to deal with it. There was no other choice.
What was Potter talking about? Had he confused Draco with someone else? Had war taken a toil on his mental state? So many question, and so little answers.
He had a choice. One that could determine the outcome of the war. One that could return the Malfoy name to glory. One choice. One life-altering choice.
Most people determined him to look that of his father. That didn't particularly please him. As far as he knew, his father was cold and cruel, someone Draco didn't much fancy resembling all that much.
come back to bite you in your very pert arse Draco.
Where the hell was the devil? Ha. Excuse the pun. Why was hell so dark? Where was the flames, the fire, the dragons? Why weren’t there any dragons? Draco wanted dragons. Was that too much to ask for?
As he walked down the steps lost in a whirl of his own thoughts, he realised that was the first time in a really first time he’d felt anything other that sadness.
“You think it’s your fault that all of this is happening.” She stated knowingly.
, we wouldn’t have known to follow you without it.” she mused. “And your arse wiggle made it look so perky" she admired, and in that moment he was reminded why he loved her so much.
He was strong.
It must be spelled so that only Hufflepuff's could see them. It was the only acceptable answer. It was the only solution as to why Draco had a band of devoted Hufflepuff first years, willingly aiding to his every beck and call.
Draco’s heart flutters, and at that moment he doesn’t want to feel anything else. He wanted to feel Potter’s cock buried deep into his tight heat. He wanted to feel Potter lose control. He wanted to feel connected to Potter in every way.
She nodded. “I know, but you have to keep strong.” She said softly.
saw chicken.
“Fuck, Draco…” He kisses the line of his jaw, working down slowly towards the nape of his neck. “Is this okay?” Potter asked in between kisses and Draco nodded, pulling Potter closer. His hand slipped under his shirt, his fingers possessive and full of wanting as they slide over his skin.
. Just one last time.
Draco shook his head. “I’m fine.” He croaked out and his father’s face fell.
He wasn’t just fighting for himself. He was fighting for the lives she’d ruined, for the lives she’d yet to ruin. For the lives she’d taken. For Kat…
Surprisingly, Potter had testified on his mother’s behalf, stating that she had saved him that night in the forest. Draco didn’t exactly know how, but he was proud that his mother had stood up for herself, and it was the love in her heart that had gotten her acquitted.
“NOOOO!” Draco screamed as he jumped in front of her, the Death Eater quickly lowered his wand sending Draco a confused look.
He needed a moment. Draco blinked a few times. Was his hearing staring to deteriorate? “I’m sorry, what?” he asked in pure disbelief.
And in that moment he realised that hope wasn’t just something to have in one person. It was something that he needed to have within himself. And he had hope. He
“No first you deceive me. Then you tell me that you love me. And now you’re going to leave me. No. No. No!” he screamed.
Speaking about Potter, the git wouldn’t leave him alone. He stared at him during classes, he followed him in the corridors, he glared at him in the Great Hall. It was all very confusing.
His best friend glared at him, before calmly, too calmly, picking up the empty tray and promptly banging it against her head repeatedly. Draco raised a brow in pure amusement, “and what do you think you’re doing?” he chuckled.
now Draco, I’m almost an adult. I can go where I like.” She argued.
Kat let out a small cough. “No not really.” She told him and Draco had to admit, he was just a
Draco couldn’t look. It had been four months since their first encounter at the lake. Four months of meeting up every single night. Four months of Harry talking and Draco listening. Four months of him sharing his deepest fears and happiest thoughts. Four months of handholding and watching the sunrise.
Draco didn’t know what to think. It was the first time he’d actually heard what sixth year with Potter had been like. Sure, everyone had told him what he’d felt. Even Potter had told him how he’d felt. But no one had dare tell him how he’d acted. How it had impacted him.
Blaise sighed. “This is not up for discussion.” He said simply.
“Malfoy?” she gasped, her eyes widening as she abruptly let go of his hand.
Literally.
to talk about this.” She urged them.
Pansy shook her head, “nothing.” She said before lying down next to Draco, Blaise sitting by their feet.
He sighed. If he were honest when he thought of Potter he didn’t feel anything but deep regret. He regretted the way he’d approached him in their first year. He regretted the years of antagonising and bullying. Draco had been nothing but a narrow-minded bigot, a replica of his father’s beliefs and words. He’d been a parrot, a vessel, an object to carry out the twisted beliefs of the Malfoy’s before him.
He felt tired, worn. He’d been fighting for so long. It had been so, so long. It would be easy just to give up. To admit defeat. But he wouldn’t. He’d come so far; he wouldn’t stop now. Not when he was so close.
Draco shot him a rare smile before handing him the portkey. “Trust me.” He whispered as the boy disappeared as if he’d never been there to begin with.
It was Christmas Eve and Potter and himself were cuddled up next to one another in front of the common room fireplace.
The bird was gone! That was a good sign.
“Detached my pearly white arsehole. Seriously Draco, it’s been a over a month and you haven’t left this depressing Manor.” She chided him gently.
His father sighed. “That you were confused about your sexuality because of Potter.” He stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
“I swear to Merlin Malfoy—”
Draco shook his head because he severely doubted that was true.
“Aunt Emmy!” His three-year-old son chirped up as soon as they stepped onto the platform. He squirmed in Harry’s grasped as he held out his arms to Ms Pritchett expectantly.
He sighed, deciding that wasn't the best thing to tell the scared, little girl.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that because he was scared. He was so scared. Ironically, he guessed that he was too cowardly to realise that. But he understood now. His heart had been broken so many times he couldn’t bare to have it break another.
, there were in fact, a good number of Slytherin’s who seemed to be fighting with the light. Against the Death Eater’s. But in comparison to the students of the other houses, that particular figure appeared to be in the minority.
He didn’t know what was to think. He didn’t know what to feel. But the one thing he was quite certain about was that he didn’t want to talk about it with his father.
Draco realised that they were coming to the end of their journey and took a deep breath. “Yes, yes very wonderful indeed. Anyways father, we’re almost at the station so we’re going to have to go.” He told him.
Potter had held Draco when he’d found out, pulling him close and telling him that everything was going to be okay. It was more than Draco deserved.
Draco wanted to hide. Whether or not he loved Harry Potter was none of their business. And what was even worse was they followed him
Jerry huffed. “And what does that have to do with anything?” he bit out and Draco wanted to hex him.
Draco opened his mouth to object but was cut off by a sharp glare. “If you’re going to give me some rubbish about letting Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, then please be quiet. You didn’t have a choice in the matter. But with what you did have a choice in, you chose to be good. That speaks volumes.”
As a parent, you wanted to protect your child. To drive all their worries away, making sure that they only ever felt loved and cared about. And to hear this, even more so as he was about to ship her off to Hogwarts, unsettled Draco deeply.
“Cut the bullshit Draco.” Theo growled.
It looked as if Kat was here to stay. He couldn't say that he minded all that much, it had been a long time since he'd accepted any proper company.
if greed, and want cease to exist.
“Are you two together or something?” he questioned glaring heavily at Draco.
“I can’t do that.” He breathed out and realised for the first time that it was true. That what he felt was real. It was so fucking real. But as he stared into Potter’s loving gaze, he thought himself an idiot for every doubting that.
He was calculating and cruel. All things that the world should be rid of. Draco decided that Potter was right, Draco didn't deserve it. He deserved
He raised an eyebrow, “Out?” he answered as if it were obvious.
Draco sat down crossed legged by the edge of the Great Lake. He breathed in the freshness of the deep winter air. It smelt like heaven.
Potter smirked. “We are a bossy bottom today, aren’t we?” he doesn’t give Draco a chance to reply as he kisses a long trail of kisses down his stomach. Wet, long, and desperate. Draco groans as Potter ripped off his bottoms in one quick tug.
“Good evening, Draco.” The Headmaster acknowledged cordially, and it made Draco’s stomach churn. Didn’t he realise? Couldn’t he see what Draco was about to do?
She sighed. “That didn’t make much sense.” She informed him.
Potter raked a hand through messy black curls. “You confuse me Malfoy. You confuse me so bloody much. This is your fault; this is all your fucking fault.” he told him.
to hear this.
floo call tonight.” He grinned and Draco could picture the disdain on his fathers’ face.
Pansy laughed. “Only you would be proud of little buggers torturing people in your defence.” She mocked, and alas he was happy to say that she was right.
Oh no... he knew that look. He knew it
The stars were beautiful.
he'd be all the better for it.
Determinedly, he ran towards her, the hexes flying towards him didn’t seem to matter all that much anymore. A Death Eater had spotted her, snarling as he made his way towards the quivering girl, his wand drawn in threat.
Draco crossed his arms across his chest, looking away. “I don’t want to talk about it.” he mumbled almost grumpily.
Draco sighed, leading her towards a big window as they sat down on the lower ledge. If a first year had noticed, then what's to say that everyone else hadn't noticed.
Pansy raised a confused brow, “What are you talking about?” she asked her voice laced in concern, and he realised that he couldn't lie to her.
Draco sniffed, as he opened his mouth to continue. “But it’s true, and I want you to remember it.” he said honestly.
Kat beamed. “Oh, that makes me so happy. I had them made especially for you.” She grinned handing him a purple badge. Draco took the badge, eyeing it sceptically.
Draco choked on the very air that he was breathing in. “I say this as a friend. Weasley, you need help.” He laughed, giving him a gentle nab.
It was exhausting.
She nodded, a single tear fell from her eye, cascading down her pinkened cheek as he saw the back of the drawing.
She growled, “you really are a piece of work Draco Malfoy.” She decided, as if that was meant to offend him.
He turned his attention to his daughter, and his heart broke for her. He knew that she’d really been looking forward for them to wave her off at the platform.
“I wanted to apologise.” He said quietly. Well,
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded but knew that he’d never really consider it.
Theo looked up at Draco in alarm, “kissed who?” he asked.
Had Blaise maybe taken into account the possibility that Draco simply didn't want to tell him anything. That he wasn't at liberty to say anything. If he didn't want to date Theo, then he didn't have to. No questions asked.
Kat shook her head slightly as if she were coming to a realisation, “I don’t think that you’re a bad person.”
His father attempted to speak but Draco cut him off. “No! You don’t get to talk anymore. You don’t deserve that privilege.” He growled. “Listen here and listen closely. I
Reluctantly, they pulled apart, lost in each other’s eyes. Potter smiled before pressing one last chaste kiss to Draco’s lips. It felt like goodbye. Draco didn’t want it to be goodbye.
She chuckled. “You’ll never kill me.” She snarled before disappearing into a cloud of smoke, leaving him alone.
Potter took a step towards him shaking his head, “what don’t you know?” he asked softly, his voice laced with concern.
“Draco!” Theo said, and Draco blinked turning away from Potter and faced Theo.
Macmillan shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. We’re not all that close anymore.” He replied. Draco’s ears perked up because now it was getting interesting.
Draco
Draco looked at him for a few moments later before he fixed his gaze onto the lake in front of him. He had nothing to say.
A small cough came from the teachers table. “Harry, my boy.” Dumbledore started, and Potter whipped his head round to face him, a stony look on his face.
Draco shook his head. “Perhaps. But you were just doing what you felt was right, I’m the one who carried through and stayed away from him.” he said fairly.
Draco rolled his eyes, “because I don’t bloody well know why there’s a bunch of Hufflepuff’s following me around like I’m Merlin himself!” he bit out exasperatedly.
She shook her head. “Of course not, Draco. But I can see what’s right in front of me. I’m afraid the wrackspurts are larger now, more potent. But that’s not all, there’s something else, something I can’t quite place.” She mused, studying him carefully.
?” he defended, pointing a crooked finger and Pansy and Blaise, “this is all
. But he wouldn’t be. And he’d still be wishing. And he’d still be staying strong, with tears in his eyes. He was
“Shit!” he swore out loud.
“Father.” Draco acknowledged formally.
Hermione and Weasley were waiting for him outside of the Slytherin common room, worry dusted their faces.
“Are you going to ignore me like you’ve been ignoring me since the beginning of the year?” Potter questioned.
He honestly had no idea. He thought he’d needed time. He still thought that he needed time. But it was hard. It was really, really hard. He’d become a social recluse, and for what? To find himself? How was
“Delicious!” he cheered, pure delight plastered onto his freckled features.
Luna shuffled closer to him, resting her head on his shoulder. “We’re just as sane as they are.” She murmured.
kind of look and Draco’s lips curled upwards.
In the few weeks since their first interaction, Draco and Ms Pritchett had become fast friends. She reminded him so much of Kat, and not just in physical attributes. No, it was clear that Kat’s kindness, optimism, and love had all been traits inherited from her mother.
“Yes, yes, yes? He asked her expectantly.
He nodded, “indeed it is.” He smiled gesturing for her to go inside.
He’d realised in that moment how much he loved his best friend, and how much she loved him. It was easier thinking that she’d never deceive her parents in favour of helping him through these difficult times.
“Oh yes, definitely.” He answered. “They were terribly incompatible.” Mainly because Weasley is so besotted with Hermione to even try to give himself wholly to another girl, but Draco decided to keep that part to himself.
Was she doing this to get a rise out of him or something? Peculiar. Peculiar! No, what was peculiar was the amount of makeup she caked onto her face each day, but she wasn't ready to have
“No.”
The vote had been unanimous, with every single member of the Wizengamot voting in Draco’s favour. Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt had proudly declared Draco free from all charges, stating that a hero shouldn’t have been on trial in the first place.
He shook his head. “There is. There is. There’s so much wrong with me.” He choked out.
Was nobody going to comment on how awkward it all was? Draco looked round frantically at his friends; their lips remained tightly sealed. Seriously, nobody?
Draco looked at him confused, “for being here.” Potter answered, before looking back upon the lake.
The rest of the eight-hour ride on the Hogwarts Express was anything less than pleasant.
and I’m already going mad.” He cried out and Draco’s heart broke.
Potter growled. “NO! You can’t say that. You can’t say it now. Not like this.” he begged him.
Draco sighed. He loved him. He loved him so much. He loved his unwillingness to give up. He loved his smile. He loved his ambition. He loved everything about him. He just loved
While they snogged, they both kicked their shoes of Draco pulling Potter closer and closer onto the bed. Potter’s feet hit the bottom of the bed, Draco withering beneath him.
son and his dear friends in order to protect them. Or do you mean risking your life to bring food and blankets to prisoner’s in attempt to keep them alive? I. Know. It. All!” she lifted her chin up defiantly.
Draco laughed before walking them towards the till. “I guess I’m paying for all of this?” Theo asked as if it were even a question.
Draco was scared. He was scared about his task. He was scared about deceiving Potter. He was scared that he’d never be able to do the right thing.
She cackled, “That wouldn’t be very smart now, would it?” she bit out. “I’m going to deliver your traitorous body to the Dark Lord.” She admitted with glee.
changing partners.” He stated with finality and the last shred of hope Draco had, smashed into little pieces.
.” He repeated before smashing his lips onto Draco’s.
Draco scoffed. Whilst he could wholly admit that Potter hadn’t had the easiest life, he couldn’t help but hate him for how he went about it. Yes, his parents had died when he was a baby. It was perhaps true that his family wasn’t the nicest to him. He very surely was the enemy of a crazed madman who wanted to kill him.
“You’re so beautiful.” Potter hums. His mouth sucking onto his neck, his teeth dragging over his sensitive skin. Draco mans, grabbing a fistful of his thick hair, tugging hard.
“Don’t get snarky with me.” Severus warned and Draco wished that he would just shut up. Alas, he didn't. He wouldn't.
Anyways, she’d bend down, her elegant robes flowing, and pull him into a giant hug, softly raking her hands through his hair. She made him feel safe, secure, loved. They’d just lie there, in each other’s arms for Merlin knows how long.
“That’s why I’m calling sweetheart. I’m afraid that your grandma and I won’t be able to make it.” he said and Draco could hear the disappointment in his tone.
He took in Potter’s words. Telling Potter to be sure. Essentially telling him to leave, had in one sense been one of the biggest mistakes he had ever made. But, ultimately, it had given him the courage to find himself. It had given him the strength to accept himself. And love was only made possible through acceptance.
He didn’t blame Draco. He didn’t blame him at all. He understood completely. He didn’t have a choice. He was just a boy forced into a life that he didn’t want to live. Harry knew all about that. They were quite similar in that respect.
Theo snorted. “Exactly.” He pointed out.
Draco laughed, “I guess I can spare a few moments for little old you.” Could he though. Could he
A second finger joins the first, it’s slick and hot, and Draco sucks him in, again and again. He feels as if he were floating, like he’s high on complete bliss. Potter inserts another finger, and Draco’s at a complete loss when he hits the spot deep inside of him. “Uhh…Potter…I need…” He gasped out frantically.
