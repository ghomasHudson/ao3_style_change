“Oh…” Harry says. He’s not sure he wants to discuss his best friends’ sex life, but he feels like he’s been a shitty friend lately, so he wants to be there for Hermione. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“A host club?”
“Five points from Hufflepuff for calling out, Mr Smith,” Professor Newman announces serenely. “I’m not expecting you to. You can simply tap the bottom of your musical box three times and sing into it. The device will record your voice.”
“Don’t go and defend that albino ferret,” Ron admonishes him, making Harry finally smile. It’s a tiny broken thing that makes him feel even more pitiful. “Did you tell Hermione? She seemed to know already.”
“Do you miss it?” Harry asks, staring at Malfoy’s pale eyelashes and the way they seem nearly transparent against his porcelain skin.
,” Draco murmurs. “Are you actually going to do it?”
“Whatever you want to call it,” Harry says, “I know you love it. And I’ve seen the way you were looking at me. Shall we go?”
with his wand.
He woke up feeling groggy, opening his eyes and staring at Harry Potter sprawled on his own bed, snoring peacefully. His blankets were cast aside and his t-shirt was scrunched up under his armpits, showing part of his chest and his flat belly. Draco frowned and tried to remember where the fuck he was and why he was looking at a sleeping Boy Who Lived Twice. Then he remembered and he grimaced.
“That’s the easiest part, then,” Harry says with a smile. “Because you have me, for as long as you want. I’m yours to keep. And I wonder every day if I am worthy of you, too.”
Harry’s finger tentatively moves to Malfoy’s cheek, wiping away a tear. He brings it to his lips and lets the saltiness burn on his tongue.
Draco is standing in the middle of the room, frantically casting cleaning charms on himself as he tries to undress at the same time, his face drained of all colour.
“I still owe you a life debt,” Malfoy insists, swiftly walking down the road to avoid the rain. Harry looks around and since he can’t spot any Muggle, he casts a quick
“Thanks,” Draco interrupts him, his cheeks flushing pink. “That would be great.”
“I’ll tell Hermione you’re back safe and sound,” Ron says, his cheeks flushing a deep red as he pretends to read a Quidditch magazine. “She was worried sick.”
“We’ve got the money,” Draco explains serenely. “Let’s go out. I’ll get you an ice-cream and we can take a walk in Boboli Gardens.”
“You can’t be his probation officer,” Granger repeats, and Potter throws his hands in the air in defeat.
“Honestly, the next time Miss Granger decides to play Medi-Witch, please send her to me.”
to keep the food warm. Harry feels something thawing inside him, nearly knocking the plate out of Ron’s hand as he lunges forward to hug his friend.
Draco started going to the library again in the early morning, in spite of Harry’s pleas to stay in bed with him a little longer. The dark circles under the Gryffindor’s eyes were gone, because he was having less nightmares now that they were sleeping together. Sometimes Draco woke up to Harry thrashing next to him, whimpering in his sleep, and all it took was a gentle word whispered in his ear, a caress on his head, Draco’s warm arms around him and he calmed down, drifted back into a peaceful sleep.
The exams seem to go well, or at least Draco thinks they do. When he’s done, he feels a wave of relief, and then Potter’s telling him they should celebrate, a tired smile on his face.
“I…” he licks his dry lips, noticing the way Draco’s gaze follows his tongue. “I tried with Ginny, after the war…but I couldn’t…I could never keep it up. It was mortifying…”
“You’re wearing…” Harry starts, sitting next to him, finding a little red snake embroidered on the front pocket, its eyes yellow and a tiny, forked tongue sticking out of its mouth.
“I’ve forgiven you a long time ago,” Draco whispered, his eyes meeting Potter’s.
“Nope,” Harry replies, adjusting his trousers, which are suddenly really tight. He puts a heavy book in his lap to cover the evident bulge in his crotch.
Harry grabs his hand and takes him to bed.
“I got you,” Harry says, taking him to his room, then to the bathroom. “It’s going to be alright,” he repeats as he undresses Draco, his hands clumsy as Draco shivers and sobs quietly. Harry starts the water with his wand, making it hot and then pushing Draco underneath the stream.
“Harry!” Hermione yells, her voice full of panic.
“I worry that I’m going to get sick and die, leaving my mother alone. Or that I’m going to touch something with dirty hands and contaminate it, and then someone else is going to get sick, and it’s going to be my fault.”
“They will sell the antiques. The furniture? Maybe,” Draco explains calmly. “But not my things. No one will want to buy a Death Eater’s old books. They will smash my china collection, set fire to my childhood photos after spitting on them. What do you think they’re going to do to my teddy?”
“Maybe,” Draco mutters, squeezing Harry’s hand.
Draco takes him to the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague and tells him all about Flemish painters, about Vermeer and Rembrandt, about Bruegel (both of them, because it turns out there are two) and Van Gogh. Harry listens, tilting his head at the tiny paintings on the wall that depict everyday life in incredibly derailed brush strokes. He knows nothing about art, but he still wonders how they managed to capture life in such a tiny frame, the feelings of the people from hundreds of years ago still so vibrant and real.
“I don’t actually know. I had my back to them.”
He looks like he couldn’t care less, but Harry notices the way he averts his gaze, how his voice quivers ever so slightly.
“No need for that; I can give you one right now. I have a stash for my patients,” Pansy declares, her eyes shining with anticipation, “but you also have to contact all your past sexual partners to let them know that they need to get tested too.”
“Harry? Are you okay?”
“Did Greg make that?” Draco asks, amid fits of laughter and Harry nods.
Still, Harry thinks it’s weird that Malfoy remembers it, and he takes a bite with questions swimming in his head. It tastes absolutely mind-blowing, and he moans again. Malfoy blushes the prettiest shade of pink, and Harry smiles.
“Hey,” he says to Draco, considering whether to bump his shoulder against his, and deciding that’s the worst possible idea. Draco would probably hex him, if he tried to touch him.
“Shh, don’t tell her I said that,” Ron says, winking at him, the tension between them finally melting. “So you like blokes now?”
Harry pales, looking back at Malfoy, who pretends to be busy flicking through a book on healing spells.
They walk side by side for a few minutes, and Harry searches for something to say. He settles for something he fears he’ll regret.
The students are meant to leave for the Christmas holidays on Friday  morning and yet the last week of term feels slower than usual. Harry tries to get through the days, between class tests and Hermione relentlessly trying to pry more information out of him about his weekend escapade.
“Fuck, you feel so good…”
“What if I make mistakes?” Harry asks nervously, his eyebrows knitted in concern. Hermione is always telling him that he needs to work on his spelling, and he always forgets where to put commas.
“We’re not done, I have an ointment for your open wounds.”
“Fuck patience!” Harry shouts, fed up with everything—with the Ministry, with the Aurors, with people always taking, taking,
He tells Draco he misses him. That he can’t wait for Saturday. And then he sends Argo off and he goes to his second lesson of the day, his eyes red and puffy and nose still running.
“He didn’t tell me nor mother about being an
Harry kisses him again, wanting to slither under his skin, to be awash with Draco’s affection and desire.
“I’m not working with Weasley,” Zabini declares as soon as Ron tries to sit next to him. Neville senses trouble, and he moves next to Terry.
“Fuck,” Harry murmurs, “oh shit, Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Harry’s hand sneaks towards Malfoy’s waist and then moves up his left arm, staring at the Mark, aching to run his finger on it, to feel it.
Harry thinks he probably
“Ron spotted the Marauders Map on your bed, and we used it to find you,” she explains.
“That’s different,” the Slytherin says. “How long is it going to take for the stew to cook?”
“Salazar, Potter!” He sighs, shutting the door behind him. “One might wonder if you have an unhealthy obsession with me.”
He replies to Hermione, saying that he will be there on Saturday.
On Wednesday morning Harry packs his trunk, excited for the first time in Merlin knows how many months.
“But he’s an annoying tosser,” Ron whines. Hermione ignores him and grabs her school bag from under the table.
“I want you,” Harry confesses, pressing their lips together, fingers already fumbling for Draco’s robes, undressing him as fast as he can. “I missed you today.”
He doesn’t know how to do this. He’s never tried anything like it before, but he has a feeling Draco knows what he’s doing.
“You know that’s not possible,” Harry says, kissing his soft lips, holding him close. “But you can learn to live with them. And you are doing it already, day by day.”
“Draco, I’m not going t—” Harry starts, but his boyfriend shakes his head.
“Draco?”
“I don’t know,” he said, avoiding Potter’s eyes.
“It’s comfy,” Draco says defensively, his cheeks flushing, “and warm. The nights are getting colder, so I wear it over my pyjamas.”
Chloe suddenly Apparates in the library with a crack that makes them both jump, and Malfoy’s hand leaves Harry’s skin in haste.
“Oh,” Draco says, turning to look at him and placing a kiss on his cheek. “Merry Christmas. Sorry, I woke up early, but you were sleeping so soundly that it would have been a shame to wake you up.”
Malfoy’s fingers hook under the elastic band of his underwear, and he slowly drags it down, revealing more creamy skin and a flushed cock, the tip glistening with precome.
“I found you one, then,” Weasley says with a lazy smile. “My brother George needs help creating new Wheezes for the shop. He’s shit at potions, and it turns out that Fred was actually the one who was mixing up the ingredients. But you’re good at brewing potions, and George says you can move to the flat above the shop, if you want, since he’s living with Angelina.”
“What the fuck are all you wearing?” Harry asks dumbfounded.
“An owl has arrived for Master Harry while he was away,” the elf says, handing Harry a letter. It’s from Hermione. She wants to go shopping together on Saturday morning. Harry thinks about Malfoy and what he assumed was going to happen at the weekend, but then he calls himself stupid. He can’t plan his days around a Slytherin and the possibility of wanking with him.
“Did you go?” Harry asks unnecessarily, sitting up and staring at him. Draco’s face still looks a mess, his bruise dark and lips puffy and swollen. He moves in an odd way, as if he were in pain but trying not to show it.
Harry shakes his head and starts climbing the stairs.
“Help yourself,” Potter said, “Mrs Weasley gave me enough food to last me for the first month at Hogwarts.”
Draco stirs and grey eyes meet his. A besotted smile greets Harry.
He’s caught fast in his web and ready to be eaten alive.
“Will you lower your voice, you idiot?” he hisses. “What if your Auror friends heard you?”
They make their way inside and spend the rest of the afternoon sorting out books in silence. Harry finally relaxes when he realises that Malfoy is not planning on hexing him. He looks almost peaceful, resigned, as he touches the fragile pages of decrepit books with delicate fingers, showing so much care that Harry wonders why he bothers.
“No,” Hermione says, “he’s completely oblivious as usual. But I know you well enough, and I’ve seen the way you look at Draco.”
“I’m going to read for a little bit,” Draco says, eyes darting back towards Harry for a split second. “You go to bed, Pansy. I’ll be fine.”
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I wish I could help.”
“No!” Harry shouts. The room suddenly gets darker, the walls seeming to close in on them as Harry’s magic starts emitting sparks. A strange wind picks up, ruffling Draco’s hair and making him stare at Harry with worry painted across his face.
A plan forms in Harry’s head as he scribbles his reply.
“I hope I don’t fuck up,” he said, frowning, “
“It’s been cancelled tomorrow,” he lies, “so I’m free all day. You can come whenever you want. I’ll be waiting.”
The island is not what Harry expected. It’s rough and bare, with skinny sheep munching on grass and oddly shaped little towers standing in the middle of fields or amongst cork trees.
Draco touches him like he’s made of spun sugar, like he might break if he’s not careful and Harry feels like he probably will, because he’s so in love and he knows his heart is going to be shattered by the end of the night. But he still kisses and touches and moans under Draco’s gentle caresses, until he’s a whimpering mess and Draco lies on the bed on all fours again.
Marelli. Hopkins. Zabini. Other faceless men. He just can’t push the images away, and all he can think about is Draco with other men, Draco being fucked by someone else, Draco kissing a stranger’s lips, letting them touch him and do unspeakable things to him.
He needs to see him. He wants to see him.
She bursts out laughing and kisses his cheek.
“It happens sometimes,” she simply said. “People react differently to grief. It’s not like you were laughing because you found it funny. It was just a nervous reaction, and it’s perfectly fine.”
“I’m so tired,” the blonde murmurs. “I wish I could sleep like this.”
“Why are you snarkier than usual?” Harry asks before lunchtime.
This was my microfic's post for "flood".
“I told you to stay away,” comes Draco’s muffled voice from his bedroom. Harry’s been there a couple of times, so he gingerly approaches the open door, waiting for Draco to tell him to fuck off.
Harry can’t concentrate on what Draco is saying about cots and bumpers and safe sleeping positions. He knows he should; it’s important, but all he can focus on is that ‘with
Draco sits up in bed, then hears Potter move, footsteps making their way up the stairs. Potter’s face appears in the doorway, his face tired and sad.
Harry tells Ron over breakfast. The spoon falls from his best friend’s hand, landing in his bowl and splattering Neville and Zabini with porridge.
“Yeah, just thinking.”
Draco’s hands tremble as he looks at the Patronus flying around, so corporeal that all the details in the plumage can be seen. The bird lands on Harry’s stretched hand and then it disappears.
Harry ends up on his knees in the empty changing rooms, sucking Draco off under the hot stream of the shower, long fingers tugging at his curls.
But Harry knows.
“Keep the whole box,” he mutters, grabbing an object that looks like a gramophone and using his wand to turn it on. Classical music starts playing, and Harry relaxes again, lost in the sad tune, his fingers flicking through old photos and imagining a story behind each face.
They spend the next half-hour trying out the different cups. Harry feels like a child in a sweet shop. Malfoy’s collection is fascinating, and Harry wants to see all of the sets. He asks what the others do, but the Slytherin simply reminds him that patience is a virtue and summer’s not over. Before long, they go back upstairs to read more books.
,” Draco tells him. “
“I’ll be fine. I can brew some pain relief potions tomorrow morning.”
“I know,” Draco replies, finally locking gaze with Harry, “and I was considering leaving the Manor to Teddy anyway.”
“Can I touch you? Can I kiss you?” he asks, trying to make things right this time, and Draco just hums his answer, closing his eyes and bringing their lips together. Harry’s hand wanders down his scarred chest, hesitating, until it reaches Draco’s cock and then curls around it. Draco moans in his mouth and Harry feels his warm fingers skimming against his bronze skin, setting it alight.
“Thank you,” Draco replies, almost a whisper, “you didn’t have to come all the way here. But I’m very grateful.”
He hears Potter moan in his bedroom on Saturday evening, a desperate sound that makes Draco open his eyes wide in the darkness, goosepimples on his pale skin.
Draco is filthy.
It turns out Draco doesn’t actually need to say anything, though, because it’s all over the papers the following day.
“Yes, of course.”
He feels exhausted, his heart sore and heavy like a rock.
“What do you mean by ‘weird’?” Hermione asks, her chin resting on the palm of her hand.
When he gets back, he finds Ron sitting by the fire, a Quidditch magazine clutched in his fingers. The Slytherins are nowhere in sight. Ron casts a silencing charm on them, and Harry braces himself for the storm.
Harry looks at the packet of beef sitting on the counter, red and still cold from his preserving charm.
“I swear to Merlin I am going to hex you, if you take another step,” Draco says, panicking and then he seems to change his mind and he swings his wand, shouting at the top of his lungs, “
“I’m meeting him tomorrow,” he says, wishing he could tell Ron more, but deciding that he’s going to give him time and do it little by little.
Draco’s loud intake of breath makes Harry shudder in anticipation, a shiver running down his spine.
Draco goes home early and finds him there, a smile on his lips.
Harry simply shrugs and inhales Malfoy’s intoxicating smell.
Harry paces around the kitchen, wondering what the fuck he should do, making Kreacher stare at him, a confused look on his wrinkly face.
“I…” Harry eventually replied, his sleeves rolled up and hair stuck to his sweaty forehead as he was polishing the floor, “I need to keep going, because if I stop, everything will just come crumbling down.”
“Potter?” The familiar clipped and posh tones send him straight down a trip to memory lane, but he finds himself smiling, somehow.
They both stare at each other and moan loudly in unison.
“Okay…” Harry tries to avoid her gaze, focusing on his own fingers playing with the hem of the pyjama top he’s holding.
“You keep on saying ‘him’ when you talk about the baby,” Draco says much later, curled up in bed against Harry, a hand on his bump. “How do you know it’s a boy?”
Marvellous, now he was hard.
Draco agrees and on Sunday he puts on his best robes, plaiting his hair carefully, the ribbon between his pressed lips and a serious expression on his face as he stares at his reflection in the mirror.
Harry bloody Potter.
“Mate, I’m so happy that I’m not doing Potions this year,” Ron says.
“You should have realised if she was your soulmate anyway. The bond would have appeared,” he muttered.
“Pomfrey gave me Dreamless Sleep after the battle,” he replies slowly, his words a little slurred. “She said it would help me sleep. But when I woke up in the morning, I didn’t know where I was, and I was so confused. I…I thought I was still dead. I thought I hadn’t come back—that it had all been a dream. That’s when I had my first panic attack. Ron found me hyperventilating in my bed.”
“If you kiss me again, I’ll lend you mine,” Draco replies through half-lidded eyes, a promising smile on his lips.
Draco’s mouth drops open and he can tell that Pansy is enjoying his reaction immensely. She’s such a dick, honestly.
Harry chuckles and then he slowly starts moving, entranced by the way Draco’s eyebrows crease in pleasure, by the way his lips part to let out a moan or call Harry’s name.
“You will never pass your DADA exam like this,” the professor adds. “What about your dream of becoming an Auror?”
. No toys, no books. No parents to love him. No one to sing him a lullaby or tuck him into bed. No presents for his birthday or for Christmas.
They sit on the sofa in the parlour, piles of books on the table in front of them. A sense of déjà-vu hits Harry, leaving him smiling as he remembers all the time they spent together reading last summer. Malfoy Manor seems like a distant memory right now, but Harry cherishes it like it is something precious. Like it was the start of something important.
I have a new Drarry fic coming up soon and hopefully I will be able to post it next week.
He eats as much as he can manage, but his stomach won’t take much after a whole summer of barely eating.
“You may,” Malfoy replies stiffly. “I wonder if I will ever get to meet him.”
“Thank you,” Draco murmurs, his voice a little broken as Harry pulls his fluffy bathrobe around his shoulders.
“Touch yourself,” Malfoy says, his voice odd and deep. “You’re so hard, Potter. Does it turn you on that you marked me as yours?”
“Nothing,” the Slytherin answers, still avoiding his eyes.
“I would like you to pair up and give it a go,” Marelli says. “Mr Potter, I am expecting you to give everyone a show with yours.”
“Oh,” Harry replies. His fingers are still shaking, and he feels like an utter wreck. He starts working on his tie, but Draco steps forward and gently swats his hands away. Harry lets Draco’s lovely hands undress him. He is careful and tender, his eyes meeting Harry’s again and again to check that he’s alright.
“You need to be quiet,” he repeats, and it feels like an order, so Harry nods, trying not to make a sound. Draco’s palm gently rests on his tented underwear, and he starts stroking him, excruciatingly slowly, making Harry look at him with pleading eyes. “Perfect. You want me to suck your cock, don’t you?”
Draco chuckles and steps closer.
“Stand up,” Draco orders, and Harry complies straight away, observing as Draco grabs his wand and casts a spell that opens the front of Harry’s robes and unfastens his trousers. Draco runs his hand on Harry’s underwear, rubbing his cock though the thin fabric and making him buck his hips forward. “Will you be good for me? Just stand still and put your hands on my shoulders, like that. You’re so good.”
Also, FYI Astoria does hex Draco, then she gets drunk with Pansy, who confesses secretly being in love with her, and they run away into the sunset together.
“Draco, what the fuck is going on?” Harry asks, moving so that his cock slides out and then dragging Draco closer to him.
“Hey,” he says, a cautious smile on his freckled face. “Are you okay?”
“What?” Harry asks.
Harry doesn’t send Argo back with a reply straight away. He visits the Burrow, instead, and asks Arthur about documents regarding the Potters, without offering a reason why he’s so eager to find them. Ron’s dad suggests going to the Ministry and searching the National Wizarding Archives. In spite of avoiding public spaces like the plague, Harry braves a trip to the Ministry, wearing his Invisibility Cloak for most of the journey.
Draco looks petrified, but then he stares at the chip, and finally leans forward and takes it into his mouth.
“Did you hear about Hogsmeade?” Neville asks, breaking Harry’s daze. “Professor McGonagall is going to allow the eighth-year students to go to Hogsmeade every weekend. Professor Sprout told me yesterday evening.”
?” Draco asks, surprised, searching in Harry’s eyes for permission to go through his thoughts and memories. Harry nods, knowing that Draco will be gentle, that he will tread cautiously and wait for Harry to show him what he wants. They’ve done this before, and Harry trusts him. Harry puts the mug on the low table in front of the sofa, and then he closes his eyes and rests his head on a cushion, waiting for Draco to be ready. “If you want me to stop at any time, just kick me out or tell me to leave, okay?”
A smirk appears on his full lips, and then he starts stroking his cock again, slowly and languidly, arching his back and making needy little sounds that make Harry’s breath catch in his throat and his dick leak in his pants.
“Darling, are you sure about this?” Narcissa asks her invisible son and Draco says that he is, that he wants to go.
“Are you going to come on me or what?” Malfoy asks, out of breath, his blond hair sticking to his sweaty forehead. Harry can’t stop looking at him, focusing on the sound of slicked skin and laboured breathing, tiny moans and pants. “You’re perfect, Potter. So good for me.”
spell, and his eyes land on Draco’s neck, on his pale skin and fair hair. He needs to convince him to let Harry heal his wounds.
He remembers lying there, on the cold floor, that time he wet the mattress and Petunia thought that taking away the whole bed was an appropriate punishment.
“Yes, I’m going to brew the suppressant potion as soon as I get home. I can finally leave the house. I’m going to come to Hogwarts with you!”
At lunch time Miffy brings a quiche with a salad, and Harry can’t suppress a satisfied moan as he eats it, realising that Malfoy’s cheeks are pink and that the Slytherin looks mildly embarrassed by his reaction. And yet, Malfoy didn’t seem a prude on Saturday, when he was pulling on his cock while watching Harry do the same. Why is he getting embarrassed now?
“I lied,” Malfoy says as a greeting, without even turning. “I wasn’t wanking.”
Harry realises that, deep down,
“Twenty minutes,” Harry replies breathlessly, checking his watch, feeling his heart beating faster as Draco’s fingers cup the bulge in his trousers and start stroking him over the fabric of his robes. “
Harry goes home and sits down at his desk, an old quill in his hand and blank parchment in front of him. He knows what he wants to ask, but the right words are hard to find.
Harry gives in, sitting down again, Draco’s hand still on his. He’s so warm and solid that Harry feels like closing his eyes and just burying his face in his neck, breathing in his smell.
“Of course, Potter, it must have been my fault if your Auror friends decided to manhandle me,” Draco replies icily. “I must have breathed too hard or maybe it’s simply the fact that I’m alive and not in Azkaban that made them feel like hexing me all the way here.”
“Er…” Harry says, hesitating, “I…I am struggling too. Quite a lot, actually. It’s…hard to admit it, but I think I need to see someone too. To do some therapy.”
She then proceeds to grab Neville’s arm and drag him to her corner, fussing around him and studying his hair with a serious expression on her face. Neville looks mildly terrified and just lets her get on with it.
“I want to put my fingers inside you,” Draco says, his hand moving faster and faster, making Harry whimper. “I want to finger you slowly, until you’re begging me to put my cock inside you. I want to fuck you on my bed, until the only thing you can say is my name. And then I want to come deep inside you. I want to fill you up until it leaks out.”
Harry feels like shit.
“Do you have any idea for how long I’ve wanted this?” Draco asks, his voice sounding husky with want and Harry simply groans, capturing his lips again, letting his hands roam up Draco’s back, pulling him even closer.
“It’s not,” Harry replies, placing a tender kiss on his entrance before teasing it with his tongue again. “You’re clean, and you’re lovely.”
“Deal,” Potter beamed, offering his hand. The memory of their very first day at Hogwarts slapped Draco in the face with the force of a train. He remembered his own pale hand stretched out, Potter refusing to take it.
“I didn’t hear you complain about it,” Ron mutters, a cheeky grin on his freckled face. Harry tries to scowl, but he probably ends up looking constipated. Not that Ron’s wrong. He really did not mind in the least being bonded to Draco for an entire week. Sleeping in the same bed, having breakfast together and sitting on the sofa in his lovely living room, whilst they waited for St Mungo’s to figure out a way to dissolve their bond. Draco even allowed Harry to make him dinner, using all his fancy kitchen utensils. And that kiss they shared the first night…it was clearly caused by the bond, but Merlin, fuck…
“I can’t wait for the time everyone leaves,” Draco murmurs, making Harry’s cheeks catch fire.
Zabini looks comfortable, slouched on the sofa in his seventeenth-century clothes, wearing a massive white ruff under his chin that makes it impossible for him to lower his head, but that he wears with impeccable style. Goyle is still busy knitting, dressed like a Tudor gentleman and Pansy does a graceful pirouette in her eighteenth-century maid outfit.
He wants to disappear so badly.
“Well, I’m glad you approve of my choice of cologne,” Malfoy replies, sounding outraged.
“Harry, will you do something for me?” he asked.
Second part (because Em convinced me to write it, and I also felt bad for Harry).
Harry frowns and is about to tell him to fuck off, since all Malfoy’s done is boss him around, but then he sees that glint in Malfoy’s eyes—a promise of something forbidden that Harry desperately wants.
“Did you seriously think you were keeping it a secret?” Neville asks and Ron nearly chokes on his sausages as he starts laughing with his mouth full.
“I’m here with you now,” Draco eventually murmurs. “Why does it matter if I’ve ever been with others?”
Harry thinks it’s all over too soon.
on the kitchen table. He finds it empty the following morning.
“What if Blaise comes back?” Draco argues, nervously tucking a loose strand of white-blond hair behind his ear. Harry notices it’s flushed like the rest of his face.
How do other people do it?
“Circe’s tits!” Parkinson exclaims. “Longbottom is finally here! I’ve been waiting since September to do a makeover on him.”
“I…” he finds the courage to say when Draco spreads his legs and kisses the inside of his thighs, “I’ve never…”
doing outside Teddy’s primary school?
He knocks on the front door, and Hermione’s mother opens it, looking puzzled.
“It’s confiscated until his return,” Page replies haughtily. “For your own safety. Robards’s orders.”
Harry has lost most of the people who really mattered to him.
“For you,” Draco replies. “But don’t expect much,” he repeats, his eyebrows creased in concern as Harry unceremoniously rips the beautiful paper to reveal a brown tuft of fur. His grin widens as a teddy bear appears. It’s soft and brand new, with black eyes and a red and gold scarf. Harry spots a miniature green snake towards the edge of the scarf, and he laughs, overwhelmed, as he holds it against his chest.
“Holy shit, Nev!” Ron shouts. “You’re so hot that even I would shag you!”
“Cracked it,” she exclaims triumphantly after dinner, her hair pulled up in a messy bun and a smile on her lips. “I found the address of the house where they were meeting. It’s in Godric’s Hollow.”
“It’s one of my favourites,” he answers. “I thought I might as well use it while I can.”
“Draco…”
“Thanks, Hermione. You’re a star.”
at Hogwarts, Potter.”
“That you’re my brave Gryffindor,” Draco replies in posh, crisp tones. “My valiant knight in shining armour. I could swoon and faint at your feet every time your gaze locks with mine.”
“We can continue our trip, if you want,” Draco says, his expression neutral as he stares at him, waiting for Harry to make a move.
“We could reach a deal,” he said, “I can cook for you and you can help me pass Potions and my other subjects. We share most of them anyway. McGonagall said that she will let me take the DADA exam if I do well in my other N.E.W.T.s.”
“Harry! What happened?” Molly says when he knocks on her door and he tries to smile and look like this is normal, when his heart is still beating like a mad tambourine in his chest.
By dinnertime Harry is exhausted and glad it’s the end of the week. He slouches on a sofa in the common room after dinner, but then he hears a commotion outside the portrait hole, and he stands up to check what’s going on.
He had lost his soulmate; he should be grieving for him instead.
“Yes,” Draco finally answers. “Would you?”
He was trying in vain to focus on his book again, when his eyes suddenly noticed something. A flicker or light, an odd reflection, a sudden rustling of fabric.
“Oh, you are
“No one lives there,” an ancient-looking wizard tells Harry, after he’s been staring at the house for a good five minutes. The man peeps from the next-door house and smiles at him. “It’s protected by some weird spell and nobody’s ever managed to get in. It appeared in the late fifties, out of the blue, but it has never been inhabited.”
“I bet you’d love for me to suck your cock,” Malfoy whispers, a debauched statement that goes straight to Harry’s groin. He has to press on the base of his cock and breathe deeply for a few seconds, feeling an impending orgasm and wanting to delay it.
“Go back to sleep,” Draco replies, and then he casts another
“Oh,” Draco says, suddenly feeling ashamed. He stands up, sending his plate to the sink with a quick spell that makes it clink.
“We need a shower first,” he says, his voice husky and deep, and Harry gapes at him, like a fish out of water, his brain slowed down by the pleasure and the magnitude of what they have just done. “Do you want to wash together?” Harry nods, and Draco smiles. “I can try to tame that impossible mop of hair of yours.”
“Hmm.” He suckles on the tip, making Draco gasp, then starts moving his hand up and down, cautiously. He lets the foreskin slide over the head of Draco’s dick and then twists his wrist like he’s seen Draco do when they’ve wanked together.
Harry’s at a loss for words, wants to ask a million questions, but then he hears a voice coming from outside the door, down the corridor.
“Surreal,” Harry replies. “I saw Dumbledore.”
Harry’s mouth hangs open when he enters the kitchen, nearly failing to recognise it with all the fairy lights floating around, the mistletoe hanging from the ceiling, and the Christmas decorations making it look like a scene from a fairy tale.
Draco nods and they put on some clothes and head for the kitchen. It feels completely surreal, being in Draco’s house, where he’s spent a million evenings working on case files or simply hanging out, now that he knows the taste of Draco’s skin and the way his body feels, the noises he makes when he’s coming. Harry’s heart beats frantically in his chest, sitting at the kitchen table, looking at Draco making sandwiches, his shirt open at the top and his silvery scars on display. He looks vulnerable, but at ease, like he’s given up his armour and has finally allowed Harry to truly see all of him.
Harry thinks of what to say.
“Merlin, what do you keep here?” Harry wonders out loud.
Their fingers brush when Harry’s clumsy hands nearly drop the photo he’s holding, and he feels like a current runs through him when his skin comes in contact with Malfoy’s. The Slytherin is so soft and warm, and Harry feels all the saliva suddenly leave his mouth as his heart starts beating madly in his chest. He tells himself he’s probably still a bit hungover from yesterday, even if it was just a small glass of Firewhiskey, but there’s no other possible explanation otherwise.
“You’re about to say something sappy,” Draco whispers, his eyes smiling before his lips curl up.
The professor’s spell is so strong that the fire momentarily stops, but a strong wind suddenly ignites it once more. Students stumble and fall over as they scamper outside, trying to escape Harry’s fury.
“Harry James Rodrigo Potter,” Draco says solemnly, “are you trying to make me break school rules to fumble around naked with you?”
Miffy appears again with two glasses of lemonade and a ceramic bowl containing what looks like couscous and vegetables. Harry moves closer, attracted by the delicious smell, but Malfoy takes the bowl from the old elf’s hands and sits on a bench. Harry kicks the gravel and looks around, but there’s no other bench in sight.
Draco nodded, without a word, going back home whilst Harry napped to take a change of clothes and to shop for food to make dinner (Harry’s kitchen was always empty). They had a quiet evening together, chatting about Quidditch and their jobs as Draco was busy cooking. And it all felt so mundane and domestic, that Draco felt something shattering inside his chest, wishing that he could have this every single fucking day. Wanting to come back home to find Harry asleep on the sofa, warm and soft, to be able to brush his messy curls from his forehead and wake him up with a gentle kiss. He wanted to cook for him, to make sure that he ate a decent meal every evening. He even wanted to make him a fucking packed lunch to take to the Ministry every morning.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry replies irritably.
“I-I…” Harry feels his cheeks catching fire and hides his face in his hands. “I don’t even…”
“I trust you,” Harry says, slowly so that his words will sink in. “I know you will do your research, and you will check and double check everything. You’re a very skilful wizard, and you have incredible control over your magic. So, I trust you, and I want you to be the one doing it.”
“We kind of were,” Harry answers, not even knowing what he means by that. They were
“Stop staring at me,” Malfoy murmurs. “You’re making me uncomfortable.”
Harry stumbles into bed, struggling to fall asleep. He grabs the most boring book he can find, hoping it will help settle his nerves. After an hour of reading the history of Mandrake root usage in potions, he gives up and searches for a sleeping potion in the bathroom cabinet.
“Mhh,” Malfoy moans, and then Harry can hear his hand stroking his cock faster. He turns to look at it and Malfoy arches underneath him, his orgasm so strong that it shakes him to the core. A bit of come ends up on Harry’s thigh and he scoops it up with his finger, bringing it to his lips.
Harry’s gaze moves lower, noticing how hard Draco is, wanting to ask if he can touch there too.
“Harry,
“Harry, breathe,” Draco murmurs calmly, suddenly behind him. Harry closes the paper, scrunching up the pages. His vision is swimming, tiny lights shimmering in front of him. “You’re hyperventilating, love. You need to breathe. Look at me, please.”
“Still,” Ron comments, going back to his Quidditch magazine. “That man is a bit of a twat.”
“In case of an emergency,” Hopkins replies, raising an eyebrow and then tilting his chin up to indicate Draco, who looks absolutely mortified.
“Will you leave me alone?” Harry finally asked, exasperated. “I just want to live my life like a normal person. Besides, it’s none of your bloody business!”
He orders an ice cream for Draco and then they head for the beach. It’s a hot summer’s day, the aromatic scent of myrtle permeating the air. Harry has never noticed the smell of the air, but it seems to be always changing here in Sardinia, and he likes it.
“Draco, I’m so sorry…” Harry pleads, a broken apology that makes the Slytherin sneer at him, that awful expression that Harry used to hate so much.
Harry’s cheeks catch fire, and Malfoy just smirks at him and then starts laughing, shaking his head and muttering, “Gryffindors.”
This thing between them stretches and expands, like a protective bubble, day after day, until Harry feels like he can say it without his voice shaking so much.
Draco’s got the same expression now as he slowly undresses Harry, as if he were the best packet of Honeydukes chocolates. He feels Draco’s tentative fingers skimming over his skin, pausing on the scars that scatter his body, kissing them softly and reverently.
Potter lifted his chin up at him, the smallest greeting, the only one he would possibly get that day. And he nodded, turning straight away, grabbing his trunk and getting on the train, trying to find an empty carriage, hoping that no one would come and look for him.
, and it's absolutely stunning. All the details have blown me away (Draco's little finger! His robes!). It's exactly as I imagined it, and the teacup set is just perfect. Thank you so much for this little gem; it really brought a smile to my face!
Harry’s fascinated by the illustrated books on animals that Draco has collected over the years. He has entire volumes on magical creatures, with moving drawings that make Harry sit up and gasp, running his fingers over the illustrations. He has always enjoyed picture books, even as a child. He was forever trying to steal Dudley’s fairy tale books, and luckily his cousin barely noticed because he was more interested in playing with his toys. Harry remembers smuggling the books under his baggy clothes, hiding them underneath the mattress of his tiny bed in his cupboard. He managed to find a functioning torch in a bin once, and he used to read the books at night, until the battery ran out.
“Fuck…Draco…” he tries to catch his breath, stroking Draco’s head, whimpering when the Slytherin kisses his softening cock lovingly, making Harry feel like jelly. “Come here.”
Draco takes his clothes off and takes a shower to calm his nerves. He doesn’t hear the floo, nor the noise of the apparition, but when he gets out of the bathroom with just a white towel wrapped around his waist, Potter is standing there.
“Fuck me, please,” he moans and Draco kisses him one more time and then moves back, his trembling fingers digging into the flesh of Harry’s hips as he takes position behind him. Harry hears the liquid sound of lube against skin, then he sighs and takes a deep breath as he feels Draco’s cock gently pressed against his hole.
“Mmmh…” he mumbled, “Malfoy?”
“Take your jumper off,” Harry said, his voice hoarse, “I want to kiss your neck.”
Harry replies with a simple
Harry wishes he could kiss him, but he grins and laughs, relieved and happy. And then he feels it, Draco’s lips against his through the thin fabric of the cloak. He closes his eyes and lets Draco kiss him, chastely and tenderly. He wonders how many kisses their great-grandfathers have shared on that same sofa and then smiles.
“Thanks for the honour, your highness,” Harry replies, wrapping his arms around Draco, pulling him flush against his chest and letting his thigh slide over the blond’s. “I like sleeping with you.”
“Do you want me to stop?” Draco asks, letting go of his cock with an indecent sound that makes Harry want to beg him to continue.
“Shut the fuck up, Blaise,” Draco hisses.
“I’ll kiss it better,” Harry said, sliding his hand under Draco’s jumper, trying to get it off, “send her a Patronus. Stay here with me.”
“Mate, you look dreadful,” Ron comments, toothbrush in his mouth. “Did you actually sleep, or did you spend the night wanking?”
Harry lets the praise ripple through, as the orgasm makes him feel soft and relaxed. He shuts his eyes for a few seconds, his mouth open as he pants, inhaling the smell of sex and of them. Malfoy’s skin. His come.
“It was weird,” Harry grins, “but kind of fun.”
“You can tell them,” Draco says, peeling an apple for him. “You’re nearly four months and the midwife said the baby is doing well. I was planning on visiting Mother next Saturday to tell her myself, if that’s okay with you.”
Harry leans into him and closes his eyes, breathing in Draco’s familiar scent.
“Hermione, I’d rather not,” Harry mutters, his eyes moving from Ron to Hermione, then locking with Draco’s. There’s a calculating glint in the silver depth of his eyes. A curt nod, almost imperceptible. “I’m sorry, I have to go. I need to speak to someone.”
“I can put the cloak back where I found it, under his pillow,” Zabini says airily, a knowing smile on his face, “and keep quiet about what I found out. At the end of the day, it’s none of my business. Whatever makes him happy.”
“Do you seriously think anyone else would want to do this with
“She’ll tell me off for leaving it to the last minute,” Harry replies. “Especially after she spent a whole evening preparing my revision timetable and essays schedule.”
“I didn’t ask what you’re going to do. I asked what you
“That’s why I am going to give you the freedom to study independently and attend the lessons that you need in order to complete your studies,” she continued, “you are all eighteen and old enough to be responsible.”
“I was having a panic attack and Malfoy helped me,” Potter explained and McGonagall looked at him, raising an inquisitive eyebrow.
Feathers.
“Merlin, fuck…” Draco gasps, “you feel huge…”
“T’as besoin d’aide, Draco?” she shouts and Draco nods enthusiastically.
“For taking me on this trip,” Harry replies, a contented sigh escaping his lips as Draco abandons the book and starts stroking his hair. “For telling me so many interesting things about all the places we visit. For organising everything.”
“Yes, but I’ve wanted to kiss you since the day you sent me that drunk owl,” Harry replies, letting his honesty slip out in the darkness. Draco’s breath hitches.
“No, she’s gone to the Ministry to ask them to let us take money out of our vault, so that we can buy my potions. I took the last dosage this morning, so I won’t have any left from tomorrow morning.”
I post my Drarry microfics
can do to make things work a little bit better. Make the ex-Death Eaters do something useful, like rebuilding Hogwarts. Make them help with the charities that look after war orphans. But don’t let them stand in the street, just to get covered in insults and dirt. That’s not what the Kingsley I knew and respected would have done.”
“Harry,” Robards greets him, looking imposing in his Head Auror robes. He casts a quick glance at Draco and then motions at a small door to their left. “It’s nice to see you. If you don’t mind waiting here with your trunks, we need to run a few checks on Malfoy before you can make your way to Grimmauld Place.”
It’s past midnight and Harry hopes against hope that Draco will be on his own. He sends his Patronus, telling the Slytherin that he’s there, but he doesn’t know where his bedroom is. He gets no answer, but he remembers Draco saying that he couldn’t cast a Patronus, so he puts his cloak on and walks towards the Manor. He circles the house, looking for a sign, until he notices something. A pale hand waving a white handkerchief on the first floor.
“A silly song about a star,” he replies, closing his eyelids. He looks worn out, dark circles under his eyes, like smudged ink on his porcelain skin. Harry wishes he could wipe them away with the gentle pressure of his fingertips. He wishes they could sleep together, to keep an eye on Draco and his nightmares, to console him if he wakes up in the middle of the night.
Harry nods and convinces him to stop on the way to the beach to visit one, marvelling at the ancient constructions and letting his fingers run on the rough stones.
“I need to go,” he replies, wondering if he really has to. “I’ll see you tomorrow. Or later.”
“Harry, I’m so proud of you.”
Last chapter! I really hope you enjoy it.
“I’m going to bed, too,” Neville interrupts his maudlin thoughts, patting Harry’s shoulder. “I’ve left a calming potion on your bedside table, just in case you have those horrible nightmares again.”
“What if I want to keep them?” Draco replies, raising an eyebrow. “What if I want the wounds to scar and leave a reminder of what happens when you make bad choices all your life?”
“I’ll pass,” Harry says, shrugging. “I’d rather take a break and go abroad with you. I’ve only ever been to France and Germany, and that was during our Auror missions.”
“Okay,” Harry says, stepping out of the car and nearly getting run over by a bicycle zooming past him. “What the fuck, oi!”
Harry can hear Draco’s loud intake of breath and he takes his hand,  smiling at the familiar comforting feeling.
She looks at him and then at her son, with furrowed brows, a silent conversation going on between them.
“You see that one over there?” he says, tracing a line and then a circle above it. “That’s Ursa Minor. And just there, see, the tail of the dragon.” He makes Harry’s hand slowly go up and then down, then up again as if tracing a wave. “That’s the head. The Draco constellation.”
“What about the rest of the house?” Harry asks, sounding more desperate than he means to.
He lets Argo leave and carry his letter to the Manor and the day stretches endlessly, the longest by far since he has moved back to Grimmauld Place. But the owl doesn’t return that day, nor the following one and Harry thinks he’s going to go mad. That the wait is going to kill him.
“I’m a sticky mess,” Draco complains, looking for his wand.
“How can you say that?” he asks, furious. “These are your things. They cost a fortune and you love them because they’re beautiful, you said it yourself. How can you give up on them so easily?”
“Well, I hope you enjoy your time here with Zabini,” he says.
He should probably ask Draco, but he settles for Ron instead.
It’s kind of worse, Harry thinks, since now he can clearly see how beautiful Malfoy looks from up close.
Harry’s taken aback by his breath-taking beauty, by how pale and glowing his skin looks, by his long hair shimmering as if there were diamonds in it. It’s much longer than the previous week, inexplicably, and it now goes past his shoulders. There are no traces of the dark circles under his eyes and Draco’s complexion looks immaculate, like a porcelain doll. His lips are pink and beg to be kissed and Harry finds himself walking towards him, his arms stretched, desperate to touch and kiss and claim.
Henry and Perseus continued seeing each other. Not everything was over.
Harry looks at Hermione, and he prepares for the bollocking of the century, when she suddenly moves and walks past him, sitting down in front of Goyle.
“What are you thinking about?” Draco asks, holding Harry’s slicked-up cock and lining himself up, making the tip of Harry’s dick rub against his hole. Harry gasps, placing his hands on Draco’s waist, his fingers digging into soft skin.
"Of fucking course it's you," Draco groans when Potter appears at the front gates of the Manor five minutes later, looking tired and gloomy. There are dark circles under his eyes, and messy curls lie limp over his forehead, barely covering his famous scar. His cheeks are gaunt and covered in dark stubble.
“Ron,” Harry hisses, the anger bubbling to the surface, “Ginny and I were done even before the war ended. We’re not meant for each other! Besides, she has a new boyfriend, and I…”
“Fuck, you’re going to make me come like that,” Harry mumbles, trying to think of something else, but Draco stops moving around his cock, his mouth leaving him with an indecent sound.
"Well, that was satisfactory, Potter"
Draco cups his cheeks and kisses him softly on the lips, and Harry finally feels his body relaxing.
When Malfoy comes back, smelling lovely and clean, Harry keeps his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. He listens to the sounds of Malfoy getting ready for bed, moving around the room. He’s barefoot on the soft carpet, the sound muffled and gentle. Harry feels the bed dip under the Slytherin’s weight. It’s such a huge bed that they’re far apart, the distance feeling impossible to break. Then Harry feels it, the lightest of touches, brushing a curl off his forehead, gingerly tracing his scar. He doesn’t move and tries to commit to memory the feeling of being touched there, by Draco Malfoy. The finger trails down his nose and then is feather-light on the tip of his lips, just to disappear a second later, as if Harry had imagined it.
He knows Potter took him in only out of pity and convenience, but hearing it out loud makes him feel utterly worthless.
“What’s the matter?” Harry asks, moving closer to them and noticing the way Ron’s hand squeezes Hermione’s, so tight that she winces in pain.
Harry is suddenly aware of the nauseating stench that is coming from some of the rooms, and he gags as he covers his nose.
“I…” Harry starts, running his shaking hand through his hair, his mouth dry and parched.
“Darling, I’m back,” Narcissa says from outside the door and Harry makes the jump. He apparates outside the gates of Malfoy Manor and gets rid of his blindfold, fishing his glasses from the pocket of his robes. He’s panting and he casts a cleaning charm on himself while he decides what to do. He can’t really go to the pub to use the Floo; people would notice him and report it to the papers and then he would get in so much trouble for leaving Hogsmeade.
Finally.
And Harry would like to agree, but his mouth has gone completely dry because Malfoy has suddenly decided to bend over to retrieve a piece of parchment from the floor and his arse looks like a work of art, especially since he’s only wearing the top part of an armour and what looks like extremely tight trousers.
Parkinson meets his gaze, frowning at him, then she turns towards Hermione again and smiles sweetly at her.
“I would like us to be civil,” he says, desperately, and then the wolf acts again, probably losing its temper. Harry’s hand grabs Malfoy’s and the blonde stops, glaring at him.
Harry runs, as fast as he can, with a horrible feeling in his stomach. He pants and sweats, but he runs until his legs are sore and he’s finally on the shore. The sun is already setting; there’s a pink hue in the sky, enough light to see Draco’s lonely silhouette on the shore. His feet are in the freezing water and he’s crouching down to look for something.
speak Italian?”
What if Malfoy tells the papers?
“It was lovely, thank you,” Harry replies, still wary around him. “Are we so dangerous that we need none other than the Minister of Magic to escort us back to Hogwarts?”
“Draco, fuck…” he groans and then his heart skips a beat when Draco shifts and he hits that spot that makes Harry see the stars again. “Shit, there, Draco…please…”
Harry contemplates asking Zabini or Parkinson if they know where on earth Draco is, but the Slytherins seem to dread talking to any of them, and then the Sorting Ceremony begins. Harry sits through it worrying about Draco, coming up with a million scenarios of where he could be, of what could have happened to him.
Harry was going to the Burrow, even though he kept on asking Draco if he was going to be fine without him.
Draco runs to the en suite and puts his bathrobe on, then he goes to the door and opens it with magic.
“I’m a bit tired,” he confesses after an hour has gone by, half a pint sloshing in his stomach. “I think I’ll head back.”
Harry steps into the room he was shown and begins to wait. It’s clearly a room for guests; it’s quite bare and has a table full of magazines, but nothing else.
“Fuck,” he mumbles, covering his face with his hand. He starts walking back and doesn’t make it home. He ducks into a side street and gets his wand out.
They lie down in silence for a few minutes and Harry feels the tears soaking his blindfold, Draco’s fingers trembling on his chest, like a butterfly fluttering against his heart.
“Thank you,” Harry says, stealing one of Ron’s chips.
“There’s not much that I can do,” he replied with a sigh, “I will have to find a place to live to finish my sentence. I suppose they will have sold the Manor by then. I will try to find a job.”
That night Potter goes out for the first time, dressed in a t-shirt and faded jeans. Draco sits on the sofa, a book in his lap, wondering if he’s going out with his friends.
Kingsley stands there facing him, Harry’s hand still on his arm. He’s holding it tight, and he realises it probably hurts, but he doesn’t care. Not anymore.
“I don’t have any treats, I’m afraid. I don’t own an owl anymore,” he explains and the bird makes a disappointed sound and then waits. “You can go, you know.”
“Is that a cat?” Harry asks, startling them both. The cat takes a step back, but Draco kneels down next to him, extending his hand. He waits patiently for the kitten to trust him, and smiles when it finally steps closer and nuzzles his hand.
He took a quick shower, wincing at the way the water burnt on his healing cuts and bruises, and then he looked at himself in the mirror and grimaced. His lip was purple and swollen and he was sporting a black eye. He couldn’t remember ever looking so ugly and miserable.
“It would be great for both of you,” Marelli says, grabbing a tin full of cinnamon biscuits and offering them to Harry and Draco. “A change of scenery, after all you’ve been through. Plus, the food there is out of this world.”
“We begin with Muggle Studies and slowly start pairing up with them in every subject,” she says, making Ron groan in protest. “We also need to keep an eye on them in between lessons and in the library.”
“Draco?” he starts, taking a step towards the blonde, hesitating when he notices the way his partner’s eyebrows crease, a desperate look on his beautiful face. “What’s going on?”
He remembers all the times he used to lie awake in his cupboard under the stairs, waiting for the morning to come. He puts his hand on his belly and he inhales deeply.
Harry takes a step back, embarrassed, and feels his own cheeks colouring, noticing how Malfoy’s are already a deep shade of red.
“The first time you let me sleep with you,” Harry confesses. “He kind of blackmailed me.”
Hogwarts feels more like home than Grimmauld Place, but can he really go back to being a student? He feels a million years old. Like he can’t really go to lessons and be carefree like the rest of the students. Like he ought to be.
“No…” Harry says, “for mine…I’d like to.”
“I can come with you, if you want,” he offers. “I’ve had to ask for it myself a few times. Pomfrey is really nice, especially after the war.”
“What are you doing?” the Gryffindor asks, moving closer with caution, as if approaching a dangerous beast.
But becoming a Medi-Wizard sounds amazing. He enjoys learning healing spells, making himself useful. Helping people feel better.
“Draco made it more bearable,” Luna says. “He sat outside of my cell for hours, reading me books.”
He packs his trunk, shrinking his clothes and his books under Potter’s watchful eye. He takes the photos of his mother, and a few of her possessions, just in case one day she remembers who she is. Just in case she remembers she has a son.
Harry nods, then shakes his head, then lets out an embarrassing sob.
Potter hired him to help him fix his house. He had moved back into Grimmauld Place after breaking up with the Weaslette and had been living there for a couple of years, but the house was a complete and utter mess. It needed deep cleaning, fixing and renovations. Potter had tried, but it was a job for a professional like Draco and, besides, the Gryffindor was still working as an Auror at the time, so he was too busy.
Malfoy’s left eyebrow shoots up, and Harry feels like stomping on his foot before the Slytherin makes one of his snarky comments. But Malfoy doesn’t say anything, and he quietly leads Harry down the same dark corridor and into the spacious library.
“Auror Hopkins needs you to sign a few documents first,” Page says, avoiding their eyes and pointing at a lonely desk in a corner. Hopkins waves at them and Draco removes his hand from Harry’s elbow, walking towards the desk.
“You want to go back,” Draco murmurs, kissing the side of his lips, a knowing smile on his lips.
“What do you know about Veela mating rituals?” Harry asks, sitting down next to her. Hermione seems to study him for a few seconds and then she sighs.
It’s three in the afternoons, but Harry accepts, mainly because he feels bad about using Aberforth’s floo and he also wants to use it again next week. He really hopes he’s not about to get questioned on his escapades when the old man stands in front of him watching him eat.
“Why can we only do this once a week?” Harry says, “I want you every day.”
,” Harry reads out loud and then waits for Malfoy to explain again.
“Wait, where are you going with my tea?” Harry asks, but the cup is already at the end of the table, and then takes a jump, pouring its content onto the floor as it starts wobbling towards the door. “Oi, that’s my tea! Come back, you wanker!”
“Of course, I’m coming back,” Draco replies, realising it’s the first time Potter’s called him by his given name. “I live here.”
The corridors are empty as they head for the Headmistress’s office, so Harry grabs Draco’s hand and holds it all the way there.
Draco’s been clear about it. He doesn’t want Harry’s reputation to be tarnished with his mistakes. And if word got out that he’s a Veela, his life would get even more complicated, so they’ve agreed not to tell anyone.
“You collect teacups?” Harry asks, his lips tugging into a smile at the thought of Malfoy arranging an array of china and sipping tea, his little finger raised in a posh pose.
He tries to describe Hermione’s shattered family, the memories still struggling to resurface.
Harry stops in his tracks, looking at her, and feels nothing but happiness.
He lets his legs carry him, a mechanical reflex, one step at a time. Out of bed, out of his room, outside.
“First of all, they’re called
But Harry thinks that loving someone is not something that should be given for granted. There’s no “of course” for him when it comes to his biological family. He thinks about Petunia, and he shudders.
And then Harry just leant closer and brushed their lips together, because he wanted to, and now he could. Because Draco’s cheeks turned a lovely shade of pink every time Harry kissed him unexpectedly, and Harry just loved to see him flustered.
“I have nightmares too,” Malfoy replies. “I know what it’s like. Read this.”
“I’m sorry,” he says.
“Are you for real, Potter?” he asks, clearly in disbelief, then shakes his head. “You’re unbelievable.”
“I love you,” he whispers, feeling Draco tremble against him. “I’m also starving, so I’ll go get us some food. I’ll be quick.”
“That’s Monsieur Black,” Teddy says matter-of-factly. “He’s the French teacher.”
Silence.
“Are you staying tonight?” he asks, laying a kiss in the corner of Draco’s lips, enjoying the way the blond reaches for a proper kiss on the lips.
“For the pain,” he said, “and take them without complaining, because otherwise I will shove them down your throat myself.”
“There’s literally nothing on gay sex. I could only find this book that mentions anal sex. There’s a whole chapter on how homosexual encounters are immoral and should be punished by law. That’s insane!”
Hopkins, the Auror in charge, decides they should split and focus on different areas of the house. There are just three Aurors today, plus Harry. Shacklebolt insisted on him tagging along, saying that the Auror force had been depleted during the War, and they needed extra help. And Harry just couldn’t say no, especially after two months spent alone at Grimmauld Place, between one funeral and the next, feeling dead inside.
As soon as they step into the Floo, Ron quirks an eyebrow at them and elbows Hermione with a cheeky grin.
“Take me to bed, then.” It’s a hot whisper in Harry’s ear that sets his blood alight. Harry brings their lips together for a searing kiss that leaves Draco gasping and reaching back for more, his long fingers sliding through Harry’s messy curls. When they finally part, Draco’s lips are red and wet, parted on a desperate sigh. “I want you so badly. You have no idea what you do to me.”
“Mum, it’s my friend Harry!” she shouts, and then her bushy hair appears on the doorway. “Sorry, Harry. Please, come in.”
It’s like an electric current shaking him to the core, making the room swirl around him. He closes his eyes, wishing to end it all, when he hears Marelli shout.
“I deserve it,” Malfoy says, his voice hard, eyebrows furrowed.
“I’m bored,” he declares. “We’ve been staring at these books all week.”
“Harry.”
Harry feels Draco’s eyes on him, and he wishes he could shout to the whole world that he has already found someone. That he only wants to be with Draco Malfoy. But Draco doesn’t even want to tell Blaise about them.
And then Harry uses his lips to explore and to heal. He kisses Draco’s chest, his tongue tracing the thick lines, skidding over his nipples and making the Slytherin gasp, his fingers sliding into Harry’s curls.
“You could have everything. Anything you wanted,” Draco murmurs, his expression serious. “New expensive clothes, a perfect house, someone worthy of you by your side. Why do you settle for second-hand clothes, Grimmauld Place and me?”
“Too risky,” Draco replies, climbing off his lap, making Harry groan in frustration, running a hand through his messy curls. He’s ridiculously hard and just wants to feel Draco’s skin against his, taste him and kiss him all over. “Maybe next Saturday…if you bring your stalker map again, we could check where Blaise is.”
Scorpius just stays there watching as Ron walks over to his family, kissing Aunt Hermione's cheek when Rose's head pops over his shoulder. She smiles at him and waves causing him to grin and enthusiastically waves back.
"HARRRRRRY POTTER!!" Draco yells grabbing everyone's attention and making quite a few people jump at the immense anger burning in his eyes.
"Under what retrospects?" The preacher asks not giving up on this wedding.
"Why did you let them touch you? They aren't allowed to touch you, only I can," Draco mumbles against his stomach as he continues to cover it in hickeys. "Now everyone knows you belong to me."
"Well, then stop calling me weasel and I'll stop calling you ferret," Ron says getting another laugh out of his daughter making him roll his eyes.
When they get to breakfast he sits down and sees that he is sitting between Ginny and Seamus. They are the two most touchy people he knows so to have Ginny's hand on his bicep and Seamus's hand on his thigh (He does it to everyone subconsciously), he starts to get really hot. So much so that he subconsciously takes off his scarf placing it in his lap.
"I thought you were dead," Draco cries trying to get some sort of control over himself but can't seem to.
"That I'm in love with the groom," Harry says making everyone gasp as Draco stares crying and runs straight into Harry's waiting arms.
So, Harry stands there waiting and waiting till the preacher finally says, "If there is anyone to refute these two getting married may you speak now or forever hold your peace." Harry takes a deep breath, drops his cloak, and steps out into the aisle way. Instantly, Draco's eyes snap to his and he freezes.
"Excuse me! What about my wedding!?!" The red headed girl yells angrily, her voice like nails on a chalkboard. Even in his crying state Draco is able to flip her off and jump up so that he is grappling Harry like a koala as he's carried out of the chapel.
"What?" Harry asks looking at him confused as he had spoken so quietly but Draco only shook his head and continued to cast warming charms. "What are you guys going to do to me?"
"It's good to be home," Draco sighs hugging Harry seemingly even tighter than before.
"But what if your father finds out you helped me escape?" Harry asks worriedly as he tries to quickly undo his other cuff to grab Draco and get out of there. But as he rushes forward Draco has already closed the gate smiling sadly.
The next thing he feels is the stomach plunging feeling of apparition when he finally focuses on the fact that they are in his home, actually it has never been a home to him. Harry was his home.
"But father, it's cold do-" Draco is trying to protest but receives a slap to the face and the cloak is thrown off to one side of Harry, out of Draco's reach.
"Yes, but where is this new house?" Draco asks not daring to look at his father as it is partially his fault that his boyfriend is dead.
Let's just say, there wasn't many places that didn't have a hickey by the time he was finished that night. Harry blushed like a tomato for a week as people pointed out the hickeys covering his neck and the constant limp as Draco had his way with him every night since.
"Nope, I'm absolutely dreadful at it. You should ask my dad, I tried to draw him once and he looked like a squashed potato with a red wig," She chuckles causing Scorpius to breakout into laughter.
"Sorry, dad threw it straight into the fire, I don't blame him though," Rose says causing Scorpius to bite his lip to contain his laughter.
Scorpius starts to think of things she could possibly do while here when he looked over at his father. Harry was dipping him making father laugh very loudly, something Scorpius had never seen before Harry.
"I'm unsure if he even knows your alive, Harry." Hermione's comment floors him and he just stares at her is shock terrified that she may be right. "He did leave as soon as it was announced you were dead, I don't think he even saw you fall out if Hagrid's arms."
When Harry gets up the stairs he looks around but Draco is already gone and he doesn't have enough time to look for him so he runs. It will be many years before these two see each other again.
Harry buries his face in hands as his entire faces is bright red. Then he feels a hand grab his robes, pulling him out from under the table, and dragging him out of the Great Hall doors.
Harry spasms crying out in immense pain but not enough for him to pass out. This continued for almost an hour when his hands are finally removed from their hanging position and he is dropped on the floor.
He stands up, leaving his cloak with Harry, and walks towards the door. "Why don't you come with me?" Harry asks as he starts to unlock his cuffs behind his back.
Draco lays on his bed feeling lost and alone while the one who usually holds him and comforts him, when he feels this way, is dead. He just wants to go back in time and for everything to be like it used to be.
"You have to have known we would catch you sooner or later," Lucius sneers slapping Harry, leaving what will most likely be a large welt on his face. "Look how pathetic, can't even protect himself."
When the fighting had finally come to end so long ago all Harry has wanted to do was wrap his boyfriend up in a tight hug and just go home. But he soon came to learn that Draco fled at the beginning of the fight with his family. Sure he was happy Draco was safe but he thought he would have wanted to be with him afterwards to know that he was safe and very much alive.
Draco sighs walking forward and crouching in front of him. "What are you-?" Harry is saying as Draco places his hand in Harry's cheek but is quickly cut off.
When Draco once again returns he is alone and looking for the cloak he had left behind after his father had ripped it off of him. But what he sees when he enters the dungeon makes his heart skip a beat. There Harry Potter is, laying on the ground wrapped up in his large cape with only his face peeking out.
Harry doesn't quite understand how it happened, one moment he was at the park near his aunt and uncle's house when suddenly everything went dark. He woke up in this cold, damp room about an hour ago and he's been freezing his butt off since.
Scorpius is one of those who deciding to stand beside the dance floor and smile widely as he watches his father and Harry, his new dad, being so happy. Scorpius is also happy, until he looks over to see Rose, Uncle Ron's daughter frowning at her plate of food.
He's most definitely not fine because his boyfriend of two years, well secret boyfriend, is dead. He's not here anymore, no more kisses after dark when they sneak into the Room of Requirements together. No more secret meetings between classes when Draco typically ends up getting pressed against a desk or the wall. He really doesn't know how he's going to live now that Harry's no longer here with him.
"It is a home I purchased many years ago under a secret account, so no one can find us," Lucius states and Narcissa just nods in understanding as they all look around at their new house.
"I don't know, not that much I guess," She says nonchalantly making Scorpius pout.
"Do you draw?" He asks.
"What's wrong with that?" Harry asks his eyebrows knitting together not understanding why they are freaking out.
Harry gulps worriedly before yelling back pretending to be angry as well, "WHAT?!"
He shocks Rose by bowing and kissing the back of her hand when there is a loud exclamation. "Rosie, No!" It's Ron as he storms over and lifts Rose into his arms cradling her to his chest as she pouts up at him. While Draco lifts Scorpius off the ground and places him behind him. "I am not okay with this!"
Scorpius bites his lip nervously before turning back to Rose. "Would you like to dance?" He suggests giving her a shy smile while she just raises her eyebrow.
"IT'S A HICKEY, MALFOY. YOU SHOULD KNOW-" Harry is saying but stops himself because they had agreed to keep their relationship a secret. Mostly because Draco is bloody terrified that his dad is going to find out and disown him. So now Harry is wondering where he's going with this scream off.
"Harry, you're bloody freezing!" Draco gasps staring at him in utter shock.
"They are both only eight, far too young for this," Draco says looking at Harry with a glare making a 'humph' sound as he crosses his arms and tuning away, but still not removing Harry's arms from around him.
"Father says that about Uncle Ron all the time as well!" Scorpius exclaims causing them both to break out into laughter.
They had moved to France and even with everything Lucius Malfoy has done, he is still a very rich man. He fits in quite easily with the higher class in France and within that year an arranged marriage was set for Draco. Harry was devastated when he found out but he swore he wasn't going to let him slip out of his fingers again.
He grabs her hand and pulls her out to the dance floor as a slow song comes on and he gets nervous. He lightly placed his hands where they need to go as her's go on his shoulders.
"Okay, then if not drawing, do you play any sports?" Scorpius asks to which she nods her head enthusiastically.
"Let's wait and have some fun of our own," Lucius smirks looking at Harry with an evil glint in his eyes. "Crucio!"
She looks at him for a second before grinning and responding, "I did too, I hope we are able to do it again. I think we'll be great friends."
"What's wrong?" Harry ask confused about the ruckus they were both making.
Harry is wondering if anyone is actually here when the door to this, so called, dungeon creaks open and in walks Lucius followed closely by Draco as he doesn't dare look at Harry.
"Rosie and Draco were dancing! And he kissed her hand!" Ron exclaims wide eyed and clutching her to his chest as if trying to protect her from the people around them while she just rolls her eyes at him.
Hopefully they'll become friends.
"Yes, well father has been quite nervous about the whole Weasley family get together topic because of what happened during their school years. I don't know all the specifics but I do know my father wasn't very nice," Scorpius sighs looking at her apologetically as if he had anything to do with his father's actions as a child.
Harry has been looking for Draco for the past year and is happy to finally admit that he finally found his boyfriend.
"I suspect so, what I've heard aren't the nicest things about your father, but that's as a child. The comments have gotten less mean but my father still believes him to be a prat," Rose says causing Scorpius to laugh.
"Yes, I have taken lessons for many years," Scorpius grins up at her as she frowns making his smile drop a little. "Do you?"
Draco only hums as he starts thinking about all the things the Harry could instead do to him. He definitely can't let him get into Voldemort's hands, so he must risk his own head.
"I would like to refute this marriage!" Harry exclaims causing Narcissa to gasp as she turns to see him standing there, before looking down at her lap in shame.
"Well, we can't have that," Draco says casting multiple warming spells to help him get his feeling back. "I quite like your bottom half, it would be a shame to lose it."
Harry's face can't quite decide if it would rather be a sneer or pout as he looks up at Draco. "Well yeah, it's freezing down here and you left it in reach. If you guys would actually try to keep this place warm while I'm held prisoner here maybe I wouldn't have stolen your cloak."
"Draco, grab his arm and help me lift him into a better position," Lucius demands and Draco only nods but trips over his large cloak making Lucius growl in anger. "Take that bloody thing off, I told you not to wear it!"
But to especially be kind to those who are sad.
"Fine ferret, see you at Christmas!" Ron says turning around and walking away while waving at him without looking.
"France," Lucius answers and Draco only nods before walking off to find his new room and unpack.
"Do you even know how to dance?" She asks looking at him skeptically while he is almost offended, but it was merely a simple question.
"OH HOW SILLY OF ME, THAT'S RIGHT. I GAVE A HICKEY TO HARRY POTTER BECAUSE HE BLOODY BELONGS TO ME," Draco basically screams looking straight at Ginny and Seamus as they slowly remove their hands. Harry is just left there staring shocked that Draco wants to come out like this. "EVERYBODY HEAR THAT? THAT'S MY POTTER! NOBODY TOUCH HIM!"
When the wedding march begins Harry gets nervous that he won't be able to do this, maybe Draco will be happier without him. But when the door opens and Draco's expression doesn't change Harry knows he has to do this.
"Now grab his other arm," Lucious barks angrily as he grabs the arm that Draco isn't holding and they adjust Harry so that his arms are being held above his head with his feet just barely touching the ground.
"A little but I'm not terrible," Rose shrugs hoping off of her seat. "Sure, I'll dance."
"Well, Draco's a ferret," Ron says making a snort heard from behind Draco. Draco then turns to see his son coming his mouth with wide eyes as he look at him with a raised eyebrow
Draco looks at him with a sad smile before responding, "You know I can't do that, father would kill me."
In utter embarrassment Harry slides under the table to hide from all of the watching eyes. Sure he wanted to tell everyone they are together but to do it in such a way is preposterous. He was thinking about doing it more subtle than this, such as: no more fighting, holding hands, smiling, BEING NICE.
Ever since Harry came into the picture three years ago, when he was five-years-old, his father and him has taught him to always be kind to others. Not that father told me to be mean before Harry but he was very distant and didn't seem to talk about it, when they did talk that is.
"I'll be right out," Harry responds as he wraps the scarf around his neck to hide the blatant bruises and opens the door. No one comments on the scarf until they meet up with Hermione in the common room.
"That's not important now. I refuse to let my son dance with weasel's daughter," Draco says dramatically and is a little surprised when Rose starts laughing.
She turns looking at him not saying anything for a little while before responding, "I'm bored and I want to go home. Dad made me leave my book at home so now I have nothing to do."
Draco stares straight into Harry's eyes possessiveness as clear as the sky is blue. "WHAT'S THAT THING ON YOUR NECK? THAT BIG RIPE BRIGHT PURPLY BLOTCH THERE?!" Draco seethes and Harry Potter is bloody sweating bullets, wondering why he's pointing it out.
"Then I hope to live to see the day you win," Draco says before running back up stairs as Harry fumbles with the key as his hands shake trying to open the gate door and get out of the dungeon.
He continues to eat and have his conversation with Ginny when Hermione clears her throat. "Um Harry, what's on your-?" She was asking when she is cut off by a loud bang. More specifically, Draco slamming his hands on his table angrily as he stands up on his feet.
Just looking at the photos he has of them together makes him start crying. He doesn't care if Malfoys aren't supposed to cry. Screw whoever came up with that rule. The boy he loves is dead and he is allowed to mourn, but now isn't the best time to do so.
He is then slammed up against a empty class room wall. His tie is gone and his shirt is open exposing all of the other hickeys littered across his skin. "I went easy on you last time," Draco basically growls at him making Harry have to hold back a moan at his possessive nature. "You are mine, Potter."
So, on the day of Draco's wedding Harry shows up in a tux ready to crash his wedding. Sure, he's not someone you would normally see crashing a wedding but he doesn't care. He wraps his cloak around himself and walks inside. As he walks around trying to find the chapel he hears screaming and comes to see a dark red haired girl in a wedding dress yelling at one of the other girls in the room. Harry frowns but continues down the hall.
"Christmas! What is he talking about!?!" Draco exclaims to which Harry's arms disappear and he scampers off the dance floor. "Harry! What is he talking about!?!"
"I would if you weren't such a coward and released me from the chains," Harry spits at him only receiving a sneer and kick to the rib.
"I love you so much," Draco cries gripping Harry so tightly his hands turn white.
"Grab everything you wish to bring with you for we are not returning," Lucius's voice pierces Draco's thoughts and he heads towards his bedroom. He grabs his endless bag and starts throwing everything in it. Clothes. Trophies. Photos.
"All yours," Harry breaths as Draco begins his process of covering his entire body in hickeys.
"I love you too," Harry whispers back as he kisses his forehead and apparates back to Grimmauld Place. "Welcome Home."
"Shut up," Draco growls yanking his trousers and pants down in one go and continues covering him from head to toe in hickeys.
"Neither am I!" Draco responds glaring at Ron as he receives a glare right back. Harry then comes up behind Draco ruffling Scorpius's hair and hugging Draco from behind.
When he heard this, time seemed to stand still and all he could focus on was the lifeless body in the giant's arms. He couldn't breath and subconsciously walked to his parents as they called out to him. He didn't hear anything anyone else said around him, not his parents not Voldemort not even his own mouth as he reassures his mother that he's fine.
"Yes yes, whatever. When are you going to ever let that one go, it was one time," Draco sighs looking at Ron exasperatedly.
So, Scorpius heads over to Rose and stands beside her gaining himself a glance, but that was all. He sighed a little but didn't give up so he asked, "What's wrong?"
"Harry!" Ron yells through the bathroom door grabbing Harry's attention as he grabs the scarf he set down on the sink. "Are we going to breakfast or what?"
She doesn't seem entirely less bored but at least there's a small smile on her face. "So, what do you like to do other than read?" Scorpius inquires to which she just shrugs.
He knew he couldn't do it on his own so when Hermione begged him to finish his seventh year he refused and instead joined the aurors. And when he was able to go on missions and research incidents, on the side he looked for Draco. He knew he could find him.
"Harry Potter is dead!"
1 year later
"Stupid Draco and his beautiful mouth," Harry grumbles as he inspects his neck in the bathroom mirror. The large hickey as clear as day on his tan skin, Draco would just love to torment him about it. The perks of having to pretend to hate your boyfriend in public. "Why do I let him do this?"
"Should we contact the Dark Lord so that he knows we have captured him," Draco asks in a quiet voice as he glances at Harry but looks away when their eyes meet.
Draco and Lucius leave right after with a regretful glance back from Draco, but he doesn't say anything.
“Draco!” Pansy throws herself into her friend’s arms and Draco’s expression finally softens. His fingers slide through Parkinson’s dark hair, and he whispers something that Harry doesn’t catch.
“Fuck,” Harry murmurs, shuddering through the feeling, noticing how he has just stained Malfoy’s expensive-looking bedsheets with his come.
“Fuck,” Malfoy says.
He doesn’t have the courage to say it, because he has no right to be. Draco is not his boyfriend, and he doesn’t owe Harry anything. And yet the blond shifts a little bit closer, his warm hands moving on Harry’s skin.
“Well, well, well,” Zabini appears from behind the dressing screen where Malfoy changed his clothes the day before. “Interesting information you’re sharing with us,
“Eww,” Harry says, swallowing it in one go and gagging.
Merlin, he’s so tired. He just wants to wrap himself around Draco and fall asleep in his arms.
“We’ve moved Blaise’s things and yours,” Draco announces, a thrilled expression on his face. “I also rearranged things a bit, so the room feels less like a dorm and more like a bedroom.
Harry places one of his hands on Draco’s knee and the other on his thigh, staring at him.
“If you think you’re going to take advantage of the situation to hurt him,” Pansy hisses, “you’re deeply mistaken, Potter.”
“It’s just the
“That’s reassuring,” Draco commented sarcastically, “what the fuck happened in the Forest?”
“Yes,” Harry mutters, feeling stupid. He follows Malfoy’s skinny body as it goes to the bathroom, leaving the door open again. Harry contemplates getting dressed or snooping around, but he lies on the bed instead, closing his eyes. The sheets are ridiculously soft, and the pillow smells like Malfoy, citrusy and something so peculiar that Harry thinks must be just his skin. He closes his eyes and inhales. He suddenly feels incredibly tired again, all the strength leaving his body. He curls up in a ball and thinks it would be nice to just disappear like this. Naked and sated, irretrievably broken inside.
Harry’s anger snaps. He feels the magic leaving his body, unable to contain it, and then it’s too late before he can actually do anything about it.
“Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says, clearing his voice. Narcissa’s sad eyes land on him, but barely seem to register his presence. “I came to visit you.”
Hermione turns and frowns at them, giving Harry a scolding look, so he’s quiet for the rest of the lesson, trying to stay awake and take notes, but failing to. He’s too distracted by Draco’s fingers, moving on the parchment as he scribbles down his notes. The back of his hands are red over the knuckles, as if he’s punched something, but it’s actually covered in tiny cuts and grazes. Draco moves his hand away when he catches him staring, looking embarrassed as his cheeks turn pink.
He’s most definitely besotted.
“Will you stop being a twat and quit jumping to conclusions?” Harry asks, losing his patience as Draco is nearly at the door of his bedroom, making a dive for his wrist. Draco’s eyes focus on where Harry’s fingers wrap around his wrist before he finally looks Harry in the eyes, silver irises burning with fury.
“Is she always like that?” Parkinson asks, emerging from the girl’s room. “I swear she spends ninety percent of her time worrying about schoolwork. And she’s still at the top of every class!”
“Show-off,” Draco says, rolling his eyes, but he kisses Harry again, enjoying the way the slow drag of his tongue on Harry’s makes him moan and reach out for more. “What kind of important business?”
, he thinks.
“Fuck,
Harry laughs and locks their lips in a kiss that starts playful, but soon turns tender and soft. Harry’s hand travels down a pale chest, tracing the raised edges of scars with delicate fingertips, before resting on Draco’s hip.
“Fine,” Harry comments, looking superior.
“You’re back early,” Ron says when he sees him, “trouble in paradise?”
He doesn’t want to move out, and leave Potter alone in his gloomy house.
Harry thought he had done an excellent job at hiding his commitment to the club. The excuse of a study group seemed to appease Hermione, and Ron was too busy trying to spend quality time with his girlfriend to care. He assumes Neville is just tagging along and got dragged here by Ron.
When they’re lying in the dark later, Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s thick curls and kisses his forehead.
“Mrs Malfoy,” Harry mumbles uncertainly, his voice sounding panicky to his own ears.
“Leave. Now,” Draco tells the man, his voice pure ice and barely suppressed rage. “Get the fuck out of our house, or I’m going to hex your balls off.”
Draco takes a step closer, thumbs hooking under the towel, making it slide down his hips. It hits the floor with a soft thud. Potter’s breath hitches in his throat, and his fingers tremble as they hover inches away from Draco’s naked skin.
,” the Prefect says, and then she leaves, wishing them a good night. They are all about to go into their respective rooms, when Harry hears voices from outside the portrait. He exchanges a glance with Hermione, and then he goes outside and finds two men wearing Auror robes dragging Draco by the elbows, pulling him and swearing.
“Theo Nott?” Harry asks and he hates how his voice cracks and the way Draco looks at him, like he’s about to break. “I thought he was living in the Shetland Islands.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry replies, holding Draco’s hand, feeling it safe and secure against his palm. “I’m afraid that’s never going to happen. I wish you all the best, Chloe.”
“I told you already,” Draco replies, tucking his hair out of his robes with a graceful gesture that makes Harry flutter his eyelids like a love-sick puppy. “What I want does not matter.”
“Have you at least asked?” Harry continued, unperturbed.
But he has nothing to do there.
Harry feels suddenly incredibly tired. He’s been up since four, and his stomach is pleasantly full. He takes his shoes off and lies on the sofa, closing his eyes.
“I’m staying here,” Draco replies. “Where else would I go? I’m still under house arrest. Are you off to the Burrow?”
“But before that,” Harry whispers, closing his eyes to feel Draco’s thoughts as they seep through him, like a gentle wave lapping at his consciousness. “Before that, you want me to suck your cock.”
“Wait, I’m going to change,” Harry says, wondering how long it will take him to take the robes off with the myriad of tiny buttons. He can’t ask Malfoy to cast a spell to undress him; that would be too much. There’s still a weird feeling in his chest at the thought of Malfoy taking his clothes off, wondering how it would feel to have those long delicate fingers on him.
“I don’t want to ever feel like that,” Draco says, “I don’t want to live a life full of regrets. But I’m so terrified, Harry…”
“Ron!” Harry says, outraged, but then Hermione comes in and shoves her husband aside to hug Harry and then Draco, who receives it stiffly.
Terry scowls at him, shaking his head as he goes back to his Charms essay.
Did Malfoy just call him hot?
“Nice to see you too, Granger,” Draco replies, raising an eyebrow as he puts a bookmark on the page of the volume on advanced potions he was reading. “I gather Potter hasn’t told you about me living here.”
“Were you expecting a letter from someone?” Ron teases after dinner, as they’re lying in the dark in his bedroom, like they’ve done so many times over the summer. Harry waits a few minutes before replying, trying to find the right words.
“There you go, Potter, let it all out. Shout and scream. Insult me all you like.”
“I owled McGonagall and explained my situation,” Draco says after a bit. “She was very understanding and said I can still take my N.E.W.T.s at the end of the school year.”
“When are you going to leave your job, dear? It should be a matter of days, now,” Molly continues pressing. “You won’t be on paternity leave for long anyway.”
“I will be careful,” Harry promises, wanting to leave, to be left alone.
Harry laughs and pulls Draco closer for another kiss.
“I know it’s late,” Harry says, “but I want you to do the tattoo now.”
“Hermione, you’re scaring me and I’ve never heard you swear so much in my life.”
“Keep your door open, dear!” her mother calls from the corridor. Harry raises his eyebrows at Hermione, and she just shakes her head and sighs. They sit on her bed, and Hermione casts a silencing charm on the room.
“Maybe I should leave,” Harry says, feeling out of place. Malfoy seems to gather his bearings, sliding his fingers through his own hair.
“What?” Harry says, his voice soft, already cracking.
“Thanks,” Harry replies, his cheeks flushing at the unexpected praise. Draco looks at him, then brushes his thumb under Harry’s eye.
“Go and speak to Draco,” Hermione tells him. “Now.”
“I don’t want to be an Auror anymore,” Harry whispered much later, his head resting on Draco’s chest, “I can’t do this anymore. Draco…I just can’t…”
“Draco, you need to step back. I am serious!”
curse, his lack of intention, Dumbledore’s words. Draco is not a murderer.
Draco’s bored. He’s trying to clean and repair the Manor, just like Harry is with Grimmauld Place. He’s avoiding going out, in fear of being attacked. He’s terrified that someone might try to kill his mother. He’s letting his hair grow, making Harry wonder what he looks like now.
On Monday morning he Apparates with the rest of the Aurors to Malfoy Manor, knowing full well that he’s making a colossal mistake and that he will regret it. Malfoy’s waiting for them at the door, stiff and solemn in his formal black robes, buttoned up to his Adam’s apple. He looks even paler than usual, white hair resting on his shoulders and falling in gentle waves around his delicate face.
“I…” Draco starts, his voice a mere whisper, as if afraid to let his heart speak, even in the safety of their bed. “I want to feel home somewhere again.” Draco’s eyes close, a lonely tear falls down his cheek, and Harry wipes it with his thumb.
Harry looks at Draco’s pale hands, he notices how the skin is red and broken over the knuckles, tiny little cuts criss-crossing over the raised blue veins. He brings Draco’s left hand to his lips and kisses it tenderly.
“Can I read you something?” Draco asks and Harry nods, “I found some new letters yesterday and there’s one your great-grandfather wrote that has been on my mind since I read it.”
By the time Harry manages to make his way back to the castle, failing several times to walk past the swarms of admirers and reporters who want a piece of him, the sky is dark and it’s late.
“There we go,” Draco rolls his eyes. “A botched-up healing spell is everything I need, Potter.”
“I know,” Draco says, his fingers stroking Harry’s face, softly, as if he were about to break.
“Oh,” Harry says, and he wonders if Malfoy is going to use it to communicate with him. Is Harry Malfoy’s lover? It’s not like they’ve had sex. They have merely wanked together, and Harry has occasionally come on Malfoy. Does that count as sex? Harry is not entirely sure.
He wants to be somewhere else.
“Trouble in paradise?” he asks, and Harry sighs.
He wants to go back.
Chloe seems surprised by the question, but then she nods.
“Eat up, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“I think you got what you deserved and I don’t pity you,” his words cut like a blade, but Draco couldn’t really argue back. Potter was right. And his sentence was actually lighter than expected only because Potter and his friends had testified in his favour, saving him and his mother from Azkaban. “I didn’t want to share a room with that Ravenclaw lunatic anyway. And Smith is a knob; everyone knows that. At least you will avoid getting hexed and I won’t have to wake up in the middle of the night with a crazy fan taking pictures of me while I sleep. So it’s a win-win situation for both of us, don’t you think?”
“I think it has probably been caused by stress and trauma,” she gently says, her fingers resting on his shoulder, making him flinch, “which is understandable, considering what you have been through. I think a Mind-Healer would be able to help.”
“Do you have any experience with men?” Malfoy asks and Harry stops in his tracks, wondering if he heard correctly.
“Don’t you dare!” Draco says, wiping his eyes as he pours more tea into a light green cup that sprouts bird-like feet and patiently waits for him to announce how much sugar he wants. “Only milk, please, dear.”
Hermione writes a long-winded owl to the Ministry to complain, and Harry’s sure that McGonagall has already done her part, but it’s all in vain. Every Sunday morning, when the
Draco lets a small smile illuminate his beautiful face and then he nods. He finishes his tea in silence and then he hugs Harry, a brief and sweet gesture that leaves him weak in the knees, before flooing back to his house on the coast.
He wasn’t surprised by the fact that Potter knew where they were, nor by the way he got in without any issue and the House-elves nearly threw a party when they saw him. What really baffled him was seeing Potter handing him a plate full of food and sitting down on the floor next to him, filling his mouth like a caveman and munching loudly on his full English breakfast.
“Is this some kind of lover’s quarrel? Or a Mexican standoff?” Smith asks, perched on a sofa with a smirk.
“Fat chance,” he replies, “she’s meant to leave for Hogwarts on Wednesday. Enjoy it while it lasts, Potter.”
“I’m all yours,” he whispered back, coming untouched, just from Harry’s fingers inside him.
Not enough air.
“Does it say anything about you fucking me senseless in the toilet?” Harry asks cheekily and Draco glares at him, outraged.
Harry can feel his own cheeks catch fire as Malfoy’s eyes widen in sudden realisation of what is going on in Harry’s pants, and before he can Apparate somewhere else and die of shame, he feels it. Malfoy’s own cock. Hard and stiff against Harry’s belly.
,” Draco says, and a puff of blue smoke swirls around him, then circles Harry’s chest, until it takes shape in front of their astonished faces.
Harry feels like laughing, but then the door suddenly opens, and he wakes up.
“You mean fighting?”
Harry mutters something, trying to think of an excuse not to comply, but he finds none. He undresses under Malfoy’s attentive gaze, leaving only his underwear on and feeling naked all the same. Malfoy tilts his neck and makes an appreciative sound at the back of his throat and then finally hands Harry the blue robes.
“Fuck, Harry…” Draco mumbles. “I think it’s worse since you’re shit at
“But I’m fine now,” Harry insists, as Draco cries angry tears next to him, “and I want this baby to grow up with what I didn’t have. I know that I had a fucked-up childhood, Draco, but I swear I’m going to make things right for our baby. I’ll shower him with all the love I never got.”
hairy chest!”
He used the little strength he had left to cast the spell one more time.
lenses, darling,” Zabini drawls from a corner of the room and Harry notices the way Zabini is slouching on an expensive-looking sofa, like a rich lazy cat. Harry can’t see very well without his glasses, but he notices a seventh-year Gryffindor student sitting next to Zabini, his face turning crimson when he locks gaze with Harry.
"My wardrobe is full of your clothes," Harry adds, fingers gently playing with Draco's hair, "and I can't remember the last time you went back to the Manor to spend the night there."
“No, I suppose it’s not,” muttered Potter, “dinner’s ready, by the way.”
“Can I get rid of our clothes?” Harry asks timidly and Draco nods, his fingers already dipping under the elastic band of Harry’s underwear. A small flick of his wand is all it takes to finally feel Draco’s warm skin pressed against his. Harry sighs and lets Draco run his fingers all over his skin, his lips leaving open-mouthed kisses everywhere. Harry closes his eyes when Draco finally enters him, still lying on his side, holding his leg up to grant Draco access.
“Here she is,” Ron announces with a smile, spotting his sister as she makes her way through the crowd.
“How did you know that treacle tart is my favourite?” he asks, suspicious, and Malfoy starts laughing. Harry feels something happening to his stomach at the sound of his childhood nemesis laughing with mirth. He’s used to Malfoy sneering and snickering at him, but this sounds different. It
He gives up and tries to sleep, managing a few hours in between nightmares. He feels an utter wreck in the morning, dark circles under his eyes and hair messier than usual.
The morning goes by in a blur, and Harry finds it strange to be back, to sit in lessons after he’s been through a war. He struggles to focus and to take notes, his mind wandering off, trying to catch a glimpse of Draco. He sits next to him in History of Magic, beating Parkinson to it and making her scrunch up her nose and huff as she takes a seat next to Zabini instead. Hermione eyes him curiously, but he manages to avoid her inquisitive gaze.
“And what’s changed now?” Harry asks, looking around the room and noticing how the flowery sofa looks less worn-out, and the room is clean and bright. Even the tapestry looks less old and decrepit.
“Ron,” Hermione chides, “I don’t think Harry is just planning on sleeping with someone. He clearly wants a romantic relationship.”
Harry enters the Great Hall and takes a deep breath as he sits down in front of his friends.
Harry falls asleep with a smile, his face feeling a bit odd after crying for so long.
Maybe that’s the real reason he wants Draco so desperately. The blond was clear about not wanting to continue their weird wanking habits at Hogwarts.
Harry contemplates getting a take-away, but then he feels a bit pathetic eating it on his own, thinking there’s no point. It would be a waste of money anyway, especially when he can cook. He swings by Sainsbury’s for his weekly shopping and buys the ingredients to make himself a simple dinner.
in his hand.
Harry feels his cock reacting to Malfoy’s words, wishing he weren’t so attuned to Malfoy’s voice and the desire that is creeping up like vines, enveloping his heart.
By the time they reach the apparition point, Harry is fed up and tired. He just wants to be alone with Draco, away from this madness and from the prying eye of every single Ministry employee. People keep on whispering behind their backs, most of them glaring at Draco, and Harry gets more and more frustrated and irritated by the minute.
“Leave me alone, Potter,” he replies, his voice so icy that Harry’s blood feels like frozen water in his veins.
Of who he has done it with.
“Fuck off,” Harry laughs, swatting his hands away when Draco tries to steal another chip. “Order your own.”
"What?!"
He’s not alone anymore. He can face a bloody Boggart.
He wants Draco inside him.
“Draco…” he murmurs, sounding desperate.
Pale fingers clutch the paper, grey eyes opening wide as a plump lip starts wobbling.
“I…” Draco says when Harry pauses, uncertain if he’s said too much, “Harry, I’m…”
“Do you still want to kiss me?” the Slytherin whispers in the dark.
Harry lies there in the dark, eyes wide open, trying to catch his breath. Draco’s warm hands glide over his body, making him relax little by little. He turns to face the blond, nudging his nose and then kissing his lips softly.
“Malfoy?” he calls, sounding a little too desperate. He casts a
Harry counts the hours until Draco’s return, then realises that he has no clue at what time the blond will be back. By lunchtime? Mid-afternoon?
Harry nods, his lips wobbling uncontrollably, teeth chattering as he feels a shiver running down his spine. Draco quickly fills the bathtub and then starts working on Harry’s clothes, taking his jumper off with care, running his fingers down Harry’s arms and chest. Harry steps out of his underwear, shaking, and Draco takes his hand and guides him to the tub.
, where I also post my drarry microfics.
Harry hears a sob next to him and Draco’s hand squeezes his, then he feels a body pressed against his and he rests his face against Draco’s invisible shoulder.
“Why do you wash them so much?” Harry asks, remembering Zabini’s words. He doubts Draco will answer him, if he can’t even discuss it with his best friend, so he adds, “you don’t have to tell me. It’s okay.”
He doesn’t know what the fuck is wrong with him.
“Of bad things,” Harry finishes his sentence. “Of the war. And I just…go soft. I hadn’t been able to get off in ages before we started…at the Manor.”
“What did you do?” Harry asks, weary, but Malfoy shakes his head, ignoring him.
“Good for you, Potter. No need to rub it in now, though,” Draco says, glaring at the Gryffindor twat.
“Let me get this straight, Harry,” he whispers calmly. “You gave yourself a panic attack because you thought I had sex with our DADA professor and an Auror who treated me like shit?”
“What?” Harry asks, his mouth half-full of porridge. Hermione grimaces and her frown deepens.
They sleep through the night, and Harry wakes up to find the blond staring at him.
“My sister-in-law said she would be happy not only to have you in her DADA institute, but to also offer you a scholarship,” Marelli says. Draco’s mouth opens and closes a few times before he lets out a tiny sound.
“Salazar, Harry,” Draco says, a gentle hand on Harry’s cheek. “You’ve opened the floodgates, love.”
“What?” Harry asks, and Draco flinches, covering his face with his hands. “You’re the most ridiculous man I’ve ever met! You’re not even earning anything at the moment.”
“Part Veela,” Draco answers, his voice breaking, “the first man to manifest the traits in my family was Perseus Malfoy, since apparently his mother was a Veela.”
“We’re going to be late for our first lesson,” he announces, and grabs his bag while Ron is still frowning and muttering how insane the whole situation is.
They're sleeping together, so peaceful.
They stay in Antwerp for a night, taking a walk around the city centre.
“Were you expecting to see someone, Harry?” Luna asks with a serene expression on her face and Harry nearly chokes on his pumpkin juice.
Johnny Flynn, “
Okay, he’s not the best at etiquette.
He will explain that he got surrounded by hordes of fans and reporters.
“You could have used a domdom,” she deadpans.
“Big news today,” he mutters and Hermione shushes him.
“It’s not safe,” Draco shakes his head, eyes finally opening and landing on Harry’s crotch. He bites his lips and seems to regret his own decision, to reconsider. “What if Blaise comes back, or if your friends come looking for you?”
“Better be safe than sorry,” Hopkins replies, looking gloomy. “I would recommend keeping both the key and the toy car in your pockets at all times.”
“No, I’ve barely seen him in his Veela form, just for a handful of seconds. I have been wearing a blindfold every time I visit him.”
“If you say so,” Ron replies, looking unconvinced. Hermione eyes him curiously, as if she could see right through him. Harry wonders how good she is at
Draco’s silver eyes shine in the light of the fire, the shimmering fabric of the invisibility cloak making him look almost ethereal as he leans closer, closing his eyes.
“You don’t have to say that just because you want to be polite,” he eventually murmurs. “I’m going to let you get off on me anyway.”
“We’re going to floo to the local pub,” Harry explains. “They know me because sometimes I pop by when I visit my parents’ graves, so they won’t make a fuss about me being in Godric’s Hollow. And then from there we’re going to look for the house.”
“Draco…” Harry says, sitting up and placing his hands on Draco’s wet cheeks. Grey eyes lock with green.
“No worries,” Harry says, doing his best.
“Potter, contraception in order to avoid STDs is extremely important,” Zabini declares, looking all serious. Harry sighs and grabs the banana, catching Draco’s mischievous grin out of the corner of his eyes.
But when he steps out of the classroom, Draco is there.
Harry writes the three little words and then stares at them for a good ten minutes. An almost illegible scribble, two inches long, that barely sums up what he feels. There’s a storm in his heart. It feels so full that Harry thinks it’s going to shatter any minute.
“I love you,” Harry says, a stupidly happy smile on his face.
was living at the Manor. Miffy used to leave a corner of the larder empty for me.”
Hermione tries to argue, but Harry grabs a banana and a bread roll, and he swiftly leaves. The next lesson is Herbology, so Harry heads for the Greenhouses, taking his time as he walks the long way towards the school grounds. Draco catches up with him when he’s halfway there, his expression inscrutable.
At ten past four (he doesn’t want to look too keen) Harry turns up to Study Room 3 and is greeted with another “Welcome to the Slytherin Host Club” when he opens the door.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry says, breathless, caught in a never-ending orgasm, as Malfoy groans and starts coming too, all over Harry’s hand and softening cock.
serious. I’m so sorry.”
“I can’t,” Harry replies, feeling nervous, “I can only go at one. Can’t explain, sorry.”
“He isn’t?” Harry asks, touching his stomach.
“Are you meeting up with the other Slytherins at King’s Cross Station tomorrow morning?” Harry asks, fingers idly tracing the hard edge of the photo frames on Draco’s chest of drawers.
They spend the rest of the morning in silence, flicking through books and dividing them into two neat piles. On Malfoy’s side of the room, they put the potentially dangerous books that will go to the Department of Mysteries, and on Harry’s side they pile up the inoffensive ones that might get sold for charity.
“I didn’t open your present,” Harry confesses much later, when they’re lying naked in his bed. “I figured you didn’t want me to do it in front of everyone.”
“Want you,” Harry repeats. Draco kisses him again, deep and messy, their tongues sliding against each other as Harry gasps.
When the owl is peacefully sleeping in an old cage that Kreacher found in the loft, Harry finally settles down in bed, the letter clutched in his hands. He stares at it and wonders why on earth he’s feeling so excited about it.
“You could always get a room at the Three Broomsticks,” Harry suggests, “just go upstairs and… spend some time together?”
“I’m not staying here,” Harry replies tentatively. “Draco is coming to Grimmauld Place with me.”
“No,” Draco replies, dropping to his knees and looking up at him, his eyes pinning Harry to the spot. “You’re going to be quiet for me. Can you do that, Harry?”
“Yes,” Draco’s reply sounds like a desperate plea, “please. I’ll wait for you. I’ll write to you.”
“History lesson is over,” Harry says, putting his little coffee cup down. He misses his tea, and unfortunately, they’re running out. Tea in Italy is shit. He ordered it once in a café and they brought him iced-tea, which confused him a lot. “I’ve seen an ice-cream shop on our way here, and I want to try pistachio gelato this time.”
“Thanks.” It’s the tiniest of murmurs, but it resonates through Harry’s body, making a small smile bloom on his lips as he watches Draco’s expression soften and his fingers clutch the teddy for dear life.
“We don’t have any more time,” Draco explains, “Mother’s coming back soon. I’m sorry, but you need to leave.”
Malfoy’s fingers gingerly touch his shoulder and Harry flinches, realising that this is the first time the Slytherin has purposely touched him since they’ve started doing this
“Oh fuck!” she swears, covering her mouth with her hand, “oh I’m so fucking stupid. Why did I not think about it sooner? Bloody hell, it’s so ridiculously obvious!”
His lungs won’t work.
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry says solemnly, “would you like to go out on a date with me?”
“I want to,” he replies, and a single tear rolls down Draco’s cheek. Harry wipes it away with his thumb and then sucks on it, letting the saltiness burn his tongue.
They spend what’s left of the morning looking at old photos and letters. Harry is surprised to find so many pictures of his ancestors in the Malfoy’s archives. He has barely seen any photos of his father and none of his grandparents, and here they are, all carefully stored in a lovely box in Malfoy’s storage room. Harry thinks it’s not fair Malfoy gets to have a piece of his family, when he has nothing.
He didn’t dream of it.
“Draco is going to have a heart attack,” Pansy whines, looking at Zabini. “Maybe we should break the news before anyone else does.”
The orb begins to rotate, and it’s clear to all of them that it’s missing a piece, as if a chunk had been carved out.
“Potter, you can eat your scones and shag later. We only have a few hours of daylight left.”
He wants to never return.
He’s too foolish and messy and broken.
, and then we’re going Christmas shopping. Do you have any idea what I can get Hermione’s mum?”
When Draco’s happy about the safety of the house, they finally step inside and Harry can’t help but gape. There’s a loud
He practically runs to the common room, checking his watch and realising that Draco should be back by now. He knocks on his bedroom door, but there’s no answer. He immediately walks to the Gryffindor dorm, looking for the Marauder’s Map.
He doesn’t know if the question will annoy the blond, but he hopes for the best. The answer appears after a few minutes, as if Draco were thinking about whether to reply or not.
“Nonsense,” Malfoy replies.
Harry’s fingers stretch him open while he sucks a bruise into Draco’s pale neck, marking him as his, and then he slides inside him as they’re still lying on their sides. Draco moans and whimpers, feeling like he’s falling apart, while Harry pushes into him as deep as he can reach.
“You’re being overdramatic,” Harry says, his lungs feeling suddenly tight, too tight. He tries to take a deep breath, but he can’t.
“Touch yourself,” Harry mutters, feeling like he’s going to come any second now. “I’m not going to last. It feels too good. Oh, Draco,
You can come and say hello on
“Just the usual procedures,” Robards replies flatly. “I will see you on your way back, unless there are issues. Auror Page will run additional checks on Malfoy’s belongings, and then you can be on your way. Have a lovely Christmas, my lad.”
Harry feels the darkness envelop him as the door shuts in his face.
“It’s easier when I write,” he replies after a moment, “but when I have you in front of me…I’m just worried that it will be the same way it’s always been between us.”
“You should spend some time away,” Ron suggested. “Just leave for a few days. Let it run its course.”
“I will have that parchment and quill you were scribbling on during my lesson,” she announces, and Harry feels his heart sink.
“The usual,” Draco replies, “your favourite.”
Draco smiles and bumps their noses together.
“Is it me?” Xenophilius asks, but Harry shakes his head.
“I missed you, too,” Harry replies, squeezing him back and exchanging a fond look with Hermione. “How did it go?”
But Draco fails to move, his eyes still fixed on Harry as his magic swirls around him, making his robes billow in the wind and his hair swoosh around his temples. Marelli grabs his elbow and tries to push Draco outside, but Harry’s anger suddenly spikes up, making the professor wince in pain as he’s hit by a powerful stinging hex.
“Mione, you grew up as a Muggle,” Ron reminds her at lunch. “Why are you so worried about Muggle Studies?”
"About what?" Harry asks, because he doesn't want to get his hopes up. He can't.
Instead, he goes upstairs to the bedroom that he’s picked for himself, but that has never felt like his own.
“Harry…”
"Ron and Hermione told your boss you had Spattergroit," Luna explains. "Draco came to look for you. Loads of times."
Malfoy’s grey eyes finally meet his, and Harry stops in his tracks, kettle still in hand, watching him, admiring the way his pale eyelashes flutter and his pink lips quiver. Harry allows himself to inhale deeply, filling his nostrils with Malfoy’s breath-taking scent again.
Harry thought he still had a chance to win Draco’s heart. He’s been waiting for an opportunity to ask him out and make a move. They’ve both been single for ages and Harry thought they were finally on the right path.
“What do you suggest?” Harry asks. “It’s not like we can go out and have a pint at the local pub. You’re under house arrest, and I get surrounded by reporters everywhere I set foot.”
Harry saw him at the Trials when he testified in his favour, but Malfoy was just a lonely and broken figure those days, sitting across the room with his hands in his lap and his back bent. Malfoy quietly listened to Harry’s statement, explaining how the Slytherin had saved his life by pretending not to recognise him. Harry remembers Malfoy’s light hair looking dirty and tousled, the dark circles under grey eyes, a broken and bruised lip. He wondered what kind of treatment he had received in Azkaban while waiting for his trial.
He forgot about the things he stole last summer, and he suddenly feels ashamed about it.
“Why don’t you keep the parchment on your pillow?” Draco suggests. “Write to me, and if I’m awake too, at least we can chat and you will feel less lonely.”
“There’s something I’d like to try,” Draco confesses in the dark, Harry’s fingers tracing lazy patterns on his chest, following the raised edge of a scar that leads nowhere and then picking a new one to trace. “Father said he never managed to cover his Mark after the first war, but I reckon that’s because
Harry’s hot mouth closes around Draco’s pale neck, trailing kisses up his Adam’s apple, until he sucks on a spot that makes Draco whimper and clutch at his top.
“You should simply ask him out, if you’re that interested,” Parkinson says, crossing her arms in front of her skinny chest. “But I doubt he will say yes.”
“A picnic by the lake,” Harry says, bewildered by the situation. It’s dark and freezing, but he wouldn’t want it any other way. “Thank you, Draco.”
Draco brushes his hands away and Harry hears the rustling sound of fabric, but he’s too busy tasting Draco, sucking on his bottom lip and making him gasp to worry about how long Draco’s taking to get rid of his robes.
“I didn’t hear you complain two minutes ago,” Draco replies, elbowing him. “You’ve never come so hard.”
In hindsight, why on earth would Draco accept his offer, considering what Harry’s done to him in the past?
, not chocolate.”
He buried his nose in an old book, one of the few things he had managed to salvage from the Manor in that long summer spent clearing and scrubbing it clean, supervised by a team of Aurors, who barely said a word to him during those months of silence and loneliness. They took care of the magical artifacts and the mess the Dark Lord had left behind. He was simply asked to clean, making that massive house presentable again. The Ministry was hoping to find someone willing to buy it. Shacklebolt had told him that the money would be used for the War Fund, a charity that looked after the orphans and the families who had lost loved ones in the War.
“Oh yes,” Draco replies nonchalantly. “Mother made me learn French and Italian when I was little.”
“It’s not as bad as it looks,” Draco comments.
“Harry?” Hermione’s calm voice makes him jump. She looks hesitant, but she’s dry. Her hair is shorter, but it looks okay.
The rest of the afternoon goes by in a blur, and when Chloe appears in the doorway, saying that they’ve temporarily secured the West Wing and they can all finally go home, Harry follows her. He casts a longing glance at Malfoy, but the blond avoids his eyes and just distractedly waves at him.
“That sounds ominous,” Harry says with a grimace and an anxious glint in his eyes, “do you have to go abroad again? How long is it this time?”
, truly feel for the first time in ages.
“But Harry,” he hears Hermione argue feebly.
Harry is looking forward to doing DADA again; it used to be his favourite subject after all. The one he feels most confident at. Used to, at least. Now his magic is all over the place, and he feels like he can barely control it.
Draco’s blushing cheeks are worth a thousand words.
Sometimes Harry gets up quietly, without waking up Draco, and has a quick wank in the shower, wishing it was Draco’s fingers or his delicious mouth around his cock. He usually comes in long spurts against the bathroom tiles, feeling mildly guilty and unsatisfied.
When Harry gets home, he feels his skin on fire and he’s even more restless than before. He decides to take a shower and as he gets undressed, he thinks about pale skin, long legs with sparse blond hair, elegant feet. He feels his stomach in knots as he remembers Draco’s hair and soft-looking lips, his voice. He’s not even surprised to be hard and slowly tugs on his cock in the shower, closing his eyes and letting the water wash away his confusing thoughts, leaving the raw want and need to touch. To feel Draco’s skin against his. To kiss him. To see him naked.
Both Ron and Neville are snoring loudly when he gets in his room, so he takes a quick shower, trying not to make any noise.
“I need to take a shower and you need to rest,” he said, his cheeks darkening, his hands tugging at his messy locks. And then he left, opening the bathroom door and closing it behind him. Draco heard the shower run and then all noises ceased. A silencing spell.
“They took my wand away when they collected me in the morning,” Draco explains, his voice low but still discernible in spite of the loud chatter around them. “They only gave it back to me when I was escorted to the castle.”
Harry stops and realises that he’s happy.
“Draco, let’s go,” he pleaded.
“I don’t…there’s nothing to tell…”
“Harry?” Draco asks, sounding surprised. “What are you doing?”
He was irretrievably lost. A broken ugly thing.
“How-“ Harry looks around, checking no one is eavesdropping, “how do you know Argo?”
Harry is at a loss for words, gaping at her and feeling tears threatening to come out again. He mutters a feeble
He doesn’t know why he’s said it out of the blue. Did he want Malfoy to know he was going to be there, too? That whatever they are doing can continue next year, and it’s not going to end when summer comes to a close?
Draco’s slim elegant feet splash in the water, his pale skin glistening in the sunlight. The scars on his face and neck are visible, and he looks beautiful and happy. Harry thinks he’s dreamed about this, about him and Draco being together here, happy and relaxed. In love.
“Your hand,” Harry answers, staring back at his stormy eyes. “Could you please touch me?”
“Brilliant idea,” Blaise chimes in from behind Harry., “I know just the perfect spot and if you do my Muggle Studies homework, I can make sure it’s going to be absolutely deserted.”
“It’s none of your business,” Harry replies angrily, making Ron frown at him.
“Shut up, Pansy,” the blonde says, raising an eyebrow at the team of Gryffindors who have just invaded the Slytherin Host Club. “May I help you?”
“You would make a fine Auror, Harry,” he says. “Are you sure you don’t want to reconsider your decision?”
“Kinderdijk,” Draco announces, taking Harry’s hand to get him to move, because Harry is completely rooted to the spot and his feet won’t budge. “There are nineteen windmills to see, come on Harry.”
“How so?” Harry asks relentlessly, making Malfoy frown and cast a fuming glance at him.
“Yes,” Harry replies, noticing Dumbledore’s double thumbs up move and Snape’s unfamiliar fond gaze towards Draco. “I don’t care about what other people think. I just want to be with Draco.”
…” It’s too soon, he thinks. He wants this to last for an eternity, but he was already so hard when Draco started going down on him. Draco hums and takes him deeper, and Harry lets go, coming into the delicious heat of Draco’s mouth with a shuddered gasp, unravelling for him.
