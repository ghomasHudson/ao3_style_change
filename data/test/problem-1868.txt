Harry’s not sure Hermione’s standpoint speaks to someone like Narcissa Malfoy, but he supposes it doesn’t matter. Next to him, Draco’s face is pink, and he’s vehemently nodding his approval before he jumps on his feet, too.
“Just get on then, Malfoy.”  Hermione raised her brows at me.  “Come on Ron.  Doesn’t do any good to get in fights right now,”  She mumbled, pulling Weasel away.  She pursed her lips and gave me a stern look before looking at Pansy, her look softening slightly.  I glanced to Pansy, who was now blushing slightly.  I rolled my eyes and grabbed her arm.
“I wonder if Potter will blow up at the new professor here too,” Blaise said quietly as we got closer to the hut.  A group of students were already surrounding the new professor.
I led us carefully back to the edge of the woods.
. “You want one?”
“Good sides.  Right.”  I smiled sadly.
I zoned out as Dumbledore began speaking again.  This Umbridge woman’s presence here could only mean one thing — the Ministry was attempting to invade Hogwarts.  Hogwarts was already rubbish at teaching most subjects, as my father so informed me of Durmstrang’s “proper education”.  Now, with the Ministry being as ignorant and greedy as ever, I doubt this year bodes well for our education.  Umbridge resembled more that of a pygmy puff than an adult human, let alone one educated enough to teach.
One, I’m incredibly stupid, as is this plan.
“Oh!  Also!”  She reached into her pocket.  “Here.” She handed me a piece of parchment.  “I wrote the note for you. It doesn’t look like your handwriting, so he shouldn’t suspect anything.  Not that he would notice anyway, he’s pretty oblivious.”  I laughed.
"Don't worry about it. I understand." Draco finished off his drink and eyes the next round of shots, wary of the consequences. He had already drank quite a bit with Pansy before seeing Harry's band, and the shots and VK Harry had passed him were already taken effect. Why do I have to be a lightweight? "All I was trying to say is that I've spent a lot of time growing up in the past year. A lot of self-discovery." Harry nodded and turned back to the bar, ordering more drinks. Draco paused, assessing if he could handle it, assessing if Harry should even be ordering more, before remember, ah yes Harry was performing and likely hadn't already been drinking, unlike Draco who was tipsy when the night started, a few hours before Harry's set. Might as well, he eventually decided. I'm bound to fuck up tonight, at least with alcohol I'll have an excuse, or maybe I won't even have to remember.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?”  she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
"Pansy," Draco laughed when she came home with all of it.  "I can't wear all of this!  I'll look ridiculous! I do have some dignity left!"
“Even if he did accept it and liked me back,”  I shrugged.  “It wouldn't work."  She sighed.
“Say you were expecting me.”  She shrugged again.  I stopped for a moment and glared at her.  She smiled sweetly and went back to painting her nails.
“Right,” I laughed, shaking my head.  “Look, Harry’s been in detention for a while now, I assume he’ll be out soon.”
“No!  It wasn’t him!  It can’t be!”  My hands were shaking furiously and my voice on the verge of breaking.
"Glad to hear it." They held each other for a moment in silence. "Why'd you wait so long?"
"You were banging around in here so I came to make sure you were alright!"  Draco chuckled and rubbed his jaw.
"And here are your training partner assignments.  Remember, you'll be studying, training and living together for the rest of your training."  The Auror trainer handed everyone a paper with their assignment and Ministry provided address.  Harry mentally groaned when he looked at his —
I had reached a point where I couldn’t cry.  My throat felt dry and my body sank into the bed.  I couldn’t move.  I thanked Merlin for the silent night; it made thinking easier.  As the room lightened in the morning, I still couldn’t move until well after breakfast.  Pansy found me shortly before the Leaving Face.
“I truly hope we won’t hear the same speech in every class,” I muttered.  We made our way to Potions early to snag a good seat and get on Snape’s good side for the start of term.  The warm classroom filled quickly as we talked idly.  A few moments later, the door shut loudly and I glanced over my shoulder to see the Golden Trio take their seats at the back of the room as Snape billowed in.
“Oh hell no.  You are going.”  Pansy poked my arm and I groaned.  “We have a nearly foolproof plan.  Even if something goes wrong, you can just bully your way into your version of the truth.”  I stared at the canopy above me.  She was right.  Nearly foolproof.  Nearly.
"Malfoy, just try it alright,"  Harry huffed, grabbing Draco's elbow and dragging him in.
"Pres,"  Harry smirked, passing him a glass of golden liquid.  Draco threw his head back, downing the drink in one gulp, before placing his book on the end table.  Harry refilled the glasses after drinking his own.  Both men hissed at the burn of the Firewhiskey.
“Why are you being nice?”  I glanced down the hall behind him.  People were going to start coming down the corridor soon.
“How was your year, honey?” My mother asked as my father stalked into the drawing-room.
Just as I started serving myself some eggs, Blaise came running in and threw something on the table in front of me.
“We have class,”  I murmured.  He nodded.
"Thanks."  He drank half of it while Harry stood awkwardly by the bed.  Draco noted he was still wearing his jeans.
“Not at all,” She said sharply before marching back to our compartment.  The three remained exactly how we left them, Blaise awkwardly staring out the window as Crabbe and Goyle leaned towards each other in rapid conversation.  I sat next to Blaise and Pansy across from us.
“I know.  You’re doing your best Harry.”  I rubbed light circles on his back, trying to soothe his tense muscles.
"Hmm?" Draco froze with Harry so close. He was acting much more casual than Draco ever would have expected, especially after all the time that had passed. "Um sure."
“Thank
Harry was actually glad they were able to move past their old rivalry.  He felt terrible about what had happened before and during the war.  They talked over drinks at a Muggle bar after Draco's trial, both men apologizing for their mistakes throughout school.  Harry still felt guilty for the
“Yeah.  I was an extra mouth to feed and extra body to cloth.  I was nothing more than a menace.”
“A fantastic way to draw attention to himself. It’s as if he’s looking to get caught.” He snorted. “I doubt he’ll be allowed back in Hogwarts this year.”
“Draco, my boy, read this headline,” He said as I walked in. I arched a brow and leaned over his shoulder to read it.
“That’s good.  You can tell him tonight.”  She spoke quietly as if she was scared she would startle me.
“Maybe,” I muttered so that only Harry could hear me.  “The stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.”
"Still waiting to meet that Ginny girl you broke up with," Jasper smirked. They broke up — that actually makes sense. Her and Lovegood seemed very, very close. "She seemed good."
“What are you talking about?”
“Potter attacked me, sir —”
“Hospital wing, Goyle,”  Snape said calmly.
“Yes sir.  Hagrid has been removed from his post, for the time being—”
“Please.”
"I'm great,"  Harry sighed.  He closed his eyes and began dozing off on Draco's shoulder.  At that point, Draco set down his book and smiled at the sleeping man.  He sat there until the record finished.  He debated letting Harry sleep on the couch but ultimately decided to carry Harry to his bed.  He thanked Merlin that he was already in wearing sweats and he wouldn't have to strip a drunk, sleepy Potter.
"I've got— hmm—" Harry pulled away slightly as Draco kept leaning in. "I've got a flat, not too far from here—"
“Yes sir.”
“We landed in a graveyard.  At first, we thought it might’ve been part of the tournament so we took out our wands.  Then we noticed this guy walking towards us, he was holding this bundle in his arms.  When they got close, my scar started burning and I dropped my wand and this cold voice just like… whispered to ‘kill the spare’, and the guy just… just…” Harry let out a slow, shuddering breath.  “Used the killing curse on Cedric.”  My jaw and heart dropped.  Harry took his glasses off and pinched the bridge of his nose.  I wanted to step forward to comfort him but my feet were rooted in place.  “The guy, who turned out to be Wormtail, grabbed me and—”
"Happy pride," Harry murmured, pulling Draco close again.
"Happy pride."
They met eyes, paused for a moment, and burst out laughing.  Harry took off his glasses, throwing them on the bedside table and running his hand through his hair.  Draco’s hair, usually styled with a bit of product but nothing like it was during school, hung loosely, framing his flushed face.  Harry leaned over Draco, placing his hands either side of his head and knee tucked between his thighs.  He planted a soft kiss on the mark Draco’s collarbone, his head swimming from the sight of Draco splayed out on his sheets and the mixing of his shampoo and cologne.  Draco pulled Harry by his hair into a tender kiss.  Harry shifted his knee against Draco’s cock, eliciting a breathy whine from Draco.  Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, pulling him down roughly and deepening the kiss.  Harry let out a low, guttural groan as Draco’s hands ran up his sides and onto his chest.  A few breathless moments later, Draco pushed Harry up, who quickly broke away, face dropping.
I got nothing left to say.
“Don’t be,”  Harry smirked before moving back, pulling Draco even further into his mouth and spreading his cheeks to better massage Draco’s tight rim.  Draco moaned loudly, making Harry bob and massage faster.  A few moments later, Draco placed his hand on Harry’s head and pulled him off.
”  Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her.  “It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”
“Great?”  I said.  It was nothing special, nothing to warrant such pride.
“How is anyone expected to be this precise!”  Pansy buried her head in arms on the table as I snickered.
When they got to Draco's room, Harry gently sat him on his bed and noticed — Draco was still completely dressed.  He cursed silently, realising he'd have to help the drunk man out of his clothes.
hey guys! so after this update, i'll be going on a brief hiatus from promises. i'm taking part in 4 fests coming up and some other side projects, as well as my work opening up in about a week. sorry to disappoint anyone but i will be back by august 4th with another update!
"You alright Potter?"  Draco asked quietly.  He could smell the alcohol on Harry's breath as he giggled.
"What the- shit!  Malfoy!  What are you doing?"  Harry sat up in bed, fumbling to put his glasses on in the dim light.
"Fuck yeah!  How you feeling on those keys, Cole?"  Jasper called out, driving the crowd wild.  He always was a crowd pleaser with his brilliant smile.  Cole laughed as he grabbed his bass.
"There was this one bloke." It's fine. I'm drunk, Draco tried to convince himself. "Total prat. Couldn't stand him." Draco leaned against the bar next to Harry, leaning in slightly.
“Send it.”  She whispered.  I glance around, waiting for a busy moment to drop the note next to Potter.  I stepped behind two Gryffindor boys and dropped the note as I walked past, grabbing a knife from the shelf and some leaves from the jar Snape had placed out.  As I walked back, I watched Potter notice the note, contemplate it, take it, open it, contemplate it again, pocket it and stand up to get materials.
“Is this—”
"Yeah, like I said, nightmare."  Harry sat on the bed.  Silence again.
I threw myself down on my bed as Pansy closed the door.  Blaise looked up from his desk and glared at us.
“You return to Hogwarts tomorrow Draco?” He hissed, causing me to nearly choke on the water I was sipping.
Five minutes later, I walked down to the Quidditch Pitch with Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle.  The air was light as everyone chatted freely, glad exams were over and thankful for the nice weather.  The sun was warm and most students had changed out of their school robes for more casual clothes.  I looked at Pansy.  She wore her white uniform shirt and—
“You two are a good pair.” I nodded and she stood. “Come, mustn’t be late for dinner.” She led me to the dining room that had also undergone a slight makeover — dark, cold and dreary like the rest of the house. Voldemort sat at the head of the table already. My mother curtsied when we walked in and I quickly bowed. I sat next to her on the left as my father walked in, bowing and sitting across from us. Near our feet, I felt the snake slither under the table. A house-elf appeared with the food and we began eating in silence. At 7:30 sharp, the food disappeared. Voldemort leaned back, closed his eyes and let out a sinister sigh.
“I might be able to steal you away for a few minutes afterwards.”  I gently took his hands from his tie and pulled him a bit closer again, our faces inches apart now.  ”If you don’t mind being caught by a Prefect after hours.”  A small smirk graced Harry’s lips and his signature mischievous glint returned to his eyes.
“Really Draco,” She grumbled.  “This is why I never sleepover.”
“The Death Eaters… one of them… I recognised their voice… Voldemort even called him by name…” He struggled.  I saw a flash of pity in his eyes.
“Yeah.  At five.”  He rolled his eyes but held his tongue.  I smiled.
“I know.  I’m sorry.”  He looked down again.
“I hope not.”
“Yeah, I guess it was.”
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr Potter.”  The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.  “Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”  Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward us.  “You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead —”
“Right.  You go up to that corridor, I’ll stay around here.  Have fun!”  She started walking in the direction Weasel and Hermione left in, before calling over her shoulder: “Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!”  I rolled my eyes.
So he tried to ignore it.  Every time Harry's gaze or touch would make him flush.  Every time his breath would caress his cheek or hand touch the small of his back as he'd try to move past in the kitchen.  He avoided Harry's gaze whenever he could, never noticing the similar flush on Harry's cheeks.
I quickly lost count of the days spent in my room before deciding to join my father in the drawing-room every morning. He’d receive The Prophet every day, commenting on the foolishness of the editors and the Ministry of Magic. I’d sit silently, attempting to focus on my book as he’d babble tensely. Harry’s birthday passed without recognition. A few mornings later, I entered the drawing-room to find him chuckling at a headline.
"Malfoy? What in Merlin's name are you doing here?" Harry laughed despite the pit in his stomach. Maybe Malfoy didn't notice or care about the song earlier. Maybe he forgot by now.
“Oh what, are you scared?”  He placed his hands on his hips, glaring.
"Harry,"  Draco said calmly, looking up at Harry, who's mouth dropped open.  "I'm alright.  Just a bit of a headache."  Draco leaned his head back and rubbed his temples as Harry stood, watching.
“How’s Prefect duty?” Blaise asked as we sat.
“Good job Draco,” She muttered, glaring at my father. He was staring into the fire, face tight.
This time Harry crashed into Draco, nearly knocking Draco back before he wrapped his free arm around Draco's waist, drawing them closer.  Draco tentatively placed his hands on Harry's waist as Harry deepened the kiss slightly.  Draco's breath wavered at the unexpected reciprocation before he mustered the courage to run his hands up Harry's chest.  This time when Harry pulled away, he kept Draco's face close.  Their breaths mingled as they slowly opened their eyes, meeting each other's gaze.
“Hey!”  He quickly walked up to me.  “I’ve been meaning—”
“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” Umbridge said coldly.
We went to our first class — History of Magic, which we all nearly slept through — and second — Herbology — without any sight of the Golden Trio or, more importantly, Harry.  Thankfully, he had returned to his seat at lunch.  Relief washed over me when I saw him and dissipated just as quickly when I noticed how sullen he looked.  I glanced up every few minutes to check on him, but his expression didn’t change.  About 20 minutes into the meal, his eyes met mine.  They flicked to the door quickly and his head tilted slightly.  I nodded.  I watched him walk out before excusing myself a minute later.  He was waiting at the end of the right-hand corridor, leaning against the corner.  I followed him as he slipped into the next corridor and then a broom cupboard.  I locked the door behind me.
“But now... you can,” Luna mused. “We all have a future now. Even you.” She scratched Jeff behind the ears. The Niffler let out a satisfied purr. He opened a sliver of eye and winked at Draco.
“Yes, it’s real, Draco,” Harry smiled, wiping eyes wet from laughter. “It happened nearly thirty years ago. Merlin, you really have been living under a metaphorical rock, haven’t you?”
He had time to catch a glimpse of Malfoy’s feral smile before he leaned in and kissed him. “You wish, Potter.”
“That someone remembered to cast a
Harry shook his head. “What?”
“I do, you idiot,” Malfoy snapped. “No need for chitchat.”
Except for the glasses.
Instead, he smoothed a short lock of hair behind his ear and readjusted his glasses. He glanced left and right, wondering who Potter was coming up to greet. But no one else was around, so Potter was stalking towards
Harry swallows. In the hush of the hospital room, it’s damningly loud. He could still back out of this… but Draco is staring at him, something frantic simmering in his eyes, and Harry wants to give in.
“Yes,” Harry moaned when he felt the tip of a third finger press into him, almost mindless with need. “Almost ready, Merlin I want you, I don’t think I can wait much longer—”
Next question.
“No. I want both of us to— to do that,” Harry says.
“Better?”
The itch in the back of Harry’s mind has a name, and its name is Malfoy.
series, he just...
-Harry
he frowned.
“Harry,” Draco whispered into Harry’s hair. He conjured lube on his fingers and smeared it between Harry’s arse cheeks and then his own cock. “This is unfair. Why does this feel even better than the first time?”
Harry wonders at the source of it all, as he watches Malfoy — Draco — take a more human shape in his mind as the days go by. What he sees leaves him strangely torn, in a way he’s never felt about suspects in a case: everything about Draco’s habits and demeanour speaks of honesty, and Harry’s at a loss to find loose ends to investigate. Despite the notes he makes for the case, there is nothing yet that lets Harry suspect dodgy activities. All Draco seems to do is work, and spend whatever free time he has with Scorpius. Harry doesn’t think there are enough hours left in the day for Draco to conduct additional business, whatever its nature. All of Draco’s trips, meetings and work hours seem devoted to Caduceus and nothing else.
“I know that. Believe me, I know. But the Ministry doesn’t. And I have to prove it to them.”
Penelope never imparts her wisdom lightly. So when she clears her throat, you can hear a pin drop in the DLF office. Everyone is on the edge of their seats.
Cheers,
Mephistopheles dropped his head in his hands and groaned.
Pansy saunters forward on impressively thin high heels, taking off the shawl around her shoulders. “Draco,
Harry rolls his eyes, frustrated.
The piece is a long one — Scorpius is maybe playing for a full five minutes — but Harry loses track of time. The music ends in a flourish of triplets, Scorpius hunched over the keyboard, tongue poking out in concentration, a sheen of sweat brimming along his hairline.
Harry’s hands flew to Malfoy’s hair as he arched up towards him, their bodies fitting together as if they’d done this a thousand times before. Malfoy’s groan reverberated in Harry’s mouth and then his tongue was there, licking against Harry’s, long fingers holding his face. The desperation in Malfoy’s kiss filled Harry with a want he’d forgotten he could feel. He’d kissed so many people in the past ten years—hundreds, really—but there had been something expected in each of those kisses. Harry had known how they would go before he’d even gone through them. But Draco Malfoy had never been someone Harry’d thought he would kiss until this very moment. And now that it was happening, it suddenly made perfect sense. This kiss… this kiss was the kind that had been ten years coming.
“It’s Christmas. You’re buying presents for the people you love. That’s what people do.”
“Hello Mummy,” I tell her. (She can't hear me.) (Of course, it's a photograph.) (Daddy says it doesn't matter. That I should say hello to her anyway. Only if I want to.) (That she’s proud of me.)
I probably deserved it.
“Are you sassing me, youngling?”
“Oh dear,” Malfoy breathes.
from their pots, colonizing the carpet, taking root in upturned bags of dark soil. Creepers climbed on walls, over the bow windows and around beams; grass grew under armchairs. There even was a bloody palm tree whose large yellow leaves hid a nest of hard-shelled fruit, dark and downy like coconuts.
“How fun.” Draco gives him a lopsided smirk. “Well, have a brilliant time discussing the best spot to observe the Acromantulas' mating season in Britain with other fellow loonies. And make sure you make good use of the valuable piece of information I just gave you,” he adds, nodding at the parchment square Harry still holds between his fingers. “Don’t make me wait too long.”
“He seems to like you,” he said, his eyes crinkled in a mischievous smile.
Harry was very close. Draco’s eyes fell to his lips.
“Let’s say we’re dying here,” Malfoy interrupted as if Harry hadn’t spoken at all. His grey eyes were glinting in the dark. Harry watched him as he spoke, the movement of his lips, of his throat. “Let’s say we’re dying here because we went chasing after a bunch of lunatics who thought it was the end of the world. As much as I hate to admit it, there’s some kind of humorous irony here, don’t you think?” He turned his face to Harry. His soft smile from a minute ago had turned into his usual smirk. “What would
He only now realises how much Harry has risked for him, how much he has given up. When Draco had seen him standing there, taking in the mess Smith and his Aurors had made… He had been convinced that one word, one lift of Harry’s eyebrow, would give what they were to each other away. Harry’d had that look on his face…. It was a look that Draco remembered seeing on Harry’s face many years ago — determined to do what he must to help his friends, to save the day — and for a second Draco’s mind had flashed back to his Hogwarts years... to how much he’d wished, back then, to be the centre of Harry’s undivided, bull-headed focus. And now that he was, Draco suddenly felt utterly unworthy of it.
“I’m only allowed to when Scorpius is out of hearing distance, which he is,” Draco tells him, and there must be something in his voice that makes Harry turn to him with a soft look in his eyes. Draco shifts his eyes away, clearing his throat. “My point is, I may have been a clever child, but I was also easily influenced, terribly close-minded, and a bully to boot. Sometimes… sometimes I think about the child I was. What I would have done to a child like Scorpius, if there’d been one like him at Hogwarts.  And now I’m never allowed to forget about it.”
Malfoy,” he breathed, feeling Malfoy’s finger circle his rim, then breach his hole with one knuckle. “Oh, fuck, you impossible prat, you just
With a whispered
He looks at Harry. It’s a grief-stricken stare that goes through Harry’s heart, raw and sharp like a knife.
Scorpius’ fingers run across the keys with a dexterity and smoothness that can only come from hours upon hours of ruthless practice and a well of innate talent. His little face is scrunched up in concentration, and he doesn’t notice Harry standing next to him, stunned into speechlessness. There’s sheet music resting on the stand, so crammed with notes Harry can barely decipher them.
you’re here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Scoff.
Leave it alone, Potter.
So he agrees to attend the dinner, more out of friendship for Hermione than concern for the cause that the dinner supports. It’s hard to be in fervent favour of programmes that support Acromantula birth rates when you’ve faced Aragog’s hundreds of carnivorous babies as a teenager.
Harry stays in the foyer with a quiet Scorpius. Balzac sprawls on the floor next to Scorpius and blinks at Harry, as if assessing what Harry's going to do next. In the midday sunlight, the room suddenly feels hushed, and Harry battles with a nonsensical urge to fill the silence. He searches his head for something to say, something to tell Scorpius. Other than Teddy, who is a few years older than Scorpius, and Ron and Hermione’s daughter who’s only a couple of years younger but strikes him as radically different, he can’t say he’s around children a lot. What do kids like these days? What does a kid like Scorpius like? He thinks back to Scorpius’s room, the treble-shaped lamp and the big book by his bedside table. Making him talk about the things he’s interested in seems like a reasonable way to start a conversation with a socially awkward seven-year-old.
“Well,” Hermione says. She leans back into her chair, glass of red in hand.
“We’re wizards, though. You can use a quick fitting charm on my clothes, and it’ll be like brand new running gear.”
“I have no feelings, good or bad, about working for you,” Harry says, and he knows he sounds convincing by the way Malfoy’s eyes stay fixed on his, guarded but sincere. “As I said, this is what I do. Personal security.”
“Fine. Anytime I ask nicely.”
“Yes, you tell me this at every check-in, Mephisto. I’m almost used to it by now.”
He saw Ginny glance at him questioningly a few feet away. He was shushing a talking Niffler, it was only natural—
I just… wanted to live.”
The metallic bump Harry had felt was a handle attached to a trapdoor.
Ron and Hermione exchange a look.
“Merlin, Draco, you need to get more serious about your health!” she’d chided, staring pointedly at the dark circles under Draco’s eyes. “And you too, Harry,” she’d added, possibly because Harry’s state wasn’t much better. “I know you two are—” she made a vague gesture between Harry and Draco, lifting her eyebrows “—
“I used to think you were the luckiest bastard on earth, you know?” Draco tells Harry when he thinks he can speak with a steady voice again. “Being Harry Potter sounded so fucking brilliant. I was almost resentful that you didn’t take more advantage of it.”
“Maybe another time. I have to review my notes and put everything together.”
“Of course, Auror Potter.” Penelope lets him go, while her team smiles like benevolent sharks. “Finish your business, please.”
Now he was starting to fall in love all over again.
To think he’d thought the evening was going to be boring from start to end.
“Quite by mistake, and it won’t happen again.” Malfoy frowns as if annoyed by the emotion he gave away. “I was saying, most of my ‘victims’,” he mimes air quotes with a roll of his eyes, “are wealthy arseholes. In the case of Cavendish, an arsehole who knowingly deals with ex-Death Eaters. Most of them have escaped overseas before the Aurors could catch them after Voldemort’s fall, but some of them are still in Britain, safely under the radar — where they were clever enough to stay even at Voldemort’s high point, unlike my power-hungry, cowardly father.”
still hanging over them, Malfoy touched his fingers to Harry’s naked chest, his brow furrowed. There was an odd expression on his face—as if the sight of Harry naked had rendered him speechless, making everything more… real.
Dear Draco,
“Yes. This is going to be a written interview. While I’ll do my best to stick as closely as possible to your words, there can still be room for interpretation. I can still misunderstand things that you’re going to tell me. Or I can write them in a way that you feel doesn’t reflect your original meaning. By signing this, you basically consent, as part of the journalistic process, to having your words written down or interpreted in a way that you might find inaccurate.” Merlin, that part of the disclaimer always made him sound like a bloody solicitor. He rubbed the side of his jaw, embarrassed. “The author of the articles, or the newspaper company itself, cannot be held liable if you disagree with parts of the article when it comes out. Should you find yourself unhappy with the outcome of the interview, you can of course contact the newspaper about it. An erratum can be added to the next issue.”
Draco watches Harry smile from the corner of his eye. The winter light catches in his dark curls and on the round lenses of his spectacles. He looks soft and at ease. Something squeezes in Draco’s chest, painful. He wishes he could trust Harry fully, the way his idiotic heart seems to be yearning for, the way he knows full well he can’t let happen.
He remembers what landed him in St Mungo’s in the first place. Not that the thought really left his mind.
Draco felt the blood leave his face.
The thought rankles. It’s irrational, but it does.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded a bit frantically and pulled him down for a kiss. Malfoy kissed him fervently, his tongue soft and insistent on Harry’s. Pulling out slightly, he slammed his cock back inside Harry again. And again, and again. Kissing and moaning into each other’s mouths, they writhed together on Harry’s Auror cloak, spread under their bodies already slick with sweat. They both found a rhythm, Malfoy fucking Harry’s arse in long, deep thrusts, Harry lifting his legs over Malfoy’s shoulders, one hand wrapped around his own aching cock, wanking himself along with Malfoy’s pounding.
“Thank you, Luna,” Hermione said. She gave Ginny a stern look. “Eighth Year classes end before lunch on Friday, Ginny. It’s not
He leaned forward, breathed in Harry’s scent, kissed his nape.
Malfoy stared at him for a second, the weak light of their
“Ah, yes, of course. And that’s easy, because there are so many people out there willing to do just that.”
“I’m not… fucked up. I’d just… rather not go public.”
“Wait here, please, Mistor Potter. Ernestina is letting Mistor Draco know Mistor Potter is arrived, sir.” And with a crack, she Disapparates.
He whispered, as if they’d been exchanging secrets.
“I’ll see you tomorrow?” he’d murmured, nipping at Draco’s neck. Draco had pushed into the touch, biting back a whimper.
I never said I wouldn’t do it.
“It's okay.”
“I want you,” Harry says between two shallow kisses, “and I’m sorry. I’m sorry if you ever thought—”
I could have lived a happy, carefree life without the knowledge that my best mate had a thing for blond gits in goggles and white lab robes, but you
“Malfoy was giving me a tour of the house.”
“God, yes.” Harry’s mind stumbles on the words. “Are you sure?”
Then Harry picked his quill again.
“Hullo, Draco,” Luna smiled slowly. “I knew this day would come. We never got to properly say goodbye when I left the Manor, did we? You were good to me, during that time. To Mr Ollivander, too.”
“What a wuss,” Harry nosed at his ear. “Fine. What is your plan, then? It’s morning outside. The storm has passed.”
“That’s where you got the three million Galleons you invested in Caduceus.”
He wants to push him, yell at him — and he also wants to throw himself at Harry and kiss him. Kiss his face, his lips, until Harry’s hidden motives melt in the background. Instead, he gives in to the childish urge to shove him, and they end up teasing, laughing together — hands on each other — like they never did when they were teenagers.
With a growl that sounded barely human, Draco closed the gap between them and kissed him again, furious and possessive. He pressed his body flush against Harry’s, trapping him against the island. Harry let out a sigh that sounded entirely too delighted.
“Thanks to you, Potter,” Draco said, unable to stop the bitterness from seeping into his tone. “Because you’re the most fantastic captain that team’s ever got. See what I meant by people coming to these reunions to brag? I just told you about my failed marriage, and you go on and on about how amazing your life is.”
Perfecting his pocket-picking technique, apparently.
“Call me Harry,” he tells her weakly, shaking her hand. He’s rendered momentarily tongue-tied by her blatant confidence.
And more than anything… He’s not sure if he’s ready to tell that, until a few weeks ago, he felt like he might actually start to like Draco Malfoy, even though they’d barely had more than a few half-conversations interspersed with, admittedly, amazing sex.
“I’ll take care of the order. I can make the Muggle payment—my parents opened an account at Lloyds for me when I was sixteen.” She folded the paper and placed it in an envelope, her stern gaze traveling from Harry to Draco. “I’d like you to pay me back as soon as possible. Wizarding money is fine. Not that I worry that you won’t, but... it’s for the principle.”
“I wouldn’t ask you to, but…” Harry feels his voice turn pleading, “...but maybe we could have talked about it. Maybe there’s a middle ground. You didn’t need to leave like that.”
“Your terms.” Harry scoffs. “What about mine?”
Pad out of my bedroom. Balzac follows me. I wave my hand, let my magic out, tell the motion-sensing charms not to chime.

Passing their table, other Eighth Years shot inquisitive glances at them. It was common knowledge that Harry and Draco had left their old enmity behind when the school year had started, but it was another thing to see them sitting together in class. In the distance, Slughorn announced the lesson plan of the day.
Slowly, Harry manages to lift his head and gaze at Draco.
would rather know, in his place. But that’s
Spurred on by Draco's encouragement, Harry takes Draco's wrists in one hand, and pins them above their heads, against the door. It's a good thing he's strong and holding Draco’s wrists so tight, because Draco’s vision tunnels, and all of a sudden his legs can barely carry him.
To be honest, Draco had asked himself the same question and had come up short. He could see another reason why the Headmistress would assign them to this specific task together. Him and Harry. The Death Eater and the Boy Who Lived.
Oh, I’m
“Fuck, Draco, your mouth—I can’t believe I’m in your mouth—”
“And…?”
“No, Harry. You’re not laughable. You’re not ridiculous. I can’t say I understand, but then again… you look very much infatuated. And believe it or not, I trust you not to fall in love with a complete arse.”
“You could have just asked.”
“No— I—”
“Yeah,” he admitted, defeated. “It’s stupid, though. Not just a little stupid. Embarrassingly stupid.”
Hey love,
They were people he’d get to live with and love for the rest of the one life he had left. They were people he wouldn’t abandon to go live another demonic cycle when things got tough.
“And while I was happy to help you experiment, I’m not ready to
“I would have, wouldn’t I?” Draco starts laughing too, taken by the outrageous idea and by Harry’s dazzling grin. “I would have been so utterly insufferable, I bet the wizarding world would have collectively agreed to murder me in my sleep.”
Draco,
He hadn’t gone back to the Tower again.
Standing in the doorway, one hand on the doorknob, the other in his pocket, looking severe and tall and lean in a dark grey Muggle suit and white shirt, is Draco Malfoy.
didn't come to dinner last night. Do you know who else didn't come down for dinner?” She paused dramatically. “Potter, that's who. And I heard Weasley mention to Granger that he went to bed
Constantly having to fight waves of terrible memories must do that, he thinks, as he powers through the rush of unease. He grabs the golden handrail and keeps climbing the stairs.
“We are,” Luna grinned. “We were just making tea.”
At the end of classes, they met again in a quiet corner of the Library.
“How…?” he says. “How much does he know?”
Draco join us for the next pub night?
He swallows and lowers his wand.
sorry.” She looks more apologetic than Harry’s ever seen her — and that includes her apologising for trying to give him over Voldemort. “I feel like I ruined it.”
I doubt I’ve ever admitted to that.
It had been the most peculiar night.
He doesn’t know how he’ll do that yet, but he’s determined to figure it out.
“I usually come down at this time and I never see you here,” Harry muses.
“So are you. Yet here we are, two professional adults meeting for an interview.”
It made it easier to understand how Voldemort had come to power when so many people, like Draco, only knew about their own little world and their immediate interests.
For Draco Malfoy was a demon, and this was his hundredth life.
Malfoy goes still then, Harry’s cock deep in his mouth, his breath strained and skirting Harry’s skin. He gives Harry’s hand a careful squeeze, and Harry sees all his want mirrored in the small gesture — the need for connection, the proof that Malfoy is as human as he is. And then Malfoy sucks him deeper on an exhale, and all of Harry’s thoughts fade to blissful white.
“Not at first, but I did my research.”
To Hades with it. No use in standing around. He’d fulfilled his end of the bargain. He’d only got polite nods from a few ex-Slytherins who’d stayed at an insulting distance from him. Nobody’d come to strike up a chat. Pansy and Blaise were dancing the tango in the middle of the Great Hall now, for Merlin’s sake. Draco clearly wasn’t needed. He set his glass on the corner of the buffet and shrugged his jacket on, not trying to hide his petulance. He didn’t care. He was getting out of here.
Harry huffs a wry laugh. “Live for yourself. Is that what you do?”
I don’t know what it means (the dictionary wasn’t clear on that). The bullies leave me alone now, though. And the scary people will never come back.) The records are categorised by colour now. The back wall like a rainbow.
She laughed. “Maybe. An unrepentant Draco Malfoy would never have lowered himself to including Muggle parametres in his calculations, would he?”

“There’s something else.”
Happy Sunday!!
“You decide, Draco. If you think I should go… I’ll go. I’ll listen. But… I want to stay and help.”
I’m sorry we left you out of the betting game, babes. You see, you weren’t at the pub the night it was launched (your dear lab mate, Zacharias Smith, was, though. Perhaps you should blame him, he who hasn’t even the common decency to let his colleagues know he’s leaving for the pub).
Don’t go finding excuses for yourself, Lavender. Chop chop, now. I want to see you Bend and Snap!”
After, the others had scattered: Granger had said she needed to stop by the post office to see if they could deliver the Muggle order form she had filled the previous day. The other boys had made a go for the Three Broomsticks. Harry had asked Draco if he would help him shop for Christmas presents. Draco had said yes. Not because he was truly excited by the prospective of going from shop to shop, but because he was a hopeless fool. Any excuse to spend time alone with Harry was valid.
“Maybe Mistor Potter will be part of the family.”
much easier to just follow us nicely? Or did you really have to make us corner you like a hunted animal? What are the Aurors going to think now they’ve seen you fight?” Smith stops pacing, turns to Draco. Something on Smith's face makes Draco grimace. “That looked suspicious as hell, if you want my professional opinion.”
“You haven’t given me my Snitch back.”
“It’s not… the same as liking someone.”
“Yes,” Potter says, teeth clenched.
Scorpius just nods quietly, and Harry is seized with a sudden inspiration.
I know I did.)
“It's fine,” Harry nods. “I wasn’t expecting anyone after Ernestina let me in. She said you were busy.”
Draco had frozen in his embrace.
And that, in his opinion, was worth honesty.
“Don’t. Care,” Harry gritted, but he still waved his wand and cast a wordless
Malfoy.”
“Yeah, Hermione told me about that thing,” Harry muttered. “Doesn’t mean I trust it.”
And Harry isn’t yet sure what to call that squirmy, confused, and not entirely awful feeling.
Is this thing on?
When Harry pulls back, he’s got that look on his face, a look that says,
“You gotta calm down, mate,” Ron mutters and rolls his eyes whenever he catches Harry in the act, but there’s a worried undertone to his words. Harry knows what bothers Ron: he thinks Harry will become all ‘
“I was hoping it would be the other way around,” Harry said. “Either way, you’ll have to get rid of these boxers,” he added, eyes fixed on the impressive tenting of Malfoy’s pants.
“Merlin, Harry, should we start looking for a replacement for Malfoy? You’ve caught the Snitch at nearly every game, it’s almost not fun anymore,” Dean Thomas was saying.
— him to finally fuck him. Harry had grabbed his leg and lifted it over his shoulder and pushed in, slow, slow and deep. He’d fucked him and kissed him and held him until he’d come, until Harry had come with him. It was only after his orgasm had ebbed away that he’d realised he’d murmured whispered endearments into Draco’s neck the whole time, and Draco had answered every one of them.
Draco looked at him sternly.
“So?”
“This,” Draco replies. He rubs his eye with the heel of his hand.
kind, if you know what I mean.”
“Don’t let us keep you,” Pansy drawled. “Unless you want to help us finish him?” She looked the snowman up and down, hands on her hips. “He is bloody fit, isn’t he?”
“Yes.”
“Bye, Draco! Bye, Harry!” Luna ran after Neville, who was already in the foyer, fastening his cloak. “Do wait for us, if you don’t mind! We can have supper together when we get back!”
friends are here!”
“Oh, God yes.” Draco rolls his eyes. “Are you kidding? I would have made sure I never had to lift a fucking finger in my life.”
God, it feels so incredible to be kissing him again. His soft lips move under Harry’s, opening up to let Harry in. Their tongues meet, a sensual, languid touch that fills Harry’s lungs with need and inexpressible joy. He exhales in relief, and feels Draco’s lips tilt up in a small smile as they deepen their kiss.
Malfoy looks confident, healthy, and rested. Not at all how Harry pictured him. He expected Malfoy to look more like… the founder of a business empire. A widower. The single father of a seven-year-old child.
Later, Scorpius comes back to say goodnight. He’s in his dinosaur pyjamas, Ernestina waiting for him with a cup of cocoa in her hand. The only person Scorpius kisses goodnight in the room is his father. Pansy smiles toothily and Hermione’s mouth softens in a silent ‘aww’.
“Fuck,” he heard Malfoy whisper when they broke for air. He was immediately back at it, kissing Harry with a desperation unlike Harry had ever experienced with any other lover, hands everywhere, in his hair, on his neck, his arms, his back, pushing his hips into Harry’s, rutting into him. Harry broke the kiss with a cry and Malfoy latched on his neck instead, sucking and lapping at his pulse point. His hand slid down Harry’s side, searching under his Auror robes for the button of his trousers. “Fuck,” he said again, “fuck, Potter, I want you, I want you so damn much—”
He can’t let this go.
“Because—” Draco’s hands clench into fists. His eyes turn stormy. “It will only make it so much more difficult. Hearing it won’t change a thing. Not when we can't be open about who we are.”
Hands on his hips, Draco hung his head. “Okay. So it’s not that you don’t think I’m worthy of interviewing you?”
Andromeda’s flat was small but warm and cosy. A few years back, Draco would have sneered in disdain. But the place reminded him of the Eighth Year common room—all thick rugs and mismatched furniture and crackling fire in the hearth—and he couldn’t bring himself to feel the slightest hint of condescendence.
“I could tell you exactly what you look like,” Harry whispers into the shell of his ear, the touch of his breath shooting down Draco’s spine. “I bet you’d love that, wouldn’t you?”
“Scorpius is… better,” Ernestina admits, glancing at Harry over her shoulder. Then, as if she’s sensing Harry’s wish to know more: “The Mind Healer was here yesterday, and Dr Dawson, too. Scorpius is recovering faster than the Healers thinks.”
“Will you make me a cup of tea?” Hermione asks him when she’s inside.
But now is not the time for this kind of reminiscence. Now is the time to focus on the present, or more accurately, on the future.
“I don’t know. She’s mental. Perhaps it’s a requirement for Hogwarts Headmasters.”
“And your dog,” Harry replies.
They part, but they don’t pull back very far. Harry rests his forehead, his nose against Draco’s.
“Since last May. I think I know why. Don’t you?”
Abashed, they exchanged a look. Draco had to admit neither of them had thought of this. He wasn’t joking when he said he was grateful for Granger’s help, or they would still be in the Library next June, trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
Harry hadn’t—he hadn’t
“All right,” he said, more gently this time, “what’s new with you?”
“It’s not,” Harry tells him, heart jumping in his chest. Jesus, he did not expect to have that kind of talk with a child when he woke up today. He did not expect —
Draco does. Then he and Harry set to work, taking boxes from the shelves, opening them with mild Diffindos, peering inside to check at the contents. It’s diligent, methodical work, and the cupboard is quiet save for the occasional words they exchange, voices low, the rummaging of hands in boxes of parchment clips and inkwells, and their muffled giggles when one thinks he’s found the box and brandishes it under the other’s nose only to realise it wasn’t the right one to begin with. At first, Harry doesn’t notice how slowly he works. He remembers helping George Weasley to store boxes in the back of his jokes shop, a few months after the war — the way they moved through the storage room, crossing each other’s paths and laughing, the bracing, fast and steady physical work lifting their spirits — and this feels nothing like it. Harry’s never been as aware of his own movements as he is now — slow and deliberate, calibrating each motion so that it looks natural, casual, like he couldn’t be less bothered by Draco standing feet away from him in the soft light of a Lumos. He’s aware of every inch of space Draco’s body takes up. He’s aware of the shape of it, lean and solid and real. He’s aware that he should probably put more space between them. He can hear a weird sort of thrumming in the back of his skull. The air of the cupboard is saturated with tense silence, and Harry can’t tell if he’s imagining it, or if Draco can feel it, too.
Harry let out a strained laugh.
The bell rings again, more insistent, and Harry groans a mumbled, “Comin’!” He can guess who it is just by the stubborn press of the button. He stumbles down the stairs, barefoot, trying not to lose his balance, dressed in joggers and an old Aladdin Sane t-shirt with a rip along the left seam. He hasn’t shaved since his last morning at Draco’s house. Hermione is going to take one look at him and decide that he needs an intervention.
Balzac the dog sits and lets out a soft, disgruntled
He forgot how it felt to want someone that way. He doesn’t know what to do with it — how to ask for it.
He had an idea. It was a bargain with the devil—well, his
At the Eighth Year table, Granger laid an order form between their plates.
did you do, more like,” Parvati grumbles, almost inaudible, face inside her coffee mug.
“That’s not— not at all—” Potter stammers, then exhales sharply, frowning. “You keep doing this… thing. The bending over. When… I’m around.”
Harry gave a theatrical shudder. “Merlin help us.” He took a book from the pile on Draco's lap. “Here. Let me help. I can read this one and you read the others. We'll go faster that way.”
Harry said he’d stay and help, and Draco wants to wait and see if Harry’s going to prove it — prove his trustworthiness, prove that he is actually on Draco’s side. Perhaps it’s even less rational… Draco wants to know if he can trust Harry again. Because he realises, in spite of their history, in spite of years of angry jabs and bullying and antagonism… Harry has always been there. He’s the best person Draco has ever known. Harry Potter, despite everything, has always been one of the good people. To picture him living this duplicitous life for a job… it makes no sense. It drives Draco mad.
“Every non-heterosexual boy had a fantasy set in these showers, Potter. More than one, as far as I’m concerned.”
“Old metal and—” Jeff’s paws flew to hold his face. “Draco, have you no shame?” At that, Draco threw the ring in the air and caught it like he would a ball. It seemed to work to stress his point, as Jeff positively looked like he was about to have a stroke. “You haven’t,” he said, appalled, “you truly haven’t.”
“I’m happy for you too, mate. I don't get it, of course, because you're still...
“I was enjoying the smell of the flowers!” Ron protests when Harry glares.
“Fuck
Draco rubbed his jaw, unfolding his parchment.
Draco turns to her and announces grandly: “A trick. It’s called the ‘Bend and Snap’.”
He needs—
When Scorpius sleeps, Draco goes on runs, hoping to outrun the nauseated dread. He runs for miles, alone, sweat prickling between his shoulder blades. He runs until his breath becomes a stabbing pain in his lungs; he runs until his thighs and calves burn and he has to walk home on shaking legs. He runs, Harry’s words hammering in his brain.
“You could have asked Jemima,” Harry ventures with a half-smile.
As you are well aware, your dear friend Potter asked me for a favour yesterday. Said favour contributed to your team winning the most recent installment of your ridiculously childish ‘betting war’ (ugh).
“He will be,” Draco had told her.
Not looking at either Ron or Kingsley, he carefully turns the page. The next few ones are newspaper clippings—from
Draco carried on alone.
“Seriously, what happened with him, mate?” Ron prods.
Harry looks at the frame above the fireplace, an enlarged wizarding photograph of the Granger-Weasley family, all bright smiles and happy waves, to avoid meeting anyone’s eyes. “I think I like him.”
Harry joined them, putting his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “He’s not wild, though. Look, he’s wearing a collar.”
And then the door bursts open, and Draco is propelled forward.
Patrick!” cackles a witch, sounding hardly more sober than her friend Patrick.
That earns him an eye roll. “You need to know the name of the thing you want to Accio for the spell to work.”
Harry’s mouth crushes his before he can finish, and he’s being pushed back against the glass desktop, the side of it digging into his arse. Hazily, Draco ponders how taunting Harry never fails to work, as Harry works Draco’s trousers open with rough fingers and unzips his own jeans, a wild, desperate look on his face.
“I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t realise we were supposed to stop meeting at all.”
More silence, and Hermione’s hand comes to pat Harry on the knee. “Harry… Between this and what you told us before… Does it affect your ability to carry out your mission? Because if it does, you should probably let Kingsl—”
“Therapist?”
“Calm down Draco, for Circe’s sake, you’re frightening her.”
Malfoy is always the first thing his eyes are drawn to, no matter where he is. It’s hard to focus when he’s at work, sometimes. He’s poured boiling water on the bench right next to his mug more than once.
“But he’s calling me Scorpius, Daddy. Why can’t I call him by his given name?”
Then time seems to stop.
“I’m your
Harry took a breath. “That night we spent together...the next morning, I was there. When Pansy asked you about me...I heard what you told her.”
Night has come. The sky outside the tall windows has turned purple and dark blue. The lights of London are glimmering on the horizon, bright enough so that Draco doesn’t feel the need to switch on the lights. His desk is covered in stacks of papers and parchment rolls, quills tidily placed in their cases. On the desktop, Draco left a clear square of glass. There’s a sheet of parchment lying in the middle of it. Not letting go of Harry’s hand, he walks with him to the desk.
Malfoy leans all his body on Harry, and Harry moans at the feel of that strong, heavy weight on top of him, so unlike anything he’s experienced before — exactly what he didn’t know he needed. Malfoy gets his hands in Harry’s hair, thumbs on his cheeks, and kisses him, kisses him, kisses him, slow and deep and filthy, and Harry doesn’t even realise he’s started to rut against him, helpless little thrusts of the hips, until Malfoy puts a hand on his waist.
Draco is watching him, guarded but expectant, waiting for Harry to speak again. So Harry smiles at him, a wry, encouraging little thing.
“Okay,” he said. “What are we going to do about it?”
Draco pushes a breath out, and then his hands are in Potter’s hair, pulling his face closer, and he’s kissing him. He’s kissing Harry Fucking Potter. That is an experience in itself. Harry’s hands are on the small of Draco’s back, bringing their hips closer, pulling his body flush against his, and at the same time he’s crowding Draco against the door — Draco’s head hits the wood with a dull thud that he registers in the back of his mind, a mild inconvenience in a sea of wonder.
But at least he intends to do something with all the money his parents and Sirius left him. He used to have that image in his head, of him sitting atop a pile of Galleons like the gold-hoarding dragon in
Maybe even better than that.
-Draco
Still, Harry is hardly objective. I think it’s the whole goggle-wearing, crisp white lab robes-sporting, cartoon mad scientist look that Malfoy has going on for himself these days.
Harry's eyes scan the documents strewn across Draco’s desk, hoping something will pop up, catch his attention in a meaningful way. Most of them are papers and parchments embossed with the Caduceus logo, tables covered with numbers and pound signs, legal documents regarding the opening of a Caduceus factory in Romania Harry’s vaguely heard Draco mention during firecalls with his legal team. As he walks towards the filing cabinets behind Draco’s desk, his sleeve catches on a pile of parchment rolls that fall to the floor. One of them unrolls, and he almost steps on it. Harry notices it: the grain of paper is different from the one Caduceus uses; it’s written in a foreign language; and the logo, a calligraphed slew of French, is decidedly not the wand and serpent he’s become so familiar with in the past month. He picks it up and reads.
It was the most adorable thing!!!!!
There was a smile in his voice. Draco didn’t need—didn’t
“Gentlemen,” Kingsley sits at his desk. He folds one large hand on top of the other. “Thank you for meeting me at such short notice, but as Ron already knows, this required some urgency. A case just opened that the Ministry has hoped to take on for a few years.”
“Fine,” Malfoy throws his hands up in mock-defeat. “Perfect. So we’ve established the use of given names then.
The trapdoor lifted with an eerie creek. When they leaned over to look inside, all they could see was darkness so thick it was almost dizzying. Harry pulled his wand and aimed at it.
Harry leaned closer, showing his teeth as he grinned. “Can’t you be serious for longer than half a minute?”
As he did, the Prothimioscope braked on the countertop and hit the wooden surface with a soft
Harry’s not prepared for how adorable he finds the sight of a disheveled, wary, and oddly vulnerable Draco Malfoy eating curry in his kitchen.
“Now I’ll have to make my peace with never having Harry Potter on my journalistic wall of fame.”
“Why— do you have to be like this?” Potter says through gritted teeth. His voice is low, private, like he wished to be addressing Draco alone. Anger — good old-fashioned, Potter-triggered anger — bursts in Draco’s chest.
He had recognised the husky voice of Harry Potter alongside the soft-spoken baritone of Neville Longbottom.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco says, hiding his stupefaction behind a smirk. “What a large…
Hermione and Ron both stop in their tracks. They slowly turn wide eyes towards Harry. Ron has his wine glass halfway to his mouth. Hermione’s lips are forming a perfect little ‘o’ of surprise.
And now… Well. It’s not like he
His head is swimming with the shock of Draco, his shirt off and on the floor of his bedroom, his nakedness equally defiant and vulnerable, all the marks from the war exposed for Harry to see. The scars…
They must have been in touch for weeks. Hermione had clearly jumped on the opportunity to contact Draco as soon as Harry’d told her she could. But she’s not just here to talk business. She’s here because, from all appearances… Draco has come to
“No one would have known you were there if you’d Obliviated him and Disapparated.”
He jumped. Harry was around the corner of the Entrance Hall. His face was pale, his glasses slightly fogged in the cold air. Behind them, his eyes were round and wide as though he didn’t expect Draco to show up. The wind coming from the open doorway to the outside ruffled Harry's hair and he ground his teeth, folding his arms around himself.
“How about we let you carry on with that
“Prat.”
“You forgot kleptomania?”
“Enter,” he says.
He sees her bushy head lean above the banister. She has that concerned expression on her face again.
him?”
Between Harry’s previous uncontrollable farting and me replacing the word ‘wand’ with ‘aubergine’ when Robards asked me about our latest investigation, our boss is starting to worry about our (physical and mental) health.
When Slughorn finally dismissed the class, Draco had no choice but to pull Harry into a dark corner nearby, press him against the wall and kiss him. Harry tasted of hot chocolate, candied orange and Christmas, and his eyelashes tickled Draco’s cheek when he smiled against his lips.
“Don’t tell me you don’t know,” he says quietly.
Harry reaches behind himself to shut the front  door, then nods at Ernestina.
“Oh,” Hermione says. She looks almost sad.
Yours,
I, for one, am
“That, and for bringing back all the wonderful, excruciating memories of being fifteen, pimply, socially awkward, and sexually frustrated, I suppose.”
In the silence that follows, Harry holds Malfoy’s cool gaze, the grey of his irises reflecting the gold and red glow of the fire. The grandfather clock ticks the passing seconds. Harry’s heart slows down. In the distance, a car drives past the house, the sound of the engine muffled by the hedges and windows.
“Harry has plenty of reasons to live—”
“You offered to protect me, all these months ago,” Draco says quietly. “This is me protecting you back.”
He wonders, hazily, if he’s being rude, if he’s being rough, if Malfoy wants to slow down… just when Malfoy’s hand slithers up his thigh and cups his balls.
Harry grinned when he saw Draco fly up to him, his black hair whipping in the cold wind. In his Quidditch gear, all leather shin guards and Gryffindor shirt and winter cloak billowing behind him, he was so unfairly attractive it made Draco ache. Merlin, how could he have let it happen? How could he have allowed himself to want Harry so much? Could he have picked a better specimen for his unrequited star-crossed crush?
They sit outside for a while, until Blaise slaps the ground as he lifts himself from the blanket.
And the piano keys explode in a blast of air, like a hundred bullets, all over the room, breaking shelves, shattering the glass of the windows, getting one of the Aurors — the one holding Ernestina — in the shoulder, blood splashing Harry and Scorpius’ faces and clothes.
Draco’s head snapped up.
Harry met his eye with a smile. “And I’d prefer you’d call me Harry.” Then, lower, “I think we’re past the use of surnames, Draco.”
Harry’s smile broadens with the blush creeping up Malfoy’s cheeks. “Did you just pay me a compliment, Malfoy?”
“Thanks, Ernestina. I’ll go see him now.”
Harry snorted. “Good name.”
“Moon
With a sigh, Harry wanders out of the ballroom.
“I’m happy for you, mate, I really am. But I really don’t want to know,” Ron had stopped Harry before he’d even opened his mouth.
“Has it?” Draco felt his stomach drop. “Since when?”
“It’s Draco,” Malfoy whispers against Harry’s lips, “call me Draco.”
“Maybe Honeydukes...” Harry mused. He scratched his head with a gloved hand. “I really don’t know what to get Molly. Or Arthur. Or George.” He fell quiet. “Merlin. This is going to be the worst Christmas.”
