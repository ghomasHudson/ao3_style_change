“It’ll get easier, Draco. They’ll get used to you. And you’ll get used to them again.” Embarrassed, Draco nodded jerkily, still staring resolutely at the water below. “Turn around, Draco,” said Harry. “Let me see you.”
adding something to the food, but mostly he chalked it up to his newfound happiness. After all, since Potter had entered his life – and his bed – every single day was just a little brighter.
Eventually, Harry rolled off, wiping sweat-sticky curls from his forehead, lifting his head up on one elbow and surveying Draco. It was undeniably intimate, but quite comfortable, Draco thought, eyes drawn to the dark tuft of hair revealed under Harry’s arm.
against its full effect for years, expending so much effort, and now, finally, he’d been allowed to drop his wand.
Their footsteps echoed loudly off the cobblestones as they walked along together in comfortable silence. The ice around them melted and shrank away from the strength of Harry’s warming charm, and Draco inhaled deeply, trying not to focus too hard on the easy way Harry wielded such power.
“Well, I’m just thinking, you know, he probably also has awful memories from before, right? Maybe he’s thinking about, I don’t know, a re-do. Closure, or whatever. Not so much reliving things, more – letting them happen the way they should have happened last year.”
pathetic. Shivering, Draco brought his knees up to his chest. To his shame, there was a lump building in his throat. He screwed up his eyes, trying to suppress the hot tears which threatened to spill over, and pulled a blanket around himself. It was just his anxiety, that was all. Saturdays were always hard. He always felt lonely on the weekends. What he really needed was a good, long sleep.
“It’s not.” The force and certainty behind his statement surprised even Draco. “I want more than that. I want… I guess I... I care about him too, you know. Not that it matters, anyway. He doesn’t want anything more,” said Draco, quickly. “I told you what happened at Neville’s.”
reluctantly plastered a relaxed smile across his face as he unclenched his fists. He hadn’t even noticed himself clenching them.
“You do realise we’re not still at Hogwarts, gentlemen?” Draco asked, mischievously. The twin glares directed at him made him regret his words immediately.
“I’m sure she is, and she hasn’t exactly got the most riveting subject, but you have to admit that she’s a rubbish teacher. Trust me Longbottom – Neville – if you enjoy your subject, stay off the booze and, well, don’t

– to be this close. Close enough to see Potter’s throat work as he swallowed, to track the way his shoulders rose and fell in that awful jumper, to watch his pupils begin to dilate. One more step, and then Draco could just reach out, and― no! For Salazar’s sake, he had to keep a hold on himself!
Dennis’ furious gaze remained fixed on Draco’s face as Neville rubbed his back, speaking in a soothing whisper. “I
. It was just short-term, after all, and he had already decided that he would only take enough to last during shop opening hours, and none at all on weekends. That would allow him to see his mother on Sundays, sober. Then after a while he could wean down the dose, maybe save it for special occasions. It should be straightforward. He just needed to be careful.
Neville took a big swig of his tea, looking down into the cup thoughtfully. “I don’t think it’s embarrassing. I think it’s good that you’re not sitting around the house feeling sorry for yourself.” He tugged on the sleeve of his jumper. “After the war, I found it difficult to think about the future, you know? I think most people I’ve spoken to who went through it felt the same. Like, are we just supposed to carry on as though nothing happened? As though loads of our friends didn’t die?”
Diagon itself, with all the attention that would grab, but close enough to the old Slug & Jiggers site that their regular customers wouldn’t have to make major changes to their routines. The shop was already well-warded thanks to some trouble the previous owner had had, and there was a small flat above it, which would allow Draco to move out of the Manor and really start afresh.
“I… I thought about you a lot, afterwards, over those two years. How you were doing, if I could – I don’t know –
“Five minutes!” called the old wizard in a hoarse voice. Harry groaned, repeating his usual series of stretches and rubbing ineffectually at his screaming calf muscles, barely even noticing the cries of the witches getting louder as he bent forwards. But when he finally stood up again, he
Draco turns towards him, then, one eyebrow raised curiously. “I was. Working in the States, that is. I finished my residency last month.”
Draco flicked his wand, circling it slowly around the outline of the bath. The tub began to quiver ominously, and Draco heard Harry’s intake of breath behind him. But he stayed focussed, watching, as his old bath creaked and moaned. Out of nowhere, a rough tearing sound echoed off the tiles as the entire tub pulled away from the wall, sides rippling for a moment more before it settled.
His words hang in the air, and Harry – only half-listening, once again – looks up, embarrassed. “Were you asking me a question, sorry?”
To his relief, her face immediately relaxed and smoothed over, and she walked right past him into the lab without another word. Draco glanced out at the shop floor, noticing with a jolt that she’d neatly tidied and reorganised all the spilt packets of herbs.
So he stayed, as the Cannons took a savage beating – apparently. Draco wouldn’t know – he didn’t see a single goal. His head was spinning, and the harder he tried to concentrate, the worse it seemed to get, so in the end he gave up completely on following the action. He was craving
he’s eating well. The other day I came back from work and he was sitting in the corner under the ficus, gobbling up soil straight out of the pot. Had a corner of the curtain tucked in like a napkin and everything. Just sat there cross-legged, shovelling dirt into his mouth, grinning away and smacking his lips as though he were halfway through the lobster at Le Cinq.”
Two weeks, then – he’d have to find a way to distract himself in the meantime. A trip to the Manor might do it. He’d promised Hermione that he would check the library anyway – she was struggling to source some old legal books on Squib rights. He worried about his mother too, all alone in the big empty house.
Harry nodded. “It was. I thought you might not recall much, since Lee wasn’t there. I only bring it up because, well...”
“Mother, please. I don’t blame you. Either of you. It’s finished now; it’s in the past. We’ve all made mistakes, but it’s not over, you know. There’s plenty of time to do better. I’m pleased for you… pleased that you’ve found someone who makes you happy. It’s not easy – Merlin, I know it’s not – to look past a lifetime of prejudice. If this man has helped you do that, then he must be… well, he must be really special. You don’t need it, but of course you have my blessing.”
Harry snorted. “What, Ryan? No idea. Back in Boston, I guess. Fucking Skeeter. It was practically nothing. I was
By the time Neville emerged from the Floo on his final visit to the Manor, Draco’s preparations for the end of his house arrest were well underway. He’d written out a full inventory, had received surprisingly positive responses from several suppliers and even found a small shop, which had a very reasonable rent, and put a deposit down. It looked perfect on paper; not
But Harry cut in before he could finish the thought. “Look, I know you’ve got a lot to think about, but I’m sure Hannah and Neville can fill you in on everything else. I actually came over tonight because there’s something important that I need to tell you.”
“Right,” said Harry slowly, watching the young woman’s back as she stomped off in a huff. “Bit young for you though, isn’t she? Can’t be more than, what, eighteen? I mean, personally, I draw the line at dating people who don’t even remember the war, but―”
It took a few seconds for the significance of this statement to penetrate the fog of confusion surrounding Draco’s brain. His eyes flew open just in time to watch Harry – face no longer terrifyingly blank but alive with anger and frustration – hurl the little vial of
The words died on his lips as Neville grinned at him, stepping into the shop with a sarcastic, “Ah, so I suppose we should leave then?”
As Professor Sprout patted Bryn proudly on the shoulder, an abrupt realisation dawned on Draco, and he beamed at the pair of them.
of dismay emanates from the little blinking alarm on the ceiling. There’s a second of almost-silence, disturbed only by the crackling of flames and Harry’s pounding heart, before it begins to emit an ear-splitting wail.
, Draco found, was particularly enjoyable. The ease with which he was able to indulge in all his fantasies, free of nagging guilt and shame, was a welcome change. Without a second thought, he reached down, took himself in hand and let his eyes flutter closed under the spray of the shower. He braced himself against the tile with the other hand, a soft moan drowned out by the running water, as images of Potter in his lab assaulted his senses, brought to him in perfect clarity courtesy of
Focussing on his impending good fortune and trying not to dwell on the alternatives, he raised it to his lips and took a tiny sip. To his surprise it tasted tart, rather like an underripe gooseberry, but not altogether unpleasant. For a few seconds, nothing happened. He stood perfectly still, anxious, the only sounds around him the drops of gold splashing gently across the surface of his potion. All at once, from the centre of his chest, a warmth began to spread through him. Faster and faster, it moved, until it was rushing outwards through his entire body – a tingling in the tips of his fingers, a prickling in his scalp. And with it came a tremendous, almost overwhelming sensation of confidence, of certainty, of

that for just a moment he froze, fearful of disturbing such a beautiful dream. But then Harry was there, morning stubble grazing Draco’s face as he knelt to kiss him shyly, and suddenly they were having
"Listen, Potter, if something happened while you were there, that’s – that’s fine. Alright? I mean, it’s not like we’re – it’s not like I…. It’s fine. I don’t care what you got up to, okay? It’s not as though you’ve brought someone back with you, or anything. Is it, Potter? Ha ha. I mean, I merely thought that as your… as an
“I just can’t understand what he’s thinking. Any big public event like that would be bad enough, but
Potter rolled his eyes, shooting two fingers up at him cheerfully. “You’re all right, Malfoy, thanks. Anyway, I’ve got to go now, but I’ll pop by again soon.”
, and gestured for Potter to follow him through to the lab, pulling out a chair. Draco stepped aside as Potter hobbled through after him. For one horrible second, he thought he saw Harry’s eyes flick over to the side bench where the
tried to hold Draco back, but he was too keen, and it was too fast, and Harry hissed as the fabric pulled roughly over the head of his cock, which sprang free, slapping against his stomach loudly. Draco winced, embarrassed by his own eagerness. By way of apology, he leaned in, without preamble, and guided the tip of Harry’s cock into his mouth, looking up at him through hooded eyes just in time to see Harry’s head drop back against the wall with a thud. Harry’s hand dropped down to cup the back of Draco’s head, his fingernails scraping up through the stubble of Draco’s hair, finally coming to rest on his shoulder.
banner rustled gently on the wall, and Draco spotted his tree – to his relief alive once more and covered in bright green leaves – over in the corner. The room was empty for many long minutes, and Draco was considering giving up when Neville finally appeared, groaning and muttering to himself as he came into view. He was paler than usual, barefoot and clad in just pyjama bottoms. His bloodshot eyes widened as he came closer.
,” Ron muttered, and then, noticing Harry’s glare: “Look, it’s just that Kingsley’s brought this trophy, see, and…” He kept up the chatter as he turned, and began staggering awkwardly back out of the woods. Harry had no choice but to follow, throwing one last, helpless glance behind him at Malfoy as he picked his way through the undergrowth.
“Ah, I thought you’d never ask, Potter.” Draco said, gesturing towards the front of the store. “We keep the Sleekeazy’s over there, a good dollop of that should sort you out nicely.”
He sighs, opens his mouth. His first attempt at reply is masked by a roll of thunder, which rumbles on and on, echoing around the grounds. As it fades, the storm dies down for a second. It waits, like you, for his answer. You're not surprised when you notice your hand resting just alongside his on the balustrade. Barely an inch to the right, and you’d be touching. You hold your breath.
He’d heard it so many times that it had to be true. Growing up, elderly witches would ruffle his mop of golden hair fondly, whispering to each other:
powerful – her body made of muscle, designed with one single purpose: to kill. His breathing was coming fast and shallow now, heart racing, as the pressure around his torso increased. Soon, he knew, she’d squeeze his final breath from him. He’d watched her do it before, countless times, after all. His ribs would shatter, his face would turn red, then purple, then finally blue. The blood vessels would burst behind his eyes.
“Well, I only know what Harry said, but it sounded pretty permanent. Harry says they seized almost all of the stock. Besides, once it becomes public, their reputation will be shot.”
After lunch, Neville was keen to see Draco’s mother to update her on the Moly plants they’d grown from her cuttings. They spent a pleasant, if tiring, afternoon together attempting to harvest leaping toadstools, Draco very grateful for the extra pair of hands. As they were walking back inside the house, Megaera came swooping down and dropped a letter at Neville’s feet. He read it and wordlessly passed it to Draco.
Neville also continued to frequent the shop, sometimes bringing his girlfriend, Hannah, along. The first time she’d walked in, Draco had suddenly recalled that they’d taken Charms together, and managed to come up with an anecdote about a time that Ernie Macmillan had accidentally hit her with a Shrinking Charm. His description of Flitwick trying to force Hannah into a jam jar so she could be taken to the infirmary had all three of them in stitches, and from then on, as with Ron, it felt as though they’d always been firm friends. Hannah was a trainee Healer, and she and Draco could quite easily spend an hour discussing the pros and cons of different potions with Neville grumbling good-naturedly all the while.
had opened up. Truly, it had worked better than he could ever have expected. Most of all, he was pleased with how well he’d managed to maintain a degree of control over his actions after taking it. He’d heard terrifying stories about wizards and witches who’d taken
“Oh, sure. Of course.” Harry flicks his wrist to turn the wireless back up, his fingers moving to resume combing through the fine white silk of Draco’s hair. “How’s it all going, anyway?”
. Merlin knows I’ve about had it up to here with this bizarre Yankee Doodle dickhead thing he’s got going on.”
Draco collected quill and parchment, and Neville busied himself with writing a note to Potter. Draco watched him, waiting, while
, carpet burns on his knees. Lazy kissing. Then – oh God – the bathroom door closing, mounting dread, those stupid bloody Quidditch boxers,
The next few hours were all agony as his crushed bones knit themselves gradually back together, nerves and arteries twining around them like needles under his skin. The occasional crackling and popping noises turned Draco’s stomach. All he could do was lie still on the bathroom floor, watching dust motes dance in the beam through his skylight, sipping Firewhisky and counting under his breath when the pain got too much to bear.
To anyone with even a passing knowledge of potions, Occamy eggs meant one thing and one thing only. Draco had no idea which of his legion of ancestors had stored them up there and when – and it could have been any of them; it seemed a very Malfoy thing to do, after all – but he knew for certain
“Anyway,” said Harry, expression stern once more, “That’s my answer. I’ve been honest with you – which is probably more than you deserve. It’s your turn now, and you’d better be convincing. You owe me that at the very least. By rights, I should have hauled your idiot arse straight in last night.”
, and they sat down for lunch like old friends. They discussed Neville’s work, and Draco’s flying, and then, out of the blue, Neville pointed out Draco’s mother kneeling down across the other side of the ornamental lawn, wearing – to Draco’s surprise – a jaunty straw hat and sky-blue jacket. She appeared to be pruning the bushes, and Neville insisted they say hello, so they wandered over after lunch.
“It’s just―” Malfoy shifted slightly, leaning forward and looking at the ground below as he spoke, “―well, I can’t help but notice that while I’m kicking arse as Head of our Field Division, and your mate Weasley’s in line for Head Auror – not to mention Little Miss Smarty-Pants in her lovely new Deputy Minister’s robes, you’re – well, Potter, you’re… not. You’re still sent out on the beat, sharing an office, doing all the grunt work, right?”
Me, the idiot who got it into his head that it was all right to sleep with you when I believed you were under the influence of Felix.”
Malfoy frowned at him, tilting his head as though Harry might be joking, and Harry’s voice fizzled out as the pieces slotted together in his mind. Robards’ far-too-casual manner. His teammates’ sullen expressions. The huge refreshments stand. The cushion that Dominguez was currently Spellotaping to his broom.
She patted him on the arm. “Of course. Go easy on him, though. He’s not had a great evening so far.”
go to St Mungo’s, right?” He took a step closer to Draco. It was all too much, thought Draco, slumping further against the doorframe. He was miserable, tired and drunk, and he needed this conversation to end, before he blurted out something he would regret.
“Oh, fuck off, Potter. Take all that sanctimonious shit and get lost, won’t you? This whiny little prick is Death Eater scum, and he deserves everything he gets.”
I have to bring you in. I don’t know what crazy world you inhabit, but let me tell you, propositioning me is not going to help you here.” Draco watched in horror, his outstretched arm dropping uselessly to his side, as Harry balled his hands into fists. “
“Look, humour me, okay? So, do you remember that time, back then? The time we sat here, on the edge of the bath together? And you… and I…” Harry was leaning against the doorframe, looking vaguely nauseous. “I felt so sick, and I couldn’t talk properly. We sat here, and you… you―”
It had been his first (and hitherto only) experience with a man, and the same for Theo. It hadn’t been romantic, and it
“I need to get cleaned up properly first, okay? I won’t be long.” He bent forward to give Draco a quick kiss on the forehead, before straightening and making for the en suite. Draco watched him idly, enjoying the view, waiting for the moment when he would change course, guided away by the

anymore. Even Draco had started dropping the odd hint about finding a job now, as if Harry didn’t have enough on his plate. No, the right career was waiting just around the corner; he’d know when he found it, and it wouldn’t be Quidditch, or the bloody Aurors, or politics, or teaching…
racing through his veins at the sight of him, even limping angrily towards the stepping stool. Draco quickly transfigured it into a sagging armchair, and Potter sank down gratefully, already mid-story.
They stared at each other for a second, that familiar curious look back behind Harry’s eyes, leaving Draco feeling unusually self-conscious. But before he could start to worry what it meant, before he could even blink, they were kissing again. Draco guided them slowly over to his bed, lying back and tugging Harry over on top of him.
Draco followed her gaze up to the high benches. There must have been over a hundred onlookers up there, most of them starting to take their seats in preparation. The majority were dressed in robes, but there were also plenty in Muggle suits, and more than one in a strange mix of the two. His eyes lit on a harried looking blonde witch in formal robes, hair scraped tightly back into a bun. She was standing beside a young girl, no more than eleven or twelve years old, wearing what Draco assumed to be a Muggle school uniform. The daughter was leaning as far as she could over the railing, ignoring her mother’s pleas to come away from the edge. As the girl surveyed the room, she caught Draco’s eye, and he smiled at her, raising his hand in greeting. She waved back, cheerfully. Her mother peered down at Draco suspiciously – he watched as recognition dawned, her expression rapidly transforming into a glare.
“Of all the ridiculous―” He closed his eyes for a second, trying to collect his thoughts. “Harry, I’ve always wanted you, one way or the other. For as long as I can remember.”
Draco nodded. The story of that fourth-year Defence lesson had spread around Hogwarts like wildfire. And even if it hadn’t, Draco had heard enough nervous whispering between the Death Eaters who’d been present on the night of the Dark Lord’s return to know there was at least some truth to the rumour.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, stroked Harry’s hair gently off his forehead, that famous scar rough under the pads of his fingers. “Harry?” he whispered, and again, “Harry?” Eventually, Harry began to stir, arm stretching out towards the bedside table – whether for glasses or wand, Draco wasn’t sure.
know was stubborn. Resourceful. When Potter got on the Quidditch team, you practiced every day for a year, remember? You worked for your father all summer until he bought you those broomsticks. You fixed that impossible bloody Vanishing Cabinet – sorry to bring it up, but you did! – and when you weren’t allowed back at Hogwarts, you got a bloody Potions Diploma. You own a business, for Merlin’s sake! Don’t tell me that you’re going to give up now and sit around swooning like some lovelorn Hufflepuff first year?”
Next, he ventured out to Diagon for the first time in years. He kept his hood up, watchful for any signs of trouble, but no one even batted an eyelid as he popped into Gringotts to set up a business account. On the way back, he stopped by Twilfitt and Tattings to purchase some new robes in the shorter, less traditional style that had become popular since the war, and finally, before he could talk himself out of it, he pulled open the little door to Weeoanwhisker’s, and emerged, half an hour later, his previously long, unkempt hair shorn into a severe Muggle-style crew cut. As he stared at the stranger in the mirror, his nails scraping up the back of his head to feel the unfamiliar shape of his skull, he felt as though all his sins had been washed away. Gone was the boy, so like his father. Gone were the riches, the status, the expectations. Here he stood: raw, hungry, desperate for a fresh start.
Harry took a deep, steadying in-breath before replying. “Malfoy. I am Deputy Head of the fucking Auror Office. You’ve got about
His eyes remained completely unfocussed. Pansy’s voice was distant but full of disdain. “Great. Am I to assume you didn’t read my owl at all, then?”
She looked up at him. She seemed so frail, her eyes bright and wretched. Draco frowned, unused to such candour. He’d been raised to see his parents’ words as law, their opinions sacrosanct. He’d never thought he’d hear his mother even intimate that her actions might have been misguided.
Harry hummed, softly. “Maybe.” He was half asleep, Draco could tell, and so he let himself fall too. They dozed on and off for a little bit, until the raised voices of the restaurant owners locking up finally roused them. Draco sat up, stretching.
They stand up, somehow, fall onto the bed, still tangled in a fierce embrace. Harry’s heart is sore; grief and love mixing together. Words form, now; words Harry never thought to say, and he whispers them against the stubble on Draco’s jaw, eyes squeezed tightly shut. Eventually, they break apart. Draco’s eyes are puffy, full of anguish, as Harry rests their foreheads together.
In the morning, Harry tucks the blankets around him carefully, pushing Draco’s curls aside to drop a gentle kiss on his forehead before he leaves. “I’ll be back soon. I promise.” Helpless, he watches him duck on his way out, the flimsy wooden door swinging shut behind him.
Neville snorted, loudly. “Did he really like you? Ha!” He looked over at Hannah. “Do you remember the first time we hung out with him after you and I started dating? You know, when we went to Grimmauld for takeaway and he―”
“We won’t. It doesn’t matter, anyway.” Harry’s face is resolute. He reaches for young Draco’s hand, clasps it tightly, and your younger self looks down with eyes so full of wonder that you’re forced to stop for a second, pained.
It had been two gruelling weeks of burning the candle at both ends, but Draco couldn’t deny that it was worth it as he stood in the centre of his apothecary, casting a critical eye over every nook and cranny. There were hundreds of neatly labelled jars stacked to the ceilings on dark wood shelves and stoppered vials were glowing and fizzing – and sometimes wriggling – behind his polished counter. He had sample dishes of dried ingredients out around the shop, and even a shiny set of non-magical silver scales – wholly unnecessary, but long a symbol of the profession. He inhaled deeply, smiling as the scents of cedarwood and menthol invaded his nostrils, evoking memories of apothecaries he’d visited as a boy. He might have spent the very last few Knuts of the Malfoy fortune, he might have worked his fingers to the bone, but for the first time Draco could remember, he’d created something he could be proud of.
He hung his head in horror. His terrible secret, his greatest shame – it was hard to even comprehend that he’d finally uttered it aloud. Draco heard the door close. He sighed, half sure that when he looked up, he’d find Harry gone, Draco’s admission too much to stomach.
To his own surprise, Draco laughed. “Trust me, Longbottom, I don’t think you’re weak. I watched you use a sword to decapitate a giant fuck-off snake. The same snake, I might add, that lived in my house for a year, and practically gave me a panic attack every time it slithered its way into the room.” He sighed, reaching for the teapot and pouring them both a cup of Earl Grey. “It’s more that my history with Potter is a bit – complicated. With you, it’s pretty simple – I was a shit, you didn’t deserve it, et cetera.” He sat back, regarding Longbottom over the gilt-edge lip of his teacup. Merlin, this Gryffindor honesty was a bit over-the-top, wasn’t it?
Harry complied, and Malfoy withdrew his wand from its holster once more. But this time, rather than prodding it into Harry’s bum, he pressed the tip of it to Harry’s upper back, running it lightly over the wing of his shoulderblade and up higher, drawing gentle circles over the joint itself. He dragged it back across the base of Harry’s neck, making him shiver, and repeated his efforts on the other side.
Draco’s eye was drawn to one photograph in particular. It was one of the smaller pictures, tucked away in the middle of page three, so Skeeter clearly hadn’t thought it notable, but Draco was immediately transfixed. The shot was taken from behind Harry’s date so you could only see the back of his head and his hand as he passed something across the table. As Harry accepted it, their hands brushed, and Harry blushed and smiled, before looking away. The photograph, taken as it was with Harry smiling almost directly at the camera, made Draco’s chest tighten. He watched it over and over, until he couldn’t help smiling himself. It was only when he caught himself about to brush his finger over the photograph that he paused. Why was he being so weird, so
“All right, listen,” said Harry, resuming his earlier exploration of the inside of Draco’s leg. “I really hope getting all that off your chest helped, but – uh, now, don’t take this the wrong way – but, well, are you certain all that was because of the
Back then, there’d been Howlers too, with every grieving relative seizing the opportunity to berate the only Death Eater outside of Azkaban. With
“I do,” Lee said. “Fuck knows why, but I do believe you. I know you’re not like that. Or – I think I know? It’s just – it was
“Oh, were you assuming I was taking a page from your playbook, Draco ‘mauled by a Hippogriff’ Malfoy?”
, Harry thinks, even with ample evidence to the contrary staring him in the face. Draco’s gained a little weight, his angular face gentling at the edges, and his hair’s longer than Harry’s ever seen it: down to his shoulder-blades, or thereabouts. There’s more than a hint of Lucius in him these days, but the soft crinkles at the edges of his eyes speak of easy laughter, of kindness. His whole demeanour is one of self-assurance: he’s no longer the nervy, war-damaged boy Harry had known, so desperate to prove himself, but someone else completely; a man who’s happy in his own skin, whole and free and at peace with the choices he’s made.
was stewing under its Disillusionment. In that second, Draco felt his stomach drop, tendrils of fear wrapping around his body, squeezing the breath out of him. Why would Potter―? Unless – had Draco messed up? Left something out?
“Wouldn’t be the first time, would it?” Draco replied. “Besides, I reckon there’s no harm in getting the word out.”
“You’ve done amazingly well, though,” Draco says, cutting kindly across Harry’s stuttered explanation. “Really, that broom is top class.”
He tries again. “Because, Potter, life goes on, even when we’d prefer it not to. Because I’m more than a footnote in some ridiculous schoolbook. Because I’m bloody good at what I do.” He pauses, looks over at you, eyes blazing; with what, you can’t quite tell. You shiver. “Because I believe some things do change. Or at least, I hope they do.”
“Just the once,” said Draco. “Didn’t go well.” He kept his answer deliberately offhand, desperate to avoid reliving that terrible night. The way he’d been forced to drag himself across the floor; the awful sounds that had come out of his mouth. Merlin, was it possible that that had only been three weeks ago?
“Look at you, cowering against the wall. Not so big and clever now you haven’t got your lackeys with you, are you, Malfoy?”
There was a flickering sensation against his side, light and deceptively ticklish. The hissing noise was back, right beside his ear. Carefully, gently, he rested his feet back down against the mattress. He willed himself not to move a muscle, not even to breathe, as he felt Nagini’s cold, smooth body slide up and onto his bare back, thick scaly skin coming to rest over his ribs. And the smell – oh God, the
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Lee’s head poke curiously out of the lab. He Apparated himself and Theo upstairs into his bedroom just as packets of herbs began raining down all around them, and dragged Theo over towards the bed. But as they stumbled across his bedroom, Draco started to feel uncomfortable. Sure, it felt
Of course, the thought that Harry might come and look for him outside the ballroom once more had crossed Draco’s mind – in fact, it had featured prominently in his recent fantasies. Even so, as he traversed the floor with his head bowed, his long, purposeful strides echoing sharply around him, doubt began to creep in. He was unquestionably the black sheep of the wizarding world. Over five years after the war’s end, upstanding members of society still turned their backs as he walked by. Would they ever forgive him for his past mistakes?
“So,” Neville began, as they walked across the lawn together. “I heard this from Harry last night, and it’s not common knowledge, so I’m trusting you to keep it quiet.”
He tried to put Harry out of his mind as he answered Lila’s questions, discussing illegal dragon breeding and manticore hunters as best he could manage, but the next time there was a lull in conversation, he couldn’t resist a quick glance across the room. He wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or disappointed to find Lee in deep discussion with a besotted-looking young wizard, with no sign of Harry anywhere. Just as Draco was about to look away, something caught his eye, and he peered closer. Flitting around Lee’s head, weaving in and out of her curls, Draco could just make out a tiny golden hummingbird.
all be worth it. If he survived the night, that was. Deep in thought, he watched Lee as she dipped her glass rod in and out of the liquid to check its consistency. A sudden idea struck him, and he cleared his throat.
A few, shaky, steadying breaths later, Harry knelt forward, his hand coming up to cup Draco’s jaw, and moved to cover Draco’s parted lips with his own. They were still for a long second while Draco continued to chase his own pleasure, arm moving frantically as he breathed sharp, fast breaths into Harry’s mouth.
Hermione pursed her lips, but before she could formulate an appropriately sarcastic response, Malfoy let out a great heaving groan and rolled onto his hands and knees. He was still staring off into space as he struggled to his feet, his lips a garish cherry-red arc, tongue visible through the gaping hole where his front teeth had once been. Most disconcerting of all, though, was the blissed-out, beatific expression writ across his broken face.
Before long, that pointy chin’s back, hooked over his shoulder once more. Harry turns into Draco, mumbles against the soft skin of his cheek.
“Nobody’s – fault?” Harry repeats, dumbly, unsure exactly how he could have missed his whole world sinking in on itself; the walls crumbling around him.
“Mmm, thanks,” said Harry, biting his lip. “I like your robes too. Bit more understated than last time, I guess, but that’s no bad thing.” He leant in, eyes sparkling. “Especially if they’re just going to end up on my floor anyway.”
“Look,” said Harry, still staring straight ahead, dropping Draco’s arm as quickly as he’d taken it. “I didn’t say you had to leave. If you wanted to stay and watch the match – well, I mean, you bought a ticket, right? I can’t stop you.”
“It’s neither of those though, not really. I’ve been thinking about it, and I owe you the truth. I’m afraid you’re not going to like it.”
Malfoy finally had the good grace to look a bit sheepish. “Listen, just because I make light of it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten. I travelled halfway around the world to get away from being Draco Malfoy. Can you blame me for trying to make the best of things?”
exerted its pull – was slowly, but surely, fading. This Draco, dragged along helplessly by a current he couldn’t escape, could barely tell that he was acting more recklessly than ever.
Potter was looking incredibly impressive in his formal black Auror robes, which were worn swallowtail-style over fitted trousers, with gold epaulettes and a thick braided aiguillette on the right shoulder. They were close-fitting and held together at the front with intricate golden clasps, accentuating Potter’s muscular form. The Order of Merlin was pinned to his broad chest, completing the outfit. He looked composed, commanding, and sexy as all hell. Whenever he caught Draco’s eye it did strange things to Draco’s insides.
“Sounds like you’re going to be as much use as a chocolate cauldron, Granger. Some Head Healer you are. Go on then, tell me you can’t do anything and fuck off.”
and Leonie urged him to go high, Draco – tangled up in a fit of guilt and misery one night – agreed to supply the potion for just a few Galleons over cost price.
A young man, short and of solid build, turned from where he was chatting with the bartender. He hopped off the stool, a wide grin on his face as he loped over. “All right, guys?”
Nervous, Harry complies; but there’s nothing except affection behind Draco’s heated gaze, and Harry kisses him gratefully. He moves into him, feeling Draco’s fingers settle on his hips, guiding him forwards until he’s fully seated inside Draco; that tight, hot, familiar sensation that’s been theirs and theirs alone. Harry smiles down at Draco; he can’t help it, watching that beautiful rosy flush appear across Draco’s cheekbones, the one reserved only for Harry.

about Draco’s new shop, that he was pleased Draco was doing well. Theo himself was training to be an Obliviator, he was doing fine, but he wondered if Draco ever thought about him or would be interested in meeting up, for old times’ sake.
They sat down at his small kitchen table – Draco’s discomfort growing by the minute – and Pansy waved away his offer of tea, insisting on pouring them both generous glasses of Riesling. Then, without so much as a “how’ve you been?” she immediately launched into an extensive account of her life since school, leaving Draco unable to get a word in edgeways.
A few other people were milling around the Atrium. Their shadows flitted across the walls, in and out of nooks and crannies, making Draco feel suddenly vulnerable. He peered closer, hand on his wand – but no, there were only couples, giggling and flirting. Draco could hardly bear to look at them, so he leant over the edge of the Fountain of Magical Brethren instead, staring up at the enormous golden statues sparkling above him. They reminded him, as so many things did, of
“Me neither.” Harry swallows, blinks hard again. He knows the answer, saw it in the pain behind Draco’s eyes, felt it in every tender sweep of his fingers, but asks anyway. “Is there no chance? Nothing I can do – nothing we can try to change?”
He arrived in the stand as the Magpies scored their first goal, sighs and boos erupting as he carried his pretzel carefully down Row B. When he reached Harry, he was greeted with a sidewards glance and a careful, “you’re back, then?”
wanted. It had worked perfectly again, of course, and Neville’s opinion of him now would be a damn sight better than it would have been without its help. But Draco felt a slight pang of regret that the ‘changed man’ he’d presented himself as today was – well, if not a lie, at least
“Oh, do fuck off, Pans,” he spat back at her. “I’m amazed you managed to pull your head out of your own arse long enough to read the
Eventually, with no sign of any further questions, Draco’s impatience got the better of him. “Is that it?”

thought about it; had recognised that he’d always enjoyed working with his hands, appreciated the satisfaction he derived from holding something he’d crafted. And it was only when he’d tested the waters with his friends, discovered the joy it brought him, that he’d realised how painfully accurate Draco’s words had been; realised just how well he really had known Harry after all.
When it eventually happened, Harry had, of course, been distracted. Not by the way Draco’s heavy breathing echoed off the bricks, not by the way his cheeks were stained just-shagged scarlet, and
As he watched, Malfoy extended his arm, lazily, dipping his fingers into the lake. Concentric circles spread rapidly outwards, perfectly even, the water lapping at the shore with tiny splashing sounds. Malfoy was frowning, worrying at his bottom lip again, so Harry took hold of his other hand and brought it up to his face. Malfoy’s hand shivered against his mouth, and he pressed a gentle kiss to the palm, feeling them then: tiny sparks of magic, trapped beneath the skin.
Lee blushed and looked away. “Thank you.” She always appeared slightly starstruck by Hermione, and perhaps a tad scared, as well. Not without reason, Draco mused, recalling a stinging blow to the cheek all those years ago.
To begin with, he circled each quadrant, scanning for the Snitch in much the same way he did every Saturday for his amateur league team down in Brighton. He was energised and hyper-focussed, and it wasn’t hard to keep his mind on the match. Below him, the Chasers were calling to one another, sending the Quaffle whizzing up and down the pitch while the Bludgers whipped back and forth between them. Harry loved this part, loved the bird’s eye view of the game afforded to him as he soared high above them all. In the back of his mind, of course, he was aware that Malfoy wasn’t nearby – perhaps wasn’t shadowing his movements quite as Harry might have expected. But his competitive instincts, slightly dampened by the pre-match antics, had roared back to life the moment they’d kicked off, and with his pulse racing and his reflexes primed, it was almost impossible to worry about Malfoy’s position.
. He trusted you with things he never told anyone else.” She looked over at Neville. “What was it he said to you, Nev? That time, at Ron and Hermione’s? When Ron asked why he kept visiting Draco’s shop, and he got really annoyed?”
Draco frowned after her and apologised profusely to Lila, who didn’t seem bothered in the slightest. In fact, she paused only to tear the meat fiercely off another rib before launching into an explanation of her newest proposal for an anti-poaching bill.
Potter tilted his head. “Er, not really. Feels like―” he considered for a second “―like tiny pin-pricks under my skin. Bubbling or something. Or, you know, like popping candy.” Draco didn’t know, but he got the picture.
Thomas relaxed, his face opening up into a smile. “Something like that. But hey, I heard about your dad. Must have been hard for you too.”
But times had changed; he was driven by desperation now, and besides, the war had greatly narrowed his options. If by some miracle a wizard didn’t recognise and reject him on sight, an accidental glimpse of the Dark Mark would definitely ruin the mood, and things could quite possibly turn nasty. Besides which, Draco was painfully aware of his sexual inexperience. Anonymity was clearly key, so Muggles it was.
on the line to keep your secret. Did you ever stop to think what it would have done to him – to all of us – if you’d died? I hope you know how lucky you are. I’ve lost so many people I cared about, Draco. I was so scared I’d lose you, too.
Crowson was wearing a scarlet and black Quidditch jersey, stretched too tight over his round belly, and his face was red and contorted with rage. His jowls wobbled as he looked down at Draco. “Thought you’d got away scot-free, did you? Thought you’d slip out of your big fancy mansion, play the good little shopkeeper, and no one would remember all that shit you did, huh?” He nudged at Draco’s side with his boot. “Well, let me tell you something, Death Eater.
“You don’t need one,” he said, emphatically. She smiled, then, a genuine smile, and he felt his own lips curve upwards too as he spoke. “Now, are we going to stand here chatting all day? I thought you had a few jobs for me to get on with, boss?”
had wanted him to avoid the sit-down meal so that he might slip in unnoticed. As he entered, though, it quickly became apparent that the exact opposite was true. Dinner had clearly only just finished, and everyone except a few keen dancers was still sat at their tables. As he entered the room, heads from all four corners swivelled towards Draco. The string quartet were finishing up their piece, the twirling couples coming to a standstill, and even the loud buzz of excited voices he’d heard from the Atrium seemed to die down as he walked into the room.
seemed to give him a preternatural instinct for how to best serve each customer, and not one person left empty-handed. Witches and wizards who might have been visiting just to gawp at the Death Eater suddenly remembered that they were all out of Sleeping Draught or Doxycide, and exited the shop with a paper bag in their hand and a smile on their face. Almost as surprising to Draco was the fact that none of the patients had hexed, cursed or even raised their voice to him. In fact, people had been downright complimentary, praising him for his tenacity, his hard work and his good business sense.
remember Hogwarts, even if you don’t…” His eyes wandered slowly up and down Harry’s body, the tip of his tongue poking out to wet his lips. “Why not forget about it, just for now, and come back to bed. I’ve been thinking about it too, you know – God, the things I could do to you… I’ll make it so good, you’ll see. I’ll do anything you want…” He reached his hand out towards Harry, raising one eyebrow and giving his most persuasive, million-Galleon,
“It’s – I –?” is all Draco manages, before he visibly composes himself. “Thank you. You look good, too.”
Saturday dawned, misty and beautiful. A late frost had arrived overnight, giving the Manor lawns an ethereal appearance with stranding of spider webs visible between the crisp grass. After breakfast, Draco headed down to his lab to check on his latest batch of
on it?” Harry shot back, setting his magazine down and regarding Draco dispassionately. “Anyway, I’m not sure where you got the idea that you’re the one who’s asking the questions here.”
“I know. I knew I reacted badly. This is all new for me too, and I’m trying. I want so much to be good for you, Harry. God, I want it to be perfect, but I know… I know that it can’t be. You’ve seen the worst parts of me, Harry. Every time I remember what I did, I feel unworthy of… of this kind of thing.”
The guests on either side stepped away, conversation once again ceasing as Dennis stalked across the kitchen. Draco shrank back against the wall, palm sweaty around his wand as he weighed up his options. Dennis began raising his arm, and Draco heard a few murmurs of encouragement from around them. He braced himself to run, but in very next moment, thank Merlin, Neville was there, resting a hand on Dennis’ extended forearm, voice calm but firm. “Not now, please. I invited Draco.”
Potter sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “I just can’t believe he did that to you. How’s it feeling now?” He squinted at Draco’s arm, frowning. “It still looks a bit of a mess – I thought Mungo’s would have fixed it up better than that…”
Draco drew his knees up to his chest defensively, dropping his head forward onto them and wrapping his arms around himself, trying to ignore the shudders running through his body. It was the very question he’d been asking himself since the second the bathroom door had closed behind Harry last night.
Potter?” He laughed, full of spite, dropping his wand arm down as he turned further towards Potter. “Does he bend over nicely for you? Or maybe you like a bit of humiliation yourself, Potter? Are you getting on your knees for―”
Harry looked tired. His face had changed, as though brought into sharp relief: features a little larger, eyes set a little deeper, skin a little rougher. Older. But he was here, next to Draco, achingly familiar and so wonderfully real. Draco couldn’t help but smile as an enormous sense of relief – of contentment – washed over him.
“So, I’d now like to bring forward two people to speak in support of the bill. I hope their heartbreaking first-hand experiences will highlight the important role that enacting this legislation will serve in protecting some of the most vulnerable in our society.” She turned towards them. “First, I’d like to invite Miss Leonie Burbage to the lectern. Miss Burbage is the co-owner of
, I don’t doubt. But I haven’t seen Granger since school… and she was scary enough back then. I dread to think what she’s like with the full weight of the Ministry for support.”
– drifted over Draco like promises, or confessions. It was as though Harry had reached deep inside Draco’s chest and cracked him open, pouring into his broken body a thousand things Draco had never even known he could feel. Overcome once more, he lost his rhythm, thrusts faltering slightly, the same old worries creeping ever so slowly into the back of his mind. But Harry just smiled down at him fondly, as though reading his thoughts, and reached for his hand, and all Draco’s doubts shrivelled up and disappeared again. They moved together, gloriously unhurried, delighting in one another, until Harry’s eyes rolled back in his head, and his body began to shudder, and Draco’s did too, and they chased one another over the edge, all the time smiling and smiling like they might never stop.
“Oh, absolutely. If you’re still game, that is?” Harry spoke deliberately, sensually, dragging his words out into a promise that made Draco shiver.
. I still have no idea how I ended up with this A-Team beta-reading my first fanfic, and I am absolutely humbled to have benefited from your skill and experience. You were wonderful, and so kind. Thank you all.
was here, protecting him like it always had. Nagini was gone, and all he needed was a nice, cool drink to slake his thirst so here it was – his very own lake to sip from.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. He folded his arms across his chest. Draco’s gaze automatically flicked to his biceps where they flexed against the tight dragonhide. “Yeah, and I know what you’re going to say, so don’t bother.”
. As they admired the crocuses in the walled garden, their honeyed scent filling the air, it dawned on Draco that it would be the perfect day for lunch out on the terrace.

had never been wrong before, and besides, how could he turn away Professor Burbage’s daughter? After what had happened in his very house?
Malfoy’s brow furrowed, his warm smile losing a little of its lustre. “There’s not much to tell, really,” he said, carefully, but his heavy sigh belied him. “It’s… it’s not a big deal. I just… I hadn’t been home in years, y’know? I worked so, so hard to… to reinvent myself, to come up with this whole new persona, and I
should go and talk to her!” Seamus said, giving Dean an enormous shove. Dean, in turn, stumbled into Draco, who grabbed a nearby chair for support. Several heads turned, including that of the blonde-haired woman sat next to Ginny, and Dean ducked quickly behind Draco and Neville.
Of course, at the time, Harry had remained unmoved; had weighed up his response carefully, eventually choosing flirty (
“Oh, come on, Draco. This is practically fate. What was your plan for the rest of the year? To keep wasting away in the Manor?  Or to look for an apprenticeship, when you know you’re well above that level now? Come off it. It might not work, but you’ll never know if you don’t try, will you?”
tried to force his feet to move forward, his arms to reach out. It took a great effort, but he managed to stay still.
Promise be damned, he thought – when the best possible future he could foresee played out worse than a nightmare, there was really only the one remaining option. He would go down to the shop; he had more than enough Dreamless Sleep there, after all. He’d write Harry a letter first, setting out his final requests – that his secret be kept, that all the proceeds from his business should go to his mother. Harry was so very decent, so
“Ah yes. Thank you. So I had all that crap at home, but with the Yanks it was almost too easy. One decent Occlumency demonstration and they snapped me right up. Sent me off for advanced training in Legilimency, false image projection and memory modification too, then set me up with a nice swanky office, a hefty salary, and a fresh start. All at the bargain price of leaving behind everything I loved.” He shrugged, too casual. “Easy decision, in the end.”
Draco’s chest grew tight, his voice coming out louder and higher than he’d intended as he stumbled over his explanation. “Pansy! Pansy Parkinson, her fiancé, he works for the Cannons. Not
, had never managed wordless magic, and his focus was probably the worst it had ever been. He had no idea what he was doing.
“Yes, yes, thanks Potter.” Draco scowled. “Sure, she can be a little… coarse at times, but she’s clearly a hard worker, and it’s not like I haven’t heard worse. Anyway, she’s been through so much shit since the war, it’s a wonder she’s handling it half as well. You know,” he said, lowering his voice and glancing back at the lab, “after her parents were murdered, the Ministry literally didn’t want to know. Now she’s stuck living in a completely different country, with Muggles who she barely knew, and having to hide all her knowledge of the wizarding world. I’d be pretty pissed off too.”
“I’m afraid,” begins Draco smoothly, his words directed at the agent, even as he glances over the man’s shoulder at Harry, “that I’ve made a mistake. I’m sorry to waste your time, but I need –”
lovely, gaze fixed on your younger self. He’s restless, coiled tight with unspent energy, expression fierce but sure. Young Draco stares back, wrongfooted, rosy glow spreading fast across his cheeks.
Yet again, this was all a new experience for Draco – he’d had guys deep-throat him before, but he’d never felt the urge to try it himself, and so of course, he hadn’t. But right now, all he wanted was to give Harry
Draco pulled the stopper out with his teeth and downed the contents. After a brief abortive attempt to remove his boots one-handed he gave up, Vanishing them along with his socks.

They were both breathing heavily by now, hands growing bolder, tugging at clothing, grasping at flesh. Draco drew back slightly to take Harry’s lower lip between his teeth, nipping at it softly until Harry let out a long, broken moan. It echoed around them, far too loud, almost pornographic in the enormous room.
He knew what Harry was referring to. Of everything he had been forced to relive, that had been the worst. Watching from the grounds next to the Dark Lord as his mother, under Imperius, climbed slowly up onto the stone balustrade of the Manor’s third floor balcony. There she’d stood, shivering in the wind, blue nightgown flapping around her legs, occasionally offering a glimpse of her silk underwear. Some of the spectators had cheered and shouted crude remarks, while the Dark Lord waved his wand and made her dance a little jig.
“Potter, I need someone who can provide a reliable long-term supply of dragon-derived ingredients. It’s a big ask. I hardly think a Weasley is likely to do me any favours after everything I – everything that happened. Imagine he’d delight in telling me where to get off if I even tried.”

dark. Something felt off. Wasn’t there normally a streetlight outside? Feeling uneasy, he closed his eyes again, fervently seeking the comforting blanket of sleep.

to wear off – it was impossible to collect his thoughts while on the potion. After the first time, he’d lain awake for hours, head spinning.
The blood rushed to Draco’s groin at the unmistakable meaning behind Harry’s words. “I… I will,” he got out, voice small.
“If we’re still keeping things from each other, Harry, if we’re embarrassed or scared to talk about how we feel, well… what kind of foundation is that for a… a relationship?”
in his bloodstream and leaving the muscles in his legs twitching with the sudden urge to run. Unable to suppress it, Draco jumped off the bed, twisting his hands painfully in front of him as he paced back and forth across the room. After spending so much of his early life powerless, tossed about like a leaf on the wind at the whim of his family and then the Dark Lord, Draco had relished the feeling of control that the
It was Lofts, screaming from below them, and pointing frantically off to the side where – just a couple of metres away – the Snitch was hovering once more. Harry groaned in frustration and looked over at Malfoy, who raised one eyebrow, clearly amused. “The score’s close, you know.”
Harry was very close – touching distance, really – and looking up at Draco through his lashes with a faint blush staining his cheeks. Lightheaded, and in desperate need of breathing space, Draco took a few steps back. He pushed himself up to sit on top of the counter, running his finger over the repaired burn mark – a rough indentation in the grain of the oak, barely visible now – trying to settle his nerves.
right now. Apparently, if I’m not going to Sixth Form, I’ve got to start earning my keep. Oh yeah, and obviously I’ll need to be paid in pounds. Can wizards do online banking?”
later, they managed to find a semi-comfortable position resting back-to-back, propping each other up. Malfoy tilted his head to rest it against Harry’s shoulder, and Harry did likewise, willing himself not to give in to his sleep-addled instincts and bury his nose in Malfoy’s neck. Harry wrapped his hands tightly around his broom on either side, concentrating on the comforting weight of Malfoy’s warm body against his own, and let his eyelids drift shut, hoping with all his worth that their sticking charms would hold.
tasteful, if a little on-the-nose. And it’s beautifully done too – the texture of the mane, the movement? Could’ve been a lot worse.”
The blood rushed back into Draco’s frozen limbs as he savoured the warmth of the room, and he removed his cloak, draping it over the chair nearest the door. Lee followed suit with her coat and scarf; her tight sparkling gold dress underneath causing heads, predictably, to begin swivelling towards them.
By the time they’d finally finished recapping every single encounter Leonie could remember, it was pitch black outside. Draco was slumped across the sofa, massaging his aching temples, half-dead with exhaustion. Lee had draped her arm loosely around his shoulders as they’d been talking, and her bloodshot eyes shone with concern as she twisted her head to look at Draco.
“Nah, that can’t be it. Even old Braithwaite’s made Senior Auror, and he’s been involved in so many fuck-ups that I’ve heard criminals actually cheer when he shows up at the scene. You can’t tell me
Draco leans over, then, buries his face in Harry’s hair. He inhales deeply, his words an unhappy sigh. “I don’t think so. Not now. Another time, perhaps we could have – but we’re not –”
Draco snorted. He swallowed the last of his scone and dabbed his mouth with a napkin. “Maybe. But I’ve always found that Potions is quite straightforward, when you understand and follow the basic principles. I think you probably lack a decent foundation, due perhaps to the aforementioned ‘vicious bastard’. Maybe I can help. Is it a specific potion you’re struggling with?”
There was a chime as the door opened behind him, and he whirled around in surprise. “I’m afraid we’re not actually o…”
Draco closed his eyes briefly, cock filling to full hardness as Harry’s words shot through him like an arrow to the chest. He couldn’t imagine that he’d ever wanted anything more in his life. He felt for a second like he might actually die from pure lust, and even despite the
“Sorry, sorry, I… of course,” stammered Hermione, rushing over to the crumpled figure at Pansy’s feet. It was Malfoy, of course, although barely recognisable. His head was turned to the side, an awful mask-like impression of his face stamped in scarlet on the parquet floor beneath his cheek. Watery blood poured from the crooked wreck of his nose, splashing onto the edge of the rug and seeping into his unkempt hair. The thin line of his top lip was distorted by a gash on one side, and his breathing was heavy and wet-sounding. She could see his throat working continuously above the neck of his pyjama top as he swallowed again and again.
The funeral took place in the Manor grounds, just the two of them and the Ministry wizard who conducted the ceremony. Draco and his mother stood side-by-side, not quite touching. There was no eulogy and no crying. Draco watched as raindrops gradually darkened the stone of the newly transfigured tomb and wondered if his mother was thinking the same as him: how much his father, ever infatuated with displays of pomp and circumstance, would have loathed it all.
For some reason, it was an especially tricky chase. Harry was, of course, extremely well-practised at anticipating the Snitch’s trajectory, but this one seemed to take an unusual path, darting down in between the trees and emerging through a narrow gap – Harry and Malfoy in tow – only to fly straight at the Ministry officials. They all ducked, a few even diving to the ground, but the Snitch followed them, grazing the top of Kingsley’s shiny pate and flying directly through Hermione’s curls, before taking a sharp turn towards the refreshments stand. The two of them kept up the chase – Harry couldn’t be sure, but he thought he spotted Malfoy grabbing another teacake on the way past – before the little ball began speeding back across the pitch, deviating slightly to whack Russell sharply on the side of the head as it passed. Harry was confused, but nonetheless continued to follow it, winding in and out of the Unspeakables’ hoops and forcing their groggy Keeper to dive out of the way. Finally, the Snitch sped back up to the little spot where he and Malfoy had slept the night, and hovered there, as if in wait. Harry arrived first, breathless, and didn’t spare a glance behind him, completely focussed on his glittering prize as he reached out with one gloved hand and―
Draco raised a sceptical eyebrow at his reflection, turning from side to side to examine his entire outfit. The mirror was usually complimentary – of course it was – and the robes definitely suited him, but
or booze; anything, really, which might help him forget. It required every last shred of self-control that he possessed not to head straight down to Knockturn, Galleons in hand. But he paced, and he breathed, and he counted down the hours until slowly the darkness began to pass, and it was only when the deep black of the night sky finally lightened into a murky slate grey that he collapsed, exhausted, by the fire.
Harry leant back, looking at Draco appraisingly. “Well, I don’t know about the other fools in there, but―”
Draco’s mouth twists unpleasantly. “Bit late now, isn’t it? The whole world thinks you’re fucking Katie Bell.”
“No good, I’m afraid,” called Pansy, her voice echoing in the empty room. “I think he’s resistant, somehow. Best I’ve managed is tying him down, but he makes such a bloody fuss that he ends up hurting himself like that too. Anyhow,” she huffed, “any chance of you getting on with your job,
Leonie’s anxious voice drifted up the stairs, interrupting his fatalistic train of thought. “Draco? Are you all right up there? I heard a bang. Do you need any help?”
“Probably true,” agreed Draco, rubbing his belly lazily, ridges of muscles rippling beneath his shirt. It was crazy, really: the past few weeks it felt like he’d done nothing but gorge himself on Potter’s delicious cooking – gourmet-style dinners, enormous continental breakfasts and even neatly organised packed lunches filled with all Draco’s favourite goodies – but somehow the more Draco seemed to eat, the fitter he got. Why, every time he glanced in the mirror, his body seemed a little less ‘anaemic, sallow-skinned Ministry shift worker’, and a little more ‘Quidditch Weekly centrefold’. Draco had dimly wondered if Potter actually
Draco stretches; untucks those long, elegant legs, unwinds their fingers slowly. “I guess I’ll see you soon then.” He stands, looking down at Harry curiously. “Hey, don’t forget to add me to your wards – if you really do want me to Floo-call, that is.”
. Every single time you go out, I have to see pictures of some girl draping herself all over you, read all this bullshit about who you’re dating, wonder what
Harry laughs, managing by some miracle to stay upright. He opens his arms wide and lurches back towards Draco.
They Flooed in together – Lee dressed the smartest Draco had ever seen her in a trouser suit and pink striped shirt. Her eyes widened as she emerged from the flames into the vast Atrium, amongst hundreds of witches and wizards bustling back and forth, robes swishing behind them. She was knocked forward by an old wizard who strode out of the Floo after her, but she barely acknowledged his tutting, instead tipping her head back to get a better look at the golden symbols moving across the ceiling. Draco waited patiently for her. His own eyes were resolutely fixed on the fountain straight ahead – he didn’t trust himself so much as a single glance towards the pillar where Harry had found him all those months ago.
I’m coming to live with you.’ Had to make up a cover story and everything.” Granger shook her head in disbelief. “Oh yeah, I forgot, the Ministry witch made sure to
. It always felt detached, unreal, like the end of a very pleasant dream, and Draco regularly found himself wandering around the shop with a smile on his face, lost in his fantasies. So, it was with some considerable surprise that, one afternoon, caught in up such thoughts, Draco exited his lab to find Potter– the real Potter – standing directly in front of him. He was dressed casually, in an oversized maroon jumper and blue jeans that reminded Draco of their school days. He nodded amicably at Draco.

An angry shout across the street makes them both look up; a bus speeds away through a deep puddle, leaving a dripping wet couple yelling in its wake. Harry gathers his courage as he watches them shake themselves off. “It was your idea,” he blurts out. He’s never told anyone that before; it feels strange to say it out loud. “The brooms. Do you remember?”
manage eight seconds on a mare they called the Dueling Demon… so yeah, I got pretty handy at muscle soothing charms around the same time.”
Malfoy looked incredulous, but Harry merely tightened his grip, tugging him up to standing. Malfoy swung his leg over the broomstick, Harry following suit behind him, leaning over to grasp the handle over Malfoy’s still-shaking hands. He tucked his chin over Malfoy’s shoulder, guiding the two of them slowly up and into the still evening sky.
In his dazed state, it doesn’t occur to him for a second not to do as Draco asked. He crosses the road – fortunately the rain has just settled – and plonks himself heavily down on a bench outside the now-laundrette to wait. He tips his head back into the wind, letting the gentle hum of traffic wash over him, feeling his initial shock begin to subside, giving way to genuine curiosity.
since he’d finally ditched those silly glasses, a brilliant shifting turquoise; hypnotic, like the rays of morning light filtering through the lake into the Slytherin common room.
“Oh, that.” Harry closes his eyes briefly, embarrassed. “That would be marrying Gin. When I was still – when I knew – well.”
“Charmed,” said Draco politely, taking a seat. Lila was all angles, her hair thin, her skin scarred and pitted, and although Draco had assumed her to be elderly at a distance, as he looked closer he realised she could probably have been any age from forty to eighty. Her close-set eyes narrowed with suspicion as Draco extended his hand – a look all too familiar since Draco had given up the
He finished his letter and Draco handed it to Itti. Goodness only knew what Potter would think when Megaera, the Malfoy eagle owl, delivered it. He often wondered if Neville’s friends knew about his regular visits, but, for some reason, when he was on
– down Draco’s shaft. Draco screwed his eyes shut, toes curling involuntarily as he struggled with every fibre in his being to stay still. And then, just as he was certain he couldn’t bear another second, Harry let out a long, shaky breath, planting his hands firmly over the scars on Draco’s chest, and began to move.
remembering that makes them so appealing.” He tilted his chin up just slightly, all defiance, and Harry had just begun to worry that he’d caused offence, when he spotted the corner of Malfoy’s thin lip begin to wobble. Relieved, Harry found an answering smile spreading across his own face.
Potter shrugged. “Only for precision work. Easier without, for most things. More powerful, too, these days.” He smiled sheepishly at Draco. Silence fell once more.
Finally spent, Harry loosened his grip on Draco’s shirt, staggering to the side and slumping down across the stairs. Draco stared at him for a second – he was lying awkwardly, uncomfortably, along the wooden staircase; his legs splayed apart, shamelessly displaying the damp patch on his underwear – and let out an incredulous laugh. It echoed in the still air of the hallway, and Harry lifted his head up slowly, eyes heavy-lidded.
He still visited his mother after Quidditch on Sunday, and if she noticed a difference, she certainly never mentioned it to Draco – indeed, she always seemed most anxious to tell him about her own problems while they wandered the grounds. Apparently, after her hyacinths had won first prize at the recent club awards, Josephine Bullstrode had spread a rumour that she’d been using climate control charms, which, naturally, were against the rules. Narcissa had done no such thing, of course – in fact, the chairwoman herself had visited the Manor to check – but her angry refutations had only stoked the longstanding animosity between herself and Josephine. Their weekly meetings were becoming increasingly frosty affairs, with everyone forced to choose a side, illuminating arguments which had been brewing for years. Sadly, this meant that a number of events on the social calendar were no longer open to his mother, who in turn was fuming and plotting her revenge.
Before you can talk yourself out of it, you pull the memory out of the Pensieve, sealing it in its vial and resting it carefully down on the rug. You raise one booted foot, breathing deeply. You close your eyes, tense your muscles and – pause, frowning. There’s a tapping noise, insistent, to your right.
“Do you realise it’s been four days, Potter? Now I’m not saying I expected you to Floo over the minute your Portkey returned,
But then, he thought, the irony not lost on him for a second, he’d never really been lucky after all, had he?
“Harry’s date. It was this guy Will – he’s a junior Healer. Seemed like a really nice guy too, but it’s just…”
– and all the while Harry stands, gaze searching, waiting for an answer. Hesitantly, young Draco looks up. Nods, just barely.
“Yeah. And your hair’s all over the place, and your robes…” He eyed Malfoy suspiciously. “Were you fighting with the ferret?”
for years. It’s been years since I’ve had to worry about what I should or shouldn’t say, and I don’t – I don’t know the
Harry looked back, arms still out in front of him – an invite, perhaps, or a plea. The sun was beginning to set outside, casting the room in a warm pink glow. Harry’s eyes were bright, and focussed, and all Draco could see. Harry’s words were soft.
They turned down Horizont Alley, passing Alessandro’s, where most of the lights were off, the last of the waiters busily

knew I had to draw that story, Draco’s development and journey through addiction. I got it, and not only I fell in love with her Draco and his troubles, but working with Lauren was brilliant. She was very on board with all of my craziest ideas, and if not for her support and trust in my work, I wouldn’t have achieved half of what I did. I’m thrilled with the results and the opportunity to work with such an amazing person.
High on this sudden understanding, on Harry’s nearness, Draco murmured his words fondly against wand-calloused skin. “Are you going to ask me if you can help me upstairs this time?”
Things had ended here, finally, on a long, lonely night spent watching Draco sleep, Harry committing every second to memory: the steady rise and fall of his chest, the occasional twitching of his fingers, the way his rhythmic breathing disturbed the fine strands of hair on his forehead. But things had started here, too: important things, life-changing things; things he could never have dreamed of at the time. He thinks of that night: the two of them lying in bed, drowsy and silly in a post-coital haze, Draco holding Harry’s hand up above his face, kissing each of his fingers.
, okay? The bloody blow job. The way I… I could – well, I don’t think I can do that anymore. So, yes. I’m sorry if that disappoints you.” He pressed his lips together, glaring at Harry.
days, he would work with his mother in the garden, harvesting plants for the shop. Most afternoons he found the time to go flying, too, which was a joy. His old Seeker reflexes were back, and he was pleased to note some muscle definition returning to his body.
She turned to him, hands on hips and chin raised, but her eyes were unmistakably misty. “No. No, Draco. You don’t get to just… to just come down here, and… and…” Her lip trembled slightly, and he frowned. Knowing how she hated to be seen as weak, he stepped back, and she slipped past him to stand behind the counter. She wrapped both arms around her waist, holding herself, vulnerable and unsure for the first time Draco could remember. He took a shaky step towards her. The damaged wood stretched out between them.
) was able to affect an air of relaxed nonchalance. His composure did, however, falter slightly when after just a few minutes of small talk, Potter tugged his trousers down at the side to show Draco how his wound had faded to a barely perceptible line. Fortunately, any gathering awkwardness was rapidly dispelled by the arrival of Lee, who bounded over, gleefully poked at the scar, and let out a cheer.
too hard. There’s no time to rectify that, though, as the force of the spell blasts the tray right onto the tiles with a metallic clang, at the exact same moment that the pile of smiley faces erupts into an inferno of waist-high flames. Harry jumps backwards away from the searing heat, panic rising as the fire begins to lick at the counter top, emitting clouds of acrid-smelling black smoke. Suddenly, a single warning
had taken Draco over, was choosing his words, guiding his steps. This was what he needed, after all. It felt so good – so
was even more exhilarating than wanking, he thought, drinking in the scent of the other man’s cologne, tasting sweat on his tongue as he thrust his hips forward. Draco moaned, pleasure racing through him, raising him up, higher and higher from whisky sours and illegal potions, cigarette smoke, the strobing lights of the dance floor and the cool, sure hand of a Muggle stranger stroking him to a dizzying, shuddering climax.
“Oh yes, there he goes alright. Mmmm. I must say, Draco, I was sceptical at first, but you’re absolutely right. I’ve never seen anyone toss a gnome with quite that much –”
It was ironic, he thought, how intrinsic the Weasleys were to his business success. George and Ron had finally opened their Hogsmeade branch, and their ingredient requirements were increasing exponentially. They were so short on time that they even asked Draco to help refine some of their newest products. That was how, in a turn of events almost too bizarre to be believed, Draco found himself putting the finishing touches to George’s ‘Heroes of Hogwarts’ range: bright, fruit-flavoured potions which gave the drinker a temporary – and deliberately crude – resemblance to school-age Potter (messy hair, glasses, scar), Granger (bushy hair, high-pitched voice), Weasley (orange hair, freckles) or Neville (blond hair, chubby face, buck teeth).
The agent follows him, apparently undeterred by his quick exit, keeping up his patter about chains and mortgages all the way down the stairs. Harry stops just before the bottom – feeling wretched, his skin crawling – while he waits for the man to catch up. It’s probably rude to rush straight out into the street, after all.
Draco finally allowed himself to relax, the now-familiar speech washing over him as he surveyed the courtroom. The signs were good, he thought – Lee hit her stride immediately and everyone present was listening. He allowed himself a quick glance up to the high benches – and found, to his shock, that green eyes were staring straight back at him. He must have visibly startled, because Harry’s mouth curved into a smile, and Draco rolled his own eyes in response. Harry inclined his head to indicate Lee, giving Draco a little thumbs up. Draco returned the gesture, biting his lip and trying to keep his face neutral, before finally forcing himself to look away. He counted a full minute before glancing back, but when he did, Harry hadn’t moved an inch. Harry’s smile widened, and he still didn’t avert his gaze as Draco felt himself blush from head to foot, toes curling inside his well-polished shoes.
Draco froze, confused and disorientated, his stupid, strung-out brain trying to catch up with his instincts which were telling him that he’d got what he came for, that it was time to leave. The man’s brows drew together in confusion at Draco’s hesitation. He tilted his head for a kiss, before fisting his hand in Draco’s shirt and tugging him downwards. After another long second, Draco let him. He didn’t know exactly how
He wakes, and he’s sweating, and nightmarish shapes are dancing across the stones; old foes brought back to life. He’s never lit that fire, not even in the depths of winter when the cold seemed to seep straight through the walls and into his tired bones, and he’d crawled into bed straight after sundown every night just to escape the chill.
?” The word was spat with violent force, and they both jumped as a tree off to the left let out a loud squeal, all its leaves flying off into the air. Harry scrubbed at his face. “Merlin
“You’re not wrong,” said Harry, slowly, with a wry smile. “In fact... well, to be honest, he asks me every month, Malfoy. Every fucking month, without fail. He wanted me to come straight in at Senior Auror, can you imagine? Right out of school – right out of the war.”
, and he shuddered a little as he tried not to choke. After a long minute, she let him go, and they stared at each other. Pansy was wearing a Muggle pinstripe trousersuit with heels, and she’d grown her hair long, pinning it up at the back in a sleek bun. But otherwise, the last time he’d seen her might have been yesterday.
“I’ll say,” replied Draco, stretching languorously and reaching for another cherry, biting it sharply off the stem. Harry knelt next to him, bringing a delicate foot to his lips. “That blouse was… mmm… Gucci. Bloody philistine.” He threw his head back as Harry ran the tip of his tongue over the bones of his ankle.
“The Aurors raided Slug & Jiggers last week; apparently they found an enormous stash of illegal potions. Harry couldn’t say much, but it must have been pretty bad – the owner’s still in the Ministry holding cells, and they’ve closed down the whole shop.”
Discussions about George, however, sent Draco into fresh paroxysms of guilt that night. It had been bad enough when the dragon Weasley – who Draco had never even met – had agreed to help him. But Ron’s mentions of the surviving Weasley twin had reminded Draco how the two brothers were never apart at Hogwarts. He thought of the last time he had seen George – face pale and contorted in horror as he stared down at his brother’s lifeless body in the Great Hall.
“So Harry came in just as we were finishing up the bottling. The whole place stank of eucalyptus, that awful sticky base mix stuff that Sleekeazy’s send, you know. And Harry left his jacket out on the counter, because he didn’t want it to smell…”
Harry shrugs, embarrassed, trainers squelching as he edges across the flooded floor. His heart swells with affection as he nears Draco – his gorgeous, sexy Draco, barefoot in his pyjama bottoms, hair still adorably sleep-rumbled – and he leans in for a kiss.
“Indeed,” said Pansy, with a dramatic sigh. “It seems I’m destined to spend my entire life listening to Draco obsess over Potter.”
His mother was surprised, but pleased, when Draco asked to join her for a walk with the Crups. Since his father’s death, she’d insisted on wearing only black, and had become – if it were possible – even more reclusive. Draco had deliberately avoided spending too long around her since the funeral for fear she’d bring up the war, his future, or something else equally awful, so he was pleasantly surprised when on their turn around the garden none of those topics arose. The initially uncomfortable silence was quickly broken when Draco tripped over into the Alihotsy tree, causing him to burst into an uncontrollable fit of giggles. Eventually, both of them were bent double with laughter. After that, the conversation flowed freely.
” Malfoy called back – but he didn’t look over, or slow down in the slightest, and so, slightly helplessly, Harry pulled up alongside him. Malfoy glanced over then, taking in Harry’s face, which was definitely flushed and sweaty, before shaking his head in exasperation. “Potter, I already
“Oh come on, you started all this, remember? Back in fifth year? All so I wouldn’t tell anyone that―” Draco stopped, cut off mid-sentence by the highly unpleasant sensation of an invisible hand, squeezing his throat.
“Not just yet, I don’t think,” said Harry, quirking a playful eyebrow. He pulled a glossy brochure out of his pocket, flicking quickly through it.  “There’s something else I – ah yes, here we go.
you were running out of time. So desperate, so frantic, but it still takes you by surprise, the way it did that first time: Harry’s sudden gasp, the loud exhaled
he recalled as clear as day: the way Harry’s fingers had curled around his neck, eyelids fluttering shut as he kissed Draco with such a depth of feeling it made Draco ache. If only he could see Harry somehow, just once, he might remember what exactly his feelings
Draco exhaled, his breath long and slow. It couldn’t be anything other than an invitation, and Draco felt lightheaded with how badly he wanted it. With how badly
-ing was driving Draco to distraction. He’d briefly considered floating the idea of a ban during working hours but dismissed it almost immediately as a pointless endeavour.
Once Neville had left, Draco wandered down to his lab. He spent the evening working on some Diploma potions and waiting for the
Draco made a vague noise of agreement, and Harry leant back slightly. “Look, Draco, please – I don’t want to hurt you. I won’t avoid you anymore, but I don’t want you getting your hopes up. I’d like us to be friends, but I really don’t want to leave you thinking that this is going to turn into something… more.”
Malfoy leant forward, curling a hand around Harry’s bicep, his voice low and confiding. “Yes, Potter, your numbing charms. I know they don’t pick you guys for your brains, but
He’s on his tiptoes, dangerously far over the edge. Ropes of silver hair whip cruelly back and forth as he leans out into the dark, and you can't help but hurry over. Your breath comes too fast; little clouds in the freezing air betraying your alarm. It takes every ounce of your self-control not to grab his arm, tug him back from the edge. Not to tug him into you.
to excite him. He tried shagging in more risky places – alleyways, bus stops, even out on the street – but of course he didn’t
Draco’s heart sank. It made sense, he realised. Obviously, it would be too much for Harry, to be back here – back in the place where he’d discovered Draco’s betrayal, where he’d sat by Draco’s bedside and nursed him through his illness, where he’d kissed Draco for what he’d believed was the very last time. But this – his little flat, over his little shop – this was Draco’s home, his comfort, his world.
Sweat was gathering at the nape of his neck, and he clawed at his robes, tugging them loose, feeling his throat work as he swallowed again and again.
hard work. It was sad, really – barely an hour in a room together and it was as though they’d never been friends.
The morning’s mist had thickened into a dense fog by the time they sat at the table Itti had prepared – laid out neatly with
“Thank you, really,” Harry says, suddenly serious. “It does mean a lot to me. It’s going to be a tough night. I need you there, Draco.”
Draco slept heavily. The morning light didn’t disturb him, nor the usual daytime noises as life continued, heedless, outside. His eyelids barely even flickered when Mrs Gibson’s Kneazle ended up in a noisy fight with a stray, just as dusk was falling. In the end, it was the harsh yellow glare from the streetlight that woke him, stinging his eyes as it streamed unrelentingly past the half-open curtains. He rolled over, stomach lurching, vague memories of the early hours’ events flashing before him. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and when he wet his lips, the taste of sour Firewhisky made him retch. He dragged himself out of bed to the bathroom, where he emptied the bitter contents of his stomach straight down the loo.
wanted Draco to acknowledge her approval, to thank her, but he tried to ignore it. Her attitude still irked him.
They fall silent once more. Draco’s expression is shuttered, inscrutable, as he stares at their old front door; Harry well remembers what that means.
“No, not that, exactly. It’s just, say, take Ron. I think he spent his whole childhood watching from stands like this, wishing he was elsewhere. These days, he likes to be right in the action, the crowd around him, you know―”
But with a few simple adjustments here and there – Draco stopped asking her to clean the lab, and he started unpacking the Occamy egg deliveries himself – they were back on track. Lee made his whole life
Harry snorted. “Yeah, right. Look, c’mere.” Harry eased himself down until he was kneeling opposite Draco. He put his other hand on Draco’s other shoulder, nudging Draco’s chin up until Draco met his gaze again. “Deep breaths. Do it with me, come on. In… and out…”
reason; something which Harry never let himself think about these days: from the very start, they’d kept their relationship – and then, by extension, the existence of their flat – private.
“Was that… was that what you meant to do?” asked Harry carefully, voice shaky with suppressed mirth.
Draco’s head snapped towards the bathroom; watched the handle turn. He held his breath as the door swung open, in slow motion, towards him.
. She’s going to kill me. No, she’s going to shag me regardless, and my knob will probably fall off.”
. I needed time to see that you could get your shit together, you know? Stay sober, get the business back on track, learn to deal with things without going back to the
“You’ll be the death of me one day, Draco,” Harry said, with a hoarse chuckle. “But you’re probably right. I don’t want to rush into things, either.” He inhaled sharply, reluctantly withdrawing his fingers, bringing his hand back down to rest on Draco’s other thigh. “So, what now?”
“They were definitely over here, I saw them!” The voice echoing between the trees was indisputably Ron’s, and Harry groaned in frustration as they pulled apart. Harry rolled off the pile of leaves, scrabbling desperately to get to his feet. He pulled Malfoy up alongside him, the both of them frantically brushing down their uniforms and running shaking fingers through their hair. As the voices drew closer, Harry shifted to stand behind a small bush, noting with amusement the way Malfoy – cheeks still flushed scarlet – was attempting to position his broom in front of his own crotch.
Determined to avoid asking about the conversation with Lee, he racked his brain for a good alternative. “How’s work?”
he’d find this new Malfoy, with his bizarre American-hybrid accent, his terrible sweet tooth, and his soft, floppy hair. Harry had always pictured the Unspeakables as sort of human Nundus, stalking around the place silently until they were ready to move in for the kill. Malfoy, on the other hand, felt more like a de-clawed Kneazle. He flirted shamelessly with anyone who moved, referred openly to Kingsley as ‘Old Shackles’, and staged loud and dramatic retellings of his MACUSA exploits in the cafeteria, which always seemed to end with “…and you’re not gonna believe what happened next! He
“Neville invited her too tonight, you know, but she had a date. Some Ravenclaw who works at Gringotts. Met him the other day – far too cocky, if you ask me.”
“Potter, I… I’m – thank you, but… I can’t. Work’s too busy right now. I’ll let you know if anything changes,” he ended, lamely.
The Cannons’ next home match was two weeks away, Draco realised, spotting a flashing schedule on the stadium wall as he wandered miserably to the Apparition point. He felt more confused now than he had before the game. He thought about Harry, the way he’d reacted when he’d spotted Draco – his almost-laugh. Later, that big open smile. But he also saw Harry’s expression when Draco had asked him to get a drink; the way he’d headed off any attempt at conversation, face shuttered.
Harry took a deep breath. “I was there, at your trial. The whole thing, I mean, including the interrogation.”
“Worked, didn’t it?” said Harry, smiling as he unhooked his trousers from his ankles, before letting Draco haul him to his feet. He pulled up his boxers almost coyly – Draco noted with amusement that they were a novelty pair, with two tiny Quidditch players chasing a Golden Snitch around the outline of his softening cock – and waved his hand, cleaning the mess from both their chests.
set out to ruin my already non-existent love life. Of course, that hasn’t stopped them. After lunch today, I expect Neville will be my boyfriend in the papers tomorrow.” He picked up one of Draco’s tiny paring knives and casually flicked it at the chopping board, scowling when it landed on its side.
Potter himself was a different matter – those green eyes and easy smile crept into Draco’s mind all too often these days, in the bright, fragmented way that was the only way he could reflect on anything while on
Draco looked down, self-conscious. Merlin, Gryffindors didn’t half go on. If Pansy were here, she’d have jabbed him in the arm and told him to stop feeling so bloody sorry for himself. Which would have been much easier than having to listen to Neville wax philosophical about
“Look, it’s been a while, okay?” said Harry, mock-grumpily, reaching down to run his own hand over the front of Draco’s underwear, lazily tracing the outline of his cock.
Draco also felt a strange niggling sense of guilt about Slug & Jiggers, as though the fact the Aurors had raided them might somehow have been the
Yet, this time, rather than fading a little with each calming breath, the noise only seemed to be getting louder. Much louder, and closer too. Draco squeezed his eyelids shut tight, inhaling deeply once more. Bitter-tasting powder coated his tongue and entered his lungs, making him choke violently, and his eyes shot open. He barely had time to register the way the plaster was fracturing all around him before the entire wall gave way and he fell forwards into darkness.
“Any idea what was in it?” Harry asked, brushing ash from his jacket. His glasses were crooked, and his voice was croaky: a side-effect of the Ministry’s speech-distortion charms, Hermione knew. He was wearing the familiar all-black uniform of the Unspeakables, the Head of Department insignia gleaming gold at his throat.
echoed loudly through Harry’s mind. Malfoy winked, casting him a sly smile, and Harry started laughing.
Oblivious to the hidden depth behind Lee’s words, Pansy laughed and stood up, grabbing a tumbler from the side. She used a neat charm which caused ice cubes to form in the bottom and gestured around the kitchen. “Hey, Draco I’m sorry for what I said about your flat when I was here before. I think it’s actually kind of charming.”
, Draco had once heard a lecherous old wizard mutter – Draco had grown up watching wizards and witches alike cosy up to her, captivated by her delicate grace. The pitiful death of her husband, not to mention the family’s sudden, brutal fall from favour had been hard on her certainly – had dulled the sparkle in those ice-blue eyes, left her quick wit and warm laugh a distant memory. But her allure had remained – in some ways increased by the quiet, detached sort of dignity with which she began to carry herself.
Hannah then – his potions knowledge would surely help them to find the right drugs, get him through this and off the potions once and for all. He’d be able to think more clearly, to explain himself better. And besides, nothing but
. The very foundation of your relationship. Can’t you see why he’s reluctant to put himself through that again?”
“Well, so long as you’re sure.” Lee observed him a moment longer, before checking her watch. She glanced around nervously. “Five minutes, then. God, there are a lot of people here. Hermione warned me that there would be, but… wow.”
Their cocks slid together easily, deliciously, as Harry pressed his face into Draco’s shoulder, and Draco curled an arm around his back, holding him close. He reached down, dipping one finger in between Harry’s cheeks, listening closely for the hitches in his breath – all the little tells he’d learned – and basking in Harry’s whispered encouragement –
have was spent obsessing over Harry; when he might see him again and what he would say when he did. Should he thank him, apologise to him, or kiss him? Draco’s decision changed day by day. His memory of his time on
Much of the time was spent discussing the plants, which were flourishing despite the neglect of the past few years. Draco made note of several which would be useful for potions ingredients and encouraged his mother when she expressed an interest in taking up gardening again. Altogether, the morning passed quite pleasantly, and for the first time in months, they ate lunch together outside. When he was done, Draco stared up at the clear blue skies, and was surprised to find his thoughts turning to Quidditch. He spent the afternoon racing around the estate on his old Nimbus, chasing a practice Snitch until the sky grew dark around him. He returned to the house, his body aching, completely exhilarated.
For @drarrymicrofic 's prompt 'satisfied', have my take on a classic Drarry trope, with a wee bit of Ginsy thrown into the mix <3
It was a far more relaxed Draco who Apparated out to Hyde Park the following Sunday, feeling alive at the promise of another adrenaline rush, mind and body eager to loop effortlessly through cloudless skies. The previous week’s match had been amazing. Despite his nerves, and even without
It felt like an opening, like friendship; maybe the start of something new. All at once, the crowd seemed to surround him, their chants lifting him up and out of his seat. For the first time, he cheered each goal along with them, Harry’s looks of pleased surprise bringing a flush to his cheeks, the frequent press of Harry’s arm against Draco’s own like a rope to a drowning man.
!” For enormous silver reptilian feet had indeed sprouted at each corner of the now hideously mauve-coloured tub. As Draco peered closer, the menacing-looking talons clacked disconcertingly against the tiles below, making him jump.
Draco’s head snapped around in time to see Harry, his smile echoing Hannah’s own, sweep her up into an enormous hug. “I did! Sorry I’m late – you look gorgeous by the way, Han. Congratulations again. Neville’s a lucky man.”
“But not much?” Draco inclined his head, nervously, as Harry continued. “So what I don’t understand is why you tried so hard to track me down. Why keep looking for me? Why bother sitting through all those Quidditch matches with someone you hardly knew?”
been a long time, after all – but there had to be a limit. As Harry’s grinding motions continued, Draco managed to work a hand down between them, fumbling at his own trousers. He bit his lip, managing somehow to undo first his flies, then Harry’s too, exhaling as the buttons finally gave way.
“Christ, Draco, it’s freezing in here. I don’t know how you cope.” Harry’s eyes are twinkling in the firelight as he turns towards him. Draco tries to hide his joy; the way his heart has taken up residence in his throat, the way his body starts to shift, automatically, to accommodate Harry in his bed.
Harry was easy to find, over by the head table, handsome and impressive once again in those damn formal robes. He was frowning, hands clasped smartly behind his back, apparently deep in serious conversation with a group of Ministry officials. Elsewhere, Draco spied Neville and Hannah whirling clumsily but enthusiastically around the dance floor, and a familiar bushy brown head of hair amongst a crowd laughing over by the bar.
away from him in disgust. It smashed instantly into the wall, at the exact same spot where Draco had held Harry – had slowly taken him apart – earlier that evening. A lifetime ago. Thick liquid gold dripped down to join the fragments of glass which glittered dangerously atop Draco’s torn dress robes.
Harry backed away several paces, throwing his hands up in despair. “The Quidditch? The fucking Quidditch?! Look, Draco, what did you think would
was. Before things could escalate further, Draco stepped out of the lab, pulling his goggles off his forehead. “Pansy fucking Parkinson! What do you think you’re doing, terrorising my business partner?”
Despite the chill in the air, the narrow street was filled with people milling about – fit young men in tight v-neck tops with perfectly coiffed hair mingling comfortably with scruffy bearded guys in jeans and trainers. There were topless boys covered in glitter, drunken couples pressed up against shop fronts – leather and latex, lipstick and heels, singing and dancing, fighting and fucking – and layered over it all, a loud, disorienting mix of bouncy upbeat music and frantic pounding beats. Draco had heard the older students at Hogwarts talking about clubbing, had vague images in his head of packed dance floors and strobe lighting, but this – this cacophony, this vibrant, roaring,
Potter pulled out parchment and quill, brushing past Draco to lean on the counter. Draco, acutely aware of their sudden proximity, stepped backwards much too fast. He bumped into a shelf full of newt eyes which wobbled dangerously – eyeballs rolling around in their jars – and he spun around, throwing his arms out to steady it. Behind him, Potter snorted. Draco turned back around to find Potter thrusting the parchment towards him, a knowing look in his eyes. “There.”
Harry leant in, feeling bold, letting his lips hover close to Malfoy’s ear. “Come home with me,” he whispered.
“Really?” Harry muttered, sarcastically. Draco dug his nails into Harry’s side then, making him squirm. Water splashed noisily up the side of the bath, and they both laughed, the tension finally beginning to dissipate.
about this situation. Take Lofts, for example: Harry’s Auror partner of three years hardly looked up when Harry threw her a cheery wave. And Shah, normally the life and soul – he actually
the bouncers to let him straight in without Muggle identification was definitely more trouble than it was worth for a drink and a quick hand job.
– Harry didn’t gaze at him with that silly, adoring, heart-stopping smile plastered across his face. Back then, Harry didn’t let his hand brush innocently against Draco’s arse whenever he walked behind him, and he didn’t finish off Draco’s sentences with innuendo and a wink. And even if he had, of course, Draco wouldn’t have been able to flirt back. Not back then.
“Ha.” Harry turned away, wandering towards the glow of the bushes. He passed his fingers in front of the tiny flames, watching as their tips followed the movement. “New York was… very cold. Too much political posturing, too little actual training, as expected.” One of the flames darted out to lick against his skin, and he pulled his hand away with a hiss. “The food was great, though. Saw a bit of the nightlife. And I did manage to catch a Quidditch match.”
But hours later, Draco still couldn’t settle. He found himself grinding his teeth: keyed-up, overexcited, his brain replaying the events of the evening over and over. His body, too, was restless and tingling with adrenaline – there were pins-and-needles in his calves and the sensation of blunt fingernails running up and down his sides. Harry’s arm across his chest was heavy – no longer soothing but suffocating. Draco tried twisting gradually until he was facing away, but Harry’s body followed him instinctively, making his claustrophobia even worse.
Harry frowned. Malfoy’s words made an awful lot of sense, he thought, as he continued his vain attempts to settle his aching backside into a semi-comfortable position – didn’t the Firebolt Supreme have a cushioning charm, for Merlin’s sake? – but well, how could he be certain? It
No sooner had he left, Draco still staring like a fool in his wake, than the lab door opened, and Lee’s excited voice cut into his thoughts.
dark – always was, he realises, lit by its single, humming, ceiling lamp. It’s so dark that the estate agent is frowning, fumbling desperately for the keys inside his bag, nevertheless managing to keep up a continuous spiel about the electricity meter, service charges and ground rent – whatever
“Amongst other things, yes. She told me you could barely recall anything from back then – not until the two of you worked on it, anyway. She seemed to think you’d been deliberately suppressing the memories; said reliving them was very painful for you.”
, and a familiar metallic whiff invaded Draco’s nostrils. An endless corridor stretched off to the left, with enormous doors all along it – the harsh white light of anti-magic barriers seeped from the cracks around them. Draco had a swooping feeling of revulsion as he realised where they were, stopping dead in place. Lee wobbled on her heels as he tugged her back.
“Well, last time we really talked, at Neville’s, you said―” He broke off, glancing up at the windows above; his voice when he spoke again low and urgent. “You said you still wanted me.”
arranging his mouth into a welcoming smile. But Harry wasn’t smiling back. In fact, he was looking deeply annoyed, and – Draco felt a pang of guilt – as though he hadn’t slept a wink. Tired eyes darted over Draco’s face, curiously at first, before narrowing in suspicion.
As he tried to take it all in, Lee emerged from the lab. She paused mid-song as she saw Draco standing in the centre of the floor but recovered as soon as he turned towards her. She tossed her head back and pressed her lips together tightly as she stomped past him to angrily flick the little switch that manually unlocked the front door and released the wards.
“Oh, Potter, don’t feel sorry for me, it all worked out for the best. God, I loved New York,” he said with a wink, “and she loved me back. Plus, y’know, the country is fucking massive – and they’ve got some really weird shit going on, let me tell you – so you’re sent all over the place. I basically ended up visiting almost every state, on MACUSA’s dime. There’s none of that academic ivory tower ‘ooh, Department of Mysteries’ bullshit you get round here, and way less red tape. Most of us were out in the field, actually getting to
right there? I can’t get my head round it. You must have known that, if you’d asked, I would have taken you to mine. It all just feels… uncharacteristically reckless, I suppose.”
“Look, I also wanted to apologise for Max. He’s a total prick, and he’s hated me ever since I started as an Auror. Before that, he used to head up all the prisoner interrogations―”
“…not training to be one of those Muggle butcher-Healers, so I don’t even see why it matters.” Draco finishes with a sigh.
As the initial commotion died down, a hush settled over the room. Draco glanced up, hopefully, expecting the offer of a helping hand to get back up. None was forthcoming, although plenty of interested partygoers had gathered around, sneering amusement on their faces. The tree trunk was twisting on his lap, warping and shifting into a gnarled, unpleasant looking thing. With an enormous shove, Draco managed to right the pot. As he clambered to his feet, dusting himself off, he could feel dozens of pairs of eyes on him, but he couldn’t detect a single friendly face. The mana-tree was shivering now, its buds shrivelling and darkening, a few dropping to the floor as Draco levitated it quickly over to the corner. Hostile murmurings (
, you know?” He looked at his hands. “Anyway, apparently, I have the same resistance to other persuasive spells and potions too. I found it out the first week I started Auror training. This nutty witch slipped some Amortentia into a bottle of whisky I was sharing with Gawain and Kingsley. The two of them went loopy, but I just felt a little fuzzy around the edges.”
Potter pointed his wand at a beautiful old gramophone – almost an exact replica of Draco’s mother’s own, would you believe? – and the music began to drift, smooth and crystal-clear, through the air: a traditional Pureblood tune. Draco bowed, taking Potter’s arm, leading them gracefully around the room. That had been another wonderful surprise: Potter’s incredible skill at dancing. The man had been holding out at the Yule Ball, that much was for sure.
as though he hadn’t a care in the world. What a stupid idea it had been to put himself directly in harm’s way, after he’d been so careful for so long.
back up and replaced it where he’d found it. He pointedly didn’t look at it again all morning, and when he popped his head into the breakfast room that afternoon – no particular reason, really – the paper was already gone.
He lay on the floor, watching the swinging cabinet door and trying desperately – against his body’s wishes – to cling to consciousness. He rolled the vial between his fingers, focusing on the way he could feel its centre of gravity change as the liquid sloshed around inside.
Just before Neville stepped into the Floo that afternoon, struggling to carry one of the larger textbooks from Draco’s extensive collection, he turned and extended his hand. Draco took it.
“And if it is? What the hell do you know about friendship? While you were off on your jolly around Europe, agonising over your
What did Pansy know? Draco was a different person these days. He had friends, they cared about him, and there was no reason to think they wouldn’t still be his friends when he stopped taking the
“Play nice, Ron,” said Harry, drawing Draco in for a loose hug. He smelled clean and familiar; candle smoke in his hair and red wine on his breath. The warmth and proximity made Draco dizzy.
“Being a bit of a snob?” She laughed, squeezing his arm. “Don’t worry about it. I know what you meant. I don’t think you’re prejudiced.”
Honestly, picking up was so easy that it had lost most of its initial thrill. Draco knew he could just walk into any bar and within minutes he’d have his choice of several men. Frankly, he might as well be at home, having a wank. He needed
“I think I mentioned I’d started seeing Hannah – Hannah Abbott, you remember, from school?” Draco didn’t really remember, but indicated that Neville should continue. “I probably told you, she’s a trainee Healer now, works at St Mungo’s. Anyway, I saw Harry last week – Harry Potter, you know,” he added in a totally unnecessary aside, “and he was still all depressed about breaking up with Ginny. Asked if Hannah had any friends I could set him up with, you know, help him get back on the horse?”
Crowson cocked his head, mouth twisting up into a mocking smile. “Strange, that’s definitely what I heard.”
“Seamus used to have this massive poster of her up over his bed at Hogwarts,” said Neville under his breath. “This must be killing him.”
In the middle, cases of silverware were stacked next to a large antique chest (Draco ignored the loud scratching noises coming from within), and hanging on the right-hand wall were an array of weapons: a huge golden crossbow, and several ornate daggers and longswords, with brightly-coloured jewels shimmering on their handles. But much more interesting to Draco was the rest of the room, which was lined with shelves, and behind a shimmering
Harry uncrossed his legs, then bent his knees and brought them up to his chest, defensively. Draco watched, mesmerised, as his toes sank into the duvet below.
Harry pursed his lips. “All right, then. But if I catch you lying – even one tiny half-truth – then you’ll take the Veritaserum. Agreed?”
You’re not thinking of that now, of course, because you’ve promised yourself one last glimpse, and the familiar nervous excitement is already tingling in your fingers. You unstopper the tiny vial, glass cloudy with age, pour it straight into your Pensieve and lean.
. You can’t see your younger self, but you remember exactly how he feels, chest tight underneath the fabric, terror mingling with flutters of hope, swallowing and swallowing and trying to stay upright. You watch as Harry takes hold of the wooden spatula, joining a family of four off on holiday to the

you. Then, after I – once I’d seen how things had been, I realised why.” He paused, stroking the tip of the quill feather, gathering the courage to carry on. “Look, I like you, Harry. I like you so much – so,
Neither of them spoke. The world around them narrowed. Potter’s shallow, shuddering breathing was very loud in Draco’s ears, and he leant forward, pressing closer, testing Potter’s reaction. Potter shifted in his seat, letting out a quiet sigh. The sound jolted Draco uncomfortably out of his reverie, as he remembered that his ointment should find healing tissue and sink in automatically to help bind it together. Nothing he’d read or seen before had implied that it would work better if rubbed in; the massage was entirely a
Humiliated, he allowed Hannah to lead him through an enormous set of glass doors and out into the garden.
“Fine.” He leant in to press one more quick kiss to Harry’s lips before pulling back to grab his hand, lacing their fingers together and tugging him towards the nearest Floo. Harry stumbled along behind him, awkwardly trying to adjust himself in his trousers, struggling to keep up with Draco’s relentless pace.
– offering her hand to politicians, dancing with members of the aristocracy – the old Black charm as compelling as ever.
; a view over the heath. I promise you, I’ve been doing this for years, and I’m not exaggerating when I say…”
“I should never have pushed you like that. It wasn’t my place. I wasn’t – wasn’t purely doing it out of concern, Harry. I envied you, you know, able to go out and do anything you wanted –”

The estate agent steps forwards, breaking Harry’s line of sight as he wipes a sweaty hand on his polyester trousers before thrusting it forwards. Draco makes his way slowly up the steps towards them; uncurling those familiar long, pale fingers. Harry can’t stop staring.
Draco had spent his entire life shouldering the burden of his father’s disappointment. His mother, though, had always adored and cossetted him. She’d
“Be my guest,” said Pansy, shrugging. “In fact, let’s go in dual. Maybe I’ll spot something I didn’t notice before.” She raised her wand and pointed it at Malfoy where he stood, rotating slowly on the spot, oblivious. Hermione copied her.
“Maybe later, okay? It’s just –” he indicates the carpet before him, which is barely visible now beneath pieces of parchment containing complicated drawings of body parts, textbooks open to gory pictures and coloured cards covered with Draco’s careful handwriting.
He opened his eyes: first a crack, then further, relieved to see his lamp back where it had always been: just a lamp, once more. But, Draco realised as he tried to roll over, his throat was still dry and parched, his body still dripping with sweat. He was trembling all over – exhausting, relentless shudders which refused to stop. He sat up, peering over the edge of the bed nervously, only to be met by the wide eyes of his own horrified reflection, staring up at him from a wide, silvery expanse of water. The bed was floating in it, and suddenly all became clear to Draco: he must have taken the
“Ha. You’ll have to take that up with Leonie. She’s convinced that this is going to be our big moneymaker.”
, Draco thought, as he felt his face arrange itself into a sympathetic expression. In the years he’d sat behind Neville, Draco had seen him systematically botch every single assigned potion, in every conceivable way. On one occasion, they’d evacuated the entire dungeons after Neville had inadvertently managed to unleash a lethal sentient mist by stirring his Muffling Draught in the wrong direction. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind; Neville was
Draco trusted Lee, he really did, but if there was one thing Pansy Parkinson was good at, it was extracting gossip. He lifted his head, thinking hard. “All right, all right, I’ll tell you.”
. Harry’s cock was near full hardness again now, straining up towards his stomach, bobbing between them as he rocked into Draco, moaning his own pleasure with each snap of his hips. Light from the
“So many times, Draco, I planned to Owl you, or to visit, to make it up with you, but I couldn’t… I don’t know why, but each time I put quill to parchment or started walking towards the shop, I just… something stopped me.”
“Malfoy! Malfoy, are you all right? Shit, your arm―” The blur that was Thomas came into focus, as he knelt down next to Draco, panting. With one last, desperate glance towards Potter, Draco reached over with his uninjured arm, grabbed his wand and Apparated away.
. He sighed, saddened to realise that Harry knew him better than he knew himself. Draco had lived his entire life a coward; it made sense that he would take the coward’s way out.
Draco had almost stopped listening, his thoughts running wild. Had he really heard Neville correctly? Could it be true? Harry Potter – Dark-Lord vanquisher, wholesome Auror, darling of Witch Weekly – into
Ten minutes later, they decamped to the living room. Harry sat on a sofa, thumbing through old Quidditch magazines, while Draco stuck to the margins of the room, occasionally fussing with the curtains or realigning the picture frames, trying to come up with a plan. But as the clock hands crawled slowly around, he started to feel the familiar unease rising steadily in his chest. His eyes were dry and sore, so he spelled the lamps lower, ignoring Harry’s murmured noise of protest. The smell of the carbonara seemed to be getting stronger, if anything, and Draco opened one of the windows, sticking his head out, gulping down deep breaths of fresh air.
Narcissa Black had been a mere twenty-three years old when she’d married Lucius Malfoy, and not quite twenty-five when she’d birthed her only son. Widely regarded as a rare beauty –
Then, just as quickly as they had bound him, the coils began to loosen. Unable to help himself, he gasped a long, shuddering breath in, his whole body still shaking helplessly as Nagini slithered off his bed. He could feel the imprints of her scales on his skin, even as the hissing sound faded and the smell began to dissipate.
Harry cleared his throat, scuffing his feet on the floor. His fingers curled nervously around one of the sheets. He looked surprisingly uncomfortable here, in his own home, Draco thought.
, and Draco was suddenly struck with a strong desire not to go back home to his lonely flat, where all he would do was mope around all afternoon. It was too cold out to fly, his usual method of burning off steam. So he grabbed his wand and carefully unstuck a string of bunting from the rafters, nodding gratefully at Hannah when she offered him a coffee.
As expected, the Leaky was completely packed. Someone had made a half-hearted attempt to transform its dingy interior by draping a few strings of fairy lights over the rafters; these, unfortunately, only served to highlight stains on the carpet and hex-scars dotted across the walls. In stark contrast to the shabby décor, the mood in the place was buoyant. Loud, catchy music was playing, trays of champagne glasses were hovering about the room, and excited voices sounded from all around – in particular from the far corner, where George and Ron were holding court, demonstrating their latest Wheezes bestsellers to a mesmerised crowd.
” Harry pouts but complies, dragging his feet deliberately, grinning as Draco swats him playfully on the arse all the way back out into the hall.
or keeping any larger amount was regulated and had to be registered with the Ministry. Using it to gain advantage in business also skirted the edge of legality – it was highly frowned-upon, at the very least. His reputation would never survive a second hit, and Draco knew the Ministry would jump at any opportunity to lock up the only ex-Death Eater outside of Azkaban. His original plan – to sell the

helped, Draco was fast realising that there weren’t enough hours in the day for him to complete all his orders. Although he’d played it as a positive to Pansy, the realisation he was going to have to hire additional staff was actually most unwelcome. He couldn’t even imagine what kind of person would respond to his advert. Of course, he couldn’t work with anyone he knew – anyone who might suspect him. But after less than a year and with only a Diploma to his name, he was in no position to take on a proper apprentice.
Neville still called in at the shop from time to time, but he’d moved in with Hannah now, and ever since Draco had declined the invitation to their housewarming, he could feel their friendship – a constant in his life since the Manor – beginning to fade. Draco simply wasn’t able to sustain in-depth discussions about potions and gardening the way he once had been. His concentration was shot, and
