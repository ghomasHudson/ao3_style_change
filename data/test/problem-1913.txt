“Can I hug you?” He’s not sure why he offered this, he doesn’t have much experience comforting others. He is just going off what he wishes someone would offer him when he is with the Dursleys.
He was becoming a pro at sneaking in and out of his dorm room in the still of the night, bypassing his roommates and teachers undetected. He did try to think about this fact as little as he could, the guilt of lying to his friends and family creeping up on him when he allowed his thoughts to linger too long. But he knew deep down, that this was something that was important enough to him to keep quite a little bit longer, even if it did mean lying to his closest friends. As much as he loved his chosen family, he knew they wouldn't understand.
“When would you like to go and speak with Professor Snape?” Harry asked, “That is, of course, if you would still like me to accompany you?”
He knew that he was a little early for the planned upon meeting time, but he couldn't help secretly hoping that his companion was also feeling just as impatient as he was.
Please fine somewhere else to go for the holidays as you are not welcome in our household. Provide an address within the next two weeks for your belongings or they will be disposed of promptly.
Draco blushed at the pet name. He was still getting used to the idea of someone else loving him. "You're here now" he smiled bashfully.
The first think Draco noticed when he looked back at his godfather was the anger simmering beneath his eyes. Draco was sure that the anger wasn’t directed at him, but it made him nervous anyway.
Draco complied without a complaint, moving further into the bed to allow Harry space to join him. "I came up straight from dinner, it's easier than sneaking out"
Severus raised one thin eyebrow in question but stepped aside to allow both boys to enter his living room, he led them over to sit on the couch and summoned up a tray of tea and biscuits for them.
Harry hesitates for only a moment, feeling slightly like he was invading Draco’s privacy before he begins to read the elegant scrawl on the parchment.
Harry doesn’t register that’s he’s moved until he is reaching a hand out to Draco, gripping his shoulder in a firm but gentle embrace.
Holding eye contact with him, Harry responded. “I don’t want to fight Draco, I stumbled on this place by accident and I saw you upset. I honestly just want to know if you are ok?”
He smiled and brought his hand up to run through Draco’s hair, shifting to sit up further on the wall. The movement of his body prompted the older boy into consciousness.
How is he supposed to sneak out to meet up with Draco if they wouldn’t take their eyes off him, Ron had almost followed him into the bathroom this afternoon. He couldn’t even get a message to Draco to ask for him to move it to another night, and there was no chance Harry was going to stand him up.
Dracos heartrate sped up again “only Aunt Bella, but… you know” He was hoping his godfather would understand why that was a less than desirable outcome.
“In the last letter exchange I had with my mother, she joked about me having a crush on one of the girls in my class and asked me if there was anyone I had my eye on at the time. I think they were hoping I would say I fancied Pansy or maybe one of the Greengrass sisters.”
“Draco, you’ll never know until you tell him. Are you going to keep It from him for the rest of your life? Wont your parents let something slip to him soon anyways? You need to be the one to tell him, you deserve to be part of that.”
As Draco turned to face him for one last moment, he tried to put on the most encouraging look he could muster and sent a small smile his way, Draco briefly returned it before turning to face the door. As he reached up to knock, he dropped his other hand from Harrys.
As he squeezed himself through, coming out on the other side into the room, Harry thought about what he was expecting to see when he came through. Probably a secret evil Slytherin lab, where Draco Malfoy cooks up all his nasty pranks. Or maybe a duelling club, where the Snakes are teaching themselves how to hex and curse the other unsuspecting houses.
Harry was slow to wake the next morning. The corridor was still dark from the lack of candles that most of the dungeon is lined with. Meaning Harry really had no idea that time of the day it was. From the feeling of restfulness that filled his body, he was sure he had been asleep for a could of hours at least.
He attended dinner as usual, making to not to act as if he had anything planned. He sat with his friend s and kept up a casual conversation about homework and quidditch. Not looking over at the Slytherin table once all night.
Draco’s arms had wound their way back around his waist, his grip tightened so much on his elbows that harry worried for his joints. As if he were unaware of Harry’s gaze, his body twisted until his back was leaning up against the hard stone of the wall behind them and slid downwards to the floor, seeming to fold his body in half in an attempted to appear smaller.
Draco's face softened onto a look of pure adoration. "'bout time Potter" He roused with a cheeky grin, voice heavy with sleep.
Draco shrugged, looking dejected. “I know he would take me in, but he doesn’t know about.. you know.. me” He gestured to the parchment still clasped in Harry’s hand. “I would have to tell him, and I don’t think I could handle him disowning me as well. He’s kind of all I have left.
Draco’s eyes were bouncing from Harrys face to the wall opposite them. As if he wanted to look at Harry while talking but couldn’t quite convince himself to commit to it.
Draco finally looked up “Um, no. It doesn’t involve Harry. He came with me as a friend” Snape raised both eyebrows at this, before he tried to school his features back before either boy could notice. He was surprised at both the use of Potters first name and the declaration of a friendship that Severus was sure didn’t exist a few days ago.
As he stepped over some of the larger pieces of rubble, he noticed a crack in the stone, it was hidden by a protruding rock and appears to be completely sealed until to walk right up to it.
Harry stood frozen for several long drawn out moments. He knows that he should back out of the room, sneak back up to his dorm room unheard and pretend he didn’t see anything. But he couldn’t bring himself to leave, Draco was visibly not okay, and Harry couldn’t live with himself if he walked away when someone needed help. Even if it was Malfoy.
Harry instantly felt bad, it was almost half 10 by this point, Draco had been up here by himself for hours. "Sweetheart, you should have told me. I would have come up sooner"
He has spent enough of his childhood hiding his tears, praying someone would give a damn enough about him to comfort him.
Thankfully, the common room was empty when he reached it. Even Crookshanks was missing from his usual sleeping place by the fire.
Without a word, Harry moved towards him. Resuming his hug down on the floor, doing his best to provide what little comfort he could, without really knowing what he was comforting Draco about.
Draco was quick to respond. “Of course I want you to come with me. I wouldn’t have asked if I wasn’t sure. What about tonight? Best to get it over with I guess, that way I can start making other arrangements if it falls through” Draco didn’t sound like he had much faith.
He doesn’t spend much time exploring down in the dungeons. Too scared of what might happen to him if he gets caught by a Slytherin prefect, or worse, by Snape himself. But the curiosity was killing him, he had to know!
He decided that the best way to approach the verbal whooping her was about to endure was to act as if nothing was out of the ordinary. So, he entered the hall and found his way to the spot obviously left for him beside Hermione, across from Ron. Ignoring the looks from his classmates.
One of Draco’s hands had moved to grasp at the front of Harry’s cloak, much like a child clinging to his parents for comfort might. Harry simply began to gently run his hand up and down Draco’s back.
Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes back, toeing off his slippers, nudging Draco with his knee in an attempt to get his to slide over. "How long have you been here Dray?"
“Draco?” The sound of his voice in the almost silent room reverberated off the stone. He doesn’t think he’s ever said Draco’s first name out loud before, but he knew ‘Malfoy’ or ‘ferret’ seemed inappropriate for the moment.
He hid down in the abandoned corridor in the east wing of the dungeon, knowing the only person likely to find him would be Draco. 15 minutes after dinner had finished he called for Dobby.
Draco visibly relaxed at his words and cleared his throat. His face was beginning to turn pink as his memories from the previous night resurfaced in is mind. How could he have been so stupid, to reveal all that information to Potter of all people.
Draco nodded, pulling out the letter from his pocket. He felt more secure in handing it over now, his fears and worry’s gone with the reassurance that he still had a family that loved him.
Surprisingly, Draco doesn’t pull away in disgust or insult him in any way. Instead he leans slightly towards Harry and tilts his head forward to rest on Harry’s shoulder. Harry brings both of his arms around Draco’s shoulders, tucking his head more into his neck.
In reality, what Harry found was very very different. The room is exactly what you would picture from a collapsed abandoned classroom. There was rubble and dirt covering every surface, pieced of cracked desks and other pieces of furniture scattered around the room. Draco was pacing the length of the room, his hands flying around; as if he weren’t sure what to do with them, they ran widely through his untamed hair, hugging his body in a bruising grip.
Harry took Draco into his arms. This was the whole point of meeting up with each other during the night. Allowing themselves the simple pleasure of holding each other, of talking about their days and how they're feeling. In the privacy of the room of requirement, which was honestly one of the only places the boys could go to feel 100% comfortable being unapologetically themselves.
“Good Morning?!? Harry where have you been?! You’ve been missing all morning. We’ve been looking for you everywhere, no one saw where you went!” Hermione looked a wreck, her hair was messily tied up in a bun with several pieces missed. You would think that Harry had been missing for weeks, not 12 hours.
Draco took in a shaky breath and pulled his head back from where it was resting on Harry’s collarbone. “I guess there’s no point keeping it a secret now. It’s not like you could possibly think any lower of me than you already do.”
Casting his eyes over at the alarm clock on his bedside table, Harry silently rejoiced to see the time had finally ticked over past 12:00am.
This was obviously the wrong thing to say. Hermione launched into some spiel about something or another. Harry wasn’t really listening to be honest, his attention had been drawn to a pair of electric grey/blue eyes staring at him from across the hall.
Harry prepared himself for his own response. “I have a few things to say ok? Try not to interrupt me, I need to say this.” He felt Draco nod his head from where it was buried and took that as permission to go ahead.
Harry let a small smile slip onto his face. “I’m honoured that you trust me so much, are you sure that you want me to come thought? Snape doesn’t like me very much”
Once they were out of sight, Ron could think straight again. He precariously stepped out from the relative safety of his corner and crept hesitantly to the door that had swallowed his friend, who was (no doubt) either in mortal peril or currently having a mental affliction. The door looked innocent enough, simply labelled “supply closet”, and if not for the knowledge of what was in it, Ron probably would have been able to pass it during the day without the urge to vomit. He didn't want to know, per se, but he needed to know that Harry wasn't being brutally murdered while he turned a blind eye. After all, Malfoy was still armed while Harry’s wand was foolishly in the abandoned hallway. He just needed to check-- just to be certain this elaborate seduction wasn't a trap. His mind made up, Ron held his breath and lightly pressed his ear to the door to listen for the unmistakable sounds of muffled screaming and murder.
“Can’t you see what’s happening here?” Sirius’s chair skid back, but the caterwaul was drowned out by his shouting, “He’s using you. He’s a little snit who fought on the wrong side of the war, and lost his social standing and all his money because of it. That’s what he’s really after when he tells you he loves you.”
“Aren’t you, Sirius?” Now Harry rounded on him, “If he had asked you, would you have given your blessing?”
“You always were an arrogant little brat when we were kids.” Harry’s temper was surfacing, “Don't see why it'd be any different now”.
Malfoy clears his throat awkwardly as Remus and Harry escape to the kitchen. He’s most likely distressed at being left alone with Sirius with zero witnesses and zero ways to ease the tension. Sirius can understand the sentiment.
Harry grabs Malfoy’s hand, where it dangles limply on the tablecloth. “Sirius,” Harry placates, “Draco and I are equals in our relationship, and that includes the housework.”
Meanwhile, Malfoy’s other hand ran down the length of the other boy’s body, disappearing briefly from view as it trailed down his outer thigh. It stopped at the crook of Harry’s knee, where it and the appendage it was attached to was hoisted up and around the curve of Malfoy’s hip. Harry made another sound that Ron would later be trying to scrub from his memory.
was coming to a close. Harry had obviously come to his senses, and Ron congratulated himself on his apparent persuasion ability. Thank God. Ron couldn’t imagine Malfoy sitting in the burrow for Sunday family dinner alongside Harry, but then again, Harry obviously couldn’t either. It hadn’t occurred to him that maybe Harry wasn’t interested in Malfoy permanently, that maybe it was a phase, or a fling, or he was just using him for the time being.
Instead of rapidly firing hexes, Harry’s wand, clattered to the floor in favor of freeing his fingers to thread and tug through blond hair. Malfoy’s hands were grasping Harry’s hips tight against his, and suddenly they were both gasping into the kiss.
Just as sudden as it happened, Harry removed his hands from Malfoy’s hold. ‘Finally’ Ron thought triumphantly and still vaguely horrified, 'He and I are going to have a long talk about this'. But once again, Ron’s expectations were shattered as Harry didn't push him away, but rather groped the stone wall next to him until he was grasping a door handle. The door flung outward, and Harry used his free hand and his body weight to pull the other boy inside before the door slammed shut behind the both of them.
Before they can take a step, Remus has reasserted control, “No, absolutely not. You two, sit back down. Enjoy your pudding. Sirius, you’re coming with me.”
Malfoy lifts his downturned head to smile at Harry, and intertwines their fingers. Sirius’s heart drops down to his stomach.
And then Harry was making soft keening sounds, his head tilted back and body arched as Malfoy moved his way down his throat. He was literally offering his neck to the enemy. Malfoy shifted, so that just one hand was holding Harry hostage. It was only a semblance of control, and doubtless, he could free his arms easily. Ron waited for him to break free and come to his senses, but it didn't happen. Harry, the savior, was giving in, letting himself be pinned and controlled and manhandled by his childhood rival in this bizarre night terror causing Ron's whole world to flip upside down.
“-and you always played the wimpy victim, don't see how it'd be different now”. He bit out the last part, clearly baiting him, “Pity the poor little orphan Potter”.
“You’re worrying over nothing,” a posh voice responds. It’s one that instantly starts an angry churning in Sirius’s empty stomach. “I am going to win over ol’ cousin Sirius,” the Malfoy spawn drawls, “Seventh time’s the charm.”
It’s around seven in the evening and there’s wafts of buttery mash and pot roast drifting out of the kitchen, and Sirius has never been hungrier for a dinner he wants to miss. He’s tense now, uncomfortable in his favorite armchair, yet he makes no move to get up. Just a little longer.
Where Ron expected violence, there was the exact opposite. Well, there seemed to be a bit of biting, from the looks of it, and Ron’s uselessly shellshocked mind counted that as violence.
Perhaps not, but Sirius couldn’t have thought about it, because it would be facing a reality too horrible to contemplate. He scrubbed the notion from his head, choosing to feed his righteous anger. “Well it wouldn’t have been if he’d asked me for my blessing.”
“A year ago, I didn’t know him. And if you got to know him, you wouldn’t be so opposed to the idea of me being happy.”
Ron quickly pointed his wand at the assailant, the full body bind curse on the tip of his tongue when, bewilderingly, it was he (and not Malfoy) who became totally petrified.
He’s already suffered through the obligatory “meet the parents” dinner, two holiday parties, and three game nights at which Lucius Jr. definitely cheated. Yes: Sirius can claim with 100% certainty that he hates Draco Malfoy. No one so pompous, so lacking in decency, deigned to date his--
There has been many a man that Sirius has despised over the years. There was Gerald Witters (a rude boy in primary school that had stolen his red finger paint), Peter Pettigrew (whose nefarious deeds needed no further clarification than the trial that had sent him to Azkaban), and even Lucius Malfoy (just an arsehole-slimy-two-faced-piece-of-shit that had made his formative years miserable). Sirius’s current object of malaffection was none other than the arsehole-slimy-two-faced-piece-of-shit’s son-- Draco Malfoy.
“Fine. I won’t say anything. I’m frankly not even sure how to have that conversation without vomiting.”
“Jesus, Harry. I didn’t even know you were gay,” Ron knew he sounded hurt. He didn’t care. Harry had betrayed everything they stood for, everything that was good and light and worst of all, he had hid it all from his best friend.
Indeed, Malfoy’s hands were twitching as they stood mere inches apart. It wasn't until both their faces started turning a vivid shade of puce under the soft candles of the midnight hallway that Ron knew that violence was inevitable-- but instead of the typical duel, they looked ready to resort to muggle blows. Ron, ever the perfect best mate, didn’t want to take points from Harry or his own house. So instead of intervening right away, he chose to temporarily reserve his right to claim he hadn't seen them at all. Temporarily. If the little death-eating ferret made one false move, then he'd have no choice.
When he finishes his refined bite, he turns to Remus and says, “This is absolutely delicious, thank you.”
“I wanted to have a proper dinner to announce this,” Harry glanced between Remus and Sirius nervously, “Draco and I are engaged.”
“No,” Harry turned red, “I happen to like him, so I’m sorry, but you’re just going to have to deal.”
Draco thought that was overstating things. Harry had been the one to kick up a storm, stomping around the Ministry yelling and throwing around his power as the Chosen One, but he supposed it had been Percy’s rather alarming understanding of the paperwork and all the Ministry laws and regulations that had given Harry the right leverage to demand action was taken. The fact that a Weasley had done that for Draco just because of Harry had made him extra snotty (he could admit it) but he’d had so little pride left after that final beating in his holding cell that he’d kept quiet and let a Weasley help save him.
The old Draco would have liked that, would have used it to his advantage. He would have seen a way to manipulate the students much like his father had always manipulated the people who owed him favours or had things he wanted. The old Draco would have seen that fear and seen all the ways it could bring him money, power and glory.
She didn’t question his decision, just stood up to straighten out her own clothes, picked up her bag and then held out his own. That surprised him because last he’d seen it, his bag had been lying on the floor of the charms corridor covered in his blood.
He almost missed the moment when Draco’s words went from Latin to Parseltongue from one word to the next.
He breathed slowly and steadily, counting heartbeats and breaths until slowly but surely Draco’s breathing evened out. When Harry was twelve he’d spent a night here regrowing all the bones in his arm. He’d stayed for falls during quidditch, recovered from dementor attacks and hidden here after Voldemort had whisked him away via portkey and reclaimed a body. He’d watched Ron and Hermione heal after the Ministry debacle that got Sirius killed, visited the twins more than once after one of their experiments went wrong. He knew Madam Pomfrey was good, had seen her heal plenty of injuries from ordinary maladies to the weird and wonderful accidents that happened when kids were learning magic.
Draco sniggered. He hadn’t lost his concentration though and the last of the wards came down, this one with a rather pretty opalescent shimmer that even the least sensitive of the aurors could see.
Luna waved her hand. ‘Did you know that being hungover is one of the only times you can see withering willow wasps?’
The look of compassionate understanding in Molly’s eyes spoke volumes and he got the feeling she knew more about what was between him and Draco than she let on, long before she knew the truth. Harry had clearly underestimated Ginny (wouldn’t be the first time) because she frowned once Ron had finished his explanation and said, ‘I thought they weren’t allowed to start this until he’d finished at Hogwarts?’
He was lying on the floor of a train compartment with Draco hovering over him and there was a familiar vicious snarl on the boy’s face as he opened his mouth to shout the harsh words Harry knew he deserved because he would one day get him killed. Only the words didn’t come and there was a moment of confusion because the snarl on Malfoy’s face didn’t match the soft words that were making their way into Harry’s head.
‘They are,’ Draco agreed, finding the energy to be smug when he couldn’t even focus his eyes anymore. The world was taking on a strange shade of grey. ‘I’m losing colour,’ he mused.
He’d barely had time to sink into the kiss, lips pressing against Harry’s, before there was a startled squeak and they both froze, lips parted, breath mingling in the sliver of air between them. Harry tried to pull back with an annoyed sigh, but Draco swooped back in and planted another kiss on his lips before he released his grip on Harry’s hair and turned to face whoever had discovered them.
Would they listen to his other concerns? There’d been inquiries after Harry had found Draco in his holding cell, employees of the Ministry had been fired and some arrested, but it wasn’t enough. Sooner or later, if they kept on in this way, the new Ministry would be just as bad as the old and it would be like nothing had ever changed.
Draco had always found it easy to talk about the other people in Slytherin, the ones he’d gone through all his sexual adventures with, but Crabbe and Goyle were different. He’d talked about them, but it was easier now, like a weight had been lifted once he’d openly acknowledged to Pansy that he’d treated them all like shit and used them as a means to an end.
Hermione simply rolled her eyes but chose not to respond to that, rather she asked, ‘Do you think Voldemort’s curse on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position is responsible for the decline in student numbers?’
There wasn’t much hallway left. He wasn’t sure what they’d triggered but it had blown apart more than just the floor and the wall when it had gone off. He stood at the edge of a gaping hole in the floor and glanced, first down through the hole to the floor below, and then up where the ceiling used to be. Draco could see the ceiling of the floor above had cracks in it as though it had taken considerable force despite there being an entire floor between it and the initial explosion.
And that didn’t even factor in that last they’d heard from Bill, the dragon hadn’t been doing well at all. There simply hadn’t been enough supplies on hand to properly tend to the dragon and though they were doing their best, Bill had passed on the warning that without finding the curses and bringing the wards down there was a very real chance they would have to put the beast down rather than allow it to live in such agonised misery much longer.
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t help leaning in to give Kate a whispered, ‘He is very pretty, isn’t he?’
After another questioning glance at Harry for translation, Hermione sputtered. ‘That’s not true at all!’
Draco had been mulling it over for days since they’d had it out with Hermione, and he still didn’t know what he was hoping for. A Harry without Hermione and Weasley tying him to the broken boy he used to be had flourished. Draco couldn’t take all the credit for that, and he’d never try. Luna could take credit. Molly and Arthur, Andromeda and little Teddy. Kingsley’s support and Smith’s training and time spent with his mother and all the time spent talking to a mind healer and Madam Pomfrey with her nutritional potions. Those people played a role in helping Harry heal and become who he was but Weasley and Hermione?
But watching Draco not take the opportunity to turn Harry away from Ron wasn’t something she’d expected to see.
Of course, they didn’t have much of a chance to dwell on that creepy likeness because Ron heard the words and, knowing nothing of the sentiment behind them, sneered at Draco, ‘Stay out of Harry’s head, Death Eater.’
‘I got a rough idea,’ Harry replied. He shot a spell into the air and Draco watched as it sped toward the sky only to smack directly into an unseen force and dissipate against it.
Before the conversation about Gringotts could work its way back around to just how Harry was planning on regaining access to his money (at this point he was feeling like never but Draco was absurdly optimistic – it should be noted Bill was not), a tiny, nervous looking first year approached them at the table.
‘The compulsion charm is old – twenty years, perhaps?’ Draco studied what he was seeing, cast another spell, his frown deepening. ‘There are other spells here too.’ He turned away from the portrait and looked at the other paintings. ‘Why aren’t any of them speaking? None of them look empty either.’
Draco waved a dismissive hand at this, ‘Oxford and Cambridge both have Magical colleges but they’re next to useless unless you want to spend the rest of your life in academia. We persist in being an apprenticeship-based society.’
‘We love you far too much to leave you in Azkaban, Draco Malfoy,’ Luna declared, throwing her arms around his middle and attempting to squeeze the life out of him. ‘Oh, I think I’m drunk.’
Harry nodded. He wished he’d been there. Wished he’d been there to curse those idiots right back. He wished he’d been the one to sit by Draco’s bedside. He knew Luna wouldn’t let anyone hurt Draco, she’d told him she’d sat awake for almost the whole night with him, but still, Harry should have been there.
Draco laughed, dropping a kiss on top of Luna’s head and breathing in the soft scent of her shampoo as he did, some sort of flower he’d never heard of that was almost like a rich coffee with hints of mint. As he stood and turned toward the Entrance Hall, he missed the way Weasley’s eyebrows shot up at the easy affection.
Hermione managed to compose herself long enough to say, ‘I think you took up plenty of his time too.’
‘I was planning to,’ Harry said crisply, well he’d been aiming for crisp, but he thought he might have hit petulant instead, judging from the look Robards gave him.
Draco looked at him and shook his head and he found his heart swelling at the way Harry’s shoulders slumped in relief. ‘I can’t undo this,’ he informed them, shortly and he swayed as he said it.
Hermione gave a soft laugh, probably more at the fondness she recognised in Harry’s expression than the words themselves. Ron was not amused, but he gave them both one more frown before Hermione prodded him back into focusing on his homework. He did as he was told but there was something in the frown on his face that told Harry his thoughts still weren’t really on his homework and although he could have asked, Harry let it slide. If Ron was frowning over thoughts of Draco, Harry didn’t want to know. If he was frowning over the realisation that he would be entering auror training without Harry then…well Harry wasn’t ready for that conversation either. How did he have the conversation with Ron about making the decision for his future based on what worked best for him (and Draco to a lesser extent) and that Ron had not even been a factor?
Harry wasn’t about to let that happen. He didn’t care about the Ministry about their laws and their rules. If he had to, he would take Draco away, hide them somewhere the Ministry would never find them and if they did, if they were found then he’d –
‘I hope he does,’ Hermione spoke softly with her eyes directed at her plate. ‘I still love him; I just don’t understand how he could say such hateful things about Harry. He was just so thoughtlessly cruel.’
‘Is that the window from the fifth floor charms corridor?’ she asked, studying the glass in his shoulder curiously.
She’d been the one to convince him that Harry really did want him. She’d been the one to point out it was real, even after Harry had tried to tell him. It made him smile now, that first kiss, how he’d pushed Harry away with a snarl and yelled at him.
Draco bit his lip to hide a grin. That had been a bad day for both of them, but it was hilarious looking back at it now. Harry had been a wreck that afternoon when he’d come down to Draco’s holding cell. The shadows under his eyes were enormous, something Draco had taken great pleasure in pointing out. He’d also taken joy in pointing out Harry’s clothes were a mess, his skin horribly pale and that, frankly, his hair had reached all new levels of unmanageable and that he’d be better off shaving it than attempting to fix whatever madness had occurred.
They went down to breakfast together, Harry keeping close without touching him. He was too emotionally wrung out to be annoyed about the worried looks Harry kept shooting him. He knew he looked awful, he was pale, paler than normal, his eyes puffy in a way that thankfully suggested a late night and lack of sleep rather than tears (that had been about all his spell work could achieve). It helped that he had dark circles under his eyes.
This is one of this chapters I went back and entirely rewrote months after I'd initially finished it. It probably shows. But it fits better with where this story is going and I hope you agree. Also includes a sweet Draco&Luna moment and Ginny being awesome. Because she's Ginny.
She could pretend to still hate him all she wanted but it had been months and she couldn’t help but see the changes in him, couldn’t help acknowledging that the boy who fought in a war had become a man who had grown and learnt and was changed by his experiences.
It was quite pleasurable listening to the outraged shouting and ineffective threats being shouted his way as he walked into the Great Hall with Harry by his side. He didn’t even put up more than a token protest when Harry followed him to the Slytherin table, taking the seat across from him while Luna sat beside him. It was a little hard to protest with his feet tangled with Harry’s beneath the table and Luna telling them all about the trip she and her father were planning for their Christmas holidays.
There’d been orders and instructions and more spellwork than Harry really understood, and he could freely admit that most of that night was a blur – he was happy to keep it that way. He’d fallen asleep on the floor, propped up against the side of Draco’s bed, wand clutched tightly in his hand, guarding his childhood nemesis from people who were supposed to be good, who were supposed to be better.
Draco considered her question. She wasn’t the first person to ask him about his career options. Obviously, that had been Snape as his head of house back in fifth year – the answer then had been something purely academic and somewhat lazy as he’d been a rich coward back then. Hermione was the first person to ask him about the curse breaking without seeming to think he owed the Ministry his time.
And then she learned what it was Draco had been doing while she and Ron had been in Australia. Three months in Azkaban. How he’d nearly died in a holding cell at the Ministry at the hands of aurors. How Harry had been to visit him every single day he was in Azkaban and spent time with him when he was out.
Draco, who had been smart enough not to waste his time in a stuffy tower with the barmy seer, had never had cause to set foot in the centaur’s ground floor classroom. ‘Better than forcing eleven-year-olds to stay up until past one just to learn the constellations.’
It wasn’t a quick journey down to his inherited vaults and by the time they’d reached the depths of the cavern and the Black heirloom vault Harry had gotten over his annoyance at Ron and was starting to feel a little bit of worry over how his best mate would feel once they’d started the arduous task of sorting through centuries worth of priceless junk just so that Harry could find the last piece of Draco’s bloody Christmas gift.
The way the two were smiling and sitting up so straight made Draco think of an eager puppy waiting on its owner. It wasn’t an especially nice thought, but it was accurate. Draco at least had the decorum and self-respect to not show just how happy he was to see Harry back at Hogwarts.
‘This place is a death trap. The fields are mined, the plants are deadly. There’s no clear pathway. We’re with the dragon.’
He found Harriet beneath a desk. The legs had collapsed under the weight of the stone that had been blasted into the room. If he’d only looked at her face, he might have thought her merely asleep, perhaps he’d have thought her perfectly unharmed. But she was stuck under a chunk of floor that had pressed her beneath one of the desks and her breathing was uneven, coming in pained gasps that sounded wet. Removing the desk seemed like a priority but he didn’t know what sort of damage lifting that sort of pressure would do.
‘You two made the front page,’ she told them and there was something in her tone of voice, something in the way she looked between the two of them that had Draco looking down sharply, alarm tightening his mouth.

He’d always assumed before the war, when he was still a stupid impressionable and naïve kid, that he’d grow up to be a recognisable face simply because he was a Malfoy and Malfoy’s were powerful and influential and that meant most people would see his hair and maybe his face and know that he was the Malfoy heir.
Harry very purposefully didn’t look at Ron as he explained. ‘We don’t need half a dozen vaults between us.’ He looked further into the depths of the heirloom vault, squinting into shadowy corners that probably held things waiting to chew on him. ‘We could probably put all the jewellery and art into a single vault and we’re both of age now, so we have access to our family vaults not just the trust ones anymore. Honestly, it would be nice to have one vault just so I don’t have to keep reading through all the paperwork the goblins send me.’
The boy wasn’t showing any signs of being shy now that he had his confirmation. He took Harry’s hand, looking positively delighted by such an adult exchange and fessed up his name like it was some sort of secret.
‘Oh, get back here,’ he snapped. Once the girl had spun back around with a startled “eep” and taken a few steps back toward Draco and the table, he said, ‘What’s your name?’
Draco blinked, still not understanding. But Hermione sat up straight her eyes wide. ‘Can we do that?’ she asked, and the question was directed at a still clueless Draco.
Harry was taken aback – how had that story even reached beyond Hogwarts? – but before he could sputter out some sort of response, Draco was there crouching beside him. ‘He did,’ Draco assured them, offering a soft smile. ‘And he saved all of Hogwarts in doing so.’
Hermione flailed a bit at that, how was she supposed to tell him he would always be enough? What was she supposed to say to convince him that had never been their problem when they were on such rocky ground?
‘It’s my wand!’ he protested and then, because he seemed to think it was explanation enough, he cried, ‘He’s a Death Eater.’
Harry glanced at him and Draco winked at him over the rim of his mug. Harry might have taken his hand, but Draco had both firmly wrapped around his tea, allowing the hot contents to warm his hands. Draco’s mother would have been horrified to know both of his elbows rested on the table (Kreacher had already given him a disapproving glare). Harry had to settle for wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist and drawing him tight against his side.
In this case, though, first in the line of fire meant deliberately triggering whatever curse or spell had taken out Marigold before even stepping across the boundary. Harry did the honours, transfiguring a rock he’d picked up into a dog as Draco had once seen Cedric Diggory do, and sent the animated (though non-sentient) rock through the boundary to trample across whatever trigger there might be.
There’d certainly been enough of them who were likely even now settling into their own beds and thinking they’d gotten away with murder.
Because that’s what it felt like, Harry could see that now. When he was back at Hogwarts, he didn’t have to think about the Dursley’s and just how horrible things were, but Ron and Hermione didn’t either. He shouldn’t be hurt or mad or even angry at them for not asking questions because they were just kids. But he was. He’d had time now, to think about things, to actually feel it all, and he was struggling to understand how he could have gone so many years with no one stepping in to help. With no one asking questions.
Sleep and nurse his hurts because so much of his dreams had been based off pointless what-ifs – not the fun kind he and Draco joked about – but it hadn’t all been a lie.
Weasley tried to defend himself but gave it up as a lost cause. Which was definitely for the best, Draco was in no mood to entertain Weasley extending an olive branch. His head still hurt far too much for that sort of change to the status quo.
That was one of the arguments Draco had tried to use. Harry hadn’t listened then and he didn’t want to listen now, but again, Robards wasn’t finished.
Hermione looked horrified, even Ron looked taken aback, possibly by the anger in Harry’s voice as he didn’t expect him to be concerned for Draco. Neither of them even knew just how bad it could get, but Harry was sure that was something else Draco didn’t want getting out. He didn’t like it, hated it even, that the Ministry could use him in such a way, but Draco still felt so guilty. He still had so much he wanted to make up for and he saw this as one opportunity to help erase some of the darkness Voldemort had put out there. Some of the darkness he felt he’d put out there.
When he finally had his boots and jeans off, he joined Draco in the shower, both of them scrubbing away at the slime which revealed tender pink skin as it sluiced away. Harry found two more burns he hadn’t even known he had, one on the back of his thigh and another on his hip where the slime had (seriously – how?) gotten beneath his t-shirt.
And it was deeply satisfying to see the look on Ginny Potter’s face as her husband raised his hands and shoved her forcefully from the circle just a moment before the final ward snapped into place closing himself and Draco in a tight circle of magic that couldn’t be stopped.
Harry seemed to notice the look of horror that overtook Draco’s face and pulled himself back from memory lane. “What I mean by all of this is, I understand what it like to not be wanted by your family for something you cant control, to wish desperately for a normal family who would love you unconditionally. I’m not going to exploit that for ‘fun’”
Harry was silent as he snuck out of the Gryffindor common room, the absolute last thing he needed was to get caught by one of his classmates or teachers. He knew that he would never be able to explain himself, he sure was an awful liar for the saviour of the wizarding world.
Covering himself with the invisibility cloak as he exited the dorms, He whispered a Quiet “Mischief Manage” and set of on his journey downwards towards the dungeons, watching the map for any unwanted visitors on his path.
“Draco, are you ok?” He didn’t know how to best approach this situation, he didn’t feel it was his place to pry, but he couldn’t do nothing.
As they waited for Snape to answer his door, the time seemed to stretch on for hours, but in reality it was probably only a few minutes.
Harry considered him for a moment, lost in his own thoughts. Draco had been very brave tonight; he has opened up to Harry. Maybe it was time for Harry to return the sentiment.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes. “No, you’re not. You don’t have to tell my anything, but I can see that you’re not ok”
“Plus, it would be hypocritical of my to be upset that your affections lean more towards men” His smirk returned as he waited for Draco to understand.
“Yes actually, I needed to tell you something, but I’m worried about how you might react, you see. Harry said he would come with me”
“Number 2, your parents are absolute idiots. They are going to miss out on so much of your life because they can’t get past the bigoted views they were taught in the past, and there isn’t anything you could have done to change how they reacted, this is on them. You don’t need people like that governing your live either.”
Even from their entwined positions Harry could see the red that spread across his pale cheeks. "Yeah" He replied meekly as if worried about Harrys reaction.
“What do you know of my life outside of the walls of Hogwarts? I know there are always rumours floating around but nobody will ever tell them to me”
“Draco, look at me please” Draco slowly opened his eyes, tensely sitting with his hand still firmly grasping Harrys
Harry drew all the strength in his core not to look back towards the Slytherin table. He could practically feel Draco smirking at him for being chewed by Hermione, but he wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of looking. He would just have to wait for tonight
Severus was beginning to become worried about what could possibly be bothering his godson so much that he felt he couldn’t come to him alone in fear of how he would react. “You have no reason to be afraid of me Draco. Whatever it is that you wanted to tell me, you can. Even if I am unhappy with what you say, you have nothing to fear”
They sat together in silence for several long minutes, enjoying the presence of the other. Neither boy had felt comfort like this from another person in a long time. Harry being the one to break the silence this time.
“I hate that I don’t know what they’re more upset about. Was it the fact that I prefer boys or the specific you that I have a crush on?!”
“I don’t think less of you for being upset Draco. We might not have been the best of friends in the past but even I can see that you are a good person underneath that hard exterior you put up. You’re a good friend to the people you care about.”
Just as Dinner was concluding, Harry excused himself from the table to go to the bathroom, casting a reassuring glace at his friends when they sent him a look of worry. He felt guilty, but he would make it up to them, he couldn’t let Draco down. This may be his only chance to get away without a face to face confrontation.
Harry lent further back into the wall, allowing Draco a moment of comfort as he thought of the conversations, he was soon to be apart of.
They stand for several long minutes in silence, even after Draco’s tears have stopped. Finding a moment of peace in the silence.
Snape continued “Dragon, who you are attracted to has little effect on my perception of you. As long as you remain the loyal and kind boy i have watched you grow into, then you can date whoever you want to. With my approval of course” Snape snuck a smirk at Draco, reaching out a hand to lay on the boy’s shoulder.
Harry schooled his expression into one of indifference. Really, he found himself not being very shocked at all. He wouldn’t have guessed it but now that Draco has said it himself it seemed like it should have been very obvious.
There was no reply for some time, Harry was beginning to believe that he had fallen back asleep when he finally spoke up "I love you Harry"
A pout appeared on his face, his legs tightening where they were wrapped around Harry's own. "Not my fault. Someone hasn't paid attention to me all day!"
Harry thought he sounded crazy, there was very little doubt in his mind that the professor would do absolutely anything to protect his godson.
Harry was saddened by the cut off of their contact but again, he understood. He couldn’t even begin to imagine how nervous the blonde beside him was.
He lay still with his eyes closed for several minted longer, savouring the feeling of warmth and comfort radiating from the body he held in his arms. With drawn out, sleepy movements Harry opened his eyes and turned his head to look at the blonde hair resting against his shoulder and chest.
Harry kept his grip tight, not pulling back as he answered. “It sounds very personal. It isn’t my place to pry for more information”
Harry finished by looking back at Draco and was shocked to see fresh tears running down the blonde’s cheeks. These tears were different though. They weren’t for himself; these were for Harry and for everything that he had to go through. Draco launched himself back at the green-eyed boy, knocking them both of balance. They lay hugging on the floor of the dusty corridor, taking comfort that neither boy had been privilege to before.
“Draco, we need to get up soon. I don’t know what time it is or how long we’ve been down here. But someone has surely noticed we’re gone by now.”
Harry reread the letter several time, just to give himself a moment to think. This is not what he had expected from the big night of exploring that he had planned. His eyes flickered back to the form in front of him.
“Ok then” Harry decided “lets meet back here at lights out tonight and we can walk down to his office together?”
As he approached the collapsed hallway movement on the map drew his attention. A single set of footprints were pacing back and forth in the sealed room, the names that was attached to them almost made Harry turned back instantly.
“I came to be alone. Instead, I have the awful luck of finding you. Here. Asleep and freezing in my favourite hiding place.”
He traced the Deathly Hallows onto the fabric covering the stand with his forefinger, drawing the resurrection stone last. An eternal loop of life and death seemed fitting to Harry. It described his life perfectly.
Draco held his breath as Harry gingerly tugged his shirt off. A jagged scar ran over Harry’s chest. It looked less like a lightning bolt and more like someone had torn him in two and sewn him back together from one armpit to the other. It cut Harry’s heart in half on its way with small veins sparking across it in every direction.
“Gee, I don’t know, Potter, how about an explanation of how the Great and Good Harry Potter came to find himself alone and about to get hypothermia in a secret passageway. Don’t you think the Weasel and his clan would-“
Harry ducked into a passageway, letting the wall close behind him. He sagged against the cool brick, and let himself fall to the floor. All of his energy seemed to drain from him in that very moment because he no longer wanted to go outside. The dread kept creeping in. It’s spindly talons dug into his brain with a vice-like grip and wouldn’t let go. Every time he tried to take a step forward, the claws would violently rip him back to the war. Back to the tent and the battles and the lives lost. He couldn’t move on.
Harry levered himself off the bed away from Draco. His hands shook as he concentrated on keeping his breathing steady.
“Little rain never hurt,” Harry tried to pull them back out into the street, but Draco circled his arm around Harry’s chest and pulled him close to him.
Death and destruction had taken everyone, but somehow he was still alive. Him and his duty to fight for those who died, to protect their legacy. If there was a reason for that, he was getting tired of waiting for it.
“My father commanded respect, Harry. It wasn’t all you. Mother, though, she was a genius,” Harry felt the words like a punch to his gut. Narcissa had saved him after he had done that to her son.
Ghosts idled around every corner of the Great Hall. Harry flinched away from the first years. Hermione and Ron were curled into each other across from him at the Gryffindor table while Ginny sat stiffly next to him, neither quite sure what they should be doing. They didn’t have each other, not in the way they had wanted to so long ago, but they had their grief. Shared but not halved. An inescapable bond tied in a neat little bow of guilt and duty. They didn’t hate each other, but they didn’t fit together anymore. Harry’s jagged edges and torn corners grated against Ginny’s own tattered pieces until they set alight and left only the ashes in their wake.
The vicious smile on Joseph’s face faltered imperceptibly as he beckoned Harry to the front of the classroom. Draco exchanged a wry look with Harry as he started toward the front of the classroom. Poor Joseph had really chosen the wrong student and the wrong class to try and make his point.
‘No,’ Harry said firmly, grabbing hold of Draco’s arm to still him and staring hard at McGonagall. ‘He can’t.’
‘Salazar you’re serious,’ Pansy said when the silence stretched and he didn’t crack a smile and laugh it off.
detailing the sweeping changes Smith and Kingsley had been working toward at the Ministry. Granger was fascinated by the moves the Ministry was making in the post-Voldemort world, Draco was just impressed the woman who wrote the article seemed to know what she was talking about. As far as he (and Harry) could tell, everything had been reported truthfully, without bias and, in a manner that seemingly targeted the loss of its credence during the war, somewhat self-deprecating.
Harry stopped grinning, sitting up straight to look across the table at his friend. ‘I think most of it’s jewellery passed down through the family,’ he explained awkwardly.
Harry wondered, rather nastily, if this had all come about because the Ministry desperately needed to keep Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, in their good graces or if this was something they’d been considering and it was just a happy coincidence that it would get Harry back for training.
He didn’t understand the forgiveness the people he loved offered but he cherished it and he would spend the rest of his life trying to deserve it. He would spend the rest of his life loving and giving and striving to be even half the man Harry thought he was and could be. He’d spend the rest of his life listening to Luna’s stories and encouraging her adventures (and holding her when she cried because Astoria couldn’t return her feelings). He would spend the rest of his life answering George’s questions about Potions and Ginny’s endless demands for a training partner.
Which was exactly when Harry arrived, who took one look at Hermione crying and Draco having just physically assaulted his ex-best friend and rounded on Weasley with, ‘What the hell did you do to Hermione?’
‘You don’t trust me.’ Draco said the words calmly, without censure. He hadn’t expected or believed otherwise, but the words still left an ache in his chest. He knew a month of tentative friendship wasn’t enough to overcome seven years of insults and bullying, not like it had with Harry or Luna, but he’d thought he was getting somewhere with Granger at the very least. She’d certainly seemed more understanding – or at least her understanding – of his place in Harry’s life.
was smart enough to duck and Harry caught the attacking wizard in the side with a violet light that knocked him off his feet and into the lamp post behind them. Thick chains shot from the end of Harry’s wand to wrap tightly around the robed attacker and Draco turned away so he could search the street for the rest of the robed figures. But the street was quiet, no longer surging with the bodies of muggles trying to flee and any hope he had of finding the other two cloaked figures was gone with them.
‘We were so young, Ginny, we got swept up in this fantasy of what life should be, but that’s not life Gin, it’s not the one I want or deserve and it’s not the one you deserve either. Can you honestly look back over the last couple of years and tell me you’re happy? That it’s all exactly what you wanted?’
He’s not sure what makes today the day, whether it’s the weather or his mood or that his tea was just that touch better than normal, but when he steps into the floo in the Ministry Atrium he knows that tonight he’s going to tell Ginny. It’ll hurt; he knows that. Knows she’ll be angry too but now, finally, in a way he never thought he could be, he’s prepared for that hurt.
McGonagall wasn’t as familiar with Draco’s propensity to swear in foreign languages when things got bad, but she was familiar enough with Draco to know that something wasn’t right. She pointed her wand at her own throat and when she next spoke her words echoed sharply around the castle. He wondered if it would reach every corner, known and unknown.
His pride and his arrogance and his truly (he saw it now) abhorrent beliefs carried him right through until the summer before fourth year when things began to change. Not a lot, little things really – a hushed conversation between his parents that changed the mood in the Manor. Strange visitors after the World Cup and longer absences, missed dinners and furtive conversations with people Father would never normally associate with but could be relied upon (for the right price) to provide the kind of information necessary to maintain one’s position and get ahead. Absolutely nothing happened that changed the way Draco felt about his father and his family and his place in the wizarding world.
heard it than she did about the sudden attack by Death Eaters in a muggle village. Not that she wasn’t bothered by
‘I never saw the appeal in either of them,’ he’d admitted. ‘I was never one for a Gryffindor fantasy – although Blaise and I did once catch a glimpse of you in the quidditch showers and I’m pretty sure that fuelled all of my fantasies for most of fifth year.’
at some point, just to thank them for being objective and actually writing the truth. He liked the way they captioned their photos too, something about it amused Draco, to see the slow transition he’d been making from ex-Death Eater to Ministry curse breaker. Perhaps he’d offer up a donation if they could promise to continue writing fair and well researched articles – about everything of course, not just him. He knew how that would look.
Draco was asleep before Harry even pulled the covers over him and he stood for a moment smiling fondly down at him before he turned to head back to the bathroom and jumped when he found Ron looking at him through the open bedroom door. Belatedly, Harry realised he hadn’t closed it behind him and that Ron couldn’t reach through the wards to close it. Later, when he was thinking a bit clearer and wasn’t suffering from magic fatigue, he’d realise that Ron had been standing guard over the door.
‘Draco has been such an intrinsic part of my life since I first found out about magic so when I overheard the aurors talking about what they’d done to him I didn’t think – I just went looking for him and it sort of spiralled from there.’
It’s probably why Ginny, in spite of her anger, laughs properly for the first time all night. He thinks things are looking up until the laughter turns to tears and then great big sobs and he has to exchange an alarmed look with Draco because neither of them is quite sure what to do.
I would love to hear thoughts on Draco and Harry's bond and Ron and Draco's exchange. In my mind while I was writing this I felt like Ron was fresh from witnessing Draco do something extraordinary again and it was warring with his hatred of the git. Also writing concussed/drugged Draco was fun.
Harry hummed disbelievingly but he didn’t argue. Draco glanced down at him to see he’d closed his eyes and looked to be drifting off. He was wondering if he should get up and run, leave Harry to sleep, when he noticed the runes were standing out clearly on Harry’s skin. Which was odd because they hadn’t been there when they went to bed. They hadn’t even been there by the time they returned to Hogwarts. Draco had assumed Harry had washed the off with a quick charm before anyone could see them.
Baffled, Hermione could only stare. Next to Luna’s bright skirt and tights, her unicorn print t-shirt, Malfoy stood tall and imposing in
She wasn’t so sure about that, but she hadn’t wanted to ruin their easy talk by pointing out that even in the wake of a war based on blood and status, there were still those old families – and some not so old – who didn’t like change, who didn’t see the need for change and would be watching and scrutinising every change she tried to make just because she was muggleborn. There’d be people who opposed her for simply being who she was and just because she was Harry’s friend, just because she’d fought beside him in the war, she didn’t think that would make it easy for her to change the way the wizarding world worked.
‘Fix what?’ wondered Harry. ‘You’re going to have to explain it to me. Why in the name of Merlin were there so few students at Hogwarts? Why aren’t there more? Why didn’t those other five come?’ Harry paused, took a deep breath, and then had an even more alarming thought. ‘Sweet fucking Salazar, does Hermione know about this?’
had been publishing recently. It was light on embellishment, contained only basic details that the public should know and – and this is what truly impressed Draco – was stunningly accurate in detail and the conclusions drawn.
Which was why, after bringing down the wards with Bill’s help, he’d been handed an energy booster and a wide-awake potion just as Bill had, rather than the scorn he’d have once received and the expectation he could do without – too bad if it got him killed.
‘What good would that do?’ Draco had demanded, twisting his body on the sofa so he could look at Harry. ‘You need sleep too!’
Hermione wiggled closer to him so that their bodies were pressed together from hip to shoulder, knees bumping awkwardly too. ‘I know it’s not the same,’ she said, ‘but you have always been able to reach out to me.’
Didn’t want to think what, because Malfoy was standing on the platform as if he had every right to be there, as if he hadn’t almost killed two students before he’d fled after the death of Dumbledore, like he hadn’t still been fighting alongside Death Eaters in the final battle. He stood there, hand in Luna’s, as though he hadn’t spent the last year torturing students on the orders of the Carrows, as though he hadn’t stood by and watched as countless muggles were tortured and killed. As though he hadn’t had a front row seat for some of Voldemort’s worst atrocities.
There was an upside, however. The presence of the Mark on the arm of a free Death Eater gave the recovering Ministry the chance to properly rid the world of all the threats Voldemort and his followers left behind. Oh, the Ministry’s curse breakers may have been able to break through eventually but doing so would likely have destroyed any evidence left behind. Draco provided a unique opportunity, and, in his position, he couldn’t say no.
And he remembered waking up to the sight of a messy head of hair and angry green eyes and he’d felt safe for the first time in a long time.
‘I – thank you, Draco,’ Granger murmured eventually, after the silence had dragged on almost painfully long.
Harry pulled a face but didn’t ask why, instead he said, ‘We both need new kit. I swear Pomfrey fed us a growth potion.’
Harry snorted, his words caught between horror and fascination as he said, ‘Merlin, he would, wouldn’t he?’
Harry made it sound so easy. As though sneaking into Hogwarts was simple. As though breaking into a heavily warded room with just the aid of Harry’s invisibility cloak, so that he could take the place of one of Harry’s Weasleys in a horrendously complex ritual that was the Order’s last-ditch effort to defeat Voldemort, was as simple as a casual stroll in the park.
They did notice when he snapped, ‘Mister Malfoy, what is it you find so much more interesting than my class?’
‘Well, I guess that answers my question of how you’re doing,’ Pansy had quipped, with a healthy dose of sarcasm as she shut the door behind them.
It was from those two wizards that the initial spells aimed at them had come, the third Draco guessed, had slipped through the line of aurors. Months and months living with Voldemort and his Death Eaters at both the Manor and at Hogwarts under the Carrows’ regime had given Draco excellent reflexes. He’d ducked out of instinct before he’d even thought about it.
Finally, after giving Ron’s fears times to filter through his automatic rejection, Harry replied softly, ‘I think that’s a risk you have to take.’ He nudged Ron with his foot, making his friends knee twitch. ‘Worrying about what-ifs will make them come about,’ he offered. ‘This thing between you two has been building for years and I can sort of understand why you’re worried but if you don’t take this step then you’re letting that worry and fear rule your relationship. And
‘Scorpius set the house on fire,’ Malfoy answered with a wry look, lifting the drink in a toast to her before he tossed back a large mouthful.
Even more amused now, Draco asked, ‘Harry did you flirt with the man at the counter to get us decent food?’
Harry eyed him knowingly. ‘Don’t think I don’t know how much you want to study whatever those spells turn out to be.’
‘You’re thinking too loudly,’ Draco murmured, rolling over to snuggle into Harry and tuck his head under Harry’s chin.
Harry laughed but it was Hermione who said, ‘That was very impressive work last night. I didn’t even see the shield you were holding in place.’
His father had pulled a face at the crude words, but he’d nodded his head once in understanding. His words had been wry when he said, ‘I don’t think anyone who has ever seen the two of you together would think anything other than you’re both besotted idiots.’
Harry huffed out a disgruntled, ‘Oh, it’s going to be one of those days, then?’ but he was already moving toward Draco and the edge of the ward as he spoke.
He thought, for one optimistic moment, that Weasley was going to say something bratty and leave, but he took a slow breath, winced, and said, ‘No. Not until Harry comes back.’
McGonagall frowned at him, but she answered him all the same when Hermione sat up with interest. ‘I had to complete my mastery in transfiguration and take a number of independent courses on teaching.’
Now it was different. Now they thought they knew what he was capable of and it scared them. Now, he was a true Death Eater in their eyes and not just the son of one. Where before there’d been anger and righteousness, now there was true fear. Now they looked at him and they didn’t sneer and remember the boy who threatened to tell his father. The boy who played up an injury to get exactly what he wanted. They didn’t see the rich and arrogant git with the father who could buy anything he wanted, even the Minister for Magic.
A perk of being so thoroughly hated by the entire student body, was the way they left a good chunk of space around him at the table, no one willing to sit close to him. It afforded him the privacy he needed to peek into the envelope and pull out the single sheet of parchment folded in half.
Draco had been thinking about it a lot over the last week, listening to Ginny relay the things her brother had been saying and while he didn’t like what the Weasel had said, there was a part of him that couldn’t help wondering if he hadn’t specifically chosen those words to hurt. If Weasley hadn’t said the most hateful and hurtful things he could think of to make sure that Harry was feeling as bad as he was. He wasn’t sure if this made it better or worse that the things he had said didn’t truly reflect his beliefs – he’d still said them.
‘Blood play, Potter?’ Draco quirked a brow with a grin, eyes darting away from his work to lock with Harry’s.
Friday morning meant double DADA with the Gryffindors. For the first time, he was looking forward to it.
Draco had no doubts that, as happy as his father was to go along with Draco’s relationship with Harry, there would not have been such a relaxed and warm atmosphere had he been present. He certainly didn’t imagine Andromeda would have come along with Teddy – let alone spent the night as she had done.
After a moment just breathing through the new pain, he tossed his wand tip at the ceiling to detach the soft glow of the lumos and set it hovering above his head. Then he cast a patronus and sent the huge dog bounding off through the castle to find Harry and then McGonagall – although perhaps he should have done that the other way around? Blood dripped into his eye and he wiped it away in annoyance before he forced himself to ignore the pain in his leg and staggered to his feet.
Harry, who had made a disappointed keening sound when Draco pulled away, had to shake his head to put himself back in the kitchen and seated with his friend rather than, as Draco glimpsed in his glazed eyes, take Draco by the hand and drag him all the way back up to their bed.
Your mother and I agree that we can no longer support you and your silly ideas and life choices. We are both disgusted at the words you wrote us and will no longer tolerate this childish behaviour.
“Some of what people say is correct, I guess. I do live with my aunt and uncle, and my cousin as well. But royalty isn’t exactly how I would describe how I get treated back home; I think a house elf might be a better description. My family are muggles, they hate anything to do with magic. The very idea of me growing up to be like my parents sickened them, they thought they could discipline the ‘evil’ out of my by treating me like a slave growing up.” The expression on Harrys face hardened as he got lost in the memories. “I wasn’t given a bedroom until I was 11, I use to sleep in the broom cupboard underneath the stairs. I remember going to school for the first time and learning that my name wasn’t ‘boy’, you would think my teacher would have picked up on something.”
Snape let out what was probably the closest thing to a chuckle he could come by. “don’t worry your little head about it. I will explain it to you more later. For now, take comfort in my acceptance.” His eyebrows furrowed “I fear I have failed you that you did not thing you could come to me with this”
Harry instantly regretted how blunt he had said that when he saw Draco tense suddenly. He lowered his chin to his chest and to Harry’s alarm, he noticed the tears begin to stream down his pale cheeks again.
“Dragon, what are you doing here after curfew?” He seemed to be ignoring Harry all together, but neither of them cared much for that at the moment.
Harry had loosened this grip on Draco some during his rant, but quickly righted this once he noticed. Draco cut himself of from his ramble and tucked his head back into the space between Harrys neck and shoulder, taking a shaky breath to stabilise himself.
Harry let out a breathless laugh, sitting up, pulling Draco to his side. “So, what do you want to do about telling Snape?”
Later on, he would blame the exhaustion catching up with him but the sudden need to figure out why Malfoy was pacing in an collapsed abandoned section of the dungeon over took any other desire he had for not getting caught and ending up in detention.
Draco grip on Harry’s arm tightened, he looked lost in thought for a second. Taking a final deep breath Draco began to explain.
The atmosphere of the room of requirement blew him away each time her was in there, constantly changing for the needs and desires of the inhabitants. The room itself was a little of the cold side, despite the fireplace crackling away in the corner, the polished marble floor bouncing reflections of the flames around the room. A large circular window covered the expanse of the far wall; how that worked with the outer layout of the castle, Harry will never truly understand. The moon shone brightly through the window, bathing the room in a soft silvery glow.
He decided that the best way to get past his friends was to sneak past them before they were ready for him to disappear.
“Why are you being so nice to me Potter? How do I know that you’re not going to run straight back to you little gang and tell the whole school what you know?” He pushed himself away from their embrace, holding himself straight, as if trying to appear tough.
“Ok. Number 1, you have to understand that you liking guys doesn’t make you a bad person or any less of a wizard. I understand that this is something you have kept hidden away for a long time and you were probably scared to tell me, especially considering our history, but this isn’t something that I would ever use against you.”
Draco gave Harry a wry look, letting him know just how stupid a thing that was to say. They both knew that nightmares could be terrible. How many times had Draco woken Harry with screams and tears? How many times had it been the other way around?
Draco had never seen McGonagall so furious, he suspected even Harry had never managed to garner this level of fury from the woman. They walked her through what they’d discovered and then set about freeing the rest of the portraits while she slowly made her way along the corridor speaking with each of the portrait’s occupants until the picture she’d gathered had her almost shaking in her rage.
Harry pulled a face that Ron couldn’t see. He’d prefer not to think about that awkward week after Fred’s funeral, all things considered. He and Ginny had tried so hard to bury their grief in each other which had culminated in (thankfully only) the one terrible sexual encounter between them that had had them both going their separate ways. If the war hadn’t come between them maybe they would have stayed together but Harry didn’t think it would have lasted.
Draco didn’t believe that for a moment, not really, he was just a touch nervous about meeting with Pansy. He hadn’t seen her since the final battle of the war and before that he’d been a right shit friend to her. He was using his new relationship, his newfound happiness, to give him the strength to reach out, to try and be the kind of friend he only just now realised she’d been trying to be all along.
An old friend? Just who was Malfoy married to. She hesitated, eyes searching his face for some sort of clue. She saw the moment his smile wilted, saw the moment the amusement faded into seriousness.
It took him twenty-five. They didn’t manage to leave for a full forty-five minutes, though, because on the way out of his bedroom he made the mistake of stopping to introduce them both to the portrait of Fleamont.
‘Well,’ Harry said slowly, with a sparkle in his eye Ron didn’t trust one bit. ‘We needed a night out.’
Mostly he kept his eyes on Harry. Catching sight of him initially, talking to the auror-in-charge, he’d watched as Harry slowly made his way through giving his statement (twice) and then watched as he joined the other aurors to interview the muggles that had been cleared by the healers. Every now and then he’d get roped into talking with a few of the senior aurors who had been roused out of bed but as none of them were Robards, Draco stayed quietly on the fringe, just watching the mixture of competence and inadequacy that passed for the Department of Law Enforcement in a post-war world.
‘Maybe it’s time you asked,’ Neville suggested, speaking up from where he, was once again, sitting under the window and tending his plant in the moonlight. ‘Not just Harry, either. Maybe it’s time you asked Draco to explain why you should forgive him.’
Hermione nodded. She wiped her eyes, requested Harry not kill Weasley and then swept out of the room. Draco could have left it at that, he could have followed after her without a single word of explanation but if Harry continued to fight with Weasley and make things worse, then he would regret it and while old Draco would have taken great pleasure in widening the rift between the two, the Draco who had been through a war and was tired of it all (and loved Harry) thought it best to say something explanatory before he left.
‘I’ve talked about everything with Draco,’ Harry says with a pained wince. He’s aware that the last time he and Ginny spoke about having children was back before they’d even gotten married whereas he and Draco had talked about it the other night after Harry had spent the day with Teddy.
At least, he hoped she was beginning to understand. She’d been good about being friendly with him over the weeks since Harry had returned to Hogwarts and shown they were friends. She’d given him the benefit of the doubt on multiple occasions and gone so far as to defend him at least twice, but that, he’d always known, came from her desire to see people treated fairly. It came from a desire to see the war put behind them and those who needed to be punished, done so in a manner that fit their crimes. As far as she was concerned, he had served his time and his punishment was fair. She’d hadn’t liked him, hadn’t shown treated him with anything that could be called genuine friendship, but she was respectful, and she had treated him as any other person – when she wasn’t doggedly demanding he explain why he was using dangerous and illegal magic.
‘I could feel that it was gone but it was a good feeling, a relief honestly, like there was a pressure lifted and everything I feel is stronger, deeper – like there are more colours in the world. My tie to Draco doesn’t feel like that hole got filled up or take that feeling away. It’s not like I just traded a piece of one soul for another, Draco and I sort of reach for each other?’ He glanced at Draco who nodded. ‘Yeah, we reach out for each other, we don’t have bits of each other buried within us.’
Eventually, when the tension had begun to rise and Draco felt like it might suffocate him if he didn’t say something, Pansy broke the silence. ‘I don’t want to talk about seventh year.’
‘I’ve been there,’ Harry told him, making a soft sound of triumph when he finally located the book. ‘The night I got bitten by Nagini. There’s a memorial there now, it’s kind of nice.’
‘I’ll have it redone,’ he told her, looking up. It seemed to take a lot of effort, that movement, the motion sluggish, and he became aware of how heavy his limbs were feeling. He knew Pomfrey hadn’t given him any potions to sleep just yet and it took him longer than it should have – a symptom of its own – to recognise that his body was free of the adrenalin that had kept him up and going and now he was quite likely about to pass out. He squeezed Luna’s hand tightly in alarm.
Pansy froze. Whether at his blunt admission or the open acknowledgment of the things he’d been through he didn’t know, but her hand tightened on her glass, the other spasmed into a fist on the sticky tabletop. There were plenty of ways she could respond, plenty of sharp words about how he deserved what he got or soft ones of sympathy.
He’d only been called on three times in the two months since Azkaban but each time he’d returned weak, shaky and twice with curse injuries Madam Pomfrey had struggled to heal.
‘I don’t understand how you weren’t even aware of it,’ Hermione muttered after Ginny took pity on her and offered up her napkin and Draco handed over his too which Hermione quickly transfigured into something a bit more workable.
‘How did you even know that would work?’ she asked him. He could only assume it was the magic itself and his knowledge of the cabinets rather than the Death Eater aspect she was questioning. Which she confirmed when she added, ‘How did you even know they were there?’
Honestly, he had been expecting it to be a stag when the creature finally emerged, but Draco thought he liked the shape that did emerge more. It was a giant dog. The kind that Harry had tattooed up his left wrist to represent his godfather. He’d been surprised – as had Harry – but his mother had cried, startling them both. She’d been the one to explain what it meant, what it represented. Sirius had done what Draco wished he’d done. When the time came, and the choice had to be made, Sirius had turned his back on the Black family, on his own family, and sought refuge with the Potters. He was the child of a pureblood family in support of Voldemort who had made the right choices, all the choices Draco wished he’d been strong enough to make.
‘We can’t get it down,’ Bill said. ‘There’s something in that last ward that’s preventing us from even properly identifying it.’
‘Never mind Harry’s sudden interest in romance novels, Hermione,’ Ron complained, ‘I need help with this.’
The Draco who had fought in and survived a war hated it, hated how hard it would make it for him to just live his life. Hated how far this pushed him from changing people’s perceptions and gaining acceptance. The Draco he was now hated how hard it would make things for Harry who was determinedly sticking by his side. If people feared him now, if they saw what he was capable of and it terrified them, then what chance was there that Harry’s easy acceptance of him would go unremarked.
He straightened up, took a grasp of the bottle and refilled his and Pansy’s glasses. He downed the contents of his in one fiery swallow and then refilled it. ‘You wanted to marry me when you were five?’
Draco gave him a quick thump across the chest. Not particularly hard but with enough oomph that Harry’s eyes jerked open and he pushed up onto his elbows.
. He didn’t want someone in his life who was just going to leave him over something that made him happy. He hoped Ron had come far enough since the war to see that, but it didn’t matter, not in the end.
She got her wish a week into their return and it was everything she’d viciously hoped and completely horrible and she wasn’t that person. She wanted to put the war behind her, and she wanted him punished but this – this pain and blood and the completely unprovoked nature of the attack didn’t sit right.
‘He might actually be Norwegian,’ Draco considered that for a moment before he shook his head. ‘Rich friends, lots of money, they’re all exceptionally bored. And I think Mrs Zabini is due to knock off her next husband any day now, so I’m sure there’s some more money we could use.’
Robards once again spoke as though Harry hadn’t said anything. ‘Bill Weasley has volunteered to work with Malfoy.’
‘Very much,’ Draco assured him, looking down at the sleeping man with such a soft expression that even if he didn’t think Longbottom was a good man, he’d likely have earned some forgiveness.
and he couldn’t help wondering about the boy in the cell who would never have the chance to make the right choices, who would never have the chance to teach Harry how to love and laugh and –
Music started to issue from across the table and Malfoy pulled a face. ‘Salazar, we’ve been here not ten minutes.’ And he slid out of the booth pulling a muggle phone from his pocket as he did so.
‘The other half liked to read Skeeter,’ the man offered by way of explanation, looking confused and a little sheepish. ‘She has been following you two in
They talked about little things, Hogwarts and homework and how Longbottom was returning to Hogwarts early to help Sprout with the final replanting of one of her greenhouses. When their food arrived, Draco was explaining about the sentient plant at Grimmauld Place he was thinking of having Longbottom look at. They fell quiet after that, the three of them content to eat in silence, watching the swelling crowds as they munched away thoughtfully.
He could see the way Ron and Hermione were waiting for it too and that threatened to tip his anger into rage. His words, when he spoke, were sharp, dripping with power. ‘Say that again.’
‘Come with me,’ Harry whispered, easing down until he was laying atop Draco and grinning against his lips when he felt Draco’s hands come to rest on his hips.
Over the weekend, he locked himself away in his dormitory, not even venturing out for food or library books. He chose instead to send Kreacher for what he needed. The house elf responded well to Draco, much better than he ever did Harry and Draco didn’t mind taking advantage of that fact if it meant he could have a weekend of peace where he didn’t have to watch his back.
‘Perhaps we should start running inside the castle,’ Draco suggested, rubbing his icy nose with gloved fingers in a futile attempt to warm it up. ‘My nose is bloody freezing.’
‘Yes, yes, I was a horrible person,’ Draco waved a hand dismissively. ‘That was mostly to Gryffindors, though,’ he conceded. ‘I had no problem with Hannah and the rest of the Hufflepuffs.’ He glared at Weasley. ‘She
Harry kicked him gently under the table, not in rebuke but to get his attention. When Draco glanced at him Harry gave him a look that rather clearly asked if Draco wanted him to intervene. Draco kicked him back to say not yet and turned his attention back to the fourth year who didn’t seem to know what to do now that his request (demand) hadn’t immediately been met.
And then Draco could wait no longer. He held tightly to Harry’s shoulder and let the pull carry them both away. He had no idea where they were going, Hermione could very well have been right – in all likelihood she was right – but Draco had no choice but to follow the summons. The last glimpse he had of the warmth of the Burrow’s kitchen showed worried Weasleys and the shiny brightness of a patronus.
Which wasn’t really Harry’s point, but he tended to get a little distracted when thinking about Draco. Besides, even if Draco had ways of making it very (very) enjoyable to complete his homework in a timely fashion, there were still times when facing down an essay had him regretting his choice to come back for NEWTs. Even then, he did have to acknowledge that getting it over and done with made it go a lot faster than a week’s worth of procrastinating ever did. Plus, it didn’t hurt that Draco’s pleasure in learning new things was almost infectious. Harry had never appreciated what it meant to study and learn before, it wasn’t something he’d ever gotten from just sitting around doing homework with Hermione, and certainly not something he could have garnered from any time spent with Ron, but watching Draco get invested in what he was studying never failed to make Harry go all soft and gooey.
Harry knew he wasn’t being fair, he’d paced agitated circles around her office while she had the politically polite, adult version, of a shouting match with Kingsley through the floo, after all. That didn’t stop him from being angry that she’d allowed two aurors into Hogwarts and just stood there with lips pursed as they whisked Draco away via portkey. It wasn’t Kingsley’s fault either, but Harry had already tried arguing with Robards and that hadn’t gotten him anywhere, which was when McGonagall had taken over and demanded to speak to Kingsley.
‘I’m getting terribly fond of her,’ Draco murmured later, after they’d dumped Luna into her bed in Ravenclaw tower and were on their way back to the eighth-year dormitories.
Draco doesn’t hesitate to rise from the chair, but he does pause at the fireplace and the look he gives Ginny is one Harry is sure he has only ever seen. It’s gentle and filled with awe and his words are so soft and almost reverent when he says, ‘Thank you.’
Draco winked and released him. Harry stepped backwards through the wards with a salacious grin and turned to deal with the aurors. The blood runes were crude but effective; they wouldn’t last long but they would last long enough that Harry could come and go across the wards. By their nature, they were easy to remove, the power left behind in Draco’s blood wouldn’t last long. It would probably last longer on Harry than on most, what with the way their magic danced and entwined whenever they were together.
He probably deserved the kick to the ankle she gave him for that comment, but it drew a smile out of her, so he’d consider it worth it.
‘How – how do we tell Draco?’ He glanced down at Draco, struggling to rebuild his fucking lung after the Ministry used and abused him, and imagined telling him that the girl he watched being tortured and raped, the one he’d been forced to stand and watch, as she had her throat ripped out, was coming back to Hogwarts.
‘Suit yourself,’ Draco shrugged it off and settled back against the covers, closing his eyes as though he were about to drop back off to sleep.
‘We talked over the summer,’ he’d said once and ‘He’s changed a lot,’ another time and neither of those were enough of an explanation for Hermione who had been witness to Harry’s sheer hatred and obsession with Malfoy in sixth year.
‘I’m not in that one,’ Draco complained. ‘I thought the point of this whole thing was how we’d always end up together.’
But the words hung in the air and the look on Neville’s face, the horror at hearing those words come out of Ron’s mouth was so very real, and Harry felt sick. All he’d wanted when he came looking for Ron was to explain, to say all the things he wanted Ron to know and understand that he hadn’t been able to say in the vault because Ron had left.
Harry’s guilt of all he’d lost manifesting in blame within his own nightmare. It wasn’t unusual, Draco knew that. Some days Harry did nothing but blame himself for all the losses he’d suffered during the war. It wasn’t the first time he’d dreamed himself responsible in such a manner and it wouldn’t be the last. Harry had broached the topic once with his mind healer but as far as Draco knew her advice had been accepted by Harry in as much as Harry accepted any of her advice, and so the dreams had calmed somewhat but he didn’t know that they’d ever stop.
Harry smiled. A proper smile that made Robards glare at him for being too damn cheerful. While the changes being made wouldn’t keep Draco completely out of harm’s way, they were a start, a sign that Robards (and Winthrop at the very least) saw Draco as more than just a nasty Death Eater tool to be used. A sign that if two people who’d never known Draco as anything other than a Death Eater (and Winthrop had never seen evidence of how crap a Death Eater he made) then the wizarding world at large might someday see it too.
‘Oh, I’m definitely getting special treatment.’ Draco let those words lie for a moment before he said, ‘I didn’t mean for that to sound suggestive.’
Sandwiched between Harry and a kneazle who took up far more space than seemed possible given her size, Draco felt content. His words to Harry were soft, not judging when he asked, ‘Is it easier to understand his behaviour because you were expecting it? We knew he’d walk, not that he’d be a homophobic prick.’
Although Harry had never really thought about it before, there really hadn’t been all that many students in their year. There hadn’t been many in the ones above either. In fact, he thought Dennis Creevey’s year might have been the largest and he didn’t think by many. But he supposed that made sense in a way, it gave wizarding couples long enough to be secure in Voldemort’s fall before they decided it was safe to have children. He imagined there’d been a lot of people afraid to bring a child into a world full of Voldemort and that Harry’s temporarily putting a stop to his reign would ignite a desire to have those children in couples now free of that fear.
had been feeding the wider wizarding world. But there were better times and places to have that kind of conversation with Harry.
Confused (as usual), Weasley said, ‘Er, yeah.’ He shook his head. ‘Hermione reckons now that you and Harry are friends, he’s not about to toss you aside just because you’re a git.’
Which was all well and good but three weeks later, Hermione was like a dog with a bone, constantly accosting him in the hall or bursting into his and Harry’s room with questions and new tests she wanted to run, and Draco was absolutely sick of it. He respected the academic pride Hermione took in her work, he honestly didn’t think there was anyone with more tenacity who would tear the library (and any other source she could find and make use of) apart looking for answers (and probably succeed) but the heavy study of his bond with Harry was taking something Luna had made sound beautiful and turning it into a dry clinical experiment that was doing his head in. His bond with Harry just was and after having it confirmed by Pomfrey that it wasn’t doing either he or Harry harm, Draco was inclined to just enjoy it.
Harry took Draco’s soft rambling words far more seriously than Draco himself was taking them because he stopped walking in the middle of the common room and spun to face Draco.
‘Nonexistent,’ Draco answered without hesitation. They were the only two left in the classroom and the scrutiny from Harry’s friends in the doorway and Slughorn at his desk was making Draco’s skin itch. He sighed. ‘Go away, Potter, before Weasley makes a fool of himself and tries to curse me.’
Draco had given Harry someone to talk to, someone who understood he was Harry and not just the Chosen One or the Saviour. When Harry walked down Diagon Alley people wanted to touch him, to talk to him and thank him. When they saw him, they saw the teenage boy who ended Voldemort’s reign of terror.
‘Hermione cornered me about our bond again,’ explained Draco. ‘Somehow the conversation circled around to the Vanishing Cabinets and sixth year.’
Harry got a good look at Draco’s naked back, took a moment to admire the snitch as it fluttered across his pale skin. He did not admire the way it zipped around the burn flowing down Draco’s right shoulder blade. Harry reached out to touch the edge of it as he steered him toward the bathroom and gave an annoyed sigh when the snitch jumped ship and darted up his hand to take refuge at his elbow. It was both the most annoying and coolest thing Harry had seen a magical tattoo do, but it wasn’t something to worry about – or think on – now. Harry continued to manhandle Draco into the bathroom, helped him strip out of his smouldering clothes and shoved him into the shower.
‘Oh, shut up,’ Harry snapped but it was half-hearted. ‘There’s my first what-if, really, what if my parents had lived and it looks a lot like that weird dream I had about mine and Ginny’s future.’
How he’d managed to avoid it was honestly just a combination of his usual dumb luck and his trademark obliviousness.
Harry did as instructed but Draco still gave him a couple of extra seconds to focus. Harry may have received more training in occlumency when he started with the aurors, but he was still terrible at it. Draco didn’t know if it was something about having a piece of Voldemort lodged so firmly inside him or just the way Harry’s brain and magic worked but occlumency was a branch of magic Harry was never going to excel at. He had enough power and will to put behind the magic but none of the finer control needed to properly sink into himself and build up shields. The same skill was needed to locate the ties between them. Draco could find it now, easily sink into the depths of them and find the soft flow, but Harry would need more time.
Ginny grinned cheekily. ‘Of course, then we had that delightful conversation before you left on that mission and I had a great conversation with Mum right before school started back which made so much more sense when I saw the two of you in DADA.’
He slipped out of bed murmuring soft words to Harry when he made a disgruntled sound in his sleep. Quiet as he could he stepped his feet into the boots he’d left by the door, scooping up Harry’s jumper on the way. He’d send the letter to Pansy now, while he was feeling hopeful about her response.
Draco, who didn’t see why they’d bother now after they’d already deemed this a case for the Ministry’s pet Death Eater, objected scathingly with, ‘Don’t be stupid, they wouldn’t have any idea what to do with this.’
‘After everything he put me through, after everything he brought down on our family with his stupid beliefs and his hunger for power and letting the fucking Dark Lord into our home, he just sat there and smiled exast-esac,’ Draco stumbled over the word before he finally managed to spit it out, ‘exasperatedly. He had the fucking audacity to sit there calmly and tell me he’d expected nothing less after seeing the two of us together, about hearing us talk about each other – like he ever heard Harry talk about me!
Harry stepped up hurriedly to follow in Draco’s footsteps, pausing on the very edge of the ward (impressing a couple of the aurors with how easily he located its boundaries, Draco would later learn) as Draco paused
Maybe he and Ron would be friends again someday, Harry didn’t know and wasn’t going to say it may never happen, because Ron had been a massive part of his life and still was in that he was a Weasley and the Weasleys were Harry’s family. But he didn’t need Ron and he understood that if that were ever to happen then it wasn’t him who had to change, it wasn’t about him accepting apologies and welcoming Ron back.
It wasn’t and Draco had been wondering the same thing. It was one thing to send him the numbers so he and his mother and aunt could make appropriate changes to their plans for Burbage Hall, but it was another thing entirely to expect him to swoop in and fix Hogwarts.
At least that part of their relationship should be familiar to Hermione, Harry couldn’t help thinking wryly.
Magic wasn’t the cause of this, not exactly, someone had set a trap in the floor, one that had been missed during the repairs, one that he and the second years had triggered simply by walking by.
It probably would have, Harry could see that. Draco had been very intent on paying back what he’d seen as Harry snubbing him, but if Harry hadn’t followed Ron’s lead would Draco have felt the need to continue on for so long? If Draco hadn’t seen someone he thought so unworthy of Harry Potter’s friendship taking what should have been his place, would he have carried on the way he had?
And that was a conversation he didn’t look forward to. He wondered if Kingsley’s offer of her own Wizengamot seat would soften the blow when Hermione realised that in order to bring the wizarding world into the future, they were actually taking a bit of a step back and bringing in some of the old laws that had been overturned after Grindelwald came to power.
‘Well, at least it doesn’t appear to be affecting your spell casting,’ she offered, finally turning to lead Hermione out of the Great Hall and leaving Harry to finish his lunch without having to answer a million more questions about his bond with Draco or the unfortunate need to translate everything Draco said.
No, Draco knew a bit about blood magic and protection, he’d read up on it, marked Harry with a type of it. He didn’t believe Dumbledore’s claims and he wasn’t sure Harry did now either. Harry’s trust and belief in Dumbledore had been shaken over the last year and a half. Too many truths had come to light, too many questions he now had to consider that had answers he didn’t trust or like. Harry would never be able to ask Dumbledore the questions he’d like to, he’d never be able to get the closure he needed, and, in that absence, he was drawing his own conclusions and those weren’t painting Dumbledore in the best light.
They found the diadem. The locket, as well, and it was so startlingly easy to take some fangs from the Chamber and dispose of them. It was so easy to make plans for the rest.
Salazar, hadn’t Weasley and the twins once had to rescue him from a locked and barred room? How were these things taken so easily in stride?
And Draco knew with horrifying clarity what would happen to him (what would happen to his mother and his father) should he fail.
Fiendfyre surged around them but Harry didn’t look back, he couldn’t, he wouldn’t see what he was leaving behind even as screams filled his ears and he knew Malfoy would die. But he couldn’t look back, he wouldn’t. He –
When he woke up the next morning, he had other things to worry about and didn’t give Harry’s (or was it his?) potential marriage proposal much thought. They did have a tendency to discuss marriage in the quiet hours but neither of them was ready to make a thing of it. Their magic might have had its own ideas, but they were eighteen and there were a lot of things they wanted to do and think about before they bothered with all the dramatics of Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived, marrying Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater.
He continued, “I stupidly thought this was the perfect opportunity to slip into the conversation a secret I had been keeping from them. I had been wanting to tell them but was too afraid something bad would happen from it; with good reason I see now.” His joke failed when neither boy could manage more than a twitch of their lips.
It would seem that Draco had beat Harry to the great hall and was in the middle of receiving his own lecture for his classmates. Pansy Parkinson was leading the pack, one step from yelling as she spoke to him. Her hands flying everywhere to exasperate her point.
“It’s complicated, I need you to deliver this letter to Ron and Hermione. Please Dobby, don’t tell them where I am. Just say that I am safe and will explain in the morning” Dobby took the parchment out of Harry’s hand with a perplexed look
Harry released a light laugh, reaching over and grasping Draco’s hand between his two. “Draco, there’s nothing wrong with you being emotional, you had a very good reason to be. And I enjoyed the cuddling, it was nice”
“Um. Uncle Sev. I needed to talk to you about something.” He kept eye contact with the professor, trying to portray the importance of the matter to him, adding afterwards “a private matter”
Several minutes of silence went by without either boy making eye contact or saying a word before Severus took control.
Even with the heavy subject matter that was going to be discussed tonight, and the slim chance of the last of Dracos family abandoning him. Harry couldn’t help but feel excited for tonight.
I tidal wave of emotions passed through Draco’s eyes, anger, sadness, fear and maybe even a dash of hopefulness before they settled back into the calm blank state that Draco has come to perfect over the last 2 years. Though nothing could hide how red his eyes were, nor the blotchiness of his cheeks.
The two began to rise from the hard concrete, brushing the dirt and dust from their robs, they had definitely been down here longer than they should have. They walked together, their hands intwined, until they reached the end of the abandoned corridor. They would have to separate here, or risk being spotted together.
Dobby popped up instantly, looking around the room in mild confusion. “what is Master Harry doing down here sir?”
His housemates and teachers looked upon him with pity and concern, falsely assuming he has been kept up at night, plagued by nightmares of monsters and shadows. Normally, they would be correct. But seeing as Harry hasn’t been sleeping, they have evaded him recently. Its surprising how little nightmares you have when you avoid sleeping all together.
From the look on Hermione’s face he could guess he had been at least kind of correct. He was sure she knew he was guessing thought. Sometimes she acts more like his mum than his best mate, not that he really minded the extra coddling.
Draco reached across to grab hold of Harrys hand again and took a deep breath “Uncle Sev, I like boys”
‘Become a famous quidditch player so I can shamelessly take advantage of your love for Harry and make you come and run some quidditch lessons in the off season.’
Harry smiled at him but turned back to Granger to gently inquire, ‘Why did you choose to erase their memories?’
He got up awkwardly, passing Teddy to Andromeda before he stuck his hands under the tree and dragged a box out from the very back of its branches. He’d made the choice not to wrap it, choosing instead to put a bow on top with a small note. It wasn’t a small box, something around twenty inches wide and perhaps twenty-five long and another twenty deep again. It was a little on the heavy side. Harry eyed it curiously as Draco slid it across the floor to him, then reached out slow hesitant hands to take the note from atop.
‘You didn’t have to do that,’ Draco’s voice was soft, some of the heat from his gaze melting away as they navigated the empty corridors.
‘What were you expecting?’ Draco wondered. He and Harry had talked about all the little signs they’d seen that suggested Granger suspected more between them, but the fact they were in a relationship seemed to have taken her completely by surprise.
Thank you for all the lovely kudos and comments and just the genuine support you've all shown me, it has made posting each new chapter an honest to god delight.
Hermione looked at Draco as though seeing him properly for the first time. ‘He told you all of this?’
There was a beat and then Harry moaned, ‘Fucking hell, of course its jealousy. I had a mad man trying to kill me, I didn’t have time to think about sex.’
‘Not about me,’ Harry croaked the reminder to himself. He coughed, shook his head once more and stared pointedly at Granger. ‘Right. Sorry. Er…’
Briefly, he toyed with the idea of bringing that up, of making this into a muggle versus magical debate just for a change of pace but the idea didn’t last long. He enjoyed being friendly with Hermione, actually enjoyed talking with her about their homework and he didn’t want to jeopardise the burgeoning friendship between them just because he was currently annoyed with her choice of research focus.
Sirius thinks he’s going to explode. The only silver lining of this bloody dinner was that Sirius could finally scare him off. But if Harry wants to marry him, then that means that Malfoy has stuck onto him like a leech and there’s no way that Sirius will be able to separate them now. Which means a few things, all of them too terrible to contemplate: a wedding featuring a family of deatheaters, countless more family dinners sullied by Malfoys, and most likely a messy divorce, featuring Malfoy stealing all of Harry’s inheritance.
“He’s not in love with you. I don’t even think someone like him is capable of it. And if you’d been thinking with your head instead of your dick, maybe you would have seen it sooner.”
If Harry had just said that, then maybe Ron would have approved and things wouldn’t have to be so awkward between the two of them.
“Thought your sneaking about days were over,” a posh, stilted voice carried through the corridor, before immediately spitting out, “Potter”.
“Excuse me?” How dare he? How dare he speak to Sirius like that? Malfoy was the one in the wrong-- he’d seduced his Godson, messed with his head to somehow trap him into an engagement and God forbid a marriage. He doesn’t have any right to tell Sirius to shut up-- not in his house, not at his table, not while he’s having a conversation with his Godson. He wants to break something-- preferably Malfoy’s face.
“What, are you gonna run to Daddy to whine about my bad attitude?” Harry uncharacteristically sneered, slowly drawing his wand.
By the next week, Ron had put the whole incident out of his mind. Harry wasn’t showing up with any new bitemarks and wasn’t sneaking out of the dorm as much excluding one Saturday night where he just disappeared. Ron was beginning to think that the
Harry closed the massive book in front of him with a slam, his essay half completed, and stalked out of the library.
There stands Harry, fiddling with a silver chain around his neck and standing uncomfortably close to literal demon spawn.
“You understand that Harry has a career, right?” Sirius narrows his eyes, “You can’t expect him to cater to your every whim while you laze about.”
He tried again that morning, when they were alone and heading down to breakfast, but as soon as his eyes wandered to the hickey under Harry’s collar, his mouth dried up and he was left gasping and choking until a goblet of pumpkin juice was pressed into his hands.
Malfoy drops his fork onto his plate, looking defeated. Sirius absently wonders if he can make him cry before the end of the night.
For now, Ron just waited in the shadows on edge, with one hand hesitantly wrapped around his wand. He could only watch as the once whispered insults raised in volume and became viciously aimed words. They grew closer together as they steamed.
Harry’s nostrils flared unattractively and Malfoy's jaw jumped visibly under the palpable tension, his teeth grinding. There was a sudden, slight pause, the heavy silence only lifted occasionally by the harsh breathing of the two wizards who stood trembling with barely suppressed rage in the center of a (mostly) abandoned hall.
Harry looked like his patronus-- wide eyed like a deer and pale as a ghost. Fuck. This was precisely what Ron was trying to avoid.
This wasn’t possible. This silver-tongued snake had invaded his home, had slithered through the back door from the garden straight into his Godson’s bed. How could Harry not see what was sitting amongst them?
“Sirius!” Remus sounded scandalized firstly, and pissed secondly. That was fine; secondly was manageable. Remus would tell him when he’d crossed the line via tongue-lashing. So, he forged ahead.
Harry didn’t say anything, but the frustrated tears that had built up during their argument spilled down his cheeks. He didn’t meet his eye.
Ron was expecting Harry to get defensive, or explain himself, or overreact and accuse Ron of spying on him. Ron was wrong.
Looking across the table, he noticed two things: Malfoy didn’t seem distraught or surprised by his declaration, and Harry was.
“What will people think?” he needed to get through to Harry, at any cost, “Even I think he’s worked some kind of dark magic on you.”
He tried again after transfiguration, but then Malfoy had walked past with some indecipherable glance, brushing against Harry and muttering under his breath, and by the time Ron got over the shock, his best friend was nowhere to be found.
“Sirius, enough!” Remus’s hand was gripped around his wrist. He let go of the fork he was wielding like a weapon, knuckles white and fingers shaking. It clattered onto his plate with a splash of trifle. There was a long silence-- oppressive and overwhelming.
So it wasn’t until a week later when Ron finally summoned the courage and strength over his nausea that he really planned to breach the subject with Harry. It wasn’t quite because he had processed it yet, but rather because he couldn’t take it anymore. Harry was disappearing for large stretches of time, popping up out of nowhere with hair looking more messed up than usual and his robes in disarray. Harry looked happy, but Ron was going insane.
“Sirius,” Harry’s voice was too calm for the occasion. They were all just sitting there while Sirius’s world fell out of the sky. “We’ve been together for more than two years now. Surely this can’t be that much of a surprise.”
Sirius groans. He’s begging for one more moment of peace before his arch-nemesis disturbs the sanctity of his home.
“What?” Harry’s head shot up from his potions essay, his sleeve smearing the ink and leaving black splotches on the pristine cuff.
“What is this, the sixteenth century?” Harry scoffed, “I’m not being sold like a piece of cattle, why does he need permission to propose?”
Remus, polite even in the face of arrogance, serves Malfoy first. Only once everyone is brandishing a plate of the pudding does Malfoy lift his fork to his mouth.
The boy in question whipped off his invisibility cloak at the far end of the hall. Ron was bewildered. He'd known Harry with his deathly hallows cloak and his incurable addiction to sneaking about for the past eight years, but he had never figured out a way to see through the charm. Ron, a bloody Prefect on patrol, couldn't catch his best friend wandering about the halls at night, but Malfoy could?
So when Harry slipped away from dinner a half hour early, his invisibility cloak dangling from his bag, Ron knew he had to follow.
“No,” Malfoy said an odd lilt to his voice, like he knew something that Harry didn't, “I'm going to make you shut up”.
“So, a match of wizard’s chess tonight, then?” Ron was definitely looking forward to having his best mate back.
By then, Harry has used his free hand to gently lift the silver chain from under his jumper, revealing a gaudy Malfoy family engagement ring, more suited for a demure pureblood bride than Harry. Sirius flinches.
“Get up, Sirius,” called Remus from his station at the cutting board, “You can’t put it off forever.”
“Well, you’ve clearly gone insane,” Ron continued, “So, as your best mate it’s my responsibility to stop you at all costs.”
Sure Remus has kicked him under the table four times, and Harry is avoiding eye contact with him, but the real spectacle is Malfoy. He’s trying to remain courteous-- no doubt what the pure-blood-scum has been taught to do-- but it's obvious he’s panicking. None of his tactics are working.
