Draco had no time to ask what that meant, or who the house’s previous occupant had been, they reached the kitchen.
It didn’t take him long to fall asleep.
It would have been such a nice thing to say, if only Draco hadn’t been contractually obliged to dislike muggles and be unhappy about being here.
“Oh,” Draco said, wondering how that was so scandalous. “That doesn’t sound so bad.”
Draco finished planting his plant, patting the earth down around it so that it was stable. That looked about right. And it was something that he’d seen the gardeners do, so it must be right.
Still… he couldn’t resist finding out gossip.
The women talked to him for a while. It was nice, as much as it could be, but he didn’t actually feel like he fitted in here. There was too much that he didn’t know, and too much they all knew between themselves.
Picking up one of the blankets on the bed, he was gratified that it was one that was his. That would make it superior to all of the muggle ones that had been provided with this terrible house. He wrapped himself up in it, and stood by the window for a minute, just looking at the stars.
The pictures on the box (which, being brightly coloured, Draco could only assume was aimed at children) showed the cereal in a bowl with milk.
Draco woke up the next morning to light streaming in through the windows. The front window being as big as it was meant that there was certainly plenty of it – and it had done a very good job of waking him up, singing directly into his eyes and being generally very uncomfortable.
He couldn’t even apparate out and into the upstairs. He had to climb them, like a muggle.
Nope. The expression didn’t give anything away either. He was as neutral as he had been earlier… although maybe Draco detected a little embarrassment?
Draco could hardly believe his eyes. Pansy Parkinson, of all people. She, who had all but abandoned him after the war, and had claimed that Voldemort had put some dark spell on her to keep her in his thrall.
Upstairs, the house seemed even smaller. There were four rooms up there – three bedrooms, and one bathroom. All of the rooms were small, and Draco wanted nothing to do with any of them.
“Good good,” Alison said, seeming pleased that he wanted to eat them. “I hate to toot my own horn, but I’m the one that made these. Usually we all take part in making some of the food, and this one was my own offering.” Alison must have seen Draco’s expression, because then she added, “oh, don’t worry! You weren’t to know about it, not when we didn’t want to overwhelm you with instructions. If you want to bring some when we have the next party, feel free to do so, but you don’t have to.”
For some reason, having the trunks in the room only made the room seem smaller and more lonely. There was less space to move in, and it reminded Draco that he was going to be trapped here for the foreseeable future.
Making sure to avoid saying yes, Draco made a vague affirmative noise. That would be good enough for now, right?
It took Draco a lot of what he was graciously calling trial and error to get the sausages to what he thought was right. Were they safe to eat? maybe, and there was no way of finding out right now other than to eat them.
And when he was done, he lay down on the sofa in the living room, and closed his eyes.
How had the ministry forgotten to tell him that muggles had different clocks? He had known it, in the back of his mind, but it hadn’t occurred to him at all when he had packed it. And there was only one clock in his house, and he avoided it whenever possible. How had he been expected to know that the muggles would think his watch strange?
Swallowing hard, he stood up and walked through to the kitchen. He hadn’t thought to check the levels of food in there earlier – was there even any food in it? Draco found himself suddenly terrified that he might need to brave a muggle supermarket tonight.
He began to read the box, hoping that this mystery would be cleared up. Sure enough, it stated specifically that it was designed to be eaten with milk. (There was also a whole lot of numbers and information that Draco couldn’t make any sense of. Why did muggles do maths while they ate? That seemed awfully strange of them.)
all evening other than look at all the dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen and wonder how he was meant to clean them all wasn’t frightening at all), he was ready for bed.
Sometimes when the ball went in the goal the men would cheer, and sometimes the men would groan. It felt a lot like being in the stands at the quidditch matches, and it made Draco feel nostalgic for playing. He wasn’t all that bothered about the aspect of watching the game, but playing? Now that was the thing that really felt special. There was no doubt about that.
A flicker of movement below caught his eye.
It told him that the time was 10am.
After Draco had located something which reasonably looked like it could cook a sausage or two, he ran up against another problem.
He fell asleep contemplating all of this.
The man shook his head, and turned his attention back to the box. “You ask a bloke if he supports the right team and he starts talking about rugby,” he muttered.
Of course, he would have to go out there on Saturday. It was slightly daunting to think about, and he wanted to think about it as little as possible.
“At the weekend, there’s a party being held at Carol’s house. I’m sure she would love it if you came!” Alison looked so enthusiastic at the idea of inviting Draco to this.
If he did that, though, he would be admitting that he was willing to be in the muggle world when he didn’t technically have to be. That would be giving up, and he didn’t want to have to do that unless he had no other option.
Draco had to hold the sighs in. Memories of his childhood flooded his mind – back when he looked up to his father, and dreamed of doing nothing more than following in his footsteps. Running the estate, collecting rent, managing the farmers of their farmlands, and making his own contacts in the ministry. His father had seemed so cool back then.
Then she walked away. Draco had no idea where that conversation was supposed to go. Maybe he would never find out.
But his stomach was rumbling, despite the dinner he had had before, and now he was beginning to dread what would be for breakfast. What did muggles eat?
Draco cracked it open. The artificial scent hit him immediately – it was very clear that this was not something he had eaten before.
Now that Draco wasn’t up for talking about the unusual objects that he had, Alison seemed to lose some interest. With a pat on the shoulder, she moved away to talk to her other friends, and that was okay with Draco.
“Would you rather be with the men, sweetheart?” Draco didn’t know this woman, but she sounded very kind.
Okay. Right. This was going to be like last night, wasn’t it? Just a lot of trial and error and trying every button until he hit on the right one to turn the water on.
She didn’t say anything more than that, and by the time Draco had collected himself, she had shut the door and was gone.
Draco opened the packet of sausages, tipping them out into the pan. Putting the pan on one of the rings that seemed to fit it, Draco tried twisting the dial that seemed to correspond to it.
“Thank you,” Draco said, strained. “That’s very kind of you.”
But he was getting hungry, and there was no way of getting around that. He walked the short distance from the living room to the kitchen (maybe that was one advantage to living here, in this small house – that it would take almost no time at all to get to the food, whenever he wanted it).
She shrugged and said “You two wouldn’t understand. Girls have to stick together, even if some girls are occasionally blood racist snakes.” Ron just shook his head, reaching for Hermione’s glass. Nose scrunched, he sniffed her cider suspiciously.
“What do you think has their knickers in a twist?” Harry asked, motioning roughly to the conflict with a glass full of pumpkin juice and a growing plate of food. “Don’t get me wrong, seeing Malfoy get the bad end of the stick is endlessly entertaining but I don’t think I’ve ever seen those two this prickly.”
“What would you know about Pansy and I? Not like you talk to slytherins in a civilized matter anyway.”
Harry fell deep in thought, his eyes drifting subconsciously towards the ravenclaw table where the head of a particularly alluring girl snuggled into the chest of none other than Cedric Diggory. He let out an unconscious scoff. When Hermione raised an eyebrow at his remark, he mumbled “Diggory and Cho are at it again. Can’t even keep to their own tables anymore. Honestly, I don’t see what she sees in him.” Hermione gave him a perplexed look.
“Thank you, Harry.” Ron continued to splutter, eyes passing between his friends with a mild look of betrayal.
“Parkinson must’ve really fucked up if Malfoy won’t even let her near him,” Ron whispered to Harry. With a chuckle, they took their usual spot in the back corner, as Hermione continued to the front and settled in for a mind numbing class.
“Pansy what do you think I mean? He obviously was a prat outside the Great Hall, that’s why you came in all puffy-eyed and unkempt.” Pansy gave him an exasperated look.
“Are you actually daft Malfoy?” The boy didn’t respond. “Potter,” she said with a sneer, “didn’t do anything. Well, he almost ran me over but he wasn’t the reason I was ‘unkempt’.”
“Well in the mean time we’ve all got papers due for McGonagall and I’m sure you two haven't even started yet.”
Harry woke with a start to the sounds of Ron, Dean, and Seamus hurriedly moving throughout the room. Drawers opening and closing, and the sound of water running pulled him fully from his sleep. Pushing aside the heavy red curtains, sunlight bounced off the golden egg atop his nightstand, blinding Harry temporarily. The light seemed too bright for morning as his sluggish brain put two and two together - he had overslept and potions was his first class of the day. The wrath of Severus Snape was not something to be ignored so he joined the whirlwind of the other boys, reaching blindly for glasses, day old discarded robes, and half open books from the night before.
“Harry, as famous as you are, your social skills have never been your strong suit. Last time you made eye contact with Cho, you dribbled pumpkin juice down your jumper. I certainly wouldn’t call that ‘good conversation.” He opened his mouth to respond but got cut off with the sound of Parkinson’s shriek.
“When’d he even ask you? Isn’t there usually an entourage of first-years following him around?
Harry chuckled, “Sorry, always get a bit dazed when I almost miss potions. You know Snape would have my head and a month’s detention if I managed to miss out on his exhilarating lectures on the uses of dittany.”
“That’s bollocks!” he said in shock. “What happened, did mummy dearest cut off her funds?” Hermione and Harry shared a mild frown.
“I heard the ferret called Parkinson’s mum a right whore and said if she had just settled down with a guy, Parkinson might’ve turned out alright.” Seamus called from down the table.
“I really don’t know what you’re on about Malfoy, and I really haven't the time-”
“Obviously!” The girl sneered back. Her expression was softer than the usual slytherin facade she wore, and Harry had an unusual pang of confusion at her expression. Parkinson rose, brushing imaginary dust from her robes, and Harry awkwardly began to follow her towards the Great Hall.
“Notes help you remember the information without the book Potter.” Potter scoffed at that, sounding mildly insulted.
The following days were tense with excitement and nerves as the Yule Ball loomed closer than ever. With only a week left, McGonagall led daily ballroom lessons while Harry and Ron panicked over their lack of dates. The pair had just endured their first lesson amidst relentless teasing from the Weasley twins.
“You? Going with Krum? You’ve got to be joking ‘mione!”
“Listen here, Potter.” Harry flinched at his name said like a curse. “You know nothing of Pansy and I’s friendship, and you should do well to keep your nose out of other people’s business in the future.”
“I look forward to seeing your hand-me-down robes at the dance, Weasley. Hope your grandmother’s lace frock fits you nicely!” Harry had to stop Ron from starting an all out duel in the middle of a corridor.
Keeping her eyes forward she bit out, “What do you want?”
“Pansy I’m sorry. I didn’t know you would be so hurt by all of this.”
“Not that it’s any of your business, Malfoy, but I do perfectly fine without notes. And Hermione helps me study if I ask nicely.”
“I saw you two walk in together before dinner. She had been crying. What did you do?” Malfoy’s voice echoed slightly off the corridor walls and he was close enough for Harry to see a determined glint in his eyes. He spluttered for a moment, caught off guard by the protective instincts of Malfoy. Sure, they’d had their share of fights but not over things like this.
The rest of Harry’s day passed uneventfully; his charms essay was unsurprisingly 3 inches short, but aside from Flitwicks look of disappointment all he could do was hope for a calm evening and a quick return to bed. His stomach carried him to the Great Hall, focusing solely on the smell of roast meat and spiced cakes. Without the accompanying voices of Hermione and Ron, Harry’s mind fell to the puzzle of the golden egg waiting for him in his dormitory. It had sat there for almost three weeks now and nothing had come of it except for the occasional headache. Possibilities of the future task and deciphering the egg's mysteries tumbled through his head until he barreled into a ruffled-looking Pansy Parkinson.
“I’m alright sir. Just been distracted lately, I’m sorry for any drop in my usual performance.” With a nod of his head Draco began to head for the door, he didn’t want to be late to transfiguration again. Before he could get very far, Snape reached an arm out hesitating to physically restrain the boy.
“I bumped into Parkinson outside the Hall and she looked well and truly sad. ” There was a moment of quiet confusion among the gryffindors. “I guess I don’t really care, it just struck me as odd to see a snake doing anything but hissing.” Snickers rang out at the comment as Ron choked on his food. Hermione slapped his back without looking up from her Potions work. “More fuel for irritating Malfoy though, so the more the better.” Ron nodded in agreement as the gryffindors dissolved into smaller conversations.
Draco’s face hardened. “Just tell my Father that I will not fail him.” Tilly opened her mouth to say more but Draco cut her off with a harsh bark. “GO NOW.”
Harry muttered a spell and some lube appeared on his fingers, he pulled Draco to his feet spreading his legs wide and reached up between his legs. Draco braced his hands against the wall as Harry’s fingers found Draco’s puckered opening, he slipped one inside Draco who moaned as Harry slowly worked to prepare him, gliding his finger in and out.
“But I do know,” Harry protested, “and you know I know.”
“Yes you did,” Draco said tracing a finger across Harry lightening scar. “I thought I was going to die, but even in that moment when I was bleeding out on the bathroom floor, my blood running down the drain, all I could think about was how I would never get to kiss you.”
The foursome followed the signs to the VIP area where they had their tickets checked again by a tall security guard.
I’m in bed too,” Draco whispered, “are you naked Harry, I’m naked in my bed.”
A shrill noise from under the pillow made Harry almost scream as the sound made his throbbing headache ten times worse.
“I just see Malfoy being Malfoy,” Ron said as he reached across to grab more toast. “He’s always been weird.”
“Black family spell, a different version of reveal.”
Author aims giant cannon at the crowd of readers.
“It has been so long since Severus had put nothing in his hair that I doubt he remembers what it looks like natural. Besides, I believe that even his sharp eyes were fooled for a while into believing you were a mini James.”
“I’ve never seen you with wings.”
Harry stared open mouth but Draco’s absolute convictions shone through his eyes. Harry broke down.
“I’ll kill em, the stupid fucking wankers, pisspots’ the lot of them. They all need their bollocks ripped off and shoved down their throats.”
Padfoot lifted his head and bared his teeth at Fudge.
“Just say it, Severus, we have been friends long enough that I won’t take offence at your bluntness,” Narcissa said.
Tom leaned back startled then composing himself responded.
“Cause you were asleep so you couldn’t drink any fire whiskey. And cause I’m a kid I’m too young to drink?”
“Your clothes, they could have spells attached to them, and since they came from Malfoy, they are going to have to be destroyed. “
“Yes, Sir. I only ever saw and spoke with Mr Malfoy.” He couldn’t help speaking Lucius name with respect but hopefully, he could blame it on Hermione’s weird syndrome thingy.
Draco looked away, embarrassed. “I hope so,” he said. Severus reached out and squeezed his godson’s shoulder.
“I need you to tell me, is Harry in worse danger than dementors?”
The question so shocked Harry that he found himself replied without thinking about it
“I told you I would shut you up,” He said. Harry reached up to touch it but Vernon grabbed his hands and pull both of them behind his back.
“Yes, Mr Potter, the truth is far more complex than that.” Mr Malfoy informed him. “In reality, it’s a much more equal partnership. The Eros will choose someone who they believe can fight and protect them to be their mate. They in return will care for and look after them.”
Lucius had not said a single thing but had a completely relaxed expression. He was tilting his head a fraction leaning into the grip Narcissa had on him and baring his throat. That told Severus more than he wanted to know about his friends love lives so he looked away.
Eyes fluttering, Severus returned to the present with a hand stroking his hair soothingly.
“Have you ever seen Severus’ hair just after he has showered but before he coats it in Potion retardant?”
Harry blinked then slowly got to his feet, he had to lean against the headstone until the pins and needles withdrew from his legs. Spotting his wand Harry scrambled in a mad dash and snatched it up, holding it defensively he spun around but nothing moved. Harry wasn’t sure what was happening but he didn’t want to be in the graveyard for a moment longer. He quickly cast a spell at Wormtail tying him up with ropes then floated his stunned form over to where Cedric’s body lay in the grass. Harry knelt and making sure he had a good hold on both of them he summoned the cup. It flew across the grounds and thudded into Harrys chest. The hooking feeling from behind his navel grabbed hold of him and the graveyard went spinning away.
Severus swirled out of the office and out of Hogwarts before going back to his home. He hadn’t been back since the Dark Lord had called him to help with Harry’s healing. A few quick cleaning charms and the house was as presentable as it ever was. There was not a lot waiting for him here, but his paranoia that someone from the order would check up on him made him reluctant to lead them back to the Malfoy’s. Instead, he made himself a cup of tea and idly flicked through the teacher’s newsletter. He had already corresponded with Minerva letting her know what he required for the next school year.
Blaise did not understand why Harry needed different touches clarified for him, but in the back of his mind, a small alarm bell rang.
This was the last straw for Harry’s magic, which finally snapped and burst out of him, fuelled by years of pain and terror it manifested as a black fluid like cloud that expanded rapidly. It lashed out, destroying everything it touched. Leaving nothing but broken splitters in its wake. Growing bigger powered by the mass amount of magic and pain it consumed Harry completely, a moment later it swallowed the Grimm then seemed to take obscene pleasure in destroying everything it could, leaving nothing but splinters and body pieces in its wake.
Harry’s eye flew open with shock, He knew it; he knew it was no good trying to tell adults anything.
“Like, like if a boy tells you to suck his cock or he’ll get an adult to hurt you, and you do it without fighting, then you weren’t really saying yes?” Harry asked shyly.
“Here,” Draco thrust a bulky wrapped material bundle at him. Severus clutched it, bemused. “It’s my old camping tent. I might not be able to do much for my mate, but I can at least offer him shelter from the elements.” Severus looked at Draco with pride.
“Yes, well if they don’t want the whole topic to end in total disarray, intelligent people come prepared.”
“Impossible...... trauma......mentality is uncertain...”
There was an angry silence as they digested this.
Tom sat in one of the uppermost tier seats in the courtroom, his view half obscured by a column. Tom had chosen this seat in particular. People tried to avoid it, but Tom always knew how to make to best out of the cards he was dealt. He cast a wandless spell that allowed him to see one way through the column anyone on the other side couldn’t see him. Keeping him hidden from view. It had the advantage to be in just the right spot to hear what was being said from all corners of the courtroom.
“Oh Severus, has Voldemort going in contact with you yet?”
“It seems we have much to talk over.”
Severus could understand the wisdom in Tom’s words but doubted that he could comply.
Hermione huffed as she moved the papers around to clear a space for Harry’s cup but placed the china container that held sugar packets between the cup and her papers, Harry supposed it was there to act as a dam in case he spilled his coffee.
Draco’s eyes raked up and down Harry’s chest and arms. “It clearly suits you, you look good Harry.”
Draco is back from tour and Harry is rather excited. Harry also learns a bit more about Draco and Lumos Solem.
Harry led Draco into the conservatory at the back of the house. “Why don’t we go for a walk, it’s a beautiful day.”
“How’s life in the pigeon squad?” Draco had taken to calling the Auror team the pigeon squad after Harry’s owl tracking incident.
“Where would Master Harry like dinner to be served?”
Draco turned to face him, took Harry’s hands in his own and held them to his heart.
“Really? I thought we were pretty well behaved.”
Draco raised his head to look at Harry, there was a brief spark of hope in his eyes which quickly faded. “Don’t be stupid Potter, this isn’t something you and your Gryffindor do-gooders can fix with a few fancy spells.”
“You’re joking right? This has to be a joke.” Ron said flatly.
“Sure, you have my number, call me whenever.”
Draco smiled sadly. “Bringing up the fun memories won’t work, I’m not doing any magic. I didn’t even want the spell modified but I would have been struck off the wizards roll if I refused.”
“I’ve missed you too.”
10.18
“Umm yes, she’s a great player. We’re not together anymore.”
Harry hadn’t watched Muggle TV for several years and was shocked by the number of channels to pick from. He flicked through dozens before landing on a channel where the movie
“Malfoy is in a Muggle rock band and you are worried about them using a spell as a name?” Harry said incredulously. “He’s in a
“You and Draco are so alike. What do you feel guilty about with Hermione and Ron?”
“I’ll read it later,” Harry said putting the phone back in his pocket.
“Bloody hell, congratulations!” Harry hugged first Hermione then Ron. “I’m so happy for you both!”
Harry was finding it hard to find the words to adequately express his feeling towards Draco, and to explain the difference in the blonde Slytherin from his school days. It was going to be a big ask of his friends to accept Draco into their circle and he was not sure all of them would be willing to give Draco the chance to prove he had changed.
“Well I was for a while then I saw Malfoy on the map alone so I followed him.”
After the war Harry had returned to Hogwarts to complete his N.E.W.T’s working his bollocks off to obtain the grades needed to be accepted in the Auror training academy, and then spent three years in the training programme. The training had been hard, he pushed himself to his limits to meet the standard requirements and pass the exams needed to qualify as an Auror, it had been his dream job since he was twelve years old.  He had now been qualified for just over a year and although he hand been out on some minor raids he had yet be part of any major missions, he mostly just tracked information to help the seasoned field Aurors. Whilst Voldemort was long dead, the dark wizards were still active and some recent intelligence suggested that there was a new threat from a Hungarian wizard, Vilmos Sinistru, who had gathered a large international following among the dark arts community. Harry hoped he could eventually join the elite Auror squad that worked across the world chasing down dark wizards that crossed international borders. He had never really travelled much and as he was single the idea of racing off at the drop of a hat pursuing dark wizards whilst seeing the world appealed to him. But first he needed to put in the effort with his current caseload and that included completing reports for the cases that had been closed out. With a sigh, he picked up his quill and began the laborious task of recording the details on the twenty four page document. Being an Auror was not quite the job he had imagined it to be.
He let several seconds go by before he sent a follow up message.
Harry’s hand drifted to his rapidly stiffening erection.
“Well…..I guess I could bring some papers with me.”
“What happens when someone else touches your mark?” Harry asked.
“Thank you Draco! I’m coming to the show tonight, I’m really excited!”
“Merry Christmas Harry.”
***********************************************************
“I thought we had agreed my nickname was amusing jackass?” Draco smirked and held out a glass of wine to Harry, “Friends again?”
“That was before you were a massive prat.” She stepped to one side of the corridor outside her next class, and Draco followed.
“Blaise at least had the capacity to realize that he crossed a line and apologized! You can’t even see past your failed attempt at humour! God Draco get over yourself and learn how to be a good bloody friend!” With that Pansy turned on her heel and practically ran back towards the castle, as Draco pointed a counter-jinx at his face.
“Where were you two this morning? You missed a wonderfully dramatic spat between the king and queen Slytherin, it was quite the show. Draco even had the nerve to storm out of the hall early and Pansy was far from pleased about it.”
“Trust me I don’t forget it lightly. But she was sobbing, and I’m not mean enough to just leave her there! Besides, we’re still kids and she keeps Malfoy as company. Who’s to say she’s not just scared and looking to protect herself?” Ron shook his head in disbelief.
“I’m sorry are you actually trying to defend Pansy fucking Parkinson right now? When did we fall into an alternate universe where you stand up for a pureblood like her?” Ron looked to Harry for backup and he gave an unconvincing, “Yeah Hermione.”
“What did I say about no disruptions? Or would you like to share your conversation with the rest of us?
“Ron don’t be rude,” Harry interjected. “Why wouldn’t Krum want to go with Hermione? She’s smart, and capable, and fairly nice looking.”
“Pansy!” He called as he tried to catch up with her. He lengthened his stride and fell into step beside her. “Hey Pans,” he said hesitantly.
“Playing the fool again, are we? Is that your only defense mechanism? Can’t hold your own in a duel to save your life so might as well just play stupid.” The usual bite of Malfoy’s remarks were softened by Harry’s own exasperation.
“I mean, he’s right unfortunately!” Ron exclaimed. “But it’s not like me or mum has the extra Galleons to get a pair of proper ones, especially on such short notice. Maybe that’s what making getting a date so complicated, no one wants to be seen with me in my nan’s old robes.” Harry almost chuckled at that image, but choked it back down at the slightly pained look on Ron’s face.
“Don’t cause scenes in the Great Hall and I will, ferret.” Malfoy’s eyes flashed in a moment of fear, and Harry smirked. Moody’s lesson wouldn’t soon be forgotten by the slytherin. With a shove, Harry was pushed back to the floor, his glasses narrowly missing another fracture. Hermione would not be pleased if he asked her to fix them again. He wanted to reach for his wand, at the very least stun the slytherin but it lay out of reach among his textbooks. Instead, he twisted back towards Malfoy with a good ol’ fashioned right hook. The hit took him by surprise, giving Harry a moment to stand and right his glasses.
CONTENT WARNING: Within Draco's POV there is a depiction of a panic attack, please be aware if that may be triggering to you. This one took a little longer and isn't all that but I hope you enjoy!
“I should hex you for that,”Draco reached a hand towards his jawline. “but I have more important uses for my time. Stay away or you won’t be as lucky next time, scarface.”
“You couldn’t smell a mandrake from boomslang skin if they were labeled!” Hermione chided. As the pair began to bicker further about the strength of Ron’s nose, (Hermione was, of course, right on this one) Harry turned his attention back to the slytherin side of the hall. Malfoy was staring intently at him and he resisted the urge to turn and see if there was something behind him. He stuffed a bit of pastry in his mouth and when he looked back up Malfoy’s eyes were still on him, glaring. A yawn built its way up Harry’s throat and he turned back to his friends.
“Great thanks,” Harry said stepping into the room. “Everything good with you?”
“Relax Harry,” Ginny smiled, “I’m not judging. The only one being pigheaded about you and Malfoy is my stupid brother.”
“Ron!” Hermione’s voice was sharp with rebuke. “Draco saved Harry’s life. If he hadn’t disarmed Rowle………”
“Merry Christmas Draco.”
“No – I’m wearing pj bottoms.”
The cottage was already full of people when Harry arrived. He saw Neville talking to Seamus, who was now structural engineer in the Restoration of Magical Buildings department, Luna was chatting to George, Arthur and Molly were with Minerva McGonagall and Bill and Fleur were outside on the patio with Hagrid who was far too tall to fit in the low ceilinged cottage. There were several other wizards and witches chatting in groups that Harry vaguely recognized, he thought that they must be work colleagues of Hermione or Ron, but he could not see Hermione or Ron anywhere.
“What do you mean just for now?”
Harry returned carrying his laptop. He placed it on the coffee table facing his friends. “I found these photos from the show and some videos too. You can see us in some of them.”
Harry spent the rest of the day completing his reports before filing them for evaluation with the Auror Review Committee, and it was fully dark by the time he closed up his office and made his way to the main level to floo home. The house was quiet when he arrived in the floo in the dining room at twelve Grimmauld Place. He had modernized some parts of the house; the kitchen, living room, dining room, a couple of bedrooms and bathrooms, but the house was so big that he had just closed off all the rooms he didn’t use, leaving them alone until he could get around to working on them.
In large block letters Snape wrote LOSER.
“How did your date go with the guy from the accidental magic reversal squad?” Hermione asked. “He was cute.”
“I’m fine, I was just getting another drink.” Harry tried to move but Draco pulled him closer to him.
Draco entered from the bathroom fully dressed, hair pulled back in the messy bun that Harry liked so much.  “What are you two talking about?”
“You always were an insolent cur,” Rowle sneered. “Because of you I lost my standing with the Dark Lord and now you are going to pay.” He noticed Draco by Harry’s side. “Malfoy? You’re with Potter?” Rowle spat in Draco’s face. “Traitorous fucker. I heard they turned you into a squib, you and your bitch of a mother.”
“Draco struggled with guilt too,” Luna said, “it took him a long time to understand which guilt he should own and which guilt did not belong to him.”
Draco closed the box. “Thank you but I won’t need it. I’m not doing magic.”
It was just after midnight when Harry reached the Gryffindor common room and to his surprise Hermione and Ron were sitting in chairs by the fire.
Harry’s jaw dropped. “You mean –“
Harry had a flashback of Pansy stroking Draco’s hair on the Hogwarts Express at the start of sixth year.
Ginny was now the star player for the Holyhead Harpies and  Harry still felt somewhat guilty at how he and Ginny had broken up. They had tried to rekindle their romance after the war but neither were in a good place emotionally or psychologically, and although they went on a few dates Harry just didn’t have the same feelings for her, so after another huge row he broke things off. It was a short time later that Harry finally admitted to himself that he was gay. He had always felt awkward kissing Ginny, and he found the sex mundane and unsatisfying, it never really excited him. He was becoming increasing attracted to men and, after a drunken one night stand with a guy Harry met at a Quidditch match, he knew he was gay. He wished he could have had admitted that earlier rather than putting Ginny through the additional stress of their messy relationship. It had not been easy coming out to his friends but they had all been supportive and accepted who he was without any questions.
“They show off your pert behind darling,” Pansy said. “It’s a magnificent behind, don’t you think Harry?”
“We should go,” Draco yawned, “its late.” He rolled off the sofa and began hunting around for his shirt.
Harry stepped into a softly lit entrance hall and was immediately swallowed up in Draco’s hug.
“She’s a clothing designer, lives in Paris, but actually she’s coming over to London today to see my show tonight. She’s the only person I’ve kept in constant contact with.”
“Draco killed my
Harry stared at Draco in amazement. “You are that skilled at Occlumency?”
Harry heard the floo flare as Hermione and Ron left, he was embarrassed at his outburst and gave Neville a sheepish grin.
Harry breath stuck in his chest, Draco stood naked in front of him, he was exquisite, his lean body was perfect, sculptured like a Greek god that Harry remembered from his history classes at his Muggle school.
“Isn’t your mother going to get her magic restored?”
“Oh come on, ferret face is more a pet name, like pumpkin or sugarplum.”
“That’s what the green roses mean.”
Harry recalled Luna saying the same thing about Draco. “What about you, are you using magic again?”
“Wow, thanks, that’s great!”
Hermione and Ron exchanged knowing looks.
“Thank you,” Harry found it hard to talk around the lump in his throat. “Thank you to all of you, that was truly wonderful. Merry Christmas to you all.”
“Oh, well, friends is good.” She turned back to face Harry. “How are you Harry? It’s been an age since I last saw you.”
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco. “That’s the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.”
“Draco! He’s awake!” Hermione squeaked.
be rather than the person I was
Draco grinned. “The Boy Who Turned Out To Be A Twat. I kind of like that better than The Boy Who Lived.”
Draco smiled. “I’m not upset, just overwhelmed.”
wand I could kill Voldemort. You helped us defeat him Draco, you were the reason I could kill him, the reason we are all still alive.”
“Ok I’ll watch it, but if its shit I’m going to pick something else.”
“Malfoy. Malfoy please look at me.”
Harry dropped Draco’s arm and slid to the ground to sit facing the Slytherin who was rubbing his arm and staring at the floor. “What just happened?”
In his mind Harry pictured Draco’s long, slim fingers gripping him, stroking him. He moaned at the image.
Harry was delighted with his gifts that included several pairs of new socks, the latest book in the Angus Stormman ‘
“Do you think you could ever go back to Hogwarts?” Harry asked hesitantly as they lay together in Draco’s old bed.
.” Harry quoted from Draco’s song.
“That is a guilt you do need to own,” Luna smiled, “so the easiest way to resolve the feeling is to tell them about Draco.”
Harry choked on his drink.
“Happy Christmas.” Hermione smiled, “It’s good to see you up and about Harry. I hope he was a good patient Draco.”
“Ronald Weasley, you are disgusting,” Hermione huffed. “I simply cannot fathom how your mind works.”
“Really?” Harry was surprised. “I thought that there would be professors lining up to come to Hogwarts.”
Draco stared out at the Manor. “Are you asking me whether I will stay in the Muggle world or will I come back to the wizarding world?”
Harry’s eyes were drawn back to the photo, Malfoy was seriously gorgeous, he looked very much like his father but with an elegance and serenity that Lucius had never possessed. Harry swallowed hard,
Harry asked not quite ready to jump into the topic of Draco straight away. “You have some dirt on your face, you might want to clean it off.”
******************************************************************************
“I can show you a video if you would like?” Walter asked.
Harry traded places, he changed into his red flannel pj bottoms, washed his face and cleaned his teeth, by the time he had finished Draco was already in bed. Harry climbed in next to him, Draco turned out the light and reached for Harry in the darkness. Their lips met, the kiss was deep, slow, passionate, Harry could feel Draco’s length pressing against him, he pushed his hips forward and was surprised when Draco pulled away.
Hermione ground her teeth with frustration. “You won’t take my advice on the state of your relationship but you do want it on whether or not to have a party. Honestly Harry sometimes I really do want to strangle you.”
“Here, this might help.” Walter leaned over Harry’s shoulder to tap at the laptop keys giving Harry a waft of unpleasant body odor.
Draco in flip flops :)
Bill chucked over a large lumpy parcel to Draco, Harry knew exactly what it contained just by looking at it. Draco looked somewhat nervous as he opened it, he pulled apart the paper to reveal a large green hand knitted sweater with a silver D embroidered on the front.
“You did that D, you have become someone different.” Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head.
“I also remember you sneaking around the corridors at night and directly disobeying teachers,” Draco laughed.
Hermione’s smile faded and Ron’s face drained of all colour.
Kreacher attempted a bow but again toppled over, Ron picked him up setting him back on his feet and the elf scurried back to the kitchen clutching his coin.
“I love you my little Gryffindork, you have had my heart for so many years. It started with your green eyes, turning my heart forever green.” Draco gently wiped away the tears with a long finger. “It doesn’t matter to me which world I’m in. I don’t need to choose, the choice is already made, my world is whichever world you are in. You are my world.”
“Yes,” Walter replied, “and very unexpected it was too. You are familiar with the Muggle internet?”
“I know Tilly, I know, but I’m scared.”
“Hi,” Harry said feeling uncomfortable. “I brought you both a gift, you know, to celebrate your engagement.”
“I want to taste you Harry,” Draco said running a long, delicate finger across Harry’s mouth, “I want you in my mouth and taste you.”
Harry was in his office on the following Thursday morning when another envelope was delivered to his desk by a Wizengamot clerk. Harry immediately recognized the writing as belonging to Draco. Harry had been so busy with work the past week that he hadn’t given too much thought to the blonde although he had featured in another wanking session a few nights previously. He tentatively opened the envelope and pulled out the short letter accompanied by a small card.
It was Sunday morning. Harry had spent all day Saturday finishing clearing out the bedroom he had started the previous weekend and it was now ready to be painted and furnished. That would have to be a task for another day as Ron and Hermione had sent an owl last night asking Harry to come over for lunch. Harry had decided he would tell them about Draco. Luna was right, however they reacted to the news was their issue, Harry was not responsible for how they felt about his relationship but he hoped they would be supportive. He stepped into the fireplace, threw the floo powder and called out to go to Jeram Cottage.
The thought of food made Harry almost throw up on the spot. “No, no food. I just need more sleep.”
Harry was walking down a street lined with Muggle shops when a florist shop caught his eye, he stopped to gaze at the beautiful array of flowers and there in the window was a bucket containing pale green roses. Harry knew green roses had some special significance to Draco and he thought it would make a lovely welcome home gift.
“What are you talking about?” Ron said. “We don’t even have a car or a dog.”
“It was actually quite good,” Hermione answered, “if you like that kind of thing.”
“Does he make you happy?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have to let go of me.” Draco said through gritted teeth. “For the love of Merlin just let go.”
Harry moaned as Draco nipped playfully at his ear and ran his hands up and down Harry’s chest under his sweatshirt.
“Shit, fuck, I’m sorry Draco, fuck.” Harry fumbled with the door of the cab and tumbled inside.
“Hermione told me how he much he did to save your life and how distraught he was. Even Ron was impressed.”
Harry wasn’t going to argue with Draco, he needed to Draco as much as Draco needed him.
“I know we will.”
Whilst Rowle’s attention was on Draco Harry lifted his wand to release a stunning spell but Rowle had anticipated the move and dodged out the way.
“So he made a life in the Muggle world where magic doesn’t exist,” Neville said turning over what Harry had told him in his mind. “Where his past doesn’t define him, where people wouldn’t shun him for being a Malfoy, where he could be himself.”
Harry gave Neville a grateful smile. “Thanks Nev. Luna said he’s changed and I think he has, I really do.”
Dean Street Studio was tucked away between a lobster roll bistro and a high-end patisserie shop on Dean Street, not too far from The Leaky Cauldron. The studio had a rich history of recording Muggle artists, most of whom Harry had never heard of, although Take That and Spandau Ballet were names he recognized. Draco was there to record the vocals on ‘
“That is true Harry, but you can’t tell him what you don’t know.”
The doors to the hospital wing banged open making Harry jump his heart pounding in his throat. Snape strode in face thunderous followed by pinched lipped McGonagall and trailing them looking flustered was Fudge.
“Oh dear, that’s sooner than expected. And not quite the results we were planning for. Still what is done is done.” Came Narcissa voice from behind him.
“Right, now that I can fucking think properly without my stupid cock getting in the way, Mind telling me what the Hell is going on?” Sirius said.
Harry figured half of the fascination was the fact this was what a boy’s chest was meant to look like. Not the freaky bony skin covered skeleton thing that Harry was. Harry still deeply hated the sight of his body and had insisted that he be covered from neck to ankle at all times. That way he wasn’t burdening anyone else with the grouse sight.
“Not currently no.”
“Thank you Kreacher.” Harry watched the elf hobble towards the kitchen then took the stairs up to his bedroom.
“He was forced into a lot of that stuff Nev, his father conditioned him to be just like him, Draco never really had a choice to be anything other than who he was raised to be.”
“Bloody hell Nev,” Ron laughed, “glad you weren’t my teacher! Come on, dig in guys, I’m starving.”
Harry’s didn’t think he could look Draco in the face.
Harry’s body went limp as the spell reversed the paralysis, he reached out a hand to Draco, it was red and wet with blood, his blood.
“Stunning,” Harry said, “absolutely stunning.” He was talking about both the shirt and Draco.
“Fucking hell,” Ron said, “they really are popular.”
There was a split second of calm as Harry plunged into Draco before his orgasm took him. Hips bucking he released his load into the blonde, wave upon wave of pleasure rippling through his body, his cock pulsing, his whole body filled with the buzz of his orgasm.
Harry takes time out for a coffee and hears something very strange.
“Great, see you Friday night,” Hermione said over her shoulder as she walked away, “I’ll set the floo to be open for you at seven.”
Draco slowly turned around. Their eyes met. “I have feelings for you too Malfoy, I just didn’t recognize them for what they were until now.”
He smiled hesitantly. “Hi Harry, I’m very glad you came. It’s really nice to see you.”
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders to steady himself as he lifted himself up then pushed himself back down moaning as Harry’s cock hit his prostrate.
Harry’s temper flared. “You don’t pick who you fall in love with, it just happens.”
“I don’t care. Draco is a filthy fucking Death Eater.” Ron shook off Hermione’s arm, his face now crimson with rage.
“It’s ok, I know the way.” Harry called out to Hermione with a wink at Ron who gave him a grateful smile.
“How’s Ron?” Harry asked. Although Hermione and Ron shared a house in London he didn’t see as much of his friend who now managed the chain of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and took frequent business trips to oversee operations.
Malfoy drifted away and was immediately engulfed by a cluster of people all vying for his time; reporters, photographers, record management, it would seem that he would be working for a good while before he could call it a night.
Harry was torn. It would be much easier to dump Draco and patch things up with Ron, but that was not Harry’s personality, Harry Potter did not give in easily. Draco meant more to him than anyone one he had ever dated, he knew this was special and he was not about to give him up.
“You don't have to choose, consider the friendship over.”
Pansy tweaked the sleeves and stepped back. “What do you think Harry?”
As he exited the shop he received a text from Draco, he was home and just taking a quick shower, Harry replied that he was on his way and would be there in about twenty minutes. The nearer he got to Draco’s building the more nervous he got, this was their first real ‘date’ and he hoped he wouldn’t mess it up or say something twatish. Harry found the address Draco had given him, it was a block of luxury apartments overlooking Camden Lock, he located Draco’s name on the directory by the front door and pressed the corresponding button. There was a buzz and the front door opened to let him into the foyer, Draco lived on the top floor so Harry took the elevator up to the fourteenth floor, found the door to apartment 1422 and knocked.
Harry was astonished. “You must meet loads of girls, and you’re really hot.…..”
It was tough on both Harry and Draco. The saw each other as much as possible but with Draco’s tour schedule taking him away for weeks at a time they spent more time apart than together. Now Draco was using magic it was easier, Draco had surprised Harry by apparating into his bedroom on several occasions so that they could spend the night together before he apparated back to his hotel in the morning. The tour had now moved on into Europe, apparating was not an option over such large distances so it had been weeks since Harry had seen his boyfriend. Draco’s birthday was coming up, a few days after the tour finished, and Harry wanted to make it special for him. Another good memory to add to the other memories they were making. He had an idea but wanted to run it by Hermione first.
“I’m sorry you went through all that D.”
“That would be the dabberblimps,” Luna remarked, “they get in your ears.”
“Of course I don’t.” Harry hissed. “And I’m NOT obsessed. He’s acting weird, surely you can see that?”
“Yeah fine, but don’t ask me to call him
Harry’s cock stiffened, his pj bottoms tenting from his erection, he tried to hide it but Draco had already noticed and proceeded to lick more yogurt from his fingers.
“I’m rather busy, I have a number of research papers to review and then there is a rather interesting debate on whether permanent Portkeys could be used as a wizard travel network.”
“Not nearly as exciting as it sounds.” Draco poured the wine. “I love playing music, I love doing the shows, but the touring is tedious and exhausting. I understand you are taking over as Herbology Professor next year, congratulations”
Pansy smiled approvingly. “Good, now for the trousers.”
“It’s a mixing desk, it where the engineers take all the separate channels, vocals, backing vocals, guitars, drums, and mix them all together to make the finished track. There’s computer software that can edit, adjust timing and even pitch. It’s the process that makes us sound good.”
“For the love of Merlin Potter, just fucking do it.”
“Malfoy can sing, I’ll give him that, but he’s still a tosser,” Ron said.
that Dudley used to sing, or rather scream, right in Harry’s face. Apparently Queen was a good band to like, much to Harry’s relief, but he was grateful when Draco led him back his dressing room where they were alone.
Draco’s body was slim and toned, stomach flat, hipbones protruding, his stiff erection standing proud of a thick thatch of blonde hair.
Kreacher took the flowers. “Dinner will be served in five minutes.”
Someone knocked on the door. “Curtain up in fifteen minutes Mister Malfoy.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open in shock. “What? Why?”
“They might be a little bit crushed now.”
“I guess that leads me to ask….are we together Harry? Or is this just a ‘thing’?”
Harry shrugged. “I was in the library.”
Draco disappeared behind the back curtain, the chanting from the crowd was getting louder and louder, and then went silent as the tiny backlights burst into life. Harry jumped as the speaker next to him started to play the intro melody, and jumped again when Draco’s voice came booming out of it. The crowd roared and the band began to play, Harry could feel the music through his feet as the stage vibrated, his ears ringing from the noise of band and crowd. Harry hadn’t thought to bring his wand after the problems at the previous show, but to his relief he saw Pansy had hers and was casting a muffling spell around them. Harry was entranced by Malfoy; he couldn’t take his eyes off of him as he ran, jumped and high kicked his way around the stage, and evidently Pansy’s anti-splitting spell worked as despite the acrobatics the trousers held up. The crowd was going wild, and even though it was a much smaller venue than the previous night Harry couldn’t imagine getting up in front of that many people and not be scared shitless, yet Draco was totally in control, he was fearless, undaunted and utterly mesmerizing. The time sped by and before he knew it the stage had darkened and Draco appeared beside them gulping down a bottle of water.
Ginny led Harry over to Arthur and Molly. It was an awkward conversation, however both Arthur and Molly assured him that they only wanted him to be happy and if Draco made him happy they were pleased for him. Harry glanced around finally spotting Ron and Hermione standing in the corner talking in hushed voices, he took a deep breath and made his way over to them.
The last time Harry remembered seeing Pansy was when she tried to persuade the Hogwarts students to hand him over to Voldemort.
Thank you for staying with it until the end :)
“Amusing jackass.” Draco corrected.
“’I hate this Hermione but I’m not giving up Draco.”
Draco shrugged. “I’m a hoarder.”
’ I’m sorry Harry, but you have to come on your own.”
Rowle’s jinx hit Draco in the back, sending him sprawling face down in the grime and rubbish littering the alley floor.
“You look happy,” Hermione said as Harry dropped into the seat opposite her at the coffee shop. “I’m assuming it has to do with a certain blonde haired Slytherin?”
Harry scowled at his friend. “I thought we agreed that you were not going to call him names.”
“Snape left me his house in his will,” Draco said from the kitchen where he was arranging the roses in a vase “I tried living there for a while but there were too many painful memories. I sold the house and bought this place.”
“Ok, we’ve said thank you now let’s go.” Ron finished his drink in two large gulps.
“I have never desired to be a teacher, and now that I am free of it, I am most disinclined to return. I have left a list of possible replacement for you to go over. I wouldn’t get Slughorn out of retirement. That man is a menace to teaching.“
And who knows maybe they will cross paths again on another fic somewhere done the path.
Dumbledore stopped them just outside the front door. He turned and Harry could see his mouth moving but couldn’t hear a single thing over the sound of his heart galloping in his chest. Dumbledore continued to talk as Harry's panting increased and his eyes widened, his entire body flooded with fear and taught with tension, ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
“It’s a muggle thing, it’s a psychological response that occurs when kidnap victims bond with their captors. It can occur in as little as a couple of days or over weeks or months. Since Harry has been with Mr Malfoy for four months, that was plenty of time for it to happen.”
Author runs around furiously. The order of glitter had still not arrived and the bits of old fluff they had shoved in the story refused to stick to the last part of this chapter.
Dumbledore was tried in absence as he was still currently in the wind. His charges were many, Tom working in the shadows made sure that everything that could be thrown at him was. The main ones were Kidnapping, multiple counts of child abuse, leading a child abuse ring. Multiple counts of supplying a minor to abusers. Gaslight and grooming a minor. Multiple account of ignoring abuse in his charges. Aiding in the torture that turned a magical into an Obscurial.
Harry still didn’t know what to think about Voldemort. He was the wizarding worlds big Evil he had been told to fight, the reason he didn’t have parents and grew up with the Dursley’s and Harry had fought off different versions of him in two of his school years.
“Severus?”
Severus was most reluctant to pause the saga once they had finished the first part of it, but his throat was becoming quite swollen and he knew he was done for the day. He explained that to Harry who looked mightily disappointed but let him leave without any hassle. Severus walked away concluding that though he completely bollocks up the conversation even with all his notes and prep work. He at least could draw the smallest amount of comfort in the knowledge that his storytelling skills were still up to par.
“Gees mate what was that?” Ron grumbled as he got up.
“I am yours, and you are mine,” Severus agreed.
He surfaced again to heated whispers. His body felt like it weighed a ton and there was no way that he could control even the smallest part. It also felt like his eyes were glued closed. Unable to move he listen as the words faded in and out to the argument.
“It tickles a little but Draco does a good job, See?” He pulled off both of his slippers and Severus saw more rainbow nails these glittered. And yet Harry still hadn’t repeated a colour.
“I have to know,” Severus began without any preamble, his nerves and stress about this memory had made him completely forget the normal bowing and scraping that he performed before Tom. Who wanted to encourage this behaviour, so made sure he acted like Severus just coming in and talking to him like an equal was completely normal.
(See the end of the chapter for
A hand appeared it gripped hold of the rugged fur, followed by an arm, and then the head of Severus’ son was visible. Harry was also in terrible shape. Easy to see as he didn’t have a stitch of clothing on him. The only thing adorning him was the Torc Draco had given him. He wasn’t back to the walking skeleton he had been when he used the portkey. But he wasn’t much past it. If Severus had to guess he would say Harry was at the same point he had been just after they used the healing web on him. The Order had undone all of their months of hard work, started by the stay in Grimmauld Place, the rest of it was consumed to feed to power needed to form an Obscurus.
Harry stared at Tom incredulously. There was no way Severus had wild hair like this. He couldn’t even picture it, it was so impossible.
“I am never too busy,” Tom purred.
The whole hall gasped as one turned to look at Harry. White-faced Harry slumped down doing his best to disappear.
He watched as Harry closed his mouth looking a little sheepish. Severus sighed then looked back at his notes, he had not expected Harry to talk at this stage and so with all the questions he had lost his spot. Severus felt the first hints of annoyance and nerves entering his bloodstream as the question was not asked in the correct order. They were all over the place and huge chunks of information had been missed or skipped. He knew that even though he was itching to sort out the information and put it into its correct place, it would be best if he just summarised it otherwise they would end up being here for ages the information instead of being concise and detail would become hopelessly confusing.
They were forced to stop once the last of the web disintegrated but they had done enough. Harry was no longer sitting on death’s door. He was still severely malnourished but was no longer a living skeleton. they had also pulled nearly all of his organ back from the brink of complete failure. And his condition was stable once more. The earliest they could place him in another Healing web would be a week. Not due to the lack of supplies but because the body needed that long to reset before being exposed to that particular magic again. The longer they could stretch out the healing webs the better it would be for Harry in the long run. Even if it meant that his initial healing was dragged out longer.
“But I can’t get naked in front of all these people. It’s not right!”
“Even though I’ve already done stuff?”
Blaise was the next to arrive, and he collapsed with a huff into a neighbouring armchair. This made sense. Harry as the ugliest was the quickest in the shower. Once he had done the basic wash of his body and hair, there was no point in staying in any longer. Nothing was going to change how he looked. Blaise was an alright looking bloke, so, therefore, he should logically take longer. Understandable, if you were blessed with as much fitness as Draco, you would need the longest time to make sure you took proper care of all the perfection. It wasn’t a case of being vain, but of respecting and looking after what Merlin gave you.
Mr Malfoy raised an eyebrow as he looked at Harry, he seemed to see something in Harry’s face because the eyebrow came back down and understanding bloomed in his eyes.
Tom nodded his head dismissing him. He knew the man had a lot of prickly pride and would need to go off in private to put himself together. None the less Tom privately gambled that Severus would be back before the weeks end seeking the answers. Sure, enough not even two days past before Severus was once more knocking on his office door.
He put his glasses on and sat up, trying to move quietly so as not to bother Snape. He had to keep checking on Harry’s health during the night which was why they were sharing a bedroom. Surprisingly Harry had yet to object to this. He kept waiting for his mind to react negatively to this whole thing. Merlin knew had this happened the summer before last he would have been screaming bloody murder and trying to escape, but the last school year had been a huge drain on him, and not to mention the end of the torment. Then this summer had been the worse by far. So pretty much he had had a year of the so call light treating him with suspicion, calling him a liar and cheat letting three whole school turn on him. Then abandoning him to the muggles. In this twisted version, he guessed it made sense that the Dark were the ones to care for him and look after him.
“You foolish man”
Feeling confident that he had everything he needed, Severus headed out to the bedroom that both Harry and he were staying in. Knocking on the door he entered and saw Harry sitting on the top of the made bed. He was quietly relieved to see that his godson was currently not glued to Harry’s side. All the better then. He wouldn’t have to ask Draco to leave.
“What?”
“Ok, Shite, I so not equip to do this talk but fuck it, I’m the only one available. Listen up, Prongslett, I’m going to try to explain things to you. So first off, when Snape said people who love each other do that, he wasn’t talking about family members, he meant lovers.”
“You’re not the only one with some creature blood in you,” Narcissa continued calmly. “The Blacks are known to produce an Eros every generation or so. I am one and it seems my son is another. Although he has come into his inheritance rather early. No doubt due the sate poor Harry is in. Mates in danger or poor health have been known to trigger an early transformation.”
Severus ducked his head, still not used to having Tom care about his wellbeing. He turned and left, hoping that he had read the cues right. He was going to chalk the hand holding to a master looking after his servant. Severus had never had a caring master before so he wasn’t sure exactly how they would act, but surely hand-holding was part of the requirements. The image of Tom holding hands with Lucius popped into his head. Instantly bitterness and sour jealously flooded him. Severus shook his head, dismissing the image and told himself to pull it together.
Something rushed past him and Severus found himself looking at his godson who was hovering in front of Harry’s bed, blocking Severus view.
Tom knew he would need to give Dumbledore something to focus his attentions on freeing up Tom to move in the background. He contemplated what use his followers in Azkaban could have. Since he was planning to get Lucius out, he could tweak his plans and add a couple more people to the jailbreak. Although his original and still currently the best plan was to get Lucius out legally. He would have a easier time of it if he wasn’t on the run from the Aurors.
Dumbledore gave him a hard shake.
Once the ex Aurors were taken away the next lot was a bunch of civilians. Their charges included vigilante, stalking, kidnapping, abuse of a minor, failing to report the abuse of a minor, aiding and abetting abuse of a minor and causing a magical child to become an Obscurial. The crowd was a lot more vengeful when these were read. When it came time for the accused to offer their defence Tom couldn’t help his eyebrow raising at the sheer amount of lunacy that came pouring out. He hated to say it, but he was reluctantly impressed with Dumbledore achieving the amount he had with such stupidity in his followers. They were sentenced to two years in Azkaban and could not be in the presence of minors for the rest of their life. The last part seemed to be the worse punishment for Molly Weasley. Her youngest two children were taken from her care and would be placed with foster families. She had tried to have them placed with their older siblings but was rebuffed as all her children were members of the illegal Order of the phoenix. She wouldn’t see either of them again until they reach their maturity. The same rule would apply to any grandchildren born into the family.
“I’m sure Blaise meant nothing by it, he didn’t know that we are mated.”
Knowing that no one could see his face Tom allowed himself to grin savagely pleased. All the hurt and torment that he and other children had suffered under Dumbledore rein was finally being paid for. The Dementor retreated, leaving behind the still living but soulless corpse. The crowd broke into a discussion on what to do with the living body. After much toing and froing three quick brawls and a debate, they agreed they would place the body in Knockturn’s duelling hall for people to practice their spellwork on until it lived no more.
Draco pulled out the black bottle and Severus resigned himself to the last scheme his son was dragging him into.
“Um... no?” Harry replied, surprised that Severus did, in fact, wash his hair and that it was only oily because he covered it in hair product.
Both the times he got to spend with his son, even if Harry was dancing around the subject at the moment, and unlooked-for the time spent with the Dark Lord. Tom, his mind whispered rebelliously. No, no, he had no right to address his Lord with his first name, not even in the depths of his mind. He needed to remember his place. It wasn’t helped with the way the Dark Lord was treating him like he was a valued acquaintance or even dare he say it, friend. He went out of his way to help Severus come to terms with what Lily had done, and engaging him in multiple fascinating talks, and had even on two occasions come with Severus on his potion gathering walks. But Severus knew better, he was a loyal servant and nothing more. He needed to stop the foolish notion of rising above his station and not encourage it so it did not take root and grow in his mind.
Severus had already lowered his occlumency barriers and was helpfully thinking of the time period in question. Tom had to do several passes before he found the spot where Severus mind had buried a memory. Carefully he nudged it out and together they watch what happened.
“Really? Even though I messed everything up?”
“Who healed me?”
“Ah,” Severus paused, he wanted to say he didn’t need his nails done but he could see that Draco had metallic silver on his nails and glancing out the window showed him the Grimm’s nails badly painted in red and gold. Harry must have done Sirius, as the Grimm was most reluctant to have anyone else touch him. Thankfully, an escape hatch occurred to him.
Seeing that nothing else was forthcoming Severus picked up the parchment checking the points marked out so he could get back on track.
“No child, this is not a situation where you must reply the right answer. I am offering you my apologies. It's up to you what you do with it. You don’t have to accept it or answer it if you don’t want to. You don’t have to say you have forgiven me. Not until you have had time to really think about it. That is not something I can demand but instead is something I have to hope for.”
“My Lord?”
Shyly Harry broke the hug and offered his hands for inspection. Every single nail was painted a bright colour, not a single one of them the same.
Harry’s shoulders sunk and he curled into himself a bit.
“Had enough you fucking sick perverts,” Sirius ranted. “Have you all got your jollies staring at a child? Got enough material for your fucking wank bank? Good, then piss off out of here.”
Draco snorted. “Not when you have the hangover of the century. You looked awful earlier, Pansy was infinitely more attractive at that point.”
“But it was your dream job.” Ron said with a shocked expression on his face.
Draco smirked. “Unlike you I found the art of Occlumency a rather easy skill to master.”
Harry’s palms were slick with sweat and he gripped his wand tighter to prevent it slipping from his hand.
“I knew him from school,” Harry said slurring his words slightly. “Me, Draco and Pansy all went to the same school.”
*************************************************
Harry sighed with relief. “Great, be right back.”
“Umm, so it seems,” Hermione said regaining her composure. “A rather talented one by all accounts.”
Harry shot back a reply.
“About time too, Draco’s talents are wasted in the Muggle world, he is one of the most talented wizards I have ever met.”
Harry grinned. “It’s big.”
Harry pushed the sweaty hair off Draco’s face and kissed him. “I think we could probably both do with a shower now.”
But there was no answer, Draco was sound asleep in Harrys arms.
“I might tease but I always deliver. Come on, eat up, I want to show you Camden Market, you’ll love it.”
“What?” Harry stared at Luna. “What song?”
“Shut up!” Harry laughed. “Tell me about the other songs, what they mean.”
“Finally got a CD player then?” Draco smirked.
“I know Nev, I know. If you met Draco now you’d see that he’s not who you remember him to be.”
Ron pointed his fork at Harry. “I do not want details alright? I don’t know what pampering is exactly and I don’t want to know.”
“Do we have to do this? Surely –“
– rock track
“Looks like you are stuffed Harry,” Neville grinned, “no way you can win from that position. How are you feeling? Ron said you were pretty messed up.”
Harry checked the time. “You went on stage much later last night.”
Harry couldn’t talk so he just nodded his assent. Draco stepped forward until their faces were just inches apart, he hesitated slightly then cupped Harry’s face in his hand and lowered his lips to meet Harry’s. The touch was gentle and soft, like butterfly wings ghosting across his mouth, nothing like the wet and sloppy first kiss he had shared with Cho. Draco drew away but Harry wanted more, he ran his hand through the blonde hair and pulled Draco back in. Their lips moved together, Harry parted his slightly and immediately felt Draco’s tongue swirl over them. The sensation was so powerful that Harry groaned and pushed his tongue into Draco’s mouth eliciting a groan in response. The kiss deepened; mouths mashed together, teeth clacking against one another, tongues fighting for control. Draco moaned against his mouth and Harry’s cock grew hard at the sound. The physical and emotional intensity pushed all other thoughts from Harry’s mind; for once he was living in the moment, for once he was allowing himself to be there in the present just surrendering his mind and body to experience something for himself.
to clean them both up then settled in the circle of Draco’s arms, sleep coming swiftly and deeply.
The months sped by. Draco had gone back to work as soon as the Christmas celebrations were over, the album was released the first week of March and the band went straight out on tour. Harry went back to work as an Auror but he would be leaving soon, he had found a new position that he knew would make him much happier so he was just biding his time until he could leave.
“Please stay for dinner,” Harry said, “we don’t have to talk about magic.”
“Let go of me Potter.”
“Well that was a strange experience,” Pansy said, walking into the dressing room from the hospitality suite. “I needed a pee but Draco was in the shower so I had to use the public Muggle bathrooms. I don’t know how Draco does it, living with Muggles the whole time.”
******************************************************************************
” Draco’s spell knocked Rowle’s wand from his hand. The dark wizard’s eyes went wide with shock when he realized that Draco had disarmed him. He turned and ran leave Harry and Draco alone in the alley.
“Fine.” Harry’s temper flared “If my relationship with Draco means you want to sacrifice our friendship so be it.”
“I don’t believe that, there is always a way. I’ll find a way.”
“They do but they have other meanings too. I’m sure you’ve worked out what the rest of the logo means.”
“I did, that time he regaled me with stories of his gobstone collection.”
Harry handed over the Christmas gifts he had for Ron, Hermione and the rest of the Weasley family. He usually spent Christmas at The Burrow but this year he wanted to spend it with Draco, and he wasn’t entirely sure he would be welcome at the Weasley’s given his relationship with Draco.
“Stop it Draco, that’s not fair.”
“I will, see you next week.”
Harry glanced over at the girls who were excitedly reading a Muggle magazine; he couldn’t make out much except for the words Lumos Solem in large type at the top of the page they were reading.
Harry powered up the laptop and navigated to the web browser to connect to the internet. He knew the basics of ‘surfing the net’ but he had no idea what websites to use so he typed ‘Lumos Solem’ in the Google search bar and pressed enter. His screen immediately filled with links to dozens of sites from the Wikipedia page, to music review sites, video hosting sites and most interestingly an official Lumos Solem band page. Harry clicked on the office band link and was taken to the home page which displayed the band’s logo. The logo consisted of a snake curled around a thorny branch bearing red berries and a light green rose. Harry immediately knew the snake represented Slytherin and the branch was hawthorn, Malfoy’s wand was hawthorn, but he had no idea what the green rose signified. He made a mental note to ask Neville when he saw him on Friday night. He clicked on past the home page to the band’s bio page, the first section was similar to the information on Wikipedia that Walter had shown him so Harry scrolled down to the band member bios. Malfoy’s bio photo was a head and shoulders shot. His almost white hair hung loose around his shoulders spilling over the black shirt he was wearing, which as in the earlier photo, Malfoy wore with the top few buttons undone. His cheekbones were still high and defined but as an adult this made him look elegant rather than the pinched look they gave him as a young boy. Intense grey eyes shimmered like mercury and the thin lips were drawn up into a smile showing a row of perfect white teeth. He was absolutely stunning. Harry had a hard time dragging his eyes away from the photo and forced himself to read the short bio next to it.
It was very late and, with a promise to meet up again soon, the friends parted ways and headed for home.
“What happened Draco,” Harry asked gently, “that made you not ever want to practice magic again?”
“Keep your hair on Harry, I’m only messing with you,” Ron said. “We all just thought you had a bit of a crush on him.”
Harry handed Pansy her wine. “Long queue, lots of people.”
Another long pause.
“Ronald!” Hermione said whacking him with a copy of
“Harry!” Draco sounded far from sick, he sounded drunk. “My little Gryffindork!”
“Kreacher? Where did you get a Christmas tree from?” Harry asked his elf who was directing the house elves, telling them where to drape the garlands and which baubles to hang from which branch.
The blonde smiled sadly. “Harry and Draco is just for now, for this one moment in time.”
“Thanks ‘Mione. I didn’t mean to ruin your day but I needed to tell you.”
“Let me help you Potter.” Snape swirled away to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk. “This is how you spell your name.”
Don't you just love Luna?
Draco laughed. “You don’t want to be pissing off your soon to be wife too much Ron, she throws a mean punch!”
“Did I Draco? It felt more like you were ‘faking it’, pretending to fight for it, it actually felt like you were giving it to me.”
Harry scowled. “You tosser.”
“But –“
“Umm, no.” The clerk sounded nervous and held a large envelope in his hand. “I have been asked to deliver something to you.”
“This place is fantastic,” said Harry, “really fantastic.”
“We will have plenty more best Christmases ever,” Draco said sleepily, “and make lots more good memories.”
The comedown took several minutes, Harry leaned back against the wall with Draco, still seated on his lap, rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Tell me what?” Harry turned back to Ron.
“Do you know why he was at the Ministry ‘Mione?” Harry asked. “I saw him come in but couldn’t tell where he was headed.”
Draco wiped his face. “That’s the problem Harry, there will always be people who use dark magic. You know that, you’re an Auror. You see it every day. I don’t want to be in that world. I cant think of a single reason why I would ever use magic again.”
He still wasn’t sure about meeting him on Saturday but he still had time to back out if he decided he didn’t want to go. Harry set the alarm on his muggle phone, another useful feature that he used, with a yawn he extinguished the lights and settled down to sleep with a smile on his lips.
There was a thirty second silence.
“Sit down D, you are making me dizzy with all that pacing.” Harry stopped Draco pacing by wrapping his arms around him.
Harry slipped out the room, made his way to the bar where he was given a bottle of white wine in an ice bucket and returned to Draco’s room. He was gone less than five minutes but the room was empty, no sign of either Draco or Pansy. Not knowing what to do Harry placed the wine bucket on the table and took one of the poured glasses of red, he was already feeing rather drunk but he was in one of those moods where drinking more seemed a good idea. The door to the bathroom opened billowing out clouds of steam into the dressing room and, through the misty haze, Draco appeared wet from his shower with only a small towel wrapped around his waist.
“That’s it? You just say sorry and it’s all forgotten?”
Neville sat patiently allowing Harry the time to organize his thoughts; as much as Hermione was one of his closest friends she always asked questions and didn’t allow Harry to just think like Neville did. Talking to Ron was out of the question, he was not great at talking about emotions, emotional range of a teaspoon as Hermione had once said, and Harry knew that Ron was one of the people that would not easily accept his relationship with Draco.
‘Thanks again for the potion, I did feel particularly fucked up.”
“Which is why we have to Obliviate each other’s memories of tonight.” Draco said calmly.
“I miss her too. I miss everyone we lost.”
He was debating asking Hermione if she wanted to go to lunch when she called him on the Talkkey asking him to meet her at
“Umm, maybe if you didn’t spread them all over the table there would be room for my cup?” Harry suppressed a smile, he never took offence at Hermione’s nagging, in fact it reminded him of Molly Weasley, which was probably why Ron was immune to it too.
“Feeling better?” Draco asked with a smirk.
“Thanks.” Harry squeezed Hermione’s hands. “I know that me being with Draco sounds crazy but he really has changed, I wish you could both see that. Maybe we could meet him for lunch here next week?”
Harry and Draco stood as the students and staff clapped and cheered. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and smiled. They stood side by side ready to begin their new life together, back where their story started, back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“This is a song I wrote about a friend of mine who is here tonight,” Draco glanced over to the spot where Pansy and Harry were standing. “It’s called ‘My Heart Is Green’.
“Without magic you can’t do things like this.” Harry cast
“Err, right, yes, really deep.” Harry spotted Hermione and Ron having their tickets scanned. Harry’s heart stopped as Hermione’s bag was searched but they only opened it up and peered inside before waving her through.
Draco gave Harry one last smirk and followed Snape into his office. Harry forced himself to focus on the lesson, the last thing he needed was Snape giving him detention, not when he had plans to trail Draco again later that night. With a sigh, Harry turned his attention to his textbook and tried not to think about what Snape would want with Draco and what that might have to do with Draco’s late night wanderings.
“Thank you, it’s very nice to be home.”
“Crap.” Neville scrubbed at his face with his sleeve. “I always forget to check before I go out. One time I had half a dittany bush stuck in my hair at the start of year feast, the kids have never let me forget that.”
Arms wrapped around one another, legs entwined, they slept until the morning light.
The record label had given Draco and the band a few days off over Christmas so Draco was able to spend the time with Harry at the Manor. Harry had received an owl from the Weasleys the previous night inviting him and Draco to Christmas dinner at The Burrow, which both surprised and pleased him.
Draco’s eyes widened with appreciation. “Thank you Neville, that’s really kind of you. Would you like a glass of wine?”
“Prove that can you Potter?” A brief look of panic flashed in Draco’s eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighed with resignation. “I will, I promise. So a surprise party, yes or no?”
Harry slathered more lube over his throbbing cock, he gripped Draco’s hips and lowered him down onto his rock hard erection. He pushed up slightly, working slowly until the head pushed past the tight ring of muscle, Draco hissed as the tip of Harry’s cock penetrated him.
“What are you grinning about Potter? “ Draco said. “I distinctly remember you receiving the sharp edge of Hermione’s tongue on more than one occasion.”
“My place is here,” Harry whispered, “I have a life here.”
Harry finished the last bite of his meal and sat back with his glass of wine. He took a sip and considered Draco over the rim of the glass.
Harry pulled back and looked up into Draco’s sliver grey eyes. “I want to kiss you again.”
Hermione nodded. “Well, I mentioned it to Walter Withernail, he’s one of the Muggle Liaison Officers, and he said he’d look into it.”
He had little time to think on it any further as the girls returned just before Ron and the house lights went down ready for the main act. The crowd began chanting ‘Lumos Solem, Lumos Solem, in the dark we find the light’, to the point where Harry didn’t think he could take it much more, then the crowd plunged into silence as hundreds of small white bulbs lit up the back of the stage twinkling like stars. A haunting melody played through the speakers and Harry was shocked to hear Malfoy’s voice speak over the music.
to be.”

Harry sighed. “But I don’t know how this can ever work out. We live in different worlds, it would be almost impossible for us to maintain a relationship.”
“I would think that boring is what you need after everything you went through at school.”
“Um guys, I have something to tell you too.”
“Master Draco is here,” Kreacher said unnecessarily. “Would Master Draco like some coffee?”
She was not wrong, the shirt fitted Draco like a glove. It emphasized his broad shoulders and narrow waist, the sleeves flowed over his biceps like a waterfall and the end of the V-neck finished an inch above his bellybutton. Draco look incredible in the shirt.
“It’s in their magazine,” Harry hissed at Hermione. “A
“Do you go back there much?” Harry asked.
“What a drama queen!” Seamus snickered. “So what’s going on with him and Ferret Face?”
01.16
Harry laughed “I don’t think we’d do much talking, we’ve not seen each other for weeks.”
“How’s the album coming along?” Harry asked as he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Harry almost threw up the sandwiches he had just eaten. “Draco…I…”
“A war? A real war?” Dan said incredulously. “Where the fuck did you go to school? Bosnia or somewhere?”
“Harry Potter, so good to meet you! I’m Walter.” Walter had a strong handshake and a sweaty palm.
“I’ve missed you,” Harry said kissing Draco's neck.
“That was probably the best Christmas I’ve ever had,” Harry said as he lay in bed with Draco’s arms wrapped round him.
“You have changed my life Harry Potter, changed it so many times, in so many ways. Do you think I could ever live without you in my life?”
“Why did you invite me lunch Draco?”
The chatter of excited voices fell silent as the first years were ushered into the Great Hall. They looked so small in their new robes, young faces shining with fear, hope, longing and excitement as they saw the sorting hat in Headmistress McGonagall’s hands.
“Well the dream does not live up to reality.”
The energy in the room was electric, the fans were jumping, screaming, dancing and singing whilst the band provided the sound of soaring guitars and the pounding drums driving the beat to which the crowd reacted. And, in the middle of it all, was Malfoy. He was leading the performance by running across the stage stopping to play guitar to sections of fans who screamed and yelled at the blonde whilst he shredded the tunes in front of them. Running back to the mic in the middle of the stage, Malfoy sang the tracks with thousands of voice shouting the lyrics along with him. It was incredible. Harry was mesmerized by the sight and sound of Malfoy; the sheer energy as he ran around the stage, the rapport he had with the crowd, the way he slung his guitar around, the way his voice could scream out a rock song but could also softly croon a slow song. Luna was out of her seat swaying dreamily along to the music, she pulled Harry up to join her and soon Harry was clapping and cheering with the rest of the crowd. By the end of the set Hermione and even Ron were on their feet clapping the performance as the band waved and the stage lights flicked off leaving the stage in total darkness. Harry thought it was over but the crowd began to chant ‘Draco, Draco, Draco’ over and over again, several minutes went by and by now the crowd were in a frenzy of chanting and stamping their feet. A single spot light flicked on and the crowd fell quiet as Malfoy stepped forward into the light; he was still drenched in sweat but his hair looked as though he had combed it as it fell in sleek waves over his shoulders and his habitually white skin was tinged pink with the energy he had exerted throughout the show. The band behind him, still in complete darkness, began to play but this time the drums were soft and muted and the guitars acoustic. When Malfoy started to sing it sent shivers down Harry’s spine; the quality of Malfoy’s voice was exquisite as he sang about love and hopelessness, of passions and tears with an anguish that pulled at Harry’s soul. Never in his life had he seen anything so beautiful as Malfoy standing on a darkened stage, lit by a single spot light, eyes closed, hands clasped around the microphone stand, singing a song about lost love and loneliness. The song ended and the stage exploded into life as the stage lights went up and the band launched in to their final song back to electric guitars and thumping drums. The song contained the lyrics which the crowd had been chanting before the show and as Malfoy sang the words ‘Lumos Solem, Lumos Solem, in the dark we find the light’ the crowd used the lights on their phone to hold up towards the stage. The effect was amazing, a sea of lights across the venue waving and bobbing as Malfoy held up his guitar to strum the final chord that brought the show to a close. The house lights came up and the buzz of excited chatter from the audience filled the space that the music had previously occupied.
“A Muggle concert headed by a Death Eater is not my idea of a date.” Ron growled.
“Blimey Harry, I don’t think anything could put me off my food,” Ron said piling his plate high with chicken legs and mashed potatoes. “Not even that time I was puking up slugs. In fact I had a hankering for jellied eels after that.”
Neville groaned. “These kids just seem worse, they are forever jinxing each other, I spend half my time reversing them.”
“Just drink it.”
“I’m not saying we should use them,” Ron grumped, “but it’s cool to have them.”
“Then he’s a lucky boy,” She said with a wink. “I hope he enjoys them, they should last about a week if you take care of them.”
“That’s my old wand,” he whispered, “the one you took from me at the Manor.”
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. As Draco was several inches taller, Harry ended up with his face buried against Draco’s neck. Harry inhaled a scent that was floral but woodsy at the same time, Draco smelt gorgeous. Draco gave him a quick squeeze then let go, Harry was a bit disappointed that he hadn’t asked for a longer hug.
