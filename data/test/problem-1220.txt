He rummages around in the back. Their supply of snacks is almost gone; they’d need to stop for food soon. He manages to extract an opened bag of granola, the top half-heartedly mashed shut with one of those binder clips.
thing to talk about. “I guess. They all have their stories that we will never know.”
He almost laughs when he opens Draco’s Spotify - he has his own playlist. Granted, it’s called
A beat of silence. Harry drags his gaze down from the stars to Draco, and starts as he meets Draco’s gaze. His eyes are wide; Harry can see constellations reflected in his irises, a thousand stars in the spill of Draco’s pupils. For the first time he realizes how close they are - Draco’s hands pressed up at the edge of his seat, Harry’s wrist braced on the console, close enough that all it would take was for Harry to lean closer, to brush his arm against Draco’s -
He doesn’t turn to look as Harry moves beside him, shakes his head at the opened bag of granola. The waves are rough, the water a blur of dark green and grey, edged in ivory foam.
“No - “
“No, like…” Draco trails off. He’s only ever careful words or intoxicated streams of unfiltered thoughts. “Like
Even though he can’t see it, Harry can almost feel the soft smile Draco gives him. He shivers slightly as Draco slowly runs his fingers down his back, tracing his shoulder blades, dipping down to his collarbone and back around to his spine. “Stop it,” he says sleepily. “‘M too tired to bang.”
“Hey,” he says again; he thinks Harry might have blinked, his eyes fluttering just for a split second. “Hey. It’s me. Draco. You made it, Harry. You killed him. You won.”
Draco effortlessly slides his voice lower. “When I say practice starts at 5:15, I mean practice
kick.”
He swallowed. “How long?”
Draco shrugs. His hands flutter in the air, a twisting pattern traced in dust. “Not like these ones.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Coach happens to be back home, bitching about the importance of punctuality.”
Draco turns slightly in his seat, just so that he could see the figure standing by the door. He’s tall, hair down to his shoulders and covered with tattoos. There’s a casual sort of elegance to him, the type that Draco had spent most of his life trying to perfect, all careless arrogance and stunning grace.
Draco’s face darkens. “My father can rot for all I care.”
“That’s what I told him. He said I was being a smartass.”
“What, here?” Harry gestures - they’ve floated into one of the curves along the side of the pool. He runs a finger along the wet tiles. “This is like half the size of a regular pool. Plus the sides are all fucked.”
“Fine,” Harry mutters, and shovels more ice cream into his mouth. Draco tracks the movement, one eyebrow raised, his own ice cream forgotten in his hand. Harry inclines his head at it - “It’s going to melt.”
Draco straightens, grinning; Harry’s spoon dangles between his fingers like a trophy. “Tastes like shit,” he declares triumphantly. “The Oreos don’t even taste like anything. It’s just thick and crunchy milk.”
“What did you tell them?”
“Oh says Mr Original over here. The only way you could get more basic than Oreos is if you got a fucking
Harry closes his eyes. It’s all burned into the backs of his eyelids anyways, spiralling colours, spinning lights. He knows he should probably get up, move back into the car - falling asleep upright was going to be hell on his neck. He can’t bring himself to move though. Everything’s so warm, the comforting press of Draco beside him, the sound of insects and birds lulling him to sleep.
In a way the repetitiveness of the days helps to ground him. Every morning started like this - Harry waking, then Draco, tangled blankets and warm sheets, clothes piled into zippered bags and the squeal of tires on the pavement. The consistent poetry of an ordinary life, beautiful in its simplicity. It hurts so much that Harry can’t breathe.
The sun’s almost completely gone, the beach cast in shadow. Harry shivers - the wind’s picked up, the waves pulling more insistently at their numb feet, crashing heavily against the shoreline.
Draco turns away. His face crumples for the whisper of a breath, a single, aching moment before it smooths out again. “Please go,” he breathes, and Harry leaves him curled over on the hood, like a shattered piece of a broken mirror.
Harry thinks he would light the ocean on fire for that smile. He’d go to the ends of the earth, burn the world to the ground if Draco asked him to.
“Vividly,” Harry mutters, now rummaging around the cupboards for the sugar. “Made me sound like some sort of bloody celebrity or something. Anything Skeeter writes is trash.”
“Do you want anything?” Draco says, and tilts his head towards the small shop. Harry can just catch the neon glow from the drink coolers, rows of cans in tidy rows on the shelves. It’s early enough that the air had the slightest bit of a chill to it, though Harry knew it would all be burnt off by the afternoon.
Harry laces his hand through Draco’s, traces his thumb over the knuckles. “Yeah?”
“Bullshit. I saw you finish. No way you beat me.”
He falls asleep to memories and ghosts and what he thinks might be the brush of a hand on his cheek.
“What do I have to lose?” Draco whispers. “There’s nothing left for me in this world. I might as well try and - “
Harry laughs. “Nothing. To be honest I feel guilty just kissing - “
“Are you - “
“No,” he says, and Draco believes him.
Draco’s breath hitched. “What?”
Draco gets to his feet, smiling wickedly. He crosses over to the stove, picking up the jar of salt. “Delicious?”
“Okay,” he says, whispers against Draco’s skin, presses his lips to Draco’s coin and seals his promises in silver. “I won’t.”
“I want you to have this,” he says, and drops something in Harry’s hand. It’s the coin, Harry realizes, the cord a knitted tangle in his palm, the metal dull and stained. He remembers wrapping it around his fingers, tugging Draco in, the cut of the string against his skin. “You never told me exactly what you wished for.”
The pool went silent. It was this moment that always stuck with Harry - the sudden shift from noise to emptiness, the water lapping at the gutters of the pool. He stared at Draco. Lane 5, body curled over the block, every muscle tense as he waited for the beep.
He inches forward, wraps his finger around Harry’s hand. The punch is hard but Draco’s prepared for it now; he turns, letting Harry’s fist glance off his shoulder instead of his stomach. It hurts, breaking the scabs underneath his robes but Draco doesn’t let go.
Something flashes in Draco’s eyes. He leans back, setting the letters aside on the table, eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Don’t apologize,” he whispers. “Fuck them. I don’t care about what they think anymore. I have a new family.”
Harry swallowed. Draco’s face was false-bright, the mask he only ever pulled on when talking about his parents. He wanted to take Draco’s face in his hands, smooth out the creases in his brown and eyes, take away that burden he carried alone on his shoulders. He wanted to reach over, brush Draco’s hand with his own, watch the sun rise and pretend everything was okay.
“Bitch.”
Harry smirks. “Love how you instantly assumed it was for you.”
Inside Draco looks as if he’s fallen asleep, head tilted against the corner of the room. He cracks open his eyes at the sound of the door opening, silver against the golden tumble of his hair.
, Harry thinks. This is what always got him - the roll of the words against his mouth, the throatiness of his voice. Draco braces his arms on the wall, leans forward just a bit and Harry already knows what he’s going to say, knows from the gleam in his eyes, the tilt of lips. “Scared Potter?” he whispers, and Harry’s too far gone to resist.
He’s always thought of Draco as calculated, composed, elegant in that impossible sort of way. Draco’s always been a Prince of Stars, beautiful because he was unobtainable, because Harry would only ever be able to look at him and wish.
Sirius’ grin was savage, brutal and cutting and painful. “Crucio.”
Dimly Harry realizes this might have been a bad idea. There’s always something to distract them while driving - the endless stretch of road, the setting sun, the stars. There’s always something he can use to keep his attention from snagging on Draco, a buffer he can slide between the magnetic pull of his eyes. He’s always been good at that, holding his breath and looking away.
Harry pulls it over his head and hopes the room’s dim enough to hide the blush spreading over his cheeks.
“I wish you would just admit you made a mistake,” Draco sighs, watching as Harry serenely stirs his coffee. “Gryffindors.”
“I know,” Draco says, quietly. “That’s why I wanted it.”
When they both finally surface they’re gasping. Harry shoves his hair from his face, winces at the burn in his eyes and scowls at Draco. “I won.”
“I’ll share with you, if you’re getting anything?”
Sirius studies him for a minute, then lets out a low whistle. “God, you are practically a carbon copy of me.”
“Both of them.”
“What were you going to do?” Harry retorts, and slings Draco’s swim bag over his shoulder. “Walk home?”
There’s no use opening his eyes - all he can see is darkness. Harry bites off a string of vicious curses and starts kicking, eyes closed against the waves as he blindly swam forward. He can feel Draco beside him; the splash of his kick, the soft current from his strokes. They both make it to the end of the rocks. It feels odd doing a flip turn without a wall to push back off of, and Harry forces himself to kick harder to compensate. The last 10 meters are brutal - they’re both good at finishes and Harry puts his head down and
“We’re not fighting,” Draco says shortly and sets the bottle down between them. He’s holding the cap; it cuts a circle into his palm, red lines visible across the skin.
“I was hungry!” Draco whines. He manages to swallow his mouthful of bread. “Jesus that was hot. I think I burnt my tongue off.”
On the ‘go’ Harry pushes himself off the bottom of the ground, his whole body tensing instinctively from the cold. He opens his eyes but regrets it - the salt burns, and it’s not like he can actually see anything beyond a swirl of green. He hisses through his teeth and starts swimming.
Harry throws his head back and laughs. He remembers it like it was yesterday - Draco, pale and skinny, twisting his mesh bag into a rope between his fingers as their Coach screamed at him. “God. How long ago was that? Five years?”
The old lady smiles. She’s missing a tooth, her hands cracked and flaking. She holds her hand out for the trinket, wraps it in paper and ties it off with twine. “A lucky charm, young man. They say you can make wishes on coins with holes.”
Harry stares at the small label on the wall, though he doesn’t actually see any of the letters. He’s too busy focusing on Draco, a pillar of fire standing behind him, all flames and ichor. “Morbid.”
The phone clicked off. Harry stared down at his screen before swearing and shoving it into his pocket. He wrenched the door open - the morning air was cool against his face, everything tinged with silver and blue. Draco’s house was huge and ancient, all dark wood and stone. It was built like a traditional manor, angled roofs, thick windows, heavy glass. He’d never liked the house - it always seemed haunted, a mausoleum of memories.
Draco’s hand swims into his vision - Harry realizes he’s holding a bottle of water. He accepts it gratefully - the water’s warm but better than nothing. He swallows down half of it then passes the bottle back; Draco takes it but doesn’t drink. He instead stares at the opening, the small plastic ridges where the cap screwed on.
“This is your fucking loft too,” Draco mutters. He hands Harry the spoon from his own coffee mug, smirking as he did. “Honestly. Remember that headline a few weeks ago? ‘Harry Potter; the Hidden Mysteries of the Boy Who Lived?’”
“What a shame,” Draco says in mock horror. “I’ll have to find someone else then.”
The memory of Harry demonstrating fluid movements only to be followed by Draco and Scorpius attempting to “pop” and “lock” made Draco’s lips rise in an involuntary smile. He couldn’t have imagined this kind of life half a year ago, before Harry’d come into his and Scorpius’s lives. In fact, Draco realized now that somewhere in the months of Harry being a constant presence in his home, Draco had become deeply emotionally entwined with the man.
He couldn’t help but squeeze Potter-kitty tighter. “I wish I could tell you all this when you’re
the professional, out of the two of them. His bakery was fairly successful too, so he presumably knew the best of the best techniques.
Harry laughed easily with his husband, knowing full well that despite the occasional demanding hours, Draco loved the business they had built together as consultants for the Ministry. That being said, it still left them the question of how they would get from Longbottom Manor to the home the two of them had built in Hogsmeade. “We could Floo, maybe?”
kid! This is Teddy Lupin, my godson. Teddy, meet Draco Malfoy.”
Several beats of silence followed. Draco feared that Harry hadn’t heard him, and feared even more the possibility of
arranged on a chocolate disc atop his triple chocolate mousse cheesecake.
At least, human Draco did.
Number one: it was dinnertime, and dinnertime at Malfoy Manor was An Affair. At Potter Place, dinner was a casual thing. You were still expected to show up because family time was family time, but James and Lily had a simple small wooden table near the kitchen at which regular dinners would be held. Sometimes Sundar, the Potter kitchen house elf, would cook, and sometimes Lily would cook, directing James like a sous chef, because she missed the feeling of creating a meal, and sometimes James would cook for as long as it took someone to find and stop him from burning down the kitchen.The banquet dining table in the next room was only for holidays and rarely saw any use (for food, anyway).
Harry shook his head. He didn't like his other aunt, his uncle's sister, or grandma or grandpa. He only met them once and he was a baby. They never talked to him over the phone when Dudley got birthday or Christmas presents. Mostly because he never got any.
"Close the door on your way out." Dudley said flatly. "And don't tell mum and dad I'm up."
"Talk about what? What's everything?"
Remus didn't know if Harry has ever shifted before, and was afraid something might go wrong. Usually, pups would be born as their wolf forms, and they would spend their toddler and adolescent lives balancing between human and wolf forms. Many werewolves in their pack, and packs all over, had fond memories of these instances. However, Harry was never given that. He didn't know if he would shift and would feel pain beyond belief. That was known to happen for werewolves who wouldn't shift for long periods of time.
"Cause you guys always..."
"And there are so many books!" Sirius said, trying to reign in Harry's interest.
"Then why do you guys always say how I'm feeling?" Harry asked trying to smile, trying to laugh with them.
Mr. Remus Lupin stood by his desk, and organized the papers he had set out for the day. He pinched stacks together, set them aside in row, and kept them out of the way of his computer and projector. He was a simple man who always showed up to school in slacks, sweater vests, and white sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He told his young students he didn't mind if they stared at the scars littering his own body, but told them to mind themselves around others who might have a similar body as he does.
Sirius of course protested that they could easily give everything up in their pack, and Harry could live in their house, but Dumbledore, their pack leader, reminded him that a werewolf's scent doesn't develop until they present, be it Alpha, Beta, or Omega. Voldemort cant follow Harry's scent, but he can follow Sirius or Remus' scent.
Harry, not bothered with the whereabouts of a lizard, reached up and clicked off his lamp. He waited 13 minutes precisely for Aunt Petunia to turn off the living room lamp. He reached into the small crevice behind his mattress where he kept his book and flashlight hidden with his pillow, and started reading. Edmund had just followed Lucy into the wardrobe and his chest tingled with excitement.
Remus looked up, still smelling fear. "Harry..." Remus started walking towards him, when Harry took a step back, eyes wide with fear and confusion. Remus furrowed his eyebrows. "What's wrong?"
Harry looked at him, and smiled. "Hello." He managed quietly.
Harry looked at the picture frames, eyes wide and mouth agape, and back at Sirius. "How big is this forest, Padfoot?"
As his eyelids began to weigh on him, he took the picture of him and his family- the only real family Harry had- and slipped it in the book, closing it firmly so the picture smoothed itself out. Harry pressed it together with the palms of both his hands, for good measure. He then slipped the book into the crevice between his mattress and the wall, and set his glasses on his night stand. Only then did Harry finally lay down, and close his eyes.
Remus stalked up to Sirius as they walked a little slower together. "He got splashed with scalding water in the face this morning and had to spend the evening in a police station. Are you looking to traumatize him more?"
It also had to be her he was sent to live with. It was also her who resented him for the victimless crime of existing. It was also her who couldn't muster even a little regard for his being. It was also her who sent him scurrying to his cupboard to eat every night of his life since after he didn't need to be spoon fed anymore. It was also her who made him flinch at high-fives at school. It was also her who treated him like a joke when she was in a good mood and couldn't be bothered by him.
“Do you know what happened to the… oh, here it is.” Using her wand to levitate the satiny green ribbon edged with delicate lace, she cast a charm that sent the ribbon flying to Draco, fastening itself securely around his neck in a dashing bow.
“My day?” Draco stared blankly before it occurred to him: Potter was, quite possibly, also interested in learning more about Draco himself! Bless all the gods! He wouldn’t have to carry the effort himself! “I had quite a normal day. Sorting out orders, reviewing the books, supervising the brewing. The dunderheads who work in my labs needed a reminder, as they do most days, of the necessity for competence in brewing for my shop. I cannot even fathom what they are learning in Hogwarts these days. Today, one of them almost managed to add an ingredient to the brew that would have impregnated everyone in the room with Filoxenic Fern spores!”
And tonight, when Draco had insisted on cooking dinner, Harry had been suspicious, albeit rather tired of this cycle of hoping and guessing. Draco rarely offered to cook, though when he did he produced absolutely fantastic results (“I just don’t enjoy it very much, though I do like to pamper you from time to time.”). After dinner, he’d even insisted on cleaning up the kitchen himself and had ushered Harry into the bedroom. Not for a single moment during the evening had Draco even broached the topic of marriage.
“Well in this case it’s
The ring tumbled into the water.
be able to manage that.”
“Well, good night, then.” Draco bit his lip (a nasty habit, his mother had assured him) and then blurted, “Greg!”
So one day, Draco brought Harry along with him to the main branch. Celine, his second-in-command, was working as the office manager that day. When she looked up from the counter and spotted him, she brightened. “Oh good, you’re here! I’ve got something to show you, come on.”
moving to Australia and opening a branch WWW in Australia.
The words escaped Draco’s mouth before he had time to retract them. “I can offer you practical, if you want it.”
“Oh Harry,” Draco crooned, his hands releasing Harry’s head to feather through his hair. “Didn’t I tell you? I’ll always take care of you. And that means you,” he touched a finger to the tip of Harry’s nose, “are the one who gets spoiled, and
Harry simply smiled and kissed his husband. The two of them mounted their brooms and flew the short distance to Malfoy Manor. As expected, Lucius and Narcissa were overjoyed by the surprise visit as well as understanding of the circumstances that had led to it.
Draco explained
“Why yes I did, as a matter of fact! It’s a new treatment. My hairstylist has been attending masterclasses in how to replicate the characteristic unicorn shimmer into human hair.” He slipped a hand beneath his long curtain of hair and drew it out. The resulting waterfall of platinum blonde
She stood and strode to the back, not even sparing a glance to see if Draco followed, which of course he did. Celine Trinh was one scary woman, and anyone who looked down on her for being a Squib would soon find out that she didn’t need to be able to cast spells to put the fear of the Veil in them.
“No!” Draco shouted. The sound startled both him and Harry, but Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t let Harry leave, he had to take care of him, if Harry left no one would care for him and Draco could have no one to care for! “No,” he said again, more quietly this time. “Really, you’re not being a bother or a problem at all. It’s me.”
Harry let himself go then, wanking openly as he enjoyed the view. He’d already been close from all the teasing and the anticipation of today, so it was all too soon that Harry felt his orgasm crest. White strands streaked out of his cock, and Harry frantically moaned and spread his legs forcefully wider as he kept his gaze staring forward, picturing how the imaginary crowd would be hungry to see him come. The thought sent his pleasure spiking, and his hand sped up on his cock as he coaxed out the last of his orgasm.
“And how about your day?”
Draco didn’t know how to react. “I… this is very different from what I imagined you were feeling given how you’ve been acting this past week.”
“It truly was,” Lucius agreed. “I admit, I wasn’t certain Lily was speaking sense at the time, but…”
The vibrating on his own dick intensified with the force of his thrusts, as it was meant to do. Draco bit his lip, the pleasure beginning to tip over in his brain. He reached down and grabbed Harry’s erection with a slippery hand, rubbing it erratically as he continued fucking Harry hard and fast.
Draco’s lips twitched. “Only probably?”
After that, Draco actually found himself enjoying the weekend with Teddy and Harry (he’d had to switch from Potter after Teddy got confused). With Draco’s help, Teddy went from a rampaging toddler to the best kind of rambunctious child to be around. Draco found the stress of cramming for his introductory physics exam that morning simply disappeared. Where he’d thought that he’d be dead to the world this weekend, he found that minding Teddy energized him instead.
“Because I, for one, would very much like it if you meant that.” He took a deep breath. “I might tell you about how I think of you every night after I leave. I might tell you that I miss being here, miss the way this place feels more like home than anywhere I’ve stayed except Hogwarts, and that I even miss Scorpius’s tendency to find monsters
Harry collapsed down over top of him, his hips still moving in lazy thrusts. Draco pressed a kiss on the base of Harry’s neck and felt an answering kiss on the top of his head. As his breath slowly evened out and his mind returned to him, a feeling of disbelieving awe came with it. He and Harry had
“Ooh! Harry! Do the thing!”
“I have recently come to a realization about myself, one which would make it untenable for you to stay here if you were to discover it. Thus, I was doing my best to prevent you from discovering it, knowing that you would be unable to live with me if you knew the truth. It appears that I have failed and the worse option is now the only option.”

“What, that I’m going to muck things up? Of course! When have I

The sucking and fingering felt good on its own, but then Harry’s finger slid deeper and Draco’s hips jerked suddenly as it touched against
Harry sank both hands into his hair and pulled agitatedly at the thought.
“...and this is a white ash tree, you can tell by the pattern of leaves that grows like this. How many leaves do you see?”
“Yes, darling, you were telling me about how your yeast friends started foaming so you dumped flour on them.”
“Oh yes, anything you want to do, just let us know. We want this to be your second home.” Narcissa nodded decisively.
“No!” Teddy screamed cheerfully.
,” Draco shot back, cheeks burning. “So will you take it or not?”
“You don’t even want to know how much money I’ll give you?” Draco decided not to pursue the ‘crippling social anxiety’ remark. It was clear from the flippant way Potter had stated it that he didn’t want to make a

Time went on.
Suddenly, Draco snapped his fingers. “Wait a moment, we’re wizards! Let’s just Accio the ring out!”
“Cupboard?”
Harry rubbed his hand down his face, a strand of his long hair getting tangled in his fingers along the way. “I mean, it is reasonable, I guess, it’s just also a little… I don’t know. Not emasculating or humiliating, but it gives me the feels-bad?”
Harry thought uneasily of the last
After about two months of living together, Draco accidentally said “Harry” one afternoon.
his confession.
Then Potter opened his mouth and began to sing.
Harry huffed out a laugh. “You’re trans, yeah? Like Luna.” He finished the repairs and sat back up in his seat.
“I’ll never guess. Did he use Anteater Bile instead of Armadillo Bile?”
As the taste of delightfully charred sugar spread over his tongue, Harry tuned back into the conversation and realized that the Malfoys were looking at him expectantly. “Yes?” he asked, hoping he hadn’t put his foot in it.
Harry turned his wand towards himself and cast the charm that everyone with a penis looked up as soon as they knew it existed. It would ensure he was able to keep having fun as long as
When Draco left in the mornings, Potter would also rise and give him a homemade lunch before he stepped out the door to Apparate in. His bleary eyes made it clear that Draco’s departure time was earlier than he would choose to be up. Draco tried telling him that he didn’t need to put himself through the effort and he could order a sandwich as he normally did, but Potter always waved him off.
Another finger joined the first, and then his whole fist wrapped around his cock and squeezed, stroking firmly. The head was already slippery thanks to all his previous ministrations, and the resulting slide of his palm felt amazing. His other hand slipped under his balls, fondling the soft sack and adding to the sensation.
“Draco, you’re going to have to elaborate a bit. Which Pureblood tradition, the one where they strip naked and dance on fire? Because no matter how many times you explain it, I can’t get the thought of flame-roasted nuts out of my mind, so I’m going to have to put a hard no to that for now.” Harry wasn’t sure if he’d ever be ready for it, but stranger things had happened. Such as falling in love with one’s one-time school rival.
Draco softened at his tone, the need to prevent any hurt from befalling Harry rearing its head. “I promise, Harry. Now go out there and I’ll come to you.”
to be insane, because they don’t exist yet. Once they do exist, they become mundanities, and I am free to consider the next idea that no one has considered before.”
Draco couldn’t remember ever being this deliriously happy.
Draco slowed to an ominous stalk as he crept past directly in front of his father. The rustling of the Daily Prophet disguised the slight sounds Draco made as his gooseliness slid into place and posed victoriously where the swan statue had stood not thirty minutes earlier.
Once, Harry asked grumpily why Draco didn’t ever introduce him to
Harry’s face flushed adorably. “I… yes, you do. Okay.” He pouted again. “I want to tell you something
expecting you to sweep me off my feet and ravish me.”
“Very well. Let me show you where I live…”
With a sigh, Draco summoned a quill and parchment to write a letter to Gregory Goyle.
After dinner, Draco would usually review business reports or correspondence while Potter went off and did Potter things. Occasionally that was visiting his friends, but more often than not he would sit with Draco and work on something in a bound journal that was always locked tight when he wasn’t using it.
to tell Harry like
As Potter tucked in, Draco began talking. “As I said, I’ve got a house that’s doing no one any good for eight or more hours every day. You’re welcome to live in it and make it more… lived-in. I will provide a daily stipend for you to make it feel less like I’m keeping you prisoner in my own home.”
“Darling, don’t be so naughty or I’ll have to punish you,” Draco said conversationally. “And then I wouldn’t let you come for
rainbows if you let him cook for you. He’s a big fan of, er, the Black family.”
The first time it happened, Draco had been caught off-guard. The soft
In short, they had developed a routine together. Oddly enough, Draco didn’t mind that one bit. He was perfectly happy working hard at Cosmic Concoctions and handing over his hard-earned profits to Potter. It was the life he’d been raised to believe he’d lead, after all: manage a business, reap the rewards, and support his wife and children. Not that Potter was his spouse, of course! But in principle...
, you somehow reciprocated my feelings, our relationship would inherently be unbalanced. I could never be certain if you were truly happy or just putting on an act because you were afraid of no longer receiving said basic living necessities.”
Unfortunately, after he finished cleaning all the muck from his house and tending to Scorpius, he really couldn’t be bothered with searching through classifieds. Instead, he asked Greg for recommendations.
, Draco thought, and began leading them to the bedroom.
Gingerly, he got to his feet to examine his surroundings. The gardens at Malfoy Manor had always been spectacular, so much so that it was understood in Pureblood circles to be the best of all Manor gardens. In recent days, though, Longbottom Manor’s gardens had been generating quite a stir. Mother had been going out of her mind trying to visit so she could update her gardens accordingly, but Augusta Longbottom was crafty and vicious and figured her out every time. Still, Draco thought the Malfoy gardens were splendid regardless of how they compared to the Longbottom gardens.
Harry nodded. “I could tell you wanted me to ask, you know. So. I asked.”
, their lips came together. It was brief and chaste, but Draco still felt that it was probably the best kiss in the world because it was a kiss with
“Yes.” He’d forgotten that his cousin was also trans, as well as the fact that Harry was close to her. No wonder Harry hadn’t been more confused. In his defense, he tried hard not to dwell on war trauma these days. There were too many people who had been hurt that he didn’t interact with regularly, and focusing on all of them would drown him.
“I thought the whole point of this was to see if I could get you to come on my dick,” Harry pouted. He reached behind him and grabbed his harness, buckling it on with practiced ease. He wordlessly cast the activating charm, and Draco heard the vibrating end of the strap-on hum to life. “May I please fuck you, darling?”
Harry’s head came up off Draco’s dick. “Did I just—?”
“Yeah! And then Mr. Greg showed me how to knead the bread, and he told me to add flour if it was sticky, and the bread was
with kids.”
Draco opened the door to his home, weary from a long day’s work. What greeted him inside nearly had him spinning around on his heel and walking elsewhere.
Draco countered. “I assumed you’d gone to your parents’ place for dinner since I know you feel awkward around mine. When I got there, it was just me—I don’t know where Amaryllis and Iris were—and James and Lily insisted I eat dinner with them.”
He started with his jacket, undoing one button at a time. As the folds of fabric fell away, he pictured how one of those imagined watchers might get a bit bold and slide a hand down the collar of his thin white dress shirt, feeling the smoothness of his chest and the hard pebbles of his nipples. He shrugged his shoulders out of the jacket next, letting the sleeves collect at his elbows for a moment as he inhaled deeply, imagining his fantasy partner gripping his upper arms and caressing his muscles.
said and done some pretty intense things, and now that he thought about it, they probably should have established a safeword or something—
“You know, what are you getting out of it?”

to make a mess!” Potter shot back, his lips right by Draco’s ear. Draco felt a tingle but immediately shook it off. He was a little touch-starved, so what? It didn’t mean anything! “Anyway, Teddy’s fathers took off on a weekend trip and I agreed to look after him.”
“—working people who do not deserve to be objectified—”
“There! You look like you’re about to vomit! Oh god, I
Harry accented his enthusiastic desire with a sharp upward thrust. Draco firmly shoved him down by the hips.
Harry stopped short. “Hmmmm, the comedic potential of that last one outweighs pretty much all the other cons of what you just said.” His lips cracked into a huge smile. In spite of the whole ring-down-the-drain situation, the back-and-forth banter had reminded him that it wasn’t the ring that was important, it was Draco and the fact that the love of his life had proposed to him tonight. “Alright, I’m sold.”
to break up, so tell me what the problem is already so we can address it!” He came closer, close enough that Draco could see the green of his eyes through the frosted glass. “Please, Draco? I thought we were good enough friends to be honest with each other.”
Harry waved a hand impatiently, a gesture Draco recognized as one of his own. “Breaking up is both for friends and lovers. That’s all semantics anyway. I’m telling you I don’t
(Draco tried not to think about how lately, he’d much rather Potter stay afterwards.)
Harry sat up abruptly, sending seventeen pillows tumbling to the floor. Even after patting and prodding every inch of the improbable square footage of the huge bed, he still came up emptyhanded and Draco-less.
Sirius, however, looked as though he was more than willing to find out.
The bell blared though the library quietly, and Harry gathered up his things. He only read two pages, but he was fine with that. He had time at recess too.
Harry sat in the library reading rug on a bean bag, reading the rest of the fight between Edmund and Peter. Harry didn't have siblings, not that he would consider Dudley a brother, a cousin, or even family for that matter, but if he did, he would protect them with his life. He knew he would. Harry would go to the depth of Narnia and back, just so he could have a little brother or sister like Lucy or Peter.
Harry gave a small laugh. "Yeah, we match." He wiped his tears on his sleeve, and looked back at Mr. Lupin with a smile.
Mr. Lupin, in his few but still measured years of working with children, knew what that meant.
Harry took his shirt away from his face, and fanned it with his nimble hands. He walked towards the bathroom, hopefully to run it under cool water. So there he stood, hunched over the bathroom sink, with his glasses and letting it run over his face down his neck.
Remus let out a laugh. "Yes, like the moon."
Remus smiled fondly at the child on the hill. "Yes, Harry! It is! If you wanna go inside without us that'll do!" He looked back at Sirius. "Better catch up."
"We don't read minds, Harry!" Remus said, hands on his knees.
He could hear her muttering quietly to his uncle about 'disciplinary action', and how 'someone had to knock him down a peg', and how it had to be her.
Remus nodded. "We didn't know he was being beaten."
Harry looked between the two men and smelled tension. They weren't fighting, but they were still angry. Harry grew more afraid of why they brought him here.
Harry, having no time for whines and complaints, he got up, got his glasses on, and walked over to the kitchen where he started on Dudley's usual: chocolate chip pancakes with bananas and whipped cream. None of this was for him though, he knew that. He didn't eat in front of the Dursley's, not without complaint of existing too much and "for how much we feed you, you should at least be a little more grateful to live under our roof" as if this was living. Surely if he made himself a pancake, the Dursley's would know, so it would be all about eating it in his cupboard at that point.
Harry and her got into the spat today, because his cousin Dudley had found a picture of him and his parents all bundled up together, under his mattress while looking for his stash of sweets. He managed to find them in the crevices of the cabinets in the kitchen. Harry had found the picture itself in the attic of their house while he was dusting.
"The library is just down this hall," Remus said, pointing to the hall that went past the kitchen, off to somewhere else.
"Yes," Remus said, remembering the empty room he was put in.
"The house isn't that scary once you grow into all the ominous shades of black, grey, green..." Sirius playfully groaned. Harry let out a laugh.
"Okay, good." She gave a bleak smile.
Of course, Harry didn't have any money, so he was have to steal the loose change and crumpled bills from his aunt's purse by the door, since his uncle kept his wallet either on him or in his night stand, and Harry was way too small, way too breakable to do that.
Walking in, was a man with ripped jeans, and sunglasses propped up against his face from the evening sun outside. He was sporting a black leather jacket and band t-shirt, and rings on each finger. His slick black hair ran to his shoulders, and a keychain hung out of his pocket.
After a long time on back roads, they finally got to a hill side where a massive forest stood proudly. Harry didn't recall the proper way to Gloucestershire, only it was almost 2 hours away where he lived. He didn't know the roads like how adults did, but if they did, Mr. Lupin must have taken roads he's never seen on maps before. Not on the maps in Uncle Vernon's car anyway.
They got up to the broken down porch that had holes and claw marks in the floor, Harry forced any scary thought from his mind, clinging to Sirius' side, and the Omega brought out the keys from his keychain. Sirius couldn't have silver, but the metal chain worked just as fine.
"Hey, mate, how was it? Were you scared?" Remus crouched to the ground and looked at Harry.
Harry'
Harry left, and shut the door behind him. He started on his way to school, where the one good thing, or person, in his life was.
Up ahead, Harry looked back at the two adult arguing in harsh whispers. He felt like he did something wrong and hasn't figured it out yet. The sound of the leaves brushing against the wind sounded like music to his ears. The dirt smelled fresh as it was a little muddy, the birds chirping off in the neighboring trees, Harry wasn't sure he wanted to leave.
Both the men busted out laughing this time, and they both felt like children again.
Harry smiled, and almost let out a laugh at the silly nickname. He wanted one too.
As they began to trek through the trees and forestry, Harry noticed they couldn't see their car anymore. "Where's the car?"
Remus lowered his gaze first, and looked back at Harry with the bright smile he usually gave him when Harry would walk into the classroom in the morning. "Harry, why don't we go and find the library, yeah? We can show you the house and everything while we do."
Harry opened the door with his back, and said "Dudley, I brought your breakfast."
"It's little ways from the road," Sirius said, like reading his mind, "but there is something you should know about this house-"
Sirius smiled, enamored with his innocence. "Call me Padfoot, pup."
When they reached the forest, and Harry was at lost for words for the different shades of leaves that casted brilliant shadows over the car. Remus looked through the rear view mirror, and smiled to himself from the look on Harry's face.
Remus didn't lower his gaze. "Harry, you can walk ahead, we'll join you in only a second."
"Alright," a woman with brown hair and stark gray eyes walked out of the questioning room with Harry down the hall. He walked out politely, with a small smile on his face, to Remus' confusion. The pair walked over to Remus and Sirius, and the woman looked to Remus and said, "we're going to conduct an investigation and we'll be in touch. Have you already be questioned, as a witness?"
It wasn't until Harry raised his hand that Mr. Lupin figured out why. Jagged lines crossed over his face, and Mr. Lupin almost jumped from his chair. He crossed the room over to Harry, and lowly whispered to him to follow him outside with the best calm smile he could give.
"Remus he probably already knows-"
"Yeah, well, "Remus brought his hand to his neck, "we don't go there often. It's probably all dirty and gross and dark and empty and cold-"
Harry didn't know it, but all Remus ever thought about for the past 8 years Harry's been alive, 2 years since he's been in school, was protecting him. That's all he ever did.
Before Remus knew it, the Omega was racing up the hill, leaving the Alpha in the dust. Remus could only watch.
"Harry we can't read your mind," Remus said, suddenly heart broken that he couldn't catch the seriousness from Harry's voice when he asked the question before. He walked up to him closer and knelt in front of him, taking his hands into his own. "We just see what you're thinking written all over your face. He aren't going to hurt you, Harry."
They sat in silence, guilt washing over them. No one deserved what happened to Harry.
That had to be Harry's biggest vice and virtue. He had incredibly sharpened senses of all kinds. He could hear the shift in his uncle's bed as he sat up to get his house shoes on in the morning. He could smell his cousins breathe from across the dining room into the kitchen right after Harry asked him nicely to stop eating his sweets he found. He could also feel every emotion he ever felt with an incredible intensity and depth. He's always been told he's just sensitive. That's partially why he loved reading so much. He felt every single word written on a page like it had been written on his heart. He obviously didn't know even half of this, though. Putting words to feelings was the biggest challenge of all to Harry, but also his biggest motivation. His vice and virtue.
"Sirius," Remus said, "I was going to explain when we got home. Sit him down in the reading chair in the library. Explain to him gently our little world. Introduce him back to Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Maybe to the rest of the pack. All that though would take place tomorrow, but what I'm saying Sirius is-"
The three of them started down to the living room where a slightly torn up rug laid in the center of it with the fire place going. The couches were a dark shade of gray and had small in-tables beside them. The big chair stood off to the side, daring anyone unworthy to sit in it. Everything in the house looked old and ancient, yet very tidy and tasteful. Harry just liked how clean it was. He wasn't sure if he had to when he was coming here.
"You pathetic piece of SHIT." She spat. A sharp slap blew across his face. "JUST like your mother. Spineless, pathetic piece of shit." Another blow. "I hope you find what you're looking for, and let it be known for a fact that you are the reason why she died."
"-and spiders and cobwebs and it's probably haunted now that I think about it."
"Harry, pup," Sirius said, returning his hand back into his hair, "lets go find the library and we'll talk about everything on the way."
When they finally got to the check point that Remus knew all too well, he stopped the car, and turned the engine off. He looked to Harry's curious face in the back seat. "We walk from here, Harry."
"Well," Sirius slipped his hands in his pockets, "we have a flat right outside of Little Whinging, however, that isn't really our house."
His aunt crept down the stairs, to which Harry barely heard. She had very light foot steps and could snap like a tooth pick from his uncle Vernon's jar he kept on the bottom shelf. She still had her nightie on, and hair roller's still in place. She wasn't a real sleeping beauty like Harry. Harry had lowered his head in the kitchen, obviously avoiding his aunt from the fight they got into last night. All he did was set a tea cup and saucer out, to which he poured the now scalding water onto the tea packet already in there.
Class went on for 10 minutes as usual, with Remus at the front of the room with the projector, going through a worksheet the class was doing before. Harry thought he should do it, but he couldn't because he cried so much he couldn't focus anymore about it. Mr. Lupin would give him smile's sometimes, and Harry would feel better, and smile back.
"And maybe he does. Maybe he doesn't. We need to take things slow with him. Approach the subject carefully. Too much in one day for a child like him could scare him away from us. I mean, look at him! He's figured out that the forest is charmed, and he's scared we're gonna kill him or something!"
"We knew they didn't love him."
Once he had quickly, but thickly, swallowed the remaining pancakes, he heard his Uncle Vernon shift out of bed, and stalk down the hallway. He came down the stairs with lazy bumps, and Harry put on the coffee and kettle.
"This should've happened a long time ago Remus and you know it." Sirius seethed.
"I THINK I FOUND THE HOUSE MR. LUPIN!!" Harry yelled from up a hill some long ways ahead. "IS IT BLACK AND RUN DOWN AND EVERYTHING?!"
So the Alpha and Omega sat in the waiting room of a police station, in silence, too afraid to say anything.
"It has ghosts?" Harry said finally.
Sirius and Harry, side by side, raced down the hill to a small clearing where a tall house with rickety old wood that kept it in place stood, almost as high as the trees, and as big at the clearing. It was odd-looking, but Harry couldn't wait to see the library. He wondered if it had shelves with ladders.
"Say," Mr. Lupin started off, "I couldn't help but notice that you came into class today with this scar over your face." He finger delicately pushed his bushy hair out of the way to look at the scar clearly. He said this next part slowly, "Did something happen, last night, Harry?"
Harry pushed past everyone, and made his way down to his class.
Well, not all of that was true. The protection part, really. It was not only Remus' job, but his friend Sirius' job as well. Sirius and him go way back to when they all, Harry's dad James, Remus, Sirius, and Peter, more on him later though, all played together in their high school year. It wasn't really a high school, it was more like a school that all the packs in Britain sent their offspring for studies. Sirius was practically James brother. They were as thick as thieves. It nearly broke Sirius when the rival pack came and tried to claim their territory, threatening either James and Lily's lives, Harry's mum, or Harry's life, given he was the new youngest in the entire pack. After that night, they swore to never go anywhere near the pack. It was a blood trade.
"Hi, Harry." Sirius crouched down, Keychain lightly hitting the floor. "My name's Sirius."
Mr. Lupin furrowed his eyebrows. "Run away? Really?"
Remus and Sirius were both very different people brought together by very similar circumstances, but either one of them could testify for the fact that they would rather die than lay a single hand on Harry. Sirius knew, from his years of abuse, that Harry getting adjusted to his new life with them wasn't going to be a cake walk. A part of Sirius' mind remembered how when he met James, he did that same thing too, search someone's eyes. Waiting for the moment to pass before you can react so nothing came out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere, Remus turned off on the road, and started driving through the field of grass towards the forest.
"Remus." Sirius stopped dead on the path, and looked at him carefully, before speaking. "We've been over this. We were going to introduce him normally, and make nothing of it. Look," he swept a hand through his hair, and stuck his arm out, "he reads books, right? That's a good sign! A little bit of magic and shifting and sorts isn't gonna hurt him! We aren't scaring him away from us!"
"Harry," He pulled his slack up a bit and stared back up a bit. "I need to make sure everything going on at home is okay. If not, I'm going to have to have to tell the school about this so we can make sure you're safe." He gave Harry a smile he knew the 8 year old didn't see. "Harry, is it okay with you if I ask you, one more time, if you're alright at home?"
I want to thank everyone in my comments on my last chapter for all of your kind words of encouragement :'} I know and am sorry I didn't respond to them all, although i know I should have, but this semester hit me hard, and I was balancing a depressive episode that felt like it last for forever. You all truly kept me going.
"I know we should've taken him anyway, and protected him with our lives." Remus said finally into his fists that sat balled against his chin. "That seemed like the safest option, compared to this," he gestured to the room, "but we couldn't. Every law of Nature says that. If I can turn back time and do it all over again, I would've done that. I would've saved James and Lily, kicked Pete's ass, and we all could've lived happily ever after. But we couldn't, and we can't, because he's still out there."
Mr. Lupin knew that too. No child knew what to do when their feeling were bigger than them. He kept his brave face on and hugged the smaller boy back. He, himself, felt like crying too, but knew the boys caring heart was going to start crying over that too, and then he'd really have a problem. He needed to get the boy to talk to him in one piece.
Harry looked down the hall ways that were placed in the middle of the entry to the living room and kitchen, and the foyer. Two halls facing each other, going left and right. Harry assumed they went off to different rooms or parts of the house, like the library. It was weird thinking the house had many rooms, for how much nobody lived here.
"Well you must have questions! Right?" Sirius chided.
Remus thought he'd just about cried then. Sirius gave another brave smile to him so Remus can turn his head up to the ceiling. "They sound like wonderful listeners then, Harry. If you'd like, when we get to the house in the woods, you can read to Remus and I. We have loads of books like Narnia and and the sorts. I'm sure we can find you something you'd like then, yeah pup?"
Neither of the men were discouraged by the idea that Harry could be an Omega. They just wanted him safe, and alive. Sirius was as tough as nails, and he was an Omega. It was very much possible for an Omega to be powerful and strong. Sirius proved that. He would bite off anyone's head that would say otherwise. He had the drunken bar fight memories to prove it. Well, sort of.
Harry was 8, but he still wanted to laugh, She had called it a home. As if it weren't everything but.
The door swung open, and Harry was greeted with a foyer that was much more cleaner and spacious than the outside. It was huge, and had a single staircase wrapping around the right side of the room. The tile floors were pitch black and reflected the bright small chandelier that hung neatly on the ceiling. The walls were painted a cool dark green, and with pictures of some rather old people looking sternly at the camera, as if their looks were trying to kill. Of course, there was other photos of other people, some rugged and dirty, some neat and polished. There were young children, and old grandparents; families, and married couples. Not everyone looked related; Harry wondered how many relatives Mr. Lupin and Sirius had.
Harry nodded slowly, feeling like he wasn't sure if he should be standing so close to Sirius right now. He only then remembered the claw marks on the porch. He didn't want to believe the bright and shiny Mr. Lupin who he loved so much could ever hurt him, or Sirius, his new friend...
The teacher, suddenly very thankful for catching him in time before he got himself trafficked or killed, gave him a quick, bleak smile. "Harry, dear," He said slowly, "you can't... you can't just run away, alright? You can't. There are very bad people out there that will hurt you and kill you and... and you can't Harry. I don't know what I would do with myself if something bad like that were to ever happen to you." He found himself wiping his own tears away. "When something bad like this happens, you need to find someone and tell them what going on, alright? Mr. Tolson, myself, do you have any other family you know that you can live with?"
Harry wrote a note from his notebook.
"You're not gonna hurt me, are you?" Harry said slowly. "Cause we're in the woods, and the marks on the floor, and you guys can read my mind, and-"
Harry strapped his backpack on, and finally said "Alright! I'm going to school now! I'll meet Dudley at the pick up line at 3!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's okay Sirius." Harry said quietly.
"You have a house in the woods?" Harry looked to Remus.
Harry also stood there, angry.
Sirius looked back at him impatiently.
Harry looked confused and scared, but once he saw that Sirius accepted defeat with a smile to Harry, he picked up his pace and decided to focus on the trees.
"Alright then," Remus said softly, standing up slowly. He stretched out his hand so Harry can take it, and sighed of relief when he did.
Harry nodded his head, and they both went inside.
"Mornin', boy," His uncle said flatly. "Coffee starting late? Why?"
It didn't matter though, because as of today, right after he got through the work sheet, it was all about to change.
Remus, noticing from the drivers seat, that Sirius never opening talked about his love of reading, not to anyone besides him, James, and Peter of course. He never liked school, or reading books, or anything that didn't pique his interests. Sirius only read crime thrillers and horror stories if he ever read. Most of the books in the Dean house was filled with his parents old books about ancient magic and myths. His side of the library was just a few shelves full of book Sirius has read or was going to read.
"Sirius..." Remus warned.
Harry, like Remus, was a wolf. Not a werewolf that transformed during full moons, but one that can transform at will. Harry didn't know it yet, and if he did he didn't tell Remus, but his mother and father were in Remus' pack. They were his best friends. They died protecting their pack from a rivaling pack across the mountains. Harry didn't know he was a wolf, and it was Remus' job to protect him from the dangers of their world. He would hope he would be the one who guided Harry gently into it all, but if Harry needed to be moved from his house the Council had ordered him to stay in, his start might be more abrupt than the teacher had planned.
Draco grumbles. “I slept on the bleachers at Nationals.”
“Night,” Harry breathes back.
Draco rolls his eyes but he gets up off the bed. They both carry their bags down, double handfuls of spilling cotton and soft cloth. Harry swipes his card against the reader; he shoves his clothes in, feeds quarters until the door clicks shut and begins to whirl.
“Ugh. Back already?”
But this was a sprint. It was all-or-nothing, the aching pull of heavy limbs, heads held down in the water and the franticness of a chase. Harry was damn good at those.
“I can’t
“Nice pyjamas,” he says sarcastically. Harry scowls - he’s cold, his bare chest itching underneath Draco’s steady eyes.
Draco makes a soft noise. He holds the last of the bottle out to Harry; when Harry shakes his head he drains it, tosses it through the open door of the car onto the passenger seat. The world settles around them - insects, wind, the babble of some hidden stream. Harry closes his eyes and breathes in the smell of bush.
,” he drawls, and it’s supposed to be mocking, Harry thinks, except the word is said just a bit too slowly, the syllables drawn out between Draco’s lips like taffy. It’s the low roll at the back of his throat, the tilt of his mouth and Harry tries to hide a flush and stares down at his tray furiously.
“It’s all…” Harry breaks off. “It looks broken. Like shards of glass exploded.”
It wasn’t
“I don’t want to talk about it,”
“They kicked me out,” Draco said. He’s determinedly not looking at Harry - Harry caught the barest line of a shoulder, the faintest curve of a neck.
Draco moves then. He wrenches the car door open, his grip almost vicious on the handle as he steps out, swings his bag out of the front seat and over his shoulder. “I told them that all we were was friends,” he says. “That it was all we’d ever be.”
They move in sync - trash put away, snacks packed into bags. They brush their teeth side by side in the bathroom, and Harry lets his eyes drift over to Draco’s in the mirror.
Charcoal eyes met his;
“Coming,” Draco replied. Harry frowned - he sounded wide awake, voice too tense to be natural. “One minute.”
and maybe
Harry closes his eyes when he feels Draco’s lips on his.
“I was ahead of you the whole way!”
Harry thinks of Draco slipping things into his pockets - a quarter from the vending machine last night, the cap from the bottle of Sprite. He thinks of Draco threading string through the lid and around the coin, and his something in his heart twists.
He inwardly groans, turning back to face Draco, who had a shit-eating grin on his face. “No. I meant to do that.”
“ but Harry had ignored him. “
When they get hungry they stop at the food stands. Harry exchanges coins for a pretzel - it comes in a paper bag, hot enough to burn his skin. He tears off half of it for Draco, watches the steam rise in curling patterns.
“Fuck,” Draco says again. God, even his voice sounded tense, the words so clipped that Harry barely recognized him.
Draco grins. “Still do.”
“Draco?”
They pull out of the gas station, and as Harry watches the carwash fade into the distance he wonders what it was that Draco couldn’t let go.
"Does 'pup' get t be my nickname now?" He asked excited. "Like how Sirius is called Padfoot? Do you have a nickname, Mr. Lupin?"
"Ah," Mr. Lupin said quietly, with a smile. "Well it's rather nice, Harry. I'd say we're matching, now." He looked down at his arms and back up to Harry face with a smile, hoping his fear wasn't making the boy more upset than he was right now.
I've been meaning to draw this scene FOREVER, and getting a new tablet that I have to practice with finally gave me the motivation to do so. LET CHAOS REIGN!
The next day, Draco and Harry stood in their bedroom. Draco solemnly handed over a phial, the golden liquid inside sloshing viscously against the glass sides. There was only a ⅛ dose of the potion, but Draco felt that would be more than enough for what Harry was about to attempt.
Maybe a blanket? Draco shoved on his underwear and crouched with his fluffy duvet, murmuring, “Here, kitty Potter, Potter kitty... pspspspsps? AH!”
“—will have you know that it is not illegal to have eyes—”
Harry leaned up and kissed Draco’s chin. As he guided Draco to the couch to sit down, a plate holding a half-eaten treacle tart globe manifested into being on the side table. He grinned and began speaking. “Well you see, it started with me waking up and realizing three very important points…”
“How could I say no to that face?” Draco replied, his own eyebrows returning a caterpillar wave.
“Why?” Harry asked blankly.
“Okay, well first we need to learn what ‘indoor voices’ means.”
Harry woke as he usually did: slow blinks, blurry world that failed to focus because his glasses lay abandoned on the nightstand, deep breaths as his mind cleared of fog. Then he abruptly realized that he was not in his bed.
Harry froze. Draco took the opportunity to reposition. He straddled Harry’s face, knees on either side of his head, and buried his fingers in Harry’s soft, curly hair. Then, he pulled Harry’s head right where he wanted him to go.
and hastily agreed with those terms before settling into Draco’s spoonhold and closing his own eyes.
When Harry finally could no longer stand it, he let just one finger stroke up the side of his erection, teasing at the glans. He had to let out an involuntary moan at the sensation, his eyes narrowing even as he continued staring at the scenery rushing past him.
“But I do know one bloke who might work out,” Dursley continued. “He’s magic, and I think he can keep up with Scorpius without letting him get away with behaving however he likes. And he’s not busy, either. I’m fairly sure he doesn’t have a job or work or anything. I can er, ring him up?”
She frowned slightly, then snapped her fingers silently and mimed drinking. Harry picked up his goblet, confused but beyond willing to trust the Malfoy house elves at this point. He took a sip, and Nuni smiled before disappearing.
“You… made these?”
him instead of against him as it had all through school.
Draco stood, shaking imaginary wrinkles from his robes. “It would be a travesty to allow you to continue to wear those, they offend my sensibilities. Hence, I will guide you in selecting style and fit.”
“No, he already did that one. At least the two are related, so the Wit Sharpening Potion could be salvaged. Come on, you think he would mess up twice in the same way?” Celine coughed. “Not that I would put it past him.”
“Fine by me,” Harry replied, winding his arms around Draco’s waist. He looked up at Draco, eyes shining. “I don’t
Draco looked down at his boyfriend helplessly. “Harry, I thought you would have realized, but people don’t exactly
“Oof!” cried Potter, instinctively cradling Draco in his arms.
“Oh shit, sorry!” Harry yelped, dropping his wand hurriedly.

“Okay!” Scorpius beamed and turned to Potter. “Mr. Potter, will you come over and practice with Daddy so we can play music together and dance?”
“I would love to,” he whispered against Draco’s neck even as he squeezed his boyfriend even harder.
It made Draco feel butterflies in his stomach when he looked at Harry, and he had the sense that Harry felt them too.
Draco simply sighed and resolved to try and find another babysitter. Preferably one whose hobbies weren’t quite so prone to sticking to the ceiling.
Past flings aside, Saint Potter couldn’t possibly be a bad choice for taking care of Scorpius. Right?
Silence.
believe, seeing as you’ve given this exact same rant, oh, the past sixty times you’ve called. Now, are you almost home? I’ve a date tonight and I want to have plenty of primping time.”
Draco turned and surveyed the now-chaotic library. There wasn’t much else for him to accomplish here. He turned his beady eyes to the large picture window that overlooked Mother’s garden. Naturally, oh so naturally, his eyes shifted to the large ornamental globe that lay just to the side of it.
it?!”
He asked Potter about it, once. Who hadn’t read the shocking exposés about Potter’s childhood that Rita Skeeter had published and that had ruined her career when, for once, the public decided that she had gone too far? The exposés of child neglect and abuse had made Draco feel very uncomfortable with his own past behavior in tormenting a young Potter. He’d spent the past couple years since the articles were published hoping that they were overblown in true Skeeter style.
Potter nodded mutely.
if Draco looked him in the eyes too long.
In the kitchen, he found the hero of his home improvements cutting up fruit. He stared for a moment in surprise, long enough that the subject of his attention noticed his presence and looked up.

“Here, Potter, Potter,” Draco said, extending his hand below the bed, wiggling his fingers a little, and feeling ridiculous. A second later, he regretted his decision as Potter-kitty took a swipe.

"Done."
“Enthusiastic,” supplied Greg.
Draco returned home the next evening with a buzzing in his stomach. He’d tried to dismiss it to no avail. What had he gotten himself into? Spending extensive time with Potter was not going to go well, he just knew it.
. How was he supposed to navigate social cues if the Malfoys Sr. kept subverting them while simultaneously expecting them? His Potter training hadn’t prepared him for this!
“Well, how much money are you going to give me?”
“Oh, get in here already you ridiculous prat. And give me the bath bomb, I want to put it in.”
the Polyjuice?”
“You mean…”
Draco nodded, already dreading the thought of drafting a classified in the Daily Prophet, or, heaven forbid, the Quibbler. He shuddered internally. Who knew what kind of applicants he’d attract advertising in the Quibbler? “Thank you anyway—“
As the two entered the bathroom, Harry marveled anew as he did everytime he walked in here. Draco had insisted from the beginning that their bathroom must be luxurious, the height of all pampering, and he had gone all out. The space was immaculately decorated with white marble and gold accents, and there was even a chandelier in the middle of the room. The shower space had sixteen different jets. Most impressive was the tub, though. It was built into the floor with a bench spanning the entire inner perimeter with even more jets than the shower, similar to the Prefect’s bathroom at Hogwarts in both luxury and size. Draco had spared no expense in the craftsmanship of this one item, which cost more than all the other fixtures in the bathroom combined.
“I’m trying my best! I’m just not, er, the
Potter’s mouth opened and closed. No sound emerged.
Underneath the flowers, there was a note. Harry’s chicken scratch was messier than usual, evidence of the hastiness with which he had scrawled the note while Draco stood in the kitchen. It read,
“Who said you could call me Draco!” Draco squawked, attempting to steer Harry’s notice away from his blushing cheeks. It had felt...
“Harry, these are incredible. You really have a way of capturing mood and emotion on the page. These…” Draco swallowed, traced the line of his neck in one of the sketches, and did not say aloud,
“Nope.”
Slowly, sensually, Harry began to strip, all the while staring at the scenery outside and imagining that
“Okay, maybe not then.” Harry chewed his lip in thought. “How about staying at your parents’ place? It’s not so far from here. We could fly.” To strengthen his argument, Harry pulled their brooms from his pocket and Unshrunk them. They had been planning to fly in the first place, but the Squirmy Wormy Cataclysmal Clematis turned out to have a fear of heights and had uttered a very alarming shriek whenever they lifted it off the ground.
Today, there was no wave of crashing noises when he opened the door, which was both a good and bad thing. Draco had learned long ago during Scorpius’s toddler phase that silence was not actually a good thing.
. Harry gulped his own potion with a cry of “YOLO!” and waited for his kinky fantasies to overcome him.
Harry’s lips quirk up. “I might mention how sometimes I just look at you and my heart starts beating faster. I might even start talking about how much I think about your lips. It’s hard not to watch them, when you’re doing vocals. And then I start thinking about
even though they’ve been together for six years.”
At first, Draco didn’t see any signs of where Harry was putting the money. That was fine. Once the Galleons left Draco’s hands, it was no business of his where they went. He figured that Harry was saving them up, since he had no magical means to do so since he was barred from Gringotts.
“Actually,” Potter interjected. “If you don’t mind, I know a house elf who will probably sh—er,
a boyfriend?
As soon as the words were out, Potter’s entire body language shuttered. “No,” he replied succinctly. “My parents died when I was a baby and my aunt and uncle were horrid.”
“I can see that,” Draco replied faintly.
“No.”
since I last saw you on—” he checked his phone, ignoring Teddy’s squirming under his arm “—Wednesday, I believe your level of imbecile might
Not that he would ever have to do such a thing, of course.
He flopped back against the bed, arms cradling and stroking Potter-kitty. This was not what Draco’d expected after this latest round of fantastic sex with his on-again, off-again (recently, mostly on-again) fuckbuddy. He’d been anticipating another mindblowing round (or four) before awkwardly ushering Potter out of his flat after.
me?!”
Given the minuscule size of it, the salad course finished in a blessed absence of conversation. Harry made sure to look up every so often at Lucius and Narcissa and give little silent smiles even though his internal monologue was one drawn-out scream at how very awkward the whole thing was.
Harry looked at Draco incredulously. “Could you repeat that? I could have sworn you’d managed to outdo your usual insane ideas by a hundred miles, but that seems a bit extreme even for you.”
On a page opposite doodles of Draco’s profile and sleeping face (when did Harry see

“The potion is designed to take the imbibers through a series of fantasy visions tailored to the specific imbiber’s preferences in order to promote sexual arousal. The exact number of fantasies is highly individual and therefore cannot be predicted, but the length of time that the visions will last is approximately 30 seconds. Altogether, it takes about 30 seconds for the potion to take effect, and then the visions will last another 30 seconds for one total minute of incapacitation. The fantasies should not be taken to imply sexual attraction towards any real or extant person, place, or object. They are like dreams; figments of the brain’s expansive imagination that do not have any basis in real desire. You may see things that make you aroused, lustful, wanton, horny, whatever word you prefer, and after the fact you may wonder if you would actually like those things to happen in real life. To be absolutely clear, these visions are
Summoning the strap-on, Draco quickly put on the harness and positioned himself. Poised at the entrance to Harry’s hole, he couldn’t help but look up and tease. “Hmmm, Harry, I don’t know, do you think I should fuck you?”
Draco
Draco raised an eyebrow. “
"What? No! I'm in the shower! Are you crazy!" Harry shot back.
There was a lull of silence in which Draco mentally berated himself for his failure at conversational arts.
Scorpius’s significantly calmer behavior aside—though Draco would never downplay the relief he felt at returning home and finding the walls absent of blueberry jam, flour, or lacy ribbons— the change that felt more momentous was the addition of Harry Potter to his daily life.
“Resumés. It’s Jenkins’s last day on earth—I mean, in the lab. We’re hiring.”
“Sugar daddy? You don’t know about that?” At Draco’s incredulous look, Harry explained, “It’s kind of a gendered term, but a sugar daddy is someone who, ah, pays someone else, typically a younger woman. Usually in return the recipient of the money provides sex or a relationship, but not always. That already sounds like us, doesn’t it? There’s usually also a contract drawn up between the two people to clearly explain the terms of service.”
you’re going to come. Doesn’t that sound nice?”
Once the trickle of visitors had completely stopped, Harry closed the compartment door and cast a series of spells: one to make the frosted window appear dark, a Blurry Eyes Charm on the window itself, and then a Silencing Ward, a Privacy Ward, and a minor Repelling Ward. The spells came easily to him, as he’d practiced them extensively before ever exercising his kinky fantasy in the first place.

In Draco’s palm was a large chalky-looking sphere in all different shades of blue. Little waves were carved across the surface in white.
“Well, if you’d said you were ace, I was going to map out what your do’s and don’ts were, what you were comfortable with, stuff like that. If not, I thought we’d probably do, er,
“Alright.” Draco did so and heard several rustling sounds before Harry told him it was okay to turn back around.

Draco learned to move around Harry in the kitchen, learned Harry’s habits and likes. He knew that Harry didn’t care for green peppers but loved courgettes. He knew that Harry habitually left the light on in the bathroom before going to bed and would rush out a minute after closing his door to turn it off. He knew Harry looked fantastic in royal purple but balked at the flashy color, choosing for neutral blues, greens, and greys instead. He knew that Harry often hummed tunelessly when he was distracted. He knew that Harry moved restlessly even when he was sitting still.
“If you don’t get your dick in me within the next five seconds I’m finding someone else who will—”
Potter made a face. “They’re more interested in sending me their underwear than anything practical, it seems.”
For instance: should Draco avoid brushing by Harry in the kitchen now? Should he avoid spending time alone in a room with Harry? Maybe Harry would be able to
“Well—”
Draco eyed him strangely. “Are you sure? You know we get along better with your parents than mine.”
” Harry pulled away, laughing.
If he didn’t know better about himself, Draco would think… that he… had a… crush…
“YES!”
In the midst of his mental breakdown, the Floo flared again and Potter stepped in, eyes wild, brandishing an enormous bouquet of freshly Diffindo-ed wildflowers and dress robes that had clearly been haphazardly thrown on.
Harry flushed further. “Let me show you something.”
“—I never knew banshees had such nice bods, either.” Harry waggled his eyebrows meaningfully, but Draco didn’t see for long because he was now walloping Harry with a pillow, which in turn caused Harry to pick up his own pillow and give back as good as he got.
It was this tub that Draco made a beeline for. He turned on the faucets to begin filling it and then moved over to Harry’s side. The next several minutes were a pleasant blur as the two of them kissed, tongues leisurely swiping at each other and hands roaming, removing clothing as if they had all the time in the world (which they kind of did because the tub was huge and accordingly took lots of time to fill).
He’d worked hard to overcome the jeering after the war. It had taken introspection and ingratiating himself to more people than he cared to remember, in the hopes that one of them would invest in him and recommend him to others. Worth the effort, in the end, though at the time Draco hadn’t been certain.
Draco looked away in embarrassment. “I don’t really have any friends these days. No one from Hogwarts is still around, and those from my business are either sycophants, incompetent, or would rather swallow mud than willingly socialize with me.”
“Oh, is that so?” Lucius commented vaguely, his eyes glazed over like an American donut.
“Hey!” Potter protested. “This isn’t
“Ah, sorry about that Potter,” Draco quickly followed up.
Draco didn’t stand a chance. The pleasure building within him reached a sudden crest, His fingers squeezed tight on Harry’s and his back arched, and then his cock was pulsing come despite being untouched. Even as Draco’s arse clenched down in ecstasy, he noticed Harry’s hips shaking, his thrusts taking on an erratic rhythm. Draco looked up, and his eyes were half-closed, lip caught between his teeth in an expression Draco knew very well.
Draco flipped over again, restless with thought. It was surely pure sexual attraction. Draco had never felt romantic attraction to
Rilly beamed at him and disappeared from the dining room.
“Harry,” Draco said softly, all the love in the entire world contained within his eyes, “Over the past few years, you’ve shown me what love is and how to love even more than I thought was possible. From when we met at eleven years old to today, I’ve gone through every emotion under the sun with regard to you, and that’s how I know that the love I feel for you is special. I’ve thought so much about you these past few months and how best to propose, and in the end the answer was simple. I knew you would want to celebrate just the two of us and that you wouldn’t want anything over the top. Of course, since I’m involved, I still had to make sure the aesthetic was to my standards.” Both he and Harry laughed a little, a little snottily on Harry’s part because the happy tears were flowing at this point.
initiate that conversation next time you're in the shower."
These thoughts flashed through his bird mind in less than a second, and then Draco was lunging forward, his neck extending powerfully as he gripped the handle on the side of the bookcase. He flapped his wings wildly as he pulled and pulled and
“Do you see any holes in the roof from explosions? No. Also she sent him some Glitter Glamour Powder in the post after his last drunk-Owl, and after he spent three days with eyes that wouldn’t stop growing bigger he hasn’t said a word about her again.”
“I run a company that acts as a consultant to the Ministry’s Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and specializes in invasive species control. As the wixen world has become increasingly globalized—” Harry held back from his usual explanation that it was solely Magical Britain that was suddenly realizing that a whole world existed outside of its own arse and was unfortunately approaching globalization with an air of colonialism  “—there has been a proportional increase in the unwanted spread of plants and animals native to the Isles to places
"Once you find your seats, everyone," He called out to them smoothly, "Please open your folders to the work we left off on yesterday. We will be starting on our synonyms and antonyms for class today, until 11 o'clock. I will go over them with you, and then I will be collecting these in an hour."
Harry didn't know where he would go. He didn't know how, either. He knew, though, that he needed to find the place he has been longing for. He needed to find it, and fast so his aunt and uncle couldn't follow him. 'You're only missing after 24 hours', he kept repeating to himself in his head. 'You're only missing after 24 hours. You're only missing after 24 hours. You're only missing after 24 hours. 24 hours to find somewhere to hide so the police won't find you. 24 hours. 24 hours. 24 hours. 24 hours to find it.'
He has driven this way before, all his life in fact. Their was no official way to this forest. You can cross any road you liked, if you knew where you were going, the roads would take you here. There were some roads that no Muggle has ever seen before, some not even written down. They were created as the roads ran on.
"Sirius," Remus stood at the door. The pair looked back at him, not hearing him come in.
"We have a big house right up in the Forest of Dean, the forest goes on forever. You'd love it. Lots of trails to run down, lots of trees to get lost in." Sirius looked up at Remus, hoping he'd get his hint.
Harry closed the door behind him, and crept back downstairs where he fixed himself a couple plain pancakes. He liked waffles better, but Harry was hungry from having only sleep for dinner last night. Harry was grateful for anything, he held no preferences that didn't matter.
"Good morning Mr. Lupin." Harry beamed back at him.
The kitchen was off to the left, open and wide. It had a French build to it, with the stove vent come down on top of it, and windows on the ceiling opening everything up. The island in the middle of it all was the size of Harry's room back at the Dursley's. It had drawers and cabinets and a smooth black granite to it. The table off to the side was grand and all the chairs were pushed into it.
"That's for last night." His aunt retorted to him. "Don't think I forgot about it. I already told you, one of these days I'm going to set you straight and you won't like it."
"Well, Harry." Remus said finally. "I'm going to get class started, and then you and I are going to walk down to Mr. Tolson's office, alright? We're gonna get this all sorted out."
"Alright class!" Remus said loud and clear. The hum of children talking and laughing came to an abrupt stop. "Something new came up, so we're going to go through the rest of the worksheet, and then I will be calling for a sub for the rest of the day, alright?"
"Yeah," Harry wiped his snotty tears on his sleeve, "I was gonna run away today, and never come back." He gave a small hiccup.
While Harry was planning the angles of his death, Dudley was planning the angles of others, in his video game. Harry could he a quiet 'die, die, die!' come from the room upstairs. Harry made sure to bring his breakfast on time. Dudley was a stress eater. Well, not really. If what video games were inducing was 'stress', whoever classifies it as that must have a lot going for them.
Remus didn't trust them as far as he could throw them. And trust, he wanted to throw them.
The teacher was sitting in the waiting room, anxiously imagining his small Harry in a cold and empty room, sitting at a plastic table telling a bunch of strange adults he's never seen before about his experiences at home. Remus prayed that he wasn't telling them about his enhanced senses. Remus didn't know if Harry knew how to shift yet, or if he's never even tried. He was already risking exposure by bring him here, he didn't want to go back to the Council and tell them they had to clean up another mess.
Harry ran to his cupboard, gathered some clothes to put on, hurried back to the bathroom to throw them on, and stormed back to his cupboard. Shutting the door, he gathered all his clothes that fit in the corner of the room, and shoved them into his backpack that had all sorts of loose paper crumpled at the bottom. He then reached into the crevice of his bed, and stacked the book and flashlight on top of his clothes.
