“Can we get one, Luna?” asks Serafina, dark eyes hopeful.
Draco stares at him, posture rigid and wet hair everywhere, dirty and glittering and fragile. Slowly, he turns away and takes the wheel, resuming their journey along the country lane with the sun pouring in through the windows and the engine purring gently.
**~*~**
Draco grins, surprising himself. “I’m going to take that as a compliment.”
Ron carries the steaming dish to the table and looks between them with interest.
Harry laughs and studies the next one. “It is quite clear to me that Harry Potter is a member of the Bembledacks...? A secret society hell-bent on destroying the wizarding world as we know it. Why is nothing being done about this?”
Harry shoots her a dark look but continues to flounder, crossing his arms and looking, with his hair everywhere and his eyes on the ground, a lot like a sullen teenager. Draco, meanwhile, watches him covertly from his chair, colours pulsing rapidly.
“Thanks,” Harry says, startled. “They are, for want of a better phrase, tangled to fuck.”
“Yeah, just… zoned out for a minute there,” he lies, closing Thora’s card and picking up the next one in the pile.
Harry fidgets, attempting to pull the answer out of thin air and succeeding only in waking Stanley, who has for the past hour or so been sleeping nicely on Harry’s legs. He tacks loudly, flaps his wings and tumbles to the floor with a
“What’s your favourite Greek island, Draco?” Luna asks after watching the exodus.
A hand on his arm. A nice, cool hand.
“Ah.” Harry hesitates, trying to think of a way to tell his friend that he hasn’t tried it yet without mortally offending her.
Harry hesitates. “Do you want me to go, so you can…?”
“I liked school dinners,” Harry says. “They were comforting.”
Harry thinks that’s a rather strange image, but he doesn’t say so. He knows what’s coming next.
The words take some of the sting out of Harry’s bitten fingers and he tentatively offers Needle a small bunch of wild grasses. The swan snatches the food and then peers up at Harry, clearly attempting to decide whether or not to bite him again. Finally, he draws away and settles in the snow at Draco’s feet.
He curls back up at Draco’s side, and they share the beer in between lazy kisses and drifting touches. It is strong, just as William had said, and by the time most of the bottle has been emptied, Harry feels slightly lightheaded, though he can’t be certain if that’s due to the alcohol or the fact that Draco is now slicking his cock with more lavender oil and letting it slide slowly in and out of his fist. When he is refreshed, he sets the bottle down on the floor and nudges Harry over until his back is pressed against Draco’s chest.
“What the fuck, Draco?” Harry tries, but Draco is already Disapparating.
Harry doesn’t know what to say. For a minute or two, he says nothing, just watches Draco driving and glances down at the strange little object that apparently means so much.
Harry grins and hurries to catch up with the others, racing up the spiral staircase with a spring in his step that makes him feel ten years younger and prompts Shan to comment that something good has gotten into him. He ignores her cackle and Esmee’s suggestion that what’s gotten into him is almost certainly a
He opens it, recalling Hermione’s words as she had given it to him.
“I can’t keep what?” he demands, eyes glittering. “Tell me, please do, because I just know that you’ve got it all worked out!”
“A spa day,” Ginny says gloomily.
Stanley clicks and dangles nicely in her tight grip. He thinks he might be ready to go home, but he no longer has any idea where he is. The castle is big and so quiet at night, and without his friends, it’s hard to know which way to go.
Caroline’s face darkens at the mention of Hogwarts and Luna pats her on the shoulder.
Draco frowns. “Needle is an adult swan and I am not his mother.”
“I’m pretty sure we all stopped thinking for a while there,” he says with a grim smile. “You stay here and we’ll see if we can get this sorted.”
“It was never going to be straightforward, was it?” he says eventually. “You and me?”
The sudden coldness makes him click in alarm, but when he turns in circles in a futile attempt to see the problem, the sticky ice cream just clings to his shell, turning gloopy in the heat and making the cone stand up like a single pointed horn. Stanley tacks at Draco’s shoes, seeming to request help, but when he tries to remove the new accessory the beetle dashes away, trailing melted strawberry goo in his wake.
“I thought we…” Harry begins, and then Draco cuts him off.
“I’m waiting for Timothy. I called him just before I called you, but I’m assuming he decided to get dressed first,” Draco says with a flicker of a smile.
Draco pulls himself up onto the counter beside him and nudges Harry’s knee with his own.
Gareth shrugs. “I think he has a boyfriend. I think Draco is his boyfriend.”
, and the entire wizarding population will be looking for us.”
**~*~**
“It doesn’t need to be,” Draco mutters. He picks his way through the lights and addresses the bus from next to his leather chair. “Will you stop that? White lights? Red ones? I haven’t got any purple ones,” he sighs, pushing his hair out of his face in irritation.
Mr Abernathy is standing with his glossy black back to her, poking a cherry around the floor. She takes a deep breath, aims, and whispers the incantation. A split second later, a jet of warm yellow light hits the crow and envelops him. For a moment, he is lifted off his feet, and then he flops onto his side, cawing loudly and flapping his wings. Luna drops to the floor beside him and scoops him up.
“Do you think someone’s stealing the presents and carrying them off in a sack?” Timothy says, puzzled. “Like a horrible Father Christmas?”
“Yes.” Draco frowns. “Where are the goats?”
“The Christmas lights are out,” Jean sighs, and then stares at Harry. “My owls!”
“Don’t you think people should know what’s going on?” Timothy asks.
Wrapping him tightly in cold, stiff arms, Harry buries his face in Draco’s hair and breathes him in, feeling his whole body sing with belonging. Draco’s fingers slip into his hair and he sighs, letting go of everything that doesn’t matter to this, now, here.
“Right,” he manages, heart hammering a fierce, uneven rhythm as Draco disentangles himself and stalks off into the bathroom.
Eilish either doesn’t hear or doesn’t appear to notice, so focused is she on peering into the instrument, and when she lets out a shriek of surprise, everyone around the table jumps.
“Shh,” Ginny hisses, “You’ll miss them doing the jumper.”
“I eat fine, I promise,” Harry says, heart twisting. “It would have been nice to have been six foot, but I don’t think it’s going to happen.”
“Talking to Lee,” Pansy says as the door swings shut behind the receptionist. “Plenty of comments about the old dears, apparently.”
Jean laughs. “Good point. If he’s going, I’m going too. I’ll take my camera.”
“Do you really need to know exactly how many there are?” Draco asks. He just can’t help it.
“I think it did. Are you going to do it?”
Harry looks down at his polka dot boxer shorts, his worn old Gryffindor t-shirt and his suspiciously new-looking pair of red slippers.
Molly beams and then instantly shrugs off the praise. “Well, I’ve had a lot of time to get them right. It’s nice to have something to do.”
Hermione gazes at her daughter. “Rosie, I’m not sure how to argue with that. Come on, we need to get home and have some lunch.” She smiles at Harry. “Thanks for having him. I’m sorry we have to rush off.”
“Absolutely not,” Lee says, hopping from one foot to the other with surprising energy. “I can’t... policies and procedures, you see... oh, you’ll have to bear with me, young man, I’m feeling a bit funny. It’s this coffee, I think... shame, there was some lovely stuff in the back of the cupboard a few weeks ago...”
Harry stands up straight and folds his arms. His most recent scratches and burns are healing nicely, Draco notes to himself.
The screaming, struggling picture of Granger seems to rage up at Draco from the floor.
“We don’t have any money,” Harry admits, feeling stupid. Not for the first time, he curses his impulsiveness. Had he thought this through for even a moment, he could have...
“Sixty-seven.”
Just as quickly, Mr Jennings’ face hardens and he looks over at Timothy.
“By whom,” Draco mumbles, and then covers his face with his hands. “I don’t know where that came from.”
“Okay, so is everybody ready?” Harry asks some hours later, and the ladies gathered around the table in their coats nod seriously. “Draco?”
“That bottle was half empty,” he says. He slides his hand down between them and grips his cock as Draco fucks him deeply, both of them now moaning softly with each stroke. “Have you been up here, thinking of me and…”
“Dearest Draco and Harry,” he begins, already smiling. “We of the biddy club offer you the gift of time and space. Now that you have found each other, you must strengthen your bond in a place where elderly passengers and the obligations of the modern world do not exist, at least for you and at least for a few days. Your Portkeys leave at 2pm on the 31
“It does not mean that,” he says, but Serafina is no longer listening.
“I could do without the spiders in my bed,” Draco says.
Mr Borteg regards him gloomily. “Harry, are you certain that your family wants me at their table on Christmas day?”
Harry nods vaguely. “We are.”
Harry directs him into a chair and pours the coffee, releasing the rich scent into the air and watching Draco’s eyes close gratefully.
“Don’t stop,” Draco says after a moment. “You didn’t...”
“Flavours are very important,” Harry says.
“You were wearing a party hat,” Hermione reminds him.
Harry looks at Needle and then at Draco, who is listening with an odd little smile. As they lean against the counter, their fingers brush together and neither one of them moves away. Rose turns her paper around to show a picture of a sad-faced swan and a star covered in glitter.
“Such a lovely accent,” Hannah sighs, fiddling with her wine glass.
“You watch television?” Harry asks, staring at him.
**~*~**
The fog shifts slightly, bringing the lights of the London Eye out of the gloom and making it hang there in the distance like a shimmering, circular spectre. Harry slows to admire it and immediately finds himself knocked off balance as the person behind him collides with his back.
“Divide and conquer,” Draco approves.
“That’s for you to find out, you’re stuck with me now,” Draco says, picking out a pair of skates and sitting down on the bench to put them on.
“I bet Professor McGonagall will know what to do with you,” the girl says suddenly, and she tucks Stanley under her arm and starts walking.
“Any chance you can drop me off at the Leaky Cauldron?” he asks, and Draco frowns.
With that, Reuben hurries back into his shop, where a queue is already forming.
Harry shrugs, mouth tugging into a smile that makes Draco feel a little bit breathless.
“That’s not very nice, Gareth. Mary Ann can’t help it if you’re so fussy.”
In thoughtful silence, they walk back past the fields and over the hills in search of goats, but even the two they had almost captured are nowhere to be seen. The sun is warm despite the swirling wind, and Harry rolls up the sleeves of his jumper, swiping his hair out of his eyes and stumping up one fierce incline after another with Draco at his side.
The memory washes over Harry in an instant and he forces himself to nod as though it’s fine and he isn’t burning up inside with embarrassment and helpless arousal.
“‘Dissenting voters: Reuben, Mr Borteg, Jean, Mrs Purley, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.’”
“Can’t be sure on that, Draco, some little bugger’s had the clock from my desk,” comes the dry response, and Draco turns.
His last words are muffled as she hugs him tightly. When his green fur tickles her nose and makes her sneeze, she pulls back.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Because it’s a nice, happy event and I’d like you to be there with me. Is that so strange?”
“It’s not a fan of the cold,” he explains.
“That’s where your mother comes in,” Ginny says, smiling at Draco.
“Hmm?” Draco looks up, blinking.
“Yeah,” George nods. “Angelina said I shouldn’t use the word ‘even’. Said it might cause offence.”
Holding onto his remaining grapes for dear life, Harry attempts to steady himself, anchoring his racing heartbeat to the throbbing vibration of the floor and reminding himself firmly that nothing is going to happen. However often those eyes might drift in his direction, Draco had pulled away from him and said that their kiss was a mistake. Well, Harry concedes, he had said that he didn’t know what he really meant, so he might as well not have said anything at all.
Luna hides a smile. “And why is that?”
“I don’t think he managed to damage any of them,” Draco says, with a little more hope than confidence.
“Do you have to talk about them while I’m bothering you at work?” Draco asks, pulling back to fix Harry with a long-suffering expression.
Harry laughs, surprising himself. “Exactly.”
“Oh, no,” Ida says. “He’s very busy, you see.”
Draco smiles slowly. “I’ll be home soon.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. When he opens them, he is looking at Draco as though he wants nothing more than to step forward and strangle him.
“That’s meaningless! Ridiculous!” he insists, leaning away from Needle. “That bloody thing hisses all the time!”
Timothy wrinkles his nose. “My mum thought it would be a good idea.”
They find Narcissa out in the garden, long pale hair fluttering in the breeze as she sweeps her wand slowly around the table, creating a shimmering bubble that shatters each snowflake into fine glitter on contact. She smiles to see them but holds onto her cast, drawing the spell carefully along the table until it seals itself and settles with a shiver.
“Is he alright?” Harry asks.
Harry sprawls comfortably for a moment, watching Draco walk down the stairs without a stitch of clothing, Juno capering at his heels. Amused, he gets out of bed and swipes condensation from the nearest window with his palm. Juno is soon visible, leaping from one patch of snow to the next and rolling around in delight, but there is no sign of the previous night’s festivities. The only evidence that any of it happened at all is a rectangular indentation in the grass where the sausage stall had stood.
“From whom did you obtain this memory?”
they explode?”
“One down, fifteen to go,” Draco murmurs, looking rather pleased with himself despite having spent the entire journey to the barn doing nothing but chatting away to the goat about the weather.
“He wouldn’t,” Ginny agrees, squeezing Louis’ hand and sipping from a gleaming pint of stout.
“Wonderful, now no one is making sense,” Draco mutters, but he emerges from his corner and positions himself at the back of the group, tentatively copying Luna’s movements with an expression so serious that she wants to dive into the prop chest and start flinging scarves at him.
“Yep,” Harry says, swimming slowly to join him. “Looks like our friend Angus is a very grumpy trout.”
“That’s one way of putting it, but hey… let’s forget all the crap for a minute, okay?” Harry says, knowing he has to be the first to break. “I like you, Draco. I really like you. I meant what I said last night. I’m not going anywhere. I don’t care how complicated your life is… if you want me to be part of it, I will be. Because I like you,” he finishes, already knowing that it’s so much more than that.
Draco’s eyebrows disappear into his hairline. “Luna. No. Just… no.”
“Would you like to swap it?” Draco asks, but the little boy shakes his head.
Harry laughs. “I doubt it, but it’s probably better to be safe than sorry.”
“You bought all that whisky and couldn’t try any of it, so I gave this bottle to Mr Borteg and asked him to take the alcohol out of it,” Harry explains, suddenly feeling nervous. “It should still taste the same, but there won’t be any of that spinny feeling that you don’t like.”
“I believe the ladies have just brewed a fresh pot of tea,” Draco says, startling Harry out of his thoughts. “If you’ve quite finished staring at me.”
“Upstairs,” Draco says urgently, pulling back to meet Harry’s eyes.
“Where the actual fuck did this come from?” he asks, regarding it with astonishment.
He stares at Ginny. “Does it matter?”
“No,” the girl says, wrapping shivering arms around the stapler. “No, thank you. I like it.”
“Do you miss her?” Harry asks, knowing it’s a stupid question.
Mr Jennings rubs at his beard and leans on his doorframe. “Quills and inks need no ornament, young Miss Weasley.”
“I didn’t think you’d feel like talking,” he says irritably.
“Just eat it.”
“No,” Harry says, surprised. “He’s with the bi—erm, with the ladies,” he amends quickly.
“And people were… not terrified?”
“Is this the part where I should ask you if you’re scared?” Draco says, and Harry just stares at him, eyes caught by the striking lines of long legs in dark jeans, emerald cotton against pale skin, arms folded in a challenge that takes him back years.
“My life is very complicated,” Draco says, releasing him and taking a step back. “I think we… maybe we could start again?”
“We just thought you should know that Rose isn’t going to be playing the giraffe now,” Hermione whispers. “She’s going to be head bird.”
“I won’t,” he says, and Harry sighs, knowing just how hot-headed his friend can be. Once he’s got something between his teeth, he shakes and shakes until it comes apart.
“I promise I will,” he says, warmed by the concern.
“Where’s your mother?” Eliza asks.
Slowly, most of the people who had looked turn back to watch the last few minutes of the eclipse, but Luna heads towards Caroline, stepping carefully in the darkness.
“You just about got here in time,” says Ginny, hurrying over with a couple of steaming glass mugs. “Ginger mulled mead,” she informs them, handing over the glasses and smirking without a shred of shame as Draco thanks her.
“Shut up,” Draco whispers, pulling back and driving into Harry, quickening his pace until all they can do is stare at each other and hold on.
“No, thank you, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, casting a mournful glance around the shop and disappearing back into the distillery without another word.
“Hi,” Harry says, and she looks up crossly. When she sees him, though, she smiles.
Harry nods. “We’ve made you a copy of all our notes, and if you want to come back to my shop—that’s Borteg’s, at the top of the alley—I think we can…” Harry pauses as someone comes barrelling across the cobbles and almost knocks them over. “Sophie? Are you okay?”
When the little telephone is held out to her, Luna looks at the screen. Sure enough, there is a picture of a plate of toast with marmalade. One of the pieces has had a bite taken out of it.
Draco leans over him, eyes silver-bright, pinning him with one hand either side of his shoulders.
“You see! You did need him!” Ginny exclaims, and Hermione meets Harry’s eyes.
Harry frowns and goes to peer at the object. “Oh,” he says, rubbing at his hair in embarrassment. “After the… er… well, I wrapped a load of stuff from the shop so it looked like we had presents under the tree. Did you just… collect everything?”
Harry smiles. “I know.”
“Where’s Stanley?” he croaks, trying to shift in Harry’s arms.
As Rose and the other birds arrange themselves around the eel and the piano starts up for another song, Danica leans over and whispers:
Draco balls up a piece of parchment and throws it at her before settling in his chair and clicking on his omnivox.
Mrs Purley ducks behind the counter and grabs a sack. She spreads it out so he can see ‘Goodman’s Quality Cheeses’ stamped across the fabric in dark blue ink.
Harry gazes up at the lights and shrugs. “I don’t know. I keep focusing on the fact that it’s Shan and Esmee’s wedding tomorrow and… god, if they try to ruin it…”
“Yes, Eilish. I’ll be here tomorrow.”
“It’s very cold for him out here,” Danica says, poking through her enormous handbag. “Juno and Montague are coming with us, are they not?”
Harry follows them out into the crisp morning, inhaling the bitter scent of winter and something new, something savoury and spicy and delicious. Now that the snow has melted and the bracing wind is back, the aroma wafts into his nostrils and starts to pull him down the street towards the fountain. When he glances at Draco, though, he stops, caught by the bewildered look on his face.
“Right. I’ll set it up on the overhead rack and then we can all be in it,” he says, and when he has done so, he perches on the arm of Harry’s chair, leaning against him and flooding him with a tide of aching, jittery warmth.
“That’s a familiar name.”
“Draco,” Harry says softly, and then stops, cut off by an almost deafening rumble of water and rock.
“These are deities of the Yoruba religion,” the woman says. “In Nigeria, we may see them in human form but here, I have worked with many practitioners to capture the
Five minutes and three bites later, Harry is heading for the Leaky Cauldron, carrying a damp cardboard box containing a lightly stunned swan. Though clearly drowsy and a lot more compliant than before, the swan is still conscious and shifting around inside the box, causing Harry to pitch from side to side with the momentum of its massive bulk. People are looking, and of course they are. At best he looks pissed as a newt and at worst, like he’s completely lost his mind.
wouldn’t dare,” he says, folding his arms.
When Stanley bumps against his legs, he glances down at him and has to stifle a sound of surprise. Chewing on his lip, Harry lets his eyes drift over Draco’s stack of blank parchments, the carpet, and the front cover of
It isn’t that he doesn’t care any more, but things are different now.
Pansy sighs and kisses his cheek, leaving behind the slightly waxy sensation of her lipstick.
Stanley trundles towards the jars with purpose, knocking off the lids with his antennae and bumping into the glass jars one by one, each hitting the carpet with a soft thud-swoosh gentle enough to evade Draco’s attention completely and leaving Harry free to watch with delight as Stanley capers back and forth in a multicoloured ocean of ink.
Mr Abernathy shakes his tail appreciatively and resumes pecking at the apple.
Draco glances at her with a small smile. “I said I didn't dance. I never said I couldn't.”
“Stop it,” Draco instructs, nudging the swan away and offering him some greens from his pocket. “My point is, why does everyone think I made him that way?”
“Juno…” Harry sighs, wincing when the heavy cat once more leaps onto his lap, ears twitching furiously.
“Wonderful, isn’t it?” Horace says, standing beside her and watching the slowly-advancing dark shape.
When something flies into the window and crashes with a damp thud, his eyes fly open and he is surprised to see Eilish beaming and getting to her feet.
“Ten past three? I think so.”
“You remembered?” Harry mumbles, and Draco shrugs as though it’s nothing, but it’s not. He knows it’s not. It’s everything, and just for a moment, the world beyond the Knight Bus ceases to exist.
“I don’t think it tastes very nice either,” he tells Hugo, who opens his mouth in a trembling wail. “Why don’t we try it another way?”
“I doubt you’ve had time,” Harry says, imagining the restaurant in uproar as kitchen staff, customers and Malfoys alike are terrorised by a furious swan.
In the chaos of surprised stumbling and trampled feet that follows, Harry stands in silence. He’s rather excited about the next stage of their evening. It’s been a long time, and he can’t help holding his breath as he waits. For long seconds, nothing happens, and then the hulking purple shape leaps out of the fog with an almighty crash, forcing everyone to step back as one. The bus seems to shimmer in the fog, radiating an aura of magic and nostalgia strong enough to make Harry’s heart race in his chest.
Harry stares at him and Neville shrugs and looks away.
“I don’t know,” Danica says, but when she leans forward to get a better look, the mouse takes off, spooked, and runs straight into the sleeping form of Montague.
“Alright, one last thing,” Florean calls, getting to his feet. “This patrol officer—call me a pessimist but I suspect he or she will be an utter greenhorn and will need all the help they can get. Any volunteers for going door-to-door and around the street, collecting statements and such?”
“No, boys, this is your show.”
“Shall we put it on the tree, Uncle Harry?” Rose asks, the moment her parents have left for work.
“Tack tack tack tack tack,” he says gently, poking an antenna into soft blond hair.
On Sunday morning, Harry is startled from a heavy sleep by the sound of scraping, whooshing, and finally coughing from his bedroom fireplace. Caught between alert suspicion and the last threads of a dream about driving the Knight Bus while having his hair stroked by a ghostly, pale figure, he scrambles upright, grabs his wand and yells, “Malfoy, stop it!”
Despite having found himself stuck with a sequinned pair, Harry counts himself lucky. Lee’s are pink and fluffy, and Percy, who had arrived late, is now wearing a majestic headdress including antlers that play a tinny version of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ whenever they are touched.
Harry holds the bunch away from him. “Hermione Granger’s only weakness.”
Harry’s heart stutters painfully and he turns to stare at Draco. “I’m sorry. Seriously. I didn’t realise. What did you do with it?”
“And how long is that, exactly?” Draco asks.
“What’s that?” asks Serafina.
“The crocodile,” Draco supplies.
“I’m hot, too,” Draco says solemnly, touching Deb’s hand and then Harry’s.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco says, sliding cold fingers into his hair and kissing him again. “I love you.”
“If I hurt him, you’re going to hurt me?” Harry says before he thinks better of it.
“I’m not looking at you like anything. You’re imagining it,” Harry says, grinning like a loon.
And an odd little smile steals across McGonagall’s lips.
“No, but a mouse would be worse,” Harry says, getting to his feet and scooping it up. “He could get under the pedals and cause a crash.”
Draco is right; she looks well, seemingly delighted to be back at the table with her friends. Even Thora, who is still peering sourly at her from under her pointed hat, gets a bright smile when she looks around the table and then finally sets eyes on Harry.
“I suppose not,” he says, mouth suddenly dry. “I’m still not sure he should come with us.”
When night falls and everyone gathers in the living room to listen to carols on the wireless, he sits on the floor and lets Hugo fall asleep on his lap. He’s totally fine, and all of this is lovely, just like it always is, comforting and familiar and right, but whenever a car passes the bottom of the lane, the headlights make him catch his breath whether he likes it or not.
“He can sense your guilt,” Draco says. “You left it at all those scenes and then you broke into my restaurant and he knew something was wrong.”
“Well, this… us… I do realise that it isn’t following the usual plan,” he says, frowning, and if Harry didn’t know better, he’d think he was nervous. “It’s been a while,” he adds quietly.
“All done, lads?” William calls, and a second or two later, he strides into view, loaded down with metal buckets.
“Okay, but before we go, there’s something I need to tell you about the duck house...”
“Thank you for rescuing my beetle,” he says, ignoring Harry’s snort of amusement and attempting to retain an air of dignity. After all, it might be the only bit he gets today. “Thank you for not eating him. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to take him back to the castle now.”
“It wasn’t my idea, you know, it was Hermione’s,” Harry says, a little too quickly.
“No, Mr Weasley, they are not too short. I fitted those robes to you exactly, and I would have done so much more quickly if you had trusted me at any point,” she sighs, hanging on to the measuring tape around her neck and looking rather harassed.
,” the woman cries, leaping to her feet and gripping her bare wrist.
“Merry Christmas to all!” Florean calls, emerging from his shop and waving a red-gloved hand. “Did you bring the presents?”
“Yeah, but I’m rubbish at concealment charms,” Timothy admits. “I was hoping that one of you might…”
Harry smiles, flooded with warmth for Molly and her love of a house packed full to bursting.
“I’ll come but if Rita Skeeter turns up, I’m hiding behind Sam.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t notice,” he says, stretching out one leg and resting his ankle against Draco’s. “You can be very… distracting. In a good way. And I think it’s brilliant. My own chair! Thank you.”
“You could have healed these with magic,” Draco says, fingers trailing over Harry’s skin so gently that his breath hitches in his chest.
“Luna, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco says as the music starts up again. “Are we supposed to start this one in a square or a circle?”
The ladies laugh delightedly, and it’s almost enough to stop Harry wondering how Draco is getting on with an unimpressed dachshund under his feet.
“Yes. This is it.”
When the clock strikes for midnight, he stirs and trundles to the kitchen, half-awake and half something else completely. He gulps down water, staring out at the dull night sky, and then returns to his position with a large, steaming mug of tea.
“No, and it’s only one of the biggest shopping days of the year,” George says crossly.
“Do you want to come for lunch with me?”
Harry remembers dancing—or at least his best attempt—under plastic palm trees somewhere in the North East; he remembers Fred and George performing a wobbly but spirited jig on the bar of a wizarding pub in Wales; he remembers a very spicy kebab that his stomach now very much regrets, and he remembers the Knight Bus.
“I’m really dirty,” Harry says, already knowing that Draco’s sheets will be immaculate. “Do you mind if I go and at least try to scrub some of this off?”
Shan picks up a small device from the counter and shows it to Harry, looking rather dazed.
Harry yawns and stretches. “Now?”
Harry stares at him for a moment and then shrugs. “Okay.”
“Praise indeed,” Harry says, secretly delighted by this review.
The sight of it fortifies him and he stands up straight. “Right. Can I have a black cherry crackleball, please?”
“Kicked a pigeon,” Ginny says, face darkening.
Outside, the wind howls and the raindrops hammer through the hole in the roof and into the bucket. Draco sighs heavily.
Draco takes the parcel and unwraps it slowly, revealing a jumper in Knight Bus purple with a glittering white triple-decker and the promised cat.
“I’m sorry.” He drops his quill and sags in his chair, reaching up to swipe at his hair. “I really am sure he’s fine, though. He’ll probably be back in tomorrow like always.”
Hugo giggles. “Kingsley!”
“There, all paid for,” Miss Lister says. She looks at Needle, who is still sitting nicely in the corner, touching her repaired pearl bracelet with a small smile. “I’d better go. I hope you have the most wonderful wedding.”
The vast red setter drops to the tiles and fixes his master with liquid brown eyes. Amused, Harry turns back to his task of stirring the custard before Molly notices and loses faith in what she calls his ‘lovely steady hand’.
“I was joking,” he says, but his nostrils twitch with interest at the smell of the fresh hot sandwiches inside the bag.
Luna turns, along with several other people in the vicinity, first to look at the cart and then at Caroline.
“How are you feeling, Ida?” he asks, just as the bus lurches violently, sending everyone scrabbling for their boxes and the little mouse cage flying off the table and onto the floor, where it rolls twice and then comes to a halt inches from Juno’s twitching whiskers.
“I have been trying to tell you,” Draco says, stuffing the menu back into his coat. “Good food, well-cooked, does not have to be pretentious. You’ve been making fun of my restaurant for years. I’m ready for my apology at any time.”
Draco pulls the lever to open the doors and then disappears out of sight. Intrigued, Harry climbs on board, waits for the doors to close behind him and then proceeds into the main body of the bus, where he finds Eilish, Corrie, Danica, and Ida seated around their usual table and Draco hurrying to join them. All but Eilish are scrutinising playing cards and glancing at little piles of Knuts at their side, while Eilish, sporting a bright green croupier’s visor, oversees the whole thing and keeps an eye on the larger pile of bronze coins in the centre of the table.
“Alright,” Eilish says, holding up her hands. “Corrie, I will whisper to you what cards you have because I am not playing, I’m just dealing. Okay?”
“Ten million years,” he says with a huge sigh, and she has to try very hard to bite down on her laughter as she looks down at his tousled fair hair and utterly exasperated little face.
“Clever Needle,” Draco murmurs. “I knew he sensed something that night. He’s probably known about this for weeks.”
“Thank you,” Harry mouths to Florean, who just smiles and turns to look at Rose.
“She looks really well, actually.”
Harry says nothing and Draco shakes his head, immediately lifting a hand from the wheel to tuck a stray swathe of hair behind his ear. Today’s shirt is a rich sort of wine colour, and Harry finds himself drawn to the way it sits in bold contrast against the pale skin of Draco’s neck. He seems to have aged well and is changed barely at all from then young man Harry last saw—at least saw for certain—at the age of eighteen. All of his lines are still sharp and sweeping, and as he urges the bus along a winding country road, concentration makes his profile harsher still.
“Daddy, don’t talk with your mouth full,” Rose says helpfully.
Following a ride in a floating chair and a short trip home on the Knight Bus, Ida is installed in her most comfortable armchair, with Montague on her lap and her friends fussing around her, delighted to have something to do at last. Eilish builds and charms an enormous fire in the grate, while Corrie arranges Ida’s pillows and blankets and Danica bustles around in the vast kitchen, putting together a tea tray for a table that plans to stay put.
“Neither are elephants, but that doesn’t stop my son putting a whole box full of them on his tree every year,” Audrey says brightly. “Light-up, they are, and all different colours.”
Harry laughs. “Isn’t she a bit young?”
The stall is surrounded by the shimmer of magic, as, Harry now realises, is the bonfire. He can see the lights of a small town in the near distance, and it is odd to think that the occupants cannot see him. They have no idea that this strange event, about which he still has many questions, is even taking place, and there is something about the whole thing that makes him suspect that it has been taking place for many years.
“Oh,” Harry says, words yanked away from him by the admission. “I had no idea.”
And Harry, somehow, is her friend. Harry and Hermione and Ron and George and Ginny, Neville and Blaise and Draco Malfoy. They are all her friends, and she is theirs. They are a strange little group, at the centre of which she inexplicably finds herself, gently holding them all together. Having spent so much of her life at the fringes of things, it’s all a bit startling, but she believes firmly that everything happens for a reason, and as such, she has a plan.
“Yes,” she says, turning to check on Rose, “and as far as they’re concerned, I’m a mad person. Why wouldn’t I tamper with my own memory to make them look bad?”
“Fuck the Inner Eye,” he says as they crunch their way down the drive.
As they walk out into the corridor, the editor calls out to them: “I’m sorry, gentlemen, but this business is what it is.”
“Probably, but if we scare them away, they’ll never be caught,” Reuben says with a sigh.
“Oh, yeah,” says the large, hairy one with the most wonderful lap. “I suppose I could go back and get a smaller one, but yeh’ve got to have a proper do of it at Christmas.”
“Draco?” he mumbles, surprised when he lifts his head and it no longer hurts.
“You knocked over my peace lily, you little reprobate,” he chastises, booting Stanley away from his feet so that he can inspect the damage. “Ivy and Magnus got me that. They thought it might make me more…”
“Right,” Draco says after a moment of silence. “I’m just going to close this now.”
Everything Draco is wild in his veins, pulling him tight and stretching him thin with wanting. It’s been a strange journey, like nothing he has ever experienced before, and though he knows now, he
Harry puts on his coat, picks up his carrots and heads out into the cold evening. When he reaches the cottage, he balls up his uncomfortable feelings and stuffs them into a dark corner. Ron and Hermione’s house is full of light and laughter; he can already hear Rose and her mother chatting away over the hiss of whatever dreadful thing he’s about to have for dinner, and he isn’t going to ruin it by stomping in with his confusion and getting it all over everyone.
Just as Harry opens his mouth to respond, the sky seems to darken in an instant and cold, hard raindrops begin to hammer down, bouncing off the surface of the loch and stinging their bare skin. Without a word, they gather their dirty clothes and William’s crate and dash for the cabin, locking the door behind them and standing side by side at the window for long minutes, just watching the downpour.
She gets to her feet. “Listen… I know we’ve been really busy lately, and I thought maybe you could come over tomorrow night for dinner. Ron’s doing a big shepherd’s pie and we can open a bottle of wine and catch up,” she says, regarding him hopefully.
“You shouldn’t make assumptions,” Hermione says, and then sighs. “It’s fair, though. What are you going to do next?”
“I don’t know if he really meant it, but I certainly think it’s worth talking to her. I haven’t done that section of the street yet anyway.”
“Needle, come here,” Draco mutters, waving a bunch of his favourite grass until he grabs it and settles down at their feet.
“I can’t be quiet,” he murmurs, dragging Draco into another kiss and then another. “I’ve never been very good at following instructions.”
The spectacle doesn’t stop when Harry puts his wand away and turns to Draco, nor when Draco leans close, certain this time, and kisses him, slipping his fingers into soft, chaotic hair and sighing his relief into the mouth that reaches for his. Harry’s fingertips brush against his neck, making him shiver, and they both smile into the kiss, sliding tongues together and slowing down to nothing but warmth and connection and the silent promise of everything.
“Juno and I were just about to go for a walk.” He hesitates, looking away from Harry and focusing on his cat, who is already rolling around on her back in the snow. “You’re welcome to join us.”
“And why did you do that?” Officer Kettleworth demands, lurching from diffidence to overconfidence with alarming speed. He retrieves his notebook and stands with pen poised.
Ron hesitates. Looks over at Hermione, who just silently shakes her head.
Yes, Draco’s life is complicated, he thinks bitterly. It’s complicated because he drives that fucking bus every minute of every day and lies his arse off so that nobody finds out.
“‘He’s my guilty pleasure crush!’” Pansy reads gleefully from one of Lofty Lee’s parchments, and Draco doesn’t even need to look up from the Eye in the Sky to know that she is broadcasting this comment over the entire network.
“Have you any idea how long you were looking at those pork pies?”
“That’s right,” Harry agrees. “I’m very exciting.”
, Harry decides, and then giggles, because he’s pretty sure that’s already a word.
Startled, Luna peers down to see him sitting on a cushion by her feet, calmly arranging building blocks into neat pyramids.
“That was clever,” Kettleworth says. “My mum says I’m useless at cleaning charms.”
Harry nods weakly and steps inside, barely pulling his coat out of the way as Draco yanks the doors closed behind him. He drops his coins into the scoop and reaches for the curtain, sensing that he will have a warmer reception from the ladies.
“You’d think that maybe... once that story was played out, people like Rita fucking Skeeter might leave him alone. But no.” Harry lets out a humourless bark of laughter.
“Or seven,” Draco says. “Perhaps it’s Mr Borteg
“Draco can speak French?” Caroline asks, eyes wide. “Wow.”
“Don’t you want to see in the dark?”
Harry smiles. “Okay, but did you have to say I was taking Draco to the wedding?”
do?” Draco prods, one corner of his mouth pulling into a smile.
It’s just the sofa. Molly and Arthur’s sofa. He also appears to be wearing his dress robes, no doubt crumpled to hell, his shoes, and a hat that doesn’t belong to him. The matter of the warm, gently breathing thing sprawled on top of him remains uncertain, but there’s something about the smell of lemons and—he thinks—gin that stirs his memory.
Intrigued, Harry unties the ribbon from the bright red box and removes the lid. Inside, a layer of tissue paper conceals most of the contents, but a folded note sits on top. He smoothes it out, admiring the quality of the parchment under his fingers and the neat copperplate handwriting that almost certainly belongs to Eilish. He reads it aloud.
“These are not pieces of a soul, sir. The representation of the Orisha is pure energy. They are not hurt and they cannot hurt you.”
“Want me to come with you?” Harry offers, stopping just short of holding out his arm.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles back. “Yesterday was… well, you know what it was like. You were there.”
The others quickly pick up the challenge, breaking into song whenever they spy Harry in the corridors, dancing along with him and giggling themselves breathless. By dinnertime, he is limping slightly but seems to have given up trying to fight. His eyes are bright with helpless laughter and his glimmer wraps around him like a burning scarlet cape.
“We could make him little shoes,” says the dark-haired girl, picking up two little round discs from the brightly-coloured game they seem to have been playing.
“Okay,” Harry manages, grabbing his wand and pulling Draco close.
“I respect that, Draco,” Narcissa says at last. “However, Needle is missing you and he has pulled four squares off my quilt.”
“So it would seem. At least you don’t have to carry him around in a box any more,” Draco says, and when Harry looks at him, his eyes are so warm that his heart skips uncomfortably.
Harry laughs, but Ida fixes the back of Draco’s head with stern little eyes. “You behave yourself,” she reproves. “We must save the bristle beetle. They’re very important. My garden is full of them,” she says proudly. “It’s mating season, you know.”
To Harry’s astonishment, the enormous bird just ruffles its feathers and continues to stare up at Draco. The absence of hissing, biting and general malevolence is rather unsettling.
“I’ll stroke you later, okay?” he mumbles, displacing her again. “Draco, your cat is being odd.”
She isn’t worried as such, but Harry’s absence does prey upon her mind a little, and when the staff team gather the children the following day to announce the final total and he is still nowhere to be seen, she begins to think that something may be wrong. Perhaps she has meddled in his affairs a little too much. Perhaps he is angry with her, or worse, with Draco. Still, she smiles and stands beside Sam as he tells the children that they have raised enough money for a piano as well as a selection of other musical instruments.
“I saw William Boot yesterday,” Hermione says casually.
and her old housemate Terry Boot, who had turned out to be Jayne’s second cousin, once removed. Ginny, of course, has no idea that her chance encounter was anything but, nor does she have any idea that Luna was hiding behind a cart full of cabbages, snapping a photograph for her book and making sure everything went just as planned. There is, after all, a possibility that she might think that was
“I don’t know,” Harry whispers, attempting to pull his laughter under control. He’s still wheezing slightly as he adds: “Something just came over me.”
“Neither did I,” Harry says, watching the now whispered exchange between the driver and the old man, after which Mr Barleycorn creaks off to bed.
“It’s not because I’m ashamed,” he’d said, the first time he’d caught her staring at it—the day, in fact, that he’d turned up at the home and announced, in slightly shaky tones, that he was ‘here to help’. “It’s because I was sick of looking at it. It means death. This means life, because I want to live.”
A murmur runs through the crowd and Harry turns to look at Shan and Esmee, who are almost unrecognisable in their winter cloaks and hats.
As he works through his bowl of melting, hot/cold perfection, he watches the place fill up until each table is surrounded by people and the clinking sound of spoons against glass starts to rival the rumble of conversation.
Harry laughs. “God, no. The more the merrier. Anyway, they aren’t giving them away. They’re two pounds each. The kids have decided to give the money they make to an animal charity.”
“Suit yourself,” she says, shrugging. “Tell you what, though—it’s a funny old wind today. One wrong gust and your face’ll stay that sour forever.”
“What are you going to do if she doesn’t answer? Break in?”
Something thrilling flickers in Draco’s eyes. “How so?”
**~*~**
Draco frowns. “What?”
“I blew up an oven once,” Otis says matter-of-factly. “It’s probably better if you haven’t done something like that.”
By the time he rejoins the world, dragged forcibly by a determined Ron and Hermione, May is slipping into June, and the dust is finally beginning to settle over the wizarding community.
“Bloody awful,” Jean supplies. She sits in her chair and gathers her blanket. “Have a biscuit, lads, the pot needs a bit longer.”
Juno blinks slowly, and Harry can feel Draco’s laughter against his shoulder.
, and seems to be picking up speed. Most importantly, George seems to be thrilled.
Luck seems to be on Luna’s side when she arrives at work the following morning. It isn’t quite as much on Deb’s, who is stuck at home with food poisoning from what Sam calls ‘dodgy prawns’, and neither is it on Draco’s, as he is asked to take over most of her duties for the day.
“Are you sure?” Draco asks, voice muffled by his towel.
“You’d be sorry if I liked eating spiders, wouldn’t you?” Draco mutters.
“Draco, I need to apologise. Again. The thing is, I told you I didn’t want to be with anyone, and when I said it, I really meant it. At least… I thought I did… and now… it’s
Draco’s fingers wrap more tightly around the wheel and he directs a cold look at the road that Harry suspects is really for him. “I’m a very busy man, Potter.”
Harry sighs, sitting back in his chair as Jean pours the tea. He accepts his cup and the three of them drink in silence. It’s a very good cup of tea, strong and fragrant and served at just the right temperature. It deserves Harry’s attention and he is happy to give it, already tired of crime and the constant rehashing of yesterday’s conversation with Draco. He has already played out dozens of ways he could have handled the situation better, and he is left with nothing but self-loathing.
The arrangement seems to suit everyone, allowing Ron to work full office hours in the Auror department and Hermione to take Fridays off from the Ministry’s Legal office for paperwork and countless other activities only she understands, while Harry picks up Rose and takes her back to his job with him. Of course, there are some who would say that a whisky shop is not a suitable place for a child to spend her afternoons… some who do say so, in fact, but Rose has spent half her life so far living out this odd state of affairs and as far as she is concerned, Borteg’s is her second home.
“Yes,” Hermione says, smirking. “When was this, Harry?”
Harry flushes and presses closer, feeling an altogether more pleasant heat creeping over his body. He knew that. Of course he did. Because he’s reasonable and he doesn’t panic about horrible things happening to the man he loves more than anything.
And the third says reproachfully:
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. “If I was interested in someone, I think I’d probably want them to know. Especially if they might be interested in me, too.”
Harry doesn’t reply. He knows exactly how difficult it can be, and he can’t imagine that Draco’s attempt will be made easier by the presence of an audience. That’s not to say that he isn’t enjoying himself enormously. Without a word, he follows Draco and the box over to the fountain, catching the change in the energy of the crowd as they seem to realise that something is about to happen. He watches with interest as Draco attempts first to corner the swan with the box, then to trick it inside with a couple of swift movements that send his long coat and scarf flying.
When the door closes behind him, Harry almost smiles.
“I thought it had stopped. God, that was stupid. Is Mr Borteg okay? Is your mother?”
“She has ways of making people talk,” Hermione says darkly.
“Rose, learning the capitals of the world is a lot like making whisky,” Draco intones, so close that Harry can feel his warm breath on his skin.
“I’ve no use for a thing like that,” she laughs, and his heart sinks. “A wee bit of this, though, wouldn’t go amiss,” she adds, leaning over again and enclosing Harry’s bicep in an alarmingly strong hand.
The drive is a long one, and by the time Draco parks up the bus, every muscle in Harry’s body has turned stiff and even the most comfortable chair in the world has been unable to prevent his backside going completely numb. When he stands, the blood races back into his extremities, making him swear and hop from foot to foot.
“Such a clever man,” Mr Borteg sighs, looming in the distillery doorway in his usual black garb.
“Where the bloody hell did that come from?” Harry demands, trying to peer into the darkness without success.
Harry laughs and uncovers his eyes, reaching out to thread his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“If you like him and he’s kind to old ladies, there must be something decent there,” she says.
“Sorry, carrots,” he sighs, and the young man behind the stall eyes him curiously.
Having realised that what he likes most of all is to try new things, Draco has been visiting a different street vendor every day, bringing Harry everything from ostrich burgers to Mr Wong’s ‘danger noodles’. Now that he’s aware that someone from the Prophet is watching, he can almost sense their camera lenses trained on his back, but he doesn’t care. Being referred to as an ‘early morning humorist’, though, that still rankles.
“He needs a cup of tea,” Corrie says firmly, reaching for the pot.
Harry takes a deep breath. “I need to find a way to persuade Draco to take some time away from the bus. He needs another driver, but I’m not sure how I can help with that beyond offering to pay for one, and I know he won’t take my money. The thing is, he’s very attached to these ladies and the bus is the only place they’re not alone. If I could find somewhere else they could meet… maybe a day or two a week… I could…” Harry trails off when Molly turns around and stares at him, hard.
In the Entrance Hall, he trundles slowly, looking around at the pretty lights and clicking greetings to each suit of armour and statue in turn. A picture of an old lady gasps to see him, and he flaps his wings at her, trying to decide the best way to make friends. Before he makes up his mind, someone is lifting him off his feet and holding him to their chest. There are green stripes at close range and Stanley touches each one with a curious antenna.
Harry smiles, realising that, just like always, Hermione is right. He has a whole list of things he can do today, and none of them involve sitting with Draco in a dark room. Which is good. Definitely. It’s good, because his life is balanced and it’s calm and he likes it. He opens his eyes.
The icy air whips into the exposed top deck, sweeping over his heated skin, and it’s glorious.
Harry’s heart tightens. “Er… you?” he attempts.
“What about your shop?” Draco asks, and George grimaces.
“She’ll hear you.”
“I feel as though I’ve stumbled into a very strange dream,” Draco says, frowning. He takes out the key and taps it against the edge of the table. “This seems real enough, though.”
want that kebab now.”
“Uncle Harry,” she says, clambering into his lap and showering his jumper with glitter from her sparkly t-shirt. “Are you definitely coming to my Christmas play?”
Luna smiles. “I know,” she says softly.
“You’re on plates,” Harry says, lunging to grab Kingsley before he reaches the lamb. “Shall we put him back in the other room for now?”
George surrenders his wand with some ceremony, and then, against the backdrop of cheers, encouragement, and the occasional insult, he kneels on the stone flags and begins to erect his tent. He clearly hasn’t been practising, because within seconds he has managed to tangle the ridiculous sleeves of the Weasley jumper in the assorted tent poles, and when he finally manages to get the tent to stand up, it immediately collapses and he has to start again.
William smiles and shakes his head. “My goats cannae stand being cooped up. It’ll take more time than I’ve got to clear up the mess they’ll make. If youse are interested, though, I’ve got fresh butter, cheese, milk, eggs... and I’ll slip youse a few bottles of Gertie’s brew as well.”
“I don’t know,” he mumbles, looking up just in time to see Gertie shaking her head.
“Shut up,” Harry says cheerfully through a mouthful of cake. “Bad swan.”
“Thank you,” Hermione says quietly. “I can’t lift her any more. She’s just too big.”
“Why don’t we try expanding the doorway?” asks the smiley one who came to them one day and never really left. He makes everyone happy, including Stanley, who has been allowed to ride with him on a broomstick even though it’s a secret.
“That’s it. You’re all uninvited. No wedding cake for you.”
“Is it always that difficult to get them in for milking?”
The others mumble in agreement and Harry lets them get on with it. He doesn’t know the average weight of a mute swan any more than he knows why he is suddenly missing Draco’s presence so fiercely. He can’t imagine he’d be able to help them win the blasted quiz, but his snippy remarks and surprisingly warm eyes would definitely make Harry feel better about losing as badly as they’re about to.
Before Harry can respond, he has drawn his wand and targeted the out-of-control bracken, snaring it in a web of white light and then obliterating it with a flick of his wrist.
“Okay,” he says, wrapping his hands around his second cup of tea. “It all started when George had his stag night.”
Harry’s stomach tips unpleasantly. “I don’t want to know.”
Harry shrugs. “Only a little bit.”
“Twenty. Yes. But that’s fine, some people are just made for each other.”
“Am I losing my marbles here or are they giving us a holiday?” he asks.
“You have to come. Rose has already made your place setting.”
If Draco forgives him, which he thinks he might, he still needs a night driver and he also needs a way to take a couple of days a week to himself without disturbing the activities of the biddy club. Those ladies need each other, and they seem to thrive on daily meetings where they can chat and craft and consume vast quantities of tea and cake.
“I’m so pleased for you. Both of you,” Harry says, and then frowns. “Where is Esmee, anyway?”
Bill exchanges a significant glance with his father and then bows so low that the hat falls off his head.
**~*~**
“What are you doing?” he asks.
. And all of this is completely normal.”
,” Molly says proudly, gesturing to the chickens.
Draco regards him through the gaps in his fingers. “Would you want to?”
“Is your name Mr Abernathy?” she laughs, turning to see him peering at her over the fence.
Luna turns her most peaceful smile on the room. “He’s going to dance.”
“We should display your work,” he says, smiling when he sees that Harry is already piecing the sheets together with a spell.
Mr Barleycorn, he decides, will not be getting a Christmas card this year.
, Harry thinks, every muscle in his body stretched tight with the effort of keeping himself in place.
“We got held back in the classroom—our Spell Damage tutor decided we needed a lecture on proper timekeeping,” Harry says, finding a spare seat next to Mary Ann. “She didn’t seem to see the irony.”
“Okay!” Louis says, standing and weaving his way through the chaos until he reaches the kitchen cupboards. “Le placard… oh.”
,” he murmurs, filling the place with bright light and finding himself staring straight at Florean, who has chosen the same moment to cast.
“There you are,” the girl says happily. “Do you want to go home?”
“So, his last act as one of us was… to annoy us?” Sophie asks, scowling.
Harry stares at the cobbles as he walks and attempts to step more evenly. In truth, despite Draco’s best efforts, he is still feeling lightheaded and his legs seem to be trying to escape from underneath him.
Draco regards him steadily, one eyebrow arched, as he steps out of his improvised tweed trousers, kicks away his boxers and peels off his heavy jumper, revealing heat-flushed skin and sharp, graceful angles that make Harry’s stomach tighten. He lifts a hand, betraying uncertainty for the briefest of moments, raking fingers through his hair and displaying the carve of faded dark lines on his inner forearm. The colours of the sunset bleed onto his skin and hair, and all at once Harry can’t stand to look at him. It’s just too much, and he ducks his head beneath the surface of the water, coming up shivering and spluttering on a mouthful of loch that tastes like plants and fish and the earth.
Following his gaze, Draco sighs. “Florean was right.”
“Harry seems to have slipped into a trance,” someone says, and then: “Ronnie, did you slip him a dodgy memory charm again?”
“No,” Corrie says. “It’s not. But I’m a rebel and I want to see Harry in his hat. Ah, I want to see all of you in your hats!”
“He’s sulking,” Corrie laughs.
He glances at Draco, relieved to see that he is still scribbling and muttering to himself, and then turns back to Stanley, not quite in time to prevent him from scrambling onto his lap and covering his favourite old jeans with little green footprints.
“Not a problem. See you later?”
Draco snarls at the engine and blasts it with a spell that makes Harry taste metal in the back of his mouth.
The crow tilts his head on one side and regards her with beady black eyes before releasing something metallic and shiny from his beak.
“Multipurpose Dehydration Powder,” George says, holding up the jar. “Only at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes—on the shelves from Monday!”
“Maybe I will,” he says at last, and for several minutes, there is silence between them.
Catching it easily, Harry sucks the minty sweet and wonders exactly what he’s going to have to do to squeeze some answers out of Draco. Attempting to outmanoeuvre a Slytherin when it comes to secrets is probably an exercise in futility, and he certainly can’t force Draco to tell him anything. Perhaps persistence is key. He’s had some very interesting results with it in the past, and there’s every chance that he will irritate the ever-loving fuck out of Draco in the process.
,” Draco mumbles. “Most heard phrase today, closely followed by ‘
“He mustn’t eat my flowers, Draco,” Mr Jennings says, hurrying out of his shop with Sophie in tow.
Draco closes the doors and turns to him, hair ruffled and eyes warm. “Choose wisely, then.”
Caroline nods and chews on her lip.
Harry studies the offering for a moment and then grins at his friend. “You’re getting married? Congratulations!”
Before Narcissa can reply, he takes off in the direction of the delicious cooking smells, skidding into the kitchen and stopping dead. In the midst of a hive of pre-lunch activity, Draco is sitting on a section of countertop, chewing slowly on a perfect triangle of cheese toastie and scrutinising a receipt so long that it spills onto the floor in chaotic ripples. In his rolled-up sleeves and unbuttoned collar, Draco looks casual and so perfectly careless that Harry is lost. Pinned to the spot by confusion and desire, all he can do is stare, everything inside him sent into crashing intensity by nothing more than a frown of concentration, a strand of pale hair out of place and a dusting of crumbs on neat black fabric.
“My friend Dennis has a boyfriend,” puts in Eliza.
Potter flushes and he glares at Draco. “No. I’m really not.”
The man brandishes a pair of tongs. “Romantic breakfast?”
“Harry? Did you get all that down?” Florean asks.
In the chaos that follows, Harry stays perfectly still. Cool fingers wrap around his wrist and he breathes, finding a calm in the storm and hanging onto it.
, he reads, relishing Sophie’s neat printing.
He nudges Draco, and together they watch Eilish, Corrie, Danica, and Ida making their way back to the bus, loaded down with bags and followed at a careful distance by a snow-covered Juno with a sweet wrapper in her mouth.
“Bless them,” Eilish says, and the others murmur their agreement.
He pulls away, scowling, and reaches into his pocket, pulling out the Galleon, which is now vibrating rather urgently.
When the warm-up is complete, Luna changes the record for something fast-paced with loud, sunshiny horns and a Spanish guitar. She spends the first couple of songs encouraging the kids to match the tempo of the music, moving any way they like to shake out their tension and worries, and she tries to do the same, imagining that all of her friends’ loneliness and anxiety is flowing out of her, right out to her fingertips and away. With the afternoon sunlight warm on her skin, she leads the class in a round of loud applause and then starts to call out suggestions to inspire their movement.
“That’s because he’s at Cherish, being fed crackleballs by Shan and Esmee,” Draco says.
“He’s a swan, they probably eat all sorts of plants in the wild,” Sophie points out. “I’d better get back. Don’t forget to drink your tea, Mr J.”
“Didn’t there used to be a conductor?” someone asks, but Harry isn’t really listening.
“Yes, but we’d better wait until everyone gets here,” Draco says, and then he glances at Harry. “I don’t know about you, but I’d rather not go through this more than once.”
“They’ll be in the antique shops,” Draco says, unconcerned. “And the charity shops, and the pet shop. Essentially, they will be buying things they don’t need.”
can take him back.”
“I don’t think Draco is a casual sort of bloke,” Ron says thoughtfully. “He’s… you know… intense and a bit weird, but I think if you check the label on that coat of his, it’ll say… ‘commitment’.”
“You and Pansy talked about it just this morning. The Prophet reported that I was attempting to sleep rough in the park. Pansy suggested I was sunbathing at night. She was correct.”
Harry smiles, deciding that his urge to hug her will only end in pastry dough everywhere.
Harry sighs at the thought of it, body aching with missing him. It’s been two days, that’s all, and it will only be two more, but he fucking hates it and he doesn’t think he’s slept more than a couple of hours since Draco left. He’s exhausted and on edge and he really doesn’t see why Gringotts should be allowed to yank his person to the other side of the world for ninety-six hours and leave him here in a house that suddenly seems far too big. It had been fine before; he’d rattled around quite happily for years, but now the silence feels oppressive and when he stretches out a hand across the mattress he finds nothing but the pyjamas he abandoned hours ago in a screwed up ball.
“We could go and look,” he suggests, and they both get to their feet.
“So…?” Harry prompts, watching Needle, who is now flouncing around with the paper cup in his mouth.
Harry stirs awake to the sound of cackling magpies and smiles lazily into his pillow.
“Definitely,” he promises. “How’s the giraffe research going?”
angry, and this morning, I’m going to finish my coffee and then we’re going to go and look in your toy box for something brightly coloured and noisy.”
“Yeah, a whole hour,” he sighs.
As a result, she regularly stomps up and down the alley gleaning change for her till and will probably continue to do so until she is a very old lady indeed. Harry knows she is at least eighty already; she had invited all the shopkeepers to her birthday party at the Leaky, which had been so raucous that poor Tom had had to close early for a whole week afterwards. Shan is a noisy woman without the excuse of a special occasion, strident East-end accent completely at odds with the image of the delicate Chinese octogenarian currently flicking Knuts and Sickles into her little money bag. Next to her partner of some fifty years, Esmee, she seems impossibly short, even with the high-heeled boots that she wears, unsteadily, everywhere she goes.
Harry smiles at her. “I think I’m getting there.”
“If it’ll help,” she says, just as the door swings open and a small queue forms behind Harry. “Good luck with it, love.”
“It wasn’t dramatic,” Harry protests. “Well, it was a bit, but it wasn’t my fault.”
“But...”
“Well, you asked, Malfoy!” Potter points out.
Draco laughs, fingers curling around the battered old spanner and holding tight. “Do you see these letters?” he asks, relaxing his grip.
Now, how do you plan on putting a stop to the speculation about your love life?
Harry smiles. “I don’t think I’m going to grow now, unfortunately. I think this is it.”
“We should take him out for a bit,” Harry says, and Draco unsticks his face from his pillow to gaze at him.
“I think this is very elegant,” the woman insists, admiring the traditional Victorian baubles Harry has chosen and reaching out to spin one on its thread. The sunlight filters through the glass and onto the walls and she smiles. “I’ll have one. You choose.”
The distillery is cool and dark, heavy with the scents of wood and copper and humming with protective magic. In one corner, in the shadow of countless large barrels, is Mr Borteg’s little sanctuary. An old leather chair crouches beside an ebony desk, on which glasses and instruments jostle for space with piles of books. Next to his coffee cup, a single crackleball sits, waiting for its moment.
“It’s completely bizarre,” Draco says, shaking his head. “I love it.”
“Get your eclipse postcards!” someone shouts. “Five for five Sickles!”
“You might think that…” Harry begins, now relishing the chance to wind Draco up.
“George is having a stall,” Ginny says, grinning. “We’re going to be selling glasses with protective charms, cameras, all sorts of stuff. He’s even made eclipse-themed t-shirts. Some of them are really rude.”
“My mother gave me the Black inheritance early,” Draco continues, reaching out and combing snow from Juno’s fur with his fingers. “I used it to buy the bus, and here we are. It’s ironic, really… Mother had her community service taking care of old people. Now she’s living on a commune in Belgium with people half her age, and I’m here, driving the biddy club around the British bloody Isles.”
Harry laughs. “I’ll try that again, Ida—how are you feeling?”
“Look, Mrs Purley’s put a sign in her window,” Harry says, licking a drip of cherry ice cream just before it drips onto his coat. The combination of flavours is exactly what he didn’t know he wanted, and of course it is, because Florean is a bloody genius.
“I don’t remember agreeing to turns. Besides, I’ve got customers to serve. You told me less than ten minutes ago that you have absolutely nothing to do.
“She might,” Draco says. He shivers and tucks his hands into the ends of his sleeves. “It’s technically true, anyway.”
“She doesn’t mean that,” Ron says, planting a loud kiss on her cheek. “Besides, I don’t see you staying single for much longer, do you?”
“I don’t remember that one,” Ron says, puzzled, and then: “You mean you really did see him?”
Rose regards her single sprout with deep suspicion. “Uncle Harry, that’s not better.”
“I’ve seen weirder things,” Ron says, shrugging. “I’ve seen you doing weirder things. Remember that time you, me, Hermione and that Ferdinand bloke went to—”
The heavy thing purrs loudly, leaning close enough to brush Harry’s nose with curious whiskers. He ignores it, shuffling closer to Draco and winding a possessive arm around his waist. This is a nice place. It’s a warm place, a soft place, and a place where Draco’s naked body is tangled comfortably with his, pale hair ruffled against his shoulder and fingers splayed over his belly, fractions of an inch from the ache of his morning hardness.
“We all made snowflakes,” offers an older girl who is shivering, even with layers of blankets pulled up to her chin and a warming charm looped around her bed. “We folded paper and cut patterns out of them, and then Nurse Kate hung them up and charmed them to spin around.”
“You’ll have heard of Mrs Skower’s Magical Mess Remover?” Ida says.
“I think I’d like to speak to your manager,” Draco says, and though he intends his tone to be light, Potter’s expression darkens.
“Thank you,” Luna says. “You can join us if you like. All the teachers can.”
“Did she tell you to tell me that part?” Harry asks, unable to decide if he’s amused or exasperated.
“That smells brilliant,” he sighs, moaning softly when Draco presses a slippery palm to his cock and begins to stroke him open.
“Thank you. And no, they’re Bowtruckles. They were my mother’s. She gave them to me when I was a little girl because she thought they were lucky,” Luna says, touching the wooden earrings with her fingertips and remembering how she had loved to sort through her mother’s jewellery box, admiring the strange, colourful things and holding them up to her ears and neck in the mirror.
“You don’t feel exposed?” Harry asks, stepping closer and facing him across the counter.
“You might want to control your swan,” Harry whispers when she runs into the back. “This place is like an all-you-can-eat buffet for him.”
“You look a damn sight better than you did when we found you,” Corrie says sternly. “What potions’ve they got you on?”
“Obviously. Do you mind if we have a quick word with Florean?”
“And her father. Mind how you go!” he adds, attracting himself a glare as she stalks out of the shop.
“You want him to make sense,” Harry sighs. “People don’t make sense when they’re angry. I suppose from his perspective, we told him to shove his business and used all our time and money to organise something for sick children instead.”
He’s a mess. He’s exhausted, covered in cracker crumbs and his hands shake when he reaches for his tea. And yet, when he thinks about the stupid lying bastard, his heart still aches and his stomach still fills with heat.
“I’m not sure about brilliant, but we got the job done,” he says to his living room, and then frowns at his reflection in the mirror.
“Okay,” Rose says. “But I’ll do another picture of Needle that will be just yours.”
Draco hesitates, taking out his wand and drying Harry’s feet and robes and then his own.
“This is… well, it’s certainly not what I expected,” Florean says, clever eyes bright with sadness.
“Lunch,” he says instead, and Potter stares at him.
“I have a pretty good idea,” Draco mumbles, and then he is stepping out gracefully from behind Harry, exasperation hidden behind a polite smile and a deferent nod. “Good morning, Nurse. We’ve just come to collect Ida Skower.”
“Shut up,” he mutters, and then decides not to say anything else because Draco is kicking away the sheets and pulling him onto his side, curling behind him with warm lips against the back of his neck and one hand resting on his belly with enough intent to make him ache.
“That should do it,” Draco says, brushing pine needles from his shirt and producing two steaming paper cups, apparently from nowhere.
Finally, Potter stops, pulling up outside Gringotts and corralling the crocodile, which tugs at its harness and swipes its long tail slowly. When he turns, he doesn’t seem all that surprised to see Draco.
Harry and Rose keep walking until they reach the festival area, where they stop to admire the extra decorations and take in the flurry of activity around the edges of the ice rink. Sophie is balancing on the rim of the fountain and floating white paper lanterns into the air with her wand, while at her feet, Mr Pike is crouching over a box of something that flutters and jingles softly. The German sausage man is working briskly, slicing and portioning his meats in preparation for hungry wedding guests, and Florean, who has inexplicably slipped past them, is working on a warming charm that looks as though it will loop around the entire middle section of the street.
“Tack,” he offers, smearing soot and sparkly powder over a pristine shirt with his feet.
As predicted, Molly and Narcissa have much to talk about, and are quickly lost in a conversation that veers from raising children to knitting projects with detours around the best place to buy good quality butter and the state of popular music. Ron eats his starter without taking his eyes off his mother, and Arthur seems equally entranced by his wife’s easy sociability.
“Are you closing Sage?” Sophie asks, horrified.
He doesn’t think it’s working, and it doesn’t help that he can’t stop darting glances at Draco any more than Draco can stop looking over at him. Harry has no idea how much time has passed since they last spoke, but his hands are sweat-slippery and his nerves are jangling, and god, it feels like
He bats her away with a book about good accounting practices and both Harry and Draco dissolve into helpless laughter again.
“Ridiculous,” Draco mutters, scowling, and Harry has the strangest urge to lean over and pat him on the shoulder.
“And what time do you call this?” he asks, scrutinising his list of records for a suitable Song for the Shower—or perhaps an unsuitable one.
“Around the back of the…?” Harry attempts, and Draco fixes him with an exasperated stare, even though he would actually rather like an ice cream right now.
Draco looks up from his cup of tea. His face drains of all colour when he sees the owl.
He immediately sinks up to the tops of his boots in the snow and is still swearing, loudly and creatively, when the bus screeches up beside him and Draco leans out.
“Do you think we should go and help?” Danica says, getting up with wand in hand.
“First door on the left,” Hermione says. She waits until Marius has disappeared into the house and then turns to Harry expectantly. “Well, what do you think?”
“Okay,” Harry says, knowing he should stay and brazen it out but wanting nothing more than to run away before he explodes from the intensity of her attention.
When they find themselves back at the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes stall, Luna is thrilled to find that all of the buckets they left there have been filled almost to the top. There are mostly Knuts, as people have wanted to get rid of their loose change, but she can see plenty of silver Sickles, too, plus a surprising amount of gleaming gold Galleons.
Draco sighs. “Potter, what are you doing?”
“Of course,” Harry says, taking them back and heading into the kitchen, which is, as always, pin-neat and welcoming. Shan and Esmee’s flat is beautiful, full of vibrant colours and countless mementos of their lives together. It also smells tantalisingly of cooking, reminding Harry that he has forgotten to have lunch. “Here you are,” he says, emerging with the sunflowers in a crackle-glazed vase and placing them on the coffee table. “I’m sorry you feel like an old lady, but at least you don’t look like one.”
“Trust him to be able to look like that in a pair of bloody pyjamas,” Deb mutters to Luna as she climbs into the bus and finds her seat.
be down here in five minutes flat. But it’s not. It’s us. We’re attacking ourselves. It’s us against our own, and we…
Draco leans over to rifle in a bedside cabinet and Harry gazes at him, sprawling on the impossibly soft quilt and mentally tracing the graceful line of his back, so much in love that he can’t keep the smile from his face. When Draco pours oil over his fingers and bites his lip as he slicks himself open, Harry is lost. Barely breathing, he pushes inside, grasping at the bedclothes for control when Draco immediately pulls him deep.
“Where did youse get those tweedy trousers?” he demands, wiping his eyes with the back of one hand and gazing delightedly at them in the rear view mirror.
Hugo seems unconcerned by this move and sets about tangling his fingers in Mr Borteg’s loose hair.
“He’s a funny boy,” Eilish says with a fond smile.
“It will be before this has finished,” Draco says. “Do you want something to eat?”
Harry looks at him askance. “Never?”
Harry turns, startled to see Draco standing behind him and to realise that the bus is now stationary, parked up beside a frosty, sun-dappled forest.
“I’m prepared to keep my mind open,” Hermione says, digging into her food. “As long as he behaves himself.”
Harry says nothing for a moment, feeling caught. “No,” he admits finally. “But you said you didn’t want to talk about it, and I was trying out ‘being respectful’.”
“Why no charm today, then?” Harry asks, opting to ignore the question. He suspects that Draco hadn’t really wanted an answer anyway.
“Making ice cream with Florean,” Harry says, gently booting Needle out from under his feet.
William laughs. “She likes to look after waifs and strays,” he says. “Her children and grandchildren are all grown up now, ye see. It’s been a wee while since she had a project.”
“I wouldn’t dare,” Draco mutters, and he urges them on ahead so that he and Harry can lift Ida between them.
Shan’s face twists anxiously. “It’s hard to be original when you’ve been with someone for so long.”
“Pair of bloody Sassenachs,” she mumbles. “Youse can no take your beer.”
“I hope so,” Harry says, restoring his map the moment the door closes again.
Second one of those in a week, too, he thinks, and he pushes the newspaper away crossly.
Harry looks at her friendly, wrinkled face and wishes he could tell her something good. Feeling heavy, and quite a bit off-balance, he smiles and lies. “Not yet, Jean. Sorry.”
“Thank you,” Draco says, accepting it and seeming to steel himself. “Just one more thing… we spoke to Reuben this morning and he told us that the two of you were no longer together.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asks.
Draco puts his hands in his coat pockets as a savage gust of wind rips through the street.
Harry sits up, eyebrows knitted. “People don’t really say things like that, do they?”
“Fair enough. You know, I bet this thing would be really comfortable to sleep on.”
“Off you go, then,” he whispers, pulse speeding in anticipation. “You know what to do.”
Old enemies’ secret lunch-dates, he reads. Is early-morning humorist Draco Malfoy behind Potter’s break with reality?
“Would you like to… discuss it?” Mr Borteg asks, pale blue eyes growing large.
, deciding not to dwell on the cross little exhalations that issue from the driver’s seat whenever he mentions the Northern Lights.
, he writes, scratching each letter into the page in his fury.
“I’ll just have to find out why he’s so strange,” Luna mutters to herself.
Shan looks bewildered. “I don’t think I’ll be any help with this. Better get back.”
“Look at all these,” Mr Jennings says, waving back when Rose waves to him. “Only the first of December and lights everywhere.”
“We all do,” Harry sighs. “People just don’t… they just don’t.”
With spells of helping customers interspersed with distillery detective time, the afternoon passes quickly, and when Harry goes behind the counter to retrieve more parchment, he is startled to realise that all the shops around Borteg’s have closed.
“He thinks he’s a dinosaur,” Emilie laughs, and under the tree, the older students laugh, too.
“This is my mother’s favourite drink. We don’t have a celebration in our house without it. Perhaps you and your wife-to-be can celebrate with it, too,” she says, flushing gently and hurrying to present Mr Borteg with her money bag.
“Have you got any proof that it happened the way you say it did?” Harry demands.
“In the lake?” Harry asks. He can’t help it.
Harry doesn’t know what to say about any of that, least of all about Draco being listed along with his previous boyfriends, so he just hugs Rose and tells her to choose anything she wants.
“Got something for me to take up there, have you?” Harry asks, amused.
“Good. I mean, that’s good, but have you noticed that they’ve all disappeared?” he says, indicating the empty beach with a sweep of his arm.
“Don’t be daft, Harry, you’re part of the family,” Sam says, and Luna wants to leap out of her chair and hug him, but she stays where she is.
“I remember that,” Harry laughs, and then points with his pen. “Mr Jennings is in one of those ‘keep power at the grass roots’ groups, so…”
Harry grins. “I think they might. They think I’m a lovely young man.”
“With
“I’m an idiot,” Harry mumbles.
Harry smiles to himself, both at Draco’s indignation and the way the biddies are beginning to strike out on their own, visiting each other’s houses and taking their friendship out into the world beyond the bus.
“What are... you know what, never mind,” Draco says.
“I think I’m going tell Angelina when I next see her,” Fred says serenely. “‘Angie,’ I’ll say, ‘you’re more like a bowl of biting pea soup every day’.”
For a tense moment, everyone watching seems to hold their breath, but then Angelina laughs, George grins at her, and it’s clear that everything is going to be okay.
Draco lets out a small snort of laughter, which she finds rather heartening. The lightness is in there somewhere, and all she has to do is find a way to grab hold of it.
“I suppose you don’t think they’d make a nice couple?” she says innocently, and Draco’s lip curls for a fraction of a second.
“Can I help him?” Percy asks, taking a step towards the tangle of tent and George.
Harry grins. “Maybe you should tell Draco you’d like some decorations.”
“Did you clear your mind?”
and they
“Did it work?” Harry asks.
“I assume so,” Draco says. “Needle definitely tried to eat her bracelet.”
“Yeah, well, don’t get comfortable, I’m starving. Let’s go back to the shop and firecall Hermione and then get some lunch,” Harry says.
Corrie adds.
Harry looks at the money box thoughtfully. Of course, what he had really wanted to buy Rose was a ruler with spiders on it, but he has been reliably informed that she will be getting one in her Christmas stocking, shatter-proof and foldable, courtesy of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. The money box gleams in the lamplight, gold highlights glittering with brand new perfection.
“A fisherman would no come out without his coat,” she says, staring down at Draco as though daring him to argue.
“Bing Crosby is spinning in his grave,” Hermione mutters when the song comes to an end.
“That’s the secret ingredient,” Draco murmurs. “Shh.”
Harry says nothing. He’s pretty certain that they look ridiculous on every last one of them, but George had been insistent – there could be no stag party without stags, and as such, Fred had been dispatched to every fancy dress shop in the greater London area and forbidden to return until he had obtained a pair of antlers for everyone invited. Plus Ginny.
“Anybody ever told you you’re a lot stronger than you look?” he manages after a moment.
Harry takes a deep breath. “I was, sir, but what you’re asking for simply doesn’t exist.”
Before she has finished speaking, Juno is hopping down the steps and onto the gravel with a crunch, fluffy tail held high as she sniffs the new air. Montague stands patiently at Ida’s side, soulful eyes full of promises to be good.
Harry laughs. “Magic.”
Draco’s astonishment is obvious and Luna decides to retreat back into the dining room on the grounds of retrieving some imaginary item, hoping to give them a moment. In the interests of gathering evidence for her project, she decides to press herself against the door and listen as hard as she can, but Harry and Draco seem to have forgotten how to use their words.
“I might be completely losing my marbles here, Harry, but aren’t we supposed to wait for the bride for this part?” Draco whispers, leaning close enough to make Harry’s skin heat.
The last Christmas crackleball, Harry notes, and though there is no way he can stomach a Cherish confection right now, he is touched by the gesture.
“Nine-ish?” Harry says uncertainly, looking at the clock. “We’ve got about an hour.”
“Don’t be, it looks better this way,” Harry says. “Sorry, Esmee, I just have to ask Draco something.”
As the crocodile of children starts to move with Deb at the front and Sam at the rear, Luna rattles her buckets and walks alongside them, helping Harry and his boxer shorts and Draco and his fancy pyjamas keep everyone tightly together.
“Between those two?”
George regards him with mild confusion and then shrugs. “You can have it. There’s loads more in the guidebook.”
The delight on their faces as they bounce up and down and hug each other lifts her like a Cheering Charm and she can’t help but laugh when Caroline’s excitement sets off yet another burst of accidental magic, this time causing all the chairs in the room to spin around in circles. Unsurprisingly, when given the option, the children vote to spend the extra money on a healthy percussion section, and, as Luna leaves the room, are gathered around owl-order catalogues, chattering and drawing circles around pictures of drums and tambourines and maracas.
“I set an alarm off,” Ron says, sounding quite proud of himself.
“Needle,” he murmurs, clearing a path for the swan, “If you do this right, there are some very tasty grasses in your future.”
“Luna,” Draco sighs. “We’re friends, aren’t we?”
Both women laugh uproariously and Harry flushes. There is something about him, he has learned, that is irresistible to women who are old enough to be his mother. As there doesn’t seem to be anything he can do about it, he doesn’t see any harm in using it to his advantage.
“It’s fine,” Marius says, attempting a smile. “This was obviously a misunderstanding.”
“Really?” Draco asks, eyebrows creeping under his dishevelled fringe.
“Well, to be fair, he’s a very large fish,” Harry says, hiding a smile as he picks his way across the stones to retrieve his clothes. “He’s probably not used to having visitors.”
Draco huffs and kicks at a stone. “Let’s be grateful that we have developed better traditions.”
Draco smiles serenely. “I’m browsing.”
“I’m fine, thanks, Louis,” Ron says, sketching a thumbs-up just in case.
“I am a victim in this,” Mr Jennings insists. “My shop was trashed, my till was ransacked. Have you forgotten that already?”
The chair he is sitting on is old and rickety, made of dark wood with a striped cushion on the seat. None of the chairs around the table seem to match, and the table itself is covered, he now notices, in a vast white lacy cloth. Around him, the walls are painted a soft shade of violet, and between the notices warning passengers to ‘remain seated’ and ‘don’t touch this button’ are strange little pieces of art: small tapestries, sketches, and a collection of watercolours of the same cat—a vast, grey and white specimen with extraordinarily long whiskers. The whole place looks as though it was designed for old ladies and by old ladies, and he has no idea how he never noticed it before.
“Dare I ask where she is?”
Harry glances at Rose, who is eating steadily and paying no attention to her parents’ disagreement. With a clear conscience, he drinks his tea and enjoys the show. Ron and Hermione rarely have proper fights—the kind where insults and or bits of crockery might be thrown—but they can bicker for England. Harry hasn’t got anyone to bicker with, and he’s pretty sure he’s fine with that, but from time to time he does enjoy a pointless argument in a nice warm kitchen, especially when he can watch from a safe distance.
By the time they are halfway up the drive, he can see McGonagall on the front steps, and when they reach her, Harry doesn’t know whether to turn and run or give her a hug. In the end, he holds fast to Draco’s hand and says:
“She’d better not decide to finally fall asleep in the middle of this play,” Harry mutters. “I’ll never hear the end of it from Rose.”
“This stays off for the rest of the day,” he says, and even the small smile on his face does not stop the children from nodding solemnly.
Harry doesn’t really blame him. He doesn’t know what Draco has done to the swan but however well behaved he might be these days, he still has the capacity to look pretty fucking terrifying.
Rose pulls herself up to her full height and adjusts her glittery reindeer antlers. They look rather better on her than they had on her dad, Harry decides, but keeps the thought to himself.
She grips her cup with both hands and stares right into him with pale blue eyes. “Draco was raised a certain way. He was taught to hide himself, to hide pain, at any cost. That was the Malfoy way,” she says, pressing her lips together as though to prevent herself from saying what she really wants to. “I cannot change it now, but I will do whatever I need to in order to help him find happiness. Do you understand?”
“But you promised we could read Babbitty Rabbitty,” beseeches a small girl with enormous dark eyes.
“I’ll get him,” says the boy, leaning down and cradling Stanley against his chest. “I’ve already got custard all down my jumper, a bit of soot won’t matter.”
With no idea what to say, Harry just stares at him. When the curtain is opened and Eilish appears, it seems to him as though it must be obvious to her, all of it.
“I never said it made sense,” Corrie mumbles.
Harry takes one when offered and sucks it slowly, carrying the crate of Christmas decorations outside and setting it down in the snow. He draws his wand and tacks sprigs of holly and mistletoe along the lintels, bobbing along to the rousing brass band music that drifts up the street from the festival area. The white chocolate, soft mint and liquid caramel of the crackleball melts on his tongue as he works, sending a feeling of such warm delight out to his fingertips that he almost doesn’t mind when he picks up the lights and finds that they have twisted themselves into a tight snarl. Humming along with the music, he starts to unpick the tangled mess with cold-numbed fingers.
“Give them a minute,” Eilish chides, and Harry practically throws himself out of the bus before he has the chance to die of embarrassment.
“This isn’t just a scratch. These are initials.”
Something crackles in the air, and a low rumble makes everyone stop what they are doing. Draco looks up, dragging damp, electrified air into his lungs. The sun has disappeared, leaving the sky grey and heavy and ominous.
“Tomorrow,” Draco suggests, and Harry nods.
“Brought you the leftover comments,” Francis is saying to Pansy as Draco stalks along the corridor to the tiny shared kitchen.
“Well, is it just goats?” Harry asks. He knows he is wasting valuable time, but he is far too curious to care. “Can you do other animal noises?”
Once back on board, the musty air now heavy with the scents of grease, garlic and fried potato, everyone else has forgotten all about Draco in favour of an in-depth and determinedly embarrassing dissection of George’s love life up to this point. Harry joins in, always happy to discuss the lady with twenty-eight cats or the one who had been interested in Fred all along, but he can’t seem to stop his mind or his eyes drifting back to the man in the driver’s seat. The curiosity pulls at him, even through the haze of alcohol and laughter, and in the end, he gives in. When the bus pulls up for the final time that night, Harry tacks himself onto the back of the exiting line, watching his friends thank the driver and stumble out, none-the-wiser, into the night.
Making sure his omnivox and hers are completely switched off, he forces himself to ask.
,” Rose sings, and then giggles again. “What’s that?”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Do you know how to take care of ducks?”
Reluctantly, he lowers himself back into the water, using his foot to turn the hot tap.
Instead, he releases the button on Draco’s trousers and tugs the fabric down around his knees. With a rush of relief, he presses his face against Draco’s cock, hard and flat against his belly, so hot against Harry’s skin even when the rest of him is cool to the touch. Harry inhales, the scent of lemons and warm skin and the loch pulling a string through his body, tight and burning, and when Draco lets out a soft groan, Harry’s mouth is everywhere and Draco is cool and hot and heavy against his tongue.
“You think you’re funny, don’t you?” Draco sighs, mouth tugging into a reluctant smile as the old man grins, displaying both rows of crooked teeth.
Harry takes a deep breath, makes a cone shape around his mouth and calls out to them, attempting to mimic their vibrating cry and perhaps—one never knows—draw them to him. Once again, several goats look up but quickly lose interest. When an almost deafening bleat blasts out at close range, Harry jumps, just about ready to whirl around and face some sort of enormous monster goat, and then it rings out again and he realises that the sound is coming from Draco, who is leaning down towards the stream, copying Harry’s cupped hands and almost perfectly reproducing the uncanny, childlike cry of the creatures below.
He turns around to see that Draco’s chair is empty, and he looks out into the street just in time to see a long green scarf whipping out of sight.
“Bugger that,” Sophie says loudly, and then, “Sorry… it’s just… you’re right, Es, that’s the important thing, but don’t you want to see some justice? I know I do.”
“Yes. I need those special pellets we saw in the catalogue.”
“I’m sorry, who are you exactly?” Harry asks, instinctively stepping in front of Daraja.
The sky is still stubbornly dark when Harry stumbles out of bed with a raging thirst and an unsettled mind. In the bathroom, he drinks cold water straight from the tap and then stares at himself in the mirror. Blurred green eyes stare back, then blink slowly, and he smiles as the previous night’s conversation with Ron and Hermione floods back into his mind. They had been wonderful. Curious and cautious and concerned by turns, but wonderful, and he knows already that sharing his secret has lifted a weight from his shoulders.
Harry looks down at his saturated clothes and the puddle growing around his feet and shivers violently. Forcing his cold-numbed fingers to work, he retrieves his wand and dries himself with a fierce spell. It’s not as good as Ginny’s, but he is no longer dripping, and that will do.
“Come on, Caroline,” Mary Ann says. “Let’s go and speak to Mr Lovegood. I just know you’re the best person for the job.”
“She’s watching him, look!” She points, and Harry follows her eyes to see the vast cat sitting on the stairs with her eyes fixed intently on Montague.
Slowly, he turns the page and starts again, writing each name in a rough circle and then staring at it hard, chewing on the end of the pencil until it almost cracks. After several minutes of silence, he pulls the pencil out of his mouth and writes:
“You don’t know, and you think I do?”
He gasps, coughing up murky water until everything hurts, clinging to the strong arms of someone… his someone. Harry is dragging him back to the shore, features set hard and expression grim under the calm, ghostly light that now bathes the grounds. The rain has stopped and the air feels fresh and cool against Draco’s skin.
“No time,” he says, holding up his hands and hurrying away from her, and it’s not completely untrue.
“Tell her… tell her I think she’s beautiful as well,” says tiny Eliza, hauling herself up onto the nearby sofa with what looks like a massive effort.
“Oui,” Molly says, sketching a brief chicken dance that make Charlie snort with laughter. “Poisson.”
, but he merely sits and waits.
“That’s not very nice, Danny,” Neville reproves, adding: “Still not getting involved.”
“Be quiet
She runs behind the counter and hugs him tightly before hurrying after Florean, already telling him about her favourite flavours as the shop door swings slowly shut behind them.
“Oh, I know. Totally incestuous. But you never know, Potter might be listening.”
“Mulled cider,” Harry sighs happily, inhaling the aromatic steam. “When did you get this?”
Florean pretends to consider her, folding his arms and tapping his fingers against his coat fabric. Finally, he relents.
He stands there for a little too long, letting the raindrops soak his hair and skin and watching them bounce from the surface of his drink. Eventually coming to his senses, he protects the cups with a hasty charm and heads for Borteg’s, heavy with the suspicion that this day isn’t going to get any better. Of course, it doesn’t help that most of it is his own fault. He’s done this to himself, what with spending time with Draco, sharing the investigation with him, deciding to be his friend. They have always had a certain way with one another and he should have seen it coming. But he didn’t, and now Draco likes him and he, god help him… well, all he knows is that falling in love with Draco Malfoy was never part of the plan.
“Is it likely that she isn’t?” Harry asks.
“Most things are possible if you’re stubborn enough,” Draco says, glancing sideways at Harry. “Are you going to buy me a cup of mulled wine?”
“Harry,” she says, frowning. “Why does this say that the average weight of a mute swan is Genghis Khan?”
“As opposed to imaginary ale?” Draco asks.
“I’ll see you,” he sighs, dropping several coins into the centre and making his sleeve ride up his forearm.
Harry smiles at her, surprised and warmed. “Ida, that’s wonderful. Have you told Draco?”
When she arrives at the home, most of the children are eating lunch inside, but a small pack of boys are throwing a ball around on the front lawn and they make a beeline for Luna as soon as they see her.
The second goat is similarly intrigued by Harry’s offer of food and proceeds happily, if rather more slowly than the first, up to the barn. Buoyed with success, Harry opens the door and ushers her inside. He is just attempting a cautious pat to the goat’s warm, soft neck when Draco’s voice floats in from outside the barn.
“Thank you,” Draco says, wondering if the ringing sound in his ears is a bad sign.
He leans against the wall and watches Draco moving around his tiny kitchen. He is different, somehow, yet again—more at ease in every action than Harry has ever seen him before. He hums to himself, pushing the hair out of his eyes and tipping sliced mushrooms into the sizzling pan, reaching up for fresh herbs and allowing Harry to admire the way his dark jeans hang on his hips. He is beautiful. The harsh morning sunlight illuminates every visible rib, every slicing pink scar, every faded grey line against pale flesh, and he is beautiful.
Harry takes a long breath of cold air, weighing up the thrill in his chest, the fullness of his stomach, and the spark of an idea that wriggles inside him as he gazes at the frosted cobbles.
Pansy smiles. “I’m not writing it, darling, I’m just keeping you up to date.”
“Probably,” Draco says through gritted teeth. “But I wouldn’t be much of a beetle parent if I didn’t go and see,
“I’m sure he’s having a lovely time already,” Harry says, tugging her gently along the cobbles and up to the shop. “Biting everything in sight, no doubt.”
“Harry.”
Harry thinks this is somewhat of an understatement, but he doesn’t say so. “I think my father had his moments, too,” he says, surprising himself. “I’m still struggling with that idea that parents are people, too.”
Esmee regards him kindly. “Love is quite often that way.”
Deciding to leave Mr Borteg to his explanation, Harry steps out into the cold street. With a little bit of wheedling and a lot of gentle strokes, he persuades the owl up onto his arm and carries it back into the shop. Needle hisses in alarm and bites Draco’s fingers, though apparently not hard enough to stop him listening to Mr Borteg’s vivid description of the whisky-making process. The owl stares calmly down at Needle and then holds out its foot to Harry with massive dignity.
“Clearly, catching them isn’t the problem. It’s keeping them,” Draco says. “We could put a ward of some kind on the door. An anti-goat spell, if you will.”
Hurriedly, he picks up his knife and fork and starts into his pie, darting anxious glances at the old woman all the way. Harry hides a smile and gulps at his beer, suddenly parched as well as ravenous. Which is a good job, as it turns out, because Gertie appears set on ensuring that neither of them have an empty glass at any point. By the time he has worked his way through all of the food on his plate, Harry is full to bursting and is feeling quite pleasantly drunk. He has no idea why Gertie is being so kind to them. Perhaps she’s insane. Perhaps she has some sort of evil plan and is lulling them both into a false sense of security. Or perhaps, he thinks, perhaps she’s insane.
“Good grief,” Draco says, and then he doesn’t speak for several minutes, even when they walk into the shop and find Mr Borteg serving customers and wearing a sparkly santa hat.
“Have you thought about a Mind Healer? You know... after everything,” says a Hufflepuff girl he barely knows, and Harry places mark number seven on his mental tally chart.
“You are. Stop it.”
“Someone knew that,” Shan says darkly.
Harry turns his head on his pillow, meeting Draco’s eyes and allowing the madness of the previous day to flood back around him. It now makes perfect sense that he is in Draco’s bedroom, in Draco’s bed, and while something old and almost forgotten tries to tie him up in panic, all he feels is contentment. Yes, Draco has stolen almost all the bedclothes and one of Harry’s pillows, and yes, he has a swan that is now wide awake and briskly preening Harry’s hair for him, but he feels as though he might like to wake up just like this for the rest of his life.
He leans, and Harry leans, and their lips brush together so gently that Harry shivers all over.
“It’s not that I didn’t want people to know,” Draco says suddenly.
“Are you alright?” he whispers.
“Hi, Harry,” she calls, foghorn voice causing several of the customers to jump. “Everything alright?”
“I see, and where can I get some of what you’re having?” Deb asks, leaning over Harry and pressing the back of her hand to his forehead. “You’re hot.”
“Look up,” Draco instructs, and when he does, he laughs.
They turn to go, all smart robes and neatly-combed hair. Ron stops in the doorway.
Harry hugs Esmee, smiling when her curls brush against his face. “I’m so happy for you,” he whispers.
Hermione shrugs and tries to hide a smile.
“I wonder where Juno is,” Harry says. “He’s lucky she wasn’t here to eat him.”
To his relief, the charmed lights are accepted and the interior of the bus soon looks thoroughly festive as well as thoroughly purple. In the luggage rack, they set up a large tree that gleams with baubles and fills the bottom deck with the clean scent of pine. The exterior, too, is sparkling, with tinsel tracing every window and glittering snowflakes fixed to every wheel.
“Nikolai,” Pansy corrects, clearly trying not to smile. “He’s Russian. Alright, then. Deal.”
Draco laughs, and it hurts, and he doesn’t care. He thought his friend was lost, and instead, here he is, perching on top of an enormous cephalopod as though he doesn’t have a care in the world. Oh, he’s in so much trouble, but it doesn’t fucking matter one bit.
“You can keep saying it,” Harry offers. “I don’t mind.”
“Why?” George asks. “You all look fine already.”
Harry meets his eyes. “What isn’t?”
He leans back in the driver’s chair and studies Draco’s appearance.
Harry shoves the Knuts into his pocket and takes possession of the bouquets. Both are simple, consisting of ice white blooms with dark stems and a selection of pretty grasses, all tied with rough green twine. Their scent is fresh and light, drifting into Harry’s nostrils on a momentary breeze.
**~*~**
Rose pouts, clearly caught between the desire to be the best big sister she can be and the loss of her creative work.
“Do we have to talk about spiders while we’re eating?” Ron complains.
In an instant, the anxiety drops away from the man’s face and he take the bottle from Harry with a smile.
When Draco heads back to check on Sage, Harry helps Jean to cage up the last few loose owls and carry them over to Mrs Purley, who accepts her new charges without comment and immediately sets to cleaning their dusty feathers. Minutes later, Harry is delighted to see Shan and Esmee hurrying back into their kitchen. Soon, they are melting, tempering and decorating like demons in an attempt to refill their empty display cases, and Harry watches them with quiet pride.
“That wasn’t really what I was saying,” Harry attempts.
Harry cringes. He is not a good authority on medical matters and he hopes that whoever Draco is shouting at doesn’t decide to come and quiz him.
“It does,” Ron says, kissing her on the cheek and smiling beatifically as she gets up and heads inside to attend to Hugo. He turns to Harry, fork held aloft. “Now, tell me everything before she gets back.”
“Is that you, Harry?” Shan calls, and he finally locates her at the top of the stairs, poking her head around the door.
“I really am sorry, Draco. I didn’t know it was a secret.”
It seems ludicrous that his life can have changed so much in such a short time… and yet. Here it is. He has Draco and the bus and the biddies, and the idea of leaving them behind for—he checks the letter—
“Where did that come from?” Draco asks, caught somewhere between bewilderment and amusement.
“Have you still got beds upstairs?” Ron asks, peering into the stairwell.
Harry laughs. “There’s a thought. Anyway, Florean will never retire.”
“What the bloody hell are we going to do about this swan?” someone demands, setting off a ripple of murmuring from the crowd. Harry tunes them out.
Harry wrinkles his nose, placing the sweet, chemical scent for the first time. “I think it’s mothballs,” he says, pulling open the wardrobe and quickly stepping backwards again. “Yep.”
“Yes. You were having a nightmare.”
Harry thinks he might know the answer to that one, but he decides not to offer it. As far as he can see, what is wrong with one is wrong with the other, but apparently, it’s complicated.
Mrs Purley fixes him with a stern expression. “I’m alright, Harry. I’m open, I’m getting people their breakfasts. That’s what I do, and no thieving bastard is about to stop me.”
Harry watches him walk away, mind racing. “What if he’s still got them?”
“Right, well… perhaps I’ll just… just a misunderstanding,” he babbles, feeling around for the door handle. “I think I’ll come back when I’ve…”
“I would love some tea and cake,” he says, and Eilish beams.
“Just a blanket,” she says, holding up her needles to show off their sheer size of the blue and yellow object. “Do you like it?”
Setting down his cup, he runs up the stairs, taking each flight two by two, feeling like a child and loving every second. He hauls the box down to the living room and then returns for the tree, the skeleton of a large spruce that he has kept and re-used for as long as he can remember, carefully spelling it a different colour every year. Once in place in front of the living room window, he touches the tip of his wand to the uppermost branch, thinks for a moment, and then casts until the whole thing is a shimmering silver-grey.
“Doesn’t her son have lunch with her?” Harry asks, impressed and entertained by the way his new friends seem to know each other’s lives inside out.
“Do you want me to have a word with her?” George asks, sounding scandalised.
**~*~**
Just before the flash goes off, he wraps his arm around Harry and squeezes tight.
“Anything interesting?”
“Shall we start?” he asks, taking out a notebook from his pocket. “I made a list of all the businesses we should visit and I drew a map of the street.”
“I regret that I got so old without marrying the person I’ve loved for most of my life,” Esmee says, wistful expression seeming to reach out and tug at Harry’s heart. “Shan says it’s just a piece of paper and we don’t need it. She’s right, but sometimes it’s not just about what you need.”
“Ah,” he says, surprised. It’s snowing, and not just a little bit.
“You could have done whatever you wanted,” he says at last. “You could have gone to live in another country. You could have been a… man about town, and had loads of beautiful women fighting over you, and then married one and had lots of posh, blond children.”
“Ida! It’s Draco… well, it’s all of us. We’re just here to see if you’re okay.”
Over at Sage, it’s a similar story; this time, the kitchen has been the main focus, with ruined food smeared across every surface and several expensive items missing. The dining room floor reveals a set of shoe prints that seem to point to a hurried departure. Draco crouches to examine one of the prints while Timothy takes photographs.
“You know, I’ve lost count of the number of friends who’ve apologised to me about something they’ve accidentally said to some undercover shit of a reporter that has then ended up in the paper the next day. They want a quote about me. Something they can twist into a story. When I started doing all this weird stuff... the hair, the pineapples—”
“Well said, Harry,” Esmee murmurs.
“I’m fine,” Harry says faintly, but no one is listening.
When he returns the next day with soup and toasted sandwiches, Harry is still busy with his stock take. He accepts the bag and steaming cup from Draco with a mixture of exasperation and gratitude, and other than a soft ‘thank you’, says nothing as he sips his soup and strides purposefully around the shop with a clipboard.
Draco scoffs, yanking a lever that brings the bus screeching to a halt. “Don’t you read, Potter?”
“You see,” Danica says, patting his hand, “that’s why we come here. We’re all alone in one way or another. My husband died five years ago and I lost my son and my grandchildren to the Death Eaters.”
“Look, I’m actually... hang on, where’s my button?” Sam demands, pulling at his shirt just as something small and cool is dropped into Luna’s hand.
He takes a deep breath and shows the picture to Draco. “This is where George is going on his honeymoon. I’d like to go there.” He pauses, frowning. “Not with George. Or on a honeymoon. It just looks nice. I’m going to stop talking now.”
“Mine’s Icaria.”
Harry pulls a face. “Don’t you start.”
The ladies greet him with enthusiasm and Montague, who has been licking up tea from a saucer near his feet, plants his paws on Harry’s knee and lets out an impressive sneeze.
“Draco, it’s the Prophet. They aren’t interested in you as a person. They just want to boil you down to something that sounds snappy for people who are reading the paper before they’ve even had their first cup of coffee.”
Scrambling to his feet, he pulls his discarded t-shirt over his head and walks out into the tangled mess of garden. The thick covering of moss is soft and cool against his bare feet and he stretches pleasurably, relieved to feel no traces of a hangover from the previous night. When he spots Draco, sitting on a large rock at the water’s edge, he heads to join him, stepping carefully over the stony ground. He perches beside Draco and leans back on his hands, relishing the morning sunshine on his face and breathing in the cool, damp air. Every breath tastes crisp and pure, as though the rain has washed the landscape clean.
“I didn’t think it would be her that would let the cat out of the bag,” Danica says, leaning back and sipping her tea calmly.
“Calculated,” Draco supplies. “Some people’s minds work like that, and they are usually the sort of people who have no idea why anyone would choose to help a sick child over their own interest. Believe me, I lived with someone like that for many years.”
“She said not to rush home,” Danica says, but when Corrie prods her with a knitting needle, she holds her hands up and grins. “I’m not saying I wouldn’t do the same.”
“Excuse me? Mr Potter?”
Harry waits for the shop door to click shut behind his customer and then lets out the yawn he’s been fighting for the last few minutes. He leans on the counter and lets it take him, idly hoping that the action will sweep away his fractured night of sleep and the remnants of some very strange dreams, particularly the one that had featured Draco’s wedding to Mr Pike and their subsequent children.
“You saved thousands,” Danica says, and he meets her eyes. It hurts.
“Yes, though my mother is keen to meet Mrs Weasley, so perhaps you could bring her and Mr Weasley, too? It’s horribly short notice, I know, but we’ve got a lovely menu for the run-up to Christmas and I thought…” Draco pauses. “I’m not sure what I thought.”
Draco ignores the comments and looks at the pictures. Potter has a button missing on his coat. Potter’s jeans have a hole in them at the knee. Potter’s hair looks just how Potter’s hair has always looked, like he’s been ruffling his fingers through it without even noticing. Potter wears the same outfit twice in one week. This, according to the creator of the article, is the worst ‘style sin’ of all, and Draco can’t help the twinge of sympathy and irritation that passes through him.
“A wise choice,” Mr Borteg says, prodding the till with his wand.
“You took your time,” Ida says, smiling up at them from her pillows and squeezing the little dog tightly. “Do I look ghastly?”
“Of course not,” Harry says loudly, staring into the man with the hat until he slinks away. “I took him to the park where he could be with the other swans. That’s all, I promise.”
“Florean, you’re a clever man,” he mumbles to himself, fishing out some coins to throw into the nearest donation tin.
“We’d better be off,” Harry says, ushering Rose out of the pub before Tom can ask him about the most recent crimes.
“Because…?”
Ginny nods, and when she turns to face Luna, the sunset paints her pale skin with glowing pink and gold. Beside her on the grass, her Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes robes sit discarded in a ball not dissimilar to the one Harry makes every afternoon.
Hermione… is a trier, and Harry loves that about her, but her experimental mode often produces dishes that are challenging to say the least. After years of kitchen-based frustration and Ron’s offers-turned-pleas to take over all the cooking himself, she has found her niche. Hermione might be a culinary disaster, but when presented with the humble potato, she becomes, quite simply, magical. She turns out perfect gratins, homemade hash browns that have been known to make Ron weep, and roast potatoes to rival those of her mother-in-law. In secret, Ron, Harry and Rose have agreed that Hermione’s roasties might just outshine Molly’s, but in the interest of their collective sanity, they have elected to keep this information to themselves.
“Wise decision,” Draco says, getting to his feet. “I’m sorry about taking advantage of your sofa, but I had a wonderful time. Thank you.”
To Harry’s astonishment, he shakes Ron’s hand and stalks into the kitchen. Five seconds later, the back door clicks shut and Ron and Harry stare at each other.
“Is he alright, Juno?” Danica asks, and before Harry can make a grab for the cage, Juno is carefully picking up the handle in her teeth and bounding onto the table.
Something like amusement flickers in Draco’s eyes and Harry suddenly feels self-conscious.
“I do all my shopping here and I know what’s been going on,” the man says haughtily. “Everything’s
“I forgive you for being an idiot,” Draco says, and then they are leaning close, lips brushing, and then Harry is jerked backwards and almost falls off the bench.
“Yes. We’ll come, and they must come to us for Christmas Day,” Molly says, as though this idea is already settled in her mind, and it probably is.
By the time she bids goodbye to Mr Abernathy and runs up to the house to change for work, she is brimming with optimism once more. Together, they have gone over the plan and looked through the pages of the book, noting successes, works in progress, and actions to be carried out at a later date. Despite Mr Abernathy’s enthusiasm for the idea, her plans regarding Harry and Draco are not yet ready to be implemented.
Harry shrugs. “Why wouldn’t I? This is fantastic. Don’t the ladies like it?”
“No one,” Harry says firmly. “We’re all going to go to Florean’s meeting and we’re going to figure this out.”
Harry chews on his nail, feeling his heart swell and ache. “Fancy,” he whispers.
“Well, it’s...” He looks more closely and wonders if he’s going mad. “It looks like a tape measure. In the shape of a trout.”
“Well, it may have escaped your notice but you
“I’m sorry I’m late, not a word, merry Christmas,” Harry says all in one breath, shutting the back door and inhaling the delicious savoury steam that almost seems to fill the kitchen.
“Draco’s not going to like Montague being in there,” Danica says darkly.
Ivy is laughing now, resting her head on her knees and covering her face with her hands. Magnus and Fergus are staring at her in mute curiosity, and it won’t be long. Stanley is chasing something through the long grasses without a care in the world. Harry is radiating anxiety so intensely that Draco can taste it. He’s worried, and it’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous because none of it matters. People were always going to find out, it’s just that he’d hoped the process might be more… dignified. Then he looks at Stanley, who has tipped over onto his back, all six legs cycling in the air, and at Magnus, who is gripping Fergus’s hand with such obvious pride, and at Harry, who seems frozen in place.
“Probably was trying to gnaw its way to your brain,” Corrie says, and her laughter vibrates through the floor and into Harry’s body.
Harry lifts a weary arm and then drops it back to the table. “All in good time.”
Now that he’s alone with Draco, every useful word seems to have flown out of his head and all he can do is stare as the panic rises in his chest. He pushes his hands into his pockets just for something to do, and his fingers brush against the crackleball.
Draco snorts. “If they’re going to lie to anyone, it’s going to be MLE, not us. Besides,” he says airily, “No one would dare to tells untruths in the presence of Needle the Crime Swan.”
Ida’s voice echoes inside his head.
“What’s the matter, Caroline?” she asks gently.
“Because it’s too far. I don’t want to... go away. I want to be here.”
“Yeah,” he says weakly, suddenly loathing the sound of his own voice. “Don’t you have restaurant things to do?”
“And so you…?”
Sam stares at them, bewildered. “What’s so funny?”
That night, she Apparates into the long grasses and walks down to the stream. The light is fading for the day, leaving behind streaks of pink and gold that shimmer over the water. Mr Abernathy calls to her from a low branch and she calls back to him, imitating his greeting and hoping she hasn’t accidentally said something offensive.
“I remember that,” Harry says, shaking his head. “It would have stuck up above the other buildings on that side of the street. It just wasn’t practical… but…”
The sweet stall lady laughs. “It was a good deal. I can feel my feet again now.”
Draco shrugs. “Why not?”
Someone warm and squashy is helping him back to his chair and he allows it to happen. Sweating profusely now, eyes stinging and skin on fire, he curls into a ball and lets himself drift, barely hearing the discussion taking place at the table.
As he lets his eyes fall closed, he wonders just what Draco means by ‘later’.
“Merry Christmas,” he says, and Draco rests a slightly prickly chin on his shoulder.
The first picture is of Montague, perching on Ida’s lap with his mouth open in an enormous yawn, while in the background, Corrie is pulling a similar face in order to get her teeth around one of Molly’s cupcakes. Harry grins and flicks through the others: there’s Danica, making Harry the mouse jump for a sunflower seed; Eilish and Ida gripping cups of tea and laughing; Juno on her back in the aisle, rolling around with all four feet in the air; Draco, caught by surprise, turning around in the driver’s seat as though someone has just called his name, and several fantastic snaps of all six of them wearing their hats, plus a close-up of Corrie and the tea cosy. There are pictures of him, too, and he almost doesn’t recognise himself in a single one of them.
“It’s our tradition,” Ida says, beaming and pushing a plate of mince pies towards him.
“I can’t believe you found them,” Felicity says, pitching up next to Daraja and stretching out a badly scratched hand to touch the wrappings.
“All the time?” Harry repeats, words muffled against Draco’s shoulder.
makes him feel torn up inside. He has a small children’s campaign lined up for the new year, but it’s only in Ireland and he’s already starting working out how many days a week he can come home. There must be plenty of home-grown charities that would appreciate his assistance and still allow him to play Knight Bus conductor on a part-time basis.
Harry listens to the splutters and rasps of the engine, the uneven rhythm of Draco’s breathing and the tapping of his fingers on the wheel. There is a distinct discomfiture that connects the bus and its driver, and he can’t help wondering how much truth there is in Ida’s supposition that the two of them are magically linked. Of course, if that’s true, the question is: who started the cycle? Is Draco unsettled because the bus is unsettled, or did his presence here unnerve Draco, who in turn is causing the bus to misbehave?
“We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe he’s gone back to Professor Malfoy’s rooms already,” someone says. There are two sets of footsteps, one heavy and one light and clicking.
“Of course,” Draco murmurs, hanging his head slightly for effect.
“What… the actual fuck… is wrong with you?” he demands.
Draco stares at him, mind racing. He doesn’t really know why he’s still here. All he knows is that he doesn’t want to leave. In the end, he just says the first thing that pops into his head.
“Why is it, then, that when I went to give Mrs Skower her potions yesterday evening, she told me all about how wonderful it was that her friends came to see her, and that one of them,” she hisses with a shudder, “was a sausage dog?”
“How old am I?” comes a scratchy voice from the door.
“That’s the spirit,” Esmee says, treating Harry to a flash of her brilliant smile.
Draco inhales sharply. He blinks. “Er, no. Who told you that?”
“It’s the main part,” Ron says with obvious pride. “And Rosie was the only one who knew all the lines. She’s been so excited about the whole thing that she’s learned everybody’s lines.”
Harry takes the coins and squints at the date. “1900,” he says, impressed. “These are even older than…”
Draco lifts an eyebrow. “I hadn’t thought of that.”
“Neither do I,” Draco admits. “Do you think we should warn Reuben that she’s on the war path?”
“If anyone around here is spoiled, it’s not you,” he tells the mouse, who is now poking his nose out of the cage and sniffing with dedication. “No,” he mumbles to himself. “It’s not the mouse, it’s the
“Perhaps she’s trying to tell you something,” Draco says drily, and then continues before Harry can get a word in. “We’d better get back. There’s work to be done.”
“I don’t talk in my sleep,” he mumbles, pulling the blankets in tight and relishing the warmth of the fire on his face. “Shush.”
He hurries through Borteg’s and into the distillery, where he finds an empty cup and spells water into it. He drinks the whole thing without stopping to breathe and then collapses into his chair.
Harry opens his mouth to answer but Mrs Purley beats him to it.
“How do we—?” Draco begins, but William slaps each of them on the shoulder and then is gone.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says quietly.
“Yes,” say Charlie, Ginny and Hermione, and Ron grins.
“He likes pretty things,” Danica says slyly. “Perhaps he’ll learn to like you.”
“We do have a map of the street marked with everyone’s whereabouts at the times of the incidents,” Harry says. “You can come and have a look once you’ve finished that.”
“Jamaican men are the most stubborn,” Corrie insists. “So I know more than most.”
“Well, now I’m intrigued,” Harry laughs, and when Draco holds out the squashy package, he takes it and tears away the wrapping paper.
She smiles, gold teeth glinting in the sunlight. “Maybe I will think about it. How is Elegua treating you?”
A ripple of amusement runs around the overstuffed room. Harry flushes.
He wouldn’t mind so much but the results are rarely worth the effort, usually consisting of complaints about Quidditch managers or hopeless rants about potion prices and the impending end of the world. And Harry Potter, of course. A disquieting proportion of the people who call in to the show have something to say about Potter—what he might or might not be doing, with whom he might be doing it, whether or not the reporters from the Daily Prophet properly understand him...
Potter glances up, green eyes flickering with amusement. “You need a replacement filter cube for your tubeworm farm?” he asks, lifting an eyebrow.
“That man could sell ears to a house-elf,” Draco says, shaking his head.
you.”
“Well, sometimes we get off it,” Corrie points out, picking up her knitting. “Draco takes us to nice places, doesn’t he, girls?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, feeling useless.
“Benny’s got a picture of Hermione Granger on his wall,” Otis offers, and when Luna turns back to him, she is surprised to realise that a small group has assembled around them.
“Are you in love?”
“You like… water?” asks Ginny’s new boyfriend, speaking for the first time in several minutes.
“Good luck!” he roars, and then throws his door closed with a clang and a crash.
Feeling prickly all over, Harry goes to shrug off his coat until he remembers that he had left it at home because the morning had felt unusually mild. As the ladies fuss over him, placing their hands on his forehead and pressing his wrist for his pulse, he begins to feel heavy, fractious, fidgeting in his seat and fighting to take a full breath.
“Indeed. I thought you might say that,” Florean says, and then winks at Harry and raises his voice. “You see, I’m looking to create a very special Christmas ice cream today, and what I really need is a helper… someone who really likes ice cream and isn’t afraid of getting a little bit messy with the chocolate sauces and the honey and the fudge…”
Stanley scuttles closer and tacks softly, hoping to be allowed to join in. She laughs and strokes his shell, but the boy looks cross.
“How many animals are going to be in this production?” Draco asks, folding his arms.
Luna grins back, watching as he leaps up onto the stall to take her place. He looks over at Sam, waiting for his signal, and Luna turns around to wait, too, only mildly surprised to see Harry and Draco standing right next to each other and involved in an intense exchange of words. Finally, Sam nods, and George casts a
Mr Borteg steps closer. In the ghostly wandlight, his face looks paler than ever, and his usual neat plait is missing, leaving his long hair to flutter in the wind.
“I hope you finish yours before Fred’s speech, then,” she says. “I overheard him practising it and there’s something about a dragon’s willy—”
“Unsettling,” Draco says. “I suppose we should add our names to the list of victims.”
Mr Abernathy doesn’t wake until she is getting ready for bed. He shakes himself and struggles to his feet, sending pencils clacking everywhere, and when his little eyes fix upon her, she doesn’t think she imagines the weight of accusation there.
“Sorry for taking so long,” Draco says, settling into his chair with a large paper bag.
“I am full,” Draco says, equally sternly, and for a moment, they both regard each other steadily over the tops of their glasses.
