“How about we skip the small talk hm?” Draco groaned into the man's ear, hoping that he would get the hint that a healthy relationship wasn't something he was looking for tonight. He complied and pushed Draco up against the wall of the pub, he grabbed his face and brought it up to his, their lips being brought together, both now with a mutual hunger. The man began to trace Draco’s jaw, then his neck, beginning to run his hands against the curve of his torso.
“That’s amazing! I know you always hated that place. Where are you working now?” he was genuine in his excitement for Harry.
“Draco? Is that you?” A soft voice asked as he was trying to choose a pair of sunglasses on a cheap rack. He muttered a string of curses in his head, of course now had to be the time he ran into someone. He turned on the heel of his shoe, seeing Aurora’s bleached blonde hair  and small physique looking back at him. He grinned the best he could, knowing it looked incredibly inauthentic as he said,
“That’s great I’m happy for you guys, really. I still feel like that might be something you would want to mention before you know, you get married and all that. Feels sorta unfair to Aurora if you ask me.” He was getting angry and he hated himself for showing any kind of emotion around Noah.
“You’re usually not this nice” Draco responded, glancing over at Harry. It was the first time they made direct eye contact that night for more than a split second. He saw how Draco’s eyes were red, and he had bags under his eyes, something he never pictured Draco having before. He wasn’t sure how to reply back to him, he himself didn’t know why he was being so nonchalant with him.
“Happy Christmas, Harry” Draco responds, leaving a trail of kisses starting at his forehead and down to his chest, Harry pulling him into him and wrapping his body with his arms afterwards.
As soon as he was in his apartment, Draco began to feel all of the emotions that had been building up since Noah first told him about the engagement. He had felt as though he had been stabbed in the stomach, and what made it even worse was that Draco never cared about his hookups. They were always just something to do so he didn’t have to endure living with his own thoughts when he was alone. He didn’t know what was so different this time.
“I don’t think you’re understanding Harry. This isn’t up to your discretion. You will do as I say and Malfoy does not hear a word about this, you hear me? If Draco interferes with this case in any way, it’ll be your job on the line. I think it’s best you went home now.” Harry stared at Marvin in shock. He had very rarely spoken to Harry in that tone and although it was usually warranted, this time felt unnecessarily cruel. He decided to take Marvin’s advice and leave before he said anything he would regret. He slammed the door on his way out, all his previous anxiety turning into rage.
“Merlin, Malfoy. You scared me. The tea is in that cupboard above the kettle, I should have chamomile in there somewhere.” Harry stated as he turned back towards his files.
Harry bobbed up and down the length expertly, Draco’s stomach formed in knots as he did. The warmth of his mouth around his cock turning him on more than he could imagine. The sight of Harry’s mouth around him was enough to make him cum on the spot.
He continued to get ready, drying himself off, styling his hair, getting dressed from his obscene amount of muggle clothing that he knew flattered his body in the best way. As he was finished, he walked to his kitchen, casting a spell to quickly make himself food. Normally he loved cooking, it was the only thing that ever forced him to slow down. The process of taking immense care while preparing a meal brought him peace and steadied his mind, already being late however, he quickly ate his breakfast and apparated to work.
“I fucked up is how it's going, the poor bloke can barely look me in the eye anymore. It’s probably best if I keep my distance from now on.” Harry sighed, the memories of Malfoy’s rage flashing in his mind. He has spent so many nights brewing in his mind what he could have done differently that the topic is nearly exhausted for him.
Maybe it was unfair of Harry to use Draco as a distraction from their death - the anniversary only being a few days away - but he was drunk, reckless, and had a blatant disregard for anything besides his own feelings. He recognized how selfish this made him feel, and the self loathing was currently hidden under an overinflated ego from finally shagging a man that used to look at him with hatred.
“Harry, I know you think that just one short conversation will fix this, but it won’t. It’s going to take much more, and quite frankly, I don’t have the energy for it right now. Let’s just go on like normal for today and we can talk about this tomorrow or when we get home. Okay?” Draco said softly, his head looking down at his fingers in his lap.
He unlocked the door, stumbling into the front entrance, he hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he was welcomed by the smell of pancakes and coffee. He followed the smell, desperate for any sort of nutrition, his sunglasses still on to deflect the light away from his burning eyes. Stepping into the kitchen, he was greeted by a bed-head Harry Potter, whistling quietly as he flipped burning pancakes over on the pan, fuck, he muttered to himself, throwing another one into the garbage. Draco leaned against a wall with his arms crossed, watching Harry attempt to cook. It was all very amusing.
Instead, both of the men simply sat silently in their chair, a slight smile on their lips but nothing more.
He lifted Harry off the couch and led him to the bed, changing him into a pair of pyjamas before laying him down to sleep, placing a glass of water on the bedside table for the morning. Despite Harry’s constant resistance against going to sleep, he was quick to pass out as soon as his head hit the pillow.
“I don’t think so, we’ve just become friends of sorts” he replied. He wasn’t even sure if they were, they floated in this in between, a mixture of friendship and past rivalry.
Draco sighed and made his way to the kitchen, picking up his mail and sorting through it. He noticed a particular envelope with a red trim. He pulled it out from the bunch, opening it carelessly.
“It’s fine, could you at least explain what’s going on?” Draco sighed as he placed his palm over his eyes. All of the exhaustion that he thought he had slept away coming back.
Draco got up and started swaying to the music, humming along quietly. Harry laughed as he took another sip, feeling much looser and calmer than the beginning of the night. He felt Draco come up behind him but he kept his body forward over the counter. Draco slumped his body over Harry’s back, closing his eyes. Harry’s nerves shot up along his spine, he held his breath before releasing it cautiously, as if there was no more air to breathe.
Nick took his dick out of Draco and laid down on his back, pulling him on top of him, Draco straddling his hips as he aligned his ass with the tip of his throbbing cock. He lowered down slowly, groaning at the dick filling him up yet again, he rolled his hips up and down the length, his head thrown back with his hands on Nick’s chest. He felt a hand grab the length of his own cock, stroking it up and down to the rhythm of his grinding. The position allowed for Nick’s cock to fill him up deeper, hitting his prostate nearly every time, resulting in a painful pleasure that had his dick twitching in need to cum. He felt Nick’s own cock pulsing inside him, knowing he was close to finishing. Draco sped up slightly, rolling his hips over the dick, his head blind with heat as he felt his dick release a spread of cum onto Nick’s chest, his eyes rolling back and mouth letting out a series of loud moans. He continued the rhythm even after he came, seeing Nick close to the edge and tightening his walls around his length. Draco groaned as he felt his large hands around his hips, pounding his dick further into Draco before he felt himself being filled with hot liquid as Nick came into his ass.
The snow wrinkled underneath his feet as he stepped up closer to Harry, who when realizing it was him, stood up abruptly to his feet.
“Just some spaghetti with a meat sauce, cooking is therapeutic for me, helps me calm down.” Harry caught his breath after laughing, startled at his own ability to feel almost at peace near Draco.
They felt silent for a few moments, both of them contemplating bringing up the metaphorical elephant in the room.
Until finally, he felt his mouth connecting with theirs, he felt his mouth open up and a tongue slip in, he felt their hands tugging at his hair, and their hips grinding against his. They pressed him up against a wall in a hallway tucked away at the back of the club, their lips trailing down Harry’s neck, sucking on the spot behind his ear. Their hands wandered down towards his dick, now half hard in his pants.
“That’s not fair. You made your decision 5 years ago. You have no right to walk into my life when I’m finally happy for the first time in years, and try to break it all down. I can’t have you in my life again if everything I’ve built while you’ve been gone is going to change.” Draco said.
“Harry?” It still felt odd calling him by his first name, he was so used to the poison laced Potter that he had hung onto in school that this felt wildly intimate.
I loved writing from their perspectives and I hoped you enjoyed my interpretation of these characters.
“You know, if you were going to drain my liquor cabinet, you could’ve at least texted. I would have picked up replacements on the way home.” Harry said, although he honestly didn’t really care, he was just trying to make conversation.
“Of course, like I said yesterday, it was just this once. We were just both drunk and horny.” Harry responded, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Oh shut up, I wanted it to have a personal touch.” Harry says in defence, his cheeks blushing lightly.
“You’re a real prick you know. I don’t like this situation any more than you do but at least I’m mature enough to respect other people’s time. Believe it or not, not everyone is willing to wait around for Mr. Potter just for a smidge of his attention.” Draco spat, getting more and more angry and was really regretting not leaving earlier. Maybe that would’ve at least caused Potter some trouble at work.
“Do you uh...or would you want some? I made more than I needed so I could give you some if you want.” Harry didn’t know how to react to this version of Draco, it was clear he was desperately trying to be nice. He thought back to what Casper said earlier about trying to make him feel more comfortable.
“It’s no worry at all. Draco, how have you been?” Hermione asked, her head tilting lightly in curiosity.
“Look, I think he’s telling the truth Marvin, why don’t we just drop it. Rob and I will go and investigate the apartment a little further and see if it leads us anywhere” Harry stated, avoiding eye contact with Draco at all costs. It was strange seeing him so soon after their semi-civilized conversation last night. But now, in the harsh reality of daylight, everything had quickly returned back to their normal. He had been the auror that was put on Draco’s case, considering it was seen as high profile because of Draco’s parents. Making both of them uncomfortable, but they luckily wouldn’t have to see each other much. After this first interview, the rest of it was in the Ministry’s hands.
As he phoned the taxi he leaned over onto a side table, steadying his body. He thought about his moment with Harry earlier on the balcony. They had gotten so affectionate in the last few months, always acting nonchalantly about it, as if they were just friends. Draco wasn’t sure how to react to this, the uncertainties of their relationship always leaving him dizzy.
“Alright. I’m not sure it’s a good idea either. Conflict of interest or something like that” Aaron joked, his mouth barely upturned into a smile. Draco just nodded.
And through all of this he had no one to lean on but himself, his two closest friends had both become strangers.
Draco had half a mind to binge drink himself back into a mindless oblivion, something that had become so routine in his state of living that he often looked past its destructive qualities. It wasn’t the hangovers that got to him, those could be whisked away with a simple potion, but the feelings of emptiness that left him more alone than he was before.
The air in the room was incredibly awkward, the only noise being the occasional shifting of someone readjusting in their seat. Curse Marvin for choosing this day out of all to be late.
“Mm?” he mumbled in response, he figured he knew where this was going. He knew Harry far better than to think that anything that he said last night could be repeated in the cold sober light of the morning.
This fanfic is coming to a close! I only have one more chapter planned and then its over. It's been wonderful writing for you all.
“You look awfully glum, don’t tell me you’ve run out of hangover potion again, you need to take those far too often for your wellbeing” said a voice at the door with a smirk. It was Aaron Turner, his only real friend at work and one he valued immensely”
“Well, after having to pick up your drunk ass off of the washroom floor in the middle of the night so many times, I figured I might do both of us a favour and make myself a key” replied Aaron, grabbing himself a water bottle from the fridge and sitting down onto the barstool.
Harry knew he was right, and that the connection between him and Draco had become undeniable. Yet the idea of being vulnerable with anyone, Draco especially, was already making his chest tighten with anxiety.
After their initial first date, they became practically inseparable. Joining each other on walks to and from work, spending a few nights at Harry’s apartment then switching to Draco’s. It was an unbound and sexually active version of the first few months they had lived together.
“You’re drunk.” he replied, not sure what that had to do with anything but felt the need to point it out.
“Ron and Hermione are throwing a party at their place and we are going.” Harry said, his smile creeping up his face.
“I don’t know what I was expecting but this was certainly not it.” Draco said slowly as he eyed the rest of the room. Taking in the wall of framed photos of him with Hermione and Ron, a few photos of Sirius and Lupin, and his parents in the centre.
They spent the next couple of hours continuing to catch up on each other's lives, Aaron had been given an exciting new project at work, one he felt really pushed his potions skills and forced him to become more innovative. Draco barely remembered the last time he had really been invested with work, most of the time he floated through the day, doing the same mundane potions over and over. Although he was eager for an opportunity like Aaron’s, he also knew he didn’t have the mental capacity to throw himself into his work right now. They talked about his depressive episode, and what triggered it. He wasn’t entirely sure as it was a plethora of things, but he was used to the chemical imbalance in his head that caused him to experience days like yesterday quite frequently. Aaron was usually around to bring him food and comfort him through the day, but yesterday forced Draco into a complete shut down for the majority of the day, which led him to be unable to even want to call Aaron.
Draco hadn’t even bothered to wait for Harry, he had heard enough in the office and was now speeding out of the Ministry to gather his things.
He was halfway through the door when he saw Harry speed walking down the hall, his partner not far behind him. Harry slowed down to nearly a halt when he saw Draco, clearly confused as to what he was doing there.
He was unsure why seeing Potter after so long had this effect on him, he couldn’t have cared less if Potter was in his presence when they were in school, so why did it matter now? He stared at Aaron to find a glimpse of explanation in his eyes. Draco had never paid attention much to how Aaron presented himself, sure he was a fair bloke, he had dirty blonde hair and a solid body on him, but nothing that Draco would ever see as more than platonic. He was grateful for this as he was not one to shit where he ate. His mind wandered back to Potter. Draco noticed this and put it to a stop, this was the last thing he needed. He thought he was rid of the prick back when he left Hogwarts, and having him in his life again, whether in his head or in reality, was not something he was eager to repeat.
Draco grabbed the last of his things, his eyes hot and brain numb, he picked up his suitcase and apparated to the portkey to England, not facing Harry as he did.
“What are you doing?” Harry questioned, feeling strange by the unfamiliar pressure that Draco’s body brought.
They agreed to get ready and regroup downstairs in 10 minutes, which gave Harry just enough time for a quick body shower before they left.
“Oh, that was not even half of it. You’ll see it on New Years once Hermione actually lets loose.” Harry laughed, wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulder and placing a kiss on his temple.
The night was starting to feel more and more endless, it was nearly 2 in the morning, and he didn’t know where else to go. Going home didn’t feel like an option, because for some sick reason, he didn’t want the day to end. He didn’t want to wake up tomorrow and know that he hadn’t imagined this all. It was beginning to feel like that was the only choice he had left. Draco sat down on the curb of some random street. Wanting to take in the last of the night before getting ready to go home. Across the street there was a little cafe with fairy lights dangling at the entrance diagonally. A waiter was closing up the shop, seemingly it was a late night restaurant of some sort. He didn’t know if it was the alcohol, but he all of a sudden felt incredibly small, it was a nice feeling. Knowing that no matter how big his problems had felt for him, they were nearly nonexistent when it came to the grand scheme of things. He closed his eyes and let his body sway from side to side, feeling warm - and slightly ill. He knew that apparating home drunk was a bad idea, there are far more chances of screwing up the spell and getting brutally disfigured, but consequences didn’t seem realistic right now so Draco took his chances.
He hailed a taxi home, unloading the grocery bags onto the porch as he got dropped off. He barely spoke Italian, so the communication aspect of the drive was quite awkward, he could tell that the older Italian man was irritated by his English tendencies.
By the time Harry got home, Draco had been a bottle of scotch deep into his self medicating journey. Although he quickly found that the alcohol was doing little to no good to lessening his emotions, he continued to drink just for the disoriented feeling it provided him with, making him feel that maybe he wasn’t real and this wasn’t happening.
The purchasing of two bottles was a realistic approach to the night, he knew that if he were to be camped out at the building of Malfoy that he would need plenty of alcohol to not grow too guilty over his treatment of Draco. So he popped off the bottle cap and took his first swig out of plenty, walking back over to the curb across from the building pathetically.
Harry was willing to give up whatever chances he had to be with him if it meant that Draco would stay happy. He would gladly watch from afar, wasting his life away basking over a man in love with someone else. For if he could not have all of him, he would want the small parts, he would want to see him laugh and cry, he would want to see him in love with someone that took care of him, he would want to see him jump into the arms of a man that wasn’t him.
“Harry, Ron and I were going to grab a late dinner, care to join?” Although the three of them didn’t see each other nearly as often as they’d like, they all tried to get together at any chance possible. Harry agreed, wrapping up the file he was looking at. Casper stayed, telling Harry that he would only stay for another half hour or so, Harry knew that that was a lie, they never left work earlier than 8pm.
They walked past the concierge and into the elevator, Draco pressing the button to their floor. The two of them stood closer together than necessary, barely taking up room in the space. Draco closed his eyes and the world around him spun, he could always tell that he was properly drunk whenever that happened.
He tiptoed over to the door, his heart pounding in his chest, before opening the door slowly, his hand wearily on his wand. He took a deep breath, turning his head around the door to catch a glimpse of the suspect.
“You guys know me, I just wanna focus on my work and maybe fuck a bloke here and there when the feeling arises” Draco joked, half of him being serious and the other half wanting to make himself seem aloof so Noah wouldn’t somehow see right through his cool exterior.
Draco’s dick twitched, his stomach filled with Harry, his cock continuing to slam into him. Draco gripped onto the sheets, his knuckles turning white as he felt his prostate being pressed against consistently. Harry’s hand wrapped around Draco’s dick, pumping up and down sending Draco into a euphoric state. He groaned with each thrust, marvelling at the sound of Harry’s moans escaping his lips, turning him on even more. Fuck I’m gonna cum Draco. Despite them being on a first name basis for months now, the sound of his own name coming out of Harry’s mouth made his cock throb. He wrapped his hand around the back of Harry’s neck, kissing him roughly as he felt himself unload onto his own stomach, his body feeling hot, waves of pleasure passing through his body. He gripped onto Harry’s shoulder, digging his fingers in deeper. Harry continued to thrust into Draco until his own cum filled Draco, his head throwing back in a groan, his hands gripping the sheets.
Later, when the two of them were chopping vegetables, the only sounds around them being the soft melodic harmony of classical music that Draco had put on and the rhythmic slicing of knives, he felt the difference in their relationship again. It was almost as if the months that they had been friends had been washed away and they were back to the uncomfortable silence that begged for conversation.
“Anyways, the Renovation headquarters have been seized, just last night actually -” It was at this point that Draco peeked his head into the room, throwing a warm smile towards Harry as he placed down a bowl of breakfast for Harry to enjoy. He walked over and placed a silent peck on Harry’s cheek, wrapping his arms around his waist. “And I cannot express my gratitude for your compliance enough, I know it must have been hard for you to maintain silence about Malfoy’s parents for a few months - him living with you and all, but it made my job exponentially easier.” Harry’s head whipped towards Malfoy who had let go of Harry and taken a step back, his eyes wide and filled with pain. “You could not imagine the bother it would have been had he tried to get involved” Marvin laughed over the phone. Draco stormed out of the room, his violent footsteps shaking as he slammed his feet down the stairs.
“Oh, Merlin” Harry sighed, rubbing his hands over his face. “Now I just feel stupid.” Draco chuckled.
But this was what Harry did, he wasn’t sure when he changed from the all loving boy he used to be, it was sometime after the war. After he had seen everyone around him find love, content with their lives and welcoming life as a gift. Harry, much to his chagrin, felt years behind everyone he was close to, still stuck trying to heal from the trauma of war.
Sorry this is so short! Been having a little bit of writers block when it comes to this fanfic. More chapters coming soon though!
Draco was sitting on the couch with Hermione as Harry and Ron were in the kitchen taking what they called ‘obligatory pre-party shots’ which they both claimed were vital to have a good time while they were out. Truthfully speaking, Harry just needed an excuse to drink and survive this night of painful tension with his boyfriend.
He knew that this year would be significantly different from all of the other holiday seasons he’s enjoyed, yet there wasn’t a tinge of regret for his decision to spend it with Draco.
“Dracoooooooooo! Open the dooooooor!” Harry whined as he leaned against the door frame, sliding sloppily to the side as he saw Draco peak through the door before realizing who it was.
Harry’s eyes widened at the mention of the case. He had almost forgotten about his white lie which had dug him further into a hole. He wasn’t sure what compelled him to avoid telling Draco the truth, but something about seeing Draco torn down and broken had ignited pangs of severe guilt in Harry; guilt that he wasn’t ready to face or be responsible for. There was also a part of him that didn’t want their relationship to be tarnished by his nonsensical tucking away of important family matters. It was now that Harry considered that maybe Draco was too good for him, despite the obvious power imbalance between them when they were younger, Harry felt like a worse person than even an ex follower of Voldemort.
The phone rang for a few seconds, he had nearly forgotten it was New Years and now nearly 2 in the morning, he hoped that they would answer.
Rocky didn’t even begin to describe it. Up until recently, Draco and Harry haven’t been able to hold a conversation without some dispute starting. And although they have matured to a place where they could be civil - or at least Draco thought - it was still difficult to put the events of the past behind them.
Draco grunted in agreement, already feeling his stomach grumble in hunger and not willing to starve at his apartment in order to win an argument.
He was surprised it had taken him this long to flirt with Harry, he was normally a painfully sexual being and flirting came as second nature, but it wasn’t until now that he felt it would be reciprocated or appreciated. It had sparked a playfulness between them, and Draco smiled to himself as he pulled out a pair of black slacks and a light purple hoodie, meandering back into the hall to place it in Harry’s hands.
The next chapter will also be from Harry's POV, just wanted to provide more context for his interactions with Draco. It should be up midway next week! As always, let me know how you guys are enjoying this fic so far :))
“Woah… What are you guys doing here?” Harry said, trying to keep the confusion in his voice to a minimum.
The air was warm and welcoming in London. The sky was blue, the sun radiating light and flashing off of reflective buildings. Draco had left the apartment without another word to Harry, unwilling to prolong the few interactions that they did have, in fear of repeating any of the thoughts he had today in the shower. Whenever the sun was beaming and the city was illuminated, Draco’s mood felt exponentially better, that paired with the shower he had taken that washed off the grime and memories of last night, had Draco strolling through the streets with a grin. He was on his way to Aaron’s apartment, planning on stopping by a coffee shop beforehand.
“Oh Merlin, don’t even get me started” Draco stated, placing his hands over his face to hide the blush that was rising to his cheeks.
His toes were cold and wet from the snow, his jacket wrapped tightly around his body to keep whatever body heat he had left trapped in. He was quite eager to get inside, run himself a hot bath and let sleep take him. Somehow, he knew once he saw Harry sitting on the porch, his face tear soaked, that he would have to adjust his plans for the night.
He looked up at Harry through his eyebrows as he lit the cigarette for him, their faces close. Harry grabbed the cigarette box from Draco’s back pocket, taking one out for himself and lighting it in his mouth, taking a long drag as he rested his elbow on the balcony railing.
Apparently, Harry went through a phase where he smoked pot a lot, it was in his last year at Hogwarts, he mainly used it to dull the memories of the war. Hermione was convinced it was becoming a dependency, making Harry swear he would never touch the substance again. Obviously, he had, just occasionally now at parties. Draco found this funny, he hadn’t pictured Harry to be a stoner but the title seemed to fit him.
“Wowww so fancy! Just what I expected from pompous Draco Malfoyy” Harry slurred, unable to give him a proper complement.
The energy in the room shifted into one of awkwardness, both of them unsure of what to say. Draco scoured through the tea cupboard, desperately trying to find the chamomile quickly so he can rush back to his room and escape the tenseness of them being alone. He scrummaged as quietly as he could but from the look on Potter’s face from his peripheral, he wasn’t being as stealthy as he thought. Harry rose from his chair obnoxiously, stomping over to where Draco stood, reached into the cupboard and pulled out the chamomile, slamming it down onto the counter. Draco was about to protest at the rudeness of his actions, but chose to hold his tongue, he was in his turf.
As he was passive aggressively stirring the vegetables, his anger boiling under his skin as a response to rejection, he felt eyes on him from across the kitchen. This attention had made him feel even more uncomfortable than he was before, actively aware of his childlike behaviour when he was the one to agree to a casual one night stand in the first place.
Despite this, he finds himself trying not to worry about the details, instead he focuses on the little things, like watching his chest rise and fall in this hazy sunlit room, he’s sure that when the time comes, Harry will come around.
“Wow. That is definitely the one. Thank God, I thought we were going to be here forever” Aaron said as he came closer to admire the finer details of the clothing.
“I had one today, as you may have guessed” Draco mumbled as he used his hand to show off his unlike him attire.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll go.” Draco replied nonchalantly, not wanting to seem too eager. Harry smiled wide, bringing him into a rib crushing hug before yelling at him to go get ready.
Harry pulled off of the dick, leaving a string of spit. He pushed Draco’s legs up, exposing his ass. Harry muttered a wandless spell, leaving his hand slick with lube. He pressed one finger against the hole, making Draco’s dick twitch. Harry smirked at the sight, pressing his finger in completely. Draco’s eyesight began fading at the sides from the sensation, his moans filling up the room, causing Harry to cast a silencing spell.
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying?” Draco asked, his voice soft for the first time that night.
Draco reeked of alcohol, smelling it seep out of his pores. He groaned as he turned over onto his side, rubbing his eyes with the base of his palms. He threw his feet over the bed, steadying himself with his arms on either side. He was wearing just his boxers and an old shirt from a quidditch match that he had gone to see with his dad. As he walked out of the room, walking past the kitchen he saw two glasses and an empty bottle of scotch, paired with a full ashtray on the dining room table. He sighed out loud at the sight, reminders of last night creeping back into his head. He walked into the washroom, turning on the shower and letting the steam fill up the room. The water hitting his back felt incredibly cleansing, he began to feel the grime from the day before begin to clean off. He thought back to his arm against Harry’s over the balcony, how close he had gotten to his face. He looked down at his half hard cock, shaking his head at how turned on that prick makes him. He continued on with his shower routine, washing his hair and body, hoping that somehow this problem would leave by the end of the shower. Yet the images of last night kept creeping into his head, even though nothing happened, the tension alone was enough. He slid his hand down his abdomen, grazing his hip bones and running his hand down his thigh. His dick leaked with precum, washed away quickly by the hot water. He wrapped his hand around the length, beginning to pump up and down in a rhythmic motion, picturing it was Harry’s mouth that was around him. He let a groan escape his lips, slapping his free hand over his mouth to stifle the sound. He heard a loud knock at the door.
They had danced for around half an hour, their hips would occasionally grind against each other accidentally, and would send a jolt up Draco’s body, daring him to press himself further up against Harry.
“Alright, you make a decent point. Still, you never woke me up at three in the morning and made me put you to bed now did you?” Harry said, a blush falling over his cheeks.
hii sorry about the later upload i had such a writing block. let me know what you guys think as always. also, would u guys want more smut scenes incorporated throughout the chapters?
Despite this, despite knowing that being with Harry would lead to chaos and destruction, he still couldn’t resist whenever he as much as caught sight of him. No matter how much he swore he would stay away, give him the cold shoulder, ask Marvin to move him somewhere else, the second they were together again he was fighting for his love like it was his life source. A futile attempt most of the time, the once warm and giving Boy Who Lived was now cold and reserved, fucking his friends and leaving them hopeless at his feet.
So when the most exciting part of their day was just them sitting on the front porch of the house, sipping coffee and reading, Harry felt intoxicated in a way that made him want to never return back home. He would buy a property in Italy somewhere, maybe keep a garden or take up knitting.
“Cmon now, don’t be so brittle love, why don’t you talk to me anymore?” Harry whined, scooting closer towards Draco despite his efforts to stay apart.
That was all he needed to say for all of Draco’s inhibitions to fall, he pushed Harry off of him, taking his hand and bringing him into his room, unbuttoning his shirt as he walked.
When Harry finally gave in to the man’s advances and kissed him, he felt like he was simply going through the motions, his mind wandering onto what he should do the next day and if he needed to go get groceries. It was nothing like the hunger that he kissed Draco with - fuck - he wasn’t supposed to compare.
Harry kissed down to his thighs, biting at them lightly and kissing up towards his dick. Draco grabbed a handful of his hair, pulling at the strands as he felt his body respond to Harry’s actions.
“However, I can’t say I’m not disappointed in how last night ended, I was hoping to get a little further than a makeout” Harry said, his eyes darting in between Draco’s face and body.
However, that didn’t get him far. While he was able to keep his feelings for Draco at bay, it had pushed him away completely, his rude remarks and bitter attitude coming back quickly. Each harsh phrase hurt him more than Draco knew.
Draco was now at Aarons door, all of a sudden slightly anxious about having to explain himself about why he was being so aloof the last couple of days. Nevertheless, he raised his hand up to the door and knocked. The door swung open within seconds, Aaron at the other side of it, eyes red and filled with concern, relaxing slightly once he processed the sight of Draco.
“Oh Draco, you would not believe who is here, Harry Potter! Apparently Aurora knows him from their auror training, small world huh? Didn’t you go to school with him?” Oliver exclaimed as he pointed over to where Harry was standing by the bar. This night just kept getting worse and worse. Of course Potter had to be here, it's not like Draco was already preoccupied with having to keep other awkward encounters to a minimum, but now he also has to deal with the self righteous saviour of the wizarding world too. The waiter walked past with Draco’s drink and he downed the glass in one swig, placing it back on the tray and signalling for a second. Oliver and Marie eyed him suspiciously,
Sorry it took me so long to release this chapter, I was having a little bit of a mental block. Let me know what you thought and would you guys want chapters from Harrys pov?
“Needed a drink too... I guess.” He knew that was a half assed answer, but he couldn’t tell him he had fought for him at work and now felt a certain obligation to be nice to him. Draco just nodded, sliding over the bottle of liquor against the granite counters, and refilling Harry’s drink, looking up at Harry through his eyebrows towards the end. His stomach churned at the eye contact, he gulped down the entirety of the contents in his glass to suppress it down, before edging it towards Draco for another refill.
Aaron’s face was unreadable, a stone cold expression on his face that he had never seen before. He had dark undereye bags and his skin was pale and unkept.
This had got to be a new low for Harry, and boy, was he gut wrenchingly aware of it. It twisted his stomach to see who he had become, the old Gryffindor bravery was nowhere to be found. Instead, he was sitting across the building from a man he most likely loved while avoiding going home and not having the courage to go inside. How pathetic.
Nick took his fingers out, grabbing Draco by the hips and flipping him onto his stomach, his ass up in the air. Draco gripped onto the sheets of the bed as he felt the tip of Nick's dick line up with his ass, groaning at even the slightest pressure as he felt the length of the dick enter further into him. Nick pushed his hips forward, Draco letting out a loud moan, his eyes filling with tears as he felt the cock fill up his stomach. The strokes started off slow, allowing Draco to get used to the sensation and the size, becoming faster and pounding deeper into him, his head thrown back in pleasure, his body glazed with a thin layer of sweat as his walls tightened around Nick. A hand pushed his face down into the sheets, holding his hips as he continued to graze over his prostate, causing Draco’s knuckles to turn white as he gripped the bed, profanities slipping out of his mouth. He felt a pang on his ass, his skin slightly red from the slap, the mixture of pain and pleasure was always something that got Draco closer to the edge.
“I think it's you that doesn’t talk to me anymore, Harry.” Draco spoke calmly, careful to keep his composure while his heart raced from the close proximity of their bodies, not realizing how long it had been since they had been so near each other.
“That is not for you to decide Potter! I told you already, the Ministry is out of housing after the last raid! And with Malfoy being one of their clear targets, we can’t just have him running around the streets of London can we!” Marvin argued back. Who are they talking about? When he met with them earlier they acted as if they hadn’t had the faintest clue as to who could have targeted his apartment, and why. This was slowly becoming a living nightmare. He reached his hand up to knock on the door, it swinging open by Harry’s force. His face filled with rage, and the sight of Draco did not seem to help his situation.
Some wave of courage washed over him as he stared, all of a sudden unable to hold back his urge to be in his presence, to feel the warmth of his body, to hear the clattering of his mundane tasks from the other room. He wanted to be with him now and forever, to feel honoured to be able to experience his life with him. Just being with him was enough, he could live a painful life of seeing him fall in love with another, or of never kissing him again, he would rather that than be destined for a painful life of watching the one he loved slip away.
Harry throws him a strange glance but proceeds to pour him a glass, taking out the ingredients for dinner after he hands Draco the wine.
“I don’t know - everything? How was it like when you came out? What did you do besides auror work? Have you gone back to Hogwarts?” Draco said, impatient.
Draco pushed Harry out of the room first, going to grab the envelope containing his gift and jamming it into his pant pockets, hoping he had been at least semi-nonchalant.
Harry wasn’t sure how to respond, he didn’t want to put this off any longer but also wanted to respect Draco’s wishes.
“Yeah. Of course. You’re right. Just forget I said anything, I won’t tell her don’t worry.” Draco half smiled and began to reach for his wallet in his pocket. He couldn’t stand to look at Noah any more and wanted out of this suffocating room. He placed enough money down to cover the bill and began to stand up, feeling the tears beginning to brim his eyes, he was quick to turn around and put on his coat.
Harry sat alone at the bistro, his glass empty and his heart heavy. It had both hurt and enlightened him to see Draco doing well. Although he was still deeply in love, he could see the happiness seeping out of Draco even in his most mundane actions.
“Mine’s not nearly as dramatic as yours I don't think. I don’t really talk to anyone from Hogwarts anymore so didn’t have to come out to anyone besides my family - mom was wary but ultimately supportive, my father was more stern, simply emphasizing the importance of me not being promiscuous with it. Just his way of saying I shouldn’t flaunt that I’m gay. I started out in the auror program too, with Oliver, then realized my hatred for it and moved to potions. Should’ve known really, I was always into potions. I had a few boyfriends, nothing serious or anything that lasted longer than a few months, they were usually far too pretentious for me. And I haven’t gone back to Hogwarts either. Feels sort of weird too - as if it’s wrong for me to be there.”
“I’m sorry.” Draco avoided eye contact, pretending to not hear Harry. He was trying hard not to acknowledge his own pain, and having Harry near made that more difficult.
The rest of the day flew by casually, once Draco woke they made breakfast and went on a walk in the forest, Draco sharing stories of the other travels he’s done with his family. These stories piqued Harry’s interest, having seldom left England.
Not to mention, Aaron, his best friend of nearly 4 or 5 years now, had quickly abandoned his side because of his emotional unavailability, he knew that Aaron was probably the more sensible choice; he was calm, mature, and knew the ins and outs of Draco’s brain. But for some reason, all of that was not enough, not when Harry could walk into a room and Draco would fall on his knees to beg for his love if that would change anything. He could barely recognize himself in a mirror anymore, he was so love stricken that that was all he saw, not the confident and cocky Draco he once knew, but a more desperate, pathetic version of him.
Aaron tapped his arm, eyes wide, and pointed towards a person walking down the street towards them. It was Potter. Again. Second time in two days felt excessive and had dropped Draco’s mood nearly immediately. This time however, Draco decided to be an adult and greet Harry, after all, they weren’t teenagers anymore. He waited till Harry got a bit further up the street and noticed him, Harry’s eyes did a double take to make sure it really was Malfoy that he was seeing, before he recontained his cool and dusted off his shirt.
They waved over a waitress for another round of mimosas, laughing violently at stories from their youth, clearly causing a slight commotion at the bistro. They had fallen into an effortless banter, their legs touching underneath the table, a subtle hand on the wrist during conversation or an eye intently watching each other's every move.
Harry finished off his drink, now drunk, and followed Draco out onto the balcony. Draco already had a cigarette in his mouth, looking over at Harry, realizing he forgot a lighter. Harry pulled one out of his pocket, and lit his cigarette before grabbing one for himself. The breeze was sharp and cool, and worsened since they were on a higher floor of the apartment building. Draco shivered, pressing up against Harry’s shoulder, so their arms were shoved side by side. Harry ignored his stomach and continued taking puffs of his cigarette. Draco was already putting out his first cigarette and reaching for a second.
“Need a hand?” Harry asked, closing the balcony door behind him. Draco just laughed in response as he handed him the lighter.
“Let’s go to a club tonight” Aaron urged, his body language shifting forward in anticipation. He rarely saw Aaron this excited about going out, he was usually more of a stay at home type.
Harry’s legs pushed him back towards the cottage, each step faster than the last. What had he done? He ran until his lungs were burning and he tasted blood in his throat, he didn’t stop until he arrived at the steps of the house. Running inside and checking every room, yelling out Draco’s name in hopes of a response.
He turned his head and saw a man standing there confidently, he had almost forgotten he was in a gay bar.
Hearing the footsteps speed up behind him, he quickly turned into an empty alleyway, apparating to the first place he thought of.
He sort of felt like he owed it to Aaron to kiss him back, like it would be a way of consoling him in a time when Draco was left without option. He wanted so desperately to make him feel better that before he knew it, he was reciprocating the kiss that Aaron had initiated. This didn’t seem to make up for his hesitation a few moments later when he was asked, Do you feel the same way?
The first time that Harry had seen Draco since Hogwarts was at that very pub, a semi-awkward affair as he wasn’t aware that Draco was gay, and as far as he knew, Draco didn’t know Harry was either.
“Wowww so fancy! Just what I expected from pompous Draco Malfoyy” Harry exclaimed, slurring the end of his name.
He wasn’t sure what he was doing, when he saw Harry last week - for the first time since that New Years in Italy, he had chosen to hide behind a rack of clothes in an attempt to avoid conversation. Harry, of course, had spotted him which led to an even more awkward interaction. He threw the memory out of his mind and focused back onto the laminated menu.
“Now. Onto the matter at hand,” Marvin said as he sat down in his office chair. “I have an early Christmas gift for Draco and Harry.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes for the first time that night, the way that Harry was looking at him made him want to look away. The feeling was like someone was looking at him and really seeing him for once.
“Well. I suppose this is it then. Draco we will be in contact with you if there are any more advancements with the case, but I suppose most of them shouldn’t concern you.” Marvin stood and outreached his hand to Draco and he reluctantly shook it, turning around and walking out of the room as soon as they were finished.
While he was deep in self loathing thought, his back was warmed by the presence of a nearby body, the hairs on his arm and neck coming to a stand as he felt the warm breath coming out of Harry’s mouth. He swallowed hard as he continued to cook, not wanting to be the first to give into any advances.
“I am not always grumpy, just a little stressed out is all.” Harry protested, trying to keep a laugh from escaping his mouth, he couldn’t stop a smile from coming up on his face. He was glad he was facing away from Draco.
The days before Christmas melted together into a joyful array of comfortable Italian bliss, the two of them enjoying each other’s company and the serenity that they were so unfamiliar with.
The house itself was beautiful in every meaning of the word, there was dark green ivy scurrying up the old weathered stone of the home. The porch, accompanied with dark brown window frames, had a light auburn wicker dining set that, among the plethora of outdoor plants, blended into the stone. The building was picturesque and he thanked himself for letting Hermione find the house, he was sure if he had they would have ended up with an old and broken down brick house that he would have played off as ‘rustic’.
As he was checking out, he grabbed a few bottles of wine and two bottles of whiskey, knowing that with Draco and Ron’s drinking habits combined, he might even have to return for more before New Year’s. He picked up a small book that seemed rather plain in nature, but figured it would help to fill the space in between events over the week. The clerk eyed him suspiciously, probably wondering why he needed 7 bottles of alcohol at the crack of dawn, he laughed when he imagined what their perception of him must have been.
“I’ve got something for you.” Harry finally said, rising from his seat. Draco’s expression grew curious. Harry motioned for him to stay seated as he walked into his office. He unlocked a drawer by his table, reaching in for a red pack of cigarettes that he kept for “emergencies”. Which was pretty much just anytime he felt he needed one. He walked back into the living room with his hands behind his back, showing off the cigarettes once Draco looked. Draco’s eyes lit up and his mouth upturned into a smile, he ran up from his seat snatching the box from Harry’s hands and running over towards the balcony.
Draco managed to avoid Noah for the rest of the night, apart from in group settings. The night was now winding down and everyone was slowly dispersing. Marie and Oliver came over to Draco to say goodbye, and promised to call and write more often. They exchanged hugs and Oliver all but carried Marie home. The guy that he was dancing with earlier asked him to head home with him, but Draco wasn’t in the mood for once. Now that the high of the event was over, he was actually left feeling quite depressed. Before Noah could notice that he hadn’t gone yet and would corner him to talk to him, he stepped through a side door of the venue to smoke and be alone before heading home. He never really smoked sober but it was a nasty habit he had whenever he was drunk or high. He stepped out and pulled the cigarette box out of his pocket, turning the corner and finding Potter standing there, leaning against the wall. Normally, Draco would turn his ass around and leave as soon as he could, but Potter was better than Noah, and he really wanted to smoke. He leaned on the wall beside Potter, putting his cigarette between his lips and lighting it before taking a long drag. He could see Potter eye him from his peripheral vision, but chose to just close his eyes.
Draco sat back further in his seat, contemplating. “No.” Aaron’s chest lost some of its stiffness, his shoulders falling slightly.
“No thanks.” He said, grabbing another slice of cold pizza out of the box, trying to walk past Harry.
The last two weeks had gone by uneventfully, Draco had gotten closer to Harry than he thought possible, not that they knew much about each other or were even super open, but they were comfortable incorporating the other into their routine. Draco would get home after work and make them dinner, they would share stories about their day, sometimes they would sit in silence if one of them was in a worse mood than usual.
“Their time will come. Don’t think that Lucius will ever be forgotten by the Renovation, for someone who was in our Lord’s inner circle, he will be penalized greatly.” Romilda spit, her mouth turning up in a wicked smile, seething with revenge.
Harry stumbled into the club on his own, attempting to find Draco in the crowd but failing, stopping at the bar instead. The events of the day had taken a significant toll on him, leaving him tired and in pain, only wanting to numb whatever he was feeling and live in the shoes of someone else.
“Is that so?” Draco’s voice boomed, “So you didn’t know about my parents for months? You didn’t deliberately choose to keep that from me even after you saw how heartbroken I was?” Draco yelled out, his eyes now glossy.
They had come inside from another evening walk, drunk off their own laughter despite their bones aching from shivering in the cold. Draco had made dinner and they were now seated in the living room, soothing their bodies with the blissfully hot heat radiating off of the blazing fire. In another life, Harry could imagine the two of them living out the rest of their days together, stuck in a beautifully mundane routine of wine, and afternoon walks. But somehow, he felt that something was holding them back, he brushed the thought aside, making his way down onto the floor to lay down next to Draco, rolling onto his back to look at Draco’s face as he read.
Despite this, Draco attempted his niceties, offering the full breadth of his formal etiquettes to help with dinner and guide Hermione through her type A personality. Though after he was done they were left, once again, with nothing in common.
He had been sitting at the island in the kitchen for 20 minutes. Lathering himself in self loathing, reevaluating every selfish and hateful decision he had ever made. This made living with himself feel incredibly difficult. He was filled with so many emotions, ones that made his heart throb in anguish, ones he hadn’t allowed himself to feel out of self preservation. He walked over to the liquor cabinet, turning to alcohol once again to attempt to numb himself out.
They hadn’t touched each other at all, and even through that small connection, a flood of memories came back to him, how desperately his body was pulled towards his.
“Do you regret coming? I know it must have been weird with all the people from school.” Harry slurred, he was now significantly more drunk than he was earlier on the balcony, his inhibitions seemingly down.
The truth was, he didn’t. Draco wasn’t sure why he had decided against telling him, other than the fact that Aaron had a hatred for Harry, but he would be understanding if they had met up for one drink. Maybe he was worried that he would have something to apologize for.
Aaron nudged his shoulder, shooting his eyes to the side of the bar towards a man in a loose muscle tank with dark messy curls. Draco groaned as he caught sight of his intermittent roommate staring back at him from across the bar. Harry winked at him as he downed the rest of his drink, making his way closer to Aaron and Draco. His mind panicking at the sight, he swallowed his shot and hoped that Harry was simply walking back to the dance floor. He felt the pressure of another body near his back, the heat radiating off of Harry’s chest. He introduced himself to Aaron, who’s face had fallen significantly, even more than Draco’s.
“Not exactly..” Draco stumbled, avoiding eye contact in fear of Aaron reading right through him. Aaron had a perplexed look on his face, confused as to when the pure hatred for Potter had turned into something bearable.
“Alrightttt there, let’s get you to the couch, okay?” Harry led Draco carefully to the couch, careful to maintain the distance between them. Draco shut his eyes and flopped down. Harry took a seat across from him, crossing his legs. He was on his fourth glass of scotch, his face was feeling warm and he could feel his inhibitions falter.
“Don’t even get me started, you would not believe the weekend I’ve had” Draco sighed while dropping his head into his hands. Aaron was someone he truly felt he could confide in, maybe it's because Aaron also struggled with parents who were death eaters as a child and they could relate to each other through their trauma.
Perhaps he would take a vacation, it did feel awfully sad to try and go alone, but his need for escapism was immense and he didn’t know how he was supposed to continue on without some sort of hiatus from the troubles of his relatively mundane existence.
“I don’t know what else I would possibly do. Guess that's the problem really.” Draco met Potter’s gaze as it was coming up from staring at Draco. His eyes were darker green than he remembered, and they had a sad aging to them, he was sure that whatever Potter had to deal with since Hogwarts was not healthy for him. He stepped an inch closer to him, leaning his face slightly in. Harry glanced down at his lips and back up, staring further until clearing his throat and backing away.
“Merlin, don’t remind me. I am so embarrassed.” He groaned, rubbing his hands over his eyes to ease his discomfort.
“Oh fuck off Potter, I don’t need to be spending my time with a self righteous asshole who doesn’t give a crap about anyone else but himself.” Draco picked himself up and gathered his belongings, heading away from Potter, he was just going to spend his time at Aaron’s. He doubted Potter was dying to have him stay at his apartment anyway.
Aaron sympathized with him, always saying the right things and putting his hand on him for comfort. He wasn’t sure why but he hadn’t felt any sort of emotion about his apartment being raided, he knew that he should be afraid, or angry, but to be honest, he just felt exhausted.
They were going to a lunch bistro a few blocks away from his office, he snuggled his face into his scarf, attempting to hide his face from the wind. They had sat down near the back of the establishment, tucked away into a corner.
Harry gave an awkward wave, clearly slightly annoyed by the hitch in their plan to undress each other as quickly as possible.
“Alright Draco, here’s what's going to happen, considering that you can’t go back to your apartment during an active investigation, the Ministry is going to provide you with housing in the meantime. I’m not sure if it will be up to your standard of luxury, but it will have to do.”
The next morning Draco woke up earlier than usual to slip out of the apartment before Nick could wake up. He hated the sober small talk that came after a night of sex so it was best to avoid it all together. He got dressed in last night's clothes, his head filled with pressure that felt like the onset of a brutal headache. He walked out into the main living space of the apartment, actually taking it in for the first time. There was a mid-century modern style to the place, making Draco question how he could have slept with someone with so little taste. He shakes his head in disapproval as he pours himself a glass of water, searching for a piece of paper to write a brief goodbye on. He wrote a sloppy “Had fun last night xx” on a sticky note before tying up his shoes and stepping out the door.
Aaron knocked on the door, calling him out for the last shot before they headed out. Draco scurried to the door, kicking on a boot onto his foot. Aaron admired his pants on Draco’s frame, complimenting him on his appearance before leading him into the kitchen. They clicked their shot glasses together, before the burning liquid grazed the back of their throats. Draco had made a potion earlier in the night that allowed them to down the shots without the pungent aftertaste, which made drinking shitty alcohol much easier. They debated apparating to the club but decided to take a taxi instead, well, Aaron basically forced Draco too, concerned so as not to get dismembered on their way there.
“I think it's you that doesn’t talk to me anymore, Harry.” he spoke coldly, his gaze falling off of Harry.
I loved writing this chapter, especially the ending. How do you guys feel about Harry and Draco so far? Let me know your thoughts :))
“Oh. No, sorry, I’m here with my friend so…” Harry trailed off, having a hard time coming up with an excuse.
The first few weeks of their attempt at a relationship was perfect. At least in the eyes of Harry. He had been a coward, and he was now doing everything he could to prove to Draco that he was willing to make this work.
“I was asking if you wanted a glass of wine?” Harry says as he holds up a bottle of red wine suggestively.
Harry apologized, “What’re you making? I wouldn’t have taken you for one that would be into cooking”
It was now Christmas morning and the warm morning light was casting soft shadows over Harry’s face, Draco taking notice of this and staring longingly, relaxing in solitude in the moments before the brunette was going to wake. Draco thought about Harry’s gift in his bag, they had decided against getting each other anything big or too expensive, not wanting to place that pressure on their new (Draco couldn’t quite bring himself to say relationship due to Harry’s difficulty to commit) whatever it was, and opted for small trinkets that they thought the other would enjoy.
He felt someone run their hands across his body, he placed his hands on their chest, around their shoulders, through their hair, on their face.
Harry didn’t know how to respond, it was true that he did those things, and he didn’t honestly have an excuse other than he felt his loyalties lied with the Ministry.
“Alright, despite how much I am loving this, we will be decapitated by Hermione if she doesn’t show up to a fully decorated house for tonight. And although I am a grown man I am still very scared of her when faced with her wrath.” Harry said, giggling a little at the image of Hermione’s rage, her hair wild and standing on end, her face red with anger.
Harry nodded a solemn thank you, their shoulders brushing against each other as they headed towards the kitchen table. The dark auburn coloured wood of the table drastically contrasted against Draco’s pale skin as he sat down, hugging his hands around the mug in front of him, the warm ceramic of the cup warming his fingers.
Draco unbuttoned his shirt slightly as to give him more sex appeal, not like he needed it, he saw the looks that he was given by several of the men at the bar already. One of them had come up to him and offered to buy him a drink, he wasn’t exactly Draco’s type, but he wasn’t one to be picky at the moment.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s before bringing his chin forward, their lips grazing, Draco afraid to reciprocate.
“I think they liked you” Draco spoke softly, placing his hand back at his side but maintaining the close distance in between them. Harry stared into his eyes, his expression soft and longing.
“You should really stick to magic and not gift wrapping you know. This is horrendous.” Draco joked, laughing as he looked at all of the ragged edges on the present.
Placing the plates down onto the table, Draco flinched as he sat down on the chair, his ass feeling slightly bruised from his adventures from the night before. This caused a questioning look to form on Harry’s face, before one of realization, followed by a slight laugh.
"It was a date, Draco," Harry said quietly, and Draco felt his eyes grow wider. A date, between Granger and the Weasel—yes, all right, he should have seen that coming, especially with the way they'd been hanging all over each other during meals.
. Yesterday he cried over a stupid argument with a client. Today, it seems it's going to be Pansy's words that'll push him over the edge, and there's nothing he can do about it. It's so ludicrous he almost wants to laugh at himself, only then Pansy will be certain he's finally gone round the bend. "I'm just . . . I'm really, really tired. I can't—could we just do this some other time?"
“No need, I’ll go.” Draco nods, but then he remembers, “Did he give you his name? What am I supposed to call him?”
That it corrupts his soul, leaves it shy and scant, because emptiness will be the death of him when all this is gone, forever.
The moment she's done talking, the rest of them all launch into an endless speech about male pregnancies—". . . but there's been plenty of research in the past few years," one of them is saying. "What my colleague means to say," another one pipes up, "is that, should any complications arise, you can rest assured that we'll see them through with minimal fuss,"—and about all the things Draco can still do, and the ones he really, really shouldn't—"No drinking or smoking," one of the mediwitches chides, just as another one tells him, "But do try to eat lots of protein, and remember to exercise regularly."
Still, he feels endlessly thankful when Pansy walks in, and all in all, quite proud of himself for not having throttled Potter when he had the chance.
, but he means that too. It’s almost a miracle this whole conversation is tumblingly moving forwards when he can’t—
Draco's fists clench helplessly by his sides. He suddenly feels very, very small. "It's not like that. It's not—" he tries. He can't force out the words. They never make it past his lips, they
"Maybe," Potter said, "I don't know." His feet were barely inches from Draco's own. "I hope they do."
Now he's not so sure anymore. For a moment there, he's torn between feeling wrecked and elated, because surely this must mean Potter cared about him back then, that he cared about Draco at least a little—only that was then and . . . this is now, and now Potter is accusing him of breaking things off as if Draco had done that on purpose, as if Draco had
"No! I miss you." Potter steps closer and captures Draco's hand in his. He puts a kiss there, right on Draco's fingers. "I'm asking you to come back
Draco blinked, looking down at where Harry's fingers were pulling at his jumper. They were stretching the sleeve over his hand, and just a few months ago Draco would have punched him for that. He was momentarily puzzled by how comfortable they'd become around each other, and that was probably the reason why all Draco managed to say was, "You must be mental."
Draco has dinner that night, his body finally remembering about real food, missed lunches taken through spells at St. Mungo’s. Once that’s done, he calls Pansy through the Floo. After serenely—as if—listening to her, “Where the hell are you?” and her over-the-top, gasp included, “I thought you were…”
"You bloody impossible ponce," Harry says between hard kisses, "of course you'd be worried about your stupid hair."
Draco nods. "I can be there at seven," he says, before bidding Potter goodbye and ending the call. He can hear Pansy tapping her foot by the door.
“You lot—” A moan. “You have—not a bit of integrity, do you?” There’s a ragged breath behind him. Miller thrusts back in, hard, really hard. It kind of hurts. “Bloody… Malfoy.”
Draco concentrates on breathing, swallows a couple of times, and by then Potter is taking a step back.
It’s just a shame his partner was also someone who walked out on him twice, and then stood outside for half a year all while the papers published tons of fake articles, most of them over Draco’s interference in his life, all of them leaving Draco not in a very good place. Someone who had him Obliviated and then had himself Obliviated, too, for good measure, and also someone who came back for his son almost two months after he was born.
about it—the guilt he’s not feeling will crush him but, Merlin’s saggy balls, he’ll die in joy if this all works. “He was all I had. Most days he was quite—”
"I figured I would eventually." Draco shrugs. "Most likely after the baby is born. I don't actually speak good enough Italian to find a decent job here."
Draco is doing up the buttons on his shirt. He’s kind of marveling he fucked Potter over the couch. Now,
"Why would I do that?" Draco asks, puzzled, only just then something clicks in his mind. The realisation feels like a slap to the face: Potter isn't here because he wants him, he's here because he'd like to be present in his child's life. Draco's eyes narrow, and something that might have been hurt curls through his chest. "Is this because I'm pregnant with your child?"
“Quite often,” Potter says. His breath comes in shallow gasps. He looks thoroughly unhinged, his hands still resting on Draco’s hips, his thumbs unconsciously rubbing small circles into his sides.
“Wait.” Draco watched her as she looked through the pages. “There’s people in the background here…” She shook the passport, midair; then, she stared at him, her face a puzzle of confusion. “I don’t get it. How come they won’t move?”
Long after she leaves, Draco looks at his own image on the old mirror in his room. Places careful hands on his stomach, their light touch trailing over it until his fingers touch each other in the middle. It can’t be. But it is. When did he bond to Potter?
“Absolutely.” Indeed, he’s rather certain now he’s bonded to Potter. Not that he had any doubt before, given the pregnancy. “You know what I remember now, too? That no one ever asked
"That's all right, it doesn't have to be right now," Potter says quickly. "Just . . . give me your address and I'll Floo you?"
Draco's heart aches miserably with the looming threat of estrangement, and this time it's real. And when the girl Weasel slips a hand around Harry's waist, something caustic tries to claw through Draco's chest.
The mere idea makes Draco want to laugh a bit hysterically, because yes, Potter certainly travels all over the place.
"It's a nice film," Harry said, "well, Hermione said so anyway. She and Ron went to watch it last week, during the . . . well, when they were supposed to be in Hogsmeade."
“Merlin, Pans,” he snaps, pushing her off his lap. “It’s not—I don’t do that, all right? I swear some days you are unbearable…”
“Good evening,” Draco says, taking in the wide shoulders and Miller’s face, wrinkled around the eyes like an old jacket. Well, at least now he can say he’s sure of three things, the first one being that Miller overtly doubles him in age, and the second one that he doesn’t look too amiable towards him. He’s thinking the third one might be that he’s not one of those people where one can say, ‘Yes, I think he’s aged quite gracefully’, while not feeling like a complete con artist. He’s wearing a Muggle shirt, like Draco, only his looks quite a bit more expensive. Draco’s guess is he might work in finance, commercial banking or something like that. Pansy was right though, both him and his place look rather well-to-do.
He’s so done. Potter will kick him out, won’t he? He’ll have to go back to his life before and that won’t be good, it wouldn’t have been good before, but now he has a tiny tiny human growing inside him and he’s not supposed to take Polyjuice, at least that’s what mediwizards said. And what if… what if Miller number two is waiting around the corner?
Potter mutters something he can’t quite get, though it rather sounds like ‘in exchange for sex’, and Draco’s quite sure the last part includes ‘bloody tosser’. Then, Potter takes off his glasses, and rubs his nose.
called him a liar. Instead, he summons a glass of water from the kitchen. He fetches a blanket from the bedroom to wrap around Draco's shoulders, he
Draco’s jaw tightens. He looks down at the photograph again. Potter, suffering from wet hair—duh, likely he forgot there’s a spell to prevent that—on top of his generally irritable nature. He looks grudgingly grateful at Granger for an instant there, all while he manages to sneak behind her into the magical creatures shelter. Granger stays where she is, her wand pointed at whoever took the picture. Then the photograph restarts. Something aches in Draco’s chest, he’s not sure what. Perhaps he’s coming down with something? He rather hopes it’s that, and not a heart strike.
Potter walked up to his bed, sitting down next to Draco. "No, I don't think it is," he said wistfully. "I think I'd like to go, someday."
“It was dangerous, Draco. There was a war going on.” And now the war is over and it’s all good. He can tell that’s what Potter thinks. But there are different ways of good: there is crazy good and nice good, there’s even weirdly good. And then there’s this here, between them, which is not even
Draco bites his lip. He thinks about his family, about Mother, sent to Azkaban after the war. Yes, all right, it’s not what Potter means, but he thinks he quite gets it. Weasel’s sister must as well: she was there too, she fought the Dark Lord’s army during the final battle. “I’m quite sure she cares too.”
That’s when Draco realises he’s been staring at him for quite a while. “It’s…” He clears his throat, as quietly as he can. “Yeah, it is. A bit.”
Except he can’t help wanking like mad that night, after putting Scorpius to bed. He wanks miserably, hopelessly, desperately, all while trying to convince himself that the dark haired lad in his mind is
“Remember what, Pans?” Draco tries, his world is crumbling around him, falling down in a turmoil he doesn’t know how to stop.
"No, you couldn't," Draco retorts. "He used to make terrible jokes about Muggle things I never understood, you know? And I still
"Well," Potter's voice comes over Draco's shoulder, "good to know you're still alive. To be honest, I was beginning to doubt it."
Draco smiled, letting his eyes fall shut as Harry's fingers ran softly through his hair. He had no idea why Harry had taken to doing this, but it felt absolutely brilliant, even though it did make Draco want him more. He stood no chance there anyway. As far as he knew, Harry wasn't even into blokes.
. Merlin, he can’t say that. It sounds pathetic. Besides, it’s not like it’s going to stop him, is it?
It's not as if Draco needs the money after all—despite all the fines and sanctions and reparations he's had to pay since the war, the Malfoy coffers are still comfortably full. The shop is just something for him to do, and right now, he doesn't feel like doing it. So he turns over and goes back to sleep.
“You knew all along,” he said. It wasn’t an accusation, though it should have been. It wasn’t a preconception, though it could have been, had he not gotten to know her quite a bit in the past few months. It was merely a supposition based on facts, facts presented.
of all things, his patience, as if he had any—and Draco has been forced to sit through a long sermon on work ethics from his boss, he's finally on the way back to his lab.
They've met for drinks a few times by now. They've talked about their jobs, Potter's new owl—who's apparently a bit of a menace—and their friends, and it's been shockingly pleasant. Pleasant enough that they've kept agreeing to do this.
“I got a Floo call from Wright while you were gone,” Pansy tells him when he gets home. “He wanted to set a date. I didn’t know what to tell him.”
"It's not like that." Draco's eyes cut away from hers, resting on his hands instead. "We're not actually together. We merely—we have an arrangement of sorts."
"It's my fault," Potter says quietly, and Draco moves still closer to the door, pressing his face against it in an effort to hear better—he wishes he had an Extendable Ear, but sadly, this is the best he can do. "It's all my bloody fault."
“I’m so sane,” Harry told the mirror, because somehow Ginny had now become a ghost too. Apparently. At least according to Hermione, she’d fallen off her broom during a Quidditch match.
"Yeah. But, er, perhaps you'll like this one better?" Potter gives him a hesitant smile. It's a bit off-putting, Draco thinks, to realise the lower half of his face is trying to mirror the expression. He should be cross at Potter. He
A flash of light and a small cry is all the warning he gets before Harry races forwards, before spells start flying all around them and Draco is forced to leave cover or leave Harry on his own—and he can't do that, he could never do that.
. He looks down at his watch. Far past one. Looks again—past one-thirty. He tries quite hard not to look back at it, pouting as the place empties. It’s getting late and Potter’s not there, Potter’s not showing up, and why indeed is Potter not showing up? He’s literally pacing up and down by the time Potter arrives… flanked by Granger and Weaselbee, of course.
Draco raises his eyebrows, because right, sure, he can do that, and it’s not as if he’s contemplating that all of this is going too fast. Perhaps he’d be, he reckons, if he were really new at this, but he isn’t. Then he guesses he can add a fourth point to his list because, clearly, this bloke here seems to love commanding people around. Unfortunately, Draco happens to be not too fond of them commanding blokes, and by now he’s kind of wishing Pansy has tripled his bill, no matter how unlikely it seems to be. Still, he steps out of his shoes and takes his jacket off.
Draco nods, ignoring the burning sensation behind his eyes. He knows this won't last forever, but he can't help wishing . . . Merlin, he used to be so good at hiding behind a mask, but these days it's as if he's this giant ball of hormones and mood swings, and it's so bloody tiresome, and he feels
And when Harry kisses him, not strong but deep, Draco makes a soft humming sound. His whole world suddenly feels better, determined, resolute… all those things he’s never managed to reach himself before.
“Are you, you know, happy…” Draco swallows. Somehow saying that word brings up a huge pang of hurt inside him, as if his own heart were bruised and bleeding, and he doesn’t know why or how it’s happening, but it
But somehow, as days go by, he’s less and less convinced by his own mind. Perhaps he should get a new one, clearly the one he owns is broken.
Draco thinks they have all day, and this is amazing, and why not? It must be the moment’s fault, or perhaps that Draco is literally crazy about him, or perhaps the fact that he’s done in when pleasure is all, and there’s no better, because he hears himself saying, “I’m pregnant.”
"Their art would be painted by Muggles," Draco points out, "they've never been particularly fond of magic."
They'd have to follow the ringleader of a potions' smuggling operation all through London. Tailing people would turn out to be incredibly boring work: lots of sitting around in the dark, with nothing to do but watch and wait; lots and lots of free time that Draco would gleefully fill by, among other things, ogling Harry's delectable arse.
“Not really, no.” He’d always assumed he’d told her cocks made his world go round, or something like that. But what if he hadn’t. What if that was not what he said, what if…
“Er, no. No.” Potter holds his hands in front of him as he walks backwards towards the door. “Thanks, but no thanks.”
Pansy doesn’t respond right way, fixing Draco with one of her knowing looks. “You know…” She pauses, humming to herself. “I think you should,” she adds, while reaching out to grab the
"She's in there right now," Potter said, pointing vaguely towards the office at the end of the infirmary. "Talking to McGonagall, I guess."
Then again, Draco had also been expecting Weaselette to be mad at him, and yet she doesn’t seem to be. “It was never meant to work,” she tells him when she drops by to leave some of Harry’s clothes. Harry, it seems, left absolutely everything behind. “He wanted a family. If I’m honest, I think I’ve had enough of that to last me several lifetimes.”
Draco crumples his nose and concludes, “Yes, well. I don’t think you are there yet.” Maybe at some point Potter will go along with his suggestions and start looking like a normal person. “We might get you there at some point.”
"Shh," she shushes him, lying next to him on the bed. "It's okay. You'll get over this," she whispers, "you'll move on."
He wonders if he'd have gone about things differently, if he'd known back then he'd end up up the duff. He could have cast protection charms, he guesses—and he
He pulls Potter closer, makes the kiss deeper. He can feel the hard shape of Potter's cock where it's pressed against his thigh, and Draco pushes his palm against it and swallows Potter's moan when it comes—Potter's cock is thick and hot against his hand, so hot even through layers of clothing.
Is there a single reporter left with an imagination, or has all of journalism devolved into one giant Rita Skeeter exposé?
together for a while, if you know what I mean. She suggested getting a divorce months ago, I was just… look, I don’t know. Letting it wait, I reckon.” He seems wary and uncomfortable, but at least he’s here, and he’s talking to Draco, and there’s no raised voices, no threats. No spells have been thrown yet—Draco is quite glad, with the way his magic is working (or rather
Potter turns around. A forceful kiss, just what Draco kept wanting for the past two months. Somehow it feels oddly familiar, like they’ve done this before, though Draco can’t recall when exactly since they’ve always been enemies. Even if Draco sometimes thinks he’d have liked things to go differently between them, if only Potter had said ‘Hello’ that day, back on first year…
"I found this in your kitchen last week," Potter says, placing the vial down on the table between them, "right behind your can of Prince of Wales. It was Disillusioned. I would never have found it, except I knocked it over and then heard the noise when it fell off the counter."
Draco takes a step back. He's too tired for this. He's so tired of dealing with Harry, and he can always leave through the Floo room in the floor below. When he gets home though, there's a tiny owl waiting by the window; it's carrying one of those small flat disks Muggles make, titled
Pansy Side-Alongs him to St Mungo's as soon as he's finished his tea, and he sits through test after test feeling like a rookie seer in the Department of Mysteries. The mediwizards tell him to stand still and he does, and when they tell him to hold up his shirt and lie back, he does that as well.
“At last!” Pansy says when he gets home, her concerns blatantly evident in her gaze. “What on Earth happened to you?”
Sometimes he’s afraid that Potter will rethink what they are doing here, starting a family. He’s quite scared he might send him home, carry on with his life alone. It’s pointless, it’s stupid, but Draco’s thoughts often trail over that corner. He can’t help it. He’s hoping not, mostly because he feels complete now, as he’s longed to be for years, and he’s not giving this up again. Not unless he has to.
He waits for Harry to push him off. To tell him he doesn't want this. To call him a freak, a poof, a
comes. Draco has to admit his petty thoughts have turned softer lately. He’s not sure why, but some days he catches himself thinking Potter does have some charm after all, that he may have been drawn in by it. Who knows?
Draco snorts. "Oh, no. He's brilliant all right." And that's really as much as he plans to say about it—Pansy looks satisfied enough, and she doesn't need to know how Draco's back arched desperately against the mattress as he came down Potter's throat, or how Potter's hands pressed down on his hips hard enough to leave bruises.
"Excuse me?" Potter halted his pacing to give Draco a look of such disbelief that, bloody hell, Draco really wanted to break his nose again. It had been quite relaxing the first time around, and besides, perhaps it'd make the pounding in his head grow quieter. Admittedly, it seemed far-fetched, but it wasn't as if he'd know unless he tried it. "How is any of this in any way my fault?"
His feet must have carried him back to the common room at some point. He knows this because Pansy was still there, thrilled and expectant with her 'Well?' and her questions, and Draco is not exactly sure what his answers were. All he knows is they made her roll her eyes.
Draco laughs sharply. Only then he thinks about Potter and his girlfriend who Draco's never met. He thinks about them going on a holiday together and eating croissants for breakfast in their hotel bed, peeling themselves out of their sheets and shaking the stress off over coffee.
It goes on and on, until Draco can do nothing but push back against his tongue, because it feels wonderful, and he’s so gone, thoughts are not. All he hears is himself whimpering, needy and wanting, his mind a gale of bliss and wish and
He is just going to have to do with that. So he inhales, gets up, and follows Potter to the bathroom.
It's probably just his luck that he's in the process of getting fairly intimately acquainted with his loo the next time Potter shows up.
It almost makes him want to laugh. And yet here he stands, bonded to Potter, and Potter can’t even see that: that Draco wouldn’t leave even if it were possible, that he’s trapped here and doesn’t want out because Potter means too much, and he has too little to hold on to…
Draco wouldn't have lurched awake in the middle of the Hospital Wing, with a mouth that tasted as if he'd swallowed a bucket of Thestral piss and a banging headache right between the eyes. As though he'd taken a particularly ill-tempered Bludger to the head.
In the end, it turns out it’s all rather pointless. It’s not like he manages to find Potter that day, despite his constant rushing into the nearest loo whenever Polyjuice threatens to vanish from his bloodstream. He doesn’t find him during the next one either, or even the day following that one. It basically feels like a great waste of (illegally obtained; ta Pans dearest) potion on a chore already failed. Especially since, in three full days, he still has no clue where Potter is. Not even after visiting every single place where the
Potter freezes, hovering above him, but then he exhales slowly and lets himself fall back down. "I was just going to fetch my wand," he says softly. "I'm not going anywhere, I promise. To be honest—" Potter smiles a sad little smile, "—I don't think I ever knew how to forget you either."
Meanwhile, Miller leans back into the soft leather of the couch he’s sitting on, crosses his legs and waits. Waits for Draco to be naked, surely, at least if the stare he’s giving him is anything to go by, watching as cloth by cloth removed leaves Draco’s body on display for him.
(It’s not Potter, damn him. He’s not masturbating to Potter. It’s rather weird how that idea just won’t stick to his mind. He thinks for a moment there that he might have been right before, while going Zen on Pans: must buy a new brain soon, the one he owns now seems to be failing miserably. Especially at this whole ‘coping with reality’ part of it.)
Merlin, Potter, swearing on Muggle gods, are you? Draco judges, like the judgy critic he used to be. Only, for a moment he recalls Miller’s stare and shivers, because he’s no longer that, and now he seems closer to be the aim more than the referee.
It was only after he'd pushed the door open to go back to their room that he realised Harry hadn't been standing just outside. Harry was still sleeping, tucked into bed. The bond would never have allowed that—they had about ten feet, that was as far as they could ever walk from each other. Ten feet.
“No, you only get to see him while I’m working and you’re not, and no one else can stay with him. That is the deal, as per the agreement with your signature on it.”
mate. And you came back with—” insert accusatory finger pointing at Draco, “—that thing standing over there,” moments.
If only he could turn back time, Draco would curse himself a hundred times that day. He'd delete it from existence. Possibly curse the Firewhisky as well, just to be safe; after all, he's pretty sure that particular revelation would never have made it past his lips without it.
. But then thinks better of it. There's no way he'll ever be rid of Potter if he keeps answering, so he crumples the parchment instead before setting it on fire. He sends the owl away. He spends the rest of his afternoon trying to drink himself silly.
Draco can't remember ever being this hard, not even that day back at Hogwarts, when they'd fucked on Draco's bed. He's desperate. He's writhing beneath Potter, breathing hard as Potter adds a second finger, slowly moving them back and forth.
. Potter, who’s heating up some baby milk for Scorpius, glances at him for a second. “Impressed by what?”
He watches Potter's face vanish into the green flames of his fireplace before falling back on his couch.
Instead, Draco stands up straighter, and schools his features perfectly blank; Granger looks at him a bit too knowingly, but thankfully doesn't comment.
seems to be holding a grudge against me. I mean look at this,” he says, pointing towards the paper’s cover.
“Let’s meet up then, huh?” It was kind of hilarious how Malfoy’s mouth got stuck between a ‘What’ and a ‘Huh’. “Don’t worry,” Harry said, “you’ll get it later, likely when I come pick you up,” and winked at him on the way out.
“Oh, I did notice. But that’s his problem, not yours.” She leans back comfortably on her chair. He pictures her carefully examining her nails again. Alas, it doesn’t happen, she just says, “Most of your clients are married anyway.”
“So that’s how it is in Muggle's programming,” Hermione was saying on the way back to the Ministry. “Basically, you spell something, anything, wrong, and the whole thing stops working until you find
Potter tends to drop by mid-afternoon, when he leaves his job. The first few times he brings food and some shopping. However, upon Draco’s complaints, he starts bringing the
"Don't go," Draco says, grabbing Potter's arm when Potter pushes himself up. "I just—I don't think I could let you leave again," he adds quickly, and he feels so stupid once the words are out, so very stupid. He's revealed more about himself in one afternoon than in several months bonded together.
Draco opens his mouth and goes down, all the way down. There’s a little sound from Potter he thinks he’s heard before, all small and desperate. It’s kind of exciting. Draco can’t remember the last time he listened so hard, or was so keen on others reactions. He never felt like this with his dates, but this is different. This here… this
Draco licks his lips, leaves them half-open because he can, because he wants to see what it does to Potter. Relief rushes through him when Potter swallows and looks away. Perhaps Pans was right about him. Perhaps he is into Draco, perhaps Draco can sway him. Perhaps, just perhaps, Potter is actually interested on that whole swaying thing, as long as Draco is the one doing the swaying. Wouldn’t that be nice? And easy, too; Draco by now knows quite a bit how all that works and whatnot. Plus, he wouldn’t be too opposed.
Harry grins, likely in response to the blatant shock on Draco’s face. “Indeed, I could have. Like, I’m quite shocked you’re not dancing the jitterbug all over the kitchen.”
“Besides, he’s married.” Draco closes and folds the paper, puts it on the table and points down at the cover headline:
"I know that, I just wish—" Draco drags the fork around on his plate. "I wasn't running away either." Only perhaps he was. "He didn't even believe me when I told him it was his child, did I tell you that? I needed . . ." So many things. He needed to build his own life, for one, but he also—
breakfast. No, it’s turned into more of a late brunch, as most of his days start past midday. Apparently, he’s an ‘escort’ now. A job he absolutely hates, but at the very least he’s not alone. Alongside him is his BFF Pansy, whom he sometimes loves… but most days he truly, madly, deeply loathes and despises.
“I had more important things in mind,” Draco replies curtly. He wasn’t sure if he would live through the ordeal, let alone be set free. The lands and accounts left to him were as good as seized once his father was removed from the picture. Granted, there was enough to pay the settlement, but barely so. “Just to shut your trap,
"Yeah. And healing . . . well, it's a way to restore some of the damage the war has done," Potter replied. "Not that it matters now. I mean, it's not like I could go to training while we're still—" he gestured awkwardly between them, "—you know."
Pansy picks up his calls, as usual—because she’s good at sounding normal, she’s great at it. Because she doesn’t have the mark. She might be hated, but no one wants her dead. And isn’t that fab? Because she might have messed up a bit, but not all the way.
By the time Draco's second work week rolls around, he's pretty much convinced he knows everything there is to know about working with Harry Potter—namely, that working in the same building as Potter is a veritable nightmare, and that this version of Potter quite possibly thinks that Draco is his own personal potions expert.
For a bizarre moment, this whole thing reminds him of the way his first time with Potter went. Fleeting, uncertain but certain, because he knew how all would go before it happened. He even remembers what he thought then, that there was something missing, and he didn’t know what exactly. Potter does matter to him, but sometimes he feels like perhaps he mattered before, too, and that he can’t remember how or why. It’s
Potter's jaw tightens. "Right. And I should just believe that, even though I've never actually tried that particular—"
Eventually, Potter grows tired of avoiding Draco and goes back to Draco's lab. He sits near the back of the room, talking to himself as Draco works,
"I know she'd look after you, you great twat, and it's not as though she'd force you into a marriage you don't want. You can always say no," Pansy says, throwing her hands up. "Your life, your choices."
“Oh! Don’t worry, I was just talking to myself,” she says, smiling a smile much much faker than the one stuck to Draco’s face all through dinner. “Say, clean plates, where should I place them?”
, bloody hell, to Potter of all people. From his child waking him up every two hours, from a long eve spent trying to feed Scorpius who wouldn’t eat, and an endless morning spent at work, serving others plates he can’t even afford on the misery salary he’s paid for his part-time job. Sometimes he catches himself thinking they could have been spent at Potter’s, all those days. He misses sleeping with him. He misses his arms, wrapped around his waist as they both gave in and called it a night. He’s just so wound up by all that, he actually falls for it at first. Potter’s lips are soft and tender against his. Just as wonderful, perhaps even better than he remembers them. His mouth parts a tiny bit. Only, then he recalls this is not supposed to happen. This here is what he’s been avoiding. It needs to stop
Draco’s head snaps up. “I can’t be,” he whispers. His muscles tense up so fast he has to let go of the magazine he’s holding. He shoves his hands under his armpits, to hide the shaking in them because, “I can’t be, I’d have to be bonded for that to—”
There’s a snort. More thrusting. Draco can’t breathe with his head held down. He can’t do anything, held in place by Miller’s hands holding his own behind his back. But he’s right. Once upon a time, Draco might have said something to uphold his honour, but his honour is gone. He’s nothing but a whore. Nothing is carved in stone, he has no shield against his anger but his own shame and he’s not stupid. He knows he’s just a concept to them—to Miller—and not a person. An idea to condemn. Something to censure. He has the mark on his wrist. Draco hates it too, likely as much as they do; he loathes everything it stands for, everything it involves. If only it could be removed, Merlin, he’d give his whole world for that, but… but they—
"You weren't at work, okay? I thought," she starts, taking an unsteady breath at the end. "You haven't taken a single holiday since you opened it, and when I got here you were so still and I—"
Pansy keeps staring at him for several long seconds, she stares at him until his chest stops rising and falling, until nothing in him is moving at all. “It doesn’t matter.” She gets up. “Just don’t lose this. Try, for Merlin’s sake,
Their wands are cold against his skin, and their magic makes Draco's nerves twist and quiver in a way that feels both ticklish and unfriendly—
at exactly the right pace. What truly amazes Draco is that it’s not the last time. What starts with a blow job in the sitting room, soon moves into shagging in the kitchen. Potter bending him over a table, Potter’s tongue doing things down there—marvellous things, mind you, but still things down there, things a supposedly heterosexual Gryffindor might not be too proud of doing if the
In a rush, Draco shuts his laptop and hides it under the bed. Doesn’t want Potter to see it, wouldn’t like the questions that would come with it. Potter still thinks he’s like he was, explaining to him that Muggles are perhaps higher up the line than he’d once thought might take recognising a few things he’s not too proud of. He stops by the kitchen on his way to the sitting room and grabs a couple of glasses.
“Yes, I know. Because yesterday was Sunday.” Gosh, seriously? How many more times was he going to have to put up with this?
"Only now you claim you're not bothered by him going off in what's likely a romantic getaway with this girl," she states.
Draco swallowed. Not Fenrir, please. He knows what he does to children. Draco might have been sixteen, but… but in that moment, he wasn’t feeling so grown up anymore.
—about this by now. Even though Draco really isn't. Because he promised Potter he wouldn't say a word.
Draco’s mouth curls into a slight grin. “We”—and that ‘we’ there feels like they’ve established something, like they’re a couple now, like Harry
He’s actually bothered to look good this morning, wore his best clothes and everything. Yes, okay, he’s perfectly aware that it’s not exactly one of those truly expensive suits Muggles watch famous people wearing, on those tee-vee shows they have. He knows that, okay? He also knows Desmond Merrion isn’t amongst the list of designers, that it’s a suit likely made in some lost country off to the East, designed by who-knows-whom up North, and sold for a hundred quid in the nearest H&M. But at least it’s a suit. He looks good in it, and he knows he does, and anyway, it’s not like he could afford better.
At least until Potter grabs his cock, and doesn’t let him get there. They fuck, afterwards, and then they go upstairs and do it again.
Amazingly, after a few, “Oh, you posh little bastard,” Weasel actually takes them, all along with an odd look, and never ever saying thank you. Or even apologising for having been such a wanker.
Then, she steals one of his carrot sticks, munching unashamedly in front of him. The massive prat. Draco watches her, eyes narrowed. Is she up to something? Because it seems she is, but he’s not sure what exactly.
"Shut up!" Draco screams. His breathing is coming hard, sticking in his throat and burning in his lungs, and Potter is so close to him—so close Draco can feel his body heat on his skin, close enough that he can feel Potter's breath against his face,
(The Dark Lord was right, evil does trump goodness. The Dark Lord was right, he always was: Draco is useless. Useless, worthless and a waste of space. Just as he said when Draco failed, just as he said when Draco ran and ran and couldn’t escape.)
"Right. Well, I guess that's one less thing we'll have to worry about now," Harry said, but his smile looked a lot like a grimace, and Draco didn't know what to do to make that go away.
"I fucked up," Potter says. He sounds distressed. "I fucked up badly, I was just so angry at him all the time and now—now he's leaving."
Draco buys treacle tart before going home, just as he does every Friday. He puts a stasis charm on it and leaves it on his coffee table, then pours himself a glass of wine and sits on his couch to wait. At exactly ten minutes to eight, Harry stumbles through his Floo.
By sixth year, the dreams became different—they increased in intensity to match the growing fear and desperation in Draco's life. They'd meet in darkened classrooms then, in hidden alcoves, and Harry would place a gentle hand on Draco's lower back as he whispered, "You can change sides, you know," in his ear. Draco's muscles would tighten almost painfully under his skin, and he'd flush a little when Harry leant in closer to catch his eyes.
Pansy however, has no intentions of relenting, pinning him with her trademark smirk. “Not a chance.”
He lets his head thunk back against the wall. It hurts, but not at badly as the shattered remains of his soul, so Draco reckons he should probably welcome it.
. She knows how Potter makes him feel, she knows he's been trying to get over this, but she's still given Potter the chance to drop by Draco's shop whenever he wants to.
The worst part is that he sort of knew it, and this is what he gets for not trusting his flipping hunches.
Shockingly enough, life has been going pretty well for Draco since he left his position at St Mungo's. He's been working at Slug & Jiggers Apothecary for almost two months now, and he's quite happy with the job he's been doing. His boss seems fairly unbiased when it comes to the part Draco played in the war, even going as far as stepping in for him when any of his clients give him a hard time.
“What do you know, there’s truth to some clichés,” Potter says. Then, he gives Draco a long look. “What happened to you?”
“He’s paying for a full night, too. It’s quite a bit of quid,” Pans says, hope shining in her voice as she gives a tight little smile. Draco can see the implicit meaning behind it.
"Er, I don't really . . ." Draco looks at Potter. He's still wearing his lime-coloured scrubs, though judging by the time it is, he must have been on his way home. His hair is tousled, falling artlessly around his face, and yet he still looks just as gorgeous as he always has in Draco's mind. "Pansy told me you were working here now."
Draco doesn't, not that week. Though he does ask eventually and receives a variety of answers, some of them easier to believe than others. He guesses they were built to show off, that every well off family in town built their own tower, that they work as a symbol of power of sorts—or at least worked as one, in the past.
Not even when Draco drags him over to Regulus’ bedroom and has his fun there, with his conjured ropes that, for some odd reason, Potter trusts and at last,
"You don't know?" Potter asks, running behind him. "Draco, wait for me, for fuck's sake! What do you mean you don't know?"
"I thought—when I heard them talking, I thought Potter and you . . . that you might be together now."
"But you can't know that, can you?" Potter's features harden. "You can't know it's mine. It could be anyone's baby in there, and the only reason you're telling me now is because you want something from me. Just like everyone else."
When Potter isn’t there, Draco often wanders around the house. He’s been cleaning up a bit, though he has to admit Kreacher has done most of it. Kreacher, on his side, seems to adore Draco for some odd reason that eludes him. In any case, indolence equals joy in Draco’s mind these days, equals plenty of time to do other things he likes, and no time at all to do what he doesn’t. So, frankly, he’s more than glad to let Kreacher work. Who knows? Perhaps working is his thing. He really doesn’t look too joyful when he’s not bowing and bowing, and saying
He can’t find it in him to do anything, not even watching videos on YouTube, especially when he can’t even sleep at night while
, considering everyone else has left. And he’s gone over this: he’s been practising at home, he can do it. Sure, the toilet may not be the sexiest place when picking out a place to flirt, but it is at least a place, isn’t it?
“Good. That’s…” Potter says, his eyes pausing minutely at Draco’s lips, with a hint of something that looks a tiny bit like attraction. Could it be? Draco wonders. Is Potter actually attracted to him? “That’s… that’s good.”
He clenches his fists and determinedly pushes it back down. But Salazar, he hates himself more than ever.
opinion on having my memory set to zero on anything that concerned our relationship. I can assure you, ‘Yes, please, go ahead’ wouldn’t have been my first answer.”
is being cast, mostly because Potter must have said something funny while Draco was lost in thoughts. And, at least this way, no explanations are required.
A stroke of luck, Draco thinks, that thing he lacks. He can hardly believe it. So he ponders and ponders, breathes in and breathes out, and concludes… well, nothing particularly relevant, except that he probably should follow Potter. It’s pretty much the dumbest conclusion he’s ever reached in his whole life, but it kind of, sort of makes sense? It’s not like it’s going to get any better than this, and at least he knows Potter is alone in there—which is really not
. “I’m really, really sorry. I didn’t mean to,” but he did. “You just assumed,” and Draco fed it gladly. “I’m sorry,” and he truly is. “Harry, please wait.”
“Are you deaf or are you dense? On your hands and knees. I imagine you know how it’s done, don’t you?”
He could fall asleep in a heartbeat, and it occurs to him that perhaps Pansy is right after all. Perhaps he really is sick. He's so drained it doesn't even feel
Harry would sit across from him, sneaking glances at Draco out of the corner of his eye—probably under the impression that he was the paragon of subtlety. He'd shift uncomfortably in his seat whenever Draco talked, and eventually excuse himself to go to the loo.
Eventually, he decided not to. The baby came first. And anyway, Potter was the one who needed to apologise here. Draco had already apologised too much, definitely too often. Obliviating them both wasn’t exactly Draco’s idea, which means Potter here, isn’t exactly quite as guiltless as he has everyone believe he is. Rather the opposite. He might even be the reason Draco ended up as an escort.
Narcissa Floos before the week is over. She talks excitedly about her life in their Tuscany villa before pausing to give Draco a thoughtful look. "So when will the wedding be? I'll be applying for a dispensation to attend, of course. Surely even those vacuous, irredeemably lazy good-for-nothings—"
Their kiss turn sloppy, fiery and stormy. Potter slides a hand up Draco’s t-shirt, meeting flesh with his palm, gliding his nails across Draco’s rib cage in a way that feels somewhere between marvellous and heart-stopping.
He looks like one of the Furies, intense and stalwart in his might, and all Draco can do is kiss him. He surges forward and kisses him, and Harry's mouth parts for him as if it were that easy. As if there were no thought behind it, no real alternative. And it's just as hot and gentle as it's always been in Draco's dreams.
Are those… bones shattering? Merlin, he really doesn’t want to look, but he sees Fenrir’s eyes fixate on him and…
Harry alternates between grunting and snarling at him, and Draco is afraid he might have torn a permanent gash in his tongue from biting down on it so often. It's frustrating, and from the outside they must look laughable—or pitiable, depending on the day—but still, it works. They're both apparently good enough at this job for communication to become secondary.
Harry will lean in to kiss him, and it'll be nothing like the dreams—it'll be awkward, and somewhat uncoordinated, and Harry will laugh at him as their noses bump against each other. But it'll still be sublime.
“The ghosts?” asked Hermione, who was now quite used to Harry talking to himself in the middle of nowhere.
. It sits on Draco’s tongue for quite a bit, rumbling around desperately, almost ready to jump out any second now. But in the end Draco turns around, preparing to climb up the stairs. Only, Potter’s hand is clamped around his wrist, all of a sudden, and it shouldn’t be there. It shouldn’t even be touching him. Not after the look Potter gave him, back at the gala. Disgusting was written all over it. He cannot take that back now.
Pansy takes the seat beside him, making a show of examining her nails before remarking, “Why not? Merlin knows he’s loaded. More than Zabini, even. And there are feelings there, more than a bit I’d say…”
Potter tries to kiss him one month later. It doesn’t exactly work too well. Except, perhaps it works
“Ignore you?” Draco kindly finishes for him, way before Potter even gets that far. “No, thanks, I quite enjoy pretending you’re not here,” he sneers. “I wouldn’t want to make you feel like you deserve my attention. You don’t.”
It seems like Potter has some issues when it comes to broadcasting Draco’s gayness to the whole floor, and it’s funny, because Potter also appears to think he’s got nothing left to go back to but that bloke. Potter actually thinks
“No, of course not. You were just a sentimental little prat.” Pansy rolls her eyes. “Oh dear, my family is in danger!” she mimics mockingly, hand pressed to her chest in a dramatic fashion. “Yet you couldn’t save them in the end, could you?”
Draco eyes her doubtfully. “I don’t know…” It might be Pansy’s grin while talking about Potter, it always makes the hair on his arms stand on end. She is most definitely up to something. What though? He wonders. “Did you ever have any of that honour thing? I honestly can’t recall… I thought those who had it went to other Houses, not ours.”
“He’s always been your weak spot, hasn’t he?” Pansy says, gently. He feels her arms enclosing him. They pull him down a little, closer to her, cradling him in her arms. Cradling him while all he can do is fight to hold on to sobs, to hold on to tears that threaten and to happiness, at war with terror. For a moment there he recalls the last time he felt like this, when
"Yeah." But maybe Harry could. Maybe Draco could follow Harry into training—he'd always been good at potions after all, and they were also used for healing. There might be something there he could do. And in any case, they'd have to take him if he were still tied to Harry, wouldn't they?
For some absurd reason, his mind goes blank when he sees Potter watching him on the mirror. He’s never been this close to him since sixth year, except perhaps those few moments on his broom during seventh…
He’s not too fond of belatedness when it comes to his job, it tends to create a bad relationship between him and his clients, one that he’s not too keen on putting up with. On top of that, he’s going to have to take a potion over the last one, which still hasn’t worn off. He’s not sure if that affects how they work. Honestly, his Potions lessons feel ages ago, did Snape ever say anything about that in class? He pauses for a minute, thinking. He might have, but was he talking about Polyjuice or some other potion? Not sure, not yet. Regardless, considering what he’s going to get paid, it might be worth a try. It’s definitely plenty of cash.
"Oh, that's a good one!" he says, so Draco never mentions it again. Instead, he tells them he's got some sort of hormonal problem, and entertains himself by coming up with names for it.
On the short walk from the Ministry to the nearest Starbucks, Hermione kept talking about this new thing they had her doing all the way down there, in the Department of Mysteries.
Draco watches, somewhat dazedly, as Potter walks out of his shop. He has a feeling he won't be getting much done for what's left of the day—which, thankfully, isn't much.
All of a sudden, he feels so alone, extremely alone, panic raising within him because he’d expected shouting or something like that but not this, he’d expected movement, not this stillness that has a bad feeling to it. Smells of resentment and bitterness, and there’s something doubtful in Potter’s gaze which Draco doesn’t quite like, not much.
he do would have been a much better question; it's not like they'd ever hire him in the Ministry, not after the part he'd played during the war. He might not have done much, and he guessed he could count himself lucky to have had Harry speaking up for him in the trials. And yet, he wasn't convinced that would ever be enough to erase his guilt—it certainly didn't seem enough to those still writing about him in the
Draco lies against the wall as Potter kisses his way down his back, finally settling onto his arse. “What are you…” Potter’s hands pull apart his buttocks. “Salazar. You’re not going to…” He’s soon proved wrong by Potter’s tongue, as it gives a long lick along the crevice down there. “Merlin… you are. That feels…”
“Please,” she says. “Am I ever wrong? I’m guessing he’s been quite nice to you so far, taking you there and all…”
caught him. He’s about to go back to his dates, leave this Pans-prompted dream-like existence as unfinished business, go back to normal life—or at least to what normal is in his life and whatnot. His stomach will certainly thank him, he knows that much: he can’t remember swallowing this much poison in such a short period of time
"I did study Healing," Potter says tightly, "and I know enough to know that potion you're trying to—"
Candles would be blown, gifts would be opened, and Draco would wait until the first people started leaving before cornering Harry up against the wall. "I have a present for you as well," he'd murmur into Harry's ear.
"They do when there's magic involved," Draco counters. "Besides, need I remind you that we went from hating each other to being linked at the hip, as you so nicely put it, as well? Because it happened just before what you just mentioned, and yet—"
He sighs, mumbling, "And I hate looking at him now and knowing what he meant to me back then. I just . . . I hate knowing that he's no longer that, that he'll never be that person again."
.” He slips his hand down, slowly enough that Potter can easily stop him if he wants to. But Potter doesn’t. Potter just bites his bottom lip when Draco wraps his hand around him. “And I’d like to. Please…”
"No, not while you insist on turning your life into a bloody nightmare. It's almost as if you're trying to—"
A lazy smile draws up the corner of Potter’s mouth. “‘You put the boom-boom into my heart’. What can I say, it’s a bit hard not to hear you when you sing to yourself night and day.”
Draco looks up from where he's lying on their couch. "Why he's such an arse all the time?" At Pansy's nod, he adds, "I'd say that's just who he is now, new Dark Lord and all, but I know you're not a big fan of my theories."
—all those who fought for light and good, bless them—do not care the slightest bit. As far as they were concerned, Draco was better off dead. Not even a miserable
A blink later, the two men found themselves standing in the middle of the infirmary floor. The room swam before Harry’s eyes at the sudden change of location, but he stayed upright and his stomach stayed where it was despite the several flips that it did. Looking over to Snape though, he wasn’t fairing any better. Worse actually, if the green tinge to his skin and the death grip he had on Harry’s hand was any indication.
was left unsaid. “Severus’ head wound is being a bit troublesome, but the bleeding has all but stopped. Both men will be sore for a while, but I don’t see a reason to hold them much longer. I don’t think I can do much more for them.”
Knowing his eyes were bigger than his stomach, but not caring in the slightest, Harry piled his plate full with pumpkin pasties, rich Yorkshire pudding, juicy sausages, roast chicken and much more. Digging in, he let his mind wander to the last few months while quiet conversation was going on around him.
All too soon the feast was ending, bringing Harry back to the present and he found he had eaten to the point of being nearly uncomfortable in his trousers, but the food had simply been too good and although he probably should have skipped dessert, he was not known for being able to turn down a good treacle tart when placed in front of him.
"No thanks," Draco mutters, but his heart feels tight, straining against its walls like it's trying to climb out of his chest. And it's not the house that's to blame for that—it's Potter. The way he's sitting right next to Draco, with his face softened by the low light.
He read it because it was the normal thing to do. And deep down, Draco really wanted normalcy: to have people around him that admired him, not for his blood status, but for what he had done. Granted, much of what he had done was quite misguided, but was it so wrong of Draco to want friends that stood by him with pride, despite that? Well, apparently, it was, if the way things turned out for him were anything to go by.
“No, but you’re bonded to me.” Ain’t that cheating a bit there, Potter? Him and his dubious ethics, that only exist for others and never for him. Draco wonders sometimes, does Potter ever pause and contemplate Draco had no other option at the time but doing what he did? Selling his body, for cash he lacked. Especially after being denied his passport. “I need you. Please, come back.”
Once it’s uncorked, he raises his hand. “Cheers,” he tells his mirror self, and as a toast, he smiles a fake-smile to it. Then, he swallows the concoction with an ick.
“I don’t see why not.” Pansy frowned, looking quite stern. “It opens the portal to the Muggle world, doesn’t it?”
The morning after, Draco went through the motions as he did every other morning: he cast a shaving spell and had a shower, he changed into a clean uniform and then stood in front of the bathroom mirror combing his hair away from his face—all while resolutely ignoring the depraved winks his mirror image kept sending his way.
It's odd. Draco doesn't really miss his job—not yet; there's still too much to see, too much to do. But he's put so much work into it over the years that it's a bit discouraging to realise no one's missing him.
"Why not? You're not going to be able to keep working all through the pregnancy. Besides, you've been a complete mess ever since you broke up with Potter, I doubt you're getting anything done."
Instead, Harry lets go of him as if he's burning and hides his face behind his hands. Mumbles, "Why does everything have to be so sodding
He decides, damn him, that this is not going to affect him, that self-blame is for others and not for him, and he’s not going to blame himself over lying to Potter. Not when Potter deserves every lie Draco can make him swallow, because he’s partly at fault here, though Draco’s not too sure
to skim the sports section before leaving it open on Draco's counter. "Doesn't this bother you in the slightest?"
The only bit he keeps quiet is the bond. He’s not sure he wants Harry to know that. It seems pretty obvious that he doesn’t.
"But all your friends hate me," Draco spluttered. "Merlin, they'll probably try to murder me while I'm there!"
There’s still a bottle of Firewhisky on his side table. It’s still half-full. Half-full is better than half-empty, isn’t it? There are still four left under the bed, he tells himself, completely ignoring that at the rate he’s going they’re not likely to last longer than a couple of weeks. One drink to take the edge off. He’s not crying over that again. He’s done his crying. It’s past. It’s over. It’s done. Gone, and never coming back.
In the end Pansy’s suggestion turns into a plan by itself, mostly by twists of fate. Draco’s actions have very little to do with it. It just so happens Potter thinks he’s in an abusive relationship. “I think it was his boyfriend. He must have beat him up,” Draco hears him tell one of his mediwizards.
Potter eyes land on the treacle tart, where it's resting on the table. "I see you've been thinking about me," he says, lacing his fingers with Draco's.
Outside, the bells are ringing, and Draco raises his glass—still filled with water, much to his dismay. To the first day of the rest of our lives, he thinks.
“Useless. Even more useless than your father,” the Dark Lord said. “Perhaps I’ll let Fenrir have a little fun with you. Wouldn’t you like that, Fenrir?”
"Is this your weird way of asking me out on a date?" Draco quipped, only to instantly regret his words.
“Well, now I have, and it tastes awful.” He leans back against the wall on Pansy’s garden, glad to observe the sky from a distance. Then, he shuts his eyes. “Not everything can be forgiven, Pans.” It’s not that easy. Some things just can’t. What Potter did to him… Draco finds himself shaking his head, yet again. “I fell for him
is the one who's a complete and total prick, not Draco. He's the boy who had Draco's heart in his hands and crushed it, the boy who walked away from Draco when he most needed him. And Draco shouldn't have to deal with any of this anymore. He shouldn't have to put up with Potter's accusations years after the fact.
Draco can’t remember how he got to St. Mungo’s fourth floor. He remembers almost nothing on how Potter got there. Most of what he remembers is the short conversation he half-heard while his stretcher flew through long corridors, and his own eyes swayed between now open, next second shut.
