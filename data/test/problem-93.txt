Elisa and I sat on a couch on the opposite of the Malfoys
"So my love to you think you'll be able to keep up?" Rabastian smirked as I met his smile with my own.
Dumbledore laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute, the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulder shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out. After the other two left Dumbledore walked down the street with his put outer turning the street lamps on. He could barely see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. " Good luck Harry," he murmured. he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. As Harry was peacefully sleeping down the street was a person swinging on the neighborhood's rickety swings. This person was Nefertani Ptolemy a lord and King in her own right
I'm running out of gas ..aka I'm hitting writers block really hard but I'm going to still try and continue and push through for ya. But ideas are welcomed
Fred: miss the griffindor common room. But it would be worth it.
Nefertani: Elf  why do you ignore a direct order from your master? Especially in your current state?
I pout
Harry suddenly burst out into childish laughter when Helios fel butt first out of bed i joined him
We walked to his office not far away.
I than ran for my life stinging hexes following me out the door
to so quickly take this and say 'win or die' it will take you to my palace tell my wife what happened I'll hold them off.
I was warm and surrounded  by a smell of thunder and dark chocolate,  when I felt it pulling  away. I opened  my eyes wearily and saw Voldemort  leaving  the room. Seeing  I was awake he sighed, "sorry for waking you love."
And I can cap them all.
Elisa: be careful Tani
I steamed in frustration..before  a plan popped into my mind.
Kreacher sobbing: my lord is so merciful and kind
And began questioning
Then the plates in front of us were filled with all sorts of foods. I simply  grabbed  some potatoes  with chicken but Blaise insisted  I eat some vegetables.
Frank: this is a good deal I accept...but I have one condition
Harry: and Severus  snape
Harry: iss! Iss!
Nefertani: well let's go take a look at the new Grimmauld place ,that is if you guys don't mind if I tag along?
Harry: please I know you guys have a ...difficult  past but he's my
He said as we moved to the couch.
Nefertani POV
Now don't get me wrong Henry's son was good looking but the way he looked at me....just made shiver go down my spine..like I was being hunted by a wolf.
Remus: shouldn't you ask Sirius? It's his-
I huffed and put my hand on my hips.
Harry smiled and held a hand to his mouth and nodded
Frank: what would this business proposal entail
A paper listing all the homes appeared in my hand which I gave to Sirius
Elisa's furious voice: Nefertani Everon Ptolemy you have 5 seconds to get your ass up here and explain to me why dangerous criminals are in our living room!! And so help me if I don't here a good reason it will be me and you!
Elisa: Tani.. just great now he's going to turn into a rainbow
"Bring it on." I said as we moved simultaneously in a move where I ended up in a deep bend while being held to his chest.
Dean and Tomas following while grumbling about childish antics too early in the morning.
The rest of my younger mates Draco,the twins,Blaise, Theo,Terry,Cedric,  and Percy were confused and asked what that was all about. But I simply shook my head when I was questioned.
Kreacher:  because mistress disowned him my lady and,
We were each  given 10 points each for getting  the spell so quickly.
I ran up the stairs to our rooms, and when I turned  the corner  I bumped into someone and fell on my tush.
Seeing my murderous  expression Marvolo suprises everyone by being the one to caution me from committing murder via execution.
Elisa gets up and hugs them both tightly.
So try me on and I will tell you
Maleen and Helios: Welcome home Tata!!
They were still asleep Maleen was on the floor leaning on her bed still snoring while Helios had his butt In the air. I shook with laughter and quickly summoned a camera
Everyone was silent until Slytherin started clapping and my mates then everyone else as I walked to sit by Draco. And when I looked up at the table to my Tata who was speaking to Aurora sinistra looked at me and smiled and mouthed
I raised my hands for silence and everyone quietened down.
"Please dont cry, I know it stings right now  but I know that you will win next time , because you work so so hard every day to get stronger." I said softly while wiping his tears.
Maleen:Tata today I'm supposed to be a princess of the pretty ladies right?
I love reviews
And we headed to Mcgonagall's office,  with Neville holding one hand and Cedric the other. And I sighed at least I didn't  get into  trouble  on the first day I thought.
Where dwell the brave at heart,
"Council member who?" The twins said after looking confused,  Terry ,Dean,Seamus, And Cedric wearing matching expressions  seems like Tata hasn't had the talk with them ,I'll have to do it myself tonight.
I smiled thinly and bowed to Hernando before accepting his hand and following him to the dance floor.
I turned around and my wife's sky blue eyes bored into me with deadly precision. " Now tell me my...King as to why I awake from our bed with you gone from my side". Harry started to whine so I quickly shushed her. Her eyes widened comically when she saw him, as she quickly nodded. Elisa if you would be A dear to quickly make him a cradle on our bed I would appreciate it. Elisa did as was asked and I finally laid the child on the makeshift cradle. Elisa motioned me to follow her to my study I sighed then followed. As soon as the door closed she whipped her head towards me so fast her black hair flew and said: "Explain now." " This will take minute hun lets sit and get some refreshments. "Lippy!" "yes, master?'' A house-elf wearing gold and purple robes asked. "Elisa and I would like honey plum tea, thank you." the house-elf popped out of the room and came back with warm tea. I took off my cloak and got comfortable on the loveseat I had opposite my desk. Elisa did the same, my hair shrunk till it was only to my shoulders and my body changed from female to male . ( I am a metamorphagus) " Elisa after you fell asleep I just left to clear my thoughts and release stress, after all, I am only 14 yet I have become a Pharaoh not only to sorcerers but magical creatures as well. We just got married today even though you are only 11 because that was the only way to protect you! and so I shadow traveled to a mortal neighborhood nearby and I found the child who by the way is Harry Potter was left on a doorstep by other magical's with only a brief letter as an explanation!" Elisa gasped "o my Morgana," she said. " Tell me about it, "I said " Elisa I know this is very sudden but I wish to go to Gringotts to become his guardians then blood adopt him. It would solve our problems and be beneficial to him. Now those in the council that wishes for you and your people to be out onto the streets cannot make it so by questioning your fertility on giving me children which we know they would attempt to do as soon as the seven-year mark has passed."
I said then headed down to the dining room where Remus,sirius and Elisa were waiting.
It left ..but after 15 minutes  it still didn't  return.
Bellatrix: who are you?? Where are the Longbottoms!??
Nefertani: This is Hadrian James Ptolemy Potter Black my first born son and heir to My throne ! Our dynasty is blessed to continue for another generation!!
"How come we dont get any kisses?" In his Irish accent.
Tonight was the night of the annual yuletide ball that the Malfoy family tended to throw every year, much to some of my mates horror they were forced to attend.
I kinda chickened out on putting the mates and creature inheritance down because i'm indecisive. i  need opinions.
But anyway  after history we headed to Defense against the dark arts, that was being taught by my adoptive mom Elisa instead of my Tata.
I then called down a house elf to manually clean up the ritual while Rabastian and I headed up to Voldemort's new room . As I put him in the bed I laid a charm on him that would bring me to him when he awoke he sat up eyes wide with confusion fear,and rage. Good thing I told rabastian to take Harry to dinner with the rest of the family.
Remus: it has been thought that the chameleons were extinct centuries ago!
Sirius:who is it!?
If you've a ready mind,
"Yes ,welcome to the family..but be warned our motto is
Severus  pov
And I laid next to him pulling  him close possessiveness  burning  in my chest  as I scented him until  we fell asleep .
He is hastily given to Marvolo by a pale Rabastian and he holds Harry away from his body and looks to me in bewilderment
They stopped bouncing off the walls when they saw me then as I braced myself the demons came at me.
Nefertani: *groans* leave me alone pup we have to wait for your mom and she takes forever not to mention the twins and Sirius. Just let me rest my eyes-
Harry: I've missed you guys! What took you so long?
Marcus:Unseelie fae
trahere, et dicere, quia frater tuus
We then entered  the charms classroom  and all sat together  Terry closest  to me as I scented him gently.
I grin
Tata: Nefertani
You can keep your bowlers black,
While Frank and Alice look over the proposal I look over at fire dancer feeding Harry his cereal.
Nefertani: you and I both know that Sirius couldn't care either way and he'll most likely ask you to pick so what's it going to be?
If things continued on in this rate ,I'd have to expand them.
As expected Things were getting tense in the rooms after Oliver moved in and I decided enough was enough. The next day which was Sunday I forced all of my mates into the livingroom and put my foot down.
I went into a room that was set up as a office the one that had the ruined family tapestry to see a new one in its place with no scorch marks signifying a disowned family member.
Neville: everything will be ok ? Remember that no matter what  house you go in we will always  love you. Draco hummed his affirmative When a second later some students behind me screamed and I jumped and bumped into a boy with violet eyes and dark skin that was behind me. As I apologised to him we bonded and not a second later McGonagall was back and ordered us to line up and follow her my new mate grabbed my wrist so I was behind him in the line and said.
As Elisa ,Fire Dancer,and Sirius started a conversation about removing methods
Frank: I would like to make an alliance with your house
This was no other Hernando,  Henry's son ..I smiled as I politely declined.
I am laying my head on Fire Dancers lap, feet upon Draco's while he tells me some of the tactics Marcus intends to use for tomorrow's game.
Elisa: now where is your-
so can you please  just leave him be? I'm not saying  that you have to be best buddies  but it would  really  mean a lot if you could at least  be cordial with him. ..and I Also  think an apology  will go a long way.
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
Harry was now awake wiggled to be put down and took off to the play area where Draco and Neville were as soon as his feet touched the ground.
Sirius: Cerberus
Harry: giggles
I huffed ,put my nose in the air and started my way back to the castle.
"Well can you please  just send a patronus ,just to check?" I asked again.
Heir to Ptolemy lordship by Blood
Draco, the twins and Blaise all grumbled for a while but later dropped it like the rest of my mates already have.
Just as Hernando opened his mouth to no doubt ask me an inane question , when Rabastian's voice saved me from the hell I was in.
He looked  sharply  at Siri eyes glowing  amber in threat if Sirius said something to upset  me.
(See the end of the chapter for
When I decided to tease him a bit , I leaned  my head on his shoulder and put my arm in his.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
Where those of wit and learning,
I then got a vow from him promising not to tell anyone what I told him unless I approved of the person...it took. A long time to convince him to do so. I then took out the book told him what it was then explained to him Voldemort's  relationship to Harry and the agreement I had with the other death eaters.As well as my plan and everyone else who currently knew. Lucius was cautious and through about making sure that Voldemort wasn't going to be crazy or allowed to hurt him and his family. He also made me give him family a promise of asylum should anything go wrong. I then gave him permission to tell his wife which I granted then I flooed home with the diary that went with the cup and locket.
Harry nodded and patted the side of his that was opened  since he moved to the other side of Severus .
The dance scene is basically inspired by The mask of zorro..one of my favorite movies!
Elisa held out her hand and I gave her ten sickles
Bellatrix started to freak out when he did wake
Sirius: we are gonna have to keep an eye on him encase-
A voice  inside  my head called  and I shook my head to clear my thoughts. I then focused  on Mcgonagall who just turned  back to her true form and started  her speech about the rules and expectations of the classroom.
Now here I am enlarging my rooms to fit another mate in, My elder mates mainly leading the endeavor.
On the other side of the bed . 25 minutes  later Severus  finally  greeted  sleep.
"Now let's get started shall we ?" I said twirling my wand.
I then gave a wink and kiss as I walked out to my 'introduction'
When I introduced  my new mates the only ones that showed hesitation were Draco,Theo  Tomas and Severus.
Helios takes off running with Maleen screaming WAIT after him towards the kitchen
I took Harry from Elisa
: Speaking
Fire dancer: The storm fire clan
Henry and his aide bowed
Draco was complaining over not being able to bring his broom, much to Theo's displeasure and Blaise's amusement.
But when the bell rung I was up and out the door like a race horse on the track, leaving Draco and Blaise to catch up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nefertani: alright I need all of you to sit on the couch while I draw the circle to put Voldemort back together and then I'll need some of Harry's blood to bind him and Voldemort together. I then gave Rabastian a device that looked like a dropper but had a needle at the end.
Percy then spoke up , " so if I wished to, I could be in the Judicial branch as a Lawyer, Attorney and Judge? Because it says here in the packet page 45 that a member of the royal family may move between positions as long as they meet the requirements. "
Harry looked at Sirius and broke into a wild grin
Harry immediately reached out to Marvolo from rabastian tears and tantrum threatening if wish is not given.
Lucius was focused on Elisa who looked at his glare head on.
I threw my self at Marcus first while babbling how cool he looked while flying and how proud I was of him.
Nefertani: laugh it up big boy laugh it up
Harry stopped his grizzling and then fell asleep.
Elisa: why didn't you look harder
Nefertani: yes? What is it?
I then looked to my Tata who sighed,  " Harry  we have found out who ordered Severus to be poisoned  but it isn't  a simple matter you see, It turns out the plan was more elaborate than expected. "
I answered as the matches were were supposed to turn into needles were placed in front of us.
Nefertani: I called it
We all chuckled and Elisa asked Dippy to record it while we talked business..
Sirius gaped at me while Remus's face got stony
Harry: may I?
Nefertani: was she the head of the house of black? I think not ,now it is your duty to serve the current head regardless of feelings or you can hardly call yourself a good house elf. What would your mistress say if she saw you how-
It was going on 4 a clock so I moved everyone into the dining room for lunch while Harry had his hour nap.
Herbology wasn't that bad ,at the beginning of class we went over safety rules and such.Then we got to pick the stems and leaves from a dittany Bush , while wearing cloths over our noses incase of one of them decided to release fumes.
Maleen knocked on the table three times
Then I give him back to Elisa so I can eat my food lippy just gave me.
Nefertani POV
Elisa: why didn't you?
I said with a smile
Harry POV
Nefertani POV
Sirius: so this is Fire Dancer..
Nefertani: Sirius me and the children are going to the Malfoys so the kids can have a playdate and brunch ..do you and Remus wish to go?
Lippy:yes master?
Elisa: ok good now , let me get one thing straight you are not to even think about doing ANYTHING inappropriate to our son until he is 17 and bonded to you do you understand? Because if I find out that he is pregnant at 14 or something I will wipe your soul and everyone's memories of you off the face of this earth and every universe YOU exist in! Do I make myself clear?
Remus: I'm a werewolf I hear everything Sirius so you better watch it
I sat at the head of the table Maleen and Helios on my left Elisa,fire dancer,and Harry at my right.
My mates and I finished our breakfast of waffles and fruit, and after heartfelt and disgustingly  sappy goodbyes I went to my first class with Draco, Theo,Neville, Blaise,Seamus,and Dean. Man I couldn't wait to fly.
I said as I sat next to him and immediately cuddled into his side and he immediately put his arm around me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Draco giving the twins gold and I laughed and started talking to my new mate about what he was reading.
So I made plans to spend time with Marvolo, Remus, Severus, Fire dancer, Rabastan (who I honestly haven't seen a lot since school started due to who he is, and his job which requires secrecy especially from nosy ass Dumbledore! We only get to see each other when he floo's over to our rooms before after work, much to my disdain. ) and Sirius on weekends and my free periods or time.
Helios and Maleen: I do
Nefertani stuck he hand out and a locket came out from the bag and landed in her hand..it radiated dark magic
Elisa giggles with the twins
I nodded " My Tata taught me and my siblings how to do magic  without wands because I quote ' Only fools and idiots have wands as their only weapon or resource up their sleeves. We Ptolemies use any means to triumph over our enemies..even pranks and other humiliating means."
Maleen and Helios:be on our best behavior
Remus: I am sorry but I can't-
Investigation,  and answers.
Elisa dress and crown
When everyone left through the floo I asked Lucius to talk about a serious matter..
Helios:he looks just like mom and Tata .. except for the eyes cool..
Nefertani walks In and sits at the head of the table.
Lippy takes Harry to his room
" I dont care , he tried to hurt my mate so his life is forfeit!! Just shove some Veritism down his throat during a meeting, and when we accuse him he cant lie! Then we can kill him without  the stupid  council interfering." I snarled surprising Remus and Sirius by how willing  I was to have Henry killed.
But imagining Draco's  reaction  to Cedric was either going to be amusing  or annoying.
When nefertani was a child she lived in Egypt with her parents ( who were ruling) before her Aunt overthrew her parents causing her and her two younger siblings to flee to England and live on the streets and in the woods. When Nefertani was 12 she ran into a group of abused or neglected muggle-borns and squibs that were in the same situation as her and her siblings. One of the leaders of the group was a 9-year old squib named Elisa Malfoy. They grew to be best friends and they built a small village in the Bourne woods and lived peacefully using magic and slowly growing as they accepted everyone whether wizard, creature, and mortals that had nowhere to go ( all were sworn to secrecy by a magical Vow to not reveal the location if questioned). Until Nefertani's aunt heard she was still living and sent assassins. Deciding enough was enough she confronted her aunt and reclaimed her thrown. But some of the purebloods wished to be rid of Elisa and the others in the small kingdom they built. To Avoid this Elisa and Nefertani married but in the laws of Nefertani's people if the queen has not given birth to an heir in 7 years the marriage can be overturned.
Albus: ahem- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start of term notice me to give you first-year should note that the forest on the ground is forbidden to All pupils. And A few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.
As soon as I said that his hair grew very long then turned crimson, purple,yellow, and pink.
Nefertani : let's go to breakfast children
Harry pov
"I know Blaise but I need to know if the culprit has been found yet!" I said wringing my hands nervously at the thought of someone targeting my mates and i.
Currently it was the day before the first game of the season Griffindor vs Slytherin and I was relaxing with Blaise ,Draco, Remus and Fire dancer in the living room .
A throat clearing burst our bubble it was Lucius trying to remind us that we were in public but I didn't budge from my spot clinging to Draco.
Anyway,
"I can't help it my little dove, you are just to precious to me.I can't help being protective it's my job afterall." He says smugly before kissing my head and being pulled away by fire dancer and his clan.
Diagon alley was still bursting with people that were still feeling the bliss of the demise of Voldemort. I quickly walked through the crowd with my head held high and people parted like the red Sea. People pointed and started to whisper but we walked into gringotts it immediately ceased. I walked up to a teller who did not seem to be serving anyone and said in Gobbledegook
Nefertani: looks like we are In agreement let's sign the papers and make it official!
Sirius was in shock when Remus snarled and took Harry from him snarling
Nefertani: you worry too much
I giggled as I dragged an amused Rabastian and a embarrassed Marcus to my tata and mom along with some of my other mates I came across in the ball room .
He gulped  twice ,and I pulled  away water finally  gone. And waited head on his chest listening to his heart beating.
Sirius: fine!! I won't throw the junk away!
6th of November
Elisa: I am a squib so please stop talking you are just making yourself look worse
Hadrian James Potter Ptolemy Black:
I burst out laughing  and Theo and Blaise smiled at our antics when blase spoke up.
Nefertani: there is two more people I must introduce Elisa of the Malfoy family,Leader of the Forgotten, my wife and consort ,and queen of the Ptolemies lands!
Fire dancer nods
The dragons roared,stomped,and breathed fire.Helios walked out spine straight and roared fire above the crowd proving his dragon heritage. Then sat on his throne that was made of gold and red. A servant held out a scepter and I gave it to my brother ...my son and smiled
Sirius: I still can't believe this .. James  and Lilly will torture me in horrendous ways when I see them again
Shorter twin: all the others are full.
I sighed this was going to be a long night .
Worker: your friend then must-
Much to my amusement.
Bellatrix: YOU'RE LYING
I looked at the clock
I close my eyes and pray for mercy..
I never thought I'd see the day two slytherin's and a gryffindor fell over themselves to agree that they would do their utmost to be good mates...while shaking like scared puppies.
Elisa put her hand over her mouth and ran to Harry and picked him up while my face became grim. The healer asked me if I would like them to remove it , I looked at Harry's red tie's that led to his mates ...shit was all I could think "no thank you I will deal with it myself "I said.
Whispers all throughout the chamber
You might belong in Gryffindor,
All the death eaters stared at Rabastian in shock with mouths open before
I snap my fingers and it appears in front of him
Percy knew most of who was in the Council and how it worked, but was clueless about the rest of the government.
Helios crown
I just finished making a summoning circle with the book Horcrucx in the middle and chanted
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
Remus:MINE!
But back to the present I was in the Slytherin stands cheering for my house and my mates on Gryffindor team ,procuring some looks from my classmates and friends that I gladly ignored.
Elisa : what is your name?
Once Marvolo realized that our way of doing things was more popular and actually  accepted with some persuasion he switched to being Neutral Instead  of dark.
Nefertani: I know
Harry then babbled something but Neville being shy and a little uncomfortable looked as if he was going to cry
A smarter hat than me.
Just to make sure no one is confused this story started on 1981 October 31st on Wednesday. Chapter 2 was Thursday November the first,the beginning of this chapter will be Friday then move on to the upcoming Wednesday a week after the whole Voldemort attack.
Elisa quickly gave Harry to Sirius before she dropped him
Sorry for the short update I'll make sure the next one is longer
Let's not forget that all three of you are being introduced and crowned today!
Severus  sighed  and with a wave of his wand transfigured his robe to pajamas  and decided  to unpack  in the morning.  He laid  me at to harry  who snuggled  into his chest. And two minutes later heard the door open and harry's  three other mates  lie on the other sides of the twins.
I then headed back upstairs to get ready  for my classes  today. Along with all my other mates that were students.
Nefertani: get off me you gremlins!
Nefertani frowning: you guard come with me
As she continued down the list I felt my nerves growing making my hair turn green until Blaise squeezed my hand with Draco who was behind me. With My hair back to it's long black state I paid attention to the sorting . Neville went to Griffindor while Draco went to Slytherin
Fire dancer: as long as it's the best thing for Harry
I told them it was robbers and that I fought four at once and was winning which they realized and porkey-ed away.The Longbottoms accepted this story and were led to there rooms for the night.
Sirius smirked widely: that is awesome my prongslet is going to be the best prankster out of us all
Sirius mumbling: not where I can be heard by you or Harry anyway
I caught them and held them close
Nefertani Pov
Maleen nodding: yea Tata just whooss toys away
While this was happening the kids were fighting on what to watch on the TV and Elisa sat on the couch and summoned Dippy for refreshments which were laid out
"Come on ickle harrikinns time for school!"
Harry *pouting*: fine but I make no promises so how was-
Elisa: yes i did! But I meant gently not bloody throwing me out the bed
Elisa groaning: Nefertani leave me alone.
Elisa,Alice,Frank,and I signed the new contract making us business partners and allies.
" It is ok my little  one ,Severus is out of the danger zone ,so sleep ,I
Elisa relaxed
Elisa: that was entertaining..
I helped him up and he broke out of his shock.
It was next Wednesday.
Henry: The reason why I requested an audience with you-
Who poisoned Severus? Got any guesses?
######
George arrived and lunged after me playfully , and I ran giggling around the table.
Remus shook his head at Sirius's statement and at that moment Elisa walked in with Harry
Let's move on I said then we went back to the office we were in and the blood adoption potion was sitting waiting . Elisa passed Harry to me while she pricked her finger and out in three drops of blood , then I did the same. Then I turned to Harry and Said "open up Harry " and he did he drank it quickly then made a face and tried to get the taste out by blowing Raspberry's getting spit on me in the process. Elisa laughed and gave him some orange juice we brought for him in a sippy cup.we watched as his skin color changed into mine and his black messy hair grew longer and the ends of his hair became blonde , straight and thick.His eyes remained the same but they were more doe shaped and all most glowed. Beautiful was all I could think .
Remus: we are Harry's other mates ...it's ..nice to meet you
Elisa : I counted on you to save me and you failed me!
Remus: werewolf
" Draco leave Percy be ,we just bonded so that's why I am taking him with us to our rooms." I explained as Thoe groaned  something  about  them being over run by weasley's.
Which led to me scenting all of my mates because it made me feel uncomfortable  not scenting them all.
......,......
Almost to a level of concern,  but I knew unlike my other mates The reason Percy clung to rules and whatnot was because it represented order and therefore safety.
I asked Remus
Nefertani Pov
But I didn't expect it to happen so soon!
"Mom! Dad! I wanted to introduce you to some of my newer mates This is Marcus Flint,Adrian pucey,and Lee Jordan. " I said pointing to each one as I introduced  them.
While Blaise and Fire dancer were amused by my tirade and agreed with me to extent Draco was hurriedly trying to change the subject.
Tata quickly left with mom after hasty apologies to my younger mates , seems the plan actually worked!
Nefertani: quick to the business eh??
We walked into the circular chamber that had a chair in the middle of the room with chains around the arm rest. Elisa sat by my side and we waited for the trial to start. Others from the magical law department came and sat as well as the wizengamot.then the room was full.
We see the results of Harry's plan.
I give them a kiss on the forehead
Maleen and Helios: TATA!
November 9th Saturday
Fire dancer: is there anyone  else  love?
I then turned to the sink and got a mouthful of water and held it in my mouth.
Nefertani : Marvolo calm down I will explain everything to you but you must calm down before I put you back to sleep
Nefertani shadow traveled to her palace that was hidden by many wards and enchantments in the Bourne Woods.
Sirius breathed  in a deep breath  an looked as if he was  going  to argue  before  Remus  spoke.
The crowd was screaming laughing and some crying(like how some lol act at a concert) when I walked out to the platform that held five thrones. I looked at the nobles and lords that sat along the sides of the courtyard and smirked none of them knew of our little surprise..
Helios: we could have together.
I stop pick them both up and set on the nearest black couch.
Remus: we are nearly thrice his age !! Isn't he supposed to mate with the best potential candidates?
Neville  certainly enjoyed it as much as I but Theo and Draco thought it was horribly boring.  Blaise ,Dean, and Seamus were Neutral on the subject they neither hated it or loved it.
"O our dear brother come upstairs with us"- Fred
And that night the Locket was next to the cup in a chamber waiting to be put together again..
Our classmates laughing uproariously at our shenanigans.
Barty: how would you know?
Henry: was to settle the matter of your next wife-
Nefertani: then you should be more specific dear
I asked reaching  out a hand and he nodded  face impassive yet the softening  of his eyes let me know he was affected.
And then gently runs his hand gently on a white fox tail. That immediately  makes me pure again..before I realize  its connected to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Elisa:did you take care of it ?
Elisa:oh?
"What did you just say to me Ptolemy,  because I dont think I heard you correctly."
Little did I know with Yule tide break approaching my wish would not be granted .
Helios: Nefertani please don't die we need you!!
Where you ought to be.
Marcus's chuckle causing butterflies in my stomach.
Elisa: Tani is he???
Rosy happily squealed :yes master
Nefertani and Elisa go to Sirius's trial a week after the Longbottoms incident,and happen to run into in-laws. And Harry meets one of his mates..
Henry: your Majesties.
Nefertani: another thing is that Harry has gotten his creature inheritance from me ..I am a chameleon
Everyone's  luggage  was there and after helping  everyone  unpacked we got ready for bed . While the others settled  down I went to the living  room  by the entrance  to wait for my other mates. After walking  my mother out who came to check  on us and wish us goodnight.  I cuddled  up with a book on a small arm chair  when fire dancer  arrived  with Sirius  and Remus.
Other than the propaganda about our house that has slowly been dying down due to the quibbler producing articles about the prejudice, and how it was negatively affecting our society.
Harry: Harry ptolmey Potter to your service.
Harry : giggles
Albus: welcome! Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts before we begin our banquet I would like to say a few words. And they are nitwit! Blubber! oddment! tweak!...thank you!
Elisa: I don't see any harm in it .
Nefertani: technically I am Harry's legal and Blood sire now ...
For breakfast we only had a little bit of fruit salad due to us having brunch at the Malfoys later
Harry goes to his dormitory  with his mates ..but when Severus  shows up will he stay and give the mateship  a chance?
I picked him up and took him with me to the twins room across from mine
I then looked at both of the twins side by side
That night I was sandwiched in between Remus and Sirius,  praying like I had caught Severus and percy doing earlier that my mate gathering slowed down just a little.
Amelia: who was the secret keeper then?
Nefertani: how old are you?
The next morning  I awoke in the hospital wing and ate breakfast along with Severus (after it had been tested to make sure there was no poison or harmful substances in it).
Sirius just stared at me as did Remus
totum
I washed my hands and rolled up my sleeves to make some turnovers ,Bacon, fruit and yogurt for my mates for breakfast.
Nefertani: do you have family or someone held as the same?
Harry is reunited with Sirius and Remus just how will they react when they realize Harry is now Nefertani's son?
And unafraid of toil;
while Remus's was staring blankly ahead in shock like he couldn't comprehend what I just said
I was happy to see none of my mates held anything against Theo for his grandfather's actions . Which helped Theo sit back up rather quick once it was confirmed we wouldn't shunt him due to who he was related to.
I asked innocently and everyone except Lucius burst out laughing when the Longbottoms joined us which made me throw myself at Neville and repeat my Koala routine while the adults caught up until the last whistle blew. After we said goodbye to our parents the twins,Draco, Neville and I got onto the train  and chose a compartment in the back that held a boy with brown hair and eyes and pale skin who was reading a book about hexes.
I shook my head as I sat up stretching " It doesn't  matter i was planning  on waking  soon  to make breakfast,  so don't  be ." I then removed Severus's arm and followed  him out of the bed to the kitchen/living  area.
When it stopped and there was a man laying in the middle of the circle that had brown hair and pale skin and was in his early twenties.
I Tell Elisa where I'm going and walk into the kids bedroom quietly because they were asleep and kissed them all. Then shadow travelled to the Longbottoms, as I arrived I knew immediately that something was wrong. Because all I heard was the wards around the manor breaking and a shocked scream from Alice Longbottom . Not wasting time I Shadow traveled to the family Frank was in front of Alice who was holding their son in a protective stance wand pointed at me.
His eyes glowed for a moment as we simply stared at one another in amazement until the moment was broken by Blaise ,Draco, Theo,And Terry coming around the corner.
After seeing my power they all nod
Before  Neville could scold Seamus  a large older woman with a kind smile was in front of the green house.
As we finished A fourth year Hufflepuff came in and nearly  ran me over in his haste to reach Miss Sprouts.
Nefertani: love, let me see Harry for a second..I am Pretty sure he is a chameleon like me but let me double check..
Laughing  all the way down the stairs in the dining room, to Cedric  throwing myself into his arms . "Cedric save me! George is coming to get me!"
"I'm Terry boot and you are ?" He said not taking  his off of me.
Outraged cries
At last the desserts to disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore Got To His Feet Again. The hall fell silent.
Nefertani and Elisa: nothing
...later at the palace
Deadpan Nefertani: just forgot to mention it ..by the way where is Fire Dancer anyway?
My mates and I were enjoying our breakfast in our rooms , when my father received an emergency summon from Henry's family.
I glared at him
Nefertani: today my people we are here to honor me and my family as well as the dragon shifters and the land nymphs by giving them a monarch for which they have been denied for centuries!That shall provide and protect them from their enemies. I know that most of you are curious of me because I am new and you wish to know what my plans are for this kingdom. But my goal is to Rush In a new era where no one either Mortals, magical creatures or sorceress shall fear prejudice or hate. None of my people will worry of starvation or of War for I shall strive my best to make sure that none of these become a problem. Now let me introduce my blood brother and adopted son! The new Prince of dragons Heir to the throne of Dragons Helios Ptolemy Shadeslayer !
Which got them to keep their mouths shut
They looked at one another then nodded ,after which I waved my hands and put up lots of protection,and silence spells.
And there was a ring  and diadem that hummed along with all the other Horcrucxes .
The twins smirking  mischievously  as they communicated  in the only way twins can.
I went next door past the guards and saw the twins were already up dressed and causing chaos .
Nefertani: is there any complications with the renovation?
That night as my mates and I Ate dinner,  Marvolo cleared his throat to get everyone's attention.
Barry:I pick helping
I had Harry in his highchair and was feeding him warm flavored corn baby food from a jar when me and husband's gremlins busted in the room.
I sat at my spot at the head of the table after putting the twins in their seats and getting a messy banana kiss from Harry and Elisa.
I had to hide my laughter ,and focused hard to keep my face somber as dinner came to an end.
An hour later when I entered  the room it was harry   was awake  and stared at me piercingly as if to ask ' where have you been'?
A servant replies : your majesty everyone is ready for you and the queen
Nefertani: that was pretty good but my wife just better on the daily also they had nothing to do with Voldemort's death.
Then we were dismissed  and the twins and Neville  came over to us and we went  up to my father that was waiting  for us at the head table. Severus  was no where to be seen and it made dread grow in my gut. But my father  sensed  my mood and put her hand under  my chin.
"I have already..dealt with Theo's  father so he will no longer be a problem,  but to go against Henry will require..delicate planning if you dont want the rest of his allies in the council to to go against you."
Remus looks away and whistles which makes us all laugh except Sirius who pouts
I sigh and look up " please goddess Aset I don't think I'll be able to handle another child please have mercy"
They are so dramatic, like I get I can be toxic and addictive but damn that's  just hurtful !
"thoughts"
Fire dancer gulped and took Harry into his arms where he snuggled in and relaxed.
The nerve of him ! Honestly !
Lucius: welcome lord and lady Ptolemy, heir Ptolemies, lord black, and lupin.. please have a seat .
Bored my mates and I started  to play a game of trying to see who could make the most feathers  float at once.
"Harry ,no ,stop this - we should not " Draco continued to blubber and dodge my kissing attempts.
" Now Potter you know better that to run in the halls, you could have gotten  hurt . This time I wont take house points but"-  he cut off as our eyes met and we bonded and he now stared at me as if I held the sun and stars.
Helios rubbing his butt and pouting: Tata it's not funny
"O I also want a blood test done too for Harry after the blood adoption of course" I said
I said dramatically  as I put the three tiny carrots on my plate while Draco put his nose in the air and said in his forced pompous voice.
I turned around and hugged him tightly
" Its not like you aren't smart enough to come up with a newer game plan. I know more than anyone that you are one of the sharpest and cunning minds in this house"
8th of November
Amelia: everyone in favor of clearing Sirius of all charges and the 1,000,000 galleon fine as reimbursement for teams earned at Azkaban?
"Its no harm done." The boy said  quietly  before taking my hand and meeting my eyes. And our bond snapped into place.
Let's just say we won the game by a landslide, and I was so proud of Marcus and Adrian because they only had one morning practice to Adjust to the new regime!
"Alright  harry that's enough teasing , I dear you will give Draco a aneurism if you dont stop." Neville  said and I pouted but relented to Draco's relief.
After Sirius signed it
Lucius: it has been a long time since I have seen you Elisa ...I am glad you are well let us have this conversation away from prying ears.
Sirius to Harry: Harry promise me that you won't be like Remus.
At that Moment lippy came back with Harry and gave him to me
I gave Harry a kiss and Said "sit still for a second Little one" then stepped back. Other goblins , females came in and started chanting . Magic surged in the room Harry suddenly frightened started to cry Elisa started to gum which calmed him a little, when suddenly everything stopped . And the lead female gave me a paper and Said this is what we found in his system.
My hair was grown out again long enough to reach my waist. I had on a tight black shirt with gold silk pants. Over it I put on a golden cloak lined with purple silk. For makeup all I had was eyeliner and ChapStick for the final touch was my crown.
My camera landed in my hands and I took a thousand pictures
And then left the room . Feeling nervous my hair grew longer and turned red. Neville who was on my right put his hand on my back.
Taller twin: hello do you mind if we sit with you?
Sirius immediately asked quick as a whip
Amelia: the accused has agreed to questioning with Veritaserum.
Harry and the family on September 1st
Theo: I am Theodore Not it's nice to meet you..
Your top hats sleek and tall,
The lounge had a huge TV with a x box,wii,and ps4 with a small kitchen and a long U shaped couch.
Seeing  my other mates he sneered black eyes glittering
Nefertani: enough ! Now every one I have business with today come along and Rabastian bring Harry with you.
It's not like I didn't enjoy the game I just enjoyed free flying more. I also was too lazy to go to the practices on top of my extra lessons I was taking outside of school.
Nefertani pov
Nefertani: this is what I am thinking we will do to make sure your bond is stable you will be assigned as a personal guard to harry. And the only ones that will know of your mate ship is our family,your family,and your clans head no one else. And your family will be moved to castle grounds for protection and shall work in the palace should they wish too. Does this seem agreeable?
Next Marcus and Adrian discussed their issues with the twins and Oliver and eventually reached an agreement with them.
Alice walked in and sat Neville next to harry which made Harry's fascination with the TV end
The whole point of cheating is not to get caught doing it,  and it rubs me the wrong way when I know that Flint has a sharp mind despite his brooding appearance and is simply not using it to prove that our team can win without blatant underhand tactics.
Tomas then spoke up with amusement glinting in his eyes."we are transfixed by this my dear."
And then started working on making the feather float. Blaise got it just seconds  behind Terry, and I and Draco followed them .
Everyone panicked until I told them that it was his first shift into another creature a Kitsune no less!
As I said this I let my hair down and feeling hot I shortened it until it was to my scalp and made the color white .(kinda like Bakugo's hair)
Nefertani: now you can either help me help him because if he dies my son dies. Or you can go to jail pick one.
Another school day ,and a murder dun dun duunnn!
The guards shut the door and stood in attention.
As soon as I appeared in the guest living room I was tackled by two children Maleen and Helios.
" Harry while that plan ,is an option it is unlikely that we will be able to slip Henry the Truth serum due to his lordship ring. And even if we did ,it wouldn't look good by any means if it were known that we use the serum without permission on unsuspecting lords."
Tired already Harry fell asleep in my arms while my wife and I were signing the papers to make it official. "Should we change his name" Elisa asked. " Just a little I said ..how do you like Hadrian James Potter Ptolemy Black so we can still call him Harry?" "Its perfect " Elisa Said as she kissed his forehead. Then lastly we did a blood test to make sure everything was alright overall.
I immediately started to rant about why this was part of the reason why our house was disliked.
Marcus's broad shoulders were tense betraying his anger as his dark eyes locked onto my face challenging me to look away when he spoke
I sighed and took her hand then shadow travelled to the ministry.
Amelia then gave him the antidote then showed everyone more proof in the form of memories.
I said staring out amount my mates ..who all started talking at the same time.
Nefertani : I thought they same
Right when his breathing  returned to normal the door flew open  a second time ,my tata,Sirius, Remus,and Dumbledore came rushing  In looking for a threat wands in hand.
Nefertani: ok good bye see ya also make this look like a robbery so it won't be pinned on you and remove your magical signature like I did
Sirius  choked  and stopped  breathing  for a second  while  remus looked  shocked.
Cedric  looked concerned and amused  but when he opened his mouth to probably ask what I did.
Fire dancer: 16
And as Marvolo went over to Harry they locked eyes and bonded.
By the time we had 30 minutes left of class I was done with all my homework and was tapping my foot impatiently  , because  I wanted to return to our rooms to see if anything  had been found out about how Severus got poisoned.
Nefertani: he also inherited a little of my metamorphagus ability he can change his hair color and length
I was so stress I triggered my next change,  so now my hair was black with blonde highlights and had wings...fairy wings instead of my kitsune tail.
Fred: I was waiting  for harry to come to bed .
Harry: Speaking  of mates...I got  5 more today
After  I shared it some of my mates were unnerved while others were proud.
Draco  groaned behind me in misery but both of the boys only had eyes on me.
I sighed and answered all his questions and before he asked for more I explained what happened in the past couple of days what he is to Harry and how he fulfilled the prophecy by acting on it and that it may not even be real. And he himself admitted with much scorn he lost his mind after Making the fourth Horcrucx. I then swore a vow to him and he did the same about not hurting Harry and my family as well as no longer committing genocide and if he wanted to change the wizarding world to claim his lordship and do something about either politically or behind the scenes. ( Don't worry Voldemort simply wants better rights for creatures and complete separation from muggles meaning taking muggleborns from families or giving families the option of taking a vow to never purposefully or accidentally expose or hurt the wizarding world)
I give her a quick kiss as a apology
This is going to be a long day.
Helios: it would be nice to talk to other-
But Neville  didn't  stay long for he had his own transfiguration class to attend  and headed back the way he came.
Yes it's TRUE we no longer had a ghost as a teacher but a young man that was more interactive having us play games and have us do reenactments of a time before the founders.
Draco sighs: I also felt the strain  of being away from you love but that doesn't mean you should jump me as soon as you see me.
I pretty much expected  that and spent  the rest of the night close by them or scenting them (much to Severus's embarrassment).
He then went over to rabastian and started playing with him since he was by himself (draco and Neville playing with a jack in the box with Sirius.
The commentator who I recognized as the Twins friend Lee Jordan had all of me and my friends and Stitches half way through because of his personality and jokes that often led to Mcgonagall berating him.
A nurse comes in at that moment to give Sirius a new regiment to help him get back to full health .
Nefertani: 9:40  I'm going to go get the kids and go to the guest dinning room to meet up with the Longbottoms until they return home..the Aurors were there all night and day so everything should be fixed .. mainly
Theo who was sitting next to me sunk down into his chair,  I took his hand into mine and whispered to him how ot wasn't his fault and that it's ok.
Sirius: thank you so much .. for everything
Neville: I told you Draco it would be unwise to bet with  the twins -
Voldemort  simply  hissed:
Guard: Alice Longbottom is here with her son for the play date with the prince
Though some of the death eaters that were on the wizenmagot were not targeted due to us needing their votes. Meaning  Marvolo is controlling them for his own gain.
Confused  I spoke up "what are you guys looking at"?
Nefertani: and you guys are still his godparents should anything happen to me and my wife if that's ok with you-
I opened my eyes and saw I was the first one up ... until I looked down and saw adorable green eyes looking up at me confused. But what was concerning was the darkness that was seeping from Harrys scar. I frowned which was really idiotic because Harry started to cry. I quickly picked him up "shush shhhh baby it's ok , it must be scary when you wake up with a stranger frowning at you" . "Mama!!" He whined at this Elisa awoke groaning "what time is it?" "I don't know"I replied picking Harry up and getting out of bed." Let's get some breakfast ." I'm coming Elisa said as I threw on a shirt  while holding the baby with one hand. After I finished I walked into the dinning Hall and put Harry in the highchair that was sitting by my chair. Harry looked at me and said" Nana?" Yes you can have a banana Harry I said . He got a focused look on his face for a 15 month old "oo you" I smiled and said" you can call me tata" a second after I said this Lippy laid sliced banana on his tray with cereal and Elisa walked in the room without a hair out of place."I'll have toast and eggs Lippy thank you" Elisa Said "I would like the same with bacon oh! And I want the eggs sunny side up" I said. Lippy popped away and came back with our food. We all ate quietly except Harry who was painting with his cereal. "Elisa after breakfast we should get ready to go to gringotts ". "But what about Harry we can't just waltz into diagonal ally with him upon hip?" Elisa Said "I'll just put an illusion on him and also, love this morning when I looked at Harrys aura I saw darkness leaking from his scar so I'll also have to have that checked out too" I replied "Tani do you think..." Elisa asked to which I replied "it is a possibility". We finished breakfast then went into our bedroom to dress for the day. I wore black and gold robes with my crest upon the back and pulled my hair into a man bun then put my cobra crown on my brow. Elisa wore light pale blue robes with silver that brought out her eyes with silver diadem with sapphires. And Harry wore a onesie that said "I'm not a hippogriff but I fly like one" and I put a glamour on him that made him look like he had blonde hair and gold eyes. "Madwe" Harry said as he reached for Elisa she picked him up and held him close "is everyone ready?" I asked my wife nodded so I held them both in my arms and shadow travelled straight to in front of gringotts.
"Now let's get started! Gloves on!" She commanded and we all put on leather  hide gloves and were led into the green house. Yay it's time to get dirty ...
I shadow travelled as fast as I could to the living room and what i saw was a death eater reunion.
Remus growling at the locket: I don't think you should touch it Nefertani it is making my instincts go haywire..
...so should I even suspect you aren't following through with my son I will have you executed and wear your skins to warn off any others with impure thoughts...do I make myself clear?" My father said voice almost gaining a shape like quality.
"Mmmm cub this smells delicious." Sirius  said  as he kissed me on the cheek and sat down at table  along with Remus. While Severus looked  at me incredulously  before sitting as well.
When I realized he was
The weather soon turned cold, as November started along with the quidditch season.
Rabastian: THEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH OUR LORDS DEATH!! And you helped them escape!! So you will die ..but not before you are too far gone to even begin to beg for death
Elisa: it wasn't a option fire dancer
Fred "Well spoken dear kitten , and since we are mentioning snitches "-
"Draco I have a perfect idea! Let's go down to the common room to talk to flint and convince him to change tactics!" I mentally applauded myself for solving the issues while Draco stared at me in horror before he snapped back to reality.
Adrian and Macus seemed to have a silent conversation when Draco spoke up.
Marvolo along with my Tata found him after doing a sweep through the houses of ministry officials they were seeking to have thrown in Azkaban due to their dirty dealings .One of them being the late Mr.Crouch,  who was sent to a newly  reformed Azkaban prison(that no longer had dementors) along with many other members of parliament that were hurting our society.
The dark dreary hallways were given windows to let in light and were painted bright or neutral colors, the old furniture was replaced by comfortable and open settings. The rooms that held cursed items were clean and clear I teared up a little just looking at it.
Voldemort pov
And we danced round and round , spinning , being picked up and my favorite part when Rabastian actually flipped me on his arm!
He simply smiled and thanked me while rubbing my head before tossing me to Adrian like i was a sack of meat!
Sirius grumbles
As soon as we got off The train Fred and George (who were surprised I could tell them apart after only knowing them for a couple hours) had a hard time leaving me until my dad showed up. Then after hearing the situation promised that they would see me later and said that they needed to have a nice chat and dragged them away. Then a giant was calling for first years and I recognized him as hagrid the groundskeeper and we followed him on to boats that could carry four students across the lake. I got in with Neville,Draco,and Theo and as soon as we turned the corner to see the castle all of our breaths caught  in awe. I could feel the magic in the very air it was.. intoxicating . After we got off the boats we were dropped off with a Stern woman with her hair pulled into a bun.
Hufflepuff
" Draco I share you distress  over this absurd rule discriminating against  us poor first years who are deprived of using familiar safe brooms replaced with unfamiliar ,dangerous brooms. "
Nefertani: I really need to start having Elisa getting you in the morning..
Kreacher tried to fight the order from Sirius which made Sirius's temper rise
Nefertani: without all the legal jargon it's basically a contract where you will give us potion ingredients (that we will pay for) while we send some workers to your greenhouses to learn how to care for the plants so I can use my own land to grow our own  potion ingredients. As well as allowing you a percentage of the benefits of the results of experiments done with the plants. The official document is right here.
Nefertani: that's right now I'm going to go get your brother dressed real quick while rosy helps you guys ok. So when I come back we will be ready for breakfast.
TO CLARIFY MORE ON THE OC CHARACTERS:
- his angry stare lessens in dislike,  while Adrian eyebrows raise-
The Flint's and the Malfoy's shaking their heads at our happy yet sappy reunions until Draco himself scooted us all out of the room so he could greet the oncoming guests and no one could see us acting so embarrassing .
Harry: Tata woo dat?
the door to the room. and below what Nefertani looks like just darker skin
I left my friend's and mates behind after explain8i was going to congratulate my new mates, as I headed down to the pitch.
I went into the room and it was a large library and I followed the taint of the Horcrucx to a book
George said joyfully
" I missed  you , I know it's only been a couple of hours  but I need you to save me from my own house! They are so
We arrived and walked past the wand check in
Nefertani: do you swear to represent your people to all ?
Remus  : of course  harry we can do that-
When I reached my family that was waiting behind the heavy doors that led to the crowd. I was blindsided by how lucky I was with what I had for they were beyond beautiful. Elisa was wearing a dark blue and silver gown that made her eyes pop and a diadem with a sapphire jewel.Maleen was wearing a pink dress with orange touches with a flower diadem with a green emerald, Helios was wearing a red shirt with black pants and red cloak lined In purple with a crown that looked like it was made out of iron thorns and Little Harry was wearing a dark green robe with a black cloak with a crooked crown on his head.
