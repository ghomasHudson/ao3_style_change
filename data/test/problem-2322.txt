Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter
“A young Death Eater,” Hadrian looked pointedly at Severus, “heard the first half of the prophecy and reported it to his Master immediately.”
Her Lord chuckled, the deep sound soothing her. “That sounds like a truly hilarious sight, my love. Oh, to be a fly on the wall in the next Order meeting,” he sighed. Luna knew that her Lord would most likely be asking his father for the memory at a later date, and that Tom would most likely find it all just as amusing.
Tom offered up no explanations when five imploring looks were suddenly directed at him. A few moments of the deceptively innocent look plastered on the Dark Lord’s face caused Hadrian to continue after muttering about stupid secretive dark lords under his breath.
Rita looked intrigued and Hadrian took a moment to see what Draco, Lucius and Severus thought. All three men looked slightly pale at the mention of Harry Potter’s less than stellar past but amused at the interaction between Hadrian and Skeeter. They could see Dumbledore’s name was about to be dragged through the mud and they were excited.
Draco didn’t know why but there was a prickling behind his eyes as Harry spoke, understanding him on a level he didn’t think anyone ever would. He startled slightly when a hand gripped his knee underneath the table, giving it a quick, comforting squeeze before moving away again. His blood was rushing through his ears as he fought to keep the blush away from his cheeks. Curse his pale skin.
The wolf knelt before his new Lord, head bowed, posture relaxed and Tom was impressed. He knew Lupin was a dominant wolf, yet here he was submitting to another, a vampire no less. He must have immense trust in Hadrian to be so exposed in with him, especially with his intended mate present.
gone the way the man wanted it to. “There is so much I want to say to you old man, but I think I’ll just leave you with just this; you will absolutely get what’s coming to you. I’ve made sure of it.”
For those who don’t know, the Wizengamot is split into three distinct parties; the Light Alliance, the Dark Alliance and the Neutral Alliance. The Chief Warlock is chosen from the heads of the three parties, depending on which has the most individual votes in their Alliance. The Light Alliance have maintained the majority since the downfall of You-Know-Who in 1981 and their head Albus Dumbledore has held the Chief Warlock position all this time.
“Now, I’ve saved the best for last.” Harry said dryly, and the greedy glint returned to the eyes of the remaining members of the room. “Molly Weasley, I leave to you thanks in abundance for the food. You unwittingly saved my life that summer after first year, so cheers.”
“The bee is making a mess of his hive, my Lord. He’s surrounded by nargles and doesn’t know how to get rid of them,” she replied.
“Potter, what the actual
Dumbledore gets another shock, Luna and Draco talk and Tom really needs to have better control over his Death Eaters.
Charlie opened the letter and gasped in shock. The parchment fluttered down to the table when Charlie abandoned it in order to tear into the wrapping around his gift. Hadrian watched as his eyes widened, mouth agape, an expression crossed between awe and childish excitement adorning his face. Sat in front of him was a sleek black egg, nestled comfortably in the discarded brown wrapping paper.
As they made their way to their seats at the left of the table, Remus stiffened beside him. Sirius jumped slightly when the werewolf grabbed his elbow and hissed his name. He turned to Remus with a questioning gaze and the man inclined his head in the direction of the stranger. “That man smells -,” he hesitated and Sirius saw something akin to hope shining in his best friends eyes, “Sirius, he smells like
I've decided that, because you're all so lovely and I'm not nearly active enough in my comments, I'm going to be posting two chapters this weekend. One today and another on your regularly scheduled Sunday. This chapter has a bit more of the longterm plan rather than history in it so I hope you all like the direction this is heading.
“Now here’s where things get really interesting,” Hadrian said as the memory seemed to change, moving to a different moment of that dreaded night.
: Peverell Manor, Tom's Study)
Tom would forever treasure the memory of Lucius’ affronted look as Hadrian turned to the Malfoy Lord and told him, in the simplest terms, to ‘shove his weak protection up his ass because Draco wouldn’t need it,’ for as long as he lived. Enduring the irate blonde pacing his office for an hour after the event was well worth the entertainment. He’d often thanked his lucky stars that his horcrux was not some feeble-minded Light-aligned Dumbledore fanatic. It was much more entertaining this way.
Tom and Hadrian emerged into the sunlit alley after twenty minutes, money bags heavier and satisfied their names had sufficient time to travel the length of Diagon. “Do you fancy a spot of lunch, my dear?” Tom said after glancing at his pocket watch and noticing the time. Hadrian nodded his agreement and the pair walked towards a small restaurant directly opposite Gringotts. It was a favourite of Hadrian’s he discovered the summer before his third year, and it served the most wonderful Ravioli the young Vampire had ever had.
Draco, Lucius and Severus were sitting on a couch off to the side, watching intently and likely wondering why they were included within this discussion. Hadrian’s Wolves were scattered around the room, eyeing Skeeter intently, constantly on watch while their Lord was in the presence of a potential enemy. Tom stood just behind Hadrian, his hand on his shoulder and a powerful glamour changing his features ever so slightly to be closer to Hadrian’s. Not that it was particularly difficult to begin with, they were already very similar.
Anyway, sorry for the long wait. I know it's not a Sunday but close enough, yeah? This chapter is long and I hope it is everything you've been waiting so patiently for xx
“Luna Pandora Lovegood,” Harry said and the whole room recognised the extremely fond look in Harry’s eyes. From the shocked looks on the opposite side of the table, Draco concluded very few people realised how close Harry was to the Lovegood girl. “I really do love you Luna, you wonderful human, and I have also established you as a Friend of the House Potter. There is something immensely important that I need you to do for me and I know you are the only person who ever could. I need you to look after Hedwig for me, she loves you almost as much as I do so you should get along fine.”
The tense silence was broken as Draco walked back into the room followed by Lucius and, surprisingly, Tom. Hadrian looked at Draco with a raised eyebrow and the blonde blushed once again. He was finding it harder and harder to ignore the flow of blood under Draco’s pale skin, especially when he blushed so easily under Hadrian’s stare.
Severus was tired.
“Oh yeah?” Ronald said, turning his distaste onto Hadrian. “How do you know? You think you know my best mate better than me, do you? He hated these bastards!” He stopped short, “Who are you anyway?”
Hadrian watched as the room’s occupants collected their belongings and knew he would treasure the memory of Dumbledore’s affronted and confused expression for a very long time. He imagined Tom would find this equally enjoyable and vowed to show him the memory when he returned home.
“I’m convinced Dumbledore had some interference, and knew exactly what was going on in the Shack, because after being attacked by a werewolf and ambushed by over a hundred Dementors, Dumbledore sent me and Granger back in time to save a Hippogriff and an Azkaban escapee. Both of whom could have been saved by Albus-I-hold-a-position-on-every-board-imaginable-Dumbledore with little effort on his part. In fact, I have all but confirmed that Sirius wasn’t allowed to be free in Dumbledore’s eyes because it meant I would legally have a closer blood relative than the Dursley’s.”
Dumbledore opened his mouth to soothe the tension in the room, probably with some meaningless words about love and forgiveness, when a scathing look from Director Ragnok stopped him and he let the will continue. Sirius thought Dumbledore should be glad of the silence. Anything he said would no doubt condemn him further.
“Ginevra Molly Weasley, I leave you this: I never would have married you. Even if you weren’t a gold digging whore, I’m so
“You should be thankful my Little Moon decided to drop by Avery.” Her Lord’s voice rang out through the large room and a lone figure standing before the mass of cloaks behind him sank to his knees. Avery, then. “She has likely saved your life. You know I am not one for mercy when people are stupid enough to question me.”
“Now that we’ve all settled down,” Director Ragnok started from the head of the table, his eyes roving around the odd assembly of people before him. “We shall proceed with the reading of the Will of one Harry James Potter-Black.”
Barty smiled at that thought. He really was proud of his position in his Lord’s ranks. Though Neville might seem to be Hadrian’s right hand, Barty was there first and he had the complete trust and appreciation of his Lord. He had helped his Lord when no one else would, even before he had sworn his loyalty. He really did love Hadrian and would follow him through anything.
Remus put a hand on his arm as Sirius sat back down, staring intently at the table in front of him. Not many people knew the extent of his relationship with Harry, that of father and son, and too many people would be willing to take advantage of it if they did. He had to play the devastated godfather for a little while longer and besides, he wanted to know what Harry had left him. It must be important if he didn’t just give it to him in person.
“I can still confiscate items when we get back to Hogwarts, brat,” Severus said to the bane of his existence. “And give you detention.” He added just because he could.
As if planned, Hedwig chose that moment to swoop down from somewhere in the rafters and land on Luna’s shoulder, nipping her ear affectionately and settling in for the time being. A small smile was on Hadrian’s face, unnoticed by the other occupants of the room, and Draco’s heart stuttered. It was such an uncomposed expression on the young Lord’s face, something he hadn’t seen since the summer began, and Draco swore it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
Hadrian nodded and began pacing a loose circle around the kneeling man. A low latin chant followed him that Tom couldn’t quite make out and would have to ask Hadrian for later. The circle was made three times before Hadrian once again stood before his new subordinate. He placed a hand on Lupin’s shoulder and spoke his final lines “Let Magic acknowledge that I, Hadrian Corvus Peverell, Lord Thanatos, accept you, Remus John Lupin as a Wolf from this day until you should wish to leave my service.”
Draco saw the love reflected in Lupin’s eyes as he looked up at the image of Harry. He knew Hadrian hadn’t marked the werewolf yet and wondered whether he was waiting for his true loyalty to be revealed with this meeting.
Charlie looked up from the egg and stared disbelievingly at Ragnok. “Is this what I think it is?” he asked, his voice shaking just a little.
Hadrian smirked at the murderous looks he was receiving from not only Dumbledore but Granger and the three unsavoury Weasleys. He was so very pleased with this plan.
A discussion continues
Rita was pale and speechless and Hadrian could tell the moment she realised what he had implied. There were a few amusing moments of indecision on Rita’s part before she worked up the courage to ask, “Are you going to
(See the end of the chapter for
“A few, Severus,” Hadrian finally replied, sending a small smile to the man when he glared at Hadrian for the vague answer. “Most of the DA is now marked by me, if you must know. Those loyal to Dumbledore, Weasley and Granger were left in the dark but everyone else has turned to our cause. A few have graduated, a few Order members and I have a few in my sights for this year.”
Hadrian drew another memory from his temple and a painfully boring looking muggle street appeared at the end of his wand. Hagrid, Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall stood outside number four Privet Drive oblivious to the fact that baby Harry was wide awake.
“Ah, Rita,” Hadrian said with a smile that promised nothing good, “so good of you to join us.”
Luna leaned back into her Lord and whispered in his ear. All eyes were on her and the way her Lord was making small circles with his fingers, slowly running up her thighs.
“What is there opinion of Dark Magic?” he asked and the Lady Malfoy’s eyes lit up in a most unexpected way.
“Potter, you’re missing it!”
“Right,” said Harry noncommittedly. “I think I’ll take a leaf out of Malfoy’s book and grab a drink, then.”
Nate, the umpires, and the coach for the Pandas went to home plate to discuss the ground rules, and the team finished warming up. Nate had prepared them thoroughly over the last week; they really just needed to make sure their muscles were stretched and their arms were loose.
“I do,” Draco admitted.
“No, Gin, don’t bring that up,” Harry groaned. “It’s nearly the holiday; I haven’t even started properly thinking about them yet.”
Taken aback by the pure venom in her voice, Harry wondered if it would be possible for her to find forgiveness for Draco in her heart.
Immediately, Draco snatched his hand away from his mother and stepped back. He furiously regained his composure and lashed out at his mother. “And what’s that supposed to mean? Did you not even believe half the things you led me to believe were true?”
“I’ll grab the glass bottles; you’ll pour the finished potion.” Granger directed before leaving to grab the appropriate flasks. Draco glanced around the room and noticed how there wasn’t another pair with more than three-quarters of the recipe completed. He smiled. Granger was strangely companionable. Maybe this could all work out for the better.
Harry watched Malfoy go, looking as proud and arrogant as always when they attended Hogwarts before the War. Why would Malfoy just automatically assume that he was untrustworthy? Harry had been trying to convey that they shouldn’t sleep together yet both because the relationship was still too new and he wasn’t sure whether or not it was going to last past the summer. Well, that one was certainly up in the air. This was exactly why he’d been right to wait: one fight and Malfoy would just walk away from everything.
Harry and Ron Apparated to Headquarters, which was the kind of task they could practically do in their sleep by now, but he botched the landing, tumbling into one of the potted plants placed directly by the walkway and knocking it over.
“When I find the Pureblood heir to the Malfoy family in
“Er – we’ve got to get going.”
Potter whipped out his wand and was about to hex the Weasel into next week, but Draco stepped in front of him and placed his hands on Potter’s shoulders. Hoping he wasn’t the one about to be hexed instead, Draco said, “Leave it. Either they’ll come around or they won’t."
Harry gripped Draco’s wet blonde hair, delicately pulling him close enough to embrace. Their arms and legs intertwined, and soon Draco couldn’t tell where he ended and Harry began. As their kisses started to grow more and more heated, Draco tugged off Harry’s t-shirt and started lightly sucking marks into Harry’s neck.
“She’ll never have to know it was me,” Draco said. “You won’t tell, will you, Potter?”
“I was,” says Malfoy noncommittally.
“Wake up, Draco,” Pansy scoffs. “That’s how it’s been since day one. These morons are all here because they can’t get

’s most cozy interview room, but he had his doubts about that, especially after they passed an adorable kitchenette with a surplus of treacle tart.
“How long are you expected to wait?” Ron said. “I’ll never understand how much leniency you’re giving him.”
“Don’t worry about it,” said Draco, “I’ll, uh, catch up with them later. Don’t you have a kid to find?”
“Makes sense,” he nods. “I learned to cook when I was a kid, but never really enjoyed it.
Waving a hand impatiently, Malfoy shrugged him off. “Minor detail, Potter. Believe me, you’ll have your work cut out for you.”
first. And the idea of going to this brunch makes me feel like I wouldn’t be doing that.”
“Wait, didn’t we miss the part of the conversation where you try to convince me that this is a bad idea, that he’s not going to come out even if I asked, that I’m setting myself up for disaster?”
With that, Hermione dragged him back to bed—without letting him finish his tea—so he couldn’t disturb her anymore, and even though Draco still didn’t think he could possibly doze off, they ended up sleeping in until early afternoon.
“Probably not treacle tart.”
"Are you decent, Malfoy?"
“Malfoy…”
“Of course,” Draco said. He went to his and Hermione’s shared room and retrieved his own coat, a British-style double breasted button down in wool, and then the coat Harry always borrowed (stole) from him, brown, rugged, and woodsy. Harry’d missed it, and he said as much when Draco handed it over.
“But you aced your entrance exams, and now that you’re familiar with the office, I think you’re ready. You’ll be with me tomorrow.”
“Yes?”
“Hardy har har,” said Harry, distracted by the head umpire coming over to find Nate. “I’m just going to, yeah…” he trailed off, looking frantically around for Cale.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“Ew, Potter!” Draco howled. “Your breath is rancid. Get up and brush your teeth, you savage.”
“You’re surprisingly insightful,” Draco notes.
“I’m on it right now,” admitted Draco, after he’d checked his watch.
“My father,” Draco responds rather predictably. “He taught me the classic Malfoy dueling style, but he was nothing if not practical, so he made me learn this way as well. I have to say, it’s been so much more useful than the traditional method.”
Draco laughed at that, deep and throaty, and Harry finally felt like the earth was set back on its proper axis again. There still was the issue of Ron’s animosity and potential Weasley disapproval along with the media frenzy, but with Draco back by his side, Harry felt like he was ready to tackle all the problems in the world.
“You know this doesn’t change us,” Hermione said. “We might not live together anymore, but we’ll always be here for each other.” He leaned in for a hug, unable to speak. “To answer your question,” she said, “I’m leaving at the end of the month. I’m finishing my capstone project early and starting my apprenticeship this summer.”
They sat quietly for another thirty seconds, Draco enjoying Harry stroking his back. Draco’s comfortable silence was interrupted by Harry exclaiming, “It could work, too,” he said excitedly. “We could rent a flat in Hogsmeade and walk to school or Floo in.”
“Of course that’s why you did it,” Harry said with a gleam in his eye. “It had nothing to do with the fact that you
“Patience,” Harry chided, smiling at the thought of Draco experiencing the same bliss he’d felt before. But then again, Draco hadn’t hesitated to tease
“Wanker,” he said, crawling out of his cocoon enough to flip his middle finger up at Harry.
Draco tried not to feel melancholy at the fact that Potter would never want him this way, and focused on the fact that he would be reunited with Potter in just ten short minutes.
“See?” Potter said. “Let’s get going then, George is waiting.” He grabbed Draco’s hand, to Granger and the Weasel’s utter astonishment, and strode off towards Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes.
“So why is it still hurting? I know you’re better at casting spells than that, Malfoy. Unless you haven’t fully healed it for sentimental reasons,” Hermione smirked.
They followed Ginny over to the picnic table and picked up a paper plate. They served themselves from the food platters, opting to sit close together on the benches under Warming Charms as to not freeze. Though it was only November, it was already quite cold outside.
“That’s correct,” Narcissa admitted, resigned. “I was content with your father’s wish to bring you up in accordance to his beliefs on, ahem, certain matters.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
Draco looked back to Otarres, who had been watching Draco take in his office. “It’s a great big mess, huh? I meant to clean it up at the beginning of this week, but then I gave your class a writing exercise and then
He’d always known that Draco and Hermione were both extremely intelligent. It only made sense that they’d be able to communicate on a different plane than he and Draco could. “You don’t have to tell me,” Harry said, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice. “We’ve been friends for seven years.”
Swallowing his pride, Harry stretched out his hand to Malfoy and murmured, “How’s it going? My name’s Harry…” he trailed off, unsure what exactly to say to his former rival.
“I want you,” whispered Draco. “I’ve always wanted you, anyway, and now I finally know you feel the same way. I don’t know if I could forgive myself if I let you slip away again.”
“But I still love him,” Draco mumbled. “When I’m with him, no one else’s opinion mattered.”
“Yes,” Harry breathed, willing his muscles to stay relaxed. “I think I’d like to lie on my back.”
“Appreciate, would you Potter, that this isn’t easy for me to explain!” said Malfoy. “I like being touched. I suppose it makes me feel closer to you.”
“Are you asking me to co-publish with you?” Draco couldn’t quite keep the surprise out of his voice.
Ron frowned. “‘Course I do.” He took another giant sip, choking as Coke went up his nose, Harry pounding him on the back. “Why do you ask?” he managed a minute later, still recovering.
“And girls,” conceded Nate.
It was risky to be sure, but what was life without taking chances? Draco had always calculated his every last move, whether he was at home or in school, but maybe sometimes certain situations required a leap of faith. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. His thoughts were interrupted as he rammed into the edge of the glass table that was taking up practically half of their living room, bruising his shin in the process.
Slightly chastised, they gave him guilty faces that still had the traces of smiles. Inwardly, Harry sighed. Malfoy’s girls looked much more disciplined out there on the field. He corrected them seriously, but it was obvious that he was fair across the board. Harry could already tell his girls respected him.
“Goodnight,” said McGonagall kindly. She swept off down the corridor, and as he watched her retreating back, Harry suddenly decided to go for it and ask the questions that had been bugging him since the beginning of term.
,” he said aloud, hoping that his lamentable household charm would hold. As shards came zooming out of the floor’s crevices, Harry’s attention was caught by what appeared to be a loose floorboard. He reached over and attempted to wrest it back into place, but it was easily knocked askew. Underneath, there was a stack of letters. Harry drew them out of the hole, wrinkling his nose at the strong scent of honeysuckle as he noticed how the space had been charmed to protect the parchment from the elements.
“Aggressiveness,” amended Harry. “Come on, let’s get back to it. Maybe when the flying memos attack today, they’ll put me out of my misery once and for all.”
“High five, mate,” Harry said, putting up his hand. Nate eagerly slapped it, and Harry noticed how his eyes quickly flashed to Cale as he did so.
Hermione was gesturing for Harry to slow down and had placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, but if he stopped now, there was no way he could get the rest out. “I’m sorry that I didn’t try harder to mend this rift between us, because you’re two of the most important people to me in the whole world, and Draco doesn’t overshadow either of you. He’s just another facet of my life now, that’s all.”
“Draco’s techniques are so not going to be transferable to you,” Harry snorts. “You’ve got completely different personalities.”
“That was amazing,” Draco whispered in a rare moment of vulnerability.
“Alright, Malfoy,” he conceded. “But I can’t promise I’ll be any good at it. It’s not like I’ve ever been with anyone other than Ginny.”
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Without pause, Father stepped forward and neatly backhanded Draco across the cheek.
He wondered at her motivations. “I concur,” Draco replied. “Any particular reason why?”
Malfoy sighed enormously, to let Harry know just how burdensome the question was. He wiped the blood off his nose with the back of his hand, looking down at the dirt. “Do you know anything about the Future Promise Legislation?”
DECEMBER 1999
Draco smiled. “Actually, Potter, I do. I don’t suppose you’ve really seen much of the world outside of Hogwarts and Diagon Alley?”
Harry threw a quick goodbye over his shoulder and left Hermione there at the Great Lake. Initially, he had no idea where to find Draco, but then Harry realized he’d gone into the Forest. Draco absolutely despised the Forest, and he’d have wanted to go somewhere where he felt safe. Harry strode towards Dumbledore’s tomb, and finally found Malfoy sitting in the exact same place he had been the last time they were together in this clearing.
, and now they want us to
. It was as if Harry was seeing him in slow motion. His black pants were perfectly tailored to accentuate his slim hips and round arse, and the white button down he had on revealed the smooth, supple skin on his chest. Harry was surprised that he had the sleeves rolled up to three-quarters’ length, and if he didn’t know what the Dark Mark was, he’d have even thought of Malfoy’s tattoo as attractive too.
“That sounds perfect, actually.”
“The situation is different,” Draco said, “Because, as I stated, he’s still an insufferable prick. How has someone who’s betrayed my trust and contaminated himself in the process changed at all for the better?”
Potter kissed him again, a little more passionately this time. Desire like he’d never felt before took control of Draco, causing him to pull Potter on top of him.
Hermione slammed on the brakes. “Is that them? Is that one of their cars?”
“Hello, Potter,” said Draco.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
Draco cringed. Though his father was not yet dead, Lucius Malfoy would be rolling in his grave if he heard his wife and son having this conversation. Draco tried to remember that he owed his father no loyalty or allegiance.
Feeling slightly faint, Harry stammers, “You mean…Voldemort…”
“Who’d want to vacation here?” said Draco under his breath. “It’s bloody miserable-”
"It's nothing. I'll see you tomorrow,” said Harry, appreciating the gesture. "Wear the jeans again, yeah?"
Harry shrugged. “I'm starting to not mind him, actually. He apologized to me the night of the Final Battle, and I think we’re becoming friends.”
Silence.
, Malfoy.”
Hermione carried their teas back to the breakfast table, cringing. “You’re a sadist, you know,” she said derisively.
. Throwing off his covers, he Apparated into the main sitting room of Malfoy Manor. The wards were still keyed to let him through, so Harry took that as a good sign.
“Why are we talking about dueling and Malfoy in the same sentence? Are you summoning him to the Club for a contest, where you’ll wash the floor with him in front of your adoring audience?” Ron asks hopefully.
“I know,” Hermione said, turning around so that she and Draco were face to face. “But look at the distribution of the other students in the Mastery. Nearly a quarter are studying Everyday Potionry hoping to become famous by making themselves a household name, and another half are doing Offensive Potionry because they want to work for the Aurors.” She paused derisively. “There’s a more than a few studying Latin and going into Translation Potionry, and there’s those, like you, who are going into Medical Potionry, and a few who made their own specialization, like me. Why someone would want to spend their time perfecting the already-effective Mold-A-Way Potion when they could be doing something meaningful is beyond me, Draco.”
There was another motivation for Draco’s excitement over seeing Potter on Saturday. He felt like they had spent enough time getting to know each other now and wanted to try and move things forward. If Potter’s lingering glances and the fond looks he had on his face upon seeing Draco were any indication, he felt much the same way.
It isn’t until Malfoy reaches Harry’s privates that he comes back to the present moment. “Malfoy,” he croaks, unable to communicate his discomfort.
JUNE 1999
Hermione huffed. “I shouldn’t have to remind you that Order of the Phoenix was only created as a
Again, there was silence, but then came a quiet “Potter,” so silent it was almost imperceptible. He brushed Malfoy’s hair back in a question, coming closer in anticipation. Finally Malfoy whispered, “I can’t—”
To say Harry had understood why Draco chose to return back home with his father would be an understatement, so as Draco approached, Harry regarded him with scarcely-contained disdain.
“I regret doing that,” she said. “Even though our split was probably necessary. He didn’t understand what I meant when I attempted to communicate how I felt, and I didn’t try harder to get through to him.” She tore a loose thread off one of the dish towels, the only sign of her discomfort.
Harry and Ron arrive in France.
, until it almost felt like we were one being.”
Draco momentarily lost the ability to speak. The man had several facial piercings on his lips, nose, eyebrow, and his ears were huge with large black circles. Draco had seen some of his peers walk around with those, but they didn’t seem that popular. He had on a T-shirt and shorts, and tattoos covered his chest, arms, and legs. Suddenly, instead of nervous anticipation, Draco felt panicked. He wasn’t going to look like that when he was done, was he? Was getting one body piercing the gateway drug into full-scale body art?
with him. How he managed to ruin so many of Albus’ plans from beyond the grave was quite frankly astounding. He was beginning to think Harry had been a great deal smarter than anyone had given him credit for. He had certainly managed to get Rita Skeeter on his side, something Albus had never been able to achieve, even at the height of his power.
Draco had decided to stay at Peverell Manor for the indefinite future in order to familiarise himself with the people he would no doubt be spending his seventh year at Hogwarts with. It was no question Hadrian Peverell would get sorted into Slytherin and therefore, Draco was sure to be demoted from his position of Slytherin’s King. He had made his way to the top of his House on a combination of his Father’s reputation with the Dark and his own ability to consistently be in the top three academically in his year. He was proud of his position and would give it up for no one.
Draco locked eyes with the object of his thoughts as he took a sip of his perfectly brewed Earl Grey tea. The slight twitching of the vampire’s lips made Draco’s stomach do flips and he knew that his obsession with Harry Potter would undoubtedly follow onto Hadrian Peverell. It seemed, to everyone else in the room at least, that Hadrian Peverell’s obsession with Draco Malfoy would continue in full force, as emerald green eyes stayed locked on the blonde even after he dropped his focus back onto his breakfast.
“You both will accompany me to meet Hadrian’s inner circle tomorrow,” the Dark Lord said to Lucius and Draco. “They will be here between ten and eleven, we shall meet in the sitting room before then.”
I haven't quite worked out Narcissa yet. If you have any ideas let me know :)
Albus Dumbledore was panicked. Harry Potter was dead and this was not at all what he had planned. Damn that imbecile Dursley and his undoubtedly heavy hand. He had warned the walrus of a muggle what would happen should he go too far with the boy and now here Albus was, sitting in his office trying to contain what would probably be a national crisis, all because the useless oaf couldn’t keep his fists to himself. The Dursley’s should be glad they’d gone on a holiday to Greece, if they ever came back to England they’d face the full wrath of Albus Dumbledore.
“He still needs someone to ground him.” Draco was struck by the meaning of the twins words. Lovegood was Hadrian’s donor, not his mate. Did that mean that Draco still had a chance? He could only hope, right?
“Well yeah, but it never would have worked as one.”
The trial of Sirius Black, Dumbles gets manipulated and another Black is introduced to the story
Charlie Weasley stared at Hadrian wide eyed for a moment, his hand absently stroking the smooth exterior of the dragon egg before him. “Is it alive?” he asked finally and seemed to both relax and tense in anticipation with Hadrian’s nod.
I know now this all looks extremely suspicious and I can’t help wonder whether tonight’s fire had something to do with my article this morning. Someone out there didn’t want Harry Potter spilling his secrets and took matters into their own hands. Trust me when I say this dear readers, Mr Potter’s life was being controlled by someone and I won’t stop until I can give you the truth. Until then, join me in taking a moment to remember all that Harry James Potter has done for Wizarding Britain and praying that justice will come for this boy who was taken from us too young.
“Pettigrew had this stupidly insane thought that, if he portkeyed me to the Dark Lord he would be handsomely rewarded and I would end up dead. So he snuck into Hogwarts, charmed the triwizard cup into a portkey and, when Cedric and I took the cup, we were transported to the graveyard near Tom’s muggle relatives house. He has wards there that alert him to people trespassing on his land and ended up meeting us there. That wasn’t before the stupid rat came and killed poor Cedric.” Hadrian’s face was impassive, but Barty remembered how distraught his young Lord was at the death of his friend. Cedric was an unnecessary death and Lord Thanatos did not condone such a thing at the best of times, let alone when they’re possible followers.
“We shall see, brat. I might find a way to kill you just so you can’t annoy me for all eternity.” The hint of amusement in Tom’s eyes told him the Dark Lord was joking. Hadrian knew Tom was really quite fond of the younger man, despite all his comments opposing this idea. “Is the creature inheritance responsible for the new look too?” Tom said, running an appreciative eye over the body of the Vampire in front of him.
He moved his face so close to Charlie’s their noses brushed, then leaned in to snarl in the redhead’s ear. “You may be a Dragon handler Charlie Weasley, but you so much as
“We do hope, my Lord -” one twin started.
He strolled down the hall towards Peverell and the Dark Lord, Lucius remaining by the front door to ‘guard’ the premises. Secretly, Severus mused Peverell only brought Lucius along to prove to the man who was in charge. It was amusing to think and Severus found himself glad this new Dark Lord was less inclined to torture people to prove his superiority, if only for the sanity of his friend.
The DMLE further shocked us when they announced an anonymous source had delivered none other than Peter Pettegrew himself to the Ministry’s doorstep last night.
Bellatrix is ponders, Hadrian laments being stuck with the most dramatic Dark Lord ever and things get blown up... quietly.
Luna skipped through the large hall, seemingly oblivious to the deeply oppressive magic suffocating the room and the group of black and forrest green cloaked people gathered there to listen to their Lords. She approached the dais and looked up at the black obsidian throne currently seating her Lord. Killing Curse green stark against golden skin and midnight black robes. His raven hair, tied at the base of his head with a forest green ribbon. Her Lord was as handsome as ever.
A crack sounded next to him and Padfoot looked up to see Remus had followed. He let out a pained whine at the thought of what he’d lost and turned pleading grey eyes to the werewolf at his side. Years of silent communication came through as Remus erected a small privacy ward around the two of them and Sirius transformed once again. Throwing his arms around Remus at the first chance he had and sobbing into the fabric of his tattered robes.
“That’s good news for your horcrux,” Hadrian said, giving the Dark Lord a pointed look as a smug smile graced the aristocratic features of the older man. “And now that there’s no known way to kill me, maybe you should stop being a prat and absorb the rest of them, oh immortal Dark Lord sir.”
Giving a low curtsy, then a reverent ‘My Lord’, Luna made her way up onto the dais and sat elegantly on her Lord’s lap. She could feel silver eyes piercing into her back and let a devious smirk grace her angelic features. A certain young Dragon was going to be very mad in a moment and Luna was revelling in the thought of it. Her Lord would never let anything happen to her. And maybe it would get the two of them together. Finally.
Hello all you lovely people. I had a bit of writers block for a moment there but I am finally back with something for you! I hope you're all doing okay in this isolation and urge you all to keep safe :)
Hope you enjoy this chapter. I know it's kinda wordy but it should get better as the story progresses and we start getting into some actual plot.
Harry paused for a moment and looked around the room. Hadrian had felt very dramatic while recording this and thanked Merlin Tom wasn’t here to see his display. He would be too proud and Hadrian would never hear the end of it.
Let me know what you think of the Mark?!
“And exactly how inclined are you to believe that, Rita darling?” Hadrian asked, relishing in the sneer that crossed the reporters face at her mention of the Headmaster.
“Hello, Draco,” Luna said, as she poured a second cup of tea. It was early still, the sun illuminating the room with a soft glow and bouncing off the silver blonde locks of the girl seated comfortably at the garden table in the room’s centre.
“I know it’s a little hard to believe, but after I got over myself a little, by about halfway through second year I guess, I realised that you and I aren’t all that different. We both had to wear masks the moment we set foot outside our homes and we never got the chance to show anyone who we really were. I would have liked to get that chance with you, Draco.”
(See the end of the chapter for
An owl entered through a high open window and dropped a letter on Albus’ desk. Curiosity brewed as the Headmaster noted the Gringotts seal on the back. He opened the letter hastily and sighed with relief: He was invited to attend Harry Potter’s will reading. Albus’ plans were safe. He had written and recorded a will for the boy when Harry had first started at Hogwarts in the event of a horrible accident within the walls of the Castle. There was always the possibility the boy wouldn’t make it through Albus’ end of year challenges and he needed to have all his bases covered.
Fred and George’s jaws were almost on the table as their eyes darted between Harry reading the will, and their Lord seated across from them.. Draco didn’t know who the Marauder’s were but the slight stiffening of his godfather’s body didn’t go unnoticed beside him. Draco would bet anything that Severus was currently thanking all the gods available that the Weasley twins had already graduated.

Arthur smiled slightly at that and, despite himself, Draco’s heart warmed. It was nice to know Harry had had some people that genuinely cared about him.
Damn Rita Skeeter too. Albus had no idea how she had managed to get the information out so fast. He had his contacts out looking for her location, but it seemed she’d had the foresight to protect herself before releasing her first article about Harry Potter and his package of ‘dangerous information’. Albus
The nervous tension coming off the young Vampire softened the Dark Lord’s eyes and caused a genuine, albeit small, smile to grace his handsome face. Hadrian had to physically stop himself from gaping at the rare sight, lest it never happen again. “Of course you can call them Hades, the safety of your followers is paramount. There will, of course, be rules they will have to follow and vows of secrecy they will have to take but, yes Hadrian. Send letters with the floo address tonight and I will open it tomorrow from 10-11am”
“This is the order Lord Potter-Black wrote his will in, Mr Weasley. You will cease these interruptions before I have to silence you.” Ragnok said with a Goblin grin that Ron instinctively flinched away from. Draco hid his smirk, this was all too amusing for him.
. Emerald green lit up in amusement at Draco’s stunned face, lack of Malfoy decorum oozing out of the young man, and Severus reared back in shock. Occlumency shields barely keeping the horror off his face.
Hadrian stroked the head of Tom’s Eagle Owl, Chronos, and smirked as he unfolded the latest edition of the
Lucius moved to sit in the chair next to Tom when Hadrian shook his head. “No need to get comfortable Lucius,” Hadrian rose and stalked across the room. “I’m sure Draco’s told you but I’ll reiterate; these two gentlemen here,” he gestured to the two, still slightly shaken Weasleys, “are in need of an upstanding pureblood family to learn from for the next month. I’ve volunteered the Malfoy’s for the job.”
It seems to me, dear readers, that a great many things are going to be changing in Wizarding Britain in the future. Will we benefit from these changes or not, we can only guess.
“But - ” Ron started, but cut off when Sirius stood, turning to face the youngest Weasley son, anger and devastation written across his features. It was his turn to act.
Those green eyes, so very like his mothers, snapped to him and bored straight into his soul. Severus’ companions gasped, incredulous looks on their faces. A small upward quirk of the young Lord’s mouth confirmed Severus’ suspicions and he lost all semblance of control, completely forgetting where he was and who was in his presence.

Hadrian moved forward in his seat, staring directly into the eyes of the reporter in front of him. His voice deepened and held a tone of finality that clearly stated he was giving an order.
long time as the one to uncover the dark side of the Light, and all you have to do is sign this little non-disclosure contract here and we can get to business.”
A loud, probably genuine laugh that seemed to increase the tension in the room rather than ease it.
His mouth was so close to the redhead’s pulse, fluttering frantically with the pure terror he was no doubt feeling at the moment, and Hadrian just
They finished their teas and Luna stood, offering her arm to Draco so they could walk together to the dining room. He placed her hand on the crook of his elbow like a proper gentleman and led her from the room. As they passed through the door, leaving the warm glow of the morning behind she turned to him. “Call me Luna,” she said and watched his eyes widen in surprise once again. “After all, we are going to be the
Weasley. Leaning over the still seated form of the former seeker and bracing his arms on the back of the couch.
Severus snorted at this, still apparently under the impression that Harry Potter was a spoilt, arrogant child who was loved and cared for in his home. Despite all that he’d already found out about Dumbledore’s deceit. An angry glare was sent his way from both Tom and, surprisingly to Severus, Barty as Hadrian said a quiet, “watch my life, Severus.”
I just want to thank you all so much for the fantastic comments you're all leaving on this fic. It is amazing and it's just the best feeling in the world to see that you're all enjoying this as much as I am. I'd also like to thank you all for getting Lord Thanatos over 1000 kudos. I may have done a happy dance when I saw it cause I was so excited. I hope you keep enjoying this!
,“ Tom rolled his eyes at the teen and his constant hints that he rejoin his horcruxes, “came to the same conclusion as Dumbledore and immediately searched for the boys. Why he chose the Potter’s that night, I don’t know, but he did, and after gaining the address from their secret keeper Peter Pettigrew, Voldemort went after Harry Potter.”
Winding his way through the crowds of people slowly making their way out of the Courtroom, Hadrian smirked to himself. Everything was going according to plan and he was very much enjoying himself.
“Gods know they deserve it,” they finished together.
Draco, not for the first time, wondered at what Hadrian saw in the Longbottom heir. He understood that he had probably never seen the real Longbottom, but there had never been anything to indicate that he could be capable of being Lord Thanatos’ right hand. Draco vowed to talk with the boy sometime this summer, he must have some redeemable attributes if someone as powerful as Hadrian held him in such high regard.
. Especially if he wanted to remain alive.
Harry’s words scrawled messily before him and Sirius could do nothing but stare. His son was fine, had said so himself. Whatever Harry’s plans were required him to be dead. But he was fine. He had to be. Sirius couldn’t cope if he wasn’t.
Severus didn’t know how Peverell could look at the prison of his youth with such detached emotion as he was. There was nothing on the young Lord’s face to hint at how he felt about the tiny space in which he had been locked away for eleven years.
“As payment for his follower’s work, the Dark Lord promised to try and spare the young man’s childhood friend, despite the fact she was a muggle-born, fought faithfully for the light and birthed the Dark Lord’s prophesied downfall.”
“You’re a Black, Draco,” Harry continued after Ragnok cast a silencing spell on the fuming form of Ronald Weasley. “So I grant you access to your Allowance Vault. You have my permission to browse the Black Vaults for anything you want and an estate of your choosing, though I recommend the French Townhouse. It’s beautiful and maybe you can go to the Louvre for me, I’ve always wanted to go. Also, provided that the new Lord Black has no eligible heirs of his own, I hereby grant you the title of heir Black.”
Now, I have a rough draft of this fic up until, about half way through March 1998 and then we'll see how it goes from there. There are a lot of Prophet articles coming up and they're all dated so I decided to make it easier on us all and date/location stamp the chapters so when the articles come in you know exactly when they are in relation to the rest of the chapter. I've just gone back through the last 11 chapters and edited them so there won't be inconsistencies for new readers. All you need to know is that Hadrian and Draco met at Gringotts on the 19th June and it's now only the 21st.
“Where was I?” Hadrian asked the room in general, easing the tension that had been thick in the air from the moment he stood up.
Let me know how you liked it and if you're still with me? :)
Ginevra’s face joined the group of red-faced, angry people on the left side of the table. It was clear she had no idea how Harry knew about the love potions or the marriage contract. Draco had to beat down the overwhelming sense of anger he got when he thought about the Weaselette marrying Hadrian against his will. He unconsciously pressed his thigh against the man beside him, wanting to remind himself that Hadrian had no interest in the youngest Weasley and would never fall for her tricks.
His eyes roamed over the new Lord and Peverell's flash of a smile at the stumbling form of Severus' godson next to him made Severus notice two things; this man was a Vampire, and he looked a whole lot like an arrogant
The pack comes together, a donor is found and Draco deals with emotions he's not ready for.
. Sirius’ heart sank. There was only one reason the
“Ah, but Severus, then I wouldn’t let you use it,” the boy smirked at him and damn if he wasn’t a little bit tempted. “And what would be the fun in that?” Severus scoffed dismissively but said no more on the matter undoubtedly confirming his desire to see, and thus use, the possibly ingenious creation of the thrice damned Marauders.
There was a look of understanding immediately within Draco’s eyes and Hadrian could not have been prouder of his mate. He was just so damn smart Hadrian could swoon. He wouldn’t though. At least not in the presence of others. “Of course, Hadrian,” Draco replied, making his way to the door after a deep bow in Hadrian’s direction. “I will make sure he behaves.”
Narcissa is impressed by the Weasley boys, Umbridge starts feeling chills and the Wolves have a meeting.
will do to you.”
Please don't hate me for Sirius. He'll be fine!
which was surely waiting for anyone else that tried it. There must have been some compelling evidence that convinced the Dark Lord to ally himself with his destined vanquisher, and Severus was sure no one else would ever know what it was.
Just at that moment, a large barn owl swooped in through the recently cleaned kitchen window, high up on the wall behind Sirius’ seat. It screeched softly at the large group of people it saw before dropping what looked like the evening edition of the
Hadrian led the two to the formal sitting room and situated Draco on the plush armchair closest to the welcoming hearth. He couldn’t help being a little disappointed he and Hadrian were not currently occupying the loveseat, but understood this was probably not the time for pining the loss of the vampire Lord’s warm thigh against his own. Hadrian had important business to do after all.
Dumbledore’s face was deathly pale and Draco didn’t think he had seen anything so satisfying in his entire life. He was
: Peverell Manor, Tom's Study)
Severus eyed the young vampire as he moved closer to the damned cupboard. That the brat was going to be in his House this school year was already giving him a headache. He was too powerful to comprehend, one forgot he wasn’t even seventeen yet.
Draco is jealous, then mortified. Severus is exasperated. Lucius asks some questions, gets some answers and really should have kept his mouth shut.
His loyalty to the light after the death of Potter’s mother had been unnecessary as well. Apparently his Lord had honoured his request to spare Lily but the stubborn redhead refused to move aside and watch as her child died. The more he thought about it, the more Severus realised that of course Lily wouldn’t stand by and watch her child be murdered by an insane Dark Lord. Severus really was a fool to ever think she would be okay with that.
Sirius had to muffle a snort at that. Knowing the tentative relationship between Harry Potter and the Dark Lord, it was amusing to no end to see Harry declare hope for their mutual death. Sirius wondered back for a moment on the exact relationship between Hadrian and the Dark Sect. He knew Hadrian had plans, but had been unable to explain them via letter, he and his son’s usual method of communication. He hoped he would be able to be more involved now Harry Potter was seemingly out of the picture.
“The vicious harpy who calls herself our mother was on our case about the shop again,” the other twin said and Draco was momentarily shocked by that statement. Were all the Weasley’s not on the same side. Draco just assumed that where Harry Potter lead, a flock of redheaded blood-traitors followed. He must have been wrong.
Hadrian let his gaze travel the room, noticing the interested gleam in his father’s eyes, the cautious protectiveness of Remus’s posture and Severus’ calculating observation of the situation. He lingered slightly on Draco’s beautiful form before looking back at the Weasley’s to provide his answer. He was marvelling once again at his own dramatic tendencies when he noticed it. Charlie fucking Weasley, Gryffindor’s star seeker (despite being the hunk of muscle that he was) and Dragon handler extrodinare, was staring at his mate. Eyes roving over the long-limbed form of the most perfect person Hadrian had ever seen, lingering in places Hadrian had been fantasising about since he was fourteen and Draco had turned up to the Yule ball in the most exquisite sapphire blue robes.
“My Lord, thank you for calling us so quickly. I have some information regarding the Order you will be interested to know,” Longbottom said, addressing Hadrian reverently as the twins moved into conversation with Barty. This was officially the weirdest group of people Draco had ever seen. How on earth did they all come together?
He grabbed Remus’ hand under the table, needing the strength of his best friend to keep himself upright. Remind himself that he didn’t know what had happened yet. His son could be fine.
“When I got the potions and blocks purged from my system, my magic forced me into an early inheritance. I will live until Magic says I will live no more and I have a donor and a mate, who’s blood I will need to survive and who’s lives will be extended to match mine. When I find them and they accept me, that is.” Hadrian flashed a fanged smile at the room. “I have elemental magic and natural Occlumency abilities and I’m just generally stronger and faster than your average wizard.”
Severus sat, staring wide-eyed at the Dark Lord as he realised his mistake. His loyalty had always been with the Dark until Dumbledore used Lily’s death against him. She had always been his weakness and the old man had used her to manipulate him for the past fifteen years. To know his Lord had honoured his promise and tried to spare Lily’s life shocked him to his core. Severus had to alter his world view to fit this revelation. And not for the last time that night.

Severus bowed his head in subservience as Lord Thanatos’ magic gained a harsh edge. These may have been the strangest orders ever, and Severus could only guess at the reason for them when he knew the Vampire’s claimed donor would be present also, but Severus knew he would be dead if he failed.
“Remus John Lupin: you’re the kindest man I have ever known and there is nothing that will convince me that you don’t deserve the world. My advice to you; tell him how you feel. I have it on good authority that he feels it too.” Harry winked from the glowing orb and a blush as red as the Weasel’s hair ran up Lupins face so quickly Draco had to resist the temptation to smirk. Black gave Hadrian a questioning look and the slight nod Draco witnessed caused the man’s face to split into a grin so wide there was no mistaking its genuinity.
of the magical hierarchy, Lucius. So much more than the diluted Veela blood you try to hide from the world while you preach blood purity like you aren’t a hypocritical idiot who doesn’t know when to shut his mouth.” Peverell was in Lucius’ face now. Fangs bared, eyes glowing and magic choking the air from the room. Lucius was fucked if he didn’t stand down and Severus hoped he knew that.
“What map?” Draco asked and Severus was glad he wasn’t the only one who picked up on that and wanted to know more. He didn’t want to seem curious after all.
“Do you think we will survive those two?” Lucius asked as the delighted, slightly unhinged laughter of Lord Thanatos rang out through the house. The smell of burning polyester reached the two, who applied disillusionment charms in preparation for their departure.
powerful man and Dumbledore’s life just that little bit harder. Too bad the man didn’t know just how far Hadrian was willing to go to make Dumbledore’s life harder.
The smirk that graced his father’s face was positively feral and Hadrian couldn’t help but return it. It grew in strength as he noticed Albus Dumbledore rushing through the Hall in the direction of the lifts, no doubt to warn his pets about the incoming demise of the Dursley Family.
“There’s something else I wanted to give you,” Harry said, startling Draco out of his thoughts. “I, Lord Potter, do hereby recognise all life-debts to the Potter family owed by Severus Snape fulfilled,” a golden light flashed through Severus and Draco watched as his godfather’s shoulders relaxed. Releasing a tension he had obviously been holding for sixteen years. Draco was
“What has the little bird been up to, my Lord?” she asked, not bothering to lower her voice in the slightest. She wanted the Death Eaters to know just how high she was in her Lord’s ranks. She could ask him questions with little thought for the consequences. He would never hurt her.
“Are there any on-going issues Lord Peverell needs medical potions for that you would like me to brew?” Severus watched as the Dark Lord evaluated him for a few moments. The Dark Lord stood up abruptly and made his way to the big, mahogany desk at the back of the room. He pulled a scroll of parchment out of one of the draws and made his way back to Severus, handing over the parchment.
“Thank you, Tom.” The gratitude towards the other man shining through his big, green eyes.
I hope you enjoy :)
The Order hears about Azkaban, Dumbledore makes the wrong conclusions, Tom has a case of feelings and Barty meets with old friends.
The image of Sirius Black erupted from the wand, lifted Harry from his cot and out of the house containing his dead parents. Dumbledore and Hagrid were waiting for them and Hadrian’s audience gasped as the esteemed Headmaster cast a full body bind at the young Black heir. Draco and Lucius wore identical faces of disgust as Dumbledore ordered Hagrid to take baby Harry from Sirius and head to Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. As the half-giant walked towards a large black motorcycle, a quiet ‘

not interested. So all the love potions you were trying to slip me wouldn’t have worked anyway, sorry.” Harry shrugged and Draco wondered why Hadrian chose that moment to squeeze his hand again.
“Neville Frank Longbottom,” Harry began again, “there’s not a lot I can give you but thanks for being the best friend I could ask for. I have named you, heir Longbottom, a Friend of the House Potter so if you ever need assistance, refuge or help of any kind, the House of Potter will always be there for you. I have also asked the new Lord Potter to grant you access to Euphema Potter’s greenhouses at Potter Manor. She has some seriously interesting things in there that I think you would love. Thanks again Nev, you really are the best Gryffindor there could ever be.”
Running his eyes appreciatively over the young man in front of him, Draco realised Hadrian Peverell couldn’t be that much older than Draco himself. He still looked terribly familiar but Draco couldn’t seem to place him. It was right on the tip of his tongue before all thought flew out of Draco’s mind, just as the Peverell Lord graced the room with a dazzling smile that made Draco’s knees weak. He caught a flash of a fang peeking out the corner of the young man’s mouth and Draco’s breath hitched. Hadrian Peverell was a Vampire and Draco honestly didn’t think this man could get any better.
Draco didn’t bother covering up his snort this time at the look of pure shock on the Weasley’s faces. Like someone of Hadrian’s status would ever need to prove himself to people such as this. “You are too kind, Lord Peverell,” he said before he could think. His disdain for the Weasley family was well known, but this probably wasn’t the correct environment to be antagonising anyone. Hadrian had goals Draco didn’t want to disrupt.
“I have the blood of a Most Noble and three Most Ancient and Noble Houses running through my veins and I am the Lord of all four of them. You speak to me as if I am below you, but one word from me and your family name becomes synonymous with

Hadrian snorted and bit back a comment about her never having admitted to not knowing anything before. He Squeezed Draco’s hand in amusement, belatedly realising the blonde had never let go and was now significantly closer to him than when they arrived. It felt wonderful. “It seems a bit of a history lesson is in order before Ragnok and Griphook return.” Draco squeezed Hadrian’s hand and he had to stop himself from turning to stare reverently into the beautiful silver eyes just next to him. This blonde was too much.
Hermione’s face was red with embarrassment or anger, Draco couldn’t tell, but he was loving every minute of this. Severus was next to him, trying admirably to suppress a snort, but ultimately failing in the face of Albus Dumbledore’s completely baffled expression. He wondered just how long the potions Master had waited for someone to take the know-it-all down a peg or two.
Lucius and Barty looked impressed.

I am so sorry for making you all wait! It has been a hectic couple of months and I hope you have all been staying safe and as happy as you can be. Enjoy!
dead?” Severus asked, not sure how to address the broken clone of the man standing in front of him.
The room was completely still, holding their breath at the sight of the clearly irate vampire, no doubt wondering what the second oldest Weasley had done to incur his wrath. Remus had moved every so slightly in front of Sirius in an attempt to protect his intended mate. Hadrian was pleased. They should be fucking scared right now. He was pissed.
“I marked Barty at the end of that year. Tom was generous enough to remove his Dark Mark, as long as I replaced it.” Hadrian gestured to Barty and he lifted the sleeve on his left arm revealing the mark of Lord Thanatos. The outline of a howling wolf looked up at a full moon. Inside the moon, the symbol of the Deathly Hallows was present, the line of the Elder Wand replaced with a flaming Phoenix feather. It was in a different place for each of Hadrian’s followers but Barty’s took the place of the Dark Mark, running up the inside of his left arm.
for you, Rita darling, and you are going to make sure it gets out at the right time and in the right way, so to speak.” Hadrian paused, leading Rita to the couch in the middle of the sitting room. Sitting with Tom across from her and picking up a piece of parchment from the table between them. “You will be remembered for a
Hadrian smirked as Skeeter paled. She nodded her head quickly and stuck out her hand for Hadrian to shake. “What is it that I can be doing for you, Mr. Peverell?” she blurted, clearly ruffled by the threat from someone she had never met and Hadrian was content to keep this meeting going.
“We will be surrounded by enemies, Severus,” Lord Thanatos said. “You are the only one I currently trust to keep Draco safe at all costs. If things go south today you take him and you get out of there
If Draco was a more secure seventeen year old, he could probably have determined that Harry Potter’s obsession with Draco Malfoy was not something that just went away with a trip to Gringotts. That the fact Harry had been so drawn to him even despite the hate potion keyed to the Malfoy heir in his system, told everyone who cared to listen that the young Lord would not stop whatever it was that kept him constantly seeking out the blonde. Draco had lived for six years, however, with the object of his desire displaying only aggression, hatred, or even more disheartening, indifference, when in his presence. Thus, he was surprised to feel those striking, emerald green eyes staring at him as he ate his breakfast in Peverell Manor. It was such a time honoured tradition, Draco didn’t even notice it at first, but once he did, he couldn’t help feeling a little smug. He could still hold the young man's attention, no matter how powerful he now was.
“Sirius eventually caught up with Pettigrew and, in the chaos that followed, Pettigrew called out that Sirius betrayed the Potters before he managed to blow up the street, killed 12 muggles, cut off his own finger and escape to the sewers in his Animagus form. At this point Sirius had delved further into guilt and the Black family madness than he had ever been, and by the time the Aurors got there he was all but confessing to the Potter’s deaths. That was cause enough for the stupid ministry to throw him in Azkaban without a trial even before Dumbledore got involved.”
As his three companions stared in shock at the tall man in front of them, Severus used their silence to analyse Hadrian Peverell. The name sparked something in Severus. Weren’t the Peverell family related to the Potters in some way?
“Dumbledore’s actions now, I’m not entirely certain of but, taking advantage of a mind plagued by guilt and despair, he managed to get Sirius to hunt down the traitorous Marauder who sold out his friends and ignore his urge to look after his godson.” Hadrian’s face was murderous as he talked of the man he thought most responsible for his parents deaths.
“You need to drink, my Lord,” Luna said as Hadrian warded the doors to his room. He was not being disturbed right now, not for anything. “You have been resisting your mate for too long already.”
“How on earth are you Harry’s closest living direct relative,” Granger asked once she came down from her initial shock. “I’ve never heard of the Potters being related to the Peverell’s.”
“I am a full-blooded Living Vampire and therefore the literal
“I - yes, of course my Lord,” Charlie stuttered, “you have my sincerest apologies. It won’t happen again.” Hadrian snarled once more, just for affect and leaned back from the terror stricken man before him.
Hadrian laughed, of course that was what Tom knew, he was so completely obsessed with immortality. “Exactly, we have heartbeats, eat normal food and are, for all intents and purposes, alive. We also have a destined mate and donor and, as soon as we find them, we need the blood of our donor or mate to survive. Preferably both but it’s not necessary, in case you find one years before the other or something like that.” He paused to make sure Tom was following before continuing. “I’m going to age until my mid-twenties then stop for an indefinite amount of time, extending the life of my mate and donor with me. According to the Goblin’s records, the lifespan of a Living Vampire is directly linked to how much magic the Vampire has but even the weakest Living Vampire can live for thousands of years.”
“Indeed,” Draco muttered, looking down at his tea, probably to hide the light blush that rose on his cheeks. Luna could see Draco was confused by her words, but he would understand soon enough. People always did.
“Yes, Severus?” the Dark Lord answered. Severus shrunk a little under the intense ruby red stare of his Lord.
Hadrian stood in front of his honorary godfather and began the Marking. “Do you, Remus John Lupin, swear to protect, serve and obey me to the best of your ability?” he asked, eyes intent on the newest of his wolves.
His loyalty had always been with the Dark and the only thing that changed that was Dumbledore and his manipulations involving Severus’ one weakness. Now that the boy he had sworn to protect on Lily’s memory had come out and sworn allegiance to the Dark, Severus had no reason to ever think about allying himself with Dumbledore again.

The Department of Magical Law Enforcement has just announced the most shocking news. It became apparent after the will reading of Harry Potter-Black that when the Potter’s went into hiding that fateful October in 1981, their secret keeper was not in fact Sirius Black as we all thought, but presumed-dead Peter Pettegrew.
The whole Weasley family was present (though Percy sat as far away from his family as he possibly could) and they, as well as Dumbledore, Hermione, Sirius and Remus were sat on the left of the table looking intently at Director Ragnok. That was until Ronald Weasley, ever the hot-headed fool, noticed the two Slytherins sat next to Hadrian. “What the hell are those slimy gits doing here?” he shouted, pointing an accusing finger across the table.
“This is what happened that night,” Hadrian said as he pulled out his wand. He drew a memory from his temple, but instead of summoning a pensieve as expected, Hadrian muttered a few Latin words and a scene rose from the end of his wand.

Hadrian seemed to be thinking as his eyes travelled over the room. Draco saw as Hadrian’s shoulders stiffened when he came upon the younger Weasley and braced himself for something, anything to happen. He wasn’t sure of what exactly, but he knew there was
“Tom sent Barty to watch over me when he heard what was going on that year and we got to talking. He taught me a lot that year and I taught him a few things myself. Barty’s the main reason I survived the stupid competition and, because of that, he became my first marked follower.”
“And now, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,” Harry said, his face positively murderous. The defeated look on the Headmaster’s face was all Draco needed to know that this day had

“I’ve heard of them. They used to rule over all the Vampires because there’s no recorded way to kill them.”
“Albus Dumbledore does,” Hadrian said with an edge to his voice, staring intently at the woman in front of him as he watched her work her way through the information. She knew the old man’s reputation for keeping secrets he thought no one else was worthy of knowing and had made it her life’s mission to discover as many of those secrets as she could. That is exactly why Hadrian had chosen her, of all the sneaky reporters Wizarding Britain had to offer, to be his official reporter on all things Harry Potter and Dumbledore.
Hello all you lovely readers! I'm gonna start by saying sorry! Life and writers block and just a really stupidly stubborn Sirius Black took me away for a while but I promise i'm back for the foreseeable future. Thanks so much to everyone who expressed their concern about my absence. I'm fine and thank you :)
house.
I have no idea how long this fic is going to take. I have it all planned out but my writing gets away from me sometimes and ends up thousands of words longer than I originally thought. We'll see what happens *shrugs*
‘Mr. Potter stated Mr. Dumbledore had been using his two seats on the Wizengamot since his inheritance of them in 1981 and never once told the poor boy they existed, let alone what he was voting for.’ Lord Peverell said with a downtrodden expression. It was very clear he was shaken by the unfairness of his predecessor’s life. ‘There is a whole section of the proxy contract that clearly states a minor of Hogwarts age
“The bee will get caught in the raven’s nest, my Lord. He will come to find Death.”
: Peverell Manor, Tom's Study)
“To make matters worse,” Hadrian said, startling the occupants of the Dark Lord’s office from their silent thoughts. “My magic started manifesting at a really young age. Sirius told me I was showing signs of accidental magic before my first birthday. I never would have left the muggles alive if left in those circumstances normally, so Dumbledore had to make sure that I didn’t kill them. He bound 70% of my core, effectively stumping my ability to both keep myself alive
Severus was frozen as he watched young Harry hand his first report card to his Uncle, a proud glint in his eyes at the ‘A’s he’d gained in all his areas of study. He dared not breathe as Vernon Dursley’s face turned an impressive shade of purple and Severus’ swore his heart stopped as the fat man exploded. He watched as Dursley dragged the young boy towards the cupboard under the stairs before throwing him against the wall. Yelling about the ‘ungrateful freak’ who dared get higher grades than his stupid son. He watched as the man removed his belt and whipped the boy in front of him until all he could see was red. Severus watched as a young Harry Potter was thrown into his cupboard, blood streaming from the lashes in his back, and told he would be staying there, with no food, for the week.
“You see, Rita, Harry Potter is abused.” Skeeter paled and opened her mouth but Hadrian held up a hand to silence her. “When dear James and Lily Potter died that Halloween night, our Chosen One was left on the doorstep of his Muggle Aunt’s house in Surrey. From that day on he has been treated, in the simplest terms, as a poorly cared for House Elf.”
I bring you grave news tonight, my dear readers. At approximately four o’clock this afternoon, Aurors were called to the scene of a magical house fire in the Muggle area of Little Whinging, Surrey. The house, now identified as the summer residence of one Harry Potter, took a team of six Aurors an hour to contain and put out, before an investigative team was dispatched to find the cause of the blaze and identify any casualties. The Auror response time was swift enough that the house retained its base structure and the one body left in well enough condition to be correctly identified.
A hoard of Weasleys and Order members inhabited the other end of the kitchen to Sirius Black and his best friend, Remus Lupin. The two remaining Marauders sat in comfortable silence as they observed the sea of red distributing food amongst the Order. All eight Weasleys (sans Percy) surrounded the Granger girl, Ted and Andromeda Tonks, Hestia Jones, Emmeline Vance, Dedalus Diggle, Elphias Doge and Alastor Moody. Dropping platters of food onto the centuries old table engraved with the Black Family crest. If Sirius’ father could see this, he would have rather set the house on fire than eat at this table again. Sirius was very close to sharing that sentiment, though, probably, for rather a different reason.
How very wrong he was.
Avery looked into her eyes as she lifted the silencing charm and sneered at her. “I will not answer to some little girl.” Luna cocked her head to the side in thought for a moment, heard her Lord’s chuckle at the movement, one of her tells that something dangerous was about to happen, and raised her wand. She pointed it directly between Avery’s watery blue eyes and cast her spell. It was an old spell she had learnt from the library Salazar Slytherin so graciously left under Hogwarts for their perusal. It temporarily blinded the victim and instead of being surrounded by blackness, it caused them to witness their most painful moments. The Dark Lord Voldemort’s Death Eaters were particularly susceptible to this curse, Luna had found, as proven by Avery writhing in imagined agony on tiles. That was the beauty of the curse, it was all in your head so one could be under it for as long as the caster chose and the only damage done would be that of the mind.
She flicked her wand at Avery silencing him before he could make any more misjudgments about his place in the world and stood from her seat in her Lord’s lap. Looking back at the two powerful figures behind her, Luna received two nods of affirmation, then stalked down off the dais in pursuit of her prey.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was all Hadrian could do to soften his eyes and keep his voice steady as turned to the Malfoy heir intent on getting him out of the redhead’s line of sight. “Draco, darling?” Hadrian asked, revelling in the slight blush that adorned Draco’s cheeks at the term of endearment.
thought he was just vying for attention.
She leaned back into the hard chest and looked over the congregation before her. She felt like a Queen and, though her Lord held her above almost anyone in the world, she knew she needed to act in order to allow the
, Rita Skeeter, to pass on his allegations about frightful happenings in Wizarding Britain.
“You are quite right, of course Draco,” Hadrian replied, waving away the apologetic look the Malfoy heir sent in his direction and encouraging the eldest Weasley to check the authenticity of Harry Potter’s instructions. The ice blue gaze of Charles returned to his form and a pit formed in Draco’s stomach as he had the horrible thought that something was about to go terribly wrong. Draco glanced at Severus to avoid the unwanted stare and the calculating look in his silent godfather’s eyes did not reassure him.
“Your fourth year, my Lord,” Barty said, emphasising his formality despite having permission to address his Lord informally. He felt the situation called for it. It would send a clear message to Malfoy and Snape just who had his loyalty.
Hadrian paused for breath and gauged Skeeters reaction. She looked suitably stuck between horrified that Dumbledore could do such a thing and elated at being given the opportunity to expose him.
The pair sat quietly for a while, drinking their tea and savouring the peace and quiet before the rowdier wolves awoke. Luna had no doubt this morning would be more hectic than most, as her Lord’s father would be present to encourage Barty and the twins. She said as much to Draco and giggled lightly at the groan he released. He looked as if he wished to never leave the quiet of the sunroom. She could understand.
“He -” she started, stopped, leaned back into the couch and then sat up abruptly, her tightly curled hair flying at the movement. “How do you know all this?” she demanded.
Tom could understand the appeal, of course. Riling Lucius up has been a favourite pass-time of Tom’s since he marked the boy straight out of Hogwarts. Lucius’ haughty Malfoy exterior hid the most Gryffindor emotional tendencies that would leap out at the first sign of an insult to his name, and Tom had no idea where he got it from. Abraxas Malfoy was the most Slytherin of Tom’s original Knights and he assumed the late Lord brought his son up in his image.
Hope you enjoy :)
“I’m still mad at him for that thoughtless mistake,” Tom said, his face expressing a little of the deep hatred Barty knew he felt for the rat animagus. “If you didn’t have plans for him Hades, I would have killed him years ago.”
“Heir Slytherin as well if you don’t mind,” the Dark Lord said darkly and Severus was sure Lucius would be facing the wrath of their Lord at some point in the near future. Why he couldn’t just keep his mouth shut and act like a Slytherin, Severus didn’t know.
All Albus knew for certain was that this had to stop. He had to find a way to get the public back on his side. He would have to organise something to remind them all of the hero he was. Just what that would be, he didn’t know yet. It was time to call a meeting of his pawns. They might have some ideas, they all loved him after all.
“Hermione Jean Granger, I give you this advice: you are not the smartest person in every room, and no one wants to hear that you think you are.” Harry’s smirk was positively deadly now and Draco was reminded of Lord Thanatos’ first meeting with the Death Eaters.
an impressive feat.
“Severus Tobias Snape,” Harry said, “I just want to say thank you, for all that you have done for me over the years.” Severus’ stiffened beside Draco and he turned to see the potion Master’s eyes were glued to the image before him. “There’s a letter here from Mum and Dad for you and Mum’s will stated you were to have all her potions journals and notes, so they’re yours as well. I’ve left you the lease to a shop in Hogsmeade so when you finally escape the dunderheads at Hogwarts, you can set up your own business.”
Hadrian was very good at cracking the masks of the very purebloods who prided themselves on their unbreakable emotional control and he revelled in talking circles around them until they broke. It so happened that it was poor Lucius Malfoy who had taken the brunt of Hadrian’s amusement so far this summer and Tom immensely enjoyed watching the two interact.
Hadrian wasn’t sure what to think of his newest revelation but he never had been one to argue with fate, no matter how much she screwed up his life. He decided then and there, though, that he would let the young blonde come to him. He would never force this type of bond onto someone, no matter how much he needed it personally.
Looks of approval were shared through the room. “You made a Philosopher’s stone that was convincing enough to fool Dumbledore?” Severus said, looking at Peverell like he had never seen him before, and in truth he probably hadn’t. He had realised in the past two days that the Harry Potter Dumbledore had essentially described for the world was nothing like the young man in front of him.
“Yes, I believe exposing the abuse of the Golden Boy alongside all we have found about the old coot’s involvement with Grindelwald’s beginning and the misuse of the Hogwarts funds will be enough to sway the public. I’m sure people who have been in similar situations because of Dumbledore will come forward once this all comes out,” he said with a satisfied smirk. “Have you spoken to Rita?”
Tom just
Barty looked on in awe as his young Lord ripped into Malfoy. He loved watching his Lord work. The kid could talk his way out of or into anything and leave whoever his poor victim was thinking it was their own idea. It was fascinating to watch and he could barely contain his excitement as Malfoy, the idiot, pushed and pushed his Lord until he finally snapped.
Tom observed the werewolf and Black as Hadrian explained to them his life story, his plans and the circumstances around ‘Harry Potter’s’ death. It was in a similar manner to his explanation to Severus, Draco and Lucius just a few days ago, but he seemed to have played down the pain of his childhood a little. It seemed Hadrian didn’t want his Father feeling more guilt than he already did for abandoning him for something so petty as revenge. Oh, who was he kidding? Tom would have done exactly the same thing. Though he liked to think he would have succeeded in killing the stupid rat before being sent to Azkaban.
queen to take his place. Luna doubted he would be as willing to put on such public displays of affection as she, though they could always share her Lords lap. He was certainly capable of holding them both.
: Peverell Manor, Tom's Study)
Hadrian was deeply enjoying the looks of astonishment on all three men’s faces. Especially Draco. He felt a deep seated sense of self satisfaction at breaking through the young blonde’s infallible mask. Breathing in deeply through his nose, Hadrian once again caught the scent of the Malfoy heir and confirmed what he suspected from their meeting outside Gringotts that morning.
Luna smiled, small and prettily and looked up at Draco with her large, pale blue eyes. “He hasn’t told you, Draco?” she asked innocently, even though she knew for a fact Hadrian had been waiting to inform the blonde.
“I swear it, my Lord,” Lupin replied, his voice shaking lightly as the magic in the room built in pressure.
Hesitant nods were once again directed at him and Hadrian snickered at the look of pure glee written on Barty’s face over by the fire.
You're all gems! Enjoy Harry roasting some bitches.
Severus looked overwhelmed and like he was completely unable to comprehend any more new information today.
“That’s our Lord though, never complains,” the first twin said again. Looking away from Draco to the two sitting across the table with a fond smile. Draco looked back to see Lovegood leaning back into Hadrian as the Vampire’s arm tightened around her. Jealousy crashed through Draco yet again, making his heart hurt at the thought that he might never be able to be in that position. It never occurred to Draco that he was having such strong reactions to Hadrian because, that is exactly where he was always meant to be.
His son. His only son. His amazing, brilliant, completely and beautifully selfless and kind son.
Draco watched as Hadrian Peverell’s followers, the Wolves apparently, ate breakfast around him in silent anticipation. Each member of what Draco was fondly calling the Pack, would switch between watching their Lord and the large open window behind him while they ate. The room was practically vibrating with excited magic and Draco could tell something big was about to happen. It was something to do with Hadrian’s plans but for the life of him Draco couldn’t think what it was.
A pained whine escaped Sirius as the man clutched onto the arm of the werewolf next to him. He had forgotten how small Harry was. Looking at Hadrian across the table he hoped his current strength wasn’t just a glamour. If Hadrian didn’t have them already, Sirius was making a trip to Harry’s relatives in the near future.
long time,” Hadrian said. Using all of his strength to stay off her while he waited for an answer. Luna had most likely known about this for weeks, he knew, but there was no way he was taking away her choice. He would rather waste away than do something to hurt his Luna.
going to love this. I’ve been waiting for the right time to tell you and now seems perfect because you will be in charge of making sure everyone still laughs, despite the hard times coming to the wizarding world. I give you a trunk of plans written by the Marauder’s themselves,
Albus Dumbledore has ever done, I knew it was something to do with him and I haven’t trusted him since.”
speak with the amount of magical pressure beating down on them, or whether they were all just too terrified to make a sound.
“My Lord, we came as quickly as we could,” one of the twins said, Draco wasn’t sure how to tell them apart. Or if there even was a way.
Skeeter was nodding her head absentmindedly and Hadrian could see her forming stories in her head already. It was good. She was enthusiastic and hadn’t even got her hands on the ‘good stuff’ yet. The longer he spent on this conversation, the longer Hadrian was willing to ignore the not-so-wonderful aspects of Rita Skeeter’s personality and establish a prosperous working relationship.
“Yes, i believe I am.” A wide grin spread across his aristocratic face, lighting up the green in his eyes as the Dark Lord bade entry to the four men outside the office. The wide eyes and soft gasps Hadrian heard come from all the men only enhanced his amusement as he stood and introduced himself.
Hadrian nodded once. “Good.” He indicated for the Weasley brothers to stand and steered them in Lucius’ direction. “We wouldn’t want to make a habit of that now would we, Lucius?” Lucius replied in the negative again then formally greeted Bill and Charlie. “You will all be civil for the next month, won’t you?” Hadrian asked as he escorted the trio to the door and smiled sweetly at the hasty conformations he received as they left. Oh to be a fly on the wall at the Malfoy house for dinner tonight. Hadrian imagined it would be a very tense affair.
large enough to sustain myself, but if I turned 17 without unbinding it, I probably would have died trying to come into my inheritance.”
“Ah, yes, my inner circle.” Hadrian said with smirk. “You’ll meet them all tomorrow morning.”
Sirius had to muffle a snort as Director Ragnok gave the old Headmaster a withering glare at the interruption. He could see Hadrian’s shoulders moving with barely disguised amusement as the old Goblin curtly replied, “he was.”
“I always knew he was a filthy Slytherin whore,” Weasley spat out and Hadrian stiffened almost imperceptibly beside Draco. “He never could act completely Gryffindor, the stupid hat should have just put him where he belonged, with the other wannabe Death Eaters.”
“Oh, Severus. So sweet that you care,” the raven haired menace drawled, placing a hand over his heart dramatically. “But, I am perfectly safe here. In fact, right here, in this room with you five, is probably the safest I’ve ever been.”
Draco observed the stiff composure of the four newcomers that showed how uncomfortable they all must be in the presence of such wealth and power. He wondered how different their reactions would be if they knew exactly who sat before them. The Dark Lord himself was probably just down the hall planning a revolution in his study. Draco watched as Hadrian ordered tea through a House Elf and introduced himself formally, probably aiming to relax his guests. Draco didn’t think it worked particularly well if the forced, unpracticed responses were anything to go by, but maybe Hadrian wasn’t going for friendly in this meeting, rather
“I am certain the
That is all I can tell you for the moment, dear readers but I assure you, I will be bringing you more on our Saviour as my findings are confirmed. If Harry Potter is reading this, however; take care, young saviour, we may need you yet.
A breakfast, an article, a fire and another article.
“I know you think I hate you,” Harry’s voice said. “But, in fact, the opposite is true.” Gasps came from all directions at Harry’s confession. The Weasel looked like he was about to explode and Dumbledore’s expression was stormier than Draco had ever seen it. Draco was shocked. Harry Potter had publicly confessed he held no hatred for Draco Malfoy. Warmth blossomed through Draco’s chest.
“It is, my dear Rita, very important indeed,” Hadrian said, allowing a dramatic pause to build the tension. He had definitely been spending too much time around Tom. The bastard could never help himself when it came to dramatics. “You see, there’s a lot about Harry Potter’s home life that the poor boy has never had the courage to tell anyone, besides the Headmaster that is. You will have ample reason to delve into the specifics of our Chosen One’s home life when he sends you a package of information then, 12 hours later, is found dead in a cupboard in his relatives recently burnt down house.”
going to have to do something to thank Hadrian. He was releasing Severus from a great deal of his oaths.
“Yes, Hadrian, I think it did. Are you ready to get going now?” Tom said, dismissing the rest of the room with a wave of his hand, not waiting for Hadrian’s reply before leaving the room.
Okay, some updates on Lord Thanatos. This story starts in the Summer of 1997 so in September Hadrian will be going to Hogwarts in his seventh year. I don't think I've mentioned that clearly before so there you go.
Dumbledore paid the owl, opened up the paper and Sirius’ dread increased as he watched the Headmaster’s face pale. The paper dropped with a soft thunk onto the table and Sirius realised the room had gone completely silent. No one dared to speak and find out what had affected the Headmaster so until Bill Weasley, Sirius blessed his soul, picked up the paper and cleared his throat. His voice tight, face pale and hands shaking as he read the article emblazoned on the front page.
Personal chambers in the Malfoy Manor could be permanently locked the inhabitant’s will thanks to the ancient ancestor who’d valued privacy. Draco refused to be bothered for the rest of the night, even though he hadn’t greeted Mother since returning home. He initiated the locking system, breathing a sigh of relief at being finally alone and in his own space for the first time that day. When not out on dates, Draco was expected to prepare for his evenings out by reviewing the familial history of each selected woman.
Draco nodded again.
. “Draco’s going to absolutely hit the fan when he reads this,” he says gleefully.
“You think I’m not worried about you now?” She countered, huffing in disbelief. “You’re less social than ever yet you pretend like everything is fine. What are you going to do after you graduate this summer? Hide in France forever?”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
He rose and turned on the tea kettle, surrendering before the fight began. “I didn’t say it was goodbye forever, you know.”
“Count to fifteen,” Draco briskly told himself. He couldn’t calm down. He couldn’t count. His thoughts were going around and around in circles as he tried to absorb the events of the morning: Reporters outing Potter’s sexuality, teasing out details of their relationship to distribute to the public by afternoon, and, most unforgettably, Potter declaring he loved Draco.
They toured the house for at least two hours, sliding around the freshly polished ballroom floors in their socks and riding the bannisters from the top of the stairs to the floor just like royalty did in Muggle fairy-tales. Draco raced Potter down the hallways and beat him by a mile by ducking through several different passages. He showed Potter all of them after Potter demanded to know how Draco had gotten around so fast, pointing out specific books or portraits that acted as entrances. Potter was impressed with Draco’s bedroom, not because it was so lavish, but because it seemed to represent him perfectly. Draco had put a lot of work into redecorating after he and Mother were sentenced to complete their community service hours.

“Potter, you utter prat!” snapped Malfoy, anxiously checking his tea for biscuit residue. “Your biscuit, your tea. I would have thought that an elementary concept!”
“For Merlin’s sakes,” said Harry. He took a step closer to Malfoy and raised his hand. Malfoy, to his credit, didn’t shy away. “Episkey,” said Harry, speaking the incantation to avoid any mishaps with Malfoy’s perfect pointy face. Malfoy would never let him forget it if he made his face any worse by say, accidentally removing an ear.
Draco read the rest of the article, pausing briefly to cringe at something either he or Harry had said, groaning audibly before reading certain passages and causing Harry, on more than one occasion, to ask what could
After neatly wrapping the present up, Harry attached it to Draco’s owl, which gave him an approving sort of hoot before it took flight. He watched it soar through the cool night, comforted by there being time and space between them so that he wouldn’t have to worry about a potential reply anytime soon.
The man in the middle of the left side of the dirt field – Zee – turned to Nate, who seemed to be the team coach, and glared. Draco was appreciative; it was a good glare.
They took sexy shots, Harry in-between Draco’s knees, ready to pounce on his “unsuspecting” lover; sultry shots, with Harry and Draco drinking wine at an intimate wooden table; action shots at a crossroad, where Draco and Harry were positioned on opposite ends but ultimately chose to walk towards each other. Yet that still wasn’t enough to sate Luna.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry!” huffs Ron, “Stop talking about fucking my siblings!”
“Harry!” shouted Nate happily. “Meet Draco Malfoy. You wanted some extra practice with your teaching, so you’re going to be helping him learn the game.”
“We’ll see how long that lasts, Minerva,” spat the chairman. "I'll be pursuing your resignation, you know."
“Thank you for explaining, Potter,” Draco said. “Now we can both go home and get some sleep.”
“Have you ever seen the fireworks?” I ask him.
“It depends,” Luna answered. “We’re putting out a special issue, you see. Daddy’s adding some context about your time at school, interviewing a few professors and friends. Oh, and we’ve also obtained photos too, of some of your and Draco’s most memorable moments.”
“Ouch, Malfoy!”
“Trick or treaters,” Harry corrected automatically. “And at least we’re homeless together, right?”
“Here’s the thing,” he spat, thrusting his pointer finger into Zee’s chest. “I don’t give a flying fuck about what you think, so you better not even
“Harry is our family,” said Mrs. Weasley firmly. “And anyone that’s important to him is important to us. I shouldn't have disregarded Draco solely because of his past mistakes.” She turned back to Draco. "I’m sorry about my son’s poor manners. Do eat up, dear.”
you not to use your weapons, but no, Ronald, you had to go and turn it into a big production!”
The upper outside corner was easier to hit. It only took Draco two balls to nail that one, and he was sure he’d put a strike on Potter in the process.
Ron glares at him, and Harry clarifies. “You know, a night out flirting and dancing, not a night out drinking with my best mate.” Slightly mollified, Ron gets up from the table and reaches out a hand to pull Harry up.
“No way, residue will be permanently stuck in my hair then,” Draco answers, looking revolted.
“So, er—About those biscuits,” Potter said, looking sheepish for once.
Before Harry had a chance to answer, the Weasel said impatiently, “You look like you could use a game of chess, Malfoy. Or at least I could. Get the Firewhiskey?”
Otarres emailed Draco the good news on Sunday night: Merram, without even meeting Draco, had hired him for the grant writing internship. Draco knew that Otarres’s email to Merram had essentially been a letter of rec, but he highly suspected that Otarres had included several samples of his in-class writings.
At least both groups were sharing the same living unit, The Ridge. In fact, Draco had caught sight of a topless Potter earlier that week at the very beginning of staff training, and that had caused him to reacquire the obsession he’d had with Potter all throughout Hogwarts. Draco had expected Potter to be as bony and knobby as he’d been back then, but was pleasantly surprised to find that Potter had filled out in the four years since the War.
This crushing rejection was the
Draco pointed to a side table with a stack of parchment and notebooks on it. “Why don’t you check that pile of mess?”
“Hey mate,” Ron said easily. “Nice night.”
They barely made it through the bedroom door before Harry was kissing Draco, gently unbuttoning his outer layers and stripping him of his undershirt. “You’re so beautiful,” Harry said reverently. Draco couldn’t respond. He initially kissed Harry to shut him up, but found the emotions he’d tried so hard to quash start coming out in their kiss. Pushing Harry down on their bed, Draco Vanished the rest of their clothes and set himself to the task of sucking Harry’s cock.
“Hermione and I are now very close,” Draco inserted unexpectedly, gripping Harry’s hand tightly. “We’ve always had a lot in common, and though I can never apologize fully for the prejudice I displayed in our early years of school, she’s managed to look past that--as has Harry--to see who I’m trying to become.”
I'm so sorry I took so long with this chapter! I was sick for a while and time just got away from me. This chapter's a bit longer than usual though, so I hope that makes up for it :)
“Thanks ever so much, Tom,” Hadrian flashed a grin at the Dark Lord. Barty was once again struck with the ease of the relationship between the two Lords. When he was first tasked with watching over Hadrian, Barty was sure the Dark Lord was just protecting an investment. But the longer he spoke to either of them, the more he realised Tom actually cared for Hadrian. Though he would never admit to something so plebeian as positive human emotions, Barty knew the Dark Lord would be glad to call Hadrian his son. He certainly put enough effort into keeping the kid alive.
Severus thought that, yes, Peverell had most likely been deceiving them all this time and that he, along with the entire wizarding world, had severely underestimated the wrath of an intelligent and powerful young man. Severus was glad to be on Peverell’s good side and was not going to be doing anything, any time soon to change that position. No matter how much he hated the boy’s father.
“You know of the three Peverell brothers, yes?” Hadrian asked the table. Nods of acknowledgement from everyone let him continue. “Well our dear Harry was a direct descendant of the youngest brother, Ignotus Peverell. There came a time in Ignotus’ line where only Iolanthe Peverell was left. She married Hardwin Potter and thus continued the Potter line until Harry Potter. I am a direct descendant of Antioch Peverell, the eldest brother and, thus, the Lordship is carried on through my line. When Antioch was murdered, no one was aware he had a wife and son and that, due to the circumstances of Antioch’s death, they went into hiding shortly after he died.” Hadrian observed the gleam in Dumbledore’s eye and knew as soon as he stepped through the doors of Hogwarts, the man would be trying to win Hadrian over to the Light.
I just want to say thank you to everyone who's been reading this fic. All your comments and kudos literally make my day, you're all so lovely.
There's a little bit of torture in this chapter, it's pretty tame but I just thought I'd warn you.
Hadrian stood for a moment and put up his standard Harry Potter glamour before sitting back down, now seeming several feet shorter and three times skinnier. Rita’s eyes were wide as she took in the similarities between this and his previous form, the colour of his hair and eyes and his skin tone, clearly taking his evidence as proof of his claims. “How?” she asked again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco thought he knew enough about Vampires to know that feeding didn’t just mean drinking her blood. Vampires were a sexual species and the act of feeding was supposed to be extremely erotic. Jealousy washed over Draco in waves as he watched Hadrian draw Lovegood closer, breathing in her scent. It was exceedingly unfair to Draco that someone who shared so many physical traits with him should be allowed to be Hadrian’s mate but he could not.
“Arthur Weasley,” Harry said with a sad smile and the Weasley patriarch looked up at the image before him. Draco once again wondered whether the grief displayed on his face was genuine. He hadn’t noticed before, too distracted by the myriad of more interesting people filling the room, but Arthur Weasley looked significantly more distraught than his wife. As Hadrian once again squeezed his hand, a rush of warmth flowing through the young Malfoy, Draco thought there might genuinely be a strong relationship between Harry and the eldest Weasley.
Sirius noted the absence of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Nymphadora Tonks and wondered if they were part of the task force assembled to find out whatever it was going on with his son. He may not have been part of the initial creation of the wonder that is Harry Potter-Black, but Sirius’ blood runs through Harry’s veins and he would
On another note, I think Lord Thanatos will be fortnightly updated until life clams down a bit and uni isn't riding my ass with assignments and the like. This might mean that my chapters are a bit longer than they have been. It will depend on the subject matter though.
“I have a few things I’ve collected from the muggle world that I had put aside for you. Each comes with its name, instructions on its use and what it’s made of. I hope you enjoy them. I’ve also left you a letter and I want to thank you for all that you have done for me over the years. For someone who never knew his parents, I sure felt like I had a lot of fathers and you were one of them.”
Luna’s tinkling laugh echoed through the ballroom. Her Lord, who was setting up a dais at the far end of the room, looked over at the noise.
Draco smiled slightly at his father before turning towards the guest room again. He was not going to hope. The likelihood of Draco Malfoy being the mate of someone as impressive, physically, mentally and magically, as Hadrian Peverell was so slim in Draco’s mind there was little reason for contemplation.
“Are you completely sure, little moon. You know I would never force you into this. You will have to live for a
“Well, Rita, in the barest sense of the word, yes, I am going to kill Harry Potter.” Hadrian smiled a dark smile, full of teeth and fangs. “Oh, don’t be so shocked Rita, you won’t be an accessory to murder, he’s not actually going to die. Just the
Ronald’s face was redder than his hair, and Sirius was beginning to think this alone would make up for the two days of intense worry his son had put him through. If this reading went the way he thought it was going to, Hadrian was well on his way to being forgiven.
Tom’s hair had darkened to a deep chocolate brown, his eyes changed to an enticing blue-green that seemed to shift between the two as he moved his head, and his skin tone had darkened a shade or two to match Hadrian’s golden tan. In short, they looked very much like father and son.
a little something for each of you and I trust that Ragnok and Griphook will be able to help you retrieve it all from my Vaults.”
If any of you were wondering, I have no current plans to make Tom and Severus a thing in this fic. The way it stands at the moment is Tom is struggling enough with the idea of friendly relationships with anyone but Hadrian (and even that is based on mutual insults at times) and Severus is just the type of person Tom can relate to. I'll see how it goes and you can all let me know your ideas on this paring in the comments.
There were a few gasps at the revelation of Harry’s hyphenated last name that had Sirius smug. His son really had fooled them all. Ragnok pulled out a large, glowing orb and placed it on the table in front of him. He tapped it with his finger and the image of a scrawny, messy haired fifteen year old Harry Potter appeared above it.
Peverell, however, had no such trouble. “Yes, poor Harry here left us two days ago. Punctured lung,” he said with alarming nonchalance. “Among other things.”
Sirius bit back a snarl as Dumbledore walked into the room, not even bothering to hide his smug look. He obviously had something planned. He looked back at Hadrian to gauge his reaction to the old coot and his eyes widened. Hadrian eyes changed subtly as Sirius watched on, becoming an enticing blue-green that shifted in the light. Close enough to his real colour to be related but not Harry Potter’s iconic green eyes. Clever boy. Sirius shook his head slightly at the insanity of this situation. His son was a metamorphmagus, possibly a creature of some kind, not dead as the world currently believed and somehow on close terms with the youngest Malfoy. As soon as this meeting was over Sirius was dragging his son somewhere safe and getting answers out of the little shit. There was too much he didn’t know.
Sirius, will use the shop in Hogsmeade I also got for you to open that Cafe you guys always talked about when you were younger.”
in the castle is. It can’t be fooled by polyjuice, animagi or invisibility cloaks and is really quite handy at insulting people.” The stupid brat had the audacity to wink at Severus then and he had the quell the instinctive urge to take ten points from Gryffindor.
The Vampire Lord left the office followed by an obedient Barty, leaving behind a blushing young Malfoy and three highly amused wizards.

The room quieted, finally, and Dumbledore swept his twinkly-eyed gaze over the congregation before him. Sirius made sure to reinforce his Occlumency shields as he met the old man’s eyes and he was sure both Remus and Snape were doing something similar next to him.
Skeeter was enthralled. Gazing at Hadrian in a way his inner circle were intimately familiar with. Much like Tom Riddle in his years preceding Hogwarts, when Hadrian spoke, people had no choice but to listen. He was a captivating speaker. Charming, charismatic and had a voice that demanded attention without being overpowering or condescending.
Severus’ quiet “yes, my Lord” caused Hadrian to break out of his temporarily dazed state. “So many things make more sense now!” he said to the room. Ignoring the questioning looks from Barty especially, Hadrian sat back to think for a moment. “You’ll all find out when the rest of my wolves get here and we talk to Rita.”
so he could shut down Skeeter easily. He could fight this war in the name of Harry Potter and gain all the recognition in the process. Albus sat back in his chair and popped a lemon drop into his mouth. Everything was going to work out fine.
“I found out Pettigrew was the traitor from Tom the year before and had no idea why Sirius was so intent on getting in to Hogwarts until I saw the stupid rat’s name on the Map.”
Luna was very excited about her Lord’s plans. Though he had done nothing to her personally, Luna despised Dumbledore and all that he stood for. Her magic was pure and, because of this, she understood the importance of magical balance. It was inconceivable that half the magic in the world should be deemed illegal. Magic was like all natural things and would fall apart without the intrinsic balance created for it to survive. Dumbledore wished to overwhelm the world with Light magic and Luna knew this would kill Lady Magic. Without Dark magic around to even out the emissions, the very foundation of magic would crumble and fall. And with it the very world.
At Tom’s nod of approval, Hadrian figured it was okay to change the topic without getting a
“My fathers, Remus Lupin and Pettigrew made a map of Hogwarts when they were in school. It shows not only where everything is, including secret passageways and whatnot, but also where every
“I can also probably get a boat load of laws revoked because he’s been unlawfully voting on bills in my place. There is a whole section of the proxy contract that stresses the need to ask an underage seat holder how they want to vote on at least the bigger bills.”
“THIS MORNING!” Severus shot out of his chair, finally breaking out of his dazed state and rushing to kneel in front of Hadrian. He pulled out his wand and frantically cast diagnostic spells at the young man sitting in front of him. Oblivious to the amused glint in the Dark Lord’s eyes and the fond exasperation that shon out of Hadrian’s.
“It is just vague enough to give nothing away, but specific enough to make the old man sweat,” Neville said with a wolfish grin. Fred and George chuckled from their places next to Luna and she clapped her hands in delight. Hadrian, though, only had eyes for Draco. The inquisitive look the young blonde directed at Hadrian set his vampire to preen. It loved the feeling of his little mate’s eyes attempting to figure him out, like a particularly difficult puzzle.
“London rejected me?!”
Rushing in, he turns on the tap and lathers up his face with soap, trying to keep it out of his hair. The water is crisp, and Harry feels ready to seek out Malfoy by the time he’s dried his face with one of the elaborate hand towels hanging around the porcelain globe sinks.
. There's no major harm done, he just got dirty. He’s always been a git to us anyway. You do remember how he used to call me a ‘Mudblood’ and worse, right?”
“You never did seem to like Potions,” snickers Malfoy.
He cautiously bent down and picked up his rucksack, and made another cautionary motion towards the man, who was standing in front of his family with his arms crossed. After another moment, Draco felt safe enough to turn around and find a way off of the sodding sand. He caught sight of a brochure on a nearby picnic table and anxiously grabbed it, hoping for a clue as to where he was.
But Potter only says, “Bummer,” and goes back to his conversation with the wrangler, who, I notice upon second glance, has a Dark Mark imprinted on her arm. Well. Isn’t that something, to see Potty the Saviour branching out and making new friends, so long as they don’t include me.
With a growing dread in his stomach, Draco Accioed the
Ron stretched out across the back seat of the car and grappled for the bag of weapons stowed under the floorboards. “So do you want the Glock today, or the Sig Sauer?”
He was sure that it was only the gravity of the situation kept Hermione from commenting about his love of filing and copies. He couldn’t watch as she read them; instead, Draco concentrated on trying to get his hand to stop shaking long enough to pick up his teacup.
Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ
"I'm going to him," Harry said. "We can discuss this matter later." Without waiting for permission, he left her office and made it to the hospital wing just in time to see Madam Pomfrey reviving Draco. Harry’s heart hurt at the sight of him lying there, pale and pointed in the harsh infirmary light.
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
“And then he moved away, and Seamus’s dick was just, er,
“Hello, Harry,” Luna said, a serene smile tugging up the corners of her mouth. “It's no surprise you didn't notice me until now, not with all the Wrackspurts circling around your head.”
Pride blossomed throughout Draco, warming his cold extremities. It made him happy when Harry succeeded, especially when he knew the different struggles Harry faced in the workplace. He was also delighted that Harry’d taken up crocheting to get closer to him—it had never been explicitly said, but Draco knew it anyway—and was grateful to that they were able to bond over a shared interest.
“So we have a choice,” Pans murmurs, having listened long after I zoned out. “We suffer through Muggle sports like basketball, make bracelets, go hiking, or participate in more camp songs. Apparently they have different ones here.”
Lucius reacting in alarm and anger, Draco didn’t look back as he got the hell out of there.
“It does
“Yeah, I did,” said Harry. “But that doesn’t mean I agree with you.”
They sit wordlessly on Harry’s couch drinking coffee for the next fifteen minutes until the feeling of being human washes over them again.
Placated, Malfoy settled down in his chair. Harry sliced the turkey and cheese in two, taking a big bite before passing the other half (which was, admittedly, much smaller) over to Malfoy. He found his tea already done up just the way he liked it, with a slosh of milk and a big scoop of sugar.
Eric laughs. “It was easy, because you dance like a natural.”
“Come on, handsome, I know you wanted me earlier. I could see it in your eyes and feel it in your body,” the man endears, running his hands back up Harry’s arms and locking him in place. “You wanted me then, why don’t you want me now?”
“That’s what I want.”
“I thought we’d do the one from
Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ
Draco chuckled and finally held him, blinking back tears. Harry smiled into his hair, and whispered, completely on impulse, “I love you.” Immediately, Draco’s entire body stiffened. He drew back away and quickly wiped away the tears still welling in his eyes.
Ron Summons Pigwidgeon, and Harry carefully straps on Draco’s package along with a quick note asking if he can get the paperwork back by at least Friday. He wants to ask for another dinner date, but Ron’s reading over his shoulder and he decides to tread carefully or be teased mercilessly.
!” He kicked at the chest containing all of his Potions books, now doubting his ability to continue in this program. “An entire primary school education and advanced study
They started to break, grabbing bats, assorted mitts, and batting gloves and carrying them off toward the dugout. Nate exited the diamond and walked around the other side of the high surrounding fence. “I have your uniforms here,” he called. “Pick them up on your way out – and for heaven’s sakes, don’t wear them tomorrow!”
They played catch for the next forty minutes, Potter throwing balls of varying heights and speeds to Draco to have him practice the different glove positions. At one point, they moved into outfield distance, and he and Potter worked on accuracy and throw location. Night finally fell and it was time to call it quits. As Potter predicted, Draco did almost get hit in the head with the ball because he could no longer see. Even so, he felt accomplished after they were done practicing, like he’d mastered something no one would be able to take from him.
“A hot mess,” Jake laughed. “I’m sorry too, Draco, especially for pushing you into this.”
“I couldn’t feel anything,” Harry explained, not meeting Malfoy’s eyes. “I had everything that I’d dreamed of having after the War ended; I had my life back. I dunno, I can’t explain it.”
“Chill the fuck out,” he heard through the door as it was heaved open. “You gave him twenty minutes to get ready. What did you expect?”
“For Christ’s sakes, Malfoy, I’m God.”
He was also certain that Molly considered their relationship to be a passing phase, something he would grow out of after the initial shock of the War ended. But deep down, Harry knew he and Draco were meant to be together. Fate kept them on opposite sides for years, but despite that, they’d been strangely drawn to each other in ways that couldn’t be dismissed as a rivalry or even jealousy. Though they definitely didn’t
It came more naturally to him than it should have. Of course, all the spills he’d taken on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch had been excellent preparation. Harry executed an textbook slide, bending his left knee and stretching out with his right foot as long as he possibly could, but the ball was already flying through the air. The second baseman straddled the bag in preparation, glove in place to catch the ball, and easily swing his arm down to tag Harry out. And that’s just how it happened. He really thought he’d gotten there first, but rest of the team resoundingly declared him “Out!”
In an instance, Narcissa had her wand out and waved it severely. The rum bottle snapped out of Draco’s hand and came to a grinding halt in Narcissa’s, and she strangled it. “I’d think I wouldn’t have to stand here and convince you that I love you, but then again, I never thought I’d have a son hell-bent on destroying the only second chance that he was offered, either.”
“Yeah,” said Otarres, leaning back in his desk chair, “I focused on several different genres during my PhD program, and Children’s Lit and Gothic Lit were two of them. I wanted to be versatile to increase my chances of getting a job.”
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
A sunny looking woman was passing, decked out in a red bathing suit and a white pair of shorts. She had a whistle around her neck. On impulse, Draco decided to stop her. Remembering not to address her as “muggle,” he said, “Excuse me,” and flashed her the kindest smile he could conjure up, making sure to put his pearly whites on full display.
The dirt was soft and a little wet to the morning dew, but to Draco, it smelled fresh and clean; natural, and even how a home should feel. He breathed in the scent, listening to the chirping birds that usually annoyed him, appreciating them for the first time.
Draco was silent. Somehow, it was nice to feel someone next to him. It was nice to feel loved, even if it was platonic, because no one had touched him other than when he hugged Mother goodbye so many weeks ago.
“Perhaps you could make more use of us in the field,” Harry said. He’d meant for it to come off as a light comment, but there was an edge to his voice that wouldn’t be softened. “We’re wasting away in here when the second-classes could easily handle the department paperwork.”
“Not a wink,” Draco reluctantly admits, shoving another marshmallow into his mouth. There is literally no such thing as too much sugar.
“Touché,” pronounces Harry, toasting Ron with his water glass. “Merlin, how am I going to make it through tomorrow with him?”
“Do you only wear it on this anniversary?” Draco pressed, feeling unpleasant emotions start to take control.
This torture continued down the woodchip path, past the lake, and through a grassy field. Draco let himself be talked into singing the song a second time, by himself, mostly due to Maggie’s bright eyes but also because they were nearly there so he might not have to finish it. But another group was heading to the archery range from an adjacent path that would soon merge with theirs, and of course
SEPTEMBER 1998
“By no means am I trying to deter you from helping Harry!” shouts Malfoy. “I’m simply unwilling to tell you what happened because he
reason why he never took risks anymore. Merlin, he could just throttle Potter for talking him into taking the leap.
Draco squeezed him back, climbing into Harry’s lap. He planted a chaste kiss on Harry’s lips. “You’re welcome,” he whispered back. Breaking away long enough to snag the magazine off of the floor, Draco made himself comfortable between Harry’s legs with his back to Harry’s chest and opened the magazine again.
“He’s in the shower. I’d say he’ll be done soon, but we both know that’d be a lie. I think he’s become even more of a princess while we’ve been away from London, honestly.”
“I’ll let you know how it goes,” smiles Harry, walking over to the bar’s Floo.
Ron’s freckles really stood out in the sun. Hermione had never really noticed how vibrant they were, not before she’d left London.
Draco pulled every trick he knew to pleasure Harry, wanting their love-making to end. He loved Harry, and he loved the sex, but apparently crushing disappointments weren’t a major turn-on.
“Be right back,” he murmurs against Potter’s neck, heaving the other man off as he tucks his cock in and runs off into the night, back towards the cabin. Within seconds he’s streaking back to the fire pit, green sleeping bag flaring behind him like a banner of pride. Potter smiles at Draco’s solution and helps him to lay it out flat on the ground. Gracefully, Draco lowers himself to the sleeping bag, slipping off his shirt on the way down.
was here. Draco, who’d been forced to break Harry’s heart when his father summoned him home from school over a month early.
“You’ve kept this a secret from me for nearly three years?” Hermione demanded, her disbelief shining through her tears.
“Hermione, sweetheart?” said Mrs. Granger. “Why are you selling us wine on the front porch? And what is that boy you hate doing here?”
“Good,” Draco said. He started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, noticing the subtle shiver that went through his body and how his nipples began to harden from the cool air. “That’s literally adorable, Potter, that you’re cold.”
When he was finally flung out in an entirely new grate, Draco coughed and tried to get a hold of himself. He was filled with an otherworldly sense of panic at losing Potter, even though their relationship had only existed within a dream.
It didn’t take him long to eat. Harry heard Draco mutter a quick Scourgify before nipping into the bathroom and closing the door. He decided to pretend to be asleep when Draco came to bed and see what happened.
wouldn’t help him, as the charm could only draw water if there was a quantity nearby and readily available. No matter, Draco grimaced. Surely the muggles had managed to exploit all the natural resources in North America and he could access them there.
“You can tell me more about it later, alright?” says Harry, running his hand through his hair in his anxiousness to get away from Seamus.
Draco had worried about the inevitable trial ever since he’d first realized the certainty of Voldemort’s downfall. Fortunately, he knew the Golden Boy would keep his word. Harry Potter was nothing if not noble and honest. With Harry’s testimony, he and his mother were sentenced to community service and a fine and the Malfoy vaults retained most of their fortune. His father wasn’t so lucky. Lucius received a fifteen year sentence in Azkaban, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel pity. His actions enabled the Dark Lord to return to full force in the first place, and he’d pressured Draco into taking the Dark Mark. For that, Draco would never forgive him.
Nate sighed. “Look, Zee, we want to keep you around, but we need everyone to support each other in order to function well as a team.”
“I can’t even,” grumbles Ron, refusing to indulge Harry any further. “For Chrissake, what is taking Seamus so long? He usually comes a lot quicker than this.”
Aiming an iron glare at Malfoy, Harry departs to the house, shaking his head on the way there. Malfoy never used to be such a meddler.
Ready to send them both over, Draco slaps Potter again, harder this time, and Potter responds by lubing up his hand again and reaching for Draco’s cock. Pulling Draco in time with his thrusts, Potter cries out as he reaches his climax and spurts inside Draco. Draco comes a second later, spurred on by Potter’s excitement and frantic penetrations. He sees stars as the orgasm overtakes him, holding Potter for fear of drifting away without him as an anchor. After Draco comes back to his senses, he sees Potter smiling at him. Potter’s weight feels like a comfortable blanket, and if he wasn’t so eager to get cleaned up, Draco could see laying out here like this all night.
“Malfoy?” came Potter’s voice. “Earth to Malfoy,” he called.
“Minister,” Harry smiled, forcing graciousness. “Er, what a lovely evening.”
“Poor baby,” Potter cooed, flipping back the covers to pull his wand out of his jeans’ pocket. He cleaned them both off before pulling on his shirt and throwing Draco’s at his face. Startled awake, Draco slipped into his button down as Potter sorted out the rest of the clothes. They yanked on pants with no problem, but Draco could have sworn that Potter did something to his trouser pocket when he went to Summon them.
“Hey, Draco?” he said, as Draco walked and he limped into their bedroom.
“If you’d actually read my statement of purpose, you’d know I have very good reasons as to why I want to get into these Mastery programs. And, if you’d listened to literally anything I said when we were talking about schools last month, you’d know that the best Potions Mastery program in Physiology is in France. ”
,” spat Harry. “Can you imagine having to get up any earlier for practice than we already do?”
The walk home was uneventful. Cool wind chilled his neck, making Draco realize he’d need a higher collar or a scarf from now on. He focused on the little things as he went. There was a little girl measuring things as she walked with her mother, who tapped her foot impatiently at having to wait every few steps, yet still recorded numbers dutifully at her daughter’s command. A duck crossed the road with the help of a woman, who shooed others away from it. On the corner, there was a young couple, laughing in their own idiocy after bumping foreheads during a failed kiss. The boy had messy black hair, dark hair like—. Draco didn’t finish the thought.
If he was going to be forced to wine and dine a different woman every night, the least he could do was actually enjoy the food he was consuming.
After rounding first base, Harry briefly looked toward the outfield and saw the left fielder getting ready to throw the ball into second. He put on a fresh burst of speed and focused intensely on second base. Behind him, he could vaguely hear Nate yelling “Down! DOWN!”
“Honestly,” Neville chuckled, “You’d have to be a fool not to see how much he cares for you.”
“Harry’s selling himself short,” said Draco firmly. “We’ve been studying together, and he’s not nearly as dense as I used to think he was.” He appeared to believe that this was a compliment.
“What a horror story, Potter.”
“Want to come in?” Hermione said finally, once it became apparent that Ron was at a loss for words.
“I try to never read the
, Draco mused, Ron’s words echoing in his ears. He hadn’t been able to sleep again that night, and, even though he was on solid ground in the middle of the countryside, somehow he could hear fierce ocean waves roaring, breaking on the shore. Maybe the sounds were the result of hallucination, or perhaps sleep deprivation. Maybe the magic that coursed through his body made it possible for his soul to be in two locations at the same time.
“Sounds good. How are we getting there?”
.” Draco enunciated his words carefully, letting Potter see his silent rage. He effectively ended the conversation by slamming the shower door shut.
“I didn’t expect you to have any,” she replied, running her fingers through her long, blond hair. Draco could tell immediately when she and his mother had reconnected that they were sisters, even if Narcissa was thinner with more sallow skin that Andromeda.
As Draco approached the dirt field for the first time, Becky Lou saw fit to run up and actually slap the grumpy man on his ass. He jerked up into a ramrod straight posture and covered his butt – which was really quite delectable, decided Draco – with his hands.
“ -–’Mione, you can’t feel guilty about it. Ron’s been taking you for granted for years-–”
“That’s exactly why I’m accompanying you to the door,” says Malfoy smoothly. “You need your friends more than anything right now.”
Water break over, they continued to head toward the archery range, but now there would be entertainment in the form of Draco singing. He could carry a tune, but these camp songs were going to be the death of him.
“–-Harry, don’t you dare tell her, I swear, I’ll-–”
“Do you want to read the critical details or the mission logistics?” asked Draco, perfectly content despite being crushed against Harry.
There were noises coming from Draco now, which Harry adored.
“Of course,” Draco replied, wishing that Jake wouldn’t notice if he wordlessly performed a Cleaning Charm on his sticky shorts. “We’re not going to beat USC on environmental regulations without practice.”
Ginny walked in to the smell of smoke, shouted “Harry!” and immediately doused the fire with a quick Aguamenti from her wand. “What the hell did you do at work today?”
“–-of course I don’t regret it, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to leave behind everything we had either-–”
“Fancy a dance, mate?” Harry nods yes, and the man steps forward and initiates a ballroom stance. He leads them in the polka across the floor, with electronica playing all the while, spinning Harry around the room. They prance and twirl, the man smiling brightly at Harry, who is soon gleefully laughing with both the hilarity of the situation and with how much fun dancing can be.
“Should we finish another way?” Harry asks, wanting Draco to enjoy their love-making just as much as he is.
“Oh, and you’re grimacing every time you sit down or stand up,” Hermione said offhandedly, alternatively pouring frog’s breath and wormsworth into the beaker until it was a murky gray-green. “Can I offer you a Healing spell? I’ve already figured out all the best ones, you see, and-–”
this Sunday morning.”
Five minutes later, they were en route to Draco Malfoy’s place. Hell, he never thought he’d be distressed enough to take Malfoy up on his hospitality, but desperate times called for desperate measures. Fortunately, it wasn’t far – Harry didn’t think he could spend too much more time waiting at traffic lights – and the views of California were stunning. The mountains were covered in little shrubs, trees, and cacti and the roadsides sported succulents and rock gardens, further accentuating the palm trees on every corner and yard. They passed an American school along the way, San Diego State University, and vaguely Harry wondered what it would be like to go there. He’d always loved being away at Hogwarts and felt strangely robbed of the summer he’d wasted in Auror training.
“Yes,” Draco managed, clutching Harry for support even though the bugger was enjoying unraveling him entirely too much.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” The ice was unpleasantly cool against his skin.
“I don’t give a flying fuck about this job,” snarls Malfoy. “And you ask ‘what will I do?’ The question really is ‘what
Harry caught Hermione’s eye before bursting out laughing, Hermione slapping the counter in her mirth. Ron’s face reddened, and he took a sip of coffee to cover his embarrassment. “Don’t even say it!” he exclaimed a moment later. “I don’t want to hear any more!”
“Do exactly what you’re doing now,” responds Harry. “Be there for me. Make me leave my house. Don’t let me fall into despair.”
Draco couldn’t meet her eyes.
If Hermione hadn’t been an expert at reading Draco, she wouldn’t have noticed how he started scrubbing ever-so-slightly faster and harder. His knuckles were white with how tightly they gripped the scrub brush.
“Beans rescheduled for tomorrow,” Draco said, watching Potter carefully.
“Apparently, they didn’t think ‘anything would come of the situation,’” Neville said, “‘Until they saw Mr. Malfoy accessing his magic with the intent to do harm.’”
Fixing him with a rigid glare, Draco let that one go. “There has to be somewhere you’ve always to go,” he said reasonably.
With that, Hermione began to sob. “There has to be a catch,” she said, gasping for breath.
Harry had never actually expected Malfoy to
“Yes. I’d like to see him, though probably not as badly as you do.”
“Mhm. Did you?”
, restoring both ceramics to their former condition. “And I’m not sure we were thinking,” he chuckled half-heartedly, spinning around in his chair. “Sure, the London boards suck more than the American ones, but we’d have probably been able to advance quickly since we’re, you know, the Chosen One and his best mate.”
He breathed deeply in an attempt to calm his raging mind, and looked over the London landscape with a sense of unease. This wasn’t right. It didn’t feel like home anymore, but then again, nowhere did. Not even Hogwarts, which Harry had stuck around to help rebuild after the war.
“What?” Potter asked, holding Draco tightly.
“Who said we were only dating for a few months?”
, Harry; Merlin knows you could use a little break.”
“I’m going to come, you have to stop.”
Draco put the letter down, too keyed up to even think about sleeping. He was trembling with excitement, with the need to write back to Harry
“Work for it then,” he proposes, an idea taking shape in his mind. “We’ve already talked about your questionable teaching ethics. It’s probably best for you to get a bit of practice in before the fall semester, so what if you take over for me at the Club and teach dueling?
With only a week to go until the big day, Draco was distraught, depressed, and entirely dissatisfied with his quality of life. He’d been doing some major thinking over the last few weeks, not all of it pleasant. There was always the option of going into the Wizarding World and living independently, even if it wasn’t up to his normal quality of life. Unfortunately, Draco’s former friends like Pansy and Blaise would no longer associate with him because he was branded; they had been able to weasel their way back into polite society and both had made it explicitly clear to him that they didn’t want him around to muck things up.
you want to talk to Harry, eh?” Weasley said wearily. “You couldn’t have written him a letter, oh, I don’t know, maybe like two weeks ago?”
“Should I go see what’s keeping him?” asks Harry, his eyes sparkling.
He was drawn out of his thoughts with a question from Hermione. “Draco, have you read through the latest issue of
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked. “You have so much to offer, Potter.” He crossed the distance between them in two strides, seizing Potter’s shoulders until he finally lifted his head to meet Draco’s eyes. “I’m your partner, Harry,” Draco said firmly. “If this relationship isn’t equal, you’ll eventually resent me.” His own gaze flickered away from Potter’s eyes and focused on some tall grass blowing in the breeze. “And I couldn’t live with that."
“Thankfully,” Draco echoed. “Let’s aim to send it off by the first of the New Year, shall we?” That gave them just over a month to put the application together.
εїз Ƹ̴Ӂ̴Ʒ εїз
“We have a new dawn,” says Draco fiercely. “Let’s make the most of it.” Harry pulls Draco into a passionate, loving kiss, and they stay out on the balcony long after the sun assumes its proper place in the sky.
“Do you really think that I can teach a bunch of kids how to play baseball if I don’t even know anything about the bloody sport?”
“What do you even do, Malfoy?”
After they completed their exhausting tour of the Manor, Tipsy brought them fresh pumpkin juice—per Potter’s request—and they went outside so Draco could show Potter the grounds. They spent another hour exploring everything from the duck pond to the apple trees to the vegetable gardens, which Potter loved. He went in and picked all the ripe fruits and vegetables, putting them into a wicker basket for Tipsy to carry up to the house. After some coaxing, Draco helped. Potter also had an especially good time stalking the white peacocks across the Manor's sprawling meadows, long grasses poking him through the softer spots in his trainers while Draco laughed himself silly at the sight of Potter chasing around the offended birds.
Draco forced himself to act nonchalant. “As if you have any effect on me. Don’t make me laugh, Finnigan, unless it’s at your clown-like face.”
“Oh, Merlin, I told him not to go out with Seamus tonight! You were there, right?”
“You’ve never cared about rules before,” Harry pointed out. It went unsaid that he had been just as deviant as Malfoy. “Surely it couldn’t have been bad enough to make you leave the Wizarding World?”
Another grin settles over Potter’s face, and he quickly stands, sitting on Draco’s legs and kissing him again before asking, “How do you want to do this?”
As Draco tore Harry’s white robe, and started mouthing at his nipples, he grabbed Draco’s hands and stilled them above his own head.
simply to practice with a partner of an equal or better skill level, tutor beginners, or simply watch, offering comments or having conversations about technique. Ron and Hermione taught lessons every Tuesday and Thursday, but he’d also roped several of the DA into also helping out. His own appearances at
“Let’s go home,” Harry said resolutely to Draco. He was certain the blonde was fixated on his disagreement with Molly, but there wasn’t much he could do about the situation now. He hadn’t grown up with a real family of his own, but if there was one thing Harry
After a breathless kiss, Harry said, “There’s an easier way” and flipped Draco’s body around. It was much easier this way, and Draco concentrated hard on giving the best pleasure he knew how. Draco soon discovered that Harry’s balls were very sensitive, and, when combined with sucking and swirling motion over the tip, caused his jaw to go slack around Draco’s cock. He also discovered that Harry liked it when his cock was deep down Draco’s throat and became quite erratic with pleasure when Draco held his hips down.
“Kill me now,” Blaise groans.
“Where are we going to go in funeral clothes?”
Pansy spies ice cream. “We’re eating first,” she says firmly, making a beeline for the table where the bowls and spoons are laid out. For once, we’re allowed to take as much as we want, and, somehow, life looks just a little better when you have a massive bowl of chocolate ice cream with a cherry on top.
Remorsefully, they retired from the porch with enough time for a restful night’s sleep before the morning grind of paper pushing and suspect profiling. Harry resigned himself to more anxiety and stress, secretly hoping though that Draco would get word to him soon. But until then, he vowed that his heart would not waver. He would not make that same mistake ever again.
me out to Dumbledore’s grave? I know you’re not out here to mourn; it’s not like you gave a shit about him.”
Getting frustrated, Harry pulls out his wand and moves to hex the bugger. He receives an unpleasant surprise, however, when his magic doesn’t work. Trying again with increasing desperation, Harry casts five sets of spells and is flabbergasted when none of them works either.
something else?” he sneered.
“How did this even happen?” Hermione asked, wiping up tea with one of Draco’s few usable dishcloths.
Harry laughs. “If you insist,” he says, with eyes sparkling. “Can I see you again tomorrow?”
“No thanks to you,” Hermione huffed, but with a twinkle in her eye. They sat down and started passing the dishes around family-style.
“You want to take it to the authorities?” asks Draco incredulously.
“I love you, you know that?”
They passed out soon after that, still lying entangled on the floor underneath the afghan. And that’s how Harry found them early the next morning when he lurched out of bed in search of Draco.
of Draco in the garden and that, by this time next week, they’d no longer have a home) and grabbing a quick bite before dashing over to Transfiguration.
“They are,” said Hermione miserably.
“Scratching the itch, Weaselbee?” Draco said witheringly from his spot just outside the corner fireplace, from where he had yet to move.
The more juvenile members of the team laughed uproariously again, encouraging even the more composed to join in. This was usually how it went.
had added illustrations that really supported their theory and called attention to the content.
– eyes softened then and Draco knew he’d made the right call. “It’s important to me too. Come on, Harry.”
Unable to keep from crying out, Harry feels another wave of helplessness sweep over him along with the pain of penetration. He tries his magic again to no avail. Desperation causes him to look around the posh bathroom and see if there is anything in sight he can possibly use as a weapon. There is a tall vase to his left, and though he can’t kick it into his attacker, he can probably get it as far as the door. Asten’s teeth scrape him again, and Harry decides to risk the broken limb. He slams his foot into the vase, aiming it towards the bathroom door, immensely grateful for wearing boots that night. It shatters rather loudly, breaking into a million pieces.
Under his breath, Draco whispered, “That’s what I’m afraid of.”
“Here, Abby,” Draco cooed, offering a treat before requesting that she take the envelope. Unfooled by his flattery, Abalona, chirped unhappily.
They walked to Draco’s car and slung the bags into the trunk, Draco rotating his shoulder in circles all the while in a futile effort to work out the pain.
Draco retrieved his finger and added more moisture before pressing back into Harry. He kissed him thoroughly, paying attention to a spot on his neck he remembered Harry liking during their time in the forest together. It seemed to work; he could see the tension leaving Harry’s and feel him relaxing the longer Draco continued to finger him. He added a second finger, using the increased motor control to explore until he finally brushed up against the prostate and Harry positively whined with pleasure. “Draco – now,” he moaned. “I need you right now.”
“Hey,” said Potter. “I don’t have any of those right now.”
Her words left him with an overlaying sense of guilt and regret. Harry made up his mind to talk to his friends before trying to win Draco back. After all, those visualizations he’d had earlier where they gave him advice could become reality if he played his cards right. Out of the two, Hermione was definitely the better person to approach first. Even despite her distaste for Draco, she had the ability to be mature and decent about difficult situations.
Nodding, Draco tried to breathe deeply and not feel uncomfortable. Just because no one had ever seen his cock didn’t mean that the experience would be bad. Harry was wonderful, after all.
“Oh, so you like me now?” teased Potter.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry sighed, slumping back into his chair and reclaiming his drink.
“Most definitely,” Harry said agreeably, pulling Draco in for a slow, passionate kiss.
“You might have or you did?!”
was a surprise. “Far cry from how you reacted last time.”
“Yes, yes,” Draco said impatiently, buttoning his own coat with gloved hands. “Are you ready to go now?”
The Weasleys were talking. The Weasleys were eating. The Weasleys were laughing. Draco thought his head was going to explode from the overstimulation. There was no way to find quiet in a family this large. Or so he was quickly learning. Harry thrived on the chaos, engaging in brotherly scuffles with George and Charlie and having a spirited conversation with Mr. Weasley about electrical sockets the next. The rules changed so often, it made Draco’s head spin.
“Let me guess, you’re on the chess team,” snorted Potter.
, giving Draco a chance to appreciate his own deviousness. Whatever else they might say about him, no one could accuse him of not being a Slytherin right up until the very end.
“Try your cake, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, patting Draco’s shoulder. Somehow, she was completely serious, so he lifted the forkful he’d never gotten a chance to eat and bit in. Unconsciously, Draco’s eyes closed as he savored the heaven that was Mrs. Weasley’s baking.
He glared at her.
Harry could have definitely wore better pants for this, not just better shoes. His dress slacks were going to quickly get holes in them from rubbing against the coarse cement. Ron was faring no better on the other side, but at least he’d had the foresight to change into some dark jeans. The potency of the smell increased as they neared the car doors; the windows were down, the men inside laughing.
“Want to see my favorite spot on campus?” asked Draco, taking a chance.
“You want to go back to
“Sure, ‘grateful,’” Malfoy complained.
"I hope you're right, Potter," said Draco.
He treated himself to a rare early morning croissant and coffee because, after all, dead men needed no gold.
Hermione pointed her wand at the tea kettle and turning it on before turning her attention back to Draco. “Are you quite sure that’s the best idea?”
He walked over to his closet and tore open the secret compartment he’d installed there in his very first week of school. Snatching his wand and waving it right before Steve’s mocking-yet-confused eyes, Draco snarled, “Obliviate!” Steve’s eyes glazed over, out of focus, and Draco regained his composure. Somehow realizing that the negative direction of the conversation had been largely his fault, Draco decided to give it another go. He said, “After you got back from lunch, you saw that I broke something and helped me clean it up. We were planning to do online shopping later today. ”
“Maybe I just don’t have any virtues,” smiled Potter wickedly, crinkling his eyes at Draco.
“But when you turn around to walk back to the base,” said Potter, now determined to impart baseball knowledge, “You always want to make sure you turn to the right, and not the left.”
They whack him.
A decision is made, and life goes on.
“I’m going to hold you to that, Potter,” said Malfoy. “In fact, after I slave around for you all day, maybe you’ll even see fit to buy me some dinner.”
Narcissa continued, “As you’ve so bluntly pointed out, I am no Death Eater. That doesn’t mean I am free of blame, but I have a chance for a new life. I can only wish you can trust in yourself and embrace the unknown as well.”
He still didn’t even want the position. Most of the names that circled through were those of former Death Eaters, and Harry began to feel more indignant each day that they continued to disturb the peace without the Dark Lord’s influence. He hadn’t saved the world for nothing.
“And does your father approve of your relationship with Harry?”
“Sorry,” Draco whispered back, pulling Harry in for another kiss. “I couldn’t sleep, and then Hermione came over about quarter-past one, and I couldn’t very well throw her out, could I?” He smiled, letting Harry know he was fine with what had happened.
towards Zee.
He was on the Ilvermorny Quidditch Pitch with Ron and a few other guys from school; they’d been playing competitively until the urge to sleep rendered him groggy and slow. Harry had been unable to sleep properly without Draco in his bed, warming him inside and out; the warm sun even seemed a poor substitute for his ex-boyfriend’s comforting presence.
“Harry, mate. Where’re you going?”
“He came to you with it, didn’t he?” Hermione retrieved her own Earl Gray and sat back down with the hot mug, unwilling to take a sip before it was cooler. “He told you before the article came out, he predicted how you’d react, and he told you that ignoring him would make him feel unloved and insecure.”
As Draco’s body continued to relax and become more aroused, he could take more of Harry, and they kept up the foreplay until Harry was deep inside Draco.
They spent the next week practicing with the team, coaching their girls, and doing nightly pitching/batting sessions. Draco’s aim slowly increased, and, even as Potter hit more of his inside pitches, he learned to place them in spots he knew Potter had difficulty with. All in all, they were improving. Potter took each and every opportunity to touch him, and Draco usually couldn’t help but lean into his touch. It was especially awkward if they were in front of the girls at the time, though he had better self-control then. They were already “shipping” their coaches, whatever that meant, and Draco didn’t want to add any fuel to their fire.
Draco continued to watch, fascinated, as another man stepped up to the rectangle-triangle and held up a bat. As soon as the man on the mound let go of the ball, the grumpy former batter leapt off the square and started running as fast as he could for the one directly behind the thrower. Before he could blink, the woman catching the ball behind the rectangle-triangle released the ball, just as fast, and the thrower ducked as the ball flew over his head. Suddenly, the grumpy batter was on the ground, and Nate shouted “Safe!”
Unable to say anything in return, he smiled back at her, hoping more effort wouldn’t be required to placate her.
He listened to Harry’s and Hermione’s suggestions to lay off the work once he woke up later, listening to Hermione pattering around the house as he started crocheting a new afghan and watched the neighbor’s cat evade Crookshanks. Draco hadn’t expected a response until Sunday at the earliest, but when Abalona returned that evening, slightly rumpled but in otherwise good condition, his stomach dropped.
“Oh don’t worry, you’ll be doing plenty of work,” Harry chuckles. “So I’ll talk to you later, then?”
“It was administrated frequently in my household.”
He amused himself by casting little golden streams of light into the air and forming them into abstract patterns, deciding that when Malfoy arrived he was getting all the grunt work for the day. Finally, at a quarter past eight, Malfoy strode into the Great Hall. Harry noticed that he was again dressed in Muggle clothes. Today he wore another pair of blue jeans and a red T shirt.
He hadn’t intentionally waited until she took a sip of tea to say it, but it turned out that way. She sprayed tea all over the table, coughing.
He’d been hoping to meet someone else as he walked down the corridor as to give them scathing looks that perfectly described what he thought of the Ministry, and by extension, bureaucracy, but unfortunately the halls were empty. Dawlish’s door was closed. Without knocking, Harry threw open the door and inhaled, preparing for the torrent of angry words that would follow.
“Right,” he says, forcing all thoughts of sex out of his mind. Harry meets Seamus’s gaze again and confirms their plans for tomorrow. Out of the corner of his eye as he opens the door, Harry sees the brunet back up and let Seamus mount him. Aroused beyond belief and nearly kicking himself for not participating, he gets the hell out of there.
Draco was frustrated and trying to keep on a nice face, but even Potter looked like he was at the end of his rope.
For once, Malfoy was quiet, because they had finally, reached the inner dungeon where the most renovations were necessary.
With a curt nod, Draco excused himself from the table and went to the single stall bathroom, where he locked himself in to hide until the end of dinner. Only after the campers had been dismissed to Singing Tree did he return to the table and snag the rest of his bread for later.
“But look how he’s weaseled his way into our family!” shouted the Weasel. “Bloody hell, Mum, you’re feeding him Auntie Muriel’s cake!”
Potter’s face floated into his mind yet
“I can’t help but wonder,” Neville mused, “If things are going to be any better for Draco out in the Wizarding World.”
All in all, in a weird way Draco found himself almost starting to get used to the muggle world, though people still hadn’t gotten over his accent. Several times, he almost glamoured himself before leaving his dorm because of all the bloody attention he inevitably drew from the Americans. The only problem was that everyone (on campus, at least) already knew what he sounded like and would have been really suspicious had he suddenly dropped his posh, carefully enunciated dialect.
Comprehension dawns, and Harry meets the eyes of Seamus’s friend Asten with a sinking feeling of despair.
Ron and Hermione are unable to get along with Malfoy, making Harry feel forced to choose between Draco and his friends.
They made it to Hogwarts right after the first bell rang, and Draco ran pell-mell for the dungeons and mercifully made it there before the late bell. Hermione was waiting by their cauldron, tapping her foot disapprovingly.
“Well, we’re here for you, mate, if there’s anything at all,” Ron ventures gently.
Unbeknownst by Draco, on the other side of the world, Abalona was swifty descending from her rigorous flight pattern and quickly approaching the Sunset Cliff Apartments. It was quite late, or early, as it so happened, but Harry and Ron had occasion to be awake. Also unbeknownst to Draco, they’d be taking the promotional advancement boards later that morning, an exam that determined their fate with the American Aurors: pass, and advance to second-class Junior Aurors, which bore the privilege of early advancement, administrative favor, and more time in the field; or fail, and remain third-class Junior Aurors, disappointing their superiors that expected so much from them, and continue the dreary task of pushing paperwork in the office.
“Oh?” Potter intoned, raising his eyebrow in an uncanny impression of Draco.
Catching the Snitch now made him feel numb; lifeless, even. Everything had gone so wrong so fast, and Harry didn’t have any clue how to make things right again. He’d freaked out when, as soon as he left for the states, Draco refused to contact him at all. He’d reacted impulsively, to be sure, by threatening to come check up on him if he didn’t write back within a certain amount of time. It had been stupid, he thought regretfully. Draco never responded well to ultimatums, and that hadn’t been the time to try and achieve a different result. They’d had a good thing going, and he put too much stress on their budding relationship too soon. Somehow, he’d thought they were more
“Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks, as Lord Black I formally invite you back into the House of Black and grant you both your Allowance Vaults. The new Lord Black has been asked to remove you again the moment you disrespect your family in any way.”
Draco.
“You have your pick of an estate from either the Potters or the Blacks, though I recommend the Black Cottage in Italy, it’s sunny there with lots of open space, you would like it. As Lord Black I officially welcome you back into the Black family and therefore reinstate your Allowance Vault. If I could, I would have named you my heir but you know that’s not possible. You also might find that Amelia Bones comes into contact with you shortly, I’ve given her a rat to think about.”
Severus was on high alert the moment he entered the Dark Lord’s office. There was a new player in the game and, as Slytherin as Severus was, he needed to know more about this man before he could ever think about serving him.
Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter
“We should return to Grimmuald now, my Lord,” Black said from beside his mate. “The old coot will be wondering what you wanted to speak to us about. I’ll give my report to Neville as usual?”
No one that is, except Hadrian Peverell.
Barty released his protective hold on Luna when she moved to approach Hadrian again and watched the young Malfoy’s face as she sat on Hadrian’s lap. They fit perfectly together and young Draco seemed to think so too. The jealousy clearly written across his face. Barty hoped Hadrian gave up trying to respect the blonde’s boundaries soon because he really didn’t want to watch the boy spew hormones everywhere for the next two months. For his Lord’s sake as well as everyone who had to watch them.
Draco Malfoy meets the new boy in town
“I, Harry James Potter-Black, of sound mind, magic and body do hereby declare this as my last will and testament. All previous wills should be overridden and this will sealed only by the word of the new Lord Potter-Black.” Harry’s voice rang out through the room as everyone listened intently to the young man.
I really have no excuse other than a whole lot of writers block and just life. Thank you all so much for your comments and love while I was away, reading through them always leaves me in the best mood. This story is coming up to the stage where things are happening a little further apart and a whole bunch of new characters will be introduced as Hadrian and Draco make their way to both Death Eater meetings and Hogwarts. Tom and Hadrian have been planning for a long time and they have no desire to rush and fuck up so they're going to enjoy themselves watching Dumbledore squirm trying to figure out what they'll do next and when.
“Not perfect,” he answers honestly, “But better than I was.”
“I’m over here
“Harry!” cried Hermione. He quickly closed his jaw and sat up straight, plastering a smile on his face before Draco could cast scrutinizing eyes at him. “Harry,” she repeated, more quietly, once they’d clambered into the desks nearest Harry. “Why didn’t you tell me that Malfoy crochets? I’ve wanted to learn for
“I do really like that ridge texture,” admitted Hermione.
Pansy was waiting in line at the dumping grounds, also accompanied by a wheelbarrow which was full to the brim with poo.
Potter remained quiet, waiting to hear Draco’s answer. “I just want to travel with you,” he reluctantly admitted. “Even if we went to bloody Siberia, I would enjoy it because I was with you.”
Ron choked, spraying treacle tart crumbs all over the clean counter. Harry pounded him on the back, snickering. “Ron loves all the cannolis, ‘Mione,” he said knowingly, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
“Not for long,” Harry grumbled. “Cawaine is taking me out for bangers and ale tonight.”
“Sir, Mr. Harry Potter is here to see you! Topsy is giving Mr. Harry Potter biscuits, but he is not wanting them, Sir! He makes poor Topsy come and fetch Master Draco!”
“You and whoever you’re with come back to mine, and they can search rentals while you teach me how to play some bloody baseball.”
is too generalized for our purposes.”
“I meant what I said to Harry. No matter what happens, I'm furthering my education. Even if I don’t get into a Mastery program, then I’ll work on finding Potions Masters and persuading one of them to take me on as an apprentice.”
That set off another round of laughter, and they knocked over Draco’s prized coffee table in their mirth.
“I never wanted to disappoint you,” Draco said honestly. “I love you too much to watch you go through that.”
Under the guise of using the bathroom, I slip out of the dining hall, over the spacious back porch, and down the path, trying not to look too sneaky. I’ve been sweating for ages, but there was no way I was pulling up my sleeves in there. At Camp Cedarwood, everyone already knows who I am so there’s nowhere to hide, but here, maybe someone’s glance could just pass over me without thinking something nasty.
“Draco,” he said. “We are not ending this because of some media interference. The only people who make decisions about our relationship are us.”
“Why are you still here?” Harry asked, still sleepy.
attracted to him.
“I figured,” said Hermione, smirking. “Well, you’ll learn one of these days, I suppose…”
Draco shoved him. “Thanks a lot,” he grumbled. “Though in some ways, it has been oddly freeing.”
“Of course we will. Now go already."
“Same,” Draco said, surprising himself yet again. “It’s so
Draco sat on his lap and kissed him deeply. “You sound like me,” he said when they broke apart. “Or, rather, me as I used to sound. A self-respecting Malfoy would have never shared so much private information.”
“It gets easier after you do a couple rows,” Cecelia said sympathetically, calmly demonstrating the motion again. “Some people find it a bit harder to grip until there’s some meat on the piece.”
Draco loved his new muggle clothing, when it
Draco gave an impatient hiss. “I’m ready now, Potter.”
That’s all it took to set him off again.
does, for crying out loud.”
Draco could feel a blush rising on his cheeks. Though he’d meant to catch Harry off-guard, the thought he was finally ready to take their relationship one step further was an endearing—if nerve-wracking—one.
With the need for sleep overcoming him, Draco Apparated home. He sought out Mother, who helped him heal the injuries he’d incurred much earlier in the day, and then Draco treated himself to a shower. In bed, he found himself anxiously waiting for tomorrow. And he resolutely told himself that it was not simply because of Potter.
Malfoy was looking at him as if he’d grown an extra head. “You think it’s safe for me to spend the day with those two?”
“Yes, I suppose so,” Hermione responded with a hint of sarcasm.
Nate, unfortunately, had other ideas. “Team meeting after practice!” he shouted, as he, Mike, and Zee executed their final (quite perfect) double play.
"Yeah, but what if I don't know what I want anymore, Ron?" asked Harry quietly.
Draco awoke the next morning rather unusually bright and early, though admittedly he had slept through all of last night as well as the previous afternoon. Funnily enough, there was a ghost of a smile on his face, and he could only wonder where it came from and what was causing it. For too long, there hadn’t been any proper reason for Draco to feel happy at all, not even when Celestina Warbeck was slapped with a plagiarism lawsuit.
Harry couldn’t help snickering as he remembered what happened the last time he decided to shoot someone’s brains out in a car—only then, it was unfortunately
He loved Pansy, but he tolerated attitude from no one, her included. The only thing to be done was to give her a superior glare. “Pans, love, you know my strategy for avoiding extra work. We’ve been over it at least a hundred times.”
After a moment, Draco came back down to earth too and looked at Harry with a dazed expression on his face. Harry laughed, pulling him down for another hug.
“If we can make this quick, let’s stop and get some coffee after,” Harry said.
He paced around the mound while Potter loosened up his shoulders swinging their heaviest bat. Draco was unpleasantly aware that not only would Potter be able to see every one of his facial expressions while he pitched, he’d also get to see his body movements as well. And there was a large probability of him doing something embarrassing. He wasn’t well-versed enough in pitching to keep from making mistakes yet.
Draco gave him a horrified look. “Gods, no. I’m in the Debate Club, where I can destroy idiots with my sarcastic, godly wit and people actually
“I’m leaving now, you heartless beast,” Harry teases. He extracts himself from Draco’s body and stands, letting the pins and needles work their way out of his muscles.
“No, you absolute moron,” said Harry, rolling his eyes. “Only sometimes. You know how it works, don’t you? Seeing as you’ve been reading my mind for at least that long. I can really only access your thoughts and emotions when your guard is down.”
Crushed, Jake’s eyes started welling up again. Draco couldn’t think of anything helpful to say, so he apologized. “I’m sorry, Jake.” It wasn’t as hard as some of the apologies he’d had to make to other wizards, at least.
Harry sat down beside her at the table, setting down their plates of sandwiches and apple slices. “But you still get to have some kind of pastry for breakfast, right?”
had faced Voldemort on multiple occasions until they finally killed him. Yet they weren’t swimming in paperwork.
“Just wait and see.”
He pulled on a black pair of pants and ran a comb through his hair, ambling off to the kitchen. Draco expected to be greeted by the smell of fresh oranges, or by sizzling pancake batter. Maybe even a whiff of fresh flowers should Harry have felt one of his lovely creative impulses. Instead, he found an entirely different sight: Harry was sitting on the floor next to the mountain of letters, intently staring at a piece of parchment clutched tightly in his hands.
“I’ll leave you to your lurid jaunts, mate,” Ron sighs. “Just don’t come bitching to me when you’re all over the special Sunday edition of the
“–and spouses,” broke in José.
Potter laughed. “That’s so normal. I was expecting you to say something like ‘salmon and white wine’ or ‘roasted eggplant and zucchini medley.’ I would have never guessed that your favorite foods are mashed potatoes and grilled cheese sandwiches.”
“Draco,” Potter said softly. “When we were at school, back in sixth year, did you feel something for me?”
Walking into the living room, Harry yawns. “What are you doing up this early?” He asks sleepily, rumpling his hair.
Nobody knew what the verdict of the team’s summer plans would be before Monday. Harry and Cale were anxious and hoping for yes’s across the board, while Chris had grudgingly gotten cleared with his job because of the eager persistence he was faced with at home. Finally, Monday’s ballgame came, and the roommates –very much sober–put on their brand new uniforms and made their way to field.
