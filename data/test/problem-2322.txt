And then Draco was positioning himself over Harry’s cock, and then Harry felt him everywhere, all over, and the bright heat of him made Harry see stars.
It was like the kiss on the dock – no, better than that, because there were no fairy tears involved, only one cocktail and not even a strong one. This was real, and it was happening, and Draco could hardly believe that it was, but it
“God, you’re gorgeous like this,” Robbie said, his fingers digging into Harry’s hips. “I was singing to you all night, Harry. Only you.”
Draco pulled away suddenly, staring. It was Cassius, sans Harry. No Pansy anywhere. “Where the fuck did everyone go?” he asked.
Harry nearly stomped his foot and said to hell with you, but he did want to hear what Malfoy had to say, so he followed him to the room where he and Pansy always had tea.
Draco, much to his displeasure, found himself considering this. “Well. I’d say Granger, since she and Weasley have been together for so long, but I’m half convinced this arrangement is merely Step One of her big, lesbian awakening, and so in that event, she’s probably sick to death of Weasley’s prick. Besides, I know how much you love getting reamed because you insist on telling me all the bloody time. So, you, I suppose.”
Since he’d joined Lia’s company, Edwin had mostly left him alone. Draco’d noticed him watching from time to time, especially whenever William was around. Honestly, though, William was often gone, dealing with problems at the border and overseeing raids on slavers. He and Draco had spent very little time together.
“But what about the porn? And the whole sex club thing? And all your escapades with – “ He shuddered. “
“Good point,” said Seamus, who was sitting up front next to the driver. He turned around. “You’ve great foresight, Dean.”
“It’s not like that,” said Malfoy. “It’s…it’s just for appearances, really. It’s expected of him, to have a wife. I understand, of course. I would’ve done the same thing had I stayed where I was, you know, in Malfoy Manor. I’d have married a woman and carried on with someone, probably.”
“I have to see if it’s been tampered with,” Draco said. “I think it either must’ve been altered, somehow, or Polyjuice was involved. If I can figure out which it was, I can try to narrow down the list of people who might’ve done it.”
On Saturday, after leaving Potter‘a place, Draco went shopping with Pansy on Diagon, followed by a few stops on Jermyn Street where Blaise joined them. He returned home that night with bags and bags of flashy new robes and smart muggle suits and shirts and shoes. If one was going to make an ex desperate for them, looking hot was essential, so Draco considered this a necessary investment. That night, he and Pansy tackled two bottles of wine and fell asleep with florescent green mud masks on, which smeared all over his cream-colored couches by morning. Thank Merlin for cleaning spells.
And besides, Potter ought to have ducked immediately back out. But instead, the git had stood there with his mouth hanging open.
“No, you’re not. I can tell that you’re not. You have that clenchy jaw thing going on that you get sometimes.”
Seamus looked normal – no bruises or swelling around his hazel eyes, no blood on his teeth, no wincing when he moved around in his seat. The relief was so great that Harry almost didn’t mind when Seamus saw him looking and glowered in response.
Draco laughed, because it was how you’d speak to a stranger. “Congratulations to you, too. You must be so happy that Ari’s coming to join us next week.”
Draco laughed too and kissed him again. “I don’t know, but I felt it too, that was…it was a lot. But it’s okay. Everything’s fine.”
He shrunk the Turner down so that it would fit neatly inside, and looked at the papers he’d been clutching.
The warden admitted Draco into the dungeon and handed him the key to Edwin’s cell. Draco walked past cell after cell filled with men who’d refused to swear loyalty to William, or who had taken too active a role in the ousting of William’s family from Septerra to be forgiven. And there, near the end of the corridor, was Edwin, looking very different from the last time Draco had seen him.
Harry wracked his brain for something else he might say, some way to keep talking. He didn’t want to leave Malfoy all by himself, and more than that, he felt like there were so many things he
Draco’s mother had been spending more and more time in London, and it suited her.  She seemed improved, somewhat, from the way she’d been last fall. Still not recovered, obviously, from Lucius’s death, but not quite as hopeless as before. Merlin, there had been weeks last fall where Draco suspected she hadn’t gotten out of bed at all, though she denied it. Draco thought, for the first time since his father had died, that she might eventually find some measure of happiness, despite the loss of him.
He did not take them off, thank Jesus, but instead swept up onto Harry’s chair so that he was standing atop it, and then moved one foot over to maybe-Tessa’s chair, and then did the teasing thing again with his pants but actually slid them down over his arse for a while, rolling his hips, before sliding them back up. Then he maneuvered so he was in almost a push-up position over them both, and faux-humped Harry while thrusting his face around in maybe-Tessa’s crotch. It was another impressive show of strength, really. And also, Harry was hard and wanted nothing more than to sink into the floorboards because there was no way Malfoy hadn’t noticed by now. No flipping way.
Draco didn’t reply, only scooted lower and licked a firm stripe along the thick shaft of Harry’s cock.
“First, pull your trousers down. I can hardly see any of you,” Draco said, leaning back once more against the desk.
“You’ve brought our consultant. I’ve got to work with him, and you’ve decided to start shagging him.”
“I had a brilliant time,” Draco said, giving him a small smile. “Can’t remember the last time I stayed up until sunrise. I imagine it was with you.”
Evangeline looked back and forth between the two of them. “What is this?” she asked. "Did you used to date or something? What is this vibe I'm sensing?"
“Ughn,” Potter moaned, putting his mouth against his curled fist. He was trembling all over, shaking like a leaf, and every time Draco fucked him with his tongue, he was bucking back against him like he couldn’t help himself. Draco licked and sucked and bit gently, and let his hand palm Potter’s bollocks. Potter was being bloody loud now, and Draco felt every one of the sounds he made deep in his belly, causing something inside of him churn and burn with heat.
Draco wracked his brain and then remembered Potter’s words prior to the nap. Draco found himself laughing. “No. I’m not saying it. You played dirty, Potter. You lured me into your sleep trap.”
“Yes, I understand, but Potter…he wants to be with me, Blaise. Or did, anyway, before I mucked it all up. And that felt good, to think that I could be with someone without all these…complications.”
“I’m with Hermione,” said Harry. “I didn’t think he was unattractive in school, either, although his personality ruined him. But yes, he looks a million times better. He’s…um. He’s gorgeous. I don’t think that’s an overstatement of the situation, either.”
He spent the early part of the day curled up in a chair in front of the fire, reading a horribly scary book about a woman who was possessed by a demon. So far as Harry knew, demons didn’t exist. After he’d read a few chapters of the book, he really hoped that was true.
“You must be some kisser,” Pansy said to Seamus, though even she looked a little uncertain now. Seamus spun the bottle and landed on Mandy, and stalked over to her with purpose, and kissed her deeply, with plenty of tongue, and people cheered and Mandy grinned. Only when he returned to his spot, and Mandy spun again, taking the attention off of him, he didn’t look proud of himself. He just looked sad.
“Oh shit,” Jess said, blowing a bubble with her gum, which blondie popped with a finger. Jess hustled back over to her booth, then stuck her head out the window. “Tell him to come to Broomstick!” she hissed, then turned to a man waiting there impatiently.
“We’d have the City Guard to contend with as well,” Berold said tiredly. “Our numbers don’t even come close to matching theirs, even if we gathered everyone.”
Harry looked over at Ginny, and suddenly she seemed very small where she sat, sort of curled in on herself. He remembered the first time he’d met her, how she’d been afraid to even say hello to him, how red-faced she’d been, how young. He remembered in the aftermath of the war, how he’d sagged against her and she’d held him and stroked his hair. He remembered the night she first told him she loved him, that she’d
Lucius nodded. “I’ll deal with him. Come with me now, Draco. You need to prepare yourself to see him.”
was the one to die, he might be rushing to meet that death. And if he took himself beyond his date of death in this timeline, he died for real. He died completely.
The third thing that became clear was that there was an ancient prophecy in Etherean lore about the Dragon coming to save the Etherean people. The Dragon would be a stranger from the mountains, and would hold the power of the worlds in his hands. Draco assured them that while his name meant dragon, and he was a stranger, he had
“Always you, Harry, always,” He panted, squeezing his eyes shut. He let out a guttural cry as Harry added another finger. “You’re the only one who’s fucked me since I was seventeen. Every time.”
“He fell silent. For several moments they all did, and the quiet had the feel of a deliberate thing. Then Eddie said, "All right, we're back together again. What the hell do we do next?”
“Hey, what are you guys doing next year?” Mandy asked. Her finger was up in the air, tracing one of the constellations.
When the second week ended, they were leaving in their sailboat, taking the next month or two to sail down the coast, with no real plans. Astoria and Blaise were coming to pick up Scorpius that Friday, and they were staying for dinner. Draco didn’t know it, but Ron and Hermione and Pansy and Sarah and Luna were coming too.
Pansy shrugged. “Let’s see,” she said. She used the clacky-board to write the question in a box that had appeared on the glass, and then all of a sudden, hundreds of words popped up. She used a little clacky thing to point to one of them, and then a different picture came up, and it said 238,900 miles.
“Well, that’s a load of bollocks,” says a voice from behind the curtain. A tall, thin man with a ramrod-straight spine and white-blonde hair steps out. He is wearing zebra-striped robes and his dragonhide boots clack against the wood of the stage. He has really grown into his features and he’s indisputably gorgeous -- perfect almost, except for the pointiness of his chin. “That’s not what happened at all.” His gray eyes narrow as he stares at the narrator.
it? In what world, Potter? The way I’ve lived my life, I should be grateful to still be alive. Could’ve ended up like my father. Should have, probably.”
“To the gate, come on, Draco,” William said, tugging at his arm. He cast a glance over at Harry, who was dodging a blade and then an arrow in quick succession (one of their own arrows – Merlin, it was so hectic and confused up here that the archers, even perched atop the wall as they were, could hardly tell where to take aim) and then ran after William, flinging one guard aside with a wave of Sen, and then casting at another. Soon, they were on another set of circular stairs, going around and around towards the ground, and then William was throwing himself into a guard who was coming up the stairs, and sending him tumbling backwards. The guard knocked against the stone wall and rolled down a few more steps before lying still, but then another guard was jumping over that one, and William pushed at him, but the man dove around, and then he was coming at Draco.
Harry approached him slowly, like he was afraid Draco would bolt. He stood and looked at him for a moment before roughly pulling him close. Draco forgot he was holding floo powder and set his hands on Harry’s back, the feel of it incredibly familiar. He thought of the many nights in the other timeline that he’d rubbed soft circles across it until Harry had fallen asleep.
Harry’s bathroom, the one he’d been showering in the night everything between them went to shite. He was using a straight razor to shave, and he looked gorgeous. He moved the razor down over his jawline, then dipped it into the water and flicked it towards the camera, laughing, like the photographer had said something particularly hilarious. The lens was splattered with shaving cream and water before the photo looped and went back to the beginning.
“So says commitment’s number one enemy,” said Draco. “And clearly you’re not dating the same sort of drama queens that I am, Potter. I feel like
Harry’d been put off by Zabini at first, but he wasn’t really that bad. He’d gotten a lot nicer since the war, or maybe he was just expanding his social circle to include more people. Maybe he’d always been gregarious and jolly among the Syltherins. Either way, these days, he was easy to be around: boisterous, loud, always ready with a joke, and rarely serious.
“I’ll have you know I showered this morning, too,” said Potter. “Smell,” he said, thrusting his insane mop of hair under Draco’s nose. Draco unwillingly inhaled, expecting to be grossed out, but instead, he was met with a delicious sort of coconut-y smell, and with the pleasant warmth of Potter’s skin, and with the sensation of being tickled to death by Potter’s deceptively silky locks.
“You missed the afterparty,” Ari said. God, he looked really sexy at the moment, a little disheveled and tousled, his soft pink shirt open at the collar and rolled up at the sleeves. “We all went out to a pub right after the event was over.”
Malfoy was kissing Harry in a way that felt like possession, like he was seizing ownership of Harry’s mouth, of his body, of his mind.  Malfoy’s mouth was soft and wicked and demanding against Harry’s, and Harry found himself pressing Malfoy back against the wall, caging him in.
Draco knew that if he had done what he should’ve, he would know, already, how this was going turn out. He’d have the votes counted and secured. He ought to have known. He ought to have made sure they would win long before today, ought to have worked relentlessly until he had seven yeses in his pocket. He sat there, downcast, feeling like he had failed Harry.
Draco stared at him, unable to believe what he was hearing. Harry Potter, who had everything a man could ever want, waiting there for him at home – hero-status, fame and fortune, the goodwill of the masses, the ear of everyone of import, friends in every corner of the country – was offering to give it all up to live in a world where he was unknown and didn’t even have the magnificent power that made him who he was, just so Draco didn’t have to face his demons.
Felix and his friends found a vacant space against one of the glass barriers that overlooked the lower level, and, still chatting and laughing, began to dance. Penny was floaty, just like she had been downstairs, and Eloise began to dance very low to the ground, shaking her arse in a way that was quite unexpected, and sort of explained her x-rated artwork. Within moments some muscley, tattooed guy was dancing close behind her. Robbie and Felix moved around the way blokes tended to, but they didn’t look half bad doing it.
He sent the power along his arms, right down to the rope, and imagined burning away the fibers, disappearing the ties bit by bit.
Biscuit seemed better in January. She didn’t seem inclined to leave the house, and Harry didn’t really want her to anyway, but she was up and about, and eating normally. In late March, she got sick again, and stopped getting out of bed. Harry took her to the vet, who said there wasn’t much to be done. Lily and Al were staying with Harry the weekend she passed, and as much as Harry didn’t want them to have to deal with the whole thing, he was glad for their company. Harry cast a numbing charm on Biscuit on Saturday, trying to alleviate some of her pain (if she was in pain; it was hard to tell), and was holding her and petting her on Sunday when she died, so that was good, at least. She wasn’t alone.
“I’d take a vodka soda. Don’t give a shit what kind,” Felix said, giving a sideways smile. “I think Penny’s probably okay. Maybe a water for her.”
One scientist compared the brain in a dying body to a city during a power-outage, when one neighborhood at a time goes dark. As the still-bright sections of the brain try to process the changes that are occurring (as they watch sections nearby shut down, one by one), they do what they’ve always done: come up with a story, inevitably shaped by experience and expectation, that explains the rolling blackout.
The smoking had been the first thing about him to change, according to Ginny, back when Ginny was still speaking to him.
Before he left, he checked around the property for a sign of Stormy, just in case, although he had little hope. She wasn’t there.
“Fine, then, go crawling back to him. Give him what he wants. It won't make any difference to me,” Malfoy huffed, crossing his arms. “But I
Draco had to work atop one of the smaller stages for a while, then do an hour of availability in the private rooms. Harry booked one for the three of them, just because, and Hermione and Luna agreed to go in once they heard about the champagne. Harry assured them that Draco wouldn’t be dancing for them. “Maybe we could ask him to dance part of the time,” said Luna dreamily.
Instead, Harry set about getting pissed once more, because why not. He played spin-the-bottle and snogged everyone from Luna to Hannah Abbot, who straddled his lap and got him uncomfortably hard, which was her way of announcing to the world that she was single, apparently. Ernie was seated next to Daphne, of course, and was looking at Hannah like maybe he’d dodged a bullet.
Ron looked over to where Malfoy was talking to one of the other older guys while petting Dominic’s arm. “Maybe.”
They had lunch at a little café off Diagon, all of them bemoaning the loss of their children. Harry didn’t feel too distraught – he would be joining the kids at Hogwarts tonight for the Welcome Feast.
They hadn’t seen his mother since tea yesterday. Draco was used to her spending long periods of time by herself in her room – she had been doing that since Father died. But perhaps she’d like the company, the chance to get out of the house. “I could ask. You’d really want her to?”
When they were about halfway up the endless drive, Pansy Parkinson came shrieking out of the door. “Oh Salazar, thank goodness!” she cried, literally running at them. She looked different than she usually looked in the Ministry, where she wore trendy glasses and smart, designer robes, and had her hair in a sleek black bob. She was wearing
But then again, he’d seemed fragile during the war. Harry had wondered about him, at the time. Even before the war, there was the bathroom, where Malfoy had been crying. Harry could picture his tear-stained, blotchy face so clearly, still, all these years later.
Hermione leaned over and put an arm around him. “You’re the only one who knows the answer to this, Harry. We can’t tell you what to do. If you think you made a mistake, talk to him. If you think he wasn’t the right person for you and this just sped up the inevitable, let him go.”
be nice. If you know what’s good for you,” Potter said, sliding a second finger up Draco’s arse, making him cry out.
“Berold, for fuck’s sake!” Draco cried, gesticulating wildly. “These are not horses and we did not steal them! We are not drunk, and we did not eat any questionable fungi! Lia’s telling the truth! They’re unicorns.”
The knock sounded again, and he glanced at the grandfather clock that stood proud against the wall. It was 12:20. His mind raced over the possibilities: this wouldn’t be Pansy; she would have come through the floo. His mother would, too, if there had been an emergency of some sort. Blaise might come to the door, but why he would be here at this hour, Draco had no idea. Hermione, maybe. She and Pansy might’ve just finished up their night, and maybe she wanted to find out whether her matchmaking efforts had been effective. Although, even if she wouldn’t have marched in through the floo, she likely would have floo-called rather than showing up on his doorstep.
be a big hit there. Ooh, I can just imagine him doling out spankings.” She giggled and made what he expected was supposed to be a sexy face. “Ooh, Daddy,
They talked a bit about the weekend, and Harry mentioned the incident with Scorpius Malfoy. Molly got a worried look in her eyes, but Harry assured her that he would be supervising any possible future get-togethers. “Scorpius is surprisingly sweet,” he said. “I was shocked, honestly."
,” Ari said, his hand dipping lower along Harry’s back, close to the curve of his arse. “For instance, thanks to the Prophet, I know you’ve gone out with men and women. Would you believe that I find that terribly interesting?”
“So you don’t want to?” Draco asked, looking suddenly worried. “Because you don’t have to, you know.”
Draco knocked timidly against the wood frame of the entry to the one of the women’s bunkers, the one that housed Frankie and Lia. One of the Badgers, a tiny girl named Ulfwynn who only came up to the middle of Draco’s chest, poked her dirty-blond head out. “Evening, Dragon,” she said with a smirk. “And which lucky lady might you be seeking?”
Draco saw Laurel running towards the slaughter, her hand outstretched, but he knew that she was only so strong, magically. She couldn’t stop this.
Harry worked him open quickly, and Draco felt little resistance in his body. They must’ve been doing this a lot, for his hole to be so obliging. All the while Harry’s mouth was hot on his, devouring, and Harry was moaning as he pushed into Draco with his fingers.  Harry’s other hand reached down and wrapped around his cock and began to stroke up and down the shaft slowly, and Draco threw his head back and cried out. “You’re already fucking ready, just like that,” Harry whispered. “You’re ready for me.
good to be here, despite all that. To Harry, who had never felt like he belonged anywhere, not entirely, it felt strangely like coming home.
He kept shaking his head for a moment, and then he put his face in his hands and Harry sat there, not knowing what to do as he watched his shoulders trembling.  He felt something cool on his own face, and touched at it, only to realize that his cheeks were wet. It surprised him, somehow.
He wanted to see Rom and Hermione. Not to talk about this, but just to see them, to feel the camaraderie and easy company that had carried him through the last seven-plus years. Only they were probably in Ron’s room, which was also Draco’s room, which was also Blaise’s room.
Unfortunately, it was entirely unhelpful, as the shapes were not any that he had ever encountered. Some were similar to Etruscan runes and some looked almost like Phoenician, although none of them were exactly right. “I can’t read any of it,” he murmured. Even if he tried to attribute meaning to the symbols that looked somewhat familiar, it didn’t make sense when combined. It was all gibberish.
Harry and Draco are stuck in the forest. Not much to do besides walk and talk and argue. Oh, and try not to die.
“I should have. I’m sorry I didn’t. And I felt it, too. That day. I didn’t recognize it, because I didn’t…that was before I really accepted that I liked men. But it was there, too, for me.”
“I did propose to Astoria, when I thought you were still with Ginevra, when I expected that the two of you would be married sooner or later. I thought…well, I thought that we’d both marry and still have whatever it was we had. It wasn’t ideal, but I thought it was what you wanted. I even told Astoria that I would only marry her if I could keep seeing you –”
Harry put his hands over his ears. “Stop it!” he cried. “You’re like my bloody sister! I don’t want to hear about your sex life.”
him, in some small way. “Well, anyway, back to you and me. I wasn’t exactly nice to you, either, Hermione. Not while we were in school. I said some horrible things. A lot of horrible things, if I’m honest. You hated me, too.”
Harry paused in his stomping and turned, and his heart nearly broke to see Scorpius running towards him, crying and looking frantic. “Oh, hey, sorry. I’m sorry. That probably freaked you out, huh?”
Draco pulled off his gauzy, thin sweater and handed it to Harry, who pulled it on, trying not to eye Draco’s lean, lanky torso with its crisscrossed scars. He’d kissed along every one of those. Many times.
Perhaps he could believe it a little, though. There was nothing wrong with believing it a little, with having some measure of hope.
She wanted to scream at him, to pound on his chest. She wanted to ask him why Sarah, some American he’d never met in his life until three months ago, warranted such attention. Why he would drop everything, leave his wife and child in Leeds to go running off to her bedside. But she didn’t do any of those things. Screaming and throwing a fit would get her nowhere, and the truth was, she already knew why he was going, and it had not a thing to do with Sarah. He was going for Harry’s sake.
Draco realized he was practically dying of thirst. “Oh, Merlin, yes,” he said, and then, to his amazement, Harry gently hoisted him up into a sitting position, kept an arm around him, and put the canteen to his lips. “I can hold it myself, damnit,” Draco grumbled, flushing at Harry’s proximity. He grabbed the canteen and drank a few gulps before handing it back. Harry took it and sat back on his bed.
“All your bits are covered,” Draco said, “which is more than I can say for Pans. And you do look gorgeous.” She did, too. Pansy had gussied up her hair and makeup, and she was surprisingly fit underneath all the button-ups and cardigans and work robes that she usually wore.
He never called Avan again after that second date. What was the point? He couldn’t tell Avan anything about himself, and even if he did, Avan wouldn’t understand it. They could never really know one another. He went back to having sex in loos, and that was that.
“Thanks,” Harry said, incredibly touched. He noticed Draco was reading another muggle book, this one called
Fucker, he thought. Blaise couldn’t fucking help himself, could he. Blaise thought he had total control over their dynamic, thought he called all the shots. But he didn’t. This was proof that he didn’t.
! I can’t imagine any of that. I cannot imagine you and Harry fighting – I mean, not the stupid tussling and teasing you always do, but actually
“But now, we have men leading us who are of sound mind. And for you, my friend, that is worse. They’ve been patient these last few years, making plans. You’re fucked, Malfoy. You and your Reform Party. Utterly fucked.”
“I keep thinking about how you looked when you came with my cock inside of you. You looked so fucking good, Harry. I can’t even tell you.”
Just the thought of that, of Potter watching Draco get off, was enough to make some of his blood rush back to his cock.
“I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us”
An old house elf popped into the foyer, twisting her hands around a handkerchief, her big eyes worried. “Greetings, Mistress Astoria. And, oh! Mister Harry Potter! Welcome to Greenbrush Manor! Pipsy is being pleased to be at your service. Such an honor to have you here, Mister Harry Potter.” She turned back to Astoria. “Master Blaise is with Mistress Daphne in the library. They is…they is indisposed at the moment.”
Draco growled in frustration. “Oh for Merlin’s sake! Why don’t you just say what you mean, Potter? That you wish
There was no answer, which likely meant Draco had to walk over to the floo, and that was even more annoying.
“Ron!” he called. “Mate!” but his voice was lost in the crowd. Ron was staring at the stage, looking as flabbergasted as Harry felt. Dean and Seamus weren’t around from the looks of it.
And he’d worked himself up into some sort of fury with her. For existing, she supposed. For interfering with his torrid love affair. And for ‘tricking’ him into marrying her.
Harry rolled off of Draco and they looked at one another, and Harry murmured a cleaning spell to rid them of all the spunk they’d spilled, and then Draco was touching Harry’s face and kissing him gently. “I meant it. I
He slipped his shirt off his shoulders and began to unbuckle his belt, smiling to himself when he heard Potter inhale rather sharply. He didn’t stop until he was down to his pants, and then he turned and saw that Potter was standing motionless, staring resolutely at the wall, his lips pressed so tightly together that they were turning white, his cheeks a startling pink. “You going to sleep in your robes, then?” Draco asked.
There were a few gasps, most notably coming from Lucius and Narcissa and Lily and James, but plenty of the ancestors in old-timey garb were grinning and clapping and shaking one another’s hands. Harry looked over at Draco. “This should be interesting,” he murmured.
“He has very nice clothes,” Draco said forlornly. “And an impressive job. He even impressed my mother.”
When Ginny said she wanted to divorce, Harry had been devastated, but also unsurprised. He knew she wasn’t happy, and he knew that he wasn’t able to
Ginny glanced around, frowning. The Common Room was crowded. “We could go to the Room of Requirement, if you want.”
“Draco, come. Walk with me,” said Lord Voldemort, turning towards the front hall. Bellatrix hurried ahead of him to open the door, bowing and scraping as he passed.
“Did you listen to the Falcons game yesterday?” you ask him in the kitchen of the house Pansy shares with Blaise and Daphne.  Pansy is your friend now, and she’s his best friend, but he still hates you. You’ve been trying to think of something to say to him for the last half hour, and now here you are, alone with him in the kitchen, and this is the best you’ve managed to come up with.
“We fucked around,” said Harry flatly. “Not sex or anything. Just…got off, or whatever, and then passed out. And now, this morning, he’s…he’s just gone. I can’t find him anywhere. I looked every place I could think of, Draco. I don’t know where the hell he might be.”
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, all the flecks of color – the moss, the emerald, the almost-gold – shining in the soft light. “I’m sorry.”
“Oh,” Draco said again. His insides were roiling and his heart was pounding. How could this be? How? It seemed impossible. If anyone else had told him, Draco would never have believed it. Never. But it was from Potter’s mouth, so it was true.
“I, um," Draco said. "I’ll do whatever you want. I completely understand if you want to go home. You didn’t sign up for this.”
Draco sighed and sat up, rubbing his hands over his face. “Probably should’ve talked about this before I got so comfortable. And before I had four whiskeys.”
Draco followed her back down to the Common Room, where she was all set up at a little table, texts and papers spread out everywhere. Her parchment looked basically done; he wondered what she was worried about. He scanned over what she’d written. “You’re offering explanations to why all these attempts at developing an alkahest failed,” he murmured. It was quite advanced work; Draco couldn’t help but be impressed.
"I – um. Well. I think they might all suspect anyway, so. Sure, why not?” Draco said, looking rather overwhelmed. “Anything else, then, Harry? You want to run away and get married tonight?”
And soon, it was Gimheif, the Marchmen’s holiday. Draco noticed that none of the Marchmen were drilling out on the practice fields that morning, and Clover explained that they were taking part in a ritual out in the marshes, and no, she had no idea what they were doing, because it was secret and sacred, and yes, she’d definitely asked Frankie, because if anyone was going to blab about the specifics, it would’ve been her.
Lia snorted, and Frankie jumped over towards the bed and gave him a kiss on his cheek. “See you soon,” she said. “When you get your lazy butt out of that bed.” He swatted at her, and she ran out of the room, giggling.
Harry leapt up, trying to yank his trousers up at the same time and stumbling on his way over to Draco. “Would you hang on?” he cried.
“Smart girl,” said Pansy approvingly. “I’ve never been able to give them up myself, but that’s a tragic character flaw of mine.”
After paying the (hefty, for lunch) bill, Draco steered them both out into the street and towards the townhouse. He walked a step or two behind Harry and his mother, letting them talk, and nearly melting when Harry offered her his hand to help her over a steep curb.
Finally, it was the first of September. The weather was lovely, with just a hint of chill in the air as his mother and father walked with him along the platform at King’s Cross Station. His mother disappeared through the wall after his father, and neither one looked back to see if Draco was following. He remembered, suddenly, that he’d had a flash of apprehension the first time this happened, a moment of wondering whether the wall would admit him, too. Doing new things always unsettled him. It had taken him a minute to gather his nerve that first time, and his father had been waiting, displeased by his hesitation, on the other side.
Harry Potter’s green eyes were narrowed behind his stupid glasses. When Draco met his gaze, he hissed, “Malfoy,” like the very mention of Draco’s name made bile rise in his throat.
decided to try and forgive you. Only…I’m not yet certain how to do it. It’s been more difficult than I expected.”
She picked up two of the pints and sighed. “I hope you do, sooner rather than later. Too many people would miss you if you were gone for too long.”
Now Potter was coming in for the kill. He put a hand on the man’s waist and leaned forward to speak close to his ear. Draco could almost feel it, the soft brush of lips, the tickle of breath. He shivered.
“Gin used to always go on about your eyes, you know,” Ron said quietly. “Back when she was obsessed with you. I used to yell at her to shut up about it, because, you know, weird. I didn’t need to hear that.”
Malfoy sighed, running a hand through his hair. He looked more rumpled than usual, which was to say, hardly rumpled at all, but still. He also looked exhausted, and had circles underneath his gray eyes. “Not tired. Won’t be able to nap. Can’t ever nap, really. Not a napper.”
She poked her nose at Draco again, and he looked at her, into her big, heavily-lashed eyes, and saw a brightness there, a rainbow of magic. He touched her nose, softly. “Show them who you are, then,” he whispered. “If you’re going to do it, do it now.”
But when he cast, the Door appeared, just as it had before, and when he opened it, they both stood facing the meadow. Most of the flowers were gone, but there were apple trees heavy with fruit. Just like in his dream.
“No,” said Draco, and it hadn’t. There was no room for anything in his heart but Harry; it was a silly question. “I’m happy. I wouldn’t want anything to be different.”
“You just have to believe me when I tell you that I love you. Because I do. And I’m…” he cleared his throat and looked like he was bracing himself for something. “I’m going to leave her. If we don’t win, I’ll leave her after the election. If we win, I’ll leave her after our first term and I won’t seek re-election.”
“But you love Malfoy. You’re good at loving him, and he loves you back. And you love Scorpius, and Scorpius also loves you. And probably other people, too. Your other friends.”
,” said Harry. “Pretty sure he’s one-hundred percent straight. His girlfriend is my other best friend.” But maybe-Tessa was dragging him over by Ron, and putting Harry in a maybe-Tessa/Ron sandwich, and putting Ron’s hands on Harry’s hips. Behind him, Ron was laughing, tickling Harry’s neck with it, and Harry felt so uncomfortable he wanted to die. He stared studiously up at the stage where a very handsome man with tawny skin was twerking, but, not surprisingly, that didn’t help matters any.
All the men had hands on their pommels, were poised to draw their swords. Draco was too busy gathering Sen to draw his weapon.
“Here,” Harry said, pushing him gently towards one of the bottom bunks. Draco felt his legs hit the edge, and Harry put a hand over the back of his head as he lowered him onto the bed, so that he wouldn’t bang it on the top bunk. Just that little gesture had Draco spinning.
Draco woke up with a pounding headache in the blue dress, on a bed underneath a canopy hung with tie-dyed curtains. Luna's house, he realized. Potter was next to him, and had an arm slung over Draco’s chest. He was snoring loudly and his skin was hot and a bit sweaty. Draco moved his head so it was resting against Potter’s soft hair and went back to sleep.
“No, it’s not. I have no problem with that, obviously. Charlie’s bisexual; you know I’ve never judged him for that. I was just…surprised. I wondered why you came to that conclusion. Did you mess around with Malfoy or something?”
“Oh, aren’t you adorable! Where are you from, London?” She had a very pronounced accent and her rhythm of speech could best be described as rapid gunfire.
“—not a fucking homewrecker,” it said. And Harry knew that incensed, posh voice immediately. It was Malfoy.
Draco looked at her, at her big, serious, dark eyes aimed up at the pretend stars. “Me too,” he said.
He very nearly texted Harry to say never mind, he couldn’t get away after all. He typed in the message, his finger hovering over the send button. But in the end, he deleted it. Because he was weak. And horrible.
“I’m not saying I need to actually figure it out! I only want to include some hypothetical solutions here at the end.”
He pulled away, looking into a pair of eyes that were brown and not green. But even if they had been green, they still wouldn’t be the eyes Draco wanted to see. And this wasn’t the chest he wanted to press himself against. And those weren’t the hands he wanted tracing lines along his bare skin.
“Because the leaders of the Etherean Council believe the Ethereans should stay out of our wars. They encourage isolation in the mountains. I suppose it makes sense if you consider all the wrong that has been done to them. I don’t really blame them for wanting nothing to do with us.”
pity you? You were handed a bad deal and you’ve managed. You’ve kept yourself alive and you’ve even thrived. I bet you none of the rest of them could’ve done it.”
Well, there was nothing for it now. Charlie was going to meet them there at six, and Draco couldn’t very well call off their date at four without seeming very rude.
“You are so dense, sometimes, Ron,” Hermione said, gritting her teeth. She looked angry as Draco’d ever seen her, and she seemed utterly like herself. She didn’t seem Polyjuiced and the memory felt clean and whole, which made Draco think it hadn’t been altered. “Harry’s in love with him. You’d have to be blind not to know it.”
Charlie laughed, and then leaned over and kissed Draco’s cheek. “Well, you let me know if you ever get over this Potter thing, alright? And until then, I’m looking forward to continuing to beat your arse in Quidditch.”
The pieces were all starting to come together to make an awful, awful picture. “Draco, that’s…that’s not okay. It’s illegal, for one thing, and also just…what the
“Well done, Harry and Draco. Well done. Inter-house unity at it’s finest,” boomed Blaise’s deep, amused voice. Everyone laughed, and Harry returned to the couch, feeling slightly unsteady.
my business, Draco,” she said, giving him a dangerous smile. “You’d better not be keeping anything from me.”
He decided to make chicken marsala with trofie instead of spaghetti. He thought the denser pasta held up better than thin noodles against the rich sauce and chicken. He made roasted vegetables on the side, and threw together a little salad. “Oh, Harry, it smells delicious,” Hermione said when she came downstairs after getting dressed.
The kiss was just as tingly and heart-stoppingly lovely as the first two were, although it was tempered by the fact that all their classmates were watching and Harry was totally sober. Malfoy tasted incredible, and Harry marveled at the fact that, at this point, it felt almost comfortable, kissing him. It was the third time, after all. Although…he was counting the last instance as one occurrence, but they’d kissed like mad. If you counted all those as separate kisses, he had no idea how many it would be. A hundred, maybe.
One Friday, he demanded that they skip pub night and stay home. He cooked Harry his favorite pasta, rigatoni alla carbonara, and bought a nice bottle of Brunello. Then over dinner he informed Harry that they were going to a Mind Healer for couples counseling the following Wednesday.
“No, nothing like that. ‘m not fucken’ embarrassed. Jus’ not, like, serious enough to tell everybody.”
Before Michigan, it had been a ranch in Wyoming. Linda did not like cows or horses or, frankly, the state of Wyoming, so why this was a good idea had been a mystery to her. She left the ranch after she’d nearly stepped on a rattlesnake.
“Still have my knees, dummy,” Draco said, aiming for Potter’s bollocks. And then somehow, Potter had him pressed up against a wall, his thighs against Draco’s thighs, and Draco found he couldn’t move at all, much less knee anybody in the bollocks.
He walked for hours, taking off his jacket and his tie, rolling up his sleeves, the sun warm and gentle on his skin, the breeze tugging softly at his hair.
taken. The Weaslette wouldn’t like you flirting with Felix, now, would she? Maybe I was looking out for
Draco very resolutely refused to think of the night he’d watched Harry wanking, and had behaved with an extraordinary amount of inappropriateness. “Thank you,” he said, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. “I’d appreciate it.”
, and he was fairly well convinced that life with Harry was vastly preferable to life without him. Draco had said he’d take anything Harry was willing to give him, and that was true, wasn’t it?
“Erm, my job isn’t all that demanding. And cooking’s a lot easier with magic. Doesn’t take nearly as long.”
Harry could hardly stand to look Draco in the eye as he was saying all of those things, but he was left feeling warm and oddly hopeful. “Tosser,” he muttered.
be angry. How could he not be? Unless he was still flat and tired like he’d been most of their conversation. Harry hoped he wasn’t feeling like that right now. He hadn’t enjoyed seeing Draco like that, not at all.
Potter blinked his eyes open, and, after a moment, they cleared, and he smiled. It was crooked and lovely, and Draco hated the way it made something in him twist and grow warm. “If I were to say that I liked you," Draco began, "
“I think I wore that to Harry’s debate, didn’t I? Fuck’s sake, I can’t wait until their campaign is over. I’m sick of going to all this shit,” Sarah groused. “Dressing up sucks.”
“He did this to himself. He dug a hole so deep that no one could drag him out of it. Not you, not Potter, not Merlin himself.”
“Well, look, so what if he tried to make me jealous? I hurt him. He’s trying to make me realize that he can find someone who’ll take him seriously if I don’t.”
“Go,” Harry said again. “Go play the part of the dutiful husband. Go give her a kiss and ask her about her day while your arsehole is aching and my come is leaking out of you. Go sit around with her in your perfect house and try to muster up some interest in her cunt, you
“That’s not what I’m saying, you arse. I’m saying I felt…I dunno. I wondered about it. What it would be like, if you, um. If you thought about me like that. Not that I thought you did, I’m not saying that. But I wondered if you
Harry’s heart felt like it was about to burst right out of his chest, and the world felt suspended in motion, everything narrowing to that little corner of the dance floor as his lips met Draco’s, tentative and careful.
“Oh, boo. How did you know it was me?” she asked. She had on a very short, light blue dress with a slutty schoolgirl vibe that strangely worked for her.
His breath caught. “What is this?” he whispered, stepping back, stepping far away. “Why are you showing me this?”
Then Harry was turning to face him. His glasses were on the coffee table, so he was blinking a lot, like he always did without them, a quirk that Draco found weirdly sweet. “I was so scared,” he said.
Astoria had debated what to wear for a long time. She’d called Daph over to help her decide, but in the end, she’d settled on an emerald green and white and royal blue floral-patterned, strapless dress. The bodice fit her slim frame snugly, the skirt was floaty and romantic. Her hair was up in a softly woven knot at the crown of her head, and big, sparkling emeralds hung from her ears. Her shoes were royal blue, heels spelled so that they wouldn’t sink into the dirt.
They rarely spent a weekend apart after that, and their lives slowly became intertwined. When he opened up the studio, Sarah was his first hire. She liked helping him keep his life organized, managing his finances and his schedule. Lord knew he needed it (desperately), and she liked how it made her feel, like she was helping someone she cared about, like she was doing a bit of mothering. She liked mothering. She liked taking care of people. Especially people she loved, and she loved Harry. The fact that he paid her well was just an added bonus.
Berold walked away then, with Frankie and Laurel right behind him. Draco turned to Lia. “Well, that didn’t go exactly to plan,” he said.
Then, in the early spring, Sunny arrived. She was a big, bright orange mama cat with three little orange kittens that Harry named Morning and Glory and Dawn. They were the most independent of the bunch, living mostly in the shed, where Harry supplied them with a little cathouse and clean blankets and cat food. But they, too, came in whenever they felt like it; it just wasn’t very often.
Laurel moved her hand gently across his palm, and Draco watched as his callouses disappeared one by one, leaving a tingling sensation in their wake. "I'd heal the rest," she said, "but you'll want those callouses in the long run. You need to toughen up your hands."
“I love you, too,” Draco said, kissing the tip of Harry’s nose. He pushed back Harry’s fringe and kissed his forehead. “I never thought anything like this would happen. I never even imagined it. It would’ve seemed so unrealistic…foolish. I never allowed myself to think of it. Sex, sure, but not this.”
“Are we reliving memories of Hogwarts, then?” Harry said, his eyes capturing Draco’s once again. “You and I have some good ones, don’t we, Malfoy?”
He chugged down the rest of his drink and set it on the closest table and made his way around the space, looking for a white shirt and white-blonde hair. Draco didn’t seem to be
“That’s just what I was thinking,” said Malfoy, gesturing to his swim trunks. Scorpius was in swim trunks, too, his with a little pattern of sailboats on them. “Come on. I did something fun.”
The unicorn stepped closer, swaying slightly, and then turned, as if it heard something in the distance, and bolted. It ran like a dream, graceful as a gazelle, despite its size, and he thought he'd never seen anything so beautiful.
She was quite tall and had hair black as midnight and walnut-colored skin. She moved elegantly, poised, her neck long and straight, her dark hair captured in an immaculate bun, and she wore a black leotard and tights and a short, sheer-ish pink skirt tied at her waist. “Are you a friend of Draco’s?” she asked.
Draco went to the nearby lobster pound to pick up the lobster that Harry’d ordered, and then to the only grocery store in Lubec to get ears of corn and things for a salad. They were going to have an old fashioned lobster boil out on their little sand beach, where they’d set up a table and some chairs and strung up some lights.
“You know, back in school…” Pansy trailed off, frowning. “Daphne and Theo were friends in school, weren’t they?”
Then, in August, Ron sent him an owl detailing news of all their mutual friends and mentioned that Draco was seeing someone – a muggle. Ron said everyone liked him. All Harry knew about him was that he was nice and his name was Finn, but he hated him anyway. He attempted to snuff out his rekindled hope, because what was the point? It was obviously never going to happen between them, and so Harry tried to make peace with that.
Draco ran to his side and collapsed beside him. “Thank Merlin you’re okay,” he said, touching him. Touching him, patting at him, feeling wonderfully solid flesh underneath his hands. “You’re okay? Everything’s in one piece?”
He apparated to the front of the Burrow and knocked. Molly answered the door, looking positively shocked to see him. He hadn’t seen much of her since the breakup with Ginny. “Harry!” she cried, sweeping him into a tight hug. “Oh my dear, it’s so lovely to see you! How are you?”
When he came in from his run, he started the stove to warm up a pan drizzled with oil, intending to make a quick dinner of beef stir-fry, when he heard a tapping at his window.
Talk something over? On a Friday night at - he looked at his watch - eleven? This was a fucking booty call.
He had a text from Kayli. Kayli, who’d told him she had a boyfriend, a serious one. Kayli, who had been wearing a zebra-print sports bra today.
She catapulted through the Door, and Ilana was staring at her, confused, until she noticed what Draco was clutching. “My saddle!” she shrieked, as he was tumbling through the Door after Lia.
“Nothing,” said Draco, frowning. “It shows that there was magic here, and that it was the sort of magic that responds to a runic diagnostic, but it gives no information about the caster or the spell. Which can only mean…” He pressed his thumb and forefinger to his temples, thinking. “It didn’t come from here. Whatever’s on the other side of these doors, or, rather,
“If the Goddess gave the Ethereans the power to visit the other worlds, then I think she intended us to use our power to make them better. Otherwise, why give us the ability in the first place, when we might just as well commune with her in Etherea? I think we’re meant work in the worlds we encounter, not merely exist at their peripheries. Honestly, I think refusing to engage is cowardice. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you, but that's what I think. There’s an entire war going on under your noses, and it’s hurting other Ethereans – the ones who stayed behind – and it’s hurting other people, too. And you could help, and you won’t.”
He loved seeing them all smiling and relaxed on the beach during the day, lounging and getting tan lines, laughing and running at the waves. He loved that they all staggered home together in the wee hours of the morning, rowdy and stupid and spinning. They had needed this, and he was so happy Pansy had suggested going to Florida, because between the sun and the mojitos and the dancing, it was just the thing for a group of fucked up, war-ravaged eighteen-year-olds (whose passports said they were twenty-one). It was perfect. Almost perfect. Almost, because Draco wasn’t there.
“I was in love with you, once,” Draco said, a bit haltingly.  He felt horribly exposed. “I don’t know if I ever really stopped feeling that way. I think I might be in love with you again. Or still. Or – I don’t fucking know. I just know it’s only ever been you, for me, Harry. You’re the only person I’ve ever felt like this about. And it’s selfish and shitty to want to keep you, I know it is, but I guess I’m selfish and shitty, because I really,
“You can use mine,” he said, softly, realizing, suddenly, how obvious it was that she should. “It’s more powerful. You could go way back, to the beginning of Hogwarts, like I did, and make different choices. End up in Gryffindor with Ron, and then you won’t get hurt.”
Harry took his hand and led him up the stairs. He paused on the second floor, his eyes flitting to the blue room. Draco’s room. He felt a sudden tightness in his chest at the sight of it, a flicker of a memory lighting up in his head: Draco in a paint-splattered t-shirt, a bottle of firewhiskey gripped in his fist, a bit of blue paint on his cheek.
Draco’s eyes fluttered closed and Harry felt him roll his hips towards Harry’s, felt Draco’s cock press against his own, both of them heavy and thickened with desire. Holy shit. “Or you could show me,” Draco whispered.
Everything in the pub felt like it slowed as he looked over at Potter. “Uh,” he said. Very smooth. Very charming.
“No!” exclaimed Harry. “I fucking hate that guy. Oh my god, Ron. I want to kill him. Like, literally kill him.”
Harry went home not exactly sure how he’d acquired a vacation home at the very eastern edge of the United States, but feeling grateful for it anyway.
Draco was shocked by the tenderness in his father’s voice. But he only nodded and got to his feet, steadying himself as best he could.
They were dancing close to some speakers, and it would be almost impossible to have a conversation here. “Can we go somewhere a little quieter?” Draco yelled, his face close to the man’s ear. The guy smelled a little sweaty, but that was probably par for the course here on the hot dancefloor. And his hair smelled nice, at least.
Harry found that his eyes were blurry by the time he got to the end of the letter. He and Charlie did say ‘I love you’, but they didn’t spend a whole lot of time talking over their relationship otherwise. They both had a tendency to ‘do’ rather than talk. Charlie had never said any of this to him, and it made something inside him ache, to see Charlie’s feelings for him spelled out in this way. Charlie was incredible. He was like no other person Harry’d ever met. Who but him would even do this? Would ever be willing to consider it, much less orchestrate it?
“It’s just wandless magic,” Potter said. He frowned. “I was getting rather good at that before we came here.”
He tilted his head and looked at her. “Didn’t you? I did. Well, at first, I thought he might want nothing to do with me. But once I saw he did, I knew exactly how it would go.”
Draco remembered himself after a bit and decided he would be the one to pull away this time. He managed it, though part of him wanted to stay wrapped in Charlie Weasley’s arms for much longer. “Thanks again, Charlie,” he said.
Finally, after days on the road, they reached the river that ran past the edge of the marsh. There was a certain rocky, shallow stretch where they always crossed, so they made their way there and led their horses through. Then they walked with their horses in tow through the marsh, careful to steer clear of the gators. Draco had a scarf of sorts that he wrapped around his head to deter the shriek flies, and soon they were through the marsh and winding their way up the hill.
When Pansy began draping herself all over Granger, Draco decided they’d all done enough pre-partying and it was time to go. They went through the floo to Luna’s. She still lived in her childhood home, but since her father had died not long after the war, the place now belonged entirely to Luna, and looked it. Draco’d seen it as a child, and remembered it being a little foreboding, but now it was painted purple instead of black on the outside, and inside was a riot of color and clutter. And Luna’s backyard was magical, literally and figuratively, with fairy lights everywhere and colorful flowers (many of them night-bloomers) and winding paths that slipped through a maze of trees and hedges, with small conversation nooks scattered about. It was full of little, benign magical creatures, and tonight, it had been spelled to stay warm and cozy, despite the chill in the air.
“Potter, for shame! This is obviously what’s wrong with you, not getting shagged after committing so many good deeds. The whole universe is unbalanced now, and we’ve got to fix it. Who do you fancy?”
Hermione shrugged. “I don’t know about forgetting. It just seems…whatever he did, however horrible he was, it seems like he’s paid for it. He lost his parents, his money, his home. He lost his only friend. I have a hard time hating him at this point. I feel sorry for him, honestly.”
He shook his head. “No, I think I want her back. Sleeping with other people isn’t the best way to make that happen, obviously. I fucked up, didn’t I?”
As they talked, several things became clear. First of all, they weren’t going to easily find anyone to help them create a Sacred Door to return them to the real world. According to William, there was only one man who had that ability. His name was Kerrick, and he was one of the Etherean leaders who lived (of course) in the mountains near the Hidden City, whatever-the-hell that was.
“Do,” Harry said, leaning in to kiss him. But their helmets knocked together instead. “Ow.” Harry turned his head sideways, and managed to sneak in a little one.
“Oh, yeah, I guess that doesn’t work with siblings. Fuck you, then. Oh, hey, how’s that girl you went out with last week – Casey?”
Generally, Draco made a point of not sleeping with the staff here, since he wanted to keep coming back. He’d made that mistake early on with one of the managers, a man named Carlos, and it had been awkward afterwards, and he’d ended up staying away for a month or two. But after seeing Potter crawling all over that blonde, Draco really,
This felt quite different than either one of those things. It was shivery-cold and heavy, like it was damp, perhaps, and it had an odd smell to it, almost like the tang of iron. It was like nothing he’d ever sensed before, not really. The closest thing he could recall was one of his least favorite parts of the Department of Mysteries, the Death Chamber, with its Veil that never failed to make Draco break out in gooseflesh. “Do you feel it?” he asked, drawing out his wand.
There, tucked away at the bottom, was a box he hadn’t let himself open in years. Now, though, it seemed like it wouldn’t hurt as much, since Draco was back in his life.
so good, that perhaps the universe was stepping in to show Draco that he didn’t deserve him. That he would never deserve him.
There was no way that Draco was going to get on one of those death-trap aeroplanes by himself. No way in hell. The prospect of doing that with all his classmates was terrifying enough. He certainly wasn’t going
Draco waited another minute or two before stepping towards the front, watching Harry turn to Pansy and say something quietly, smiling. Draco felt like he was holding his breath, like everything, like the rest of his life, was waiting there in front of him. Just before the lights dimmed the rest of the way, he slid into the empty seat.
Draco, of course, noticed, and flicked his wand at one clock and then another, until the face of every clock in the rental house was obscured.
(although Draco had, admittedly, snogged the intern later that night under the same mistletoe just to even things out).
All those times he’d scolded Harry, and now he’d gone and done the exact same thing, only it was going to kill him.
Draco moved around Harry, stopping when he was directly behind him, and put his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “And what would you have done? Stop stroking yourself. You’re not going to come yet.”
“Because my father said it would make a stronger case, if I seemed very hurt. That’s why he brought in that private healer, to corroborate the story and put this thing on me.”
“So fucking hot,” Potter said, and then his mouth was on Draco’s and he was kissing him messily, wetly, and Draco was reeling because he was
But for some reason, the morning’s developments didn’t feel like returning to the status quo. It felt like something had been lost, some essential part of himself. “Fuck,” Draco mumbled as he slid to the floor, resting his head on his knees. “Fuck.”
“I heard Malfoy – er, Scorpius’s dad – isn’t here, but is his mum? I’d be happy to tell her what happened.”
. Decide that you were someone worthy of their lust. Decide that they wanted you enough to offer themselves to you. It was such a high, and really, that was probably why Harry chased after it so much. That was why he craved that initial heady moment when the vague interest in someone’s eyes shifted slightly, and he could tell that they
At Glum’s Marsh, Edwin had been big and solid and strong. Not bulky, like Pike, but formidable. He’d lost weight since then – a considerable amount of it – and his coloring was terrible. He looked grayish. Sickly. His clothes were in tatters, and his face was streaked with grime. He had his head leaned back against the stone wall opposite the bars of the cell, his eyes closed. “Edwin,” Draco said softly.
beverages available in Hermione’s and Pansy’s room for those who’re interested.” There were some cheers and whistles at this. Harry had been utterly shocked when Hermione informed him that she and Pansy were going to be responsible for procuring whiskey and wine.
“If you don’t mind me asking, what exactly happened? I mean, I know what happened the night you and Euri broke up, but then…did you get back together, briefly, or something? Because it seemed like you were even more upset a week later.”
it,” Draco said. “I love that you’re a romantic who says sweet and lovely things to me all the time. I just never would have guessed it. But then, I didn’t peg you as the kinky sort either.” He grabbed for Harry’s hand and squeezed. “You’re just full of surprises.”
He was working through the process of unfreezing Draco’s assets. The Auror Department, which was the entity actually holding the assets, had to petition the Wizengamot to get it done. But before he took that step, Harry was trying to work through back channels to convince the members of the Wizengamot. He didn’t usually work this way, but Hermione said it was the way things were done sometimes.
“I don’t want you to think I’m sorry it happened. Or that it didn’t mean anything. I feel a bit guilty, only because of Pansy, but I’m not sorry it happened. And it did mean something, to me anyway. It meant quite a lot, actually.”
She searched his face. “You must have a different philosophy of magic. You don’t know the Pillars and you use sticks to summon Sen.”
Potter’s agitated demeanor suddenly melted into something else, his eyes becoming shiny, his face falling. Sweet Merlin, if Potter cried Draco didn’t know what he was going to do. “Weird as in Ginny walked in on me,” he said quietly. “While I was with the girl. And instead of being mortified and begging for forgiveness, I told her to watch and try to pick up a few pointers. And I laughed at her.” He laughed then, slightly hysterically. “I can’t believe I just told you that. Jesus fucking Christ.” He put his head in his hands and another burst of laughter that sounded a little too close to a sob came out from behind them.
Unlike all the House dormitories, the Eighth-Year girls’ rooms were not inaccessible to boys. Harry wondered about that, because he knew McGonagall had re-set all the wards after the war, and had probably set wards up in the Eighth-Year rooms, too.
She smiled. “It’s something he made for us. A scrapbook of all his shitty ideas.” Her breath caught, and she made a noise somewhere between a sob and a laugh.
Theo laughed. “It’s one thing to have youthful experimentations. You’ve ruined your whole life chasing after Harry Potter’s dick. You’re pathetic.”
“What happened? Was it a dream?” Harry asked, his eyes locked onto Draco’s. “Lumos,” he said, and his wand lit up the little world within Draco’s curtains.
Hours later, the sun was setting, and nothing had happened. The saddle was sitting in the same spot, and Draco and Lia were sprawled out on the beach next to it. “We may want to move into the trees. We’ll be able to resist the Sirens since we didn’t drink the water, but they still might come after us.”
But Harry was alive here, in his own timeline. Harry was alive and well and whole, and while he didn’t love Draco, maybe that was alright.
Draco’s brain was so fried that it took a moment to place the name. “Shit,” he said quietly to himself. He didn’t want to be here all night with this guy. He was so tired and he was fucking hungry, and all he wanted to do was get some food in his belly and collapse into bed. “Give me a sec,” he said, stepping into his office and putting his jacket over the chair and ripping off his tie and pouring himself a glass of whiskey.
Harry picked him up and carried him upstairs and tossed him on the bed, and he knew Draco found that very hot, because he immediately launched himself at Harry, licking into his mouth and yanking at his pants.
William led them in the direction of one of the smaller rooms behind the dais, with a big, square table at its center, which was frequently used for formal discussions. Draco and Kerrick and Berold followed, along with William’s guards.
, if you act like you’re moving on just fine, and if she sees that plenty of other people want a piece of you now that she’s out of the picture, she’ll rethink her decision. She’ll panic and realize that you’re going to slip through her fingers if she doesn’t get you back in a hurry. Trust me on this. People want what they can’t have, and they also want what other people want. Show her you’re wanted and that you’re not a sure thing anymore, and she’ll come running.”
Potter looked taken aback. “What? No, I don’t –” He finally put down his wand, letting it hang limp by his side. “Of course not.”
“I don’t know what I’m trying to say, other than I’m sorry for what I did. I wish to god that I hadn’t, for so many reasons, including the fact that if I hadn’t, it wouldn’t feel like this.” He cleared his throat. “With you. You wouldn’t have to deal with the reality that the man you were…
’s type. He was gorgeous and sweet and would get absolutely fucking wrecked by Malfoy if Malfoy chose to fuck with him. They were hardly the same species. Malfoy was like a lion, all teeth and claws and fury, and poor Euri was like an innocent little gazelle.
“No, let me finish,” Harry said vehemently. “I have to say this now before everything gets more complicated.” He cleared his throat. “So. If I kind of…seem distant, for a while, it’s just because I need a little bit of time. It’s not because you’re not still my friend, or important to me. And if you’re having a rough time again, like before, I’ll always talk to you about it. No matter what. You can talk to me. Okay?”
Draco stepped before the mirror, hating the way his palms were sweating. He was such a coward, really. Scared of so much. He was a grown man in a boy’s body (although, to be honest, he felt less and less like a grown man lately. His thoughts and feelings seemed to be regressing back to childhood ones), and he was more afraid than the actual eleven-year-old by his side. He forced himself to look, to keep his spine straight.
“I doubt he’s interested in going out to dinner with a Malfoy. I don’t have the best reputation among Weasleys, as you may know.”
than a note from Malfoy, because this was somebody who was interested in dating Harry, somebody very attractive and nice and not an arsehole, and Malfoy was, as ever, a git.
He pulled into Bath at eleven and parked along the street near the river. He went to the dead-ending alleyway and walked through the wall, coming through to the French restaurant. He waved to the hostess, but walked past her to the front door, exiting onto Cucumber Lane.
He rummaged through the pantry until he found a box of dried spaghetti and a can of sauce. In the refrigerator there was a pound of ground beef with a stasis charm on it, which Draco could certainly use to make meatballs. He wasn’t a great cook – he was borderline competent – but he had lived alone without a house elf for a few years after the war and had learned to make a handful of things out of necessity.
Draco himself almost didn’t want to risk it. But he desperately needed to feel something inside of him, needed more than just a simple wank, and this was the only time of day he could possibly manage it. He walked past the Potions classroom on his way out, just to check and see if Potter was there. He was.
“Er, nice work,” said Harry, certain his face was as red as one of the tomatoes they’d eaten at lunch.
“What the – no! I’m not trying to get you to sleep with me, Malfoy. I honestly just wanted to talk to you. They said you didn’t get off until two-thirty, and I didn’t want to wait that long.”
, and I don’t fucking know what to do, because I said I would go back to England and run for office with him and –”
“It never felt like this with Euri,” Harry whispered, not meaning to say it out loud and feeling a little bad when he did.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Draco asked, feeling a weird twist of anxiety in his stomach.
Malfoy’s hands were at his back, nails digging into his skin, probably leaving scratches everywhere and oh god it felt so incredible, the tiny flashes of almost-pain mixed with Malfoy’s brutal kisses, his sharp teeth and his hot tongue, his legs like a vise around Harry, trapping him.
“Well, the rest of us thought it was rather amusing,” said Lawrence, giggling. “Anyway, you boys go, have fun. Mix and mingle! You need anything more to drink?”
Pansy tapped her fingers on the table and took a swig of the espresso Draco’d bought her. “What about her?” she said, nonchalantly.
Draco got sick of walking then. He ducked into a dark alley and apparated home. But, standing in his dark and empty entryway, he decided that he didn’t want to be home after all. Home was where his bed was, and his bed was where Potter had been, and he hadn’t even washed the Potter-smell off of his sheets. Before he could even think about what he was doing, Draco stepped over to the fireplace and tossed some Floo Powder into it.  “Ministry of Magic,” he said, stepping into the green flames.
He gathered Sen and cast, and a Door appeared between the karkadan and them. One of the karkadan stepped through the Door from the back side of it, straight through it, ignoring it entirely. It disappeared.
“I’m not going to molest you, for fuck’s sake,” Harry said, echoing his earlier words, and climbed into bed beside him.
Draco nodded. Every place had its own stories, its own struggles. There was Voldemort in his world and Otrea here. There was evil everywhere, and there were people struggling against evil everywhere. “It must be exhausting, to spend your life fighting.”
Malfoy snorted, and looked studiously off to the side for a moment before turning back to them, his mouth only twitching a little. “Well, Lily, if you and Albus do end up returning at some point, I’d be happy to show you all my workroom. Scorpius isn’t allowed inside without me, of course -- some of the ingredients are quite dangerous -- but I do let him watch me work sometimes.”
“Yeah, but the couch is sort of our thing,” said Charlie. “Plus, it’s an excuse to cuddle the shit out of you, since it’s not very big.”
Draco knew exactly what he was saying. Hating Potter used to feel almost comforting. “Yeah,” he said. Now, though, even thinking of that, of how much of his energy used to be wasted on terrorizing Potter, he felt nothing but guilt and shame. It made him feel tired. He reached over and squeezed Potter’s hand. “It’s all gone, now, though. No part of me hates you anymore.”
, his eyes tracking Malfoy across the Quidditch pitch, in the Great Hall, along the corridors of the castle.
Euri was to think about anything else, like the fact that he was a buttoned-up, intellectual Slytherin. Strange, that Harry should meet someone like him right after seeing Malfoy. In a lot of ways, he was, perhaps, what Malfoy might have been had he not been thrown into the middle of the war. Although Euri didn’t seem as prone to biting sarcasm and insults as Malfoy. To be fair, though, they were meeting in very different circumstances. Maybe in the right situation, Euri was capable of being an absolute wanker too.
It was all a bit unsettling, but Hermione was obviously trying to be nice, and Draco didn’t want to discourage her. “Why not throw him in a room with Potter? Surely they’d have more in common.”
“Because he didn’t care about you enough,” she said angrily. “Because he snogged Blaise outside of the Leaky. Because he’s a –”
Potter slung an arm around him. “Wanker,” he said, almost fondly. Draco leaned against him for a moment before remembering himself and pulling away.
“Hello,” Ari said, snaking his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry was at the stove, sautéing shrimp and green beans and mixing a stir-fry sauce. Ari kissed over the side of his neck, and Harry leaned back against him. Ari was hard already. Sometimes it seemed like he was always hard. Ari was a bit of a pervert, and Harry very much liked that about him.
There was a flash of unholy green light and everything glowed for a moment. Draco realized he was shouting, and things were moving in the glow as his eyes tried to adjust to the aftermath.
, Draco,” Harry said. “Whatever you may or may not feel, you’re still married and living together and have a son together. Until that changes, I’m going to keep my options open. I would think you would understand that." He paused for a moment, and then continued on doggedly. "So…is that something you could do? Would you want to see me under those conditions?”
“I can see why you would be confused by that. I’m positive you’ve never considered this before in your life. But believe me when I tell you that your look as of late is ‘depressive alcoholic who’s eaten pizza five nights running and skipped yet another shower this morning’. And that is not a good look on anyone, not even you.”
He cleared his throat, his cheeks coloring a little. “I think that’s why I got so upset with you. Because I knew you wanted to stay, and I didn’t want you to. I wanted you to come home with me. I wanted you to
mentioned in a letter to his mother that Pansy had been spending half her time that year locked up in her room, scribbling away in her notebooks. He hadn’t told his mother exactly what sort of thing Pansy’d been writing. Still, his mother replied, telling him about Theodosia, and indicating that she wrote ‘romance novels, of the explicit variety.’  Draco knew immediately that he had to introduce the two.
“I…” Harry trailed off. “Yeah. I’m willing to see you sometimes. But I won’t agree to be loyal to you when you’re still married. That doesn’t even make sense.”
Hermione grinned uneasily. “Oh, well. Not as such. If you happen to like him, though, that wouldn’t be the worst thing, Harry.”
“It’ll be tough,” said Harry, pressing his forehead to Draco’s. “I love you, by the way. Like…a lot.”
Draco gave a little groan and pulled Harry’s mouth to his, kissing him softly. “Harry,” he said in that voice. The same voice he’d used on the rooftop in Chicago, that made him sound like he couldn’t quite believe his luck.
“It’s not,” Euri said. “It’s rather fantastic.” He eyed Harry. “Perfect for your coloring. And…” he looked at label on the inside of the jacket. “It’s Dolce & Gabbana, Harry!  Sweet Salazar!” He continued fishing through Harry’s disaster of a room and pulled out a pale lavender button-up and then removed his own white pocket square and spelled it to match the shirt. “Just try it on, please?”
Harry nodded, looking away for a moment. When he turned back to Draco, he seemed to have collected himself somewhat. “Where will you stomp?” Harry asked, trying to keep a straight face and failing.
It was hard for Blaise, he knew. Blaise, even more than Draco, cared about what people thought. He cared about living a respectable, pureblood life.
“Wait! Just hold on a minute. Can…can I come to the pub tonight, Draco? Please? Pretty please? I won’t interfere with your date. I’ll even talk to Hermione. And I won’t be mean to her, I promise. Cross my heart. Please?”
He’d spent a week here after his father was attacked in Azkaban. Lucius had never woken up, hadn’t ever recovered. Draco had watched, helpless, as he’d succumbed slowly to his injuries, as whatever was left of his will to live dissolved into nothing. And after, Draco had vowed to become a Healer, so that he never had to feel like that again.
He lost himself in her softness, in the feel of her skin with its faint scent of roses. He lost himself in her mouth, and in her small, delicate hands, and the incredible things she could do with them. He tried his hardest to make her happy, to give her what she wanted from him, and found that he took immense pleasure in that, too, in making her feel good.
, generic choice available. Everyone loves Harry Potter, so why not you, hm? Is that what this is, Draco? Because
She pulled at him, heading towards it, and then let go of his hand so she could slip through the curtains of his bed. He climbed in after her and cast a Muffliato and a privacy charm and then looked at her.
Gibb nodded. “Certainly.” He asked them question after question about Potter’s predicament, taking notes (which Draco appreciated) and constructing a rough timeline of events.
“Aw, if this isn’t the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen in my life,” said Dolohov, as he delivered a hard kick to Draco’s arse that send him flying forward onto his knees.
“Mm. I don’t know. Maybe we’re both lucky,” Draco said, reaching up into Potter’s hair and tugging. “Something in your hair,” he said, even though there hadn’t been. It was just an excuse to touch it, something Draco had always wanted to do.
He took Lia’s little jar and poured a tiny bit of the oil on his hand. It wasn’t sticky or tacky, but very smooth, and there were little rough bits of salt mixed in. He hoped he could use it on his hair, and then did. If it mucked his hair all up (and honestly, how could his hair get worse?), he’d pull it back into a knot and call it a day.
sitting here in a dusty box? It was Malfoy’s wand, hawthorn with a unicorn hair core. Harry knew this wand, and the wand knew him. He’d used it many times. He’d taken it off Malfoy, of course, in the Manor. He’d used it to win the war. And now it was here, rotting away in the Records Department.
Instead, Malfoy let out a little breathy gasp and tilted his head away, exposing more of his neck, his fingers curling into the fabric of Harry’s shirt.
Draco continued to make his rounds until the pub was emptying out. He spotted Harry squeezed into a booth with Ron and Hermione and Sarah and Pansy and felt a quick pang which he pushed resolutely away. He’d done a good job being present this evening instead of just mooning over Harry, and he wasn’t going to mess it all up now.
The door opened behind him. “Draco, you told us to meet you on the seventh floor. Did you change your mind?” It was Vince’s voice.
“Pike,” Draco said, nodding at him and putting his hand over the wound under his ribcage. Thank Merlin it hadn’t punctured anything vital. Or at least, it didn’t appear to have done so.
There was a little hole-in-the-wall he and Harry used to visit sometimes during Shacklebolt’s campaign, a place called The Blind Pig, that might still be open. Probably was, actually; the pub was about a thousand years old, and Draco thought it would likely keep limping along until the end of time. It would be perfect – nostalgic and quiet, relaxed, a place to talk. Just talk. They weren’t going to do anything else, for fuck’s sake. Talking would be enough; talking to Harry would give Draco his fix, allow him to carry on until the following week, when they could do it again.
Still, the feeling of uneasiness had stayed with him all day, through the long hours at work where he tried his damnedest to avoid Ron and Seamus. It was still with him as he cooked supper in Grimmauld Place’s grungy kitchen, took a soak in the mildew-plagued bathroom on the second floor, and as he climbed back into his bed, resisting the urge to bury his head under the blankets again. He’d left the light on that night, as he had every night since. Not a night light, not the light in the hall or the closet, but the bright overhead pendant lights that lit everything up like the sun.
, and how you relate to people. I think…oh, Harry, don’t take this the wrong way, but I think you need to see a mind healer. I think you need to work through some things before you can really move on.”
Draco stumbled towards them, and Dolohov flicked his hand (sans wand) towards one of the doors to open it. That was the other thing about Dolohov: he was powerful. Really good at what he did. Wandless, wordless, it didn’t matter. He was proficient in all of it.
A house elf popped into existence nearby. “Master Draco is wanting Dinky to collect the bags, Sir,” he said, bustling over to grab Harry’s suitcase and Draco’s, too.
A look of intense relief passed over Potter’s face as he waved back, rolling over his toe with the cart in the process. “Bugger,” Draco heard him mutter as he drew closer, limping a little, prompting Draco to shake his head in amazement.
“Either way,” Draco said, feeling a bit sick over what he was about to do. “Just so long as the message gets across.” He saw it in his mind then, how Ernie’s face would crumble after it was all said and done. And instead of making him happy, it made him feel bloody awful.
going to kill him, you idiot!” he cried, and Daphne flinched. “Sorry,” he said. “Sorry. But Salazar’s sake, Daph. You’re supposed to trust me.”
“Yeah. I guess.” He was quiet for a moment, staring at the statue, and then looked back at Draco. “So, Exploding Snap?”
“He said he’d take me on the spot. He said I could join right then and there. He looked me in the eye and said I looked strong, like exactly what they needed,” she said. “I was so excited, and I knew my father wouldn’t allow it, so I just…I ran. I ran off with them. It was stupid, looking back. But I’m still glad I did it.” She sighed. “He brought me to Glum’s Marsh, and I was a Stag. I was the only woman in the company, mind. And the only Ethererean. Many of the men in that company didn’t appreciate that I was there. They refused to work with me, called me names. Edwin stood up to them on my behalf. I...I thought he was my friend, at first. But then we started having disagreements. For starters, he would only teach me the bow. Said a woman shouldn’t be using a broadsword. I was so frustrated, but he swore I could become a great archer. Still, we fought about it, and things with us started to sour. One night after supper, he finally agreed to teach me how to use a sword. He took me to the far field, the one beyond the stables, and we were all alone. He kept…I don’t know. Touching me. More than he needed to be touching me just to work on my form. It made me uncomfortable, and I told him so. And then suddenly, he was kissing me, and pushing me down onto the ground, and…”
“I know,” Draco said, feeling a little drunk and a lot maudlin. “Fucking hell. I probably need to go home.”
Draco looked at Harry wide-eyed. “I didn’t mean that you – Jesus. I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry said, feeling like an arsehole.
After she left, Draco’s father gave him another sip of tea. “You’ll need to force yourself to stand tall. You mustn’t let him see you so weak. Fall apart afterward, if you must.”
friends,” Draco said tightly. “They’re trapped by this just as much as I am. You don’t know, you have no idea –”
“Jesus, a million things.” Harry moved to sit on the coffee table, facing Draco, his legs to the right of Draco’s. He looked into Draco’s eyes, so familiar and yet strange, somehow. “One, I have a good life here. I do what I want, and I don’t owe anyone anything. Two, I feel really behind on the policy issues.”
“I want to know your opinion,” Ari said, looking into Harry’s eyes. He smoothed Harry’s hair away from his face and kissed him once. “Would you like me to stay?”
He felt terribly out of control of this whole situation. His life here was what he’d made it. Unlike his entire childhood, his entire adolescence, which had been dictated to him by others, his life in Chicago was his own. He’d decided to get into fitness, he’d decided to teach, he’d decided to open the studio. And he’d done well. He hadn’t done it out of some heavy sense of responsibility, or because someone told him he had to. He’d done it for no reason other than he’d felt like it.
“Yeah, actually,” said Harry. He’d skipped hangover potion and even water in his quest to find Ron, and he had a banging headache. “Thanks.”
Harry handed over his wand, and Draco lifted careful fingers to his jaw. Harry winced. “Dislocated, I think,” said Draco. He murmured a spell and Harry’s jaw popped back into place.
“Your father’s not here,” said Dolohov. His dark, beady eyes were burning as he looked at Draco. “Now come on, unless you want me to put an Imperius on you.”
That night he couldn’t sleep. He ought to have gone out to a club or another pub, found a cute girl or boy to bring home. He was no good at being alone. When he was alone, he thought, and when he thought, suddenly the air around him seemed heavy and suffocating, and he couldn’t breathe.
“I didn’t finish, Father. It causes hysterical laughter for eighteen minutes and thirty-three seconds.”
Two weeks later, Malfoy was tried and given a year of probation. He was the only Death Eater to receive less than five years in Azkaban. His gaze had gone straight to Harry when the sentence was read, his expression inscrutable.
“No, I know. But I was terrified out of my mind that entire year, you know, because of what I had to do.  And there Harry was, shouting the Dark Lord’s name to anyone who would listen, and he was just so…so
“Not like that. Not at the expense of – you could never have done what I did. But the point is, I know I’m not a good person.” Potter was opening his mouth to speak, but Draco held up a hand. “Let me finish, okay? Or I’ll never say this.” He took a deep breath. “I know fully well that I’m capable of horrible things. But I need you to know that I hate what I did, back then. I didn’t let myself think about it too much before – you know, before we went through the Door. Because thinking about it is really fucking painful. But ever since we got back, it’s all I can think about, because now I know what it’s like to have done the right thing, for once.”
“Uh-huh,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Have fun getting fucked in the loo. Or wherever you two perverts wind up this time.”
Malfoy kissed him again, and worked his way down Harry’s chest, and licked his cock, causing Harry to buck his hips. “I’d take my time,” Malfoy said, licking Harry again, “only I’d have to kill you if you were late getting home, and I’d rather not kill you when I’ve only just had the pleasure of seeing you naked.”
As he ran around the field, his bare feet slapping at the dirt (The soles of his feet were also getting tougher, which was helpful in a practical sense, but also unpleasant. Draco liked having smooth, soft feet, and hands, too, come to think of it. At this point, they were both a lost cause.), he mentally reviewed the Pillars of Sen, which Laurel had been explaining to him over the last few weeks.
After lunch, which was served, quite formally, in the dining room, Harry and Draco were sprawled out on the floor in one of the sitting rooms (not
One problem with all of this (and there were so, so many problems with all of this) was that Draco was fun to be around. Harry’d almost forgotten – well, not forgotten, exactly, but sort of lost sight of it in the midst of all his romantic reminiscences. He’d thought endlessly about their headiest moments in bed together, about some of the intimate conversations they’d had, the things they’d whispered to one another in the dark. But he’d been so busy holding on to
Draco felt like the ground had fallen out from under his feet. He gripped the long table in front of him. “Where have they taken them?” he asked, and his voice sounded far away.
endlessly soft, like a fluffy ball of cotton. Soft skin, soft curves, soft hair, soft eyes. “But it would be difficult to explain why Mummy and Daddy both had boyfriends on the side.”
, and he tolerated, if not downright embraced, Draco’s whims (and there were many - - Draco wanted to do so many things while Harry was here).
“I will. They’re probably fine, you know,” he said with as much confidence as he could muster. “A few hits won’t usually kill a bloke.”
Harry didn’t care that it almost hurt, didn’t care about anything but this lifeline that Malfoy was offering, this link to his humanity, this brilliant reminder that he was more than the thing, that he was capable of more than just violence.
Harry sighed against his chest, and it tickled. Draco wanted to bottle up his soft breath, bottle up this moment, this feeling.
Harry chucked a donut hole at him and then stalked over and sat on his lap, and then Ron gave Harry a horrible wedgie that resulted in a rugburn along the crack of his arse.
“Right, but. I just hope you know that it’s okay. I mean, where I’m concerned. I want to see Ginny happy and you seem to make her happy and so. It’s okay. I won’t spontaneously combust if I see you two together. In fact, I think we ought to, ah. Try to do that sometime. Be around each other. All of us.”
Linda liked to get up early in the mornings to go for a walk. She’d wake up and put on a thick sweater and jeans and a hat with a wide brim and her hiking shoes and go putzing around the peninsula while the sun was just coming up. They had no close neighbors (their property was enormous), so Linda never expected to see anyone. One morning, though, she heard something in the trees behind her. She whirled around, and there, staring at her, was a huge cat.
“I’d never assumed otherwise,” Draco said, putting his free hand on Harry’s waist and adjusting the position of their joint hands. Harry smiled.
“Two, I noticed that in every timeline, people were a little different, but still themselves. There was a continuity there that I didn’t expect.”
. He’s betrothed to my sister. He’ll marry her soon and give her children.  And where will that leave
She tilted her head. He could still remember the way her eyes had assessed him. “And what will you do? Have torrid affairs with a parade of handsome men?”
He pulled Draco into his room and undressed him slowly, kissing him everywhere as he did, and when he pushed into Draco, he let everything he felt pour out of him, let Draco see it in his eyes, feel it in his touch, hear it in his words. “I love you,” he said. “I want this,” he said. “I’ll wait.”
The food, which had seemed so delicious just a minute ago, tasted dry and awful all of a sudden. Harry almost spit it out. It seemed wrong, to feel sorry for Draco Malfoy. Not just because he’d been such an arsehole, but because Harry suspected he’d hate it if he knew anyone felt sorry for him. “I left this morning without saying anything to him. I left before he woke up.”
. The cover of the magazine was a picture of their overlapping profiles, Harry looking in one direction, Draco in the other, with the tagline “The Dream Team: Malfoy and Potter take England by Storm.” It was a fun interview, and the woman who’d conducted it, Myrna Travers, spoke about the “chemistry” that they had, and how wonderful it was that they were friends and not just political allies. It was a very well-received piece and that, coupled with Draco’s first debate with Theo, gave them a boost in the polls.
old, mate. There are plenty of people your age who’re still going out all the time and getting laid. You’ve got to get over this ‘I’m so old’ shite. You act like you’re ninety, for Merlin’s sake. But you’re not. You’re still young, you’re single, and you’ve got a lot of free time. You should be having
“Salazar’s tit, Mandy!” Draco cried. “You’re the new Pomfrey? You ought to be sainted, I swear to Merlin. The things that poor woman put up with, from Potter alone. Think of how many bones she’s had to grow for that git!”
Ari came home after Harry that night. He was busier than ever, advising and strategizing, helping Draco finalize their Year One agenda and filling second-tier positions in their administration. Harry knew that this would keep him occupied until well into next spring, but he still wasn’t sure what would happen after that.
“My friend Draco from home,” said Harry easily, and Draco noted that two cocktails in, he’d gone from being Harry’s work acquaintance (as he’d been introduced to Robbie) to his friend. He wondered what Harry’d call him after a few more drinks.
Potter had not joined Draco and Laurel for lessons, but instead had thrown himself fully into physical training. He would spar with anyone who offered in the evenings, or, if no one offered, he would go for runs in the marsh, all the way down to a river, where he would take a bath. The river was, thankfully, much cleaner than one would expect, and Draco had used it to bathe, too.
Ginny stared at him, her eyes wide. “Oh, Merlin,” Ginny said. “I should’ve known. You two are always together, and then the weekend…Did you cheat on me, Harry? This weekend?”
Ron wrinkled his nose. “Yeah, no. It’s not. I would straight up murder someone to have abs like his. You should see him, ‘Mione.”
Selwyn threw Draco inside his room, which seemed familiar and strange all at once. “We’re not done with you, you know,” he growled from the doorway. “Daddy’s not always going to be there to save your disloyal arse.”
“Mm, true,” said Draco. He paused, looking uncomfortable. “I think…” He trailed off, looking out the window, the sunlight turning his eyes a luminous blue-gray. “Harry, I think she knows. Suspects, anyway. She’s been strange today.”
Harry was terrifying, his green eyes burning bright in his face, his teeth gritted, his entire body radiating violent energy. He flicked his wand at Draco’s restraints, which came undone in an instant, and then tossed Draco his wand and took a swing.
“You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” Harry whispered. “There isn’t anyone else who comes close.”
Draco frowned as he left the coffee shop. Well, it wouldn’t have been a good fit, anyway. The third bloke was supposed to be easy-going and able to take direction, and John wasn’t, and clearly couldn’t.
Draco stared at him for a moment and then bolted upright. He paced back and forth for a minute, running his hands through his hair, and then went and sat down on the coffee table across from Harry. He still looked even more pale than usual, and worried. He seemed to be trying to brace himself for something. “Okay, I’ll just tell you. I’ll just – right. So, you may have noticed there was something between me and Cassius Warrington.”
“You are so tedious, I swear," Draco huffed. "No, it’s not against bank policy. Gringotts only prohibits relationships between employees and their immediate supervisors. Phi might be overseeing a project, but he’s not even technically employed by Gringotts. He’s just contracted out to us for this one thing.”
They made camp one night inside the trunk of a dead tree. It was large enough to accommodate them both as well as a cheerful fire. They spent their days talking mostly about the things they saw, and, increasingly, about what they would do if it turned out there were no other people in this world at all, because it certainly seemed like there might not be. But that night, Potter was in a nosy mood, and was pestering Draco about Astoria again.
Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, and the thing that passed between them was devastating in its intensity. Draco wanted to plead until Harry said yes, to get down on his knees and beg. Yes, it was their best shot at winning. But also, if Harry said no, that was it. Draco knew it in his gut. Harry would be gone from his life for good.
Hermione offered to make supper, or, alternatively, to order out. Harry insisted on cooking, since he was the best of the three of them, and also because if he just sat around until the guests arrived, he’d probably go mad.
Sam glanced over at her and nodded. “Yeah. We could do that. And what about the Greengrasses’ properties? If Daphne’s involved.”
“We don’t know,” explained Malfoy. “That could be something the students could vote on, certainly. We could make it into a contest of sorts, where students could offer up ideas and then everyone could vote on their favorite. Or we could allow the Alumni Association to come up with something, which they might appreciate.”
Ron giggled and poured himself some firewhiskey and chugged it down and handed Harry a glass. Harry, not wanting to be shown up, gulped it down, too. “Want to watch a movie?” Ron asked.
Harry nodded, and Draco’s fingers were running through his hair, and he felt safe, somehow, and like maybe it was true that everything would turn out okay.
Draco closed his eyes and imagined it, and he could almost feel the air around him shifting and changing. He swore he could smell the sea. He opened his eyes and there was a Door in front of him, very much like what he remembered. Runes that were not runes were cut into its surface, deep gouges in the wood, and there was a handle, this one silver instead of gold.
His plan was to ask Draco to marry him after dinner, once the stars were out but before everyone left. He had a bit of a speech planned out, one that Sarah had helped him with. But fuck, he wasn’t sure that he could make it until then. He might die first, right here in the kitchen, from stress.
“It’s difficult to explain, but suffice it to say that Clarke’s Time-Turner is a different beast altogether. You can skim up and down over the years, travel down different timelines and come back. It’s incredible.”
, between him and Harry, and it felt horrible. Maybe he’d tell him in the morning. It was only fair to tell him. He would, he decided, feeling suddenly more relaxed. He would tell him.
“I know you didn’t start it, but maybe you could try to talk to him? It just doesn’t seem right, the two of you fighting, today of all days.”
Charlie and his friends were only too happy to give up an evening on brooms for an evening getting trashed, and so at seven, they showed up at Harry’s with a keg and a few bottles of firewhiskey. Charlie brought a bag of crisps along, too, the sea salt and vinegar ones that Harry liked.
“Thank you,” Draco said, turning around to face Theodore Nott. He was still good-looking, in a rather dark and broody way, and had stopped all the slouching and slinking around he used to do at Hogwarts. Merlin, for a pureblooded aristocrat, Theo’d always had the
And then the evolved part of his brain, the one that could separate the baser, animalistic instincts from rational thought (the one he didn’t listen to nearly often enough), had told him he was being ridiculous. He’d had a bad dream and was being a paranoid wanker. He needed to pull the blanket down and take a look under the dresser, and then he would see that nothing was there, and he could get on with his day.
Draco collected Lia and flooed home with her. She stood at his window for a long time, watching cars go by on the street below. “They’re so fast,” she murmured. “What are they?”
Draco was sworn into office in the lobby of the Ministry of Magic, right in front of the enormous fountain dedicated to the Second Wizarding War. Harry stood nearby and was sworn in soon afterward. They looked at each other through the flashes of the cameras, through the parade of well-wishers, and time seemed to stand still. Draco strode over to Harry and pulled him close, nearly squeezing the breath out of him with his hug. “We did it,” he whispered.
Malfoy smacked him, not gently. “Why didn’t you bloody say anything? My god, I wouldn’t have – Harry! I wouldn’t have made your first time a quickie, for fuck’s sake!”
Harry stood, dropping the pillow, and walked over to him. “You acted like you were my friend, Draco,” he said, their faces only inches apart. “Then you acted like maybe you were more than that. You made me…made me
“I’m sure we could figure out a way to get out of here if we wanted. Walk a decent distance away and apparate somewhere,” Draco said. He didn’t particularly want to go back home, but he felt like Harry might. Even though he had fuck-all to do with this, he felt weirdly guilty, as though he’d planned it right alongside Pansy. Probably because ultimately, he didn’t mind being here with Harry. He didn’t mind it in the least. In fact, it felt like something conjured up out of one of his fantasies.
Hermione was still looking at him with raised brows, waiting for a real answer. “I don’t have the clearest memory of Friday, to be honest,” Draco said after a moment. “But I did wake up with Harry in my bed on Saturday.”
“Um, yes,” he said, not sure what she was getting at. Sometimes, he looked at Hermione and could practically
“I suppose you have an opinion on that?” Draco remarked, grabbing the tea cannister from the cabinet.
Potter, naked as the day he was born, threw the covers off and straddled Draco. “I’d say,” he said pressing kisses onto Draco’s cheek and along his jaw, “good. Because I like you too.”
, and you had taken the Mark. I would have thought they would have been fine with Daph marrying Theo. He’s got an old, powerful name, too.”
Frankie waved them over to where she was sitting. “You’ll sit here with me, since you’ve joined our company.”
Afterward, he banished the mess and sat still for long moments, staring at the photograph. He should burn this. He should destroy this and every other copy of it that came across his path. He raised his wand and braced himself, and then set his wand back down and put the magazine gently into a drawer and closed it and warded it, and then buried his head in his arms atop his desk.
Draco rested his forehead against his. “Ugh. We’re legends. This makes us absolute legends, you know that?”
“You seemed quite cozy with Scorpius when we returned,” Draco said with some hesitation. “I hope he was behaving.”
“Dangerous, William. A child grows. A child can serve as a pawn for any number of ambitious men,” said Berold.
Harry winced at his cheerful tone and slipped in through the door. Draco cast a hot air charm and dried him, and then grabbed his shirt, whispered, “I honestly didn’t think I could wait until Saturday,” and tugged him forward and began to kiss him.
“I know about a lot of things, Potter,” Draco said, and the way he said it, and the look in his eyes, was unmistakably flirtatious. Despite wanking himself off not ten minutes earlier, Harry felt his cock spring back to life, just a little, under his towel, and prayed Draco didn’t see it.
They stood there like that for far too long, in that muggle champagne bar, the sound of laughter and droning voices and the clink of ice cubes and the rattling of cocktail shakers ebbing and flowing all around them while they tried to make peace with the fact that they’d just dropped a grenade on their lives. Both of their lives; not just Harry’s. Draco wasn’t foolish enough to think otherwise.
“You liked that, did you?” Harry said, biting at Malfoy’s long, white throat. It smelled exotic and expensive and sinful.
Granger looked over at Draco, and he shrugged. “A…well, a non-religious exorcism. We are rather convinced this is a possession, but we’re not certain whether the church can help us.”
She was still lovely, all those years from now, but here, on this sun-drenched street, Draco saw clearly how time had changed her. Here, before her life was full of blood and terror and pain and loss, the little worry lines across her forehead were not yet present and her eyes were clear and vibrant. She was thin, of course (she’d always been thin), but healthy, with none of her more recent tendency-towards-gauntness. She stood straight as a pin, unconcerned, proud, whole. A little irritated, perhaps, as she looked at him.
I’m the brave one, he thought to himself as he rode the lift to the lobby. I’m brave. Having lunch with Harry isn’t scary. It’s just lunch.
Draco tried and tried, and made Doors more often than not, but nothing was ever on the other side, except for once near the end of the day. The Door that time seemed more solid, more real, than the others, and Draco felt his nails digging into his palms as he walked towards it on unsteady legs. His hand was shaking a little as he placed it on the doorknob and pulled it open.
“You. Dating the American guy. We both have to work with him, you know. It’s unprofessional. You’re putting everyone in an awkward position. And it’s against bank policy.”
“Why?” asked Draco. “Why did they do this?” He prayed that it wasn’t because of him. If it was because of him, he didn’t think he could live with himself.
“N-yes,” she said, grounding it out. “I heard Daphne tell someone through the floo. I don’t know who. We fought about it afterward. She said it wasn’t a big deal.” Astoria’s eyes widened again after she finished speaking, like she was surprised she’d said any of it.
She was crying. Silently, but still. His mother – his mother with her ever-present poise and her ability to bear all things – was crying.
“Show me then,” Draco said, licking into his mouth, hungry. He could feel Draco hard against his thigh, and Draco’s hands were all over him, seeking bare skin.
?” Astoria said, her voice suddenly high and frightened. “Like what? What in Salazar’s name are you talking about?”
He was out of sight from the camp a moment later, on the other side of the next hill, when he heard something coming from behind. Before he could whirl around to see what it was, his arms were being pulled tightly behind his back and a hand was covering his mouth. “Don’t make a sound,” said a voice near his ear. “I’ve a knife, and I’ll use it.”
He woke up against Draco’s chest. They were spread across Draco’s sofa, and Harry had no idea when he’d fallen asleep, or how they’d ended up lying down. The light from the windows was slanted and mellow. Harry couldn’t see a clock and didn’t want to get up and get his wand, but it seemed like late afternoon. Draco’s old t-shirt smelled clean, like laundry detergent, and his skin smelled fresh, almost herbal.  Draco was sleeping on his back, one arm around Harry, and Harry was curled up at his side. Draco’s other hand was resting on his own chest. Harry looked at it, at the pristine fingernails, perfectly clipped and filed, and put his hand over it. Draco’s hand was cool, even though most of Draco was plenty warm. Harry closed his eyes and went back to sleep.
The crimes had been too many, too widely known. Too many people were still crying out for justice, hoping that the ruination of yet another life would somehow assuage the pain of their own losses. It never worked, Draco knew. More death and horror were only ever more death and horror. It only piled on top of all those other tragedies, rendering them heavier, more suffocating, instead of lightening the burden.
“Evening, darling,” Pansy said, sweeping into the seat next to Hermione. Draco sat down next to her, and Harry felt his stomach clench when those clear gray eyes flickered up to his and then away.
“Let’s talk about motive and means,” Pansy said, looking out at them. She grabbed the notebook back from Draco and held it in her lap, tapping her biro against her mouth. “Astoria’s first on my list. Anyone else?”
Just then, Xenophilius came up the stairs with a tray of bowls. “Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?”
“Not if we refuse to let it be,” Draco said, looking determined. “We can talk over our…past. If you want. If that would help.”
“Don’t mind him,” Frankie whispered to Draco after a while. “He never likes new people. Especially new people who’ve managed to catch William’s attention.”
“I like what I like,” Harry said stubbornly.  “I’m not a fickle bastard like you, growing up with tea and then abandoning it for the first fancy caffeinated beverage that came along. I’m
“Well, he’s always running off to talk to her. Study with her. That sort of thing. Haven’t you all noticed that he’s been gone a lot lately?”
Harry smiled. “Shut up. Listen.” He tucked some of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “I know I’m supposed to be brave. I know that. But for some reason, I can’t quite manage it when it comes to you. I want to say all these things and do all these things and I
There was a loud pop and suddenly Blaise and Astoria were there with the kids. Astoria was four months pregnant, and just starting to really show. “Hi,” she said, kissing Harry and then Draco. “That’s a lot of blueberries.”
Not a horrible response, Draco supposed. Not the best. But not bad, considering they were in medieval times, basically. “Frankie’s a good person,” he said. “A good friend.”
By the time September was looming, Harry knew he was going to quit his job. And he knew what he was going to do with all his time and his money. He just needed to convince Charlie to help him.
He had one moment, one single moment of apprehension, where his animal-brain sent out a warning that something wasn’t right. And then an
“Oh, well, I think we were all a little upset,” said Harry. “It’s an upsetting thing to think about, especially since it was probably someone we know pretty well.”
“Okay. Well, see you Monday night then, right?” Harry was keeping the kids Monday since they’d been at the Burrow Friday. Harry had already taken work off.
“Theo’s a good man. He wants us to be safe, is all. We’re not safe from the muggles anymore, Astoria. You’ve seen what’s happening.” Her mouth was all wobbly. “And he loves me. He loves me and he needs me right now. I can’t just –”
“Because of the Fidelus,” she said. He tried to nod, but couldn’t. It was like someone was holding up his chin. He smiled instead. “Draco told me. I suppose he had to guess what it was, hm? Well, that probably didn’t take too long. Draco’s clever.”
When he had enough, he took a deep breath and prayed that Lia would be quick on the uptake. Clutching the saddle under his arm, he burst through the door of the cottage and cast, and a Door appeared nearby. “Run!” he shouted, and Lia, bless her, ran.
