What would he think? Draco might have been the one to suggest the colouring in the first place, and he clearly had more experience with this kind of thing than Harry did, but that didn't mean he wouldn't be weirded out with actually seeing Harry get so into it. Merlin, they had only

"Me neither. I think a part of me didn't really believe we'd catch her tonight. I'm still in shock." She didn't seem shocked, though. She seemed nervous. Worried. She nibbled her lip and took a sip of tea, avoiding Harry's gaze before tentatively venturing, "That duel between you and Foley was looking pretty intense before Fathi and I were able to join you. You looked like you wanted her dead."
"There we go," Draco cooed as he began to move. "Put your hands on my hips. Good, now I want you to keep them there. Just lie back and let me take care of you."
"How are you feeling?" Draco asked as Harry rolled off of him and pressed himself along Draco's side in a stealth snuggle.
"My thoughts exactly," Draco replied. "This is the first time the
"Oh, no," Harry replied breathlessly, bracing himself on Draco's firm chest, feeling the Sectumsempra scars beneath his palms. "Hot stuff's great. You should"—he lifted himself until just the tip of Draco was inside him, then sat back down, hard—"definitely call me that."
They'd stationed undercover agents throughout the hospital around the clock and had a number of alarms set in place to notify everybody on the strike team when Foley's followers arrived. And then they waited.
"Like this," Harry breathed. "Want to see you."
"That's what you get for ignoring me," Harry said primly as Draco cast a Healing Charm on his burnt fingers.
Harry let himself be led over to his bed, sitting down amongst the mussed bed sheets while Malfoy looked him over.
Harry's heart was in his throat and he swallowed around the lump. He didn't want to make Draco miserable, he never wanted that. He reached out and tugged Draco back into his arms. "I—You're not a bad person, Draco, you're just being honest. And it's not an outlandish request to make of your partner, it's just hard. At least you're able to utilise your expertise by helping dole out medical care, and you're actually able to see the results of your contributions. I'm not good at the administrative, behind-the-scenes stuff, and I hate the gladhanding. I know it's important, and intellectually I know that it
Still, they all had had fun tonight, even with such heavy thoughts weighing on their minds. Things were getting worse in Ireland. Lady Foley had staged a coup of sorts, overthrowing the government and establishing her own dictatorial regime. She'd had several outspoken political rivals executed for treason, and had attempted to do the same for the Deputy Minister and the previous Head of the Auror Department; thus far they'd managed to evade capture and were continuing on in their resistance efforts, though now in a less official capacity. Parvati had announced tonight that she'd finally jumped through all of the hoops necessary to go over and help fight. She'd be leaving in less than a week, and Harry knew he hadn't managed to conceal his desire to join her, to do something more tangible.
Draco looked at him thoughtfully. "Assuming that wasn't some kind of goodbye wank and you're still interested in pursuing a relationship…" He waited for Harry to nod his agreement, a relieved smile crossing Draco's face when he did so. "Great. Well in that case, as I said before, I think we need to have a conversation about the whole"—he waved his hand towards his living room—"thing, but that can wait for another day. I think you need some time to process it first, and to really think about what you want."
, and he'd leaned in to give Harry a truly spectacular goodbye kiss.
He'd never experience that glorious freedom, either.
Draco settled in against the arm of the sofa, giving Harry an expectant look as he opened his arms. Harry didn't need any further encouragement. He wedged himself between the cushions and Draco, wrapping an arm around Draco's middle and pressing his cheek against his chest. Beneath him, Draco hummed, his body vibrating pleasantly as he ran a hand through Harry's hair and down his back.
He looked down at the coffee table and realised he'd somehow made it through several pages of the colouring book. It was open now to a picture of an Erumpent, which he'd scribbled a shocking purple with a lack of precision that made his cheeks grow warm. A spike of shame went through him as he realised how thoroughly he'd lost track of everything—time, his surroundings, and, apparently, even his ability to colour within the lines. It had been so easy to turn off his brain for a little while and let Draco take care of everything.
"Why don't you want me working the terrorist attack? It would make the most sense to have me on that team instead of here. You know I'm better at offense than defense."
He launched onto the platform, completely ignoring the queue. Thankfully he was still in his Auror robes and he was Harry bloody Potter, and the grumbles quickly cut off when they caught sight of who was cutting in. It took him a few seconds longer than usual to clear his mind enough to Apparate, but eventually he focused so intently on Draco that he was whisked away to the street outside the centre.
enjoyable manner. Harry shuddered. Right, then, that was plenty of prep.
"Parvati? What's wrong?"
"Coffee?"
Fathi was at the head of the table, as grim faced as ever, but Harry didn't think he was imagining the glimmer of hope in his eyes as he looked everybody over. Harry's racing heart skipped a beat.
Emily nodded. "Will you play, too? Sophie wants her prince." She looked over towards the toy chest in the corner where the handsome crowned head of a male doll was sticking out of the chaos.
It would be easier for Harry to carry the boy, but he understood why Cara felt she needed to do it. He stared at them for a moment, his heart beating strangely. With his towheaded locks, ones that would inevitably deepen with age as Cara's no doubt had, it wasn't difficult for Harry to see a young Draco in the sweet boy's face. Draco as he might have been at three years old, or perhaps Draco's child, the one he'd sometimes speak about in an abstract way, the one he so obviously wanted someday but didn't quite feel deserving of. He and Draco had talked often of their future together and what they wanted. They'd discussed someday getting married and maybe, when they were ready, having children through adoption or surrogacy. The possibility alone had always filled Draco with a wild-eyed sort of panic, mixed with a naked longing that had always made Harry's heart ache. Draco struggled with the idea of being a father, terrified he'd do as bad a job of it as Lucius, but Harry hadn't had that same fear. Harry knew Draco would make a brilliant dad, and the thought of raising a family with Draco had always filled him with a quiet, steady warmth. It had felt
"I thought using charms like that damaged the fabric," Harry said, mildly alarmed at the thought of harm coming to this outfit he'd already become ridiculously attached to.
"You look like you're about to face a Dark Lord. You know we don't have to do this if you're not ready. We could go for a walk outside instead, maybe grab a drink somewhere."
Draco's head whipped towards him in alarm. "It was too much, wasn't it? Fuck, I thought you were ready to be pushed, but I clearly misread—"
"This is it," Draco announced as he came to an abrupt stop, so sudden that Harry didn't have enough time to halt his momentum before barrelling right into him.
"Blaise." Of course. Harry knew he and Draco were close, but somehow Harry hadn't considered that Blaise might tell Draco where he'd gone.
"Yes. Maybe. I don't know." Harry threw up his hands in exasperation. "We're still figuring it out, aren't we? But I do know I want somebody who sees me as a partner, not a child they have to take care of."
"It's just…" Harry sighed, trying to figure out how to put it into words. "I know there's nothing wrong with wanting these kinds of things
"The scene? Like, of the crime?"
"What, do you think you're the only one who's struggled with their sexual desires?" Draco asked with a sardonic smile. "I know you've been… fixating on what you perceive as the abnormality of your desires, but that's actually something you have in common with a lot of people who enjoy sex outside what's considered mainstream. I'd say most of us go through a period of… reconciliation with whatever it is we're into, and I certainly wasn't immune to that." He frowned and looked away as he continued, "I didn't handle it well when I first started realising how much I enjoy taking control during sex, that the things I wanted went a bit farther than a bit of light bondage." He spoke matter-of-factly, but Harry could tell that whatever he was remembering was painful for him. "It didn't help that it wasn't long after the war and I was still coming to terms with everything I'd done, the things I'd been brought up believing. So then on top of dealing with that turmoil, when I finally had the chance to explore my sexuality and
as much), he couldn't begrudge them if it was one bar too far.
"Are you feeling all right?" Malfoy asked, his expression creased with concern. "Your heart rate is elevated. Is it the pain?"
acquainted with Harry's body. But this felt different, a new kind of vulnerability.
"These nice gentlemen are here to speak to you about last night, princess," Graham was saying to Emily, crouching down so he was on her level. "Do you think you could put your toys down for a moment and answer their questions?"
wrong or bad about what happened earlier." Harry opened his mouth to interrupt, but Draco quelled him with a severe look. "
, had all but resigned myself to being alone." He looked at Harry, his eyes so clear and grey, piercing straight into Harry's soul. "And that it's
Draco moaned, an obscene sound of pure pleasure, as he licked a bite of tiramisu from his spoon. Harry reached down to subtly adjust himself beneath the table, his cock throbbing as he thought of all the other ways he could get Draco to make that sound.
"I heard I'm with you today," drawled a smooth, familiar voice that sent shivers tingling down Harry's spine. He raised his head from his hands, his heart skipping a beat as he locked eyes with Draco Malfoy, who was lounging gracefully against the edge of Sue Li's empty desk.
Tonight, all he wanted to think about was Draco.
"Hi Emily," Draco said kindly as he lowered himself down into a squat. "I'm Draco, and this is my friend, Harry. Do you mind if we sit and ask you some questions?"
"And how are you feeling right now?"
"All right, then," Harry agreed, and then he took Draco back into his mouth.
Harry tried not to make a face—he was a grown adult and thus above such childish antics in reference to his best mates having kinky sex, but ugh—before turning pleading eyes on Draco. "I bet
"Oh, no, I don't think—"
"Nothing too exciting, I'm afraid. We just need to get a statement," Robards replied, leaning against Harry's desk and nearly toppling the unstable tower of paperwork. But for all that he was a large man, he still had the lightning-fast reflexes that had helped to earn him his position as Head Auror. He saved the tower from falling with a quick spell and a slightly reproachful look at Harry before continuing, "A woman was attacked outside her flat last night. She was robbed and banged up with some pretty nasty hexes, though she managed to escape before too much damage was done. We've been short-staffed because of that new Snidget Flu going around and we weren't able to get anybody out to St Mungo's before she was released. I know we usually send out one of the junior Aurors for this kind of thing, but unfortunately most of them have all caught the blasted flu."
perfectly fine if that changes as you play more and become more comfortable and confident."
That was all Harry could take without kissing Draco, so he stopped holding back and pulled him in close. Draco went easily, their mouths slotting together perfectly, the brush of their lips making Harry's insides light up the way it always did. How could Harry have possibly thought he could give this up?
"And wine," he added, brandishing the bottle. "I would've brought beer but I didn't have enough hands. The lady at the shop said Riesling should go well with Thai, so hopefully it's not shit."
"How do you like it?" Draco asked as he sucked on a spot behind Harry's ear that made Harry quiver. It was clear from Draco's tone that it was more command than question.
Harry grinned at him. "If it would make you feel better, you could always stay the night for observation. Keep a close eye on me and make sure I'm okay."
He was panicked and desperate as he burst through the doors, his mind so far from the deadly focus he'd felt when he'd been duelling Foley. Then, he'd been channelling his anger into one single purpose, intent on his task to destroy; saving people was so much harder than hurting them. He'd failed so many people in his lifetime, people who'd cared for him, trusted him, depended on him to protect them. The weight of those losses pressed down on him as he rushed through the corridors, checking each room for survivors who'd been left behind. He knew saving others wouldn't make up for the people he'd failed to protect, but maybe it would ease the burden. Maybe it would make it possible to bear.
"Oh, should I?"
This time it was Parvati's turn to wince, and Harry's stomach dropped when she didn't deny it. Apparently, that was
Draco looked surprised and pleased. "You want to be my boyfriend?"
"Yes, I suppose I did," Draco said softly. He looked back down at his meal, prodding at his fish with a hesitant finger to test the temperature, as a tiny smile plumped his cheeks.
"You could what, Harry?" Parvati asked sharply. "Lose control and do something stupid? What secret interrogation skills do you have that Fathi and the rest of his team don't? He's been doing this a lot longer than either of us have."
, Potter," he murmured against Harry's lips as he took Harry's cock in hand. Or rather,
"Okay, but what's that mean for us?" interrupted Imogen impatiently. She was the star Chaser and Captain of the Ballycastle Bats, an extremely accomplished duellist, and a long-time vocal critic of Lady Foley before the Lady had grabbed enough power to issue a warrant for Imogen's arrest. She was an asset to the resistance, but was not the most patient of people, and being unable to play the sport that was her life's calling for so long was starting to take its toll. "Are we thinking with her gone we can take back the country?"
Draco went still and his eyes were dark with want when Harry pulled back to look at him, his cheeks hot. He'd not said that word often, and never outside the heat of the moment, when Draco would kindly allow him to pretend he'd not said it at all. He was hoping the word would halt Draco's tailspin and remind him of the things he
Harry's chest expanded, because there it was again, further proof that Draco had grown, that he was a different man, a
"Does that sound all right to you, Harry?" Draco asked. "We could go over the lists together if you'd prefer, but I thought you'd be more comfortable without me here. That way, there's no extra pressure."
Harry's eyes widened as realisation dawned. "And when you say you've seen them
"That's good to know. I wasn't getting any of those vibes from you. It's perfectly fine if it doesn't ever have a sexual component for you." Draco paused significantly. "It's
considering how common injuries are in my line of work."
Two days later, on an incongruously sunny afternoon, Foley's team struck. The alarm blared throughout Fathi's manor and adrenaline flooded Harry's system as he Apparated straight to the scene, not bothering to check in with any of the others. They all knew the plan; he'd see them there.
Draco's playful expression darkened, and Harry felt like an idiot. The rumours coming over from Ireland didn't exactly make for light conversation, especially given Harry and Draco's difficult history. Lady Foley's rising popularity and her emphasis on the importance of magical power, the way her detractors seemed to disappear, the increase in hate crimes against Squibs and the magically weak, not to mention against Muggles, was all a little too reminiscent of Voldemort. It was all conjecture and hearsay at this point, rumours trickling in from not-so-far-abroad, but it still made the hairs on Harry's arms stand up.
a run towards the door. "Thanks for having me over. It was fun. I guess I'll see you at work Monday." Draco got up and Harry waved him off, his heart racing with something not unlike panic. "No, no, don't get up! I can see myself out. Totally—"
that. The kinds of activities that Draco had alluded to dreaming about weren't exactly the types of things they were doing together.
Harry's belly flipped but he nodded, and something seemed to change within Draco, a subtle shift in the way he carried himself that made Harry sit up and take notice.
It had taken all of his strength not to take a peek the moment Draco had left the night before, but he knew once he started he wouldn't be able to stop, and he really had needed to get some sleep. He had a feeling that
He stepped out of the doorway, waving Harry and Draco inside before shutting the door and turning to Draco. "It's within her limits for me to invite a limited number of people over while she's playing, but I'd still like to make sure she's all right with being questioned before you see her. If you want to follow me upstairs, you can wait outside the door until I give the go-ahead." He gave Draco a hard stare. "Unfortunately, if she's not feeling up to it, I'll have to invite you both back to question her later." His tone brooked no argument, and Draco didn't seem inclined to give him one.
which Harry was. "Or," Draco continued, "we can both make a difference here. Where it's safe."
"Then I'll see you in a week."
Harry's heart was pounding so loud he was sure it was audible as he grabbed a handful of Floo powder and called out for Draco's flat at two-fifty-nine on Saturday. Having already made a good amount of progress on the state of Grimmauld Place with all his recent anxiety-induced cleaning, he'd decided to spend the morning out in the garden, pulling up weeds and trimming the grass and various hedges. It was physical work and helped keep both his mind and body busy. So busy, in fact, that he'd lost track of time and had to scramble to grab a quick shower and change before his date with Draco. He'd worked right through lunch and debated grabbing a banana as a quick snack, but he wasn't feeling all that hungry, his stomach churning with nerves. Harry wasn't keen on possibly throwing up partially digested banana all over Draco's expensive carpet upon going through the Floo, so he figured it best if he skipped it.
"Right, pleased to meet you. I'm Auror Potter, and this is Auror Malfoy, and yes, we're here to speak with Emily about what happened last night."
Harry swallowed heavily. "Quick is good."
"Yes, Mr…?"
you," Draco said with a huff. "You didn't even say anything."
people. They'd be people who were like Harry, who had maybe struggled the way Harry was struggling. "That… might be nice."
Their duel, heated as it was, required all of Foley's considerable focus, so when Fathi and Parvati joined the fight—while the rest of the resistance kept Foley's remaining minions preoccupied—she didn't stand a chance. The sudden presence of Harry's comrades by his side brought him back to himself, helped settle some of his fury, and reminded him that as much as he might desire otherwise, they needed to capture Foley alive. They needed her to break into her manor's wards and root out the rest of her followers, and they were all fairly certain she was the type to have a self-destruct set up in the event of her capture.
"Oh." Harry laughed under his breath. Trust Malfoy to make blowjobs about winning. Still, Harry never shied away from a bit of healthy competition. "I'd say we both did. Wouldn't you?"
"I'm not really sure where to start."
"I thought—" Harry broke off, gasping as Draco began to sit down on his cock. "I didn't think you liked it like this."
"Did you see the front page of the
But there was a difference between satisfaction in a relationship of equals, and enjoying having your boyfriend occasionally call you his good boy because you correctly brewed some Rainbow Hair Tonic from the My First Potions set. Try as he might, Harry felt like he kept hitting the same stone wall when it came to the kinky aspect of things. There was desire and shame in almost equal measure, and Harry didn't know which was stronger, didn't know how to jump over this hurdle. Harry wasn't sure he could get himself to a point of acceptance with his desires, but now that he'd had a taste, he wasn't sure he could go without, either. At least not if he was with Draco. Draco had made it clear, repeatedly, that he'd be happy enough to ditch the kink, but Harry wasn't sure he could turn off that part of their relationship even when he wasn't certain he could keep doing it. Those memories wouldn't disappear, and Harry wasn't sure he could be with Draco without the constant reminder that he could have what he wanted if only he could find a way to make his peace with it and ask.
"It's all right if you want to leave," he said evenly. "But before you go, we need to discuss what just happened."
, not exactly, even though just thinking the word sent a white-hot bolt of lust-tinged shame spearing through him.
Harry shuddered and kissed Draco hard, very much on board with Draco's plan. He loved all the things they did together in bed, and though he couldn't deny he had a particular fondness for losing his mind on Draco's cock, there was something about fucking Draco that always undid him. Maybe because he knew how much it meant for Draco, who hated being vulnerable, to open himself up to Harry in that way. Maybe because there was something undeniably powerful about reducing his beautifully controlled lover into a quivering mess of desire. It was a gift that Draco trusted him so much, one that never failed to fill Harry with awe and gratefulness.
"What?" Ron answered, his tone alarmed as he strode into view. Ron and Malfoy had formed a surprisingly solid bond over the course of the case that Harry absolutely was
"Always," Draco replied, spreading himself out luxuriously on the bed sheets, his body a decadent fruit, ripe for the picking.
"Like a film!"
but it was all so hazy and distant.
before tying them around Cara and Sean's faces, then doing the same for himself. He tried a spell to clear the air, but it barely lasted a second beneath the constant onslaught of smoke.
Draco's hands slid along the insides of Harry's thighs and Harry gasped, his cock twitching as Draco's palms drew nearer. Draco leaned forward, his hot breath ghosted over Harry's flies as he met Harry's gaze, and Harry couldn't help but whimper when Draco smirked up at him.
"I've got time." Harry holds up the watch with a grin. "Thanks to you."
Harry sighed and nodded, his stomach churning with anxiety as he gestured towards the living room with the air of a man marching to his death. It wasn't doing him any good to keep trying to put things off, though, and he was already about as ready as he could get.
sounded mortifying. He shook his head.
"Eventful night, eh?" Parvati asked after they'd finished securing the prisoners in the dungeons. She'd made some tea and passed Harry a mug, which he took gratefully.
Another flare of heat, the high points of Draco's cheeks blooming pink as his breath hitched.
It was nearly one o'clock in the afternoon by the time Harry got back to Grimmauld Place, his stomach growling and head spinning. He was just throwing together a ham sandwich when an owl swooped through the open window, dropping an expensive-looking envelope onto the table, Harry's name written on the outside in a familiar script.
"Next, I'd like you to take a look at these." Harry reached for them and Draco laughed, holding them out of reach. "Not right now. I want you to look them over by yourself."
He closed his eyes.
Harry nodded, reaching out and pulling Draco to stand between his spread legs. He nuzzled at Draco's bulge, maintaining eye contact and watching as Draco's flimsy resolve began to melt away. "Yeah," Harry breathed, right against the damp patch beginning to form from Draco's leaking cock. "You should give me
Harry goggled at him. He'd not expected Draco to come right out and say it so baldly. Draco stared at him patiently, and Harry gave a brief and somewhat reluctant nod.
Draco stared at him. It was as if he saw something in Harry's expression that he wanted to dig into, but he appeared to let it go, for now. He relaxed back, giving Harry an encouraging smile as he pulled several folded sheets of parchment from his jacket pocket.
Harry nuzzled against Draco's chest, practically purring with pleasure as Draco ran an absent-minded hand up and down Harry's back. They were curled up together on Draco's sofa, watching some Muggle cartoons on Draco's telly as Harry came out of his littlespace. He'd spent the afternoon in the outfit Draco had modified for him, though it was already beginning to fray, the growing charms finally beginning to take their toll on the fabric. Harry didn't mind—it was still nicer than anything the Dursleys ever got for him—but Draco insisted that there'd be something new for Harry to wear next time, which filled him with a quiet excitement.
Draco's grip tightened and he began to wank Harry faster, twisting his wrist on every upstroke in a way that made Harry gasp into Draco's mouth. Draco hummed with obvious pleasure, humping into Harry's fist as he kissed Harry hard and deep.
Harry's stomach flipped as he tossed the waiting owl a treat and reached for the letter. He opened it with shaking hands, steeling his spine as he prepared himself for whatever was inside.
Throughout their meal, Harry was a jumbled, distracted mess. Such a mess, in fact, that it took him until they'd finished eating to realise he wasn't the only one who was preoccupied. The fact that Draco hadn't called Harry out on his distraction should have been Harry's first clue, really. Now that they didn't have the food to divert them, it was clear that there was something weighing on Draco's mind—he barely seemed to notice the unbelievable-looking biscuits currently being showcased on the baking programme. He shifted on the sofa cushions, and his eyes darted to a paper bag that appeared to have been hastily stowed beneath the coffee table. Harry might've suspected condoms and lube, except Draco was a pure-blood wizard and probably had no clue what condoms even were. Besides, the bag was far too long and flat for that, much to Harry's disappointment.
, Draco. I'm getting close, I'm gonna—"
He settled in at his desk, wondering at the strange quiet of the Auror Department. It was early afternoon and generally there were more people milling about at this time, but the entire floor was eerily silent. Perhaps there was some meeting or training that he'd not been invited to since he'd been gone most of the week. They'd got back from Berlin a few hours ahead of schedule, and Harry debated going home instead of sticking around through the end of the work day. He had some paperwork he could be filling out, but nothing that was immediately pressing, and the thought of finally being
"Thanks for coming out tonight," Harry told Draco as they made their way into their flat and up the stairs to their bedroom. "I know you've got a full plate right now and you have to be knackered, but it means a lot when you join us."
jealous of.
"You left," Harry persists. "Where did you go?"
certainly wouldn't be. Which meant he didn't so much as feel a flicker of guilt about using some of the more unsavoury curses and hexes in his arsenal, ones he'd not learned from the Auror Department, but found in old books at Grimmauld Place. He'd spent a lot of time in the library there in the weeks before he was sent over to Ireland. He had been looking for a different sort of spell at the time, some kind of solution to a problem he'd desperately wanted to solve. Harry hadn't found the answers he'd been searching for, but he'd walked away with a whole host of new knowledge that he'd thought might come in handy while fighting a war.
"But I just don't see what
Draco let Harry pay on the provision that he'd cover their next date, and Harry knew he wasn't the only one feeling slightly giddy at the tacit promise that there
He broke off, a strange and slightly hesitant expression creasing his face. Harry didn't want to stop sucking, so he made a noise of inquiry around Draco's cock.
"Yeah," Harry said, managing to force the words out of his dry throat. "Robards needs me to take a statement on an assault case. You're my babysitter."
it was outside his usual preferences. Other than a bit of manhandling during sex, they'd not done any of the other activities Draco had mentioned being interested in; what was Draco even getting out of their arrangement, anyway? What would happen if he realised that the things Harry wanted were just a little
Was that something he wanted? Was there a choice he could live with?
"I'm fine, I just need to change."
to put this to rights, but yes, I can fix it for you." Malfoy's tone is perfectly polite, as is his expression as he looks blandly over at Harry. Harry hates that all it takes is Malfoy simply acting like a professional to get Harry riled up. He suppresses the instinct to prod at Malfoy until his mask cracks. He's an adult; no need to go pulling pigtails for attention. Instead, he gives Malfoy a blinding smile, pleased when Malfoy blinks at him in surprise, his cheeks pink.
Draco rose a single eyebrow but nodded. "All right. Mine is Thistle."
Draco winced. "Partially. It's a lot more varied and nuanced than that, though. Plenty of people in the community aren't into whips or blindfolds at all. There are a lot of different kinds of relationships and dynamics that people engage in under the BDSM umbrella. Emily and Graham are one of them."
"Fuck, you feel so good, sweetheart," Draco moaned, his hands braced on Harry's chest as he angled his downward thrusts to hit his sweet spot. "Always so good for me, so perfect." Warmth flooded through Harry at the praise, at seeing Draco's face flush with pleasure and knowing he was the one making Draco feel good with his cock and obedience.
Harry got where Draco was coming from, long-distance relationships were difficult enough without the added element of Draco constantly fearing for Harry's life. The two of them signing up together would eliminate the long-distance aspect, but it would add in combined danger for them both. Harry might be able to live with that—it would hardly be the first time he feared for his loved ones' safety—if it weren't for the fact that he knew Draco would be miserable. Draco had committed himself to being a better person and fighting for what was right, but he wasn't the kind of person to put himself in constant danger. He might do well under pressure, but being under continual threat was a different matter entirely. Asking Draco to put himself in a situation where he'd constantly be battling his instincts to do whatever he needed in order to escape the situation wasn't what Harry wanted. He didn't want Draco to survive, he wanted him to thrive.
Harry nodded, gingerly holding out his throbbing arm. Malfoy stepped forward, pressing his cool fingers against the inflamed skin before casting a complex series of diagnostic spells that made Harry's stomach clench. Not from the spells themselves, but from the casual display of skill as Draco whizzed through the complicated wandwork. He frowned for a moment, then nodded.
Draco looked somewhat relieved by Harry's confirmation.
"Fathi's just called an emergency meeting downstairs."

it as well, feel the tingly tendrils of it wrapping around Harry's body and mending him up. Who was this Draco Malfoy who spent his days and nights tirelessly working to help others? Harry wanted to get to know him, wanted to find out if it was all just a ruse to restore his family name, or if he'd actually had a change of heart, if he genuinely wished to make amends for the horrible choices he'd made as a child.
was a Healer at a hospital, tirelessly working himself to the bone to help others. That Foley would target such a place of healing and care… it was monstrous. It wasn't the first time she'd targeted the wounded, but it still shocked and appalled Harry just the same. His breath began to speed up, his limbs tingling and his head spinning. The people working in that hospital were other people's Dracos. They had friends and family, loved ones who would mourn the loss of them, that wouldn't ever be the same if they died. There would be entire worlds destroyed if the attack went off as planned.
"Ready?" he asked as he slid his fingers out and covered his cock with the rest of the lube.
Draco nodded, relief flickering in his eyes. "Yes, of course. I'm happy to answer any questions you have."
didn't always understand it—but that didn't make it any less real. If he and Draco both wanted it and it wasn't hurting anybody, then what did it matter what anyone else thought? Nobody else had to know, and if they ever found out, well, Harry could cross that bridge when he came to it. Maybe by then he'd have fully made his peace with his desires, maybe he'd have worked past the internalised shame and guilt that even now still prickled at him, though he knew it shouldn't. That kind of conditioning didn't disappear overnight. He just hoped Draco had the patience to deal with him as he continued working on it.
"It's okay. Everything's going to be fine, Daddy."
"If you're sure… you certainly didn't seem hampered any."
It wasn't all bad, but in Harry's more-limited-than-he'd-prefer experience, his
, but there was strange heat in his belly that indicated perhaps he wasn't as opposed to the idea as he might have believed. Yes, it all seemed a little baffling and strange, but it was the kind of strange that made Harry want to dig deeper and learn more. There'd been a spark of feeling inside of him earlier as he watched Graham and Emily interact, something not unlike envy and longing. He wanted to deny it, to pretend he hadn't recognised what those feelings might mean, but he generally wasn't very good at lying to himself, even when he really, really wanted to.
Then again, Harry wasn't all that sure that he wanted kinky books lying around his house, just begging to be discovered by any of the various friends that seemed to let themselves into his house as they pleased. Leaving hard evidence like that around was too risky, just asking to be caught, really. If it wasn't poor Ron stumbling upon something he couldn't unsee, it'd be Kreacher finding them in one of his paltry attempts at cleaning, and Harry very much didn't want to hear any opinions Kreacher might have on the subject.
"Has the space helped?" Harry flushed and looked away. "That's what I thought," Draco said softly. "I think it's time for another one of those talks you enjoy so much. Let's go sit down."
Out of nowhere, Harry's conversation with Blaise several weeks ago popped into his head.
"Fuck, I'm already so close," he said, and Harry let out a happy moan. He was pretty fucking close himself, aided by nothing more than the thick weight of Draco's cock in his mouth and his own hand kneading his trouser-clad erection.
"No sex?"
Draco's expression softened and he gave Harry a slight, almost shy smile. "We can do that."
"Hi, come in." Draco opened the door wider and stepped aside to let Harry pass. He brushed a brief kiss against Harry's cheek as he entered that set them both blushing like schoolchildren.
"You do like them then," Draco said with satisfaction.
"I feel
"You think it'll get that far?"
"Exactly," Harry agreed, pressing in closer, pleased that Draco seemed to welcome the post-coital twining of their bodies. Harry loved the feeling of Draco's warm, bare skin against his own, the gentle press of his soft dick against Harry's thigh, the firm swell of his bicep curled around Harry's back. "Definitely best for all involved if you stay right here tonight. We can…" Harry hesitated. "We can get breakfast tomorrow. Maybe talk about… things."
"Oh, fuck," Harry said as he scanned the article.
Draco laughed and flashed Harry a pleased grin that made his stomach wriggle—or maybe that was just the hunger.
"Hmm?" Harry blinked and tore his focus away from Draco's hands, realising they were already at the Apparition Platform in the Atrium. "Oh, right. Err… maybe we should Side-Along. Since we're going to the same place anyway," Harry added, not wanting to seem overly eager to get his hands on Draco despite that being very much the case.
She returned ten minutes later, and Harry tossed her a treat before tearing open the missive attached to her leg. An ornate gold key fell out of the envelope and into his hand as he slid out the accompanying sheet of parchment.
, none of that was safe or easy. It was uncertain and unknown, thrilling and terrifying, each day a new discovery as they figured out how they fit. Normally Harry's stomach was a jumbled mess every time they were together, filled with butterflies and want, tentative excitement tempered with caution. Right now, all of that was gone, and it was a relief. Those were the thoughts and cares of adult Harry, and for now, at least, they were no longer his concern.
be a next time. Harry wasn't sure yet if there was more simmering between him and Draco than some serious sexual tension, but he knew it would take more than one night to work it out. There'd be time to explore the possibilities of Harry's unexpected
Mercifully, by Saturday Harry is right as rain and looking forward to seeing Malfoy again. Warmth curls in his belly as he pushes open the door to the shop, welcomed by the
"Excuse me?" Malfoy's eyes narrow.
The last thing in the world Harry wanted to do was hurt Draco, and he had to admit, fucking off to fight abroad would certainly put a crimp in his upcoming plans. He thought of the ring currently burning a hole through the top drawer of his desk at work, and the reservation he'd just made a few months from now at Draco's favourite restaurant. He'd ask now, tonight, but he thought popping the question on the two-year anniversary of Harry ending up in Draco's examination room for the very first time had a nice kind of symmetry to it. Draco was the person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, and Harry wanted to make it official, to unequivocally claim Draco as his own in front of the word. It wouldn't be the most auspicious start to their life together if Harry were to propose right before leaving for a dangerous volunteer mission he might not come back from.
"Six it is."
Draco's smile was sunshine bright. "That makes me very happy. I know it's a vulnerable position you're putting yourself in, and it's an honour that you're willing to share that with me."
Harry turned accusing eyes onto Ron, the filthy traitor. "I don't need a babysitter!" Nor did he need to spend more time with Malfoy, especially now that the case was all wrapped up. He was starting to reach critical levels of the horn, and too much exposure to Malfoy and the shirt that was currently clinging to his surprisingly defined biceps might lead to Harry doing something… rash and ill-advised. He was already seriously concerned he'd caught a case of the
Malfoy's nose wrinkled. "I'm not all that keen on the place either, nor are they particularly fond of me, but needs must. Weasley must have something truly and spectacularly depraved planned for his and Granger's anniversary given his reaction just now and I, for one, do not plan on finding out what happens if I don't ensure you're all healed up and unable to infringe upon their weekend."
close, that while he'd been busy focusing on bringing Draco off, Draco had managed to take him right up to the brink. "Gonna come. Gonna come all over you. Want you to do it with me."
glad that Draco clearly shared his desire—three dates in and they'd yet to even kiss.
. You're not the first person to find peace in a bit of age regression, and what you, or anybody else, does in private is of no concern to anybody else as long as it isn't hurting someone."
His brow furrowed. Blaise's villa was unoccupied for a good portion of the year, so there wasn't any reason for unexpected visitors to come calling. Hardly anybody knew that Harry was here in the first place, and the few that did wouldn't just show up unannounced—if there was an emergency, Ron and Hermione would come through the Floo address he'd sent them, otherwise they'd write first. Slowly, he got up from the sofa and made his way towards the incessant knocking. Wand at the ready, he warily opened the door and promptly froze when he saw who was on the other side.
Still, it was a hard thing to reconcile. Harry was only just starting to wrap his head around the fact that he wanted to
Draco's palm ghosted over Harry's side, the one that had been torn open not all that long ago. "Your side, how is it?" Draco brow furrowed as he looked down at the unblemished skin, seeming far more concerned than was warranted. "That was… probably a more vigorous shag than is advisable after a Healing spell."
, but having Malfoy care for him while he was ill… there might not be any coming back from that.
Harry grinned. "Yeah, works for me."
of a magical bell charm and the pleasing scent of polish.
Harry was wrenched from his pleasant daydreams by an anguished shout that caused his blood to freeze with dread. He shot up from his desk and looked towards the door.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Is there a reason why I shouldn't? I mean, if there's nothing wrong with it, then…"
—Merlin, was Hermione giving lessons?—and Harry promptly zipped his lips. It probably would not be smart to rile up the man with the wand pointed at his side.
"What is it? Were you able to get any information."
"Here," Draco said. "Why don't you drink some of this? It'll make you feel better."
Harry fought back the instinctive urge to argue. He'd always been a man of action, but Draco was right, he didn't always have to be the one putting his life on the line. There were ways to help that didn't involve putting himself in physical danger, that didn't involve him leaving his life and loved ones behind.
Malfoy sighed. "Your shirt. Take it off so I can heal the great big bloody gash in your side." The
"Harry." Vaguely Harry registered Draco calling his name, but he'd just figured out how to get Merlin to shoot green sparks out of his tiny little wand and he was utterly absorbed. "Harry!" This time the tone was firm and sharp, jolting Harry out of his game. He turned towards Draco.
It worked, for a little while, but at the end of each day he came back to the large, empty villa, with nothing to occupy himself with other than his thoughts.
know about this little trip, then, if she's playing it so close to her chest? How do we know she's not setting a trap?" challenged one of the wizards leaning insociently against the wall. Harry couldn't remember the bloke's name, he only knew he was the resistance's connection to some of the more unsavory elements, not unlike Mundungus Fletcher had been for the Order. Though from what Harry had seen, he appeared more trustworthy than Mundungus had ever been—at least all of the silver in Fathi's manor seemed to be accounted for.
been starting to get somewhere, to see if maybe they could make their relationship work, and then Harry had to go and ruin it all. Even if Draco was understanding of Harry's… inclinations, there was no way he'd be able to see Harry as a potential sexual and romantic partner after this. Not after Harry had just spent who-knew-how-long acting like a bloody
"What would you like, sweetheart?" Draco asked, his voice still a bit drowsy. That must be why he called Harry sweetheart, which he never did when Harry was big. It made Harry's heart thump and his stomach wriggle. "Do you want my cock?"
Harry collapsed back against the brick wall lining the alleyway, panting with pain and adrenaline as Ron and Malfoy took down the last of the baddies they'd been duelling. They'd been working this case for months, and though they hadn't planned on wrapping things up tonight, in the end it had all gone off without a hitch.
"Good, that's good. If… if you'd rather go through your answers together so we can talk things over before I plan out a scene, we can do that, too. I'm not trying to rush you, I just thought you'd want to get started sooner rather than later."
"As Harry said, it seems we'd have a
," Harry said emphatically, his gaze caught on Draco's cock. It was flushed pink and leaking at the tip, just long and thick enough to make Harry really feel it.
Draco rolled his eyes with obvious fondness as he nodded his head down the hall.
Harry nodded, his stomach churning too violently to speak as Draco casually reminded him that they hadn't actually figured everything out just yet.
"She leaves in a week," Byrne continued. "And she'll be gone for four days."
Fathi inclined his head towards Parvati in acknowledgement. "That is correct. And we have less than a week to make an airtight plan of attack, hence this emergency meeting. Byrne has been able to provide us with what he believes is the time and place that Lady Foley will leave the protection of her wards. From that moment, we'll have approximately five minutes during which time Lady Foley will have to create and activate the Portkey—thankfully she's paranoid enough that she won't trust anybody else to create it on her behalf, nor will she create it beforehand and risk it being tampered with. That is our window to attack and take Lady Foley hostage. We can expect up to a dozen of her closest confederates to be with her."
that we can also do away with this entirely. I think that would be a mistake, not because I don't think we couldn't have a fulfilling relationship without it, but because it's clear to me that it's something that brings you genuine happiness and peace, at least when you allow yourself to forget about the rest of the world and just do what feels good. I want you to know that's always an option. Even if you just want to put a Freezing Charm on it for a few weeks or longer while you work things out in your head. It's not a prerequisite for us having a satisfying relationship, at least not for me."
"Weasley," Malfoy said, his worried eyes not leaving Harry's face. "Something's wrong with Potter."
"Go!" he shouted, and she dashed off, Sean held securely in her arms, his head buried in her neck as she dodged through the fiery obstacle course that was once the hospital's entrance hall. Harry flanked her, tossing up a Shield Charm when something exploded nearby, sending molten hospital cart hurtling towards them, and doing his best to clear their path. The air began to clear somewhat as they neared the door, which Harry realised was open. Shadowy figures emerged from the smoke, clearly guarding the entrance, and Harry felt a spasm of terror before recognition set in.
, I'm so damn close."
Draco flashed him a wry grin, but he edged back just a tad, enough so that the scent and feel of him wasn't quite so overwhelming. Harry took a deep breath, focused on their destination, and Apparated them both.
"I know," Draco replied patiently, unruffled by Harry's confusion. "I went through your forms thoroughly, but I find it's best to have a safe word regardless of what activities we engage in so that it's unequivocally clear when something crosses a line and you need to end a scene. Just because we won't be playing with consent doesn't mean there aren't instances where you might tell me no without wanting the scene to end."
He heard Draco coming up behind him, his steps slow and measured, as if he was afraid to spook Harry like some frightened rabbit. Draco reached for Harry's trembling hand, taking hold of it in a firm grip as he turned Harry around to face him.
of him coming was enough to push Harry over the edge himself, and he bit down on Draco's lips as his climax hit.
enthusiastically.
"Would you like to change now?" Draco asked gently. "You can meet me out in the living room when you're done."
), hadn't wanted to dress up in kids' clothes and play with toys. Maybe it was something that only Draco brought out in him, something that would go away if they were no longer together?
"Merlin," Harry said in exasperation. This wasn't the first 'Auror consult' Seamus had requested of him. "What have his housemates done now?"
"And now?" Draco asked, hope and apprehension warring in his eyes.
"Agreed," Draco said, and his smile was warm and sincere. "Until then." He leaned forward and brushed a soft kiss across Harry's cheek as he opened his front door. "Goodnight, Harry. And sweet dreams."
Harry's brain momentarily melted at the wicked image Draco's words conjured, so similar to the filthy fantasies that had taken root in Harry's head when Draco had strolled back into his life all those months ago.
Something complicated flashed in Draco's eyes—fear and hope and pleasure—and he reached out, pulling Harry in for a toe-curling kiss. His fingers slid through Harry's hair as Harry's arms wrapped around him, relishing the feeling of Draco's hard, strong body up against him. Draco's lips were soft and sure, and fuck if Draco didn't know how to kiss, deep and coaxing, easily getting Harry's mouth to open beneath him. Harry'd been kissed plenty before, but never like this, with such passion and skill, like Draco had been dreaming of kissing Harry for a long damn time and was keen to make it count. It was exhilarating, and Harry never wanted it to end.
He yawned, the long day catching up to him, and Parvati huffed a gentle laugh. The two were nothing alike, but Draco used to laugh just like that when Harry was exhausted at the end of the day before ushering him off to bed. Godric, what Harry wouldn't give to be home right now in the flat they shared, crawling into bed with him right at that moment.
Draco nodded before leaning down and giving Harry a deep, thorough kiss. He slid his fingers through Harry's hair, scratching lightly at his scalp as his tongue slid into Harry's mouth. It was a brilliant kiss and Harry lost himself in it, so he was surprised when Draco finally pulled away and Harry noticed that, at some point during the kiss, Draco had sunk to his knees.
Draco laughed. "Yes, of course. It looks like we're done eating. Shall we head back to the office to transcribe and file her statement?"
. We should have been calling for the Healers and admitting her to Janus Thickney, not interviewing her as if she wasn't in the middle of a psychotic break!"
sounded delightful. Draco wasn't working at St Mungo's today but Harry knew he was volunteering his services at the relief centre for another hour or two. There was plenty of time for Harry to go home and shower, and then maybe greet Draco with some takeaway.
Harry scoffed. Nothing against Fathi (well, a little against him, seeing as he had shown the poor judgement of not letting Harry in on the interrogation) but Harry didn't have high hopes. "She won't give us a thing, not willingly."
"Imogen!" he called out, drawing her eye and her wand before she realised it was him. Her gaze quickly travelled to Cara and her brother, and she snapped into action, yelling something in Gaelic outside. One of the younger members of the resistance—Neil? Niall?—popped up by the door, clearly on point to escort Cara to wherever they were taking civilians. Harry turned to face her.
Draco's lips twitched as if he were fighting a smile, but he gamely held his arm out to Harry. "Of course," he said solemnly. "I'd hate for us to land right on top of one another." The hot gleam in his eyes belied that particular statement, and Harry's belly gave another enthusiastic shiver.
sexual way, but he couldn't help but feel there was something bad in it, something wrong, no matter what all the websites and Draco had said. It certainly didn't help his mindset that there were several roleplay activities on the list, including Parent/Child and Older Sibling/Younger Sibling. The fact that Draco had included them certainly indicated a certain open-mindedness on Draco's part, but it wasn't one Harry was sure he shared. Was that kind of play taking it too far?
The world around Harry had devolved into chaos.
"Mountain Troll's all taken care of?" Malfoy asks, but his smile is more amused than mocking.
"Well?" Draco prompted after Harry was silent for several long moments, losing himself in the pleasure-pain of Draco abusing his nipples.
"More waiting," Parvati said, giving Harry a commiserating pat on the shoulder.
"There was
Draco sighed again, pulling the batter off the last of his fish with those long fingers of his. "We frequent some of the same establishments in London. Those that cater to people with more… particular tastes."
"You look even better than I imagined," Draco continued while his hands slid up Harry's flexing thighs. His gaze fixated on Harry's cock, which was smacking against Draco's belly as Harry rode him, leaving a trail of sticky precome in its wake. It was ridiculously hot, and Draco seemed to agree, because he licked his lips as he reached out, grabbing hold of Harry with both hands.
"Hmm?"
Harry grinned, familiar enough with Blaise by now to know he was being humorous, not insulting. "It's still… new, yeah? I want to give it a little longer before I sic this lot on them."
He was frustrated that Parvati was treating him like he was a child she had to monitor, and tried to remind himself that he appreciated that she cared. "I hope he will be," Harry said softly. "Not like I can tell him about it." Parvati nodded, looking encouraging and sympathetic, though her smile grew tight and brittle as he continued, "I mean, I know the likelihood is low, especially now that we've got Foley, but we can't risk putting any sensitive information like that in our letters home. I'll have to wait until I get home to tell him."
. His voice was softer, kinder, than Harry had ever heard it before and that, more than anything, drove home his next words. "There were no survivors."
Harry tempered his approach, adjusting to account for the switch from one-on-one to three-on-one. By some unspoken agreement, Harry continued with his offensive assault, doing his best to keep her occupied and distracted while Parvati and Fathi got into position, easily deflecting the occasional spells Foley lobbed their way. It wasn't a new tactic, but it'd never made him feel so much like a third wheel before. Which was ridiculous, his role here was crucial, and the three of them worked well together. But he was used to being part of a
real, Harry, don't you get that? Using your fame to garner support and donations might not be exciting or glamorous, it might even be uncomfortable, but in the end, so much comes back to money." He gave a bitter laugh as he tugged at the buttons on his shirt. "Trust me, I grew up with money, I know. Yes, the work that they're doing right now over in Ireland is important and necessary, but they also need funding, and they'll continue to need it after the war is over and they need to rebuild."
Harry's eyebrows went up and he put away his quill and the partially written letter with a sweep of his wand. "Do you know what's going on?"
," Harry said emphatically with only the smallest hint of a leer. "Seriously," he continued when Draco's brow remained creased. "I'm all healed, promise. Your wand fixed me right up." He waggled his eyebrows, quite pleased with his double entendre. Draco snorted, seemingly less impressed, though his expression eased somewhat.
. All that time at Hogwarts, there was this amazing person buried inside that scared, self-important boy, a person that never would have been able to grow and flourish if not for the harsh realities the war had brought. The war had wrought so much devastation, but Harry was so fucking grateful that it had been the catalyst that burned Draco's old world to the ground so his best self could emerge like a phoenix from the ashes.
"Yeah, I know," Harry said, though these days he wasn't quite sure he agreed with that sentiment. Quiet just left room for him to think, to miss the people who weren't with him and the life he had before the call of duty brought him hundreds of miles away. "I'm feeling a little frustrated, that’s all. Besides, it makes me nervous when Lady Foley goes quiet. Every time that's happened over the last six months it's been right before something massive and awful, like when she attacked the
"Don't you? I mean, I want to say no, that they would have learned from our mistakes, but for Lady Foley to have got so far…"
He has a feeling the Malfoy conundrum spells a whole lot of sleepless nights ahead.
Parvati looked strangely sad and forlorn as she glanced away. "Goodnight, Harry."
Harry grinned. It wasn't a no.
"Not well. I realised I'd seen them around a few times out on the scene."
"Sure thing, sir," Harry said, hoping his voice didn't sound as strangled as it felt.
"Okay, you can read now."
Draco groaned, his hands flying up to Harry's hips, gripping tight. "I'll call you whatever the hell you want, just don't stop."
want a Master (or to be one, for that matter), but having somebody to take care of him, to cherish him… well, Harry could maybe see the appeal in that. He thought of Emily and how happy and carefree she looked, sitting cross-legged on the floor surrounded by pretty dolls, the way her face had lit up with uncomplicated joy when she showed off their outfits to her Daddy who praised them and her both. It made Harry's belly squirm and wriggle, hot with envy and want and shame.
"No," Harry said, cutting him off. "That sounds, erm, really nice."
"A draw." Draco wrinkled his nose. "What an anti-climax."
Parvati chewed her lower lip and tugged at the end of her plait, her expression a mixture of worry and guilt. "I know you're a good Auror, Harry, I didn't mean to imply otherwise." She paused, clearly weighing her next words carefully. Already Harry felt a surge of anger at Parvati and the way she always seemed to be walking on eggshells around him like he was an exploding cauldron ready to go off at any moment. Did she really think so poorly of him? "Surely you can understand why Foley's different from the criminals we caught as Aurors back home. With your… history, it's only natural that it would feel more personal. Fathi's just being cautious. We need to know what Foley knows and what she has planned. We can't risk losing her."
Harry snorted and settled into the bed next to Draco. Draco tugged and Harry let his body be manipulated until he was lying on his side with Draco's body plastered against him, his chest hot against Harry's bare back. Harry sighed happily; he loved being the little spoon.
His fingers twitched towards his wand with the desire to curse the wizards currently trying to bring down the shield, but as much as he wanted a good fight, his first priority was getting everybody out of the hospital safely. The operatives inside had their plans for evacuation, as did the lead Healers on every floor, but some of the patients would need extra assistance, and Harry knew they could use some extra hands, especially if there were Dark witches and wizards loose inside. Other members of the resistance had already arrived and had begun duelling with Foley's disciples, and he trusted them to manage the situation. He was certain there were more inside, attacking people who were vulnerable.
"Comfortable?"
next to both of those activities, hoping he wouldn't be somehow disappointing Draco. It was a slightly crushing thought, but Draco had told him to be thorough and honest, and Harry took him at his word. It wouldn't do either of them any good if Harry was anything other than entirely truthful, as difficult as that was already shaping up to be.
Malfoy seemed reluctantly impressed at the forethought, which probably shouldn't have made Harry feel as warm and tingly as it did. His cheeks flushed as he activated the Portkey, and a moment later the both of them were stumbling into Harry's bed.
Now that he was looking for it, he made out the shimmering grey of the shield spell they used for victims that were dead on arrival. Was that where Draco was? He moved towards the bubble as if in a trance, but Robards grabbed hold of his arm stilling him and shaking his head.
Remorse flickered across Draco's expression. "I'm sorry, Harry. I knew you were struggling with this at the start, but you'd taken so well to the ageplay I hadn't realised it was still weighing so heavily on you."
Harry frowned. He wanted to protest and beg Draco to stay longer, insist that Draco let Harry suck his dick. But a glance at the clock told Harry it was already ten, and Harry didn't want to be the reason Draco wasn't at his best tomorrow. Their jobs were too dangerous not to take them seriously. Besides, Draco had given him a lot to think about, and there would hopefully be plenty more chances for Harry to suck Draco off in the future.
such a thing as too big, and Harry's dick, unfortunately, seemed to have crossed that loathed threshold.
—before the support beam he had his back up against exploded, sending shrapnel flying through the air and causing a large chunk of the ceiling to come crashing down right on top of Harry.
"Problem?" he said again, this time more gently, unable to entirely pull off his earlier bravado.
played on a loop in his head. Draco was why Harry was doing this, the reason why he was here. He had to make the world safe again, safe for the people he loved. Draco was his guiding star, his guardian angel.
"Oh, Harry." Draco's hands twitched as if he wanted to reach out and touch, but they stayed folded in his lap. "You're not weird or a freak, and liking kink doesn't even make you all that different. There are a lot of people who are into various aspects of kink and BDSM—it just feels like there aren't that many of us because it's not something we really talk about publicly." He growled, clearly frustrated, though it became obvious as he continued that it was directed at himself, not Harry. "Another way I've fucked this up. I should have introduced you to the community straight away instead of keeping you all to myself. I was worried it would be too much, that it would overwhelm you and scare you off, but it left you feeling isolated and alone instead. If you'd like, I could bring you along to our next munch and you could meet some other people in the lifestyle. Maybe talk to a few other subs about their experiences."
"I know. And we will. I… I like you, Draco. A hell of a lot more than I ever thought I would. I'd like to continue getting to know you, but I know there's going to be a point where we can't move forward until we address our past. Just… not tonight. Tonight I want to get our coffees for takeaway and take the long way walking you home."
"They're lists of potential kinks. I have the one I've used in the past with partners, with a list of kinks more generally associated with the BDSM community. The second list is a little more specialised to the Daddy/little dynamic we've discussed. I'd like you to go through them both and indicate whether you're interested, not interested, or unsure. Take your time going through it, really think about your responses. There's no right or wrong answer, but it'll hopefully help you narrow down what you think you might like and provide me with an idea of how I can give it to you. Once you've finished filling them out you can owl them to me and, if you'd like, I can start planning an official scene."
A faint whimper caught his ear and brought him to a stop. He could still hear the frantic shouting up ahead, the sound of a battle, and of somebody leading others to an exit, perhaps. It seemed as if whoever was helping to evacuate had already swept through this corridor, but there it was again, that sniffling cry. Harry cautiously made his way towards the only door that wasn't thrown entirely open.
So he followed Draco down the hall and into the guest bedroom with a broad grin of delight, and Draco gave him a fond, indulgent smile as he gestured inside the room. On the bed was an outfit made up of primary colours of the kind Harry remembered Dudley wearing when they were both wee. The shorts were bright red, and the shirt was white with a print of brightly coloured trains. There were a pair of trainers to go with, pristine white with three velcro straps instead of laces in red, yellow, and blue. It was quite Muggle, and undeniably an outfit made for a little boy, though everything looked to be about Harry's size. Harry's throat grew tight and he looked helplessly at Draco.
Harry let out a strange little cry he'd not known he was capable of, like the shriek of a mortally wounded animal. "Then how do you know who was even in there? Maybe he got out! Maybe he's—"
"How could I ever give this up?" Harry asked after he'd somewhat recovered, brushing a kiss across Draco's sweaty forehead as he eased out and reached for his wand to clean them off.
healed and doesn't infringe upon your… quality time with Granger this weekend."
"Woah," Malfoy said, stepping forward and placing a strong arm around Harry's waist. Harry might have normally bristled at the implication that he was about to pass out like some Victorian maiden, but Malfoy's arm felt quite nice wrapped around him and his knees
"The Auror Department has put out some feelers, too," Harry said quietly. There'd been rumours for months, but last week they'd finally made an official announcement. They were asking for volunteer troops from the Aurors, Unspeakables, and Hit Wizards to
Of course, that was before Harry was forced to work with him day in and day out, forced to listen to his keen insight, forced to watch him competently unravel the most complex of curses, forced to stare at his stupid shiny hair as it gleamed beneath the Ministry's overhead lights. He'd tried to stay away from Malfoy, really he had, but it was hardly his fault if the Ministry all but dropped him in Harry's lap like an incredibly attractive, spiky present, ripe for obsessing over. Harry liked to think he was pretty good at his job, but it was made infinitely more difficult when Draco bloody Malfoy had him all wound up and twisted into knots.
"That's one good thing at least. They're fairly certain they managed to capture all of the people who came to break Foley out. We'd assumed they'd split their force more evenly between the distraction and the rescue mission, but the bulk of her base came here to provide a bigger distraction—made it easier for Fathi and the others at the Manor to nab them, but we weren't prepared for the level of devastation here." She shuddered, grief deepening the lines in her face as she wiped a dirty palm across her damp cheek. "It would have been so much worse without our preparations, but…"
"Ron," Harry said in protest, his tone pleading; he really hated St Mungo's. They always made a Hippogriff out of a Snidget. But Ron wasn't having any of it, just gave him the

hasn't written about it, of course—they've always been quite England-centric and never ones to stick their neck out, but I subscribe to a number of European wizarding newspapers, and it doesn't look good."
He'd thrown himself into his work over the past few days, glad that he had something to focus all of his attention on. Every spare moment when he hadn't been absorbed by work was spent obsessing over his plans for tomorrow night, and there was only so much of that he could take before he exploded. He was already vibrating with excitement and anxiety as it was, wondering if he should confirm his reservation with the restaurant tomorrow for the third time as he walked from the Portkey station to his office,
"I did recognise him. It took me a minute, as I wasn't expecting it, but I've… seen him and Emily around before."
All at once all the anger and pain that had been fueling him for the past few hours, for the past few
That was a relief. He pushed himself up off of Draco almost reluctantly, feeling quite clingy. "What time is it, anyhow?"
With a white-hot burst of pleasure, Harry's climax overwhelmed him. He arched deeper into Draco's throat before finally collapsing on the bed, languid and sated.
Harry laughed, grabbing his wand with his clean hand and casting a gentle
"I'm feeling great."
Draco turned to leave and Harry was filled with a strange surge of panic. He didn't want to be alone. "No, wait!" he called out. Draco turned around, his expression somewhat alarmed, and Harry continued in a small voice, "Will you stay with me while I change?"
"What's the word?" he asked Imogen as he joined her at the door, bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet.
"Merlin, I want to fuck you," Draco groaned into Harry's ear, almost like he'd read Harry's mind.
Harry's stupid cheeks grew warm of their own volition, and he forced himself not to wriggle in his seat. "Yeah, uh." He coughed, his cheeks growing brighter as he averted his gaze. "I liked it."
By Sunday morning, though, Harry knew he'd avoided the issue long enough. It was probably time to figure some shit out. Because it was looking increasingly like Harry might have a bit of a
Parvati grimaced in response to Harry's question and his heart sank, though he wasn't surprised that Foley hadn't given anything up. Dark Lords (and Ladies) tended to be arrogant and proud. She wouldn't bow and scrape before them, no matter what they offered her.
Harry grinned at his Healer, clearly much happier to see Malfoy than Malfoy was to see Harry.

Harry pictured Draco as he'd been the last time he'd seen him, right before Harry had left for Berlin. He'd tsked over the sorry state of Harry's robes,

"Oh, I don't mind, I can come here. Even overworked Healers get breaks—I asked your supervisor—accommodating bloke Healer Chen. I can bring you dinner, do you like Indian? I know this place that makes an
and get rid of the evidence of his apparent loss of sense and reason. The thought of Draco actually reading through the lists and seeing what Harry had written, knowing the wicked things Harry dreamed about… It was enough to make Harry's skin break out in a cold sweat.
"All right, this way," Harry said, shaking off the despair trying to choke him as he took off down the corridor. He'd made extensive study of the hospital's floorplans over the past several days and he knew where the closest exit was. Hopefully the way would be clear, as the air was already growing uncomfortably warm as smoke began to fill the hallways. He could hear Cara following behind him, her breaths slightly laboured as Sean whimpered in her arms. He wanted to turn and offer his assistance, but he knew she'd rebuff any attempts to take Sean from her, no matter how heavy the boy got; it wasn't worth the wasted time, not when they had so little of it left. He did cast a few charms to clear the air of smoke, hoping to make breathing a little easier. Unfortunately, given how fast they were moving, the charms weren't useful for long before he needed to cast another, and casting spell after spell was a drain on his magic when he needed to stay sharp in case something bigger and nastier came at them.
"Good night, Parvati."
He emerged from the library several hours later, overwhelmed and slightly dazed. There'd been
"You," Harry began, "are being

Harry Potter) he tended to get his wish. Much to Malfoy's obvious dismay.
Something must have alerted Draco to Harry's presence in the doorway because he looked up, a soft smile dancing across his lips as he met Harry's gaze. His gaze darted down to Harry's hands and his smile brightened.
one. The coward Harry had known back at Hogwarts would have gladly grasped hold of a chance to bury his past wrongdoings and pretend everything was sunshine and daisies. But this Draco understood that there was no way forward in denial.
"I'm going back in," Harry said, knowing he couldn't just stand there watching guard doing
His blanket dismissal had apparently prevented Harry from ever realising that there was more to kink than the more extreme S&M aspects that pop culture always seemed to focus on; there was a softer, gentler side. Harry most emphatically did
Harry perked up. He'd been planning to work his way through the towering backlog of paperwork that was balancing precariously on the edge of his desk, but working a case sounded much more interesting. The paperwork could wait.
Something crashed across the room, sending a cascade of bright sparks flying up into the air. It was difficult to see through the smog, but it sounded like there might still be people fighting. Harry wasn't sure if he was imaging the flash of coloured spells in the distance or if it was just the light catching strangely on a stray spark of flame.
"Yeah, that's true…" he said slowly. "I suppose I should look into that."
"Fuck," Draco muttered, rubbing a hand across his face. "We shouldn't do this right now. You're injured."
"Goldstein owled in this morning, which means the case he and his partner were working on will need to be put on hold for the time being." Harry swallowed, realising what Robards was intending the moment before he continued, "Why don't you go ahead and take Malfoy with you, he should be free today."
. It'll make me feel better, promise."
Harry smiled, unburdened for the first time in months, and closed his eyes.
Parvati sighed. "Yeah, I know," she said grudgingly. "And we haven't heard from Kelly in over a week. He was supposed to check in three days ago." She gnawed on her lip, her expression filled with worry. Kelly was an undercover agent they'd placed in Lady Foley's ranks months ago. He was a thorough bloke, and a double-agent missing a check-in was never a good sign.
was at work, and lately Harry wanted to spend as much time with him as he could, even if they weren't actually partnered and didn't get more than the odd break together.
Harry's cheeks grew red-hot as his gaze flickered between Draco and the colouring book. He wasn't an idiot, and based on Draco's nerves and the keen way he was watching Harry's reactions, this was… maybe not a test, exactly, but certainly not as innocent as Draco was making it sound. Something had given Harry away, had made Draco think that what they'd witnessed between Emily and Graham was something Harry could be interested in. He hadn't realised his absorption and curiosity had been so obvious, though clearly it hadn't been so obvious as to make Draco certain Harry would react positively to a more frank discussion. In classic Slytherin fashion, Draco had opted for the more subtle approach, offering out the bait and leaving the Quaffle in Harry's hands.
Draco's jaw clenched. "I'm not saying we should ignore what's happening over there—I'm certainly not doing that myself. But pretending nothing's happening and going over to fight aren't the only options! There are other ways to help, to get involved. You could volunteer at the relief organisation with me if you wanted. They need more than just Healers, you know."
Harry swallowed loudly. "Final activity?"
It didn't take long before Draco was doing the same to him, undoing Harry's jeans and fishing out Harry's dick. He took hold of Harry with a firm, confident grip that made Harry shiver and fumble as he pawed at Draco's trousers, pleasure making him clumsy. But he was determined not to be shown up, so he grit his teeth against the desire to melt back against the door and let Draco have his way with him, and plunged his hand into Draco's pants, grabbing hold of Draco's hot, hard length. He felt amazing, so thick and silky-smooth, and Harry desperately wanted to get a good look at him, to see if he was as big as he felt. But Harry wasn't willing to give up Draco's lips or the feeling of his body smashed up against Harry's own, so he'd have to save a proper look for another time.
ringing in his ears, it was hard to pretend that there wasn't maybe some kind of sexual component to this whole ageplay thing, after all. Harry wasn't sure he was ready to face that, ready to face what it meant, what it said about him that he could want Draco to call him his sweet, precious boy while Harry rode Daddy's cock. Maybe that was fine for other people, maybe some could get off on it and think it was no big deal, but Harry wasn't sure if that was him; he didn't know if he could handle it at all.
Draco cleared his throat, his expression eager and sheepish. "Yes." He gestured towards the classier book with the geometric pattern. "That one's an adult colouring book. Apparently they're all the rage these days. I saw it at Flourish & Blotts earlier this week, and I thought you might enjoy it. It's supposed to be a good way to… de-stress."
But he wasn't ready to share Draco with the world, not right now. He knew Blaise was still good friends with Draco and would be one of the least likely people to judge their relationship, but telling Blaise before he'd even told Ron and Hermione didn't sit right with him. He and Draco were still figuring things out, and he should probably have a conversation with Draco to determine what exactly their relationship
Draco's eyebrows rose, and Harry flushed as he shoved a spoonful of tiramisu in his mouth. No need to get into how closely Harry watched Draco back at Hogwarts just yet. His eyes widened as he took a bite; Draco wasn't kidding, it
"It's okay if you do," Draco said earnestly. "Like I've told you, it's not something
Harry's rhythm faltered at the sudden burst of pleasure, and Draco gave him a smug little grin, his fists twisting along Harry's shaft. Harry's size didn't seem to negatively affect Draco's technique as he wanked Harry off with expert precision; he would have brought Harry to his knees if he weren't already on them, sliding up and down Draco's dick.
Parvati nodded. "And undisclosed Veritaserum in her tea. Fathi's… not happy about it. Says it feels dishonourable, but—" She shrugged and grimaced. "I was up half the night with him talking about various options, and we both agreed it would likely be the only course of action."
He didn't want to see his own fears reflected back at him.
A sick feeling of dread filled him when no bubble appeared on the horizon, but its absence could have meant any number of things. Harry wasn't sure when the attack happened—perhaps they'd already cleared off all of the victims. Or maybe the Aurors were so busy containing the situation that they'd broken protocol and hadn't cast the charm. Or perhaps the smoke that was still stinging Harry's eyes was somehow blinding him to its location.
Draco leaned over and brushed a kiss against Harry's cheek before passing over the sections of the paper he'd already read through. They'd been dating for over a year and had moved in together less than a month ago. It was long enough to develop lazy weekend morning routines together, but not so long that the routines didn't still fill Harry with a little thrill. For as long as Harry could remember, all Harry had wanted was a partner to share his life with, somebody who he could lean on and who could lean on him, somebody to be by his side through highs and lows and the exquisite mundanity in between. He'd never have thought he'd find that partner in Draco Malfoy, but life was funny like that sometimes.
Draco's eyes went wide, and Harry didn't miss the distended bulge of his erection tenting his trousers. Still, he hesitated, the noble bastard. "Best practice still dictates no strenuous activity for twenty-four hours post-Healing spell," he said, sounding like he was reciting from memory, which he probably was.
"Of course not. This is definitely a good stopping point for today. Why don't you change and then meet me in my room? It'll be more comfortable for us to talk there."
Blood rushed through Harry's ears and his vision went red. He understood now why Fathi had been hesitant.
?" Draco asked, his grim tone immediately setting Harry on edge. They generally dismissed the
"Fuck, you were brilliant out there," Harry said, his lips sliding across Draco's sweat-damp skin. Draco shivered, as much from the feel of Harry's mouth against his neck as from the pride in Harry's voice.
But Draco wanted to know Harry's deepest held fantasies so he could work on making them a reality for Harry. He wanted to give Harry a gift, give him a chance to explore the desires he'd buried so deep he'd barely even known they were there. Harry
"So they're coming here?" Parvati said, her eyes wide. "When?"
—"caretaker and want to find a proper sub to be with, somebody who likes all the same things you do and doesn't need you babying them all the time?"
He cupped Harry's face, sliding his thumb back and forth along Harry's cheekbone as he stepped in close, pressing Harry back against his front door.
"Fuck!" Harry shouted as Draco bit Harry's nipple. He looked down and Draco raised an eyebrow in question. Harry flushed and nodded, and Draco gave him a cat-who-got-the-cream smile before dragging his teeth over the other nipple.
"You were lovely," Draco said softly, his tone almost awed. "I've never seen you look so carefree, so… unburdened." He hesitated, his hand momentarily stuttering in its path along Harry's back before resuming. "I could tell, when you looked at me, that you were seeing me through your pre-Hogwarts mind, without all the baggage and history between us. I hadn't realised how powerful that would be, for you to see me not as Draco Malfoy, but as your"—Draco hesitated again—"caretaker."
As close as Harry was himself, the extra stimulation from Draco clenching around him was enough to put him over the edge. He came deep inside Draco's arse, burying his face in Draco's neck as he trembled through his climax. Draco held him through it, his own body clenching and releasing as he worked through the aftershocks.
"Losing access to Lady Foley's inner circle will be a blow," Harry said grimly, reaching the same conclusion that Parvati had; Kelly was likely already dead. Parvati frowned at Harry's somewhat heartless assessment of the situation—yes, it would be tragic for Kelly's friends and family if he'd been murdered, but Harry was neither a friend nor family, and he'd lost enough people in his life to have learned the ability to compartmentalise when he needed to. "I know Byrne has been making the rounds through the underground duelling circuits, trying to get noticed by Foley and her followers, but until then…"
In the not-even-five-minutes he'd been by the entrance, the integrity of the building seemed to have further disintegrated. Fires popped and crackled everywhere as the walls moaned ominously. He did his best to ignore it as he checked the rooms and made his way further inside. It was difficult to hear anything specific in the din, but eventually sounds began to isolate themselves: shouted spells, jeering taunts, and there, up ahead, the bright flash of spell work.
"Err, do you mind if I change?" Harry asked, somewhat awkwardly.
He opened his mouth to say something suggestive but he looked down before he could speak and realised he was still dressed up in the clothes Draco had got for him. It wasn't exactly an outfit that inspired the kinds of sexy thoughts Harry wanted Draco to be thinking right now.
Malfoy's eyes widened further, his pupils dilating as he unconsciously licked his lips. It sent a throb of arousal straight through Harry, which was impressive considering the pain radiating out from his side. Harry played his final card.
With all of that baggage, did Harry really want to add another layer of complication into the mix? He wasn't even really sure what he was feeling and, given how off-kilter and confused he was just
A knock on his door drew Harry's attention away from the letter he was writing to Draco, and he fought off a scowl at the interruption as he called for whoever it was to come in. Parvati edged open the door, her expression a mixture of caution and tempered excitement.
"Robards," Harry called out, striding over to him. Robards looked at him in sudden surprise before his expression changed, and the look of gentle compassion on his normally gruff, stony face made Harry stumble. Robards caught him before he fell, his hand a large, heavy weight on Harry's shoulder.
It turned out, losing wasn't that bad. As Harry stretched out on his bed at Grimmauld Place, the delicious benefits became clear. He groaned with pleasure as Draco's mouth drew exquisite pleasure from his body.
had gone a long way towards changing Harry's feelings towards Draco. After three years of training together, they were something almost like friends. In the six years since, that friendship had grown and evolved into something a little different, as Harry realised his appreciation for Draco's sharp smile and strong shoulders and broad hands was a little more than friendly.
Despite expecting the sight, Harry's heart still leapt when he walked into his bedroom and saw Draco Malfoy in his bed. He was sitting up and leaning back against the headboard, his brow furrowed as he read the newspaper spread out over his legs. The bright morning sun shone in through the open curtains, giving the whole scene a light, ethereal quality. Draco looked like an angel, not that Harry was foolish enough to tell him that. In the tree just outside the window, the family of goldfinches that had made their nest there chirped merrily, and Harry smiled as he watched the bobbing heads of the recently-hatched chicks vying for food and attention from their parents.
They both groaned in unison as Draco filled Harry up. These first few moments always took Harry's breath away, and he gasped as he relaxed into the pleasurable burn. Above him, Draco's eyes glittered, his mouth slack with pleasure as his hips pressed up against Harry's arse. He held himself there for several moments while his hands found Harry's and moved them up by Harry's head, pressing them down against the mattress, holding him there.

Draco's sigh contained multitudes that Harry couldn't possibly parse out.
"All right, Harry?" Parvati asked, leaning in and lowering her voice so that only Harry could hear.
really hit all of Harry's buttons these days, but there was a very
, and it seemed like Draco was on the exact same page.
Draco raised a single eyebrow, an amused smile playing about his lips. Harry swallowed as he pressed his chair back from the desk and licked his lips. Draco's gaze darted down to Harry's mouth, and Harry's hands gripped his armrests in an effort to restrain himself from leaping up and kissing Draco breathless. Fuck, he didn't know how he was going to survive an entire day of this.
"I know," she said with a sigh. "I've been pressing Fathi about it, but you know how he gets. Not one to be proactive, him."
The villa was lavish and far too large for just one wizard, but Harry hadn't really expected anything less from Blaise. He'd felt a bit decadent claiming the massive main bedroom for himself, but it wasn't as if there was anybody else with him who'd get better use of it. As soon as he settled in he'd sent an owl to Ron and Hermione telling them where he was and not to worry, and then he'd immediately gone out exploring, hoping that keeping himself busy would distract him from the churning in his gut.
Harry smiled shyly, overcome with a sudden surge of gratefulness. Not only had Draco organised a scenario in which Harry could experiment relatively consequence-free, but Harry hadn't failed to notice that one of the colouring books was very clearly meant for children. The choice really was entirely up to Harry; Draco would take his cues from whichever book Harry reached for.
Imogen nodded. Harry was sure that if Parvati had been there she would have fought him, would have had more to say, but Imogen didn't know Harry as well as Parvati did, and this was
"So," Draco began somewhat nervously. "I assume the whole Daddy kink thing I introduced has something to do with your flight from Britain?"
Draco's eyes were already glazed over with lust, but he still managed a confident quirk of his lips, that same cocksure smile that always made Harry's stomach do flips.
made Harry feel awkward and oddly exposed. Draco had emphasised that there was nothing shameful or bad about Harry's desires, but he couldn't help the small voice inside him that insisted this was, if not outright wrong, then still weird and freakish. But his trust in Draco and his desire to rediscover the peace he'd felt on Friday was great enough to override that voice. For now.
"What do you like for prep? Do you prefer me to really work you open, get you writhing on four of my fingers so I can just slide my dick right in? Or are you the kind of bloke who likes to
"We can't, of course, completely discount the possibility, but I've been able to verify the information from a number of sources and believe it to be genuine. I wasn't directly informed—as you say, I'm not sufficiently high enough in Lady Foley's estimation to warrant such a confidence—but I
Draco clutched Harry more firmly, one hand in his hair and one tight around his waist as he growled, "Gladly," before the twist of Apparition took hold and they appeared in the middle of the villa's main bedroom where Harry had been staying.
Draco's smile widened as he gave Harry a slow once-over. "I can think of worse ways to spend the day."
It had taken quite a while before Harry realised he wasn't the only one feeling that way, and even longer for him to actually do something about it. Harry couldn't deny that he wanted Draco, but he still wasn't entirely convinced that dating him was a good idea. He wasn't sure a relationship between them could ever really work. It had taken a lot of hard work to get him and Draco to a place of friendship instead of animosity, and though Harry had seen first-hand the strides Draco had made to become a better person, Harry still struggled with his feelings for him. It was one thing to believe that Draco wasn't the hateful, bigoted child he'd once been and decide he was worth befriending; it was another thing entirely to want him so desperately, knowing all the terrible things he'd done. It was something Harry was truthfully still coming to terms with, just as he knew Draco was still working on making peace with his own past while figuring out how to atone for his sins and build a new future for himself. Draco had his own reasons to be wary, to be cautious of a romantic entanglement with the
"Yeah…" Harry breathed, overwhelmed. "I… I never got to wear cool stuff like this when I was a kid. I think my Aunt tried to find the ugliest and most boring clothes she could at the charity shops." He fingered the pattern on the shirt, marvelling at its softness. "I've always liked trains."
"Yeah, I got that from my research. It was a little overwhelming," Harry admitted. "It helped confirm that the colouring thing wasn't an isolated incident, but…" Harry ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "I couldn't help but notice that we don't… well, we don't really fit the image of any of the couples I saw."
," before pulling out of Harry's suddenly slack mouth and wanking himself fast and hard until he came into the palm he had cupped over the head of his dick.
He didn't have the luxury of holding back, though, not when
"No!" Harry immediately protested, horrified that Draco might think that Harry was anything other than blissfully, ecstatically happy with him. "No, that's not it at all. I can't remember the last time I was so happy. That's part of what gets to me. How can I be so happy here with you, living my life practically without a care in the world, as if I'm unaware of what's happening over there, that in Ireland people are being robbed of this same happiness?"
Harry shook his head, the idea patently ridiculous. Sure, he'd found Draco's presence comforting and commanding—safe, even—while he'd been "playing" but the feelings he had for Draco right now were very much not of the kind Harry had felt for the parental figures in his life.
"I do
"Now that we've finished eating, I thought we could move on to another activity while we watched the television."
Harry's entire body grew warm from the praise, but he was too relaxed and content to feel embarrassed or self-conscious about the implications of Draco's statement. Harry had already admitted to being interested in things a lot more damning than being bossed around in bed.
" said a smooth, feminine voice from the Healer's pin on Malfoy's robes. Malfoy frowned.
"So, err," he began, when the silence stretching between them began to grow awkward. "What made you realise Graham and Emily had that kind of relationship?"
Which was one of the many benefits of pub nights, when Harry got to spend time with a slightly wider friend group and remembered he wasn't the only one unmarried and without children, that he wasn't behind schedule or missing out. Harry always left the pub feeling energised and happy, reminded of how much he genuinely loved spending time with his friends. He was forever resolving to be better about staying in touch, but somehow time always managed to get away from him.
Draco's eyes flashed, and for a moment it looked like he might argue, but eventually he gave a jerky nod. "But we
Harry nodded and held out his hand. Taking statements wasn't as exciting as taking down an illegal potions ring, but it was necessary work. And, more importantly, it was still more interesting than filling out case forms.
"It is," Fathi said with a grimace. His expression grew hesitant, concerned, which was a disconcerting look on Fathi's normally severe and uncompromising face. "Listen, Harry, why don't I work with Parvati on containment for the attack. You can take charge of coordinating the efforts here to guard Foley and ensure she doesn't escape."
"I'm definitely… interested in experimenting with other things, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that just yet."
He took the open seat next to Harry while Harry exchanged an amused glance with Blaise. "I hear you've got a question for me?"
"Tell him—" She broke off and cleared her throat, looking away and blinking rapidly, as if she'd caught something in her eye. When she turned back to face him there was a bright, brittle smile on her face. "Tell him I say hello, will you?"
Draco shook his head emphatically. "Not for me." He paused, biting his lip before continuing in a hopeful tone, "Next time?"
Harry took a deep breath, calming the anger and instinctive desire to lash out that was usually his go-to when mortified. It was awkward feeling so vulnerable, particularly in front of Draco, a person who, historically, had not been someone Harry could have ever trusted with something so intimate. But Draco wasn't laughing at him, wasn't looking for ways to shame or hurt him. In fact, there was something equally exposed in Draco's anxious gaze and bitten bottom lip as he waited for Harry's reaction. Yes, this was new and strange and a little uncomfortable, but Harry had been filled with these confusing, yearning thoughts all week now, unsure what he wanted or how to go about getting it. And here Draco was, offering him an easy way to test things out. There didn't have to be anything more to it if Harry didn't want there to be.
Grimmauld Place, being a thoroughly wizarding house, didn't have access to the internet, and the only place he could think of with free access to both computers and the internet were public libraries. It hardly seemed like the done thing, to use the library computer for kinky research purposes, but Harry was getting desperate. He could always cast a (very subtle) Privacy Charm to ensure he wasn't caught and thrown out for being some kind of pervert.
"It's not your fault," Harry protested. Draco shouldn't have to bear the blame for Harry being such a freak. "I'm the one who can't even handle a stupid colouring book without acting like I'm five." His stomach squirmed at the admission, the hot flush of shame causing him to avert his eyes. It had just felt so
"That's all I ask, Harry," Draco said as he leaned back against the loveseat and crossed one leg over the other. "That, and that you keep talking to me. As long as we keep a healthy line of communication, we can work anything out."
Harry pouted and Malfoy let out an amused huff. "No worries, Weasley. I'll make sure this one is
"You want it?" he teased, and Harry nodded, too turned on to play coy. Draco's smile was pleased as he leaned in, brushing his lips against Harry's ear and whispering, "I want it too," as he began to push inside.
Blaise rolled his eyes. "Mmhmm. Nobody here believes that story, not even your unobservant Gryffindor friends."
"Are you done colouring, Harry?" he asked softly. "Are you ready to come up?"
Harry looked over at him, his eyes wide. "Really? That… that sounds perfect, actually."
Draco let out a pleased, fond laugh as he pressed up off of Harry and settled back on his haunches, his arse rubbing against Harry's cock. He muttered a Lubrication Charm, but instead of coating his own cock with the slick handful, he reached back and slathered the lube over Harry's. Harry's eyes widened as Draco's knuckles bumped against Harry's erection, as Draco then spread the slick along his own arsehole before grabbing hold of Harry's dick and holding it steady as he pushed up onto his knees.

by cleaning Grimmauld Place from top to bottom until he was a sweaty, exhausted mess, well, his house
"Right, well, shall we knock then?"
"Don't know what you're talking about, mate," Harry said innocently when it became clear Blaise wasn't giving up without an answer. "Nothing to tell."
"No, but we already knew things were getting worse," Draco said with a grimace. "I've been working for weeks offering medical care to the refugees coming in from Ireland. There haven't been all that many so far, but the numbers are increasing."
Draco grinned, pure pleasure beaming out of him. "That's all right. It took me years to really accept myself, and I know it's not some spell you can cast and, swish and flick, it's done. Just promise not to run away next time and talk to me instead."
Harry stared at Draco with wide eyes, shocked by his passion and agitation. They'd talked about the war extensively, had rehashed every moment, brought every ugly truth to light until there wasn't a secret between them. Harry knew how much Draco had changed, how deeply he'd looked inside of himself, how far down he'd reached to pull out the very roots of his prejudice. It wasn't perfect, or complete; it was something he worked at every day, combating the bias he'd been raised with. But Harry hadn't ever heard of him speak like this, of the role the greater wizarding world and society had played in creating the kind of environment that allowed somebody like Voldemort to grow and thrive. Voldemort hadn't existed in a vacuum. In many ways, he was a reflection of the darker underpinnings of wizarding society, an unwelcome mirror that exaggerated and distorted the prejudice that existed in the hearts of all witches and wizards.
five-year-old. The Dursleys certainly hadn't stocked his cupboard under the stairs with any colouring books.
It was immediately clear that Harry was trapped, helplessly pinned by the heavy chunk of ceiling lying across his lower half. The shock of it left Harry stunned, and already Harry could feel his strength leaving him; he wasn't sure if he could still feel his legs. His wand had tumbled out of his hand when he fell and lay uselessly a good ten feet away, well out of his reach. Harry was decent at wandless magic, but it required an immense amount of will and focus, and right that moment all of his body's energy was focused on the hunk of metal and cement crushing him to the ground.
, the way that nothing seemed to these days, now that Harry was surrounded by death and chaos.
Oh god,
"Okay, good, that's good," Draco said, clearly doing his best to sound encouraging and soothing, though Harry could hear the undercurrent of relief. "Liked it as in, it was fun to try as a one-off? Or liked it as in, you'd enjoy exploring that dynamic further?"
"We also don't know what kind of little you are—I doubt you'll be too bratty, but the Daddy Dom I spoke to about all of this has a boy who likes throwing tantrums. For him, it's part of the experience, as is the punishment that follows"—he flashed Harry a warning look that made his cheeks heat—"but it doesn't mean he wants the scene to end. Having a safe word makes all of that clearer."
teenage boys, all of whom seemed to agree that having a big dick was basically the best thing that could happen to a bloke. But Harry had quickly realised that, contrary to Seamus's emphatic assertions, there
"Yeah," Harry breathed, realising with a shock that he
"That's it," Draco said, his voice slightly unsteady and his tone pleased. "That's perfect. Just like that, my—"
Instead, Harry's gaze was drawn towards the blond-haired man walking slowly towards him, looking at Harry with that small, secret smile Harry knew by heart, the one he saw in his mind's eye whenever he pictured the man he loved.
"You're not the only one that can get in over their head. This experience is just as intense and emotional for me as it is for you, just in a different way. It is important we both have the means to quickly end a scene if it gets out of hand."
Harry made a face. More paperwork.
Harry nodded, not really sure how to respond. All this focus on
"Did you have a good nap?"
concert because they'd been so vocally critical of her war crimes."
Harry huffed out a laugh. "I know. And it's not like I'm dying to fight another war, or for us to be separated. I just feel like I
I thought you'd never ask! The key is both an un-activated Portkey that will take you to the edge of the property and a key to the wards and front door of the villa. The place is all yours until further notice—enjoy!
"That's brilliant. How long do you reckon?"
Harry laughed. "Much obliged."
"All right, enough about that," Harry said briskly, smiling gently at Draco when he looked up in surprise. "There'll be plenty of time to talk about all the fucked up complicated stuff in our pasts, and in the world, but let's save that for another night, yeah?"
Harry crept forward as inconspicuously as he could. Six of Foley's followers were duelling it out with three members of the resistance, though Harry couldn't tell who they were through the smoke. They were outnumbered and fighting against a foe who had nothing to lose, a dangerous combination. Harry gave himself just a moment to get a lay of the land and then he jumped into the fray, his anger coalescing into a singular instinct: to destroy.
The resistance had managed to determine the where of the attack—Leigheas Hospital of Magical Healing Arts—but there was no way to know
"Okay, great," Harry replied, his cheeks growing inexplicably hot. "In the meantime, we should probably discuss the actual case. You know, the reason why we were there interviewing Emily in the first place?"
She looked reprovingly at their de facto head strategist, Fathi Ayad, a handsome man in his forties, with glossy black hair, warm brown skin, and a sharp, eagle-eyed gaze that missed nothing. He'd been head of the Irish Auror Department before Lady Foley had taken over more than a year ago and promptly charged him—and several other of her high-ranking detractors—with treason. He'd only just escaped with his life, and he and several others started working full time to bring her down. From what Harry had seen over the past six months, Fathi seemed like a good man trying his best, but he was worn thin and growing weary. Harry didn't think Parvati was being entirely fair—no doubt Fathi understood an attack was coming but without solid intel there wasn't much he could do, and they didn't have the manpower to monitor all possible targets. Explaining that to Parvati wouldn't do much good though; Fathi and Parvati had been like oil and water from the start.
, and they both were well aware that everybody and their mother would have opinions to share if their relationship were to develop and become public knowledge.
Harry couldn't help but remember the sudden, terrifying move in the week before his seventeenth birthday, when he left the protection of his Aunt and Uncle's house early hoping to catch Voldemort off guard. It hadn't worked, of course, and all these years later it still hurt whenever he saw a snowy owl soaring through the sky, which was thankfully not often. His unique history meant he immediately understood Fathi's plan.
"She's agreed to speak with you," Graham said, once again addressing Draco. Harry might have been offended, but it was clear there was something going on here he didn't quite understand. "I'm sure I don't need to remind you that she's in a quite vulnerable state, so I'd ask you to be mindful of the way you phrase your questions. If you need more information, you're welcome to return later."
A whisper of those earlier nerves stole back across Draco's expression as he reached into the bag. Harry steeled himself, Draco's anxiety setting him on edge. Draco placed the items on the table as he withdrew them: two large, slim books, one decorated with a bright and intricate geometric design that swirled and glimmered, and one with cartoon renderings of magical creatures; and a box of what appeared to be coloured pencils and crayons. Harry's brow furrowed.
"You always look so lovely on your knees for me," Draco murmured reverently. One of his hands slid out of Harry's hair and he ran the back of his knuckles along Harry's cheekbone. "But you look especially fetching tonight, my sweet boy."
Robards's face creased with a subtle grimace. "I'd say you're more than equal to the task on your own, but the higher-ups have been on my arse lately about not sending anybody out alone after what happened with Jenkins." He ran a hand over his face, his brow furrowed as he seemed to mentally flick through the list of available Aurors.
"I hadn't planned on disciplining you tonight, but perhaps we're overdue," Draco mused. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco cut him off with a severe glance. "Don't argue, Harry. We've got to go or we'll be late." His expression softened as some of his earlier anxiety crept in. "I want to make a good impression."
, whom he missed most of all. His heart clenched painfully with longing, and he quickly focused back on Parvati.
been in need of a good scrub.
"Let's call the meeting."
Harry Summoned a quill and three sheets of parchment, penning a quick message and sending it off with Apocrypha and then sitting down to write the other two while he anxiously waited for a reply.
The resistance might have cut off the head of the monster, but they didn't yet know if Foley's party was a snake or a hydra. They'd captured most of Foley's inner circle as well but not all of them, and the last thing they wanted was for one of her followers to pop up and take Foley's now-empty throne. If Foley was anything like Voldemort, she wouldn't want that either, which might work to their advantage.
"Yes, please, do it."
"Would you like me to suck you off, Harry? Want me to put my mouth on you?"
I'm looking forward to it, Harry. I hope you are, too.
The rest of the meeting was strategic, Fathi outlining his tentative plans, taking note of volunteers and doling out assignments. It was just the start of what was bound to be a week's worth of planning, and Harry knew he'd be more involved in the sessions that got into the specifics of the battle plans, so he mostly sat back for now, bolstered by the enthusiasm of the room and the possibility of being so close to their goal.
"Right," Harry said with a grin. He didn't have to be told twice and quickly began to tug off his clothes. It hadn't even been a full week since they'd last had sex, but Harry was already desperate and keyed up. Harry had experienced
Three of Foley's guard hit the ground, immediately incapacitated, but the other six, and Foley herself, were all quicker on their feet, springing into action as they ducked and shielded themselves from the onslaught. Harry jumped eagerly into the fray, calling on all his old Auror training as he worked to subdue the enemy. Foley's guard encircled her, doing their best to create a barrier while she continued trying to create a Portkey and make her escape.
Before he could second-guess himself, he grabbed a partially bent quill from his junk drawer and penned a reply, inviting Draco over to Grimmauld Place for dinner that night. Harry enjoyed cooking and thought making a meal might help calm some of his nerves. He'd been planning a bacon and asparagus risotto—something nice and labour-intensive to occupy his mind—and he had plenty of ingredients for two.
"I do," Harry replied firmly before giving her a smile, showing there were no hard feelings. "But you're right, I should probably go to bed. I'd like to turn in early, but I owe Draco a letter. I'll go to sleep after that."
He had, because he mostly figured he'd be using the Portkeys when he was too exhausted to Apparate and thought the proximity to his bed would be ideal. He'd not foreseen this particular circumstance, in which Draco Malfoy would be travelling with him and thus
"There are a couple of people I think you'll really get on with; I should have broached the idea sooner. There's a munch next month, I'll get the details and let you know. Regardless of what we end up deciding, I really do think you should consider it. Even if you don't feel like pursuing kink right now, it can't hurt to speak with some people in the lifestyle other than me and get some other perspectives."
For now, he settled for offering Draco a mind-blowing fuck, screwing into him with the hard, deep strokes that he knew Draco preferred. Draco let out a series of gratifying moans in response, wrapping his arms and legs around Harry as he urged Harry down for another kiss. It was messy and wet, more a bumping of mouths than a proper snog, the both of them more focused on the pleasure of Harry thrusting in and out of Draco's body.
"He's doing the best he can, Parvati," Harry said wearily. They'd had this argument before, and Harry wasn't keen on being accused of taking his "side", not when they were all on the
Harry was used to following his instincts, and finding his inner child—whatever that meant—was what this whole afternoon was supposed to be about, so he listened to his gut. He turned around, grinning at Draco, a flash of pride going through him at Draco's pleased expression.
to do it?
"What?" Harry asked, distracted by the slide of his fingers opening himself up.
Harry sighed, relaxing into the sensation he'd grown to enjoy. It had been a long damned time since he'd experienced this with another person as opposed to using his own hands and toys, and he let himself enjoy the feeling of Draco's finger as it slid in deep. Draco had gorgeous fingers, long and dexterous, the kind of fingers Harry had imagined doing all kinds of filthy things to him. He thought he might enjoy it if Draco spent some time fingering him open until he begged for it, but not tonight. Tonight he was too damn keen to get Draco's dick inside him, and thankfully Draco seemed to be of a similar mind. He quickly slid in a second finger, pressing the lube inside of Harry and making sure he was nice and slick, his muscles suitably relaxed, before pulling out and settling on his knees between Harry's spread legs.
Harry's cheeks warmed at the gentle rebuke and he forced himself to ease up, to really savour the feeling and flavour of Draco's cock on his tongue. He looked up at Draco, not even realising that he was hoping for praise until Draco gave it to him.
"What have you got for me?"
Fair Game
Harry nodded, kissing his way up Draco's throat until he reached Draco's lips, sighing as their mouths met. He always seemed to have the horn after coming out of his littlespace, as if his adult side could think of no greater way to reassert itself than by getting off. Draco certainly never seemed to mind, always ready to give Harry whatever it was that he wanted.
He and Draco had been in the middle of a… a scene, with Draco reading him the book while Harry watched the magical rendering with fascination. At some point Harry must have fallen asleep. He wondered how long he'd been out for, and if he'd broken some kind of etiquette. Surely it wasn't on to just pass out while one was in the middle of playing. His cheeks warm, Harry shifted and looked up at Draco, who was awake and looking down at him, his eyes crinkling slightly as he smiled.
In a daze, Harry stepped aside and swung open the door, allowing Draco inside. Draco slid off his traveller's robes in one elegant motion, revealing the more form-fitting clothes beneath. Harry watched him hungrily, taking in the pull of his tailored shirt across his shoulders and the grace of his wrist as he sent his robes sailing towards the hook by the door. For all the mess in Harry's head, one thing he'd never questioned was how badly he wanted Draco, how right it felt being with him. Mere moments spent in his presence had already settled something in Harry's gut, a wash of peacefulness stealing over him, telling him that everything would be all right now that Draco was here.
"It's time for dinner. Put your toys away and meet me in the kitchen." Harry opened his mouth to protest, but quickly shut it at Draco's no-nonsense look. "No arguing. You can play some more after dinner."
"Later, sweetheart."
sex when he was like that. Something about it felt wrong, and no amount of telling himself otherwise seemed to diminish the shame writhing in his guts when he thought about it, so he just did his best not to.
He wanted everything to be perfect.
to you. It's hard work, and it's not fun or exciting, but it doesn't mean it's any less valuable or important."
Harry reluctantly pulled off. "Right now?"
Harry didn't see the Blasting Hex coming until it was too late.

; Harry never would have left him here otherwise. That had been Draco's whole bloody argument for staying in Britain and helping the war efforts at home instead of joining the front lines. He wasn't supposed to get hurt.
He wasn't sure how long he and Parvati sat there together outside the door to the dungeons, waiting for news. Long enough that Harry's arse went numb from forgetting to renew his Cushioning Charm. Long enough for several empty teacups to appear next to them both, drained on autopilot as they waited.
narrow window in which to make our move. And we'd need to be ready and waiting at the exact time and place where Lady Foley plans to take her Portkey."
Draco snorted. "No, not like that. You'll see soon enough. Just don't react, okay? I told Graham we'd be professionals, so try not be too weirded out about whatever we see. If you need me to, I can take point. I'm probably more familiar with this kind of thing, and I can explain things to you afterwards." Harry bristled at the insinuation, and Draco held up his hands in placation. "Sorry, I know I sound like a prick, but you'll understand in a minute. It'd be better if I had more time to explain, but we should probably get up there sooner rather than later. Trust me, okay?"
