“Perfect,” said Harry, and then he slid a couple of fingers in with a cool slickness. “Perfect,” he repeated, his voice cracking slightly.
When he arrived at number twelve the next morning, coffee in hand, Harry's heart couldn't decide whether to sink at the sight of Malfoy waiting for him – he'd wanted to get there first – or leap at the smile Malfoy gave him. It lurched and fluttered in his chest for a moment.
Henry swung closer on his broom, until he was near enough that Draco could see the stitches on the patches of his robes. “The bushy-faced one. Thrushbeard.”
Potter nodded, slowly. “I see… so for the charm to be effective, no one should touch it other than the Seeker?”
“I spoke to Hermione,” Harry said once he was seated. “I still don’t understand why neither of you told me what was going on.” Harry looked up at Draco. “I might have been able to help, and even if I couldn’t… it makes me see all our time together in a different light.”
"You shouldn’t throw away your apprenticeship," he said quietly. "That wand… it’s… I’ve never used a wand like it."
Parkinson then spent some time retrieving every single piece of glass from his skin, and healing every cut. Harry lay, immobile, as she steadily and methodically set about healing him, and his eyes found Malfoy. His skin was pale, so pale, and it was drawn tight as he watched. Harry closed his eyes again as Parkinson healed Harry's collarbone with an
Malfoy’s head shot round and he stared at Harry. “I knew it sometimes wasn’t there, but walking past it three times and wishing to make it appear didn’t work then, so I thought the magic was damaged, or slowly dying.”
“His collection was most impressive,” Malfoy said. “I especially approve of how everything is displayed.”
Blaise leant forward. “Don’t tell me that you and the Chosen Recluse are getting together to steal from Muggles?”
He knew he would have to talk to them, soon. It was growing uncomfortable, not being totally honest with his two best friends. Harry stashed the thought away; it would be OK, and he deserved a private life as much as they did. At this moment the thing he needed more than anything else was to see Draco.
Henry glanced up quickly. When he spoke, he was focused on the wheel again. “Thank you. I like it. I feel… peaceful when I’m doing this.”
"Oh for… pay attention, Potter. I want to examine your Floo connection next: it seems to be well maintained, unlike most other things here.".
Malfoy’s shoulders dropped a little, but then he pulled them straight again. “I’ve seen worse.” He reached out for the door handle.
Harry raised his eyebrows. Draco often yawned through Harry’s work talk, and sometimes would start a new conversation halfway through one of Harry’s sentences.
Draco dimly remembered Potter with a snowy white owl. Who knew what had happened to it. Potter did seem the type to become attached to an owl, then never manage to replace it. Whether out of laziness or sentimentality, Draco wasn’t sure. Maybe a little of both.
The walls were beginning to look like a white forest, with tree limbs growing up to the ceiling, meeting in sinuous and organic arches.
“The teashop doesn't close for ages, we've got time.” Harry realised that he wanted to have a bit more time to talk to Draco.
Draco as a sherbet lemon, wrapped in a twist of paper. The thought made Harry smile, and he was finally able to drift off to sleep.
“I would,” Draco said, his voice half-muffled from inside a cupboard. He sat back on his heels, peeled off one rubber glove, and wiped sweaty hair away from his eyes. He looked slightly debauched, all flushed and mussed up, as he sat back on his knees. “And anyway, I know they’re not coming here. I’m not doing this for them.”
What was he going to do? Was Hermione right, should he risk everything, risk this time sat together watching Countdown, or the quiet hour spent cooking each day? What if Draco rejected him? His brain stuttered to a halt when he tried to consider the alternative: when he tried to consider Draco feeling anything towards Harry other than prickly, slightly over-protective friendship.
Images raced through his mind: twisting stone lines growing and stretching, the changing shapes of blue and green glass, all interspersed with Malfoy’s bright eyes, Malfoy’s hand on his arm, Malfoy calling him ‘Harry’.
“Why not?” Malfoy looked up, but kept his hand resting gently on the wall. “It’s not like we have any other answers.”
As Harry approached the kitchen, he could already see that it was filled with cool, clear moonlight. He stopped just inside the doorway as he saw out the outline of someone standing by the kitchen window, and he swayed slightly as he realised that it was Malfoy.
As he worked on his Protean Charm though, he sometimes stole a glance over at Malfoy and wished… wished the distance between them was a little less. Malfoy moved his arms more when he was excited, and his eyes seemed brighter. Even though they were sitting apart again, Harry’s body remembered Malfoy’s warmth and his woody scent. He felt a small thrill at the back of his neck each time he remembered how his name had sounded when Malfoy had said it.
Which was why the words stuck in Harry’s throat when they had finished catching up on the past few days, and he had to say that he would be going away with Ron and Hermione. As though spending time alone with them was somehow taking something away from Draco.
“Come on then, oh mighty no-longer-adolescent wizard. Give me a hand with my case and then I’ll buy you some cake. Or lunch, depending on how long this takes.”
to his house, despite living there for a few years now. Hermione had told him, more than once, that he had commitment issues, but he just wanted to not have to worry about arrangements and fussing. He was tired of defending the way he lived: not everyone could be like Ron and Hermione, all driven and building fantastic careers or saving the world. He'd done the saving thing already, and he just wanted a break. A quiet life.
Back outside and once again in the stinging rain, Draco sheltered under Potter’s umbrella once more. “Well, that was interesting.”
“I’ll change in the bathroom again,” Malfoy said. He looked tired: red-eyed and pale. Almost as though he’d been crying.
Harry turned away, feeling it better to leave Ron and Hermione to their little chat. Hermione was also rather pink now, and he remembered enough of his time with Ginny to guess what they were talking about.
“I never said that!” Harry took a deep breath; Malfoy was infuriating in his defensiveness. “It’s been strange, coming back to school. Not having this thing hanging over me, of having to fight Voldemort.”
They had completed the Transfiguration tasks needed to learn the Protean Charm, and Professor Flitwick had taken over as their instructor in the charm. It had been a relief to get back to the challenges of switching and Untransfiguration with McGonagall, but Harry missed her clarity when it came to explaining magic. It still seemed overly complicated to Harry, but then he was more a fan of simple, single-step magic.
She frowned. "Most curious," she said. "That was a bad break, Draco, you completely shattered your ankle." She pursed her lips. "And you had no Healer, no Skele-Gro?"
“I hire an owl, but I give it the parcel and send it off myself. I am aware of the value of my goods.”
Pansy made an undignified noise as her tea went down the wrong way. “Sorry; did you just say ‘Potter’?”
Harry was on his back, while Draco moved with thrusts that changed the shape of his behind, creating dips and rises.
“The Room wouldn’t let anything bad happen to you,” Harry said, strangely confident of the truth of his words as he said them.
Malfoy shrugged. “It’s what some of them say.” He pulled a scroll from within his robes. “I did bring some work with me. I’m sure you’ve got things to get on with, Potter.”
Harry muttered something beneath his breath before opening his eyes. “I’m far too sleepy to move, but am I really on Luna’s sofa with you, Draco? This isn’t another dream?”
. Harry had followed Malfoy around for a year, and no one had believed him when he’d said that Malfoy was up to no good, and he had been, hadn’t he? He’d been trying to kill Dumbledore, and to find a way to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.
"The attic? Really? You do realise that will probably take us all day, right?" Harry said, groaning. Malfoy just shot him a glance which made it clear that this was too stupid a question to answer, and they made their way upstairs.
And over by the study tables, standing stiffly and with eyes down, were Zabini, Bulstrode, Greengrass, and Malfoy. The Slytherins. Harry was loathe to use their given names: they had always been so unfriendly, and their House’s association with the Death Eaters made him want to keep a distance.
Harry looked up to meet Hermione's eyes, and then he glanced over at Draco, who was still deep in conversation with Andromeda.
Harry felt the sting of the injustice of her words. He wasn't the one who had pushed the situation to this point, Malfoy was. Malfoy was the one who had kissed him. He couldn't, wouldn't, mention it. Hestia kept her eyes fixed on him.
Luna watched Harry as he drank the potion. It tasted… sweet, actually, but also faintly sour, like fruit gone bad. It was also thick and slimy, and Harry wasn’t sure if this was the bit she’d meant, but the unmistakable stirrings of nausea were rolling through his gut by the time the vial was empty. He ate some biscuit, and strangely, the tingly crunch sweet and sour sensation overrode the taste of the potion, and left his mouth feeling refreshed.
“I’m going to look into it, but at this stage I’m afraid that I’d be inclined to agree with you: it doesn’t sound like you are seeing an accurate representation of the future.” Granger glanced at her slim wrist watch, then stood. “I’ll send you a message via Muggle mail if I find out any more. And if you can think of anything else to tell me, feel free to owl or mail me too.” She cancelled the Muffliato and strode away, her footsteps lost above the din of the room.
Harry was standing by The Burrow’s kitchen window, looking at the rising light of a bleak winter’s dawn while he waited for the kettle to boil, when Ginny walked in, still rubbing sleep from her eyes.
“When I got here I was scared. Nowhere had been safe for me: not Hogwarts, never again the Manor, nor even the supposed ‘safe’ house the Ministry sent me to.” Draco pulled his hand away from Harry’s and scrubbed at his face. “I think I should start going out again—”
Great rolling fields spread out beneath him, farmhouses and villages dotted along the way. The great snake of the motorway came into view every now and then, and Draco would fly near so he could read the road signs and check he was heading in the right direction. It seemed to Draco that the further south he flew, the warmer it became, although it was hard to tell with all the rushing wind.
As if they’d ever spent any time together. Harry stared at Malfoy. The bastard. It was as if Malfoy knew some secret that Harry wasn’t privyparty to, and it was infuriating. Well, he’d had enough of feeling one step behind. This time, Harry was going to be the first to act. All of sudden he knew what to do. He took a step forward, watching as Malfoy's eye's widened, and something – hope, fear, desire? – filled his gaze. And then Harry pulled back his fist, and swung with all his might until it connected with Malfoy's jaw and a sickening crack filled the room. Malfoy's eyes lost their focus, and for a moment everything stood still, and then his body flew back as he collapsed on the floor.
“Sell it.” Draco nodded at the fireplace, where a single candlestick stood against a gilt-edged mirror. “That’s one of two. There are lots of odd bits lying around here: she’s been selling off the contents of her house for years. Old name, no money. It’s a common enough occurrence.” Draco pulled out his wand, running it between his fingers in tight circles. “I need to test the violin for magic. If it’s not magical, she could probably get more for it on the Muggle market. Of course, that also depends on what you can do with it. Do you think that you can restore it?”
Two minutes later, Kingsley’s assistant ushered in a pale yet defiant-looking Draco Malfoy, whose eyes widened in horror when he saw who was waiting for him. Harry didn’t know how he hadn’t guessed immediately who Kingsley had meant. Malfoy recovered, sticking his pointy chin up again and holding himself aloft with what Harry assumed was meant to be dignity.
Harry groaned, and hid his face in his hands. “I have to go home and watch the bloody memories, don’t I?”
Dudley let out a short huff of a laugh. “A lot happened.” He glanced over at Harry, as though deciding whether or not to tell him something. “For one, I came out to my parents. I’m, er, I’m gay.”
A dozen? Draco stared after Henry as he walked out of the house. He stared back at the pile of rushes. He could do this. Suddenly a fun little challenge seemed much more like hard work.
The next person Harry got stuck to was an old wizard who need to pee every five minutes. Harry was beginning to learn more about the various toilet habits of the whole of Level 2 than he had ever wanted to know. He was extremely thankful for Silencing Charms though.
Harry felt something in him break. Was that what Draco thought? Worse still, was Draco right? Was he really that self absorbed? “I do, I just—”
“I’ll try harder,” Harry said. “I’ve had some time off work, I haven’t been feeling very well.” They sounded like excuses to him. The grip of guilt was still tight and heavy in his gut. “I’m feeling a bit better now. I’ll try to come more often.”
“Come with me, again,” Potter stopped in the street, reaching out to touch Draco’s arm. His cheeks reddened up as he asked. “It helps having you along. And you… you’re better company than half the people I work with. I… I quite like having you around.”
About the time that Harry had begun shuffling his feet and rubbing his hands together in an attempt to keep warm, the door creaked open. Quickly Harry stilled, and hoped he was still adequately covered. Surely in the dark shadows of the room he could remain hidden, even if a bit of elbow showed.
“That’s the thing. Dear old daddy was pushing that through, too. His daughter worked on the gloves, her husband on the replacement balls. It seems though that it was Ludo, not his daughter, driving this whole thing.”
"Well you do now that we've moved out, love," said Ron, giving her a squeeze. "And we really shouldn't underestimate the importance of the—"
His sweat stung in the cut on his arm, and Draco’s skin felt almost raw and prickly in the heat, but he focused on hauling himself up. If he could only get a little higher, he would be able to see above the forest canopy, and maybe work out where he was. He moved his foot to the next branch up, pushed up, and twisted his body so that his thighs ached and his side pulled but he could finally see past the top of the tree.
“Just like we all are,” Luna said, nodding sagely. “Not at the request of the Ministry, though.” Her nose twitched as the smell of well-done toast filled the air. “Oh, the toast!” Luna flipped the bread over, and Harry was relieved to see that it wasn’t burned.
Standing at the sink to fill the kettle, Granger’s words, too, echoed in his mind, and Draco realised that she was right: he felt more at home than he had ever done before. And it wasn’t where he was, but what he was doing. Having a future in wandmaking – one that followed his own path, not Ollivander’s – was a feeling new and freeing.
He knew that Kreacher had tried to make it shine with the pride of its former years, but it still remained the rather oppressive house of a Pureblood family. Being in the house didn’t inspire any feelings of peace, far from it. Harry came here on bad days not to calm down, but so that he could be as angry as he felt inside. Harry looked at Sirius’s old room and he hated it. He hated Sirius for dying and leaving him alone, and he hated himself for having led Sirius to his doom. He hated the stupid Black family for being so stuck up, and on particularly bad days Harry enjoyed nothing more than having a screaming row with the hideous portrait in the hall.
“Well, go then,” she said. “You go be with your love. And yes, thank you very much, Harry Potter. I think I will live here, with Teddy.”
"It’s easier here." Potter pushed at the tufts of grass poking up from the ground at the forest’s edge, exposing dark leaf-rich loam beneath the smattering of brown and rust leaves resting there. "Did you know that I died?"
Away from the frigid December air, the kiss felt different. There was passion, yes, but there was also something else. It felt shaky and new; it was, Harry realised, hope.
"Harry, mate, you're not... Merlin, I don't even want to say it aloud," said Ron. "You don't fancy him, do you?" he asked.
Potter nodded. “I don’t know how you feel about going there, but I want to interview David Inkledrum.”
From the window he could see the little tree outside. The sycamore’s leaves were beginning to turn yellow; the leaves clung to the tree, but would soon be gone. But spring would come, and new ones would grow.
Harry grinned. He and Teddy had perfected the art of pissing Draco off with this routine. It didn’t work quite so well now that Teddy was a teenager. Or rather, he had found a new routine all on his own to annoy the both of them.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” muttered Sally-Anne. “I mean, er, what a relief it’s not permanent.” She looked at the floor and twisted her mouth to one side. “I’ve been gone a fair while now – do you mind if I go back to my office? Only they might be wondering where I am.”
He found himself in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, shying away for a second from the din of all the school eating breakfast, mountains of eggs and bacon and toast on each table. The hall looked strange for some reason, and then Harry realised that it was because he was standing next to the Slytherin table. And there was Draco, sitting, quiet and unhappy-looking, amongst the bustle of his friends.
"You were too slow," Ollivander said. "Too tentative." He got off his stool and came to stand beside Draco. "And why the uncarved wood?" He shook his head before Draco could answer. "Everything about this speaks of fear. You can’t make wands if you are frightened, Draco."
"I don't see what's so special about it," he said, puzzled as to exactly why Malfoy felt he could advise Harry on his living arrangements, yet intrigued that Malfoy had been thinking about his home in this way.
As he reached the servant’s entrance, Draco paused. He could hear music coming from the other end of the servants’ passage, where it ran behind the ballroom. There was a big wedding party on, he knew, but he hadn’t really paid any attention to the details. He wished he had now, because the music playing was
stimulating in my day to look forward to." The light from the window fell at an angle across their table, and Harry could feel his arm warming in the heat of it, but Malfoy's face was brilliant in the sunshine. The smudge was still there, and Harry decided not to mention it.
As they walked into the dark hallway, Harry's arm tingling again as they brushed up against each other, Malfoy whispered, “I thought you didn’t see them much?”
"Fuck," he said at the wood-like rush of deep magic he felt. "Is all the magic from that wand like that?"
Two more Aurors stood in the corner, one holding Scunthorpe by the arm. Draco hadn’t even noticed him in the room when they’d first come in, but then so much had been happening. After a terse whispered conversation with Weasley, the Aurors led Scunthorpe and Bagman away.
“Don’t be so bossy, Samuel.” Hannah put the dog down into her lap, and raised a pair of lorgnettes to her face before taking a good look at Potter. Even here, Potter managed to be the bloody centre of attention. “Ooh, what a fine young man. Thank you, dear, for what you did. Life here was unbearable.” Potter’s jaw twitched, and Draco imagined that he’d have plenty to say about other people having had a bad time. Hannah though, appeared not to notice, and continued to peer down at him. “You could do with a good wash and scrub up though. And some new clothes.” Her gaze wandered over to Draco. “That’s more like it.”
“Of course, it’s all thanks to my salesman abilities. My gift of the gab.” Draco looked down into his glass “What would my mother say? Her son, reduced to being a tradesman.” He took another sip of beer, and shook his head at Henry. “Don’t laugh at me. She could be very serious about such things. According to her, people like us didn’t need professions. Merlin, it was boring.”
“I am, sometimes. Other times I’m sad. And I guess whatever looks like serious to you,” he added. “Will you think about what I said?”
“We’re not,” Blaise said, but then he looked at Malfoy thrumming and tightly held together. His face softened a fraction, and he stood up. Felix bounded to the floor, and Harry hoped he’d get a chance to get cat hairs on him, too. “We can go now,” Blaise said.
“Draco, please illustrate for us the correct way to restrain someone so that they cannot reach for their wand.”
He drank his coffee. He could go on to Marseille, and wait outside Guillaume’s shop. Yet his perusal of the map suggested that Harry’s place was more likely to be on the way to Marseille, and that if he could work out where Harry lived he would save himself a considerable amount of time.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “But you’re not your aunt. And anyway, maybe it goes both ways: Molly did…” Harry mimed waving a wand, not really wanting to say
“I had no idea that you were such an expert on ‘house-elf’ tasks,” Harry said. “I think you’ll find that I’ve got far more experience than you.”
Draco snorted. “It is possible to concentrate on one’s job without draining one’s intellect completely.”
"I don’t think," Draco said, and Harry’s finger stopped moving. "I hope so." He reached out and hooked his fingers onto Harry’s. "I know I care about you, and that being away from you this week has been horrible."
From where he sat on the bench, he could see a flock of green parakeets in the neighbour’s tree. One squawked, and then they all flew off, strangely at home in this English setting. The breeze picked up, and a spot of rain fell on Harry’s nose: time to go in. He’d heard a few rumbles of thunder, and it seemed likely another storm was headed their way.
“Ah, yes,” said Potter. Draco waited for him to continue, but Potter remained silent. Honestly, the man sometimes seemed to struggle to string a sensible sentence together.
"Paper Spiders?" asked Harry with a wince. They'd had a few at the Ministry: they made their webs in stores of old paper, catching snippets of escaping magic, and their bites caused itching and contact with their webs indelible black staining. "I suppose in that case I could pay for your trousers."
The streets around his house weren't too busy, but as they walked, Harry realised with a start that they weren't heading to his normal sandwich shop; however fast Harry went, it was Malfoy who always seemed to be leading, long legs making confident strides. Within a few minutes they arrived at a café much nearer Wizarding London than Harry would normally venture. It was small, but looked cheerful enough with its overflowing noticeboard, with flyers for city beekeeping clubs and knitting circles, and a couple nursing cups of tea by the door.
“Everywhere!” Dudley said, with a low rumbling laugh. “And I’ve enough saved up, but I can’t quite go yet.”
"Yes." Potter poured hot water over the coffee grounds. The both watched as the water swirled, then slowly began to drain through. Draco was torn between gritting his teeth again at Potter’s slowness, and salivating at the thought of a cup of coffee. "I wanted to check how it was coping with the fire."
"You called me a prick," Draco said, outraged. And then he, too, started to laugh. "What a pillock."
“Oh. Oh! I see,” Harry said. He’d known the two of them had grown close, but he hadn't thought that his vague suspicions would amount to anything quite yet. Or maybe it was more that he'd been so caught up in thinking about Draco he'd stopped noticing. The way Greg looked at Luna, there was no doubt at all about how he felt about her. Harry wondered whether he looked at Draco like that, then decided he didn’t care.
Draco let out a long, shuddering breath. “I’ve been dreading that,” he said. “But expecting it, too.”
Harry thought about his talks with George. It was good to have someone else to talk to, someone outside of the little group of eighth years.
Kissing Draco seemed to be the right thing to do, and when he did it he could feel it, feel the need they had for each other. The kissing intensified, becoming heated in a more direct way. They were now completely entangled, Draco’s shirt half undone, Harry’s t-shirt pulled up to reveal his stomach, and lying along the length of the sofa. As they kissed, Harry could feel the heat of Draco’s erection against his own, through their clothes. He arched into the feeling.
"Since we are stuck with each other, I suppose I could help you. Enough for you to hear the trees a little, maybe."
Henry had looked Draco up and down after he emerged from the tiny bathroom, hair still wet and clothes slightly damp from where he hadn’t quite been able to dry himself. Draco had taken care to choose his clothes for the day, and he hoped Henry would deem his smart pair of trousers in a heavy cotton, and simple linen shirt acceptable.
"I'm glad you're okay, mate, but I can't understand why you haven't got rid of them yet," Ron said, grimacing slightly as he shook his head. "They are seriously creepy. In fact, I can't understand how you can stand living in that gloomy old house, whether it's trying to kill you or not."
Panting slightly as he paused outside the breakfast room, Draco checked his appearance in a hallway mirror. Being around his father always made him nervous and he never felt he could afford to betray any kind of weakness. Draco took a deep breath and walked in.
The tingling feeling had sprung up again, and was travelling along Harry's arms and legs like little zingy energy bolts.
“I had noticed that you had overcome your differences,” McGonagall said. “But this is quite a claim to be making.”
“I’ve got you to warm me up,” Harry said, stepping closer and sliding his arms under Draco’s robes. Draco was indeed hot, and Harry closed his eyes as he slid his hands around to Draco’s back. Long arms encircled him, just as they did at night.
“Then what,” Malfoy said, “is that?” He pointed to the toastie machine. Harry did vaguely remember using it, but he didn’t remember it looking quite that… debauched. A crust of cheese lined most of its edge, with long, hardened strands of cheese hanging off the sides. Greasy finger prints glinted in the harsh light of the kitchen’s neon strip.
Draco followed, letting the water wash over his head in the hope that it would clear it of the fog of
“I’ve got a case for you.” He threw a file down onto the desk. “As soon as you’ve collected your things, you can head out.”
The body of the Snitch bore a series of lines, like a smile of horizontal teeth below the sweeping eyelashes of the wings. Other raised lines marked out what Draco thought of eyebrows, moustaches or mouths, depending on his mood. Each Snitch felt as though it were its own person: some lay cheeky in his palm, others sat with dignity. And yet Draco prided himself on the unvarying standard of his work, on the fact that everything he produced was dependable and of the highest quality. With care, Draco set his foot to pump once more, this time to power the small engraving tool with which he added the final details before the Snitch was ready for enchanting.
And then their faces were close enough to feel Harry’s breath on his skin. Gently, as gently as the first time, their lips met in a kiss.
Harry tried to put thoughts of Malfoy out of his mind. Just because he came top of everything didn’t mean anything. He looked at the mirror set up in the corner of his room, and focused on his reflection, trying to take in every detail of his appearance, then he closed his eyes and pointed his wand beside him, concentrating hard on his sense of his own physical presence in the room. The Gemino Curse simply made a copy, but this version, copying a person, was a little more complex and shadowy in its application. It was impossible for the copy to be made permanent, and it was only at best like a shadow, no matter how substantial it looked. But still, to copy yourself? There were, Harry had discovered, plenty of areas were the boundary between what was considered Light and Dark was blurred.
Draco took his hand. "I don’t know. This… how it’s been, it’s not going to be like that forever, is it?"
to. The old times aren’t quite enough, and we’ve changed, all three of us. But… I want to work out how we can be together again. I… I’m glad they’re here this week. I need this time with them."
"Actually, I think I'll show Draco the outside, if you don't mind. It's such a beautiful view," Harry said, stepping back and holding Draco's hand. Draco didn't look at him, but did squeeze back, gripping on tightly with his fingers.
The singing stopped, and along with the sound of running water. Draco hastily stood, and began to fold the clothes in the basket. The bathroom door opened, a cloud of steam pouring out along with Henry, still half-wet with the towel around his hips.
.” The light flicked on, the room suddenly too bright. Perhaps though, it would help drive out the thoughts of other, darker rooms.
Of course, smiling prettily was hard to do when the person you were talking to had half-chewed parsley leaf stuck to their teeth. Or were all bones and far too tall for Draco.
behind. As a rule, Draco didn’t look at the paper, but there was a lull, and Melissa brought him a nice cup of tea when she told him that patient number four hadn’t turned up. He sat back with his tea, and stared at the paper. Would there be a story about Potter inside? There always seemed to be. In fact, it was one reason he avoided the paper.
Draco turned fully towards Harry. “You’re cold. I need… don’t go.” He pulled back his covers, and Harry looked at him, at the silver tracks left by tears on his cheeks, and the way his eyes were still slightly unfocused by sleep, and he climbed in beside Draco.
“I’m fine. Curious as to why you’re here.” Hermione sat back in her armchair, and took a sip of coffee.
He’d been lauded for bringing down Voldemort, fêted and given an Order of Merlin. Through those long, hard months of funerals and eventually, trials, Harry hadn’t felt he’d deserved any of that celebration. He’d done what he could, but was it enough when so many he, and others, loved were dead?
George looked at the door, a wistful expression on his face, but then he shook his head. “Thank you, but no.” He held up his bag, and Harry realised it clinked; he had his own drinks. “I’ve actually got someone coming over in a bit - never you mind who - so I’ll be fine.”
George dealt with a customer while Harry browsed the shelves. When he rang up the sale, he called Harry over. “Ron’s not here, you know. Probably trying to placate Mum after another row with Hermione.”
“It’s probably not just you being a hero that’s making people stare, you know. People do stare at me, too. And together…”
As they trudged back to the house, Draco’s fingers began to warm and he noticed the sting of scratches and nicks from the reeds. The sensation faded beside his uncertainty of what was going to happen next. His days were usually filled with wandering the halls of Malfoy Manor alone, or sitting through stifling meals with his parents and their questions about his future. To follow Henry around like this, wading into rivers and being expected to do housework, left Draco feeling as though the compass of his life had gone awry somehow. He was moving through a world that was unknown to him, with strange new rules and expectations.
“Me neither,” Draco said. “Although there was this boy in the year below—” He stopped when he saw Harry’s face. “Probably better not to mention it now.”
“I don’t know,” Draco said. “But it does.” A dreamy look crossed Draco’s face. “He makes me feel alive. He’s… well, I see the appeal now.”
Looking down at the pots on display, Draco felt a warm glow of pride. Unlike the rather shoddy baskets he’d sold here the first time, he knew that his creams and lotions were good. Henry had made him some wonderful small pots, complete with lids, and they looked good. And of course, Draco had drawn on herb lore rather than magic, so that Muggles could use them. The creams were of the finest quality possible. Draco only hoped that no one looked too closely at his own hands, as they remained in rather a poor state thanks to his day job and a terrible advert for his creams. He knew, though, that without the creams they would be cracked and blistered in addition to being red and dry.
She gathered up her things, which Harry took as his cue to leave. His conversation with Malfoy the other night had stirred up so many questions for him. Was it possible to repair the Room of Requirement? How could Malfoy succeed where experienced witches and wizards like McGonagall and Flitwick had failed?
In bed that night, Harry waited until the room was dark before speaking. “I know you’re not happy with me. But I’ve been thinking, and I want to ask you…” Yet again, his courage seemed to fail him.
Malfoy kept staring at her, but then Harry realised that he was staring at Malfoy in turn and hunted out the butter from beside Ron instead.
Dudley scratched at the stubble of his cheek again. “It’s a bit rushed. And my housemates are… well, they take getting used to.”
When he got out of the shower and Henry was there, a pot of coffee sitting on the table, Draco didn’t know where to look. He noticed, though, the way Henry’s pyjamas revealed the suggestion of a curve at the crotch, of a slight bounce as he walked. He looked away, and tried to shake off the last of his dream.
Granger flushed red. “I’m not here to look around, I’m here to let you know what I’ve found out so far. I can just go, if you’d prefer.”
Harry’s mind wandered back to Draco’s sly grin in the bathroom. He saw again the warm smile as he greeted Harry, and the safety poster with notes tacked to the office wall. He recalled the man with the love of correct punctuation, and the way Draco would flush pink when receiving an unexpected compliment. They’d only really been friends for a week, but could it have been something more? If Harry had known, if he’d remembered?
“Hello, boys,” she said, brushing herself down. She nodded at Draco. “Nice to see you again. She looked puzzled as she looked at Harry. “I thought you were working today, Harry?”
s; and Draco’s delicate, perfectly-formed-but-tiny words. Draco always made notes when they cooked. He had a narrow black notebook which he filled with recipes, measurements, timings and his observations. Harry smiled, because he could picture Draco sitting at the dining room table, a small frown on his face, quill in hand.
Teddy nodded solemnly. “Drackee Malfee,” he said. “Drackee Malfee, Drackee Malfee, Drackee Malfee!” He smiled up at Malfoy, his teeth tiny and white. “You’ve got a funny name. I like it.”
If they couldn’t smile or laugh anymore, it didn’t matter how much he ached to touch Draco or how right it felt to sleep beside him at night: maybe they had been right, all those naysayers who had told him it would never work, that this was a relationship doomed to failure. But deep down, no matter how touched by bitterness, Harry couldn’t believe it. What did they know about him, or Draco? His eyes never leaving Draco’s face, Harry hated how lost Draco looked. He missed the biting laugh of old, the whispered “Fuck” and “Get a move on, Potter” as they took and licked and pulled and moved in a glorious, messy, thrilling rhythm.
“Finished your little mystery task? You haven’t redecorated the tree, have you? I knew you weren’t happy with my decorating skills.”
“No, it’s not that,” Harry said. “It’s you; you’re the one who’s focused. I— I like it.” The warm glint was in Harry’s eyes again, the one that made Draco want to step closer. So he did. The waving mass of creatures around them seemed to still.
"No one needs to endure pain like that if a Healer is around. Now let me see what's happened to you before you thank me," she said. She ran a few diagnostic spells, then rocked back on her heels. "You've got a fractured collar bone, and several lacerations from broken glass. You've also got quite a deep wound on your shoulder, and a considerable weight constricting your breathing and your movement." She looked up. "You can move it now, Draco," she said, and as Malfoy Levitated the remains of the chandelier from Harry's chest, he felt the crushing sensation lift.
They fell apart, both breathing heavily. Draco felt so depleted he didn’t think he could have lifted a finger, let alone an arm or a leg.
Alone in his room that night, Draco found it hard to get to sleep. He probably ought to be worrying about finding the violin or fretting over revisiting the East Wing, but all he could see when he closed his eyes were Potter’s hands; thick, calloused fingers wrapped around an elegant wine glass. Narcissa had insisted that Potter stay for dinner, and then that he slept at the Manor, before they spoke to the last few rooms of portraits. In a room only a few doors down, Potter was probably snoring away.
“Doesn’t that mean that you could touch the parts if you wanted to, though?” Potter creased his brow. “That is, if you haven’t charmed them yet?”
Ron was looking at Harry, a small frown on his face that Harry recognised. Ron was thinking, thinking like he did when working a case or playing chess. Harry watched an idea work its way into being across Ron’s face.
"Sorry," said Harry, and he ran a hand through his hair. The sound of heavy rain battering the front door and windows filled the hallway.
Draco frowned. "I sent my mother a letter, and she said she wants me to come back to the Manor. I don't think I can do that though."
Harry tried to get to him, but quickly realised that his hands were tied behind his back with rope. He tugged at the bonds, the remnants of the cruciatus curse sending sharp shooting pains through his arms and torso.
"They weren't too happy…" Draco said, knowing that Harry's gasp would've been at the sight of his arms. "When they saw the cuts."
Malfoy looked at him, grey eyes shining and a grateful smile on his lips. Harry’s breath caught for a second, but he told himself it was just because helping out a friend meant a great deal to him. And he wanted to help Malfoy, he really did. Because he was his friend.
Draco was already holding out his arm for Harry. He gave Draco a look of surprise at the trust he was showing him, before he took his arm and carefully and with the lightest touch, pulled up the sleeve. Draco saw him freeze at the sight of his arm, and he couldn't blame him. It was covered in horrendous scars, and he had indeed opened up a few so they were angry and red.
"How about we do this without wands?" Snyde said with a sneer as he and his cronies advanced on Draco. "More of a fair fight."
"I knew it," Harry said, starting to get revved up. "Was he up to something? Did he take them so I wouldn't stop him from doing whatever he was doing?"
Harry looked a bit peeved at the idea of taking over the class, but Draco caught his eye and gave him an encouraging nod. Harry gave him a grateful smile and instructed them on how to conjure the best Patronus, and then made his way around the room to help out people individually, enlisting Hermione and Ron to do the same. Draco stayed standing to the side until Harry noticed him and came over.
"Why on Earth would you be more upset, Ronald, you weren't even in the relationship," Hermione chastised.
Harry pulled back and held Draco by the shoulders so he could look him in the eye. Draco was only about an inch or two taller than him, but Harry's glasses had slipped down his nose a little, so he had to tilt his head up to look at him properly.
He considered skipping dinner and going straight to his dorm, but he had already skipped lunch earlier. And if the boys who had attacked him were there, then it would show them that it hadn't really affected him, right? He also knew that if he didn't show up for lunch
Draco was discovering that Potter was actually really easy to talk to, and even easier to open up to, which was a scary thought. There were many things that Draco was ashamed of, and there were certain truths about him that he'd never shared with anyone and didn't know how because he had pushed that part of him down so deep. That identity was buried right at the back of his mind, the bottom of his soul, and if he knew that if he dug it up it would change everything.
"At the beginning of the term you said you wanted to start over with him, and it took a little while to get through to him, but he slowly came around. You invited him to join us at meals and nights out, and he became friends with us too. But the two of you… there were some rough patches, from what I could tell, but most of the time you were inseparable."
"Yeah," he said, Ron and Hermione nodding their approval. He cautiously sat down, and any awkwardness quickly dissipated as Hermione asked them how their Potions project was going. The conversation seemed to pick up right where it left off the other night at the Three Broomsticks, but with Ron included to add to Hermione's descriptions of their experiments and the extra details from their most recent lessons.
Harry was woken abruptly by Draco's shout and opened his eyes to see Draco thrashing, his breaths laboured.
He felt Potter step closer to him, and then his arms were wrapping around Draco's neck. He leaned into the embrace, wrapping his arms around his waist to hug him back, and enveloping himself in his warmth. It was comfort like he'd never known before, and it felt like home. Draco clung to him like he was a lifeline and buried his face in his shoulder just as a sob racked uncontrolled through his body. Potter only held him tighter, one hand on the back of his neck, fingers in his hair.
"Ah." They stood in the hall, facing each other, and Draco found himself wishing that the night didn’t have to end. Instead, he said, "Goodnight, Potter."
"Hi, Harry!" Neville grinned. "Did you eat already? Gran told me to give you these." Neville handed Harry a container of freshly baked muffins. "Her neighbour gave them to her this morning and Gran and I thought that you might like some as a back to school treat."
Harry groaned. "I don't want to talk about him right now. I just had to endure breakfast with him. I don't even want to
Class was just letting out as Harry reached the Potion's classroom, and he heard Draco talking to one of his students from outside the door.
"Harry, why was Malfoy so angry all supper?" Ron asked after letting out quite a large yawn. "He looked as though he wanted to hurt you, with the way he kept looking at you, you'd think he were ready to kill."
"Harry! You've complained about not getting shagged for months and now one of the hottest men you know actually wants to shag you and you reject them?"
Harry kneeled behind his desk in his classroom, shuffling through books, looking for a source for the next day's lesson on Hinkypunks, when he heard the floor creak. "Just a minute, Hermione, I've just got to find my book on dark wetland creatures."
"Yes, Professor," the student said. "Thank you." The student-- Olivia Byrne, Harry recognized, rushed out of the classroom, noticing Harry immediately as she came into the corridor. "Hello Professor Potter," she said.
Harry woke up to a close up of Hermione's face. She was whispering his name, as not to wake up Ron, who was in the next room over. Harry was still in his dress robes, a dark green pair that matched the first pair that he had ever owned. "Harry, wake up already, we've got to get back to the castle," Hermione said.
"How the Hell am I supposed to get through this school year without embarrassing myself? How am I supposed to get through this luncheon?!"
"No, but we just barely won. Don't stress yourself out too much, Byrne, I'm sure Professor Granger would be pleased if you lead Gryffindor house to another Quidditch Cup and House-Cup victory."
Harry sighed. "Thank you. Seriously— I had a great time tonight, I'm just... not ready yet. I can't move on— not yet."
"Oh dear, well you must not know a lot about books, then," Irma laughed. "Ask Hermione, she'll tell you all about how treacherous books can be-- well, you remember that Monster Book of Monsters, don't you?"
"Harry— would you just listen to me?! This is not your fault! And do you honestly think that it's too late? Have you been paying attention?"
As the class left, Harry sat down in his desk chair, resting his arms and head on his desk and letting out a long, exasperated, sigh.
Hermione laughed. "Thank you, Harry. I know whatever you're going through must be difficult-- I haven't you so disassociated since, well, since after the war-- so you can talk to me. Only if you want."
"I— uh, I'm not sure, Ron. Maybe he had a bad day at work. We did get into an argument the other day."
Harry, clutching the Maurader's map, hurried after Minerva, who had left his office in a rush immediately after he announced where the missing student was. As he moved, he started to feel the effects of the alcohol in his system once again. His stomach sloshed with the excessive amount of liquor in his system, and mouth was filling with an unusual amount of warm saliva, as though he were about to vomit.
"That it is! Which is why I am here to invite you to a professors-only luncheon next week. The grand opening of my nephew Robert's restaurant is on October second. We will be having a celebration in honour of our professors. Especially you, Harry. The statistics say that more than seventy five percent of your students taking O.W.L.s last year got an 'O.' You should be very proud."
About halfway through the desks, Harry made his way to the Great Hall for the optional Staff-Only lunch. Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Flitwick sat near the end of the long table, and seemed to be entranced by whatever Malfoy was telling them. That left Madame Hooch, Madame Pomfrey, Madame Pince, Filch, and some of the ghosts, who floated along, talking to some of the professors.
"Er-- Hello Professor Klein. I must be off now, Hermione needs me," Harry lied, leaving Draco and his new flirt behind, rushing back to his office. When he arrived, Hermione had gone, leaving her now clean cup in Harry's cupboard. Harry placed his cup down and sighed to himself before sitting on the couch. How could he be so stupid?
Malfoy took the napkin from Harry and for a quick second, almost as though Harry had imagined it, he smiled. "Thank you, Potter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do before the celebration tonight." Malfoy gestured towards the door, and Harry nodded his head curtly before exiting.
"We spent the past few days feeding this Kappa cucumbers with your names engraved in them so that he would be repelled against harming you in any way. We would never purposefully put you in a dangerous situation," Harry agreed. This seemed to calm the students slightly, and they came a little closer to the professors and the creature.
"Alright, everyone, settle down," Harry said as he leaned on the front of his desk. "Does anyone have any questions?-- Yes, Mr. Wells?"
"Sorry, I promised Neville I would go to lunch with him around now-- We're meeting Pansy and Theo in Hogsmeade. I'll be back in an hour or so to help with that Grindylow order."
When Harry made it to the castle, Hermione was already waiting in his office with two cups of tea ready. Harry flung off his cloak and threw himself onto the love-seat beside her before taking off his shoes.
Harry straightened and looked up at Neville. "Hi, Nev! I didn't know you don't have classes on Thursday afternoons! What's up?"
"Well that must've been even worse with Malfoy staring at you all night," Hermione said, taking a sip of her cocoa.
"Sure, one minute." Luna disappeared back into the flat and Harry heard her murmur something to Ginny.
"No room. We've got a whole greenhouse at home, there's no way I would be able to fit it in my quarters, and I don't want the students touching them. Sorry, I have to go use the loo, if you'll excuse me..."
Harry's chest flushed. "I am," he said. "I have my sixth years next class, I'll be sure to congratulate them. How did the N.E.W.T. students do?"
Harry sat down at his regular spot at the Professors' table for the beginning of term feast. On his left was an empty seat, and to his right sat Hermione.
"Er-- its no problem, Professor Malfoy." Harry looked behind him at the snickering students. "I'll be off, then. I need to finish this lesson on Kappas, and I'm sure Professor Granger won't be too pleased if half of her students show up late to Transfiguration."
"Alright, dear.  Let me know if you change your mind. There won't be anyone else in here for a while."
Hogwarts had received several new students this year, more than Harry had ever seen. He wondered how he would adjust his classroom for the difference of students. He would definitely need more desks.
Harry smiled and tucked the note back in to his pocket as he walked towards the Three Broomsticks, where he promised he would meet Neville before the day started.
A few students raised their hands, and Harry chose Antony Eliot, a third year student in his class. "Kappas live in bogs and ponds so that they can easily drown their victims."
The sorting ceremony was very eventful, and the meal was exceptional, as always. Not to mention that Malfoy kept purposefully bumping knees with Harry. Hardy found his heart pounding by the end of the meal.
Harry looked up at the sound of his name. He hadn't heard them from these lips in such a long time, and the sound of it gave him goosebumps. And then he turned away, remembering that he hated Draco Malfoy with every fibre of his being.
Draco came to a full stop. The room got colder as, with a blank face, Draco turned to face Harry,  his eyes red and rimmed with tears, and said: "Do me a favour and leave me alone."
"Alright then," Draco said, clearly not believing Harry. The tips of his ears had turned pink at the realization that Harry may have witnessed the scene that took place inside the Potions classroom. "Did you want any help cleaning up?"
"Why so surprised, Potter? You know I was top of our class. If you and Longbottom can get in as professors, it shouldn't be nearly as hard for me to become one as well."
"Oh, no. We're getting along quite well, actually," Harry said with a pointed look towards Draco as Neville slid back into the booth.
As Harry looked behind him, he saw Luna and a slightly-more-sober Ginny returning from the washroom. Ginny had a satisfied smile on her face, and when they returned to the table, she turned to Harry and Blaise. "She shagged me in there," she smirked, her thumb over her shoulder, pointing in the general direction of the washrooms.
"Hello Miss Byrne. I expect that the responsibilities of being Quidditch captain and being a N.E.W.T. student have you under a lot of pressure?" Harry asked.
Harry groaned. "Why did I ever think it would be okay to leave you two as roommates?" He asked to no one in particular, helping Ron sit down, propping him against the door. "Ron, stay here, I'm going to apparate to Luna's and get Ginny's keys."
"You'd better, Potter. I don't care if you defeated the darkest sorcerer of your time, if you give me so much as one reason to believe that you're not fit for this job--"
"All the same, a muffin's a muffin," Malfoy said before grinning to himself as if he had made some clever joke. "So Neville, Theo tells me that you're teaching him how to garden," he said.
"Professor McGonagall, perhaps you should consider detention, rather than expulsion. I understand that what these students did was wrong, however, much worse acts have been committed in these halls with much lesser punishments."
Hermione's scowl deepened and she raised her hand as if she were going to hit them. "Let's go, alright? I'm sure McGonagall wouldn't be all too pleased if she discovered that you two were teaching class hungover because you didn't have time to take a potion." She marched out of the room, the two boys following behind her in a hurry.
"Alright," Draco repeated, letting go of Harry's shoulders with a embarrassed look. The two gave a small, awkward wave before they started walking in the same direction. "Ah, you know what, I forgot something in the staff lounge."
Malfoy sighed and sat down stiffly on one end of the beaten up love-seat. "I can't believe you kept this," he said, running his hand across the worn down surface of the cushion.
"See you soon, Harry. I've actually got to stop by Honeydukes for my beginning of term gifts," Neville said.
The girls scrambled out of the Headmistress' office, leaving Harry alone with Minerva, who's anger was now (or quite possibly always was) directed at Harry. She gestured to the empty seat across from her and Harry sat down, slowly.
"Thanks, Hermione." Harry contemplated telling Hermione about everything but shook away the thought almost immediately. Nobody would understand his grief, not even Hermione.
"I understand, Byrne. I will give you a two day extension on the essay, but remember, school comes before quidditch."
Once they reached the castle, Harry followed Malfoy down to the dungeons. "Thank you for doing this," Harry said, sitting on top of Malfoy's desk. "I would do it myself if my potion-making skills weren't so
While picking up another book, a piece of paper fell onto the floor. When he bent down to pick it up, he noticed that it was actually a napkin, which had green, cursive handwriting on it.
"Well, I invited him here. I thought we could all meet beforehand and well... diffuse any tension..."
Hermione grabbed the bottle and held it just out of his reach. "Do you promise you'll start acting normal again? No more Malfoy drama?"
"Better than your best, Potter. I don't want a single complaint for the rest of the year!" McGonagall gave Harry a pointed look as she backed out of the classroom. "Better than your best!" She called out one more time before leaving Harry alone with his mounds of books.
Their conversation was interrupted by Ginny, who was way drunker than she should have been on a week night.  "Hey Harry," she said from the other side of Harry. "Harry..."
Harry had spent that night on the couch, covered in three blankets, scared and saddened at the thought of spending the rest of his life alone, after such a long time of devoting himself to someone else. He quit his job, having nothing to get him through the painstakingly long and horrid days in the Auror department.
"Well, that's wonderful! I thought it would take a bit more time, but it's great that you're getting along! It'll make the school year a lot less stressful, that's for sure."
Draco pushed himself to his feet, squaring up to Harry. "Really? What, you think it's disgusting that I flirted with another man? Just because I was in love with you doesn't mean I'm not allowed to have fun! You've clearly been shagging someone, by the looks of those bruises on your neck, you filthy hypocrite."
"Well I sure hope so, he's been dreaming about this opportunity since fourth year. To lose it now would crush him."
"It wasn't me who was experimenting— you can't tell anyone that I told you this!" Hermione said with a pointed look as they set the curtain rod down and slid off the drapes.
"Why wouldn't I? It's a perfectly good couch," Harry replied as he handed Malfoy his cup and sat down next to him.
Harry had quickly dried himself off and headed for the kitchen for a snack before he would cook dinner for the two of them. However, when he went to open the fridge, he noticed a letter attached to the door by a magnet. The same blue butterfly magnet that Draco had boughten when Harry took him to the London Zoo for the first time. Harry tore down the letter— Draco's usually tidy, perfect scrawl was messy and rushed.
Blaise backed up, letting Harry pull his pants back up. "I'm really sorry, I didn't know that I would— it's just that—"
"I would appreciate if you used less colourful vocabulary this early in the morning," He said in a playful manner.
Harry spit out his drink as he covered Ginny's mouth with his hand. The entire table fell silent, and he and Draco quickly met eyes before turning their now-crimson faces away from each other. Luna stood up and held her girlfriend by the shoulders. "Come on, Gin, I think you've had too much to drink." Luna helped Ginny stand up and guided her towards the bathroom.
"I'm looking for the map! It shows you everyone who's in the castle and where they are— my father created it, with his friends."
"Well, er-- I used to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs as a child. The Dursley's made me-- until I started getting my Hogwarts letters, which were addressed to '
"Why don't you start by telling me why you left? I was obviously not flirting with Ginny, since she had already come out as lesbian at that point. So why did you go?"
"One of the Slytherin students, Kate Spinner. She was last seen three hours ago in the common room. The other students reported her missing when her dorm mates said that she wasn't in her bed."
As he emerged from the spiral staircase, he crashed into another body, sending them flailing to the ground, and forcing Harry to close his eyes and clutch his stomach to prevent himself from projectile vomiting all over his victim.
"Well I don't think us revealing that we knew about your relationship would've helped you in the long run."
"That's true. Potionsmaking is solely for the single-minded. Granger's got too many things on her plate."
"Beats me," Blaise grinned. "I hope he doesn't trip over one of his patients." Blaise's teeth shined brighter than pearls as he let out a low chuckle, despite having been sipping on red wine for the past hour, and Harry felt himself involuntarily swooning.
"Listen, Harry, I know that you're all upset because Draco is a professor here, but you're going to have to toughen up and stop sulking around about it. He's here to stay, so get over yourself, and start acting like a real teacher again," she said, putting the bottle of firewhiskey down on his coffee table. "So here are your options: You either drink this entire bottle of firewhiskey with me and get plastered, or you can tell me what the hell is wrong with you
Harry threw on his cloak before leaving for his second home. Ginny had baked cookies the night prior (hence the lack of sugar) and had left one in the inside pocket of his robes with a note.
"Oh, that— Blaise was flirting with me the entire night! I didn't recognize it at first, but he kept grinning with his teeth. Remember what he told us that one night at the Leaky? That he smiles with his teeth when he's flirting because they're so white and pearly? Anyways, he kept doing that, then he told me that he'd like to see me naked."
"Well for starters, Draco probably wouldn't have left. We had been sneaking around for over a year!"
"Well I ought to be, but Hermione left me in the middle of cleaning my classroom, so I'm a bit behind. Hopefully it'll all be ready for class tomorrow, though."
I've taken all of my belongings and I'm leaving the country for a while. Don't try to contact me. Please.
As they walked away, the table stayed silent long enough to hear Ginny say: "Are you going to shag me in there?"
"Yes, actually, it is. It was handmade in Italy. It's very comfortable, but I'm sure it will be just as nice when I take it off."
"It means that Draco told Pansy and I about what happened, and it didn't sound good on either of your parts."
"Shit. Fucking Hell," Harry grumbled, literally rolling out of the bed and getting caught in his robes. He started to push himself off of the floor when a pale hand emerged, offering to help him up. Harry took Malfoy's hand and got to his feet, blushing furiously with embarrassment.
"Well, I hope all goes well. I've got loads of new books coming in today, so I'm hoping I can reorganize the library while we're in the quiet period before all the' students start actually doing their homework."
Harry left Hermione in his office, alone on the sofa, not even bothering to put his cup down as he rushed to the dungeons, where he knew Draco would be. As he approached Draco's classroom, he saw the man he was looking for through the slightly open door. Draco was sitting on top of one of the desks, grinning at Henry Klein, the Ancient Runes professor, who had a hand placed on Draco's thigh. Harry clenched his eyes shut, the opened them again slightly, forcing himself to take in the sight before him.
"Well, some friends are meeting Theo and I at the Three Broomsticks for supper tonight-- a sort of  celebration-- you see, he's been accepted into the Healer's program at St. Mungo's."
Harry's breath hitched. He looked at Malfoy, who had turned to face him. "We need to talk," he whispered, barely audible.
"I swear sometimes the stories you tell me about those bloody muggles makes me want to go back to the dark side," Draco grumbled.
about spending a whole school year with him." Harry took a sip of his tea and sunk into the couch. "I mean, how did he even get the job?! He probably doesn't even have the credentials! Who hired him? McGonagall? She must be going mad!"
A few minutes later, Luna returned. "Ginny said that she didn't bring hers because she planned on spending the night here. She said that Ron brought his with him."
Harry stepped back from the door and put his hands down at his side, forgetting that he was holding a mug full of tea. It fell to the floor and tea and glass spilled everywhere. Harry cursed himself as he heard shuffling within the classroom and bent down to the broken cup. He pulled out his wand as Draco came to the door, Henry standing not too far behind him.
"Oh don't act like you didn't notice. Every time Pansy and I started a conversation with him, he would be too distracted by whatever you were doing instead. I reckon he still fancies you."
"Shut up, Potter. Close your eyes, if you must, but you're staying here— I'm not finished with you yet."
"Wonderful. Of course, we will be doing no harm to Scrubby here, we will simply be observing and admiring his actions. This way you can all have proper research and experience for your quiz on Monday." The students groaned at the mention of a quiz, but seemed less tense when Harry told them that it would not be worth a lot of marks, and would just be putting to test what they learned in that class.
"Minerva, I'm sorry. I should have let you know that I was leaving. I promise, I didn't mean to frighten you, I was upset, and I had to go see... someone."
"I always knew he would do well. I should send him a letter of congratulations," Harry said, taking out a quill and parchment.
"Yes, sir." Byrne ran to catch up to her friends, who waited for her at the bottom of the stairs, giggling.
"Very well... that is enough information about your personal life. I do not wish to... pry. Please do inform me if you're leaving next time, and close the door on your way out." Harry gulped and nodded his head before standing up and hurrying out of the office.
"Come on, Harry, the sexual tension between you two was so thick, you couldn't even cut it with a chainsaw!"
"While you've been busy avoiding Draco's gaze, he's been busy staring at you longingly. Honestly, it's like we're back at Hogwarts."
"Quarter past twelve? Well, I must be off, I've got a class to teach!" Harry rushed back towards the castle, leaving the students behind. Upon reaching the Defence room, it was empty, except for Professor McGonagall, who sat at his desk— that's when he remembered that he had no class in fifth period.
Minerva came to a halt outside the broom cupboard in question, and Harry silently thanked God. He took a few deep breaths before composing himself. "Professor, perhaps you should open it," he told Minerva. "I don't think it would be appropriate if I— well, you see, they're both girls, and, well—"
and embarrass themselves," Theo said once they were out of earshot, and everyone in Harry's range of spit had dried themselves off. The awkward silence subsided, and the group all burst into a fit of laughter.
." He added when Ron started to giggle. Harry switched to Ron's left side and guided him up the first few stairs. "Are you holding on to the railing? Ron, I swear— just grab the railing you knob!"
"What on—?!" "Aha!" Harry shooshed Minerva. "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good!" Ink started to spread on the blank parchment, and Harry opened it up. "Alright, Kate Spinner, where are you?" He mumbled as he scanned each room. "Found her!" He announced as Minerva rushed to Harry's side. "She's in a broom cupboard on the third floor with Alicia Freeman."
"Like you would let her take all the glory. Besides, Hermione's too consumed in Transfiguration and Arithmancy to care about inventing new Potions."
Harry got to his feet and used his hands to brush the dirt off of his pants. "Pardon?" He asked, unsure of what the headmistress meant.
So alone Harry sat, drinking a black coffee, which tasted horrid, but they had run out of sugar the day prior. Harry forced down the rest of his coffee with a grimace before placing his cup in the sink and grabbing his trunk. At only twenty years old, Harry Potter was the youngest Hogwarts professor, only beating out Neville Longbottom, his colleague and longtime friend by one day.
"That sounds great, I've got a delivery coming today as well, but Grindylows are not nearly as nice as books."
A week passed, and it was a chilly morning on the day of the luncheon, which was not so pleasant considering Harry had planned a conjoint class with Hagrid for their lesson on Kappa's. Hagrid, much to the disapproval and discouragement of Harry, had recently gotten a Kappa as a pet, and had named it Scrubby. Harry had tried warning his friend against capturing a kappa, but Hagrid was convinced that it wouldn't hurt anyone. So, begrudgingly, Harry had helped Hagrid feed it nearly sixty cucumbers with the names of their students carved into them to prevent the Kappa from eating anyone.
"Ouch," Harry said, teasingly putting a hand over his heart. "You don't have to be so harsh." Harry turned to Malfoy. "You don't happen to have a Pepper-Up Potion handy, do you? I think she could use one," He joked.
Please. I know the spacing is weird on this chapter, just please bear with me. I’ve been writing on my phone lately :(
Harry decided to let his third period class out early for lunch, he wanted to take a walk around the grounds, possibly visit Hagrid. On his way down to the little hut by the edge of the forest, Harry stopped at his favourite tree by the lake. The leaves were mostly green, with hints of yellow and red starting to peek through. He laid down and took a deep breath. The smell of grass and earth filled his lungs with joy and he decided to close his eyes for a moment.
Harry gulped and turned to face Blaise. His face was full of something-- lust? Harry smiled sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his neck. "I-- er--" He looked over at Draco, who was deep in conversation with Hermione and Pansy. "I admit, it would definitely be fun to get in bed with you, Blaise, but I'm kind of--"
Harry stopped talking and put on a fake smile as Neville returned. "Everything alright, nobody tried to kill each other while I was away?" Neville asked with a nervous smile.
? I'm evil? I'm a prejudiced pure-blood who dedicates myself to torturing innocent people? In case you didn't know, people change, Potter. Just like how I am good,
Blaise pushed Harry onto the bed almost immediately. It was large, soft, and covered with a dark green duvet. Harry's breath hitched as Blaise kissed and bit his way down his neck, leaving a trail of hickeys that he would have to remind himself to cover up later. Blaise didn't bother with the buttons on Harry's shirt— he simply ripped it off, popping a few buttons in doing so.
Harry had gotten out of the shower after a long day at work— he was not enjoying being an Auror, and his mood reflected that. Thankfully, every time he felt like throwing himself out the window in attempt to end his misery, he thought of Draco; falling asleep in his arms, watching him cook eggs in his pink, frilly apron every morning, kissing his forehead, among other things— needless to say, Harry had thought about Draco a lot that day. He was surprised that he was not at their (basically shared) apartment yet; they must've been running late at the lab.
Malfoy grinned as he finished spooning the potions into two vials. "Alright, you have a point. But, in all fairness, it's not my fault that I'm distracted."
"Oh, playing the orphan card, how clever! Did you ever consider that the people I love have died too?
Hermione had come over a few times a week, trying to get him to leave the house, or at least take a shower, but to no avail. Harry couldn't do anything, couldn't look at anything in his home without thinking of Draco. He had smashed the milk carton, because Draco put milk in his coffee every morning; he had destroyed the blender because Draco would make green smoothies after they spent the night drinking; he had smashed the mirror in the bathroom because he couldn't stand to look at himself without Draco by his side. He spent months in a state of dishevelment, melancholy, and rage.
“Yes, daddy, please,” Draco immediately began begging, but Harry knew they really only had a few minutes and didn’t plan on torturing Draco at this very moment. Later, though, he’d use Draco’s holes for his own pleasures and then finally, maybe, allowing Draco to release again.
Harry moved the hand holding Draco’s neck around to the back of Draco’s head, running his fingers into the silky blonde strands before gripping on tightly, pulling Draco’s head aside so that he could hiss into the opposite ear, “what exactly are you thinking me for?”
As he scanned the shelves around him, he very quickly discovered that this secret library was exactly what the trigger book said it was-a complete library on the art of anal sex. There was an entire section dedicated solely to rimming! He sat his wine glass down on a little table close to the shelf he was currently perusing. He couldn't contain his excitement as his eyes greedily roamed the titles. Thoughts of why his father would have this dirty little library rose up in his mind, but he couldn't trouble himself with caring. At the moment, his hands were reaching for the spine of a thin red book. He opened it to a random page and his eyes widened in shock at what he saw. Right there on the page in front of him was the captivating image of two wizards-one on his back with his legs thrown back over his head, the other licking thirstily at his hole. Draco couldn't look away. He flipped the pages, hoping to find something just as amazing on the next page, and he was not disappointed! Page after page, wizards lay bare before his eyes, clearly in the utmost pleasure.
He turned to the little table with his wine glass and pile of freshly acquired wank material. He pulled the handle of the little drawer and was pleased to find a self inking quill tucked right at the very back of it. He pulled the writing utensil out, sat himself in the only available chair, and hovered the quill over the first page.
“Do you have something you’de like to say to me?” Harry whispered, pressing his neck gently to send Draco’s head tilting back against his shoulder.
Draco tossed his head back, eyes rolling back at the sensation. He knew in the back of his mind that this couldn't possibly be real, but he could feel it-oh god could he feel it! He looked back down at the head now bobbing enthusiastically up and down. He slowly moved his hand to touch that mess of black hair. But he found he couldn't actually touch it. His fingers just moved right through it, only a slight tingling sensation in his fingertips. He had never encountered magic like this, and some tiny part of his mind begged him to stop this madness, but then that oh so talented version of Potter slid his tongue right into his slit and he could do nothing except abandon himself to the pleasure of it all. His hands gripped desperately at the arms of the chair as this Potter moved his lips down to his balls, still pumping his cock with one hand while looking up at him. "Oh, fuck," Draco whined. So what if this wasn't real! This was absolutely amazing. Harry Potter was down on his knees with Draco's balls in his mouth, looking for all the world like the most perfect little cock whore. Potter descended onto his cock again, sucking him for all he was worth. Draco's hips were thrusting involuntarily and his breath was reduced to little gasps. His orgasm was coming as swiftly and surely as the Hogwarts express on the first of September. He gave an almighty cry as he came, feeling the muscles in Potter's throat taking him deep and milking him for all he was worth. Draco's eyes rolled into the back of head, until he finally slumped against the back of the chair.
Draco’s back pressed against Harry’s chest, his sweaty neck spread wantonly for Harry’s mouth.  Draco was whimpering, and Harry didn’t need to see his face to know that his eyes were squeezed shut.  Draco’s hands tightened their hold on Harry’s arm, which was wrapped around Draco’s abdomen.  Harry lifted his head to look down the front of the lithe body in his hold, his hand gripping Draco’s shirt tighter, lifting it up and out of his way, the fingers of his other hand pumping, faster now, up and down Draco’s lovely little tiny d.  He only needed a thumb and two fingers for this minuscule job.  “It’s so small, I can’t even give you a proper handjob,” he teased.
“It’s a cock, Daddy,” he said, “Daddy’s cock,” he added, practically drooling at the sight of it, before looking up at Harry once more.
The book was battered. He could barely make out the thinly written title. "The Fantasy Diary," he read aloud. He opened the book to find that it was empty-empty lined pages filled it. It was a journal. He closed the little diary and turned it over in his hands. It seemed innocent enough, but he still pulled his wand out and cast the few revealing spells he knew. And nothing. Of course, he knew how dangerous it could be to go writing in a book, especially a book that must have belonged to his father. He decided that a test needed to be done.
Harry headed back into the Great Hall with his head down, trying not to be noticed. The Sorting Ceremony had begun, so most students' attention was now on the first years and the Hat.
"Hey, there you go," Harry was saying, his voice clear now. "You're okay, you're safe, just breathe…"
Draco cursed at him and opened the door. Potter walked right in and turned back around to face him. He closed the door and tossed his bread on the desk nearby, resigned to letting it go stale for now. Potter looked at it in confusion. "Was that supposed to be your dinner?"
"Harry, you don't understand. It's my father," Draco said, his voice cracking. "He's out. He's here."
"He said he's only filling in here for a year and he doesn't want to stay longer than that, and he thought that I should consider taking over the role since I'm skilled at Defence."
"So unfortunate that Malfoy's taken such a liking to you, Potter," said Snyde. "We really wanted to turn him back to our side and you've made that rather difficult."
When he woke properly, he was in a bed. He slowly opened his eyes, a sharp pain splitting his skull, and found that he was in the all too familiar infirmary. He tried to push himself into a sitting position, and heard footsteps rushing towards him.
It was in their compartment, after catching up on the last week and a bit, that conversation eventually turned to Harry and Ginny's breakup.
Lumbering down the platform ahead of them was Hagrid, shouting in his booming voice, "First years follow me! Eighth years, meet Professor McGonagall in the entrance hall! First years follow me!"
"Do you want to take the rest of the class off?" Harry asked. "I'm sure Dumbledore will understand."
"Not so fast," said the one of the boys as he stopped Draco from stepping around him. He looked more closely at the three of them, focusing on the one who had spoken first. He thought he felt some recognition, and then it clicked.
Draco pushed up on his elbow so he could look at Harry in the weak light. "Do you still have that invisibility cloak?"
Turning away from the roiling sea, he saw his father, flanked on either side by the Death Eaters he had seen earlier. Draco scowled as Lucius tapped his cane and cocked his head, looking from Draco to Harry. Draco followed his gaze to see Harry against the wall, nursing his head.
He also might have just pushed away the only true friend he’d ever had. He felt an all new kind of pain at that thought. Just for that new pain, he drew his wand across his arm one more time. Another failure, that's what his friendship with Potter was. And doomed from the start.
He tried not to let his disappointment show as he watched Harry carefully roll his sleeve back down, and then he pulled them to their feet.
Draco could just make out Harry's face in the dark and tried to focus on him, but he was still shaking.
"It's not your fault." Harry took one of Draco's hands and squeezed. "Okay? I'm here for you, and I will be the next time you fall apart, and the time after that."
He caved forward, and then Snyde was in his ear saying something along on the lines of, "Till next time."
"Well, I'd very much like it if you came. Hermione is pushing for house unity among the eighth years, so I thought this is a good way to start off the year." Harry knew he was using Hermione's desire for house unity to cover up the fact that he just really wanted Malfoy to come, but hey, whatever worked.
Harry made a snap decision, picked up his stuff and headed over to Malfoy's bench, noticing that no one else had approached him so far. "Hey," he said as he set himself up.
Harry lazily opened his eyes and looked up at him, and the sight of them unimpeded by the glasses took Draco's breath away. "Depends on you."
They waited. Harry knew a response might not come at all, but he was desperate. After a few minutes, his prayers were answered as the flame reappeared, the same piece of paper reforming. Harry caught it and stared at the message written below his.
Draco snorted. "True." He and George Weasley had hit it off more than anyone could have ever predicted over Christmas, and Draco's love for potions combined with George's endless ideas for new products for the joke shop had led to an unexpected partnership. Draco helped George develop new products - which Draco was sometimes the victim of and would end up with consequences like hair that wouldn’t stop changing colours, much to Draco's dismay and Harry's amusement - and occasionally even helped out with running the shop, though he preferred to be behind the scenes.
The voice came from the other side of the room. Draco struggled to open his eyes and lift his head, seeking out the owner of the voice.
Draco hadn't told Harry about the attacks. They had happened a couple more times now, and each time the three Slytherins left him with a new bruise. He wanted to tell him, but he knew that if he did Harry would want to go all heroics and stop them, and Draco just didn't want to make it worse.
Ron's face only turned redder. "Hermione! You remember all the things he used to call you. You can't forgive him just like that." He snapped his fingers to emphasise the point.
"Got one?" Harry asked when he opened his eyes. Draco nodded. "Alright. When you say the words, don't just say them, but feel them. Let the memory fill you up and then channel it through the incantation."
They had hit him with a jinx out of the blue on his way to the first class of the morning, and so when Draco arrived at Defence Against the Dark Arts he was already tense. He and Harry shared the class, and though Harry’s other friends were in the class too, the two of them had a table together near the back. He had planned to head straight there, but when he entered he saw that the room had been rearranged so there was an open space in the middle.
Harry knew he needed to tell Draco how he felt. There were so many things he wanted to say, but he still didn't know how. All he knew was that Draco meant more to him than anyone ever had, and he needed him to know that.
He heard Harry's breathing quicken and become uneven. He recognised the beginning of a panic attack. He didn't just need Harry, Draco realised, Harry needed him. He needed to pull Harry out, before the memories overwhelmed him.
. That he was being invited to dinner at a Weasley’s house. Dinner with the golden trio. Unbelievable.
He put the original marble on the floor. Light from the window made it seem to glow, and blue-green light fell through it onto the stone.
Auror training had begun to build in intensity with what appeared to be a review of every legal document in the department, and Harry was busier than he had been for months. Some days he didn’t get to see his housemates at all, but every night, without fail, he climbed into bed next to Malfoy.
Draco nudged Harry slightly, and smiled. “I hope you don’t mind me saying this,” he said, hesitating before continuing, “But for someone who works with Muggle artefacts, Mr Weasley is, er, spectacularly misinformed, isn’t he?”
Questions about Potter, and what he has been through, rise and fall in his mind. Draco recognises something in Potter's new-found reticence. It is, he thinks to himself, a way of keeping safe: the world is more peaceful, more empty, without words. Draco knows that he is scared that his own quietness, his withdrawal from others, is actually a lack which runs deeper, that something inside himself is missing, or broken. He wonders if Potter knows this fear, too.
As Draco was beginning to shiver he could agree that yes, it was easy to wake up. Together with Harry he dressed and helped pack up the camp. He was not really surprised when Harry told him to take his morning piss in the woods. With that out of the way, they did began their daily routine: collecting water and firewood, before lighting a fire and drinking coffee together.
Potter shrugged and laughed, and the door sprang open. “Welcome to my humble home,” he said. He stepped inside, with far too much bounce considering their early start. “Your name’s on the family tree upstairs.” Potter looked most cheerful, his merry smile at odds with the sombre hallway.
Which is how Harry and Malfoy ended walking down the stairs to breakfast, both still smiling. Harry’s smile faded fast though, when he saw the line-up of curious faces at the kitchen table.
Standing under a tree, hidden away from the others, Harry watched as his younger self laughed with his friends. They were sitting by the lake at Hogwarts, and the laughter grew louder as Dean pushed Seamus into the cold water. Ron and Hermione sat to one side, Hermione wrapped in Ron’s arms, his head resting against hers. It was the year they had gone back to finish their NEWTs, the year they learned to relax, finally. Beside the tired and older Harry watching from the shadows stood Draco, the expression in his eyes unreadable.
“Ganma! Ganma!” Teddy exploded back into the room, his hair now the same silver-gold colour as Malfoy. In his hands though, was a miniature Harry Potter in Hogwarts robes. Harry was pleased to see he hadn’t been totally usurped in Teddy’s affections.
“You know how we’ve been practising going back to our natural state?” Draco said. “What about doing the reverse? What about encouraging a transformation and seeing what happens?”
“It’s a... lovely place you have here,” Draco said. He cast about for something to say. “Very vibrant.”
“Number three.” Harry sat back, his head feeling clear now. It looked as though there were plenty more than three items on Malfoy’s list, but Harry wasn’t going anywhere. He might as well get this over and done with.
“What exactly are we talking about here?” Harry said. “And you know that most of what’s written about me is absolute rubbish.”
Draco exhaled in what appeared to be relief before meeting Harry’s lips. Harry kissed him, thoroughly and with tongue, an activity that he enjoyed rewarding Draco with, but that Draco seldom earned the privilege of.
“That’s it, little baby, take Daddy’s cock—oh god yeah,” he gasped again as Draco started fucking his own throat on Harry’s cock.  “Oh Merlin, yesss, you were born to take Daddy’s cock,” Harry groaned before exploding into Draco’s mouth.  Draco gagged but Harry held his head firmly, Draco’s forehead pressed to His pelvis.  Finally, he threw Draco’s head off, sending his little whore tumbling backwards.  Harry watched him resign himself to lying on his back on the dusty floor.  Harry leisurely cleaned himself up and tucked his wilting cock away before reaching out a hand and helping Draco to his feet. He cast a cleaning charm over Draco’s robes, and cleared the spit and cum off his face.
The Malfoy library, of course, housed an expansive collection of both fiction and non-fiction books. Anything even remotely related to Dark Magic had been confiscated by the Ministry in the raid following the trial, but the library remained as vast as it ever was. He wondered the aisles, sipping at his wine, looking for nothing in particular. Occasionally, a spine would catch his eye and he would pull it out to take a look at the cover before sliding it back in. He finally made his way to the back of the library, a long and tall row of books spanning before him. He stepped closer, allowing his eyes to skim the titles on the spines. He reached the end of the row, where a ladder on wheels lay attached to the shelves. He set his glass down on the shelf in front of him and ascended the ladder slowly, reading titles that held little interest to him as he went.
“Harry, please…” Draco’s quiet whimper made it to Harry’s ears, and he paused his laughter, eyes locking on Draco’s.
He pulled a bottle of red wine from the cabinet and with a flick of his wand the cork popped out. He poured a respectable amount into his glass. He took a sip, then with a shrug, picked the bottle back up and filled the glass to the rim. He figured he was going to finish the bottle by the time the sun set anyway, and it wasn't as though there was anyone around to be presentable for. He picked up his glass again and let his eyes roam around the room. He'd walked the rows of shelves many times during his self-imposed isolation, and though he didn't feel much like reading at the moment, he set his feet in motion.
Draco gasped, jerking his head up in shock and slight horror as he was greeted by the sight of Harry Potter right there in the room with him. Of course, it wasn't really Harry Potter, and the longer he looked, the clearer that became. The apparition wasn't entirely solid, and the figure glowed at the edges.
But for now, “Open up, baby,” Harry whispered, stepping closer and stroking Draco’s cheek with the back of his hand gently.
That’s how this started.  This.  This was the last time, that’s what he had been saying, about 2.2 minutes before this moment.
Later, Harry thought again, but it came out as a loud moan as Draco sucked and stroked his cock like his life depended on it. There would definitely be a later.  Because Harry doesn’t know how he could quit this.  This. Draco’s holes that opened so willingly and deliciously for him—only for Him.  To hell with complications of the situation.
Draco bobbed his head enthusiastically in response, still huffing and panting through the final waves of his orgasm.  His body tilted forward but Harry caught him, pulling him close, holding him tight around the stomach, one hand rising to hold him gently, almost tenderly, by the neck.
Draco’s whimpers turned to heavy, labored breaths, his head rolling left to right, his lips whispering, “oh god, yeah, please don’t stop, I’m right there, right there, I’m gonna—oh please don’t stop I’m gonna come—ahhhhh Daddyyyy!”  Harry gripped the arching body tighter as Draco ejaculated a load that Harry thought was quite impressive coming from such a small penis.
Draco set the book aside and made his way to the other side of the room. He picked up book after book, some instructional, but most being purely pornographic. He was making himself a nice little pile to carry back to his room. As the stack on the little table by his wine glass got dangerously high, he decided he would explore more of this room tomorrow. He certainly had enough to keep himself entertained for several days. He let his eyes roam the room again in awe. A tiny little book, tucked almost completely out of sight between two books right at the end of a shelf caught his eye. He hesitated, eyeing his already large pile, before muttering, "What the hell," and made his way over, pulling the little book from the shelf.
He reached the top shelf, lingering for a moment. He was just reaching for the wand in his pocket to send the ladder sliding along the shelves when a title just out of reach caught his eye. Surely it couldn't say what he thought it did. He pulled out his wand and gave it a small flick. The ladder shifted just enough. His eyes widened in surprise as the spine of the book read exactly what he thought it did: "The Art of Anal Intercourse." He didn't hesitate, reaching out a hand to take the book from its place, a little thrill running through his body as he did so. He had just fingered the book from its place, hand gripping it firmly to pull it completely out, when to his complete surprise, he felt the entire shelf shifting. And he was shifting with it! He clung tightly to the ladder, a gasp escaping him, as the wall rotated slowly, spinning him into another room entirely. Once the journey was finished, he loosened his grip on the ladder, the book that had triggered the shift forgotten, and turned his head to take in the room around him.
“Hard to believe so much cum can shoot out of suck a little tiny thing,” Harry hissed against Draco’s ear.
Draco’s feet shuffled under the force of Harry’s grip on his hair, but he puffed out a gust of air and opened his mouth to immediately respond, “thank you, daddy…for…for playing with my little d and for letting me cum like that…when,” he paused to take a deep breath, swallowed, wet his lips quickly with his panting tongue and then continued, “…thank you daddy, because I know my little d is so small and I’m clearly made for one thing and that’s to be your fuck hole, Daddy.”
Draco nodded and retrieved his school bag from the corner.  He walked to the door, Harry casting the unlocking spells as he went. Draco opened the door and paused, glancing playfully over his shoulder at Harry and saying, “I’ll miss you, daddy.”
He set the quill once again to the page and wrote, muttering each word aloud as he went, "Harry Potter...on his knees...sucking my cock." He looked down at the words. For a moment, all seemed normal. But then the words were glowing green, sinking into the page before disappearing entirely.
“I’ll miss you too, baby,” he whispered into the silence left behind.  He gathered up his own bag, resigning himself to the fact that there would always be a next time with Draco.  There was no way he could give up this.  Draco. His baby. And all that comes with being his Daddy.
Draco could only watch, his mouth hanging open and his eyes wide, lost somewhere between lust and fear as the very Harry Potter looking figure moved closer to him. This Potter sunk to his knees and his hands literally ghosted over Draco's thighs. Draco couldn't bring himself to stop those hands from lowering his zipper or from pulling his pants down enough to release his cock. He watched, barely aware of his own breathing that had grown so heavy, as the dark haired, green eyed figure opened it's mouth and took Draco into his mouth.
But what to write? "A fantasy diary," he whispered. "A fantasy..." he said. His mind wasted no time in supplying his most visited wank material. His trousers had been tight since he had opened the first book, but now his erection grew to full hardness. He reached a hand between his legs to adjust himself. He groaned as his hand touched his own hard length through the fabric of his pants. Still looking down at the page before him, he couldn't resist the urge to test the book just once more. Maybe, he thought to himself, maybe the journal was enchanted after all. And maybe-his cock jolted as he thought of the pleasurable possibilities, maybe it's the good kind of magic.
Draco was clawing desperately for entertainment. Sure, it was a gift to have his father securely locked away in Azkaban; and when his mother had decided to leave the country for a while in the aftermath of the war trials, he had been delighted at the idea of having the entire Malfoy Manor to himself. But now that he'd been alone and hadn't left the Manor in weeks, his boredom had become an all consuming entity. He had roamed the entire Manor and its expansive grounds, had flown on his broom all over the property, and had even taken to reading The Daily Prophet cover to cover before leaving the breakfast table every morning.
He found himself looking down into a tiny circular library, much brighter than the one he had just left. He almost shrieked out loud as his eyes landed on the person directly across from, but exhaled in relief as he quickly realized it was only his own reflection. He rolled his eyes at himself and quickly descended the ladder, eager to explore this new place. He was pleased to find that his glass of wine was still sitting neatly on the shelf where he had left it. He allowed himself a smug smile as he picked it up, turning to the room around him.
The bell signaling the end of the lunch period rang out in the corridor on the other side of the sealed and warded broom cupboard door. Harry pulled away, pleased to see Draco’s swollen pink lips curved into an adoring smile as he looked up at Harry.
Once back on solid ground, he drained his glass of wine and made his way over to the liquor cabinet to pour another. He pulled the Fantasy Diary out of his waistband. He flipped through the empty pages and felt a fresh wave of arousal roll through him.
He rolled his eyes even as he made the decision to raise himself off the couch and make his way towards the now oh so familiar Library. He didn't particularly feel like indulging in the whiskey-heavy collection, but he had solved that problem days ago by having the house elves move an assortment of wines from the cellar into this room. He didn't like venturing into the lower dungeon-like recesses of the Manor, and he was grateful that he at least he had his little servants to do the job for him.
Dammit. Draco crossed his legs; he didn’t even have the curse to blame for the growing tightness of his trousers. Stupid hot Potter with his tan and his warm eyes. Draco was finding the scruffy look more and more attractive as the days went past.
Draco closed his eyes against the bright sun, and considered his options. His legs ached and his throat was parched, but before he could rest, he needed to know where to go next. Longbottom had been wrong: there were no Bowtruckles in this part of the world to helpfully mark out where the magical forests lay. Instead, Draco needed to rely on his own magic. He reached for his wand, the slim weight of it still a comfort in his hands after all these years. Twirling it lightly in his fingers, he attempted to tune into the energy of the woods around him.
“What did you want to talk about?” asked Harry. He held out his arm, and Little Lady hopped down from his shoulder.
“Fine.” Draco couldn’t believe that he was agreeing to working like a house-elf at menial tasks for no recompense. “But what about money to buy the food to cook in the first place?”
They spent the next half hour with Harry changing the patterns inside his marbles, and watching the white lines spread further and further around the room, a glorious twisting along and up the walls.
"Oh thank goodness!" She said, lowering her hand; she looked as though she had been about to give the door another pounding. "I’ve been looking for you everywhere. In the end I hunted down Claire and Stephen, I remember you spending time with them in eighth year, and they said you were living here with Gr—"
“I used his old school book. It had all these little notes in the margins.” Harry saw again the words
“Blimey, mate, it’s boiling in here,” Ron said when he and Hermione came back upstairs. He took off his jumper and sat on the floor next to Harry.
He tried to keep a spring in his step as they walked through the sleepy town. He didn’t want Henry thinking he was weak.
“She had that society at school. What was it called? PUKE?” Everyone had laughed when Draco had worn one of the badges and danced around the Slytherin common room, pretending to be an over-earnest buck-toothed girl. Mocking her had done nothing to change Draco’s inability to ever beat her marks in class though, and he swallowed down hot shame at his younger self’s behaviour.
“I’ve already asked it. I don’t really mind who answers, but Potter’s ignored me so far. Why are you hanging in Potter’s study?”
Hearing Harry describe the cabin and woods in autumn, Draco knew that Harry was trying to entice him to stay. All he heard though, was the life he wouldn’t be there to share.
“Come on.” Harry led Draco to a free spot. “You must never see the sun. Your skin is so pale,” Harry said, and he reached out to touch Draco’s side. He pulled back his hand before he made contact with Draco’s skin. “Sorry. It just seems to… shine, in the sun.”
When Narcissa smiled, Draco’s heart lifted to see her small spark of pride. So little seemed to capture his mother’s interest these days, and her focus on his career was gratifying, although he was always a little scared that he might, one day, disappoint her. And she had been disappointed enough in life already. As if to make the point, a crash violent enough to make the chandelier above them tremble came from above. Fine dust shimmered in the air, and Narcissa’s face pinked. Whether in embarrassment for the dust, or for her husband’s outburst wasn’t clear. It didn’t matter really.
"I don’t recognise the magic though. It feels… organic. In fact, I’ve never seen a break healed quite like this. For some reason it makes me think of…"
As they grew closer, moving along the low walls marking the lines between the fields, it became apparent that there were at least three or four people inside the main house. Their outlines could be seen at through the windows, arms raised in animated conversation. It still wasn’t any clearer to Harry what they were doing there. Malfoy’s arm shot out, holding Harry back and pulling him down, but his protest died on his lips as he saw why Malfoy had stopped: someone was standing by the barn, looking out as if searching for something. The woman’s eyes swept over them, and both Harry and Malfoy crouched, holding as still as possible. Her eyes moved on, and Harry let out a breath in relief.
Harry took a step forward, his feet leading him back up to where Malfoy stood. Before he reached him though, Malfoy straightened, gave the river one more glance, then turned quickly. He held his head high; there was nothing cowed or defeated about him. Within seconds he had disappeared into the crowd.
“We barely know each other, and anyway I have no intention of joining the sorry list of your former lovers.”
Draco rolled his eyes but obeyed. Potter was still watching him, his eyes intent like they had been after Granger’s owl had arrived.
“I need to let my room out. Cover my rent. Plus my housemates are away, and I need someone to feed the cat.”
"I'm not sure that it would have made much difference to my father, as long as the posters were Muggle," said Malfoy, touching the yellowing paper again. After a moment he cleared his throat and took his wand out. "Fascinating as the topic of teen rebellion is," he said, "I'm here to work." He cast his little object-counting spell again, and began his Blue and Pink spell routine.
"Precisely," said Malfoy. He nodded over at the other portrait, Wrinkled but Saucy obviously having been clean of any Dark magic. Harry quickly switched them over so that Malfoy could work on Middle-aged Vegetable Botherer. "I was hoping that I would find some linked curses, or ones triggered by a single key, which might help explain your difficulties with the house." Malfoy paused to cast another pink bubble and didn't speak again until that painting too had been checked over with both spells. He ran a hand through his hair. "I can't find anything though, and I have to own, I find it most irritating not to have been able to figure this out yet," he took a deep breath. "But I will work it out. I will."
On his way home, Draco brushed his hand along the sun-warmed bricks of a wall, and found himself walking a different road with Harry by his side. Smiling Harry, full of laughter, grabbing his hand and kissing it. Draco stopped walking, and the vision faded. After a few deep long breaths he was able to continue again. His encounter with Potter had confirmed for him that these visions had no basis in reality. Potter could not be more different to the Harry of his visions. In fact he was different enough that for a while back at the surgery, Draco had forgotten about the visions entirely.
Draco kissed him. Harry stopped talking, and held onto Draco. He kissed with a passion that reminded Draco of how he’d flown at school. He kissed as though he was
“I am. But that’s not what I’m talking about.” She gave Harry a small smile. “You like him, don’t you?”
Henry shrugged. “I was doing fine until you came along. That’s not to say that it’s awful having you here, it’s just that for us to be able to stay here, like this, you’re going to need to get a job.”
He glanced up once more. Malfoy had produced a neat line of playing cards, and still wouldn’t look his way. Harry sighed, rolled his head to relieve the ache in his shoulders, and had another go at his own cards.
Harry’s heart thudded in his chest and his fingers tingled and he rocked against Draco, wanting to pull him closer yet. When they parted, their breath made silver clouds. Harry, despite the kissing and the rather tight situation in his pants, shivered again.
Work was the same as always, and it wasn't long before Harry was immersed in going through the new cases which had arisen in the past week, along with reviewing where the current ones were. As he wasn't permanently partnered, he tended to go where an extra pair of eyes and wand hand were needed, and as a result he had a pretty good overview of the department. This led to him being called on for more than just back-up, as he could often make connections that other people missed.
While they drank their tea, with some of Harry’s bread and some honey, Draco was aware of Granger watching him from time to time. Rather than feeling judged, he felt an intelligent kindness in the way she looked at him. Had his experience of opening himself to the trees also opened himself to noticing more about people around him? He was definitely more aware of the feelings in the room than he had ever been before. It felt odd, like he had learned a new language while he was staying with Harry, and could now understand conversations he’d never even been aware of before.
“Well… what if it was… the Room itself? I mean, it has - had - so much magic, it always anticipated our needs and was the most sentient-seeming part of the castle, right? And Hogwarts is already a place with so much magic woven into its very stones, over so many years. But what if it was too much, what if it - the fire and the putting out of it - almost… killed the room?”
Draco yawned, rubbed his eyes, and swung out of bed. Although he was used to early mornings, the sky was grey and barely light. He padded downstairs to the bathroom to pee, then came back up again to his living room to let the owl in. He opened the window and peered over to the right. The owl was still sitting by his bedroom skylight.
“You’re always up in your room, and you’ve not turned your hair any interesting colours for… well, for
“As these are so fresh they should be pliable enough to work,” Henry said. He selected a few well-matched rushes, and laid them out in a neat pattern on the table. Draco watched carefully, eager to show Henry that he was a quick study. The weaving seemed fairly simple to grasp, a simple under-and-over pattern. Henry’s carefree aspect changed when he explaining the techniques needed to make a basket. His body seemed to focus in the task at hand, his shoulders and his arms forming a tight frame within which the action took place. Henry confused Draco: one minute he was walking into a muddy river with his shoes on, the next he was talking with authority and in precise terms.
It was a little boring though, as Hermione had headed straight for the wizarding History section. Harry had no idea whether she was looking for a book to help her research something from work, or just interested in finding out more about the past. Given how fascinated she’d been by Hogwarts’ history, Harry suspected it might be the latter.
Narcissa frowned slightly. She didn’t like to be left alone in the house, but Draco had little choice. He needed to see Mrs Snettisham: he had to clear his name.
“Lucky you ended up with someone like him,” Ron said. “It’ll keep Hermione happy for hours having him to talk to.”
"Because you’re just standing there, and I’ve got a dodgy leg and now I’m drenched in sweat." Draco’s hair was wet – he could feel the coolness of the air on the back of his neck – and his shirt clung to his body in a most undignified way. His leg had buckled twice under him, but he didn’t think Potter had noticed, no matter how loudly Draco had said ‘ow’.
"Sometimes it isn’t about trying." Millicent wasn’t going to let this go, Draco could see that. He’d hoped they would help soothe the hurt of being kicked out of his apprenticeship, but now he felt as though he had to defend himself to them.
Once the door to Robards’ office was shut again, Ron let out a long breath of relief. “My stack’s much higher than yours, I was sure he was going to call me in, too.”
Harry ground his teeth. The worst thing about being stuck to people was that he had to be interested in their conversation. It wasn’t that Linda was boring, he just really didn’t care that much about Jobberknolls. All he really wanted was for Luna to find a cure.
Cooling saliva soothed the newly-stinging skin on Harry’s neck as Draco finally pulled up. And then, still holding Harry down with his body weight, Draco began to remove his own clothes. After tugging away at his t-shirt, Draco moved forward to kiss Harry again, in almost a bite of hunger.  Then he sat back up, pulling Harry with him. They focused on removing their tops, Harry feeling both light and bereft without Draco’s weight on top of him.
Draco sat back during the meal, watching the conversation flow between the three friends. He saw a different side to Harry, one that he recognised from school, except Harry was 30 now, not some half-grown 15-year old.
but Draco elected to ignore him. It was patently clear that Potter wouldn’t know what etiquette was if it bit him on his behind.
She snorted, but smiled and patted his hand before opening her bag and pulling out her notes on Protean Charms. “Maybe you’re finally ready to study without needing me to—”
Harry knew that he was being sent out on another case, and that it would be another week before he could consider going out for lunch. He shook his head, disappointed. “I can’t. Sorry. I’ve got a case—”
Eventually, Draco pulls back, enough to see Potter's face, but not so much that they lose contact. Potter's eyes are clear as they regard him quietly.
“Hmm?” The marmalade really was good – Molly sent a jar down every now and then – and Harry was enjoying a thick helping of it on his last piece of toast.
“Potter.” Draco nodded. He had been just as surprised as anyone when Potter left the Aurors and disappeared from the public eye for a few years, only to return as a luthier, of all things: a maker and repairer of violins. Draco sometimes ran into Potter at work when evaluating antiques, and they could talk to each other politely enough. It had been a long time since they came to blows.
“You’re safe here,” Lavender said. When she spoke, Malfoy seemed to freeze into an even more stiffly-held position.
Draco stared at the folder. He wanted to go back downstairs to get all the wings pressed out, but at the same time he knew that if he did there was a good chance that he’d be preoccupied with wanting to read through the file. He sat back down again, and laid out all the clippings, reports, and photos. Better to puzzle for a few minutes than ruin a day’s work by being careless.
Harry couldn’t imagine having family that grew up to hate and kill each other. Dudley being a bully and even his aunt and uncle shutting him away seemed like nothing compared to Bellatrix.
“I think what Harry’s trying to say is that we’d like to be able to keep using the room. It is a very good space for practising our magic.”
It was disorienting, moving between the mirrors. Harry decided that this exercise was about how they processed visual information. And other information, too: he signalled to Draco to stop, and listened carefully. He could hear someone moving, out of sight, to his left. Draco nodded, slowly, obviously having heard the same noise. They began to track the few footsteps and robe swishes they heard, taking care to remain as near to silent as possible themselves.
“He’s infuriating!” Harry paced up and down. “He asked me where my fish knives were. Hasn’t he seen Greg eat? Why lay the table with hundreds of knives and forks when it’s all going to get shovelled in the same way, regardless?”
“I see now why you’ve been taking Malfoy’s side, Harry,” she said. “It’s more than friends, isn’t it?”
"I should hope not," said Severus from the doorway. "I had a terrible premonition that this day would come, but still, a little... decorum, if you please, gentlemen." Draco crossed his legs and scowled at Harry, who rose to greet Severus.
Potter seemed embarrassed, and Draco guessed that he wasn’t used to having a house-elf, no matter how much he protested that he enjoyed living like a wizard.
Without saying anything, Malfoy turned away, displaying his rather neat posterior, then ran and leapt into the bath, balling his body up as he did so. A large wave of water splashed up, running onto the tiled floor.
They made their way upstairs still bickering about how much Harry was willing to pay for a pair of trousers.
Hermione frowned for a moment. “I think that it must be hard,” she said. “Daphne is always worrying about how other people see her.”
Draco spared a glance at Potter, who had his hand to his mouth and an open look of hope on his face. How did Potter always manage to look so trusting? Draco ignored the twinge he felt at the irrational desire to somehow see that look turned on himself, and turned back to the painting.
. The confusion had turned to disbelief. Harry stared at her, as if waiting for the disappointed look or the concerned frown. “Oh, don’t look so worried, we won’t
Harry smiled when he saw the memory that Draco had selected: they were both sitting on the floor of the sitting room, on a blanket spread with food. Draco had planned a picnic by the river but the heavy rain battering the windows had forced this change in venue.
Harry watched George move around his small kitchen, his movements methodical and calm. George was quieter now, without Fred. He took more time to think his words through before saying them. As he came to sit at the table with Harry, he added, “You’re not quite who you were before.”
Luna came up to see him next. Harry was pacing the room, waiting for Draco to get ready. He wondered if Draco and Hermione had got dressed separately in the interests of making a dramatic entrance, later. They were certainly taking long enough.
Robards was the next person to knock on the door. “So I hear that you’re back in commission, Harry?”
They sat quietly together, and Harry cradled his cup of tea in his hand. As though sensing that Harry needed more space, George moved back to the armchair.
Harry ignored Malfoy. Greg nodded, and Hermione did, too. Ron was drinking his tea, but put his mug down and sighed. He glared over at Malfoy, but nodded. Harry suspected that under the table, Hermione was holding his hand. They all turned to face Luna, who was filling the toast rack with bread.
Harry opened his eyes to see Hestia Jones, Draco Malfoy and Ron standing over him. Draco Malfoy – the surprise extra trainee who had appeared on their second day of training.
“It’s not ideal,” said Harry. “But I don’t want to let my cousin down. And I like your cat. I can try to keep out of your way. I’d like to stay, but if you really don’t want me here I’ll go.”
Malfoy hadn’t been in their bedroom, the bathroom, or the common room before they left. The library was closed - Madam Pince was sitting with Hagrid at the teachers’ table - so there was only one place that Harry could think Malfoy would be.
The cabin was hidden amongst beech trees. Its base was built from large stones, but weather-darkened boards clad most of it, and it sank into the shadows as a result. Above it, vaulted screens of green grew from arched beech branches, and a carpet of old leaves smoothed the forest floor. Draco’s heart felt too-large for his chest as he looked around. He had been imagining a sad little shack, and it wasn’t anything special, but the setting… it was beautiful.
"What? No. It’s from a different stream. It, and the one I wash in, both run into the river at the bottom of the valley."
“I know!” Malfoy’s voice got louder. “Everything in this castle reminds me of the terrible things I did, terrible choices I made. Do you think I don’t think about what I did?
“It's real enough.” Malfoy returned to scanning the valley. “You really do need to focus, Potter. To be perfectly honest, I don’t care if you’re intent on failing or not, but I do intend on passing and becoming an Auror. So while we’re working together, I’d appreciate a bit more of an effort from you.” The words were staccato, each one jabbing at Harry with force. He could tell that Malfoy was pissed off, now, and somehow this was easier than them trying to be civil. More honest.
"I wake up early, with the birds. When the sun comes up. I’ve already got the usual amount of wood, but we need some more."
"I– I wish I had listened," he said quietly. Severus's expression changed, softening as he looked at Harry.
“Madam Pince said something like that, too.” Hannah frowned. “She said that the thing about taking sides is that it stops us seeing each other for who we really are.” She sighed. “I’m not sure I believe it though.”
“You seem remarkably calm, considering that Loony Lovegood and Gregory dimwit Goyle are destroying your house.”
“Oh, darling, you’re home!” His mother rose and threw her arms around him, in a most un-Narcissa way. “I was so worried. We both were.” She held onto his shoulders and looked him over. “But look at you! Your hair needs a good trim, and we need to get you into some proper clothes.”
Trust. Draco had never thought he’d ever hear Potter talking to him about trust. Something – pride perhaps, or a long-seated desire for approval made him sit a little taller. Despite himself, Draco found himself nodding slowly.
“You look fine. And Harry…” Ron paused. “I know I was a bit of an arse about Draco when he first moved in. But I couldn’t forget him calling Hermione a Mudblood at school, and if he hadn’t let those Death Eaters in, maybe Bill wouldn’t need to eat his steaks quite so raw.”
After so many years in the Gryffindor tower, Harry wondered what it would be like to share with people from all four houses. Their trunks were at the end of their beds, with Ernie’s first, then Neville’s, followed by Ron’s rather battered trunk with ‘RBW’ painted over ‘WHW’ on its side. Looking around Harry saw, with some relief, that his trunk came next, but stopped short when he had walked over to his bed and saw who would be sleeping between him and the window: ‘DLM’. Malfoy.
“This charm, and its counter, are both easier to perform on someone else than it is on oneself. First you will practise in pairs on each other, and then individually in front of a mirror.”
Draco ignored the ‘snippy’ comment, and put his tea cup down with a decisive clatter. “Come on, Potter, no more time-wasting.”
He dug his claws into Ron’s lap, then jumped on Harry’s. His fur was short and warm, and Harry smiled as he stroked him, too.
“Sometimes when I’m focusing on one thing - like remembering the words - my concentration slides in another area,” Harry said.
“And whose fault is that? Is this conversation over, or are there any more horrible parts of our past you want to bring up?”
Although Harry had said he wasn’t going to ravish Draco, it was hard to think of much else. “You’re the distraction,” Harry said, kissing Draco until they were both breathing hard and half-rutting up against each other.
Harry pulled the original marble from his pocket, where he’d put it to keep it separate from the rest. “It’s this one.”
Potter let out a surprised burst of laughter, but it had a bitter ring to it. "I’m not French but I can’t vouch for the crazy part."
“They’re for you. We never have enough time for each other, and I wanted to show you…” Draco broke off and ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t think I can find the words for this. Would you…?”
“Are we really going to discuss fabricated stories about merman anatomy?” Potter asked, raking his fingers through his hair. “I’d rather work out where this sodding violin has got to. I’m not sure what’s pissed me off more: the insinuation that I stole it or the idea of having to pay that old bat for it.”
perhaps. He recovered himself quickly though. "Oh for– you try an old teacher exceedingly. You two were difficult enough to deal with at school: two of the most stubborn boys I've ever had the misfortune to teach. I do not want to imagine what you could achieve together." Harry was puzzled at this horror at the idea of he and Malfoy being friendly.
“I don’t think that this is a dream,” Draco whispered. Harry shook his head, eyes wary. His hand though, was moving, softly, gently, through Draco’s hair. Another shiver moved through him; the spring night was cold, in just his thin pyjamas.
They asked him questions, but they took no notes, and the older Auror – Proudfoot – kicked the pile of ashes over when Draco asked if they could do any tests on it.
“Enough with the talking, Potter. Get on with it.” Draco unbuttoned his flies and Harry pulled off his trousers then, a little self-conscious at Draco’s gaze, removed his own. “Potter,” Draco repeated, part impatient moan and part order. Harry settled between his legs.
"Like this," Harry whispered close to his ear, his breath brushing Draco’s skin, and tickling his ear with its heat. "I want to fuck you so hard you stop getting distracted by thinking."
Gingerly, Draco stepped deeper into the water. He took a step, then waited until the urge to scream had passed, then took another.
Draco looked at Luna, at her with her hair already escaping the bun she wore for work, her pumpkin earrings, and floaty purple dress covered in golden stars. He’d given Greg and Millicent a sanitised version of what had happened with Harry, but he knew he couldn’t do that now: it was like lying while holding onto a birch tree.
“I don’t care,” Draco said. “I… used to care. About what everyone else said or thought. And now… it’s not so important.”
Draco and Harry chased the Snitch, urging their brooms ever higher and laughing into the wind. Draco’s skin tingled with cold, and his fingers ached on the broom. But none of that mattered. He scanned the sky, looking for the tell-tale hint of gold. And then he saw it, and with a cry of triumph, Draco dove down only to find Harry crashing towards him at the same time. Their fingers touched as they both grasped the Snitch; then they began to tumble down to earth. Harry, not Draco, righted their brooms, and they swept back down in a wide arc, landing gently on the ground.
Goosander turned to Harry, as though waiting for him to say something, but he just gave a tight-lipped shrug.
"You don't seem able to see the obvious, Potter," said Malfoy. "And if that's not stupid, then I don't know what it is."
Both Harry and Malfoy turned round, at the sound of a small sigh from behind them. It was Kreacher, who moved forwards, stepping past them to look at the tapestry. He stared at it for a long time, then turned back, and looked between them. His face contorted into a kind of grimace, and he nodded deeply, then walked back out of the room.
Malfoy paused, a mix of feelings travelling across his face. Harry didn’t know what any of them meant. “I can’t see how I can say no to you. At least it will give us something to do.”
He was head down, counting his Knuts and Sickles back into his money pouch, when he walked straight into someone else. The bag fell to the floor, coins rolling away. Draco froze, despite himself, as he braced himself for the seemingly inevitable onslaught of images and sensations. Nothing happened, and Draco crouched, eager to pick up his money and leave as soon as possible.
“Respect others’ property. That means,” he said icily, “you do not ‘borrow my shoes’ to go to the corner shop, or use my hairbrush, or eat my food.”
Harry looked back at the magazine. Apparently it was very important to wax your broom at least once a month. Glancing back up, he decided that Malfoy had indeed changed since school. He wasn’t the defeated shadow he’d been during Voldemort’s time, nor was he the arrogant prick he’d been when younger. A smile touched Harry’s lips at the thought of Malfoy sitting in the familiar warmth of a library, reading up on electricity and modern Muggle technology.
“I… I can’t work out what you’re doing here,” Harry said, his frustration in every word. “Why come here? It’s smelly and miserable - I’m bloody freezing now - and the last time we were both here one of your friends died in this room!”
An image of Malfoy, his hair as gloriously frizzy as Hermione’s sprang to mind. “You wish: you’d never achieve her level of hair, Malfoy, and you know it.”
Draco rested his pounding head back against the cool concrete as he struggled to get his breath back, his stomach aching. He knew he had to get up before someone wandered down this hall and found him. He spotted his wand a few feet away, scooped it up and used the wall to push himself to his feet. It made his head pound harder for a second, but with every breath it lessoned slightly. He didn't want to even think about checking his stomach for a bruise, knowing it would be bad.
"I – I'm sorry," he said, panic flooding his brain, and then he was fleeing from the room. Leaving Harry standing there.
No, he realised as he sat down, seeing that almost everyone had what looked like a Daily Prophet news bulletin in front of them. They weren't like the full papers that came in the morning, but rather smaller issues for breaking news.
When Draco woke, he immediately reached out to the other side of the bed but found it empty. Bleary eyed, he lifted his head and looked around the room.
Harry was about to agree, but he thought back on the last time Draco had opened up to him right after the panic attack. He had definitely felt a connection then, even more than just a connection… but then he had pulled away. Draco had made himself vulnerable, and then Harry had pulled away. Curse him, it was his own fault.
The door led out into the room where Draco had stood at the railing with Lucius, having just learned that his father had escaped Azkaban and was planning to release more Death Eaters from the prison. The railing looked out over the North Sea; it was too dark to see much, but he could hear the crashing of waves.
Draco didn't return to his dorm until much later that night. He didn’t really sleep either. His self-loathing had well and truly reared its head again, and this time it wanted to stay.
"Besides," he said, "if you're at Hogwarts, George can't show up on our doorstep at all hours of the night with a new potion idea that he must absolutely work on with you at this instant."
Potter gave him a piercing look, and Draco felt like he was seeing straight through to that hidden part of him. "More than you know. You probably don’t know much about what being raised by my aunt and uncle was like, but… maybe one day I'll tell you, for now I'll spare you the gory details."
Draco was silent for a few minutes. "I get panic attacks sometimes," he finally said. "They always seem to have a trigger as well."
They had woken up in each other's arms as usual, but they had also kissed until it was time to go to their separate morning classes. After which, they had met up here and kissed some more. Harry couldn't get enough of it, and he was so happy to finally be able to call Draco his, even though they hadn't really put a name to it yet. However, he felt like they didn't need it – he knew that Draco felt the same way he did, and that was all he needed.
As much as Draco didn't want to let go of Harry, he was relieved to be able to have a shower and change his clothes. When their friends realised he was back he was overwhelmed with questions, and then he and Harry were asked to speak to McGonagall. They were still trying to sort out what happened with the Death Eaters and while they were relieved that Draco was alive and safe, they needed to know the details of what happened.
They lay there for a while in peaceful silence, watching the leaves rustle in the wind. Draco then rolled onto his side with his head propped up by his elbow and announced, "I have an idea."
A sob racked through Draco, and he could see from the way he looked into Harry's eyes that he needed him too. Desperately.
"Welcome back students," McGonagall began. "I am well aware that this is a bit of a unique circumstance, bringing you few who were eager back to Hogwarts for an additional year, or in some cases to make up for a completely lost year. Therefore, there are some… adjustments to the way your education will take place. Most of your classes will be shared with seventh years, however there will be some specialty classes in certain departments if you wish to take them and opportunities to take on advanced work. As for rules and regulations, you are now adults and so we will treat you as such and be a little more lenient with you so long as you are responsible."
Draco could only stare at Potter. He'd rarely ever had anyone offer to be there for him in his times of need. Every instinct told him to push away any and all kindness, to deal with it on his own the way he was raised to. But where had that gotten him? Standing here in front of him was Harry Potter himself, with his stupid glasses and messy hair and earnest green eyes, just wanting to be there for him. Curse him for being so perfect.
A couple hours passed and Harry and Draco had gotten ready and eaten something, and were now joining Ron, Hermione and Neville on their way to Hogsmeade. Draco had to keep reminding himself not to take Harry's hand as they walked next to each other, but Harry smiled at him like he knew what he was thinking. He slowed down their pace slightly so they fell behind the others, and Harry reached over and gave Draco's hand a squeeze. Draco smiled at him and he saw that mischievous glint in Harry's eye.
Hand in hand they exited the room, not sparing another glance for the mural. If they had, they would have seen flecks of ash falling from the wall and swirling in the air, as Draco's image was restored by the magic of the house, whole once more.
He departed with a wave, and the trio quickly made their way to the castle before the reporters could reconverge.
He walked up to the edge and gripped the railing, watching the sun rise over the lake. It had been a full day now since he lost Draco. If he had done things differently, if he had told McGonagall about the Slytherins, maybe none of this would’ve happened. Or maybe everything would be the same. There was a pain in his chest that wouldn't go away, eating him up from the inside. He didn’t know what to do, or how to go on.
Draco didn't know where he was headed, he had simply felt cooped up in his room and needed some air. And then, of course, Potter had cornered him with a proposal – that they start over. Draco didn't want to admit it, but the gesture meant so much to him that if he hadn't made a quick getaway after shaking Potter's hand, he might've done something stupid.
Harry was getting to his feet, leaning heavily on the wall. "Then let us go. If you have no use for us the what's the point in keeping us here?"
Harry forced himself to slow his breathing, to fight through the pain to sit up and get his feet under him. His legs screamed at him as he stood, swaying violently, and made his way over.
Harry did look like he was still catching his breath after Draco had jumped him, and he was giving Draco a lazy grin that made his heart flutter. With a squeeze of his hand, Draco left him and headed back inside.
He stared at Draco, contemplating the pleading in his eyes. "Only if you promise to be more careful, not to go anywhere alone where they might jump you, and to let me come with you if you have to go somewhere at night."
Draco chuckled and kissed him again, unable to get enough. It wasn't until after the sun had set that they finally came down from the Astronomy Tower.
When it finally died down, Draco captured Harry's mouth in another kiss, this one a little more passionate. Harry felt all the emotion behind it, all the words left unsaid because they understood each other right down to their cores. This was all they needed.
"Why don't you just piss off," Draco spat, and Harry was proud of Draco's tone, if a little stunned.
Draco tried to follow what Harry was saying, gulping down huge breaths. Slowly, gradually, he found he could breathe normally again. He kept staring into Harry's eyes, focusing on the colour, the intensity, as he felt the sensation come back into his limbs and the feeling of danger melted away. He was safe. He was safe because he was with Harry.
Hermione gave him a stern look as if to say not to bring up the battle after Harry just had a small episode. Harry gave her a small smile. "Yeah, it'll be good," he said to Ron. Glancing back up at the teacher's table, he saw that Aberforth – Professor Dumbledore, he supposed; that would take some getting used to – was watching him with a knowing look.
Eventually they migrated from the booth over to the pool table, and currently Weasley and Longbottom were playing while some of the others cheered them on. Draco was stood nearby with Potter and Granger, and they had been chatting about their Potions projects. When they finished off their drinks, Potter volunteered to grab them some more and headed off to the bar, leaving him alone with Granger.
He tried to say Harry's name, but all that came out was a rasp. He took a deep breath and tried again. "Harry…"
"I… wasn't in the best headspace and I didn't know what it would show me, or if it was even operational."
"Draco…" Harry pressed his forehead against Draco's, and Draco felt the relief that Harry was here course through him.
Draco gave Harry's hand a grateful squeeze. They sat there for several minutes, Harry holding Draco close, until his breathing completely evened out. Eventually he raised his head to look at Harry, and he found only warmth and caring in his face.
What better time than now, Harry thought, to bury the hatchet. Maybe they would never really be friends, but if he didn't try, he would never know. And he didn't want to leave someone to suffer on their own, even if it was Malfoy.
Draco eventually broke away with a contented sigh. "What am I going to do if you're at Hogwarts all year?"
Just then, the lady with the food trolley came by, and the two boys bought out half the sweets while Hermione looked on disapprovingly.
Draco stood before it as emotions churned through him. This was the place that he had almost died, the place that Potter had saved his life. He was surprised that it hadn't been destroyed by the fiendfyre.
Harry was very satisfied with how last night had gone. Not only had he come out to the rest of his friends (at least in eighth year, there was still Luna, but he had a strange feeling that she already knew), but it had also been a success with Malfoy. Everyone had been accepting of him being there and had helped to make him feel comfortable, and he knew he owed a great deal to Hermione in particular for that. He had even taken his time getting drinks at the bar so that they could have a one-on-one chat, and sure, Malfoy had felt like that was his limit and wanted to leave afterwards but Hermione had reassured him that their conversation had gone really well.
The next morning, Draco didn't show up for breakfast. Harry tried not to think too much of it, thinking that maybe he just needed some space. But over the next few days during their classes, study sessions and the few meals that Draco came to, Harry noticed that he was definitely being more distant. All Harry wanted to do was connect with him, get through to him, but he didn't know how.
"I don't see how you can joke about this," Hermione said, and she frowned. "Or how this has led to the conclusion that your house is trying to kill you. I'd be more inclined to suggest that you've just let Grimmauld Place get into such a state that it is literally falling apart."
Merlin, he was drunk. He hoped he didn’t remember this ode to Malfoy’s fucking eyelashes in the morning. It had just been too long… not that Harry really looked at anyone. Too busy being miserable. Except now here he was, with charming bastards and lovely lashes all around him.
Draco’s cheeks bore points of colour; he was still angry. “You’ve lived with us for what five, six months? How many questions have you asked about our jobs, Harry? How many?”
“I was always a bit envious of the people you’d taught it to. My father forbade me from even trying to learn it. But I… I’ve tried the charm on my own, and I can’t get as much as a wisp from my wand.”
Henry was staring down at his hand in Draco’s. He didn’t move it away, but rubbed his fingers against his thumb. They made a soft sound, almost lost even in the quiet of the room. “I was using white clay today. It does get everywhere, I know. You should see my studio.”
"Oh, they have. Ron doesn’t like the insects. Hermione doesn’t like that I don’t have the space to put them up. They bring a tent." Potter’s smile changed to something sadder, an old pain in his eyes.
Two hours later, Draco was beginning to regret turning down the offer of help. The day was proving to be hot and uncomfortable, and by the time they stopped again – this time on the outskirts of a town – Draco was sore and hungry.
“I—” He took a deep gulp of breath, his throat tight. “It feels too much sometimes, knowing how much everyone expected of me. Knowing that if only I had worked things out sooner, or…” He wiped away the tears that were now running down his face, one after the other. “But what was the point of it all if we can’t get on with living?”
