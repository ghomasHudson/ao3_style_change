“It’s called slick,” George tells him gently, kindly offering him an arm to pull him off the bed enough to place a thick pad beneath him to catch  the fluid before it soaks the mattress.  “And I know it doesn’t feel this way now, but you’re lucky it is coming so easily and so early in your cycle Harry.  You’ll be happy for it when you have an Alpha.”
I know - that got intense in parts there!  There are parts of this that are world-building and parts of this that are incredibly important to the plot.  This story seems to have gotten away from me a bit and has branched how far beyond what I had originally expected.   I appreciate everybody's comments and I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Burbage carries on, her voice gentle. “Your Aunt Nadia gave your mother a gift.  She was your mother’s surrogate, carrying you, mixing her magic with your Beta parents’ seed. Your mother is still your mother, you carry most of her and your father’s genetic material, perhaps with some small trait of your carrier, but your Aunt Nadia is your Oma and now that you are beyond Stricture you should call her such in respect.”
He’s an Alpha, there’s no denying it, and at first I thought that alone would make me hate him in time…but Bill and I connect on a level that is not just Alpha and Omega and also not just two ordinary people who get along.
Thankfully, there are so few Omegas at Hogwarts that they all have a bit of a break until Susan’s next Season in early November, so they’re all able to catch up on some schoolwork.  The Professors were very accommodating to the Omegas but they didn’t relax their scholastic expectations, so they all had more than enough work to complete.
Susan flushes, glancing around quickly to see if George’s exuberance had attracted any of the other Omega’s attention.
“That’s the first thing I don’t get!” Harry exploded.  “Ron tells me everybody gets to choose which Coven they’re going to join, and sometimes it takes weeks for people to decide.  But no one asked my opinion at all!  What if I didn’t want to be in Hermione’s Coven?”
If Fred pissed him off, and it combined with George getting distressed and Bill feeling really protective, I’m not surprised he dropped into it.
Ron looked uneasy.  “He’s unpresented still, Harry.  I know you guys were born on the same day, but honestly Harry, you were incredibly late to present. We were getting pretty nervous over the last few weeks. It’s…unlikely…that he will present at this point.  It’s rare, but there are cases of permanent Neutrals.”
A palpable silences between the three comes after that with Harry unable to prevent himself from shooting Ron an incredulous look.
a few steps out of the room before Hermione blows past him, stomping away back in the direction of the frog pond.
"Hey, 'Mione," he scoots closer to her, until they're side by side, close enough that they're touching.
There are risks but at least with his broom he has a better chance of getting away from any aggressors.
“Speaking of which,” Ron interjected.  “We let the word spread a bit about your refusal of Boot’s proposal, Harry.  I think you’ll get a break until after your first heat, at least.”
Mum says he and Fred should both sleep through the night, but in case he wakes up, he’s probably going to be worried.”
Harry left flank is brushed right up against Bill’s right and he sighs contentedly at the warmth that is emmanating from the larger man.
“I’ll be right back,” Ron says, and jumps up to eagerly interrogate his mother over the contents of her pantry.
The Slytherin smiles at him, looking as abashed as Harry thinks it is probably possible for a Malfoy to look.
Harry, a sweaty, seething ball of flame under the thin blanket feels like the season will never end.  He has only flashes of cognition, and goes in and out of consciousness for what feels like hours.  Every time he is aware enough to take anything in, George is there, or Susan,  petting him gently, speaking to him soothingly, offering small sips of water that he refuses half of the time.  There’s one point, where they’re both there, George pinning a struggling Harry down by his wrists on the floor while Susan is using magic to rapidly change the sheets.  Absently, Harry notes the high pitched whining sound reverberating throughout the room and belatedly realizes it is he that is making it.   He’s desperate for something, his body clenching and sore, tears coming freely and unabated, but he doesn’t know what it is he needs.
Think about it - as soon as they heard you Presented Omega, I guarantee they started weighing candidates to Bond you.
“Yes, Alpha,” George sighed, gathering himself back up.  He shot a wink at Harry and shuffled over to where Angelina was glaring at him.  Fred turned to Harry, “Please tell your Alpha that while we respect her pace, it does pose some…inconveniences.”
“I don’t mind, it’s better you know anyway since we all keep track of each other.  My cycle is extremely fast.  I enter season for approximately 12 hours every 10 days.  Pre-season symptoms typically last about 24 hours.”
“In the meantime,” Susan continues, glancing up at George and Harry, “let’s have everybody start speaking with their Professors.
George snickered. “Zachy-bear and Susan here have been courting for the last 6 months, since about 5 months after Susan presented.   We’re all expecting the news of their impending nuptials any day now.”
George edges around a few of the Other Omegas, Harry trailing him absently and his grin broadens when he lays eyes on Susan Bones, looking healthier than he’s seen her since Presenting.
Well she’s definitely garnered Harry’s undivided attention now.  He’d never really given a lot of thought to where magic came from or why some people had the ability to tap into it and others didn’t.  Strange, in retrospect, given his childhood in a muggle home.  But after he’d learned about the wizarding world, magic had always just flowed so easily for him.  It just felt like another part of nature - one that only some people were in tune with.
“Alright, alright Alpha,” huffed George, from the ground.  Harry stared at him in shock.  Fred suddenly seemed to notice him.
Ron shifted, a little bit uncomfortable.  “It’s kind of hard to explain.  I guess there are two things really — one is that inter-Coven relationships are led by Alphas and with the exception of emergencies, a Beta really can’t stand in an Alpha’s place when dealing with other Covens.  There’s a lot of structure around that actually.  The second is that if the Coven has any Omegas, they can’t take care of them without an Alpha.  Omegas really rely on Alphas.”
Luna, Seamus and Dean have all taken a step back from the others of Oberon’s Coven and drawn wands, though, to their credit have them all clearly pointed down to the ground, an obvious defense but not an intention to escalate the situation.
She doesn't ask him how he got himself back to normal, even though she must have some inkling that he went to another Alpha for help and he doesn't offer up the information either.
“Everyone’s a little different.  Padma only has 3 a year but I don’t envy her because they last almost 9 days.  Mine comes about once every other month and I’m done in 3 days.”
“Are you sure you didn’t just change your mind?” the words come tumbling out of his mouth, words handstanding over each other while his face blushes immediately scarlet.
“Don’t sell yourself short, mate,” Ron added in quietly.  “You’re a very powerful Wizard. Most Alphas will see you as a catch.”
“It is fairly standard procedure Harry,” Dumbledore told him.  “The COA is a guardian to all Omegas; they only have your best interest at heart.”
“For me too!” Harry replied hotly, face flushed a hot red from the embarrassment.  “What the bloody hell was that?  Who asks their brother to kneel?  And why did George just do it?  Like it was nothing? Merlin, Fred.”
“And to you, Alpha Weasley,” Hermione returned bowing her head and should down just slightly.  She had told Harry that custom dictated the Alpha with the more dominant pack proffer the traditional greeting and the less dominant Alpha return it.
Harry slumps a little more against Bill and he thinks he loses a little bit of time, because while he doesn’t process much, it seems like much later when Bill removes his hand and Harry slowly starts to come back into himself.
After a minute he winds it back up, then holds it out across the table in George’s direction, still refusing to look anyone in the eyes.
“Omegas are Magic’s gift to our Covens.  They bare our children, and are our heart and soul.  An Omega is a treasure that requires our protection.  As the Alphas honor tradition and the Betas honor the Alphas, so do they all now honor the Omega.  On this Samhain, having nourished our ancestors and pledged our vows to one another, let us ask the magic we have called here, to be called forth for the protection of our Omegas.  May Magic grant this blessing.”
Ginny rolls her eyes while Hermione twitches from what Harry can only assume is stifled laugher from behind her book and Harry himself is unable to suppress an amused snort.
She pauses, her hand spasming slightly where it had twisted in the blanket.  Harry reaches out and places his own over it.  “What happened?” he prompts gently.
“You should have told us,” he throws his support behind what Hermione said, but he’s careful to try to direct only calm, sincere emotions in both his scent and his voice.
“Sideways is fine,” he tells her calmly.  “We’ll get there in the end, and if we don’t we’ll try again some other time.”
We need to set up a schedule, and it would be nice if we could find a way to not have to miss any tests.”
“I’ll leave that for another time, but its one of the many advantages Bonding provides an Alpha and Omega pair to better allow Alphas to protect Omegas.”
The Coven discarded the charms over their clothing and Hermione smiled approvingly.  “You all look great.  Let’s do as discussed.  Mingle with the other Covens for now, we’ll meet up again before the Ceremony.”
Fred had asked Angelina to return home to her family as the danger had passed, and the pair had spent much of their time since in each other’s company.
They’re sitting far enough down the table from the younger Gryffindors this morning, so Harry doesn’t experience the nauseating rush he would if he had tested the boundaries of Stricture in the presence of the un-Presented when he somewhat resignedly flips out.  Ron looks somewhat sympathetic but he mostly just looks curious so after a moment of embarrassed grumbling he concedes to his friend’s expectant look and unties the letter.
I was thrilled to get your response, but I didn’t feel, in good conscience, that we could begin courting in earnest until the issue was resolved.”
“Omega’s seasons are different before and after they permanently bond to an Alpha,” George explained at Harry’s confused expression. “The introduction of the bonding hormones to an Omega’s body alters our cycles.  No one really knows why.  Unfortunately, also no patterns to how it will affect any one Omega.”
“It’s hard but I guess there’s nothing to be done.  Ernie even paid for a specialist to come to Hogwarts to advise.  The Healer said that my short cycle is just a natural result of my high fertility and he should be grateful at having acquired such an Omega for his Coven.  Ernie fired the asshole, of course, but Madam Pomfrey had already told me something similar - in much more polite terms - so unfortunately it seems like this is just something I’ll have to learn to live with until I’ve Bonded and my season levels out.”
“Look, I’m not saying you’re necessarily more likely than any other Alpha to go into Fight, but we’d be stupid to not prepare for the possibility or to try to figure out a way to avoid the possibility.
Arthur is at the head of the table, looking wan and tired, although Molly is no where to be seen, and as soon as Harry is awake enough to put two words together, he turns to him, “How’s Bill?”
Ron picks it up from where he’s been standing, a distance away and he jerks toward the pair, only pausing at Malfoy’s insistent shake of the head when he catches Ron’s movement and Harry’s quick nod when Ron looks to him.
“Thanks, Harry.  She doesn’t talk about them a lot, but I know they meant a lot to her.  I think its why she’s a little er…obsessive about her children.”
“Omegas care for and are cared for by the Coven.  As our Alpha has promised, you have our protection.  Omega, will you care for the Coven?”
Startled, and a little dizzy from the amount of irritation emitting from the Alpha, Harry fights the urge to bare his throat in conciliation, instead planting his feet and crossing his arms defensively before meeting Hermione’s eyes head on.
Harry’s frustration cools in the face of this explanation, and out of respect for Ron’s level-headed strategic thinking.
He turns his attention to the ‘proposal’.  It’s formally worded, and requests that Harry ask his Alpha to give her permission for Boot to approach Harry with the intent of courting him.  Harry snorts incredulously as he gets to the brief request after flipping it over multiple times to see if there was any more context as to why a guy he’d never had much of a connection with was suddenly expecting Harry to fall all over himself to date him.  But there was nothing.  Ron makes grabby hands at the letter and Harry thrusts it at him, turning his attention back to his plate and shoveling down his breakfast irately.
George shifted from foot to foot for a second before nodding decisively.  “Come on Potter,” he said, grabbing Harry’s arm and pulling him closer to the exit.  The portrait had just opened up and Harry was just about to climb out when Fred’s voice sounded behind him, freezing him in his tracks.
“Remember, sweet one, this was your idea,” he chides and Fleur subsides, scent not particularly irritated.
Around the table, the occupants are setting down their silverware, prepping themselves for whatever is about to happen.
Harry manages a wavering smile at her.  He nods.  There’s a lot of things he’s not sure about right now, but one thing he is sure of is that he couldn’t have better friends.
Harry blinked, surprised at the request.  Almost against his will he shot a look to Hermione who tipped her head to the side - a shrug, if he was reading her body language correctly.  His decision.  He looked up at the Headmaster who twinkled down at him.
She departs with a wave right before the entrance and the two Omegas walk into a somewhat raucous celebration.
The purpose of the Ball was to allow Covens to interact with each other in the way they would when they were fully-fledged.  It was a practice opportunity, essentially, to successfully navigate Coven expectations and politics in the way they would need to once they graduated and officially joined Wizarding Society.
The fresh air feels freeing to him, and Harry spends some time talking to Ginny out on the Weasley’s cluttered porch.
“What do you mean,” Hermione breaks in quickly, ignoring Harry’s irritation at being interrupted.  “About Nott and Malfoy?  What did they say?  Did they touch you?”
George’s other hand blocks it just in the nick of time and the extra limb retracts grouchily, returning to hang limply from where it dangles oddly beneath Ron’s (natural) right arm, jutting strangely out of the boy’s upper torso.
Not sure whether to scowl or laugh, Harry decides his best bet is to just ignore the whole thing altogether and he turns his attention to the game.
In less dramatic circumstances…well things in the Astronomy Tower would have turned out very different that day, at least, had Harry or George had access to this Potion.
Harry, who had been assiduously avoiding meeting George’s eyes during this conversation that had turned from friendly to unexpectedly completely awkward, couldn’t help but to let his startled gaze fly up at that.  George scratched his head and looked off to the side.
But yeah, when one of them is using their Voice, or they’re angry, or they’re channeling some sort of intense emotion, yeah, there’s a part of me that wants to appease them, calm them, give in to what they want.”
But Bill’s not looking at him anymore anyway, completely caught up in Fleur again, and the older man waves him off.
Harry can tell they come from a high class Potions-shop - they have the stamped seal of an accredited Potions Master affixed to each vial.
Harry and Hermione meandered into the crowd and it quickly became apparent Hermione had a specific goal, as she expertly navigated them to where Fred and George were standing, speaking with some of the other 8th years.  Fred held up a hand when he saw her approach and George immediately fell silent.
“My name is Vincent and although you cannot yet scent it, I am a Beta.  I apologize for being so abrupt with your Alpha, but I find it better for Coven leaders to consider the COA as a less than friendly institution, the more they should fear breaking the law as it regards the abuse of Omegas.”
Harry feels another rush of Magic go through him, and then sighs in contentment at the loopy, peaceful feeling that goes through him.  Lazily, he smiles up at Hermione who has now gotten much closer to him.  Gently she runs her fingers through his hair before reaching down to guide him up by his elbow and letting him lean on her.
“Many hundreds of Wizards have performed detail research into Stricture to try to uncover it’s origins, but the consensus has always been that Magic itself intervened.  There are no known examples of immunity to Stricture, and eventually Wizards learned to accept it’s existence and to alter Wizarding culture to adapt to it.  In time, it came to be considered a gift by many as the newly Presented were able to come into their dynamics without the weight of their familial Coven’s expectations.”
Hermione had called the Coven together about a week before the Ball to discuss how she wanted it to go.
It’s Malfoy who has cleared his throat - of course it is - and the platinum haired wizard is leaned against the wall up ahead of them, arms crossed casually, but Harry spots the other Slytherin’s wand jutting out beyond his robe from where its clutched in his left hand.  Malfoy hasn’t deigned to address either of them any further and hasn’t glanced at Harry once, but his eyes are fiercely meeting Nott’s and Harry can almost taste the bitterness of a potential challenge in the air.  He fidgets uncomfortably and starts to skirt out from behind Nott - intent on getting away from the whole situation.  But Nott has other ideas and, although he doesn’t tear his eyes away from Nott, he emits that low growling sound again and Harry can’t seem to stop himself from freezing yet again.
It seems like there the response might be tied to protective instincts for an Omega that the Alpha feels responsible for.
If he asks me to stand down, I will, but if not, then you bloody hell better start listening to him.”
Harry nods, curiosity and an urge to ask so many more questions pressing on him, but he suppresses his desire for both the sake of propriety and compassion for Arthur who looks like he could use a little of that right now.
She lets out a little growl of irritation at the action and Harry feels his own lips pull back in a snarl.
It’s been radio silence since the trio had sent over the completed Contract to the Slytherin during the holiday.
Harry thinks its a ruse to escape lingering awkwardness until they’re settled in the tent and Hermione is thrusting a long piece of parchment under his nose.
Ron shrugged.  “You’d have to ask him, but I think he thinks Mum and Fred are being overly protective.  His whole life changed after Presenting.  He feels stifled by all the restrictions and I think he misses the relationship he and Fred used to have.  Their bond is…just really different now.  Add to that that Fred refuses to hear courting proposals for George until after graduation….well the two of them have been bickering pretty much non-stop.”
Hermione and Fred are finishing up their conversation and Hermione crooks a finger at Harry who rolls his eyes at the summons, but obeys regardless, giving George a little farewell wave as Fred rejoins him.
Harry’s always loved Molly’s craft, and he can’t help but feel a little bit prideful that his is the only one with such intricate embellishment.
But the Cannon’s Seeker had been at a far lower height and closer to the Snitch when it all began and he comes out of the dive easily ahead, golden snitch gleaming from between his fingers where he held it aloft in a victorious grip.
“Watch it Potter,” Malfoy said, even as he released Harry’s arm after steadying him.  Harry opened his mouth to apologize but a wave of dizziness passed over him again and he swayed.  Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at this, and a keen gaze swept over Harry, taking in the swaying, the sheen of sweat, and the tremors that seemed to pass through him every few seconds.
Harry firmly clasped his hands over his ears and stuck his tongue out at her, crossing his eyes.  Caught off guard she laughed, Ron sniggered, and the tension was broken.
Time, for one, although it’s not a comfortable wait. Another Alpha could Settle you, if you didn’t think it would anger Hermione further.”
Irritated, they proffer the gargoyle several potential candy-oriented password options before ‘Pumpkin Pasties’ finally has the gargoyle stepping aside and they ascend up the circular staircase.
Harry finds himself glad for the honsety - he hadn’t been enthused to be courting someone under false pretense, or even pretenses that were obvious enough to both parties but neither wanted to openly admit.
Presumably this is common enough an occurrence that you would take care to ensure you wouldn’t be caught in such a position.”
And when we make them angry…Fleur, I’m so mad at Hermione but its taking all of my self-control to not go seek her out and beg forgiveness.
He looks up at Hermione with wide eyes.  “I didn’t think about it at the time, but that’s really not like me, is it?  Merlin, Malfoy had his wand out, Nott was acting like a jerk, and I didn’t even reach for my own wand.  What was I thinking?”
She looks at him apologetically at that but he just shrugs.  He’s not keen on the idea of being publicly babysat in such a way, but he’s not oblivious to the ways of the Wizarding World and his lessons with Burbage are giving him more and more insight every day into the limitations imposed by his Presentation.
They’re all quiet after that, for a while.  Harry tries to do some work but his brain won’t focus and the potion wears off after a while, so much he can’t really stand still.  He takes to pacing and that irritates Olive, who eventually loses patience entirely and absconds to one of the adjoining suites.  George sighs at that but lets her be, occasionally knocking gently on the door and stepping in to check on her, but otherwise distracting Harry with small stores and one unfocused game of Exploding Snap before Harry is suddenly sobbing and George quirks an eyebrow up in surprise.
He hit his head pretty hard, lost consciousness for a minute, and Dad thought it would be better if he got checked out.
The four engage in pleasant conversation.  Harry ribs Malfoy for the recent Slytherin Quidditch loss. “Marcus really needed to re-consider his strategy during the last half of that game,” Malfoy says irritably.  “He thought having the Beaters focus on distracting Chang would be a  good enough distraction for me to find the Snitch and win quickly, but instead it ruined our Defense and their Chasers made a record number of goals.  He should have trusted me more.  Chang’s a good seeker but  I’m at least as good as her.  It might have been a more viable strategy if we were playing against Gryffindor, but it was an unnecessary sacrifice against Ravenclaw.”
It’s…pleasant, and mildly arousing to dance with Malfoy so close.  They dance one song and then another, Malfoy occasionally seeking out Hermione and Padma, to check in.  Padma’s melodious laughter floats out of the crowd every once in a  while and Malfoy smiles when he hears it.  In their third song, Harry finds he has been more overcome by Malfoy’s proximity than he thought.  Without conscious thought, he finds himself pressing closer to the Slytherin boy, letting slip, a low, keening sound.  Malfoy’s eyes sharpen and he lets out a subvocal rumble which Harry feels reverberate though every part where they are touching.  The sound is both soothing and arousing and he feels his cock take notice as a low shiver rushes through him.
Never much of a narcissist, Harry considers that perhaps Malfoy’s behavior isn’t about him afterall.
The smile she sends back to him is decidedly watery and Harry purposefully lets himself get distracted by the fire while she composes herself.
Harry hadn’t heard much about the Arrows but he’d been privy to Ron’s obsessive patronage of the Cannon’s for years and had never seen them play live.
Ron looked at least as pleased as Harry felt, especially when the redhead found out they were to see the Cannons vs the Arrows.
If there are any enemy Alphas, we'll be at their mercy or we'll distract our own Alphas with our presence."
“I think I love you,” Harry tells his friend seriously, already ripping the first one open and discarding the card for ‘Albus Dumbledore’ with disinterest - like he doesn’t already have a million of those.  Ron’s already left to saunter down the table and whisper in his brother’s ear.  George has turned to appraise Harry and gives the younger boy a reassuring wink when their eyes meet.
Seamus sneers back at her but casts his eyes down and away in what appears to be unwilling deference.  Dean just looks thoughtful but he nods at Hermione when she looks at him inquisitively.  “What’s the plan Alpha?” Harry prompts quietly, cutting through the tension.
“You’re Omega, Harry.  You did the best thing you could in that situation, and you listened to your instincts.”
Harry shrugged uncomfortable.  Truth be told, he didn’t really, and he was starting to worry there might be something wrong with him.  He’d had his crushes in his younger years, but he'd grown out of them for the most part, and currently no one was really triggering his interest.
He had thought it would be many years in the future, but with the right partner….well, he wasn’t completely opposed to the idea.
“Betas serve the Alpha,” Fred says, “They are the force that keeps our Society going.  As in days in yore, as now, Beta’s obey the Alpha to honor their Covens and protect our way of life.  As the Alphas honor tradition, so Betas honor Alphas.”
There’s quiet for a moment before the strawberry blonde Hufflepuff Beta to Harry’s left leans forward to speak in a rush, “My mother just told me she didn’t give birth to me and instead my Aunt Nadia, who is the Coven’s omega, did! How could they keep that kind of secret from me?”
Fred’s nose is bandaged up and Harry wonders if it’s lack of knowledge of the appropriate spell to heal it or if Fred fails to heal it out of guilt.
But he doesn’t move.  These instincts are new, but strong, and he can tell challenging Nott by physically moving will not make this confrontation go his way.  He glances at Malfoy imploringly, understanding that the Slytherin is somehow, shockingly on his side in this, and even though Malfoy doesn’t forfeit his eye contact with Nott, he can tell by the way the blonde’s lips twitch upwards in amusement that he caught the plea.
At least he assumed it was just a Coven meeting, which she had courteously scheduled on a day when he didn’t have shifts taking care of Padma who was deep into ther season and in such abject mysery that the experience of it dogged most of Harry’s waking moments.
But they come to us with only a single candidate? None of us should be comfortable with the assumptions they were making about you and your willingness to go along with things.
The more he learned about the expectations of the evening, the more he both dreaded and looked forward to it with a type of morbid curiosity.  But before the Ball, they had to get Susan and George through their Seasons.
“When I first moved back from America, I was invited to the Courting Ball of the daughter of a family friend.
He looks at Angelina, rearing for a fight, wand clasped in her hand and eyes glittering with rage as she gazes at Ron.
They waited in a brief crowd before Travers proffered tickets and loosed the group on the fields around the Pitch, where vendors had set up shop with their wares prior to the start of the game.
“Yea, I thought that whole scene in the Common Room was particularly weird.  What does George think about all this?”
The resume their walk and Harry doesn’t say anything to Belle, figuring she’ll talk to him if she wants.
He was using Ron as his example - the boy had impressed him recently with his even-keeled response to things.
Harry crinkles his brow, moved by the sincerity of Oberon’s words but still not sure what he was forgiving them both for.
“You haven’t really Courted anyone yet,” she says, “so most of your interactions with Alphas have been with people you don’t trust, Hermione excluded, obviously.
Susan shakes her head.  “No.  Well, at least not exactly.  It was more of an insight into a potential future.  Something that could happen.  When my great-Oma was in his first season following my grandmother’s birth, at its height, my great-grandfather saw a premonition of his mate having loving sex with his Second.  It was not the first premonition he had experienced with my great-Oma, so he knew the vision could become true.  He flew into a jealous rage.  My great-Oma didn’t make it out of season alive.”
“We’re a family,” Hermione said firmly and Harry smiled and nodded, reaching out to clap a hand to Ron’s shoulder.
Oberon lips widen against his in pleased delight and he maneuvers a hand up to clasp Harry’s chin, pulling him up to press tighter against his mouth before he parts his lips and invades Harry’s own, slowly pressing Harry’s mouth open until the other man’s tongue is inside his mouth and Harry lets out an aroused little whimper.
“Er…how often does it come Susan? I mean if it’s not rude to ask that,” Harry stammers, oddly fascinated.  Susan shrugs.
Harry felt a little wrong-footed at the non-sequitur but he took a second, gave it some thought.  “I guess…I haven’t really thought about it, but yea, Wizards definitely have way less kids than Muggles.  When we were younger, I kind of thought that there just a bunch of other schools where the rest of the magical kids were but….I guess the Triwizard Tournament kind of opened my eyes.  There aren’t many more schools, are there?”
The man handed him the address and looked at the boy expectantly.  “Best to memorize that now Mr Potter.  Just in case you should misplace it.”
“I want you to treat me like your brother, not just your Omega,” George finally answers, voice soft.
“I was hoping you might have some free time today and would be willing to speak with me awhile,” Travers says, eyes locked with Harry’s.
Perhaps five minutes, depending on the strength of the Alpha in question and the relationship between the two parties involved.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You can’t go to the COA over an Alpha asking his Omega to consider a reasonable proposal from a viable Alpha.
Ron, without a word, held out his hand for the pendant.  Hermione handed it to him and he cast the spell with quiet efficiency, his gaze intent on the pendant cupped in his left hand even as his right hand moved his wand in a competent design.  The pendant floated off his hand after a moment, glowing a light purple hue before dropping back into his palm.  Ron, more solemn than Harry could frequently recall seeing him, looked up at him and met his gaze. “I’d do anything for you mate, anything.  You were always my family, but welcome to the Coven.”
Seamus and Dean snicker next to him and Luna just shoots him that indecipherable smile of hers.  Harry shrugs and plops down on the sofa next to Luna.  “So what do we do here, Alpha?” He can’t help but exaggerate the title just a little bit in teasing and Hermione’s lips twitch before she visibly attempts to recover some solemnity.
Abruptly, George stood up. “Let’s go for a walk,” he said, and started walking towards the portrait entrance.  Angelina’s voice sounded from across the Common Room. “George, you’re under guidance not to leave the Common Room right now.”
They both got a few hits in, Fred’s got a broken nose and Bill’s got a nasty gash on his arm from where Fred knocked him into the corner of the table.
As he re-acquainted himself with the magical world in this new context, he played it smart.  He didn’t go places alone.  It wasn’t hard to avoid solitariness - there always seemed to be a member of the Coven nearby.  Harry wasn’t sure if Hermione had ordered it or if they were just organically looking out for him, but either way he appreciated it.  It meant he didn’t have to feel like a child asking for an escort every time he left the Common Room.
“I’m familiar,” Harry noted dryly, before signing the sheet swiftly, tamping down on his wince and handing the quill back.
The man is funny, after a fashion, and fairly laid back, which is a relief after the intensity of their courting conversation.
Harry opened his mouth eagerly but Ron rushed on, “And no, I think I’ll let OUR Alpha talk about that with you.”
Olive is looking a little guilty.  Harry’s not really interacted with her in the past and he gets the feeling that she’s not normally so sharp.  He thinks he probably would be in a similar mood if not for the potion Hermione had so thoughtful provided during breakfast.  He decides to give her another chance at a first impression after this whole ordeal is over.
“Oh? Did he say what about?” Harry questions.  “Nobody’s quite sure, but Zabini is trying to smooth things over,” she said, nodding her head slightly in the direction of where the two Slytherin’s were engaged in a hushed conversation.
“An Omega?” Harry asked, somewhat dazed and also feeling suddenly exhausted, eyes drooping as he struggled to maintain eye contact with his friend.
She casts the Patronus while Harry anxiously considers using his Firebolt to run a sweep of the property.
Harry nods at her, before resuming his walk to Remus, raising an eyebrow in inquiry to the former Professor.
“Harry,” Hermione says softly.  “You should know that Mrs. Weasley had a similar conversation with me about you.”
“Far be it for me to order the Golden Boy about…” Malfoy starts and Harry rolls his eyes at the other boy’s droll tone.  “But maybe you shouldn’t be wandering about the castle when you’re so woefully ignorant?”
Hermione’s hand stills from her plucking.  Everything in the Alpha seems to go taut.  “Harry,” she says, her voice a soft warning.
One of them is Gareth Greengrass III, as he had embarrasedly introduced himself, looking awkward as he told them to just call him Gaz.
He plucks at some grass distractedly before wiping his hand on his trousers and pulling a knee up, throwing an arm around it to pull it close.
“I love Quidditch, but it’s flying itself that brings me the greatest joy,” Harry tells the older man after a moment.
Once the other boy has turned the corner in the path leading back to the house, Harry releases a shaky exhale and allows the tears that have been threatening to fall, raising a weary hand up to his face to cover his eyes in a gesture of self-comfort.
“I mean thats the point obviously.  Not a lot of omegas getting laid around here though, what with the over-protective professors and Covens.  Mostly we’re just restricted to the Omega Quarters until the heat passes.  Other Omegas can visit, but the quarters reject all other dynamics.  I’ll show you later, they're nice.  We all get our own room but there’s a common area as well.  It’s not all bad Harry.”
“It’s awful to be unpresented Harry.  He’ll probably never understand why he feels so left out and why he can’t seem to get ahead in the world.  Since everything is done via Covens, people will go out of their way to exclude him from parties, companies, anything where they would be prevented from interacting according to their true dynamics.  He’d be living a lie and he’d never know it.”
At the removal of her hand, Harry feels his mind start to clear, but his body is behind the curve.  It’s several minutes before he feels normal again.  He can’t bare to look at his friend.  He’s surprised to find himself shaking.
“Don’t start,” George commander curtly, rolling his eyes.  “My brother appears to think I’ve lost my wits as well as my manhood - no don’t look at me like that Harry.  I fear my twin has devolved into nothing but a protective brute, no sense of fun in that one ever since he Presented.”
Hermione’s gaze softened as she locked eyes with him, reaching out the grasp his hand gently.  “Ron is my Second, Harry.  And my Sponsor is Mrs. Weasley.  I am an Alpha and as your closest Alpha friend, you are expected to join my Coven, which is why Madame Pomfrey is letting me stay with you right now.  The COA is the Council of Omega Affairs, and if they are sending a representative to talk to you, I would prefer if Mrs. Weasley is present to provide me guidance.  I’ve never registered an Omega before. ”
Harry chuckles.  He’s always had a polite relationship with Susan but never much more.  It occurs to him suddenly that he has something in common with only a very few other people and that its bonding in a way he hasn’t really felt before.  He sends her a concerned look. “You feeling okay there Bones?”
They break things off regardless, speaking in low tones to each other before Tonks laughs and turns away, heading back up to the house with a “Hi’ya Potter,” as she passes.
“First, everyone is on their best behavior.  The last thing we need is to be squabbling amongst ourselves or getting into it with any other Coven in such a public setting.  If anyone says anything to offend you, bring it to me before you react and we’ll decide what to do together.   We’ll pair up.  Harry, you’re with me for the night.  As Alpha and Omega we’ll have some additional responsibilities the night of the Ball in meeting with the other Alphas of the Hogwarts Covens and no one will be impressed if I’m perceived to let you wander around without my protection with so many Alphas in attendance.”
“There are other things we can do,” Hermione says calmly.  “There are things that help with the pre-season symptoms.  Sugary foods, heating pads, some potions.  I’ve asked Snape for some time in the lab to brew some of those and he agreed with only a minimal amount of belligerence.”
Oberon catches his stare and, smirking, begins to slowly move his thumb back and forth, purposely averting his gaze to look at the game.
Unfortunately, when the two Omegas manage to track down Bill, he is engaged in what appears to be a somewhat furious conversation with Fred.
“Eh, we all have ‘em, Harry.  Lasts a few days to a week.  Starts pretty similar to what girls describe as PMS - get more irritable than usual, craving for sweets, body gets a little sore.  Then, ehm, well, might as well just break it to you … you’re gonna get bloody horny mate.”
It’s not a tone Harry is accustomed to hearing from his former foe and it draws him up short, washing away at least a portion of his irritation.
“Harry,” Hermione said, looking him straight in the eyes.  “I have something that must be done.  It cannot wait.  Usually Alphas introduce their Omegas to their Covens right away and also explain a little more about what you can expect as a newly presented Omega, but I have no choice but to postpone that until I return from my task.  Can you be patient with me?”
He had even returned to the room he shared with Harry very late last night, long after it would have been appropriate for Harry to try to strike up a conversation.
There’s more than one viable Alpha for you that could still help with the war effort that you might have a chance of getting along with better.
Later, George will tell him that his behavior is entirely normal for an unbound Omega who has not been exposed to Alpha pheromones during a season.  Later, he will witness other Omegas in this dire heat and see his own torturous experience reflected like a mirror.  But for now he feels isolated, alone, even in the presence of the other Omegas, and desolate, assured of the futility of the fight and yet unable to give it up.
Harry shivers in the cold and Oberon absently pulls him closer, tucks him into his side, warming him with his body heat.
“I had a feeling we’d be doing this in the next couple of days,” George tells him about 15 minutes later as they head over to the Omega Quarters, each of them pulling out one of the requisite books and whispering the password to the bored looking King.  He’s slightly discomfited to find they aren’t alone when they enter.  Susan Bones is there, as is Padma and a sixth year by the name of Olive Hornby who, in spite of being younger than Harry, had presented almost a year before him.  Olive is a brunette with eyes that match her name.  She’s short but slim and her face is all sharp angles with a startling scar across her right cheek, in the shape of a burst star.  She’s a Ravenclaw and he doesn’t know which Coven she’s a part of, but then he’s not as clear on the Covens that have started to develop in the younger year.
Hermione nods, clearly having expected the question.  She appraises them all with a slightly raised eyebrow before continuing her slow pacing.  Harry smothers a snort when the ball of light dashes up Luna’s back.
Not able to effectively fight his blush, Harry turned to the woman, offering his hand to her as well.
George, looking unbearably grateful at his younger brother’s intervention, subsides, crossing his arms again, this time in a defensive posture.
“Look, Draco has a lot on his plate,” Padma says, as she rushes around the Quarters collecting her belongings.
“Kiss my ass, Weasley,” Harry replies tersely.  Ron lets out a noise and Harry shoots him a suspicious look but at this point Ron’s got his expression schooled and has fixed Boot with his signature friendly but not exactly impressed face.
And while he enjoys watching when the opportunity presents itself, he doesn’t follow the leagues the way Ron does.
Harry hums in agreement and Bill tugs on his arm a little to gently guide him to the side of the sofa that Fleur isn’t sitting on.
But George is not to be deterred.  “As if I would give any of these Alpha cads my attention,” he dismisses.  “One only has to look at Susan for a reason to stay away from Alphas.”
“It wasn’t because of all the angry Alphas in the room? Pushing you to do it?” Ron presses, tone reluctant, and Harry fails to suppress his irritation.
They’re fortunate that Hogwarts always has students return to school on Fridays, leaving them the whole weekend to get back into the swing of being at the castle before having them attend classes again.
now and Harry is already feeling less keyed up, though now he has the distinct feeling as though he is teetering on some kind of edge. There’s a risk he could fall right in or he could somehow pull back, avoiding the precipice.
I was privately tutored for the rest of my education and I slowly began to form my own Coven as my uncle made introductions with some of the other families.”
“Logistics, Harry darling.  Can’t leave Omegas alone during season.  It won’t be on purpose but we’ll hurt ourselves.  We take it in turns to watch over each other.  You can return the favor by helping out with my season next week and Susan’s in a few days.  Once we know more about your cycle, we’ll put you on the rotation.  The professors work with all of us to make up any missing work.  There’s only eight of us, and we all have different classes and activities with different responsibilities so we have to communicate quite a bit to make sure everyone’s covered their whole cycle.  Luckily, we don’t tend to overlap very often - except for Susan of course since the poor dear is constantly in season.  One person can hypothetically be the sole support, but we all like to have a floater to step in and help with things every once in a while.”
“You’re a lifesaver, Bones,” George tells her appreciatively.  Harry’s not really following the interaction, currently eyeing the candy just out of reach of where he’s sat and clearly debating ignoring George’s advice.
“Mister Travers,” McGonagall says, “while I appreciate your efforts here, I am afraid that the school cannot, in good conscience, permit Omega Potter and Alpha Granger’s Coven to leave the grounds.
As he comes back to himself, he feels himself growing tense, emitting a sour scent of fear, and Ron and Hermione both edge their way beside him, not so subtly digging elbows into ribs to move obstacles out of their way, and Hermione’s scent is growing bitter with rage.
Ron isn’t often serious in this way, but when he is, it was always about something important and often something neither of the others had considered.
Flushing, Harry eyes it for a minute, not accustomed to anyone showing him this kind of physical interest.
“Thanks Dean. I’ll make a run next time I’m in Hogsmeade.  Now, this is Harry’s first Coven meeting and he’ll be our first order of business.”
George turned, uncharacteristically flashing her a sneer. “You can tell my brother Harry and I are taking a quick kip out to the Quidditch pitch.  It’s been a while since I’ve flown.”
Your Omega is reacting, lashing out and creating physical pressure to absolve things with your Alpha.
“Two things - one, you’re a powerful Omega, and, based on the history you alluded to yourself, there’s good reason to believe that you might be the most powerful Omega on the market.
Not only in the relationship between our Covens, but these particular Portkeys are reusable if not triggered, so we’ll ask for them back when we return this afternoon if you each wouldn’t mind terribly.”
He hadn’t realized until the prospect had seemed to dwindle how much he’d been looking forward to courting the boy.
The Healers kept him the night for observation but he sent word this morning that he’s been discharged and he’s decided to head home and spend the rest of the holidays with some of the rest of the Coven.
Fred’s already pulled out his wand, clenching it in a tight grasp atop the table, clearly in the other Alpha’s sight.
“It’s called the Stricture.  It’s ancient magic, passed down from our earliest ancestors.  There’s no Wizard on Earth who can break it and many who have tried.  It basically creates an information barrier between those who have presented, as you just have, and the un-presented, what we refer to as neutrals, mostly children below the age of presentation, muggles, and the rare magical person who lacks a biological secondary gender.  The information barrier does not allow us to even use the terms Alpha, Beta, and Omega in the hearing of a neutral, and it prohibits us from showcasing Coven relationships in their line of sight.  I am sure you have noticed that your friends have been a bit more closed-off to you this year, my boy.  That wasn’t to be cruel, but it is because you are one of the youngest of your year, which means that while everyone else has been negotiating the terms of their Covens, you have been…enjoying the last taste of your childhood.”
They all chuckled lightly, Harry smirked a little in response, rolling his eyes a little when he caught Ron’s gaze.
Three days after Harry completes his first Season, Susan enters pre-Season and falls into a full cycle by the following morning, by which time George has fallen into pre-Season himself.  Harry volunteers himself to support Susan during the height when all the Omega’s meet to discuss schedules and they all negotiate times to cover George during his full 3 day cycle.  Olive takes several shifts as well, and while she’s much more polite to Harry than she was at their first meeting, he still can’t say he’s incredibly fond of the 6th year.  She’s got a sharp tongue and a strong opinion on how to do things, while Harry’s always been pretty laid-back.
Vincent stood abruptly.  “Well that’s that then.  Best of luck with your new Alpha, Mr Potter.  Call if you need.”
And personality, maturity, experience with Omegas…all of these things seem to be things that indicate whether an Alpha is susceptible to it.
He had never quite heard the older Weasley sound this way before.  “Kneel, Omega,” Fred said icily and Harry turned back around to see George smoothly sliding to his knees.  He heard the portrait slam closed behind his turned back.
“Come now, Ronnikins,” George chides, making eye contact with Fred for a second before they both, as one, set down their hands and affix their younger brother with identical stares.
“I can’t tell you about Coven dynamics without your Alpha’s permission Harry,” George continued, voice soft, eyes flashing when Harry was about to interject, “BUT, nothing is stopping you from keeping your eyes open; what with you being newly presented and all.”
“Yea, that doesn’t sound very sure.  I don’t know Boot, what can I say, I’m a romantic.  I appreciate your interest, but I think I’ll wait for a courting proposal from someone who is actually invested in me as a person instead of just my gender.”
The redhead Omega is tiling the potion back and forth with the tip of his finger, clearly thoughtful.
He has a chiseled clean-shaven face with a strong jaw and sun-kissed skin, entirely unblemished with the exception of a faded scar, perhaps an inch long, cutting down across the left-most part of his right eyebrow.
Oberon and Harry set off in one direction with Leo and Ron trailing slowly behind, caught up in their own conversation.
“Omega spot.  It make Omegas submissive.  It’s called gentling. It can … it can hurt you, Harry.  It’s very dangerous.”
Hermione rushed on. “It’s okay Harry, really.   Omega’s aren’t allowed to directly inherit, instead everything goes into a trust.  Whoever the Omega pledges to as Alpha has access to the inheritance, but the intention is that it be held as a dowry for whoever you eventually decide to bond with.”
“Omega Potter,” Fred said, reaching out pointedly, “a pleasure, as always.”  Taking the hint, Harry offered his hand which Fred pressed to his lips briefly.  Harry fought a blush even as he distantly noted a similar greeting happening between George and Hermione.  The other 8th years that had banded around slowly disbursed, allowing the allied Alphas to speak privately.
Hermione stops and lets him sit on that for a minute.  Honestly, Harry’s mind is spinning.  He mulls it all over, while Hermione picks absently at the grass.
Malfoy waited until she had grasped Harry’s arm before withdrawing.  “Congratulations are in order, Granger,” he murmured quietly, nodding his head in a small gesture of respect.  “May Merlin smile on you and yours.”
Suddenly, the party goes still around them, in the way everyone freezes when a glass is broken in a crowded room.  After the first silent moment, the crowd twitches in the direction of whatever is happening behind Harry and he whirls around to find Susan on her knees in the dirt in front of Zacharias Smith, quaking with fear but otherwise frozen.
Her hazel eyes, set in a round face, are narrow and similarly intense, staring out at the trio in an assessing fashion.
George shifts uncomfortably.  “Not exactly.  Pre-season, sure.  You have to fend off more advances, Coven has to be more on guard, but you can still live your life.  In season? Nothing matters except mating.”
Before Fleur can answer, however, Bill glances up at Harry and freezes instantly, obviously simultaneously taking in the distress he’s emitting.
Now Fleur is blushing under the intensity of the gaze Bill has levelled on her and Harry makes a beeline for the exit, only providing a quick affirmative to Bill before he makes his escape.
“So we figured there was a not insignificant chance you’d present Omega.  Which brought up a few concerns.  The first was your inheritance…”
He should drink the Muzzle now, to be safe and ensure that if there is a confrontation he won’t be a liability, but its also such a precious advantage that he doesn’t want to waste it if this is not going to escalate into an attack.
He looks heartbroken by Ron’s words, and now his eyes have locked on to George who has maintained his arms-crossed defensive posture and emitting a non-stop wave of distress pheromones.
Hermione looks like she wants to be amused at this but her scent is still potent with anger so she’s frowning when she tells him, “Empaths are born with a genetic magical condition in which they pick up upon, process, and recalibrate emotional energy.
“However, it seems that there needed to be a balance to Coven life driven by dynamics.  Young, un-Presented Wizards had no decisive role in Covens and Covens frequently attempted to groom young Wizards into the Dynamic that their Coven most desired, in spite of no connection ever being proven between a Wizard’s presentation and the manner in which they were raised.  Coven members would try to install distinctly Alpha or Omega characteristics into un-Presented children who were destined to Present as Beta.  Slowly, overtime, something started to happen to Presented wizards - they started to find themselves unable to use Alpha voice or Coven magic on the un-Presented.  At first, it was only the Voice and the Magic, but slowly Alphas found themselves unable to discipline Omegas in front of the un-Presented or to even discuss Coven matters with their children.
“Full house,” Susan muses.  “You’ll both need the help and Emma and Polly have that Herbology test coming up.  I only have classes until mid-afternoon, so I’ll come back and we’ll assess.  If I have to miss Potions tomorrow morning, I don’t think that’ll be too much of a problem.”
“Yes, an unlucky burden,” Oberon responds, fingers smoothing over the robe covering Harry’s hip, as though in consolation at the ancient wound.
Ron shrugged, looking uncomfortable but not angry.  “It’s fine.  I’m getting used to it.  Mum and dad talked to me and Ginny about it too.  After all, they had 7 magical children which is pretty much unheard of for an Alpha and Beta pair.  Mum told me her family, the Prewetts have always been blessed with better fertility, even among their Betas.  Most of Mum’s family was killed in the last Wizarding War, but her parents were a Beta and Omega pair and had five children.  So as long as Ginny and I end up pairing with an Alpha or Omega, we have better than average chances of being able to have our own kids.  It’s not guaranteed of course, but it’s nice to know.”
This ends up being correct and after George has experienced it for the first time, he whimpers out pleas for Harry to cast it again and again.  Harry does so, but more sparingly than George would like as he doesn’t want it to become too much of a crutch.  He teaches the spell to Polly, who quirks an eyebrow up in impressed surprise.
To his credit, Malfoy drops the veneer of irritation and has the decency to at least look uncomfortable.
The redhead steps back toward the plant he’d been pretending to examine, this time dropping the pretense to instead openly watch the pair with a protective gleam to his eyes.
“You do,” Vincent confirmed again.  “And you also have the right to call in the COA if you feel your Alpha has crossed any lines or that the Coven is an unsafe environment.  We are your official advocates, and trust me, Harry, we will do right by you.  I will leave you my work address and you may always reach me by owl post or, in dire scenarios, Floo.”
“What happened?” he demands of Ron, hand gripping George’s, instinctively wishing for contact with the other Omega.
“Of course you can, dear,” Padma says distractedly, not looking at all put out by the outburst.  She’s pulling her book bag over her shoulder and heading back out to the portrait entrance.  “I’ll be back after my morning classes.  Can’t afford to miss Transfiguration.”
The rest of the school was aflutter with talk of the upcoming Coven Ball, slated to be held on Samhain.  The existence of the Ball itself was a bit of a surprise to Harry - it would be his first time attending, of course, as only Presented students were invited to attend.  Ron and Hermione had guiltily admitted that they had ditched him to attend in the year prior.
Harry shoots a look back to his friends, but they seem completely engaged in conversation with Leo, Ron laughing brightly at something the Alpha had just said.
“So what you’re telling me is that I’m your second choice,” Harry cuts in, raising his brows high as he waits for Boot’s stumbling reply.
“Fred presented Alpha about a week before George presented Omega, so there was already a Weasley-sponsored Coven by the time that Hermione and I presented,” Ron told him as they made the walk from the Hospital Wing back to the Gryffindor Tower.  “I presented Beta first and I figured if Hermione presented Beta too, it would be easy to mesh into Fred’s Coven.  It’s not unusual for siblings to stay together in their Fledges, and Hermione gets along with them pretty well.”
into his scent and he thinks he may be at least marginally successful as a little of the tension eases out of Hermione’s scent.
But Fred didn’t make a conscious choice to reach out and pull on the magic available to him, he just did it.
“Careful,” Fred snapped and for some reason Harry felt himself shrink back, intimidated, eyes cast down.  “Go find your Alpha, Omega.”
Harry stifled a noise of discomfort as he shifted on the bench he was sharing with his Potions partner.  Hermione cast him a quick glance as she processed the not quite successfully muffled sound, then focused again on the rather complicated brew in front of them.  Harry tried to powder the horn in front of him as finely as required by the recipe, but his hands were trembling and he knew he was fighting a losing battle.  With a sigh he nudged his work over to Hermione who gave him a somewhat aggrieved look but took over the task without complaint.  Trying to make himself useful, he ignored his sudden chills and the way that his body had suddenly started to produce an unusual amount of sweat, and stood up to go gather the next batch of ingredients.
Hermione and Ron are, thankfully, outside the library, engaged in a quiet but clearly heated discussion when Harry approaches.  Hermione glances up with blazing eyes before she takes in that it’s Harry standing in front of them.
Oberon’s quiet for a second, also watching the commotion as all the team members fly in to strategize. “Oh, well, I didn’t want to antagonize the woman.
“That was remarkably non-specific, Malfoy,” Harry sighs, tucking the contract into his robes and reaching up to briefly touch his temples with the fingers of his right hand before dropping them to view the Slytherin squarely.
“Which you can do after Mr. Potter has had some time to rest,” the healer interjected. “His body is undergoing a fairly dramatic change and the sleeping draught I just gave him will allow him to process those changes with the least amount of discomfort.”
It’s phrased as a suggestion, but there’s an edge to Malfoy’s voice so Harry nods.  “Yea, I think I will.  See you.”
he commands, making both Omegas in the room shiver, and George’s hand shoots out in blind obedience, almost knocking over his tea in his haste.
“Today we’re talking more about the history of Stricture itself,” Burbage is saying at the beginning of their fourth session.  The prior two sessions had covered first the structure of most Covens and second the typical progression of Fledges into adult covens.  In spite of how dubious Harry was of the sessions with Burbage, he could admit that the information had been useful.
The school has been transitioning young Wizards into this strange new dynamic for years and for the most part, they have it down pat.  There’s a basic education class that Harry, like all of the newly Presented, will have to attend for the first 6 months of presentation.  Apparently they start the class anew for a fresh cadre of students every 6 weeks for anyone who presented in the prior cycle.  Harry is fortunate enough to have presented right at the tail end of the cycle, so there’s a new class starting about a week after he Presents.
Hermione looks up at him, meets his eyes squarely.  Then something shifts.  The sense he has of her as an Alpha suddenly increases, and the feeling hits him hot and heavy.  Her eyes, usually a pleasant hazel change colors dramatically, first listening to pink before darkening to a deep crimson hue.  He stares at her in shock for a second before the weight of her stare feels like a physical pressure.  He scrabbles backwards from her but her voice, deeper than usual, throaty, stops him in his tracks.  “Stay Omega.”  Harry freezes, panting slightly.  He can’t meet her eyes anymore.
Hermione nodded.  “Yes, Mrs. Weasley took me to the Ministry to register me as your Alpha and then to Gringotts right away.  I would have brought you if I could have, Harry, but they won’t allow Omegas to be included in any of the proceedings.  We couldn’t afford to wait, not even a day.  You presented fairly publicly and word had already gotten around the castle that you had presented Omega.  I’m sure some of the Slytherins already had owls headed to their parents to let them know of the news.  We couldn’t risk any competing claims.  Not for you.”
Unlike a Squib, I can still see magically enchanted items for what they are and I can even sense the magic imbued in objects.
But he’s stymied in his effort by Ron, who interrupts the attempt by grabbing the letter himself and pulling it away, out of George’s reach.
She paused and smiled at them again for a second.  “The thing you have to remember is that we all go through this.  No Wizard is immune to Stricture so we’ve all been where you’re sitting now, be it a few months or a few years after Presentation.  The good news I have for you is that this is a gift.  Your presentations, our culture, it’s a gift from Magic itself that allows us to continue Wizard kind.  It might be scary but this battle to understand this new part of yourselves is a fight you’re going to win.  Your instincts are powerful things and the Coven system grew out of this instinctual framework. It won’t be a long time before this seems completely natural to you.”
