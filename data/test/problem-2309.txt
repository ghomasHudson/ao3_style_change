Of course he was sodden, his hair plastered to his scalp, his robes most unhappily tangled. But his face — oh, his face! — was totally covered with mud. He looked as though someone had thrown a mud pie at him.
Draco stirs his coffee briskly, his back set to Harry, and says nothing.
Draco is silent for a long time again. Harry, at last, chances a glance at him. Draco's not looking at him, he thinks with relief. He's staring at the view from the balcony door, staring at the city lights, the trains slowly crawling along the tracks.
, Draco had told Harry once. Harry likes thinking about that. One day he’ll stand in Snowdonia and look over his shoulder, and he might see all the other Dracos and Harrys who came before him. The very first Draco who found his way there, a lonely ghost stuck in time. The very first Harry who arrived there, eyes wide open, and thought he was going to tumble into the stars and never stop falling.
Harry scoffs. “You are not — ”
“Hermione,” Ron said quietly, “he cares about Harry too — ”
"Well...I shouldn't have insulted you," Harry mutters, distracted by the intensity of Draco's voice.
The realisation dawns the day before, on the first day of the month. It's a mild spring day. Summer is beginning to approach the land again; he can feel it like the distant glow of a fire. There's warmth in the breeze that stirs the leaves of the trees, and he thinks a drive to Cornwall sounds nice. In the soft glow of a warm spring day, Helston looks far more friendly and cheerful, and the coastline itself seems gentler. The waves seem less furious and more playful as they roil and roll around the base of the cliffs. There's a young family taking photographs of the lighthouse, the children giggling and chasing each other around in circles.
It's a very long week waiting for the test results. When Harry's not working his other cases, he's in the Muggle Liaisons office, badgering people about making arrangements. When he finally receives news, on Thursday, that a DNA sample has been successfully retrieved, he begins badgering Butterworth instead.
"If you take out a second mortgage, you should be all right." Hermione glances up and catches Harry's expression. "That was a joke, Harry. It
Narcissa nods, just once. "Until he purchased a home in East Devon."
Harry hunts around the steering wheel, looking for the ignition. There's a button with 'Start' on it, and he presses it doubtfully.
"Wouldn't happen to know any good potion brewers, would you?"
“It doesn’t
“But it’s not
The lie hung in the air between them like a heavy heart.
Harry doesn’t believe that for a second. Draco always says that, every time yet another service has to be scheduled, but somehow they never get around to looking for a new car, and Harry has the feeling they’ll be driving the Renault until it’s held together by sheer determination and a little bit of magic.
He checks his watch. He should be portkeying in the next fifteen minutes, arriving in time to wish Ginny luck.
"You smell odd. Like...hay and leather."
"Until you married a Death Eater," Harry feels obliged to point out. Astoria gives him a sharp look.
Astoria gives a tense smile. "Matthew Venn. You wouldn't know him." She perhaps catches Harry's glance towards the doorway, for she adds, "Our daughter, Sophie."
“I’m not Head Auror,” Harry had pointed out helpfully.
By the time he arrives in London and parks the car in the apartment block's garage, it's past ten o'clock and Ginny will be asleep. He walks slowly to the apartment, his body feeling heavy and his mind weary. He doesn't want to deal with anyone or anything.
Maybe, a few months ago, Harry would have nodded and smiled and convinced himself he was happy, or at least that it was selfish to be unhappy. But his conversation with Draco circles his mind like a flurry of snow:
"You have it neat, if I recall," Draco says. "I'll take mine on the rocks." He taps his wand against the glass of water on the bedside table, and the water instantly transforms into ice cubes.
The next memory is bright, filled with sun again. The tepid sunlight of autumn, streaming through a large window. A bedroom, Harry thinks, turning from the window. There's a dresser, and a wardrobe, and a bed of course. The style of the room reminds him of Astoria's country home and he wonders if that's the location.
In the streets below, someone is whistling
“Sorry,” Matthew says, not looking the least bit apologetic. “It was a good joke.”
* * *
A few feet away from him, on the other bed, he can see the faint silhouette of Draco sleeping. He's facing away from Harry, curled in on himself as if trying to disappear, and Harry wonders if Draco ever has nightmares about the war.
"Fine."
Harry steps inside and closes the door. They say it might snow next week, although it rarely snows in London. This city moves and breathes like an enormous beast, breathing in the lives of eight million people and turning snow to sleet with the sheer heat of life contained within.
"What?" Harry, making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen, nearly drops his mug.
"I thought you were looking for a time-turner?" The shopkeeper, at this point, is completely bewildered. "Well...our eagle owls have quite a sense of direction...they know exactly where to go, although they don't always return home. Rather difficult to tame." He laughs nervously. Harry doesn't smile, too wrapped up in his thoughts.
“I’ve come to say goodbye,” Draco says.
"Not quite like that," Hermione says quickly. "But...could it be Legilimency? A skilled Legilimens could cast the spell across great distance."
Harry takes the cue and leaves.
. The Cornish coastline rises like a ghost to greet Harry, and he can hear the winds blowing southerly through craggy cliffs, rushing along endless highways, whistling through the chains of empty swings in empty playgrounds.
“Only because Harry’s a right pain when he’s obsessing with Malfoy,” Ron says, sliding off the sofa and ambling towards Hermione’s library room. Harry’s too distracted to reflect on that particular remark. He looks at Hermione.
“Were you?”
"No." Draco shakes his head, smiling. "Just...ever keep a secret so long? — those words you think in your head, over and over, but you'll never speak them aloud, and — " He breaks off, then shakes his head again, but Harry understands.
"There's a
“What? The baby is what?” Harry asks impatiently.
They walk to the Renault together. Harry waits for Draco to choose the passenger or driver seat; to his surprise, Draco takes the passenger side and opens the glovebox, retrieving the road atlas. Harry takes the driver's seat.
They paused for a moment and then it became apparent. Draco Malfoy slunk around the corner, almost glued to a wall as if he wished it would swallow him. Behind him, a group of Ravenclaws and Gryffindors sniggered and whispered amongst them.
The clock chimes one o’clock.
"Anywhere?"
"I'll — I'll see you at Christmas," Draco said quickly.They paused just before the wall leading to Platform 9¾ and Narcissa embraced him briefly.
“That’s so sweet.”
Blonde hair. Blue eyes.
Draco sets the keycard onto Harry's bedside table. "See you in the morning, then," he says.
"You're just like the rest of them," Harry says, his voice low and angry. "Think Draco's gone off to live in some luxury villa somewhere, don't you? You don't know a damn thing about him."
"I know you're fond of standing on balconies, drinking neat whiskeys," Draco says, picking up the bottle of Glenmorangie next to the book. "Shall we?"
She hugs him briefly and then steps into the fireplace, Flooing away. Harry stands alone in the empty apartment, the silence seeming to ring out around him like ripples.
"I learned to drive," he says.
* * *
Harry surfaces from the pensieve, inhaling deeply like he's coming up for air.
No reply. Draco feels very warm, though, and Harry, after some hesitation, places a hand against Draco's forehead.
"Then I suppose you don't know him very well," she says.
"It's not a law library, Ron, it's
Harry waits. The wind nips at his face, a salt-tinted bite from the freezing Celtic Sea. He shivers and draws his cloak closer, fighting with the material as it slips from his numb hands.
The chapel door opens. Malfoy steps out and closes it behind him.
Astoria glances down, towards her cup of tea. People look downwards when they're upset, Holdsworth once told Harry, or trying to hide emotion. But it's difficult to read Astoria's face, although she twists her lips slightly as if considering something.
He nods and pulls out a chair, sitting down.
Draco exits the motorway, following an arterial road, and then stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere.
River and the sky, he thinks just before he falls asleep. An endless circle.
* * *
"What's it about?"
"What?" Draco asks sharply. "There's bones?"
* * *
"Yeah, I heard you! And at least I
He hopes it hasn't changed.
When three hours have passed since Draco disappeared, Harry thinks he'll accept
"I assure you," Malfoy says, a faint trace of amusement in his voice, "I passed the test."
* * *
"There's practically nothing. Clothes, some paperwork, a few books and a couple of personal items. You're saying that's everything in Draco's life?"
* * *
* * *
"Draco was in trouble?" Harry says with alarm.
* * *
Unlike the pristine apartment, his office is a comfortable clutter of mismatched furniture and piles of paperwork. There's the battered desk with his chair behind it; in the corner of the office are two comfortable chairs and a low table with an inviting bowl of sweets. It's been deliberately designed to be as soothing as possible, as the designated corner for interviewing (often distraught) relatives.
Somebody’s wand.
They never did find out whether the buried wood was a shipwreck or a pier.
"Would you like to book a separate room? Your current suite is a twin share."
"I assume this will stay between us," Astoria says after a moment.
They lapse into silence again, but twenty minutes later, as they're halfway across a bridge over the River Ouse, Draco speaks again, not lifting his gaze from the window.
But soon enough, his irritation turns to pensiveness as he thinks about Draco as he was in the early years at Hogwarts. Immature, always showing off his wealth and drawing attention to himself...there had been a brash confidence that had slowly melted away, taking the last of Draco's childhood with it and leaving someone else. Someone who hid away all the time, he thinks as he remembers sixth year. Someone who seemed permanently afraid, always retreating, always looking away.
Please do not re-post my work on other websites. I have never allowed this and will continue to ask people not to re-post.
“Get him to do it himself,” Ron said and the pile of cards blew up in Harry’s face.
The universe never ends.
He went home and cried for the first time in five years. Not for Draco, no. He cried for himself, for the night he fell in love with Draco Malfoy, with his wild grey eyes and strong hands and beautiful smile. One night, and five years later here he was, sobbing uncontrollably into his robes, sick of being alone, filled with some kind of unnamed hurt. And he knew he would not return.
Harry looks in the side-mirror, watching the fields fade into darkness.
As he stirs in his sleep, Draco pulls him close.
Realisation hits Harry. "No," he says. "
"And what's that mean?"
The colour of the bones almost matches the summer-scorched grass pushing between the vertebrae. The ribs bend like stalks of wheat, permanently bowing to an invisible wind; the finger knuckles look like sun-bleached pebbles.
"These are his things," Narcissa says, tilting her head towards the boxes stacked in the corner. It's a very small pile, Harry thinks critically. Is it really the contents of a whole house?
"No."
"Let me know if you need anything," he says, wishing Draco had at least helped himself to the pantry. He looks desperately in need of a good meal or two.
"I like storms," Draco says at last. He looks down at his glass, then downs the rest of it.

“I guess with what I’ve heard, you’d be more interested in saving strangers than spending time with your loved ones…being the
“Nonsense. With that awful manifestation occurring, we need to rectify the situation as soon as possible.”
“No one is going to Azkaban!” Pansy cries, her voice laced with panic. “Draco…we’re not going to Azkaban, are we?”
The wall clock is massive, situated slightly above the intricately carved mantel. Draco smirks when he realises that the mantel’s carvings are of entwined snakes. The edge of the clock is gilded gold with a pearlescent-coloured backdrop. Over twenty tiny gold hands with people’s names on them point towards various words etched along the edge of the clock: Home, Hospital, Diagon Alley, The Burrow, Travelling, Visiting, Hogwarts, In Danger, Dead, Lost, Mortal Peril, and so on. Fascinated, Draco approaches it, immediately searching out Granger and Weasley, both pointing to The Burrow. There’s a cluster of hands there, the entire Weasley clan, his Aunt Andromeda, her grandson Edward, and surprisingly, Rubeus Hagrid, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Minerva McGonagall.
. And you show me, you show me just how desperately you want to bury him, bury me, bury your grief.” The creature squeezes its eyes shut and begins to tremble. “Because it’s all my fault. My fault, my fault, my fault,” it repeats.
“I love you. I love you, Draco, I’m so sorry,” Harry cries. “I’ll do anything, just let him go, let him live -
Harry looks as if he’s about to cry, but he blinks several times and nods before looking at the computer screen.
Draco meets the gaze of a young sandy-haired man in the mirror. He’s handsome, with smiling brown eyes, his gaze appreciative as he watches Draco. The man’s smile is one that Draco would have easily fallen for had it not been directed at him tonight
” Draco says, rolling his eyes. “Plus, Harry’s sense of smell is bar none. Where is the party?” Draco asks, looking around the bar. It’s full for a Friday night, but he doesn’t see any of their friends.

It’s not until Draco kneels beside the man that he smells it: old textbooks, his mother’s perfume, and something sweet and syrupy. Draco flinches.
Potter, who had been shucking off his damp jacket snorts. “I’ve only been here once and I’m pretty sure she wasn’t working the front.”
Draco takes it from him, expression shocked. It’s an extra precaution that’s appreciated, as the Aurors are always adopting new investigative skills. Theo has that effect on people, but it still throws him off from time to time when he recalls just how intuitive and sharp his friend is.
“I can reintroduce you two. I’m not sure what her preferences are nowadays, but I can’t imagine anyone saying no to you, darling,” Draco says, grabbing her hand and heading towards the booth.
Mia giggles. “Please, call me Mia.”
“Take care of yourself, Malfoy,” Harry says earnestly. The other man gives him a jerky nod, not meeting his gaze at all.
“Draco, are you alright?”
He typed it in, all lowercase and one word: “treacletart.”
He breaks his eye contact with her to instead usher his children towards the monstrosity of a Muggle contraption Harry insisted that they purchase and that Draco properly learn how to use.

“Pardon me, love. Mind if I bum a ciggy off you?” he asks.
A large belch of black smoke pours out from the Floo. The puff of black smoke has them both whipping their heads towards it. A chest of Draco’s judiciously packed potions ingredients spits out from the Floo and lands with a
“No, Draco. I think Potter has done greater harm to us than your precious mummy Shafiq,” Theo responds coolly, snorting a line laid out before him with a tightly rolled up piece of parchment. “I think it’s time for Potter to pay it forward, Draco baby.”
“I never said that.”
“You know where the kettle is,” Draco drawls.
“So you’ve said,” Draco responds slowly, a small smile on his lips.
The house-elf nods, her eyes anxious as she gazes up and down his body. “It being in your back pockets, Sir. Is Zilly being Summoning it for you?”
But Draco isn’t the same person he was at seventeen. Draco has known loss, and has struggled with the ability to love while clinging to his humanity. But Draco now knows the true
“I promise,” Draco says.
When he doesn’t move, Padma grips his chin and pulls out her wand to aim a light into and across both of his eyes. Draco registers her concern before his eyes roll to the back of his head and he nearly passes out. He can hear when she casts a Lightening Charm on him, wrapping her arm around his waist and hauling him up. She barely reaches his shoulder as she stands a solid five feet in comparison to his six-foot-one frame. Draco can feel as she drapes his arm across her shoulders and leads them towards the Floo.
“I tried to stop her, b-b-but—” Al starts, the word dropping off like water into Harry’s conjured bucket.
They order enough sushi to feed a small army, and Draco doesn’t hesitate to order Sake which the waiter brings out along with a flat, saucer-like cup to drink it out of. Their conversation is lighthearted as they talk about their friends, the weird things Draco encounters living with Pansy and her mishmash of friends, Potter’s new obsession with some Muggle gadget called a Wii, and all interspersed with a few lighthearted insults. Potter’s cheeks are endearingly flushed and his body language is lax; the skin around his eyes crinkles happily as he looks warmly at Draco. He hasn’t been on the receiving end of a look like this in a long time and a part of him is desperate for more.
“Bully for you.” He carefully pulls out a picture of himself as a toddler, no more than three years old. His heart clenches as his happy, child-self smiles shamelessly up at him with a wave. He sits the photo on the edge of Potter’s coffee table and gives Pansy a stony look.
, to see the remnants of the violent night still decorating his skin like this makes him sick to his stomach. A wave of anger slips pass his mental defences – it flares through him like Fiendfyre and the mirror cracks. He releases a startled gasp, the mirror cracking further from his accidental magic. He stares at his broken reflection with incredulity. Where was his accidental magic then? His magic failed him when he had needed it most.
“Fuck the rumour mill.”
“Because you said you wanted us to date in private!”
Harry, don’t stop!” Draco cries, sweaty strands of hair sticking to his forehead.
“NO! And

“Do you think you can give us some privacy?” Potter asks the officer who nods and continues walking down the corridor, leaving them alone. Draco  feels too hot, his heart beats too fast and – oh Merlin, he can’t breathe. He gasps, eyes darting around the empty corridor in panic as Potter reaches for his hand to gently tug him into the closest men’s loo. Potter places a hand on each of his shoulders when the doors shut behind them. “Look at me, Draco.” Draco cuts his eyes from the garish blue tile of the men’s floor to Potter’s gentle gaze. “I want you to take a moment and meditate with me here, yeah?” Potter asks soothingly. Draco finds himself nodding. “Close your eyes. I want you to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.” Draco does. “That’s it, good. Excellent. Let your breath just flow right from the centre of your stomach… breathe in. Good. Out. Again. Yes. See how your breathing is centring you? Gathering and pushing out all that bad energy? You’re doing so well, Draco. When you’re ready, I want you to open your eyes, okay?” Draco nods, his body calming down as the deep breathing and Potter’s soothing voice eases the erratic thudding of his heart. Draco opens his eyes and slouches forward. Potter catches him in an embrace. He drops his head onto Potter’s broad shoulder and sighs.
He just holds Draco as he cries himself to just soft, shuddering breaths. After several minutes of this, the other man pulls back, his lower lip trembling.
“Merlin. What happened? Are you okay?” Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s stiff body, not letting go until Harry relaxes against him. Harry drops his head against Draco’s shoulder.
“Fuck you,” Draco hisses before taking off towards the stairs leading to their bedroom.
“Well, aren’t you a smug bastard?”
“Absolutely fucking not,” Blaise hisses.

“Then, it seemed like life just moved on, like nothing happened. Purebloods forgot that they committed atrocious acts mere months ago. Instead, they began to host parties and preach about tolerance in public, while continuing to whip their house-elves and throw around the M word. And then they expect us, their children, to accept these jaded white lies of change, of a new-normal. As the social elite, we have to accept that we're just stumbling through our charmed little existence in a society that offers us worldly comforts with no consequences at all. We’re born into this kind of utopian world as little monsters, shielded from real life, and then we go on to breed other little monsters who will also have this same charmed, ignorance-is-bliss life. No one in our community prepares us for the immense loneliness, the fear of isolation, or the pressure to be perfect. No one prepares you to face your demons in the real world, if you ever do venture out into it, because they simply never had to do it themselves. Nothing ever changes.
“I’m fine! And that’s the understatement of the year,” Draco responds, forcing a small smile onto his lips. “Nothing I can’t handle.”
Padma presses the back of her hand against his forehead. She frowns. “You are incredibly cold, Draco. Allow me to provide a Warming Charm.”
“Well,” Malfoy says, adjusting his arms to cling tighter to his chest. He picks up just how clearly Malfoy’s fidgeting reads as defensive, as if Malfoy is trying to protect himself from Harry’s glaring eyes of dislike and judgement. He finds it oddly vulnerable, and he’s suddenly reminded of that day at St Mungo’s so long ago, Malfoy’s face so unfairly bruised and battered. The anger rushes from out of him like a fiery torrent and he suddenly feels sorry for the other man. It would be a lie if he said he wasn’t curious about what Malfoy’s been up to since that day, and their subsequent chance meeting at
“I’m simply giving him the benefit of the doubt, darling. If he says things will improve between us this way, I must try. We’re all better together than apart,” Pansy says a few days before the pub night.
“Not a fan of pizza?”
“Hermione, of course. Padma, too, sometimes. They both talk about you a lot, and rather highly.”
Simmons is about to respond when the exiting Chief Warlock Mormont stands, his wand pointed at his throat as he coughs several times.
Jeremy steps towards Draco, coming around the table to stand in front of his weak, trembling form. Jeremy pulls something out from his back pocket and it's too quick for Draco to block.
“Draco, I want to help you, okay? I
There’s an uneasy feeling Draco can’t shake about this whole ordeal, but he clears his throat and reaches into his inner suit pocket to pull out the scroll.
“What do you mean a different name?”

“Says the person who’s never been hexed by him! He’s capable of a wickedly strong knee reversal hex that’ll leave you limping for weeks,” Theo says with a cringe.
Pansy frowns. “I would think after everything you two have been through, what complete strangers think of you two together would be the last thing on your mind.”
Barbara wraps one bejewelled hand around Draco’s forearm, tugging him down the short hall towards the Wizengamot’s main offices. She’s an older woman, probably in her late 60s, with a thick Jamaican accent, shocking white hair, and rather large, acid green horn-rimmed glasses attached to a thin gold chain wrapped around the back of her neck. Her cardigan is a weird, fuzzy material, the colour matching her glasses, and her sensible black pencil skirt nearly reaches her ankles. For such a tiny lady, her grip is ironclad.
“Bloody hell, where’d I put the parchment with my notes?” he mumbles to himself. To his surprise, Draco answers.
, as you are. Flaws and all because that’s what makes you so unbelievably amazing. As long as I have you in my life—if I can hold you, like this,” Harry laces his fingers with Draco’s. “And kiss you like this,” he presses a kiss to Draco’s lips. “I’m happy. I don’t need to label what we do and how we spend our time together, as long as we can continue to spend our time together.”
Granger sniffs before clearing her throat, her voice still gravelly. “What can I help you with, Malfoy? I’m sure Gedeon told you everything about my resignation letter.”

Draco is finishing his double firewhiskey when Mia slides onto the stool beside him.
It’s always been
Picking up his wand he removes the Stasis Charm, measures out 3 millilitres of ethanol, and throws it into the cauldron.
“Yeah,” Dean says, cautiously offering up a hand which Draco shakes briefly. “I heard you two were…hanging out,” Dean says as he looks down his nose, a hint of disdain colouring his words. Harry feels something explode in his chest – a lively burst of anger—and he suddenly wants to yell at Dean. How dare he, the tosser! How dare he even hint his disapproval after everything he’s done to him, and –
“Sure. Any other requests?” Draco asks flippantly, not at all expecting the Patil girl to lift her empty glass of red elf wine and for Weaslette to shove across an empty shot glass. No one else looks up at him, the tension at the table still taut. Draco nods with a peevish scowl and makes his way towards the bar.
club?” Some part of him knows he’s being a complete and utter twat, but he doesn’t have the strength to stop himself, certainly not with liquid courage and misplaced unadulterated anger on his side. In his defence, he never quite knows his limits when interacting with Slytherins; he can’t be totally at fault if he sometimes overreacts when it comes to their lot – they’re inherently suspicious people.

Ginny chuckles. “Well, chin up. What’s the problem?”
Draco’s cheeks are suddenly pink for some reason.
He doesn’t turn around when Harry enters the ensuite, but he can feel the other man behind him. He doesn’t meet his eyes in the mirror until Harry places a hand on his shoulder. “You’ve cut your hair.”
—  into the tip jar. The woman smiles kindly at him and Malfoy nods, stacking both small cups and holding them in one hand. He turns and tries to sidestep Harry, but Harry steps in front of him.
Draco withdraws his wand from his holster, his left hand trembling as he tries to tighten his grip. “A well-placed
, a faint buzzing now filling Draco’s ears.
Out of all the events during the Season, Draco finds the Davis Charity Opera event the best. Her Father, a prominent barrister then (Wizengamot member now), had married a Muggleborn witch at the beginning of Voldemort’s power in the 70s. Tracey’s mother, Tiana, was a Muggleborn witch who came from wealth and worked strictly in the Muggle world as the Director of Grange Park Opera.
“I’ve always been attracted to women. Since I was a little girl, even, yeah. I was just too afraid to embrace it, let alone admit it aloud. It’s been a terrible secret to have.” Ginny whispers, her voice trembling with emotion. Her face is the picture of discomfort tinged with fear and Harry suddenly feels overwhelming sympathy for her. He wants to reach out and touch her, offer some bit of comfort even though her words hurt him. Before he can make up his mind, she’s taken another deep breath and starts talking again.
“C’mon, mate.” Theo pouts. “You said you weren’t going to back out.”
“Don’t
, Pansy, I must tend to the wound immediately!” Padma says, pushing Pansy aside.
When Draco finishes with the last child, he straightens up once more, fixing Mrs Pumpernickel with a frozen smile. An idea strikes him.
“Bless you, sir! You be sure to look after our dear hunk!”
pops the top, and chugs it.

from flirting to actual relationship – they’ve been dancing around each other for years. Draco picks up his large glass of red wine and sips from it, contemplating his next move. He’s momentarily distracted once again by Greg fiddling with the Muggle wireless Potter gifted Draco with last month. A song with the soft plucks of guitar strings, violins, and a woman with a vaguely French accent singing comes on. Greg leaves it.
“How dare these filthy half-breeds, mudbloods, and blood traitors roam my halls!”
“Go slow,” Draco says.
He stares up at her, the smooth dark maroon robes flattering against her dark skin and curvy figure. A small smile tugs at his lips. She’s grown into a stunningly beautiful, and fiercely powerful witch. He chuckles to himself, overcome with pride for his best friend. Hermione is clearly on her way to becoming Minister of Magic one day. He smiles fondly up at her as her frustration becomes clear as day on her face.
“I heard that doesn’t work with fevers,” Pansy responds.
As Draco makes his way towards the door, ready to write the night off as a bust, he trips over the corner of a rug, unearthing the cold stone flooring beneath it. His heart leaps into his chest as he goes crashing into a white-sheet-covered armchair before stumbling onto his knees and hands on the rough, stone floor. He cries out, immediately lifting his left hand, the leather glove ripped and skin underneath smarting but otherwise unbroken. His kneecaps, unfortunately, feel as if they’ve been popped out of place. With a low groan he reaches out to the offending armchair to carefully hoist himself up. It’s then that his foot slips again and Draco realises that a piece of the stone flooring is loose.

“Pardon?” Hermione asked, startled. Just then, Rolf approached the table. With his hulking figure next to Luna’s short petite frame, he looked like a giant.
Draco had tilted his head back and laughed heartily before whispering back with such amusement, “
“—I like it.
“Yeah?”
“You should stop drinking,” Pansy reproves, taking the glass from him, which is all the best for him as his stomach gives an unforgiving lurch at that moment. “You’re going to embarrass yourself.”
Draco thinks with a groan. Blaise’s hand tightens. Isn’t that what this warning is? Harry’s refusal to show Draco who he really is; Draco’s refusal to stick around to watch Harry fall apart. Harry holds their love like water in his hands. It’s too precarious. It’s
family. If your father can’t come to an agreement with Narcissa, I’m afraid he’ll just have to take his chances with the board in charge of the property’s sale.”
Draco snorts. “By doing what? Stealing some problematic, gaudy jewellery from Farida Shafiq?”
“Well done, Teddy-bear,” Harry adds, his hand coming to rest on the small of Draco’s back. “I’m glad you won’t let some stupid, backwards talk ruin your mood.”
Harry’s hard eyes fall to Andrew’s grip before it snaps back up to his face. “I think the last thing the Ministry needs right now is a case of Auror Brutality against a suspect.”
Ginny slowly approaches the sofa and sits beside him. She rests her head against his shoulder and he finally uncurls himself to throw an arm about her shoulders, pulling her so close that she rests her head against his chest, her arms wrapping tightly about his waist. They sit in companionable silence for a while, the fire before them crackling but doing little to ease his and Ginny’s shivering. They listen to the pounding rain pelt against the windows, the sickly pale yellow of the streetlamps outside illuminating the storm’s ferocity.
“We said no invite, no entrance!” the guard barks.
that, as dysfunctional as it is, Draco doesn’t want to have it any other way.
It wasn’t fair for Harry to carry the burden of Draco’s problems. Draco may have had to live a Muggle life, forced out of the Manor three months after the war due to reparations, but he’d found his way, hadn’t he? He’d rented a tiny room above a shop in Knockturn Alley and for those first few months, things had been alright. Draco hadn’t expected Harry to knock on his door one day to return a wand he wasn’t able to use.
And then Azul had caught Harry staring at Draco who was across the room chatting up an older man. The man had placed his hand on Draco’s elbow, and the responding smile Draco gave him was like a Bludger to the gut for Harry. Azul had swooped in, her sharp eyes following Draco’s receptive body language to Harry’s pale, broken expression. “Oh, I see,” Azul had said. “You want what you can’t have.”
“I’ll admit she does know how to pick them. Alicia’s a
Draco leans in a bit closer to Potter, his eyebrows lowering. “What would the Chosen One possibly lie about?” he asks, his eyes flitting to Potter’s scarred hand,
. Does that mean...Was it—was it at the
, he thinks as he smirks at Harry.
Hours later, he finds himself sitting in a private room he’d finagled the hospital staff into for Malfoy. To his shock and disgust, he was met with adamant resistance as no one wanted to treat the former Death Eater. Much to his discomfort, he had to throw around his name to procure a Healer for Malfoy, the Welcoming Witch having not noticed his identity when he first arrived. So here he sat, in a tiny secluded room far from the nurse’s station feeling sick to his stomach at having manipulated the staff, but strangely proud that he had done it at the same time. After all, he couldn’t very well let Malfoy lapse into a coma or whatever happens to someone who is concussed for a long time.
Harry. Harry whimpers, nudging his snout against Draco’s cheek before licking a large, hot stripe there. Draco laughs, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. “You big lout, c’mon. Let’s sleep, shall we? Things will be better in the morning, I promise,” Draco says, coaxing Harry to curl up at the edge of the bed. As Draco lays supine, Harry’s large form rests against the side of Draco’s body, radiating heat. Draco smiles as he wraps his arms around him.
After a few beats of silence, Draco weakly asks, “How the fuck do you expect me to respond to this?” Draco crosses his arms against his chest, but he looks vulnerable rather than defensive.
...with someone and they had both smiled, Ron giving him a good ribbing about letting go of his
He angrily picks it up.
“Not tonight.”
Harry grimaces. “Oh.”
The Leaky Cauldron is quiet for a Monday evening.
This is the third time this week Teddy has sunk to the floor to turn into dead, albeit screaming, weight. Draco tries to explain to Teddy why he can’t go to a Muggle daycare in his play dress, but the little boy is not having it.
Harry freezes as he enters the bar for a nightcap.
“He looked bloody weird, trust me. Something about his face. It looked puffy,” Harry says, finally pulling away from Draco’s embrace and standing on his own. He tries to distract himself from Draco’s attentiveness by turning to the karaoke machine, fiddling with the price tag.
,” Draco whimpers as Blaise carefully positions him over the footboard. “Yes, Merlin, please, yes,” Draco says, spreading his legs apart.
What the
Draco! Merlin. And I have some of my best people posted outside her door at St Mungo’s. She’ll be safe until we get the dossier out and Flint arrested.”
He’s mentioned to Luna in the past that his mother used to sing this very lullaby to him as a child, and he never had the chance to ask her how she knew it. Did his mother’s governess sing it to her growing up? Was it just a song she came across, loved, and learned how to sing? She never indicated that she knew how to speak Welsh and it breaks his heart that he’ll never know the story behind her love for this song. He turns his face into Luna’s stomach and bites back another sob. He lets the soft Welsh words wash over him like a smooth wave despite his still waters running deep.
Harry’s arms come up to wrap him into a hug. “Hey, now,” Harry starts, his tone gentle and teasing. “How much did you drink at that Pink Ocean thing tonight?”
He never thought in a million years he’d be on relatively friendly terms with Potter, and how weird is it they’re together, doing
“Jeez, could you’ve maybe just said that instead of resorting to violence?” Harry asks, rubbing the back of his head.
“The pleasure is all mine, Ginevra. I’m so glad you were able to make it.”
isn’t it?”
Harry freezes, dropping the playful smile on his face as he clears his throat. “Really?”
He looks around once more in search of Potter, his gaze immediately finding him standing near the shell-shocked Muggles. He turns, as if sensing Draco’s eyes on him. They hold one another’s gazes and once again Draco is struck with regret, guilt building in the pit of his stomach at the thought that whatever idea Granger came up with, Draco had signed off on, killing Potter and leaving him trapped as a shell of himself in the land of the living. Draco’s discomfort must show on his face, because Potter frowns and starts to come towards him.
“We’ll have to figure out a way to destroy the Veil,” Draco says simply. “Harry, I
“I’m going to miss you, too, but we’ll see you at the World Cup next month,” he says in a wobbly voice. Merlin, he didn’t realise how difficult saying goodbye was going to be.
“I’m not dressed for a nightclub, especially if we’re doing Muggle,” Pansy says with a pout, looking down at herself.
Beads of sweat build across Draco’s hairline and down his forehead. He can feel drips of it down his temples disappearing beyond the collar of his shirt. He knows he should have stopped after his sixth shot. As drunk as he is, he can still muster the strength to say what he must to Harry.
Luna presses a finger against her smiling lips before leaning against him again. “Your secret is safe with me,” she says, her arms coming up to squeeze him once more. “I’m happy for you both,” she says, letting him go and turning to Rolf.
Bitty is sipping from an icy glass of lemon water, a bored expression on her face. “He’s a very busy man, our Blaise.”
Potter at least looks devastated, and Draco thinks he deserves to feel much more than that. Potter runs a hand through his wild hair and nods.
“Fucking hell, Draco, are you alright?”  Potter asks, eyes wide, his arms raised as if warding off a manic beast, his hard, flushed cock jutting out from his body. Draco’s cheeks heat with a burning sense of shame that quickly turns to rage.
“And now we’re getting married. We have this incredible coconut cake,” Harry says, smacking his lips. “Can’t wait to get a piece of that.”
There's actually an AMAZING Lebanese shop (LebanEats) across the way from G-A-Y Late that inspired Harry, Draco, and Pansy's little food run. They do indeed have the best wraps I've ever tasted in my entire friggin' life. SOOOO GOOODDDDD.
“That’s the problem, isn’t it? That’s not flattery, that’s condemning them to a troubled existence, having to worry about me like that. I would never want them to sacrifice anything for me,” Harry says, his shoulders tensing. “Ron and Hermione, they’ve given up so much in their life for me. Enough is enough. We needed -
“What a cliché,” Pansy tuts, sipping from her second shot. “And an example of horrible taste, Smith is a fucking dick.”
Nurse Janelle laughs. “That they are! It was so nice seeing you again, Thea. I’ll see you next month, okay?” she says with a wink and a sweet smile before walking away.
The violent display shakes Draco to his core. He doesn’t want to see this side of Harry any longer, and he can hear Smith’s rattling breath, the same as Draco’s. “Harry...Harry, you have to stop, you’ll kill him…”
. He’s content, suspended in this numbness clouding the worst 24 hours of his life. Again, he reflects on Siobhan calling him a
It’s. Too. Bloody. Much.
“Get the hell away from us!” the man growls. “We don’t want your kind here!”
Draco leans in to kiss him, trying to put into it the words he’s incapable of saying aloud:
“Dunno.”
“I know,” Harry whispers back.
An embarrassing giggle escapes Blaise before he slaps a hand over his mouth. He drops his hand away and clears his throat. “
The Fiendfyre shoots from out of his hands and to the centre of the Veil. Sweat is already pouring down Draco’s face, mixing with his tears as he concentrates on controlling the wild stream of fire. His legs shake and his left knee gives out; he lands roughly on both knees, but doesn’t break his concentration or the stream of fire. Draco screams again, watching as the misty gray fog of the Veil instead fills with orange, yellow, and red flames, licking the edges of the Veil and pouring outward to consume the white marble apparition. Harry stares down at him still, even as the flames slowly crawl across the marble, consuming it. Draco watches until the entire apparition is consumed, tears once more streaming down his face. He gives one more final, violent push outward, ending the outpour of flames from his hands.
Potter, the one person who seemed to be front row to every single mistake in my life,” Malfoy gives a short, derisive laugh but then slips into a somber sulk. “Christ. It was exhausting. It was depressing.”
“I do
. You got this.”
The whole Magical community seemed hellbent on slut-shaming him nowadays. Even though he refuses to read the paper, Ginny always reports back to him, in thinly concealed excitement, any and all news about their antics.
Death has slipped through the tiny cracks decorated across their idyllic life.
“Sorry! It was quite busy,” Draco says, several drinks floating in front of him. He scoots past Potter to plop himself in his vacated armchair, the drinks landing on the small table before them. Potter runs a hand through his wild hair, his Adam’s apple bobbing. From the looks of it to Draco, he’s run through his hair several times since he left. Draco begins to sort the drinks out.
want no part in it.”
The main area of the pub is still quiet. Hannah Abbott mans the bar, a book opened in hands as she sits by the first till. A couple of young witches sit by the door sipping butterbeers, their tittering giggles aimed at the Muggle telly above them, currently playing some silly music video. Draco slips by completely unnoticed, uninterrupted, and for a wonderful moment he relishes a
Draco’s hand on her shoulder tightens and she winces with a pained moan. “Tell me how it happened.
Harry sighs. “Right...I’ll remember that the next time you ask me to blow you in the kitchen.”
The whole top floor is an open space that overlooks the sitting room and consists of a low, massive king size bed. There’s a nightstand on either side of the bed, with a pile of books sat on top, fairy lights the same colour as the Leaky’s hanging over the bed. Floor-to-ceiling windows line along the back wall that overlook a garden, one window cracked, allowing in cold air. There’s a door that’s slightly ajar, the peek of a bathroom beyond it. A soft armchair and ottoman with a small side table is to the right of the bathroom door, across from it a long, wide bookshelf that lines the wall where Harry’s wardrobe and chest of drawers also are. The sheets on the bed are a deep, royal purple. Draco pictures Harry in the middle of the bed, naked, gorgeous, pressed against the sheets.
“That’s not a good enough answer for me,” Draco says, dropping his hand. “I forgive you for scaring me, I can do that. But I can’t forgive you for not being honest with me after I’ve begged you to tell me what the hell is going on with you. Is it the potion? Are you having side effects of aggression?”
“I’m seeing Dean,” he finally blurts out.
“I’m so sorry,” he says reverently. Dean gives him an identical look of compassion.
“What is that supposed to mean, Wallace?” Granger seethes. “Because I’m a woman? A pregnant woman? Or a pregnant Black woman? Which one is it for you or am I just the trifecta of all things you clearly dislike in this world?”
Potter chuckles softly beside him. Draco hates that he actually finds Potter’s little laugh attractive.
“You’re different.”
Draco smiles, thoughts of their time together making his blood pump through his veins in a ferociousness of warmth and excitement. “Yeah. Yeah, I did.”
Potter picks up a shot of cinnamon-flavoured firewhiskey and swallows it down. He gags and wipes his mouth with the back of his scarred hand. “That was unpleasant, but thank you for the drink.” He sits the glass down and shrugs. “Sometimes I forget that I’m not always in the middle of a crossfire.”
Just as Draco is dozing off, a sudden chill sweeps through his bedroom.
“Enjoy your nap, darling. We’ll check on you later,” Harry whispers, leaning forward to kiss Teddy on the forehead.
Coming from his morning meeting with the Chief Prosecutor and staff, he approaches Barbara’s station, shooting her a small smile as she gets to her feet.
Harry tries to shake himself free from the crushing gloom spreading through him.
“I know who you are, Malfoy,” Saeed’s boyfriend says slowly, a look of disdain on his face, ignoring Draco’s hand.
Pansy hesitates before moving away from the doorframe, her short hair pulled back from her face with large, jewel tipped pins. He wonders if she was preparing for a Saturday night out. She makes her way to the small bar cabinet situated in the corner of the room. Her movements are jerky as she pulls down two tumblers and a decanter of amber liquid, pouring two fingers into each crystal glass. In a flash of irritation at her slowness, Draco pulls out his wand and Summons a glass as well as the decanter, ignoring Pansy’s yelp. He snatches the glass out of the air and guides the decanter to land with a
Gedeon is a handsome man in his late forties with thick, full salt-and-pepper hair and shocking robin egg blue eyes. He’s tall like Draco, but burlier in comparison to Draco’s lithe form. If he weren’t Draco’s boss, and if Draco wasn’t so wholly uninterested in anything even remotely romantic or sexual nowadays, he would have tried to seduce the man.
“Is there…is there someone else? A woman?”
“Er, yes.”
“Are you still going to look for a Kneazle elsewhere?”
Potter shrugs. “Tracey trusts you, and that’s an excellent endorsement if I’ve ever known one. You’re alright in my book, Malfoy, and I meant what I said about a truce. I’d like for us to put all our ugliness of the past behind us so we can try to, I don’t know, be friendly to one another.”
Draco wants to go
of a missing person’s notice circulating about someone as prominent as Susan Bones within their community...which seems bloody ridiculous, impossible even. But then again, who would have reported her missing if she was the only living person left in her wealthy family, probably single, and a bit of a recluse after the war?
“You’re a fucking
Draco starts, carefully turning his pounding head towards Potter’s voice, finding him sitting on the ground beside Draco, one leg pulled up to his chest with the other sprawled out before him. Another pain, a different kind of pain, shoots through Draco as he looks at Potter as he recalls it: regret.
“Aw babe,” Hermione crooned, “I love you.” She pulled her feet from Ron’s lap and instead crawled onto it. One of Ron’s large hands come up to wrap around her waist, the other to cup an arse cheek. She giggled and tipped her chin down so he could kiss her softly on the lips.
things. Potter smiles at him and is soon roped into a conversation with Girl Weasley again.
Why can’t he pull up a wall around these memories?
“Nana had gone for an emer-emern-gen-cy and told father to watch the roast, that she would only be gone for one whole hours to take care of her in-inter-er deco-rator,” Al says carefully, as if trying to recite every single word he had heard between Narcissa and Draco as he holds up one finger. He then frowns. “But then there was smoke everywhere. It was a long, long time without Nana, daddy. More than one hours.” He tries to tuck himself further into Harry’s embrace.
They make their way to Leake Street Tunnel after dinner. Harry’s surprised that he’s never been to this spot before, and he’s taken aback by all the graffiti and spiraling colours that decorate the tunnel and arches. He’s so in awe that it takes Malfoy wrapping a cool hand around his wrist with a tug to get him walking again. They pass a group of skateboarders and once they’re deep in the tunnel, Malfoy drops Harry’s wrist, looks around quickly, and pulls a tightly rolled spliff out of his pocket.
“Oh. It would be impossible for anyone to link me to anything at the Ministry,” Blaise chuckles. Draco ignores him and pulls out his wand.
“Potter.”
Potter finally croaks, shaking his head as if to clear it, his breathing quickening to little distraught pants and eyes blinking rapidly behind his round frames. When he doesn’t say anything further, Draco looks at Potter for a long moment, terrified of saying
good place. But now that Draco’s seeing Oliver, he can’t help but feel a bit threatened over the other man’s presence. Hermione hums.
Another wave of grief washes over Harry. Seven days to seven months, Draco has had to carry this pain alone while Harry sunk further and further into denial. All Draco ever wanted was a partner who would grieve with him, together. Harry had been cruel instead. No more.
“Harry. I want to make a suggestion here and I don’t want you to get angry.”
“What are you afraid of?” Harry demands, his heartbeat racing the moment the little colour in Draco’s face drains away. Harry’s eyes narrow. He’s suddenly cold with fury. “Are you afraid of what other people will think?”
Harry nods, once again swallowing the lump in his throat.
He knows for sure he didn’t expect Harry apologising to him.
“We’re going to kick so much arse right now…” Draco catches him saying. “We’re going to rule the fucking world!”
? Dating one another? How did he get Potter to be in the same
Draco puts the troubling letters he found in Potter’s office and his subsequent break down out of mind. The days trickle on and turn into weeks and he still doesn’t bring it up, even though Kreacher’s words play over in his head daily. Like so many other things in Draco’s life right now, he approaches the situation with confusion, indecisiveness, and anxiety. Simply put, on one hand, he wants justice. On the other, he wants peace. It seems nearly impossible for the two to be achieved simultaneously. But Draco’s trying to remember who he is.
Draco’s
“Don’t cry now, Potter,” Draco drawls coldly. Harry’s eyes snap open, once again blurred around the edges, but this time from tears he had not known were there. “It’ll be like what you once told me—quicker and easier than falling asleep.”
look of horror on Draco’s face before it slides into a cool mask of indifference.
“Do you trust me, Draco?”
with Malfoy was sort of a point of contention for me before we officially got together.”
“Oh darling, I love you, too,” Malfoy responds, his voice affectionate as he wraps his arms around his boyfriend’s neck to pull him into a slow kiss. He can’t seem to tear his eyes away from the intimate scene between Malfoy and his boyfriend, but there’s a sudden announcement that the train to Paris is about to depart and he
“It’s okay,” Draco says, kissing the back of his neck. Harry’s decided to sleep without his shirt tonight, the puckered pink skin shiny under the fairy lights. Draco presses his lips to it.
“What is it?” Harry asks, knowing her too well. Ginny shrugs.
Draco sucks in his bottom lip as he carefully slips a button free, allowing the very tips of his fingers to drag against his skin as he slides the shirt open before moving onto the next button. His breathing has become laboured, the anticipation hot and heavy in the pit of his stomach, the top of his thighs, and his cock.
a wanker. Really, why do I put up with you?”
, Granger.”
Time has treated Harry well. Gone are the dark bags pressed against Harry’s beautiful brown skin under his alluring eyes; gone are the worry lines that spelled out Draco’s name and appeared so crudely carved into Harry’s face. Harry is no longer a thin, awkwardly gangly knobby-kneed teenager on the cusp of adulthood. He’s gained a healthy weight, now a lean and athletic man with broad shoulders and a wide, confident gait full of purpose. Draco wants to embrace the lightness that is now Harry’s entire aura, a lightness that was sorely absent when they were married teenagers struggling to make sense of the world around them.

“I don’t fucking remember what exactly you asked me. I tend to drown out nonsensical chatter, so I do think you need to leave me alone now—” Draco says, trying to step around Smith.
“My team of specialised Aurors have been investigating the infiltration of Dark wizards within the Ministry since the end of the war,” Harry starts, flicking his wand to release Andrews from levitation.
A sob breaks free from Harry and slowly, slowly he begins to see his husband again, clearer than ever before. Harry shoves his hand under his glasses, pushing them up so he can wipe the tears from his eyes. “Draco,” he chokes out, stepping towards him, reaching out to touch him. Draco flinches back.
. He wants to scream in frustration, but instead he says, “I’m going home.”
you have good taste,” Ginny mumbles. Pansy pokes her and Ginny starts to giggle, pulling away from Pansy’s hands, but she goes after her, poking and tickling Ginny’s bare stomach.
Then Harry kept coming around. For all kinds of things. Excuses. Sometimes gifting Draco with candy, books, or little trinkets. Draco had been officially dating Harry for one month when Harry convinced him to move into Grimmauld Place because living in Knockturn Alley without magic had proved to be difficult.
He had created the thing as part of his project for Muggle Studies. He had enchanted the chart to automatically shift through the series of letters until the right decipher was found. The magical component had not been part of the project as it was strictly supposed to remain a non-magical project, but out of sheer stubbornness and disrespect, he had ignored the rules.
“It was nice to meet you,” Draco says, his eyes flickering with amusement. “I look forward to seeing your work.”
“What, that you’re watching
“You poor, lovesick bastard,” Andrews says with a smirk.
Potter frowns. “I’m sorry. I tried harder this time to control...
did it happen? Was Dean going to pretend that they didn’t just snog in the mens? The very thought makes him uncomfortable and unsure of what exactly to say or do next. Perhaps it’ll be for the best if they part ways now and never speak of it again. He’s straight, Dean’s straight. They’re just drunk and surely these kinds of things happen when alcohol is involved and it’s not a big deal. It doesn’t
Hermione’s deployed a rather powerful Notice-Me-Not charm over them. Armed with two tall cans of
“I’ve been suspended without pay pending an investigation.”
“Because believe it or not, you deserve to be happy.”
“No, let me—” Harry flinches, the wand burning again. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, my love.”
Draco feels faint. He hasn't seen Harry since the Shafiq Quidditch match, their last conversation ending with threats. He heard through the grapevine that Harry returned from his mission just a few days ago, a bit battered but in one piece, having successfully closed the case. Draco’s happy he’s been able to avoid Harry in the canteen and lifts, afraid that if face-to-face with the other man, he’ll blurt out – “I fucking stole your Cloak of Invisibility and now my friends are taking turns using it for Merlin knows what…probably gross, nefarious reasons!”
Draco frowns. “You haven’t told your friends?”
...” Draco’s voice catches. He blinks rapidly, his hands trembling. It feels good, and strange, and wholly empowering, having Harry like this.
Draco smiles, “I’m going to hold you to that, just you watch.” Draco takes another swig from his drink.
Harry cries out, not giving a fuck who hears him professing his love for Draco Malfoy. He wants to shout it from the rooftops!
that’s not completely true.”
“Harry…we have to break up.”
But their breakup had been a nasty business. Saeed’s mother, Farida, caught them together in a terribly compromising position– Saeed on his knees with Draco’s cock down his throat – in the Shafiq London parlour one wintry afternoon. Saeed initially thought his family to be spending the weekend at their country manor, so they had taken the quiet of the house as a personal challenge. They had planned for shrieking and moaning to fill each room, just not the shrieking, tears, and awful swearing of Farida. She had Draco running from the house, half-dressed and mortified at having been caught with his pants down.
He’s already crying, already missing Potter, already regretting

, hello there,” Harry says with a lazy grin, his gaze zeroing in on the long column of Draco’s pale neck. “You’re dressed rather scandalously. Are you trying to seduce a few mums at this picnic?” Draco snorts. He has one hand on his hip and his wand in the other as he levitates baby wipes, bug spray, a whole first aid kit, bottled water, and so much sunscreen it could cover a small army into a large wicker picnic basket. Harry dodges the flying items. “You do know we only have one child, right?”
“It feels good being held by you,” Draco says. He loves how they’ve been able to openly express their wants, needs, and appreciations, nothing holding them back during this intimate moment. Draco’s eyes catch on the pile of books on Harry’s nightstand, several titles saying Pablo Neruda on the spines. “I didn’t know you could read,” Draco teases. Harry squeezes him.
“Did you pretend to enjoy it?”
with him? “Bloody hell,” he whispers. Unexpectedly, Potter bursts into laughter – they’re great heaping hoots, his eyes crinkling and his mouth wide. The laughter oddly makes Draco feel weightless, like all his tensions have drained from him and he’s floating. He’s now laughing too because Potter sounds good and he looks fit with his face open and carefree like that. Potter’s in conversation with Girl Weasley and he’s sitting there, all cool and collected, still puffing on the spliff and talking animatedly, his almond shaped green eyes bright and merry. Potter turns to him and the noise sharpens and stills around them. “Why are you lying to me?” Potter asks, an eyebrow raised in question.
“Yes, Draco! Potter disrespected you. Why not pay him a little visit?” Pansy urges. “We do that with everyone else, why not Potter?”
Draco’s eyes fly open and Potter’s standing in the space Padma vacated, a sour look on his face.
the lives of the people you care for, and not only that, the lure of the Veil is powerful, five times as powerful as ever considering the experimentations we’ve done, and the people who have already entered through it. The moment you stood before it, it was over, Harry. It’s not a reflection on you, or your strength or desire to sacrifice yourself. Gedeon knew exactly what buttons to press because he’s good at reading people, it’s how he’s been able to shape me for the last two years. He plays to the things I want to hear and the things that I’m afraid to hear.”
“Who the fuck even
will be redoing the samples, but this time preserve it in suspension.”
“Goodnight, Harry,” he whispers after him as he watches the other man walk down the street to disappear around the corner.
“You seem hesitant right now. We can just hold each other, is that okay?” Draco nods dumbly as he clambers off Potter.
Potter runs a hand through his hair. “I don’t know what the fuck happened. I-I forgot myself there.”
It’s been so hard trying to control his constant worrying and unrelenting intrusive thoughts since moving back to Britain. All the rage and humiliation he has to face keeps his anxiety feeling like the weight of an extra body attached to his back at all times, it’s why Draco would rather stroll a Muggle market than visit Diagon Alley alone. But Draco
Saeed clears his throat. “Babe, can you please give us a few minutes?”
“What fresh hell is this?” Potter says frantically, his eyes wild behind his glasses as he runs a hand through his hair.
“Prick,” Draco mutters, smirking.
getting too hot in this pub.
Draco tilts his head back, once more taking in the wide landscape of buildings before closing his eyes briefly on a sigh. “Do I look like I’m enjoying this shit party?” he asks before fixing his gaze on the younger girl.
“Fat chance. Even you tried to ignore me the last time I was here. What was that you said about Slytherin’s honour?” Draco draws his attention back to her, tired of watching Blaise kiss his girlfriend.
Draco runs his tongue over his teeth as he tilts his head to the side to stare at Potter, anger bubbling up to the surface. He holds it in. He’s an adult now, after all. He closes the small space between them and leans in close enough that he knows Potter will hear him clearly without having to raise his voice. “I don’t know if you’re just bitter because she left you or what, Potter, but Blaise is not
fuck this up.” And then she disappears, turning to walk away from him, shouting, “Who’s next?”
Suddenly, the snakes on the front facade of the fireplace begin to move, a sound like a thousand snakes hissing at once echoing across the room. The snakes slither down either side of the fireplace, slowly exposing a hollow opening.
When the waiter leaves, Harry reaches out to gingerly touch Malfoy’s hand. “I’m happy you weren’t murdered, Malfoy.”
Flint rolls his eyes. “She’s quite the chatterbox, isn’t she? Sorry if she’s boring you to tears.”
Draco’s staring into his glass. “A task came up that I simply refused to complete.”
Pansy sighs, looking uncomfortable. “My maternal grandparents were soulmates, but it ended very badly when my mum was just a young girl. We don’t like to talk about it, it’s too sad.”
Theo sniffs. “We can and we will

“What are you going to do? Go hang around Theo, the man who can’t keep your secret about breaking into your ex’s home?” Bitty replies snidely.
Fear paralyses him, his legs locking as his jaw clenches, the hairs on his arms standing erect. Beside him Granger is using every single non-Defensive spell she can think of to undo the backlash of magic.
“Yeah,
That certainly sounds like something Malfoy would say. “Did you say Pent—” Harry starts to ask, but she interrupts.
Draco gasps once again as he’s brought back to his current surrounding, flailing like a drowning man on the cold stone ground. With a hiss he stills against the ground, his right hand gripping his left arm as a white hot pain lances through it. He shuts his eyes as he cries out, tears squeezing from the corners as he rides out the pain. When it subsides, sweaty and panting, he opens his eyes to stare up at the cracks in the ceiling of the office.
“My son, my
“I fucked up, Harry. I miss you so much.”
“I am here to help you and do not care for your childish comments. If you wish for me to remain in this room with you, you will cooperate and be respectful.”
Draco expects a rush of people desperate to drink away their Monday blues, but instead walks into a nearly empty pub, soft music playing in the background and only the locals drinking in dark corners. The ambience makes for a perfect evening tucked away in a booth in a back room with piping hot greasy chips, ice cold lagers, and the kind of laughter Draco isn’t afraid to make while Harry sits beside him. When Blaise finds them, arriving alone tonight, Draco removes the Repellent charm around them and nearly squeals when Blaise drops an assortment of baked goods on the table, a gift bestowed upon him while visiting Mrs Weasley and Ginevra at the Burrow. When Blaise excuses himself to buy a round of shots, Draco immediately uses Harry’s heightened sense of smell to dig out several silver and green foiled cauldron cakes for himself and several pieces of pink foiled toffee for Harry, who brushes Draco’s fingers as he accepts them.
aspect of the Black tradition, wouldn’t you say, Harry? Draco?”
Draco selfishly figures that if he’s to be murdered in two weeks, the least he can do is make sure these last two weeks are the best of his life.
, either.” Harry fidgets.
“Speak for yourself.”
Those words rush through Draco’s mind, chanting and enchanting, like a tidal wave, as they hold hands, strolling down Diagon Alley towards the Apparition Point. They talk softly to one another.
One year into their marriage, Harry receives word that Andromeda has died.
“Thea
. You touched me, my heart will never forget it, my body will never forget it, my
“I’d really like it if we became friends, Draco. We do have a lot in common.”
He’ll have to agonise over Potter later.
“Nothing like doing the bare minimum to warrant a half day off,” he snorts, loosening his tie.
His best mate had been depressed and helpless the last couple of weeks since Daraja’s diagnosis. Harry wanted to do something to lift his spirits, so when the idea to surround Draco around natural earth magic struck him, the first person he had consulted was Hermione. With her extensive knowledge on magical theory, Ministry hierarchy and protocol, she had been the one to initially point him in the right direction. Harry had made contact with all the right people in the DMLE to ensure that this little plan wouldn’t breach the terms of Draco’s magical restrictions. He could use the stones at Stonehenge as a conduit to
if you ever open your stupid mouth to make assumptions about my character or the people I surround myself with. Do you understand me, you fucking monster?”
Harry’s beam is a proud one. “I’ve been sorta busy,” he gushes, jerking his head towards Draco as he takes his hand. “Martin, meet Draco, my boyfriend. Draco, Martin.”
“Er, no...been cutting back on all that, actually.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand, and Draco knows this is something Harry’s going to discuss with him later.
, Potter,” Draco hisses, taking a small step back. “I’ve known since that day at St Pancras! You don’t think I
Draco can feel his cheeks flush as Harry begins to flex his shoulders and arms, bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet before conjuring a small, scarlet orb of magic in his right palm. It’s a perfectly controlled, unreleased,
Dark. There’s simply no other explanation as to how you would die and come back the way you have without the involvement of Dark magic. You even stink of it.”
When he finally pulls away from their embrace, he turns around and finds watery, iridescent green eyes looking back at him. Harry grins at him, and Draco’s arms are once again full of his soulmate, who pulls from his back pocket a small bag of crisps.
“Draco,” Potter starts softly and Draco can detect pity in his voice, “you
“It’s my turn to pick tonight, so yeah,” Harry says, running a hand through his hair as he taps the menus lightly against the edge of the table in front of him.
“Thirty seconds,” Dennis Creevey says, holding up a small timer. Draco quickly draws what looks like arrows coming from out of the baby’s mouth, his face twisted up in disbelief as he points to the arrows.
He takes his key from his pocket. Every noise is amplified in the empty corridor: the faint jangle of the keys, the scrape of metal in the deadlock. The door swings open and he steps inside, noting the apartment is the same way he left it. The curtains are wide open, the setting sun casting the apartment in a gentle amber glow. He walks from room to empty room. The spare bedroom still has a glass of water on the bedside table, half empty.
"Am I right?"
"Malfoy doesn't have friends, he has allies. Trust me, I — "
Harry turns his attention to the boxes and opens the first one.
"I know," Ginny says apologetically. "I only got back from practice twenty minutes ago. Gwen reckons me and Pearson are the best players, and we're the ones the scout might be taking notes on. She must've made me practice the dives a dozen times."
"I was right," Harry says mournfully, pouring himself a glass of the Glenmorangie. "It was depressing." He eyes Draco's new book. "Is that one depressing too?"
"No." Draco kills the engine, yanks the keycard from his pocket and tosses it at Harry. It takes Harry a moment to register what's happening as Draco opens the door, steps out, and slams it shut.
when she gets indignant.”
"You were always so terrified of failure," Harry murmurs.
“I think I know what happened,” Harry says quietly, and both Astoria and Narcissa turn to look at him. “I think you’re right, Narcissa. Draco left voluntarily for three months, but he decided to return and report Lucius’s whereabouts. On the morning of Lucius’s capture, an anonymous tip-off told us his location. But I think perhaps Lucius realised what Draco was going to do, and tried to take both of them back into the past. And it went terribly wrong.” He can imagine the struggle all too well. Perhaps the time-turner broke, or slipped, but either way — only Draco was taken into the past, while Lucius remained behind. In the ensuing chaos as Aurors arrived, Lucius didn’t have the chance to tell anyone what had happened before he was killed.
So he sits and waits until the Healer leaves.
“You have to take it,” Harry said, and Draco understood.
"Well...er, my condolences for the situation, but on the bright side, we now know a lot more about the chemical reactions within magical cores when..." The assistant pauses again.
Draco clears his throat. “I’ll clear the table,” he says, picking up the nearest plate and hurrying to the kitchen.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry's completely bewildered.
He falls asleep with his gaze still lingering on Draco.
Draco hesitates.
With that, he Disapparates.
“Don’t.” Perhaps it’s the potion, perhaps it’s because the realisation is hitting Harry like a wave against a cliff: this might be the last time he ever sees Draco. He doesn’t know if he can ever find him. “I’d rather have you than a memory.”
"Hermione said you were working Malfoy's case. Is that true?"
Harry's breath catches for a second. He stares at Draco, then remembers he's still driving and looks quickly at the road again.
He only loved them, he remembers thinking once, because they were going places.
“You prat!
"Tea's fine."
"I said I'm fine." Draco looks away. "Just tired."
"We could go anywhere," Harry says instead, his voice quiet.
"You're late," she observes.
"Hogwarts," Draco says after a long moment, his gaze still upon the vast and distant mountains, his eyes narrowed slightly in memory. "That's where I ended up. I don't know where my father had intended to go, but that's where I went. Hogwarts." He pauses. "1965. The year my father started attending."
The car rumbles to life. Harry feels terrified and wonders how much the car cost and how mad Matthew might be if Harry, too, drove into the pond.
“I’m sorry,” she says. “I don’t even know what it was transfigured into.”
He watched his wrist shaking, hearing the spoon clink with each tiny movement.
“Alright, Neville?” Harry moved over as Neville entered the compartment, having chatted to Professor McGonagall about his Head Boy duties.
“The darkness,” Draco said. “The darkness.”
The ocean vanishes into a desolate horizon. The sand is wet and dark with rain. The sky is white with winter.
Inside, Draco Malfoy was righting fallen desks and dusting them down. He found their chairs and placed them neatly behind each desk.
At around ten o'clock, Harry goes to bed. He checks on Draco first; Draco appears to be fast asleep, the empty potion vial on the bedside table and a half-glass of water. Harry watches Draco's face for a long moment. Even asleep, he looks troubled somehow, his mouth a thin, unhappy line and a faint tension in his face.
He did it for his friends. Hermione and Ron, always there no matter what. Luna, kidnapped and left to languish in the dark cellars beneath Malfoy Manor. Neville, shouting he'd never, never give up. Ginny, bright and beautiful, always battling on.
Harry looks at Hermione. "Would you listen to him? Merlin, can you tell him it's not that bad?"
And Harry opens his mouth to say
Harry is silent for a moment.
He pulls over to the side of the road. "What is it, Potter?"
* * *
Draco’s smiling at him. “You know it by heart. Don’t try pretending otherwise, Potter.”
feel better about it. It had happened, and that was that. Yes, of course there were nightmares, but everybody has nightmares. Falling from heights or being chased or dying in unpleasant ways, it's all the same. Everyone fears something.
"I know, but the whole team's nerve-wracked about it. Gwen's called us all in for a special debriefing tonight, and we'll be practicing all tomorrow. I'm sorry, I know we were supposed to be going to Ron and Hermione's for dinner tomorrow, but — "
"What am I, the house-elf?"
They arrive in Dover at one o'clock in the morning.
“What?”
Harry, long ago forgetting the purpose of the task and becoming absorbed in tiny details, finds himself poring over the Hogwarts textbooks.
"The memory?" he repeats. Narcissa nods. "I...if it's not too much trouble, I suppose."
He traces a hand over the kitchen counter. It's immaculately clean, as ever. There's a fruitbowl on one end of the counter, although it doesn't contain any fruit. Just some receipts and a handful of knuts and sickles.
Draco frowns. "Are you going to owl my mother? Or Astoria?"
"Got my wand?" he says, and Draco looks bewildered for a moment before he glances at the wand beside the sink.
getting socks now, though!”
Harry goes over to the window and shuts it just to annoy Draco.
“What’s wrong with that?” Harry had retorted, feeling rather defensive, and Holdsworth’s mouth had thinned. She had set him a cold case as his first project — an ancient file from 1949 — and Harry had considered that a calculated insult. Not even something new and interesting, just old files regarding people long gone. He’d made a half-hearted attempt on it before delegating it to the bottom of his desk drawer. At least the Fenwick case was actually within the current decade; Harry regarded it as a slight upgrade.
Hermione says nothing for a long moment. Then she takes a long sip of her tea.
He clutched onto him tightly as they nearly fell, slipping and putting back a hand to catch himself, feeling the wet earth cling to his palm as his other hand grabbed a handful of Harry’s robes again. He managed to haul himself upright with great effort. The two of them ran, stumbling, grimly holding their robes above their heads. The rain pelted their faces, soaking first the front of Draco’s open robes until his thighs were chilled to the bone, then stinging his hands till they burned with cold. He could not even feel his face anymore. It was nearly impossible to see with evening setting in over the storm but at last they were up the castle steps and inside. Harry shook his hair out of his eyes and departed immediately, setting off towards the Gryffindor tower without bothering for words of farewell.
“No,” she says, sounding scandalised. “Draco would never use it. Never! He’d said something to Lucius in an argument about using a time-turner, once — “
* * *
"There yeh go," he says, and Harry walks over to him.
When he Floos back to the apartment, he sees the Renault Mégane keycard sitting on the counter. Well, Draco has to come back for that, at least.
"What?" Harry, suddenly aware that's he staring at Draco and apparently unable to construct coherent sentences, reddens slightly. "Oh. Right. No. I mean, yes."
Harry stands up and slowly opens his door, stepping out into the hallway. Water is running somewhere, he realises, and he glances at the end of the hallway. The bathroom door is open, and Draco is tapping Harry's wand against a paperclip, transfiguring it into a toothbrush. His hair is damp, Harry realises — he must have had a shower — and Draco's clothes look freshly Scourgified.
Empty. The bed is neatly made, the bedside table covered with a thin layer of dust. Hermione is rummaging through the dresser.
"I am
However, help comes from unexpected quarters.
, Draco had said.
She finishes her tea and quickly scurries to the kitchen hearth, throwing a handful of powder into the flames and Floo'ing to the Ministry.
"I wasn't going to." Draco's voice sounds rough, hoarse, but it brings a rush of relief to Harry.
my possessions, I said. And if I recall correctly, you used to carry my driver's licence around sometimes. And my car keycard was frequently in your pocket."
In Potions, when Draco saw his cauldron full of potion, as though nothing had happened, he turned and stared at Harry.
It doesn't matter.
It's a reprieve, at least, and he's always grateful for Hermione and Ron granting him these moments: fleeting scenes of amusement and light smiles, a chance to surface for air.
Then the images flash through him like a series of photographs, like a wild rush of unhappiness. His parents —
"That's interesting."
Harry gets his provisional licence on the thirty-first of October. He Floos to Astoria's house — having officially been linked into her Floo network — and shows Matthew.
In the deep and pristine wilderness of Snowdonia, it had felt like the moon had balanced on his heart, light and clear as the sky itself. Here, in London, it seems to weigh on him, heavy as lead, making it hard to breathe. The weight only grows heavier as they leave the highway and follow increasingly familiar roads. At last, they've reached the apartment block; Draco parks the Renault with the same easy grace he always has, whether he's standing on the edge of a cliff in Cornwall or taking Harry's hand to show him a lake full of stars. For a moment, Harry's heart lifts as Draco walks with him to the stairwell, but then he remembers he's been driving for hours. A cup of coffee before he leaves again would be a basic courtesy, at least.
When Draco reached his common room he waited for his hands to stop trembling, then tried to take out some homework.
“Please don't be sad,” he said. “It makes it darker, the sadness — ”
“Wonder what he’s so mad about?” Harry muttered, turning a corner.
Harry wakes up when the engine stops. They're parked at a lighthouse, he realises. The only car in the windswept parking lot.
“You’re not coming with me. You don’t need to. And I’m not pretending you do, because Molly will see right through that and she’s
"You know how to get to Birmingham?"
Harry had tried talking about that day once, to Draco. “I'm sorry,” he said. “Please don't think that it was easy.”
get to go down the coast. To Cornwall.” He pauses, then — mentally cataloguing Draco’s weak spots and deciding to go for the kill — adds, “Bet you’re going to Treknow. Remember last June? In that little seaside cottage. The one Astoria’s aunt owns. It would be nice to see it again.”
But it does. Harry tries the handle again and this time, the door swings open.
The Shadow came for him at night. These dark creatures on shadowed wings. They came for the weak, they came for the alone. And was he not both?
“What’s a Niffler?” Matthew demands, hoisting Sophie onto the kitchen counter. She eyes the leftover pudding with a calculating expression.
Harry's heart belongs to the rambling houses of stone and wood, the homes that first captured his heart: Hogwarts, a ramshackle and ancient beast of stone and magic and, later on, the Burrow with its cosy rooms and meandering gardens.
"Cold case now, yes." Harry hesitates, but the original case manager already asked Astoria all the generic questions: where did she last see him, was there anyone who wished him harm, and so on. Asking them now will get him nowhere. He takes a sip of tea to collect his thoughts, but he's never been good at interview strategies and so he says the first thing that comes to mind. "I didn't realise you'd remarried."
"Three in the morning, to be exact." Draco glances at Harry. "You have to find me, Potter. This is my last chance. I don't know why it's you, of all people, turning up in my memories — "
He watches the trains. Always taking people away, always bringing people back.
But Draco doesn't seem to have any nervous habits. He does everything precisely, efficiently, Harry thinks, and he remembers Draco's way of driving. Every movement a conscious decision.
A Sunday. Summer is early and settles like a warm cloak over the city, creating a long, sun-steeped afternoon. Harry stands on the balcony and watches the people wander past, children clutching ice lollies as parents stroll along beside them. The sun slowly begins to set, a clear bright dazzle of light on the blue horizon. A single cloud, wispy as a dandelion, slowly disintegrates across the sky.
Wedding rings.
It's a long walk back to the car alone, and a longer drive back to London, but Harry thinks he could get used to long trips.
“What was it like?” Hermione asks, looking intrigued. “I’ve never done Occlumency myself, and I always wondered...”
“Harry?”
He waits for Matthew to gape at him, or at least stare at his scar. But not a trace of recognition seems to cross Matthew's face.
Lucius looks a lot older than Harry remembers. His face is more lined, and he looks tired.
"You spoke to Narcissa," Astoria says as she makes him a cup of tea. She hadn't seemed surprised to see him so soon after sending the owl.
"Well, it's no use blaming anyone," Hermione says suddenly. "You said Malfoy was sick, didn't you? What happened?"
* * *
"That's brilliant news, Ginny," Harry says warmly. It's long been a dream of hers to gain a place on the English National Team.
"Oh, dear," Mr Weasley says slowly. "I'm sorry to hear that, Harry. Not much hope for him then, I suppose. We have a liaison officer for the Met, so — "
“You could try to show a
It's a very long hour. Harry tries to work but he can't. The words seems to trickle away like rain. He can't focus. He reads the fifteenth page of the file over and over.
Looking for himself, or maybe a memory. Maybe, after all this time, he's just looking for a state of mind.
“Well, that’s a weight off my chest,” Draco says. “I was thinking about getting a Niffler, but...”
Harry leans back slightly as the waiter places another glass of rum in front of him, waiting until he's gone away again before lifting the glass and taking a long sip. They receive a reprieve when their meals arrive, at least, and can occupy themselves with eating. Ginny orders another glass of wine and Harry tries a twelve-year whiskey, then follows it with Scottish single malt. The waiter probably considers him an alcoholic, Harry thinks, and by the end of the meal he's delightfully fuzzy-headed and only half-listening to Ginny's Quidditch strategies. Having had too much to drink to trust his Disapparating skills, Harry flags a passing taxi to take him and Ginny home. Ginny seems to enjoy the trip, finding it rather amusing when Harry has to run to the apartment and frantically search for his cache of Muggle money to pay the driver.
Draco hesitates. "Don't contact anyone."
"Do you?" She absently rearranges the teabags. "I know you've been rather obsessed with this case, Harry, and everyone can see it's taken its toll on you. Just promise me you'll rest, all right?"
"Had a chat to Malfoy's solicitor?" Ron asks shrewdly. His time as an Auror has cultivated a surprising amount of cunning.
“About what?” Harry sat in the armchair opposite Ron.
He tried to smile for her. "I'll write letters."
Harry glares at Draco. “You’re doing it again.”
"Good luck. I'm Harry bloody Potter and they still kicked me out."
Harry accepts it, turning it over in his hands. "This...this isn't a car key. There should be a little silver key, probably with a black grip on it and a button or something."
Draco looks back at the road. “After I’ve given you the memory,” he says, “I won’t be able to come back again.”
A car passes them, headlights ghosting across the Renault Mégane, illuminating Draco for a moment. Then the car continues on and they are cast into darkness once more.
Harry frowns, carefully scanning Malfoy for any clues to his disappearance. This is the last anyone saw of him, after all. And it’s the first Harry has seen of Malfoy since the Battle of Hogwarts. The description in the file was right, at least, but Harry supposes they took the details direct from this memory. The weak sunlight, filtering through the narrow windows, catches on the tiny clasp of Malfoy’s black travelling cloak. A silver snitch, Harry thinks with closer inspection, no bigger than the fingernail of Harry’s index finger.
Harry wonders what Draco prefers. The sweeping night sky, or the roaring ocean, or the vast and ancient mountains, the beasts of stone that will stand there long after the last sign of humanity has faded from the earth?
Harry lowers his gaze to look across the field. Maybe it's the same place, maybe it's not.
“I feel nervous, sitting here,” Harry said.
The notes — same as all of Draco's other ones throughout the years — seem to focus on practical techniques and applications rather than theoretical knowledge. He seemed to have had an obsession with documenting each step perfectly, making sure there was no room for error. Harry turns a page.
No reply. He waits a moment, then opens the door.
Malfoy had turned left when he’d left the shop, Harry recalls. There’s only a few shops on the left of the owl emporium, and then it leads straight to the Leaky Cauldron. No other shopkeeper had seen Malfoy, the file notes, and he didn’t pass through the Leaky Cauldron. It stands to reason that somewhere in the short distance between Eeylops and the Leaky Cauldron, Malfoy disappeared.
“I’ve got another job at three, Butterworth,” she says. The man — Butterworth — gives her an irritated look.
"Old enough to show some responsibility for your own actions, Draco. Your decision to accept the Dark Mark was yours alone, as I recall. Your mother advised against it, and I did not comment on the matter."
Astoria pulls a face. “Go home and be sentimental there.”
He drives on, following the winding roads and highways until they feel like an infinite loop, a Möbius strip of rain-dark asphalt and winter-bare fields. It takes him six and a half hours to reach Helston. He stops in Launceston to buy fuel and ends up spending an hour poring over the maps in glovebox. There's a thousand journeys marked along the pages and he wonders if Draco took all the trips so carefully traced along the maps.
"Longbottom also enjoyed watering plants and wore argyle jumpers. Let's face it, he was never a teenager."
He smiles to himself. Hagrid — busy pacing about and muttering to himself — pauses and glances at him before pointing at the ground near his feet.
So instead, he goes and prepares himself for the real reason for his absence from the game: his practical driving test.
“Expecto Patronum,” Harry said softly.
"The same house Astoria lives in now?" Harry says, frowning.
A pause, then Draco reaches out and takes Harry's hand. "Yes," he says.
“To go hunt the Mudbloods!” somebody called out, their voice relishing the word
“Then you've seen him? He stopped by? Did he say anything about me? About us?”
They both turn, as if reaching some unspoken agreement, and open the car doors again. Draco takes the driver's side again and Harry watches his eyes flick to the rear-vision mirror, watching the canola fields fade into the distance.
Someone grabs him; he shouts out and nearly jumps out of his skin. Behind him, Draco starts laughing, his arms still around Harry.
It was so much easier when Draco was nothing but an insignificant memory of a selfish, petty teenager. Long ago, when Harry read headlines about Draco missing and threw the paper away without another thought. When he loved Ginny, when he had his whole career ahead of him, when Draco Malfoy was nothing but a footnote in the pages of Harry's life.
Then he pauses, eyes glazing slightly.
"Where is he?"
"The war changed everyone." Harry's voice is sharp, and he wonders why he feels irked by Narcissa's words.
Harry stands up and goes, once more, to Mr Weasley's office.
“You are. You will
Harry stares at the note for a second, then sets it aside. He stands for a long moment, thinking, then slowly turns to the two boxes stacked next to his bedside table and removes the disillusionment charm.
And when he appears in the middle of the guesthouse room, Draco is there.
Harry's first driving lesson is on Wednesday, at 4pm. He arrives at Astoria's punctually; Matthew arrives late from work and barrels through the front door with arms full of blueprints.
"Away from you," Harry says, and takes off.
The boxes shrink until they're pocket-sized. Harry watches as Draco picks them up and moves towards the door.
"As I said, I am unable to — "
Harry shakes his head. He doesn't know if Narcissa would want Astoria to know. "It doesn't matter. But in it, Malfoy mentioned he never wears his wedding ring."
"Took us to Dover, didn't you? And tomorrow, you'll take us somewhere else. Anywhere, nowhere, wherever."
"Fine! Have the first shower, then," Harry says sullenly. "Hope you slip on the tiles."
"Do you think we could have ever been friends at Hogwarts?" Harry asks impulsively.
The train rushes through, roaring along, the carriages clicking over the rails with precise repetition. Draco stares ahead and Harry's wondering if he's counting carriages.
Draco adjusts the mirrors. "I see you've been rearranging things, Potter," he says coolly, but Harry isn't bothered. He can see the faint tremble in Draco's hands, the way Draco hides his nerves by looking at the fuel gauge, checking the mirrors, readjusting his grip on the steering wheel.
"You're impulsive, you never stop to think about things, you can't compartmentalise — the worst person for detective work."
Harry nods and leaves, and finally — in the privacy of his bedroom — he can bite his lip hard enough to taste blood, and sit on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands, his palms pressed against his eyes until he sees sparks. The anger's still there, but now a rush of sorrow is coursing through him, and there's confusion too, and worry and almost panic, and hidden in all of that is a hint of happiness and relief. He takes a slow, deep breath, and stands, taking another moment to compose himself before returning to the kitchen. Draco's made himself a cup of tea, Harry sees, and somehow it's reassuring.
Then Ginny says, "Neither did I."
“Yes — it might be best if you go, Draco,” Shacklebolt had said quietly, and Draco stormed from the room. He listened on the other side for ages but all he heard was indistinct voices and then his mother had ushered the Minister out politely and told Draco “Everything is alright now.” But it wasn’t, with these voices hissing at him, the faces melting into shadows…they sounded like snakes…
He goes to work the next morning. There's four owls waiting outside his office, and Harry's heart slowly sinks. That can't bode well.
Malfoy crosses the room in a short number of strides and leaves, his footsteps fading down the hallway, and the memory dissolves to nothing.
"Or started."
And maybe he views it as a failure — running away three years ago — but he came back, and then he ran away again after their argument — but he came back. Four days, but he came back and apologised.
spouse. Take your Harry and go, please.”
"I know," he repeats.
"Focus, Hermione," Harry says sharply. This isn't the time for intellectual curiosity. "Can we bring Draco back?"
Butterworth doesn't reply to that one, but he arrives twenty minutes later with a tattered book under one arm.
"Calm down, Mad-Eye," Draco snaps. "And keep your hands off my wand."
Still...it’s close enough to suit Harry's current case.
Except maybe in a Renault Mégane, burning down the M27 at midnight, tracing the lines of relationships across the land.
Draco Malfoy knows him better than Harry knows himself.
Narcissa listens to him carefully, her eyes studying him as if he's a particularly difficult rune. Then she leans back slightly, clasping her hands in her lap.
Harry stops. In the distance, he can still hear the children laughing. Closer to him is the soft sound of the waves breaking over the rocks.
“Course he is, why would they replace him?”
That line had waited at the top of his parchment for several days now. He hated lying. He dipped his quill and wrote.
Harry puts his hands in his pockets. The Renault's keycard nudges against his fingers and there's something reassuring about the cool, smooth plastic.
"Anywhere?" Harry repeats, just to make sure Draco can't hear him.
But of course, there's no dualities. Just degrees of difference.
* * *
Monday morning.
No more, no less.
* * *
“Each one required a time-turner to rescue the trapped person,” she says quietly. “And not just any time-turner, but the same one the person used to travel to the other time.”
"That's because it's her
And then the door is swinging open and Draco strides straight through Harry as if he's a ghost. Harry stumbles back automatically, then watches as Draco disappears down the hallway.
"Don't you keep your promises, Potter?"
The silver bell chimes gently as Harry enters the shop, and he's struck by a profound sense of déjà vu. By the counter, the grey-haired shopkeeper glances up.
know your name?" She pauses, then sighs. "Sorry, I've been stuck here all day waiting for a Healer to give us some news, any news — Sophie, don't touch people's hair, it isn't polite — and it's just been a nightmare."
He Disapparates to the apartment, appearing in the foyer, and takes the stairs rather than the elevator. Level one, level two, level three, level four...
“Ugh, no. Ask Hermione, she likes explaining things.”
. Of course, when Fenwick went missing, his son had only been nine or ten. Now he's seventeen.
"I am in need of an owl. Speed is less important than accuracy." He blinks, feeling unsettled by the taste of foreign words in his mouth; singing a song that isn't his.
“What?” Harry asks irritably, lifting his head from the pensieve.
make any suggestions. You will sit in silence and think about what you’ve done.”
"All right, fine," she says, turning back to Harry, "but I've got one last question for you, Harry. When was the last time you spoke to Ginny — "
He picks up the pale blue folder and lets it fall open.
"Oh, so there's like...a wizard police, sort of thing? Like Scotland Yard, but magic?"
"He's
The Investigative Division offices are far more quiet. Harry unlocks the door to his office and steps inside.
Matthew greets Harry first. He's sitting in an overstuffed armchair by the fire, reading a newspaper, and he jumps sharply, cursing, when Harry steps out of the flames.
"Oh, no," she says warningly. "You want something. Possibly illegal, certainly difficult, and definitely dangerous."
"When?"
* * *
Harry turns around. The field seems empty, the canola plants swaying gently in the night air. He frowns, his brow creasing, and drops his hands to his side, his fingers slowly uncurling. The silent night gives nothing away; not the slightest footstep nor the faintest draw of breath. Harry takes a step backwards.
“What, that nutter in Azkaban?” another piped up to more guffaws.
"All right. I think it's time for someone's nap, anyway." And he stands up, lifting a helplessly-giggling Sophie over one shoulder as he walks from the room. Harry waits a moment, listening to Sophie's giggles fade, and then turns to stare at Astoria.
Unlikely. The team captain, Gwen, could get a bit overenthusiastic and micromanage every detail; she reminds Harry uncannily of Oliver Wood.
“Harry,” she says, “I think Malfoy had a time-turner.”
A storm gathers the next day, and it reminds Harry of that night watching the storms roll in over the Celtic Sea, Draco's pale skin and blond hair in beautiful contrast with the dark bruised skies.
"Are you together?" the receptionist asks.
"New assignment."
Harry wasn’t sure exactly what reaction would be appropriate and so he settled for saying nothing, but watched Ron carefully. He had been so easy to read before the war; now, things were different. His brother’s death had changed him.
The familiar ache settles into Harry's heart. He knows that nostalgia well. Back when his biggest obstacles were homework and detentions. Back when the cruelest thing Draco ever did was throw a Remembrall across the sky.
Had Draco been depressed?
"I took a scenic route through Portsmouth. It's nice, driving the coast this time of year. Not much traffic."
He reaches across and takes Draco's hand. Draco looks startled, but he doesn't resist.
He went straight to the library, with vague study plans in mind (although he was without books, quills and parchment) but bumped straight into Harry. Harry took in his rain-spattered face, his wind-mangled robes.
"Oh, was I supposed to?" Harry's amused.
It doesn't take long for Harry to spot a flash of silver.
As the moon reaches its zenith and begins its almost-imperceptible descent, he vanishes with a faint pop.
She declines with a faint shake of her head. "No, thank you."
He returns to the office. Follows a lead on the Staffordshire witch, who was sighted near a hospital, and by the time he returns to his office again it's half-six in the evening. He takes a long time to file paperwork, tidy his desk, fetch his cloak from the peg even though they're on the cusp of summer and the weather really isn't warranting of extra layers.
"They always do that," he says, looking peeved. "Always. I'll be standing there, minding my own business, and they'll come up to me and start chatting away. It's maddening."
Sometimes, he thinks, it's like there's only one of them living in the apartment.
Harry doesn't remember falling asleep, but when he wakes up the lights of Margate have long disappeared. Inky black fields surround them, and there's not another car in sight.
Harry follows Draco a few steps away from the car. “Where are we?”
Astoria straightens up, looking attentive. "You saw the car? Oh, it's been a long time since I saw that thing. I almost miss it.
He wakes early, before sunrise. He stands on the balcony and looks out across the dark line of the Cornish coast. The predawn air is crisp with a salted ocean breeze, but soon it will be tempered by a warm summer day. It's the seventeenth of June, Harry remembers.
"You didn't sell it?"
He tries, unsuccessfully, to wake Draco again, but Draco seems completely unresponsive. Almost comatose.
Harry caught the others’ eyes. Hermione had a tentative look on her face, Ron just looked confused.
"Anyway, it's true, isn't it?" Ron says shamelessly. "Ginny's been unbelievably busy, really throwing herself into Quidditch lately..."
* * *
A new perspective.
"It's all right."
The trees bend their boughs all at once, bringing a great rush of water down upon them. After a moment, Hermione blinks at Harry through her mop of drenched hair. Then —
"I'm tired."
He goes downstairs at seven and takes an hour to eat breakfast. His appetite seems to have vanished. He wonders if he should go back home, but there is no home. The apartment is nothing more than a box in the sky. Hogwarts — his first home, his real childhood home — is forever gone, accessible only by memory. It's home to a thousand other children now, and it's a bittersweet thought. And everywhere else in his life he's merely been a visitor, a stranger. He may have lived with the Dursleys for seventeen years, but it was never home; he may have considered The Burrow his home too, but the people have long gone — Ginny always travelling, the rest all moved out or married — and the rooms are empty.
Hermione shuts her book and levels him with a look. "Good potion brewers, or shady potion brewers?"
* * *
“Astoria,” Matthew says quietly. She glances at him but doesn’t respond. Narcissa looks at Astoria, then stares at Harry.
All those times, standing on the balcony and gazing at the world, and Draco was there with him...
"Into the wine already, Hermione? For shame," Harry says, smiling, and she smacks his arm.
Now, Harry tilted his head slightly, listening as Slughorn spoke quietly to Draco.
" — unemployed for six months! But the Ministry doesn't care, does it? Just sends out brainless trolls like you to stand there and parrot from the rulebook — "
But Narcissa shakes her head firmly. “No. Draco regretted many things, but he made it very clear the past should never be revisited. The more Lucius spoke of using the time-turner, the more Draco argued about the danger of it and criticised Lucius’s obsession with the past.” She hesitates, then glances away. “In the end,” she says, so quietly that Harry has to lean forward to hear her, “Draco said that if Lucius insisted on this madness, he would report him to the authorities. In the end, Draco...Draco took the time-turner and transfigured it, to disguise it. He refused to tell his father where it was.”
"I received your owl," she says, and Harry's forced to decline the offer of tea (a house-elf lingers hopefully in the background, carrying a full tea service). Perhaps Narcissa catches the impatience in his eyes, in his restless hands, for she shakes her head slightly and takes him straight to the stables.
Hermione’s new health kick, but fear of her scolding kept him in line, at least when she was present. He doesn’t know how she’s staying up-to-date with her new health initiatives while working her high-pressured Ministry job, and planning the wedding of the year. At first the health craze was just driving Ron mad, but an out-of-his-mind Ron meant a more anxious-than-usual Harry. Ron’s incessant complaining was the least of his problems now. Hermione was now sending
“Darling, I love you, I do...but sometimes I question whether or not I should disembowel you.”
“What does this honour entail?” he slurs, swaying slightly as he sits up in his seat. Parkinson lowers her half-eaten wrap, her face lighting up in excitement.
“I wasn’t,” Harry says quickly.
“You know there’s this little food stall in Carkitt Market that sells Dragon Rolls that lets you breathe out actual fires,” Potter says. “But, I don’t mind the non-firestarter version.”
Once Draco was strong enough to stand on his feet, Potter tried to convince him that they needed to leave, fast, and make their way to Grimmauld Place believing that they’d find more information within his personal office. Draco, still reeling with the lingering effects of his newly reclaimed memory and the overwhelming feeling of concern that’s now situated itself in the centre of his chest for Granger, wanted instead to track her down.
“Stop, Draco,” Potter intones angrily. The people at the table a metre away from them turn to stare.
you, Draco. It was us, all that time ago,” Theo says, stepping a bit closer to him. “We were each other’s first loves.”
“I can’t.”
Once the first tear had fallen, the rest followed, cascading down Draco’s cheeks as he falls to his knees, his sob breaking into a strangled cry. He falls forward, his arms holding him up and his hands curling into fists against the stone ground as his mouth opens in a silent cry before it’s strangled out of him, the muscles in his stomach clenching, the stab wound still tender and smarting. When he leans forward to rest his forehead against the cool stone, he finally breaks down. The force of his cries consuming him violently, his body shaking with the force of it. He pushes back onto his knees, his face wet and flustered. He smooths back the strands of hair caught on his cheeks as he looks up at the white marble apparition. He bites back a gasp when he sees that Harry’s eyes are open and staring down at him.
“Harry, breathe in and out slowly! You’re safe, you’re at home, nothing can hurt you...it’s okay, it’s
won’t take care of it?”
Malfoy spins back around and laughs, his face close to Harry’s. “Is that the best you can do?”
under Malfoy’s breath.
, Draco…”
Harry wraps his arm around Draco’s shoulder. “Thank you, my love.”
“Fuck you, Granger.”
“What do you want to do with it?” Harry asks, his throaty voice sounding almost distant, a far away gust of words that Draco can’t fully comprehend as he draws the thick head of Harry’s cock into his mouth, hoping it’s a sufficient answer. Draco sucks and licks, exploring, seeing how far his lips can stretch, how deep he can take Harry.
Draco doesn’t want to be a monster. And as these thoughts grip him, he can feel his walls cracking even more as the drain of mental and physical exhaustion sets in. His left arm twitches, feeling heavy and weak. “I’ll help you. I’ll make sure you cross over, Potter. Just tell me what I need to do.”
Draco sags against the wall before he slumps down onto the floor of the shower, wrapping his arms around his knees. “N-no!” Draco shouts, heart thudding against his ribcage in anxiety. It’s not often he turns down a shared shower— not even the threat of being late for a meeting deters him —  but he doesn’t want Potter to see his useless, battered body. “I’ll be out in a minute.”
Harry shakes himself, the anger draining from his face, his eyes frozen open, a vein pulsing at his temple. He slowly walks Draco back against the wall, knocking a couple of pictures free as he presses him there, his grasp loosening on his arms so he can wrap them around Draco’s waist instead, tucking his face into the crook of Draco’s neck. Harry begins to weep.
Potter clears his throat and moves closer towards Draco. As Potter inches closer to him, Draco leans further back in his seat, that heady excitable energy he noticed the last time he was this close to Potter coming off like waves from him, desperately wanting to spill over. When Potter makes his way around the small table between them, he sits in the armchair next to Draco. He holds out the shortest tumbler filled nearly to the brim with amber liquid.
” Draco hisses. With Potter pressed against him like this, Draco’s feeling overheated and short of breath. It’s taking every bit of his control to keep the threat of unpleasant, brutalising thoughts from dragging him to a place he now only visits in his dreams. He pushes on.
Harry’s a mess.
girl with
She then casts the diagnostic.
It’s Luna’s birthday, and there are too many people in the house. Too many people he’s hurt in the past, too many people who would have no qualms trying to hurt him if they all didn’t spend so much time shooting him pitying looks. Everyone knows why he’s living with Pansy. Everyone knows he witnessed his Mother’s death and they pity him. They pity the poor, useless ex-Death Eater turned Healer turned Unspeakable. He’s non-threatening now, because he’s too sad to be anything else but pathetic.
Pansy’s hands are immediately on Draco. Draco tries to wave her off. Her voice rings startlingly clear. “He’s soaked. Help me get him to the sitting room, it’s much cooler there if we open the balcony doors.”
she opens her mouth.
at the bar.”
The village and people of Montmartre changed Draco. He learned to let go of his anger and to openly acknowledge the pain and trauma he carried from the war. He was calmer there. He felt more rooted to what he wanted in life, what he felt he could offer to others, and what he needed to be happy.
He loved that Ginny never stayed away for more than a work day. During her training weeks, she’d take the Floo back to Grimmauld after a gruelling practice in Wales, only to slip out in the wee hours the next morning for another round. She never complained about it, and he was confident enough to chalk it up to her enjoying those quiet nights shared with him, eating popcorn, and watching
A hand wraps around Draco’s—Blaise’s—as he glances between Pansy and Draco and asks softly, “I don’t understand, why didn’t you tell us?”
Harry drops a kiss onto Draco’s lips before leading himself towards Draco’s slick whorl. Draco shivers when he feels the head pop inside of him, his mouth sliding open as he gasps.
Draco allows himself to enjoy the gentle kisses before the realisation of just how disgusting he’s being hits him. He just finished being played by Bitty and fucked by Blaise, and now he’s here, kissing Harry like nothing’s happened. A hot, acidic taste of bile creeps up the back of his throat and he gags, turning his head away. He swallows the taste back.
“Yeah?"
He finishes his danish and tea in record time and slips on his starchy white lab coat before taking a short stroll down the office corridors of Level 9.
disgusting, Draco, and you’re not damaged, for fuck’s sake. You’re the most amazing, most beautiful person I’ve ever known. I’m so lucky to call you my boyfriend," Potter says in a quiet, soothing tone. "You’ve grown so much since the war, Draco. I don’t want you to continue living in the past. You’ll be okay. Panic attacks happen.” Potter opens his arms and Draco leans into his chest, his fingers grasping the front of his shirt as he calms down. He feels weak. He should tell Potter right now what happened to him, but everything in his head is a jumble and his heart is beating too fast.
Merlin. He’s fucked.
I want your gnashing of teeth. Come
remorse against pale shades of pink, plush lips.
Not a person.
Harry would tease: “You gave birth to yourself.”
It’s risky—and stupid—when Draco admits it to himself, but when he reaches the loo and throws himself into an empty stall, all he can think about is his snuff bullet.
if they aren’t hiding something nefarious? He scrambles to his feet, eager to see what the Flint’s are hiding. He squats before the small, open space and closes his eyes. He’s not able to use magic to sense if there’s any curses or hexes on things, but he’s noticed the more he’s practiced protective magic, the more sensitive he’s been to Dark objects or magic. Like he’s noticed with many of these Pureblood households, no one ever assumes that they’re going to be exposed, and so they keep their crimes out in the open. And Edward Flint is no different.
He grabs the microphone from Draco’s hands and shuts it off. It’s as if everything’s slowed down around him as his eyes meet the eyes of the person that broke his heart. The backup music and vocals continues to drone on obnoxiously as Dean and Cho Chang approach him. He flushes in embarrassment. He also notices that Cho is heavy with child, one hand protectively placed on her belly as she waddles towards him.
,” Harry chokes out.
For once in the many years he’s known Pansy, he feels sorry for her. He watches as she leans against the wall, utter dismay clear across her face. Harry can see her conflicted expression and the quiver of her painted lips. Only a few more beats pass before she pulls herself together. With a snap of her fingers, she Summons a compact mirror, using a red lacquered finger to brush away the tears on her cheeks. She straightens up as the compact disappears. She takes another deep breath and the anguished tilt of her mouth melts into a playful sneer. Just watching the forced transformation makes Harry’s heart ache in sympathy. She walks off in the direction Ginny went, no doubt back to the party, ready to pretend to be the life of it.
is the appropriate time to scramble out the shop, but it’s too late – a worker is now trying to get his attention.
something wrong with me,” Harry says weakly. “I’m unlovable. Always have been, always will be. I’ve been on the outside looking in my entire life. I’m just not meant for it.”
“Follow me.” Smith turns on his heel to head towards the room.
“Mother,” Draco says automatically, resting his chin on his right knee, a small smile gracing his lips.
“Of course, pet,” Bart murmurs, but he doesn’t move, piercing eyes still fixed on Harry.
“What?” he asks, bemused.
“I used to believe in soulmates. But I’m not quite sure anymore. Too many things have happened in my life to make me think it’s all a lie. Or, at least it’s something only a chosen, divine few are gifted with.” He can see the ball of emotion Draco swallows. “I was never meant to make it to this age, let alone experience something as grand as a soulmate.”

“I guess I’m still wrapping my head around this whole gay thing,” Ron mutters. They both stop laughing to gape at him. The feather boa slides off Harry’s neck to land beside him on the sofa. Ginny’s eyes narrow and she plants her hands on her narrow hips.
“You know it’s true. Why else would your pathetic father be in business with rubbish like Marcus and Edward Flint?” Blaise scowls down at her, shaking her wrist. “Think for a minute, my darling! Are you so determined to climb the social ladder that you’re blind to the impact the whims and fancies of a gormless family like the Flints have on your family, or
him relentlessly. It was beyond investigative. You
Draco presses his face into Harry’s shoulder. Breathes in the sharp scent of him, cinnamon and amber. “I love you. After all this time, I love you as if it’s the first day I fell in love with you. The strength of it has never, ever wavered. If you won’t marry me now, maybe we can start over and see if we can...if we can get back to a place where a family, and marriage, and the promise of old age is a possibility for us again? I would do anything.”
“Pardon. What did you say?”
Draco had any semblance of basic consent and safety ripped from him through stranger rape. In response, he struggled with coming to terms with the realities of his assault, and how it impacted his already precarious relationship with Harry. Ultimately, through his established relationship, we explored how couples can handle (or not handle) rape in both verbal and non-verbal ways.

“We’ve lost five people already to that monstrous apparition, Draco. Either we try something a bit more drastic to see if we can free them and obtain positive results, or we need to terminate the project and come forward to the DMLE and the general public.”
“I’m not leading him on!” he lashes out. “I fucking care about the prat! I just don’t…” he trails off, running a hand through his hair, now regretting the last sip of Scotch as his head swims. He sits his glass down.
Ron exclaims, snapping his fingers. “Hermione on a bad day!”
safe!” Draco hisses as they make their way towards the lifts. Potter is eerily calm after his revelation and it irks Draco fiercely. “We should track her down, find a way to break her free.”
Granger steps up to him, her brown eyes flashing dangerously up at him. “I’ve noticed lately that you go through nearly the entire day Occluding. Not an iota of emotion in those pretty, stormy grey eyes of yours, Malfoy.”
that something was wrong with us! The entire time we were together, you were thinking ‘me’ while I was foolishly thinking ‘us’, so don’t you
“Of course I do,” says a gentle voice, Parvati’s head floating in his fireplace.
Pansy, beautiful, loyal friend that she is, finds him immediately and puts all those preparations to rest by becoming his focal point. She too, is wearing an enormous white Sunday hat with a whopping bow on the front.
are carved into the wood of the bench.
“You’re quite mistaken. I would never say something so crass and problematic. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a shift at the hospital tonight and would like to drop all this stuff off home beforehand,” he says, gesturing to his shopping bags. “Have a nice day.” Malfoy gives him a curt nod, the corner of his mouth lifting just so as he slings his bags onto his shoulder and walks away.
Padma nods, Summoning the box to the kitchen.
but what he says instead is an awed, “You’re so beautiful.”
“So…what are you on about?” Harry asks gently, now coming to stand before Draco.
Draco tries to hide his flinch as he shoves his hands into the front pockets of his trousers, a scowl tipping his lips downward. “Are you going to let me in or not?”
Draco stiffens. “Well, you’re pathetic right along with me, aren’t you? You’re bloody stealing from a seventeen-year old girl.”

“She’s your mother. Soon to be my mother-in-law and it’s not a secret that she’s...unfond of me. I was hoping you’d be a bridge of sorts, facilitating a peaceful dialogue.”

“What about Tracey’s father?”
them. It hits him then just how unnecessarily cold he’s been towards them and vows to do better moving forward.
“But how?”
” Potter shouts.
Potter scratches the back of his head sheepishly. “Er, no. I’m pansexual.”
“Are you kidding, Potter?” Draco barks out a laugh. “The Chief Prosecutor probably put the damn thing there himself.”
“I see we’re both wearing Gucci tonight,” Pansy says as Draco helps her out of the black limousine.
Draco rolls his eyes, but shimmies to untuck his arms from his chest to instead wrap around Harry’s neck. “Okay, go on, I like where this is heading.”
“You almost choked to death because of Har—Potter?
It’s a lie, Draco thinks. Nothing about what he’s queued up to face will ever make him feel better. Marcus and his father are going to make sure he suffers before they kill him.
“I was thirsty, so I went to the kitchens and found this lovely item along the way.” Theo explains with a shrug, now handing the silver platter over to Draco, who quickly removes the lid to hand back to Theo. “I see what I see, and I like what I like.”
“It just makes you feel really calm. I enjoy it a lot,” Luna says.
When Draco was almost five years old he visited Grimmauld Place for the first and only time. Aunt Walburga had been incredibly frail at the time, her severe dark features making her look even scarier in her gaunt state. He had been terrified of her, her dark, dank house, and decrepit old house-elf. But she’d been dead for decades now, and there was no reason for the irrational dread he’s been feeling since Potter uttered the address. He blamed it on the Curse.
“I don’t think he’ll be visiting us again,” Mia says smoothly, wrapping her arm around Pansy’s shoulders. “Now that he knows boorish behaviour results in painful hexes.”
Draco wonders if she knows her classmate, Susan Bones, is dead or if she thinks the woman has simply stopped responding to whatever owls she sends. He catches sight of Abbott, still as blonde as ever, still wholesome-looking, and now accompanied by a rather fit Neville Longbottom, his arm draped across her shoulders. Draco’s stomach flops unpleasantly when his gaze finally lands on Harry, Granger, and Weasley. Harry doesn’t acknowledge him at all.
, Potter. I,” Pansy pauses, drawing in a shuddering breath. “I need you to take care of him. I need you to get your head out of your arse and
Draco pauses, Harry’s words sinking in. He sighs. “I know you’re not trying to pressure me into anything, Harry. I just...I just want to be honest with you. I don’t even know what it means anymore to be someone’s boyfriend. I want to be with you, but we have to go slow, whatever that looks like. I want to figure it out because I do have feelings for you.”
Draco’s startled surprise makes Harry gently squeeze his hand. “For what, Harry?” he asks, confused.
“Blaise, what-what’s wrong?” comes Pansy’s tired voice.
“If you don’t start acting like a grown up for me, I’ll have to start withholding things from you as if you’re a naughty child,” Draco sighs, pushing his lips out in a pout.
“This has been nice,” Draco starts coolly, “but I have to go now.”
” Draco hisses warningly. Harry shrugs. They’ve had this conversation too many times. Mercifully, Draco changes the subject. “What are we supposed to do in here?”
The lids of her eyes lower and a serious look suddenly takes over her playful one. “Who said anything about my girlfriends? Why would I want to share what’s ours with them
“What?” Theo says distractedly, using the back of his hand to wipe across his nose. “All better.”
People have an idea of the kind of person they think he is now, post-war, and it’s not this tightly-wound man on the precipice of physical violence. No. He’s
“Yeah, why?” Harry grunts. He doesn’t want to show just how disappointed he is over missing out on the Thickey Ward, but he’s never been that great at compartmentalising his feelings.
“I got your message from Lyra, no scolding from my end and the round of drinks didn’t fool Blaise, so, I need a bit more of
“Why would they be in Berkshire?” Pansy asks.
Draco follows his finger to a date listed on the missing person’s report for Layla Hughes. He then looks up the date for Troy Crawford, Preti Singh, Jacquelyn Flores, and Hunter Li. Draco suddenly feels ill, a creeping dread filling his stomach.
Draco nods and tries to sound bland. “Right. Whatever you say, Potter.”
“Mmm…your heart rates a bit fast, are you sure you’re alright?” Draco asks after a few beats. Harry clears his throat and wrenches his arm away from the other man’s grasp.
Confused, Draco clears his throat. “I don’t...I don’t really
Draco sinks his fingers once more into Harry’s hair, pulling him in for another kiss.
“I won’t apologise! Draco is mean. Gran was never mean like that! She always let me wear my own clothes and she always called me Thea!”
“I don’t know...a panic attack?” Draco croaks.
“A man after my own heart, serenading me with such lovely, kind adulations,” Harry mutters dryly, sitting down.
, Draco thinks as he takes the narrow back staircase that leads to the kitchen. The old Parkinson house in Greenwich is an abandoned and debilitated monstrosity of a structure with its peeling wallpaper, drafty rooms, and old Victorian furniture. Draco, Luna, and Millicent share the naked-walled attic, a bathroom connecting their tiny rooms.
“Soft, just like my Hannah,” he said, leaning into her.
When Draco agreed to join Blaise in Rome during the Winter, he found himself attracted to Bitty and her flippant, flirtatious nature. Draco loved that she was freshly out of school and ready to take on those around her. And although she made him nervous with her flirting, Draco admired that she offered Slytherin traits he was conditioned to find enticing—all the wealth, power, and intelligence without ever having been in the House. He adored her soft, titillating accent, smooth olive skin, and wide almond-shaped eyes.
“Malfoy?” he asks again. He’s about to poke the other man in the shoulder when he hears what sounds like
, but it was
He flinches, thinking the man from the loo has followed him out to the bar. His whole body becomes rigid as he leans to the side, desperate to put space between him and this unwanted stranger, but it’s Harry that’s squeezing himself beside Draco.
“Come on, we’ll be
The potion vials. The smarting cheek. The dull ache all over his body and in places he’s too ashamed to even think about. All of it. The reality of the situation is a powerful fist of anguish that punches him square in his chest. He feels as if he’s drowning, too many emotions consuming him at once, and he thinks,
“Harry.”
“No. Fuck you, Malfoy. If you want to do this, you better keep your head in the game, whatever that means for you. All the way. Nothing half-arsed because we’ll both be strung up on the line if this fails or if someone gets hurt. I’m woman enough to admit that this is both brilliant and utterly fucking terrifying, but I’m ready to do the work if you are.”
you look good too,” Draco says, the words tripping on his tongue. .
Harry believes that something dead coming back to life hurts. Draco knows that he’s been dead on the inside since the end of the war, despite having sought out change and even love. He knows he’s failed. He knows he buried his chances at a real life by becoming embroiled in this Ministry scandal. He knows that he’s made mistakes in trusting the wrong people. He knows that Harry’s not a bandaid to alleviate these mistakes, but someone Draco loves. Someone that wants the best for him. Someone that makes Draco believe he can learn to love himself. He’s realising that maybe, just maybe, it might be worth suffering through all that pain of self-acceptance to break his cycle of depression, if Harry will be on the other side of it with open arms.
Padma Patil is sitting at the large, round kitchen table, her waist-length hair braided, coiled, and pinned at the back of her head. Draco only pauses briefly at the foot of the low-ceiling staircase as their eyes meet. Padma takes a small sip from her steaming cup of English Breakfast. Draco glances down and finds that she has, like she has done nearly every day for the last six months, prepared him a cup of tea. He walks over to the table and eases gracefully onto the chair beside her. Padma slides the cup over to him and with a jerky nod, he picks it up and quietly sips.
“Okay, mate! Enough of that, now, you’re going to make yourself sick,” Harry says calmly, moving to crouch down into the fort beside Teddy’s flailing little body. As Harry pushes back Teddy’s unruly jet-black hair from his flushed tear-stained face, his wails ease, and he begins to sniffle. “Tell me what’s wrong, love.”
“You just...you look lovely…so lovely.”
“Yes!” Malfoy happily shouts as he stumbles over his own feet and catches himself on the corner of his chesterfield. His eyes are bloodshot as he staggers onwards to his rather impressive entertainment centre. Harry can see from his spot the neat twenty-ish rows of CD cases and vinyls lining the wall, and upon closer inspection, notices all of Malfoy’s music is categorised by genre, and further by musician, and finally by year of release. Merlin. What an anal-retentive arse.
…” Draco pulls him in for a filthy kiss, his fingers tight in Potter’s hair, their hard cocks sliding against each other. “
‘Oh, look! I bought some suede Gucci loafers, there goes heartbreak flying out the goddamn window!’” Harry says hysterically, his arms flying up in the air.
Draco sighs happily before slowly pulling away, his lower lip once again trapped between his teeth. Draco leans forward to wipe the tears from Harry’s cheeks.
“Oh no, the eggs!” Draco says, rushing over to the stove. Harry follows him, leaning over the skillet to assess their ruined breakfast. They grin at each other.
in my life is escalating, but it doesn’t matter because there’s no point in bloody changing when everyone around you hates you and you hate yourself.”
She sighs. “We need to power the Veil another way. Each person, though valuable, has been a weak attempt in securing a two-way portal of communication. It’s just sucking in people who have been touched by death and trapping them. We’ve been assuming that their memories of their Limbo and the desire to see their lost ones beyond the Veil is enough to create a connection. And don’t get me wrong, I think the Amortentia-Death sublingual tablet is brilliant in easing the participant into being ready to face the Veil, but in this sense, it’s not allowing free-will in our participants, even if they do display a desire to communicate successfully or stay within that happy space. It’s not enough. An NDE is not enough. We need someone who has straddled both realms and won’t need an aid like the tablet, and someone who can harvest Dark, Light, and love magic all at once within their very soul. I think we should find someone who’s given and taken life by their own hands. I think it would truly open the Veil for communication to the other side.”
“What’s your poison?” Potter asks.
Merlin. This dog he stole away has become his only true friend.
“Er, yeah. Thank you,” Harry says, the shock clear in his voice. Malfoy smirks, and turns back to the machine. Harry stumbles over to the long island in the centre of the kitchen, gingerly perching on one of the tall, black sleek stools.
keeps finding people you’ve shagged for interviews, it’s completely awful what they say about you!
“Hermione gave me all the information I needed. This isn’t about you. It’s not about Hermione. The simple fact is I’m intrigued and I want to be invested. The only condition is that we try to keep my involvement a secret from your department head. If Hermione doesn’t trust him, I don’t trust him.
“He wouldn’t do that to me,” Draco says vehemently.
life!
Harry holds him tighter. “It makes me think of you.”
Draco gives him a knowing look. “Don’t worry, okay? It’s going to be fun.”
Harry then pushes Draco’s hair back, a wild laugh escaping him as he smiles down at Draco. “You love me on top of you, don’t you?”
“Draco.”
Smith hits Draco’s chest, and this time a sickening crack sounds, before punching him in the stomach right after. Draco spits up blood, as white hot pain overrides his thoughts, his vision blurring with tears, sweat, and blood. Smith hits him again and Draco knows he’s going to die—he can feel his pulse slowing, his thoughts becoming muddled, his breathing laboured. The voices around him are drowning out, and Draco’s long since stopped screaming from each terrible impact of Smith’s fist on his body. He can feel his life pouring out of him, and he struggles to keep his eyes open long enough to watch Harry, to make sure Harry survives.
“You’re an arse. But I agree. We’ll hold off on telling your God that he’s allowed to ridicule your Magnum Opus.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry cries. “I didn’t mean to scare you, I’m so sorry.”
He grabs his wand and whips it in the air, casting the strongest Silencing Charm he can muster as he lets out an anguished scream, hands coming up to grip his hair.
“Fuck off, Potter!
“They’re so full of it! As if we don’t know all the awful things they say about their daughter-in-law and her family. And they’re
“Oh, thank you. And do call me Narcissa,” she says pleasantly, taking her seat. “I feel it’s rather appropriate after all this time.”
Draco strangles out a laugh, straightening up, the trembling easing away. “Have to resort to Muggle methods, eh, Smith? Afraid to continue trying me in a duel? Or seeing who can best whom in Dark spells?” Draco asks, uncaring of the throbbing pain or feel of blood dripping over his lips to smear across his teeth as he grins.
“Harry, wait,” Draco rushes out. Harry pauses in his steps.
says? Are you in a heated, BDSM-heavy, polyamourous relationship with Ginevra and Blaise?” Draco taunts.
He sits on the toilet, propping his briefcase in his lap to pop it open before using his wand to unlock the hidden compartment where his bullet hides. He pulls it out and squeezes his eyes shut as he runs his tongue across the back of his teeth. It would be so easy to just take two pulls so his jumbled mass of nerves can be replaced with euphoria.
Draco covers his mouth with his hand briefly, hiding his trembling lips. “Thank you,” he says once he feels strong enough.
Then something catches Draco’s gaze— something stuck onto the wall above his fireplace. He gets to his feet, Sprinkles still cradled to his chest. He nearly drops her as his blood runs icy cold through his veins.
,” Draco says, mostly to himself, but hoping that if he says it aloud it will somehow get rid of the hallucinated imprint of Potter.
“Yeah, and well, I was going to mention it but, I don’t know. I felt a bit strange about it.”
To think I would let your whorish mother, a Malfoy, outbid an Angelli! You’re insane.”
“We look crazy,” Draco mutters, his arms wrapped around his body as they walk down Portobello Road. He looks at himself in the window of a passing shop, his hair wild, windswept. He then looks over his shoulder when he hears something collide against a rubbish bin. It’s just a cat. “We’re going to get mugged.”
Panic seizes Harry immediately. Had he not been completely immobile, he sure he’d be shuddering. “What the hell is going on?” Harry asks, his voice shaking.
, the faded Dark Mark on his left arm being a prime example. He’s not brave at all. It’s something he embraced years ago. This is fine. He doesn’t need to rationalise anything away with labels like “victim” and “survivor” or “brave” and “weak” if whatever’s lurking beyond the surface doesn’t need to be addressed in the first place.
“Draco and I...well, we’re currently on the outs, unfortunately.”
Draco shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the painful thoughts, trying and failing to push the memories down. He pulls his legs to his chest and buries his face in his knees and takes several deep, measured breaths.
of all people? How could you bring some superstar to an event as your date while wearing fucking polyester and say you like me at the same time? How do you think that’s somehow okay?” Draco asks hysterically.
“I thought I told you to leave me alone,” Draco hisses.
, I didn’t mean…I just meant because Edward is so
Draco’s eyes flutter shut as he hums approvingly. “I’ll think about it—now shut up and kiss me,” he haughtily demands before yanking Harry in for a fierce, wet kiss, fingers sinking into and tightly gripping the overlong strands of Harry’s hair.
Potter shakes his head, now standing beside Granger, eyes wide as he stares down at her. He crosses his arms against his chest. “I can’t register the person sitting in front of me as the same person I’ve known for over half my life. Hermione would not be at work right now. She’d be busying herself in doing everything she can to either expose foul play or prepare for my funeral if she thought I died naturally. This cold indifference isn’t like her at all.”
“Enough!” barks Ahmed Shafiq. He stands, his face apoplectic as he glares down at Draco. “I refuse to sit here and listen to this nonsense! Do you know what you’ve done to my family? The pain you’ve caused my
“You bloody
it, Draco lets go, blushing. “It seems like you don’t need me any further—” Draco says, making to stand, but Potter tugs him back down and entwines their fingers. “
He’s been sitting in the soft office armchair since coming home, patiently waiting for Harry to appear through the Floo. He glances down at his watch. It’s 2am.
“Um,” Hermione starts, an exaggerated bewildered look on her face.
“I love you,” he hears Malfoy’s boyfriend say.
something from him.
,” Theo says, shaking him slightly. “You’re being a shit friend by blowing me off –”
“I love you too,” Draco says, resting his forehead against Harry's, eyes fluttering shut. “Together?”
…she’ll tell all the fucking neighbours how fucking rough my delicious husband gives it to me!”
He wakes with a gasp, his throat raw, eyes flying open as his heart thunders painfully in his chest. He takes several slow, measured breaths. His ears still ring with the desperate, agonised pleas for mercy from his mother’s lips to a deaf God’s ears.
“You never mentioned where you went after the Pink and Oceanic Party,” Pansy continues, changing the conversation. She sniffles once more before sipping from her glass of wine. “It was a smashing success, by the way. The debutantes will be talking about it for years to come.”
Potter laughs, his expression fond. “It’s okay, not everyone has it. And I should’ve asked, I’m sorry. I mean...are you?”
Ginny was positively ecstatic and the media was quick to blame an errant Quidditch fan of Ginny’s. Harry had dismissed Hermione as the culprit because,
not knowing what it’ll do to him, to
“I love that house. I say, when did the Flint’s become so sophisticated? They’re absolutely horrid people, but have you seen their new conservatory? Gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous,” Draco rambles, now entwining his fingers together to crack them.
“—do it in the courtrooms!”
“No, Harry. Don’t turn this around on me…I’m over it, and I’m so tired. I’m tired of going around in circles with you, of fighting with you, of bloody crying over you,” Draco says, stepping away. He stumbles a bit, his stomach lurching as the flutters go still once again. Draco feels too warm, the alcohol threatening his angry, jumbled thoughts to spill out through tears. He doesn’t want to cry in front of Harry. He’s so
Standing together like this, peaceful and content, they look like the perfect couple, but Draco has been privy to the darkness lurking beyond that exterior.
The right corner of Draco’s mouth ticks upwards slightly, the closest thing to a sign of approval from him in the labs. “Exactly. Seal the samples in suspension using a glass bottle so they only start reacting again with their surroundings when the bottle is opened. Eventually...we will be able to dose sublingually and avoid first pass metabolism to similarly preserve potency.”
“Why’d you go into law?” Potter asks.
. So, is—is that alright?”
His comment goes unheard by the couple. Bitty wrenches herself free from Blaise’s grasp.
around himself just in case, but he doesn’t want Harry to transform alone. He will never let Harry go through that alone again.
“Yeah, okay.”
“This just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do
“Draco! Mate, you look a sight for sore eyes,” Theo says, jovial, wrapping an arm around Millie’s shoulders. “What’s wrong with him?” he asks Pansy.
Potter starts, his mouth hanging open in shock. It closes, and a suspicious look creeps across his face as he stares at Draco. Potter then smiles at him, and Draco quickly pushes aside the strange feeling that twinges in the pit of his stomach.
Harry runs a hand through his wild locks. “I don’t know? I didn’t want to upset you.”
Draco bites his lip. He knows that Gedeon is playing with every possible fear and insecurity Harry has. He’s always been good at manipulating people, convincing them that they were either invincible or the most horrendous piece of rubbish on the planet. His heart breaks as he sees the fear and confusion flash across Harry’s face.
, because I thought that I’d be an exception to your toxic habits,” Draco says in a strained voice.
when he was a kid. Draco had stood beside him the day the Ministry removed over a hundred Dark items from his Surrey estate that first year after the war. With Theo’s father dead and Theo lacking direct connections to the war, their estate was instead heavily fined and investigated by the Ministry. This meant no Azkaban for the only remaining Nott.

so he could shield Draco from his own fears.
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
Harry leans back in his chair to give Draco an incredulous look. “I can’t imagine she’d be, Draco. You’re insanely successful. Your mum will come around.”
Draco closes his eyes, his jaw clenching. He knew after that first Hex went flying that his and Harry’s secrets would be out in the open. If he could spare Harry the pain and humiliation of having the world know of Smith’s abuse and betrayal of him, he would. When he opens his eyes, he blinks several times, drawing in a slow breath to calm his nerves. “Do you think Harry will, ah, go—too?”
, which he then proceeded to niggle Draco into reading out loud.
“Tough shit, Potter. In this case, it’s not up to you. I’m the one that was impacted by it. I’m going to be the one to tell you if you deserve forgiveness or not in this situation. And I forgive you. You can’t take that away from me.”
Pansy suddenly looks thoughtful. “Why does all of this sound so familiar
Draco shakes his head, his arms folding against his chest. “What? So you regularly become this wonderful, amazing person for people you’re in relationships with before you turn on them?”
“All this time you’ve been trying to protect your pathetic friends. Well, I have them now. And more importantly, I have
They all shift around on the benches, glasses clinking, sex toys rolling.
were you thinking
A sting of impatience shoots through Draco. “Miss what?”
“Yes. Yes, so
Under Harry’s hands, Draco comes alive.
They're both silent for a long time after that. The highway is a long, straight line cutting across the land, never breaking, never winding nor looping, and Harry watches the shadows lengthen as the afternoon fades into dusk.
Harry’s luck has run out.
“Perhaps they cast it against a Dementor?”
Another long silence. Then, “I don’t know. I just left for three months. I decided to come back after that, to fix some mistakes, but...something happened.”
But Draco could not or would not hear him.
"I don't know."
"Mr Malfoy signed out at eleven o'clock this morning. May I help you with anything else?"
He feels as though he’s outstaying his welcome at Ron and Hermione’s home, although he’d never dare tell them that. He can only imagine the wrath and indignation it would invoke. He’s been there since Christmas and it’s March now.
don’t have to buy people’s affections.”
"Stop looking at me like that," Harry says, feeling slightly peeved. "I'm not one of your cases, to be put under a magnifying charm and analysed." Ron's gotten rather cunning during his Auror training — surprisingly good at picking up details that may have escaped him in his younger years — but Harry just wishes Ron didn't apply his newfound skills to friends and family as well.
“Harry, why don’t you get the door?”
And for a few brief hours, Harry doesn't think about work.
Draco studies him for a long moment. "You know," he says at last, "when I first realised you — of all people — were managing this case, I was angry." He pauses and glances out the window again, staring at his reflection. "My last chance, and it was wasted on you."
Later in the evening Draco, lying across one of the beds, reads a well-thumbed book entitled
The car rolls forward, finally leaving its prison of the past three years, finally doing what it was built to do: move. There's the quiet crunch of gravel beneath the tyres. He turns slowly along the wide path until it sweeps around the manor and joins the wide driveway.
In the afternoon, they’ll visit Narcissa, who will be perfectly cordial to Harry and greet him with a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, and it might be easy to mistake her cool composure for a hidden chilliness. But Harry knows better, and later on Draco will most certainly notice that Narcissa’s gift to Harry is slightly more expensive than her one to Draco, and will accuse her of blatant favouritism, and Narcissa will laugh and say nothing. Later on, in the evening, they’ll go to the drawing room, and Narcissa will drag out all the childhood photographs of Draco, much to Harry’s delight and Draco’s dismay.
Draco sits in the driver's seat, looking straight ahead as if there's an open road in front of them instead of a concrete wall. His hands rest on the steering wheel. He doesn't speak, and Harry lets the silence envelope them. It feels terribly strange — somehow disorientating — to sit on the passenger's side, after so many months being the sole driver.
"Rite of passage. Everyone's first licence looks awful. At least you can legally drive now," he adds. Harry's graduated from the driveway to actual roads, as the country lanes surrounding Astoria's home are generally bereft of traffic.
* * *
Draco doesn't seem to know how to respond to that, but Harry catches the faint flush in his face.
doesn’t know about the Chudley Cannons,” Harry protests. “That’s the
And this time they don't let go.
He's always shied away from the media, and he's notoriously difficult to pin to paper. Hermione and Ron will cover for him, but his work colleagues will no doubt notice his unexplained absence and whisper among themselves. And soon, the whispering will reach the ever-alert antennae of Rita Skeeter.
"They look amazing." Harry's undeterred by Draco's dismissive tone, but Draco suddenly slows the car and pulls over to the side of the road. "What?" Harry asks, forgetting the fields for a moment and wondering if Draco's angry about something. But Draco just gestures to the fields.
So he does. Deep in the golden light of autumn, he goes to the manor. A house-elf answers his hesitant knock, peering at Harry with its large eyes before bowing and ushering him into the reception hall.
At any moment, he thinks, Draco will notice him. But Draco's attention seems elsewhere, and Harry stands in the hallway for a long moment, watching Draco hunt through the mirror cabinet for floss. It's strange to watch him so unguarded. Many people, Harry has learned, have little tells and habits that give away their emotions or thoughts. Ron's ears reddening, for example, or Hermione chewing her lip. Narcissa playing with her jewellery, or Astoria tucking her hair behind her ears.
"Give me a second," Harry calls back, dressing quickly in yesterday's clothes. He half-hops into the kitchen, still putting socks on. Hermione's already rummaging through his cupboards, searching for teabags.
"Matt," Astoria says, "this is Harry Potter. He's trying to find Draco."
Everyone groans.
She smiles faintly. “Running on air.”
He recognised it immediately. His wand. Not the one in his hand now, that Ollivander had so grudgingly made him. No. His faithful wand that had been taken from him so many months ago.
Harry closes his hand around the ring, feeling the icy metal against his palm, and then reaches out to touch Draco’s chin, drawing him forward into a kiss.
"Found it from coordinates Draco carved into a beam in the owl emporium."
this? Who poured
"That's not too far away," Harry says, eyeing the overnight bag. Ginny pauses halfway through wrapping up her shinguards and looks apologetic.
Things fall apart.
After a moment, Draco says, “This is where you found the timeturner.”
"I didn't realise I'd been splinched. Not at first. I thought I was dead, a ghost, because nobody could see or hear me. I couldn't touch anything. But then I kept getting what I thought were visions — strange overlaps, where I'd see two scenes at once — and I realised I was seeing both past and present." Draco falls silent for a long time, staring out across the forests and valleys. "It started driving me insane. It was like two different people talking inside my head. So I left. I wanted to find a place where nothing changed." Draco gestures, his hand sweeping over the view. "This was the closest I got."
Draco opens his mouth but the cliffs are crumbling, falling away like sandcastles, and the terrifying darkness of the storm-wild waves reaches up to eclipse Harry.
His new supervisor — Head of the Investigative Division, Clara Holdsworth — had been far less diplomatic.
“Aurors like you,” she had said when they first met, “view your work as a game of Quidditch. As though you’re a seeker and people are simply snitches.”
The pensieve.
It's one thing he and Draco have in common: a lonely childhood. The only time Harry ever got close to playing games like tag was when he found himself running for his life as a jeering Dudley waddled after him, or Aunt Marge's bulldogs snapped at his heels. It's a very different experience to be racing through a field, the night sky clear and crisp above him, listening to the sound of light footsteps behind him. Draco's voice cuts across the field.
Harry opens the driver's side door and gets in. Now that he's driven a car, he reacts automatically, his hands instinctively reaching to rest on the steering wheel, his feet finding the brake and accelerator, his eyes flicking to the rearview mirror.
"You're going home."
." He shoves his hands in his pockets, studying Narcissa's reflection in the window. The stars are coming out now, cold and white against the dark January sky. "I remember that night, the night of the battle. I walked to my death but I wasn't alone. I remember the spirit of my mother walking alongside me." He turns around, leaning his back against the cold glass of the window. "Do you think Draco ever felt he walked alone?"
* * *
“I can hear you this time.”
Harry looked down at his own hands and placed them deep into his pockets.
Harry turns away quickly, making his way to the bedroom. When he returns, the keycard is in one hand. Draco looks at it, not moving.
Well...it worked once before.
"You're afraid." Ron points his butterbeer at Harry, then sets it upright again and untwists the cap. "Pathetic, really."
"Yeah, did you really think we'd go running off to tell everyone?" Ron adds. "All you had to do was ask us not to."
It's a mild summer's day. The domes and onion-shaped minarets of the Royal Pavilion open into the sky, shining white in the light of the noon sun, and gardens stretch away from the buildings in lush sprawls of verdant green.
"These fields," he repeats, slowly reaching out and brushing a hand over the tall canola flowers. Still green and young, they haven't yet reached the brightness of Cornwall's canola fields. Harry stares intensely across the field, his eyes narrowed with focus. As though, if he looks hard enough, he might see the ghost of a young Draco racing between the canola plants.
Draco looks exactly how Harry left him.
The second receipt is dated 05/09/2003, at 11:29pm, and shows that Draco purchased £20 worth of petrol again, in Truro, Cornwall. A fair distance from East Devon. What was Draco doing there, so late at night? Harry's eyes flick to the rear-vision mirror again, as if he'll find the answer hiding behind him.
He looks ahead. Astoria. She's sitting in the front passenger seat, eyes wide. Malfoy is driving. Harry never imagined Malfoy like this. He's dressed in his usual style — neat and formal clothes — but he's not wearing robes, nor a cloak. His hands are resting lightly on the steering wheel, warm sunlight slanting across his wrists.
"I'll ask Gwen."
"Malfoy," he says at last, and Draco looks at him. There's something in his gaze that is reminiscent of sixth year. A fragment of sadness hiding in the corner of his mouth; a trace of resignation in his eyes.
They pay for their items — or at least, Draco pays with his card. Harry feels a little uncomfortable about Draco paying for everything so far, but Draco doesn't seem to care and he hasn't made Harry feel like he owes him anything.
In keeping with these principles, Malfoy's case isn't visible. The file is locked in Harry's desk drawer; the pensieve is locked in the cabinet behind his desk.
It had been difficult to arrange everyone’s schedules to coordinate, but here they are. Astoria is pacing in the kitchen. She makes another pot of tea before Matthew gently reminds her that she’s already made one.
They came back.
“Thanks.”
Harry remembers that. Someone had activated the Salus charm. The spell, specially designed for the Aurors to respond to emergencies, was easy to cast. A simple spray of sparks into the air, and the caster's exact location appeared on the enormous map adhered to the wall of the main Auror office, setting off an alarm that would send all available Aurors rushing to the scene.
Draco has gone, or perhaps he was never there.
But the nondescript and empty patch of road slowly disappears in the rear-vision mirror as Harry drives away.
It's the same car that was in Astoria's memory, he thinks. The interior is pale grey, in comparison to the charcoal-coloured exterior, and is just as clean. At first, Harry suspects someone Scourgified the car, but then he spots a handful of Muggle coins and some receipts in the centre console compartment.
Harry walks along the south-west coastal track. Maybe he'll just keep walking and one day he'll find himself back here again. Making circles, making meaningless patterns.
“Learn,” said Harry, and smiled.
He should go home, he thinks. Buy a new apartment. Buy a hundred apartments, it doesn't matter. They all look the same. Go and return to his Auror job. Arrest Dark magic users. Greedy criminals, pureblood zealots, desperate teenagers, people needing quick money. It doesn't matter. They all look the same.
“At least
"Yes," Draco repeats firmly, and the woman nods, turning back to the computer. "She meant if we're paying together, Potter," Draco mutters to Harry.
Draco finally puts the teaspoon aside. “Get that look off your face.”
The ninth of September.
So he goes out onto the balcony, and watches the trains come and go, and listens to the noise of the city. If he removes his glasses and tilts his head slightly, he can imagine that the River Thames is the Hogwarts lake, shining in the dark light of dusk, and beyond it he can almost see the green Quidditch pitch, smell the freshly-cut grass...and if he looks over his shoulder, he'll see the towers of Hogwarts reaching into the azure sky...
"My contact details. Please keep me updated."
Nevertheless, when they begin the driving lesson, Matthew lets Harry try the main road and, as Harry hits a long stretch of straight road and needs no assistance, Matthew asks about Draco.
* * *
* * *
"Not much here," Harry says.
* * *
* * *
"That was subtle," Draco says after a long moment.
"Still, you were brilliant."
"What other times?"
The eighteenth of September.
“Between January and April.”
Harry slowly runs a hand over his desk. He could be solving a case right now, working on something important...
"Astoria Venn's house."
* * *
Harry nods, then changes the topic. "Those boxes at the manor...are they truly all of Draco's possessions?"
Well, that was completely useless. Harry surfaces from the memory with a sigh.
"Yeah, well," Ron says, glancing over at Hermione and lowering his voice, "friendship can do a lot of things, but it can't get you a shag."
Well, he's got one concrete bit of information. Caught in an unusually capricious mood, Harry smiles wryly and reaches for the file, drawing up a fresh page and writing
"Do you think," she says at last, "we could fix this?"
— Narcissa and Lucius are arguing again, that’s all they seem to do these days, but her voice is getting quieter and quieter because there’s too many people in the house now, Aunt Bellatrix who makes the prisoners scream, scream,
They drive on the next day, but not far — they stop somewhere between Poole and Exmouth, spending three days in the small parish of Salmouth-on-Sea. Harry doesn't mind. Sometimes they walk together along the beaches — so empty and windswept after Brighton's busy bustle — and other times Draco disappears by himself, to look at the shops or follow the coastal walks or visit the old lighthouse.
He could always find him in the Great Hall. At the Ravenclaw table, Draco guessed, but no. Harry was at the Gryffindor table. He had been there for three days now. Draco wondered if he would stay there now, always. But that had been Before the war, and everything was different now. Time always seemed to be marked by that now. It was either Before or After.
* * *
There's little asides dotted throughout the pages.
"He's not," Harry says slowly. "If you had the power to create a hallucination...anything you wanted...why would you choose to have an ordinary conversation with someone? Maybe this is a last resort, his last way of communicating." He thinks of the way Draco vanished at the end of the conversation. That wasn't part of the vision, he's sure of it. Draco broke an apparent rule when he tried to tell Harry his whereabouts, and suffered the consequences accordingly.
He lets himself have a good twenty-minutes of reprieve before he straightens up, then stands and heads towards the dining table. He'll need to do some serious analysis of his meeting with Draco's solicitor.
Their reactions tell him everything he needs to know. Astoria blinks, looking completely bewildered. Narcissa begins to shake her head, and then a flash of realisation and then fear crosses her face.
Harry disappears into the bathroom, planning to take a long and relaxing shower.
“But he was the greatest — ”
He turned round slowly.
On the last day of summer, when the sapphire-coloured sky has given way to a pale blue and the blazing sunlight has gentled, Holdsworth tells Harry there's a vacancy in the Investigative Division.
Harry drives a lot more these days. He drives along the coastlines of the country, he drives past the gritty skylines of cities and through the rolling hills of the countryside. He just drives.
Astoria nods. The conversation lulls; she traces the pattern on the mug, one fingernail skimming over the printed flowers and leaves. Harry looks at her.
"So was the first detective, three years ago, and he spoke my son's name as if it was mud in his mouth. He told me Draco had probably run away to live a life of luxury abroad."
* * *
Over which they'll discuss exactly how a portkey works, of course.
. And yet he'd nearly convinced himself...
Harry laughs. "You went to Cadbury World? Here I was, thinking you did very serious and soul-searching road trips all over Britain."
He does. Often. The next day — the first of September — he asks Ron if he likes working as an Auror. They're sitting at the bar at the Mad Alchemist, and Ron's nursing his fourth butterbeer and looking thoughtful as Harry asks the question. Harry, expecting an automatic and enthusiastic 'yes, I love my job' is surprised when Ron answers.
"Do you enjoy being an Auror?"
Draco looks startled. "What?"
Harry opens the atlas at a random page. "We're going to Sutton-on-Sea." He flips back to the pages of outer London, trying to figure out the best route, focusing on the task of navigation.
* * *
When he turns back to Narcissa, she's holding out the vial, silver wisps moving within.
Harry drives on, one hand resting on the steering wheel, the other still held by Draco.
Harry is suddenly yanked sharply forwards, like an invisible hand has grabbed his collar, and he recognises this place.
A wedding ring, Harry realises. As he steps closer, he realises she's crying. Did she have a fight with Malfoy? He waits restlessly for Malfoy to step through the door and say something acerbic.
“Draco had a time-turner?” Astoria demands, her expression accusing. “You — “
Harry is silent for a long time. He glances at the playground, staring at the empty swings, the worn tracks from where people made shortcuts across the grass. Desire paths, he thinks they’re called. When people create their own paths as opposed to using the set footpaths.
Harry closes his eyes and leans over the railing of the balcony slightly, just to remind himself what it feels like to fly.
“Fourth-worst. You’re forgetting Mulgrave.”
"You don't believe me."
Harry can't go to the match. He apologises profusely to Ginny, saying he has to interview relatives about a recent case. Ginny's disappointed but says she understands.
Sometimes the Healers tried to light the room, if Harry was visiting at night. But Harry liked sitting in the dark, in the night. Sometimes he casted a glamour spell, darkening the room completely, giving it tiny pinpricks of starry light, so it felt like they were floating through the galleries of space and time together. Draco liked that. He liked the darkness. When the Healers tried lighting candles, he would snuff them out one by one with calloused fingertips.
"You wouldn't believe the stunt Creechurch pulled this morning!"
"Yes?" Narcissa tilts her head expectantly. "Tell me, I'll be sure to tell the framer."
. "The debriefing should only take an hour or so."
He's hoping Draco will be standing by the apartment door. But he knows it won't happen. And as long as he's not there yet, still standing in his office, he doesn't know. Draco might be there, or he might not. Schrödinger's Draco, Harry thinks with a very wry smile.
“See you all on Christmas Day, then?” Ron asks, settling his cloak around his shoulders. “Fair warning, Mum’s gone overboard this year and made matching scarves and hats for everyone.”
"For taking me to Snowdonia, of course."
that!" Astoria says as Malfoy takes the wheel again. "Merlin, how do the Muggles do this? It's — watch out for that car!"
"Let's not talk about work tonight," Harry says suddenly, interrupting Ginny's description of Saturday's match. "Let's talk about other things."
"The day the war ended," Draco says at last, "I promised myself I would never take orders from anyone again."
Draco straightens up, eyes suddenly bright with interest. "Brecon Beacons, you'd really like that. It's in South Wales. The stars are always perfectly clear — it's a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. Or if you prefer mountains, we'd go to Cairngorms, where the mountains have been sculpted by ice-age glaciers. Or if you prefer rivers and waterfalls, there's the Peak District. Of course, if you want rugged cliffs and sea arches, there's Pembrokeshire Coast." Draco pauses to give Harry a calculative look. "But I think you like the stars."
* * *
The door was open.
The room remains empty, and when Harry goes to sleep, he dreams of wild waves and crumbling cliffs.
, Harry adds silently. Hermione's too tactful to say the words herself.
Draco woke up, his hand outstretched to catch a heart that did not exist.
“What’s better with me?”
"Oh, that's nice," Ron says, looking relieved. "Bit of a holiday, then?"
“No,” Harry said. “You couldn’t be dark.” He drew his wand across the graffiti as though rubbing it out and sure enough the words slowly evaporated. “Maybe you were meant to be light.”
On Thursday, he visits Narcissa Malfoy. She receives Harry with an air of faint bewilderment.
But his body kept rising into the air, and then it jerked and twisted like a puppet on star-tangled strings, and the mob had their wands out, oh Merlin, Harry saw them now, their angry faces and sharp eyes and ugly mouths twisting and spitting out the word 'justice'. Muggleborns, come to kill the last and youngest Death Eater.
"I've driven to Glasgow." Draco's eyes never leave the road.
ingests insects. The average chocolate bar has eight insect legs in it."
Draco touches Harry, drawing him from his reverie, and curls his fingers over Harry’s hand.
"Are you happy?" he asks her. She's silent for a long time.
"I'll never get parallel parking right," Harry mutters. Sometimes he's been tempted to use space-squeezing charms, but so far he's resisted the urge.
. Harry wonders if that's an invitation to speak about the last three years, about Draco being trapped in the past, about everything that happened.
* * *
“I am in need of an owl. Speed is less important than accuracy.”
"You're quicker than you look," he tells Draco.
Harry wakes, feeling unnerved. Now he even dreams about the memory, it seems. He reaches for the glass of water usually kept on his bedside table.
Harry opens the door to the underground parking. It's a bright and sunny afternoon, the weather delightfully mild, and most of the residents have already left, off to enjoy a lazy Saturday with family or friends. The car park is nearly empty.
, he thinks vaguely. But he's looked at this scene so many times...
Harry had given up.
"See? No problems," Ron begins cheerfully, but Hermione levels him with a look.
“You’re angry,” Draco says, and Harry tries to laugh, but the sound comes out as little more than a choked cry.
“I heard you.”
"There might be a high price."
That’s what he felt like sometimes. No fireworks or burst of light. No ceremony, no dramatics, no explosions or screams or warnings.
"Astoria."
The confusion and sleepiness stole away from Hermione's face. An odd and unreadable expression flickered, then settled. “Harry?” she asked tiredly. Draco gave her a startled look.
He was supposed to clear it out, but he'd forgotten. Or maybe he'd just avoided thinking about it. The door unlocks at a tap of his wand, like it always does. Security flaw, he thinks automatically — they should have removed his wand signature from the office as soon as he left. But that's thinking like an Auror — constant vigilance. Harry has to smile wryly. Nobody wants to break into the Missing Persons offices. Nothing exciting there — no international crime organisations or terrorist information. Just family photographs of smiling faces, long-lost people. Ordinary people, missed and loved only by their friends and family. Considered unimportant by everyone else.
To finish their education, some said. To see everyone and everything for one last year, others said. To see if everyone was alright, still more claimed. Some came back because they were nosy. Some came back in the hope that they would just pick up their old lives again.
"I have a meeting with Narcissa," Harry says pleasantly, tapping the Renault's keycard against his palm.
* * *
He closes the file slowly, Draco disappearing beneath the pages.
“Yes, because other people say it for us.”
One more.
* * *
The wand moved gently, rolling across the table and falling into his outstretched hand.
"Come for a drive?" Draco says, as if it's a casual invitation, as if he turns up and asks this question all the time. Like it's a routine between them.
Well, of course this is how it will end. This was borrowed time, this trip. A journey stolen, moments that weren't supposed to happen, memories that were never supposed to be given. And now Draco will go back to the manor, to his fussing mother and doting house-elves, and Harry will go back to his blank white apartment and stand on the balcony and drink scotch, and maybe if he listens closely enough he might hear someone whistling blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly...
Butterworth frowns. "I'll need to access the remains." He pauses. "Cremated or buried by now, most likely. We'll have to do it the Muggle way. Go and arrange the Muggle Liaison office to fetch the DNA sample." He waves a hand irritably. "Contact me when you have it."
And he feels nothing inside, like the war has cut away everything that used to make him human and and left nothing but a paper cut-out.
“One o’clock this afternoon.”
“I know.” The anger was gone. The Shadow took away any passion.
“Ron,” Hermione said reprovingly.
"Sorry, I have to find something," Harry says, and the shopkeeper blinks at him.
Matthew brightens. “What’s a Niffler? Sounds interesting. Astoria, you
Harry never held much with speaking to the unconscious or the dead. His final experience with death — when he held the Resurrection Stone — taught him the finality of death. Speaking to someone who clearly isn't there is pointless.
It's the first time he's stepped into his office since Draco came back. It's strange how everything's exactly how he left it five days ago, last Thursday. Draco's file is still in his drawer. The pensieve, filled with memories, sits undisturbed in its cabinet. Harry takes off his cloak and hang it on a peg before sitting behind his desk. The owls flutter around him, eventually settling into a neat line. One particular owl — a large hawk owl — pecks the other owls until they've shuffled aside.
Harry hesitates, busying himself clearing a spot at the table and sitting down before he speaks. "Do you think...do you think Draco chose to leave?"
He leans across to the glovebox and opens it. There's the ownership papers inside: Draco purchased the car from a dealership in Essex, on the thirty-first of July 2002. Harry smiles slightly at the date and puts the papers aside. There's also a large book that Harry has to work hard to free from the glovebox.
"You promised we'd go to Dover," he says quietly.
The headlights cut through the dark night, the road lined with ancient Welsh oaks, their branches arching over the sky.
light! I watched people die! I watch them get tortured, and I did
"And then?"
Narcissa nods. "I assume he sold his broom. Both Astoria and myself removed all his possessions when I was granted the rights to sell his house. We collected every item."
Harry stands up abruptly. Is this another side-effect? Or just a cold? Merlin, why did he agree to that stupid trip to Sutton-on-Sea? It's clearly been too much for Draco, why didn't Harry behave like a responsible adult for once and drag Draco to the Healers as soon as he returned, like any normal person would do —
"Yes. I received a letter from her."
“What?” Ron moved; his elbow caught on the goblet and sent it tumbling. “Thanks a lot, Hermione!”
"How about Dover?" Harry says. "I've always wanted to see those famous white cliffs."
It's like a circle.
Silence. That's fine. Draco always liked silence. Space to think, space to breathe.
And he could breathe again, sharp, strange air, as though they had been taking up too much space, making him small and choking. Yes. He could move now.
Harry steps inside, giving the cloudless blue sky another look before snapping the sliding door shut. He trails one hand along the counter, feeling all the empty places where people should be. Silence where there should be a voice, sometimes soft and serious, sometimes light and teasing.
"You're seriously still sulking over that?" Draco demands. "Unbelievable, Potter. Yes, I was slightly annoyed at the time, but I was well over it by the time we checked out. Unlike you, I don't hold grudges."
* * *
"I'm sorry, I know you always wanted — "
The headlights dip for a moment before illuminating the endless stretch of asphalt again.
"Yes, I do. Tea?"
And he can recognise the cyclical irony of the situation.
Draco isn't there.
"Do you?" Harry asks vaguely, still a little distracted.
Astoria pours Harry a cup of tea and sets it down on the kitchen table. He takes the cue and sits down on a chair, first removing a toy model of the Hogwarts Express and several plush toy owls.
It frightens Harry for a moment, that Draco Malfoy knows him better than most of his friends, better than his colleagues, better than Ginny. Then he remembers —
"Okay," Ron says, in tones that imply Harry's started ranting about Wrackspurts and Gnargles. "You do that."
His Auror work
* * *
"You've been sulking since we left Truro," Draco says tersely. Harry turns to stare at him.
Some people like to talk about the war, some people don't. Harry doesn't. Ron doesn't either, but Hermione does. Ginny tried to speak about it with Harry, but gave up after her initial attempts were met with silence. It had been a point of contention between them for a while:
A faint scratching noise comes from the living area. Harry leaves the bedroom and hurries over to the glass sliding door leading to the balcony; an owl is scratching at the glass, looking displeased.
"Doesn't matter. Mum's got visions of weddings and grandchildren." Ron takes a swig of his firewhiskey. "I know a bloke up Norfolk way, does fake passports quite cheap. I'll give you his details."
Harry looks down at Draco’s hand. A little portkey, in the shape of a Christmas bauble, rests on his palm.
“Three years,” she says. “Three years. Merlin, I just want it to be over. You never really stop searching...”
“Ron’s beating me,” Harry said and Ron smiled happily, a most annoying I-told-you-so look on his face.
In the rear-vision mirror, he can see Narcissa watching him. How many times did she watch her son drive away, disappearing into the distance? He applies just a little more acceleration. The car quickens its pace down the long driveway and then, finally, he slows slightly to turn onto the open road. It's a thin and winding country road. The same type of road on which Harry spent so many hours practising his own driving.
got one?"
Draco makes an angry noise. “I’m going to file for divorce.”
"Yeah, and when we weren't making radical changes, we were chasing the last of the Death Eaters." Ron shakes his head. "Those field assignments...you don't get 'em like that anymore. Days spent staking out places, tracking down Dark Arts masterminds...of course, it's great it's not like that anymore," Ron adds quickly, a half-hearted disclaimer.
"Come in."
Astoria frowns, looking confused. "No. Why, is it important? He took an anti-pain potion sometimes, when he had a headache, but that's all."
"Are you
"I know."
“I’d like to wait for Narcissa,” he says, and Astoria bites her lip hard and looks away.
“For Merlin’s sake!”
He glances at Draco. He’s staring into the sky too, and after a moment, he seems to sense Harry’s gaze, for he looks at him and says, “Just remembering.”
draco was seriously regretting his life decisions.
soon, ginny and luna got into a heated makeout session and forgot all about draco(he was thankful for this but knowing them they'd soon resume pestering draco so he decided to drink somewhere else).
Suddenly, ginny hugged the guy and was shouting in his ear "harry!! I did not expect to see you here!". Harry laughed and was saying something but draco wasn't listening. 'Is he allowed to be this good looking' was all draco could think while blatantly staring at his face. It was ginny shouting ''oh my god! is that ron on the dance floor? I gotta record that'' that pulled him out of his trance. He was sure he looked like a ripe tomato with the way he was blushing with luna smirking like that. She was upto something evil draco was sure of that. Harry was still grinning when he turned back towards draco and luna and shook luna's hand. "So" harry said grinning " you think of me as cute?". Draco so wanted to run away but luna knew him too well and draco regretted ever befriending her as she had a strong hold on his arm and was squeezing it when she felt draco about to run."y-yeah" draco stuttered and he seriously wanted someonr to shout fire or anything just so he could run away from there. This night was turning out to be much more than he expected.
harry had been dragged to the bar by remus and sirius, not that he didn't like bars and dancing he did, just nowadays he wasn't in a mood to go anywhere.
"good morning sunshine"
harry smirked and draco blushed making harry coo at his face.
when the boy shifted, harry decided to go talk to him and had to use every bit of his self control to not blush and giggle like a schoolgirl when they made eye contact. he smirked and decided to test his luck by grinding on the guy behind him, the poor guy got flustered and looked away. harry found it cute and encouraged by remus n sirius( who were watching the whole thing) he decided to go talk to the cute guy.
luna scting as the cupid.
"oh, you noticed that?" draco said as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly and his face blushed red.
They pulled back when they were out of breath and draco smiled and said "ron was right, but you are my oblivious walnut now." before kissing harry senseless again.
"huh? Right about what?"
" well, you did vanish after your and harry's makeout."
while dancing he saw a boy with platinum hair drinking and getting teased by two girls, he was rolling his eyes at them and harry found himself chuckling at the boy's expression.
draco bent down to kiss harry and thought maybe he could give harry a chance and not run away this time.
"what?why? i thought you were gonna stay and we were gonna cuddle and then make breakfast and maybe watch something together mr. i become a flustered mess whenever i'm near you?" harry teased.
" you mean that traitor ron was right all this time?!" was what Harry sputtered out and mentally face palmed.
