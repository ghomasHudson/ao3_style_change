”What about you, Harry?” Hermione asked, leaning towards him. ”I think a simple daily routine would do us both some good. We wouldn’t start right away, of course. The school will need to be fixed first. I assume the new semester would start in September again, wouldn’t it?”
“No,” Uncle Tony said immediately. “In fact, today you needn’t bother with Crabbe either. Have you had breakfast yet? I assume not. Let’s go.”
Healer Crabbe didn’t say anything to that, and Harry sighed, trying to think harder about how he was feeling. It was just… so
Malfoy looked at him again, his expression making Harry’s heart ache for some reason. Briefly, Harry wondered what kind of a friend Malfoy would have been at Hogwarts, before he decided to not dwell on things he couldn’t change. The silence stretched for a few moments longer, before Malfoy scowled, and turned away.
“We’ll be going to a city called Ghadames,” Antonin said, surprisingly pulling him to a stop before they reached the fireplace. “It is an old,
“It’ll be fine,” Lily cooed, eyes fixed on James again, clearly fading out of the conversation already. “People won’t focus on Harry. They will have the Boy-Who-Lived there. People will focus on that boy, not our Harry.”
“Ghadames,” Antonin replied, steering him towards the front door, wondering if he ought to insist on seeing the boy’s mother, before ultimately deciding not to. “Did you bring your list?”
impression. He didn’t mind Ellis Nott, and felt pleased when the man approved of anything he did. He wasn’t sure if that counted as liking him, however. “When will we start?”
“I wouldn’t wish to disrupt your routine with James,” Uncle Tony said. “Harry will soon turn ten, won’t he? In a few weeks. How about you let him live with me for a little while? You two could—”
”I did, yes,” Harry said. ”It needs a bit of fixing, which Malfoy offered to do. Said it’s his responsibility to have the house properly renovated before selling it to me.”
“Yes,” Uncle Tony said, nodding. “Today the use of any of those three will lead to a life sentence in Azkaban. Do you know what they do?”
”That sounds nice,” Hermione said approvingly. ”Aside from the parts that need fixing, what is it like?”
If you enter Libya, and cross countless of miles into the desert to the west, right before you reach the Algerian border, you’ll find Ghadames, the oldest habitable city in the entirety of Sahara. At first, it’ll seem like a ghost city with its empty streets, but you’d notice by how clean and well-kept everything is that there are people living there. I went there briefly in early 2011 as part of a longer trip to Libya then, and to this day I’m hard pressed to think of a place more beautiful (IDK how it is now tho, since so much has changed). That’s why I wanted to include it here. It’s a place that deserves to be mentioned and appreciated. Also the Kufi signs are real btw, or at least were in early 2011.
”No, that’s not what I meant,” Harry hurried to reply. ”But that you’d know of your family from many generations before you - that’s brilliant.”
So happy he knew that if he knew how, he would have been able to cast any spell, including the Killing Curse. Maybe soon he’d get to do that, if he could convince Bellatrix to teach him.
“Well then,” Healer Crabbe said, stepping out of the fireplace behind him. “This is the waiting room. Follow me, I’ll take you to my office instead.”
This turned out for the best, as soon after the sound of her loud footsteps disappeared, Harry felt... strange. Anxious, though that was to be expected, given the circumstances. He didn't dare to peek from under the bed, but did his best to hear every little sound around him. It didn't take long for him to realize that after having run away so loudly, Lily had then returned - quietly, so quietly - back to stand in the corridor outside Harry's room. She didn't come in this time, and Harry was sure that she was waiting for him to come out.
“The Dark Lord will be pleased,” Lestrange said suddenly, reaching to pet Harry’s hair. “A necromancer! You’ve outdone yourself this time, Dolohov.”
“What about the deactivation word?” Harry asked, deciding to look up what in the world the Imperius curse was – he had never heard of it before, and it sounded terrible already.
And frankly, even if he wasn't-- none of this was Harry's business anyway. He had enough things to worry about without getting involved in things that were clearly complicated. Harry was just going to keep his head down and stay out of the way. That he was absolutely certain of.
Harry mustered up a smile. He didn’t believe in lifelong anything - his parents hadn’t kept any of the friends they’d met at Hogwarts - but nodded regardless. Crabbe wasn’t a fool, but he just… he didn’t know how things went in Harry’s life. And without that, most of his advice was left aside, discarded as useless. Because despite how long they’d been doing this, Harry still wasn’t convinced that he needed a therapist.
“Family can be… difficult,” Hermione responded, sounding hesitant and upset. “You know my… I mean, Hogwarts is about to start again, and I just… I was supposed to already be on my way to Australia. No, actually, I was supposed to have been there and back by now, really. But I haven’t even left yet, and I keep pushing it, because… I’m scared of what comes after. What if their life now is better than what it used to be here, with me? You went back to the Dursleys and got disappointed. I’m scared of going back to my own parents at all, because I don’t want to get disappointed as well.”
"Is this going to be taught at Hogwarts?" Harry asked then. It seemed like such simple but useful logic, and it was hard to tell if it was something everyone was going to know or if it was something he could just... keep close to his heart and use to his advantage should he ever need to.
What else? He could say he was a necromancer, but everyone seemed to care about it so much more than he did. He could also say he was a Potter, but not only did Crabbe already know that, but Harry didn’t
“I know,” Ellis muttered. “But, as you said, that was the first round. The Dark Lord’s return is a matter of time - our Dark Marks are still visible. Every single Death Eater should know that his absence is temporary, and yet— so many have extracted themselves from the good company.”
"But with no wand," Bellatrix then said, "we have to improvise." She then let go of him, and with a few steps came to stand right by the picture that, from what Harry could see now, was even taller than her. The man depicted had dark hair and grey eyes, and looked vaguely familiar, somehow.
“Hmm?” Nott looked at him, though he still maintained his leaning position over the body. “What is it?”
”This apartment is in the heart of London,” Nettlewick said. ”The entire complex is occupied by famous celebrities, it’s in a fantastic area, and close to the best clubs in the city.”
“We can go to another room if it doesn’t make you feel comfortable,” Crabbe said. “The lounge or the kitchen, perhaps?”
is without reason. The Dark Lord - and I hate to sound like Bellatrix - was exceptionally educated when it came to these issues.”
”Yes, I agree,” Hermione replied, taking a deep breath. ”And I need to go and look for my parents. Not right now, but... soon.”
to remain, either out of attachment to a place or something else. And that choice turns them into creatures— and
“Merlin,” Uncle Tony hissed. “Between you and Ellis— fine, yes. He hasn’t yet, but I’ll look into it. Looks healthy to me, though, so I won’t be in a rush to arrange that.”
“Not entirely, though that did play a part in it,” he replied. “The Dark Lord envisioned the world in a way I could resonate with.”
that the rows weren’t empty. The walls themselves were listening to him, and he didn’t want to know what this place would do to him if he was left alone.
“So it’s less about death itself, and more about the things you will lose if you die?” Harry asked, frowning.
Uncle Tony looked pleased when he replied: “The unavoidable nature of an instant death is frightening to people, though I’m sure you’ll be told all about how
And, Harry promised himself, once he went to Hogwarts and got his wand, the first spell he was ever going to learn would be the Killing Curse.
“I was hiding,” Harry replied. “She didn’t find me - didn’t look for me. But she came to stand by my bed for ages and then hid to wait by the door. I don’t— I don’t know what’s going on.”
“Of course,” the woman nodded, smiling warmly at Harry. She then reached for a drawer, and after a moment picked up a strangely short wand that she then handed to the boy. “We use this for
“Then the third one, which is the one that will matter the most to you,” Uncle Tony continued. “The Killing Curse. It causes instantaneous and painless death, without causing its victims any injury, and leaves no traces of violence.”
“I’m not going to become an Auror,” Harry replied. “And it’s not like I’ve never done anything questionable either, you know that.” Why did people think that he was somehow an overly forgiving person? Harry knew he wasn’t - there were so many people he just couldn’t bring himself to forgive. He could never even consider forgiving Vernon and Petunia. Or Snape, despite the man having died while fighting against Voldemort to the very end. Or Dumbledore, even, for quite a few things.
”Re-taking the seventh year?” Hermione said, a smile appearing on her face. The three of them were sitting on the couch, and McGonagall had moved a chair in order to sit across of them. A small table that hadn’t been there before was now between them, with steaming cups of tea and a plateful of biscuits on it. ”That would be wonderful!”
“When the Dark Lord walked among us,” the woman said, “he commanded magic unlike anything you could imagine. He could raise an army of inferi with a single thought, and yield powers that surpassed death itself.”
“What it means,” Healer Crabbe said, and luckily he didn’t seem to be upset by Harry’s question, “is that the discussions you and I will have, are discussions with an objective. While your godfather made it appear as if you’ll be simply sharing your secrets into a void that then just swallows them and leaves them to crumble into dust, that is not at all what this is about. As you’re growing up - and already now - the things you’re capable of and the way you have been raised so far have contributed to isolating you. And when you’re thrust into various social situations - especially those that involved a large group of people - you might end up feeling confused, overwhelmed, and anxious.”
He did know of this Dark Lord that Lestrange kept bringing up. Voldemort. Harry was familiar with the story of how the First Wizarding War had ended, and how terrifying Voldemort had been. He hadn’t known that there were still people supporting that wizard, but clearly there were.
Now all Harry could do was cover his ears and pretend he didn’t notice his mother – hair a mess, gowns stained, eyes vacant – wandering around with the rotting remains of his father – barely capable of shuffling after her anymore, pieces of his flesh dropping with every bump and jolt. The stench that kept Harry well-warned of their approach never bothered his mother, and all Harry could feel when he watched the two of them from a distance was regret.
“Necromancers, as you know, are incredibly rare throughout history,” Uncle Tony continued. “There are none alive today who could teach you the secrets that you will have to discover on your own. However, the two people I will introduce you to today have researched the subject in question extensively, and have thus acquired a vast theoretical knowledge of it.”
”Well, there will be no neighbours here,” Malfoy said. ”Once the fireplace has been connected, you can name the place. In two weeks the renovations will be almost finished, and the only things missing will be some small details that I’ll need your input for.”
. He didn’t know if the other things – portraits and house-elves fleeing in fear at the sight of him – had anything to do with it.
“Thanks.” The smile on Malfoy’s face was a smug one, but rightfully so, Harry supposed. “You’ll proceed with the purchase as intended, then, I presume?”
It wasn’t something Harry was used to - eating out, that was. In fact, he’d never done it before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. And so by the time he had washed up, gotten changed, and then taken by his godfather to some café in Moscow, he was quickly becoming distracted from what had happened with Lily. He couldn’t
”You changed the kitchen,” was what Harry responded with, as soon as he saw the tiled floor and light yellow walls. ”It’s no longer pink.”
His godfather was a tall man. He was pale, too, with dark hair and pale grey eyes. His robes were black and heavy, with small shifting runes sown into its corners and folds. The man’s wand was strapped into his arm, ready to be used at a moment’s notice. He didn’t smile when he saw Harry. Not that it mattered - Harry had never seen him smile, anyway.
or stop feeling anxious, but it was easier to tell himself to not think about it with physical distance and so much change around him.
“I’m not saying that it’s not impressive,” Mr. Nott continued, as if knowing what Harry was thinking. “Because it is. How did you command it?”
”Terrible, was it?” Petunia sneered. ”You should be grateful that we even took you in.” He words were harsh, but there was something off in the way she spoke. The contempt that Harry had grown used to, wasn’t there, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about its absence. Or how to respond to his aunt, who followed him as he walked past her towards the cupboard under the stairs. The place hadn’t been used as anything but an actual cupboard for years, but Merlin... he just couldn’t move past it without touching the door and thinking of the times he was trapped on the other side of it. The renovators hadn’t changed the door, and Harry almost hoped that they would’ve.
evaded a sentence in Azkaban after the first war ended. You don’t need to give Aurors reasons to look your way again.”
”Oh, the renovation will start immediately, then?” Hermione asked, sounding pleased. ”That’s very good. I’d offer to come with you, but I’ll be meeting Lisa Turpin to discuss our upcoming study schedule. She’s going back to finish her studies as well.”
Hesitantly Harry left his room, leaving his slippers behind in an attempt to move as quietly as he possibly could. The knew which floorboards to avoid, though he doubted that Lily could’ve heard their quiet creaking over her cries. Despite this, Harry inched through the corridor carefully, stopping by the top of the stairs. From there he could look at the hall below, where he could now see Lily holding James’s torso to her chest, rocking back and forth while wailing by the fireplace. The man’s legs were in pieces, both feet lying by the bottom of the stairs - a parody of a pair of shoes. Had he tripped? Had he been trying to crawl to the fireplace before he gave up?
”We know, mate,” Ron replied with a grin, and reached to ruffle Harry’s hair. ”We know you’re a bleeding heart, all right?”
“Mate, I wish I could’ve seen that,” Ron sighed wistfully. “Bet you he looked dumb. He did, didn’t he?”
Back then Uncle Tony’s visits had been different, too. He’d first spend time with Harry’s parents, discussing some papers and books and things Harry didn’t understand. Back then Harry had wondered why it was that Uncle Tony was his godfather when he didn’t appear to be a close friend of either of Harry’s parents, but… well… the Potters didn’t have many friends. Harry had never met anyone else - he’d met none of the few people his parents had told him they would visit sometimes. In the end there wasn’t much else Harry could do but accept the situation as it was - Uncle Tony was nice to him, and that was good enough.
“That slippery fuck,” Ellis said. “He’ll run back when the Dark Lord rises. And we’ll get our pound of flesh out of him then. And in the meanwhile, we simply wait.”
“The boy brought his father back,” Antonin then said. Nott startled, his round eyes becoming even rounder, now gaining a gleam of something unsettling. “Brought him back well enough that his mother thinks the man never died.” Harry noticed that his godfather didn’t mention that Lily wasn’t in any condition to make logical conclusions, and that Harry’s revival of James was truly far from perfect.
Harry was still unsure of what was actually being discussed, and felt grateful when Healer Crabbe handed him the small bowl of Floo Powder. He couldn’t get to the fireplace fast enough, wanting nothing more than to leave the tense atmosphere behind.
“Something along those lines,” Antonin replied. “And someone owes me a favour, anyway.” The man then pulled out a stick, holding its other end towards Harry. “Latch onto that, we’ll be using a portkey as Flooing there is highly impractical.”
But most importantly, perhaps, Harry wouldn’t know that this association would inevitably lead him towards a dangerous career full of pain and horror on his end, and fear and respect on everybody else’s. If he reached maturity uninterrupted, no one would dare to oppose him, and he’d serve the Dark Lord as a Death Eater unlike any other.
“I have a question,” Harry said. “If I can re-animate the body, and summon the soul… then why can’t I just bring the person back?”
”Oh, Merlin, I hope not,” Harry joined the conversation with a grimace. ”I don’t want to make anyone feel guilty. Or grateful. Or like they owe me something.”
Harry looked at Malfoy’s face, really looked at it - the pointy chin and narrow eyes. The thin eyebrows and pink lips. The eyes, a shade so light blue they were almost grey. It was kind of funny how despite years of knowing each other, Harry had never really looked at Malfoy before.
"No," Bellatrix sneered. "Those little blood traitors know nothing, and simply drift from day to day, getting duller as time passes. They will be defenseless when the Dark Lord rises again, and not even their little Boy-Who-Lived can help them."
“You know,” Harry said, louder this time to catch Malfoy’s attention. “I don’t dislike you. Or resent you, if you have thought that at some point while working on this cottage.”
It had been the reason why his parents had kept him away from the world outside after all: they’d told him that if anyone found out about the things he could do, they’d take him and never bring him back. And when he’d asked if what was
“I’m Caspar Crabbe,” the man said, as if he hadn’t been introduced already. “I’m a Healer at St. Mungo’s, where I work most of the time as a psychotherapist. I specialize in long-term treatment of children, teens, and young adults from alternative family backgrounds.”
Harry was startled when Crabbe suddenly gestured at him. “He’s very pale,” the man said. “His posture is
The thought of becoming friends with Malfoy wasn’t something Harry had expected to ever want, but here he was… embarrassingly happy to have his schooltime rival give him a chance to properly reconcile. To give them a chance. A chance to have a second beginning at a friendship that could’ve begun years ago.
“I don’t think so,” Malfoy argued. “I don’t think anyone with your kind of unhappiness can be understood by means of mere observation. And I feel like an idiot for not realizing that sooner.”
It was Harry he was thinking of when in early February, while attending some celebration or another held by the Malfoys, Ellis saw his son talking with Lucius’s spawn. Sheltered children inspired a bone-deep repulsion in him, and his blood itched to wake those little bags of flesh to the cruel reality of existence. He should’ve raised his Theo the way baby Potter had apparently been raised - aware of death, if not of evil in this world. His wife had, unfortunately, taken the lead in raising the boy, and by now Ellis simply didn’t have the desire to invest that energy into Theo.
Harry really enjoyed meeting Ron and Hermione at different muggle coffee shops. People never stared at him, and though the food was often dry, the tea just all right, and prices high, none of that made the experience any worse. It helped, also, that Hermione would come up with different coffee shops for them to visit every time.
“Well, isn’t that also a chance for you?” Ron pointed out. “A chance to just throw your confession at him and then spend months apart just after. If it’s mutual, he’ll contact you, and if it’s not, well… at least you won’t have to see his face around.”
He’d just need to figure out what to do next, and hopefully he would figure out something better than renting a flat somewhere and sleeping for a year.
“Thank you,” Harry replied, hesitantly then asking: “should I now go to the lesson with Mrs. Goyle even though I’m late?”
"None," Harry replied, finding it hard to tell if there was anything he'd need to know more about without first experimenting with what Bellatrix had now told him. He didn't have a practice wand, as Bellatrix had so helpfully pointed out before, and didn't know how good or bad his aim would be. At the same time practicing his aim was the only thing he could come up with that would give him something to do.
The darkness intensified as Harry walked, and strangely enough no matter which way he went, he could still hear the wailing. His skin was cold and wet though he
Malfoy startled, before tilting his head and looking at Harry again, quietly, for a while. “You’re serious?”
“Mud and gypsum,” Uncle Tony said, leading Harry forward as he continued: “the whole town is made of that and reinforced with magic the kind of which even I cannot comprehend. The entrance that we’ll be using is the sixth one, and should be— Ah, there!”
“Here,” Bellatrix said suddenly. Harry looked at her first, before taking a look at the room they were now in - it wasn’t special by any means. There was a table with a large box on it. The walls were stained and white, the floor was wooden and creaky.
“Failing is very unlikely,” Crabbe said soothingly. “Your godfather has told me that you’ve studied quite a bit.”
”Oh, this is new, too,” Harry observed, walking closer to the stove. ”This isn’t the one you burned my hand on.”
”It’s fine, thank you,” Harry cut in, shaking his head. ”I  just came to say goodbye one last time. Good luck with, um, your life, Dudley. Take care.”
“You don’t need to worry,” Ellis said. “You know him. It’s Caspar Crabbe. If there’s anyone who could handle it, it’ll be him.”
Harry quieted down when he looked at Malfoy again, and saw him looking at Harry with the strangest expression on his face. A curious face, without an ounce of the haughtiness and contempt that was so typical to it. Malfoy was now looking at him in a way that reminded Harry - strangely enough - of Sirius. Something about that look of almost amused wonder, that likely had snuck up on Malfoy’s face uninvited, made Harry’s lungs expand and heart beat faster.
”Harry,” Hermione said, her brown eyes bright with tears, reaching him mere seconds after Ron. There was dirt on her face, but she looked unharmed. ”Harry, it’s over. You did it. We all did it. It’s over.” Her voice was shaky and shrill, as if she couldn’t believe the words she was saying.
“It’s a good sound,” Harry said. The door of his cupboard had never creaked. No hinges had ever creakd at the Dursleys, and if any ever did, well… it had been his job to make sure they didn’t do that for long. “Say, you never did tell me the name of this area?”
"It's a forest cottage," Harry explained. "With no neighbours in sight. As soon as you enter, there's this large space with a kitchen on one end and a living room on another. Further in, there's a bathroom and two bedrooms."
So focused on his little observations he was, that Harry didn’t notice his godfather watching him. The sharp grey eyes took in the boy’s sickly pale complexion, his clean but clearly barely brushed hair, and robes that were woefully mismatched. It was clear that while the boy hadn’t been left entirely to his own devices - not with the house-elves providing him with some functions of normalcy - there was no one to help him further than that.
“And what does that way of thinking tell you?” he asked. “They’ve left that school decades ago yet are still trapped in that
Harry thought, now paying attention to the large box that had been in the room before them. From the corner of his eye he could see that the doorway was empty. Similarly, there was no one hanging from the ceiling.
“She can’t enter your room now, even if the door is open,” Uncle Tony said. “No one but you and I can enter this room.”
”She’s safe. It helps that she saved you, and that you openly said so. Lucius is already being held in Azkaban, which I think is too good for him.”
He didn’t trust the House. And he knew better than to mistake the Woods for an ally. But at least this place was
? The one Uncle Tony had disconnected from the Floo? What had James been trying to do there? Was it a coincidence? It
it made him feel. As if a cavity inside of him had been filled, and the aching pain from it was fading fast.
Harry didn’t care to point out that he didn’t have any school materials yet either - he didn’t even know which books he’d need to buy eventually - as he had studied the basics from a few scattered sources. Either way, most people likely didn’t have the burning need to escape into books and forget about their lives the way Harry did.
”That does make sense,” Hermione agreed. ”Voldemort is dead, and everything we fought so hard for is now done. And Harry had to be the one to... to defeat him. Perhaps he’ll feel better after some food and rest. And a shower. Merlin, those are things we all need, aren’t they?”
When Uncle Tony switched back to that other language to continue the discussion, Harry looked down at his wand. His pretty and strange wand, and Merlin he had never been this fond of strangeness before. Because this strangeness was his friend, and— Hadn’t the witch said that the olive tree wood his wand was made of stood for friendship? Not to mention that amid all that talk about lightning and fire and elements, she had said that the creature whose feather was at the core of his wand was also some sort of a protector. It had to mean something, right?
McGonagall’s office was just as neat as Harry remembered. His thoughts were swirling in his head, and though there was an unpleasant feeling coiling at the pit of his stomach, he didn’t react to it. He didn’t resist when Hermione sat him down on the couch, or when Ron kneeled down to take off Harry’s shoes. There was a deafening silence inside of him, and where there had been purpose before, was now a vast, hollow uncertainty.
“I don’t even know if he thinks of me that way,” Harry muttered. “Hell, I don’t even know if the way I I like him is what I think it is.”
“More time to worry about this, you mean,” Harry sighed, and rubbed his eyes. “You’re right. I’ll just… wait and see, for a bit. There’s no rush, is there? Aside from, you know, him moving to France to study at Beauxbatons.”
Malfoy made a noise of annoyance, before gesturing for Harry to get up. “They left. The fireplace is now connected to the Floo system, so you can name this place whenever you feel like it. The renovations are more or less done now, so only decorating is left. Do you have any ideas regarding that?”
“Get back to normal,” Harry repeated, and frowned. “I wish I knew what normal was. Merlin, remember when we thought that losing a hundred points during our first year was terrible?”
”I’m sure they told you, but the war is over for good, now,” he said. ”And I won’t be coming here after today.”
Uncle Tony let out an angry hiss, before he turned on his heels, visibly forcing himself to remain calm as he noticed Harry again. He then, watching Harry, said:
“Enough.” Bellatrix’s voice brought him crashing back, and as Harry blinked his eyes open, he saw her right in front of him, with barely two steps between them. The woman was looking at him with wide,
On that day, Harry didn’t wake up for dinner. He slept until half past eleven the next morning, and woke up feeling disoriented and guilty for the hours he wasted.
”Come in,” Petunia hissed, yanking him inside and shutting the door behind him. ”Before the neighbors see you! What are you doing here?”
“Why is it an unforgivable?” Harry asked, almost frantic. He’d never heard of a spell so perfect, and here Uncle Tony was telling him that using it would come with a prison sentence!
”I’m not complaining, but what and why?” Harry asked, following Malfoy into one of the bedrooms, where a goblin was working on painting the walls. ”What about the outside? I think it looks fine.”
”You can do it if you’d like,” Harry offered, suspecting that Malfoy would find some bizarre joy in deciding how pointy the window frames ought to be. ”I don’t really care, to be honest.”
, and— and Harry didn’t want to risk it. And so he remained there, in that House, in Mordred’s Mend, seeing no one but his parents and his godfather.
Her eyes were wide and dark, pale face framed by wild black curls, red lips pursed into a pout. She walked like his lullabies flowed, and she saw him like no one else had. Harry stared at her, a melody teasing his mind with every step she took closer.
Wasn’t it unfair that he was being treated like this? He hadn’t done anything bad, and yet everyone treated him as if he was the worst of mankind. Nott had said that creatures could tell that there was something off about him, but why was being a necromancer something
Harry didn’t go to his lesson with Mrs. Goyle. In fact, he didn’t go to his session with Mr. Crabbe either, though perhaps he could’ve.
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Nothing.” Besides, he’d been spending most of his time studying away from home, anyway. It was strange how things had changed. He could now leave Mordred’s Mend as many times as he wanted to, but Lily couldn’t. It used to be the other way around, and Harry never actually thought that they’d reach a point where his mother would be nothing but a living ghost haunting the hallways of her own home.
Antonin wasn’t sure if the boy had ever been to Diagon Alley, and he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to go there. “While many do choose to purchase their school supplies from the many stores of Diagon Alley, it is likely that we’ll only go there for your books. The other equipment, such as wand and robes, we’ll be getting from elsewhere. It is of great importance to value craftmanship in even the smallest of details, and there aren’t many capable of delivering that here. There are some in Russia, of course, and some more scattered across Asia and Africa. Each region has things they specialize in even if their expertise encompasses all elements of magic, purely due to how living conditions have shaped their heritage throughout the times. To learn herbology or healing, I’d have taken you to parts of Asia. For runes, I’d have taken you to South America. For your wand? That’ll be the Arabs - particularly the ones in central North Africa.”
”Honestly, all I want is to just... sort out... my life?” Harry admitted, the end of his sentence more of a question than a statement of intent. ”I don’t think I can focus on... classes and essays. Not right now, I mean. Nor after the summer. I just need to... sort myself out before I can do anything. I could take my NEWTs at some point, after studying on my own, but I... I don’t think I can stay.” Not after everything that had happened. Not when there were so many bad memories mixed with the good ones, at every corner of the castle.
“I’m not lying,” Harry insisted, still smiling. There was sunlight coming in through the window and warming up his back and the nape of his neck, and he fleetingly thought of all the early mornings he could have here on his own. “I can— I don’t have a pensieve right now at hand, but I could show you when I get one? There’s so much— I’ve ridden a centaur, did you know? And saw inferi up-close, too. And—”
Harry wasn't entirely sure what to expect from his sessions with Bellatrix, the witch never telling him in advance what she had planned. She had started out with meditation a long time ago, and over the span of the months they'd spent, she'd discussed politics and weaponry and even healing with him from time to time. This time, she seemed to have something new and exciting in mind.
There were no people wandering around, no dirt on the streets, no open vendors or noise. It felt as close to peace as Harry could possibly imagine.
Nott sighed, his wide smile becoming something smaller, softer. He looked down at the cadaver on the table, fingertips gliding lightly over the contours of its face. “This one was June,” he said out of nowhere. “She feared death just like anyone else, but remains unaware of the fate of her remains now. People fear that loss of awareness - the thought of no longer being a conscious, thinking creature is unbearable, because… of all the things you will no longer have. And the animal desire to survive - to live on and see another day - is powerful.”
He didn’t want to regret this. He wasn’t sure what he was there for, but leaving now felt wrong. Vernon’s car was nowhere to be seen, and Harry wondered if Petunia wasn’t home either. Harry took a deep breath and began walking towards the front door, knowing in his heart that this would be the last time he ever came here. Moments after he rang the doorbell, he could hear someone walking inside, and the door opened to reveal Aunt Petunia. Her thin, blonde hair was longer than Harry remember, and the pale blue dress she was wearing was equally unfamiliar. The moment she realized who was standing in front of her, the pleasant smile on her face dropped, and Harry briefly thought of how unfamiliar that had made her face to him. She had never showed him a pleasant smile, after all.
“So, you’ve been having brunches with McGonagall lately, eh?” Ron suddenly said, turning to Hermione. “Talk about taking all courses at once again?”
”Malfoy,” Harry said aloud, startling the other wizard. Surprisingly, seeing Malfoy wasn’t upsetting at all, and Harry’s past urge to pick a fight with the other wizard every time they crossed paths had disappeared during the war. ”Fancy seeing you here.”
”Thanks,” Harry said, reluctantly accepting the offered portfolio. ”But, well, let’s leave setting up the next appointment for now? I’d like to, uh, check first when I’m available.”
”Not the kind of a cottage that you and the Weaslette would want,” Malfoy replied sharply, a pink tinge appearing on his cheeks. ”It’s too small to fit your enormous ego, Potter, and too removed for your adoring fans to find you.”
keep it a secret, Lily. How can he practice and become better if he’s hindered by the need to keep it all a secret?”
“This way,” Uncle Tony said, walking ahead. Harry hurried after the man, almost running to keep up with his long strides and they headed down a hallway. Its walls were painted red, with flashes of gold here and here. Above his head Harry could see figures of strange creatures etched into the ceiling, their little twisted faces looking down at them. “This is my office,” Uncle Tony said, pushing a door open and gesturing for Harry to follow him in. “I don’t expect you to remember it. Sit down and don’t touch anything.”
”You’ll be fine,” Ron told her, before he continued: ”Bill will stay in England a bit longer, and he’ll help me with the shop. Mum thinks they wouldn’t have wanted to... they wouldn’t have wanted for the shop to disappear.”
Harry nodded, hoping that Nott would be able to teach him more than just the theory of these activation and deactivation words. He hadn’t needed any before, so… how could he apply them now, belatedly?
For a moment Harry entertained the thought of asking more: had she eaten? Had she slept, or showered, or done anything more than wander around? He almost did, opening his eyes with the question ready to spill out, but stopped because—if he asked, did that mean that there was an answer he wanted to hear? Would asking make him hope foolishly?
“Ron, stop being silly,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes. “I think Professor Dumbledore kept as much as he could from being commonly known. I suppose if he hadn’t, the Ministry would have attempted interfering in school affairs much earlier. Especially when the situation with Ginny was already so awful at the time…”
”I’m meeting Malfoy again next week,” Harry said, changing the subject back to his project, in hopes of diffusing another argument between his best friends. ”On Tuesday. At the cottage, that is. He didn’t say if it had a name, so I’ll have to use the portkey he gave me.”
“Lily!” Uncle Tony snapped, his voice loud enough to startle Harry - especially as the man was still facing him. “Harry will go to Hogwarts, I’ve accepted that. But I will
“Our Lord never wasted time hesitating,” Bellatrix continued. “I expect that of you as well - unrestrained effort, baby necromancer. The moment you hesitate, I’ll drop you into a well so deep and dark you won’t be able to climb your way out of it, and leave you there to rot. Don’t think I won’t. Even Dolohov wouldn’t be able to find you.”
“Dreadfully lacking in knowledge, I see,” Nott said, sounding amused. “Necromancy isn’t just Dark - it’s Black Magic. Illegal in most countries, though there are ways around that. Now… there is a popular misconception that necromancy is a question of resurrection. That’s not quite it, as I’m sure you’ve realized. You can animate the body all you want, but the dead will not return.”
Instead she stood still for ages. Long enough to make Harry worry about running late to his lesson with Mrs. Goyle - she'd told him that this week they'd be going through some of the most notable pureblood families. He's not sure what he'd do with that information, anyway - would people at Hogwarts really care about such things? She's also asked him about learning French to be able to talk more, and how was Harry supposed to tell her that most days he didn't want to know English either?
“Dumbledore keeping secrets isn’t new, that’s for sure,” Harry said, expecting to feel a familiar pang of resentment. He was surprised by its absence, however, and briefly wondered if he was actually moving on. It didn’t seem possible.
“Of course,” Harry replied, cutting a piece of his tvorog and caviar blini, thinking that if keeping secrets was all it took for Uncle Tony to tell him interesting things, then surely it was easiest thing to promise.
Uncle Tony’s face twitched into a grimace before he dug out his wand and beckoned Harry closer to the doorway. Without explaining anything, the man tapped the tip of his wand against Harry’s hand, before then waving it in the doorway, muttering something at a volume too low for Harry to hear. It was fairly easy to guess what was happening, however, when what seemed like rippling air manifested at the doorway, before fading back into nothingness again.
“Well then,” Healer Crabbe started, gesturing for Harry to take a seat. “I know this may feel strange or awkward to you - that’s perfectly normal. I don’t think anyone knows how to talk about themselves when they know they’re being listened to. Not right away anyway.”
Not— not the kind of sick that would’ve kept him from his lessons. Just sick enough for him to be aware of the nausea toeing the line of tolerance. It certainly kept his thoughts in line for the first few moments after waking, purely occupied with whether or not he'd be throwing up soon. And it was only after deciding that perhaps not, that he noticed the sound of... something coming from outside his room.
Harry nodded, and held back a groan when Nott began piling books in front of him. The man was clearly knowledgeable and eager to teach him about history and the theories relating to necromancy, and the more questions Harry asked, the more pleasant he appeared to become. Harry didn’t
However, there was just… one thing. One little thing that he couldn’t quite shake off, and it’s the same thing that made his thoughts return to his mother’s stomping. Was it truly grief that had made her now turn to Harry and lie quietly in wait? Was it grief that turned her head and had her eyes following him?
Ah. Speak of the devil. Though, to be fair to this particular devil striding towards Lily, it wasn’t unusual for Uncle Tony to come as early as he could on Harry’s birthday. Lily, ankle-deep in a puddle of something, turned to wave at the wizard approaching her.
“Something is wrong with your mother,” Uncle Tony said immediately, and something about the way he said it made a lump form in Harry’s throat. He swallowed, eyes burning. “What happened? Did she do anything to you?”
'Just what was she up to during the war,' Harry thought then, doubting that all this advice was coming from a purely theoretical standpoint. He nodded, doubting that he'd ever have a reason to send a cutting curse at anyone's genitals.
“No,” Harry confirmed, remembering with clarity that there had been no words involved – only a desperate wish. “Nothing.”
“Why would he need a therapist, then?” Dolohov asked. “If it’s a matter of him finding more people to talk with, why not just introduce him to your kid and the blond brat with him?”
Harry startled when he heard Nott’s voice the moment he stepped out of the fireplace. He saw the man standing a few steps away, dressed in robes so dark it was hard to tell their colours. His round eyes were fixed on Harry, before the man gestured for him to follow. And Harry did.
Harry let out a sigh, cursing quietly. His fingers curled around the handle of a knife he had stolen from the kitchen before. “What time is it?” he then asked.
“A ghost in the sense that I explained - a ghost like those you’ll encounter at Hogwarts - is no longer human. It is a creature under the categorization of a spirit. It is a different being. What
”You don’t really believe that, do you? I had to work for you and Vernon just to be able to get some leftovers to eat.”
“Vurney,” Harry said, hating how strange he felt to be speaking out loud in the House, and knowing that the house-elf would hear him even if it didn’t dare to appear. “Bring my mother back in. You can leave James out if he’s not fast enough to follow.”
”Yeah, that too,” Ron sighed. ”Don’t worry, we’ll get to it soon. But it’s better to rest and be organized than to, you know... just go without a plan on what to do after you find them.”
“Master James is no longer moving,” the house-elf replied, avoiding eye-contact. “Mistress found Master’s remains by the fireplace.”
“Dolohov,” a woman behind the counter said, before continuing in a language Harry didn’t recognize. She was an exceptionally tall woman, with dark hair braided on top of her head, wrapped in a fabric that shimmered in the light. Uncle Tony replied in that same language, and after a few minutes of talking, Harry felt his godfather’s grip on his shoulder.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Hermione said, before she remembered something and turned to Harry. “You know, I asked her about whether or not Malfoy will be coming back to Hogwarts. He won’t, is what she told me. Apparently he will wrap up his studies in Beauxbatons.”
”A cottage?” Harry asked, interested. A cottage sounded nice. ”What kind of a cottage? I’m looking to buy a house, you see.”
Ellis Nott found odd creatures to be infinitely worthier of his time than many others. He didn’t find the boy particularly bright, but at least he was willing to read and learn and keep trying. He asked questions, but didn’t seem to quite grasp his own situation, or the importance of the people who had agreed to teach him. Regardless, he was respectful and quiet, always on time, always with his homework carefully completed.
Feather duster. It made Harry think of Aunt Petunia. Petunia. How was she doing? How soon would someone tell them that they could move back? This time without Harry. She’d be so happy to hear that, for sure. She never did like him. Harry wasn’t
Harry curled up in his hiding spot, wondering what would happen next. Lily would have to let go of James eventually - but would she then snap back to reality? Was that a possibility? Merlin, if it
spells necromancers use – but we will get to that part later. Currently, from what I’ve understood after asking Dolohov more about your… living conditions, what you’re using to animate your father is instinctive - it’s crude, undignified, and
A bit over a week before Hermione was set to leave for Hogwarts - the trip to Australia that she never went on to hanging over her like a bad dream - she decided to distract herself by looking for more books that could keep her entertained. At first Ron and Harry had tried valiantly to keep up with her, before the boys had opted to wait for her in an ice cream shop.
One of the things that he had liked about the cottage, was a bench not far from the house. A bench surrounded by shrubbery and small, colourful flowers that Harry couldn’t name. There was no stream or a lake nearby to complete the picture, and no birds were there to add sound to the summer days, but the landscape that he could see from that bench was breathaking in its own right: vast fields of even greenery, hills going up and down as far as the eye could see. No neighbours in sight. No man-made roads, either. No car could reach him, and if anyone flew on a broomstick this way, he’d see them coming well before they could reach him.
Harry nodded, unsure if he was expected to say anything. He knew – he wasn’t sure how, but he could tell – that Ellis Nott was not like him. Maybe he
“I just…” Harry looked at his melting ice cream with a frown on his face, before blurting out: “I’m just so tired of being anxious all the time, you know? Always something to worry about. Always losing sleep, never being able to focus on things, just because there’s so much to worry about. I want some time to not worry, you know? Not worry about grades, not worry about people, not worry about anything. And I don’t think that that trying anything with Malfoy - if he’s even interested - is going to help with that.”
She certainly was present enough to argue against Uncle Tony’s constant efforts to convince her to send Harry to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. Harry wasn’t sure why Uncle Tony needed Lily’s permission - he certainly never needed it for anything else - but suspected it was just one of those things that would need a guardian’s permission rather than simply a godfather’s.
managing to keep his fear at bay now. He didn’t know what he was supposed to do, only that he wasn’t supposed to be
“The Unforgivables,” Harry realized, having heard of the curses before, but hadn’t really read anything specifically about them.
She had to have been aware, on some level, of James’s fragility - she no longer sat on his lap, and there were no longer sounds coming from her bedroom at night. Harry no longer found pieces of his father in the corridor outside his room, and even the pace at which the two walked had slowed down considerably.
“You need much more than a wand,” Antonin replied, wondering if there was a particular reason for the boy’s focus on a wand in particular. Then again, with Lily still roaming around, was it any wonder? “We can do that next Saturday. I’ll come by Mordred’s Mend and have a word with your mother before we go.”
“Potter, you’re lying,” Malfoy snapped, taking a step towards him. “There’s no way— Merlin, is this why your friends think the sun shines out of your arse, you reckless bellend? There’s no way any of that is true!”
“Yes,” Harry replied, not knowing what else to say. Lestrange had turned to look at him as well, leaning closer and closer. Her breath smelled like candy when she spoke:
”Unlikely,” Ginny said. ”I doubt that he’ll be in a hurry to ever go back there. Not after everything he did. From what I understood, he has to deal with family issues now. And for a family with no upcoming funerals, they have a remarkable number of skeletons in their closets.”
Antonin looked at Harry, who had clearly been waiting to share his news. The boy had patiently sat through most of the lunch listening to his godfather, but couldn’t wait any longer.
”Hi Dudley,” Harry replied, ignoring Piers entirely, before he turned back to Petunia. When he spoke, his voice was calm and light. ”I didn’t expect much from you and your husband. But I did expect more than to be locked in your cupboard or have bars in my windows and barely any food to eat. I’m grateful to the Weasleys, because they’ve been more of a family and you ever have.”
“Is that why you joined him?” Harry asked. Antonin almost smiled, appreciating the question as much as the anti-eavesdropping runes etched onto the tables.
Despite what Uncle Tony had ordered, Bella took Harry away from their designated study the moment the two of them were left alone. She hushed him, then pulled him along through corridors Harry wouldn’t know how to navigate on his own. Their footsteps were quiet, and yet Harry knew that they could be heard – or would have been heard, had Hillcrest been anything like the House. It wasn’t, and so they kept walking undisturbed, until they reached what appeared to be a chapel within the premises.
? Harry didn’t think so, but what could be worse than what she was like now anyway? If he just left her out overnight… what would happen? Would Harry open the door for her in the morning? Would he dare to, or would that be allowing the Woods in? Was whatever lurked in there just hiding in the dark, watching and waiting for him to open a door or a window just a minute too early?
“Not before the lessons started,” Harry explained. “But since then I’ve been to Hillcrest many, many times. And then wherever Ellis Nott or Bellatrix Lestrange want to take me.”
“You know, trying to sound humbe after killing a Dark Lord isn’t really working for you. It wouldn’t work for anything either, really, so don’t take it personally.”
Footsteps. Shuffling footsteps, familiar footsteps that hadn't come to his room in ages. She was walking in the hallway, slowly but steadily coming closer, and there was something terrifying about that.
“Caspar,” Uncle Tony then said, “I don’t need to tell you what will happen if the boy is harmed in any way. I might not much care for children in general, but he’s a bit different.”
“I guess I’m just happy to have one less person hating me,” Harry said, shrugging. “I went to Privet Drive a few weeks ago, you know. I… I don’t know why I thought that anything would be different. Petunia still hates me. I thought I’d find closure, but… Merlin, that was not it at all. So I suppose that maybe having now a better relationship with Malfoy is making up for that disappointment.”
necromancy certainly is. Thanks to the fools fascinated by inferi, we’ll need to have those laws repealed first before we go touting the boy around.”
“Very,” Nott admitted, before turning back to Harry. “Tell me, boy, what do you know of necromancy?”
“I need a proof of his powers,” Nott shot back. “I don’t know what he’s capable of, do I? What has he done to convince you?”
“A grown man’s body for an entire week?” Nott murmured, another smile making an appearance. “How extraordinary. What else can he do?”
Bellatrix didn’t look like she expected any other answer. Instead, she led him to another part of Hillcrest, and had him do it all over again.
”That’s good,” Hermione said, pulling him along, back towards the castle. People - Aurors, probably - rushed past them and towards Voldemort’s body. Harry wasn’t sure what they were going to do with it, and he didn’t really want to find out. He was done with his part now, wasn’t he? He was done, and so was everyone else he had dragged with him into this mess. Ron and Hermione could go ahead and live their lives normally from now on, couldn’t they? There would be no need for sneaking around or battling basilisks or breaking out of places on the back of a dragon.
“We’ll begin starting from next Monday,” Uncle Tony said, now looking at Harry, making the boy straighten up and listen again. “Harry, you’ll be Flooing here on your own for your first lesson.”
“Oh, no, no,” Lily interrupted, brushing her hand across James’s cheek, accidentally scraping a strip of skinn off his face. “That’s really sweet of you, but James doesn’t like when Harry leaves for a long time. He’s so paranoid about Harry’s secret, isn’t he? We don’t want anything to happen to him.”
“I do not know what makes you doubt,” the witch said, “but rest assured, I know what I’m doing. That’s why you’re here.”
The place didn’t look like much from the outside, but on the inside it was nothing like anything Harry had seen. It was large and bright, with round tables and pretty chairs and bright green plants everywhere. It wasn’t full, but even the presence of the few people there was strangely exciting and scary. He didn’t think he’d ever seen this many living people at once, and though Mr. Crabbe had discussed this issue with him, they hadn’t done any actual practice to get Harry used to people.
”Ron, his hair was looking just fine,” Hermione huffed, slapped Ron’s hand away, and tried to comb Harry’s hair back to how it was before with her fingers. Harry couldn’t help but smile, a sudden surge of happiness catching him by surprise. The warmth of Ron’s hand, the gentleness of Hermione’s fingers, this light-filled moment and the food they could enjoy in peace... Merlin, wasn’t
"And who knows when you'll need to sort someone out with your little fists to avoid compromising your wand," the witch then continued, before digging the tip of the knife into the head of the illustration. "Given the option, always go for the head, baby. So many things you can achieve here: aim for the temple or jaw of a knockout, nose and eyes to confuse their senses, and neck to stop them from talking - or breathing, for that matter. Your problem with this will be, of course, will be your reach. A jinx could go through, so don't discount the head even if you can't physically get to it."
. To get to this point. To get to a point where Voldemort was well and truly dead. He was dead, wasn’t he? His horcruxes had all been destroyed, his supporters had been revealed, and there was no going back. Ron and Hermione—
“What does that mean?” Harry asked, head spinning. He didn’t want Healer Crabbe to think he was dumb, but he didn’t understand most of the things the man had just talked about.
And— and he’d been right. She had been waiting for him quietly, all this time. What did she want? She could’ve easily found him under his bed - why didn’t she, if she wanted him?
Unlike the Imperius Curse, Harry couldn’t find much to like about this one. Again - where was the fun in causing someone pain?
Harry thought sadly, watching Nott fiddle with the corpse without noticing anything different about it.
“—will teach you alongside Nott and I. We will create a schedule for you to follow carefully, with plenty of materials for you to study.”
Malfoy was quite for a few moments, before he huffed in resignation. “It’s fine. The name isn’t horrible. Very obvious, and not exciting at all, but I guess that’s right up your alley, isn’t it?”
“You told me that was accidental magic, didn’t you? You didn’t say anything in order to bring him back, and so it’ll be impossible to tell what is actually powering him at the moment. Could be you, or could be any other power source you’ve connected him to unwittingly. This is why it’s so difficult to fix damage caused by accidental magic - you never really
“Unfortunately your mother does not quite understand that,” Uncle Tony continued. “And she has decided that when your formal schooling begins next year, you will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They will not teach you anything about necromancy there.”
“Aren’t sirens water-bound?” Harry asked, confused. “Aren’t they the singing water creatures that lure people to their deaths? Switzerland doesn’t border a body of water, right? Why would they—”
Uncle Tony had sent him an owl earlier today, saying that he’d introduce Harry to a therapist. A therapist! Wasn’t it his mother who needed one and not him? He’d read about therapists too - what would they be able to do anyway? He wasn’t crazy, and no amount of talking to some stranger was going to change the House. Or change Harry.
“Seems to have his life sorted out, doesn’t he?” Ron said. “Got work, got studies to take care of. Family alive. Has a way out of everything, like the slippery snake that he is.”
Harry missed the days when his parents had been strict with him. Now no one told him when to sleep or eat or wash unless his godfather came to visit, and
“All that is normal for someone with your background,” Healer Crabbe continued. “However, it being normal doesn’t mean that you can’t change it or overcome it. And that is where our discussions come into play. We can start this session slowly, test the waters, and see how you feel about it. Nothing you say in this room will ever be repeated to anyone else outside of it, including your godfather.”
“Then it just goes back to what you want to do,” Ron said. “You could wait until he’s done with the house, before you suggest anything—”
Uncle Tony would arrive - sometimes the man turned up early, sometimes in the afternoon - but wanted to be ready as soon as he did.
But if his godfather so desired, he could sit through whatever lessons these were going to be. And maybe – just maybe – he would learn something useful after all.
“If it’s painless and fast—? Surely it’d be better for Li— mum to die like that than be whatever she is right now, right?”
“Wrong,” Ellis shot back. “As a necromancer he’ll need a balanced mind even more than the average person. Training a child’s endurance and ridding him of naivety is different from making him live a traumatizing childhood that could fracture his mind and leave him open and vulnerable to any attacks.”
Harry nodded, hating what he was hearing, and hating even more that he also didn’t think his mother would ever return to how she used to be.
On that day, the three had gone off to a new place with high windows, small round tables and uncomfortable wooden chairs. Harry held his cup of tea in his hands, enjoying the light that shone into the coffee shop. Ron had opted for a proper lunch, while Hermione was drinking some sort of a grass smoothie. It was likely to be their last time at one of these places for quite a while, however, since Hermione was set to return to Hogwarts in two weeks.
The thoughts of how his mother walked were pushed aside as Harry could finally crawl out from under his bed. He didn't know where to even begin explaining what had been happening so far in his day, and yet he knew that he'd have to. Uncle Tony wasn’t going to let this slide, that much was clear.
“If we’re doing this, can’t you just call me Harry?” Harry asked. Malfoy snorted, his thumbs rubbing gently against Harry’s cheeks.
“I know what you mean,” Harry agreed, “but honestly, I think I would have regretted it immediately. I just… I don’t think I’m ready for anything too stressful, you know?”
”Very well,” Malfoy said, still eyeing Harry with a look of suspicion, as if he wasn’t sure of what to expect. He then nodded curtly, before leading Harry to a door right between the two bedrooms. ”The bathroom was recently renovated and doesn’t need touching up, unless you’d like a different look.”
It took Harry nearly three weeks to finally visit Privet Drive. Unsurprisingly, nothing about the street had changed. The houses, neatly in a row, were untouched and just as they had been eight years ago before Harry's departure to Hogwarts. The Dursleys’ house was painfully familiar with its tidily trimmed green hedge, the tulips and pansies growing in the front garden, and the small wooden shed near the tree peeking from the back. It all made Harry stop and stare for a moment, feeling a strange ache in his chest. It was clear that the Dursleys had been quick to move in a reoccupy their house, now probably erasing any trace of Harry having ever lived with them.
“Some fool who’s already in your pocket?” Dolohov sneered. “They better have a thick skin and be able to handle the things a necromancer - no matter how inexperienced that necromancer is - will tell them. It’s only going to get worse as he grows up.”
Uncle Tony had, for some reason, come on Sunday to disconnect the fireplace indoors from the Floo Network, choosing to activate the fireplace outdoor. Harry didn’t think his godfather had discussed this with Lily before doing it, but didn’t dare to ask why. He simply accepted it, dreading already the thought of needing to go outside at night if he wanted to go anywhere late.
“No,” Harry replied immediately. Kitchens were no good, he didn’t like kitchens. Lily used to hang out a lot in the kitchen, even after James’s death, and Harry just couldn’t feel comfortable in one. Living rooms were no good either - they were too… too central. “Office is good.”
He hoped it was a coincidence. He hoped that the limb had fallen off the rotten corpse as it shuffled after Lily. Because if that wasn’t the case, it meant that for some reason James’s corpse had come to stand outside Harry’s closed door overnight, and that just… that was
”Isn’t that right,” Harry muttered, and shook his head. He then pushed the Daily Prophet aside and looked at Ginny. ”About the funeral—”
”Mate, it’s done!” Ron said, reaching to grab Harry’s shoulder. His voice was loud, but distant at the same time. ”You bloody did it!”
“Yes,” Uncle Tony said, voice sharp and impatient. “I saw that he wasn’t in his room. How about you and James spend the day together? I will take Harry to Diagon Alley to enjoy his day there.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I think he’s a git and though I know he was a victim of his circumstances when it comes to being a Death Eater, everything else was him being himself. The bullying, the slurs, all that. If he has changed, that’s good. Be careful, still, but, you know… do what makes you happy. For once, just think of nothing else but making you happy. Merlin knows you’ve earned that right by now.”
Harry thought of James, his breaking body a rotten shell that could barely hobble after Lily anymore. What would his mother do when his father’s corpse had fallen apart too much for it to function? Would she finally snap out of her misery and come back? Or was she going to sink deeper into her delusions and just… forget all about Harry?
No, Harry's world included things like his mother acting strange and coming to stand by his bed, apparently.
”Harry is not going to do that,” Hermione cut in sharply. ”We’re no longer going to be picking fights with Malfoy, or
Harry sat on the large white couch, too aware of the seams of his clothes and the topmost button of his shirt. The faint hum of a lullaby clung to him like a scent, though he doubted anyone else could hear it. He felt suffocated and anxious, and worst of all - even a bit disoriented. It was becoming harder and harder to make sense of things amid the strange events unfolding in his life, let alone try and figure out how
“What’s the matter with ghosts?” Harry asked. He wasn’t sure if he’d need to elaborate, but did so anyway: “How come there are ghosts that everybody can see, but then— I mean,
There was rubble all around him. And dust. Clouds of dust, heavier than he had ever seen before. The sky was grey, the ground was wet, and there was taste of blood in his mouth.
already since we all started teaching him. The boy has had virtually no guidance in how to behave around others prior to his lessons, and that’s been the case since long before James Potter died.”
“A ghost,” Nott continued, “is an imprint of the soul of a once-living wizard or witch. They’re fleshless spirits that linger having made the
When Harry arrived, he found himself in a dark room. It didn’t quite look right for a living room - the chairs were scattered, and there were too many tables. There were papers piled here and there, and a vase of water with some treats on a tray by one of the doors. The walls were lined with tall shelves full of books, and the floor was covered in carpets. There were no portraits.
necromancy, its history and theories as much as I myself know,” Nott said. “But that… other thing with the house-elves and portraits? I know nothing of that.”
“Nott must’ve told you,” the woman said. “There’s more to necromancy than raising the dead. It’s a whole different world. It’s a world you’ll need to hear and taste, and your eyes will only burden you. What you did here, now - do it
“Uncle Tony,” Harry called, running towards his godfather. The man spun around and seemed to let out a breath of relief when he saw Harry.
And whenever Harry had asked them why they’d come to Mordred’s Mend, then, they’d just… give him a sad little look and change the subject. They never explained it - they never explained anything, really - and so Harry had been forced to just accept the reality as it was, and deal with his curiosities on his own.
Harry left, and took a deep sigh of relief as soon as the door to Nettlewick’s office clicked shut behind him. He looked down at the portfolio the agent had given him, and wasn’t sure what he’d do with it. He could just keep it around, but he really hadn’t liked any of the offers he had seen so far, and—
Harry took a deep breath, slowly and quietly, still trying to remain calm despite the fearful chaos inside his head. He resigned himself to staying where he was for the time being, desperately vowing to start keeping a knife near him at all times, just in case. After all in times like these, when he didn't even have a wand yet, all he could do was try and hit where it hurt, just like Bellatrix had taught him. He felt stupid for not having taken that precaution yet, as now he was left only with the option of remaining where he was, waiting to be rescued.
“You said that it’d surely be better for Lily to die painlessly and quickly, than live the way she lives now,” Uncle Tony said. “That’s not quite the same as euthanizing someone with a fatal wound, now is it?”
“I recall the parties held a decade ago to have been much more crowded,” he replied, accepting the glass of wine Dolohov handed him. The other man nodded.
But… at least he didn’t need to stay with Lily. He couldn’t yet leave Mordred’s Mend whenever he wanted to, and so these sessions, regardless of how useless he found them, did provide him with something he otherwise wouldn’t have had. And while this kind of avoidance wasn’t really a
Things hadn’t been this bad at first. Not long ago his father had been alive and his mother had been aware and when the dark had become darker, he had been able to rest knowing his parents would be there for him. But then his father had
these curses are eventually. You mustn’t disagree with them. Now, to another question: do you believe your mother will ever become better?”
“They all are,” Uncle Tony replied. “Then we have the Cruciatus Curse. It inflicts pain so intense and excruciating, it can - and has - driven its victims insane. Despite popular misconceptions, however, it does not cause physical harm. The only way to identify it is by residual magic which doesn’t linger for a long time.”
”I don’t want to think about it right now,” Ginny interrupted, mustering up an apologetic smile. ”I’m really not thinking about any of that.”
Ellis saw Dolohov’s expression souring, and eventually the man shrugged. Ellis continued: “That boy has been living for almost half a year with his rotting father and his insane mother - whose conduct, let me remind you, is

“Oh come on, he’s likely struggling with things on his own, too,” Hermione argued. “Not that the backlash isn’t justified, but the Malfoys lost quite a bit in the aftermath. He’s now essentially trying to not just maintian his family’s responsibilities, but fix their name as well.”
”Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger,” McGonagall began, ”I’ve called you here to discuss the possibility of continuing your education here at Hogwarts. This offer will be also extended to the other students who should have been now on the verge of graduating.”
“Sure,” Harry said, and hurried to follow the other wizard in. The door creaked when it was opened, and the sound was something Aunt Petunia would have never abided by. “I like the noises,” Harry said. “Of the house, I mean.”
“All right,” Malfoy said, taking a few steps closer, stopping right in front of Harry. His palms, when her reached up to cradle Harry’s face, were dry and cold. “I expect more attention than you have given me so far, Potter. And I demand responses to my letters within three days.”
“Hogwarts will not be able to teach him what he needs to learn,” Uncle Tony said. “They know nothing of how to prepare him for life as someone capable of doing the things he can. In Hogwarts he’ll be doomed to hide that part of himself, suppress it and neglect it. Durmstrang—”
