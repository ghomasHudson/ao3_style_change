"Dumbledore's done something already," Draco complained. "I'm more comfortable not touching you than I am pressed against your side. He's already reactivated the warped blessing in some way. The spell he's working right now must be to extend his control spells over everyone once more."
They'd broken Dumbledore's power with one of the rituals in the book. Maybe there was another that would help. Hermione came over to read over Draco's shoulder, pursing her lips when Harry grinned at her. Ivy giggled and popped the red copy of the book in so that Hermione could read that one with Neville reading over her shoulder.
"Time to go get the wards set up to allow incoming messages," Harry declared, much to Professor McGonagall's amusement and Remus' dismay.
Dobby sighed and nodded as his ears drooped. "Yes, Master Harry. They do. Is still traces of ritual."
By the time they got down to the floo room, Remus Lupin was pacing back and forth while snarling at the empty room. Harry studied him as he slowly approached the doorway with it's glowing wall holding Remus in.
Dobby popped Harry straight back to Remus and Amal who scolded him just as Mother seemed to be. Draco didn't truly hear it. The magic thrumming through the wards was too strong. Harry's delight was too loud.
They laid all six books out and went through them page by page. The books were short, only about thirty pages. There were eight blank pages at the front that the long-gone owners had used to record notes on the ceremonies, none of which made much sense though they seemed to be notes from different ceremonies spread over a long period of time.
"Yes, I do," Harry said very seriously. "I don't know how things were for you before. Maybe when you feel comfortable you can tell me. No rush. But. I'm so very thankful for you, Dobby. I have to say it. And do whatever I can to help you. I mean, um, a pillowcase? Really?"
Blood stains and chips where a heavy blade had smashed down through something living, ending its life.
"Swashlin," Silverclaw said with a similarly tight-lipped smile. "Thank you. They are, though my gold is not as free-flowing as it should be. Mr. Potter. I see you finally decided to answer my summons."
Draco supposed that it was a credit to Harry that he never gave up faith that Remus could be saved. It was horribly gut-wrenching to watch Harry stare at Mr. Swashlin or Grandfather Arcturus or Mother with those dark eyes so earnest and sad as they tried to explain that there simply was no way to remove the curses.
Amal snorted. "I always hated that. He treats everyone like they're little kids and the really sad part is, I'm pretty sure that he hates kids."
Draco sucked in a breath, wondering if it would ever get easier to say this, especially with Mother's breath hitching and her hand clamped down like a vice on his hand. "I'm sorry that we didn't get notice to you sooner, sir. My father died yesterday morning due to… well, complications from the last war. We spent the day dealing with the Ministry. There were. Hm. Artifacts that needed to be removed and the wards needed to be updated."
"It's dangerous," Amal said. He rubbed the back of his neck. "I know he's your friend, Harry, but you can't really trust him."
"They is seeing two young men, Master," Dobby said with an indignant little huff. "Dobby is very good at his job!"
"Well, sure there is," Harry said, confused that this was even a problem. "It's called money. I've got lots. They don't. I'll either pay them off or sue until they're ground into the dirt. Come on, now, don't be silly."
He hobbled towards the stairs, meeting Mother halfway with aurors on her heels who stared at Draco in a mixture of awe and horror. Draco flung himself into her arms. It would be okay. Everything would be okay now.
Croaker nodded slowly. "Now I understand why you called me, Moody. The boy needs to stay. The doors won't stay open without him here. Keep him safe while we work."
"Colonization," Harry said, nodding. "Yeah, duh. What we're dealing with is a human style of magic?"
They went through the floo together, hand in hand. Draco clung to Mother, not so much for his own sense of balance but for Mother whose breath caught and whose knees went weak for a moment as they emerged from the floo. The spells on the fireplace whisked away the soot that automatically covered one, leaving both Draco and Mother clean.
Harry shook his head and ran on down the stairs. If there was a bit of warmth blooming under his breastbone to be compared to his mother, well, only Draco needed to know that.
"Dumbledore shared a prophecy with them," Amal said. "James was… He was upset when he came to set up all the account protocols for them to go into hiding. Your mother just about scorched the paint off the walls with her cursing. She had a bit of a tongue on her when she was really angry."
Draco's heart all but stopped as he flipped to the next prayer. "Oh, my. That's… interesting. A prayer to break an enemy's power over you and all your allies."
"Well, maybe you should listen to them," Harry said. He huffed when Remus leveled one of those "seriously?" looks at him that grownups used when they didn't want to listen to a kid. "No, really. You keep getting the same advice from all sorts of different places. Me, Dobby, the werewolf packs. Why not listen to them?"
"We will be keeping him unconscious until we can transfer him to Gringotts," Grandpa Arcturus said finally. "The spells are so deep-set, Harry. He's been spelled and controlled since he was younger than you."
Then there'd been nothing to do but give the adults the prayer books, explain what they'd done and let Dobby put Harry to bed. Three hours later, Draco had finally just gotten up and announced that he was going to sleep since neither he nor Harry had gotten more than a couple hours of sleep overnight.
"That's obscene, Potter," Draco complained. "Why bother to put tea in if you're going to do that to it?"
"Yeah," Amal agreed. He downed his tea in three quick gulps and then flipped to a new piece of paper where he started making lists. "We'll need to see if you can claim your family magic. You can't take the title, of course. You're too young. That has to wait until you're sixteen. But you can get your heir's rings."
Both of them bolted to their feet as the cell door opened. Harry hadn't even heard the cursing stop. It must have tapered off sometime during the hug. Professor McGonagall emerged with Grandpa Arcturus, both of them scowling.
The hedges looked like solid black walls around Harry. They didn't look like hedges anymore. He almost reached out to brush his fingers across the hedge wall, but he was afraid it would be black obsidian the way it looked instead of a living hedge.
"Good," Draco said. "I need… I need them both to stay asleep, Ivy. Father until morning for sure, Mother probably that long. This. I need to act. And I can't let them interfere."
"Lady Magic," Draco prayed as his hand bled against the ward stone and the ancient wards under Malfoy Manor beat in time with his and Harry's hearts, "help us. Please help us. Grant us your aid that all might be saved, friends, allies, enemies. Help us save everyone!"
Food (he should have had three to five times as much as he was getting), sleep (same), exercise (less, a lot less, and no household chores), stress (wow, just wow).
"We'd need teams," Hermione murmured. "At least two teams, maybe three. I mean, where are we going to get a rival circle? And how do we get two sets of twin focals?"
Harry frowned at that before rolling out of bed and grabbing his dressing gown. "I'm one hundred percent never, ever letting Fawkes in here. I mean, if he's serving Dumbledore willingly which seems kinda weird now that we know who Dumbledore originally was."
"It tapered off after he took over Hogwarts," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Though how he could have done that, I don't know. He's never had any power over the Book of Souls."
"You're more than welcome to him, Potter," Draco said with every indication of sincerity. He shook his head and laughed, too. "Seriously. I've always found Dobby overwhelming. He's worth a huge amount, actually. Father would have been so furious that you stole him. Either way, what are the wards telling you?"
"That was before Lord Black sent a message asking us to visit," Draco said. "At 10:30. In… oh, fifteen minutes."
"Are you sure you want to give them this?" Amal asked quietly when Harry had him proofread the letter.
Harry huffed at her for the threat. Taking points when they were trying to save people. That was rude.
There was no way to tell how much distance each step covered. Harry couldn't tell if it was miles or inches. He couldn't feel the gravel under his feet. Breathing seemed to have stopped. Honestly, he wasn't sure his heart was still beating. Or maybe he was suspended between one second and the next.
"I think I'd like that." Harry smiled, well aware that his cheeks had gone vividly red. His face was so hot that he felt like he was radiating. Even his ears were hot.
"I need you to anchor me there," Draco said. He huffed and rubbed his head. "I'm suddenly very, very glad I had the chance to hold the Dark Lord in. It's making a lovely practice run for keeping Dumbledore out."
"We cut our way," Harry said, straightening his spine and, by necessity, Draco's too. "Right. Well, we've done worse. Let's get to it. We only have a few minutes."
"Is right," Dobby agreed with Harry. "Master Wolfy accepts his wolf and all will be good. Dobby goes and makes plenty of food. Master Wolfy will need it if he ever accepts himself and stops being so mean to himself. Even Dobby did not punish himself as bad when he was still a Malfoy elf as Master Wolfy."
Let him kill his father by goading Voldemort and thus trap Voldemort's soul in the Malfoy Manor wards.
"Oh, no, Master Harry," Dobby said. "Was not that. All the elves knew about it. No one was asking us though. Was the phoenix, Fawkes, plus fake Dumbles had weakened wards, much like did with Malfoy Manor. If had not had Fawkes and had not weakened wards, they would have been safe-safe."
"You are correct, Lord Malfoy," Silverclaw said. "Young Lord Potter-Black has already been to the bank for several important items he was lacking. Dobby is now his elf."
Moody scooped Draco up in his arms like a baby again, grinning at the way Draco squawked. "Takes less time this way, kid."
"Thank you," Draco said. He put a hand on Blue's shoulder, smiling at the way she beamed at him. "Be careful. I don't want any of you hurt. I doubt that Mother will stir, but we can't count on that."
She smiled and pulled Draco into a hug that he melted into. Draco couldn't remember the last time Mother had hugged him. He must have been less than five or six. After that, as his magic started to settle, Father had taken over Draco's "education".
Remus froze, staring at the door. His eyes didn't focus but he'd clearly heard them. Smelled? Harry wasn't sure. Either way, Grandpa Arcturus and Amal and Mrs. Malfoy wouldn't let either Draco or Harry get close to the doorway. Dobby and Ivy wouldn't let the grownups get closer to it, either.
She'd gone dramatically pale. The wrinkles on her face seemed twice as deep all of a sudden as she grabbed for the doorframe. Harry didn't reach out to her. Neither did Draco or Grandpa Arcturus. Both of them stared at Harry's ward spell in horror.
"Dobby, make sure that he can't get out," Harry ordered. "Grandpa Arcturus, I'd bet that you can handle him, even with the fact that you're still healing. I want to talk to him. You know, from the other side of the ward barrier around the floo room."
"No, you are not sending my almost bride against Dumbledore, Potter," Draco said over the sound of the men choking. Both Mother and Professor McGonagall snickered. "Her mother maybe, but not Pansy."
Grandfather Arcturus breathed a laugh and nodded without opening his eyes. "Yes. Thank you, boys. You should… go study something. Else. For now."
"I didn't think anyone had been given a soulbond in generations," Neville commented entirely too neutrally.
The wards told Draco when Mother woke properly. He felt her scream, heard her sobs. They told him that it was tears of joy, relief, not grief. He slowly worked his way to sitting up on the bed as Mother ran down to the floo with the box of floo powder that Quinn supplied. By the time the aurors arrived, Draco was back on his feet, if leaning on Ivy's shoulder.
"Sealed this place up," Amal said with a wave of his free hand, "went to their cottage in Godric's Hollow because it was the newest and least-known of the Potter properties, and then Dumbledore cast the Fidelias on it."
"Well, yes, but that's not a problem," Draco said. He waved away Harry's frown, very aware that the adults were staring at the two of them with amusement. "Did you steal Dobby? I know he's gone, but I wasn't sure if it was you or not."
Ivy huffed. "Master is too young to be scaring Ivy this way. You is supposed to wait until you is sixteen or seventeen before risking yous life in stupid ways. You is both going to bed. Ivy will tell the others, but you is getting scolded good because you deserves it!"
Professor McGonagall snapped her mouth shut, eyebrows going right up to her hairline and shoulders going tight with surprise. Good. Harry didn't need the distraction of grownups being stupid and not listening right now.
"Um, if there's ever been a tracking spell on this thing, I don't see any remnants of it," Harry said.
The thing looked old and battered, white roof dented in places and the baby blue sides of it looking like it'd gotten scratched up multiple times. Draco could just see several people inside of it as they whipped by a third time. The thing had to be absolutely screaming through the sky which was just the most bizarre thing.
Ivy rolled her eyes. "Ivy is just hoping he is getting some sleep. He is as bad as Master Harry, looks in every corner and asking questions non-stop. He is over-tired. Too excited to sleep. Will fall on his face, just see if he doesn't. Ivy will point and laugh and then she will put him to bed. He won't even notice."
"I can't… let anyone know… that I did this on purpose," Draco panted once the magic calmed to the point where he wasn't blazing with light anymore.
"I… doubt it," Amal said as he wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulders. He also took one of Harry's hands, squeezing firmly.
The way Draco paled and then looked away told Harry that no, he wasn't crazy for suspecting that Dumbledore wanted him to suffer. When Draco looked back at Harry, his face was blank, reserved, formal, despite the way magic swirled in his eyes and his lips pursed. If it had been Aunt Petunia, Harry would've gotten a severe scolding, a beating with a wooden spoon and then been sent to his cupboard without meals for a week.
"Okay, so, thinking out loud here," Harry said while not watching Mrs. Malfoy bury her face in her hands and Grandpa Arcturus put a hand on her shoulder with a devastated expression on his face. "Magic is way more alive than anyone admits. The blessing is supposed to keep you safe. It can't. It's created so that it can't, but it still tries. You're not quite a werewolf."
"I completely agree with him," Draco said. "Harry needs to sleep and eat and be tucked in nice and warm, too. Go on and tell him I'll get Mother and have her tuck him in if he doesn't go to bed instead of fretting."
"Please give these to Croaker," Harry said as he passed over the letters. "If you can, tell Sirius that we're all doing just fine. He should stay safe. Dumbledore isn't really Dumbledore, after all. He's Grindelwald pretending to be Dumbledore. So, you know, they all need to be ready for that. Either way, Draco and I are pretty sure that we're gonna have to go after him at Hogwarts. It's not going to be easy but if we can all work together, I do think it can be done. We'll need all the armed forces possible to distract him and attack him once we move against him. Soon. Ish. I think. We'll see."
Some instantly. Some slowly. Some with a jerk and surge. Some so softly that it was as gentle as a baby's sleeping breath flowing out.
Ah, there went Draco's temper. He'd never been good at keeping control when he was tired, hungry, or embarrassed. Or afraid. All of them at once? Draco was going to get himself arrested if he didn't rein it in.
To Draco's shock, Mother's jaw dropped open. She paled and then turned and grabbed some floo powder.
"No," Wolf said. Remus shook his head, eyes going back to nondescript brown. "No, we can't. That's part of the problem. We can't get at it because it bites at us every time we do."
Harry was right at Draco's side. They were pressed together from knee to shoulder, but the contact did nothing to reassure Draco's very unhappy nerves. If anything, Harry's presence seemed to make Draco feel worse.
He shook his head, closed his eyes, and then stilled. Even though Remus had so far refused to properly shift all the way into his Wolf, he didn't seem as upset as he had been before the blessing was removed. In fact, his magic, warm gold and brown, shimmered on his skin for a moment.
Let them assume he meant grief. Draco wouldn't mourn his father. There was nothing there to mourn. He might just throw a little party with the Elves once Mother went to sleep.
"Yes," Grandpa Arcturus said slowly. He nodded hesitantly at first and then decisively once he'd thought about it. "That seems accurate."
"Dobby… is not sure," Dobby said slowly. He cocked his head to the side, one ear standing up straight, the other drooping over his shoulder. "Master Harry had the bad man's soul shard in his scar. Dobby thinks that maybe the curses is looking for that."
A very strong one snapped into place around Father who still convulsed under the Dark Lord's torture. Not good. Very not good. The torture couldn't last too much longer, or Father might have a heart attack.
"They is old," Ivy said, mouth turned down in a dramatic frown. "They is being here for a long, long time. Longer than Ivy is alive."
Mother stared at the letter, mouth open, and then flung it back to him. She apparated away, up to her quarters where the wards told Draco that she yelled for Blue to help her get cleaned up and changed immediately. Draco picked up the letter, let Vern read it, and then laughed as Vern set to work potting the plants that Mother had been working with while muttering about rude demands upsetting the poor baby plants.
"You know not one single thing about wards, do you, Potter?" Draco said with a tired sigh and a little smile far too wry for his narrow face.
Amal snorted as he wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulders. They stopped on the landing just below the floor with all their bedrooms. The curving stairwell was beautiful, lit from overhead by a huge magical skylight that showed clouds drifting across the sky, and from the windows that pierced the walls ever few yards.
Draco raised his chin as Harry's eyes widened. Of course, he would hear that. The idiot Gryffindor would hear and do the most inconvenient things.
"Master Draco should be sleeping," Ivy said. She glowered at Draco as she passed him a mug full of warm milk with cinnamon. "Tomorrow is being coming soon. Master Draco needs to be strong for his soul mate."
Remus' golden wolf bit down on it and the magic shattered with another horrible screech as light exploded in the cell.
Draco didn't let himself pace. He so desperately wanted to. Harry was out there, by himself, doing a ritual prayer when he'd never even lit a candle to Lady Magic before. Who knew what could go wrong?
"The wards," Draco said. He shook his head slightly, as much as he could without dislodging Mother's hands. "They're warning me of the blessing Dumbledore used. Not violently but they do…"
The nausea eased a bit as Draco breathed slowly and deliberately. Harry breathed with him, slightly surprised by how much the little meditative trick helped calm him down. After a few rounds of slow breathing, Harry reached out of the cloak and touched the doorknob.
"Not that it really matters," Harry said. "Now that we know how many things have gone wrong, we need to do something about them. I need a safe place to live. I need allies who will actually help me instead of just doing whatever Dumbledore decides is good. I might need a new place to go to school. And I need to learn all kinds of things, all the stuff that Dumbledore decided I didn't need to know. Probably starting with why Voldemort thinks I'm his mortal enemy."
The instant Draco's fingers loosened, Harry frowned and gripped harder despite the strange, wrong, way the back of his hand flexed. Draco could see bones shifting there, feel them grinding against one another.
Draco shook his head. "That's… probably impossible. I wouldn't be surprised if Dumbledore already knew. About both of us. The question will be how he'll strike back at us to regain control."
Harry's eyes burned. He never stayed up this late. This early? Aunt Petunia always worked him so hard that he dropped to sleep the instant his head hit the pillow. He'd never in his entire life stayed up until the early hours of the morning.
Baby's screams. Animal screams. The screaming bleat of a sacrificed kid goat. The squeal of a dying piglet.
It would cost him the Malfoy patriarch's position. It might kill him. The wards were so very hostile to everything related to the Dark Lord now. Draco didn't care.
"Be careful," Draco whispered once they reached the nondescript little stairwell that led down into the dungeons where the ward room waited.
"No, it's the tent," Harry said, blushing. "I should have asked Dobby to set up beds for them or something. That's…"
The master bedroom was still dark, as it always was. Heavy ebony couches and armchairs with black leather in the sitting room competed with silver, slate grey, and black carpets. The curtains were heavy black velvet. All of them were drawn. Draco had never seen them open, not once. When he was tiny and Mother had brought him to see Lord Black, Draco had been too afraid to even touch the curtains. He was halfway convinced that there was solid stone on the other side of them, that the curtains were for fashion's sake, not to keep light from the windows out.
"I do," Draco said, glaring at her as she bristled even more. "And yes, we absolutely do know what happened, why and how. As we were the center of it."
This was why the labyrinth existed on the grounds. This land had been sacred, once upon a time. Long before modern magi build the Manor, this ground had been holy ground. Draco started as he realized that no Malfoy had ever touched these rune circles.
To Harry surprise, Neville went grim-faced. He looked much older, much fiercer as he squared his shoulders and shook his head. For a second, Neville looked like a seasoned warrior instead of the chubby-cheeked, buck-toothed kid he actually was.
She stopped. Her eyes went wide as she stared at Harry who started grinning. It took a moment longer before Remus gasped. Then Amal was on his feet, hurrying over to one of the bookshelves to pull of books that he tossed to Remus who started flipping through them urgently.
Gringotts was quiet. It looked like a lull between the afternoon rush and the dinner rush to Harry. He was grateful for it because they got to walk right up to the clerk who eyed Harry like he was a bug, curled a lip at Dobby who glared defiantly back at him and then nodded respectfully to Amal.
And Harry, who lay in front of Draco on a pile of rubble that had once, very recently, been a blood-soaked altar. It was desperately uncomfortable to sprawl across it but that hardly mattered, not when Harry lay so still, and Draco hurt so very much.
"We've been looking for a curse," Harry said. "Some strange, unknown curse that no one has ever heard of that doesn't act like a curse at all. What if it's not a curse? What if it's not even a spell at all, Draco?"
Stepping out of the floo into Malfoy Manor was like leaping from a hot sauna into a snowy bank. The magic felt so incredibly different from Potter Keep that Draco's breath caught for the force of it. He breathed carefully as Mother stepped through with Grandfather Arcturus on her heels, letting Mother clean the ash from his robes.
There was a silver tray with a cover on it sitting on top of Harry's trunk. The very first thing Dobby had done, a fierce scowl on his face, was to bring food for Harry to eat. He'd promised that Harry wouldn't go hungry again. Ever.
Draco sat very still as Healer Smethwyck ran diagnostic spells over him. He'd far rather that the spells were pointed at Mother. They'd made it through the night, barely. Mother had spent the evening as the Unspeakables worked to trap the Dark Lord's shade alternately weeping silently and sternly lecturing Moody about getting the job done more quickly so that it would lessen the strain on Draco.
Something else, something dim and distant, something that felt so very far away that it might as well be Australia but so close that it might be right under his fingertips quivered, too.
Besides, he didn't want to displace Mother, at least not until Mother said that she wanted something different.
He was quite aware that he was shaking with fury. He just wasn't sure how to stop being so angry that he wanted to go set his relatives, Draco's relatives, and Dumbledore on fire. Preferably from the inside out so that they couldn't stop it.
Aquila trilled, took the letters with her foot, and then nibbled Harry's hair before flaming away. That was that. Now all they had to do was eat, rest, and wait to see what Croaker and Dumbledore did. Harry blew out a breath and then shook his head.
"That was the first thing I noticed after Father started losing control of the family magic, Mother," Draco said. He most certainly was never, ever going to admit that he'd noticed it well before Father died. "Dobby has been claimed by someone else. Probably Potter. Father did send him to make trouble for Potter. I imagine Potter's done something ridiculous and Gryffindor-ish and stolen his bond right out of Father's hands."
"It's still going," Harry explained as he scrambled out of Draco's bed since that was where they'd ended up last night. "And Potter Keep has way better protections than Malfoy Manor. Well, the same protections but around a smaller space so they're super-duper thick and heavy. We'll be much safer there."
"Oh," Draco said, blinking as he looked out the ballroom windows. "Yes. That would be… nice. Vern does a very good job on the grounds. He'd probably be happy to have someone new admire his work."
Screams echoed around him. Mother's screams had come first, high and piercing. Then her sobs. He'd abandoned the library at that point, all but running down the great staircase to escape the sound of her pain and sorrow.
There was the blessing, small and warped and, yes, desperate. It sat in the heart of Draco's core struggling and hurting as badly as Dobby and Ivy and Vern and Yule and Blue all had before Father died. Actually, there was a lot of the same feeling to the blessing as there had been with the elves.
Harry wasn't sure what to say to get Remus to listen and try. It seemed so simple to him. Why did grownups have to make everything so complicated?
Sunshine leaked through the battered, stained curtains that covered Harry's window. He stretched and rubbed his eyes, wondering why he was so comfortable. Then Hedwig hooted quietly at him and Harry sat bolt upright on his bed.
"We need more information," Harry said as they reached the small dining room near the kitchens that Dobby had decreed as the family dining room. The formal dining room was a good eight times bigger and way more formal. This was more like Aunt Petunia's kitchen table, just without the kitchen around it.
Harry stared at Dobby, mouth open. A thousand different questions whirled in his mind, garbling anything that might come out his mouth until the shock, amazement and awe that his mother was that incredible resolved into one very big, very important question.
Harry crept across the hall to the bathroom, washing up as quickly and as quietly as possible. Even with Dobby's reassurances that he was safe, Harry didn't want to take chances. By the time he'd cleaned up, brushed his teeth, and attempted to wrangle his hair into something less than a rat's nest, Dobby had the bedroom stripped of everything that said Harry.
Except that Draco's bond to Harry echoed with the fear and love and pain that reverberated between Harry and Dobby. They were so very close to each other, so deeply bound to one another. Willingly. They had chosen one another. Where Draco and Harry were soul bonded by Lady Magic herself, Harry and Dobby had chosen one another.
"He's cursed everyone in Britain!" Harry exclaimed like the overly-dramatic Gryffindor that he was. "Why is he doing this? How? I mean, he's supposed to be a good guy. Everything Hermione and I read last year said that he did good stuff in the past."
Not the most eloquent way to put it but hey, Harry was just twelve. If he wanted eloquence, he'd have sent Draco. Harry just wouldn't tell Draco exactly what he said in the prayer invocation. It'd be fine.
Harry nodded as he bounced to his feet. "So your bed or my bed? Because seriously, it's way late. I'm normally in bed by nine and we're past that now."
"Silverclaw," Amal said with a tight-lipped smile and a short bow. "I hope your gold is flowing like rivers and your enemies lie dead in unmarked graves."
He pressed his head back into the pillow to dodge the flailing arm Harry whipped around as he came awake with a startled shout. Harry stared around his bedroom, clutching Draco's pajama shirt, blinked several times and then turned to stare at Ivy.
The blue phoenix trilled, low and thrumming like a cello string that had been plucked. She nodded once and then held one foot out. There was a small tube on her leg, about the length of Draco's hand. Draco caught Harry's arm, keeping him from striding right over to take it.
"What?" Harry squawked with as much horror and outrage as Draco felt. "You're too young! We're both too young!"
"Darling, we agreed that we were having a quiet day at home to recuperate today," Mother said with a little frown and a gentle smile that was so beautiful to see.
Grandpa Arcturus snorted. "Cooper kept me alive as much as your mother did, Draco. We really should pay more attention to them. Now. I'll see Professor McGonagall settled. You two need to go to bed. You're both exhausted. Don't deny it. We'll deal with all of this in the morning."
That didn't work with Harry being here, though. The instant they came back to Malfoy Manor, he'd had Ivy move his things into the connecting suites just up the hallway from his old rooms. The thought of not being able to get to Harry whenever he needed to had been unbearable.
"Master is so foolish!" Ivy exclaimed as she popped in next to him. "Mistress is sobbing she is so upset, and Master Arcturus will not stop cursing."
Healer Hippocrates Smethwyck was sternly grandfatherly, with white hair he kept above the collar line, faded blue eyes and a wit that could flay you alive even as he healed every hurt you'd ever had. Draco had been terrified of him as a baby, afraid of him as a young boy, and now as Lord Malfoy, found that he still found the old man horribly intimidating.
"Very sure, Master," Ivy replied. "Wards is needing Master Draco's blood. Master Lucius never added his blood. He was not being able to. His magic is being tainted so he is not welcomed by ward stone. Could not even enter room."
He was completely unprepared for the way everyone froze. They all turned to stared at Harry with a mixture of horror, thunderous frowns, and concern. Harry rolled his eyes at them.
"Harry may or may not have been trapped into a betrothal contract," Draco started only to wince as Cooper and Dobby both popped in to start patting Harry's face, knees, hands, and chest along with Ivy. "We're not sure his magical signature was gathered and added to it? If not, it's a matter for Amal and a lot of money. If it is, well…"
The quiver from the other end was like watching Father torture a pygmy puff, all agitated jerks and the sensation of pain that wasn't Draco's. He focused on the bond-rope and directed all his soothing thoughts through it.
Darkness snarled like a werewolf shifting and whirling to attack. A lurking blotch in the center of a pool of shimmering wild magic rose up and roared as loudly as any dragon might. It wasn't a dragon. Draco shuddered. He didn't know what it was.
"Right, so magical communion with your core and your magic," Amal said as he flopped into one of the chairs close to the fireplace, "find the thing and then be nice as can be while you tell it that it did good and it's done working because everything is better."
Neither did Draco, despite the little prayers that Mother had taught him. This was so much more than the candle ritual, so much more than lighting the Yule log or midsummer rites.
Draco rolled his head to stare at Harry with a snide little smile. "It's like you lived in my house."
Ivy snorted. "Master Draco is not usually stupid. Of course is bond. Bond always was. You is made for Master Harry and he is made for you. Is only that you notices it for the first time. Ivy is angry at old Master Lucius. She would hit him if she could, she really would!"
After Silverclaw left, Harry and Amal had made Grandpa Arcturus go lie down and take a nap in the suite right next door to Harry's suite. The Master suite which meant that his bedroom was the size of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's entire ground floor, plus a little bit of the yard outside. It was enormous with a humongous bed that Harry could have had a slumber party on and invited most of his fellow second year Gryffindors.
If anyone had the capacity to think creatively enough to get around a locked, warded door so that they could attack Dumbledore in his lair, Harry and Dobby were the ones to do it. Just look at how they'd gotten into Hogwarts.
He took a hesitant step closer to Harry, holding the letters out, and then skittered away again as if expecting a lunge. It was logical to try and grab them. To go for a wand, which Harry didn't have, to get them back.
Dobby had promised that no one but Harry would be able to see his trunk or anything on it anymore. His trunk was invisible. Any food hidden under the silver cover gave off no smells, too, which meant…
Ivy popped in. She patted Draco's hand and then gently nudged him towards Father. Draco swallowed down the acid curdling up the back of his throat. Father smelled of vomit and alcohol mixed with stale sweat. His wand arm twitched as Draco approached.
It still took Harry a good thirty seconds of pep-talking to get his feet to move. He was really glad he hadn't eaten since their early dinner. If he'd had anything in his stomach right now, he might've thrown up.
"Okay." Harry bit his lip and cautiously approached the stone. When he barely touched the stone with his fingertips, magic shimmered over its surface. "Right. Sorry. Nervous. This is my first time doing anything like this. Bear with me as I figure this out, okay?"
"He doesn't want to be free," Draco whispered as he shoved the grand parlor door open and then shut it quietly, carefully.  He'd never said it out loud before.
As warm as a mother who screamed for her sons, restrained at the edge of a ritual circle overgrown with moss and flowers and grass and weeds.
"I wouldn't actually recommend that," Remus said as he took one of the books Mrs. Malfoy offered. "Yes, it can be done but that's what Charlus did and Death Eaters got through Potter Keep's wards. That's how he and his wife Dorea died. We can't risk that, especially since we don't have anywhere else to go."
"He was cursed there, wasn't he?" Harry asked as a twin surge of fury and sorrow surged up inside of him. "He was cursed in his own home."
"What is it with you and birds, Potter?" Draco huffed. "That owl of yours is just as bad about grooming you."
More than likely, Draco should go out and make sure that Mother was all right. He should definitely talk to Grandfather Arcturus about how the Malfoy family would fit into the larger Black family, now. There were a dozen things that he needed to do back home at Malfoy Manor. Just the audit of their finances would probably take a full day's effort when Silverclaw was ready for him.
The instant Draco set his head on Harry's shoulder, wrapped his arms around Harry's waist while Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, he felt better.
"Ivy," Draco whispered even as he and Harry laughed because Dobby had popped straight to Harry's side once the spell collapsed. "Fake Dumbledore isn't gone. He's still there. Still in Hogwarts. It worked. But he's there."
"Dumbledore wouldn't want you to learn anything that might let you escape from his control," Draco said slowly, frowning at the book in Grandpa Arcturus' hand even though his eyes were so unfocused that he couldn't be seeing it. "Because he wants you to die for his cause, whatever that is."
"Money," Draco replied. "It's not cheap. The Weasleys are an old family but they're poor. Painfully poor. I'll have to do something about that. Father was systematically ruining them. Every chance he got to destroy Arthur's prospects, wages or increase his taxes, he took. I probably owe them a life debt now."
The tides of electric blue shifted into a tsunami that roared straight at Draco. He opened himself to it, opened himself to the wards and the Elves and everything that truly mattered. His family. His mother.
Draco/Harry/Fred/George watched, only watched because they had to hold the prayer, hold their plea to Lady Magic no matter what, as Professor McGonagall rose up on her knees and threw a cutting curse straight at Dumbledore's back.
Sending waves of that meditation exercise down the bond to Harry quickly soothed the bond-rope until it wasn't quivering. Instead, it pulsed in time with Draco's heartbeat which had gone slow and languid as his arms and legs became weighted with sleep.
Several bodies lying on the grass near the Whomping Willow. One had greying red hair. Another had Grandpa Arcturus' white streaked hair. And a third was shaking his head as he struggled to get to his feet, snarling, even as the magic rained lightning down on him.
"Okay, so, see here?" Harry said, pointing out the right spot to Professor McGonagall. "This says who you are. And it says what spells you've got going. Right now, there's a whole slew of them, like, close to a dozen? No, eleven of them. There are eleven control spells on you affecting who knows what. My eyes are tired. It's late."
Draco shuddered as the wards' magic lanced straight through him. Electric blue lightning bolts arced away from him, striking the walls, and lighting up rune circles that lay dormant in the stone walls. They bloomed, the electric blue light flaring brighter and brighter as more and more of the circles activated.
"Such interesting timing," Grandpa Arcturus said with a scowl that could've stripped the paint off the walls if they'd had any paint. As it was, Harry was kind of worried that Grandpa Arcturus was going to set fire to the wood paneling any second now.
"Dobby will be telling him," Dobby said. "But Master Draco must sleeps, too. You cannot be helping tomorrow if you do not."
Good. The sooner they could leave, the better off they'd be. Harry could feel the dark, angry energy that Dumbledore used to attack the war wards. It was so strong, so mean, that Harry urgently didn't want to be anywhere near it. Like, he'd rather be on the other side of the planet instead of just a half-mile or so away from Dumbledore.
After all, weren't they supposed to handle mysterious magical things in the Department of Mysteries? It was their title. That just seemed like logic.
"All we have to do is focus on the prayer," Harry murmured more to remind Draco than himself, but he needed a bit of reassurance, too. "Pray to Magic to let us bring light to the heart of darkness."
Both Ron and Hermione had opened their mouths to protest. They snapped their mouths shut as Grandfather Arcturus moved to stand behind Draco and Harry. To Draco's surprise, Bill and Charlie collared Hermione and Ron, dragging them towards the door.
"Oh good," Harry said, rubbing his ears. "Thank you very much for checking, Ivy, Dobby, Cooper. Can you guys bring food? And tea, too. Oh, and I think Hermione needs a nice warm blanket. She was kind of in shock."
"So," Harry said as he leaned against Draco and cradled his mug of hot chocolate, "from what everyone can tell so far, there's a base behavioral modification spell that makes everyone very susceptible to what Dumbledore wants. It doesn't really tell them to do anything. They just look at him and think he's all amazing and wonderful and wise and all that."
"If you take the Honeydukes entrance," Remus said, tracing it on the map and smiling as various warnings about dangers appeared on its surface, including one that flashed red about the Hogwarts wards being set to dangerously high levels, "you'll be deep enough that the wards won't immediately kill you. I could take the Shrieking Shack entrance. I don't think anyone else could. Perhaps you could, Minerva, but I don't trust that he wouldn't have set the wards to recognize you."
"I'm afraid she can't do that," Draco said and then winced as Lord Black and Harry both glared at him. "She doesn't control the wards. I do."
Harry didn't need to turn to look at Draco to know that he was utterly scandalized by the thought of any of the Old Faith being "quaint" or "pointless". The bond all but shouted it. Harry could see Hermione's point. She, like him, had been raised more or less as an atheist. She didn't know the first thing about religion and didn't see how it applied to everyday life.
Draco wheezed and silently blessed the house elf ability to instinctively know what not to do. If she'd flung herself at his chest and hit his hands, Draco might have vomited all over everyone. He made soothing noises as Ivy wailed, but all his comforting noises did no good whatsoever. When he tried to sit up, Ivy shoved him right back down again and wailed harder.
His invisibility cloak billowed around Harry as he slipped into Honeydukes with an indulgent mother with a little girl who bore a disturbing resemblance to Dudley about to pitch a fit. The girl immediately ran off to start grabbing candy just like Dudley would have.
Dobby preened, tugging at the too-large ruffles over his shoulders and making them stand up even more. "Dobby needed a good apron. Cannot be using something old and ugly for first meal in Master Harry's new castle."
"We know how to remove it now," Draco replied calmly even though his whole body flinched at the comment. "I should let the wards know that there might be a residue on Grandfather when he returns."
"Mr. Potter!" Professor McGonagall huffed, her eyes flashing with her magic. "Headmaster Dumbledore is the leader of the light! Mind your words."
"As I understand it," Amal said, letting the books fly back up to their spots on the shelves, "your father gave Dumbledore access to the library before he died."
"You know, I haven't been outside since we went up on the battlements," Harry commented. "Maybe we can go out in your gardens or something?"
Ivy nodded, firmly. Hopefully, her ears coming up and a tiny smile curling the corners of her mouth.
"Why write to him?" Draco asked quietly. He'd decided to read a book on the history of the worship of Lady Magic, which was quite logical of him. That was beyond Harry's understanding, too.
Harry had fallen asleep instantly. Grandfather Arcturus had been the one to send messages to the Department of Mysteries. He'd sent a message to Gringotts as well, not that anyone could send a message back with Harry asleep.
Draco made a noise, high in his throat, as he pulled at the weak spots in Ivy's bond. It unraveled, the magic spinning away like silver cobwebs which was just so very wrong. The bond's threads should be red like blood.
Draco saw the wards that his ancestors had put on Malfoy Manor. They covered the land and the house and the people, the books and the peacocks who stopped their strutting around the gardens as the wards shifted and moved. The peacocks screamed, wings and tails spread, as the wards accepted Draco.
He slipped silently down the stairs, leaving Harry to sneak to the side doorway that they'd used to head upstairs earlier. Thankfully, lumos under the cloak still worked to light Harry's steps. Vern did an awesome job on the lawn because Harry didn't step in any mole holes or trip on any lumpy spots as he made his way to the labyrinth.
"What we need to know," Harry said, grinning and letting the elves do just what they felt was necessary even though Hermione's eyes had gone as wide as saucers, "is if my magical signature has changed since the blessing is gone. If so, then whatever is on the contract won't match me anymore and it's all good."
Grandpa Arcturus sighed and stood. "I'll go to the Ministry. It has to be Grindelwald. There's really no other choice."
"The key is gentleness," Draco said. He opened one eye and found every adult staring at the two of them. "It is. Gentle encouragement, gently telling the blessing that it's done well, that it can let go. That you're safe and free and happy, just as it was supposed to make you. That's what made mine let go."
Draco pulled up and away, leaning on his elbow to stare at Harry who blinked up at him. "You say no."
"Very overblown," Draco agreed. "Do sleep well, Professor. We'll see you in the morning. Late morning."
They all froze as people started moving around downstairs. Uncle Vernon started talking loudly about drills while Aunt Petunia chattered about her garden. As if she did any of the work to keep the garden up.
"That's a Ford Anglia," Harry replied as if that would make sense of the car whipping around outside of the wards.
He'd been sent to live with Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon because of Dumbledore. That was his fault. The whole no vaccinations and medical care was Dumbledore, too. So was Harry not knowing about being from an Ancient and Noble family, or that he was heir to two lines. Well, four, really.
Father lay sprawled on his bed. His hair straggled across the comforter like spiderwebs. When he was awake, his cheeks were pale but there was a sort of blush to them as he responded to the world. Now his skin was so pale that Draco could see the blue of his veins under the skin. There were bags under his eyes and his stubble had grown to the point that it looked as though he was halfway through growing a beard.
Harry sighed. "You can't. No one can. Look around. This is all I'll ever have. I can't escape. You saw me today. You've seen it for a while now, I guess. I'm a slave and that's all I'll ever be."
Her words nearly got lost in the next impact on the wards. Grandpa Arcturus flung the floo powder in and then scooped Harry up before Harry could protest.
Grandfather Arcturus grimaced. "I hate that you're making so much sense. I don't want you boys in danger."
Harry grinned and laughed even though the bags under his eyes had bags. Across the kitchen, Dobby snickered as he scrambled eggs, fried bacon, made a hash full of potatoes, peppers, sausage and more onion than anyone could tolerate. And garlic. So much garlic.
He eased the door open, watching for a spell or an attack. Nothing came. To his surprise, the room on the other side of the door was a library of sorts. It was built kind of like an auditorium, one built in the round. There were bookshelves all along the walls of the room, then four levels that stepped down into a central area with what looked like an altar, a potions setup and something that, even at twenty or so feet of distance, looked like a butcher's table covered with drying blood.
"Dobby wants to help the Great Harry Potter," Dobby said. "But Dobby must serve. He must. To not serve is Bad. To go crazy and die. Dobby does not want to be Bad."
"So," Harry said, staring at the wards while being deeply grateful that they'd upgraded the wards already, "is there a way to let him through and then seal the floo again? And, you know, to keep him from leaving the floo room?"
"He tortured my father to death and then got caught in the wards when the Malfoy magic chose me over sustaining Father's life," Draco explained. "The Ministry has the Dark Lord's shade and one of his soul anchors."
"Easily that," Professor McGonagall agreed. "The last record I found of it being used was over two hundred and fifty years ago. It's likely sadly degraded. The next closest ritual circle is over a hundred miles away. It has to be the ward room."
Please. Please let me save Mother. Please let me save the Elves, the Manor. We can't let the Dark Lord control the Malfoy family!
He stepped forward and put his hands on the ward stone before bowing his head. Draco pushed his magic into the ward stone, feeling for the wards. There was a key to them. Father had said many times that a proper ward complex had a key to them. He'd never allowed Draco to learn what that key might be.
He then flung himself across the seat into Fred's arms while Charlie and Bill grabbed the two of them and hauled like their lives all depended on it. An instant later, Draco screamed along with Harry and Neville as the Ford Anglia disappeared entirely, leaving George dangling from his twin's arms. The three brothers got George over the battlements where he sat laughing and shaking as Percy whispered curses and prayers that Draco would never have thought would fall from the prissy prefect's lips.
Someone, Harry had no idea who, had hidden an entire library's worth of books in Malfoy Manor. Stacks upon stacks upon stacks of them, all about prayers and blessings and the Old Ways that magi used to follow back before Dumbledore's day. Way before his day, actually, because from the dates on these books they'd fallen out of favor about fifty years or so before Dumbledore became Headmaster.
Ivy leveled a stern glare at Dobby who pouted. "Ivy is staying. Dobby is going. We is agreeing on this already. No take-backs!"
He shut the door to the ward room and then gently asked Ivy and Dobby and Cooper if they would guard the door while he and Harry worked.
"What's wrong, Grandpa?" Harry asked even though Draco absolutely wasn't sure it was a good idea to disrupt Grandfather Arcturus' concentration right then.
That thrum, that heartbeat of magic that had filled them in their sleep and carried them through the night was gone.
As Silverclaw sent messages to have every single heir ring that Harry was due brought in, Amal babbled about how to get ahold of Arcturus Black as he scribbled notes on his list in the file. Harry sat back in his chair and waited. If there was a better way to get an ally than saving their life, Harry didn't know it.
He carefully eased Draco down so that his head was in Harry's lap. Easier on Harry's arm which was going numb and definitely better for Draco's neck which Harry could tell was going to have a heck of a kink if something wasn't done. Harry was astonished that he managed to transfer Draco without waking him up but then Harry'd been flattened when he freed himself, so it made sense. It wasn't like Draco had been sleeping all that well, anyway.
"All the cabinet drawers are full of stuff!" Harry exclaimed. "I mean, your stuff, not my stuff. Dobby's got all my stuff in a trunk that's got a full apartment in it. I didn't even know they made trunks like that, but apparently it was in the Potter vaults. When I said I needed a trunk to carry everything, Dobby went and got it. It's cool but it's not as cool as these things."
His voice came out hard, cold, angry. Draco's head whipped around to stare at Dobby. Ivy stopped wailing, peeking up at Dobby with tears running down her cheeks.
Dobby stopped, staring at Harry. His head went to the left until it was almost upside down. Then to the right. And then he popped right up next to Harry to pat at his chest while making excited noises that made no sense at all.
"Yes," Draco agreed slowly while glaring at Moody. "I know. That's why I've been trying to get you people to come to Father's office with me. How many times do you have to ask how Father died? He was tortured to death by the Dark Lord. His core fractured and his heart stopped. Everyone's agreed on that. All your spells show that. Mother agrees. I agree. You agree. Can we please go take care of those artifacts now that we all agree?"
"Damn it," Remus huffed. He plopped back in his chair, pouting as he refused to meet everyone's eyes.
Grandfather Arcturus sat on the armchair in the floo room. Shaking. His eyes were shut. His breathing was steady, calm and slow.
This time when Draco controlled his breathing, it wasn't to try and force sleep. That wasn't going to work, no matter what time of night it was. Instead, Draco worked on sending as peaceful and supportive thoughts as possible through his bonds.
He would've laughed at the way Amal's jaw dropped and the way Silverclaw stared at Dobby, claws poised over the desktop as if he'd been frozen, but no.
"I haven't seen him that happy in, oh, at least fifty years," Arcturus said, shaking his head. "Well. Let's go and then I expect a very lengthy explanation of everything that's happened."
"I do not believe that he could be one of the Dark Lord's agents," Mrs. Malfoy said equally seriously. She rubbed her hands together, staring at her fingertips as they shifted even, past each other, even again, past again. "The Department of Mysteries was quite clear that they had located the vast majority of his soul anchors. There wasn't enough of his soul left to effectively control a magi of Dumbledore's strength."
Harry nodded and offered a hand to Draco only to flinch as Professor McGonagall gasped as if it was the most horrible thing she'd ever seen. She winced when Harry shook a finger at her, much to Grandpa Arcturus' amusement. Draco waited until Professor McGonagall nodded an apology before taking Harry's hand.
Where there had been narrow paths between the piles of junk, wandering randomly around the fluted support columns, now there was a straight path to an open area that looked so very much like the heart of the Malfoy labyrinth that his heart beat faster, and his stomach churned with nerves.
"Okay, good point," Harry said. "So Vern goes, tells Professor McGonagall that Remus has been horribly cursed, that the curses are anchoring on his lycanthropy and the only way to save him is to transfigure him into something inanimate until the curses can be removed."
He really needed to redecorate. Or, more accurately, he needed to give Mother and Blue permission to go raid the vaults for all the furniture that Father had tossed out in his effort to seem richer, more powerful, and more cultured than anyone else. And then to change the paint color, replace the carpets and drapes, and generally make the Manor a home instead of a set piece for intimidation.
"Trust your wolf," Draco said as he hauled himself upright and tried not to fall forward on his face in exhaustion. "Your wolf wants to be free. If you convince the wolf that the blessing is trying to help and protect you, but doing it really badly like a pup, that might help."
"Oh, I know that," Harry said with a wave of his hand. "I figured that out ages ago, this morning, really. There's no way I can trust him or Hermione anymore. Which is irrelevant. Sending the letter will make Dumbledore think that I want to keep Ron as my friend. He'll like that. He was very invested in our friendship last year."
"I'll gladly take any good news right now," Arcturus said without moving. "Including that I'll live."
Draco grimaced. "Werewolves can, in fact, survive almost anything which doesn't immediately decapitate them. The part I find appalling is that Dumbledore was willing to sacrifice an ally on a suicide mission."
There was no humility in Harry's prayer. There was only trust and love and joy. So strong, so beautiful. Draco could never be that way.
He was standing at the door to the library, arms crossed over his chest and a weird little smile quirking one corner of his mouth up. The wrinkles between his eyebrows didn't look amused, though. More than anything, Grandpa Arcturus looked like he was half a second from hugging them both to pieces because he'd been terrified a moment before.
To both Grandpa Arcturus and Professor McGonagall's amusement, Draco rolled his eyes and hauled Harry off up the stairs by his hand. Given that he was taller than Harry and stronger, Harry didn't have a chance to protest it.
"Grandfather," Mother said in a soft-pitched voice as if she was afraid that he was asleep. "We're here."
Remus opened his mouth, frowning, and then slowly shut it again. He nodded once before standing and looking to Harry who grinned.
"I don't know," Draco said thoughtfully. "We'll look it up later. It's certainly easier to figure out that the whole prayer or blessing thing."
"Dobby made them think that Master Harry is not here," Dobby explained with a little shrug. "They is horrible people, Master Harry. All three of them. Dobby has found Master Harry's parent's seneschal. If Master Harry goes to him, he should helps. Is part of oaths he took to Master Harry's parents"
The fire in the floo billowed up and outwards, sending Grandpa Arcturus scrambling backwards with a shout that Harry utterly ignored. Professor McGonagall threw up a shield. Remus shouted to Harry to get away but that was stupid.
His magic was a rich warm red with hints of gold. It played over his skin, just barely visible in the darkness of the parlor. To Draco, there was a hint of cinnamon in the air, perhaps a touch of cumin on his tongue. The room certainly seemed far warmer than it had a moment before.
To Draco's surprise, Bill and Charlie exchanged surprised looks of comprehension. The twins, even more stunningly, started and turned to each other with awed grins. Huh. Apparently, most of the Weasley family had freed themselves.
"Huh," Harry grunted, completely certain that this was more Wolf than it was Remus. "Can you stalk it? Chase it? Trap it in a corner and then let Remus grab it?"
Draco blushed but when he turned back to Harry, Harry did look like he wasn't hurting so badly. The scar wasn't open at all. It looked bruised more than anything, not like it had been cut open again when the soul anchor was removed.
Inside, Father's office was dark other than the blazing light of the wards that Draco held around the journal, glory hands and grimoires. The runes of the ward circles slowly rotated around each object. Even with the wards, the aura inside Father's office was bleak, oppressive. It smelled like death even though Father had died up on the third floor.
"Always a good idea," Grandfather Arcturus said. "Make sure to bring your elf with you, lad. It's never wise to bring an outsider in for a communion but I don't want you to be there alone."
"That's a very good point, darling," Mrs. Malfoy said. "We should be working on that. Though I don't know that it would be wise for us to leave until Malfoy Manor is properly secure."
The sheer idea that you could fly so quickly through a ward that had been attenuated by passing through the earth wasn't something that Draco would have considered. He'd expected that they would fly cautiously until they reached the edge of the wards, test them, and cross if possible. Flying straight through at full speed?
Harry reached out to touch it only to freeze as Dobby and Ivy popped in. He could hear footsteps pounding up the hallway. Draco frowned, then blushed as Mrs. Malfoy burst into the library with a wild expression in her eyes. Amal was right on her heels, looking just as alarmed. It took another few seconds for Grandpa Arcturus to run in, panting.
"Uh, figure out where you lot are going to sleep?" Harry said. His laugh was more rueful but just as shaky. "We're kind of out of spare bedrooms unless you want to sleep in the dungeons."
Nothing like family magic that felt like being wrapped in a big soft blanket and hugged until he wheezed. Or like family rings that resized automatically and merged together so that Harry had just one family ring with a crest that matched the one Dobby sported.
He shut his eyes, bowed his head, and went totally still. Draco held his breath as he waited for Harry to ask Dobby whatever it was. Probably a simple question about what Dobby thought might work. Draco was tempted to do the same with Ivy but frankly, Dobby was worlds more creative than Ivy would ever be.
Harry nodded, dark eyes going so sad that Draco wanted to hug him. "I know. I do know. I think this is the last chance we have to save him. We have to try. I just… I can't let Dumbledore win on this."
"We got the immediate curses off," Grandpa Arcturus said as he tugged Harry into a hug that was almost as good as the one with Draco.
"She… she never believed me or tried to help me," Harry admitted when Draco frowned at him. "So much stuff happened last year, and she just never, ever listened to me. I asked for help. Like, a dozen times. She ignored me. She ignored Hermione and Ron. It was…"
The animal sound of his agony was worse than even Mother's cries of fear. There was nothing human in those bellows, no language in his babbling, his begging, his occasional wails as the Dark Lord tormented him.
"You're not going to listen to me," Harry said with a shrug, "so I figure you need Professor McGonagall to tell you that you're wrong."
If anything, his magic seemed to be at war with the curses and his own lycanthropy. Any time he started to shift, his magic revolted, shoving him back into human shape. It looked like agony. Remus shuddered and screamed in his sleep whenever it happened.
"What is it?" Draco asked with a tired sigh that Harry felt all the way down to his toes. Not just because of the bond, but because Harry was as tired of this whole stupid Dumbledore mess as Draco was.
"Dobby, if the phoenix does something like try to grab me or Draco, I want you to go straight to the goblins," Harry explained. "Take Amal with you. He's got all the authority to act with everything I have as a Potter and as a Black. He's the Seneschal. He can go to the ICW and get so much help. Don't let anyone grab him or hurt him or spell him or anything that might compromise him."
"It's not cheating," Draco said with his best Slytherin smirk. "It's using the proper tool to the job."
Draco focused on the quiver as he let his eyes drift open slowly. A blue-green shimmering rope rose up off of Draco. It came from everywhere on him, yet nowhere. He didn't see a cord diving into his belly the way he would if he'd astral projected. That had happened once during one of Father's beatings. This was different.
"Ah, yes," Draco said, blushing for no reason he could figure out. "But. Well. At the end when I opened my eyes, I saw a woman over the ward stone."
Harry huffed and shook his head. "I really don't like Dumbledore anymore. Not at all. Go on and finish dessert, Dobby. We should go get Grandpa Arcturus up, anyway."
"People really need to pay more attention to the elves," Harry complained. "I mean, really? Lilac knew something was wrong. Dobby did, too. All I had to do was work with him and poof, a zillion problems started getting solved."
Claim what he was due. That's what he was doing. It wasn't theft. The Dark Lord was trying to steal their magic and their money and their lives. Draco was taking back what he and Mother were both due.
As much as Draco didn't want Harry to take whatever message it was, Harry clearly didn't want Draco to do it either. Their bond vibrated with their mutual reluctance to let the other one take the risk, at least until Professor McGonagall put her head around the corner of the stairwell to glower at them both impatiently.
Except that he was very, very glad that he didn't have to go somewhere else to get Voldemort out of his scar. Potter Keep felt like home. It felt more like home than anywhere else that he'd ever been. It was the home that he used to dream of having back when Uncle Vernon bellowed at him, punched him, and then locked him in the cupboard.
"This is your favorite couch, isn't it?" Draco asked as he settled onto the green velvet couch near the fireplace in the Potter Library.
"Breathe," Amal told Harry. "Come on, Harry. Breathe for me. Breathe for him. The stronger you are, the stronger the magic will be. Breathe. Count for me. Count to four. In for four, out for four."
"Oh, I get that," Harry countered as he started to pace along the parapet. "I really do. I just. What am I going to do, Draco? They're my only real friends."
Their bond slowly faded out of visibility. The strands formed a sort of plaid as it went, like it was braided of their magics' colors. Blues and greens mixed together so perfectly that Draco might have thought that their magic was merging into a teal. Perhaps it would over time. Perhaps not.
He stopped and frowned up at Grandfather Arcturus. The blessing was all that Grandfather Arcturus had on him. There was no other trace of Dumbledore's magic staining his magical core.
Harry pursed his lips before coming to the sofa and curling up against Draco's side in a heart-stopping gesture of affection that Draco was not at all prepared for. That didn't stop him from wrapping his arms right around Harry and holding him close. Nothing would have stopped that short of Father appearing and cursing Draco silly.
Draco nodded thoughtfully, rubbing the small of his back and stretching until something cracked so hard that it echoed in the quiet hallway.
He stared at her along with Healer Smethwyck whose frown somehow made Draco want to squirm with second-hand embarrassment for Mother's attempt to lie. She pursed her lips, folded her hands in her lap, and then raised her chin at Draco.
Both Remus and Amal blinked at Harry like they couldn't quite parse out the words he'd said because they were so far outside of the argument they'd been having. It took a moment before Remus to frown and cock his head to the side like a confused puppy.
"I'm so tired," Harry groaned as he collapsed onto the bench. "Wow. That was a lot of work. Didn't feel like it at the time. Um, can you fix my finger, Draco?"
Yeah, Dumbledore had definitely gotten to Remus. What Harry didn't know was what to do about that. He turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was just red-faced and huffing now, not swearing a blue streak.
Draco could feel so much more of what the Goblins had done. There were wards and watching spells, monitors and message systems. Each vault door had a specific identity to it, one that Draco could see but not understand. Silverclaw's vault door, once they reached it after going through a maze of tunnels, stairs, and other vault doors, felt like it might just bite Draco.
Harry snickered. "Nah, mostly on my back or side. I'll be fine. I do want to go collapse somewhere. And wash my face."
"He's distracted," Draco hissed. "Come on. We have to hurry! Dumbledore is distracted attacking them with the wards."
"I will gladly teach you, Harry," Mother offered with a vicious smile that made Harry snicker. "Goodness, everyone should learn that one."
"I believe it will," Draco said. "Professor McGonagall is a good woman. As long as Dumbledore hasn't already gotten to her, it should be fine."
"I'm going to go commune with the wards," Draco told him. "They're… well. I need to spend some time with them in their new configuration."
To Harry's surprise, Professor McGonagall fixed Remus with a gimlet glare that had him blushing violently while ducking his head. That was more than an idle wish. Remus had a way, or used to have a way maybe, of knowing who was where in Hogwarts.
Draco stared at her. Harry did, too. They looked at each other and then Harry sighed before waving all of them to follow him downstairs. Draco made a point of walking at Harry's side because he was damned if he'd let Ginny steal his place. Thankfully, Neville somehow managed to block Ginny who ended up with Bill's hand on her shoulder, keeping her from pushing Draco away. Or down the stairs, possibly. The glare was quite ferocious when Draco glanced back over his shoulder.
Remus blew out a breath, shaking his head. "That's not true, Harry. You have to go back. It's the only place that you'll be safe from Death Eaters and You-Know-Who."
Cooper sighed and nodded. "Is very hard to speak of it. Started in the night, actually, midnight exactly. We did not notice it at first. Dobby was the first this morning, early."
They grinned at each other as they held hands. The bond sang between them of excitement, anticipation, hope and fear, and so much determination that Harry couldn't figure out which of them was angrier about how he'd been treated.
"I… think so?" Harry said, humming. "Not sure. I mean, maybe? I didn't know anyone could run like that. I think that part was real."
"Eight minutes," Draco replied. His hand glowed brighter, so much so that his bones showed through the pale flesh.
Professor McGonagall shook her head and patted Draco on the head. "You'll understand when you're older, dear. Come on, now, both of you. Let's go talk to the others. Is there an offer of help? A bazooka to blow that rotten no-good bastard pretending to be Dumbledore to smithereens would be perfect."
"You said that there are secret passages and tunnels," Draco said to Fred and George. Will any of them get us underneath the Hogwarts wards? We will need some method to get in and that's likely the only thing that will do it."
Draco sucked in a breath, pushed all his fear down the same way he did when dealing with Father at his worst, and nodded. "You're right. We won't. Let's go. We need to get into place as quickly as we can."
Ivy blinked, eyes going extra wide as her ears went straight out. "That is very rare, Master Draco. Ivy is only hearing of it happening once. Dobby might know more of times it is happening. He is older and stronger than Ivy."
"Very good plan," Harry agreed. "Let's do it. It can't fail any harder than all the other things we've tried so far."
"Master should not be reading those!" Ivy popped in, snatching the book right out of Draco's hands. "Is not for young wizards! You is waiting until you is grown up for these."
While Professor McGonagall and Grandfather Arcturus questioned Cooper and Ivy in detail, everyone else listened with bated breath. Hermione and Remus both took notes of the entire discussion which was helpful. Draco was going to want to review those notes in detail once he had the space to breathe again.
"Well, he doesn't need to control the Book," Harry said. "He needs to keep people from touching magic like Draco and I did."
"There are ways in," Remus said thoughtfully before sighing and shaking his head. "The tunnels are extensive, as are the secret passages. The problem is knowing if anyone is waiting in them. If we could see what's in there, it would make planning this much easier."
Unsurprisingly, Ivy had his pajamas waiting for him. Draco yawned as he changed clothes, rubbed his eyes as he shoved his feet into slippers and then almost fell asleep on his feet as he wrapped his dressing gown around his waist.
His body shook under Harry's hand. Something was building between them. Tight and hard and desperate, the magic between them crackled quietly. So very quietly. Harry's panting and Dobby's chattering teeth were louder.
That didn't even cover the money that should have been coming to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. It didn't cover the tutors that should have been paid for by his trust fund. His Aunt and Uncle should have had a live-in nanny, probably human because Harry just couldn't see Uncle Vernon allowing a House Elf in his home, who would have taken care of both Harry and Dudley.
The snarl faded into the most puzzled frown that Harry had ever seen on anyone's face before. Harry grinned, then laughed as Draco glowered at him. When Harry shrugged, Draco rolled his eyes.
"Still working it out in my head," Harry admitted much to Draco and Professor McGonagall's amusement. "Okay, so the underlying spell. It's not a curse. It's not a charm. It's not a potion. It's not any sort of magic that any of you are used to. Dobby and Ivy and the other Elves can see it, but it doesn't feel like a threat to them, other than all the ways that it interacts with the other stuff Dumbledore does."
The ward circle around the journal was three layers deep and the innermost layer flickered like open flame as the soul shard trapped inside tried to battle its way out.
"Hundreds," Silverclaw said. His eyes were distant as he tapped his gleaming claws against the fireplace surround, without digging holes in the stone this time. "It depends on the traditions. The spells you find among the native people of North America are drastically different from those from the center of Africa or the Pacific Islands. Or from South America, for that matter. There are some common spells that everyone learns. Most everyone learns European-style magic."
"Oh, lovely," Draco said with a tired sigh. "I suppose I should have expected that. Please see to Mother. The wards simply will not stop screaming about her condition."
He flung the curtains open, letting sunlight flood into the sitting room. The man pretending to be Lord Black shook his head and then pushed the blanket off his legs. That man was fully dressed, if in casual slacks and a simple button-down shirt with no robe whatsoever. As soon as the bearskin was off him, his skin went warm brown and his hair turned into a black mop of curls that would've done Harry Potter proud.
Harry groaned and nearly fell to his knees. It was only Draco's arm around his shoulders that kept him on his feet. Two steps later, Harry held Draco up when his strength gave way. The shimmering white magic that beat in time with their hearts, with the twins' hearts, pulsed in their joined hands like a lighthouse seen from very far away.
"I'll pay half," Harry volunteered. He grinned when Draco frowned at him. "What? I don't want to share you with Pansy. She's snippy and arch and always has horrible things to say about me behind my back."
Not a ward. Definitely not. It was narrow and long, like a braided rope. Wards were created in circles, not ropes.
The carvings dug into his flesh, sharp-edged and painful as he pressed. Draco nearly pulled his head back so that he could slam his forehead against the carved grape leaves and wands.
Draco dragged himself out of bed, too, though he sighed as his feet sought out his slippers. He'd really wanted a couple of hours of sleep before anything else happened. Ah, well. He'd just have to get some very strong tea and endure until they could steal some time to themselves.
Professor McGonagall stood next to him; the next book clutched to her chest. She looked impatient, not worried, or afraid. Harry wasn't sure he'd ever seen Professor McGonagall look afraid, not even when the Weasley twins got up to one of their really horrendous pranks.
He studied what the wards were telling him and then cast ostende mihi so that Mother and Grandfather Arcturus could see it, too. Draco blew up the little notation that showed what spells were on each of them. Normally it was a minor matter that a patriarch would only pay attention to if the wards found something harmful.
"I'm halfway tempted to," Amal said, summoning law books and accounting books and history books off the higher shelves which all floated around him patiently. "This is amazing. Silverclaw said something about the audit pulling back all the entailed books that were taken elsewhere."
Just steady breathing, slow and deep. Just Remus tilting his head side to side a couple of times as if he were listening to something very far away. Harry bit his lip, reaching back to take Draco's hand even though he hadn't turned to see Draco offer it. He didn't need to. Draco's need to have his hand held was so clear that Harry did it before he consciously recognized the emotion coming from Draco.
"Ah, I should've known the two of you would come straight there," Grandfather Arcturus murmured. He opened his eyes and Draco flinched at the harsh silver light of his magic beaming out his eyes. "If I'd had a lick of sense, I'd have stayed at Black Manor until I had some control over myself."
"Oh, Ivy," Draco said. He held out his arms and Ivy popped straight into them. "It's not your fault. I'm sure that Dumbledore's done this deliberately. All the elves have made such a huge difference. We couldn't have done the ritual without your help and protection."
Harry snickered. "Yeah, I guess we will. Good thing all your plotting and planning got us here. We're just the lightning rod. Once we get to the right place, it'll be everyone else doing the hard work."
"Not necessary, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said as he claimed a spot by the fireplace, sitting on the hearth. "This is most acceptable."
The way Harry had been treated did seem to expand out to new people who should have no reason to treat him poorly. Actually, the way that Professor McGonagall had refused to help Harry last year wasn't quite so odd if you posited that there was a sort of curse that would affect other people's perceptions of you.
"Well, we call it a maze but it's really a traditional labyrinth," Draco explained. "The way Mother explained it was that you walk the path of the labyrinth while praying or meditating and it… brings you enlightenment. Or power. Or something. She'd never done it. I don't think anyone has walked the labyrinth since, oh, goodness, probably when my grandfather was very young."
Even this far away, Harry could feel the wards shuddering under Dumbledore's attack. It hurt. Not hurt-hurt like Uncle Vernon punching Harry but aching-hurt like a toothache or prodding an old bruise. Draco sent a tiny pulse of reassurance to Harry just as the fire in the floo flared right up the chimney.
Draco's original suite at the far end of the hallway had no connections to other suites. He'd always been glad of that while Father was alive. It had made it impossible for any of Father's less savory guests to get at Draco after he went to bed.
"We is taking care of our masters ourselves," Dobby snapped, glaring at Draco so fiercely that Draco instinctively held his hands up to ward the glare off.
"I'm… absolutely a werewolf?" Remus said, staring at Harry as if he'd just started frothing at the mouth.
Dumbledore didn't care if Harry lived as long as Harry did what Dumbledore wanted. So no, that soul anchor was going away. No, he was not going to be the desperate, scared, ignorant kid Dumbledore wanted. He wasn't going to be alone.
They were alive and free, now and forever. Everything else could wait now that they'd accomplished that one thing.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, I get that. Used to do that a lot when Aunt Petunia would send me to my cupboard without meals. It never quite worked, though."
"I know," Draco said, eyes shut. "Dumbledore put it on so many people. I've no idea what its supposed to do but he's perverted it terribly. We don't have a clue how to get rid of it. Or, perhaps, how to turn it to our own use."
Except that he might've punched Ron in the face and thrown Hermione off the battlements if she kept scoffing at him and implying that he was too stupid to know what he was talking about. So no, not a good idea.
Draco saw no need to reply to that given that it was blatantly obvious through their bond. It felt like Harry's emotions poured straight into him. He was rather horrified that his emotions had to be pouring into Harry, too.
They passed a window that looked out towards the Shrieking Shack just before the entered the second secret passageway.
Harry laughed quietly as Amal shouted and ran over to throw diagnostic spells at them. Professor McGonagall was right on his heels. Grandfather Arcturus had Fred in his arms while Mrs. Weasley had George half-draped over her despite Bill trying to get her to let him carry George.
"We need to know, Mother," Draco said. His eyes were grim, and his mouth had gone all pinched and narrow like he'd eaten an underripe lemon. "Dumbledore is the greatest threat we all face. Lupin is a chance to take one of his pawns. He's also a way to get more information. I think we need to do it."
"You'd pray," Harry said. He pointed at Mrs. Malfoy whose cheeks had started going redder and redder. "Is that a thing? I mean, I don't know much about religion. Aunt Petunia used to say that I'd burst into flame if I went into a church, but it didn't stop her from dragging me and Dudley to services at Christmas. But only then. They didn't do church most of the time."
"We found a way," Draco whispered to Mother when she picked him up. "Have Ivy show you the blue prayer book, Mother."
He bounced on the couch as excitement built for the first time in hours. Days, maybe. How long had it been since Harry stole Dobby? Draco had no clue. As tired as he was, he didn't know what time or day it was, not that it mattered.
He took a big swallow of his tea, shuddered and stared into the cup in horror. The second, wincing sip got a considering look and then he drank comfortably as his tongue was numb to it. That was how Father had always drunk it, but Draco just couldn't stomach that first gods-awful swallow. Sips worked better.
Just the questions he'd asked had told Harry how terrible his life had been. There were wizards and witches whose whole job was to make sure magi kids were safe and well cared for (and how come they hadn't been told at Hogwarts that the term for wizarding folk in general was magi?) There were magi pediatricians (and Harry should have seen at least a Muggle pediatrician every year, preferably a magi pediatrician twice a year). Harry should have gotten vaccinated for dragon pox before going to school (and he shouldn't have been allowed in school without it by law).
No, wait. It wasn't Harry that Draco needed to track. It was the magic Harry was going to raise. So that was fine. It was good. Everything would be fine. He was fine. Draco was fine. They'd both be just fine.
"Is part of Potter magics, Master," Dobby said so confidently that Harry relaxed a little bit. "You is helping yous great-grandfather. I is taking care of Keep. And you," he wagged a finger at Amal, "you is coming, too. Is not safe for yous to go home. Dobby will brings yous clothes and books and things. Bad Dumbles would hurt or curse you if he found you. Makes you do bad things to Master Harry."
The side door out of the ballroom to the wide back porch that ran the length of the ballroom was unlocked. Harry gasped once they stepped outside, running to the heavy stone railing that overlooked the gardens. His delight was such a relief after all the worry and fear.
The snap as Draco locked the wards down came at the same instant that he and Mrs. Malfoy flung themselves through the floo. Harry jerked, gritting his teeth, and refusing to let go of Draco, of the magic flowing through their bond, even as the waves of wild magic from the labyrinth abruptly cut off.
Draco blinked and then laughed quietly even though his stomach tied itself into a knot at Aunt Bellatrix's nickname. He was relatively certain he knew how she'd gotten it. She'd been insane most of her life, after all, and vicious all of it. The Black family elves had to have lived in terror of her.
"Why were you such a prat?" Harry asked. "I mean, you're fine now. We're sitting here and not at each other's throats at all."
Of everyone in Harry's life now that he was free, he trusted Dobby most of all. They'd saved each other. They'd made a choice and stolen each other from the respective hells that they'd been trapped in. Draco was second, especially as their magic and soulbond slowly drew them together.
"No," Dobby said. "Is the wand. All young wizard and witch wands have the Trace. They is not able to check anything else. Would not know that magic happens here unless Dobby tells them with his magic that it happened. If is quiet wish, just us, just here, just this, is safe. Master does not know. His blind to all but his Bad Master. Mistress may feel if she is not potioned. Little Master will not know but may dream of it. Ministry cannot feel Master Harry Potter's magic if no wand. They is able to tell Elf magic from wizard magic. Especially young wizard wish magic."
For those curious, no, my Harry Potter fics do not build on each other. They're stand-alone stories that cover what I have to say on each year. I plan (don't know if I'll actually do it) to do at least a couple more of these and those will be stand-alone fics, too.
"No, Master Harry," Dobby said. "Dobby would not. Is very good way to die. No Elf would ever steal goblin mail."
Ivy made a little squeaky noise that Draco ignored. He more than likely was breaking a dozen different protocols by actually speaking to the ward stone. Father had always said that one shouldn't treat magic as if it was alive and truly aware.
They hadn't gotten everyone. They couldn't. But so many were free already. The longer they held this, the more magi were freed. It was beautiful. So much love and joy and pure euphoria that it had worked.
It was such a foreign mindset that Draco could only stare and sigh and back Harry up over the last couple of days. Two very long, very full days that had included far too many experiments with the Potter ward stone, too many tiny cuts to Harry's hands, and too many failures.
Mother made a noise like a kitten sneezing. When Draco turned to stare up at her, there were tears in her eyes. She shook her head at him, a fond smile on her lips. It wasn't until they were heading up the grand staircase with its onyx treads and ebony risers and railing that Mother leaned down to whisper in his ear.
Draco couldn't harm himself. He wouldn't. There was too much torture in this house for Draco to inflict it on himself, much as he wanted to sometimes to make the internal pain visible for once.
That hardly bothered Harry who'd looked around the Blue suite with such delight that Draco had laughed as he opened the door connecting their suites.
Draco choked on a laugh while shaking his head at Harry's straight-forward approach to the problem. "While you're quite right that it will likely come down to money, there may be an issue if your magical signature has been assigned in the contract."
Both Grandfather Arcturus and Professor McGonagall went next. They settled in at the same time, began to commune with their magic at the same time, but Professor McGonagall removed the blessing in five minutes while Grandfather Arcturus took nearly fourteen minutes.
"Harry, I need you to breathe for me," Amal said right in Harry's ear. "Come on, deep breath. Suck a breath in for me, Harry, please!"
They all froze as one of the Honeydukes workers came into the back room upstairs. Thankfully, whoever it was just grabbed some candy and carried it back to the front where Harry could hear the girl-Dudley whining that she wanted that candy and that one and Mum, that one, too! Harry shuddered. Seriously, that was just nightmare fodder there.
It took no effort at all to get behind the counter and then into the back room where the twins said the entrance to the secret tunnel was. The cellar stairs were steep enough that Harry looked around and pulled his cloak off before hurrying down them. He'd trip and break his neck going down them with it on.
He was wearing an apron covered with tiny, embroidered strawberries connected by pale pink ribbons stitched down by hand. The ruffles were huge compared to Dobby's scrawny frame. On Aunt Petunia, they were perfectly perky and highly stylish. Or at least that's what Aunt Petunia would claim when she had a bridge party or when Uncle Vernon invited someone from work over to have dinner.
The battlements felt different this time. Not only because of the war wards but also because deep grey clouds had blocked out the sun. The loch looked dangerous far below. Wind whipped through the pine trees, stripping away needles as Draco watched. A storm was coming, rain slashing downwards off to the east. It wouldn't be long before it arrived to drench Potter Keep.
Silverclaw had a nose like a pickax, long silver hair pulled back into an old-fashioned queue, and claws that were in fact very long and covered with silver that had been engraved with tiny runes. The goblin that led them to Silverclaw stared at him with furtive desire that Silverclaw glowered at, flicking his fingers to send the goblin away as if his interest were profoundly insulting.
Draco panted and waved a hand at Mother when she shouted at him, some pointless question that he couldn't focus on even if he wanted to. The spell was hurting Harry. That, they couldn't hurt Harry. He'd been through too much already!
After another moment, Silverclaw was on his feet and heading for the note paper while Mrs. Malfoy start whispering prayers and Grandpa Arcturus cursed at the top of his lungs.
He was somewhat surprised that she hadn't already asked to move given everything that had happened to her in the master suite.
"Whatever you're doing right now," Harry said. "It's not helping. Clearly. I mean, obviously because the blessing hasn't let go. Did you remember the part about being nice and gentle and trying to encourage the blessing that it'd done its best?"
"Is different," Cooper said with a firm nod. "But the nasty contract was not made with magic. Has no link, ever, to you, Master Harry."
They coated the cloak. Danced over Harry's hands, tangled with his hair. When he passed the last bit of the first quarter of the labyrinth and began the long, curved bit that swooped around to the other side of the labyrinth, the sky overhead went sapphire and forest green. The stars there danced, moving along with the stars surrounding Harry, the stars under his feet.
"No one outside Mother interacts with Vern," Draco explained. "Professor McGonagall won't recognize him. His magic is all wild and green with only a small thread of the Malfoy magic going through him. It's buried deep enough that he'll be virtually unidentifiable. Dobby radiates your magic now."
Draco led them down the stairs at a near-run, even though Mrs. Malfoy spluttered and fretted about them both the whole way. He was way too focused to even notice that she was worried, so Harry caught her hand. She stumbled and stared down at Harry.
Harry could see the questions in all the Weasley's eyes, especially Ron's as he took another sandwich and started eating as fast as he possibly could. The twins didn't try to grab it this time. They both looked kind of ashamed of themselves which was good. As often as Dudley had done that to Harry, no way could he let it go on for Ron when it was so easy to speak up.
But Harry took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and then looked down that dark stairwell with determination.
"Sounds quite accurate to me," Draco said. "Hm. There's one here to bring the light of hope in to purify dark places. That… I wonder."
Dobby blinked at Harry and then shrugged. "If Master Harry said is needed. Is true. Master Wolfy has not accepted wolf. Needed to do that so that we can be taking the stupid blessing off. If accept wolf all the way, then is easy because wolf will help and no biting back and forth."
Mother's plan had failed. Her very last idea, her only remaining chance to free them all, was done for.
Who nodded when Harry turned his way, calm and sure and only a little bit pale. Like last night, the calm flowing through their bond washed through Harry, soothing his fears just as well as Draco's snippiness had.
His little snarl was just the right side of demanding and impatient to push Harry past the fear and the worry and all the anxiety that had been holding him back. Harry blew out the breath he'd been holding without realizing it and deliberately rolled his eyes at Draco.
"That's a blessing I'd like to have," Harry commented. His eyes had slid half-shut from the comfort of the wards wrapped around him. "Not like the stupid one Dumbledore put on me. That's just trouble waiting to happen. Is there a way to take control of the blessing back from him? I wonder."
Which, come to think of it, meant that they hadn't been truly before Dumbledore's day. They'd been current and normal and just the way things worked when Dumbledore was a kid. So this was all what Dumbledore grew up with.
"Oh!" Harry squeaked and slammed his book shut. His face was blazingly red as he gave it right back to Ivy who huffed and glowered at both of them. "Nope, not reading those. They're porn."
Draco just nodded. Their magic, the magic linking them back to Ivy and Dobby and the twins, dimmed a bit but Draco shut his eyes. His breath hissed through his nose because his lips were pressed together really tightly. Through the bond, Harry felt Draco reaching out to Ivy and the twins, accepting their magic, accepting their help even though he hated being weak, hated needing to show that weakness to others.
"Maybe Master should asks the goblins?" Ivy suggested. "Blue says Mistress is done with this round of healing. She be looking for Master Draco now."
"Certainly," Amal said. He blinked when Harry made the angry goose noises of dismay, turning to Dobby who stared back at him. "He doesn't know about his godfather? No, what am I saying? Of course, he doesn't know about his godfather. Right. Well, you're the Potter heir, obviously. But you're also the heir for the Black title. Sirius Black adopted you, with your parent's permission, when you were just a couple of days old. He'd taken a curse and couldn't father kids, so that was their way to make sure that the Black family magic wouldn't go to a cadet line when old Arcturus Black finally kicks off. I got invited to that. It was a really sweet little ceremony."
Mrs. Malfoy's hands flew to her mouth. She shuddered, shaking her head like she absolutely forbid them to even consider letting Remus in. Harry thought about it for a second and then nodded to Dobby before tapping the ward spell to let Remus in.
Not now. The kitchen was silent, no food being prepared, no voices, no movement at all. The dozen or so house elves huddled underneath the centermost workbench, hugging each other and shivering in terror. Even Father at his worst hadn't scared the Malfoy elves that badly.
That was a thing, then. Maybe Remus was the one person who couldn't get the blessing to let go. Which kind of made sense. Magic was very aware in a more than sort of alive way that none of the grown ups seemed willing or able to acknowledge. Even Draco didn't seem to see magic as really truly alive despite having had Lady Magic or something like it show up in his ward room.
Right. Okay. It was fine. They'd do what they planned. They'd go through the mini-labyrinth, smash the altar or something, and then channel the magic the twins had raised.
"This is sacred ground, Mother," Draco said as he got out of bed, batting her hands away. "I won't let him desecrate this place. We must go so that he follows us. The spell will fade as soon as we leave, but that's all right. We can always do it again sometime. Or have you and Grandfather do it. We can discuss it."
And then they would link through the wards to Ivy and Dobby who would link to the twins and they'd channel the magic the twins and the Weasley family and Mrs. Malfoy and Amal and everyone else had summoned to stop Dumbledore for good.
Draco looked over his shoulder to Harry who nodded. "That seems to be accurate. It's certainly not a spell or a ritual or anything. Just… gentleness and acceptance and the blessing comes off."
When Harry peeked out the window, barely daring to twitch the curtains open an inch, the sun was high in the sky. It looked like mid-morning, maybe eight which was ridiculous. Aunt Petunia never let Harry sleep this late. Even Dudley got rousted out of bed long about now. Despite that, he didn't hear Aunt Petunia doing anything more than humming downstairs.
Harry sat bolt upright, nearly spilling the remaining half of his hot chocolate right down his front. As Harry stared at her, Draco sighed and snagged his mug, putting it with his on the tray to be taken away. Then Draco raised an enquiring eyebrow at Harry.
He glanced at Harry who bit his lip and looked more than a little worried about people's reactions to it. Oddly, the biggest worry that he got from Harry wasn't Dumbledore or the teachers at Hogwarts. It was Ron and Hermione. Their faces were the ones hovering in Harry's mind's eye.
A grandfather who'd been cursed and maybe poisoned, who was on the verge of dying just when Harry found out about him. But still, Harry had a grandfather and that was… everything.
Amal's frown went surprised, then awed and then downright determined in a grimly serious way that Draco wouldn't have expected out of the genial, smiling man. Mother nodded thoughtfully as if that made total sense. It did.
Usually, the kitchen hummed with the squeaky voices of house elves. The stoves and fireplaces were always busy, full of food being prepared; roasts being cooked. Every worktable, set at the proper height for house elves, was covered with bowls and cutting boards, baskets of fruit and stacks of eggs.
Except not. Because if they did this right, they would be able to stop Dumbledore and his dark magic prayer / ritual thingie.
"It used to belong to my father," Harry said. "I got it last Christmas, Yule, from… Huh. Well. Then again, maybe I shouldn't use it."
"Which reminds me," Draco said as if he was desperate to talk about anything other than the white amazing whatever it was that had happened between them. He wagged a finger at Harry just like Harry had wagged a finger at him. "I felt something when I touched your magic. It was… Deep breath, Potter. You're not going to like this."
Dobby leaned his forehead against Harry's chest. Both of them were breathing hard. Tears trembled in Harry's eyes.
Tippy's eyes filled with tears as Harry overwhelmed him by caring what happened to him. "Tippy will tell the others. We is not wanting to stay but had nowhere else to go."
Harry didn't get to hear anything else because Amal pulled him away and down the hallway. They went down a long flight of stairs with torches lit not quite often enough for Harry to be certain of his footing, down a long hallway that was carved out of solid rock and then through six huge vault doors separated by caverns that had doors leading in every direction. Even up.
"Yeah, it had to be deliberate," Harry agreed as he hugged Dobby back. "He's messing with our soulbond. He's messing with our bonds to the elves. And he's messing with our minds so that we don't notice anything happening. That's all deliberate."
"Dobby did," Dobby declared. He crossed his arms across his chest and glowered at Silverclaw. "Dobby is very proud to be the Great Harry Potter's elf. Very proud!"
Ivy nodded. Not a hesitant nod, not a doing what you ordered me to do nod. It was a firm, certain, absolute sort of nod as tears welled up in her eyes. Draco blew out a breath and collapsed back into the wing chair, staring at Ivy as hard as she stared at him.
"Does that work for you?" Harry asked Remus. "I am sorry we can't just let you in, but we gotta be careful about this. There's too many risks to opening the wards and letting people in willy-nilly."
"I'll check with him on my seedlings later, darling," Mother called as she pulled book after book after scroll after folio off the shelves, passing them to Blue who levitated them over to the central worktable. "Don't spend too long."
Grandfather Arcturus snort-laughed and nodded. "That he would. And I wouldn't begrudge him a single knut for arranging the meeting, either. Make sure you head right back, lad. I don't want you here alone. Or just with elves, as the case may be."
Father's screams died to gurgling groans that slowly faded away until Malfoy Manor was deathly silent. Draco rubbed his face. His eyes were dry. He couldn't remember the last time he'd cried. After everything that had happened, especially since the end of term when the Dark Lord's spirit returned to torture Father and Mother, Draco didn't have any tears left.
"Nah, it's not just me," Harry insisted just as quietly. "It's the magic. I mean, it's gotta go very soft and very gentle and kind of… like encouraging something very small and weak and exhausted to rest? That's what it felt like to me. It wasn't… like that."
He didn't dare say exactly what he was containing. Honestly, Draco was stunned that he'd been able to hold the Dark Lord's shade in with the journal. Or was part of his soul trapped in the journal? Draco didn't know, couldn't tell, and frankly didn't care as long as someone came to take it away soon.
Yule had popped in immediately, shoving a hot chocolate into Draco's hands and then returned a moment later with a sherry for Mother. He'd then shoved firewiskey at Moody and Croaker who'd stared as if stunned.
Draco grunted when they reached the first turn of the labyrinth and the misery and pain turned into a surge of pure fury at the world.
Lord Black reclined on one of his couches, just as he always did. He had a heavy bearskin rug over his legs. On top of that were several folios and two leather-bound books. He'd managed to put on a proper shirt today though Draco wondered how much it had cost him. His eyes were mostly closed as they were shown in, the silver of his eyes barely gleaming at them at all.
Which was as clear as could be a pure excuse. Draco didn't challenge Remus on it. It was hardly his place to call attention to the lies Remus told himself. Besides, Remus did have a point. Everything was different for Remus because he was a werewolf, if not fully a werewolf.
Draco nodded again. He leaned against Harry's side, grinning when Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and put his chin on Draco's shoulder. The simple joy of being held let Draco relax even further.
Dobby nodded, ears flapping, and then popped away. As they headed upstairs in the bigger round tower, Harry couldn't help but go through all the terrible things in his life to see how they related to Dumbledore.
Next, he turned to Remus who stared at Draco as if he couldn't quite believe that he was standing there in Malfoy Manor trying to save the world. Which, fair. Harry couldn't quite believe even now that he was here with Draco and that so much had changed. It'd only been eleven days. Eleven short days full of way too much stuff happening.
The team that Silverclaw summoned in had refused to work on Harry at Black Manor. Malfoy Manor was rejected as well. Justifiably, given that Draco had not had the time or the intelligence to ask to have all the dark magic staining the manor and the wards purged entirely. Yet. He did the instant he realized it needed to be done.
"Thank you for admitting it finally," Harry said with a little sniff of disapproval that would've done Mother proud during one of the old, terrible balls Father used to throw.
No heat, no icy cold; just a wash of air as the phoenix arrived and flipped her five-foot wings into a neat "v" around her body. Her enormous tail flared behind her in a blaze of fiery points that only vaguely resembled the normal peacock "eyes" before settling down behind the battlement. Little sparks of blue flame drifted upwards off her tail, caught by the wind blowing the storm ever closer.
Despite his disgust that the blatant manipulation, Draco still dropped asleep the instant he put his head down. Harry rubbed the back of his neck and nodded to Ivy to keep an eye on Draco.
Lord Black was properly dressed for the first time in Draco's memory, standing tall and strong in the sunlight. The grey tinge to his skin was gone. The ever so faint smell of sickness was gone, too, though Draco only noticed it once he realized that he'd been fooled.
"Very short," Draco agreed. "Don't worry, Mother would never keep us up. She wanted us both to go to bed hours and hours and hours ago."
"Good point," Draco said. He kept his eyes on Remus who was making those garbled noises again. "You're right that we can't let him go. Not until he's been properly scanned, purged and certified as un-affected by Dumbledore's machinations."
It took ten minutes, thirteen trips of the Ford Anglia around the wards and three small heart attacks for George Weasley to pilot the car to the battlements on the right path and trajectory to allow them to unload their passengers. Which were Ginny, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Percy, Charlie, Bill and then Fred, all of whom carried bulky bags that they all but flung down the stairs while gabbling about threats, their parents and what in Merlin's name Harry thought he was doing.
Harry nodded slowly before closing is eyes and touching the wards. It wasn't visible but Draco felt the shift in the energies around them. Back on the stairwell just out of line of sight, Remus shifted and growled. Professor McGonagall must have swatted him because Draco heard a quiet yelp and then an even quieter "sorry".
"Just… you don't know what you don't know so you do these things, these amazing things, that no one could be prepared for," Amal said. He stretched and yawned, shaking his head and grinning as Harry giggled into Draco's shoulder. "I think they're dead right, guys. No one else can break the blessing for you. It's not even breaking. I mean, I tried making it let go. I tried order it. I tried praying to Lady Magic. It wasn't until I did just what Draco said, accepting it and gently thanking it for helping me so well, that it let go. That's what we gotta do."
"Dobby is very stealthy commando!" Dobby exclaimed before leaving in a dramatic pop that cracked like a firecracker.
"Who gave it to you?" Draco asked so fiercely that Harry pulled the cloak off and held it away from his body.
"We've got a tent, Lord Potter," Bill said. "Mum and Dad sent us here because they knew this was the safest place we could be. There's talk of attacking Dumbledore."
"We will," Harry promised. "You and the other elves need to get out of Hogwarts if you can. Go help Professor McGonagall and Grandpa Arcturus and Remus and the others. They could use your support. Just don't get hurt. We don't want any of you to be hurt if at all possible."
"Harry," Draco huffed, fond and dismayed at the same time, "really, don't say things like that. It makes us look bad that you're ignorant of everything important. Comment later, in private, and I'll explain whatever you want."
By the time Harry figured out just what he was doing, Draco was kneeling in front of Harry with a worried frown on his face. It wasn't so much that Harry's magic was reacting to his fury. The Black Manor wards were reacting. They were all stiff and angry along with him, like they were expecting someone to assault the Manor at any second.
The elf's eyes wrinkled in a smile that didn't reach his lips. "Tippy wants to help. What can Tippy do?"
Either way, they spent about an hour or so debating just what to ask Sirius and the Department of Mysteries for. Harry spent the hour writing up a detailed explanation of what he and Draco had done and explaining that it wasn't something that could be easily replicated without access to a properly pure labyrinth, really strong wards and people who were willing to risk their magic on a secret request that no one else would know about or be able to praise them for. He made sure to tell Croaker which book they'd used for their ritual and wrote down the entire thing so that Croaker had as much information as Harry could give him.
It stayed firmly away from the varied bonds Draco carried, brushing over them and accepting them one by one. The only thing it kept coming back to was the blessing curled deep inside of Draco. That it plucked at from time to time like a toddler playing with the strings of a harp to make it sing atonally.
Harry's eyes went wide. He looked up at Lord Black who was frowning at Draco as though he wasn't at all sure what to make of Draco. The other man, Amal, bit his lip and switched his stare between Lord Black, Mother and Draco while fidgeting nervously. If he weren't Muggleborn, Draco would eat his favorite pair of dragonhide boots. No one raised in Magical society would ever fidget that way. It showed too much weakness.
"Neville," Harry agreed. "Susan Bones. So, see if we can get allies? See if we can gather support before Dumbledore finds out?"
This time, Professor McGonagall and Remus came up with him. When Aquila flamed in, cooing, Professor McGonagall laughed and gave her a good scritch under the chin and then behind Aquila's head despite the blue-white flames that flickered like a crest there.
Still, the bond to the wards felt better and better the longer Draco communed with the ward stone. The coldness and distance fell away as he got the full shape of the newly reconfigured wards. Its wariness dissipated as it felt the nature and shape of Draco's magic.
"Yes, we are," Draco agreed. "A prayer for mourning. One to celebrate a new marriage. One to… call down the moon?"
"Or not helping you last year was," Draco said. "I don't know which. Mother will look into it. She can work with Mr. Swashlin and Grandfather Arcturus on it while we sleep."
"Right, any reason not to let him through?" Harry said. "I mean, we're agreed that Dumbledore is using him, right? It's kind of obvious in the timing."
"How long until noon?" Harry whispered. His fingernails were glowing, faintly, like he'd painted them with phosphorescent paint.
He'd really hate it if he couldn't use the cloak anymore. Or at least if he couldn't use it until they brought Fake Dumbles down. It was one of the few things that Harry had that was a link to his family. To his parents. The thought that Fake Dumbles might've tainted that one thing from his father made Harry sick.
The pure relief that Arcturus would come to Potter Keep, that he did seem to want Harry, was enough to make him sag back into Amal's arm. All of a sudden, Harry was so tired that he could barely see straight.
"Right," Harry said with far too much determination. "Okay then, help me get their attention and… I don't know, somehow signal them to come here."
All the pieces that Harry had fed Draco clicked into place as Draco ran it all through his marvelous mind.
"Don't mention it," Draco said, waving off his apology. "Literally. I know how horrible my family is. I can hardly avoid it with the damn wards telling me every detail of what Father and Grandfather did over the last few decades. I'll get Mother a healer as soon as you're gone. For now, will someone, please, go take care of the dark artifacts in my father's office? The wards will not stop screaming about them and it's giving me a headache."
"Odd," Draco said. "I feel extra tired, as if I can't get any energy to do anything. All I want to do is sleep."
"Third floor behind the statue of Gunhilda de Gorsemoor," Draco said. He was already mounted, cool and calm and controlled if you didn't have a link to him and couldn't feel the sheer magnitude of his worries. "We'll have to sneak through two other passages to get down to the ward room. It's underneath the library somewhere."
Father's version of education had consisted of throwing tests at Draco without giving him books or tutoring or explanations and then punishing him when he failed. Draco remained astonished that he'd managed to learn anything at all at Hogwarts. He'd spent a huge amount of time trying not to flinch every time he made a mistake or someone else performed better than him.
"I am sorry for that," Draco murmured to stone, to the spells that gave it a heart and a soul and a mind. "I would have come and helped but my soulmate needed me and, well, I'm yet very young for ward work."
"We found it in Filch's office," Fred explained. "It was created by Prongs, Padfoot, Mooney and Wormtail, not that we've any idea who they were. They're… right snarky when you try and ask too many questions about their secret identities. But it's never been wrong that we've seen. Granted, we can't exactly whip it out and look at it all that often. Don't want to get it confiscated so we only use it when we absolutely have to."
"Darling, you need to rest," Mother said, hands fluttering as she almost touched his shoulder but not quite.
"Probably," Harry agreed. "I mean, seriously, it's probably going to take three quarters of forever, even if we could get Hermione in here and set her loose."
There had to be another way to have an heir because there was no way that Draco was doing that with a girl. Ever.
He took a deep breath as he folded the Marauder's Map up and tucked it away safely. His heart hadn't stopped pounding since they passed through the wards. The weird effect where he didn't want to touch Draco was gone, thank Merlin, but there was a biting edge to Hogwarts that made his knees shake.
"I am getting… rather tired of sitting on this bench," Draco admitted in a sly tone that made Harry snicker because he could feel, now that Draco drew his attention to it, the ache in Draco's rear end.
"Yes," Harry said and then laughed breathlessly. "Wow, it feels kind of good to actually say it. I mean, I couldn't say it to Ron or Hermione. They don't understand. Dumbledore sent me back here. I asked, I really did, whether I could go anywhere else. And he sent me back here. I guess he doesn't know."
"I have to save Remus," Harry replied. "The curses aren't solid on him. I can see it. Feel it? In the wards. Can you explain it? I don't know enough magic to explain it."
Harry blinked at the faintly resentful tone. When he turned to stare at Draco, Draco's expression was perfectly exhausted but there was a spot of pink on his pale cheeks. Okay. So he was missing something?
"Fine," Draco said. "What are you seeing that we're not seeing? For you to be so certain he can be saved, there must be a hint, a shred of hope. I can't see it. I don't believe Mother or the others can either. What is it?"
"It's been… I can't remember how long its been since I got to just relax and not worry about anything," Draco said. He frowned as he snagged a chocolate covered almond biscuit to nibble on. "Not since I left the nursery, I think. Mother protected me fiercely when I was still in her domain. Once Father took over my education and care, there was… nothing good."
They both skittered backwards as the blue phoenix flamed away from the pine tree and appeared in a great gout of blue flame on the battlement five feet from the two of them. Despite the bonfire of blue flame, Draco didn't feel any heat.
Remus shook his head like he didn't want to believe what he'd just heard. "You… visited them and they were mean?"
"Damn it," Draco hissed. "We have to get to the center properly or the counter-prayer won't work, Harry."
"Yes, he did," the woman said with a little snort that seemed mildly amused. "Mr. Swashlin has been eagerly waiting for you to arrive. Please go right back. I'll bring tea in momentarily. Would you like lemon or chocolate biscuits?"
"Huh?" Harry stopped skimming and checked. "Huh! They are the same. Why have six copies? This one is all full of scribbled notes."
It was simply too dangerous. Dumbledore had retreated nearly instantly after Draco locked the Malfoy Manor wards. There'd been one rather tentative hit against them and then nothing. Not a hit, not a spell, not even a finger brushing over them to test their lethality. The sheer lack of reaction had Draco twitchier than if Dumbledore had kept pounding on the wards.
Harry bit his lip. "Um, I'd really like to get to the Keep as soon as possible. I mean, I did steal a Malfoy Elf, even if he wanted to be stolen. And I'm kind of missing, though not really. I mean, I know where I am and I'm doing just what I want to be doing, but Dumbledore's going to be really mad at me for not being at my aunt and uncle's place getting abused. So, um, maybe we could go to Potter Keep first and then eat and talk? If you don't mind?"
Professor McGonagall cackled. So did the blue phoenix who trilled at Professor McGonagall encouragingly. She came out of the stairwell, one hand back as if to keep Remus from showing himself.
"It hurts," Remus replied. His voice was even lower, deeper and more growly than before. "It hurts and hurts, and we can't destroy it."
Then it was fine. Dobby popped the food in, grinning and holding up a fist for Amal to bump which Amal did with pride. It was fine. Truly fine, not the making do fine that Harry'd had most of his life.
It was four in the afternoon by the time Mr. Swashlin, who insisted that Harry should call him Amal, finished taking notes. He was still making indignant noises, kind of like an angry goose, but he was done taking notes.
"Please, Mother," Draco begged and didn't even attempt to make it sound like an order. "You know I have so many things to do. Relatives to notify, the Ministry, Gringotts. I can't do this alone. Please, I need your help and I need you to be as strong and healthy as possible."
There was Dobby, who's bond hammered hard in Harry's magic with Dobby's worry and his faith and his frantic desire to be there even though Elf magic might mess up the ritual circle the goblins had set up.
"A blessing," Harry said. "A prayer. I mean, I don't know who the Old Gods are or what they're like, but what if this spell is a blessing that's supposed to help and protect you? What if Dumbledore took an old, old prayer of protection and turned it into something that functionally enslaves people when it was combined with a bunch of other stuff? It wouldn't really be visible because it doesn't do much. The magic doesn't hurt you. It just sits there and collects other influences until suddenly you're not you anymore."
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm sure it's just one of a zillion things I should've learned but didn't because Dumbledore thinks I need to be his pawn or something. So, they have to be allowed to run around?"
Remus stared at Harry without seeing him again, mouth dropped open and making garbled angry noises that were a lot like when Uncle Vernon would get so mad that his face went purple and he started spitting when he tried to speak.
"Potter, the Dark Lord's shade has already been captured," Draco said once he managed to stop laughing. His voice shook but Draco couldn't stop it.
Honeydukes’ brightly colored storefront had children clustered around it, pointing at the various bins of candy. Harry didn't recognize any of them. No surprise really. It was August. All his fellow students were at home. No one who knew Harry was anywhere near Hogsmeade right now.
After all, it'd worked super-well for Harry and Dobby. Hopefully, it would do just as well for Arcturus Black, too. And having an actual grandparent whose life he'd saved was sure to be better than having Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon as guardians. It sure couldn't be worse.
"I bet," Harry said, grinning at Dobby. "I asked the ward stone, or maybe I asked Lady Magic or something, if there was a way to take control of the blessing back from Dumbledore. The ward stone wants me to cut my finger on the edge here. Good idea, bad idea? Get an adult idea? Do it and ask forgiveness afterwards? What do you think?"
"Harry," Draco said as he rubbed his burning eyes, "they can't save him. I know you don't want to admit it but there is no way to free him from the curses."
The blue-green bond-rope came from everywhere. His head and his chest and his fingers and his knees and his toes; the blue-green glow rose up out of every part of Draco, spinning into a rope that stretched off through the wall towards Harry's bedroom suite.
"Getting in there is precisely the problem," Professor McGonagall complained. "Not even the elves can get in through the Hogwarts wards, Mr. Potter. They're not bonded to the castle."
Across the room, next to Hedwig's now-open cage, Harry's trunk sat waiting. The second thing Dobby had done was to pop all Harry's belongings out of the cupboard. Harry had nearly cried in relief just  from getting his wand back. Having pants that weren't hand-me-downs from Dudley had brought real tears to his eyes.
"Dobby does not want to hurt the Great Harry Potter," Dobby whispered as the tears flowed down his cheeks. "He does not. He wants to save the Great Harry Potter."
"Hermione would faint," Harry finally said, shivering at the sheer number of books he had available to him. "There's more books here than in Hogwarts' library. I want to move in here and never leave."
"Told you so," Harry said, grinning at Draco. "It's good. Everything about English cooking needs more garlic."
She twisted her hands in the pale green pillowcase-dress he'd given her when she was assigned to him last year. Her ears were shaking. So were her knobby knees under the hem of her dress. When Draco waved her closer, right up to his knees, Ivy hesitated but she approached.
Mother choked on a laugh. "Oh, your father would have burned any such books long before you were born, had there been any."
Getting Lord Black to the bank had taken Dobby and Silverclaw together going and submitting proof that Harry really was the heir to the Black family as well as the Potter family. They'd helped Arcturus Black back through the floo, not to the one in the lobby but one lower in the bank closer to the healers' caverns.
"Oh, was it the "should have smothered you when you were born" or the "you're a freak from a line of freaks that should all be killed on sight"?" Harry asked.
He grinned when Draco frowned at him. Of all of them, Mr. Swashlin looked like the only one with any energy besides Dobby. Honestly, Draco wasn't sure that Dobby ever got tired. He was like those colorful little hard rubber balls that could you hit with a blasting curse and all they'd do is bounce and roll away.
"They've been here for generations," Draco said, leaning against the railing next to Harry. "Them and the hedge maze."
He scooped Draco up in his arms and carried him like a baby right back down to the first floor. All along the way, Moody yelled at the aurors, at the elves, and then at Mother who descended on them to snatch Draco out of Moody's arms so that she could hug him and kiss his forehead and murmur nonsense promises that it would all be better now.
For one crystalline moment, Harry could see it play out. Harry grabbing for Dobby, Dobby dodging and then causing trouble downstairs. Spilling the wine or toppling the dessert or something. They wouldn't see Dobby. It would all come back on Harry and the next four weeks would be even worse than the last had been.
Harry poked Draco's shoulder. "He's your grandfather, too, you know. Well, great-grandfather but still. You can call him Grandpa, not sir or Lord or something."
"Couldn't he," Harry continued even though his voice shook, "shouldn't he have seen that Sirius got a trial? Dobby swears that Sirius is innocent. Any Elf could've told him. And, you know, he knew that Sirius wasn't the one who held the secret, right? Since he cast the spell. He knew!"
"Not really," Draco said, still frowning. "Harry said something and it's… It's bothering me. I'm not sure why."
"We should get the grownups," Draco said though he didn't move from the table and the slim little labyrinth prayer book.
