“A few years?” Harry guesses. “I think it was—Christmas Eve, 2001.”
It had hit him like a knife in the gut, how he’d never have a family of his own, and there had been several long drunken hours Apparating from pub to pub, a miracle he didn’t splinch himself, Sirius’ face sneaking up on him like a poltergeist once he was really in the cups—and when he’d woken up he hadn’t been able to remember Sirius’ death, Sirius’ funeral. It took a bit of detective work to figure out what he’d done, exactly, while he was blacked out, but Harry wasn’t one of the youngest Aurors on the force for nothing. He figured it out, and the next morning he pulled out his memory of screaming over Cedric Diggory’s body, and from there it was a very slippery fall straight downhill—to here.
Harry’s heart makes a valiant attempt to escape out his throat. “Draco,” he says.
Some time later, his mug empty, dregs going cold on the ledge beside him, he becomes aware of a commotion in the flat below. Someone’s pounding on the door, Ron’s shouting in tired confusion about it being common bloody courtesy to use the Floo at this bloody hour, and with an electric jolt, Harry recognizes Draco’s voice.
He wouldn’t have heard it at all except that he was attuned to these things, having had all sorts of curses thrown at him surreptitiously and not-so-surreptitiously over the years. The curse was aimed at Malfoy, but Harry was between him and it, so with no time to cast
Harry has to remind himself more than once as they make their way out through the crowded halls of the Ministry to keep his hands to himself—it’s a near thing, every time they pass a maintenance closet, because he wants more than anything right now to get his hands under Draco’s clothes. It’s not even a sex thing, he doesn’t think—he’s just suddenly starving for Draco’s skin, hungry to have as much of him as he can have, greedy about it. He wants to be alone with him, to have him all to himself. He doesn’t even want other people to look at him, really, especially not people he knows are friends with fucking Choudhury, especially not

battering around the inside of his ribcage like a bludger has left him with no capacity for the correct emotions.
He forgot something, earlier.
When Harry arrives at his desk, Ron and Hermione are already there, camped out with coffees and scones from POTATO, the trendy new café in the lobby, and having an intense whispered argument. Harry’s skeptical of the name of the café and the argument, especially so early in the day, but he likes the scones, so he just says, “Morning,” and pilfers a blueberry one as he plops down in his chair.
,” Harry says. He shoots a quick
“No,” Harry says. “No, I’m not going to leave you with—”
Even after he lost Ginny he kept the tradition of getting blindingly drunk after an Animagus assignment, which he views as an effective if not very elegant way to facilitate his crashing back into human society. Unfortunately, though, the moment he lands in the arrivals hall in the Ministry, the customs witch takes one look at him and screams for an emergency Portkey to St. Mungo’s.
He shoves Harry’s robes off his shoulders and onto the floor, so they’re standing in a pool of fabric. His fingers open Harry’s belt and his fly deftly, with barely any pressure—“
, obscenely, beautifully wrong, to have the bony, aquiline bridge of Draco’s nose pressed against his cleft, Draco’s hands hauling him back onto the warm, wet muscle of his tongue.
there, since Malfoy’d probably put him out on his arse and he doesn’t have a good reason to go anyways. Somehow, though, he pulls himself back to his feet, through the bathroom door, and the next thing he’s aware of he’s standing in the Manor’s foyer.
Ginny, when he’d finally staggered back to the flat, didn’t seem to have noticed he’d been missing. There’d been some gala, some charity something or other that night that all the Harpies had to attend, and she’d been fluttering around the flat in high heels and sparkling blue dress robes, hair spilling around her face in sheer waves while Harry lay flat on the floor next to the couch and tried to summon up the effort to go get a pepper-up potion.
“Er,” Harry says, “where’s the east sitting hall?”
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, “yes, Draco, yeah.”
In the morning Harry arrives at his desk to find
“Why didn’t you come to the Manor?” Draco says against his ear, soft enough that only Harry can hear.
“Did you—?” Harry asks, a bit choked. “You and Blaise?”
, why is there anger stirring in his chest just hearing Ron say his name—why does he want to go into the loo and curl into a ball and pull Draco’s sweater up over his head and breathe in his scent and maybe cry a lot, why does telling his friends they’re
“What else are you supposed to do,” he says, voice distant, not looking away from his thumb as it traces carefully beneath Harry’s nipple, miraculously unscathed. “You’re supposed to let me keep you, Harry.”
He’s too drained, after that, to do more than lie under Malfoy and attempt to mumble things like
“Harry,” he says once, adoring, and doesn’t say anything more.
Draco’s breath catches. “Alright.” His hand soothes back through Harry’s hair, petting him. “Alright, darling, I’ve got you.”
That was not, Harry knew, the official stance. The official stance was that Kingsley, fresh off a gracious stint as Minister, having returned to his beloved DMLE to find his Aurors dying a slow death under a mountain of unsolved cases, decided to bring in a number of outside consultants to whip everyone into shape.
, in Auror parlance—and he’s found mostly that the gulf of his experience is too big, too deep to bridge.

Before he can figure it out, Draco slides his other hand up the back of his neck, into his hair to cradle his skull, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Tell me what you want, turtle.”
but some tabloid in Ireland that he’d never heard of; running into Cho Chang at twenty, asking her out only to have her let him down very gently in front of a woman he took a moment too long to realize was her wife; how he’d sobbed the first time he woke up alone in a foreign hospital, arm twisted round the wrong way and missing half its skin and everyone he knew safely back in London, none the wiser.
“Harry?” Hermione says, with a high-pitched note of alarm.
Harry is up early the next morning, not having slept much. By some stroke of terrible luck he ended up in what he thinks must’ve been Malfoy’s childhood bedroom, with green and silver linens and bedposts shaped like cobras that hissed and whispered at him all night. He wouldn’t have guessed that Parseltongue would extend to snake-shaped furniture, but at this point there’s very little in his life that surprises him; he’d asked them as politely as he could manage to please shut the bloody hell up, but they’d been chattering all night about how it was so nice to finally meet him, after all they’d heard about him, which Harry figured meant Death Eaters had done some strategizing in here, or something.
Harry stares determinedly at his own hands. He’s afraid to hear what Draco is trying to tell him.
Harry swallows. This is, unfortunately, really not helping his raging boner situation. “Right,” he says. “Carry on.”
Malfoy was looking away, lips a tight white line. “Sorry,” Harry said. “Merlin, Draco, I’m sorry.”
Finally, he sighs. “Alright, then. Come along.”
Harry Potter, savior of the bloody wizarding world, the Boy Who Fucking Lived, wants Draco Malfoy to let him fall asleep on his cock. And the worst part is that Draco is going to let him. Draco is calling him

yet that he was in trouble—he had a sneaking suspicion, maybe, but he wasn’t sure. Now, having come for a second time, feeling rather damp and wrung out and like he’s just woken up from an exceptionally good nap, refreshed and invigorated and still somehow a little sleepy, Harry looks down at Malfoy’s pale blond head resting against his hip, his body still clenching and unclenching spasmodically around Malfoy’s long pianist’s fingers, and thinks: oh, fuck, I love him.
roll of his hips that makes Harry feel like he’s going to explode. “You don’t have to hide. I want to see all of you.”
The clawmarks rake across his pectorals, wrapping around his right side, under his arm. He was told the wampus cat missed most of his vital organs, excepting a bit of his spleen, but that its claws broke a few ribs on their way through; fortunately he was out like a light while they were re-growing his bones. If he’d had to choke down Skele-Gro it might’ve actually broken him.
unfolding itself neatly in the air in front of him, and as the bird flutters over to him he says absently, without looking up from his reading, “Thank you, you may go.”
But Hermione doesn’t answer. She’s staring at the emerald green sweater Harry’s wearing, realization dawning slowly on her face.
Malfoy stops with his hand on the door to his bedroom. The lanterns dim in anticipation of their master’s exit, and his face is cast half in shadow. Ominous, Harry thinks, and then:
To here: avoiding Draco Malfoy’s gaze, everything he owns crammed in his pockets, his heart dragging heavy towards the floor like it wants him to collapse here, in the sanctum of Draco’s study, and not get up.
Ron continues to be shocked and appalled all the way down the stairs to the flat, where he pulls Harry aside and asks him very seriously if he’s being mind controlled.
“I’m looking,” Harry promises. His laugh fades to a smile, then melts away completely. Draco looks really serious. “What is it? Is something the matter?”
,” Harry says, pushing past her into the flat. He was right about the typewriters—there are about a dozen of them set up on tables where a normal person would have a living room, keys moving of their own volition.
Malfoy sighed. “When you can walk again, we’re going down to the Apparation point, and we’re going to the Manor. I’ve got a poultice that will cool you down enough to actually focus on your session.”
Still, he supposes he can live with it. Ginny warned him, after all, and she’s probably right about letting it blow over.
“Right,” Harry says.
Harry sits down and helps himself to several ornate pastries. “What part of ‘my flat burned down’ did you not understand? It's alright, I’ve got an extra pair of trousers at work, and I can borrow something from Ron—”
Eventually they reach the last of the thirteen vials and find themselves back in the training room at the DMLE, groggy, their minds full. Draco might’ve had a point, before, about doing this at the Manor; it’s strange to suddenly find themselves back in the real world, disorienting.
Draco kisses him once, lazily, and murmurs, “I thought it was very Shakespearean of me, at the time. Suffering gallantly through puberty whilst tortured by rapturous visions of my arch nemesis.”
“I know,” Draco says, mouth suddenly replaced by the long, delicious slide of his magically-slicked fingers as he comes to his feet behind Harry. “I know, turtle, I’ve got you.”
“Don’t,” Harry says, before he can get the rest out. “Don’t fucking call me that.”
“What look?” Harry asks. He thinks he should feel indignant, maybe, but the combination of Malfoy sprawled out between his legs like a contented panther and the word
The delicate lines of him, his pointy nose and the red indentations of where he’s had his pince-nez on at work all day, this face that Harry knows so well—this face he’s obsessed over, hated, dreamed about, been sneered at by, wanted to punch, said unforgivable things to, misunderstood, seen in a thousand different lights, cool winter and warm candlelight and the shadows of the Hogwarts dungeons, this face that he has now kissed—Harry feels something massive swell in his chest, like a heart which is much too large has taken up residence in place of his normal one. Malfoy might be a snot and a stuck-up ponce on a good day, but somehow he has bitched and slandered his way straight to a post somewhere behind Harry’s sternum, and despite all attempts to oust him he is refusing to leave.
“Hey!” Harry says, indignant. “I don’t have
Given the nature of his position, Harry spent most of his time as Remus Lupin had during the war—embedded in deep cover, limited contact with other Aurors, dirty and cold and fearing for his life twenty-three hours out of every twenty-four—so he didn’t run into Malfoy until seven years after he’d testified at his Wizengamot hearing, when Head Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt had a mental break.
He feels awful. Really, genuinely awful.
Draco is here.
Hermione avoids his gaze.
Potter, I’m going to have to tie you up!” Malfoy exploded, when he had to jump over the eighth jelly-legs jinx of the day. “You’re meant to defend yourself with your
It’s not the first time he’s come tonight, to be exact about it, but the first time he came he wasn’t quite
He stops dead, staring at Harry’s hair—no doubt covered in pink Futortentia dust—and says, “Oh, blast.”
Draco’s fingers on Harry’s face are like a firebrand. Harry could write
“Of course I came for you, you tosser,” Draco says, tipping him back into bed. “A month is too long. A month is much too long, and I expect you to tell Kingsley Shacklebolt as much the next time you see him.”
His body arches up off the chair, nearly unseating Harry, every muscle pulled taut. Harry holds his face, peppering kisses over his cheeks, over his thin, aquiline nose, over the sweaty lock of hair plastered to his ear, holding him as best he can in this position, while Draco clings to him and shivers delicately and pumps him full of come.
Harry frowns. “How come it’s so easy to put memories back in out of the Pensieve, then?”
“I wasn’t thinking,” Harry said, feeling miserable.
Then he opens the door, slips through, and is gone.
He lets them fuss over him, though—or rather, exchanges exasperated eyebrow-raises with Ron while Hermione fusses over him. He puts on the clothes they brought him, trying not to wince as all the new skin he’s just grown tugs painfully, and stands by while Hermione handles all the business of checking him out of the hospital. He goes along with Ron Side-Along Apparating him to the phone booth entrance to the Ministry, and when he comes out of his debriefing nearly six hours later, he doesn’t protest Ron Side-Along Apparating him again, this time back to his and Hermione’s flat.
“You know, mate,” Ron’s saying—evidently the argument over Rita Skeeter is over—“you can stay with us if you don’t want to be knocking around that creepy old house all on your own.”
Rebecca tells Rita.
He reunites with the first a few hours later, after spending his lunch hour with Finch-Fletchley poring over import records down in the Office of Magical Revenue & Customs.
“Er,” Harry says, “remember you were asking about those blank spots in my mind?”

, he doesn’t say, but it looks like Malfoy hears it anyways. He drains the rest of his firewhiskey in one swallow and sends the glass dancing back over to the drinks cart, cloth rising to clean it as it approaches.
Draco shakes his head, hand squeezing Harry’s knee. “Nothing’s the matter. I just want you to know that you’re never going to owe me anything for looking after you. You don’t owe people for loving you.”
Draco puts down the
Harry spills milk all over his pajama pants.
Harry wanted to say, but it came out, “Mngrh.” Malfoy’s thigh was warm and very firm under his face. He wanted to nuzzle it.
Then he turns back to the Pensieve, all business.
Draco stops him with a sharp shake of the head. He takes out his wand and draws the memories back into the Pensieve. His hand is shaking. Harry wants to hold him around the waist, but he gets the sense it wouldn’t quite be welcome, so he doesn’t. He goes to stand next to him, as close as he can get without touching, and together they lean over the basin and into the past.
“You hate the job,” Draco says. Harry’s trousers go flying over his shoulder, thrown with a violent flick of his wand, and out of the closet come dancing some of Draco’s things—silken pants, warm flannel, a rich black sweater.
Draco notices. He nuzzles Harry’s face with intent, his hand drifting south. Harry’s cock has been through so much tonight that he almost wants to angle his hips away, but also he never wants Draco to ever stop touching him. He wants—he wants things that gut him, things he can’t even articulate, things that make him feel like the child he never was, a child throwing a tantrum and gorging himself on cake.
, go wait outside.”
, expecting some sympathy over the business with Nagini and her father or at least that horror fest they’d both been through with the Basilisk, but Ginny’d just said absently, “Oh, well, that sort of makes sense, doesn’t it?” and leaned down to pat him on the head, and then he’d been alone.
” Draco shouts, like Harry’s a child who’s just announced he spent the day running around with a knife. “Of all the idiotic—Why didn’t you bloody
Harry freezes with a mouthful of scone.
Hermione relays the instructions from the St. Mungo’s discharge nurse very sternly to Draco, in a way that seems like she expects him to protest. Draco doesn’t protest; he listens solemnly, attentively, remembering it all.
Draco’s eyes are red. He pulls Harry into a kiss, hands rough on the front of his shirt, then pushes him back almost immediately so he can look him in the eye. “You could’ve died,” he says.
It is, he figures, about time he put his memories back in his head, where no one can steal them.
He gets his wand out and manages to cast a stinging

“Keep me?” Harry repeats, distracted by his touch. “What, like a live-in gigolo?”
. Harry feels like he should remember something about love, and Draco—he’s got that same itchy feeling in the back of his head he used to get thinking near his removed memories, and he wonders with alarm what he’s missing. What he could possibly be missing, when he’s already so in love with this man he’s sure it must be written in giant letters on his face.
but isn’t sure what), and stuffs everything he can salvage in there. The vials go in an interior pocket with an extra padding charm on it, along with the few half-burnt case files that survived in the kitchen. Harry’s clothes are a lost cause, as are his books. Most of the photos survived, trapped behind warped glass, and he takes the time to remove each one from the frame, slipping them carefully in an empty file folder marked CARROW, FIORA—an old case, long since closed.

“Harry,” Draco says softly.
Draco hands the vials back to him, then gets dressed slowly and deliberately, like he already knows which memories these are and he’s as anxious about it as Harry is.
“Ah,” Draco says, peering over Harry’s shoulder to watch his growing erection lift the hem of his sweater. “Fortunately, my stamina is unmatched in the city of London.”
Harry meets his eyes—which are, unfortunately, devastating, commanding eyes. He can feel Zabini watching them like the cat that’s got the cream, and he’s disproportionately aware of how much of his cock is on display in that kimono, but Malfoy raises his eyebrows (
Kreacher doesn’t come. No one comes. Harry feels like he’s fifteen again, like he’s just lost his godfather not even two years after he got him. Like he’s been hit in the stomach with a baseball bat and he can’t let it show on his face.
dignified orgasms, before Draco.
Ron’s face drops. “What,” he says, “you knew he was serious?”
Kreacher appears, pointy and hunched over in the shadows at the end of the hall. His eyes shine hatefully in the dark. “Yes, master,” he says. “Master will be wanting to rummage through the attics again, such a mess…”
“Strong,” he says.
Harry had known, in an abstract sort of way, that Malfoy occasionally consulted for the DMLE. He remembers thinking
Harry feels sort of like he’s been smacked round the head, finding one of his old schoolmates running a sex club, so it’s a good thing Malfoy doesn’t seem to need his input.

Hermione puts a hand on his shoulder, squeezes. “What do you want to do?”
Only it wasn’t a danger, really. Harry never pulled memories that had to do with work, and he’d found that pulling memories of, say, learning to cast a Patronus didn’t actually take away his knowledge of how to cast a Patronus—just his memory of who’d taught him, where he’d been, what they’d said. Memory permeated too much, like spilling water on a tile floor. It got into the grout, into the tiny cracks. It filtered down through your whole life. You couldn’t remove it cleanly.
Kingsley, who had never been at Hogwarts with Harry and thus was not aware of the epic heights to which his rivalry with Malfoy had soared, looked unimpressed. “Your ‘training’ was nearly a decade ago," he said. "And it was hardly comprehensive. You’re going to sit down with Malfoy, and you’re not going back in the field until he gives you a rubber stamp. Besides, hating your teacher should be good incentive to keep him out of your head.”
obsessed—following surreptitiously through corridors, quiet noise of staircases grinding somewhere behind him, stone against stone, sick hot throbbing of heart, wand in clenched fist, cold sweat of anticipation, doorway of boys’ bathroom, blond head and red eyes in reflection and the shock—
“Well, maybe it’s something to do with having Voldemort riding along in my head all those years,” Harry shot back. “You would know something about that, wouldn’t—“ and it was meant to be vitriolic, meant to hurt him, but Harry realized as the words were coming out of his mouth that Malfoy

They watch Ginny for a while in silence, as she runs out of pads and starts launching objects pilfered from passerby—a reporter’s camera, a toddler’s sippy cup (the pumpkin juice had been hell to get out of the carpet), an old man’s top hat. Harry remembers, distantly, how much the things she’s saying had hurt at the time, but now there’s only a dull ache. Draco’s presence at his back certainly helps.
It’s a very, very long time.
“Safety,” Malfoy echoes, like he might laugh. “Potter, if
Malfoy’s mask of haughty imperviousness doesn’t disappear, but it does shift, the longer Harry stays quiet. For a moment Harry almost thinks he’s

Turtle.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Yeah, I’m sure.”
“Look at you,” he says, warm and appreciative, as he banishes each piece of Harry’s clothing one by one, until Harry is standing there in his glasses and nothing else. He’s breathing hard, like he’s been running; he skates one hand up the side of Harry’s arm, raising goosebumps as he skims over his shoulder, and takes hold of the nape of his neck to draw him into a hard, speaking kiss. “You really were made for me.”
“You were serious last night, weren’t you?” he asks. “You actually want to marry me.”
Harry doesn’t

Draco reaches out and touches his face. “Of course that first night, you dollop,” he says. “I’ve wanted you for as long as I’ve known what wanting someone meant.”
“No, Master will be coming to stay,” Harry tells him, and sets off up the stairs as Kreacher wails like he’s dying behind him. “See if we’ve got anything in the house for dinner, will you? Thanks.”
Zabini’s nodding, with a look on his face that suggests that was a particularly tricky night and Malfoy’s a son of a bitch for bringing it up. “Right,” he says. “Bridget Baddock. We managed to track her down a week or so after the fact. Had a hell of a time reintegrating the memories, but we managed it.”
He thinks he manages to get a sweater on before either of them can see it, but he’s not sure; Hermione’s giving him a look as she puts his kettle on like either she’s frustrated with him for the stack of unwashed dishes in the sink or she thinks he’s hiding something. Either way, Harry doesn’t get a chance to find out, because Ginny plants herself at his kitchen table and announces, “My agent called this morning.”
Manor?” Ron explodes, loud enough that Hannah Abbot spills tea all over her desk halfway across the room. “Are you mental? Have you been Imperiused? Is he blackmailing you?”
Harry laughs, ebullient, because Draco is wrestling him out of his brand new Gap pajama trousers like they’re a particularly frightening squid wrapped around his legs. “If I thought he’d listen, I’d have told him ages ago. But a month is how long the investigation took, so it had to be a month. That’s the job.”
he breathes, as cool air hits Harry’s skin, “oh, I should’ve given you a pair of my pants”—and then Harry finds himself face-first against the bookshelf, Draco kneeling behind him.
“I’ll just—”
“You said your flat burned down,” Malfoy says. His voice sounds rough, probably from the firewhiskey. “You can stay here, then. There are eighteen guest bedrooms; you’re welcome to any of them.”
Harry trots up the steps, legs wobbly, and follows him down the hall towards his study. He only knows where the study is because it opens into the bedroom and he wandered through it on his way out, the other night; it’s a stately, oak-paneled room with bookshelves most of the way to the ceiling and lanterns floating just above head height that sputter and brighten as they enter.
Shivering, nauseous, he makes himself a cup of tea, takes a blanket off the bed, and goes up onto the roof.
did what he wants him to do, which is pin him to the bookshelf and stuff him so full of cock he can’t move. But whatever version of him knew how to say that in actual human language is long gone, and what’s left is only a thing that wants Draco. A thing that lets out a pathetic, desperate sort of whine, nonverbal.
, pulling his pince-nez down onto the chain. “You know,” he says, casual in a way that Harry can hear is fake, “the only other person with access to the Manor’s wards is my mother. Me, my mother…and you.”
Malfoy raised a skeptical eyebrow, looking up over the rim of his glasses. “That’s not how Occlumency works, Potter.”
fuck. He’s starting to get hard again.
Draco kisses his ear, the side of his head. One of his hands skates under Harry’s shirt, under the sweater, to run through the hair on his chest. “Don’t hide from me,” he growls, with a
They are, at best, tepid work acquaintances. They’ve barely just gotten on speaking terms. Malfoy still mostly hates him, never mind that he just came all over him twice. As usual, Harry’s heart has gotten ahead of itself.
“Harry Potter,” she says, stunned. “Have you come to rough me up? Let me get my camera—”
Draco’s quiet for a minute, gone still underneath him.
“Scared?” Malfoy asks, and when Harry just nods, doesn’t elaborate, “Scared of what?”
he holds on as Harry loses his fingernail-grip on existence, as he goes tumbling into the afterlife.
. “I’m missing something, aren’t I?” she asks. “Who’s Rebecca Roslyn? She wasn’t at school with us, was she?”
“Good morning, Harry,” says Hermione, with a flustered smile, at the same time Ron blurts, “‘Mione’s pregnant.”
Harry’s glad, because he tends not to do so well keeping track of what Mediwizards tell him. For instance, he’d have thought he was perfectly alright for him to Apparate unassisted, but according to Hermione and Draco he’d splinch himself if he tried, so Draco takes hold of his hand, and then his forearm, and then his shoulder, and they Side-Along straight into his bedroom.
“Why not?” Hermione shoots back. “That woman is hateful, Ron, don’t pretend you don’t know it. The extremes she would go to in order to embarrass Harry on a public stage. I reckon she found something in your flat, Harry, that she’s going to add to her book.”
“I didn’t start this,” Harry laughs. He’s been laughing a lot in the last twelve hours, actually. The things that used to weigh on him just don’t seem so heavy with a lapful of Draco Malfoy.
watches. Draco turns to face the wall, his jaw tense, and says nothing until it’s over.
“Yeah,” Harry says, not knowing what he’s agreeing to.
Which is how he ends up following a flying ball of fluff through the halls of the Manor to the east sitting room, a charming, pale green room on the far side of the house, which he’d never have found on his own. Malfoy is just sitting down to a vast breakfast spread when he arrives, the
“Harry,” Draco says, arching down over him to kiss him, chaste and insistent. “Darling, sweetheart,
,” he says, unbearably fond. “Come here.”
“That’s not what I said,” Harry tells Draco, as Ginny dumps her Quidditch kit bag on the cobblestones and starts shooting stinky kneepads through the open window of their flat with highly aggressive levitation charms. “I told her I wished she was home more, that was all.”
“Why don’t we just go see?” Harry says softly.
He spends the earliest hours of the morning alone with the Manor, his robes from yesterday pulled tight around him to keep out the chill. Separated from the grimy horrors of the war, it’s the sort of place he might’ve imagined when he was a kid and his history teacher started talking about
of their Apparation still reverberating around the foyer, he blurts,
Harry sits, watching as Malfoy tinkers around with a strange wooden sphere. The surface is thousands of tiny scales, less than a millimeter, and when Malfoy murmurs to it they extend, so Harry can see they’re actually thousands of thin wooden pins, all sticking out of a central, glowing orb of magic.
Malfoy swears and crouches in front of him, reaching out to hold his head up. “Potter?” he says. “Harry?”
Instead, he takes a long walk down the Manor drive to the gate, and Apparates away with a
idea of what’s in it, before it’s released to the public and people start hassling him about it on the street.

Harry’s heart skips. “I suppose that’s why the bedposts in your old room have heard so much about me.”
“So you have to re-break my mind?” Harry asks, feeling ill.
“You—?” Harry says, startled.

, and miracle of miracles, only one of them is cracked. It’s still three less than he’s meant to have, though, which means that whoever broke in also made off with three of his memories. He wishes, in hindsight, that he’d marked them. At least then he’d know what he was missing.
Ron reaches out and catches her hand. Harry feels it abruptly, like a kick in the gut. They’re going to be parents. His two best friends—they’ve already done this one thing to set themselves apart from him, already gotten married and moved in and made him the third wheel, which on bad days he resents them for even though he knows he shouldn’t, and now…
Draco lets out a sharp breath, like he’s relieved too, and holds him tight. He feels like sunlight spearing through dark clouds, and he doesn’t seem to mind Harry digging his fingers into his back and clutching him pathetically, which is good because Harry doesn’t feel capable of much else at the moment. He just buries his face in Draco’s shoulder, breathing deep, and
know. Malfoy’d testified, at the Wizengamot, that he’d been tortured while Voldemort was living at his house, that he’d resisted the Imperius curse and mind control, that he’d suffered days of
Harry’s heart beats very fast. The sweater smells like Malfoy, and he was thinking as he walked in that it was a good thing no one else in the Auror’s office was likely to have been paying enough attention to their Legilimency consultant to know what he smelled like, but now
and the velvet bag comes floating out of the pocket of his robes, folded neatly over the arm of the smoking chair. Harry catches the bag and holds it tight in one hand. He feels like a bit of an idiot, with his hair all sticking up and pillow creases on his face, wearing only a pair of Draco’s pants, but he still goes forward into the study.
He sends a quick note through the Floo to Ron to let him know someone’s set his flat on fire so he probably won’t be in for the rest of the day, then sets about the tricky business of figuring out who could’ve fucked his wards so badly they decided to set his things on fire instead of function properly. Harry’s never been good at this intricate sort of magic—it’s more Hermione’s thing, or Malfoy’s—but halfway through his perusal of the damage he realizes that most of the wall in his bedroom has sloughed away to the floor, and that his supposedly goblin-rated wall safe is standing open and empty, so he can’t exactly call them.
“There you are,” says Draco, shoving in and staying so that Harry can shake apart endlessly on his cock. “There you are, Harry. Gorgeous. Perfect.” He takes hold of Harry’s cock to help coax the last few spurts of come from him, getting his hand all messy with it, hushing Harry’s harsh, guttural moans.
Eventually Harry pulls away—as far away as Draco will let him get, at least—and finds Ron and Hermione staring at him like he’s grown a second head. “Er,” he says, “I did tell you I was staying with Malfoy.”
—all the letter says is Kingsley needs him on a case, the Guatemala thing, a month’s deep cover in the jungle studying the potions ring’s organizational structure. But after last night he feels like the world is different,
“So a whole crowd of people go with me?” Harry guesses.
Malfoy’s eyes flick up over the rim of his pince-nez. “Potter,” he says. “Help yourself to whatever you like. And weren’t you wearing those robes yesterday?”
“I love you,” he says against Draco’s mouth, “I should’ve said it back there, I love you too—”
Draco’s grip on him tightens. “You’re sure?” he asks.
, and—allegedly—the IWP. Even Harry couldn’t help but be a bit impressed by the last, assuming it was true. He could hardly get the International Wizarding Police to give him the time of day, and here they were calling on Malfoy to assist them with interrogations. He must’ve been quite good.
Harry shakes his head. “I’ve got to report in,” he says, pushing his chair back to stand. “And I need real clothes, and I’ve got to figure out how to get a new Portkey passport since mine went up in flames, and I’ve got to learn Spanish—”
“Kingsley’s overridden you,” he says distantly. “I’m cleared for field work. They’re sending me to Guatemala for a month.”
He Apparates away without waiting for Draco to say anything more.
They convene in the study, where Draco tips both vials into his Pensieve and then—with a look at Harry to check he doesn’t have any objections—draws them carefully into his own head. Harry watches him sway, eyes flickering behind closed eyelids, that odd serenity coming over his face for barely a minute before he’s blinking back awake.
“I don’t hate it,” he says, but the words sound weak and false even to his own ears. “It’s just…some assignments…”
and how nice it was to be understood without words and whether it’s possible to care for someone and not really want to go to all the actual trouble of caring for them at the same time.
He doesn’t wait for Harry to answer. He taps his wand to his temple and pulls out a pearlescent thread of memory, letting it fall into the Pensieve. Then he turns to Harry expectantly and holds out his hand.
you speak to your friends?” Draco asks, after a minute. “About the war, I mean. About all of it.”
Harry thinks, madly. What sort of person says
Draco looks like he hasn’t been sleeping. He’s dressed like he came straight from the Ministry, three-piece suit and a cravat and heavy winter robes cinched close around his waist, his cheeks dusted with pink and his nose bright red from cold, and Harry starts shaking as soon as he sees him.
is too small a word for what he feels when he turns over to look at Malfoy asleep.
Draco gives him a hard look. “Harry, it hardly matters who I’ve slept with in the past, when the only person I intend to sleep with for the rest of my life is you.”
Ron and Hermione are hot on his heels—making lots of noise, Harry’s sure, about what the hell is going on and why the hell Draco sodding Malfoy is romping through their flat in the middle of the night—but Harry barely knows they’re there.
“So,” Malfoy says, circling around the bureau to pick up the glass of firewhiskey he’d evidently set down to go meet Harry, “what have you gotten yourself into this time, Potter?”
Catch him at
“Do the birds help you get dressed in the morning, as well?” Harry asks, a bit dazed.
In the morning Draco’s owl lands in the middle of the breakfast table with an envelope for Harry. It’s magically encoded; Harry presses his thumb to the wax seal and startles back as a missive that must be five or six feet long unravels in his lap and spills onto the floor.
Looking back, remembering what Draco called him, what he did to him, Harry feels like he could die from embarrassment, which makes him want to hit something, and more than a few Guatemalan snakes end up as the undeserving targets of his ire; in between climbing trees and curling around branches eavesdropping on scorched, sickly-green potions makers, Harry lies wide awake in his bigger-on-the-inside hanging tent and wanks furiously, thinking of Draco. Naked and covered with sweat in the humidity, because wizards might’ve got some things down to a science but they really haven’t mastered climate control, hand stripping his cock, Draco the morning after the Futortentia, cleaning Harry off in the bath—the
Harry
“You could’ve talked to your friends,” Malfoy suggests, going around the mind map and starting to prod it into shape with his wand. “You know,
Then he’d started coming home more and more to an empty flat, Ginny away at matches or away at practice or out with the rest of the Harpies getting photographed at wizarding clubs in rundown shopfronts in Muggle London, and in the quiet and the cold bed and his reflection in the inky black windows he’d started to resent her. He wanted someone to come home to, he told her eventually, and she accused him of wanting a housewife, and wouldn’t listen when he said no—he just wanted a home, someone who was there, someone who wasn’t always gone, and she’d fired back that she didn’t want that, that it wasn’t enough for her to sit at home waiting for him, and that wasn’t what he was saying at all and basically they’d had such a schism of understanding, such a split in what they were saying, what they were hearing, that they never really talked to each other again. Not the real way, not how they’d talked in those long nights at the end of the war, curled up together whispering with their faces close together in her room at the Burrow, Ginny playing with his hands, her hair a riot of flames against the pillows.
“I did die,” Harry points out.

Malfoy stares at him for a long moment. Harry has a sudden sense-memory of Malfoy holding his eyes while he worked his fingers into him, something between them pulled tight like a string.
“I don’t know,” Zabini says, in a tone of voice that Harry does not care for at all. “What’s in it for me, Draco?”

“I’ve already done Occlumency training!” Harry spluttered, indignant. “And it’s
He’s pacing a tight circuit in the hall outside and trying not to think about Malfoy being alone in a room with Blaise Zabini’s magnificent cock when it happens—from behind one of the beaded curtains comes a cloud of acrid pink smoke that engulfs his head and sends him, sneezing, against the wall.
Harry supposed he was hardly in a position to judge. After all, he had a Pensieve of his own at home, and a goblin-rated safe behind the wall in his bedroom with sixteen unmarked vials of silver memory.
Draco’s fingers bruise into his hips. His head is flung limp against the back of the chair, chest flushed bright red and heaving, hair a mess. It is, without a doubt, the most debauched Harry has ever seen him look, the least put-together, and suddenly his own nascent arousal doesn’t matter—all he wants to do is wreck this man who is going to be his husband.
Harry remembers lying in the bathroom in Grimmauld Place, after he shoved Sirius’ funeral back into his head. He’d felt as if he’d just put his godfather in the ground all over again, ramrod spine, cold sweat and hands that wouldn’t stop shaking, the cold certainty that
He stares at it for a long minute before he does anything about it, feeling rather like he’s come in and found a bomb. The photo on the cover isn’t one he’s ever seen before, but he thinks it’s from one of the funerals after the war—Remus and Tonks’, probably, or Fred’s. His eyes are red; he’s lifting his eyes to glare at the camera on endless loop, and the overall effect is standoffish, menacing. He looks scary.
All at once Harry is furious. He’s twisted up inside with the unfairness of it all, in a way that is really not befitting an Auror, because last night in bed they laughed for ages, almost deliriously happy, and now Draco is frowning at him and he’s got to go be a fucking snake for a month in fucking Guatemala.

It’s not so much a porch as a pavilion, large enough that Harry can imagine it hosting parties of a hundred people, three hundred. Clearly it hasn’t done anything like that in a while—the stone steps that lead down to the lawn are crumbling in disrepair, and fat little birds are splashing around in the still waters of an enormous fountain, tumbling over each other, chirping sweetly.
“Thank you,” Draco says flatly, but his eyes are dancing in a way Harry’s never seen. He’s in his element, with this. He’s one of only a few people in the world who could possibly solve this problem, and he knows it. He’s energized by his own genius, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and Harry wants very badly to shove him back against the desk and fall to his knees. “
, does not see fit to warn Harry that the "colleague" he’s taking him to meet that night is the proprietor of one of wizarding London’s most exclusive sex clubs.
Draco looks up at his entry. He’s sitting in one of the armchairs by the fire, wrapped in a house coat, pince-nez on and a roll of parchment in his lap. “Harry,” he says, in a voice low enough for the hour. “Sorry. I didn’t want to wake you, but I didn’t want to go far, either.”
Malfoy looks like he’s had a hellish morning, by which Harry means he’s got a few hairs out of place and he’s rolled up his sleeves, but he doesn’t say anything about it as Harry enters the training room. He gestures for Harry to sit down. “Take a seat, Potter, we’ve got a lot of work to do.”
A month, by some incredible stroke of good luck that must’ve been looking for someone else when it hit Harry, turns out to be not so much a month as three weeks. Granted, Harry still spends those weeks slithering miserably through the rainforests of Guatemala, thinking about the words
“I haven’t come to
“Harry,” he says, punctuating it with an actual thrust, a monstrous out-and-in.
Harry-in-the-present feels all the blood rush to his face, heady with voyeuristic arousal as Harry-in-the-past comes with a noise like the opposite of a shout, all the sound rushing back into his body. A moment later, Draco-in-the-past drops a kiss on his Harry’s hip, humming, and murmurs, “I always knew you could come on just my fingers. You’ve got that look about you.”

, like someone’s shoved a rod up his spine. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
He can’t make out what he’s saying, since he’s speaking at a normal volume, but he knows the cadence, the tone. Before his mind can catch up, his body acts on instinct, leaving his blanket by the edge of the roof to race back into the stairwell, down one narrow creaking flight—and when he rounds the corner to the second, he freezes.
Harry pauses for a moment on the threshold, staring at the bed with its pretentious silk hangings. It’s still unmade, and it’s easy enough to imagine Malfoy slipping out of it not that long ago—rolling over, stretching, waking up by degrees. Harry wonders if the sheets are still warm. He wonders if Malfoy would let him climb in again if he asked, if he would lie on top of him and hold his face and call him

Harry nods. He pulls the two vials out of his pocket and holds them out to Draco for inspection. Draco takes them, his touch very careful even though a moment ago he’d been attempting to scour his knee down to the bone. “I thought you said three were missing,” he says.
He gets Harry’s arm around his shoulders; vaguely, Harry is aware of walking deeper into the building, past more beaded curtains, through a hazy miasma of moans and
“I used to dream about you,” he confesses, without deciding to. “He would’ve seen that, too.”
Spurred by righteous fury, he summons Draco’s clothes down the stairs and dresses as quietly as possible, then pulls on his robes from yesterday—banished, apparently, to hang themselves neatly on the coatrack—and Apparates to the offices of the
“Fancy telling me how?” Malfoy asks.
“Yes, Potter, hello,” says Blaise Zabini, sounding bored. He’s wearing something that’s almost a kimono, sheer and clinging to his body. He pours a glass of deep purple liquor and drapes himself across a plush chaise, where Harry can see literally every inch of him. “It’s been a while, et cetera, you look awful, I look fantastic, can we just get on with whatever it is and leave the small talk to the regular people?”
“I know you Gryffindors love to rush out and get yourselves killed, Potter,” Malfoy informed him, sweeping through the halls of the Ministry in a very elegent aubergine coat, “but I’ve been hired to do a job, and I’m not going to do it badly just because you’re a champion whinger.”

on fire, thankfully, but Ginny has invited herself and Hermione to tea, which considering the massive Malfoy-bestowed hickey Harry’s got on his chest might turn out to be rather the same thing.
Rita blinks at him for a moment, then grins ruefully and shakes her head. “No, not a chance. Scandal
Draco comes inside him with a sound like a sob.
Harry’s never been very good at saying what he means. He’s better with actions. So he doesn’t try to say anything else. He pulls Draco back into the study, into the real world, and holds him for as long as Draco will let him.
Harry wants to brace against the bookshelf and fuck himself back on Draco’s cock, but whatever strain of Futortentia he inhaled is making him feel weak and lazy and insatiable, so he just hangs his head—at least until Draco gets a hand around his throat, palm flat and warm, pulling his head back up.
The photo closest his bedroom, one of him with the Weasleys at Christmas, first or second year, is burnt beyond repair, half the inhabitants gone and the other half sobbing inconsolably in the unruined part of the Burrow’s kitchen. Harry stands for a long moment just holding it, feeling it acutely—the loss of his flat which though it wasn’t much, was certainly home, more than any other place but Hogwarts had ever been home. He wants to get mad about it, because anger is useful, anger can be turned into energy, but all he can muster is an unmoored sort of sadness, a floating, itchy grief.
, the first time he’d heard Malfoy’d gone on to become one of the foremost Legilimens in Britain; later he’d learned through the grapevine (mostly Ron complaining loudly at the pub) that Malfoy wasn’t just a consultant for the DMLE, he also worked with MACUSA in New York, the French

” Hermione says, with a performative shudder. Like Harry didn’t spend the last of his teenage years hearing about what her and Ron got up to in excruciating detail, often with accompanying hand motions. “What do you want to do, then, Harry? We can sue her, file an injunction to stop the printing—”
“Ah,” Zabini says, leaning back with his hands folded over his stomach. “Having trouble with the reintegration?”
Draco doesn’t answer. He takes the other ring carefully from Harry’s palm—his dad’s ring, James’ ring—and slips it onto Harry’s third finger. It takes a bit of doing, Harry’s apparently got bigger knuckles than his dad did, but it’s actually not that bad of a fit. The moment it’s on his finger Harry feels
Ginny ignores him. “Rita Skeeter’s writing a book about you, and it’s coming out in a week. She’s kept the whole thing very hush-hush, but she contacted one of the other Harpies for comment, and Stacie told Gwenog, and Gwenog told me, and I Floo’d my agent. Apparently it’s some sort of tell-all.”
Kreacher, because he wishes he could murder Harry but is prevented by the magic of the house, cooks him a bowl of very watery cheese pasta and levitates it ominously up to Harry’s room like a strange ghost. Harry’s not really bothered—he’s too hungry to care much what he’s eating and he’s seen much worse than a ghostly pasta bowl—so he wolfs it down in about thirty seconds while he’s rummaging around in his enlarged robe pockets looking for his Pensieve. It takes him a while to find it, and once he does it takes him a while to maneuver it out, knocking down what sounds like a stack of china as he does, until the big ugly bowl is sitting on the desk in front of him.

him—he wants Draco to ruin him, he wants to be held down and made to take it, kissed and touched and wound slowly excruciatingly tighter until he comes dry.
He wants to go to the Manor. He doesn’t know why (he ought to know why, he thinks, he’s missing something huge here) but all he wants in this moment is to talk to Malfoy. For Malfoy to roll his eyes and say,
Harry takes it. They lean forward again, and in the next moment they’re standing outside on the Manor lawn. It’s spring, the air light and fragrant, flowers in full bloom. A Draco who looks to be no older than four or five—baby fat on his face, cheeks ruddy, in herringbone shorts and green knee-high socks—is trying to get a broom off the ground. As they stand watching in silence, he very nearly succeeds. He gets a good six feet into the air before he starts wobbling; Harry lurches forward as if to catch him, but his Draco grabs his arm and holds him back.
Harry scowled. He was doing a lot of scowling lately, and most of it was to cover up that somewhere in the last seven years his childhood hatred of Malfoy had turned into something alarmingly hungry. He did very much want to be tied up by Malfoy, actually, but he didn’t think it would be helpful to say so, unless it threw Malfoy off his game enough that Harry could—but no, probably not. Probably it would only make Malfoy look at him coldly some more, and say
“Like you want to be destroyed,” Malfoy purrs. “Like you need someone to take you apart.”

Harry is faintly alarmed to discover that his cock, smeared all over with his own come, is already hardening again.
“What?” Ron says, in the long silence. “Don’t tell me you’re serious.”
memories, not yours. They’ll have come from a foreign source, genuinely.” He stops, looking unsure of himself for the first time since he began. “It won’t be perfect, of course,” he says. “They’ll feel like something you read in a book, or saw on stage—not something that happened to you. But you’ll remember, and you won’t risk killing yourself trying to get them back in.”
His mind is rearranging itself like the Hogwarts stairs, things slotting into place and others getting knocked out—the vial he chose must have been Sirius’ funeral, because all he can see is the empty coffin, a looping photograph of his godfather’s face, Lupin looking drawn and ill with his hand tight on Harry’s shoulder. He sits down hard on the bathroom floor, amid the cold tile and the dust, no towels on the rack, no toothbrush by the sink, the light flickering overhead. Grief yawns open in his chest like looking over the edge of something dark and bottomless, and his head is pounding so bad, vision so blurry, that he lurches for the toilet and vomits again, even though there’s nothing in his stomach.
memory anymore. It was introduced to her mind as a foreign element, as something new—something that had happened to someone else, maybe.”
Ron looks like he’s passing a particularly large and unruly kidney stone, but he reaches out to clap Harry manfully on the shoulder. “Well. I’m glad you’re happy, mate. We were getting worried there, for a while—you know, that you’d never find someone.”
Malfoy stares at him for another minute. If Harry hadn’t spent the last few weeks—the last decade of his life, if he’s being honest—obsessing over his face, he wouldn’t be able to tell that he’s conflicted. His expression is a perfect mask. But Harry knows him, so he can tell.
“I am
“Oh.” Rita deflates. “Well then, you can just go. The biography is
Rita’s mouth shuts with a snap.
“I won’t call a DMLE raid on this place, how’s that?” Harry cuts in, before Malfoy can answer. “I saw at least three illicit potions on my way in here, and I’m willing to bet that’s not all there is.”
At the Manor he finds Draco covered in dirt in the garden, chasing down a bunch of butt-naked garden gnomes with a sack and a pair of heavy-duty gardening gloves. It’s so incongruous a sight, so unexpected and endearing, that Harry stops for a minute on the porch just to watch him, feeling like his heart is much too big for his chest.
“Er,” Harry says, “maybe?”
“Are you using the royal ‘we’?” Harry asks.
, I want to kiss him.
“And the first one?” Malfoy asks. His voice is pinched, alarmed. “How long ago did you start this nonsense?”
It was a good thing it was just a Stinging Hex, because the wizard who’d shot it off had juiced it with much more power than it needed. As a result Harry hit the floor in a very undignified manner and spent the next five or so minutes staring at the ceiling with tears in his eyes commenting, “Ow,” to a vast number of people who stopped by to see if he was alright.
“Right,” Harry says again, manfully silencing the piece of himself that wants Malfoy to hold him and pet his hair. It’s a big task, given that it’s an alarmingly big piece, but he manages, and when he does he draws each of the vials out of his pocket, one by one, and sets them out on the bureau.
So Harry tells him. “I realized I was in love with you,” he says, scooping the words out of his chest. “And I knew it was too soon. That it might always be too soon, that you might not want that at all…”
escaping down the hall, and Harry has no choice but to follow him like a dog on a leash.
dinner?!
it trills.
Until: “I want to show you something,” he says, when they’re back in the study.
He looks…He looks like he belongs in one of those books back in Zabini’s library, pleasured sighs, heavenly lighting, kissed-red lips, eyes drowsily lidded. Harry really, genuinely can’t help kissing him again, and again, and again, Draco coming gradually awake underneath him like he’s kissing the life back into his body, hands coming to the sides of Harry’s face and then to the backs of his shoulders, his lips getting with the program. He reaches between them and takes hold of Harry’s cock, forgotten but so hard now it’s almost painful; “Perfect,” he murmurs, breaking away to kiss Harry’s ear while Harry hides his face in his shoulder, “perfect, turtle, you were made for me, you’re always going to be mine, I’m going to give you exactly what you need—” and Harry sucks in a sharp breath, tensing over him and around him, where his softening cock is still nestled inside, and comes all over his stomach.
Harry’s stomach lurches. “Draco—” he starts.
Harry makes a hamstrung sound.
Harry didn’t care—well, he was livid that Choudhury got off so easy, but other than that what mattered to him was that Malfoy hadn’t got hit. It wouldn’t have done any real damage, and Malfoy would’ve probably taken Choudhury down with grace and some of that nasty wit, but Harry discovered, lying there on the floor of the Ministry with his arse and most of his back and his thighs throbbing with heat, that the affront to Malfoy’s pride would’ve been—terrible. Awful. Because Malfoy’s pride wasn’t about being better than people, not anymore. It was about being
Harry doesn’t fight it as Draco pulls his shirt over his head for him, as he helps him wriggle into the pants and the trousers and a thick pair of socks. He’s been freezing since he got back to London, and it’s a relief to finally be warm.
“Ex-chaser for the Harpies,” Ginny tells her, but she’s making significant eyes at Harry over Hermione’s shoulder.
“Because your mind hasn’t had time to re-form around the absences,” Malfoy says, like Harry is a particularly unintelligent child. “It’s like a broken bone. If you set it wrong, it will grown back wrong.”
Let it blow over, she says, but Harry wonders if this sort of thing ever really blows over. It’s going to be in a book, on a shelf, available for anyone to read, for the rest of his life. All those parts of himself that only Ginny was ever supposed to know; that only the person who shares his bed is supposed to know.
Neither of them are all the way hard yet, but Draco’s hard enough to nestle his cock past Harry’s rim. Harry rocks gently, feeling Draco come to full hardness inside of him, growing and growing until he’s nestled right up against that spot inside Harry that lights up the base of his skull.
“Take out everything about Draco Malfoy,” Harry cuts in, voice hard, “and I’ll let you see the memory of when Voldemort killed me.”
A wall of water slams down from the ceiling, drenching him and turning the entire flat into a waste of soggy black char. “Fuck,” he says again, this time pushing wet hair out of his face, extraordinarily unhappy.
Harry made a marked effort not to start any fights, after that. But he couldn’t exactly admit to Malfoy that he had portions of memory missing because he
“So needy,” Draco murmurs, close by Harry’s ear, but then he breathes a charm Harry’s heard him use to open his trousers before, stepping in even closer so that Harry can feel the hot line of his cock through silk pants. “I’ll give it to you, Harry, I’ll take care of you, don’t worry.”
Luckily, he finds thirteen of his sixteen vials scattered around the room. He must have knocked them loose with the overenthusiastic
odes.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says. He’s still standing in the doorway, his hair sticking up in all directions, dazed even though he didn’t sleep a wink last night after leaving the Manor. “How can she write a book about me without even talking to me?”
, so of course we have to adjust our expectations to account for—”
He stands over her shoulder while she makes the changes, then marches her down to the Ministry in her pajamas to swear an Unbreakable Oath before the notary in the Aurors’ office. It takes the better part of a day, but by the time Harry leaves her flat he’s got two silvery vials tucked in his inner robes pocket, and Rita Skeeter can only print anything about him and Draco, in any context, on pain of death.
Harry tries very carefully to think of nothing at all, to let Malfoy look at whatever he likes, but there’s a large part of him that can’t get over the irony of this—of inviting his greatest childhood nemesis (well,
“But it’s true,” Draco contends, cradling Harry’s head back against his shoulder with his hand still wrapped over his throat, chest pressed flush to Harry’s back, only his hips moving. “You were made for me, turtle, Harry, sweetheart—”
The t-shirt and pajama trousers he’s wearing are brand new. They haven’t even been washed yet, because all his clothes burned to a crisp and they banished the ones he wore to Guatemala—Draco’s clothes—at St. Mungo’s. He’s sleeping on his married friends’ couch because he hasn’t got a bed. He can hear them puttering about in the other room, carrying out all the little domestic rituals to get ready for bed, talking about him, maybe, or about the baby. In here he feels very alone.
He shrugs, unsure how to finish.
is here, not down in the Wizengamot office like she’s meant to be, and if anyone’s going to catch him at it, it’s going to be her.
Harry looks out through the pass-through window into the living room, where Draco is inspecting the magical pull-out couch in much the same manner one would inspect a dead rat in the yard. “I’m not being mind controlled,” he says. “I think I’ve been in love with him since I figured out what my cock was for, actually.”
“—I want to keep you. Will you let me?”
because his face and neck suddenly feel very cold, but then Draco kisses the base of his spine, just above his arse, moving his own sweater out of the way to do it, and Harry feels a bead of precome weep out his cock, and he thinks: oh, fuck, I love him.
No one does, though. And Hermione’s watching him expectantly, so he says, “I’m staying at the Manor.”
He knew, in some dark and removed corner of his mind, where cobwebs were growing and he rarely went, that Malfoy wasn’t taking him back to the Manor only for a cooling poultice—that somehow in the course of shouting at him and chasing him out of memories of quidditch and nightmares, Hagrid and the Weasleys, somehow by stepping in front of a Stinging Hex like a total idiot, Harry had managed to admit, subconsciously and without words, that there was not one single part of Malfoy's body he did not want to put his mouth all over.
, Harry thinks as he follows him through the dark, smoky halls of the club, among other uncharitable thoughts. The furnishings are all dark wood, the hangings crimson, and behind beaded curtains are shadowy, entwined forms whose low, desperate noises Harry tries hard not to hear. He wishes he’d had the foresight to drink some Polyjuice, or at least bring his cloak along—if there’s not something about him being here in the
How lovely it would be, Harry thinks, to be known without having to speak at all.
“—an absolutely enormous hero complex and enduring delusions of martyrdom—”
Granted, he’s not in the building at the time, but what wakes him—slumped over at his desk in the DMLE—is his wand glowing red-hot in his pocket, alerting him to the fact that someone’s been mucking about in his wards. He races down to the lobby half-awake and Apparates with a crack into the middle of his flat, which is burning.
Harry shrugs. “Of what I might do, I guess.”
“Don’t be dramatic,” Harry says, but he hasn’t, actually, forgotten who he’s talking to, so he spends the next ten minutes explaining, trailing after Draco as he goes bustling about the gardening shed and then striding through the Manor up to the master bath, where he flings all his clothes onto the floor and sets about casting
authorized for a reason, I don’t need your approval—”
“I’ll do my utmost,” Malfoy says, after a moment. “In the meantime, try not to make it worse.”
“Honestly, Potter, I’m not sure what your problem is,” he says, when Harry expresses shock and anger at having Apparated into a crowd of mostly-naked people without warning, “it’s not as if he’s a
going round to the pub with some of the other Aurors, but most of them kept their heads down during the war—didn’t even
“Don’t say that,” Draco says, sounding a bit frantic. “Don’t fucking say that, Harry.”
Staggering, a tangle of bare feet, the bed is suddenly much too far so Harry presses Draco down into the stately leather smoking chair by the window and climbs into his lap, murmuring a loosening charm Ginny taught him as he does. “Harry,” Draco says, breathless, an expression on his face like he’s staring up at fireworks, witnessing a miracle, but he doesn’t have a chance to say anything else before Harry sinks onto him.
Harry thought. He wouldn’t have said it, even if he could’ve.
“Duty calls, I suppose,” Draco says dryly. He’s sitting at the head of the table, legs crossed, long thin feet outfitted in plush house slippers, reading the
“No,” Draco says. “I put your memories in my mind, and pull them out again. Then we go into them together. Your mind will see them as
” he blurts. “How long since you took these out?”
“I thought we were pretending that didn’t happen,” Malfoy snaps. He sighs, dropping his pince-nez down on its chain so he can rub his eyes, then says with less vitriol, “I would’ve guessed you’d take that memory out.”
Would it have been the sort of party with kids? Would Draco have been down here, tumbling with the other children on the lawn, his mother catching him by the elbow as he tore past, scolding him not to ruin his robes? Or would he have been relegated to the house, haunting the kitchens, maybe, sneaking away with a tray of tiny cakes (Harry, when he imagines the childhood he might’ve had with his real parents, mostly thinks of cake), watching the musical hubbub of the party out the window of the room Harry slept in last night, gossipping with the snakes.
“You’re not special, Potter,” Kingsley informed him, not looking up from the file he had open on his desk.
A whispered
“Right,” Harry says, not wanting to talk. He takes one look at the address and Disapparates.
“That was idiotic, Potter,” Malfoy informed him. “His aim was awful, he’d have missed both of us.”
The morning after he leaves Malfoy in bed, memory of his second and third orgasms stored neatly away in his safe, Harry wakes to someone pounding on the door like the building’s on fire. He mutters a quick spell as he levers himself out of bed, sending all the scraps of paper taped up around his flat skittering into hiding, and makes it to the door just as the last
, Harry means to say, but words have started not-quite-working even more than usual, and his spine feels deliciously melty and hot. He barely manages to stagger back against the wall before he goes oozing to the ground.
Harry’s rough fingers skating over pale skin, faint silver scars. Malfoy humming beneath him like a panther.
His fingers move inside Harry again, just slightly. Harry wants to swear at him for something—the overstimulation, the smug look on his face, the crime of being so good in bed and also
tell him!”
Malfoy looks a little startled. He also looks very regal in the velvet house coat he’s wearing, now that Harry has a chance to notice, like the heir to some nineteenth-century nation-state. He looks warm, and competent, and Harry wants to bound up the stairs and slide his arms around his waist and bury his face in his neck, but instead he says, “I need your help, Malfoy.”
“Blaise gave me the seed of the idea, of course. That business with the born-again virgin, Bridget Baddock—the only way he could get the memories to re-integrate was to go in there with her, to overwrite them, in a way. Now she remembers
It’s written on Draco’s face as well, he realizes.
Harry would tense, probably, if they were in real life. He’d deflect. But the hazy quality of memory has made him feel loose and calm, so he answers. “They did so much for me," he says. "They shouldered so much for me. It’s not fair to ask them to deal with that sort of thing on top of it all. Not when it’s supposed to be over.” He shifts, restless again, leaning his chair back onto two legs. “Besides, it’s not as if I was sick, or hurt. I was just…”
and physical beatings and starvation.
“Harry?” Draco says, tentative.
She’ll always be a part of him, Harry thinks. Obviously she will. She was his first everything—first love, first time, first love lost. She put her fingers in him when he asked even though she didn’t really see the appeal, went out and bought a “Real Thing” strap-on at a wizarding sex shop; she was his partner in crime for so many years, sly knowing smiles exchanged over dinner at the Burrow, pick-up quidditch on Sunday morning, waging a years-long war of which-is-the-better-takeaway over the Thai restaurant on the corner and the Indian place on the next street. As much as he doesn’t really trust her not to hurt him, anymore, he does trust her with this.
Harry knocks his head against the wall, the snap-out-of-it effect slightly ruined by the fact that the wall is rotted out and soggy, and then Apparates to Grimmauld Place.
They wander mildly through Harry’s less dramatic vials, lingering at the back of the jostling Christmas-shopping crowd to watch that awkward moment with Cho, listening to Ginny’s shrill accusations ring through Diagon Alley.
Harry’d done his best, though, to get rid of the stuff that really plagued him, that made it hard for him to function. Dumbledore’s death. Sirius’. Cedric Diggory’s. His own. The Inferi. The Battle. A few funerals—Sirius’, Fred’s, Remus and Tonks’. Some things that embarrassed him, too, those quiet mortifications that bit his feet in the black insomniac hours of the night: Ginny yelling up and down Diagon Alley during their breakup, airing all of their dirty laundry, a fight so apocalyptic that it ended up not only in the
The issue is decided for him when Ron and Hermione arrive, laden with bags from Mme Malkin’s and the Gap. They’re talking to each other in low voices as they come through the door, windswept and harried. Hermione under her knit dress is starting to actually look pregnant, and the emotions Harry feels when he notices are complicated—happiness, of course, because he knows they’ll be great parents, he knows how much they’ve been wanting this, but also a sick sort of anticipation, a souring of the simple, familiar contentment he normally feels when he sees them, because he knows that with every day that passes they’re only going to drift further away.
he’s dealing with, of course he could be that stupid. “
Harry might not remember the very end of his and Ginny’s relationship, but he remembers the rest. He remembers the first wobbly, unfamiliar days in sixth year, finding their legs together like newborn foals—the growing pains of life after the war, how she spent weeks resenting him after Fred’s death, how she’d cried most of the way through that first year even when they were making love, the bubbly happiness of coming back from tryouts for the Harpies with a letter of commitment to bear Harry down onto the couch in their flat and kiss him and kiss him. He’d been ecstatic at first, ecstatic for her, ecstatic that everything was falling neatly into place, like he’d expected it to, like he knew it was supposed to.
They tumble into a dim, deserted room—one with a door instead of a curtain, a door that Draco pulls closed behind them, pointing his wand at the lock with a quick
Harry turns back to face her, wrestling down a swell of hatred. “No,” he says. “I’ve come to negotiate.”
Harry’s whole body is shaking. He’s so turned on just from Draco pressing against him that he thinks he’d probably come if he looked at him wrong,
Malfoy, because he has a magnificent scorn for what’s considered
After a minute he says, “I was having trouble sleeping. I wasn’t sleeping, really. And I was scared.”
” Harry echoes. The sun is only just now coming up; the idea that things have been happening today, before this very second, is insane and unfathomable.
“Blast,” Draco repeats. “What do you want? Zabini’s got every wizarding toy under the sun, there are about a dozen willing sacrifices in the next room, one of them’s probably got red hair—”
Harry shakes his head, not quite awake enough to joke. He unties the drawstring on the bag and tips two copper bands out onto his palm. One is small, thin. The other is thicker, a man’s ring. They’ll probably have to transfigure them. He hopes Draco doesn’t mind.
“No,” Harry says, feeling ill. “No, I didn’t know what it was. Did you think I did? And you let me—?”
Malfoy doesn’t waste time. He aims his wand at Harry and says, “
“Potter,” Draco starts.
Then Draco seizes him by the front of his robes and bears him back, their feet tangling together, stumbling, against a bookshelf. “Tell me what you want,” he says, voice low and private between them. “I’ll give you anything you want.”
Harry shouldn’t have brought it up, he shouldn’t have—but a hand slides down his back, fingertips dancing over his shoulder blades like raindrops, and Draco asks, teasing, “What sort of dreams were these?”
The door swings open.
and can it please not be for the reason he thinks it is.
Never in his life has Harry come three times in one night—not even when Ginny convinced him to go to that thing with all the Holyhead Harpies—and by the time Malfoy gets him there again, what feels like several sweaty hours later (Harry sobbing and exhausted like he’s running a marathon and Malfoy murmuring like a devil as his fingers rub inside him, “Look at you, Harry, so needy”—shifting on the bed, coming up on his elbows for leverage—“I’ll give you what you need,” with a surprising, tender kiss to Harry’s knee, “I’ll give you what you need, turtle”) all Harry can manage is an explosive shout and a few sad dribbles of come.
didn’t break into Harry’s flat—”
“Are you sure?” Draco asks. “I thought maybe we could do it back at the Manor…”
After a while they do manage to get control of themselves. Draco climbs off Harry and straightens his clothes while Harry tries to pretend he hasn’t got a raging boner, then brings out the Pensieve so they can get to work.
I can’t

“Here we are,” Malfoy tells him, then nods to a stone-faced bouncer and slips into a room marked
Harry sits up straighter at the word
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione says, squeezing his shoulder, “our guest room’s always open. Well—I suppose we’ll have to turn it into a nursery eventually. But until then.”
Goosebumps break out on his skin as Draco stares at him. He unclasps his robes and lets them fall to the floor, then toes out of his shoes and knees up onto the bed with Harry, both shuffling back awkwardly until Harry’s propped up against the pillows with Draco straddling him.
Harry laughs. “Not that kind.”
Draco makes a short noise of acknowledgement.
The door behind them bangs open. Harry barely has time to register a woman’s voice—a familiar voice, a voice that once saved his life—before Narcissa Malfoy rushes past them in a whirlwind of silken robes and white hair. She kicks off her high heeled shoes on the edge of the porch and goes barefoot into the grass, at her son’s side in a moment. Harry can’t make out many words; that’s what happens, with a memory this old. But he watches Draco cling to her and cry, watches her heal his scraped knee and soothe her hand over his hair, murmuring nothing words, calling him
“There’s an instruction manual?”
s, the short cut-off sounds of people getting fucked, but the architecture seems to have taken on a shape that’s impossible, carpeted floors sloping up and down like steep hills, brilliant daylight shining through one of the curtains, the colors of the beads refracted and dancing on the far wall. They pass an honest-to-God centaur, hunching to keep from hitting his head on the ceiling, and what Harry thinks based on his admittedly limited experience must be a Veela, dressed mystifyingly in a lot of very tiny silver bells and nothing else.

He ends up sitting mostly-naked on the front staircase as the coffee tray floats breakfast accommodatingly to him from the east sitting room, flipping through it. The idea of actually

“What are you doing?” he asks.
“Also,” Ron says, when Hermione’s done answering all the normal questions that Harry doesn’t know to ask (how far along are you, do you know the sex, have you got names picked out), “I checked out St. Mungo’s to see if anyone came in last night with burns from a ward fire.”
Malfoy’s still breathing hard. He raises his head, hums, drops a lazy kiss on Harry’s hip. “I always knew you could come on just my fingers,” he murmurs. “You’ve got that look about you.”
“Well, she’s talking to some people who might actually know something,” Ginny says. “Zacharias Smith, we think one of the Patil twins, Rebecca Roslyn—”
Across an impossible Grecian courtyard, sunset red and liquid overhead, into a darker, quieter corridor, seaside breeze balmy and gentle on their skin, and Harry can’t take it anymore—he steers them sideways into a wall, takes Draco’s face in his hands, and kisses him.
Malfoy stares at him. Then he looks down at the vials. Then he goes back to staring at Harry, like he’s trying to work out if Harry could
tomorrow, he’ll eat his boot.
“Ginny’s right,” he says, clearing his throat. He picks up his tea and drains half of it decisively, not stopping when he finds it still-scalding, then puts it back down and wipes his mouth. “Let it blow over. It’ll be fine.”
He can feel come dripping down his shin from where Malfoy rutted off against him, and privately he’s having a very difficult time convincing himself it’s not the hottest thing that’s ever happened to him.
They cross through a room full of velvet futons and people doing ridiculous things like eating grapes from each other’s fingers, Amortentia’s lustier cousin
“You—?” Harry asks, stunned, turning to him. “That first night?”
he can manage.
Harry shrugs. “I dunno. The last one maybe six months ago?” He neglects to mention the memory he remembers removing two nights previously. Until he finds out if it’s one of the vials here, or one of the vials that’s been stolen, he doesn’t see any reason to raise the issue.
“What’s she know about Harry?” Hermione asks innocently.
“You came for me,” Harry says, still sort of dumbstruck. “You navigated Muggle London for me.”
Gradually and then all at once, Harry loses his battle with propriety. “Yes,” he says, with enough force that it comes out sounding sort of angry, and grabs Draco and pulls him down hard, so that they’re all tangled together in the sheets, in their clothes, “yes, Draco, yes,” kissing him over and over, fervently, and eventually Draco loses his vest and his belt and the fire sputters low in the hearth, and eventually again—kisses growing longer and longer, obscenely luxurious—they slip down a slow, shallow ramp into sleep.
Malfoy strolls across the room, helps himself to a glass of purple liquor and begins casually: “I’ve got a case with the Auror’s office.”

There’s still tenderness there, though, as he presses his forehead against Harry’s and murmurs, “
Zabini looks at his old Slytherin mate, delighted. “So you
His cock finds that spot that makes Harry’s vision light up like fireworks, and Harry nearly swallows his own tongue with how fast he comes.
It’s from Ginny.
His glasses squish awkwardly between them, but nothing in the world has ever mattered less. Draco makes an intent noise against his mouth, fingertips digging into his sides, and opens for him, letting Harry bite him and press him back into the wall and
“We thought you were joking!” Ron exclaims, looking to his wife for support.
Harry bristles more than a little, and speeds up to walk closer to Malfoy’s shoulder. The prize is
, somehow. Held. Kept.
. Instead, he seized Malfoy by the lapels and kissed him.
“That’s marvelous,” Harry says, brain finally catching up with the conversation. “That’s, I mean—” he stands, pulling Hermione into a hug, “congratulations, guys, really.”
He’s got no intention of actually
Shit.
,” Draco says again, and then a bit desperately, “Sweetheart.”
He was also unreasonably gorgeous, like a drawing of a fairy in a children’s storybook, and he dressed like he’d stepped neatly out of the eighteenth century, pocket watch and pince-nez and collars that buttoned up to his chin, and sometimes Harry caught himself staring at him—not at any piece of him in particular, just the proud, strong lines of the whole, the capable way he held himself, speaking with an Auror on their way out of a session or marching down to the holding cells for an interrogation or standing with his back to Harry in the training room, pulling thought after filament silvery thought from his head and letting them fall gently to the Pensieve.
Harry tosses and turns. Around one in the morning he wakes from a dream about Voldemort, and it takes him a good half an hour to convince himself that he killed him—that it’s not a mind trick, just because he remembers the aftermath but not the actual killing.
“Really?” Draco worms his way down underneath him, so they’re face-to-face. He’s blurry, Harry’s glasses are sitting on his nightstand, but it’s clear enough that he’s grinning. “I had plenty of those kind.”
Harry meets Ginny’s eyes. It will be a bigger news story if he sues, it will confirm that what’s in the book is true, and it will make it worse for her. Right now she’s just a side note in a tell-all rag about her ex-boyfriend, but if he starts dragging everyone in and out of the Ministry, sitting them down to hearings…
He thought maybe he would’ve gotten out of those, having been cleared for field work and all, but he can’t say he’s too put out to have to keep going. After all, the moment he’s inside the room, Draco steers him into his chair and helps himself to a seat on his lap.

Draco’s hands run over his back, over his shoulders to hold his head gently, thumbs stroking the shells of his ears. “Harry,” he says, between kisses, “just a bit further, darling, come along—” and then he darts out from beneath Harry’s next attack,
For a long while, Harry stares up at the pretentious silk hangings on Malfoy’s bed—the master bed in the master bedroom at bloody
“How strong was that Futortentia?” he asks conversationally, when Harry’s spent.
Futortentia isn’t as strong as Amortentia, Harry knows—it can’t make you want things you wouldn’t normally want. It only makes you want them more—more urgently, more desperately. A wizard, for instance, who wants to know what sex is like with a mermaid will still want to know what sex is like with a mermaid, he’ll just want to take his sweet time finding out; a wizard who only loves one man will still only love one man, he’ll just want to make love to him for hours, extravagantly, insatiably, hungrily.
“Me too,” Harry admits.
Malfoy clears his throat, studiously avoiding Harry’s gaze. “They’ve got a suspect in custody, but I’m having some trouble interrogating him. There are blank spots in his memory, pieces he took out. Now, we’ve got the pieces, but—”
Harry’s saved from having to answer—better late than never—by Justin Finch-Fletchley sticking his head around the corner from Kingsley’s office to shout, “Oi, Potter! Get in here!”
, amongst a multitude of smaller sins. “Ah—No idea,” he lies, out loud.
Draco’s breath catches again. “I know what you need, Harry,” he says. “Don’t worry, I know exactly what you need…”
” Harry began to insist, at the very moment that someone muttered a particularly nasty Stinging Hex somewhere behind him and to the left.
“You hate it,” Draco reiterates, and this time Harry doesn’t argue. He
Draco has figured out how to get Harry’s brain to accept his wayward memories without rejecting them—“Because I am brilliant and deserving of every award wizarding England could possibly bestow,” according to him—and as he spills each of Harry’s vials carefully into the Pensieve, he explains:
There’s a light on in the study, the door cracked just a bit. Harry slides out of bed, feeling some invisible string pulling him towards Draco, but stops in his tracks halfway there.

Tears stream down Harry’s face. “Don’t,” he says, voice strangled. “Don’t say that.”
Harry shakes his head. “Can you—” he puts his fingers against his temple.

Draco’s grip tightens. “I added you to the
him to leave, per se. He’d rather he could do something like get down on one knee, or abduct Malfoy to his flat in Diagon Alley, where he could putter around the kitchen for the next several decades, insulting Harry’s Muggle appliances and frowning at the telly. But somehow he doesn’t think Malfoy would be amenable to either.
Malfoy moves to the bookshelf that lines the far wall, a candle floating away from Zabini’s desk to follow him. “I remember you had a party a while back—one of those born-again virgin affairs. There was a woman who wandered off without getting her memories back.”
He chugs it all in one go, alcohol burning in his chest, and as the empty teacup floats itself back to its saucer, he finds Draco frowning at him from the end of the table.
He guides Harry forward, one hand buried in the mess of his hair, and kisses him.
That’s a good one, isn’t it, ’Mione?”
He lets out a shuddering breath, starting to say something, not sure what.
As soon as they’re alone, Draco takes Harry’s head in his hands and kisses him. “I’m sorry,” he says, tight against Harry’s mouth, as they stagger back toward the bed. “I didn’t hear you were back until an hour ago, and your ridiculous bloody friends have got a Muggle address—”
Any other case, he’d take his frustration out on the work, but Kingsley had asked expressly for him not to do that thing he did in Romania—id est, not to lose his top entirely at all the waiting and wrap the whole thing up himself. Apparently cutting off the Guatemalan contingent of this ring will send all their people in England running underground, and while Harry knows that makes sense, he’d really rather storm their headquarters wands-blazing than spend all this time slinking about in Animagus form, gossipping with boa constrictors.
had portions of memory missing—that they were sitting in his safe at home, where they couldn’t terrorize him every waking moment. Malfoy might’ve signed an NDA to keep their cases confidential, but that didn’t prohibit him from reporting things to Harry’s boss, especially not things that might pose a danger in the field.
“I’m not sure what I could mean by ‘a month’ other than
“These were my parents’,” Harry tells him. He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand. It’s a thin hand, thin fingers, delicate bones. On a whim he tries his mother’s ring. It fits. “They’re not magical rings, or anything,"  he says. "They’re just normal. But I—if it’s alright with you—I’d really like for us to wear them.”
he wants to say,
“He was wearing one of Draco’s sweaters,” Hermione says. “It wasn’t a huge leap.”
The matter isn’t helped by the fact that he hates being in his snake form. When Kingsley’s predecessor, Robards, had asked Harry to become an Animagus, back when every decision from the Head Auror seemed to be some sort of crazy last-ditch effort to actually solve cases, he’d agreed mostly because he’d been expecting to turn out as a stag, like his dad, or at least a bloody big dog like Sirius. The first time he’d actually managed a transformation, after a month of carrying a mandrake leaf around under his tongue, he’d changed back immediately and spent the next week or so getting blindingly drunk at a string of Muggle pubs across London.
When he comes round a couple of hours later, lying in the closed DMLE ward with one other Auror whose whole head is swaddled in foul-smelling bandages, he’s in the sort of pain that makes it difficult to know whether he wants to get pissed or never get within twenty paces of firewhiskey ever again.

“KREACHER!” he bellows, the moment he’s over the threshold. He doesn’t like Kreacher sneaking up on him any more than Kreacher likes being snuck up on, and he’s found the best way to avoid both is to move around with the approximate noise level of a herd of blast-ended skrewts.
She has, Harry thinks as an ocean of rage bears down on him, conveniently left out the fact that he’s in love.
burned your flat down?” he says incredulously, when Harry’s finished.
It was nothing that he needed to do his job, when it came down to it, and so Kingsley didn’t need to know, and neither did Malfoy.
“Potter?” Malfoy says, at the top of the stairs. “What are you doing in my house?”
“She hasn’t worked here in a long time,” the man reminds Harry nervously, as he scrawls out the address on a scrap of parchment, dabs it with blotting paper, and hands it over. “Not since that business with the Triwizard. She was lucky she didn’t end up in Azkaban, being an unregistered Animagus, but they told her she could never work in journalism again. Revoked her press credentials.”

, and take Harry into bed and let Harry lie awake tracing his scars, kissing each one, like he did between the first orgasm and the rest of the night that he can’t remember, and—
“Alright,” Draco says. He takes Harry’s face in his hands, smoothing his hair back, and bends to kiss him on the forehead. “As long as you’re sure.”
It’s not enough, though, not nearly enough, and Harry manages to get out, “Draco,
she’s yelling, as they lounge on Harry’s neighbor’s minuscule balcony, Draco leaning against the brick wall, Harry kicking his trainers up on the rail.
“That too,” Draco agrees, and draws out to thrust savagely into him again.
Instead he stays standing. “Someone did a good enough job breaking into my flat that they set the whole place on fire,” he says, “and made off with a few of the, uh, vials I had stashed away. I figure I should probably…put the rest back. You know, for safety.”
