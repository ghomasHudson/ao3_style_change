Tom gently turned his son until his eyes locked with those of his future husband. Everyone who saw them in that moment shivered as their eyes flared into flames – Green for Tobias, silver for Draco. No matter how hard those watching tried, they could not pull their eyes away from the couple.
Tobias nodded. “I do like your garden, My Mother. I remember reading that poem a long time ago and it just seemed to fit.”
“How are you feeling today? I know you occasionally get bad morning sickness and I thought I’d ask,” she explained seeing their quizzical looks. “My older sister is pregnant with her third and she’s going through the same thing. She said that if you had any questions about the pregnancy experience that you didn’t feel you could ask anyone around you, then you can ask her. You don’t have to but she wanted to offer anyway.”
Draco took a deep breath. “Because Tobias has plans for us tonight – Dinner by the lake, and he revealed how he feels about me.”
Albus Dumbledore scowled at the child before him. “I deserve your respect boy,” he spat, ignoring the incredulous looks he was getting from the spectators.
Once the door had been closed, locked and set with a hex for any who tried opening it, Tobias collapsed into the seat behind him and rubbed his head. “Where they always that much of a nightmare?” he asked from within his hands. Draco only smirked and handed over a headache potion, which Tobias downed without question.
What did surprise them, however, was that one of his conquests had volunteered to carry his issue and he had accepted. It was later discovered that the woman in question and her husband had been trying for an heir since they were married and had recently discovered that the husband was infertile. The pair had approached Blaise with a proposition – he give them a child and sign the kid over to them fully and in the future, when he felt ready for an heir, the woman would do the same for him. The arrangement, though somewhat surprising, worked out well for the trio and Blaise doted on his daughter, as did the rest of The Pack.
Tobias yelped and hid his face in Draco’s neck, causing him to chuckle. The muffled, ‘I hate you’ that came from there made everyone, including the adults who had followed them, laugh.
Just as Narcissa turned away, no longer able to stand the sight of the strongest man she knows standing only because of the arms of her husband and his best friend wrapped around his waist, a brilliant blue-white light flashed and a dull THWUMP was heard.
“Strangely enough, both spell and potion were only put on one of us,” George continued, rubbing one of his temples.
“What is going on here?” Minerva barked. She was not happy about getting woken at 1:30 in the morning by her student’s shenanigans.
Hearing the pained moans coming from his husband, he stopped and moved his legs so they were around his waist and lay on him, chest to chest. Instinctually, neither moved other than Draco kissing and licking his husbands tears away, and the odd flicks of his fingers over Tobias’ nipples.
They chuckled softly as he nuzzled sleepily into Draco’s side. No one was surprised when a table filled with food appeared in the middle of the room. They were surprised by the twin growls that came from Tobias’ and Luna’s stomachs. Both of them looked down at their stomachs and blinked in shock. Ginny giggled softly when the two of them poked their stomachs and a look of awe came over Tobias’ face.
The raven-haired youth looked around the room and laughed internally. Ron was partnered with Pansy, Hermione with Blaise, Dean was with Vince and Seamus with Greg. Draco, he was annoyed to discover, was partnered by Lavender Brown, while he was partnered with Neville – who had gotten into the class due to the Headmaster’s manipulations.
Tom knew that Tobias had to be nervous. Tomorrow was New Year’s Eve, so in two nights time, he was going to be bonded. Narcissa was going to be over in the morning with the bonding robes. Tobias already had everything else ready. Sighing, Tom closed the door and walked to his room. No matter how he looked at it, he felt as if he was going to lose his son in two days’ time. He just hoped he didn’t cry, no matter how much he felt the urge to.
Severus bowed slightly. “Madam Ravenclaw. The gentleman behind me is Mr Riddle – Tobias’ adopted father – and beside him is Mrs Greengrass Snr – his personal healer. They are here to see Tobias, with your permission.”
“No – the fruit salad and yoghurt on a different plate. I may be pregnant, but I’m not craving yet!”
Tom looked up in annoyance when the doors to his library opened, only to have his heart – yes he did have one, thank you very much – leap into his mouth as he saw Severus enter.
Tobias poked at his food with a sad look on his face. Damn his Pack and their getting his hopes up for this meal. He really wanted that yummy sounding soup and while the stuff before him both looked and smelt appetizing, he was disappointed in it. A hand landed on his shoulder and he raised his head to look at them with sad eyes.
Ron whimpered when sections of brick started to tumble out of their places in the bridge and into the water that, while closer, was still far below him. “MUUUUUMMMMMMY! He yelled as the bridge section he was attached to fell. He screamed as he saw the spiders’ web full of newly hatched spiderlings speed towards him., no longer paying attention to how many times a verse was repeated and by whom. He almost fainted in relief when the now familiar voice of salvation started to sing.
“And he also believed that our Potions Professor would need you. He receive three letters this morning and looks ready to throw up,” Luna piped in.
The Death Eaters were silent as they watched the head daises. Their Lord had a sleeping teen on his lap and his fingers were running through the teen’s raven hair. They watched in silence as the teen was gently woken and place onto the chair beside their Lord. They sneered in disgust as their Lord’s heir said something with a pout and tear filled eyes.
Tobias nodded. “That is a good idea. When you wake up in the morning, I would like everyone to come down to the Chamber for breakfast. This goes for both days since we may not all be there together physically, but we can give you our encouragement before you go. I’ll tell Minnie and Flitwick that you will be ‘eating in the kitchen’ tomorrow morning. And no fighting. I don’t want anyone to cry at our first family meal.”
Lucius grinned grimly. “He is a dark wizard who healed and adopted the boy-who-lived and keeps track of where both sides of the war are at using spies whom he is willing to be questioned about under Veritaserum. He is wanted by the dark because he helped ‘the boy-who-lived’ and by the light because he ‘corrupted their Saviour’.”
Tobias sat in Severus’ private lab with a sigh of relief. It had been four days since it had been announced that he was pregnant and the only time he had any time to himself was when he was in his godfather’s private rooms. He was thankful for the other Slytherin’s but the rest of the school was driving him insane! Not to mention that the Headmaster and Madam Pomphrey kept hassling him to get a check-up with the School Matron. He sighed. He hoped that the heard from his father soon about the N.E.W.Ts. Living here was hell at the moment. He was so glad that tomorrow was Saturday.
“Grapplefang,” Tobias mused as he continued looking at Padma. “Would it be possible to change the contract without breaking it?”
Tobias nodded and began to munch on one of the items on his plate. Draco mumbled something and rose from his seat, having made up his mind to ask the man. Hopefully, he would get an answer.
Tobias walked into the common room and grinned. “Hello, my lambs. Why are we all here and not in the library?”
“Did ... Did you want to come for a walk with me tonight at midnight? I’ve never seen the gardens here, and I’d love to see them under the moon with you, just like the first date we had at Hogwarts.”
husband decided to do a runner with your child.” A flash of blue appeared in the Imposter’s eye, causing an idea to form.
“I didn’t,” Charlie snorted. “I didn’t care. To me, getting away from The Burrow was the most important thing.”
Greg, Vincent and Millicent stepped forward and picked the two boys up off the ground. When Severus appeared beside Greg – who head hold of Tobias – the boy handed his bundle to the normally dour man.
Lucius scowled at her and hit her with a silencing charm while Draco checked the fire and its content.
Tobias looked up from his writing and pouted. “But I’ve already had a 15 minute break for a mid-morning snack.”
“Is everything okay?” Minerva asked him softly. The students that had arrived after breakfast had already packed up and left for either their common room, the library or to one of the pre-approved courtyards to catch up with their friends or to continue their work.
Draco was counting down the seconds until his ancient Runes class finished. He had left his fiancé in the hands of their godfather. Severus had somehow managed to convince the other teachers into setting holiday homework. To ensure that Tobias didn’t do any of it, Sev had collected as much paperwork he could to keep him busy – Not that Tobias was upset at that.
“He doesn’t need to know that,” Tobias murmured into Draco’s neck. “Sorry for the stinging charm on the bedroom door, and the letter. I should have guessed you wouldn’t stay away without a reason.”
Draco had only just walked back into the room when his father got the first – and weakest – band off.  He watched in fascinated horror as each band broke and the magic level of the room grew til he could feel it pressing against his eardrums.
Walking into his room, he found his favourite outfit on the bed. Smiling, he changed, looking forward to later on that night.
“Yes, she did. I never thought of using Crumple-horned Snorkacks for important messages. Did she give you much trouble?”
“You wished to speak to me, but the shock of seeing Bi being affectionate distracted you for the last …” he checked the time, “forty-five minutes. Don’t worry, Sev, I put the time to good use.” He indicated the books around him.
The room was silent bar the sound of quill on parchment and the shuffling and murmuring of their professor. After listening to Severus complain under his breath, Tobias raised an arm, as if wishing to ask a question. The professor heaved an internal sigh of relief. He needed to stay busy so he didn’t get so impatient. Walking towards his two godsons, he fingered the box he had hidden in his pocket.
Tobias’ eyes widened at Draco’s words and he kept his hands where they were knowing that Draco would do it. It seemed as if Draco had discovered his biggest kink.
“Please,” Draco begged as he gently rocked in place, his voice sounding brittle and desperate from all the sounds he had been making all night. “Please, please, please.”
“What respect?” Neville murmured only just loud enough for Millicent, Pansy and Blaise to hear, causing them to snigger slightly.
The sound of chatter bought his attention to the stairs leading to the dungeons. There, walking up the stairs were the missing students and some of their parents.
Amelia, Lucius and the other Ministry workers who had volunteered to be members of the Dumbledore investigations sat down, stunned after being thrown out of the pensieve. Looking between themselves, Amelia felt grateful to whomever sent the letter to Minerva just before they entered the room.
birthday to a student two years older than her who wants nothing to do with either her or the child.”
“I think we need to have a chat, youngster,” Godric said with a serious look on his face. “We need to know everything that you know. You have our permission to claim these rooms as your own. Now, why don’t you pull up a seat and tell us everything from the beginning? Your friends can listen in if you wish.”
“Tobias is asleep,” he stated as he moved aside. “Ensure he wakes an hour before supper so we can pack everything up.”
Quietly The Pack split into smaller groups before pulling out the plans they had been working on in their leader’s absence and reviewing them before the meeting where they would be revealed. If anyone had cared to look into the common room at all that night, that was what they would have seen.
“If it’s all the same, Draco, I wish to keep my possessions the way they are,” Severus murmured as he offered Harry a glass of sparkling water with line, which the boy took, gratefully, as he sat.
He smirked when the other members appeared, only to be attacked by a hyperactive raven-haired teen with glowing green-silver eyes.
Draco and Tobias spun around fast enough to give themselves whiplash. Standing before them was a woman so pale she seemed to glow in the darkness and a male so dark he could have been mistaken for a shadow. A pair of luminescent blue eyes shone with humour from The Father’s face.
Hogwarts knew that the heir was close. She always knew, but until recently she had been forced to ignore his presence. This year she would not have to. He was close enough for her to be able to read his emotions. She chuckled to herself as his plans for the year were transferred to her. She had never liked that Dumbledore man, even when he was a child in her halls. She would do her part, as would the sorting hat. She liked this plan.
Draco growled deep in his throat after trying – and failing – to deepen the kiss his husband had started. After several more failed attempts, he took matters into his own hands and lay down slowly. Smirking to himself, he quickly flipped over, eliciting a whimper of delight from the delectable man that was now beneath him.
“I can discuss business with the twins, Hermione. I am the third owner of WWW, after all and I need to have an interest in what is happening in the shop. We need to discuss a lot of things for it – any new products, what is good for business, what is bad for business, what age group they are aiming for and what age group is actually buying the stuff, if we want to sell shares, if so how many. You know, all the statistics, facts and figures that go with running a business.”
Lucius sighed as he stood to get his next victe … erm … student. He had been, thankfully, lucky so far with those he had been assigned to sort out. As he had been the only person who had no fifth years to see, he had been the one to get the Patil twins. He was very thankful that their father had been present to glare them into submission – well, one of them at any rate. He entered the room with the second last student and closed his eyes, hoping he was seeing things. Opening them, he turned around and walked out of the tent and yelled out his frustrations. Something out there hated him; he was sure of it. He had been landed with the red-headed twat.
“Of course I love the two of you. You’re my family,” he said calmly. “I was just wondering what I did wrong to have the both of you hyperactive at the same time.”
Harry had glared at him, saying, “I don’t need to prove myself to you, Draco Malfoy, and as it is not your things that will explode if I drink, the choice is not yours to make.  If Professor Snape and Remus want to use me as a guinea pig, they can – even though I don’t like it.”
She looked up, teary eyed. “You said you weren’t sure about the red-haired one, but I’d have a friend for life in Harry.”
Draco’s mouth was held open by a steel ring wrapped in silk that was large enough for Harry’s dick to fit snuggly into. Instead of the expected hole, Harry discovered a clear crystal phallus-shaped dildo entertaining his Pet’s tongue. Two leather straps firmly tied behind his head kept both the ring and dildo in his mouth.
Minerva frowned thoughtfully. She knew that something had occurred over the summer to drive a wedge between her three favourite students, but she didn’t know what. Hoping to get more of an idea of what happened, she sat across from the girl. “Tell me about the argument and I’ll see if I can recommend some texts to you.”
“May we adjourn to another room to discuss this?” Tobias asked, once again going into diplomat mode.
Amelia couldn’t help the soft chuckle that escaped her control at just how disgusted the young man sounded at the mere thought of being marked in such a way. “Two more things than you may go, I promise. The first is your lack of a Dark Mark, even though I know that you had one a few years ago.”
She paused to smile at the young man as she prepared to give him the same advice she had given to his mother so many years ago.
Hermione nodded. “I’ve been here since the Library opened this morning, and I can’t find anything in any of the books I’ve looked in.”
Everyone turned as one being to look at the intruder, only to release at the amused face of Tindershank – the goblin in charge of Hogwart’s rewarding and rebuilding units.
“I don’t want to spoil this, but I think we should talk about Sev and Remus’ punishment. Don’t you think three weeks is a bit long to keep them separated?”
‘How the Hell did you manage to keep your job?” Algernon asked. “I lost mine because some idiot in a high position refused to accept that magic can’t fix anything.” He turned in obvious dismissal of the fuming Healer in favour of addressing the twins. “If you will take a seat outside, Amelia and I will go over your lists and decide whether it will be me who goes into the mine field that is your mind or someone who is better suited for it.”
“Honest, Bi. Why would I lie to you? It goes back to the dark ages where if a witch was caught the men in the town or village she was found in were allowed to rape her before burning her at the stake. This became a magical law so ingrained that over the years the magic in us and our world made it so hard for a witch or wizard to be de-flowered that only another with magic could take their virginity, and only then with the said witch or wizard’s permission. If they didn’t have permission, the one who forced them got sick, was crippled or died. Where do you think the muggle superstition of sleeping with a virgin was bad and so had someone else do it for them came from?”
“Tell Potter I said I’d be glad to help him with Weasel and his mudblood.” He then stepped into the flame and disappeared.
The Pack organized themselves around their Alpha and Beta once again as the couple drifted off to sleep. Blaise smirked as his Grandmother moved from the room, shamefaced. It was evident that she had forgotten who her boss really was. He would bet a large amount of money that she was hoping this incident never got reported to The Lord – but it would, because his loyalty now lay with his Alpha and the rest of his pack – not with the humans beyond it.
Before he could react, Tobias was in the bathroom and in the shower. Chuckling, Draco followed him into the shower and revealed to him the pleasures of having someone scrub your back.
“Really?” Draco drawled, glaring heatedly at the man. “Then explain to me why MY husband clings to me when he sees me and sobs when I leave. Tell me why he calls your office a cage. Tell me HY HE IS BEING PUT INTO ISOLATION FROM EVERYONE!” he roared angrily, stalking towards the completely pale man. “And while you’re at it, tell me why it is Bi who is being punished for that bastard’s actions. He might have lost house points and got a detention, but he is still allowed to see other human beings every day and to sit out in the sun and fresh air if he so wishes.”
Laugher rippled through the group. “What else does he know – or heard – about this mystery man?” Neville asked, draped in one of the leather armchairs as if he belonged there.
“But if you can silently guess, well done!” Fred beamed as he clasped his hands together. “It isn’t like we keep it a secret.”
“Those fifth years that have not yet been seen, please stay in your seats,” she called out. “We know who you are and punishments will be given if you do not stay. Sixth years also please remain seated. Everyone else my leave.”
“Good,” Tobias snapped, still glaring at the men around Severus. “Then maybe what happened to me at the hands of the Ministry at the beginning of last year won’t happen to someone else.”
“And lastly, do you, Hermione Granger, promise to stand by any and all punishment – no matter what it is – by the hand of the one who was Harry James Potter?”
Tom and Lucius stared at Severus in shock. It was obvious to all of them that this was news to them.
“Good Lord man!” Amelia exclaimed as she flicked through the results. “Just how many times have you been hit with the cruciatus curse?”
“So in other words, I’ll be a sex-crazed cock hound with no inhibitions and a fetish list that never stops growing,” Tobias summed up, removing his face from Draco’s shirt and snuggling into him, eyes drooping slightly.
Tobias whined softly when he felt the soft pressure at his entrance. The whine turned to a pleading whimper as the slick muscle gently probed into him. As Draco’s tongue wriggled its way into him, it took all of Tobias’ mental strength to not start begging. It wasn’t long before the soft whimpers became desperate pleading as Draco speared him with his tongue over and over.
Narcissa squealed, causing her husband to wince. “My little Dragon is being courted properly by his betrothed! Did he say what the first gift was? When did he get it? Who was there? Where were they? How did …”
Everyone in the room watched in fascination as the liquid disappeared down the boy’s throat. Laughter followed when Remus tried to remove the goblet from his hand before it had been licked clean. When he managed to remove it, he spoke.
“Tobias made an oath to destroy everyone involved in his treatment. This oath will force each person to feel everything each of their victims had to feel due to their part of the plan. Your magic made a deal with someone else’s to protect you from the worst of it. Think of that before fighting even more against it. Also be thankful that all your Master wants you to do is report on the Headmaster – they could just as easily turn you into the school tramp and no one could do anything about it.”
“Pateras? May I keep him? I need a new toy since Bella broke and you won’t give me Peter Peter.” Lucius and Narcissa chuckled softly when their Lord nodded, a large malicious grin on his face. Tobias grinned widely and waved his wand, causing all the bones in his new toy’s body snapped at the same time. Gesturing to the screaming man, The Pack moved in order of lowest rank to highest to collect their knives. Once they had all been collected, Remus stepped forward, bowed, picked up the spy and disappeared. Tobias flashed himself back into his seat.
Draco and Tobias smiled at each other as they sipped the wine and nibbled on fruit, goat’s cheese and biscuits in a garden full of night blooming flowers. The sweet smelling air made both young men slightly giddy while the waning moon hovered above them.
Smirking to himself, he listened to the request before denying her request. After all, soldiers don’t need to think for themselves.
Draco rose from the bed and pushed them out of the room with his magic. “We will see you as soon as we get dressed.”
Severus chuckled softly as he looked up from where he was writing out a parchment full of potions-related activities on it and glanced over at the  transfigured bed where Tobias and Luna could be found. After eating, the rest of The Pack had guided Luna to Severus’ office and the blonde had sleepily climbed into the bed with her Alpha, mumbling a soft ‘thankyou Papa’ before falling into a deep healing sleep only moments after Tobias.
Tobias smirked. “You’ve never really gone through the library have you? If you had, you would have realised that amongst all the muggle books were some absolute gems.” Humming slightly, Tobias arranged five thin books on his father’s desk. Seeing Tom’s questioning look he grinned.
“Granger, Weasley, the twins, Ginny, Dumbledore and my O.W.Ls,” Harry answered Severus’ raised eyebrow. “Ginny and the twins are checking to see if the muggles are treating me all right and to complain about Percy, Molly, Arthur, Ron and Hermione. They’re also saying that if I need a place to get away, I can stay with the twins in Diagon Alley. The old goat is reminding me that I cannot leave the muggle’s house due to the protection of my mother’s blood,” Harry snorted.
“Nothing important,” Draco said from his position in the corner. “We only need to give you your registration number.” He turned with a sadistic grin that would have looked more at home on Luna’s face and made the breath catch in the throats of those who saw it. In each hand he held a rubber handled metal pole that was topped with a white hot number. Before anyone could react, he pushed the heated metal onto Deloris’ flank.
Now, all she had to do was discover what Ronald Weasley and Gregory Goyle had to do with tonight’s injuries and hand them to a professor. She smirked. It had been a long time since she had seen Severus torture – I mean interrogate – students. Maybe it was time to pay him a social call.
Minerva froze and glared at the man before her. “Firstly, that boy is not a slut. He never has been and he never will be, and I am disgusted that you could ever call a student by that derogatory term. Secondly, he is not a weapon and you will come to regret turning him into one. Thirdly, I cannot believe that you could even think of selling any child into what amounts as a life-long sex slave, and lastly the child growing inside Tobias is not a bastard. Tobias and Draco are legally married and the child conceived on the night after their wedding. I know this because I was the one who presided over their wedding. Now, IF you don’t mind, I would also like to have something to eat.”
Silently Tobias held out one of his hands. Visibly shaking, Draco placed his hand into his husbands and allowed him to place it on his bulge. After a few moments a radiant smile burst across the Malfoy heir’s face and he sank to his knees, whispering to his hidden child.
“I never have, and never will need Occulmancy training, nonos. I have a natural shield around my mind. It took three years of mind manipulation potions hidden in his gods-forsaken lemon drops, tea and in every liquid I drank, including the healing potions, for him to be able to put a crack into my shield. Then he got the idea for someone I trusted to do it for him.” He looked pointedly at Remus, whose face was full of shock and anger. He looked back at Severus.
“The two of you are being punished together. I know that it was nonos who is responsible – so he will be getting a much harsher punishment.” Closing his eyes, Tobias scratched a design into his forearm then touched his wand to it. Severus tensed as the design was slowly and painfully cut into his flesh. Tobias opened his eyes.
Tobias smiled softly at him and cuddled into him once more. “I promise, Drakontas.” Looking at him he asked quietly, “would you like to join me in my morning ritual?”
Tobias continued writing, a small smile appearing on his face as he reached for a small stack of parchment at the top of the desk. “I like to think that is more me becoming more attuned to being a house-wife, if you will. I’m going to be staying home with the children and I will teach them all they need to know. As such I will need something to do as work. I have already agreed to sort out Anadochos’ library at the Manor as I have offered to do his and Pateras’ paperwork – as long as they set it aside in a room for me to do one day a week. They can obviously either do the things that need immediate attention themselves or send it to me via Thanis. I will also be discussing the school curriculum with the founders, sorting out the rooms of the castle and their contents and starting on plans for a sister-school to Hogwarts that will be home to first years as they learn the basics. I may even open it as a part-time school or camp for muggle-born and half-blood students so they can lean to traditions of the wizarding world without having the pure-bloods always over them making them feel worst then they already do ...”
“I’m going to kill Ron!” Harry hissed. “He almost broke your arm in three places. He DID break your wrist and three fingers! Pomphrey didn’t do her job well enough! I understand about leaving us to heal naturally, but she damn well should have scanned us for serious injuries! If your fingers and wrist had set like this you wouldn’t have been able to use your wand properly every again! This is really going to hurt, Draco. I’m really sorry. Ready? One … Two …”
“Neogennito!” a sharp, dark voice called, snapping the beast’s attention from the boy beneath him. “Release him!”
“As of now, she is happily sleeping with your husband until she needs her next dose of blood,” Xeno said with a small smile. “It’s good to see that she has people she can count on that aren’t me.”
“But don’t worry,” Luna continued, pulling a lollypop out of her mouth, “once you tell him what is happening, he will find security.”
“What happened?” he yawned, his voice husky from his time with Luna and Ron in the Room of Requirement. Thankfully for him Seamus thought it was because he’d just woken up.
“That is a sight for sore eyes,” Tobias said with a gentle smile. “It’s wonderful to see a family that is as close as ours.”
“Madam Bones,” Narcissa responded before her eyes returned to the out-spoken man. “That … poor excuse of a wizard managed to get on my son-in-law’s bad side rather quickly.”
Tobias nodded just as a house-elf appeared with a roast meat sandwich. Taking a bite of it, Tobias moaned in appreciation as the sweet, yet rich, taste of venison touched his tongue. His eyes closed in bliss, he didn’t see Remus walk into the room – but he did smell the blood-rich nutrient potion the werewolf carried. He growled deeply in his throat in anticipation. As soon as it was set down beside him, he grabbed the goblet and downed it, forgetting his partially consumed sandwich. Remus laughed as Tobias growled at the house-elf’s attempt to remove the goblet from his grasp.
They watched as Tobias polished off a large bowl of pasta full of salmon, tomatoes, spinach, basil and red peppers, a glass of caffeine-free chai made with soy milk and a thick slice of banana, walnut and date loaf. They exchanged looks and shrugged. At least he had a decent appetite when he wasn’t throwing up.
“Myrtle, they are with me. Now kindly go back to your u-bend and shut up before I decide to solidify your ectoplasm and turn you into potion’s ingredients. I have a new potion I am dying to try out and that is the only ingredient I don’t have. I’m sure I could get it done without anyone knowing … or caring.”
Tobias bowed his head as tears flooded from his eyes. Severus tightened his arms around him. “I miss him so much, Nonos. I feel incomplete without him.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “He keeps the nightmares away. As soon as my eyes close, they start. Always the same, always different.” He shuddered. “They keep me awake at night, and I can’t speak to Drakontas to make sure he’s alright and so I panic.”
Tom was half way through a report when a flash of flame and a harsh trill appeared in his office. Intending to snap at the intruder, he stopped as image assaulted his mind. When the images stopped, Tom stood and ran from the room.
Ron curled up slightly, feeling rather sleepy. Once again, he brushed away the frass that was tickling him.
Cornelius sighed in frustration as the noise level rose. “Why did we arrive so early again?” he asked rhetorically, making the two people on either side of him chuckle.
“You bet your arse we will be there,” Tobias stated, glaring at the men who still hadn’t removed the cuffs from his Godfather. “I’m one of his witnesses.” The men on either side of Severus shifted nervously “I know I can’t take the truth serum, but nothing is stopping me from having a truth spell put on me – as long as someone COMPETENT does it – so either Lucius, Father or Remus. And I expect all other witnesses and both defendant and accuser to be provided with Veritaserum as they – unlike myself – have not reason to deny its usage.”
“I agree to that,” Cornelius blustered. “We don’t want another Black episode – what with him being in Azkaban for over a decade while he was actually innocent.” He was obviously remembering the events of the summer when he’d had to tell the wizarding world that an innocent victim had been in the feared wizarding prison. “We will have the hearing tomorrow morning. He will need to spend today and tonight in the cells, but he will be treated correctly. Will you be there?”
“We know we don’t have to,” Pansy replied, “but it is our job to ensure that you are safe, so we will take it in turns to watch you. We agreed to it before we started and nothing you say will change our minds.”
“I see,” the man murmured, hope alighting itself in his chest. “What occurred in your first lesson with the accused?”
As soon as Severus laid their Alpha on the large bed, The Pack converged on him as one. As quietly and as delicately as they could, they arranged themselves around their Alpha pair. It was no surprise to anyone when Luna cuddled into Tobias’ side with Ginny at her back. She was the only one present who currently needed their Alpha’s presence, after all, and none of them, not even Draco, had it in their hearts to forbid her that small comfort. Her last conscious thought before sleep took her was, “I love my Pack.’
Tobias quickly pulled the now shaking man’s head around and forced his eyes to meet his own. “Calm down. Breathe deeply and calmly. That’s it. This is what I was talking about before. You are hyping yourself up. Open the letter and read the content, then freak out about what it says, not what it might say.”
The first thing Severus heard after stepping out of the flame was yelling.  Fearing that the recipient of the anger was his godson, Severus hurried to the room Harry was in, only to find a white-faced, wide-eyed Draco waiting in front of the closed door.  Sighing internally in relief, he opened the door – only to stop in the doorway.
Severus and Lucius followed Tom to the library, tears streaming down their cheeks at Tom’s shrill scream of “MY BOOKS!”
To the surprise of everyone in hearing range, Severus started to sob softly as he clung to the young man in his lap. “I’m sorry, Please don’t ignore me again.”
Theodore stepped forward and gently took the scroll in his hands, unravelling it before he nodded, closed it and returned to his original position.
Tom raised an eyebrow at the cat animagus, ignoring what was going on behind him. “Would I have sent you that letter if I were hiding him?”
Draco nodded slowly. “I am exceedingly nervous, but also excited. I haven’t seen Bi for fourteen days, and I want him back where he belongs.”
Albus Dumbledore glared at the dark-haired boy who was responsible for all his problems as the group of Slytherins handed over multiple scrolls of paper to him. He didn’t worry about what was on the scrolls as he had been told by Severus that the lad read over all of their Defence work and he had seen and heard the evidence with his own eyes and ears. Oh if only something he planned would work!
“I’m afraid I can’t. I am a general Healer. I am the person to come to for vanished bones, broken bones, burns and mild spell damage. I can run a test on him, but I would not be able to understand it like his personal physician would. I’m still in the process of becoming a specialist and I could do more damage if I tried healing him.”
“Didn’t you feel the magic that was attacking our wards, Draco?” Lucius asked, shakily. The two boys looked at each other, blushing slightly. Remus started to sniff the air around them, before growling.
“Been mine since firs’ year,” Tobias mumbled. “Ev’r sin’ I congratulated them in’viduly for a prank and got their names to the righ’ face wivout a hint from them.” He yawned and seemed to collapse down further into the chair he was seated on. “Agreed to be mine ‘cause I protec’ them and they ‘tect me. I give freedommmmmm.”
Neville frowned thoughtfully. “I think I will watch. Nothing you do will make me look at you differently. We are all members of the same Pack and your talent makes no difference to that.” He placed a hand on her shoulder. “We all are loyal to our Alpha – even if we show it in different ways.”
“Severus Snape! What in the blazes is going on here? And why is my foster godson laying on a bed in my clothes!” a normally soft-spoken voice yelled from behind Draco, who jumped.  Unfortunately for the men beside the bed, so did Harry, who had just started to drink his next potion.
Lucius was just settling down for tea when two owls landed on the table beside him. One of them he recognised as his son’s Eagle owl, Lucien. The other was a stranger. Shrugging, he reached for the strange owl first – Business before pleasure after all.
Remus folded his arms, laughter dancing in his eyes. “I mean it, Neogennito. You are to go and eat under your Fathers’ watchful eye, then you will sleep THEN you will aid Miss Lovegood and deal with business. If you don’t, then I will make sure that as soon as you leave here, you will not be allowed to leave the bed you are in.”
Lucius glared the annoyance down. “It didn’t occur at the school – It occurred the night after their bonding. I should know ... the aftershocks of their magic combining blew apart my wards.”
Tobias half-smiled and he changed into his wolf. Sev Smirked. “Do you think you will be able to keep the wolf as your guardian until your bonding day?”
“You’re eyes are dull, your skin is slack and slightly yellow. You have the look of someone who is addicted to Dreamless Sleep – and I know that you are, hence the fact that I am not giving any to you. Everyone in your pack is here for you, Bi. Just like we are. We are your family. We want to take care of you – Please let us. Tell me why you are having trouble sleeping so I can help.”
“Rule one. Only we five are to know what you are doing until I decide to tell everyone else. Rule two. You are to work together at all times. If the best way of doing something is with only one of you, I expect you to tell the other before it occurs. Rule three. You are to write an individual report each at the end of every week and a combined report at the end of each thing you complete. Do you accept?”
“Sorry about that,” he said, grinning as the spells on the room changed his voice to be slighter higher pitched than normal. “I forgot that you were tied up at this point in time.”
The only splash of colour in the bathroom came from the burgundy strips on the large bath sheets and the large vase of red carnations situated on the vanity.
“As for why we were contacted to deal with this,” Fred said with an evil grin on his lips that had many people in the Hall swear they could see the devil horns growing from within his hair, ‘Who better to send? And the reason for this?” He spun around to face the Dias, face completely serious in an instant.
“It is a powdered bacterium that I sprinkle onto my gardens at Longbottom Manor,” Neville explained patting the package he had returned to his pocket. “It is harmless until magic is added to it. Once magic has been added, then the only person who is safe from it is the one who’s magic woke it.”
These buns are safe for you to eat. They have been made with sheep’s milk and applesauce instead of egg. They are also made fresh today. The house-elf who gave them to us said they were named “Cinnamon and Pecan butterscotch buns’ and were a treat for the two of you since you didn’t eat dessert last night. The pitcher holds the herbed water we Centaurs drink on a morning. If you wish it we will allow you to have access to it in the castle, as long as it is only the two of you who drink it. Remember to drink your potion as well. I will not be responsible if you Godfather were to find out.
Tobias woke to a small body crawling into his bed with him. He sleepily opened one eye and took note of the long blonde hair and slightly protruding eyes in a paler than normal face and moved around so he was spoon in the younger female who had protected him, his mate and their unborn cub with her own body. With a sigh of happiness he fell back into a deep sleep with his new cuddle-toy not too far behind.
Tom gave a grateful sigh when someone knocked at the doorway to his study. He was starting to think about pulling his son from Hogwarts just so he could hand all of the paperwork to him. He hadn’t given into the desire – but it was a close thing.
“As Patriarch of the British branch of the Patil line, I accept the transfer on behalf of my youngest daughter and give my blessing to this union.”
He took a mouthful of the sparkling water and lime – his now favourite evening drink – that Severus handed to him and ignored the looks on everyone’s face. “This time, I was wearing those damned bands and Mr Albus Fuck-em-all arrived and told them that they were to punish me in whatever way they saw fit and that the bands would prevent my magic from escaping. He … He said.” Tobias stopped talking, finding it hard to breathe due to his chest constricting. Severus stood behind him, grounding his emotions by placing his hands on his shoulders. Tobias nodded his thanks and rested his head back, preventing the tears in his eyes from falling.
Severus smirked. “Yes Lucius. He always awakens before dawn. How is the question, but he always does without fail – unless he is in the hospital wing, that is. Even with a double dose of dreamless sleep he wakes up. It is irritating to say the least.”
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it? It was buried under a few thousand years’ worth of bone dust, rock and dirt. It took me four days to clean the floor enough for it to come out. Well, let’s go do this.” Tobias strode down towards the Chamber, followed closely by his pack.
Luna gave a slowly spreading smile. “I wouldn’t mind a spare pair of hands,” she suggested. “You up for it Skoteinos?”
“I was driven to join the Dark Lord a few months after my sixteenth birthday by three seventh years who eventually became Head Auror, one of the highest non-Political Ministry workers and a Healer specialising in pregnancy care. It didn’t matter that they had almost killed the youngest daughter of an old pure-blood family or that they did kill the unborn heiress of another. Not one of the members of the Dark Army joined for the Hell of it. Not even the Dark Lord himself has no reason for what he became.”
“You are most welcome, Severus Snape,” she muttered before preparing for the next staff member to enter her little make-shift clinic.
“Just us,” Tobias yawned, leaning on the older man. “You can get The Pack ready Drakontas. I’m going back to sleep.”
“I was dismissed because I allowed a patient to die. She’d had a difficult birth and by the time the young one had been born she had lost too much blood. It was either save the babe or lose both of them. There was nothing I could do for the mother, even if I had tried. My supervisor didn’t see it that way. It was his niece and whilst her husband and parents forgave me saying that it wasn’t my fault as even her original doctor had said that should she get with child she had a large chance of not surviving.” He shrugged. “I ended up losing my job due to him forcing it to go through court.”
Draco grinned. “The whole School was speechless! It was so funny, Bi. I thought the Gryffindors would die of a heart attack, they went that red!”
The pole had been thickened so he would need both of his hands to encircle it and the centre had been replaced with a clear material with a ridge only just deep enough to comfortably cradle the mushroomed head of an engorged penis. He felt his mouth water at the thought of watching his gorgeous pet grinding himself along the pole while putting on a show for his Master’s enjoyment.
“Harry! It’s come through! Come, come, come, come, come!” Harry had started to rise when Hermione snapped out of her silence.
Narcissa looked into the fire before her. She was happy for her son, but rather sad as well. Her baby boy was no longer her baby. He was now married and getting prepared for life as a fully qualified wizard. It pained her that there were no more children around the Manor. She and Lucius had been lucky to have Draco. Every other time they had tried, she had lost the child. She sighed softly. It would be better for her if she stopped think of it as it had always made her depressed.
Before he fell back into sleep, Tobias looked over at the still form of his former friend and grinned. Life was GOOD!
“Forgive me Madam, I am Tobias’ personal healer. He mentioned that he requested my presence for the medical examinations of himself and his family, did he not?”
So here he was, stuck to a seat in Severus’ Office with sixteen unopened boxes surrounding him and the contents of the only opened one scattered over Severus’ desk.
Ron was ashamed to admit that he was screaming like a baby. Not only did he have spiders all over him, but he was bruised and battered and absolutely terrified. He was convinced that the voices were out to kill him. “Stop!” he wept. “Please stop, I can’t take much more.”
Ginny whistled. “That’s a lot of detail you want, Alpha. Are we going to get an explanation to why we are doing this?”
Tobias stretched; smiling at the slight twinge of muscles that hadn’t been used in a while gave after being put through a thorough and intense work out. ‘And what a workout it was,’ he thought with a grin, remembering his and Draco’s activities from the previous night.
Breakfast in the Great Hall was underway when the seven officials walked into the room, bringing instant silence with them. Every eye in the room watched them as they made their way to the teacher’s Dias and turned. The lady in the centre moved forward a step and addressed the student body, making sure to remember to look at all four tables at various times while talking.
The room was silent at this. Fred continued. “Bill and Charlie are going to be there, but not in the house. Ginny said she’ll help with the store and so she’ll be staying with Bill and Charlie at The Burrow, so they can bring her, so we need someone to watch the house and the shop – particularly at night.”
“A lot, Tobias,” Severus answered. “More than anyone can tell you. Those files are only for those that are concerning Filch. Each of us Professors have our own files and folders. Some are more numerous than Filch’s.”
Draco smiled internally as he watched Tobias eat. Now that he’d taken the potion he was eating properly – He was still sticking to the list of foods Madam Pomfrey and Severus organised for him, but he was eating happily and more than a mouthful. Severus was also watching him and nodded in satisfaction at how the boy was going. He’d have to remember to order the house-elves to undercook his charge’s red meat.
“As soon as we get him upstairs, we will write to Draco telling him not to worry,” the teen holding Tobias stated in amusement.
“How pathetic,” Tom sneered. “This is why the United Kingdom’s magic community needs to go through a cleansing.” He shook his head in agitation. “Anyway … why are you here?”
Tobias stretched. “I have divination, Astronomy and Transfiguration to complete. I half did them this morning before talking to Nonos. I say we have a break now and for about half an hour after the trolley leaves for us to eat. That way we have roughly four hours before we have to pack up.”
Tobias and Draco talked throughout their meal, neither one mentioned the information The Mother had given them. Instead, they spoke about what they wanted in their relationship. Both were pleasantly surprised when it turned out that they wanted roughly the same things. The only disagreement they had worth mentioning was the number of children they wanted. Draco wanted two, while Tobias wanted three or four – if not more.
Tobias’ face was alight with malicious glee as he used the threat he had devised for Severus on his fair weather friend. As everyone watched in morbid fascination, Tobias turned his eyes onto those surrounding him.
“I didn’t think it was possible for that to occur, gios. I also severely doubt that the Weasleys got their red hair by having a fire demon do that to them. I think being married to Draco has made your mind visit the gutter.”
“You called for Dobby?” the elf asked, appearing in what seemed to be a white muggle chef’s hat, canary yellow shirt, dark grey shorts, a purple and tan stripped apron and holding a whisk covered in a creamy pale brown substance.
Draco smirked as he noticed his husband’s eyes glaze over in thought. He knew that if he wanted to get him, he needed to act now. Without thinking, he grabbed Tobias, yanked him around and pushed him up against the trunk of the Willow tree. He pinned him there with his body and raised his husband’s hands above his head and held them there with his own. He pushed his groin into the one before his, causing Tobias to moan out loud and push back, tilting his head back until it was resting on the tree behind him.
“Draco?” The whisper caught his attention and he looked at his father and laughed at the look of awe on his face. “What the hell did you promise him?”
Severus gave a tired grin. “I lost count after the three hundred and ninety-fifth time and I’m not entirely sure that number was entirely correct to begin with. It is surprisingly difficult to keep track of numbers while in pain.”
As he talked, his eyes glowed a deep AK green, scaring all in the room. He turned his gaze on Voldemort.
Draco looked around the room in satisfaction. Severus looked well and was seated on a large stone throne set in the centre of the room. There was no sign of any of the chains on the chair which almost made him smirk. It was so good to have the Minister of Magic terrified about what you could do to him. It also helped that the Minister would also do anything to make up for his mistakes concerning his husband.
“Yes girl, Master,” Minerva snapped. “The ownership brand is just that – a mark of possession. In layman’s terms, it means you are less than a slave to the person whose magic is in that mark. You are a possession, nothing more. You are fighting against your Master’s orders, so he – or she – is punishing you by allowing you to see written words but removing your knowledge of them when you wish to read them. You will find that you will be able to read again when you have done what they wish.”
“I think, Neogennito that the amount of hatred and magic you placed into that vow you made your father is what is making you react like this. At least until you start to act upon it. Do you know how you are going to destroy them yet?”
Sally-Ann breathed out a sigh of relief and smiled. “I’m glad to hear that they are all right. I was worried when I didn’t see Tobias this morning.”
“I am telling everyone in this room right this second that I am no longer going to be a puppet. I am not going to join the Order – I have joined another. One that actually gives me information on what I need to know. They are just as eager to rid this world of Voldemort as I am. I am also very happy to announce that Severus and Remus are now members of this new order as well, and are therefore no longer in attendance here. I am NOT spending my time here. I have had several offers in my choice of accommodation and if the one offer I got over the summer still stands, then I will accept.”
Tom sighed. “Lupin. I do not know if they are alright or not, but I do know that they will come to no lasting harm where they are. No mortal knows what they will have to go through tonight, so we do not know whether it will hurt them or not. There is nothing we can do if they aren’t, so we have to put our faith in the boys.”
“Only what Gran’ther Sal, Gran’ther Ric, Gram’mere Helga and Gran’mere Ro have told us,” Tobias and Draco responded.
She then turned to her father, blind in her Temper tantrum. “And don’t get me started on you. You are about to sign one of your family members into slavery! Wait until I tell Mother what you are doi …”
Harry beamed, and then got a very Malfoy family smirk on his face. “I will go by Harry James Potter while with the Weaselbies, Pateras. I do not wish to, but I have the BEST idea of how to break the wondrous news. Do you mind if I go under the name ‘Black’ while at school?”
The second man exchanged devastated looks with the third recipient – who was also his wife - and opened his arms for her sobbing form. Internally, he was cursing himself to purgatory and back for his behaviour, after all, the day before it happened he was remarking on Draco’s luck for having a partner who didn’t throw things in a hormone-driven rage. Taking a deep breathe, he moved his wife away and dried her tears, murmuring in her ear and taking her hand, guided her into his study to compile a joint apologetic letter proper for the occasion.
Vincent and Luna had, in the end, given The Pack two cubs: a set of twins who had their mother’s mind, their father’s dependability and both of their loyalty.
Tom laughed. “He said that he bets the Weasley red hair is a unique shade of red because they were originally the bonded pets of Satan’s Fire Demons.”
Tobias moaned softly under the assault and sub-consciously wrapped his legs around his husband’s waist and pushed up, electing a moan from Draco. He did it again, only to have Draco push down and rub his groin on Tobias’ at the same time. Moaning with the pleasure caused between strong friction and smooth silk, neither of them lasted long. Draco collapsed to the side of Tobias, panting slightly and trying to adjust his now wet pants.
Seeing that Draco wasn’t going to listen to reason, Severus walked to the room with a huff, only to stop at the sound of desperate sobbing. Swallowing hard, he pushed open the door, entered and closed it behind him.
“Congratulations,” the man smiled. “You are one of our youngest graduates. You passed everything you sat. A copy of your results and your certificate will be posted to you.”
Severus shuddered slightly. He had no idea how his Lord, Mate or even Lucius and Narcissa would react to the news that Tobias might be a natural bearer and that if that was the case, he would be with child. It was something he didn’t want to think about – even thought it would mean The Pack would definitely be sitting their N.E.W.Ts early.
He stopped in mid-stride as he took in his friend of the last 20 odd years and the man before him.  He bowed stiffly and murmured, “My Lord,” before turning to Lucius.
“And what Tobias went through wasn’t?” Draco asked frostily. “I would think very carefully on what you say Granger. I was there when Sev burst into MY family home shouting for help. I was there when Sev, Remus, Father and Pa fought for Tobias’ life and I was there when Tobias was recovering from the mental wounds that were left over from what you, the Weasel,  the manipulative SOB that shouldn’t be anywhere near a school, let alone running it and our oh-so-caring school nurse did to him.”
Ron shuddered at the sight of another, unknown, mist hand and whimpered at the sound of the unknown voice, his mind running through all the horrible things this stranger could do to him.
“That’s what I was afraid of,” Bill sighed. He pulled his face from his hands and straightened in his seat. “What do I owe the pleasure of your visit to?”
“You tried killing my adopted father to steal his identity and you killed many innocent people while poisoning the minds of many more: All because of jealousy,” Tobias continued, spitting the last word making all who knew his history with muggle relatives flinch.
“Lady Longbottom.” Tobias called as Neville led his Grandmother away. When she turned, he smiled at her politely. “You may run into the Lestrange’s whilst you stay here. If they threaten you with anything, tell them you are under my protection. If they do anything without threatening you, call for Gios ek Skotadi and I will deal with them. I don’t think Bella dear will be any trouble though.” He bowed slightly and followed his father from the room.
“She will make a full recovery,” Vincent said with a smile. “I am going to wake her soon for her own noodles in broth. Would you mind us spending the night with you? I don’t trust the girls in her room and I doubt they would allow me to sleep in their common room with her.”
“He asked if when the bands are off, if he’ll be able to eat without throwing up.”  He looked at Lucius and noticed his paler than normal complexion. He nodded slowly.  “I believe he’s been hit with that curse.”
Tobias listened to the adults talk around him. Before they had entered the room, he had indicated to all the Weasleys and Draco that he wished to speak to them after this. They had all nodded their understanding and agreement.
“Don’t worry,” Draco grinned, making Deloris more scared than she was already, “we will aid you in fixing that.”
Ginny lowered her quill with a sigh of relief. As she massaged her hand to alleviate the cramp, she looked around. Because there were more people in one group, she had been moved into the Slytherin/Ravenclaw group – for which she was grateful. When her eyes focused on her pack-sister, she realised that she was copying her movements.
“How did you get in? Raithia is under orders to not let anyone unworthy through! I want answers and I want them now! I can’t believe that Raithia would allow an unworthy into our living quarters!”
“I wish to join your ranks, milord,” he stated. He glanced at Remus. “Remus too, wishes to join.”  He bowed deeply to the older man.  “We are yours to mark as you will.”
Harry glared at her before turning that same gaze on Dumbledore. “So much for the protection of the Order, Sir,” he drawled, sounding more like Draco than he had before. “Death Eaters attacked the Dursleys two weeks ago. I was rescued,” he spat the word as if it were poison, “by someone I didn’t like, nor trust. It took both him and Severus here to get me out without dying.” His eyes took on the look of hard emeralds as everyone voiced their accusations at Severus.
Both girls’ heads shot up and Draco quickly sent a few charms at Luna to remove the evidence of her tears.
Tobias stretched before freezing. The last thing he remembered was being in a bath with Draco. He was now lying in a bed … alone ….
Tom fidgeted under the blank stare of the younger male and cleared his throat. “To begin showing you how serious I am – I want to remove your Dark Mark.”
Ginny laughed and transfigured a sweets wrapper into a piece of parchment. She pulled a self-inking pen from behind Luna’s ear and wrote a short reply. “Give this to one of them, Lycia.” The owl bobbed her head several times and took off, leaving both girls to watch her vanish from sight.
“Combination short soup with venison, pork, prawn, mushroom and chocolate wantons and garlic, chilli and coriander juice.”
Everyone in the room exchanged confused looks until Neville entered the room with a blank-eyed Ron following him. Understanding formed in Tobias’ eyes when Neville ordered the shell to stop and it obeyed.
With one last shallow bow, Millicent calmly strode to the curt-mannered man on the other side of the hall.
Tobias frowned thoughtfully down at the papers before him. Since Draco had forbidden him from using magic for a few days to allow himself to recover from his forced transformation the day before, he had decided to take his paperwork with him to breakfast since he was to spend the day with Minerva since Severus was brewing several very delicate potions for the Healer who had replaced Madam Pomphrey. He jumped slightly when a hand was placed on his shoulder.
Luna just shrugged with everyone else as she wrote the last two words on her note to the twins before sealing and sending it.
Draco nodded and pat Tobias’ shoulder in understanding before he left. Tobias sighed and relaxed, letting the potion do its work before he left to return to his belongings.
Salazar nodded. “Yes, I believe it is, not could be. He is showing the same symptoms in the same time period as I did. There is only one way to be sure and that is to get a healer you trust to confirm it.”
“Something is going to happen today,” Tobias stated, relaxing into his husband’s embrace. I don’t know what and I don’t know when, but it will happen.”
“You are a disgrace to the race of wizards,” the woman said. “You blamed your own victim for the results of your actions and then proceeded to change a spell used in Healing in an attempt to further harm said victim. As punishment your soul will never be granted rest. It will wonder in limbo for all eternity. For your physical punishment, I hand you over to My Raven. I understand this is not the first time you have caused him harm.”
“Agreed,” everyone chorused, watching in silence as Blaise repeated the same process as Luna to obtain the two rolls of parchment.
Hermione sat on her bed with her arms wrapped around her knees. It had taken less than an hour for her parents to notice she wasn’t herself and she had found herself sitting across from them after their dinner the first night back with a cup of tea in her hands. By the time she was normally in bed, she had told her parents everything that had occurred the previous year, leaving nothing out. She would never forget her parent’s response.
Theo shuddered. Luna may be the best of them at torture, but Blaise was a very close second. If his victim had been anyone but Granger, Theo would have felt for them.
Booph and Zog tilted their head to one side at the same time. “They’re ready for you now. We leave in five minutes, so say your goodbyes.”
Ten minutes later, silence reigned as Tom walked into the garden with a silent green-eyed youth hiding behind him, eyes downcast. Tom turned and lifted his son’s face with a finger under his chin. Silently he placed a kiss to his son’s forehead. The congregation was so quiet you could hear the Manor’s Albino Peacocks in the far distance.
Hermione raised tear-heavy eyes to her Head of House. “I can’t read it, Professor,” she sobbed. “I can see the words on the page but when I touch the book, the writing vanishes.”
Pansy, to the surprise of many, found a lovely bonded in one Susan Bones. When asked about their relationship by someone outside The Pack and Amelia, it was Susan who tore into the nefarious gossip, verbally shredding the woman’s hide and reputation with such precision that Pansy, Luna and Narcissa took notes. Amelia, who had been spending her lunch break with the four of them, just smiled proudly at her niece. To the joy of both girls, they had welcomed two cubs of their own into The Pack and were responsible for the idea of The Pack taking in young victims of child abuse from muggle-born populations.
Severus nodded, eyes still on the pendant before he slipped it over his head, closing his eyes as the familiar and comforting magic washed over him.
“Please accept this gift and those that follow as a symbol of my growing affection both of and for you. If you accept this gift now that you have been told this, I will take it as a sign I have your permission to court you in this manner. If you do not accept this gift, then I will not bother you with anymore gifts until the day we fulfil the marriage contracts we both signed.”
Draco watched his bonded of the last three hundred and eighty five years lovingly as he trapped himself within his own thoughts. The two of them had the ups and downs that every couple in a relationship had, but they had always had each other’s back when it was important. He sighed and allowed himself to also go travelling down memory lane.
Tobias started to laugh. “Pateras, did you read the instructions on the potion before drinking it?” Voldemort shook his head, grinning like a loon. Tobias shook his head sadly. “This, my friends, is why it is important for all instructions to be read thoroughly before doing something. Pateras, please tell me how you feel.”
“I have also spoken to the Founders about the wards they had on the school and grounds and what they have told me has me worried when I compare my years in Hogwarts’ halls against what the wards should do. This is the main – but not only – reason I asked to talk to you today. I would like to hire a team of Gringotts ward-masters to come to the school and inspect the wards. They will be given access to my private rooms, where they will be able to consult the Founder’s Portraits about how they should look compared to how they do look. If need be, they will remove all wards and replace them so they are just as good as they were originally, if not better or they will strengthen the wards if that is all they require.”
“Lucius please, at least for this,” the blonde man said with a sigh, “I’ve come as Lucius-the-Father rather than Lucius-the-Malfoy-Lord.”
Dinner that night was an ordeal for the seven officials. In one day, they had managed to get through all the teachers – of which three had obliviates that couldn’t be broken without damaging their minds – and the entire first, second and third year populations. Thankfully none of the students had any mind or magic blocks and no injuries that were uncommon for their age. Still, it had been a long day for them – and the following day was set to be even longer.
Draco pulled Tobias closer. “I forgive you, ‘Bi. I know that it was the hormone acting up, but some of what The Pack and I do in retaliation is because of our need to protect you and the little one. It’s worse when we don’t spend a lot of time with you since we get antsy.”
A malicious grin crossed his face. “I suggest using the curse we were discussing last night with the charm Flitwick taught us first this year.”
“Right,” Pansy inhaled. “Bouno, Skia and Dynamo. Your parchment has only one thing on it and it is vital it is done to perfection. Your parchment is dedicated to the protection of Alpha and Beta.”
Over this ensemble was a cloak like no other in the wizarding world. It consisted of a cowl that hid their faces better than any mask could and the cloak itself, which only covered their back and sides. It had one tiny silver clasp – designed for quick and easy release – hidden at the throat. This cloak was where the difference lay. Tobias and Draco’s cloaks were a deep mahogany edged with silver, gold, copper and bronze thread designed into small, but complicated, Celtic knots.
With no effort at all, he rose from his position and walked to the door. Before the door managed to close fully, he whipped out his wand and one word left his lips with no one but his victim witnessing his actions. “Imperio.”
“The stuff you are eating is muesli, yoghurt and a mix of mango, papaya and passionfruit. Draco said he will join you in the torture and killing of your two ex-sidekicks. The thought of Weasley in my class is very frightening indeed, as is the thought of a pregnant Miss Granger. Also, the Dark Lord wishes to see you after lunch today.”
“We haven’t finished here,” the Healer snapped once she had shaken off her shock. “The results were only for one of you.”
As this was happening, Severus and the unknown man had walked in to the room and up to the raised Dias – Severus stopping at the Slytherin Table to drop  Tobias off into his husband’s lap.
“Where the bloody fuck have you two been! Did you think about what this would do to us? Beds empty, No note! Do you have a death wish?”
Neville stretched in the hope of relaxing the muscles in his back. He, Pansy, Blaise and Theodore had been in the Longbottom Manor Library since an hour after the evening meal. It was now just after eleven. He swore softly under his breath at the ache that now started to pound. They had been working non-stop since just after 6:30. Hissing slightly in pain, he tried to stand and failed.
“Yes kitten, I do – just give me a minute, ok?” He stood. “I am having a meeting here in five minutes. First through forth years – I request that you retire to your rooms for the rest of the night. Fifth and seventh years I don’t care where you go, as long as the common room is empty until curfew. Kitten? Do you think you could deliver all Slytherins, and the members of my pack who don’t belong here to their beds at curfew?”
“I expect at least one and a half months per room. If it takes longer that is no problem, but I will be worried if it takes less time,” Harry turned thoughtful. “I hadn’t really thought of the hallways, but yes, I would like for you to do them as well, but maybe wait until all the rooms on that level have been done before doing the hallways. Kitten will be able to reveal any secret rooms or areas that need to be done, even though she may not be aware for much of it.”
“I got a note from the Unspeakables this morning,” one of Lucius’ associates stated. “It seems that a few of the students have been bound by something of a magical nature. The three I find troubling are two death oaths and one Master brand. There is an indication of why these have been placed, but they were accepted by magic and recorded so they must be honoured. If anything happens to either of them while we are there, we can do nothing.
He sighed again before laying down intent on going back to sleep when a soft tune caught his attention. He froze as the voice got closer and clear enough for him to recognise. “Not again,’ he silently begged, “No, no, no, no, no. Anyone but that voice!”
“That two,” Tobias shrugged, purring softly. “Now shoo, I’m sleepy.” Once again, he fell asleep with close to no warning.
“Yeah,” Millicent agreed, sliding in next to the feisty red-head. “If you pout any more, or any harder, then Beta here won’t have a choice but to attack your mouth with his own. He already looks to be fighting the urge to make you moan.”
Four hours after he left the school, Severus was leaving the Headmaster’s office after ‘reporting’ on the meeting. All he wanted to do was fall into his bed and sleep the week away, but he couldn’t. He needed to meet his Lord and his Lord’s healer in his rooms so he could take them to the young Lord.
Draco growled and hissed at the dark-skinned male, causing him to chuckle. “Alright, youngster. Let’s get you to your mate. He is waiting for you.”
When the class was working to his satisfaction, he started brewing himself. His attention was shifted to the class when he heard a slight whining. Looking up, he found Tobias’ longing eyes on the potion he was making. Sighing, Severus indicated for him to help him with the remaining steps. After the potion was complete, a steaming goblet of it was placed into Tobias’ hand.
“Don’t you dare take that tone of voice with us Harry!” For being the smartest witch in the year, Hermione didn’t notice the winces that appeared on Ginny, the twins and Bill’s faces, nor the look of pure contempt on Tobias’. “What could you possibly have to talk to Ginny, Fred, George, Charlie or Bill about? There is nothing you could want to talk about without us in here with you.”
“Why did it take so long for someone to tell us?” Pomona asked, horrified. “It is bad enough that children from differing houses snipe and snap at each other, but for students to gang up on one student from their own house is deplorable.”
Harry chuckled. “I understand. I have Ron as a friend, remember? I think he’s harder to teach than Goyle because he’s such a mule-headed idiot.”
After half an hour of nothing but this, Tobias’ arms snapped up and grabbed Draco, pulling him over the back of the chair and into his lap. Pansy and Millicent giggled as Tobias nuzzled into Draco’s hair, semi-purring. Draco rested his head on Tobias’ shoulder and smiled happily.
“Of course Beta,” the young man said with a nod, raising from his seat without finishing what was on his plate and moving with purpose towards his destination.
Remus nodded and sat in the chair across from Tom. “Sorry Tom. I’m just worried – what with Albus trying to get to Tobias and all. At least I can say that I‘m happy they are now in a place no one can get to, because they are out of Albus’ reach – at least they are for now.”
“Have you got the papers?” Draco asked as he retrieved the wooden peg he had thrown at the unconscious female.
Lucius was impressed when Draco calmly pulled on a pair of gloves and proceeded to take clippings of her coat, hair and tail while ignoring the vitriol that was now pouring from the woman-turned-creature’s lips. He quickly coughed to cover his laughter when Draco pushed a sharpened needle almost viciously into the bound mare’s flank when she bad-mouthed Tobias. The grin on his face assured Lucius that his son, much like him, thought that the resulting shriek was perfect.
George swallowed nervously before straightening his back and squaring his shoulders. He may not want to say this in the company he was currently in, but he would answer the question and face the consequences like a man.
Neville rested his hand on his Grandmother’s shoulders and looked at her with love and respect in his eyes. “I have been privileged to have had you to raise me. For that you have my thanks. I am proud and honoured to by your grandson. I may be the legacy of my Mother and Father, but you get all the credit for who I am today.”
Silence filled the room. Harry smirked in a very Malfoy-like fashion at the stunned people before him. Remus was the first to speak.
“At least he is better than the pathetic brown-nosing psychosomatic sycophantic parasites that are scampering around most wizarding homes – and don’t get me started on those that work for them! Dobby is a damned good and loyal worker who not only does everything he can for his present employer, but he also has an actual brain in his head instead of the myxomycete sludge that denotes other of his station.”
At the Slytherin table, a barrier of three empty seats had appeared around The Pack due to the angry growling that erupted from their chests. Tobias and Luna, who had fallen asleep with her head resting on Vince’s shoulder, frowned and fidgeted slightly which stopped everyone mid-growl.
There is a section in this chapter that I know will not happen in real life, but I put it in there due to several reasons. If you find what it is and have questions for why I put it in there, just ask and I'll answer it for you
“Yes. We require a large fruit salad. Make sure you get a good variety of fruit. Do NOT focus on apples, pears and oranges.”
When Achalendra and his daughters arrived at Gringotts early in the morning, only he was not surprised to see Tobias, Fred and George waiting for them. He was surprised when the youngest ale nodded in acknowledgment and turned into one of the closets tunnels with a barely noticeable nod to the goblin that was closest to them.
“These are Glow-worms. When eaten, they make the eater blush when a certain pre-set word is said. Each sweet has its own code word, and you don’t know what that word is until the word is said – but boy is it worth the wait!”
Albus sat in his chair, fingers steepled against his mouth. He’d give the boy one more chance. If this meeting didn’t work, then his plan to remove the annoying brat’s support base, starting with the Slytherin Head of House would begin.
I knew about that,” she barked before sighing in frustration. “I was in St Mungos for the entire summer. The newer blocks were added while I was there since my heart was giving out. I have started having the bonds on my magic removed slowly so my heart is strengthened slowly by my magic and a potion our resident Potion’s master makes for me.”
Luna hummed softly as she flittered from shadow to shadow on her way to the Ravenclaw dormitory. She still had no friends in Ravenclaw, but it didn’t bother her at all now. She had The Pack and that’s all that mattered. She had tonight all planned out. First, she would write a letter to her potential mate with a git of some importance to her – she had chosen one of the first things she had made as a young girl. They were cuff-links in the shape of the crescent moon with a tear angling precariously from the bottom point. Both tear and moon had a dull redness to them, giving them the look of being blood-stained.
“With so much magic, and released in the conditions both of you released yours in, the flowers reacted. For most people, the flowers would have changed either their colour, or their structure. Because the two of you decided to refrain from seeing the other for two weeks, the magic that bound you together was increased because you had proven that neither time nor distance could lessen the love that is between you.”
“IT’S ALL YOUR FALULT!” she screamed. “I apologised, so why didn’t you forgive me? You’ve turned my life into a mockery!”
Wordlessly Draco opened his arms and just like the night before, Tobias let Draco comfort him. The Pack, knowing how important this moment was, watched as their Alpha was comforted by his Beta.
Without changing his blank facial expression, Harry answered, “Two to three times a day, and every second day it wouldn’t be with his fingers.” Severus turned an alarming shade of green. No one else spoke, not even to answer the question Harry had asked.
The black-haired man jumped at the sound and hurried to his patient’s side. “How are you feeling today, Harry?”
Draco stood and walked towards the group around Severus, leaving Tobias wedged between Vincent and Gregory. “What is the meaning of this?” he asked, crossing his arms and raising an eyebrow.
“They will be perfect,” Draco said. “Ask them if they would like the job and bring them here if they agree to it.”
Padma giggled softly and placed her hand on George’s shoulder. It hadn’t taken the girl long to figure out that her fiancée and his family were on the darker side of neutral and if asked, she could respond truthfully when she said it didn’t bother her.
When Tobias and Draco walked into the room an aurora appeared above the white clad table with the words ‘Congratulations, Tobias and Draco’ easily readable.
“Hey! I may be a businessman and dangerous when my family is threatened, but my Son has a grandchild for me to spoil growing inside him. I have the right to act like a child on Christmas morning!”
Draco nodded. “Our magic makes it so. Many witches and the occasional wizard, was forced into sleeping with someone they didn’t wish to sleep with before they were married due to rape. After this, the victim could not face their intended and so they didn’t have a good marriage. In the end, magic kind of … evolved, I guess you could say, to remove the trauma but not the anger.”
With one last spoon of what Tobias believed he would forever call ‘glue’, he leaned into Draco’s side with a slightly tired exhale. He hummed happily when Draco absent-mindedly wrapped an arm around his shoulders and someone close by handed him a mug of some creamy spiced liquid that smelt and tasted familiar to him.
“I would prefer it if you were to start it after Dumbles is removed from the school, so that leaves you with a few months to prepare everything for it. You are going to need to get specialised gloves and clothes so that nothing will harm you. I suggest writing to Bill about it and then you are going to need to start listing everything you will need. When you have the lists ready, bring them to me and we will discuss everything you have and you are going to need to have good reasons to have everything you write on the list.”
Tobias nodded in agreement and before anyone could protest, he apparated them, their homework and weekend things into the entrance Hall of Malfoy Manor.
George snorted in amusement, “I’m sure that he will get to it by afternoon tomorrow. Draco’s forbidden him use of his magic remember. If anyone here is smart, they will suddenly discover a filing cabinet full of disordered paperwork for him to disappear in. The stuff he does on a day-to-day basis won’t keep him occupied for long.”
After he read it, Tobias yawned and rubbed his temples. “I knew that he had reported what had occurred between Madam Greengrass and myself and I also knew about his request to be bonded to The Pack should he be disowned, but I didn’t know about the section on Granger, Weasley or Bumblewhore,” he sighed and shook his head. “I’m too tired for this,” he murmured, rubbing at his eyes. “I’m going to need to talk to Ginny and Pansy then Blaise. I might do that while waiting for my fruit salad,” he pouted sleepily resulting in Tom chuckling softly.
“Okay people!” Tobias yelled after everyone had calmed down. “I have two boxes here. One has everyone’s name in it and the other has a selection of colours. I will pick a name from the first container. Whoever I call will come up and chose another name. That person will be your team mate. The second person called will chose a colour. That will be your team colour. Once everyone is teamed up you will have a moment to change your clothing to said colour or to transfigure something in said colour. Everyone understand?”
“You look a little tired yourself, Severus,” Pomona said, sitting in the seat usually reserved for Minerva. “Minerva is having a meal out tonight. She had a meeting at St Mungo’s. Something about an elderly gentleman using a complex transfiguration spell on his daughter-in-law and getting it wrong. Now the poor thing is stuck in a tri-way transfiguration of human head, snake body and ox legs, tail and horns.”
Despite his ever darkening thoughts, Harry smiled at them. “If you don’t mind, I will not be answering any questions until I get back from my holidays. My Deputy Minister, Ms Amelia Bones, will be answering any and all questions for a week from tomorrow. It has been a very long, stressful day and I would like to go home and start my leave by relaxing before the boredom kicks in.”
Tobias gently extracted himself from his father’s arms and picked up the books he’d dropped. Looking at them, the three men’s jaws dropped. All the books in his hands had one thing in common – They were written in parseltongue.
“The two of you were responsible for the letter Minerva received last night I assume,” a voice said from the darkened staffroom when the twins reached the doorway
The Pack watched horrified as one of their members gorged himself on the food before him with no regard for his usual eating manners.
Every jaw in the room, bar those of the two with their heads bowed, dropped. Standing before them was a large Earth Daemon. Looking at his claws, they noticed they were the exact replicas of the claws in the bond mark of the two boys.
Draco walked to his father, who spoke to him in a fast whisper. Everyone was shocked into silence when Draco jumped happily on the spot and took off running in the direction of the Gryffindor table.
In the silence that followed, Lucius stood and moved to his wife’s side. Looking at his Lord for permission, he pointed his wand at the boy and murmured something. The Weasleys gasped as Harry Potter disappeared to be replaced by someone else. They watched in shock as he threw himself into Lucius’ arms and hugged him tight.
“He can’t harm me physically or magically within Hogwarts walls – Kitten wouldn’t allow it.  So he is either planning on attacking while I’m not within the safety of the walls, or he plans on attacking Draco. He doesn’t know it, but Draco is safe magical wise in Kitten’s walls, but he can be harmed physically.” He trailed off, eyes glazed over as he focused on his thoughts. He looked at Remus.
“I hope that helped, young Amelia,” a masculine voice said softly in respect for the pain she had previously been in.
The people in the hall that knew the full story echoed the ending and watched as the body was fully consumed by magic. Once the flames vanished, Tobias’ knees slowly began to give out on him.
“Of course, Nonos. I’m sure I could also give a short demonstration of the workings of this pack. When this meeting is complete, please write a letter to Pateras suggesting it. Oh, and ask him if it can be done before a full meeting so everyone knows what they’re dealing with if they decide to try their games on them. I think even you will be surprised Nonos. Kitten? What are the Old Goat and the Over-cooked Chicken Club up to?”
Tobias thought for a bit. “Honestly Pateras, I have no preference. I enjoy being with males more, but I can function well enough for a female too, so I will stand by your decision. May I ask one thing to be non-negotiable?” Voldemort nodded, puzzled at what this requirement was. “Can it not be someone related to me by blood?”
Tobias and Draco exchanged smirks as Severus scowled at Ron, Hermione and Seamus. It was finally Friday and after this double lesson, Severus would be free to see Remus for the first time in a week, so he was a just a tad more impatient than he normally was – which meant that the lesson was just that much more enjoyable for the Slytherins.
Draco nodded and tried drowning the taste left in his mouth with spiced pumpkin juice. When he looked up, he noticed the incredulous looks he house-mates were giving him. “What?”
Tobias nodded his agreement and placed the folder he was going through neatly on his desk before rubbing his face tiredly. “I haven’t even finished the first folder of the first box yet,” he mumbled. “Just how much stuff has Dumbledore cancelled, forbidden or denied?”
Draco sighed. “You didn’t tell me what type of damage he did to you. And don’t lie either, because I will check for myself, Mister!”
“And that is something none of us want to see before breakfast thank you,” Ginny piped up with a playful glare.
Hogwarts herself laughed joyfully, startling the students once more. “Oh, come now, dear Hat. Is that any way to talk to the Heir?” She asked listening to the retorts the Hat was now aiming at the boy whose head he was on.
Severus stood in his corner and rolled his eyes. Every meeting was the same. Complaints about certain students falling on deaf ears, arguments over whether-or-not to allow newspapers on school grounds, and what Tobias was up to. All of the teachers frowned at this. Yes they were all on Tobias’s side in his fight against the Headmaster, if not the war – but even if they hadn’t have been, they knew that any teacher interfering with a student’s life was prohibited. Everyone was happy that he would soon be out of the school and, therefore, away from young impressionable minds.
“What you did wasn’t just a prank that went wrong, love. You admitted to us with your own mouth that all the spells you cast were the darkest spells you could get without being recognised as a full dark witch or wizard. The punishment for something less than what you’ve done here in our world would be tried and in prison with no hope of parole.”
The guards who were in the room smirked: Their kind knew the real dangerous sex. Males might fight for honour, frustration, and to gain glory, but it was the females who fought for their family. There was a reason why no creature dared to attack an area where young goblins were present when their female relatives were around.
“I know they are not here for this but Alpha and Beta share parchment. The most important thing they need to concentrate on is the health and well-being of themselves and their cub. Also on their parchment is Dumbledore, Weasley, Granger, Hogwarts, The Pack and everything else they have some say in. Now, Dumbledore’s parchment is going to be on the coffee table before the Founder’s portraits. Everyone is encouraged to add ideas, theories and research points to the parchment and the people – or person – who it coincides with will discuss it with Alpha or Beta, who will then advise us in what to do concerning it.”
Draco understood why this was so important to Tobias, so he didn’t complain when he disappeared at times – Not that he could complain. It was one of those days when Tobias disappeared early in the morning that Draco found himself thinking of his dark-haired fiancé with a small smile on his face. He still had the fond smile on his lips when a pair of arms wrapped around him and a chin rested on his shoulder.
“You said this is what happens most of the time. What happens in the dreams that this doesn’t occur in?”
Tobias blinked at his godfather in surprise. “Sev, neither Drakontas nor myself will die before The Mother and Father need us. Zog and Booph have at least another two or three hundred years before their time as guardian ends and ours begin. I need something to keep me occupied since Drakontas is going to be going into the same business as Lucius.”
“That sounds wonderful to be honest,” Millicent smiled. “It has been a while since we’ve had a Pack fun day.”
“That would be wonderful. Remember to dress in nice clothes.” Tobias’ voice was overpowered by the sound of the running shower. Draco shook his head and walked down to the kitchen to order a basket from the house-elves. On his way back upstairs with the requested basket, he knocked on his father’s study door.
Sal nodded. “He can take a normal pepper-up potion, but if he did inherit this from me, it will take longer for everything to balance out. It really is best to let him sleep and let him rest … No using magic either.”
Draco shook his head and signed for Vincent to come over, only to be interrupted by a soft growl and fading footsteps. “That man will be the death of himself,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. “Do us all a favour Lupin and pull your head out of your arse quickly or I’ll be the one going temperamental on you. I would like to have my husband for more than half an hour a day.”
Draco lit a fire in the corner and placed what looked to be two pokers into it. “You should have long enough to get the man who is dealing with her punishment here and talk to him about the terms. He can take her after the application.”
Lucius, Narcissa, Remus, Tom and Severus looked down to hide the evidence of their amusement as Draco stood behind Tobias and started to rub the muscles in his neck. A bowl appeared before Tobias with a small pop and before anyone could react, Tobias had attacked it, moaning in ecstasy at the sweet juice coating his tongue with every bite.
Tobias smiled and sipped it, humming in pleasure. “What subjects have you done?” he asked once more as he cut into a patty.
Draco smirked at the small moans and whimpers coming from Tobias as he plundered his very willing mouth. Slowly, he ran his hands down Tobias’ sides, seeking a way for his hands to enter the fabric. Breaking the kiss, he glared at the robes, causing Tobias to giggle slightly. Draco turned his glare to his husband, who sat up and kissed him softly.
Tobias flamed into the Snake Pit feeling really annoyed. He’d had plans with his fiancé, but the old goat had summoned him to his office and had kept him there for an hour, trying to get his father’s name from him. Storming over to Draco, he straddled his lap and pulled him into a gentle – but determined – kiss.
Zog grinned. “Just like you know not to stand on ceremony with us.” Everyone laughed as Tobias stuck his tongue out at the Earth Daemon.
“Merlin Draco,” Harry whispered his eyes wide as he took in the complete ensemble. Other than the stilettoes and fishnet stockings, Draco wore a traditional French maid’s outfit – frills and all. The skirt was short enough to not cover Draco’s bits and the blouse was cut low enough that his newly pierced nipples were revealed – evident by the thin chain that joined the nipples together and encircled the pole, restricting how far back Draco could lean back.
“Remus, I’m glad you’re here. Luc and I are going to need your help. Once we have the metal band off from around Harry’s throat, pour this potion into his mouth and make sure he swallows it. Then move out of the way. All right, on three. One. Two. Three!”
Lucius shocked her by chuckling – a rich, velvety sound that suited the man as though it had been made for him and him only. “Tobias is favoured by The Mother and Draco has avowed himself to The Father. Any mortal magic that is used for mind manipulation or control is null and void as soon as they touch skin or lips. Draco and Tobias are participating for legal reasons, not because there is a chance they are compromised by ill-meaning interfering warlocks.”
“I’m not going to hurt him, Dragon. Now behave.” Draco ducked his head in embarrassment as those around him chuckled. Once more Narcissa ran a finger over the design. “This is beautiful. Can you explain it for us?”
“I have a life Booph,” Tobias answered. “I’ve been put onto light duties for a while and so cannot do some of the things that I used to do.”
It was during the second day that an idea hit her. All day this idea plagued her until she stopped and thought about it. If it worked, then Tobias would be able to do more than watch Ron and Hermione slobber all over each other. If it didn’t, she would be in a world of trouble. Would she do it, or wouldn’t she? Her answer was given to her the next morning.
Tobias beamed and handed Draco his fork while he held onto his spoon. Everyone watched in horror as Draco chewed and swallowed the piece he had put in his mouth.
“I’m happy to hear that, Gentlemen. I, myself, am finished here. Let’s go get us settled. I have a letter to send and I want to talk to you about what is happening with the shop. It might be best if Bill, Charlie and Ginny join us, as I’m going to be working with them.”
His thoughts were disrupted when Draco sucked his earlobe into his mouth and bit it softly, showing his dominance over his husband. Tobias whimpered softly and lifted his chin, causing Draco’s eyes to flare in possession. When he felt Draco mark a path from his earlobe to his neck, he moaned softly, gripping his hands together so he wouldn’t touch the image of sex-personified on top of him. When Draco sucked hard on the pulse-point at the base of his throat, however, his restraint broke and he buried his hands into the silken strands of hair.
Remus walked into the large room holding the newly marked youngsters. To his – and everyone else’s – surprise, all the sixth year Slytherins that were present also chose to be marked by his godson. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of silence from a previously noisy room. Looking around, he quickly put the goblet he was holding on the table next to Tobias.
He decided that he would head home and put that memory into a vial for Severus to watch. He would get more amusement out of watching Tom poke Ronald Weasley with a Potion Masters tool than anyone else.
Tobias woke early the next day wrapped in his husband’s arms. He turned and nuzzled into the porcelain chest, licking the skin and moaning softly in delight at the slightly sweet-salty taste.
Harry chuckled then sighed. “I owe you an apology, Draco. I should have taken your hand in friendship six years ago, like I wanted to, and not have listened to Ronald Weasley.”
“Yes, but only because Tobias stopped Draco from killing him since Tobias was taking it out on him instead of the person who did it.”
Tobias leaned back into Draco, his eyes half-closing. “Your words of poison are worthless to us, so please stop polluting the air, it is necessary for humanities survival.” Tobias turned and kissed Draco smack-bang on the mouth before leading him to the seats at the front of the classroom.
“Thank you for writing to Pateras for me,” he said, looking up from the bowl. “I would like to give you a reward – however there are rules. Do you accept?”
Tobias nodded, eyes almost closed. Chuckling, he stood and picked his sleepy husband up. “Excuse me a moment,” he murmured, turning toward their room.
George watched anxiously as Fred submitted to a barrage of tests that would have made the both of them cringe had they not become used to casting the very same spells on each other to monitor themselves when testing their new products. The frown that appeared on the Healer’s face made his heart skip a beat.
Standing outside the seating hall inside Malfoy Manor, Harry waited. He was wearing black Dragon leather pants with a silver chain-mail belt, a deep green, almost black, shirt that made his eyes look hypnotic, black boots with bronze buckles and stitching and – Harry’s favourite – a cloak with hood, Slytherin green in colour with the symbol that would signify his adoption – a snake wrapped phoenix – in silver. If he was startled when the door opened, he did not reveal it. He looked into the onyx eyes of his potions professor and nodded silently in greeting.
“Blaise, you are disowned from the Greengrass family for crimes against said family,” the healer stated, white-lipped in anger.
This was attached to a set of three expandable metal rings by Acromentula silk that had been soaked in dragon’s blood – making it near indestructible. The first ring sat just behind the fringe of the mushroom head while the second and third rings cradled the bulge that was the result of the first piece of the device. Along with the Acromentula silk, a thin strip of steel ran down the underside of the bound cock.
Tobias sighed happily and closed his eyes, smiling slightly as he felt the gentle strokes on his now visible bulge and an answering flutter from inside.
“It seems that my appointment book is surprisingly clear at this point in time, gentlemen.  I am … intrigued in what Mr Potter has to talk to me about.” With that, Voldemort – the Dark Lord of the age – followed the Malfoy heir into the flames
“Luna is doing just fine youngster,” the overly cheerful man stated with a grin. “We got the small blood problem sorted out.”
~Yesss~ he hissed in delight. ~Sssssoooo good. Ssssoooo delightful. Need more!~ He slowly rose and lowered himself back down. ~Mine! All mine! Ssssooo good!~
“Just do what you can without books,” Tobias said with a happy laugh, “If we all finish what we can, we can discuss the ones we’ve answered before moving onto the ones we haven’t.”
Both boys looked around in awe while the two Daemons watched them with identical smirks. The room was a dull off-white with the highlights in tan with pale fern green vines swirled throughout it. The rest of the room was completely white with odd bits of bold colour scattered around. The bed was cream and covered with a mix of blood red, black and yellow-tipped pink rose petals.
Myrtle screamed and disappeared into the toilet, making sure to splash water over everyone. A shield stopped them from getting wet. “Shall we continue?”
She let out a soft sob as the memory ended, feeling tears roll down her cheeks. She ran from the classroom as the next memory started – watching a news bulletin about a triple homicide occurring in Surrey, discovering it was Harry’s family and blaming it on him with questioning it – not even when the neighbours reported the begging, the pleading and the screams that came from the house at all hours of the day and even though they called the police nothing was done.
Tobias was a little disappointed that he was stopped from doing what he had planned, but he had seen the spark of pleading in Draco’s eye and so had stopped. He was just starting to wonder where his other half had gone to when he felt something cold and slippery hit his back, followed by his husband’s warm hands. He couldn’t stop the moan that came from his mouth as he was straddled – taking the strain off Draco’s wrists.
“Lovely,” Draco murmured to Tobias, only to make a face and shudder when he turned away. “We will both be brushing our teeth before our next class.”
Tobias stood and walked from the room, rubbing tiredly at his eyes. “I’m too tired for this shit,” he mumbled to himself as he sleepily made his way to a room close by for his next meeting.
Hermione winced at the weight of sarcasm that fell from the Italian-born wizard’s lips when Albus Dumbledore was bought up, but found she could do little else.
Hermione sat at her desk, looking at the book before her while trying to keep her hands from shaking. All throughout the day her memories would surface. First it had been just the memories of talks with the Headmaster which she learned to accept or ignore, but then the memories started to alternate between the pride her parents had of her, followed by their disappointment in her actions and their last words to her before she left after Christmas.
Both Tom and Lucius blinked in astonishment at the news. They’d had no idea at how much The Pack studied. They had the feeling that it was Tobias’ influence on the small group.
George had requested that his Alpha come since it was vital that the two of them have a chaperon. Tobias had agreed and Draco had invited himself along so he could take Tobias for lunch when the couple was with Padma’s father.
“That is true,” Tobias mused, “but still, we should warn the rest of The Pack as well as Severus and Minerva. Just in case.”
His Grace Alasander Mitchells cleared his throat. “”Now that we have your attention,” he continued in a normal volume, even though his tone was scathing, “we can begin. Amelia, if you will?”
The man stepped forwards and the sound of ripping fabric, followed by more obscenities, filled the room.
The silence in the room was absolute in the moments after both beast and boy vanished.  Suddenly, a flame flared in the centre of the room.  When the flame had disappeared, a young man stood in its place.
Tom just looked at him levelly. “So you are the one responsible for everything that has happened to my son. I will give you a warning old man. You come anywhere near MY son – particularly while he is in such a delicate state – and I will show the world just how dangerous I can be – muggleborn or not.”
“It is such a simple design that I should have been able to think of it sooner than I did. The main component is Mercury – which is normally a liquid, but I found that boiling it with the venom of a basilisk, the saliva of a Griffin and the tears of a death phoenix for seven and a half days solidifies it into a large sphere. It can then be forged using the flame of a Vipertooth living the heart of an active volcano and then set using the chill from a dementor’s heart.
The next day found Tobias in a very bad mood. He had to go back with the Weasleys. While this in itself was not enough to put him in a bad mood, it was that he had to return to The Burrow, where he was sure that both Ron and Hermione would be waiting to ambush him on Dumbledore’s orders.
“Now,” he stated as he removed the remains of the last tube, “We wait half an hour for them to do their job.”
Neither boy revealed any emotion to this. Poppy filed it away for further study at a later time. At the moment she had more important things to deal with.
Amelia nodded her understanding and hid a smile. “Lucius then,” she agreed when she got herself under control, “how can I help?”
“If it isn’t safe enough for me to visit my son, then it sure as Hell isn’t safe enough for my son in his condition. Now, are you going to let me in, or do I have to hurt you?”
Lucius laughed nervously and removed the faked laws from his pocket, along with the laws currently in circulation. “Then let us do this son. I do not wish to remain in the same room as her for longer than necessary.”
Amelia jolted slightly when a hand was gently placed on her shoulder and looked into a pair of concerned blue eyes.
During this part of the meal, the two of them spoke of their pasts – family life, previous partners and if they slept with them. Draco had been surprised to discover that he was Tobias’ first relationship and if it hadn’t have been for his Uncle he would be pure. Discovering this, Draco hurried to reassure his intended.
“Yes, you were so difficult to place, and it was such a disappointment to not be able to put you in the right house. Well, that is to be expected, with you being the Founder’s Heir and all.”
Tom deflated when he heard that. He didn’t know what he would have done if he’d been responsible for his son to abort his child. He wouldn’t have been able to forgive himself. Anything that would keep his family safe was worth a few moments of distraction. He nodded and quietly went back to the report he was attempting to read and understand.
Faster than anyone expected, the ex-Headmaster sent a sparkling black ball of magic at the teen, sending him into the wall with a crash.
“We thank you for you consideration Drimbolweave,” Tobias intoned with a bow. “You honour us with your presence in our negotiations.”
Stumbling out of the fireplace at Malfoy Manor, Severus bellowed, “Lucius!”  Almost at once a house-elf arrived at his side.
Minerva smiled from her place at the breakfast table as her youngest college strode confidently into the room. It had been many years since the young man had given off such a potent aura of self-confidence – far too long in her opinion.
“I do NOT want to think of that Severus!” Lucius whined. “My son has not, will not and never will be a sexual creature. He’s sexless. That is final!”
A soft breath of air sent the minute amount of powdered bacterial matter into his victim’s face, where it was absorbed into his body through the damp tissue of this eyes, nose, ears and mouth.
Tobias turned to face the basin and half closed his eyes. “Open,” he hissed. Multiple gasps tore from his pack’s throat as the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was revealed Tobias turned to those behind him. “Welcome to my - and Draco’s, soon enough - new abode.”
Draco jokingly suggested letting one of them piss him off and then let his guardian of the day to deal with the two of them. No one laughed for long when Tobias pointed out that today’s guardian was not only a reptile, but also the king of the serpents itself. Since then, everyone made sure not to give Tobias too much grief. After all, nobody wanted to come face-to-face with a basilisk with Tobias’ temper.
“You are most welcome. I’m assuming you do not require me to tell you to keep your eyes closed for a few more minutes while the Healing stabilizes.”
The Pack walked into the Great Hall cautiously. First to enter were Neville, Ginny and Luna as the school were still not aware of their friendship with the Slytherins. After they were at their seats Millicent, Theo and Blaise entered. A few seconds after they had moved forwards, Draco appeared with his arm around his husband’s waist in a protective manor. Tobias sleepily snuggled into his husband’s side, not caring that the Professors and the students were watching them. Almost immediately after they had entered, Pansy, Greg and Vince followed them.
“Be-fore I can re-react, Dumbles points his wand at m-me and h-hits m-me with t-two sp-ells. O-one to p-prevent su-suicide and the other to pr-prevent D-Dementors from k-illing me or driving me ins-sane. H-he b-brings in the A-Aurors a-and they arrest m-me for mu-murder. I g-get sent t-to A-Azkaban w-without a trial wh-where I-I’m forced to relive my parent’s death, Sirius falling through the veil, this Summer at the Dursley’s, the betrayal of my ‘friends, my killing P-Pateras an-and Dumbles k-killing my Draco.”
Laughing, they headed for the table where they assumed the smell was coming from. Draco helped himself to one of the buns they found there while Tobias read the note left with them.
Voldemort stood. “When the boy wakes in the morning get into contact me, I have something I would like to discuss with him.”
Minerva nodded and walked out of the room, head held high and her heart lighter than she thought possible.
Ten minutes later, Severus and Remus followed Tobias back into the room. No one missed the fact that the two of them were touching. Draco smiled as the two of them sat together. He smiled wider when Tobias sat beside him and started eating with relish. The crowd around them were gob-smacked when Draco stole a bloody piece of meat from Tobias’ plate and ate it. There was silence when Tobias softly licked away the juices left on Draco’s fingers and lips. Tobias smiled and snuggled into Draco’s chest and whispered something. Draco whispered back, before nodding. The two of them stood.
Looking at his charge, he almost smiled. He was eating a bowl of fruit with the same enthusiasm that Draco was eating kippers on toast. The young Lord was also writing a letter – his quill flying across the parchment. Severus smirked when he realised that Draco couldn’t keep his eyes off his betrothed.
Lucius sighed. “I have no idea. The only thing I know is that they are trying to get Fudge to allow them to sit their NEWTs before the end of the year.”
Vince, Greg and Millicent stretched. They had just finished an exercise routine with their weapon of choice. None of them spoke, but none of them needed to. Their Alpha and his Beta would be returning to Hogwarts where they would be under the eye of the most manipulative man to be in control of the school, and they would need protecting. It was their job to protect The Pack from physical attack, so their Alpha could focus on what was important. It was a job they took very seriously, and Merlin help those who received their wrath because by the time they were finished with them, not even Beelzebub himself would be able to make them suffer more.
“Firstly it is so Padma and Mister Weasley can get to know each other better before bonding. I know they have four years until they must bond, but if they can become firm friends within that time, the bonding itself will be easier on them and, if love comes, then they will be blessed. Second is I am removing Pavarti from Hogwarts and taking her back to India. Her mother and I will be going with her to spend time re-associating ourselves with our roots. I would remove Padma as well, but she is thriving here and I do not want to interrupt her schooling.”
Severus shrugged. “Since that day he has kept me and Lucius close, examining and testing the magic in and around the mark, trying to figure out a way to remove it. With Tobias’ help, I have been brand-free since Sunday afternoon.”
Severus downed another shot of Scotch, unaware that Lucius and Voldemort – who had just told those closest to him to call him Tom in private – watching him sadly. They knew that this was the only way to punish Severus properly. Not even one full day and the man was already drunk. The two men were almost sorry for the students the normally bitter man taught, they also agreed that neither man would ever keep the two apart. A rather Slytherin approach, they had to agree.
Minerva looked confused at best. “Ok, Miss Granger. Start from the beginning – I want the full story and don’t leave anything out. I don’t understand what you are talking about.”
The man paled, eyes pleading him for mercy. Tobias grinned maliciously. “Now, why did you throw this toy at me?”
It wasn’t fair to the female sex, Amelia could agree with that, but in a world where corrupt men held the power and were long lived, there wasn’t much of a choice. At times, Amelia found herself thinking about what would change if You-Know-Who was in a position of power before she shook herself out of her thoughts. Still … the way that both Severus and Lucius spoke of the man before insanity overtook his mind caught and held her attention and nothing she did would allow it to loosen its hold on her mind.
They heard a gurgling sound behind them and Severus hoped that Draco would make it to the bathroom in time.  Instead of looking, he started drawing runes on Harry’s chest while Lucius recited a lengthy magical formula and directed it at Harry. When the men had finished, Harry let out a whimper.
He was interrupted from his scrutiny by something that resembled a whimper. Turning his eyes forward, he saw a scene that he knew he would never forget for as long as he lived.
Third she would talk to Neville about helping her again. Hmm, maybe she should actually ask that first … Nah, she could do it alone if she had to: she just thought that Neville would like to participate this time. She was sure that he would, he had, after all, wanted to kill the red-headed prat after almost hitting Alpha with that spell. She grinned lazily and skipped the rest of the way to her common room.
“Yet neither do we advertise it. Now, we have to go reassure an over protective, hormonal, dark-haired mother hen that we are alright.”
Tobias nodded. “You’re hired. You are also to try and keep the incompetent imbeciles away from me. Also, talk to Winky for me. Tell her that there is a family that wants a nursery elf in the future and they will be wanting a good elf for that job. Tell her that you are sure that she will get the position, but she needs to stop drinking, clean her act up and show that she is a willing house-elf that will do as she is told. Do not tell her who the family is.”
Ginny and Luna lowered their quills in perfect synchronization on their last exam with a large sigh of relief. They had worked as hard as they could in the time frame they had been given. They were onto their fourth day in the room and they had finally gotten through all eleven exams and their practicals that went with them.
Severus smiled, nearly killing all students and most of the teachers in the hall. “Congratulations, Tobias. And welcome to the family.”
Severus nodded his understanding. “I will go see your father tonight under the guise that he has called a meeting. I will explain all of this too the family in one go and get them to organise a visit to a healer we all trust. Until then, is there anything he can have that will make him act more like himself – or at least make it so that he can stay awake during his lessons?”
“Milord, I have something I must tell you, Remus, Lucius and Narcissa. It is concerning your heirs,” the man whispered.
He opened his eyes to see a little girl of around six staring at him holding a stick that was in the right position to poke someone with. Taking a breath, he scowled at the girl. “Don’t you know not to touch other people?”
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Padma asked one of the goblins before them. “Is it true that the goblin nation is predominantly Matriarchal rather than Patriarchal?”
“I am going to kill him,” Draco stated as calmly as he could to his mother. “Then I am going to bring him back and kill him again. I will do this over and over until I have killed all of the stupidity out of his brain, then I will kill him again, remove his head and stick it into a globe. Due to his dragging me into the library and sticking me to a seat with a sticking charm after he heard me tell my PRGENANT HUSBAND that I would be with him soon. I now have been ordered by him that if I want to see him again before the birth of HIS – not OUR, but HIS child, I am not allowed to go searching for him and then he signed the gods be trice damned letter with a fucking blood quill so even if he didn’t mean it, I still lose my family if I go looking for him! So I decided to do the next best thing and search for my idiot of a Father so that when he eventually does come back to me, I can give him the head of the fuck head that made me late in the first place to display in a silver plated globe!”
Minerva stood and exited the room, not caring that the two largest gossips in the school were staring at Hermione in shock. Nor did she care that the information would be around the school within three hours of the start of breakfast.
Sorry for missing last week, I was visiting family and couldn't take my writing with me. This chapter has a warning!
“Technically I have finished it. You were the one who ordered another serve without asking me if I could eat more,” Tobias stated stubbornly.
As one, The Pack rose and went to great their Pack-sisters. Everyone watched in shock as the two girls were swallowed by the crowd and nuzzled by every person. Severus blinked in surprise. He had no idea how it had happened, but the young ones had honestly formed a pack. He was just starting to think about if their animagus forms had anything to do with it when an unmistakable voice sounded.
Harry’s mouth went dry as his pet slid fully into view, finally understanding the reason he had found a note telling him to wear the things on his bed and nothing else. This was the reason he was to be found in his Lord’s robes when he was in the safety of his own home.
Gaia sent Draco a half-smile, revealing that she knew what he was thinking. Nodding once, she turned and walked away from the eating area, knowing the two boys would follow her.
“That’s good,” Luna said, staring dreamily at something just over Hermione’s shoulder. “That means we can say everything that has happened to her as part of her punishment was for her own good. It’s the same thing isn’t it?”
“I have a job for the two of you,” Tobias stretched. “First I will tell you the rules, then you will say if you accept, then I will tell you what the job is. Are you interested so far?”
“Mr Black – or should I say Master Riddle? A pleasure to see you once again.” Mrs Longbottom turned to her grandson. “Neville, are you well?”
“Oh I’d believe it,” Amelia stated, glancing at the papers once more. “You’ve also been bitten by a werewolf?”
Lucius looked around the room, searching for his son. When he noticed that his son and son-in-law were not in the room, he went searching for them. When a pale and shaking Lucius re-joined the group, everyone stopped and looked at him.
“I see there is a problem. Can I help in any way?” he asked politely with a slight amount of concern.
Minerva cornered the twins before they could follow their Pack members out of the Hall after the meal had finished. “We want to talk to the two of you in my office, she said calmly. “Don’t worry, they will be returned to you for the night,” she added with a roll of her eyes to the pouting black-haired teen that had just flamed next to her.
“We may all have been on differing side in the last conflict in the Wizarding world,” Lucius stated, bring everyone’s attention to him while Amelia collected herself, “but whether we are dark, light, grey, neutral or foreign, we all want the same thing – a safe future for your children. In the beginning, I was a perfectly loyal member of the Dark Army. I had just been bonded to my wife and had discovered she was expecting a child. AS is tradition, we announced the good news …” Lucius trailed off, lost in past thoughts. “Three days later, three Merlin-condemned days later, I found Narcissa at the end of the charms corridor covered in blood and bruises with a note carve into her stomach reading ‘Death Eaters don’t deserve children.”
