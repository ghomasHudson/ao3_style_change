“Well, you needed to hear it. Really, Harry, it’s painfully obvious.” He flushes because he knows she’s right. Hermione stands up, gathering her parchment and books together and putting them into her satchel with practiced precision. She pauses a moment, satchel slung over one shoulder, looking at him with a fond but long-suffering smile on her face. “I think I saw him hanging around the courtyard.”
a recluse,” Malfoy says pointedly. It’s almost surprising how the two of them slip into this comfortable dynamic like they’ve spoken more than simple pleasantries the few times they’ve seen each other since the trials, but it feels natural. Like they’ve finally reached the place where they’re supposed to be. Harry rather likes it.
“Okay, so. Er, I was just wondering… I mean if it’s weird you don’t have to answer, just, forget I asked, or something–”
“You wouldn’t dare,” says Harry.
By the time they get out, they have about ten minutes. So naturally, Draco panics about what to wear while Harry just throws on something comfortable, because he knows he’ll be taking it off soon anyways. Cuffed jeans and one of those baseball t-shirts Draco thinks his biceps look really good in. He tucks the design of the tattoo into a pocket just as Draco comes back out of the bathroom, having decided to put on black skinny jeans and one of his sheer green shirts that sparkles like stars. Another thing of Draco’s he adores.
“God, Draco,” is all he replies at first, and Draco’s met with the sinking feeling that he’s said too much. Then Harry grasps Draco’s hand and brings it to his mouth, and brushes his lips over his knuckles so gently it’s barely even a kiss. “I love you, so much. My Draco, my home.”
“Good morning, Theo,” Draco says. “One thirty year old for you to poke needles into. Right on time.”
The crowd cheers.
“I, er.” Sunlight reflects off Malfoy's grey eyes, traces the contours of his face, and spills down his body in a way that makes him look so
“What?” Harry asks, perturbed.
Harry takes no pleasure in being right.
“Mhm.” A shiver goes through him when Harry brushes his knuckles down Draco’s cheek. “Gorgeous.”
“Message three, February 1st, 6:34pm.”
“Ready,” Harry says definitively.
“The only thing I spike your conditioner with is my own brew of detangling agent,” Draco says, tugging on a longer piece of Harry’s hair to make his point. “Hey, look, this bit’s completely grey.”
Draco takes a bite of the cookie and chews for a moment. “Both,” he concludes, swallowing.
. God, Draco is a
“Novelty worn off?”
“Yes, I heard what you said perfectly. Yes, I think he’s attractive, anyone attracted to men would, and even if they weren’t, one can appreciate good looks when they see them. Yes, I think you’re being incredibly conspicuous about your crush on him and should just go and ask him out to save Ron and I from listening to how much you like him when it’s clear he feels exactly the same. Anything else?”
“Let me what?” Draco asked, puzzled. Cookie batted at his face, and he glared at her before resuming the gentle stroking of her back.
“Who’ve you been lunching with, then? His evil doppelgänger who’s infiltrated the Ministry?”
“Notunpleasant,” Harry rushes out, eager to move on. Draco snorts. “
Fuck it.
“Yes, thank Merlin that I’ve been spared your chicken scratch. Bright side to everything, I suppose,” he said lightly, and they dissolved into a peaceful silence while Harry went about packing orders and setting the machine for Draco’s regular lunchtime hot chocolate. He was aware that having hot chocolate as a staple part of his diet made him sound five years old, but he had given up on caring about what other people thought years ago. And Harry’s hot chocolate tasted way better than the stuff he could make at home.
“Is everything alright?” he asks slowly. Draco still doesn’t respond, so Harry goes and sits in the chair next to him. There’s lines where his eyebrows are pinched together, and Harry longs to smooth them out with his fingers. “Draco, what–
Ron snorts, coming up behind her and hugging her waist. “Hermione Granger? Is that you I hear spilling secrets from the Department of Mysteries?”
. Draco pulls out his wand and points it at Harry’s nose. It’s a testament to the trust Harry has for him that he doesn’t flinch — he would if it was anybody else. With a flick of his wrist, Draco makes the glasses pull away from Harry’s face and zip away to float in mid-air. Harry huffs. “You look like a puppy crup that’s had it’s tail stood on.”
Malfoy sniffs, as if that was exactly what he was going to say. “Granger and I work together.”
Harry Potter was asking him out. To a ball. As his date. Wait, was he? Or was he just taking him as a friend? Asking to be nice? No, he wouldn’t be so worried about it if it was just as friends. But… “As your date?” Draco asked, just to be sure. Misunderstandings never brought anything good.
Auror Dunbar presented a small bag from his robes and held it out to him. Auror Savage was looking at him with so much pity in her eyes it startled a noise out of him. He shook his head.
“Ha. Ha. Gimme them.”
, Malfoy’s trousers are
“Message one, April 6th, 4:12pm.”
“They get things right on occasion,” Harry jokes. Briefly, he thinks of the headlines about his sexuality, then almost as quickly wonders why it matters when he’s talking to Malfoy. It doesn’t, right? “It makes me sound like an old man when I say this, but most days I prefer plants to people. Especially journalists.”
, I see you.”
“Look at me,” Harry says, turning Draco’s face towards him with a nudge, though he doesn’t open his eyes. With a sigh, he drops his hand from Draco’s cheek and brings it to where his other is still drawing patterns on Draco’s wrist. This time, he doesn’t flinch, so Harry considers it a success and carries on, slowly pushing up the sleeve of his own jumper, giving Draco ample time to pull away if he wants to. He doesn’t.
Sitting up, Harry tries to glare at Draco the best he can. Evidently it doesn't work very well because Draco just laughs at him and crawls on to the bed.
“No. Never have, never will.” Harry buries his head in Draco’s chest and wraps his arms around his waist, squeezing tightly. “Draco. My darling. What did I do to deserve you?”
Malfoy himself seems to light up at the admission. “Took you long enough.”
Finally, when the two of them go inside, it’s to find that everyone bar Harry’s close friend group have left. Nobody seems even remotely surprised at their joined hands; Ron hands over 10 galleons to Hermione; Neville and Hannah, the nice people that they are, just smile; George winks at Harry and proceeds to get elbowed by Bill; Fleur, Angelina and Ginny are talking in a corner and barely acknowledge them; and Luna takes one look at them both and says;
Harry.”
a wizard, so a subtle impervius mixed with a notice-me-not charm keeps his clothes dry and the muggles unknowing.
“That was very eloquent of you.” Draco’s cheeks are flushed now, his eyes glistening, smile playing about his lips.
“That’s it?” Draco asks, bemused.
“Mrs Sayre’s sleeping draughts,” Draco replies slowly, waving his wand to turn down the heat under the cauldron. He picks up four of the sprigs, placing them into the mixture one by one, and Harry keeps one eye on the brew as it turns from violet to a dark purple with each flick of Draco’s wand, stirring the potion. Watching potions be made is much more interesting when there isn’t a professor breathing down your neck, Harry thinks. “There should be a few vials over in the pond. Go and fill the smaller one with that extract, and bring the bigger ones over here for this.”
A laugh bursts out of Draco then, pitiful and exasperated and disbelieving all at once, and he shakes his head.
“Okay.” Harry swallows. “Promise you won’t run away?”
about ‘goddess divine’.”
Harry stands dumbly a little ways away, asking himself how he can look so… so
“You’re still not going to tell me what you’re getting, are you?” Draco asks, right before they disapparate.
“I know. Be my New Year’s kiss, Malfoy?”
“Oh, ha ha, Potter,” Draco choked out.
“Hey, don’t,” he says softly, taking the sketchbook from Draco’s hands and placing it on the table. He takes Draco’s left hand in his and tries to turn his arm over, but Draco snatches it back and holds it against his chest.
“Mhm?”
Malfoy nods slightly hesitantly, like he’s unsure why Harry’s even speaking to him. Harry isn’t quite sure himself. “Mother taught me as I was growing up. Both sides of my family have French origins.”
“Let you work here,” Harry said, picking up two cups of hot chocolate, one with Draco’s name written on it and the other for himself.
“That sounds beyond cliché, Potter.”
“Why? Want some?” Harry asks, dangling the bottle in front of his face.
They sit in silence for a little while; Harry gazing at his firewhiskey and contemplating finishing it off and throwing himself off of the balcony upstairs, and Luna smiling next to him, her stare burning into his cheek.
“Harry?” Draco interrupted, stepping closer.
I’m joking!”
“I couldn’t help it.” Harry brings his lips close to Draco’s ear, and whispers, “Your arse looks really good in those trousers.” He feathers kisses down Draco’s neck, then rests his head in the crook of it and lets his arms curl around Draco’s waist.
Draco’s whispering it against his lips, “why?”
“Good doesn’t mean you can talk with food stuffed in your mouth.” Cookie meowed. “Exactly, Cookie. He’s disgusting.”
"Oh." Draco said. "It sounds cool."
“And you called her a liar?” said McGonagall.
He didn't understand what was happening. He had felt fine until then. He was content with life, and was so excited for his first day of Hogwarts until Harry Potter rejected his handshake. Rejected his
He slipped out of the compartment, looking down both ways and was relieved to see no on there. He then begun to stalk down to one side where he knew the Slytherins sat. Trying his best not to look too ominous, he glanced in to each compartment as he passed, earning himself more than a few scathing looks.
"I know." Draco said dully, as if he or anyone else in the school didn't know. Harry stuffed the Cloak somewhere in his robes and sat down next to Draco with a sigh.
like this one once in a while, his body might actually think to heal itself.
no excuse why I've been gone. even this chapter felt hard to write, so I did the best I could! I'll try and make things pick up some more in the next update.
. Nobody would be able to force you to share the secret, not even through methods of coercion such as Veritaserum, Leglimency, the Cruciatus Curse or the Imperius Curse."
"Yeah." Draco mumbled, and Harry was gone.
"Only one place to go is up, Draco." She said, her face like stone. "Your ledger is clean now. Make a new start with it."
Harry looked at his friends, feeling a warmth in his chest. "Of course. I couldn't- Wouldn't be here without you guys. I'm sorry I'm such trouble."
Sorry i won't write essays like this all the time. Thanks again to people bothering to read this shit!
"Bloody hell, what's got you so jumpy?" Draco narrowed his eyes at the boy. "Are you sick?"
"Nothing short of utmost loyalty." Draco said with ease, the words having been echoed to him for years.
"Right." Draco stood up, still not making eye contact with either and turning to the door. "Thank you. Good night."
Draco groaned and Harry chuckled. He looked considerably better after his the Weasley's came to see him, and Draco was glad to see he didn't look quite on edge as earlier.
"I don't understand a lot about him either, to be honest. I think what's important is that he's
"Has nothing to do with you." Bill said firmly. "You needn't feel so responsible for something I assume you weren't even aware of."
"Oh don't be so crass. It doesn't matter if you didn't, everybody knows by now. He had one of those fits in Trelawney's class the other day. Does he tell you about them?" She asked, leaning in with eyes like a hawk's gaze on its prey.
"Oi. What are we doing?" Harry hissed at him, hoping Snape didn't see their hesitation. Ron jolted and looked at Harry sheepishly.
"Sorry." Malfoy said with a mischievous grin. Harry snorted and couldn't help but start laughing afterwards. After a moment, he heard Malfoy join in. The sound of it put an image in to Harry's mind of light that filtered in through windows during the day. The kind that was golden and clear, illuminating every speck of dust flying through the air. He then recognised it from Potions earlier that day.
. I didn't come in here to fight with you, and Merlin help the
Once he passed through the doors, he quickened his pace in to a light scurry and followed a swish of robes that had disappeared around a corner. He followed after the boy, panting slightly and wondering when he started running after people, never mind after Harry bloody Potter.
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September, the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.
"Are you sure it's everything? Your textbooks? Extra quills? Extra drawers-"
Ron thankfully deflated a bit at that.
"Potter? He told you?"
"Where is Moody?" He asked, much too sharp a tone to be using on a group of adults.
"It was all his idea." Harry said guiltily, "I swear."
"Excuse me!" The Weasel said with an undignified squeak, "What in Godric Gryffind-" Weasley started to exclaim before Potter grabbed the boys arm and started to lead him away to the Gryffindor Tower. He cast a glance at Draco as he left.
"Be careful," Ron said, staring at the ear, "If mum sees one of them again…"
"Woah." Harry said, "So like, nobody else will know?"
. You have no reason to, but please trust me when I say this, Potter. I do not intend to join the Dark Lord, or my father if he decides to. My loyalty is to my mother and my name. My father gave his up a long time ago."
-o-o-
Ron entered the bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
I'd take Quidditch over this any day." Harry grumbled, thinking about sunny days on the Quidditch pitch and the fleeting glimmer of gold in the air.
also, pretend that purebloods have tea on Fridays cause they're rich and they just can.
"Yeah." Draco grumbled back, and he was gone.
“We’ll talk about everything tomorrow, no worries, mate.” Harry led Ron out of the bathroom quickly, arms full of both of their stuff. “I need a damn break, anyway.”
." He shook his head ruefully. "Because otherwise they'd end up like me right now. I'm sorry." He said, not looking at Malfoy.
From time to time, only ever in a maximum of intervals of at least a few months, Draco would become obsessed with something. Some lasted longer than others, but he would find an idea or a thing or even a person, and latch onto it in every corner and crevice of his mind.
“Let’s go celebrate, then! I’m sure Hermione will be thrilled, right? How about some Butterbeer?” Harry fired off quickly, hoisting Ron up to his feet as well and picking up his broom for him. “Maybe it was a good thing she let me leave early! One good thing she’s ever done, that hag.”
, will be amongst that geezer's Albus Dumbledore and royal idiot Harry Potter's!"
"So how did you see it?" Harry said, scowling.
"God, the hag's got us on
"I'd say he's less than fine." Pansy said with a snigger. "The boy's a loon! Did you read the Prophet?"
Draco nodded. "You're right. He's a careful speaker. Knows how to not reveal too much."
didn't need anyone thinking him and Potter were…
"I wasn't."
"Well, I have mine too!" Harry said defiantly.
When he opened them again, he exhaled steadily, and begun to write. A stable resolve resided itself in his mind, and his train of thought wondered down one path as he wrote down another on the parchment. The path led to a name. A root imbedded deep in the fallow soil he was stuck in.
"Right." Harry said. "Well, that's cool."
to change, Hermione. I can see it in him, so that's why I don't doubt him."
"I know." Harry said gravely, understanding the sense of impending chaos that the words of Barty Crouch came with, "He looked the most sane when he said it. I could tell it was real.
“I think so,” Harry said, shaking his head slightly and finding that it didn’t spin too much. The nausea had faded until it wasn’t likely to make him vomit again soon, so he got up with a groan.
"No, thank you." Draco blew a sigh of relief, his face feeling very hot for some reason. "Molly would have killed me."
“It wasn’t a tantrum, you bastard.” Harry said angrily, “And
, Professor-" He sputtered. Snape just held up his hand. He seemed to be doing that to Draco a lot these days.
"Pretend?"
"Oh-" He heard after a moment behind him. "Buckbeak! There you are!" Harry said gleefully. The damn thing screeched happily, and Draco swore, shutting himself in the nearest room.
"He woke up not long ago, you should definitely go see him." He heard Sirius's voice say coolly, the
Draco laughed, eyes bright as if taken off guard, “Been reading, have we? What was that, word of the day?”
“What? What is it?” Harry asked insistently.
Draco didn't realise the pain had ceased even as he kept screaming. He still felt it under his skin, burrowing and writhing between his nerves if he moved even an inch. His muscles twitched involuntarily, causing more pain to shoot through to a stabbing in his temples.
The ease at which the man made it out the maze put Draco slightly on edge. It was as if he'd done it before. Or many times before.
"She's not gonna let up, mate." Fred said across from him.
“What?” Harry tugged again, to no avail.
Draco glanced at Harry, who still looked at ease. "Just wanted to help you make breakfast, Mrs. Weasley." Harry said politely, getting up and brushing off his trousers. Draco looked back at her and saw her face break in to a warm smile.
"Okay. That's fine. We can sit next to Sirius. Come on.
"I'm afraid that's impossible. Very old blood magic protects Harry at his relatives house. It impertinent for his safety he remains there." Dumbledore said finally.
cry."
Harry, who was balancing on the tips of his toes on a chair, sighed frustratedly as he craned forward to get the last of the droppings. "You know," He said, "You could just use your wand and help me with this."
"I'll kill you both together." Moody growled, throwing Harry down next to Draco.
If you're still reading, thank you so much!!!!
“You’re right.” Harry said, his voice clear now. “They are just
"Your father didn't tell you?"
"Mostly everyone, mate." Said Fred. "Ones' I saw going in were just Snape, Tonks and Dumbledore. Then there's our lot."
Draco saw a flash of blonde between the hedges and he leant closer to the window immediately, his breath fogging up the glass in front of him. There was someone in the maze, and not just on the outside, but all the way towards the middle. The only person who should have been there was Hagrid, or even Professor Sprout. It was made clear to the students that absolutely no one was allowed near the Pitch.
“The Ministry…”  Harry said, pausing as if to think. That same recklessness from the day before had found him once again. “That’s right. Professor, what was it that I said again?”
"But you're really okay with it?" Harry asked cautiously, because he really hadn't been sure from before. His friends had accepted his and Draco's weird friendship so easily he almost looking for cracks on the surface.
"Why leave the kitchen?" Hermione asked, folding her legs and clasping her hands around them.
At least he'd tried.
wanted to shake him off his arm, but his body wrought with muscle-freezing nerves won out.
"So tell me," Harry continued, "Do you really believe in all that bloody purity bullshit?"
"But you have to agree to never insult my friends again. You can't call Hermione a mudblood and Ron a blood-traitor. You'll keep your bigoted views to
“Yeah, man. And also...about yesterday...what I said…”
"Goodbye, dear."
"Is that a proper goodbye for you?" Draco's voice sounded beside him. Harry rubbed his side with a huff and saw a layer of the room peel back as Draco's head revealed itself. The git still looked tiffed off, but Harry could spot a small twitch in the corner of his mouth.
"Leave me, woman." Draco said forlornly, throwing himself back on to the bed. "I need to brood."
“I want you to write ‘
"Okay." Harry said, shocked beyond belief that Ron was being so…Hermione. Especially since their fight last term. It looked like he was genuinely trying to act more maturely since then, and Harry felt a rush of affection for his best friend. He took the vial, beaming more than he could restrain.
"Er, hi." Was all he could say. He took the time to glare at Sirius behind them, whom was grinning maniacally like a smug bastard.
Harry grabbed the vial, slowly coming back to himself, "It's okay, Dobby. Malfoy is my friend. He's not bad."
"The Minister came today to drop off the prize, and I overheard him and Professor McGonagall arguing. The man nor the Ministry don't believe a word Potter says." Snape said disdainfully. "They likely won't acknowledge it at all just to make the Ministry look less like a zoo than normal."
Harry, for the first time in his life, looked down on someone who wasn’t Voldemort.
"I didn't
Snape's face softened just a fraction, "You need not worry about that right now. Just be vigilant, and for Merlin's sake, leave Potter alone. The only thing him and his family are good at are at getting killed." He went back to his potion, stirring mindlessly, and Draco took it as his cue to leave.
"Champions! At the starting line, please!"
They still had five minutes left, so Harry took the time to scan the crowds. He saw a few familiar ginger heads among the crowd, and he smiled to himself. After that, he spotted a spot of white amongst darkness, contrasting deeply with the dark night they would have to navigate the maze in.
Eight days before the Second Task, they had looked through every book remaining in sections H to Z. Nothing was palpable enough to help Harry stay underwater for more than a few minutes. He'd seen Malfoy in the library from time to time, and they only shared secret worried glances with each other. Harry had not gone down to the Lake since the night after he saw Barty Crouch in Snape's office.
"And no more going out alone. Stick with Granger and Weasley outside of classes." Draco said imperatively, eyebrows drawn together in worry. "In fact, stop coming down here as well. It's just too risky."
Peace. Draco felt complete, utter peace for a few moments. It scared him, because then he had to think about what he was without it all this time.
Draco swallowed heavily and looked away. " 'S fine." He muttered. "Now you'd better go apologise to Granger."
"I heard about it during the time I taught." Remus said, "One of you Slytherin's complaining he'd walked in on them starkers!"
Harry nodded, “She’d just tell me to go to Dumbledore.”
Seamus finally turned around slightly, throwing a glare at Dean. “Why should I?” He grumbled, slightly aggressive with a quick look at Harry.
"Then two options." Remus held out two fingers, his hand wrapped in silver scars from previous transformations. "Either he's feeding all of us the same basic, non-crucial information, keeping it only to a need-to-know basis, or-"
work for the Dark Lord and I will oppose you and your side. If I don't have this role, my place in this war will seat itself next to my father, so
Harry smiled, eyes closed, facing the moon.
Draco's eyebrows drew up in surprise, "Really? What makes you think I can do that responsibly?"
"Merlin, he's gone red!" Fred snickered, elbowing his brother.
Granger narrowed her eyes then took a deep breath, collecting herself. "I wanted to apologise for shouting at you earlier."
“That’s not possible!” Umbridge shrieked, “It’s not, it’s not, it’s not! He doesn’t exist! You couldn’t have-”
"You looked like you were having fun tip toeing around." Harry said from the shadows, and when Draco drew closer to him he noticed the boy's rumpled state. His clothes looked haphazardly thrown on and his eyes were bloodshot and darkened underneath.
"Right. Well, Sirius was my Godfather." He looked at Draco curiously, "I'm not sure if that was public knowledge or not."
-o-o-
The man just chuckled again. "A brave assumption, but how so when I don't have the mark?"
“Blegh, more like who’s the ostrich.” Pansy whispered distastefully, making Draco smile slightly.
"Oh…" Draco said, looking at Remus. He glanced at Sirius, who was looking at the boy with a scrutinizing gaze. "Nice to meet you, Sir. Again, that is. I'm Mal-"
" He added scathingly. Draco hid his wince, knowing he was in trouble of some sort already.
"I don't hate Granger and Weasley all because of their blood. And I don't actually hate all of the mud-muggleborns in our school." He took a deep shuddering breath, "But you have to understand who I am. Who my family is. If I don't think like them then I'm just as good as a squib in their eyes. I…" He broke off, looking more and more lost as he spoke. His white robes stood out brightly in the darkness, and the moonlight seem to favour him specifically, to Harry's chagrin. "I know my father was…one of them. In my family, it's an
"As I said, what's the fun in that." Draco grinned devilishly and Harry wanted to throttle him. "Look at you now, though! So presentable." The boy sighed, looking extremely pleased with himself, "It almost looks less like an owl's nest!"
"I took your wand." Potter said. Draco would have laughed or even glared if he wasn't trying to breathe properly.
If he wasn’t… Well, Draco would just have to wake him.
" He said, reenacting Potter's wide-eyed, open-mouthed face. The boy flushed, casting another glance at Cedric and his date, "I wasn't proclaiming my love, you git. I was looking at Cho Chang."
“Harry, what’s that on your hand?”
been like him for a very long time. As much as he hated that part of himself, it was a bitter part of his past that he tried very hard to forget.
"Yeah." Harry chuckled softly. "People think I'm round the bend nowadays. That hag Skeeter's no help. They think I do it all for attention, and this Tournament's done nothing to get me out of that."
"So you needn't worry about anything I do, then!"
"Night, Harry. Sweet dreams."
"It's true. I don't
“Blimey, Harry!” Ron exclaimed, looking angrily into a conjured handheld mirror. He turned back to the boy and Harry barely held back a wince. “Yellow? Really?”
"You may all collect your materials and begin the first steps of the Potion." Snape drawled, snapping Harry's attention as people around him begun to get up and collect ingredients. He nudged Ron next to him, whom unfortunately looked as out of it as Harry was.
Harry's face softened, "I don't think that applies anymore, Draco. I know you mean it now."
"Hello, cousin." Draco said casually, looking behind him.
"Right," Blaise started, "Say - hypothetically - that he
With one week until winter break, Draco hoped the boy was at least
"Er, no I was pretty bad." He said sheepishly, and heard Weasley snigger.
"I'd probably intrude anyways." Harry smiled. "And I'm giving you full permission to speak on my behalf should you need to."
"Bottomline is," Sirius continued over Remus's fumble, "We've all put to rest what we have with this kid and him with us, correct? Great. Let's get over it. Chap's turning in to a blooming tomato over there."
." Harry shot back warningly.
"Bloody hell." Draco swore, pinching the bridge of his nose. He hadn't thought of all that before. Spending so much time by the Lake and with Harry made him forget just how political Slytherin House was. "I need to fix things." He looked up at Blaise, "What do I do?"
"Why didn't you bloody tell me?" The Weasel accused. "Because you're an idiot!" Granger shot back, all the while Potter snapped his eyes between the two. Finally his eyes found Draco as he neared, and a moment of fear before relief flickered in his eyes. Draco decided to take mercy on the boy for once.
"Harry, start
I don't condone seamus slander, but it was necessary for harry's state of mind and plot and all that shit. not like he was completely in the wrong for reading the situation as it was presented to him, but being an ass about it wasn't cool either way (also i will take deamus to my grave. might be a background pairing if i'm feeling a little crazy).
"And the Bond? What's wrong with the magic?" Draco asked.
, and the boy scoffed, shoulder shaking as he laughed silently.
"Will you go talk to him?"
Harry smiled weakly and room another breath. Merlin, was it that bad?
." Draco snapped insistently. "Look at me! Completely bloody fine!"
"My mother is…she does love me, I think. She just isn't as ominous about her affections. We never hug or anything like that….Oh shit. Look at me complaining about my
Classes ensue. Teachers keep bitching about OWLs and Harry's sick of it. In Transfgurations, they all practise changing each other's eye colours.
“You....” she snarled. “No! No, no, no! I will not have your lies anymore, Mr Potter!”
“Morning.” Draco said, stopping at the entrance and slightly out of breath from the walk up the stairs there.
. Know your place.”
“Oh — that’s brilliant!” said Harry, guilt seeping into his chest. “Merlin, I’ve been a terrible friend haven't I? I didn’t even ask you first thing-”
me to agree, Potter."
"It's enough." Harry interrupted, sounding surer than he'd felt in ages, "It's the biggest chance I've got, and that's all I need."
Draco hesitated, coming to stand at his chair and sitting in it when his father waved a hand in permission to do so. "Well…" He wracked his brain in trying to remember what he did before he said it. He mostly blanked out whenever he was in a duel. "You've been hitting me with that spell for days now, so I knew it's motion before you even cast it. And I know some Latin, so I knew it translated to something like '
Draco subsequently stopped being able to cry by the time he was eight years old. Even if he might have wanted to, he would repress it almost immediately and the urge became almost non-existent. It was like his body had been dried of tears completely, and so he tried to compensate for the lack of feeling by lashing out. He begun to mimic his father's anger and barking tone. He found himself getting jealous of others and irritated much more often. With everyone except his mother, Draco began to become his father and rid himself of his heart.
"You like to cook?" Draco asked, still trying to push down the remainder of his plate of food down his throat. If there was one thing he hadn't expected, it was to see the Boy-who-lived running around the kitchen like a frantic housewife.
"Erm, no. Not exactly." Harry brought his palms up to look at them, wondering why Draco did it all the time and what it was he saw in them. "To a large extent, he really is Malfoy. He's mean, sadistic and for a while had the most awful prejudices about blood purity. That was all him. For a while, I also really did hate him. I hated how he thought he was better than everyone. That he hated them because of who they were without any sort of solid basis. I hated him with all my being so much that I thought he was the Heir of Slytherin and even capable of killing."
“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”
Harry waved a hand through the air lazily, smiling at the woman, “Oh, it’s alright for now. I’ll keep to myself for the time being, though. I do apologise for my misconduct in class yesterday.” He held out a hand for her to shake. The action repulsed him, but he felt it needed to be done to seal the deal. As far as a plan went, he had none, but playing it by ear really did give him the simultaneously best and worst ideas.
"Mhm." Hermione tutted. She let the silence grow for a long time between them, and Harry started to fidget.
"I'm sure they are." Sirius grinned, then let Harry go back to his seat just as the twins sent a cauldron of soup tumbling to the ground after trying to levitate it to the table.
"Uh…Right…Like right now?" Malfoy asked slowly, as if speaking to a child. Harry ignored to snark for the time being, tracing the outline of his scar absentmindedly.
"What hand do you write with?" His father asked in an urgent tone, walking closer to Draco.
"S' it?" Harry mumbled, his eyes almost held down like lead was poured on top of them.
“Umbridge?” Horror flooded Ron’s features, “Just like...Your scar like in-”
"If you think I'm sitting on the ground, Potter, you're thicker in the head than I thought."
"Harry." He heard Hermione's indiscernible voice behind him, "You got a haircut." He couldn't deduce anything in the tone of her voice, and thought maybe she might have been put in Slytherin as well.
"Every year since you've come to this school, you've caused some sort of scene - and it wasn't all solely because of You-Know-Who so don't give me that look." Draco said warningly. "None of that this year, alright? No scheming, no funny business. I don't even want to
"Oh, is that so? Do tell."
“Right,” Harry said, his insides singing with glee. “Why are you asking, miss?”
(See the end of the chapter for

"You're already pretty threatening to the rest of Slytherin, Draco. You might just end up petrifying a First Year, if anything. Everyone thinking you're also the Heir of Slytherin won't be gaining you any favours."
-o-o-
He still couldn't believe it an hour and some later when Harry finally emerged from the depths of the Lake, bringing with him his ginger friend and another blonde girl.
Harry laughed, digging in to his breakfast some more. Draco glanced at his own plate, a quarter of food still unfinished.
"I can't believe you were
“Yes.” Umbridge said, tone now flat. “Nice to meet you both.” She looked over Pansy as if searching for something wrong with her, eyes lingering on her outstretched hand but never taking it. Pansy slowly retracted her hand, the silence in the room becoming deafeningly loud.
"No, actually. It's all true. Sirius escaped and we've been corresponding this past year."
“Maybe Umbridge is just being moody.” Blaise said blankly.
From then on, they began to spend much more time together, and their trust built. By the end of Third Year, Draco could almost understand the Golden Trio's dynamics just that little bit, because he now had his own true friend, and that was Blaise. His questions were partially answered, as he saw the three together around the school and had his own friend to sit with in turn. It satisfied some curiosity inside him, knowing that Potter found company with his other two for the same reasons he found his with Blaise.
" His mother shrieked. "Duddykins, stay with us!"
“No!” Harry burst out, holding out a hand. “It’s, erm, fine.” He took a biscuit out of the tartan and started to nibble at it. Draco just stared at him incredulously.
It's Harry's turn to snort at that, a small beginning of a smile at the corner of his lips. "Wanker."
that part of him thought with glee,
Draco would have counted up the entire night as a hazy fever dream if he hadn't told Blaise about some of it. He wouldn't be surprised if things between him and Potter were the same as they had always been the moment he stepped foot in to the Great Hall.  Some strange part of him almost didn't want that to happen. After what he heard last night, he really did feel like things had to change. One of those things was being an enemy of Harry Potter.
, by a very nice body of water that inhabits a large squid. You catch my drift?” Draco said coolly, sweeping away a stray strand of hair that had fallen over his eyes.
"And if our magic is still developing…" Draco said, filling in the gaps.
"I'm not an idiot. I wouldn't just wait for someone to curse me. Now what are you doing here?" Draco said impatiently.
" Ron reiterated, gesturing to him and Draco, "It's just weird. You guys aren't fighting or anything. Hell, Malfoy looks…not Malfoy." He sighed pityingly as if the entire world had turned upside down.
"Careful." Harry warned, steadying Draco. "What's wrong?"
"I made sure to have the elves pack you extra of everything, and slipped in some calming draughts, because I know you fret during exams-"
"Well it's done now." Draco said irritably, "And it's getting late. Thank you, Sirius." He bowed slightly, causing Sirius's eyebrows to shoot up and glance at Harry amusedly. He shrugged back and followed Draco as he went to retrieve the Invisibility Cloak he'd thrown in to a corner. The boy was muttering under his breath to himself in a huff, and Harry watched in silence as he threw the cloak over himself.
“That so?” Harry looked like he was barely biting back a grin. Chang’s eyes flicked between the two of them. “Maybe you need some help with your eyesight. A good pair of glasses like mine wouldn’t sound so bad right now, would they?”
Harry sighed internally, but was thankful Ron wasn't suspicious about where he'd been. He made a mental note to take his Invisibility Cloak next time.
"Shut it." Ron said. "I do think for myself sometimes, you know."
-o-o-
Could it have been accidental magic? No, it would have been more explosive if it was, and he was pretty sure he was passed that age by now where it happened at all. However he had used magic just now felt controlled, and Harry realised he felt the buzz in his fingertips as evidence that it came from him.
Draco prodded a sleeping Harry's shoulder lightly, to which the boy snorted softly and continued to sleep. He stood in the dark bedroom shared between Harry and Ronald, the door open and hall lights seeping in as the sun barely broke across the sky of the early morning.
"Ugh, fine. What on earth would you mean by that, oh Chosen One?" Draco sneered. It was Potter's turn to scowl, and he crossed his legs and hunched over them, picking stray pieces of grass out of the ground.
Blaise looked at him in surprise, "Really?"
"I don't know what's gotten in to you, boy, but I'm sure you know better than to traipse with the likes of Potter. It will only bring trouble." Snape said sternly.
"What you have is rare, being able to cast with both hands." His father started in the neutral tone he used while teaching, and Draco sat back in surprise at the sudden shift. "There are many ambidextrous wizards, but not as much magically so." His father held out his wand arm - his right - and ran his other hand along it from his shoulder to the tips of his fingers, "Magic flows through our arms from our core, hence why we have a wand arm. It conducts through the bone, and through the conduit of our wands." He flicked his wand once, sending a few sparks in to the air. "Usually, it only flows through one arm. A more concentrated pathway - either your right or left." He gestured to Draco, "In your case, however, you have two pathways. Your core can flow through to the left, or the right."
“Ron? What are you…” he paused, trying to catch his breath.
"I did, Ron! Now I'm going to get some work done, and you both better too!" Hermione scolded.
“It’s fine, Ron-”
“Oh, I’m sure he is! Things are indeed very
speak about my parents, you snake." He said levelly with restrained anger peeking out the edge of his tone.
"He has a son?"
"So then how does that explain both your…changes this term." Hermione asked.
He thought of his father, the Mark on his forearm and the lack thereof on Draco's own.
"No." Harry whispered back. Nobody else would die because of him that night. "Move, Draco."
Harry smiled, "Wait till she tries to feed you six courses in one sitting."
- and Cedric died and Voldemort came back-” The right side of his forehead began to sear with pain, exactly where his scar was. He gritted his teeth together hard in order not to cry out, clutching over his right eye.
"Best not to mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad." Ronald said tensely to Harry.
"Draco? What's up?" Blaise said confusedly, but Draco was already peering out the window. He spotted them immediately - the crowd of red hair. They were surrounding someone - he knew it was Harry and his heart jumped. A great black dog was reared onto its hind legs and its front paws were placed on Harry’s shoulders as he laughed, glasses askew.
i'm back boys ;) i got sick of rereading this chapter cause it was just hard to write for no reason as it is, so if there are mistakes please forgive me.
Charm and Transfigurations went by as normal, but Harry was becoming increasingly annoyed with their teacher’s incessant need to remind them of the importance of their upcoming OWL’s. It’d already been two days and he was sick to his ears about the entire affair.
"I know." Draco said softly. He dropped himself off the bed again with a wince. "Now get to sleep. I just came to check that you were still here."
"What issue?" Draco piped in, but was ignored dutifully.
"I'll think about the being nice thing." Draco said, suddenly extremely tired, "I'll sleep on it, and tomorrow I'll solve it. I'll be better." He couldn't start slacking in his own House. "Sorry Blaise. Thank you for letting me know."
Draco narrowed his eyes at the man. “So, you’re spinning tales that don’t have anything to do with reality-”
Blaise cleared his throat quickly. “I’m his...wife’s son.”
to throw my wand around, Potter."
"Harry?" Draco asked quietly through the side of his mouth.
He heard Draco rustle around with his blankets behind him as he walked to the door.
Ron swore into the mirror again, yellow - almost serpentine - eyes staring back at him. Harry almost shivered.
“Out the way, Potter!” Draco snarled gleefully, meeting Harry just before the desk and shoving him out of the way. The boy bumped into a table behind him and grabbed his ankle with a grunt of pain.
“Something wrong?” Harry asked, peering carefully at Draco.
"Dumbledore has a habit of using people." Remus said, and Draco snorted.
Harry sung his praises to Molly Weasley for picking his sleek black robes. Unlike many other wizards, Harry deigned not to go fully starkers underneath and decided to wear his uniform shirt and black slacks underneath. He almost thought it a mistake and the bloody robes almost suffocated him with it's stifling heat. Harry decided to just fuck it and unbutton the front, allowing air to mercifully cool the sweat clinging to his shirt at the back.
you, in order to hide the fact that you're a spy for the Death Eaters, friends with me and also to ensure you don't actually side with said Death Eaters. Do I have that right?"
Harry stared at him through his fingers, his face sullen with worry. An expression he'd seen many times on Draco.
Without getting in trouble, of course. Should be easy enough.
No. He had seen it. By Merlin, his wand moved. It had even rolled a bit from it's place. He could tell because it's top side didn't have a layer of dust on it anymore.
Harry wakes up revved up to think of something to help get Umbridge off of Draco's ass so he can actually do his job. Despite wracking his brain, he can't find anything and feels useless and shitty.
"I'm sorry!" Harry exclaimed, "I just felt like I needed to!"
Umbridge’s nostrils flared, eyes flicking to his hand. Upon the sight of the ugly scarring, her eyes widened harshly.
“Oh, I don’t know-” Harry brought the hand that had been up in the air down onto his desk with a loud sound. Everyone went quiet, holding their breaths. “maybe
"Yes." He said, just barely not managing to sound like an utter prat.
"Well, if I'm quite honest - and Blaise this stays between
That was something Hermione had once said, back in Grimmauld Place. Did it have something to do with that? It couldn’t be possible, though. He didn’t particularly like Dumbledore, but he was still the strongest, and still their best chance in this war…
He glanced to where Ron was almost dozing off, chin on his hand as he waited for the potion to simmer on low heat. Harry slowly withdrew the note from his robe and held it deftly between his index and middle finger, sort of like a ninja star he'd seen being thrown around on Dudley's television show once.
Dumbledore started out the door, and Bill followed hastily. "Dumbledore, Sir. If you're going to the Ministry, I think I'll tag along…"
Draco stared at the hand for a few moments before taking it and shaking firmly. The girl had an unwavering grip.
A day before the Second Task, Ron and Hermione were walking on eggshells around him, and as much as he regretted it he couldn't quite bring himself to care. He barely spoke and instead just sat and thought about the clue. Maybe it wasn't even in water? Maybe it was a metaphor for water. What was a metaphor for water? Air, perhaps. Did they have air Merpeople? Maybe they were called Airpeople. Harry laughed to himself at the thought.
Harry allowed himself a smile, relieved Malfoy didn’t take it the wrong way, glad for the break in tension. He looked up to the last flight they needed to climb, and put one foot in front of the other, summiting the landing and staring down the familiar hall. Sirius’s room was just there, waiting for him.
“And you think that means that these feelings we have aren’t valid?” Harry asked carefully, cautiously.
“Oh, gods Greg, I’m so sorry!”
“Mhmm.” Draco agreed. They were so close. Soon the penny would drop, and it would be out there in the space between them. The point of no return.
After Hermione had spoken herself hoarse listing all the places Death Herders and thestrals had died out, as well as the devastating consequences for the surrounding magic of the land, and its effect on people, wizarding and muggle alike, she paused. The weight of it all sat around her.
Harry just stared at Draco with a shocked expression before saying, “No. Have you?”
Their kitchen had been updated, but their same mugs still sat upon the scrubbed wood counter. Draco’s encourage-mint was no longer in a small pot but a rather large shallow ceramic tray on his potions bench, sprawling happily out in all directions. Harry had moved his to the bathroom, where it had begun slinking up the clawed foot of the tub from where it sat, taking over, slowly but surely.
“But, little brother, I can’t do that. I can’t carry on. How can everyone expect me to? I remember him in every freckle on my face, in every wave of my wand, every spell and every charm. Every breath of mine was once also shared with him, for our worlds were just so intertwined, just as we were before we came into this place. Before breath. And so, when they wanted to forget, they asked me to join them. And they couldn’t understand why I could not. I could not. How can they not see what cruelty it is to ask me? Here, I am surrounded by his muse, a vision of a world of chaotic happiness, and I am mourning. Always mourning. Mourning and forgetting. I can not. I will not.”
"You locked me in!" Draco yelled again, barely feeling the tears streaming down his face, explaining why his vision had been so blurry and why he felt such a blossoming amount of pressure in his chest.
hello! what i really intended for this chapter was to sort of fill in the gaps as to why Draco is the way that he is, because it had been bothering me that it seemed like he became a good person in one night. I wanted to convey that the way Draco had been conditioned from childhood, in terms of his beliefs in proportion to his actions,  would have been difficult to change in a person just like that. It's pretty detrimental to his character that because of his willingness to change, and patience to re-teach himself how to look at things in another perspective, he is very capable of being a person Harry can actually stand and forgive for his past actions.
"So what has this have to do with you looking like you're about to pass out? And you better tell me the truth, Potter."
The appointment of Umbridge’s new position only further proved to Draco the corruption of the Ministry from the inside, and the heavy burden on his shoulders to act properly became even heavier. The feeling that she was watching him while having decreased in severity, still pushed him to continue to dole out detentions and deduct points judiciously whenever he did his Prefect rounds. He somewhat believed that the more he enacted whatever harsh regime of control she sought after within the school, the less she would suspect him. Whatever feelings of resentment and agitation he felt at his own behaviour, however, he pushed aside to focus on not blowing everything up in his own face.
for expecting a normal year without Harry Potter for once." Malfoy laughed, and Harry scowled at him. "But how on earth did it happen?"
Once outside and a reasonable distance away, Pansy swore colourfully. “That
"Malfoy?" Weasley's voice rang out. He looked at the boy and smiled awkwardly.
Harry hesitated, then slowly explained the blood quill as Ron wiped around the wound and wrapped his hand in a gauze cloth.
Draco sighed. “Acid pops.”
The air immediately felt sucked out of his lungs and he could tell Umbridge felt the same. He suppressed the tightness in his chest, constricting his lungs and threatening to stop him from breathing. Right now, he felt almost as if he’d been split into two people, the one speaking and the other deep inside him: much more genuine to his true self and growing in horror at what the one who was speaking was saying. He just had to get through this, though. Just a bit more time…
"Look, Draco-" Harry started, sitting back down to face him.
She stared for a moment, before shrugging. "Nothing." Then walked away.
i'm still confused about the electricity - magic situation at Grimmauld Place, so i just substituted with a lamp. I may be wrong, though. It must be annoying, being so dark all the time.
Draco froze. "Batter, ma'am?"
"Remember second year? How apparently the Chamber of Secrets had been opened?" He felt his voice becoming less solid, less sure. He felt Blaise nod, the bed rocking very slightly. "It was my father who did it. He gave Ginevra Weasley some diary with…something, and she opened the Chamber. I had no
"Pride is unbecoming." His mother used to say to him as a child, with a small, secret smile when his father wasn't in the room. Draco would smile back, but it was never returned after it disappeared off her face almost as if it had never happened. He never understood why, before he came to realise she never said things like that where his father could possibly hear, and the fact stayed with him tucked away for a very long time.
"Harry. I know. Did he give you that?" Sirius pointed to the cloak, bunched up in Draco's hands.
"Hermione - who are you going to the ball with?" said Ron. Harry and Hermione surreptitiously shared a look behind Ron as he strode out the Great Hall between them, his gaze kept forward with a forced nonchalance that had Harry rolling his eyes behind his back and Hermione smirking in return.
have given me the password to the Prefects Bathroom for specific Tournament purposes." Potter said smugly, and Draco erupted.
“To him personally, no,” he said eventually, his tone completely even and natural.
. It might not go well."
Harry clenched his teeth, trying not to look too haggled. He glanced at the front entrance quickly.
he was talking about.
“Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter.” Umbridge said sweetly, not at all as if she were doling out punishment to a student, “No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag. “You’re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.”
That evening, Ron and Hermione were called off somewhere by McGonagall, and Harry took the opportunity to go talk to Draco. He signaled at the boy from across the Hall at dinner, the first time either of them had initiated a meeting down by the Lake. Harry left first when he received a brief nod and waited for ten minutes before Draco dropped down next to him on the soft ground, a heavy textbook in his hands.
who killed Diggory.” Umbridge hissed, “That’s what you said. If you know something else then-”
"I'm going to have to agree with Granger on this one, Weasley." Draco sidled up next to Potter, halting their argument, "You could have just asked her instead of being all jealous. One would think there was at least one cell up in that thick head of yo- Ow!" Potter had stomped on his foot quite rudely.
He stepped out of the steaming bathroom with a towel around his waist just In time to hear an incessant tapping at his window. He looked and saw it was a familiar white owl with a letter in its talons, impatiently waiting on the ledge on the other side of the glass. His heart jumped, and he all but ran to the window and flung it open.
"Had to, Draco." Harry admitted apologetically.
"Impossible." Draco retorted.
. Not even a bloody letter. If he didn't have his wand with him, he might have thought he was a muggle with a weird wizard fantasy for nine months of the year.
Draco was let go and pushed forwards to the opening of the room, Harry stepping back to let him through. The bird - Buckbeak - pulled it's head from where it was ensconced within the shelter of it's wings. It was a vulnerable, protective gesture and Draco gritted his teeth irritably, looking down on the creature through his nose in an attempt to stave off the glimmer of affection it instilled in him for the creature.
When Draco asked what Harry wanted to do for his birthday, he explicitly said he didn’t want to do anything. He had told him that he never enjoyed his birthdays, nor did he every make a fuss and he didn’t intend to start now. Then he paused and looked inquisitively at Draco and asked, “How did you know when my birthday was?”
Harry’s magic pulsed with alarm as Ron stood up quickly, knocking the cubicle wall as he stood and turned, likely to hand in the paperwork they had been working on. Harry shoved down the panic that had risen, ripping him from his memory of the forest to stare at the fire that had erupted in his empty coffee mug, though, to be fair, it was often more whiskey than coffee these days. He doused it with a quick
Late in the evening, when the pyre had burned down to a more manageable size, and Harry had brought out the kitchen chairs to sit by the edge of the flames, he had asked Draco, “So, what do you want for this year?”
Finally removing the parchment wrapping, the knitted items fell into Harry’s lap and he stared at them for a long while before looking up.
And now? Now it is so, so quiet.
He smiled at Harry reassuringly, “That would be great.”
When the darkness enveloped them, Ron led a cacophony of cheering and clapping. They all rushed forward in an excited mob to hug Draco and Harry, together. Crying. Laughing. Exclaiming how beautiful it all was. How loved they were. Draco was overwhelmed. Overcome. Overflowing. His chest felt tight but his face couldn’t stop smiling.
“What the fuck was that? Did you hear him?” Draco asked, his voice shakey.
“How do we keep ourselves in balance? How do we stop ourselves from being like you?” Harry asked harshly.
fucked. Draco didn’t trust St. Mungo’s to treat Potter after sending him home with such glaringly obvious and dangerous symptoms, but he was terrified of Potter dying on Draco’s watch. They would surely blame him, wouldn’t they? Potter couldn’t die. This fucking prat couldn’t die and leave Draco in this
Harry cleared the sawdust and shavings from his rumpled clothes, and stepped back inside, Draco still deep within sleep, though having starfished out across the expanses of their bed, the duvet half thrown from his form.
“Honestly? No. I didn’t. I had a short list of names and suspicions, yes, and you, Harry, were on that list, but, as I said, I had hoped it wouldn’t be you.”
Luna was only nearing 36 weeks now but looked far further along carrying twins. She carried it well, in her serene way, draped in her usual layers of rainbow cloth and odd, jangling jewellery.
She shrugged. “Death begets death in the places where thestrals aren’t keeping the balance with their Herders.”
“The Death Herders, or the people that worked with the Thestrals, struggled with the fluctuation in magic, too. They worked for years to restore balance, to protect the forests, to increase the number of thestrals. They traveled around the country endlessly working to rebuild the devastated magic using secret rituals passed down to them from previous Death Herders, to help others heal from the trauma of land being ripped up. But there were only two of them for the whole of Japan, and they couldn’t keep up or combat the dark magic that was being performed. Thestrals were still dying, forests were still being taken down, death was proliferating. It was bad. Then, in the 1950’s one of the Death Herders found the forest where the elderly were being sacrificed, and, well,“ she took a deep breath, stealing herself, “they committed suicide, too overwhelmed by what they discovered.”
“You don’t have to explain if you don’t want to. We can talk about it later.” He offered, gently, releasing Draco and taking a step back to give him space.
“Oh, you know, around—” She said with a prevaricate air, still smirking.
Harry ran his hands across the wood, dusting away some shavings, feeling the grain beneath his palms. He had carved a hyaena for Fred, the little spotted semblage of his patronus, rolling in the grass, laughing at the sun, full of joy. At the other end of the slab, he had crafted a coyote, one that howled and yipped and called for his brother. Both of the creatures longed for their pack, often meeting in the middle of the wood, rolling and snapping around each other, the love between them plain. Brothers.
Beneath all of Harry’s writhing and twisting malice, was fear. He needed Draco to be safe. As soon as Harry recognised it, he took a great shuddering breath and slumped back in his chair, his hand over his own chest, his heart thrumming against his palm. He was scared.
“Oh my god.” Harry moaned, loudly, fighting off the creature with ineffective shoving. “
Harry knew he was smiling, and he could feel it radiating from him.
“Of course.” The smile Harry gave him was radiant and understanding. It held no malice or bitterness. “Can I touch you?”
Severus eyed him shrewdly. “You just have that sickening happy and contented visage that I only ever saw when you bested Potter in school or when I took house points from Gryffindor for Potter's unnecessary heroics. Notice the common thread.” he said poingently.
______________________
“Dumbledore,” Harry said with all the authority and command of an Auror, speaking to the velvet chair, “I don’t have time for your mysteries today, we had an appointment.”
He got up and moved to stick the garishly yellow square on the window frame by his encourage-mint before he could think better of it.
him. Harry told his friends he was
A look of understanding crossed the barman’s face, and he motioned for Harry to follow him back to the toilets. Harry had never seen him leave behind the bar before, and he followed him, eagerly, his magic crawling around, hungrily.
Ron gestured to the remaining empty chair between the two women and Draco awkwardly shuffled to take his seat as he addressed Hestia, “Carrow, wasn’t it?” he asked, unsure of himself.
Homeward Bound was spelled out in an ornate gold across the dark green canvas covering. Harry felt his heart ache. He imagined Sirius’s wry smile and jaunty confidence, his moments of kindness and bravery. He had wanted a home with Harry to live out his life, to enjoy the sunshine and sing and be nothing but carefree. A home away from this hateful place. This mausoleum. Harry held back a sob. It was his fault he was dead. It was his fault.
“It’s a painkiller.” Malfoy said, watching Harry, who had started to fidget, and was rolling his shoulders back as he nodded.
Draco considered protesting for a fleeting moment, feeling nettled, but he heard the bite of pragmatism in her voice and remembered that he had been acting like a lost child for days, and knew better than to argue. He nodded and allowed Luna to pull him up off the couch and towards the bathroom.
Draco felt enraged. Not at Hermione, but at the faceless entities who could pull strings so effectively from the ministry to exert control over him. “So, what? We just stop? I thought I was a Death Herder, doesn’t that have a list of responsibilities? Some power? Some
Harry passed the box to Draco, and watched the weight of it settle in his hands, he could imagine the magic curling around his fingers. Would he recognise it, or would it take time, like it had for Harry? “Sirius lived every moment he had. He didn’t let his freedom pass him by. He just never told me.”
“Okay.” Harry’s voice was muffled as he dropped his head back onto his knees and breathed a deep sigh.
Harry released him from the hug, leaning back to look at Ron, to regard him in his apron, long and gangly and red-haired. Ron, who had tried so hard to believe in him, to stand by him, but who struggled with demons of doubt and regret. Of inadequacy. Of guilt.
But now he was here, at the Manor. This cesspool of dark magic and even darker history. He was about to partake in ‘Christmas Cheer’ with his mother, and try not to think about how people were eaten on the dining room table. About the Christmas they spent with Greyback and Lestrange. He shuddered, struggling to repress the memory, and thought about how he could at least visit Snape’s second portrait, the one that was made just for his godson, and update him on the DoM.
The parchment was soft, the handwriting, so incredibly familiar. He felt as though he was opening a door inside himself, one to his past, but to a past he still loved dearly, a place before it had become tarnished.
But Sylvia in death is not nearly as painful as thinking of her in life. Her beautiful smile and the way she used to reach for Harry. The way her bangles accented every move she made. Every wild movement. She was like music. She was a symphony. Complex and moving but thrumming with something so very human. So close to home. Home .
Harry had collapsed to his knees. They had landed in a small meadow, covered in the shoots of green, just peeking out beneath their new growth in the tepid sun of the clearing, ready for spring, fighting their way through the frosted ground. Just ahead of them, across the clearing, was what looked like a cabin, yet the roof was covered in the same small green stems, blending the small hut into the rocky hillside that rose up behind it. To the west, there was a large mass of bramble bushes and an overgrown well before the clearing relented and ancient and gnarled trees held sway over their territory, dark and twisted, yet full of small signs of life.
She just nudged his hand as he rubbed the smooth space between her eyes.
Then, as soon as he had seen Harry walk through the door, he was filled with a kind of frantic rage at
They pushed passed and rushed into the mob of vying creatures. Draco heard a wet cracking sound from behind him, something like bone, and yells from the Aurors as Harry and Draco strode determinedly from the scene.
Draco couldn’t help but agree.
Harry pushed out a long suffering breath and scrubbed a hand through his truly wild looking hair that was threatening to come loose from it’s lopsided topknot. “I tried to make dinner.” He said, not meeting Draco’s eyes.
be excited, I’m supposed to be— I’ve worked so hard for this— to get here— but I’m honestly just—
“Correct.” He agreed, again.
“Sure—” Draco said. Trying not to feel horrified for the unicorns.
The embers in the grate glowed and in the distance a thestral cried out into the cold clear night.
“I’ll just grab the last of my things and be off then.” He muttered to himself, still unwilling to just leave.
“What?” He asked, looking dumbfounded, as if Draco was speaking French.
Harry shoved his hands in his jeans pockets and stomped his way down Shaftesbury avenue. He should have been cold, with just a sweater pushed up past his elbows and t-shirt underneath, but flames of jealousy licked and curled their way around inside his chest. He hated how angry he was, how hurt. He hated it as he hated himself, blindly. Consumingly. Why couldn’t he be happy for them? His two best friends in the whole world, his family, were expecting.
, wordlessly, I might add, deflecting a jelly legs jinx from Freya—”
“You’re right.” Draco started, carefully. “It is more complicated than that. But to say you’re wholly responsible for Sirius’ death, in an adult’s war, one you fought and won as a child, is taking a lot on.”
A look of understanding crossed the barman’s face, and he motioned for Harry to follow him back to the toilets. Harry had never seen him leave behind the bar before, and he followed him, eagerly, his magic crawling around, hungrily.
Potter looked suspicious and narrowed his eyes, clearly not knowing how to respond to that.
Si scirem quod sola esset,
.” Harry waved his hand nonsensically, seemingly scandalised by the idea of doing what the midwives did for a living, on a regular basis. “I thought being a Death Herder— being someone who stood on the threshold of death and walked between worlds was stressful—” Harry muttered.
He stood there in the biting cold, in too few layers, shivering against the icy wind that swept through the yard, wondering what the fuck to do.
“But, because this is such an unusual situation, I’m going to give you homework.” Her face was soft and those familiar hazel eyes didn’t flinch from his wary gaze. “Next time you see Voileami I want you to try and touch her. And, I want you to tell a friend that can also see thestrals about this, and ask them to confirm her presence. If you had said you were seeing people who weren’t alive, or literally any other hallucination I wouldn’t indulge in this, but because this is so out of the ordinary and with your work with the DoM and strong connections to thestrals, it's best we be sure. Do you think you can do that?”
“Good gods,
“Yes.” She said placatingly. “But, I think we need to get it off the record. They’re not interested in keeping the forest safe, or magic of the land balanced to prevent evil maelstroms from forming, they’re interested in the power behind your connection. How they could weaponize it. This is what’s happening all over the world. Magical governments using these connections to create conflict and fear. We can’t let that happen here. You two need the space and freedom to discover what this connection means without worrying about the ministry breathing down your necks. I’d never be able to live with myself if one day I wake up and you two have disappeared to some deep dark level of the DoM, never to be heard from again.”
“Yes, I imagine they’re all there and waiting for us already. No one will want to be late for our first official Grimmauld Place meeting.” Harry helped her over to the fireplace and threw in some powder.
Luna worked on gathering the bits and bobs for tea in silence as Draco sat stiffly, trying not to fidget. As Luna sat the tea tray down in front of Draco he looked up into her kind face and felt suddenly curious. “Luna, how did you know I was seeing a therapist?”
He had never felt more foolish, more lonely, or more guilty. Tears streaming down his face, he tried to drag more oxygen into his lungs but there didn’t seem to be any air left in the room. The familiar tingling in his limbs threatening to take his mind and awareness away from himself.
Sitting, hunched over his research, he heard Harry moving around the cottage tending to his sodding owl. Draco refused to look up or engage at all. He had been giving Harry a wide berth since the patronus incident because he couldn’t allow their closeness and obvious draw to one another come to anything. If he just kept his distance, resisted Harry’s easy presence, no matter how fucking good he looked or kind he was, even crooning over an injured owl, then Harry would eventually realize that there could never be anything between them and Draco would be able to breathe again.
“Can you see the thestral behind me?”
Draco stared at the bottle, shook it slightly, saw that what was supposed to be a thick liquid, was now the texture of sand, or ash.
Harry was silent a long time again. “I can’t tell you what to do. This is a matter with your power,  your ability, not mine. And— he’s your father. You’ve seen him at this best and his worst. You probably have a better measure of him than I do. You’ll know if there’s good in him. If he’s someone to save.”
That enigma of a man. Deeper and more intelligent than Draco had ever given him credit. Plagued with guilt and a heavy burden of expectation from everyone. Draco had never met anyone as broken and shattered as he was, someone who could see his dark parts and be seen in return. He felt truly safe in Harry’s presence, even with the looming cloud of his doubting past and his internal boggart. He felt in his pocket for the talisman Harry had gifted him and felt a swooping sensation where his stomach should have been, his thumb running over the rounded edges, ghosting across the etched spears. The gesture was profound to Draco. So few had ever recognised Draco’s need to control his personal space, and no one had ever done so much to support that.
Harry was grateful, gardening without magic was much harder than he remembered, and he definitely needed a real break, with some sugar, and he was oddly looking forward to Malfoy’s strange teas. Each morning was something new and different, odd flavors and sensations that Harry was entirely unfamiliar with. Each evening, however, was the same, something that made him warm and comfortable climbing in to the tiny mattress of the top bunk. He would have to ask him about it sometime.
He unfurled the letter as Harry set about making them tea.
The first thing Draco realised when he woke up was that he was alone in his bed. He felt instantly relieved, and maybe a hint disappointed. He felt like he’d been run over by a rampaging dragon and he curled deeper in to his duvet. He could hear shuffling in the kitchen and wondered when Harry had gotten up. Wondered if he had intentionally gotten up early to avoid another forest flight. The thought made him feel a little embarrassed and he shifted uncomfortably. The memory of the night before washing over him, making him feel stupid. He hated giving away his secrets, leaving him feeling vulnerable and useless. But, it had felt so… good? Yes. It had felt good having someone understand him. Having someone ground him, hold him.
Harry hummed in approval. He wrapped one arm around him to pull him closer and resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’m not lonely anymore.” Harry said, simply.
“Alright. Enough. It’s torture, you were right. You’re right about everything.” He knew he never should have mentioned that, shaking his head with a soft, albeit embarrassed, laugh. “Are you hungry? I’ve got more to show you.”
Harry does watch as the copious amounts of gold glitter finish writing out the words
“Because you’re beautiful, Draco,” Harry tells him, hoping that maybe this time he’ll believe it. “With all of you.”
Draco goes beet-red.
“I am?” he teases, raising a slender eyebrow, despite his racing heart. Under the covers, Harry throws one of his legs over Draco’s thighs.
“Potter?” A familiar voice asks, and Harry’s head snaps to focus on the other person on the balcony, who he can now make out clear as day.
“That sounds–” Harry doesn’t really know how it
“Would I..?” Oh
“Attractive, eh?” Harry laughs, and waves the wand in his hand lazily. Out of the tip, a stag blindly bright emerges and runs a loop around the two of them before coming to rest next to Draco, rubbing it’s nose carefully against his cheek.
“Unfortunately,” Draco sighed, pursing his lips. “How much do I owe you?”
“This job’ll be the end of you.” Draco huffed, smoothing his fingers across Harry’s chicken-scratch. The writing on it was faded, as though worn down over time, which was rather odd. Harry must’ve used one of his ballpoint pens. Draco always thought the quality of those were lacking compared to a good quill and pot of ink, but Harry tended to disagree. The words were barely legible, but Draco had lots of practice at reading Harry, it came to him as easily as breathing.
normal?” She cocks her head, somewhat like a puppy, staring off into the distance.
, and intelligent, and you may not always be kind but you are when it matters. And– and I get nervous when you’re around which is really inconvenient actually but nevermind that. I‘m, er, really obvious, apparently, if Hermione and Ron are anything to go by, so, I– yeah. I like you.”
“Falling apart over there, Potter?” Draco calls from the corner of the garden he spends a lot of his time tucked into, copper cauldron bubbling away steadily and floating just above the bench in front of him. It’s been an affectionate thing for god knows how long.
think of a warming charm?
“Huh. Guess I didn’t,” Harry says, realising it for the first time too. “It isn’t really much of a story. I found an acorn and decided to plant it for fun, see what happened.”
Draco
Malfoy.
When he got no answer back, Draco sighed, already knowing his fiancé was probably in a land of his own and completely none the wiser that anyone else was in the house. Harry’d picked up a Muggle gadget he called a
It’s not that he isn’t happy that Ron and Hermione are together, far from it, it was such a great relief when they
Harry’s brow furrows. “
“Get on with it then,” Harry replies, eyes sliding shut again. Draco huffs, watching the slight bob of his boyfriend’s Adam’s apple, then presses a light kiss to it. He feathers kisses along Harry’s jawline, one on his scar for luck, one on his nose for fun, and then pecks Harry’s waiting lips, pulled tight so as to stop himself from laughing.
, and so he always wrote short messages telling his customers to enjoy their treats and tell a friend, and if they were regulars their message was more playful. It was terribly endearing. Draco still had the note he received when he first ordered from his bakery pinned to a corkboard in his kitchen —
“Harry?” Draco prompts with a raised brow, bringing Harry back to the present.
. He’d frozen, after his rant, almost as if remembering who he was talking to;
Harry just shrugs. “They’re already holy. It doesn’t bother me.”
“I love you, my darling.” Draco kisses Harry once, twice, lingering on the third, then brushes their noses together. “More than words can say.”
The music of the party has gotten louder, and it’s then Harry notices that the rest of the talking crowd have spilled out into the back garden. George and Angelina are gathered around a group of fireworks, Bill and Fleur some distance away, Ginny and Luna are hovering next to one of the large trees, Neville and Hannah have their arms wrapped around each other, and Ron and Hermione have taken centre stage.
“Good morning to you too, love,” Draco replies, bending down to kiss Harry on the lips. Because he’s up close, Harry can see the way his face scrunches up, and, despite the fact that he’s doing it because of him, it’s insufferably adorable. “Your breath stinks.”
“Yeah,” Luna parrots. “It’s nice to have some abnormality in your life, I think.”
The Mark is a vivid red, stark against the pale skin of Draco’s forearm and stagnant where once it would coil and twist, smooth like a snake and just as poisonous. Still, Draco’s eyes are closed tightly until Harry drags his fingers across it, snapping open to focus on the mark, pointedly avoiding Harry’s gaze. The grip Harry has on his wrist tightens a fraction, not enough to hurt, but enough that pulling away would take effort. Harry’s hand drifts back up to cup Draco’s cheek, the soft ministrations of his thumb returning. Only then does Draco look at Harry. Confusion. Pain. Love. All reflected in a stormy grey.
The bottle in his hand is a quarter empty. Oh. Okay, that makes more sense.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No one’s ever asked. Too scared to upset me, I imagine. But you’re not.”
“What do I..?” Malfoy scoffs. “
“Potter, you are one hand twitch away from getting us done for public indecency,” Draco whispers breathily. A laugh escapes Harry before he can help it, and he pulls back and buries his face into the crook of Draco’s neck.
Oh, the
“That so?” Ron slurs, pecking her on the cheek. “Hiya, Harry.”
“Right,” Ron says slowly. Hermione is looking at him like he’s some sort of animal she’d love to study. Harry just wants to leave. “What about Malfoy?”
Harry hums and begins to sway them side-to-side. “Is that a yes?”
that you love silver foxes so much you’ve subtly been spiking my conditioner with grey hair dye.”
When he turns around, Draco’s staring down at the sketchbook, lips parted, deathly still and silent. Harry is very confused. It’s just a drawing of his little tree to be, nothing scandalous. And, not to blow his own trumpet, but his work isn’t that bad. Or maybe it’s the other way around? He can’t imagine Draco being so impressed that he’s speechless because of a sapling, though, it’s definitely not one of his greatest pieces, and he’s shown Draco a lot of his better drawings before.
“Appointment?” Harry asks, brows furrowed, rolling off Draco to let him sit up. “What for?”
Malfoy glances up from his book, then, as if sensing someone’s looking at him. Harry wonders if it’s something he’s developed during the war, being able to tell when you’re being watched, or the not-necessarily-irrational fear that you always are. Because he can, too. Helpful, when you’re on the run, or a psychotic megalomaniac’s living in your house, he supposes. Harry meets his eyes and offers him a tentative smile.
Nothing else is said, the two of them watching them watch each other. Harry dips his head, not taking his eyes off Draco, and presses a kiss right to the centre of the skull. Draco jerks, inhales sharply and holds it, but he doesn’t retract his arm. Harry does it again, further down. Then again on the mouth of the snake. And again and again and again, until Draco is trembling under his mouth and Harry’s being pulled into a heated kiss, forceful yet searching in it’s nature, a question of why, why,
Malfoy looks surprised, but then seems to school his expression into one of what looks like calm delight. Harry’s heart gives an overexcited jump.
“Nah, we haven’t participated in society for a while, so I fancy going out to actually see some people. Trees are always good, but I find oxygen-breathing beings hold better conversations than oaks.”
“Piss off.” Harry reaches out a hand to fumble about for his glasses, but Draco gets to them first, sliding them onto Harry’s face so his shit eating grin comes into focus. “Thanks,
“You’re a pest,” he mumbled, looking into her yellow eyes. Her tail swished happily as she painfully stomped a circle on his thighs, then settled down into a lump of brown and caramel fur. Draco scratched behind her ears and she started to purr happily, burrowing deeper into her little ball. Draco huffed. “Cute pest.”
Malfoy frowns down at his own watch. “I really should be going, I didn’t realise it was quite this late.”
he wants Draco in a way he hasn’t felt since kissing Ginny after winning the Quidditch cup in sixth year.
“Would you like to come back to mine for a drink?” Harry asks hopefully. “It’s not far from here and I have Ogden’s.”
Harry had said, and his heart fell out of his arse.
“Someone who unfortunately owns several peacocks and comes to parks in central London, that’s who, Potter,” says Malfoy.
“Honestly, I almost do sometimes,” he says. “I stick to Muggle places a lot because it’s not as if the wizarding photographers from the
Draco reaches out a hand, flicking his eyes up to Harry; a question. Harry nods, and Draco traces the length of the ink with a finger, mesmerised as the largest stars in the constellation glow silver like they would in the night sky, illuminating the entirety of the Draco constellation over Harry’s heart. The cool press of Draco’s wedding ring against his skin gives Harry butterflies as he rests his other hand on his cheek, while his right palm spreads out against the full size of the tattoo.
“Be nice,” Hermione chides lightly, nose already back in her book. She’s reading up on old wizarding laws surrounding magical creatures and their historical exploitation. Cheerful stuff neither Harry nor Ron has the brain power to keep up with, let alone harbour any interest in.
Harry hums contently as he draws, hot summer sun beating down on his head. His little acorn has grown into a little sapling. He doesn’t tend to describe his plants as adorable, but he might make an exception for this. It’s thin and knobbly in places, with three little leaves growing from the top of the stalk. Is it weird to see himself in a plant? Because the leaves remind him of his hair, before he knew how to tame it at all, and the stem, his awkward boyish body, too short to be lanky, but far too scrawny to be stout.
Harry’s seen them before, littered in the Ministry, harping on about ‘The Young Death Eater...’ and all the
, with a black streak of something down his face and his eyes red like he’s been rubbing them. “This new illegal potions ring is just…”
Malf–
like him like that. I’ve got to go.”
Malfoy snorts in amusement. “You’re utterly pathetic.” But when Harry just keeps staring at him, he sighs. “I won’t run away.”
“I never asked about that last bit,” Harry says quietly, mind reeling.
“Well, then,” Draco whispers against Harry’s mouth giddily, when they finally break apart for air. “Good morning, my love.”
It was later than he thought it was, but he didn’t have much of an appetite; he’d wait for Harry to come home to fix up something for the two of them, or better yet, Harry would bring something back with him.
Good enough. “We’re not together anymore,” Harry says, coming to lean on his side next to Malfoy.
Almost as if he can’t help it, Harry blurts, “Why were
“What does it look like I’m doing?” He squeezes his hand around Malfoy’s, who turns a delightful shade of pink. “And please, I’m just Harry.”
Malfoy huffs out a laugh, shaking his head, and mutters something under his breath that sounds a little like ‘
Draco hums his agreement.
For the two of them, it’s not about the money. They don’t need it, and they never have. They do it because it’s
Draco looks up at him, but not for long, as his eyes flutter shut when Harry dips his head to capture his lips, softly, lazily, loving, like he’s trying to encompass Saturday mornings into one kiss. Harry lowers himself down into a more comfortable position, and Draco immediately winds his arms around his waist. One of Harry’s hands comes up to Draco’s cheek, thumb stroking back and forth, and a small sigh escapes from Draco’s lips.
“For what?”
“Fine. Girl-Weasley.”
“It wasn’t too bad,” Draco blatantly lies as Harry begins to work his mouth along his jaw. “I just,
Harry looks at Malfoy, admiring the sharpness of his nose, his cutting cheekbones and jawline, his almost cat like eyes, turning silver in the right light, the soft pouting curl of his pink lips, standing out from the paleness of his face, and thinks,
“Still that bad?” Harry laughed, taking the parcel over to the real window at the front of the bakery, where Hedwig, his snowy white owl, had just arrived back from a delivery. Hedwig hooted happily at Harry, who smiled fondly and stroked the top of her head.
Draco ‘
“Yeah, but he isn’t
“Well,” he says, “I can’t say no to Ogden’s, can I?”
“I love you,” Harry says against Draco’s lips as grey-silver eyes stare at him fondly. “I know that charm work must’ve been a pain in the arse. And you hate doing stuff like that. So thank you.”
Harry does know Theo, and he grins mischievously at Draco. “We have time.”
“Potter! I’m a busy man!”
“I’m getting there,” Harry replies. The sun catches his glasses and he squints. In his chest, his heart is racing. “Your jumper looks nice.”
Draco snorts at him. “I’m not above spelling your glasses to the ceiling, you know.”
Draco laughed. “And why would you do that? I have the culinary skills of a mountain troll, Harry. I burn water.”
“Good evening everyone!” Hermione shouts over the noise, quieting down everyone’s conversations. “We hope you’ve all had a great night so far!”
“Ah, yeah.” Harry fumbles about in his pocket for a bit, then passes Theo the folded up piece of paper. Nerves are bubbling in his stomach. He’s pretty good with pain, after everything he’s been through, but the idea of getting something permanently etched into your skin is a little scary. Draco knows that better than he does, and Harry unconsciously squeezes his hand. Draco squeezes right back. “There you go.”
“Potter–”
Harry bit his lip, then shook his head. “Nothing. I’m feeling generous today.”
“Harry Potter–”
smiles. “You’re worried about him.”
“Oh,” Harry says breathily.
“Good idea,” he tells her, stumbling slightly. “Stay– say hi to Ginny for me.”
“I know,” Malfoy carried on conversationally. “How ill-informed. Umbridge’s existence itself was far worse than anything the Basilisk had ever done. She was the real monster, the cow. And besides, they weren’t even there six years ago. How would they know anything about it?”
“Know what?”
“Ha. Ha. And no, I don’t
“I won’t. And it’s Harry.”
invited?”
do you know Ron and Hermione? And don’t say Hogwarts.”
annoyed. “No offence, Harry, but you and Ron aren’t exactly the perfect people to discuss complex numerical charts with.”
“Hermione?” Harry lifts his head. “Thought you’d be more worried about Ron knowing.”
“Very vague of you,” Malfoy says lightly, crossing one leg over the other. “Talk about what?”
Harry pulls back to meet Draco eye to eye, their faces close, noses almost touching, and studies him for a moment. There are dark circles under those grey eyes, creases and lines where they shouldn’t be on an eighteen year olds face, and a distinct chip on his shoulder from fighting a war not of his own making. It’s raw, the look on Draco Malfoy’s face, one which Harry sees much like his own reflection in a mirror; flipped, two sides of the same coin.
Shaking himself from the sweetness of the memory, lest it pull him down into its warmth and prevent him from leaving the house, Draco wrapped the scarf soundly around his neck. Letting its weight settle around his shoulders soothingly. Pulling on his winter cloak, he took a moment to centre himself.
he thought. He dashed around people idling on the front porch and snaked his way into the house to find Luna. He found her in the kitchen carrying empty tea cups on a tray to the sink. She turned to the sound of his approaching footsteps and didn’t seem remotely surprised to see him standing in her kitchen.
Harry stopped himself in the middle of sawing away one of the lower branches of the tree in an effort to clean up a section of lower trunk and make space for presents beneath it. He wanted Draco to feel loved.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, rubbing Harry’s shoulder gently, feeling the tension that was gathering there.
“Of course.” Harry answered with a grin.
He stretched his neck from side to side, taking several deep breaths, forcing his shoulders down. He breathed in and out, focusing himself, fortifying himself against all of the thoughts that lay around the edges of his consciousness, layering them back behind his singular goal: get through today. Get through today.
Hermione nodded, biting her lip, her eyes, for the first time since she arrived, filling with tears.
He was not allowing himself to fantasize about Harry, no matter how insistently his subconscious tried to force the issue in his sleep. Ever since Harry had cast his patrons and gotten so deliciously close to him, Draco couldn’t stop wanking over it. Just remembering the feel of Harry’s hands on the hem of his shirt and their foreheads together made him forget to breath and sent a jolt of pleasure to his groin.
Once inside the cool shelter of the little cottage, he made a mental list of things he needed to accomplish. First, he needed to get out of his gross clothes. He was sweaty and covered in detritus from crawling on the ground trying to edge his way towards the unicorn herd. Then, he would make lunch, have a strong cup of tea, write to Hagrid about his frustrations, write down his feeble attempts with the unicorns for posterity, go work in the garden, then settle Harry in with his afternoon potions. Finally, after dinner he would pick up his knitting and try to soothe his ragged nerves with some soft yarn. He felt like his head was full to bursting with a million things to think about. He took a deep breath and reminded himself as he closed himself into the bathroom, that all he could do was take this moment by moment and not to panic about what lay ahead.
Draco’s eyes snapped to Neville’s feeling utterly lost in the proceedings. They couldn’t possibly know, could they?
Harry dropped his hands and walked back across the field of wildflowers to their front door, checking in on the little garden as he passed. An empty eggshell by the lettuce heads made him smile for the first time since he had left the rock pool - Draco had been leaving presents for the eggeater.
Harry pulled the bottle closer and into his lap.
Draco’s eyes had nearly popped out his head. “
Instead, he finally said, “Everything seems to be in order.''
She looked up into his eyes for a long moment, clearly choosing her words carefully. “I’ve had a theory for a while. After talking with others who had similar experiences. Luna, too, was worried in the beginning. She didn’t announce her pregnancy to anyone, not even Greg, until after 20 weeks. Penelope. Same story. Miscarriage after miscarriage— all boys— There are others as well, that I have found—”
He heard the familiar panting. Off to his left, a shadowy figure loping between the dense copse of Rowan trees. Harry walked on, his steps tracing a familiar path until he was emerging in his Rowan grove, quiet and still in the morning snow. Across from him, leaning against one of his favorite trees, was Sirius. He was young and jaunty and full of life, black hair long and effortless, smile crooked and genuine, broadening at the sight of Harry, running up his face and crinkling his eyes. Joy was painted all over him.
of his former teachers. The absoluteness of the impending embarrassment washed over him again, and he looked quickly around the room for something else to focus on, spinning the quill in his hand with unnecessary speed, avoiding the moment when he would have to apparate to the Hogwarts gates.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked nonplussed. “I’ve been avoiding it entirely for the last 2 months.”
And, get on with it, Ron did. It took him an hour to tell them the whole harrowing tale— how Hermione acted as a whistleblower in the department— how Kingsley and Percy motivated the Wizengamot to confront generations worth of deeply ingrained superstitions in the name of protecting their society, least of all their Golden Boy. In the name of accountability and transparency. Of free knowledge and open discourse. How they had one by one agreed to allow the aurors and the DMLE to investigate the department, for the legal offices to run an internal audit, for every employee of the DoM to be questioned and investigated.
Harry could not hear the thestrals screaming.
Despite Percy’s silencing charm, a low rumble of hissing from the spectator section had broken the heavy and ominous atmosphere that had settled on the courtroom when Lestrange had entered. Draco couldn’t help looking over, the familiar chant of Slytherin dissent tugging his heart strings. Seeing the entire assembly in the spectator section for the first time, he found himself momentarily stunned to see the small horde of Slytherins and, with the greatest shock of all, his mother, all hissing vociferously at Lestrange.

He had an idea— It was a
awkward. He stared at her with wide eyes, not knowing what to say, his mind reeling with regret about his life choices and the decision he made to come for tea.
He ran his fingers through his hair nervously, what if she couldn’t see the thestral?
“You’ll see.” was all he got in return.
Pansy sighed dramatically. “If you must know, one of these is sparkling
He shook his head, really not wanting to think too hard about those eyes or the fact that Kings and Queens were men and women, and this was something that would never, could never, happen in his world. He was a gay man, and these kinds of fairy tales weren’t for gay men. Groaning in frustration, he buried his head in his pillow and tried to will his erection away.
, and tried not to feel supremely stupid.
He whistled loudly and Little Dipper swooped in, as if waiting for the signal, from an outside tree. He was electric with excitement for a delivery. It had been ages since he’d had a job.
Draco was climbing the path to front gates, Voileami no longer in view. He was secretly hoping that he had been late enough to avoid seeing the Weasleys today. Not that he hadn’t grown incredibly fond of them, no, but that he was afraid of reminding them of who exactly he was. The role he played in their family’s heartbreak. He was afraid that Mrs. Weasley would look at him and decide he wasn’t good enough for her Harry. He felt the familiarity of his cowardice grip his insides.
“That’s what I said, yeah. I thought maybe I’d wake up the next morning with bruises and be cursed half to death, but the next morning I woke up and all me bruises and cuts were healed. The lump on me head was gone, and I felt right as rain. Never better, actually. Went back to check on the unicorns the next day and they were friendly as ever wit me.”
Harry eventually scrubbed his face, sighed and looked back over at him, smiling shyly. “Sorry, if that was weird. I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“No, sorry Gin, we have plans. Maybe another time.” He said flatly.
,” it hissed out, punctuating the statement with breathy emphasis in time with his irritated puffing.
“That’s more of what I was expecting.” Severus said smugly.
“Winston, tell everyone you’re to practice disarming again, you and Teddy are in charge. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”
He smiled to himself when Harry’s voice carried through the garden. “Draco?”
He grabbed a bit of parchment and a quill, dipping it only once in the inkpot by the bed stand.
She had recrossed her long and slender legs as she spoke, sitting back in a purple velveteen settee, feet clad in ancient chucks but legs bare to high waisted silken black shorts, belted with a black bow across her midriff. He had watched the graceful movement curiously, wondering if he had felt any attraction beneath the appreciation he had for her long and graceful form. Not attraction, he had mused, just wonder, maybe envy of her poise. She reminded him of someone.
“Yeah, we could have.” Hermione said simply. “But we didn’t. Sometimes we have to fight different battles, Harry. One person can’t—
Draco had just opened his mouth, trying to figure out how to respond when Luna chimed in, “Oh but haven’t you two noticed how few nargles Draco has since he’s been back? He definitely wasn’t alone that whole time.” She smiled serenely at Draco while his face morphed into one of beseeching horror. She wasn’t going to out him, was she?
Harry had never turned up to see Draco during working hours before. Never subjected himself to a waiting room full of patients, with rapturous and overly curious eyes, glancing hungrily between them.
“Dare I ask what’s in there?” Draco asked tentatively, moving a little closer to where Harry stood.
Draco felt dizzy. It was incomprehensible. He could not believe what he was reading. Clutched in his white knuckled hands was approval for his research proposal, paid leave for his sabbatical,
. He really was excited about this next year. Nervous, anxious, and full of second-guessing self doubt, but still excited.
They ended up on their bed as Harry was finishing the final lines of the article and flipped the page to follow the final sentence. He trailed off, his brow furrowed, the fingers that had been mindlessly carding Draco’s hair as he lay next to Harry had stilled.
He needn’t have worried however, for only after a few moments of enduring his internal boggart’s insistent insinuations that Draco should have stayed home, Granger was striding out of a door behind the receptionist and towards Draco.
. Of his declaration of family and of love. Of the golden lattice spellwork settling down in his very soul.
Snow was falling softly in the clearing. The sky was dark and muted with clouds, the stars and moon hidden from view. Panting breaths released clouds of steam into the otherwise silent forest, muffled and dampened with layers of snow.
That had not been a pleasant experience, but he took what was dished out to him. He felt that he deserved whatever he got. He did royally fuck up, after all. What was a few trips to Madam Pomfrey with black eyes and hex wounds if it made everyone else feel better?
the notion was. He was the most capable father Draco had ever met and had no doubts that he would have gladly lactated in Hermione’s place if given half a chance. How fitting the role would have been for him.
“You are not your Dark Mark” was written in, what he now realised was, a familiar hand. Harry narrowed his eyes.
Harry nearly choked at the last line to appear. He flipped further into the rather thick novel to find magical illustrations of reddened, painfully erect penises being fellated with vigour, men spread open as their lover licked slow and sadistically around the rim of their spread ass.
He also felt completely incapable of voicing this to Harry, of reaching out and asking for the gentle hum of his voice, his small touches, considerate and tentative. Of his acceptance, which never cost Draco anything. Unburdened. Unfettered to pain. But Draco had been mum, afraid of asking for the reassurance he
— I’m your employer!” He muttered threateningly as he stood from the chair and turned to Juniper. She didn’t flinch, instead, she handed him his cup of tea, mint with honey, as he liked in the afternoon, and then the file for the last appointment of the day.
“What was that?” Harry teased.
“Oh, darling!” She cried, a smile splitting her face. She threw an arm around Draco’s neck and kissed his cheek. She smelled like lilacs and cigar smoke. The lining of her coat tickled Draco’s nose as he breathed in the familiarity of her. It had been so long since they’d been close like this, and he hadn’t realized how much he had missed her in his life.
“Do you remember it this time last year?” His shoulder bumped against Draco, as if he too wanted to reach out and hold part of him, but didn’t know if he could, or should.
Draco sighed in relief, grateful. Work he could talk about.
Harry shook his head and sighed, looking over to Malfoy, who had been watching him again.
“Yeah…” Harry pushed out, awkwardly, yet looking relieved. “Sorry, I meant to mention it— I just— didn’t know if I was going to take it. But, then— then, I thought of Orelia and how she had cast her first
Harry swallowed with difficulty, his mouth having gone not quiet dry but oddly sticky. “Yeah, I’ll make sure to get it done, Ron’s been going over the plan and details with a few of the others – but we know the drill, sweep the house and dismantle curses, stun anyone we find, it’s nothing new.” Appear capable. Appear ready.
He made the decision that moment to get up out of bed and take a cold shower. Freezing. Unbearable. The kind of cold that took your breath and made you wonder if you’d ever be warm again. He turned on the water, removed his pants (ignoring the tempting slide of fabric against his still leaking cock) and stepped in before he could find a logical reason not to be so cruel to himself.
“I’m sure it is.” Draco did smile a little. “Let me know if you’re feeling motion sick and need to stop. Maybe you can even sleep a bit if I keep it still enough.”
Harry’s lungs burned with the effort, his feet flying across the well worn path, dashing across the gurgling stream, not even pausing to say his customary hello to Alice, who scuttled over to her burrow in alarm as he leaped across the riverbed, barely breaking stride, his feet scarcely touching the ground as he sprinted back up the path to the hollow, leaving half footprints in his wake.
He needed to find somewhere safe. He needed to hurry. He could hear footsteps following him, a deep laugh ringing out and echoing around the cold marble of the halls. Before he could turn another corner, he felt a solid mass slam into him, hot breath on the back of his neck as he was cornered in a niche in the wall, the moment of impact in slow motion, prolonged and emphatic in it’s goal - to make Draco feel powerless.
"Albus," McGonagall protested, "The boy is injured! He's been
“How long has it been like this?” she asked quietly.
Draco looked away, feeling the uncomfortable heat of shame coiling in his stomach.  "I'm so-"
He eyed the quill again, seeing that it was completely black all the way to the nub, but it’s edges were slightly red where the light hit it at an angle, as if the quill were really just a very dark shade of red instead of black.
“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. All of you, really."
be the case. Ever.
“Alright! Bye!” And they went off quickly to talk to another child about whatever it was eleven-year old’s discussed these days.
the letter started off with, and Harry smiled at the words he could practically hear coming out of Draco's mouth in that snobbish tone of his.
Bill chuckled, "No need to look like you've seen a Basilisk, Draco. I just needed to let you know you were due for a meeting after lunch. Dumbledore's just popped out, but when he's back with Snape we’ll start."
"Well, I'll see you three later then." Theo said quickly, rolling up his parchment and turning away with a sparse glance between all of them.
Malfoy still looked strange. His eyebrows were relaxed and the enchanted snow settled on his face, but he didn't seem to care.  He nodded, his gaze turning back to somewhere Harry couldn't point out.
Draco quickly placed the back of his hand on Harry's forehead, and the boy started.
" Harry snorted and resigned himself to a very shit evening courtesy of himself and Draco Malfoy as an accomplice. Harry didn't particularly feel bad about not going with Parvati. Not that she wasn't pretty, or whatever, but Harry had no idea how to talk to her outside of classes and homework. What on earth would he have talked about while they were dancing?
“Not for lack of trying.” Ron grumbled, eyeing the empty spot where Draco should have been sitting.
Two days before the Second Task, and Harry had forcibly kicked Ron and Hermione from the Library so they could focus on their own studies instead of helping in his futile search. He had given up hope of completing the task, and may have undignifiedly thrown the egg across his dorm at some point in time. He and Malfoy ignored each other outside of classes, and Harry tried to ignore the boy's concerned looks at odd times during meals when they'd caught each other's eyes. The Restricted Section's books proved no better in helping him, or maybe it was because he didn't have Hermione there with him. He didn't think the words even got in to his brain the more he read. He sat down to research that day and looked up from the same book hours later only to see it was time to leave. He didn't go to dinner. He had stopped going a few days ago.
“I dunno.” Harry said, “He said it could become something worse.”
"Are you an idiot?" Remus exclaimed, the initial shock. "That's illegal, you know!"
He smelt the scent of soft earth and heard a rustling of paper next to him.
The night after the meeting, he’d dreamt about parchment paper replacing his skin and tearing up into little pieces until he’d gasped awake. In class the next day, Pansy would complain about the weather and he’d swear she’d said the bloke’s name. At that moment, he was staring blankly at a roll of empty parchment, an unwritten essay that was due in
There were probably around twelve new Slytherin students joining them this year (Pansy had done the headcount, so hopefully she knew the actual amount), which wasn’t an uncommon amount for the House, predictably. Draco watched the child from the train waddle up to the front of the line excitedly, and it gazed up at Draco gleefully, eyes shining.
“You mean weirder than she already is?” Blaise asked beside him.
"Ah yes. Here amongst the dirt and overhanging threat of Lolligo the squid. Charming."
“Problem?” Malfoy asks.
, which begins to spell out a word as the glasses fly around the room.
With Cho, he just blurted it after she heavily hinted at him asking her out, predictable and expected. With Ginny, it was more of a mutual moment of passion, caught up in the excitement of winning the Quidditch cup and throwing themselves at each other, desperate for the little normality Harry still thought he could have. With Malfoy, though, he isn’t sure that he’d appreciate being kissed out of nowhere. That’s the thing; he just doesn’t know enough about Malfoy to know how he likes to be kissed. But he does know that he’d like nothing more than to find out.
“You do?” Harry realises his eyes are trained firmly on Malfoy’s lips.
“Rather like us, then,” Draco says, spinning them around.
“You know,” he says quietly, “you never told me the story of the oak.”
It’s both amazing and completely absurd, that their dynamic could change so drastically so quickly. Wonderful, that, Harry thinks. He wouldn’t have it any other way.
A quick glance at the clock showed he really ought to be getting back to the office if he didn’t want another bollocking from his boss for taking an ‘unauthorised extended lunch break’ or, in simpler terms, spending too much time pining over Harry Potter that he lost track of when his break finished.
“Even after all this time, this one still makes me feel giddy,” he says, turning to look fondly at his Draco. “You’re gorgeous and I can’t believe you’re mine.”
Draco pays for the appointment as Harry attaches himself to his side and tries to hide his red face on Draco's shoulder. They say goodbye to Theo and leave the shop, Draco wrapping an arm around Harry and planting a kiss on the top of his head before they apparate home.
“And miss the first party in your new house?” Harry smiles and pulls out an old bottle of Ogden’s he found in a cupboard back at Grimmauld — once he dusted it off it was completely fine, and screw what Walburga Black’s portrait said of it, the nasty hag. He doesn’t really know anything about the fancy wines that Hermione likes to drink, and Harry knows Ron likes a good firewhiskey as much as he does himself, so at least someone will drink it.
That barb would sting if Harry had read it in the paper or if anyone else had said it, but oddly enough he focuses on the cautiously humorous tone in Malfoy’s voice over the harshness of his words, and laughs at the man who only a few years ago would have insulted him with all of his being and meant it wholeheartedly. Malfoy smiles slightly and ducks his head.
“Oh shut your mouth,” Harry says, swatting at Draco’s hand. The fox is dislodged from Harry’s chest as he sits up, and Draco dismisses both patronuses with one movement of his wand. As much as he teases, Harry adores Draco’s patronus. He’d cast it for the first time during their first dance as husbands, so happy and emotional, the incantation spilled over his lips like he couldn’t help it. A enchanting, glowing fox had spilled out of the wand, and as far as Harry was aware, the world had stopped and no one existed but the two of them. Casting his own patronus, he twirled Draco around as the fox and stag chased each other in a circle, lost in grey eyes that shone like molten mercury.
Harry loves his life so much he wouldn’t give it up for the world. Not this time.
“No. No, that’s ridiculous.” As soon as the words leave his mouth, his stomach jumps. It came out a little too loud, and so a few of the surrounding Gryffindors are looking at him like he has two heads. Maybe they just think the Chosen One’s finally lost it. They might not be far off. He swallows hard around the knot that’s formed in his throat. “So because I actually see him as a human and not just his mistakes that means I
“Classy, Potter,” he mumbled affectionately, prodding the white-turned-tan pair of running shoes with the tip of his finger.
“You,” Harry starts, gently poking Draco in the chest, “should not be this beautiful, first thing in the morning.”
Draco’s eyes darted to the clock. Five minutes. “Alright, you madman. But I don’t know if my boss will be happy with ‘The Boy Who Lived To Make Me Late’ excuse.”
And this time, he understands every word.
Harry rubs a hand over his face and steps into the Granger-Weasley house. “Classic ex-death eater activity, you know what they’re like. Nothing more than senile old men stuck in the past and speaking like it.”
“Doing what, Ron?” Hermione asks, in that tone she always uses when Ron interrupts her lunchtime reading.
Is he really that obvious about liking Malfoy? Sure, maybe he stares at him a little more openly than he did before, but how is that Harry’s fault when Malfoy insists on looking so– so
An audible
Looking down at his legs, Harry can barely see where Malfoy repaired them. “Thank you,” he says genuinely, then, “I didn’t know about your hand. I’m sorry.”
does he sound like a moron.
Theo laughs and picks up a mirror, angling it towards Harry’s chest. “I do this a lot. The position fine?”
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “
’ and it’s all Harry needs.
. Maybe it hadn’t done so well, he mused, because of Slug and Jiggers just up the street, a trusted supplier for years. What drew him to it, Harry couldn’t say, but shortly after he found himself a good few thousand galleons lighter, key in his hand, and a project in his pocket.
Harry begins to think that maybe Luna’s fresh air advice wasn’t all too innocent.
Harry turns up fashionably late to Ron and Hermione’s New Year’s Eve party.
“I’m just–” Draco dips his head, his face flushing. “I’m glad that you’re it, for me,” he mumbles, just loud enough for Harry to hear him, just loud enough for Harry to feel that familiar warmth in his chest he gets when Draco says things like that. He looks up, meeting Harry’s eye as he says, “I’m glad that you’re still here. In one piece.”
“Harry!” Hermione shouts over the music as she opens the door, kissing him on the cheek and wrapping him in a tight hug. “I wasn’t sure if you were coming or not, Ron said that you were called out.”
“In your dreams,
“Thank you,” Malfoy mumbles, avoiding Harry’s eye.
Draco hums, continuing to card his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Quite alright.”
When he meets Harry’s eye again, there’s the sparkle of tears threatening to spill over.

“Hello, you,” he said in a babying voice, leaning down to let Cookie sniff him. Harry had begun singing along off-key to the radio, butchering something about someone called Andante, while dancing half-heartedly and writing his notes. When Draco seemed to be more focused on Harry than her, Cookie meowed impatiently and butted her head against his hand. “
“Now, though, it’s the moment you’ve been waiting for,” Ron says dramatically. Harry snorts; he’s definitely been taking notes from George. “It’s only a minute until midnight, so find yourself a partner and get ready!”
“Stop acting like a 12 year old and give me my glasses.”

“Mine or hers?”
Malfoy had to try, and he’d grudgingly agreed to but ended up loving it. Malfoy was complaining about how he’d hated living at home; his father was distant, lost in his own head most of the time, a side effect of his stay in Azkaban after the War, and when he was present he was icier and harsher than ever before; his mother was a mess of emotions, doing her best to take care of Lucius, and clinging to Draco overwhelmingly; he’d desperately wanted out, wanted his own space away from them, not just a
Malfoy furrows his brow. “You’re not?”
Harry, to wake up to every morning. He runs his finger over Harry’s scar, tracing the shape of the lightning bolt, before swooping down and lining a still-healing cut on his cheek, then down to a spot irritating Harry’s chin, up his other cheek, circling both eyes, and finally drawing a line down his nose.
Harry shrugged. “I like having you around. And s’not like you don’t spend most of your time here anyways when you aren’t working.” Plopping himself down in the chair opposite Draco, Harry set both drinks and a plate with muffins on it down onto the table, his bare arms flexing. “Banana and choc chip, new recipe,” he clarified with a smile. It was something Draco had suggested a while back. His stomach did a flip.
Plump, pink lips curl into a smile. Harry’s head lolls towards Draco, and his eyes flutter open, vibrant emeralds shining behind his hooded lids.
him?”
For starters, there needs to be a hole. In the case of Harry’s little tree-to-be, that’s dug in the back garden of Grimmauld Place, with enough space cleared out that the tree will have room to grow and flourish in the way that he didn’t.
“But–” Draco starts, opening his eyes.
“Yes.” Harry lifts his head. “
“Well you
Looking back, he shouldn’t have been that worried about using Draco’s literal given name that all of his friends call him. Draco had barely noticed, and took it as a sign that it really was okay. And so from then on he was Draco. They drank more wine. Ate more food. Joked around that Harry had far too much space in his house, Draco should just move in with him.
out there.” Clearly she’s already a bit tipsy, as she’s even more affectionate than normal, patting him on the cheek as she grabs his arm. “So, work?”
“If you’re going to kiss me like that,” Malfoy says, smiling against his lips and his eyes fluttering open, “the least you could do is call me Draco.”
Draco fiddled with his cup. “You’re Potter when you annoy me,” he grumbled.
. Ron joins them occasionally when he isn’t spending time with Hermione, but even then it’s just not the same. He misses it, sometimes, the way they used to be, though he’ll never tell them that.
“Oh! Yes, right.” Harry cleared his throat and Draco noticed that his cheeks had gone a little red. “So, er, you probably already know this, but the Ministry is holding a charity ball on Saturday, to raise money for pre-Hogwarts education programmes for muggle-borns. I bought two tickets a while back and, well, you know me, forgot about it immediately until I saw the
Green eyes stare at him for a moment, then in one quick movement, Harry pushes himself up and Draco down, so that he’s hovering on top of him, thighs braced either side of Draco’s own, and hands on the pillow beside Draco’s head.
“That’s your
Trying to hide the tattoo from Draco for the next week while it heals is
“Yeah.” Harry edges his hand closer to Malfoy’s, so that the tips of their fingers are touching. Malfoy takes in a short breath.
“Malfoy–” Harry starts, but he’s cut off with the touch of Malfoy’s lips on his own; gentle, pressing, testing the waters. His eyes close into the movement as his glasses bump awkwardly against Malfoy’s nose, but neither of them seem to mind. The hand not holding his comes up to cup Harry’s cheek, caressing in the most tender motion he’s ever felt. Emotions rise up in him, and it’s silly, but he almost wants to cry. Kisses never felt this overwhelming with Cho or Ginny, never like the world had been thrown off its axis, his head didn’t spin and his cheeks didn’t flush with joy like they were now. Tilting Harry’s head up with his finger, Malfoy deepens the kiss, and Harry can’t help but let out a small gasp.
Inside, he’s met with the sight of a flustered Draco, his hair mussed from him running his hand through it, Harry guesses, though it’s no wonder, because a quick glance at the clock shows that it’s almost an hour after Draco’s shift was meant to finish.
It’s cheesy. Incredibly cheesy, he knows. Draco has mocked him about a hundred times for it. But Harry can’t find it in himself to care, because it’s so perfect. And, hey, Draco let him name it. If
Ever since, he’s been working on perfecting all of the curves and points of Draco’s body, loose and peaceful with sleep. He’ll never get it just right, of course, it’s hard to emulate something so beautiful after all, but he’d been hoping that one day he could show Draco what he looks like to him through his art. Handsome and stunning and graceful and fascinating all rolled into one. Earlier on, he was working on it and must’ve forgotten to put it away again, but that still doesn’t explain why Draco looks as if he’s witnessed a murder.
“Thanks, Luna. Appreciate it,” he slurs. God, when the hell did he drink
The flush has migrated up to Harry’s face and he imagines he resembles something similar to a tomato. “That’s– well. I mean, I’m not sure I do like her anymore. Not like that, anyways.” Recently he’s had doubts about whether Ginny even still likes him. With a glance down the table, he becomes even less certain. The trio have their heads near each other’s, sharing small smiles and giggles and words. Not sure at all.
“Never told you how good it was,” he mumbles, clearer this time.
“Draco’s always been good at Potions, it was just that his ego tended to overshadow his intelligence,” Hermione says matter-of-factly. She looks up at Harry with a pointed brow. “He’s a big boy. I’m sure he can handle a hex.”
. That was the first time he’d ever entertained the thought of having a crush on Harry Potter. Something he thought would pass quite quickly, considering he hated ‘

so effortlessly. Because if Harry knows anything, it’s that Draco Malfoy is gorgeous. He’s known it for years, but just been too stubborn to admit it until now, when nothing’s holding him back.
“That’s just not fair,” Harry says, dropping his fork. “Smith is an arsehole, everyone knows that. Even the other Hufflepuffs don’t like him. And Malfoy– well, he’s different now, changed. And if I can forgive him then I think they can too.”
“Mhmmhnmhn,” says Draco.
“Right as rain,” he replies, wandering over with a smile on his lips to perch on the edge of Draco’s workbench. “I have a devilishly handsome potioneer husband to put me back together again, so I’d say all is well.”
Later that day, when the rain is beating heavily against the old roof of stifling Grimmauld, Harry decides to go on a walk. Maybe it isn’t the best idea he’s ever had, but Andromeda, Hermione, and even Ron, now and again, badger him about the fact that he never leaves the house much these days. The rain is kind of soothing to him anyways, and afterall, he
“Yeah,” says Malfoy. “You too, Potter.”
“Cookie likes anyone who gives her attention,” Draco said haughtily, spinning his hot chocolate around.
arsehole,” Harry laughs, a happy sound that Draco can feel the vibration of from where their chests are pressed together.
Draco snorts. “I’ll remember that for next time.”
Christ, Harry’s lonely.
it about, then?”
He looks over at Malfoy, who’s watching him carefully with narrowed grey eyes. Malfoy’s hair ruffles in the light breeze which makes him look soft despite his glare. “Nothing bad,” Harry says playcatingly. “Just– you seem like the type of person who’d wear cashmere.”
“You said it was
For once, Harry had a plan. He'd thought of it himself and everything.
The last slivers of sunlight were disappearing beneath the stands of the Pitch, reminding Draco of where he was meant to be and urging him to continue down the halls. He made his way with purpose until he came to a stop in front of an ugly, stone Gargoyle statue.
“What if I'm not?”
And Draco knew he had maybe said too much. He thought he should keep some of the stuff Potter told him a secret. For some reason, they felt extremely fragile and important. He decided not to tell Blaise about the piece of the Dark Lord's soul in the diary.
Cho was Cedric’s girlfriend. She can’t seriously like Harry after that, can she? Even if she did, it would be weird if he even initiated anything. Things between them felt weird, anway…
" Harry pleaded, unable to maintain the silence, "He's not bad. He's mean, and a dick, and he tormented me for years but he's not the same anymore, and he's not his father. He wants different things than being a Death Eater and killing muggles, and I
was the worst thing in front of his eyes at that moment.
All the teachers stared at him pityingly, as if he was
"Ah, yes. Malfoy, that's right." Remus gave Sirius a side-eye glance, "Who would have thought? A Malfoy defecting…"
"I…" Harry started, then looked around. The twins and Ginny her busy talking, but he glanced at Hermione and signaled to the door for them to leave. Hermione understood immediately, her eyebrows shooting up and getting out of her chair. When Ron begun to protest in confusion as they filed out, she pinched him on the arm and he let out a yelp.
"I will." Another lick of flame wove itself around them. Harry felt the sensation under his hands becoming more and more prominent.
In a sharp turn of events, Harry’s third day of detention went without a hitch. Apart from his curt “Good evening” and “Good night.”, no words were exchanged between him and Umbridge. The woman stayed uncharacteristically silent, even when he tilted back on his chair and rocked it forwards with a loud thump a few times throughout the evening. If Harry didn’t know better, he would have assumed it was both of them being punished, just being in that room together.
"That's not what I mean." Draco waved a hand flippantly. "Think about it. Has Dumbledore ever asked you what
Snape came by early in the morning while Draco was still in the Hospital bed, swishing in and assessing Draco critically, almost as if looking for injury.
"That's what the sun
"Harry, it's me, Draco. You need to get up, you're going with Arthur to the Ministry." Draco tried to say as softly as possible, mindful of the snoring Ronald behind them. Merlin knew how Harry got any sleep at all with how the ginger practically
Her eyes were flooded with something Harry had never seen directed at him before. For the first time ever, he was the feared and not the fearful.
Draco, luckily, didn’t seem to notice his abrupt silence. That, or didn’t interpret it as because of the pain from his scar.
He looked at the boy sheepishly, "I have to ask…uh, do you know anything about…that?"
Cue a laugh that felt more like a cackle, and Draco almost tilted his head in confusion, feeling as if Umbridge was now speaking to him with subtext that he couldn’t recognise.
“I know! It’s just…” Lancaster exhaled, at a loss for words for a moment.
Draco scoffed rudely, waving him off, “She’s just your regular bitch, not the Death Eater kind. The woman loves rules, she’d never go against the Ministry.”
"If you'd have read them, Draco, you'd understand." Harry said gravely, "If you'd been locked up in that room like I had been, you'd understand!" He took a step forwards, hand clenched at his sides and the light from the window behind him outlining his silhouette in silver against the dark room. Draco could barely see his face, but he knew if he could've he wouldn't have been as confident in being anyone in the same room as the other boy. "I sit in dirt the whole day, waiting for something! Listening to the television for any information at all because he's fucking back and I don't know what the fuck is happening!"
"Hush, Harry. Wait until I'm done." Hermione said, "It rather started when you asked Malfoy to the Ball. When school started up again after, you started disappearing during dinners, or Ron would wake up and you wouldn't be in your bed. You'd manage to slip away when we were otherwise occupied - don't think I didn't notice."
He walked in to the Great Hall with eyes cast on his shoes, and blocked out the hushed whispers as he passed the tables. He felt a hand come around him when he reached the Gryffindor table, feeling bushy hair tickling his neck and relaxing when he realised it was Hermione.
Within a second, a sharp white object appeared in the corner of his eye and his hand immediately shot out to catch it.
"For once, Dumbledore is correct." His father confirmed, and Draco released a secret relieved breath. "The Dark Lord has returned to us."
There was a slight, imperticible shift in Harry’s demeanor, where for the briefest second he became tense all over. It was only momentary, however, and Harry just shrugged in reply. “Just detention stuff. Writing lines.”
Blaise shrugged, eyes glazed over in thought about something and staring in to space, "Feels like everything. If only you hadn't been such a dick all these years, Potter may have become friends with you sooner."
Well, then. That kind of stung.
“But you’re the head,” Draco argued. “What would the difference be?”
"Because of the
"Draco, you really should try bowing to him. I swear he's frien-" Harry said, coming in and immediately stopping. The boy's face immediately flushed red. "Uh…"
Ron scrunched up his nose as leaned in to Harry, "Some bloke from Slytherin called Theodore."
Bill's eyebrows raised, leaning forwards to sit properly in his seat and turn to Draco completely. "I…" He stopped and looked around, causing Draco to as well. Around the table, the Weasley's were chatting boisterously. Ronald was sat arguing with the twins about something as they jeered at him, Granger silently watching at his side with a warm smile. Ginevra had taken Draco's now unoccupied seat, talking to Harry about something that required a lot of hand gestures and visuals. From the looks of it, Draco guessed it was Quidditch. Sirius was busy speaking to the pink haired woman who was changing the shape of her nose earlier and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were bickering amongst themselves. In the corner of his eye, Draco could see Moody sat silently, the only movement the swirling of his Mad Eye.
Draco wrung his hands together in his lap. "I understand. But I do still think it's a good idea to have something that's magically binding. Not for the sake of trust but the sake of safety."
"Yeah!" Harry said indignantly, then shrunk away when he saw Hermione's lips tighten. "It was binding. I could tell."
"What?" He heard Draco ask.
"Merlin, Pansy
"-or he's feeding everyone different information, and seeing what gets to the Ministry." Draco said, realisation dawning on him. "But if that's true-"
Just as he was finishing mixing in the eggs (after precariously breaking them and only dropping shells in twice), Sirius came bounding down the stairs in to the room.
“I said
Irritation spiked in Harry's chest, "I know, alright? Lay off! I get enough of this shit from Hermione."
Draco opened his mouth for a moment but no words came out. “I- She said to escort you-”
Blaise stayed silent, and Draco did too after that. They both sat pensively as Draco gathered himself.
"Because I would have told them anyway. And I want them to be involved,
"Morning."
"Sorry, Draco." Remus laughed. "Can't get anything past that one."
"You misunderstand, you foolish boy." Snape reprimanded, "I know nothing of the events of this night-"
He believed he had safely escaped by the time he got to the door, before hearing the heavy thuds of Uncle Vernon approaching from upstairs.
McGonagall summoned the letter from Harry’s hand, sitting back in her desk chair while Draco and Harry took the seats across from her. She deftly opened it and began to read. Draco took the time to look around the office, noting it was comfortable and covered in fabric surfaces of any kind. He wondered if she had a cat or some other pet, as much of the fabrics seemed to be scratched up.
-o-o-
"You could have just asked her instead of being all jealous. One would think there was at least one cell up in that thick head of yo- Ow!" Harry made sure to step on the same foot he did earlier. "Shut up, Malfoy." He wanted to say, but it just came out as a whisper as he kept his eyes glued on Ron and Hermione. Hermione's eyes narrowed as she looked from Ron to Harry and Malfoy,
Lancaster nodded. “Even as Head of the Archival Organisation, I’m still not cleared for Level Two access, even if I’m cleared for everything else entirely.”
"Wh-?" Harry started, but was silenced by Molly placing steaming plates of food in front of the both of them. He turned to glare at Draco, but the effect was dampened by his still crooked glasses and mussed hair that stuck in all directions that shouldn't have been possible.
“As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a
“Ah, I think I remember now.” he snapped his fingers as if the thought finally caught up with him, smiling as if she really were a friend of his.
He couldn't afford to be attacked. Not even that, he wasn't in the position to make the decision to do anything but submit, anyway.
, Draco. It's Karkaroff I'd really be worried about." Harry said, remembering the man gripping his left arm and talking in harsh hushed whispers to Snape during a Potions lesson.
A shrill scream filled the air from the room next door. "
"Boys?" An accusing voice sounded from the door, and Draco turned guiltily to see Molly with her hands on her hips.
if we're pissed off at the same time in this room."
“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” Umbridge said neutrally.
"I don't know why I couldn't be involved. To some extent, I could have
The other portraits on the stairwell begin to scream as well, and Harry clapped his hands over his ears as Draco screwed his eyes at the noise in confusion. The woman seemed to be staring at him specifically, and after all the breath had seemingly been screamed out, did she begin to form coherent words.
“And you...want to be in Slytherin?” Draco asked before he could stop himself. He didn’t know what could have possessed a child raised outside of Slytherin heritage to particularly
Harry’s eyes widened incredulously. “You
"Ron's right, Harry. It was very cunning." Hermione said thoughtfully after a while.
There was also the news about the Ministry break-in, which had looked insignificant at first before he’d received a letter from Hermione detailing how Sturgis Podmore, the man caught breaking in, was the same man who had missed escort duty for Harry the day the Hogwarts Express had departed from King’s Cross.
Draco strode to the Dungeons with his usual Malfoy regality, all the while is heart was hammering in his chest. The weight of what he had just done was starting to painfully sink in.
He had another lesson the next day too. He really hoped it wasn't dueling again. His father did say something about theory, if he remembered correctly. He hadn't really been in the headspace to listen properly at the time, having been suspended upside down from a spell he'd never heard before.
Finally, he looked up at Blaise, "I have priorities to my family, I'm sure you know that…"
“Wh - Is it your scar?” Ron asked worriedly.
Why did the fact resonate somewhere deep down with Draco?
"Right." She said gently. "We can discuss your school year over tea this evening. The parlor at seven?"
Ron took a swig from his bottle, “Go see Malfoy tomorrow or something, alright?”
"Then keep you eyes there, you blithering idiot." His father snarled.
" 'S why Snape's here too." Fred said with a scowl.
"What was that?" Draco said sharply.
Quickly, everyone shot out of their chairs, but when Draco decided to do so, his bad left knee decided to flare up with a jolt of pain and he collapsed back in to his chair with a hiss.
“Enough, Draco.” Harry held a hand up to stop him, putting his glasses on with the other. “I’m sorry, but I’m not processing all of this right now. Merlin knows how you do it.”
(TW: more of the blood quill stuff + reactions to anxiety such as vomiting/paranoia:
“Harry- Look.” Dean held out his hands calmly, trying to placate the tension between the two. “Seamus’s Mum doesn’t know you like we do, she’s bound to-”
"Tomorrow's the task."
"Because I don't want my father to become a Death Eater again, Blaise! I don't want him to become one of them again! I like the way my life is
“Has the Ministry tried anything as of late?” he asked curiously. “She must be here for something, after all.”
Both Harry and Ron groaned at that, but Draco's eyes just widened as he sat up. "Merlin, I didn't even think of that!"
"She's just trying to help-" Ron started.
"Don't start, Potter." Draco admonished, the continued, "I suddenly saw something I didn't have, and it made eleven year old Draco terribly confused and angsty."
"I said shut up, Blaise."
Hermione only glared, seething and rubbing her face exasperatedly. "What was he
." Harry immediately swore, and Draco nodded in agreement. The boy was stroking the book on his chest thoughtfully, staring blankly at the sky.
"Was?" Harry laughed.
Remus sighed. "It's the magic itself, and the fact that you're minors. For obvious reasons, magic-users under the age of seventeen can't undertake magical bonds, even if performed by someone else. It's stated by law, although there's no Trace set for if such a thing were to happen to a minor, for whatever reason. The law is says this most probably because you kids are still growing, and not only that, but your magic is still developing."
“T-Thank you, ma’am.”
an idiot for a while now. What’s going on with you? All you do is get angry nowadays. It’s one thing to be it with your friends and classmates, but a teacher? Really?”
Ron rubbed the back of his neck, looking flushed, “Thanks, Hermione.” He threw a meaningful glance at Harry which Harry returned with a mouthed,
"Why, Draco?" Snape hissed. "Why the theatrics? This is childish! You should know better as a Malfoy-"
"Oi. Shall I call Pomfrey?" Draco said threateningly. Harry glared at him and Draco continued, "Because you need to take one more round of potions. Don't think I don't know you have a sore throat. And let's not forget Pomfrey will have my
Harry readjusted his position then took a deep breath. He looked at Draco, "Remember Sirius Black?" He asked as if he were asking about the weather.
"Thank you." He said, "I hate this tournament." He laughed mirthlessly, shoulders shaking over his drawn up knees. He felt a pat on his back - Hermione again, probably. He inched away just a bit, playing it off as picking up his bag from the ground.
It wasn't much at all, and it was terribly obscure, but he didn't want to include anything that might allude it was him or that it was meant for Draco lest Lucius somehow got his hands on it. He decided to use that bloody squid's pet name because it was something they both understood (be it that thing really existed). It wasn't ideal, but it was something.
lesson. Even the Slytherins were pissed off at the toady pink bitch. She’d then had the audacity not to actually teach at all, but make everyone read from that useless textbook and make notes.
"And why in Snape's office? Do you think he might have been stealing Potion ingredients?"
"Draco, darling." His mother's hand briefly clasped his shoulder in greeting then fell away quickly. He gave her a polite nod and smiled like he always did when he got off the train after the school year, only this time it felt tight and forced.
"Have you started researching?"
He’d only met her briefly on the train, but the girl seemed much more mellowed out than the previous year. She was barely even surrounded by the gaggle of other girls that had been hounding her the year before. He supposed that Cedric’s death was also taking a toll on her in her own way. Especially since they were dating before...Harry swallowed heavily.
"Not enough that I care to admit." Ron said, smiling to himself and chuckling. "But I believe all of it anyway." He patted Harry on the shoulder. "It's good you have someone else besides us."
"ARGH!" A voice squealed that could have only been Ronald's. "STOP THAT!"
father that night." He added sincerely. Harry almost blanked out. Since when was Malfoy so…
Harry sat up straighter, "Wait, you can see me?" He had thought he was well hidden from anyone if they were to look in to the courtyard. Shit, had anybody seen him and he didn't know?
"You will become my Secret-Keeper," Draco said, "And in turn I will swear an Unbreakable Vow. To you."
Aunt Petunia returned, rushing to Dudley's side to nurse him with coaxes of chocolate in to his mouth. His face regained some colour back as she cooed over him. It was enough to make Harry's stomach churn.
"Right." He said in his no-nonsense, business-only tone, "This thesis is the only one of the author in the entire library. The tosser mostly went on about the cases of the ingested Gillyweed, and the rest is just speculation about it's possibilities for…underwater survival. In fact, all of it is speculation." He looks up at Harry intensely, "If you're willing to take the risk, then we can try it."
"Anytime." Harry smiled, "Were you here the whole day?"
Suddenly, the applause died down and Draco heard faint murmuring around the room, coming back to himself. He cleared his throat at Potter, whom he didn't know how still had the strength to hold his weight for so long. The boy jolted in to himself as well, his smile disappearing and causing something in Draco's chest to twinge. Potter coughed and brought Draco up quickly, stepping away and bowing with a hand on his chest. Draco did the same, suddenly feeling very cold. He wanted to say something but didn't know what, still recovering from whatever the hell had just happened. Potter saved him the trouble however, "Uh, see you around." He coughed again. Draco only nodded and they looked at each other for another moment before turning away at opposite sides.
“This isn’t good,” he said simply. Harry opened his eyes, looking at Draco’s side profile as the boy tapped on his lips with one finger like he always did.
while on school grounds, Draco. Now I'll trust you smart enough to keep your mouth
Harry nodded as well, remembering that night and the sick pallor of green that surrounded the Mark, casting shadows over Ron and Hermione.
“Yes?” He asked, trying his best not to be rude again but obviously failing.
Ron snorted. "Tyke." He repeated under his breath.
"Oh. They still…gave you the money?"
"Potter. Weasley. Another zero. Abysmal." Snape sneered when he walked by their cauldron. Harry barely heard, his pulse seeming way too loud for it to be heard as blood rushing in his ears.
"I mean…" Harry trailed off hesitantly, rubbing the back of his neck. "How long were you in there for?"
. I don't get it. What happened to the usual Malfoy?"
Tears prickled behind Harry’s eyelids but he just shut them tighter to prevent them from spilling.
Draco's mouth fell open. "No way." He laughed sarcastically. "That woman's insufferable!"
Draco nodded, finally understanding how big of a decision he was making by becoming allies with Potter. The last thing he needed was his housemates thinking they were defecting or something like that. If it got back to his father…Draco shuddered at the thought. And with what Pansy was implying, he most
“Uh, he does- um. I think he sort of supervises, like, filing? Sorting out the stuff? He manages all that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco got up along with them, hearing the scraping of chairs behind them as Sirius and Remus also got up to see Harry off. He followed Harry out the kitchen, hearing before he left the room from Tonks, "Oh, Arthur, by the way…" The man halted to listen to her, but the two continued on.
"Oh for Merlin's sake. Follow me." He grabbed Harry's arm and led him not a long walk away to the school entrance, which had been kept open for the Ball. Malfoy took him to a nearby bush just outside and stood next to it.
"I am well aware, Mr. Malfoy. On both accounts." Draco looked up in surprise. Was the old man senile? "I am a fair man. I know where my enemies lie, and there are none present right now." Draco glanced momentarily at Snape, the man looking back at him. "I understand you have made sacrifices for Harry, and any friend of Harry is a friend of mine."
"Shit." Harry whispered, "We don't have much time, then." And let the words sink in for a moment. Suddenly something occurred to Harry, "Oh!" He gasped, causing Malfoy to jump up and scowl at Harry. "My bloody scar!" Harry said, slapping his forehead.
"She's tried many times to pass bills that segregate muggleborns." Bill added. "She represents a lot of the conservative percentage."
"Arse." She muttered.
“Harry? What’s going-”
He stopped by the Great Hall, which was somehow already full of food despite there being only one teacher and Draco. He grabbed a few croissants and an apple and left again, cradling them in a napkin precariously and begging himself not to drop them.
"Uh…"
"Turned out well enough, though." He heard Ron say.
In short, the Organisation department was the only other access point into the lower levels of the archives apart from being an Unspeakable or the bloody Head of the DMLE or something. It explained why old Lancaster got compensated so handsomely and probably why Blaise’s mum married him, the poor soul.
"Right." Harry said slowly, studying Draco. "Are you alright?"
“I’m afraid I can’t accept such a poor standard of work. Not for your punishment and especially not on your last day.”
Not just any voice. Harry Potter's voice. Was he finally losing it? Hearing the Chosen One's voice by a Lake infested with one too many giant squids? He knew he shouldn't gone in to that one room in the Manor when he was six years old. Nothing happened then, but maybe it was locked for a reason. Maybe he was cursed…
"You look disgustingly pleased with yourself." Malfoy remarked after a moment, glancing sidelong at Harry. Harry couldn't help the crooked smile that crossed his face.
long, extended holiday soon. I wouldn’t get attached-”
"It's fine." Harry felt his face heating up and he looked away to the window where the highlands blurred past.
.” Ron barked warningly, spelling the boy into a shocked silence. “Harry,” He said, his tone more gentle. “Put your wand down.” He walked closer to Harry, reaching out slowly and putting down his wand arm. Harry let him, his throat feeling blocked and the room in front of him blurry. There were droplets on his glasses that made him realise he was crying.
“Come in.” Umbridge’s sickly voice called from behind the door. Harry pushed it open slowly and walked in, immediately hit, full force, with an image of pink and nothing else. He squinted, pausing at the doorway as he took in the sight of her desk area decked out in even
“So you admit that the other things have been specifically Potter things.” Blaise smirked devilishly.
The man was dressed in large, blue shabby robes. His cane was propped up on the table next to where he was sat, and his Mad Eye whirled around lazily in his thick goggles.
"What are you-"
The boy's death grip didn't let up but he turned back to his work with a deeply sought out sigh.
that." Malfoy's hands dug in to the dirt behind him, his gaze still far away but his eyes now troubled.  "I let my father guide me how he wanted me to live my whole life. Don't you think I know people don't think like the old Pureblood's do anymore? It's a different world to when our parents grew up. I tolerated his beliefs about blood purity and muggleborns my whole life, even letting it control how I made friends and acted towards people, regardless of their characters. And now you tell me he almost killed a couple of
“How on earth do you find where everything is, if I may ask?” Draco interrupted, settling back into his seat. “It’s just all so much. I think I'd get a headache.”
in his mind and felt the spell cancel out.
. Granger right behind him had bloody tears in her eyes.
…is coming back."
“Didn’t he have detention with her this week?” Blaise asked.
“But this was a momentary thing.” Draco raised an eyebrow. “A passing feeling. Professor, I’m afraid that you’ve got to give me more than that.”
most of the summer. Cleaning, Merlin. The twins are always off doing something or the other and Ginny always gets out of doing work
. It wasn't his
"Oi! Come back here!"
Ronald hovered in front of the biggest hoop, flailing clumsily to catch a quaffle. He seemed to still be getting the hang of the proper form for moving around on a broom efficiently. Around six times out of ten he would actually manage to prevent the charmed quaffles from scoring, but he also didn’t let that discourage him as he charmed them to fly again and would start from the beginning. Draco admired his tenacity, which one would come to expect from a boy from a family full of Gryffindors.
, then any future of it is out of the question. I need Umbridge off my arse, so…” He looked down, eyes glazing for a moment before they snapped back to Harry with resolution, “So we’re going to focus on Umbridge first. Whatever happens with my father can happen, but we’re going to find a way to have both sides of the coin.”
, and well, Bill's been giving her a few…"
"Clothes are there." Draco pointed to the end of the bed, where a set of freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt sat at the foot of his bed. "See you downstairs." Then left the room.
"Those two…I'll never understand." Potter muttered, look forward with a strange look on his face. Draco stayed silent, feeling like he witnessed something he shouldn't have. Frankly, he never thought the three had problems, and even more that Potter was just the middleman.
"Ow! Bloody hell!"
He paused for a moment once he stood outside Umbridge’s door, fist poised before it, ready to knock. Despite thinking through everything possible throughout the day, still nothing came to him that could help Draco. He sighed once, steeling himself against his own irritation, and finally knocked twice.
"D…Draco!" burst out Fred, howling with laughter.. "W…Why a...are you running…away like that?" He rested a hand on George who was bent over and near wheezing.
help. Me and you lot, too, and you don't even have to lift a finger."
" Ron echoed him with great pain. The only thing keeping Ron going was Harry's hand around his arm dragging him to the Gryffindor Tower. Harry relied on muscle memory alone to get him back to his dorms, and only once they neared the portrait of the Fat Lady did he finally realise something was missing.
"What happened?" Harry asked, concerned.
Draco then led the way with Harry next to him all the way to McGonagall’s office. Once outside the doors, Draco held back but was met with Harry’s confused face.
"I mean I used a cutting charm on his hair. Merlin knows he looked dreadful if I hadn't." He scoffed.
“Maybe you really are a nutcase.” Seamus spat. “You’re clearly unstable-”
“This is a
Harry stretched with a groan, throwing himself to lay on the ground now that he knew it wouldn’t get his clothes dirty because of the barrier. He was even pleased to find the surface slightly warm, and he sighed contentedly, settling on his back comfortably with his arms crossed behind his head. Draco seemed to still be deep in his thoughts, so he left him to simmer in them without interruption.
He smiled slyly at Malfoy, "Oh yeah?"
Draco looked down at his hands, his right gripping his wand and the left open to reveal cracked lines and calluses from dueling in his palm. "So you can't cast with your left?" he asked, looking up.
but you can’t say Naomi?”
"I see." Severus said flatly. "I understood this might happen. You aren't in any immediate danger, so I wouldn't normally entertain such futile requests."
"Let's get going." Harry said quickly, starting up the stairs.
." Harry said with a short laugh, "Merlin, no. I just want you to not be at each other's necks in the very least."
"Technically you won't see-" Ron started, but was silenced by a steely glare from Draco.
pretend the text with these ' '  things (apostrophes?) are italicised. ao3 hates me.
." Blaise exclaimed. "Honestly, you're both hormonal."
"What's got you so chirpy this morning, Theo." Blaise prompted. Theo just shrugged, but looked excited Blaise had asked anyway.
“Sorry.” was all he could say, biting back a grin. Luckily, he was saved by the ding of the elevator once again as the doors opened.
She was a small, old woman, he first noticed, as he could only really only see her large updo until they both walked a little closer and more of her figure was revealed. Next to her desk on the floor was what looked like a large hatch in the floor, but it was closed, so he couldn’t be sure.
“Have done so since i was-”
Fucking Triwizard Tournament.
“I believe that’s all, Profes...” He straightened out, eyes flicking to the Phoenix where he just managed to catch it burst into a ball of flames and instantaneously crumble into nothing but ashes on the bottom of its perch.  He felt his mouth fall open in awe at the sight. Where the Phoenix once was, alive yet dreadfully old, it was gone and nothing but a pile of grey. “...sor.”
Draco moved his eyes up from his nails, quirking an eyebrow in the process. Dumbledore had crossed his feet at the ankles during the time he hadn't been looking. Interesting.
"You…" Harry's face screwed up in confusion. "You were never here with me…Was always alone…"
Harry grunted in acknowledgement and prayed to any possible God that Malfoy kept his damn mouth shut. Just for a few minutes. Just for once.
“You may go. Good evening!” Umbridge sweeped up the quill and the parchment, leaving Harry breathing haggardly and confused.
Harry frowned for a moment, unable to remember any bloke called something obnoxious like Lolligo in Slytherin.
"I know. I'll be living with Hermione in the library from now on." Harry said, picking up a piece of pastry and putting it in to his mouth.
"She, ma'am?"
The sound in the room pulled taut like a vacuum, leaving only the rushing of blood in his ears and a distant ringing he suspected was coming from inside his head.
That was it. Harry felt that slight throb of shame at the feeling of being completely useless. Draco was working himself to the bone, deceiving his father everyday and Harry was…what? He slept a lot. He ate sometimes, as much as his relatives permitted. He tried to pick up a textbook and revise at some point, but who was he kidding? Ron would have laughed his arse off if he saw it.
Ron got up with a sigh. “Now get to bed. Classes tomorrow.”
"Used to what?" He heard Draco call out to him. Harry threw a smile over his shoulder as he walked away.
, and I'll be damned if anyone sets my father to rights before me. It's my name now, not his, and I'll save it if it means ridding myself of his legacy."
"Oh, right. The House Elf that lives here." sighed Ron. "Nutter. Never met one like him."
in Second Year, for Merlin knows what reason other than them being muggleborns? I'm afraid to admit that I agreed with it back then, maybe even liked it, but now I'm older and I realise that it was fucked up, and they had
"You're always worried," Harry snorted, but stopped when he saw Draco's serious glare.
He didn't know what happened to him, but for a moment it became achingly easy to pretend he wasn't in the Triwizard Tournament, or wasn't at the Ball with questionable company, or that his best friends were fighting and he had no idea what to do about it.
"Christ, a few months?" Harry said incredulously.
"I- do not misunderstand, boy. I am not one of his." Snape said quickly.
When he was awake, it wasn't much better.  What bothered him the most was he didn't get a clock. He had to sit and stare at the cracked little watch on his bedside table the whole day and hope it wouldn't stop working. He barely left his room, and his body was conditioned by now to only have to use the bathroom a few times a day.
." Draco added. "You'd be Filch's next worst nightmare!"
“Right, well, you needn’t really worry if you’re so adamant in getting in. The Hat is concerningly accurate and from what I’ve seen you
Harry sat back with a huff, “Wish we knew what those files were.”
Harry copied the spell, catching up the duplicate of the letter out of the air before it could settle on the desk. He shoved it at Draco, “
"Tell me what." Malfoy snapped.
Harry snorted and settled down next to him in to his usual Lake-gazing position. "It was brilliant." He scrunched up his nose slightly, "But I'm never putting that stuff in my mouth again. It was
, per se.” Harry reasoned, trying to sound convincing, “I just have to get her very invested in me somehow.”
-o-o-
It was him, and god, he looked like shit.
"I thought I told you to get a haircut, Potter." He said indignantly.
Harry glanced at Hedwig and the pile of treats she was currently attacking, and shook his head ruefully at her. She seemed to be masterfully profiting off of the two of them, but since she
“Brilliant.”
Draco said nothing for a moment, trying to come off as nonchalant. "We sent a few letters over the summer."
your best to keep quiet around that one. She's especially volatile and Merlin knows what she'll be like when she sees you. That's a good dear"
"Bloody hell, I know, Hermione!" Harry shouted before he could stop himself, cutting her off and immediately regretting it but unable to control his irritation. It was all the same bloody things she'd been telling him at breakfast the day before when he'd stormed out. It was taking every bit of restraint not to do the same right then. A few people around them look at the three, and Harry withered a bit.
Just as he was about to turn back, one of the compartment doors slid open and he was yanked roughly by the collar inside.  His wand was in his hand in an instant, but he immediately laid eyes on Draco pulling the Cloak over his head with his hands raised and empty.
Potter just sighed deeply, bowing his head in between his knees, "No. Not at all." He grumbled. Draco considered it for a moment.
Draco blanched. That wasn't what he had expected. Why would Harry be talking about an escaped convict all of a sudden?
Harry sighed, “No. It’s just me who can’t keep up, I guess.” He was tired, and he could almost feel a headache coming on from all the information he was being given. He had no idea how Draco was doing it. He’d be better off pairing off with Hermione instead of Harry for things like this. Maybe having it written down was a good idea. “You’re brilliant, you know that?”
When classes had ended that day, Harry spent some time in the Common Room with Ron and Hermione promptly trying to ignore their questioning looks and thoroughly avoid their questions in general. Unfortunately, it was Hermione who cornered him first.
Harry nodded, looking away from Draco.
He tapped his teaspoon a tad bit too harshly on the rim of the cup, then set it down.
is?" Draco gestured to Snape.
things. Especially to do with you. Just keep up with the good ideas like the Gillyweed one and we'll be winning this tournament in piss time." Harry crossed his arms over his head and laid on them lazily.
Usually, arriving at the Great Hall was a moment of joy and relief for Harry, but right now it was suffocating, and he felt the urge to just run up to his dorm and spend the rest of the school year there. All around him, since he’d gotten off the train, students had been sending him various looks of disdain and cruel curiosity. It seemed that all those articles about him in the Prophet were finally catching up with him.
Pansy crossed her arms and Blaise touched the back of his neck sheepishly.
"P…p…p…" Ron stammered, staring incredulously at the letter. "They made
“Good. How was detention?”
Grimacing, he shifted uncomfortably. He used to be able to hide in that very spot just fine when he was younger. Sure, he was growing up, but he couldn't be
"Ignore
"Regardless!" Draco bellowed, interrupting what Blaise was going to say. He climbed out of his blankets and stood on his bed, silk pajamas blazing in all his Malfoy glory and his hands outstretched around him.
. "You know, I still think you're bluffing about that bloody squid."
"But considering I entered a truce with the Golden Boy himself, that may make things interesting."
"What else." Draco coaxed, his voice soft in hopes it wouldn't set Harry off.
Harry cracked an eye open, meeting Draco’s stand-offish stare, “What do you mean?”
“And I needn’t remind you why you mustn't lose control around a woman like her, am I correct?”
It wasn’t an absurd idea, Harry thought. The Ministry was still investigating Cedric’s death, so some of them may have taken into account what Harry and Dumbledore had pledged was the cause. Minister Fudge might have been keeping it very quiet, but Harry doubted the man even entertained such thoughts or even knew about Umbridge’s probing into Lucius Malfoy.
His right hand unfortunately now started to tremble from the trauma it was sustaining, making the lines he wrote messy and scrambled.
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge dismissively to the girl in response to her question.
"Yeah, I know." Harry said, "But I managed not to beat his bloody face in and held back for once. We were alone, you see, so I held back otherwise we'd have killed each other."
right then.
"Potter's own words." Snape simply said, then continued. He spoke to Draco about the duel between Harry and Voldemort, how the path of their spells met and Priori Incantatem occurred. Draco had only read about it before, being extremely rare, extremely lucky. Harry had been extremely lucky.
"That was because I realised my father was a bloody-"
“Shit,” Ron swore again, opening up the little pouch and bringing out a gauze. “I...does this need to be disinfected? I don’t know any spells, dammit-”
"You mean that? You truly believe he's back?"
"Did you apologize to Parvati like I asked you to?" Harry asked wearily. He had asked Ron just moments before the Ball to do it for him as he never had the time. Harry felt shame creeping over him for basically standing the girl up.
Umbridge stumbled out of her chair, twisting to go and stand behind it as if shielding herself from Harry. “You couldn’t kill him! He doesn’t exist! Neither of you could have-”
"Boys." She muttered. "Where is Draco, by the way?"
Harry averted his eyes from the close proximity between the two, but Draco saw the imperceptible shake of his head.
Ron set him down and walked to where he’d dropped his broom. Beside it was a small bag which was a standard for all Quidditch players - full of basic broom maintenance supplies and, what Harry presumed Ron was digging around, for now, a small first-aid kit.
that's enough venting I think. I've been sitting on this shit for 2 weeks, though. cut me some slack.
Draco, of course, hadn’t mentioned his plan to procure the documents from Blane Witherby. In fact, he had barely mentioned Witherby at all.
"Wait-" Harry drained his cup in one gulp and set it down resolutely on the table. "About yesterday…"
"What do you want with my squid?"
He could have been a good Slytherin, if he wasn't such an idiot all the time.
, you dolt. The machine!"
“But...why?” He said again, his mouth filter completely broken for the day, apparently.
“Yes, Mr. -?”
The two frowned at their Mum as she turned away, before they looked at each other with mischievous grins. At once, they both pocketed the Doxies they'd had in their hands.
"You came with Snape, I presume?" Granger looked back at Draco, and he nodded.
At the bottom of the parchment, there was no signature or sender address. Instead, it seemed Umbridge had made little notes scribbled in their place.
don't have time." He looked Draco straight in the eyes, hoping it would convey his words better than he could, "I have faith in your theory, alright? You're not dumb. In fact, sometimes you're almost as smart as Hermione - when you're not being a prat, that is. That's why I'm going to take the Gillyweed tomorrow. Understood?
Draco drew back with a sharp inhale, “No? Why on earth not?”
? The Trace would surely pick that up…The Ministry was going to have a bloody
Umbridge looked up with an expression as if she couldn’t believe he was still in the room, “Yes?”
" He heard the pleas, now so loud and clear he almost thought his mother was in the room with him. His chest ached at her words. They'd never been that audible, and it pained him to have to hear his mother's last moments spent on pleading for his life.
see you next week! (hopefully lmao)
“Here.” Ron was back. He took the arm that had been over Harry’s arm and gently turned it to look at the side where it was still bleeding slightly.
Pansy turned her head to give him a curious once-over, letting the quill drop to the floor with a small clatter. “Well, Trelawney seems to believe Potty is on the ‘path to the most painful, untimely death’, so no matter what he pulls up she never grades him much.”
“Mhm?”
like death itself.
"Just a precaution. Sirius-"
“Have you had any strange dreams lately?” Pansy asked suddenly, the question immediately making Draco’s heart clammer in his chest.
“I’d say doing it without them knowing constitutes stealing in itself, don’t you think?”
gave me that clip from the top of her very own head! I wouldn't expect
" Harry said irritably.
"I..Oh."
"How long was I…" Harry started, but was interrupted by another yawn.
Harry answered with a scowl, begrudgingly dragging himself up to stand. Draco patted him on the shoulder apologetically, then they set off under the light coming from Draco’s wand.
Quickly, the children scrambled away and oh, how he missed being mean.
Harry scrambled out of bed, leaping up and putting on his glasses.
“Cedric was killed that night.” Harry nodded, prompting the skittish woman calmly.
Ron looked between them and sputtered at Hermione, "I agree with him! You look…er…nice." He said weakly, and Harry winced. The speed at which Hermione's eyes flash in anger at him was something Harry wouldn't ever forget.
“From what I understand,” Draco began swiftly, halting the man. “And this is, of course, what my father has told me, is that anything from Level Two and beneath is...how would I say it….restricted personnel only?”
Remus smiled. "Me and your Godfather are always here. For you too, Draco. Ron, Hermione, watch over them."
." Mrs. Weasley warned behind him as he fanned the pan, and he nodded through the fits of coughs and blurry eyes.
Draco took a step back cautiously. "You shouldn't really be here alone with me, then." He said condescendingly. "Don't you know what I am?"
"So, Dumbledore's acting as some sort of control tower of information?" Hermione asked. "To what end?"
the woman was. He shivered at the thought of having to be around her more than necessary, but at least he’d managed to make a good impression. Umbridge already seemed to trust him to some extent, but what was that minor subtext about the Ministry? Did she expect him to know something?
Draco dropped the object he'd been holding, letting it clatter down to the floor. He'd broken out in to a sweat, and the perpetual cold of the house incited goosebumps along his skin.
"Everything." Draco promised. "I swear on the Vow."
“You two can play together! Oh, you were a rather good Keeper at the Burrow with the twins, weren’t you, Ron?”
"Don't be jealous, Pansy. It doesn't look good on a woman." Draco said mock-seriously, and just managed to dodge the elbow she threw his way. "So violent! What will your husband say?" He laughed.
a voice said in his head.
To Draco surprise, Harry chuckled lowly, "I'm much less than pleased."
. Ron tells Hermione everything he thinks is wrong with me, and Hermione never bloody realises how much pressure she projects on to people out of habit. Everyday it's 'did you solve the clue' this and 'you need to get ahead on your homework' that. They're both my best friends, but they're so
“Oh, that does remind me-” Draco snapped, his tone suddenly sharp. Within the next second, Harry felt a sharp pain on his ear as Draco pulled at it as if he were still a child.
"Too many people." The voice replied.
"He was well bloody informed about it." Draco shot back, "Why is it you two think you have any control over this? "
It took a moment before Harry realised the gaze digging into the top of his head from Umbridge. He quickly looked up to see her once again scrutinising stare and was at a loss for words. Should he ask her what the bloody problem was or let her stare the entire night? He didn’t know which would be more repulsive.
, Harry thought, but stopped himself immediately and filed the train of thought somewhere else in his mind.
Looking around, however, he was met with a multitude of shocked, horrified and displeased faces. There were the odd few, though, that looked almost
" Moody started, but stopped midway, his magical eye disappearing behind his head. The man paused, as if listening.
"No, Draco!" Harry swiped an arm through the air in refusal, his voice thankfully lower than before. "Don't tell me about what's bloody fair! If things were fair, it wouldn't have taken a Dementor attack to get me to this house! I wouldn't have had to go to the bloody Ministry to get my wand snapped and expelled from Hogwarts!"
"You should be in bed." Sirius said flatly, looking stunned at Draco.
“Harry, that is the stupidest-”
"I'm sorry for not telling you guys."
Draco frowned. “Isn’t that a bit of a reach? She seems to enjoy enforcement of the rules quite a bit.”
“Y - Yeah.” Ron winced.
, Draco. It's not my fault you have zero sense of self-introspection."
Harry grimaced, “When the hell did you come to that conclusion? Where did this come from?” As far as he was aware, they’d just been having a conversation that was vastly different to the one now. He’d barely had the time to absorb the implications of Umbridge going after Draco’s father, and now there the other boy was proposing an entirely new implication to do Harry’s head in even more.
"It doesn't sound like something Cedric would do, to be quite honest. He's a Hufflepuff, you know. I would have been more on guard if it was someone from another house-"
"What's the batter for?" He asked shakily, peering at the ingredients she'd piled on the counter.
Harry once again swore at himself, chastising every fake moment of happiness her ever felt.
Draco's smile grew wider, and Harry slightly blanched at that.
sure?"
"That's it."
“Erm, right.” Blaise said slowly, noticing the change in Draco's mood. “But you’re prefect, yeah? You and Pansy can make sure that doesn’t happen.”
“S-Shut up, Blaise!” Draco sputtered at the boy.
"These floorboards are dead giveaways." Draco explained, folding a stray piece of clothing and setting it into his trunk. "And you're generally lighter on your feet than the others."
Remus checked his watch, chuckling. "Right, enough about me and Sirius. Snape's set to arrive soon. All your things packed up?"
, Pansy." He said, horrified. Blaise chuckled next to him and he elbowed him in the side.
Umbridge’s eyes narrowed for a moment. “Right. Miss...Granger. What might be the problem? I find that the aims are fairly straight-forward-”
“Erm, yes, ma’am.”
“Ergh, I hate you guys.” Draco slumped defeatedly into his seat, picking at his breakfast limply. “Praying on my downfall.”
His father smirked, satisfied. He came to stand next to Draco and gestured for both hands to be held out. "See how when I was over there, you would have had to turn your entire body to face me if you used your right hand. Every second counts in a duel, and much of it would be wasted moving around to accommodate things like this." He gestured to Draco's left arm, still holding his wand out. He felt stupid with both arms out like that, but was too focused on what his father was saying to care. "Theoretically, it would take less amount of time to transfer your wand between hands than to turn your body's direction. With your Seeker's reflexes, I expect that would be the case." He gestured permission for Draco to drop his arms, which had steadily been beginning to ache.
"Technically, I won." Harry had his back turned to them, and his voice conveyed no emotion Draco could pick up on. "But I didn't want it. Neither did the Diggory's."
"I almost swore one when I was a kid." Ron finally spoke, eyes spaced out and looking at the ground. "George and Fred thought it'd be funny to make me, but luckily Dad found us before we could do it. I'd never seen him so angry."
Finally, they reached. Draco noted that, while not outrageously long, it still took a considerably longer time to reach the sixth floor than whenever he’d rode the elevator before in the past. Then again, those were the times when he’d only gone as far as the fourth floor with his father, but it still made him wonder what the Ministry held in its deeper levels.
"Wrong pile.
been traumatised! Where do I even bloody start? I'll be hanged if any one of his followers finds out I'm not one of them! Bully for me that I sleep in a dorm with all of their children for nine months of the year! There is much more to unwrap than to wrap up, Headmaster!"
Before he knew it, he was rushing into Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Eyes finding the first sink closest to him (and pointedly not looking at the one that led to the Chamber of Secrets), he threw his bag down, ripping off his outer robes, and ran to it, hands immediately going to grip the porcelain sides in order to steady himself.
, Malfoy."
"He's
"Er - right. My apologies, Mrs. Lancaster."
"I said we would talk, remember?"
"I did his hair." He said, still foggy from waking up. Blaise perked up at the words, raising his eyebrows enough that brought Draco's mind up to speed.
"So what do you propose we do now?" Hermione broke the silence, tone grave.
Remus chuckled, getting up to stand and patting Draco on the back. "The first was Harry's mother, actually. Post-Sirius escaping Azkaban, however, no, actually."
"Because you have no reason to be?" And Harry tried not flinch at the words. "I'm actually glad you've let it some of it out, to be quite honest. You've looked on the verge of murder and total collapse for the last few weeks. Did you know you bottle up all your emotions?"
“Students must raise their hands if they wish to speak in my class-”
“I’m sorry?” Umbridge looked off-kilter. No more was the fake, pasty smile on her face. Now her eyes were wide and there was a crease between her eyebrows as they drew in together. For some reason, Harry now had some semblance of control between the two of them.
"Oh. Alright then." He saw the boy flush and cross his arms over himself, and Harry could tell he caught him off guard. "I won't."
Harry threw himself in one of the vacant armchairs around the fire, tension coiled and feeling hyperaware of his hair for the first time in his life.
, Blaise. Why would he keep me in the dark? For what gain? I had to admit, I was happy the Chamber had been opened. I thought it might get the muggleborns and such to leave, but I didn't know what was
Harry smiled just a bit, "I know. It was a lot. Well, Sirius came to get his revenge on Pettigrew for selling out my parents and framing him, and they confronted each other at the end of last year." He paused as if in deep thought for a moment then shook himself slightly, "Things didn't work out, and Pettigrew escaped. Because of that, we couldn't clear Sirius's name. He even got captured by some Dementor's but escaped in time. He's been on the run since." He finished with a wry smile Draco didn't understand.
“Toss off.” Blaise muttered, deflating into his chair. “Not everyone's dad can be a Malfoy.”
"Yeah." He said, giving her a light smile. He wasn't going anywhere.
"Erm," Harry paused, and Draco was about to retract his questions when he said, "Yeah, okay." He took the plate, replacing his empty one with Draco's. "Thanks."
"Potter not with you?"
"Draco." His mother said, sounding slightly urgent. He looked back at her. Her face was still the same as when he'd left nine months ago, lightly lined with age, but Draco still thought she was beautiful. Her blond hair was much darker than his or his father's, but her skin was still as pale as his, and unmarked just the same. With a sharp feeling in his chest, he noticed the slightly more tired gaze in her eyes, and the few grey hairs on her head that had been neatly tucked away before apparition. "Your father is waiting to speak with you inside."
can do, most of all. Just let Dumbledore work it out on his own for now, alright?" Draco knew he was telling Harry to do the opposite of what Dumbledore said , but he couldn't get past the fact that it shouldn't be on Harry's shoulders at all. "And I've been thinking of what you said a few months ago-"
“Ignoring me now?” Draco asked incredulously. “You’re unbelievable, Harry.” Harry felt the air shift behind him as Draco probably reclined to lie down as well. “All you do is get angry nowadays, you know?” He continued after a moment, albeit a bit softer. “You weren’t even like this during the Tournament.”
"What's wrong?" Malfoy said, sounding cautious and looking at him as if he may well break. Harry only laughed, although he didn't know why.
"Yeah. Why did you assume I was looking at Cedric?" He said hotly. Draco stopped himself from smiling, liking where this conversation was heading.
"Potter! Come here quickly!"
"Oh, bollocks." Ron swore. "Fred and George always did say Fifth Year was a drag."
, Blaise." Draco snapped, sitting up and seeing that the rest of their dorm was empty. "And what time is it?"
"Fine. Just don't kill each other, and don't shout. For Hermione's sake."
"Moody?" Draco asked, leaning forward. Harry didn't notice the sudden urgency in his tone, and his eyes were still covered by his arm to see Draco's frown.
The two boys turned to each other, and Malfoy must have noticed Harry's complete uselessness in that moment, because as they bowed to each other just before the dance commenced, he muttered low and threateningly, "
