Soon enough people bustled through the door and Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione went upstairs to Draco's room. Draco sat at the edge of his bed, and Harry sat next to him.
Slytherin. He should've been able to defend himself. But now he had to spend over night at the hospital wing because of a 16 year old boy. He fought Voldemort three times for crying out loud. He didn't know what had happened. Why he'd frozen up like that.
"You know what to do." She said and she walked over to her desk. Harry sat by the window and took out parchment.
Draco was becoming almost completely bedridden. He was getting sick, and couldn't keep down more than two meals a day.  He was deteriorating in front of Harry's eyes.
"Potter, wait."
"She has blackmail over her." Harry muttered to Draco. "What's she done to you?"
"You've changed Draco for the better. I never thought it'd be possible to bring out the kindness and caring in him. After four and half years and he's no longer putting others down because of his insecurity. He's trying to heal now. Not just himself. But you too. ." Hermione told him.
"Yeah, the bloke tried to hit me with a couple jinxes but I just used the defence spells you taught us. Then I jinxed him and he dropped his wand so I just punched him in the face. Then I ended up knocking him out cold." Ron said proudly.
Cramped, Hermione struggled to pull out her wand. When she finally managed, she returned Draco back to his original state. Blonde Hair and Slytherin Robes.
"I have to talk to Harry alone now. Please." She added, her tone quieter.
Now that Dumbledore wasn't at Hogwarts, the new Head was Umbridge, according to Educational Decree number Twenty-Eight.
"I think you're making it worse for yourself." Draco told him. "You should accept that this is a thing that's happening. There's no going around it and there's no avoiding it. So you just have to push through it."
Harry sat at his favourite place by the lake. Now that he no longer had detention with Umbridge, he wasn't researching the Devil's Curse, and he didn't have Quidditch practice, he actually had free time again.
His heart rate was quick. Draco didn't seem to know what to do either.
"How are you doing Harry?" Hermione asked.
"I can't believe this, Potter. You're just going to believe what people told you? Not everyone in Slytherin is bad and not everyone who's bad is Slytherin. Gryffindor is way worse than Slytherin. Slytherin tops all the other houses.
""Sorry 'bout that. Reckon he was takin an interest in ya. Don' worry though, he wouldn' hurt ya." Hagrid assured.
"Ronald, of course saving Malfoy is worth all of this! He may not have been too nice to us in the past but that's not worth the rest of his life!" Hermione exclaimed.
" Draco laughed.
George suddenly came behind Harry, and handed him purple sweets.
"Me too."
"Draco... I think you became my hearts desire. And I got you."
Snape stepped in. Umbridge demanded vertasium from him. Snape claimed he had no more in stock. Harry realised he had been stupid. Snape was a part of the Order.
"Yeah." Harry replied dryly, not knowing what else to say.
Malfoy looked down at the ground to avoid looking at Harry.
"They'll torture you! You don't understand!"
"But what about the curse?"
"Wittle Dwaco thinks I won't hurt him?" Bellatrix taunted. "you're wrong. Aunty Bella will kill you. Ill tell wittle Dwaco's mummy and daddy you were killed - fighting against wee Potter. There will be no more dishonour upon our family!"
"What a concept." Malfoy muttered to himself. "Harry Potter cares about whether or not I die"
"No, Potter." He pushed Harry's book slightly away from him. "I don't want you spending all your time on this either. You have a life and you can't continually work on this day and night if you want to pass your classes. There's already so much assigned. It'll be alright."
"I'm also completely in love with you." Harry replied. They looked at each other for a few minutes in silence, and Draco traced Harry's face with his finger softly, as if trying to absorb every detail of him. Harry stayed as still as stone, looking at Draco's concentrated expression. Then, out of no where, Draco burst into laughter. The randomness of the outburst made Harry laugh too.
But, Harry noticed that the more he talked to Malfoy the more Malfoy seem to stray farther away then the image he'd set for himself for the last five years.
The cake was brought out, 16 candles lit on top.  Everyone sang in harmony. The cake was cut. Draco took a few bites before giving the rest to Harry.
"Look, could you all please, just, look at this with an open mind. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't completely trust him now."
"I can guess though..." Harry looked down. " I really am so sorry. I'm so sorry." Harry found himself being the one trying to pointlessly mask the cracks in his voice this time.
"Terrible, yet not as bad as they could've been. I suppose it was as good as you'd expect, when your family is full of Death Eaters." Draco said it cooly, as though he could be talking of the weather. Didn't get cursed, nor did I see or hear people being tortured." Harry didn't know what to reply.
"And what has faltered?"
"I'm sorry."
"Malfoy." Harry stood up. "What are you doing here?"
"Coming from Loony Lovegood." Zacharias scoffed. Luna still seemed unfazed, but Draco glared at him with cold eyes. Harry  spoke out.
Harry was left speechless. He'd never thought he'd see Malfoy like this. Ever. Malfoy always wore a hard shell, and in the past, the only reason he'd ever spoke to Harry was to insult him. But now things were different, and he was here witnessing Malfoy crumbling emotionally right in front of him and he didn't know how to react. He didn't know what to do. What to say.
"No problem."
you-" Lucius started.
When Harry was finally exhausted enough to drift to sleep, the rest of his night was filled with nightmares.
Malfoy shook his head. Harry looked at him with a puzzled expression.
Harry's dream of the corridor continued. It frustrated Harry. He just wanted to know what was behind that stupid door.
Malfoy lifted the book to Harry's face and aggressively pointed at the incantation.
Hermione pointed her wand to the mess, and muttered a few unfamiliar spells. The mess was cleaned up and the bag turned back up. His bowl was filled with food.
"No." Harry whispered. Lucius was accompanied by Bellatrix Lestrange. More Death Eaters puddles behind them.
"But what if you don't die?" Harry challenged.
people get betrayed. " Draco shot a jinx at Harry, who although was surprised, managed to dodge it.
"Thanks, Malfoy- some help would actually be nice...if you don't mind."
"Well he's one of my best friends, isn't he? 'Course I love him. Like I love you and Ron." Harry tried to brush off her question. Hermione shook her head.
"But that's your
"My son. Hand me the Prophecy, and there will be no repercussions for your behaviour tonight. If you give me the Prophecy, you will be rewarded. Your betrayal will be forgotten."
Harry started to calm down again.
Would they think of him differently? Harry reminded himself that this was Ron and Hermione. They've been by his side for five years, this wouldn't turn them against him. But every time he thought about telling them, anxiety would build in his throat. He decided he wouldn't tell them unless they almost figure it out for themselves and Harry doubted that would happen.
"How do I know this won't poison me?" Draco looked suspiciously at the leaves. Harry have him a slight glare.
"Wait, what?" Ron asked surprised.
But, as they pulled apart, it all set in and anxiety crept upon him. What was he doing? This was
"Stay away from me or I'll smash it." Draco sneered. "The Dark Lord wouldn't like that now, would he."
But Hermione still seemed unsure. "We can't be sure it actually worked..." She said nervously. " I could've gotten it wrong."
" Listen, Potter. We'll discuss this tomorrow. Meet me at the tree by the lake tomorrow at lunch if the weather is suitable. Bring the bloody book. I don't want to talk to anyone right now anymore, so you better get to bed Potter. You're lucky I'm exhausted, otherwise I would have hexed your arse off. Goodnight." Malfoy said sternly with a tired subtle ache in his voice.
"Do you have any better ideas?" Hermione asked simply, her lips pursed. That quieted Draco.
"I'm.
"Why?" Asked Harry incredulously. Draco was a great seeker.
They closed their eyes for a second, and when they open them, there was a stone fireplace in the center of the wall, burning a roaring orange flame.
"Oh Alright."
He looked around the room. Tonks  was there too now, dueling with Lucius. Mad-eye, Kingsley. The members of the Order were all there, fuelling with different Death Eaters. All the Death Eaters were aiming to kill.
"No- I mean. Aren't you worried about people seeing you alone with a boy here on Valentine's Day. People might think..."
As soon as soon as he took the last one down and set them all into a drawer, the first few members began to arrive and people began spilling in.
"BLOOD TRAITORS, FILTH! I AM DISGUSTED! I AM REVOLTED! I DEDICATE ALL MY LIFE TO THE PURITY OF THIS FAMILY AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET!"
"What's that? You're not making sense Potter. You've gone bonkers." The Slytherin roared with laughter. Harry stayed silent.
Saturday morning, Harry lingered by the library, his hands in his pockets and his hair messy. He was waiting for Malfoy. The halls were empty, because everyone else was enjoying the unseasonably warm weather outside.
" Hermione looked sharply at Ron. "You're lucky I haven't written to your mother yet."
"Oh yeah."
All was well. For a few days. Hermione woke him up one morning, one of her schoolbooks in her arms. Her expression was almost... broken. Panic jumped to Harry's throat and he felt a weight in his chest.
Umbridge took their wands from them, and set them on her desk. She questioned Harry and he refused to say anything.
He changed the subject again, he didn't want to think about that anymore.
"I curious. I remember the same thing."
"Oh never mind those." She said and then cast an unfamiliar spell on Draco before he could reject.
for you." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Mistletoe." Draco pointed up above them. Harry looked up, and sure enough, suspended up above them was the green plant. Harry's feet were rooted to the ground, and Draco didn't move either. Harry noticed how close they were.
Harry wasn't sure what she meant by the last part. "
"Oh that's a good point." Harry smiled.
Draco looked around wearily around the almost empty dorm, processing everything.
Harry followed after him. The cool air stung his face. Draco was still wearing his scarf, but he didn't mind.
"Well he's not with you lot, we'd thought we'd wait and tell you who he his before he comes out." Ron told the group. Hermione had a concerned expression on her face, and everyone else looked confused.
They all froze.
again
"I won't let anyone do that to you again...But... you should raise your guard up. It's very possible that someone may try."
It was the afternoon, and the sunset was expected to start soon. The lake shimmered, and mountains surrounded it. There was forest behind him, and the sunlight of the setting sun shone through the green leaves of the tall trees. Harry sat by the shore, looking out into water that lapped onto the rocks close to his feet.
"If you ever wondered what the Gryffindor Boys dormitory looked like, well here it is." Harry said awkwardly. Draco wrinkled his nose.
Sometimes Draco would update Harry on what Umbridge had set in store. Other times they'd just meet up simply to be close to each other. To see eachother without the public facade they put up.
"...Sure..." Draco hesitated. "But not anywhere where people can see us... I don't want people knowing we're friends."
Then he realized a Gryffindor was awake, a sixth year,  looking right at them in confusion.
Ron glared at him.
"Thanks for stopping that awful screaming."
Harry shrugged.
Ron nodded stiffly, a poor attempt to hide his annoyance. Harry said nothing more.
"I love you."
"Put Draco down!" Hagrid commanded.
"You're probably right." Draco sighed, a smile playing on his face again.
"Oh, but you're the best thing thing that's ever happened to me."
"Detention for lying - You make such unbelievable lies I'm astonished on how your simple little mind thought I wouldn't see through that. I expect you to see me after class."
"Sure. We're friends. Friends that don't even address each other using their first names." Malfoy scoffed.
"That's because she doesn't hate you." Harry told him.
Harry walked into the Great Hall for breakfast. As he walked, a few students snickered at him. He was used to that, though. Ever since the daily prophet started writing stories about how "crazy" he was.
Harry found himself extremely great full that he'd taken Draco's name off the contract. Had
"I really can't argue with you, can I?" Harry sighed sadly.
The sun had not yet risen, but Ron was sat up, looking at Harry in confusion.
"I wish I could watch the stars with you." Draco whispered.
"You've told me that already. Next."
"I didn't know there was vodka!" Draco slurred excitedly as Harry handed him the cup. Fred and George roared with laughter as Draco downed the water. Draco smiled drunkenly at Harry before turning back to Fred and George to continue his story about apples.
"But Harry, that's- "
Harry cried for a while. And Draco just hummed softly to him, his arms around him. Comforting him.
They reached the door that Harry had longed to open ever since it had  first appeared in his dreams months ago. He took the knife that Sirius had given to him, and used it to unlock the door.
"I drank this wonderful potion, that ensures I have energy."
The weight Harry carried in his stomach became heavier.
"It's complicated."
Hermione gave him a small smile and Ron raised his toast up.
"Don't hurt him! Don't hurt Harry! Please not Harry!" He yelled. Draco seemed like he was disconnected from everything around him, in a trans. Like he was trapped in his own mind, caught in an ever living nightmare that he couldn't wake up from.
He became silent, as did everyone else. Draco cleared his throat, and faced everyone again, calming himself down.
He heard the door open behind him. He turned to face a burly Slytherin, a silver badge on his chest. He was part of the Inquisitorial Squad. When he saw Harry a malicious smile spread across his face.
"How'r we supposed to get to the ministry?" Ron asked. Harry realised he didn't have a plan. He didn't think he'd get this far.
"You are the absolute worst. Why are you the way that you are? Every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way." Draco said with a huff. Harry just laughed harder.
But taking it out on other people was not the answer.
"Hello, Potter." the familiar voice of Draco Malfoy spoke softly behind him. Harry turned to look at him, with slight surprise. Malfoy's usually neat blond hair was slightly unkempt.
In a split second they both had their wands pointed to each other
Probably Saturday." Draco thought. "I'm free all day on Saturday."
"You should probably shouldn't go anywhere alone." Ron advised. "I know you have wicked defence skills but, I mean, look what happened today."
"Oh." Harry grumbled.
"But sir! I have plans!"
"Are you really sure you should be reading through that book? I mean you read a few words out loud and ended up accidentally cursing someone to death! This has to be the most dangerous book I've ever seen."
"No no, I can pay." Harry argued, reaching into his pocket.
Draco stopped in his tracks, panic lining his expression.
Inside, it was much more cozier. The windows had a clear view of the snowy village, and their was music playing softly around them, seeming to come from the ceiling. There were very little valentines decorations, which relieved Harry, who was getting tired of seeing nothing but red and pink hearts. The only decorations they had was a red rose suspended in mid air at every table. There were a few couples already there, but all of them were either Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs which surprised Harry.
Harry was stiff, unable to move. His eyes were closed. The boy kicked him in the side repeatedly. He felt a cry in his throat but Harry couldn't move. Then the Slytherin kicked him in the nose and blood gushed on his face. He wished he would just pass out so he wouldn't have to be aware of what was happening. It reminded him of Dudley and Uncle Vernon. Then he felt pain in his arm, accompanied by a loud crack. He couldn't breathe through the pain.
"Well...Voldemort's got Sirius. I saw it." Ron's eyes widened but Hermione looked unsure. Draco just looked plainly confused.
"You could be in Gryffindor, you know. You're very brave."
Hermione did end up giving him the sickles the next day. He pretended to smile and he thanked her. But right as she was about to walk off to the girls dorm, he stopped her.
Draco shook his head. "God, no. I don't enjoy being stuck in the Hospital Wing, thank you very much."
"We should probably get back to bed." Ron yawned, and obvious attempt to change the subject from Draco. Harry waved for him to go, pretending he couldn't see how Ron felt.
"How are you feeling, mate?" Ron asked.
"This wasn't supposed to happen, I would never have intentionally done this to you- I've never in my life wanted to kill you, Malfoy. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please. " Harry cried. "There has to be a counter curse- there has to! Do you know ?"
"What's that?"
Hermione was off to the side, disgruntled and still attempting to read a book by the fireplace.
" Said Hermione shrilly. Draco gave a guilty look.  Hermione simply huffed.
He had called Hermione
So much for not drawing attention to Draco.
They don't have brooms, Weasley." Draco pointed out.
"What've yeh done this time, Harry?" Hagrid shook his head, glancing towards Draco.
"So where to next?" Draco asked.
Harry hesitated. "I promise."
"Luckily, it shouldn't take too long."
care less about my reputation and ego. I just don't want you dead, Malfoy. I don't want anyone dead. I'll reverse it.  I'll do everything I   possibly can to reverse it. "
That didn't stop the jets of light being hurled towards them.
"People like you are sick. Messed up." The Slytherin sneered. " You get what you deserve."
"First of all- we're going to figure out how to reverse the curse. You're not going to die that day, Malfoy. You're going to live a full life alright, and everythings gonna be okay because were going to figure it all out. Second of all- Malfoy, I've said this. If you do end up getting the unfortunate side of the curse, I would never be happy about the outcome. Ever. I told you this. I know youve been an arse to me for the past five years, but believe it or not I don't hate you. Voldemort? I hate. Umbridge? I hate. You? You don't even come close."
"I'm sorry."
"Who did it?" Harry asked, even though he already knew the answer.
"You think that just because I dislike you I wouldn't care if you died? That's not how it works. You bully me, that's true. But that doesn't mean I want you dead. Life isn't something to play around with. Life is precious and special, even yours. Believe me, I've seen enough death in the past 15 years and I know that with my life it's so painfully unavoidable. But I want to see as less of it as possible. Every time another life is lost because of me, I break a little bit more. I can't bare to see you die because of this, Malfoy."
"Er... that's just a precaution." Hargrid said nervously. "He don' know his own strength, y'see."
"What happened?" Harry asked softly.
"Nothing. I don't want to be around you. I hate you. I can't be around you." Harry said coldly. Draco looked taken aback. Shocked. Hurt. Harry reminded himself this was necessary. He couldn't let Umbridge or Voldemort get to Draco. Harry's mind flashed to Cedric, to his parents. To Lucius being tortured. He couldn't let that happen to Draco.
"In the
"You deserve kindness, Draco." Harry said, reading his sad eyes. "You deserve friendship, love, all those things."
!" Screamed Draco.
He turned quickly so that his robes swished with him  and exited the restricted section, leaving Harry standing there, thinking an abundance of thoughts about what he had done.
"I know this is because i told you i loved you. Can't a man love his best friend?" Draco said fiercely. Harry came to a realization on what he was talking about. The lake.
He felt an abundance of emotions at once. He couldn't control it. The mirror in the room cracked. Accidental Magic. He needed to calm down. But god it was so hard.
"I love you." Draco said. " I love you so much. There's no place I'd rather be right now than here with you."
"I need to show yeh guys somethin'. Hagrid said lowly. "Yeh can come too if yeh'd like." Hagrid looked to Draco. Draco just looked confused.
"Thanks." Harry said, flustered.
"What are you saying?" Harry asked quietly.
"I'm bad for you." Harry said.
"Draco. Don't yell. Please." Harry requested calmly. Draco regained himself immediately, giving Harry a look of sorrow.
"Why don't we use our broom sticks?" Ron asked.
"Harry." Draco sighed, a lopsided smile on his face. " You're absolutely wonderful."
"Er..."
"I-I didn't think to go to Madame Pomfrey's because I was so sick I just wanted to go to my dormitory." Harry lied.
But Harry couldn't avoid the pair forever. Especially considering Neville, who although has shown great improvement, wasn't doing too great against Draco. He realized that Draco kept stunning Neville before he could even cast out a spell.
"So me and Draco aren't exactly enemies anymore. We're actually friends now." Harry explained.
Together Draco and Harry talked, they were in the Green House together, looking at the plants.
inscribed onto it? Does that not concern you in the
, Hermione. It's alright to have fun every once and a while.
Harry couldn't stand it. But he had to. He just had to.
"I know that Potter, you don't need to cry about it to bring it to my attention."
"M-Malfoy?" Harry whispered. "What's wrong with you?"
Draco scowled.
"You. Are the bravest person I've met. And a fucking great wizard. We all have are weaknesses Harry. Don't let one fall cloud every thing else." Draco told him seriously. Then he grinned. "I love you."
"Thank you, Potter, for attempting to be heroic, but there's no way. There just... isn't. And if he found out that I'd run off with
Harry looked beside him and sure enough, there was Draco with blond hair and slytherin robes, passed out beside him.
Harry smiled back. "I love you too."
"Hey, it'll be alright. People will have to either acknowledge that you've began to change as a person or they'll have to deal with it."
"You're going the wrong way." Harry laughed and Draco turned and started walking the other direction, an annoyed look on his face.
"Well, I mean look at me Potter." Malfoy looked down waving his arms up and down. He looked back up up at him, and Harry thought it looked almost like he was about to burst into tears. But Malfoy wouldn't. Would he?
Harry reached into his back pocket, grabbing his wand, preparing to disarm himself in case anything happened.
"I do. Let me have house pride, will you? Just because there are gits in my house doesn't mean it's
He propped himself up slightly, a lopsided smile on his face.
"Hey." Harry nudged Hermione. They were in the room of requirement, silently looking through plans of the next DA meeting.
"Thanks, Ron." Harry grinned.
"How can you even know?"
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. You're an idiot." Draco said.
a cure staring right at us in one of these books and I never end up finding it because i just stopped?" Harry looked up at him worriedly.
"S-sorry - dozed off." Harry straighted his glasses.
"I hear them too, Harry." Draco whispered to him softly. Sadly. "We need to leave this room. It'll do us no good to stay here. This isn't where your godfather is."
The one with the
She opened the textbook and held it out to Harry. Her hands were shaking.
"If you don't want to agree to help him, then you don't have to. But we're going to help Hagrid." Hermione said firmly. Draco gave in.
He hadn't talked to the two of them all day, not even in classes. After lunch, Harry and Malfoy had decided to skip the rest of their classes for the day, which Harry knew would backfire on him, especially considering one of those classes was Umbridge's. But they needed as much time as they could muster to figure out the reversal to the spell.
"Why do you even care, Potter? You hate me." Malfoy asked coldly.
" No I haven't- not intentionally at least. I just needed to find information . And I could've carried on with that with no problem if you hadn't strut in here like you own the place."
"Are you alright, Harry?" Dumbledore asked. What a stupid question to ask. He nodded anyways, even though he felt anything but alright.
"Could it be? Harry Potter has a boyfriend!" Rita exclaimed as she reached into her ugly handbag to grab her quill. "Tell me Harry, when did you figure out you swung towards wizards rather than witches?" She asked urgently, glee in her voice. Draco gave her a cold look, and Harry just stood there dumb-struck and uncomfortable.
"You're supposed to be a
"He's still learnin'..." Hagrid Said apologetically.
"You do realize centaurs travel in herds. If they all come attacking us, Hargrid wouldn't be able to save us." Draco said in an angry whisper.
" And I know that to cast this curse, all that must occur is a person who carries magical blood in their heritage must read it out in their native language..." Malfoy looked at him straight in the eyes, a mixture of fury, anxiety and frustration laid across his face.
Harry looked down in shame. "I didn't and now i wish i had."
"Hmm." Draco looked down. "I think maybe this particular curse makes it seem painful. But I think when I get there, it won't hurt. I think it'd be more of a relief."
There were whispers in the room.
"I know, Harry." Hermione said with sympathy. "But, there's many other sources we can look through."
"I love you guys."
Umbridge?" Draco argued.
"Yeah, mate. We've literally been enemies for years, and now he's all you ever talk to."
Harry's meetings with Draco soon began to stop after Fred and George's memorable exit. Harry admired the twins, feeling no regret giving them his triwizard winnings. He couldn't help but wish more than anything that he could take of like they had, with Draco by his side. But he knew he needed to stay at Hogwarts. Hogwarts needed him just as much as he needed Hogwarts.
"Are you saying I'm not as smart as you?" Harry demanded.
Harry decided, though, that he would schedule one last D.A. meeting before Holiday break. He figured Draco probably wouldn't even come, and if he did happen to come, he'd probably ignore Harry completely. Harry hoped Draco wouldn't come. Meeting with just him was risky enough, but if Umbridge found out he was part of their secret defence group... well Harry didn't want to think about that.
"'Blood- Traitors.'" Harry mocked him, giving him a glare. Draco frowned.
"But." Hermione began with a frown and Harry's stomach dropped as sudden anxiety filled him. But?
that you were kissing in the picture?" Ron asked.
"I can't believe I wrote this down on my bucket list. This will kill me before the curse every will." Draco shook his head.
Then he followed Draco quickly. He finally caught up to him. He was stopped, staring at an empty portrait.
"Alright, I'll meet you there then." Draco nodded.
"NO!" Harry pushed Draco away.
Harry continued to the table, after looking back at the fire one last time.
And before they could interfere, Hagrid walked over and poked the giant with his bow. Draco looked faint as they watched the Giant raise from the ground. Grawp looked down at them and yawned widely. It was loud, like boulders tumbling down a mountain. He was at least 20 ft tall, if Harry had to give an estimate.
"I'm worried for you. How you'll be after- if- ."
"Oh?" Hermione questioned.
Harry looked to Draco, who was still unconscious. He lifted the spells that the twins cast on him so that Draco's hair was once again short and blonde. His face was clean and calm. His robes the familiar Slytherin colours.
A voice came out of his mouth that wasn't his own. He could not focus on what that voice said. He wondered if this was dying. He thought about being with Sirius. His parents. And possibly later on, Draco. He wondered if his parents, Cedric, Sirius felt like this when they died. He felt a wave of sorrow for them.
"You're an idiot, I hope you known that." Malfoy shook his head in disappointment.
"Maybe you haven't looked hard enough." Draco said with a snark. She rolled her eyes and the portrait flung open. Harry had thought it'd be trickier than this and was quite relieved. They climbed through.
He grabbed around him until he found them. The lenses were scratched and the frames badly bent.
"I should probably tell Draco too." Harry suggested.
Professor Lupin had created the map. Too much to explain.
" Draco said firmly.
"Morning." Harry sighed. "We have until before three to work, just as a heads-up."
"I solemnly swear I am up to no good."
"Can I kiss you?" Draco asked with a playful smile.
"No, I can't walk- I'll only hold you up- take it and leave me behind!" Draco said, reaching in his robes for the orb.
Hermione had noticed, as she was bound to. She approached him one day, as they studied for O.W.Ls.
"Come along, Potter." Draco spat. "You'll soon find out what happens to people who try to sneak around professor Umbridge." There was a smirk on his face.
"Don't call me Malfoy." Draco muttered angrily. "That's my father's name."
And soon enough, it was time for the Weasleys, Hermione, and Luna to go.
Harry shook his head with the smallest smile on his face before continuing his journey to the common room.
"You've done enough to him, focus on the others."
"How do you expect to figure out if he's actually there or not?" Ron asked. Harry thought for a second before he had an idea.
"Are you deaf, Potter?!"
"God, just stop arguing over this." Draco said and they both fell silent. "Just let me take it. It doesn't matter at this point. I'm already in pain, and I'm already dying."
"What I'm wondering is how Malfoy already knew about such a curse. He certainly knew more then the book said or else Harry woulve known what he was doing in the first place." Hermione looked at the two of them, thinking hard.
"Potter...?" A surprised, shaky,
The three of them looked wearily at each other. Harry sighed before they agreed to go. They followed Hagrid out of the castle and they walked towards the Forbidden Forest.
"You're still mad about yesterday, aren't you." Harry sighed.
"What's happened?" Draco asked. Harry thought about how to recount his vision.
Harry was conflicted on how to feel about the curse now. Because, Draco was going to die because of it. Because of him, and Harry absolutely despised that. He was angry, frustrated, and upset about it. But at the same time, he never would've formed a relationship with Draco if it weren't for the curse. Never would've been able to understand his point of view, his pain.
"No." Harry replied quietly. "You're drunk." Draco's expression shifted slightly into disappointment. Not much, but enough for Harry to notice.
Ron laughed. "People won't stand for it, with what he's done in the past. That won't last a day."
Hagrid looked disappointed at his words.
"And you haven't really talked to us at much." Ron chipped in after taking a swig of pumpkin juice.
"Do you think I haven't seen enough torture and death and horrible things in my life to understand?! Do you think my father shielded me from the Dark Lord's doing? God, Harry, I've seen so much. Too much. I've witnessed people being killed like flies. I am prepared for anything the Dark Lord could bring my way."
"I'll miss you." Hermione said. "I wish we didn't have to leave so soon."
The minutes counted down and Harry was drowning. He couldn't outrun the racing clock.
He realized that his enemy, who had pushed him around for five years, was now his friend.
Harry collapsed into one of the comfy chairs in the common room by Ron and Hermione. He swung his bag to the side and took a deep breath. The three of them were the only ones in the Gryffindor common room.
"Not Umbridge's."
Draco escaped to another room, narrowly dodging the green spells of light, making Harry's heart race. Then he realised Bellatrix  was no where to be seen anymore. But he had no time to linger on that, for another Death Eater had cornered up on him.
"I'm sorry..." Harry looked down. "It's just been complicated with him. I've learned a lot about him that's changed my view on him. Maybe if you'd try and get to know him you'd feel differently about him." Harry suggested. Hermione sighed.
"He's my
"You love him, don't you? Draco." Hermione asked, her expression almost sympathetic. Harry's heartrate quickened.
Draco's chest was now ice cold. His eyes closed as he gave a final breath. His heart was silent. The clock stopped.
"Maybe we can..." Draco said suddenly. "The ministry only tracks magic performed around us. They can't prove that we do the magic because this is a wizard's house. Magic is performed here all the time."
"Yeah, I wanted to know if you'd like to hang out." Harry pushed up his glasses. He felt awkward, and his face was red.
"Do you really think my father would care if it's illegal? Considering?" Malfoy flung another rock at the lake.
"Then why?" Draco demanded. Harry struggled for words.
"Draco will be fine. When he wakes up, he will be shaken. But he will not suffer long term effects."
Harry heard snickering again from Malfoy in the corner of the class. Harry rolled his eyes and ignored him. Snape paid no attention to Malfoy either, which slightly frustrated Harry. But Harry felt a bit guilty for being frustrated because he had cursed Malfoy not too long ago. But Snape didn't know that, so why should he give Malfoy special treatment?
He woke up in the hospital wing. He felt sore, but the pain had dissipated. His arm was still in a sling though. He sat up, and reached for his glasses on the table by his bed.
"Alright. You have a point." Draco sighed. "But, it's not really that hard to pass O.W.Ls. I have connections. My father is a ministry worker. Anyways, if all else goes wrong, I'll probably pass Defense Against the Dark Arts." Draco argued. Harry shook his head in disbelief.
"Potter wake up you buffoon!"
"Let's go." Harry said and they ventured back to the castle.
"What are you talking about mate?"
"Of course." Harry smiled.
"We better hurry now then." Harry advised. "Basil is still there."  Draco cursed.
"What is it?"
"Alright. Although it's not like this list will be laying around anywhere. If anyone finds it everyone in the D.A. will not be in the best of times. But just because you asked, I'll do it. Anyways I might be able to keep the jinx in place even after removing his name..."
"Harry do you have the book with you still?" Hermione asked suddenly.
"But Hermione, I planned to spend the whole day with... someone. Can't it wait?" Harry bargained.
"Day- co?" The giant asked.
They reached the spot and sat down next to each other.
Harry's heart swelled. He gave a small smile, sipping the tears from his eyes.
"But it feels like he's taking up all of you're time and you'd rather talk to him more than us now. It feels like you're abandoning us for him."
." She whispered to the boy, who didn't move.
"Thank you, Harry." Draco said, a  weak smile on his face "You helped me love myself."
"That was a joke, Potter. Lighten up." Malfoy laughed as he grabbed his things and put them into his bag.
"Of  course I'll stay with you. I'll be with you, until the very end." Harry replied, his throat tight. He held Draco's hand.
"No. You're kidding."
"... I'll do it later..."
"Get out! All of you, just leave!" Draco said furiously. "Since you can't seem to let the subject go, just leave!"
"I told him your idea of the sickles, Hermione, and he seemed to like that idea. So he's got one now." Harry praised Hermione.
Harry sat up and turned to see an angry, red eyed Malfoy looking down at him, quickly wiping his face.
HER!"
"Sore." Harry said honestly.
Harry heard footsteps and backed away from the door with a whimper.
"What's happened?" Draco asked, exasperated.
He should've been back to his own common room before the night was over!"
Harry braced himself for the pain But it never came. He heard the opening of the Bathroom door. He heard spells being blasted back and forth. All he could do was lay there. Once the spells stopped, he heard people yelling. Bangs. Then everything was quiet except for foot steps against the tile floor. He began to regain feeling in his limbs. But he didn't move. He just lay there, with his eyes closed.
Hagrid got up again and went back to the teacups he had abandoned on the counter.
"We need to go to the ministry ourselves."
Harry realized she was probably right. But he didn't want to take chances. He couldn't. But Hermione spoke more.
Harry stopped reading. He couldn't bare to go on. He suddenly didn't feel like eating anymore. He looked up to the Slytherin table. Draco wasn't there. Hermione looked at him sympathetically.
"No, Harry! I swore I'd go and help you and that's what I'm going to do!" Hermione said firmly.
"What happened next, Harry?" Hermione asked.
"That's correct. Now what do you have done so far?"
He escaped the room, and was back once more in the circle of doors. He took the Prophecy out of his pocket. Then he heard yelling.
"How much I bloody love you, as usual." Harry replied cooly.
"Girls can go into the boys dormitory,remember? You just can't go into ours." Hermione reminded him. "Anyways, Harry. Draco is
"Where?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
"Maybe. But you didn't. We fell in love anyways so, it doesn't matter either way."
Harry slowly walked over to it. He could hear voices behind it. Unaudiable, but there.
mud-blood in second year, because it was a word he learned from his father. And He needed to stay true to his father.
"I don't even feel safe now, though. I'm just constantly afraid."
"I've found the Counter curse."
"I'm fading Harry. I'm falling asleep. Look into my eyes." Draco whispered. Harry looked into those sliver eyes of his. They were scared. They underlined pain. But they were still bright. Draco gave him a gentle smile.
"No- no. He can't be-" Tears started to spill from his eyes. "He
Draco took Harry's hand. His fingers cold. Harry held tightly, rubbing circled with his thumb on the back of Draco's hand.
They tried several other doors. There were so many doors. Each of the rooms had doors of their own. Doors rotating around them, slashes making a circle of red as they span. Harry became frustrated and anxious. What if it was too late for Sirius? Harry shivered and brushed the thought from his mind.
"We're just glad you're alright." Hermione told him. "Also Harry, we brought your things for you... you left them at the table during breakfast.' Hermione set his bag down by his bed. Harry thanked her. Then he hesitated.
"Buckbeak only attacked you because you didn't listen to what Hagrid clearly told everyone to do. He said: 'Don't insult them they're proud creatures.'" He tried to imitate Hagrids voice, poorly. "And you know what you did? You insulted the damn bird."
"We should get working on that essay of yours." Malfoy said, flipping towards the page about the potion.
But Harry knew he never really wanted it to be any other way. It wouldn't have felt right with anyone but Draco. This connection was wonderful. Amazing. As natural to him as magic. Maybe it was magic.
"Well... Not everyone'll fail..." He hesitated. He wasn't sure whether or not he should tell Draco about Dumbledore's Army. Harry certainly trusted him, but he was unsure if Ron and Hermione would as well. He knew they were skeptical of him. Harry decided he would tell Draco anyways, but before he could, Draco cut it.
"Sounds great." Harry nodded, a fake smile on his face. The last thing Harry wanted to do was celebrate. Birthdays seemed stupid to him. Celebrating them seemed stupid to him. All he wanted to do was lay in bed.
"Before three? What happens at three?" Malfoy questioned.
"Goodnight."
"I asked your mud-blood friend, Granger, where I could find you and she said  if you weren't in the library or your common room, you'd be here."
"Good luck, Harry." Ron snorted. "I'll be in the library."  Hermione seemed the tiniest surprised at the last part, but quickly shook it off as he left the common room.
Malfoy and Harry had put (most) of their bickering aside for the day to research everything they could. Malfoy made sure to remind Harry that he would get weaker as time progressed and they needed to get as much done as possible before Malfoy was too weak to help him.
Draco took the map from his hand and studied it.
Harry knew he wouldnt be able to sleep, not with the burning of his scar and the sinking feeling in his stomach. As Ron left, Harry's mind strayed back to Draco.
Silence waved over the room and they all looked at Harry.
Harry paused for a second.
pay. I'm paying." Draco declared, and before Harry could argue, he was already handing coins to the Barista.
"I'm sorry, Harry. I wish I could've done something."
"Thank you, Luna."
"What are the chances that Hagrid will actually have to leave?" Harry reasoned.
Lucius nodded, his face straight.
And now, there was no turning back as they faced the portrait. Harry took the Invisibility Cloak off them, and whispered the password to the Fat Lady.
Hagrid looked at Draco and laughed.
"Fred and George are arranging a late New Years Party so it'll be perfect to escape from everyone then." Harry nodded.
"Oh, its a list of things you want to do before you die. You write it down and try to accomplish everything you wrote down while you still can." Harry explained.
When the time came for Harry to return to Hogwarts, one of the first things he did was set a time on the sickles, so that he could meet with Draco in the Room of Requirement. It was not the usual room for the D.A., but much cozier, with a fireplace and comfortable chairs. Shelves were filled with books around them, like a Library. On the walls, Slytherin and Gryffindor banners were hung.
"This isn' jus' yer forest." Hagrid argued with a grumble.
"What?"
"It's alright Harry- it'll be alright." Sirius said in relief. Harry stood up and gave his godfather a quick hug of  gratitude.
"I trust Harry, he wouldn't do this if he doubted Draco Malfoy. Why shouldn't we give him a chance? People change after all. How would you like it if you tried to join, but you couldn't because of your past?" Luna said, a thoughtful and careful expression on her face. She looked around the room, not mad or upset, but almost disappointed. But for the most part she seemed unfazed, the dreamy look still caught in her eye.
"I see..." Snape glared "but you were well enough to go to your morning classes?"
"You're probably right. Although, it's going to hurt either way."
"Yeah. No shit, Hermione."
Harry went from frightened to being confused and concerned.
"Y'know." Harry started, running his hands through his unruly hair. "I'm really glad I'm here with you."
But he knew one thing. He knew that he'd decided that he trusted him, because there was no way Malfoy could fake all of this. All of the pain that shown in his grey eyes. And Harry only wanted to make it better.
When they noticed him, Hermione greeted him, her lips pursed and narrowed eyes.
"I mean, you can be a git sometimes, but y'know I really think you've actually started to change. And I mean, Harry trusts you. And Hermione has started to. So I think maybe I should look into that too. " Ron nodded.
"Thank you, Harry." Draco said, handling the cloak carefully. "I'll be sure to give it back as soon as I can."
It wasn't until Harry finished his coffee that he remembered he was supposed to meet Hermione at the Three Broomsticks.
Harry traveled quickly and quietly through the dark corridor, sweating under the invisibility cloak. He made his footsteps as airy as possible, all the while attempting to be rather speedy on his expedition.
He looked at Draco, peacefully asleep. Harry felt like it was a crime to wake him up. He gently shook Draco, but Hermione simply cast Aguamenti, splashing water all over Draco's face.
They pulled apart when they heard a rustling in the trees behind them. Draco looked suspiciously at the area, before hesitantly looking back at Harry.
90...91.... almost there. Harry grasped Draco's hand. 92... Harry held his breath.
"What?"
"That's so messed up! Why would people even care if you have a boyfriend? It's not like you're forcing
"So Harry, what's the 411?" Draco yawned. Harry raised an eyebrow.
He brushed off his constant stalling of D.A. meetings as an attempt to give the members a break before the Holidays. Really, it was an attempt to avoid seeing Draco.
A silver stag materialised from the end of the end of his wand, trotting around the room.
"Wait no." Harry interjected. "If we show this to Dumbledore then he'd know I was in the restricted section without permission, out of bed after hours, and snooping around in a teacher's stuff. A teacher from the ministry at that! I could get in so much trouble and I can't risk being expelled and having to live with the Dursley's again for the rest of my school years."
"Harry,that's a stupid thing to be frustrated about. Out of all things." Draco said.
Harry...can you tell my father, my mother. I forgive them?" Draco asked quietly. Harry was surprised for a second.
He didn't want to be glad about the curse. He wasn't. But the questioning of  his own morality lingered in his mind. Did it make him a bad person to be glad he was close with Draco now, even though it was the result of a terrible curse?
"Alright. Fine." Harry sighed reluctantly.
"You should eat breakfast." Draco muttered.
"Harry. How can you be sure Voldemort has Sirius?" Hermione asked.
The next D.A. meeting occurred no more than a week later. He was thankful he decided to arrive early because Dobby had decorated for Christmas and Harry spent his extra time taking down the bobbles he'd put up, as they all had his face on them.
"But-"
"It's not that we disprove of you building a friendship with him. We think it's great that that you're letting go of you're past with Malfoy-"
The faces of the D.A. look excitedly at Harry as he held his wand up.
"Funny, I was thinking the same thing." He laughed. Harry let his mind let his mind clear of everything but this very moment. And it was blissful.
"Is that...me? "Draco asked faintly. Harry looked closely and noticed photos pinned to the board. They were of Draco standing on the table, long flowing hair and glittery.
"Alrigh'" he sighed. He opened the door to let them in, and Draco immediately stumbled to a chair. The air inside smelt like a fireplace and burnt plastic, and Draco only seemed to have a negative reaction to the smell.
"Tom." Hermione said quickly. "Tom Baker."
"Oh quit yer whinin'. I never poisoned yeh. Only helped yeh." Hagrid shut the jar of leaves and put them back in the cupboard.
"Oh you don't have to throw a party Mrs. Weasley. I know you all are busy and I don't want to trouble you. I don't really  celebrate my birthday that often anyways."
"Well... I mean I whispered it as I read it... but that can't have done anything. I don't know anything about this curse except the incantation. I don't even know how it works or what it's called, let alone how to cast it."
"I just wanted to thank all of you for letting me join and giving me a chance." He told them.
"Don't be too quick to trust him." Sirius warned him. Harry's mind flashed to Peter Pettigrew. He shook the thought away.
Malfoy had seemed rather upset that day, from the moment they met up in the hall. Harry didn't linger on it. Why should he care if Malfoy was having a bit of a bad day? He was there to save his life, not to coddle Malfoy if he was upset.
"I thought none of them could come?" Hermione gapped.
"Is he...is he still alive?" Hermione squeaked.
"You're not actually going to agree?" Draco whispered to them. Harry hesitated.
"Okay." He sighed.
"Shush." Draco rolled his eyes.
"I'm just so- scared." Draco admitted. "Everyone obsessing with finding the counter curse- it makes it seem so much more real. It's actually happening. And it's coming so soon..." Draco put his head in his hands. He was trembling slightly. Harry came closer to him and put his arm around Draco. Draco embraced him and nestled his face into Harry's shirt and sobbed quietly.
Harry looked at Draco and he felt the odd urge to be closer to him. Harry didn't know why. He probably just wanted to comfort him but it felt different. He just wanted to be close to Draco, in his arms for a long time. His heart beat faster with every look Draco gave him and Harry couldn't explain it. It was like adrenaline and warmth, happiness and sadness, all at the same time, hitting him like an ocean wave, but also like the small laps the water gave at the shore of the lake.
As they ventured back to the castle, the four of them were silent. Harry, Hermione, and Draco were still trying to process what had happened.
"You think it's that easy, Potter?" Malfoy rolled his eyes. "My father would kill me before the Curse has the chance to."
before I do. There's so many wizards who live to be over 100 years old and they end up doing nothing with their lives. Yet here I am, signed up for an unavoidable teenage death, and I'm setting out to do
"I didn't know you were our mother." Ron muttered under his breath but Hermione heard.
He and Draco headed back to the school, talking with each other nonstop until they had to part ways. Harry enjoyed Draco's company a lot. He found Draco to be easy to talk to now, and enjoyed the conversations he had with him.
"How'd you get all that?" Ron asked as she placed a bag full of ingredients next to her potions cauldron.
"He's small! The others kep' bullyin' him!" Hagrid cried.
"May I have a kiss?" He asked gentlemanly.
"Fuck, Harry. Fuck fuck fuck." A familiar voice called to him, horrified. Harry couldn't will himself to move, no matter how hard he tried. His brain felt fuzzy. The pain masked everything. And  everything went black.
"You've murdered me, Potter! I'm going to die because of you! You murderer! You did this to me and I'm going to make sure you pay!" Malfoy said as loud as he could without being heard by anyone outside of the room.
"He's got padfoot!" Harry had yelled. "He's got padfoot at the place where it's hidden!"
Harry and Draco sat side by side, leaning on the trunk of the tree looking out at the beautiful water of the lake. Sometimes the squid would pop out from the surface, and Harry would point it out to Draco with a smile. They talked about many different things, from classes to hobbies.
Draco whispered urgently. He pulled back and pinned Harry face forward to the wall.
"Harry, you're awake!" Hermione ran to his bedside, Ron by her side.
"Long story short, Sirius was framed by Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew had faked his own death. Sirius is my godfather." Harry summarized. "It's a long story, I'll explain more in detail later."
"Oh, Harry, don't look like that, I'm sorry... But it's true though. I haven't been looking any better, have I?"
Harry barely dodged the jet of green light sent his way. Harry made fruitless attempts to disarm him. Draco blocked every one of them. But it was the only way to keep him occupied, so that he wouldn't spend killing curses Harry's way.
this book Harry, it should be gone."
He made continual glances at the Map to be sure that no one out on patrol was headed towards his direction. Everyone he was looking out for was conveniently patrolling other parts of the castle and the area he was travelling through continued to stay empty.
"Ever wonder how Fred and George got around so easily?" Harry smiled smugly. He wasn't going to mention that his dad, a convict escaped from Azkaban
"Ah nothing, just declining rapidly into an ailing state and counting down the days to my inevitable death." Draco replied casually. Harry frowned and looked down.
The room span around again. The red slash stayed on the door, identifying it.
"No." Harry replied. " I think it'll be like falling asleep."
"I'm sure you
"Oh." Malfoy looked up from the book. "The date in my mind is July 31st, 1996. The day I supposedly die."
Harry didn't know how to reply to that. Harry had so many people he could trust now, and Draco barely had any. Harry had never really considered that. He felt honoured that he was one of the few people Draco could trust now. He remembered when he used to go to muggle school, he had no friends, because Dudley bullied everyone, and no one wanted to get onto Dudley's bad side, befriending the scraggly boy Dudley didn't like. Harry thought Draco probably felt similarly all his life. Bullied by his father, unable to keep any real friends.
Malfoy gathered his strength and stood up slowly and shakily. Harry stood there frozen, unsure of how to proceed.
Pretty soon, the room had a lighthearted feel and everyone was feeling cheery. The few Patronuses people managed to produce pranced around the room.
Harry froze, and stared at Malfoy.
"Thank god," Malfoy laughed.
They talked as they sipped their coffees, which were actually quite good. Conversation with Draco came easily. Natural. There was never an awkward silence between them. Their conversation spanned from light and funny topics to heavy and deep conversations. As always, he could never be bored with Draco.
It was serene and peaceful, exactly what Harry needed. He needed calm, to escape his overwhelming emotions.
"Yep." He said, his attention elsewhere.
He could no longer be around Draco.
"No sir." Harry gave a feeble reply.
But he was brought back to reality after Draco turned away and swiftly walked out the doors.
"Do you have a bucket list?" Harry asked him.
"No. Of course not. But I won't kiss you when you're drunk. It'd be taking advantage of you and I will never do that." Harry explained, softly playing with his hair.
"I'll find a way. You shouldn't have to go back there."
Mr.Potter."
I'd go first. I'll use the Sickle to warn you if it's okay to travel this way. No means that something terrible has gone wrong. Yes will mean you can go through and everything is alright. If I don't reply in 10 minutes it also means that something terrible has gone wrong." Draco said, holding up the silver coin.
He was back in the room with the veil, but the voices could not be heard beyond the yelling.
"He betrayed us!" Bellatrix screamed. Lucius' expression was cold.
"He'll get cured." Harry said.
Draco hesitated before speaking. "Can- can you kiss me?" he asked him. Without thinking about it, Harry leaned closer to Draco and pressed his lips to his. Harry didn't know what to think. All his life, he'd been told this was supposed to be wrong. But, god, it felt so right.
"Stay away from my son!" Roared Lucius behind her. His robes were tattered from the glass. His eye was beginning to blacken, and his long blond hair was matted. Lucius shoved Bellatrix forcefully out of the way.
"I'm sorry." His voice quivered but his expression stayed the same. He didn't think Harry had heard him. He didn't intend for Harry to hear him. But Harry did.
A shield of magic formed around Harry. He willed himself to crawl to Draco's side, shielding the unconscious boy.
"I never really took that into consideration."
"I'm trying to, yes. It's hard, and it's scary. But I think it'll be alright in the end." Draco said thoughtfully.
"Yer an idiot." Hagrid told him, "but yer gonna be alright, but don' be doin'  that again unless you'd like to vomit." He laughed.
The three of them sat down at Hagrid's table. Ron and Hermione looked at him expectantly.
The lion treaded beside the stag. The animals circled eachother playfully. Then they made eye contact. They approached eachother, and pressed their heads together softly. They faded from view.
"RUN." Harry bellowed, and the four of them sprinted in zig zags out of the isle, dodging spells being sent their direction.
"This is
Harry and Hermione looked at eachother wearily. Draco just looked at them in disbelief.
"He feels really bad about last night, you know." Harry told Hermione, motioning to Ron.
"You've missed Umbridge AND Snape's class! What've you been up to?!"
Harry stared at him. " Of course I care."
"Well she fired Trelawney, but she couldn't make her leave." Said Hermione.
"I can't be around you, Malfoy!" He yelled. " I just can't." Draco was red with frustration, hurt, and anger.
"With Draco, yeah." Harry nodded. "But we still have Umbridge to watch out for."
"She's absolutely vile, and has no right to do that to you, or anyone for that matter." He kicked at a chair.
"Can you promise me that you won't let this... my death...destroy you."
"There you are, at it again. Stating the obvious. We have until July to figure it out. One day without research won't hurt. Anyways what if there is no reversal? We'd be pointlessly overworking ourselves for the rest of the school year. That's not how I want to spend the rest of my days. Anyways, this comes with sooner consequences if it doesn't get done."
Luna's smile stood out from the crowd of weary faces. She parted through the crowd and walked up to him, her earnings bouncing with each step. This seemed to surprise Draco.
"I'm going to die and I'm okay with that. I'm just happy I get to go out and
Harry felt the heat rising to his face.
"Your loss but I suppose photos will have the same effect." Ron shrugged, before he went over to his own bed and collapsed. His snores filled the room mere minutes later.
"That's what I've been trying to do but she's locked herself away."
" That." Draco stated. "Was the worst thing. I've ever willingly put myself through." He leaned back on one of the desks and looked down. Harry laughed.
the need for a party, cause we never had one on the actual day." Was the reply she got.
?" Harry asked calmly.
"Do you think something like this will happen again?" Harry asked. "That someone will try to attack me because of that article?"
"What are you still doing up at this hour? After what's happen" Malfoy sneered, making an obvious attempt to steady his voice.
"You're bloody insane." Draco whispered fiercely to Hagrid. Harry felt like he was missing something important.
"What are you doing?" Lucius looked down to his son, a seething look on his face.
"Draco." Ron said before he left. "I think... I wish I could've gotten to know you better." Ron said guiltily. "You're actually a pretty great bloke."
While Umbridge and Filch were busy dealing with the trouble Fred and George caused, Harry and Draco snuck off to empty classrooms together.
"Sirius warned me not to get too close to him." Harry admitted quietly.
"Nope."
"Where is she?" Harry felt his voice shake. "WHERE IS SHE? I'LL KILL HER. I'LL
"Yeah, well. Maybe if I cling onto that one percent, then everything will be alright." Harry bit his lip.
"You have no business knowing what I'm doing here. And I know you've done something. What have you done to me? What have you done!? My head feels like a thousand knives are stabbing at it. What the bloody hell Potter?!"
They sat in silence.
"I've brought a couple friends, Grawp." Hagrid smiled.
"Wait what?" Ron questioned.
"What's funny?" Harry asked him. Draco thought for a second, as if trying to remember.
They looked around at the shops and bought a few things, which they kept in their robes. Harry enjoyed spending quality time with Draco. He enjoyed not having to think about anything that troubled them. Just being able to hold his hand and talk to him. Like two ordinary boys, who just so happened to be in love.
"You guys are the best." Draco gave a laugh as he patted Fred on the back. Harry walked over to them wearily. In one hand he had a mug of Butterbeer and in the other a cup of water. He had remembered Aunt Petunia saying that water helped sober people up after having too much to drink. It was when Aunt Marge was over, but he remembered she frequently would hand Uncle Vernon water after he had one can too many.
Two weeks later, Harry sat beside Draco once more in the Room of Requirement. They were relaxing on the loveseat together, simply talking. Draco was leaned against him.
"Goodness." Draco said smally.
The clock was going too fast. Harry needed desperately for it to stop. But time does not listen.
"What we're trying to say is. We feel like you've been almost ignoring us for him. And I hope you understand why that upsets us." Hermione said nervously.
"I don't care." Draco smiled. "I figured you'd be sleeping by now. I thought I'd have to wake you up."
Hermione greeted him with a hug.
Harry didn't ponder on it. It's not like it wasn't a regular occurrence for Snape to blatantly favour the Slytherins over the Gryffindors.
"I'm not leaving you behind, they'll kill you!" Harry cried out.
He needed to think clearly about it all. It wasn't really too big of a deal. Everyone already thought he was crazy. At least Draco wasn't exposed. He should just ignore it all and carry on. But the weight in his chest refused to lift.
" I haven't done anything!" Harry quietly exclaimed.  "What's wrong?! What happened? Why are you even here to begin with?"
"Oh no problem, Potter, it was my pleasure." Malfoy said, hiding a smug smile.
Hermione had known before he'd even known himself. He felt a lot of appreciation for her as a friend.
Soon enough, Draco acted as though he'd never spoke more than insults to Harry. But rather then the teasing and snarkyness Draco had given him in the past years, Draco acted through rage and pettiness.
"And...?"
"Of course I want to join." Draco answered him. "I'm very curious to see this club." He jumped up a bit to sit on a desk.
Draco looked back out of the forest. Harry just looked at Draco, a soft smile on his lips.
There were times when they both obviously wanted to kiss but they wouldn't, because they didn't want to interrupt their conversation. They just settled to holding hands across the table. Draco's hands didn't seem to warm up, which concerned Harry. So he held them tighter.
" What was Draco trying to heal exactly?
Mrs. Weasley held a pot in her hands. Harry wondered why she didn't just use magic. But she had been quite absent minded lately.
"Do you think it hurts? Dying?" Draco asked, fear colouring his voice.
Harry planned for a lonely night in the hospital wing. At least he wasn't in pain the entire time like in second year. But Harry couldn't find himself falling asleep.
"Didn't say I was entitled." Harry replied with a chuckle. " I just asked."
The day of the Quidditch game, they didn't have a chance to sneak off together before Hagrid pulled Harry, Draco, and Hermione aside in the empty hallway.
the real world." Draco whispered and lowered his wand.
Harry became more tense. He thought of something. "If it really is Umbridge trying to curse me with the book, well, she doesn't know where it is. And we took the Latin version of the spell off her desk. She's probably on to us." Harry concluded, looking up at Ron. "This really isn't good."
"Then stop complaining." Harry shot back, even though he felt a bit bad about it.
"I...er...decided that I think you're right about the book. It is dangerous. I really don't want to cause any more problems in case anything were to happen with it." Harry lied. For some reason, Harry didn't want to share with Hermione that Malfoy had given up trying to find a cure. Maybe if he didn't tell anyone, it would make it less of a reality in his mind.
Anger coloured Bellatrix's face. And then a reckless look played into her eyes. She raised her wand at Draco.
"HARRY, NO!" He heard Sirius cry. Harry fell to the ground and everything went black.
doing my prefect duties." He answered. "You should hurry on to bed, Potter. People might think you're getting into trouble."
"Anyways, Harry, didn't I tell you that you should've put it back? She could've caught you!"
Harry nodded although he could foresee how she'd probably react.
Mrs. Weasley still came. He'd told her that Draco had the flu. She brought him chicken soup, a worried expression always on her face. Draco accepted the soup graciously but he couldn't keep it down. He couldn't keep anything down.
"We're ending today's meeting early." Harry muttered. "Ron and Hermione can answer any questions."
"Oh. Of course."
"I don't have friends." Malfoy looked down.
"You're complicated." Draco muttered, studying his face. " What's happened to the book?"
Harry shook his head. "No, it was Malfoy."
"Of course." Harry smiled and hopped in the bed beside Draco.
"It's not your fault- don't apologise. It's my fault." Harry muttered bitterly.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and muttered something inaudible under his breath. He then looked at Harry with a cold glare.
"Even if the idea does sound ridiculous." Ron followed Hermione's words.
"Ron did
All the death he'd seen in his life appeared in front of him and it felt like a knife stabbing at his gut.
"See you, Potter." Said Malfoy as he waved back to him.
Ron stood there in shock for a split second before going after her, not bothering to dry his robes. The staircase slid him down three times before he just stood at the end, simply calling Hermione's name.
"-The Book of Death." Hermione cut in.
"Your godfather. He pushed you out of the way when - when she-she cast the curse. He took the blow himself. He fell through the veil. Your godfather is dead, Harry."
"Remember not to draw attention to yourself." Harry said under his breath. Draco looked around distractedly at their surroundings.
"I'm alright." Harry said sheepishly. He looked to Mrs. Weasley. "Would you like some help with that, Mrs. Weasley?" Harry asked her, looking at the pot.
"Harry, we don't hear anything." Hermione said, concerned. Draco rest his hand on Harry's shoulder gently.
" Harry remembered Dumbledore's words. The fierceness in his voice and the madness in his eyes.
"I love you too."
"Hogwarts, a History. It's the same spell they use in the Great Hall." Hermione informed him.
After they settled everything, Draco and Harry were quick to hurry off together.
The evening was warm. Fred, George, Ginny, Ron, Hermione,'Luna. They were all there.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Of course you'd pass of the opportunity to be a part of the best house."
"Er, well that's a story I'd rather not get into right now." Harry said awkwardly. Hagrid shook his head with an exasperated sigh.
They pulled apart reluctantly.
"That's- that's rad." Ron said, struggling to word it. "I mean, he's mellowed our recently... I guess he has changed a bit... it's not too different from you being best friends... I never expected... but- I totally support you." Ron finished firmly, giving him a sure smile.
"Potter." He sneered before making eye contact with Harry, but when  he looked into Harry's eyes, his own flashed red and he jolted over in pain.
"C'mon you three." Hagrid rushing them through the forest.
"Well I hid under the invisibility cloak, but Malfoy already knows I have an invisibility cloak so he pulled it off of me. But then we made eye contact and Malfoy spazzed out. Like his eyes turned red for a moment and he hurled over like he was in pain. So I asked him what happened but then he kept on asking me what I did. And I was confused because I hadn't even taken my wand out! But then he saw the parchment in my hand and he saw the book and he accused me of casting a curse on him!"
"This is goodbye then, isn't it?" Hermione said, her eyes red. Draco nodded solemnly.
"Ah, well slang travels when you're around muggleborns and blood-traitors."
"You should be." Malfoy looked right at him with a straight face. Harry could
"Well." Draco said breathlessly. "I suppose that's one check in my bucket list..."
Harry felt wary about it, but he trusted Draco. Mostly. He hesitated before opening the door for Draco.
Harry was frustrated with himself. He should've been able to handle
"Oh?" Hermione looked up at Harry with surprise. "But I thought you were going to read through it."
"He's not safe talking to me. If Umbridge finds out we're friends, that he betrayed his family. He'll have not only the Ministry's eyes on him, but the disapproval of his family and the cruelty of Voldemort to answer to. If Umbridge finds out he's screwed." Harry tried to explain, desperate for her to understand.
"I'm just glad you're okay. " Draco muttered.
"Hagrid was gone for a few months for a reason." Harry muttered. Draco looked at Hagrid wearily.
"You say yer friends with this boy now? Blimey, Harry you've really let herself go, haven't yeh now."
He walked over and sat next to him.
"It's
When they ventured to the forest, Hermione brought Umbridge into deep shit. Centaurs. And they themselves were saved by Grawp.
"Hello, Harry dear, we're sorry to startle you. We've just came to say hello."
"I skipped."
"I repeatedly told it, 'not Slytherin'."
Harry felt tears building up into his eyes. He tried to hold them back with a shudder. Malfoy came to his senses and turned towards him.  Pure rage infested his expression.
"Oh that is so not fair." Draco argued.
A door would appear and Harry would run through it, only to see Malfoy standing there each time. He was trapped in this never ending maze until he awoke.
"She won't write anything that's not the truth. I'll ensure it." Hermione said, directly giving Rita a cold look.
"Have you
Harry walked over towards the twisty tree in which Malfoy was sitting under, writing in a journal he carried in his hands. His hair fell in front of his eyes as he wrote, deep in concentration. Harry almost didn't want to bother him. Almost.
"I suppose it probably is." Harry sighed.
"Actually, I just went digging in your garden, and I also took a visit to see Luna and her father, who lives over the hill from your house. Luna was happy to help."
"Any ways, Harry, we're Dumbledore's Army. We're going to fight for him. We're going to fight for Sirius." Ron added.
But Harry stayed silent.
Harry struggled for words.
"Hello, Potter." Malfoy walked swiftly towards Harry, wearing a serious expression.
"Er...in the front." Harry rubbed his forehead. Madam Pomfrey conjured a cup of water and handed it to him.
disappointed and you most
A curse hit Harry directly in he chest and he couldn't help but scream from the blinding pain. His whole body gave out and he couldn't help but scream. He was no longer in control of his body, he writhed around. Spots in his vision. This is what the Cruciatus Curse felt like.
"Shh. That's a lie."
"I thought only muggles said that."
Draco said, infuriated. Hermione got up and left the room, followed quickly by Ron. But Harry didn't budge.
"Trust me." Harry said lowly , making eyecontact with him. Draco's eyes were wide and fearfull and he hesitated before closing them and gripping Harry tighter.
"Then lets go!" Harry grinned, taking Draco's hand. Draco smiled.
"Good luck with that." Ron snickered. Hermione scowled at him.
"All of you have gone absolutely mad." Draco muttered. He grasped Harry's hand again, and Hagrid paid no mind. Harry gave Draco an amused smile.
Hagrid poked him with his bow to get his attention. "NO, PUT HIM DOWN!"
"Well I wanted to know how you two felt about Malfoy joining the DA. I figured it give you two and everyone else a chance to get to know him better.
"That's understandable. Neither could I." Draco muttered. " How are you doing? Don't say fine. I know you're not."
"Don't 'but' me, Potter. Just do it. Or I'll take off house points. I can do that. Now run along, and don't get yourself into more trouble than it's worth." Malfoy ordered before walking the opposite direction swiftly.
I planned to spend the entire day with you but she said it was important. I should've told you earlier I just forgot... Would you come along with me? Maybe she'll let me leave sooner if I bring you along. Then we can spend the rest of the day alone together?" Harry asked hopefully. Thankfully, Draco just smiled, an eyebrow raised.
"Not that big a deal?! Harry look at your hand. That's cruel! And for something you didn't even lie about? She's an ignorant woman. She has no place in this school, making ridiculous rules and hurting students. She doesn't even know how to teach!" Draco paced some more. "It'll be a miracle if everyone doesn't fail their OWLs this year." His face was red and he spat out his words with frustration and anger.
"Forgive us, Harry. But we've been your friends for years, and we've become a bit... jealous... because you've only just started becoming friends with him. And we don't want to see you leave us just so you can be with Malfoy more often. It kinda hurts our feelings."
"You know, The Dark Lord has a snake..." Draco told him.
"Does it look like the full moon to you, Draco. In full daylight. In the middle of the month?" Hermione snapped.
"Alright. Sure. But Gryffindor's head of house is Professor McGonagall. Your head of house is Snape the Slime Ball'.  I think that's enough said. Gryffindor easily beats Slytherin." Harry said smugly.
"Ah, that fucking portrait." Draco cursed.
"We'd know who did it because he'd be the only member of the D.A. who hadn't gotten the backlash of whatever jinx you put on the contract."
detention with Umbridge!"
"Doesn't it feel...off... to just give up?" Harry asked him. Draco shook his head.
Slytherin is the best." Draco said firmly.
A tall figure stood above him, wearing a hooded cloak. Dementor? Harry's immediate thought was to cast a Patronus. But the figure was not floating off the ground. The air had not chilled. But the sense of dread was there.
"It'll be okay." Harry whispered back. "Hagrid won't let anything happen."
He cornered Harry, trying to get an answer out of him.
"But aren't there werewolves in there?"
That's good, Harry. I'm glad you took my words into consideration."  Hermione gave him a small smile. She got up and got the book which was resting on a  nearby shelf, hidden behind dusty knickknacks.  "We just need a fire place."
"Only if you were there." Draco chuckled.
"These'll do the trick.'" Hagrid took a couple leaves out. "Work lika charm, these do. Just chew on them an' you'll feel better in no time." Hagrid tried to hand them to him.
"No... I haven't been looking at the Prophet anymore, all it is anymore is rubbish...why?"
Behind them, a manic voice sang out.
"Draco. He's helped us out alot..." Said Harry. But Sirius frowned.
For a moment, Harry could see the vulnerability in Malfoy's eyes. He could see pain. Anger. Sadness. Wonder? But only for a moment before they went back to cold.
Harry wished he could escape. Or just send Umbridge far away. Or ensure Voldemort never existed in the first place. Maybe then would Harry be able to live a normal life. But he knew it was no good to dwell on that. No good to dwell on dreams.
"Gosh, stop complaining
"I don't know..." he whispered.
Draco began silently writing into the journal, leaning in close to the page in concentration. Harry sat there awkwardly because he couldn't see what Draco was writing and didn't want to be nosy by looking over his shoulder.
"July 31st is my birthday."
"I'm proud of you." Hermione told him.  Harry stayed silent as he stared at the dancing flames.
"Draco dies." Harry finished her sentence. He gave a pained sigh as a lump formed in his throat.
"Well didn't you say that whomever is victimized by this curse has the date of their death implanted in their mind? Well how long until- you know."
They were told Mr. Weasley was going to be alright, and make a full recovery. They spent Christmas at Grimmuald place with Sirius, who was happy to have company during the Holidays.
"Oh yes. So Harry and Granger can ride the
"Have you two gone mad? That book is extremely dangerous! What if someone gets their hands on it? Like a Death Eater, or Voldemort? In third year Harry's god father managed sneak inside the school into the Gryffindor common room multiple times to try and kill Ronald's rat. I wouldn't put it a past a Death Eater to try and get their hands on that book... And now Malfoy knows that book exist and has become victim of it- I'm positive he has connections. Anyways, Harry I'm sure the fact that you're turning in the book and exposing Umbridge will out weigh all the rules you broke. Anyways Dumbledore might be able to figure out how to reverse the curse!"
"I'm extremely concerned that the book is even at Hogwarts. Its gotta be illegal to preform that curse, I wouldn't be surprised if that book is illegal to have possession of. I mean can you imagine what someone can do with a book like that! Horrid things! I mean it's titled 'The Book of
Things continued to look grim at Hogwarts. Harry's temper shortened and his mood dropped. It didn't help that Harry could tell Draco's state getting worse. His hands were never warm. He grew thinner, his hair shaggier. His face became almost gaunt and shadows fell under his eyes. He was getting weaker.
"But that's illegal!" Harry interjected with anger.
"Yeah. Not that I celebrate Valentine's day. Capitalism built off of infatuation is what it really is. Valentine's day wasn't even supposed to be about love, if anyone actually researched..." Draco was rambling quickly, from obvious nervousness.
"What brings that up?"
Harry looked at him awkwardly.
"I think this adventure was fun, if I'm being honest." Draco told him. "I'd do it again."
"Harry! Harry!" He heard from the distance. One of the doors that were opened. He ran to the calls. When he got closer he recognised the voice and Harry's heart lept.
"I... I could ask you the same." Harry replied, with hesitation.
"But also Ronald does it surprise you at all? I mean it's Umbridge!" Hermione paused to think for a moment. "But Harry, have you turned it in to Dumbledore? It could be dangerous."
"I'm in the mood to do something risky. I wanna have
But people kept approaching him in the Hallways, asking if he could give at least one more meeting before break. Harry knew he couldn't pretend not to be ignoring them any longer.
"No." Malfoy replied quietly.
Harry tried to argue against them, but Draco made eye contact with him, worry in his eyes.
"I'll miss you." Harry said. Draco gave a small, sad chuckle.
"Er... Okay then... Well. I think Hagrid might be able too help with the nausea. He just recently came back." Harry suggested.
"I'll help you to be brave." Harry promised.
He kept his hand on the page, and ran up the staircase. He burst into Draco's room.
"A curse?!? But how? You hadn't known anything about the incantation and you hadn't even pulled your wand out!" Hermione spoke.
And he disappeared in the flames. Love. He had called Harry Love in front of Ron and Hermione. Ron and Hermione hadn't even seemed to bat an eye. Harry felt pride for Draco that moment. Going first. Taking new steps. But he also felt nervous. If something were to happen to Draco...
Mrs. Weasley came to check up on Harry as often as she could. She constantly asked Harry why they wouldn't stay with them. Harry always told her that it was how he coped with Sirius's death.  That he needed to be there, to find out more about him. And that was partly true. Mrs. Weasley would tell him it was unhealthy. That he needed to be around other people.
"You weren't there Ronald, you were in the infirmary whining about getting sick"
l the heat radiating off his face. He stayed silent awkwardly.
"I don't think you have a choice, mate." Ron grimaced. Harry sat down and Hermione began telling them off, her voice rapid.
"Most definitely."
going to be easy to pass O.W.Ls"
"Why, of course." Harry kissed him. His heart rate seemed to increase every time they touched.
Ron frowned. "But Harry you made eye contact with Malfoy... does that mean...?"
He felt the sickening spin, and he closed his eyes. He landed on the floor of the Ministry of Magic, facing the golden statue. He was covered in soot and his glasses were crooked.
"You'll need to stay overnight... something went wrong when healing your arm. I think it may have something to do with what happened in your second year. But, it should be healed by tomorrow." Madam Pomfrey said before heading out the door.
"I found this, and I decided you should have it. It will keep you safe." Luna said dreamily. Draco kept it in his hand, pressed to his chest.
"Just carry on ignoring me." Draco said bitterly.
They met by the tree ten minutes later. It was still pretty early in the afternoon, as classes had lasted shorter then expected for some unknown reason. The schedules had been a bit weird this year, and classes went on shorter then expected some days, and longer other day. Harry suspected it was Umbridge's doing.
"I just wanted to ask... what were you thinking of when you first cast a Patronus?
"So you're friends with a Malfoy now?" Asked Sirius with a small chuckle.
"Nah." Harry smiled. "I love you most."
"Pull yourself together, Potter. We need to figure this out before my father finds out what's happened."
Harry thought about it for a second before responding, taking a bite of sausage.
"I really am extremely grateful you've given me this opportunity." He said, a small, genuine smile on his face. He bowed slightly towards the three of them, before swiftly walking out, his black cloak trailing behind him.
"Aren't you cold, dumbass?" Draco asked incredulously.
"I'll take care of the boy from here. You're careless. You nearly risked us the prophecy, you bitch."
Draco set down his sketch book and pencil on his floor and scooted closer to Harry, wrapping his arms around him.
drunk." Harry replied.
He wasn't sure what was worse. His ribs or his arm. It all felt the same. He found it hard to breathe with the blood spurting out of his nose.
But before Harry could leave the fireplace, he felt something grab his hair, forcefully pulling him out of the fire. He faced Umbridge, a wide, malicious smile on her face.
Harry would lay with Draco a lot. Sometimes they talked. Sometimes they just listened to each others breaths and heartbeats. Harry stopped sleeping in his own bed and slept with Draco instead. They often fell asleep cuddling each other. Sometimes when he slept, Draco would adjust his position to huddle closer to Harry.
That was the night he saved Arthur Weasley. After seeing him being attacked, through the eyes of the snake. Transported by portkey with the Weasleys, he awaited to hear news on Mr. Weasley's condition. He remembered the amount of blood an his heart sank to the pit of his stomach.
Fred and George planned everything, and they were more than willing to do their part.
"It's just- you've been spending an awful lot amount of time with him-"
"Aren't you?"
"Are you really that sure?" Hermione challenged.
The drawings inside were beautiful, but most of them were really sad. Harry was extremely impressed with them, though. All of the drawings moved on the pages. The first few drawings moved only in small, repetitive motions, but the farther in the sketch book Draco went, the more intricate the art's movement seemed to be.
But every thing changed in a second. Dobby. The disappearances of the Patronuses. The sudden iceyness of the room. Umbridge knew.
""Revenge will only make things worse." Harry told him.  Draco paused.
"How long do we have to figure this out?" Harry asked suddenly.
"Oh, enough. I thought we had stopped going on about a counter curse. It's just a waste of time." Draco snapped. This was the third time Hermione had brought it up. Draco didn't know that Harry too was looking for a counter curse. He couldn't bare to sit around and do nothing as he was slipping away from him. So soon after Sirius too... Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
"Well i haven't exactly been the kindest to you! You? Well you don't really bother me unless I instigate you. But I - Im not a nice person, Potter, according to everyone. Nobody wants me around!"
"You've failed tremendously at this lesson, Mr. Potter. I will not ask you to attempt to make another one, because it is clear that you will never figure out how to do this. Instead, for the rest of the class period I will have you clean up the mess you've made of this room, and for your homework you will write an essay on this potion, how to make it, and the origins. Let's pray that you don't somehow mess this up, because if you do, I'll be
"Well I got a friend out of all of this and I've never had one of those before, so that's quite exciting for me, if I'm being honest. I just wish it could last longer. But no point on lingering on that. Gotta focus on the time I do have. I've gotta live."  He stared up at the winding branches of the tree.
"We need to get you out of here." Hermione said impatiently. Draco rolled out of bed, his hair messy. Harry liked it.
"Did you." Malfoy huffed. "Or did you not read this out loud before I walked into this bloody room."
? You're not safe Harry."
"Are you sure the bloody git is worth all of this? I mean this is serious stuff."
"Okay but the only reason she didn't have to leave was because Dumbledore stopped her. And if you haven't noticed, Dumbledore is no longer here." Draco reminded them.
this much."
"BLOODY HELL!" Draco shot up, wiping the water from his face with the sleeve of his robes. Harry just cast a drying charm on Draco.
"I'm sorry." Harry whispered before speeding up and falling onto the ground in front of Draco
Harry laughed. "I can understand that."
Uncle Vernon would say. But Harry couldn't see how it could be wrong. Their lips fit together like pieces of a puzzle. Their hearts seemed to beat in sync. Harry just wanted to pull Draco closer. This wasn't wrong. This was beautiful. Sparks pulling them closer together. Connecting them.
Sure enough, more Death Eaters spilled into the room. Jets of green and red light flashed all around the room.
"They're all being watched, though." Draco pointed out.
"Oh, Harry." Draco's silver eyes met with Harry's. "You know that I never blamed you at all, right? This just... happened. And I wouldn't have it any other way. So much good blossomed from this. You've long been forgiven by me. It's time you forgive yourself."
Harry set it down in the kitchen before quickly traveling back upstairs to tell Draco they were here. Draco reluctantly got up and traveled with Harry downstairs, using Harry's arm as support.
He reached and grabbed them. They were semi- squashed. He handed them to Draco.
The rhythm of Draco's breaths sent Harry to his own sleep, where his mind conjured the blonde hair and silver eyed boy in his dreams.
Harry gave a deep sigh and closed his eyes for a second before answering.
"I've got your back, Sirius yelled. Curses were sent flying in his directions as Bellatrix screamed them madly.
"Can we ... just talk?" Harry asked. "Not about the curse.
Immediately the room filled with commotion and disgruntled faces. The Weasley twins laughed.
Harry opened the door of the Library for Malfoy and entered after him. The scent of Dusty old books hit them immediately as they walked in. They sat down at a small table in the back of the library, behind rows of books. Nobody else, besides them and Madam Pince were present at the library.
"Well, I don't think you were bad at all, in the heart. You were just pressured and brainwashed into doing bad things.  I think you just have to get to a point where you don't care if your father knows that you don't want to be this way, get to a point where you're no longer afraid, where you're safe. "
"I can't let you get caught." Harry murmured.
"Hermione's right." Harry said grimly. "I did this, now I need to make it right. We don't need another death of a Hogwarts student."
Harry realised there was wind blowing around him. The pain faded. He was laying flat on the cool marble floor.
"Voldemort's planted something in Hogwarts and someone is undercover working with him. A woman."
"Goodbye." Harry said reluctantly,but Draco shook his head.
"She knows not where it is... It has disappeared in Hogwarts."
"What are you apologizing for?" Hermione asked.  Harry wasn't sure. Maybe it was because he'd kept it hidden. Or that he was ashamed. Wait, no. Ashamed wan't the right word. He was far from ashamed. He wished he could stop hiding everything away. Afraid was the right word. He was afraid that his friends would be ashamed. But that was a stupid fear. Obviously Hermione and Ron wouldn't be ashamed.
"I mean that this curse- this bloody curse- slowly kills the victim. Once inflicted upon the person, they gradually become weaker. The closer to their death day, the weaker they get. The victim will know the exact date they will die. The curse implants that date into their mind, always reminding them of what's to come- I'm going to have this dread of death until it happens." Malfoy looked into the air a pained expression on his face.
"Nice one!" Sirius said, eyeing Draco with surprise. Sirius ran over to Draco.
Harry nodded.
"Because I have a reputation, Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Anyways you should get to your dormitory, its late. I'll meet you at lunch at that weird twisty tree we met by the other day - the one by the lake. And forget about the curse rubbish, well work on research another day. I'd like to make sure Professor Snape doesn't give you trouble."
"I've screwed up, Harry." Ron gulped, staring down at his water. "She's not going to speak to me for for at least a week!"
"I'm not as... strong as I used to be. I get too exhausted too quickly. I figured it would be better for the team if they found someone else." Draco explained.
"Come on Harry, do you really have that little faith in us? Two against one. And I caught him by surprise." Draco told him.
They passed the Gryffindor announcement board and Draco stopped in his tracks, horror lined in his face.
"I told you that this forest was fucking forbidden for a reason." Draco looked at him with frustration and fear.
"God, Potter, don't tell me you haven't started it yet!"
Harry smiled back.
"I'm not leaving you here."
Yes, that
Draco realized and tried to give Harry his scarf back.
He couldn't. He couldn't bare the thought of Voldemort or The Malfoy family knowing. Lucius Malfoy, who he had seen with cold eyes, looking at him through the Death Eater mask. A shiver ran down his spine.
" Hermione, you're the best witch I know. Look at him, he's looking so much better now. You've saved him." Harry smiled at her. Hermione gave him a small smile back.
"Alright, Alright." Draco huffed. They faced Hagrid again.
The air was fresh and cool and the forbidden forest sang to him.
"Why do you have him here?" Draco asked. Him? Harry looked at the mound again, trying to figure out what Draco was seeing.
Harry shook his head. "Malfoy hasn't died. He told me the date that he's supposedly going to die is implanted in his head by the curse and he told me it's July 31st, 1996."
Malfoy picked up a rock and through it into the lake with force.
"I'm sorry." Draco whispered. Harry felt panic rise in his throat.
"Do me a favour and put him in front of a mirror when he wakes up." Ron chuckled. Harry smiled.
"Well inside there was shelves full of orbs. The entire room was full of them." Harry told him.
people get abandoned by people they trusted!" Draco raised his voice and he aimed his wand at Harry, shooting several jets of red light at Harry, who put up a shield charm.
"You're an idiot for that."
"It smells like old socks and sweat."
And then it was just Harry and Draco. Harry carried him back up the stairs. The large window of the room was open. The night was clear. They lay in the bed together, facing each other, holding each others hand for comfort.
"Nah."
"Actually the Sorting Hat nearly sorted me in Slytherin." Harry informed him.
"I'm done- I'm just done." He said in anger, but distraught coloured his tone. He put his face in his hands with a deep breath.
Harry realized the friendship he had with Draco was special and he wanted focus on it for as long as he could. He wanted to laugh with him, to talk to him, to know him, before it ended up being  too late and Draco was gone.
"Well, It's true." Draco pointed out. Harry raised an eyebrown and Hermione kept her stare. "My apologies, though. Continue." Draco added.
"If you leave, yes."
"Where have you been Harry?"
"Disgrace to Slytherin, this is." Draco sneered at his robes, unhappy that he was being forced to wear the Gryffindor colours once more.
Harry was trying his hardest though but he was so distracted from everything that'd happened in the past few days that he kept on grabbing the wrong ingredients and stirring the potion in the wrong direction. Hermione would notice and try to correct him, but she had to work on her own potion and he did it too often for her to correct him.
Harry taught the D.A. some new defense spells. As they were grouped up to practice, Harry walked the room, actively avoiding Draco, who was partnered with Neville, for as long as he could.
Harry didn't know what to say, what to do. He just did what he thought would keep Draco away. And it worked.
will not favour the consequences."
"We support every decision you make. If you've thought through this and think it's something that should happen, then we'll help and support you with it." Hermione told him. Ron nodded at her words.
"Fair point..."
And the three of them went off to their dormitories, with frowns across all their faces.
"I love you." Harry said. Draco gave a small gasp and Harry felt panic in his throat.
"Ah can I have a kiss before you do?" Draco asked. Harry smiled and gave Draco a quick kiss before heading down the stairs.
As Harry lingered on these thoughts, Umbridge took notice that Harry had stopped writing and was only staring out of the window.
"If this is about that bloody giant," Draco yelled, "I swear to god-!"
Harry ran further. He was almost to the door. But Draco suddenly collapsed. His ankle. Draco motioned for Harry to go.
"Hello Granger, Weasley." He nodded. Ron rolled his eyes.
"You need to meet with Granger?" Draco asked blankly.
"No, Harry. But, you can't deny that you're always try and be the hero. You're selfless. And Voldemort knows that. He could be trying to use that to his advantage." Hermione warned.
"Dumbledore wanted you to clear your mind for a reason!" Said Hermione shrilly. "You shouldn't be letting him in your head. It could be a trap!"
"My safety doesn't matter, alright. I will find a way to make sure you're safe over the summer." Harry said intently.
"Yes, we know, but could you maybe just promise one thing?" Hermione asked  him.
"I know." Harry said quietly.
Then, he came. He walked between them, and they stopped duelling. It was Dumbledore. He wasn't calm when he looked to Draco. He was fuming.
"I'm such an idiot..."
"Oh. That's too bad." Harry looked down.
"He's a drunk."
"Pretend to capture me, Draco." Harry insisted urgently.
"Here. Take this for tonight. So you don't get caught in the halls after curfew." Harry said, handing Draco his Invisibility Cloak.
"No, keep it."
"Knock some sense into yourself if that hasn't already." She insisted and stormed back off into the Girls dormitory.
" That's a good list - and if you keep thinking of things to add, keep adding. If you do something on the list, cross it off. And if you end up not achieving some of the things on the list, then that's alright cause not everyone achieve what they want to in life and that's okay."
Draco's smile quickly faltered.
"Well I mean, while everyone's at the game would you like to hang out?" Draco asked hopefully.
Hermione's eyes narrowed at him.
When they finally arrived at Hagrid's hut, Harry exhaustedly knocked on the door. Harry could hear Fang barking inside and Hagrid telling him to hush. The door clicked open and Hagrid stood there, towering over them, a warm smile on his face.
Hermione hugged him.
"Hermione, the answer is
Harry's eyes widen as he quickly shook his head.
"Those points were totally unfair." Draco pouted, arms crossed. "Just because our headmaster was previously a Gryffindor does not give him the right to add an over abundance of points. Makes him no better than Snape. Anyways Slytherin won the house cup this year, so."
"His name 's Grawp." Hagrid said proudly. "He doesn' speak English too well but I've been tryin' yer teach him."
"I got sick at lunch, sir." Harry replied. His palms were sweaty. He looked around the room, trying to avoid eye contact.
"Well..." Hermione slid the paper to him. His heart stopped. The front showed a photograph of him in Hogsmeade, kissing Draco in the snow, a view of the shreaking shack in the background. All you could see of Draco was his brown hair and the Gryffindor scarf. But Harry's face was in clear view. Harry remembered the rustling they heard in the trees and he suddenly felt stupid. He looked down to the article, a sense of dread in his stomach.
"No!" Bellatrix cried out. " We need to protect the Prophecy! We mustn't hurt Potter until we have it!"
Draco nodded unsurely.
Harry leaned back in bed with a sigh. He could tell this would only be the start of nightmares to come.
"I don't want a fight." Harry said firmly.
Lord Voldemort sent curses flying Dumbledore's direction. But Dumbledore sent curses back to Voldemort. The structures the spells had hit were in ruins. But then, the fireplaces lit up emerald green. Witches and Wizards were arriving to the Ministry for work.
As they continued though, Harry noticed that Malfoy's tense and angry demeanor seemed to fade slowly into a sad expression as the hour went by. Harry didn't comment on it.
Harry gave him a confused smile.
On the floor, in front of the veil, was Draco, thrashing. A Death Eater cackled as he kept his wand on Draco pointed to Draco. In shock, Harry dropped the Prophecy in his hands, the glass crashing to the ground. The Death Eater looked up at him, anger and shock flooding his expression. Wisps of air came up from the smashed orb, but Harry could not make out any words above Draco's screams.
"You haven't seen the Prophet yet, have you?" Hermione held the paper in her hand, a weary expression on her face. Harry froze.
Draco's breathing steadied. Draco didn't snore though. He just drifted easily; peacefully.
"If you do it now you can get it over with..." Harry advised him. Draco looked down at the beans reluctantly, and took a deep breath.
They were silent before Harry decided to bring up a lighter topic.
Malfoy didn't say anything in response. He just opened the book again with hesitation and continued to scan through the pages.
"You've tied him up." Said Hermione shrilly. Harry noticed the rope tied around Grawp's ankle.
"There isn't one." Draco told him firmly. "Anyways, we've stopped looking. There's no point."
Harry chuckled. He half expected Draco to run off. But Draco just looked curiously into Harry's eyes.
Harry nodded. "Thank you, Luna. Now, I'm going to ask him to come out now. Please, just. Give him a chance? He wants to apologize."
"That means alot to me, Hermione." Harry thanked her.
"What's going on?"
"That Oaf?" Draco sneered. Harry scolded him.
"So you're saying we should just sit here while Sirius gets killed-"
"Fair point..."
"Lay with me, Potter." Draco grumbled. Harry gave an amused smile.
"I'll always be with you. I promise."
"And the book of Death, well, I burned it. And they don't know where it's gone. That's probably how the book ended up at Hogwarts." Harry thought over. "But what was his plan?"
"Ditto." Draco laughed. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, honestly."
"I'm fine- I just need to step out for a second... I left something in the common room." Harry said and quickly left the great hall.
"Not so fast, Potter. Not only was I the one who asked you on this date, but I was the one who brought you to this coffee shop. It's only fitting that
." Draco said, not grasping what Harry was saying. Harry gave him a small smile.
They were silent for a few seconds before Harry spoke.
He nervously moved his hand on impulse towards Draco's. To his surprise Draco moved his hand closer to Harry's as well and lay his on top of Harry's softly. Draco didn't stray his eyes from the view in front of him, he only smiled and gave a soft chuckle.
Harry put his words into consideration. " I think everyone has a chance in their lives to live. I just don't think a lot of people take it. Or understand it. People put off things they want to do for so long, until it's too late " Harry replied thoughtfully. " I think of takes understanding that there's no point to putting things off. You just have to do it."
Draco got up and reached out his hand to help Harry up. Harry took his hand.
"So, who
"Fireplace." Said Harry.
"I've just been trying to figure things out through this whole curse mess." Harry said defensively.
The first face Harry saw was Sirius'. He felt surprise. But he also felt remorse. He shouldn't be here. This was Harry's fault. Had he been more thorough, like Hermione suggested, they wouldn't be here.
"Yes."
"I think its time for us to go to sleep. We can figure out what to do with the book in the morning." Ron yawned.
"Hey- stop that. Her
"Do you have a death wish?" Draco asked incredulously. "Because if you go alone, you will die. And I can't let that happen."
" Hermioned sighed in exasperation. "Well if you don't want to turn of in to Dumbledore and you don't want to be caught with it then maybe you'd be better off just burning it." Hermione eyed the warm fire burning in the fireplace in front of them.
Draco crossed his arms. "Fine."
"It's a long story, can we come inside?"
He began to topple over and Harry was quick to cast a cushioning charm. The Gryffindor's around them were either laughing or annoyed. Harry ignored them and solely tended to Draco.
"One moment." He said before grabbing his bag and searching through it. He pulled out a quill, ink, and a note book and flipped to a blank page. He wrote "Bucket List." At the top of it. Harry found himself wishing he could have the ability to write as neatly as he did.
Harry was relieved that Umbridge gave no hint of suspicion towards Draco. But he also knew that he'd have to be more careful.
Harry dueled with the Death Eater. Spells were shot in every direction. Finally Harry was able to stun him, after the Death Eater's spell came dangerously close to his head.
"How long have you known? About my feelings for him?" Harry asked desperately. Was it really that obvious?
"Why don't you go first?" Ron snorted. Harry elbowed him in the ribs, and Ron hit him back in protest.
"Yeah Grawp-y, Draco!" Said Hagrid, pleased.
"Thanks, Harry."
"Is it really?"
"What happened?" Ron asked as Harry sat down in a comfy chair beside them. He told them a very  basic outline of everything, leaving out the kiss.
Zacharias looked at her like he was going to say something, but stopped himself and stayed silent. He stayed where he was, an awkward expression on his face.
"I suppose you're right..."
Why should I waste my life away, running from death, when i could just enjoy the time I'm lucky enough to have?"
"That's true."
"Fizzing Whizbee." Umbridge said sweetly, leading Harry to the chaos.
Harry walked through the empty halls towards the common room. His wand was radiating light, and as he strolled the paintings complained loudly. He was exhausted from Snape's detention and he had more detentions with Umbridge to look forward to for the next week.
Ron and Hermione talked to Draco a lot too. Trying to bring up lighthearted conversations like quidditch. Small talk mostly. To get their minds off the dread.
"Ron's right." Hermione agreed. Harry sighed.
"This is beautiful." Draco said, looking at the water. Harry didn't look out into the water. He looked at Draco's awed expression, looking out at the view. He looked at his silver eyes that seemed to sparkle in the sunlight.
He paused before replying to Harry.
"His Dad's a Death Eater!" Fred chimed in
"But I asked
Harry just stared, unsure of what to say.
the best house. Gryffindor is."
"What happened?" Harry asked. Draco gave him a pained expression. Harry's heart dropped.
"You snuck a prefect into the Common Room! And on top of that, you didn't even try to stop him from getting drunk and attracting the attention of everyone in the room! As if they might not wonder why no one recognizes him as a Gryffindor. Or might recognize him as the Slytherin Seeker. Or the Slytherin who made the buttons last year. Or the Slytherin who created 'Weasley is our king'."
"You can. This summer. We'll find somewhere to stay, far away from any cities. Somewhere open and free. Where we can be together and not have to worry about anything." Harry promised.
"Er..." Harry looked to Hermione warily. Hermione glared at Ron.
"Malfoy is slowly dying." Hermione whispered with wide eyes.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Harry said, his voice wavy.
"Well I mean, if she said it's important I reckon we'd better go." Draco chuckled. Harry was relieved Draco wasn't upset. "What time did she say?"
worse than death, you fool."
"Ah, but Mr. Baker, I've changed my ways." Rita said sweetly. Draco crossed his arms and shook his head in disbelief.
"Sirius Black? The escaped convict?" Draco asked. Harry realized he had yet to explain to Draco about his godfather.
Hagrid had a bloody nose and scratches all over his face.
"I thought you said it was complicated." Said Ron and Hermione glared at him.
"Great I get to join you on this saving people thing." Said Draco. Harry rolled his eyes and Draco snickered.
Draco paused to look at Harry's face, with solemn eyes.
"Shit." Harry muttered suddenly. Draco looked at him with a confused and concerned expression.
Draco apparently liked to read a lot, which didn't really surprise Harry considering Draco was a very scholarly-type person. He was top of his classes, second to only Hermione. But he also liked the fact that Draco liked to draw.
By morning Draco was assigned part of Umbridge's "Inquisitorial Squad". He bore a silver badge on his chest to prove it.
The three of them were silent for a few minutes, thinking, until Ron broke the silence.
Harry laughed as he read through the list.
"Leave." Draco said quietly. Harry couldn't will himself to walk away.
"He's being tortured as we talk, Hermione. No one from the Order is left at Hogwarts. We need to help him!"
A different hissing voice cut in.
Ron choked in the middle of drinking his pumpkin juice. Hermione rolled her eyes at him before she continued.
"Fuck your father. He's a trash person. After the school year ends you'll never have to see him again, mark my words."
"I dunno. Probably not." Harry shrugged. "Do you want to go to Madame Pomfrey's?"
." He muttered, pointing his wand at them, and he put them on. He looked around. His heart skipped a beat.
to have a boyfriend. Literally your personal life has nothing to do with them!" Ron ranted. "Why are people getting so upset about another person's love life?"
Harry awoke to a Golden light. His eyes focused. He recognised it as the fountain at the Ministry of Magic. But it was blurry. Where were his glasses?
"I think Umbridge suspects that I have the book. She's got a close eye on me. If she- If she finds out you're friends with me, you'll be done for. If she finds out, so does your dad, and so does Voldemort." He told him panicky.
"You can't go after her now. She's far from here" Draco said calmly.
"It most certainly is
"Oh, very well, dear. Thank you." Mrs. Weasley gave a warm smile. "I brought you two some home cooked food for dinner. I'm afraid I can't stay for long- the Order's scheduled a meeting today so more people should be popping in shortly."
. I accept I am going to die,  like everyone else will. The only difference is that my date is sooner. And it knowing it makes me finally ready to live."
"It's really not that big a deal..." Harry said quietly.
Ron! That was the most foolish thing you both have ever done. Actually I can name worse, but nevermind that. That was the worst. You two do realize that we have O.W.Ls to study for? We don't have time for that nonsense!"
"Who cares what people think? It doesn't matter if people know I'm dating a guy. Anyone already thinks I'm insane anyways, thanks to the Daily Prophet." Harry shrugged. "Just enjoy yourself. I love you, okay?" Harry coaxed. Draco began to slightly relax.
Harry recounted Voldemort's return. Cedric's death. He answered the questions she asked. Draco listened intently as well, hearing what actually happened for the first time. It didn't take as long as Harry had expected.
"Do you think that there's any health risks that could come from doing that? I mean, I have a set date, I'd love to last long enough to reach it " Draco asked him, his face paler than usual.
"I-" Draco started, ruffling Harry's hair up. "-Am completely in love."  He told him with a sure smile. "With you I mean." Draco added, concerned he had not understood. Harry chuckled.
"Can't. I've got detention with Umbridge for a week."
"Harry. He's after me. The Dark Lord. He's trying to get to me." Draco said.
"Oh good! We need to show this to Dumbledore immediately!" Hermione reached for the book.
"You're soul is beautiful too." Harry told him gently. Draco smiled back sadly.
"No goodbyes. I never want to say goodbye to you." Draco told him.
"In case the alcohol doesn't do the job, we can't have him recognize that Draco doesn't belong here." Hermione explained, as though it should've been obvious. Harry began to wonder how long the party had lasted.
"You could get yourself into a whole lot of trouble. Regarding this curse business.." He looked at him with a sad expression. "And I don't just mean legally."
He waited anxiously for Draco, and when he saw him, relief melted inside him.
"I'm sorry, I just got caught up in myself. I didn't think!" Ron pleaded to the closed door. It stayed silent and shut.  For the rest of the night, Ron didn't talk to anyone and only drank water. He lingered by the food, with a grimace that made no one want to approach him.
" The Prophecy." Bellatrix whispered. Her expression became desperate. "Give it here, Draco, you silly little boy." She tried to come closer to him, to grab it.
Rita squinted at them, adjusting her glasses. A sly smile spread across her face as she came to a conclusion.
Harry reluctantly stood up to face Dumbledore. But suddenly Harry felt a white-hot pain running through his scar. He felt dizzy with pain and he collapsed to the floor.
"You hate me Potter, it's not hard to figure out. How could you not? I know you'll be happy once I'm finally out of your hair."
"What curse should I cast on you now?" The Slytherin asked himself. His voice was husky and deep. "I think the Cruciatus curse would be fitting."
"Er... this way." Harry muttered, recounting in his head his visit with Mr. Weasley for the hearing, and the corridor from his visions.
As Harry looked down longingly at the Quidditch field, he noticed Malfoy's light hair zooming around. He realized that he no longer considered Malfoy as an enemy. He could even be a friend at this point. But Harry didn't know. Malfoy might be more of an acquaintance.
"Oh. Well Happy birthday to you, guess your wish will come true."
Her sunken eyes widened with shock.
"Not to remove him from the D.A." Harry said quickly. "Just as a precaution..."
"Oh, but in the
"You looked like you were having a bloody seizure, Potter. And you look like you're going to be sick."
" Malfoy yelled. "He told me that Muggleborns are thieves of magic. He told me Muggleborns shouldn't be
"It's alright, Harry." Luna told him. "Everyone does it anyways. He's only afraid that Draco Malfoy'll betray us. But he doesn't have to be, because Draco's being genuine. I can tell."
"Oh yeah he's pissed off." Ron informed him. "Absolutely livid. I reckon the bloke who did that is gonna feel sorry after Malfoy gets to him."
"Yeah well did you fight off Voldemort in first year? Those points were well deserved."
One morning as Harry was getting a glass of water, he could've sworn he saw something flicker in the empty fireplace. He knelt down and stared at it suspiciously. After a minute of nothing, Harry decided it had been a trick of the light. But then he fell backwards when the fireplace became engulfed in blue flames. The flames quickly vanished.
"She suspects the D.A.. If she even suspects Draco-"
Harry finished it with a confused look on his face. There was nothing more about the spell in the book, only the incantation. It gave no information on how to cast it, and it gave no clear information on what exactly the spell was meant to do. Harry would probably have to take it back to Hermione to decipher.
Draco walked into the Office, clutching Hermione. Behind him came the burly Slytherin Harry had faced in the bathroom, clutching Ron. The slytherin's jaw was bruised and his eye blackened. Someone that made him seem even more threatening to Harry.
Bellatrix shot a spell at him. In his attempt to dodge it, he collapsed to the floor.
"Yes. Don't mention it." She mumbled awkwardly and shuffled out of the broom closet. It wasn't as cramped but he and Draco were still
Harry walked around more, and he noticed Draco nearly had it. He came up from behind, gently placing his hands on Draco's shoulders.
Draco sighed.
"So tomorrow is the quidditch game. Gryffindor against Slytherin." Harry said casually. "You nervous?" He asked with a chuckle.
"Do you hate
"We need to talk..." He motioned to the common room. The pair of them crept past the bunks, down the stair case, taking a seat in the comfy chairs.
"If want me to leave... I'll give you space." Harry told him.
"I never expected... to have so many friends." Draco said softly to Harry, looking to Ron, Hermione, Luna. Even the twins and Ginny.
"Crucio."
"That's- actually a really good idea." Draco looked with surprised. "Why didn't I think of that?"
Harry knew Umbridge would direct her attention to Harry, who she most likely suspected was the reason behind the disappearance of the book. If she saw the friendliness between him and Draco... Harry shuddered. He couldn't let anything else happen to him.
"You've been so brave." Harry said to him, Draco held Harry's hand, grasping it tightly, his fingers still cold.
"Life without love is worse than death will ever be."
"You still justify Dumbledore's unfairness. Because it's
"We don't know if he's actually there, that's my point!" Hermione yelled. She paused, collecting herself. "If you can prove that Sirius isn't at Grimmuald Place, then I swear I'll help you. I'll go to the Ministry with you. I swear." Hermione promised.
"Your hair looks quite well." Harry told him, raising an eyebrow. His blond hair was more ruffled and unkept. It was unusual for Draco, who usually kept his hair neat and well trimmed, but Harry secretly thought it was hot.
to attend Hogwarts!" Malfoy picked up another rock and through it directly onto the ground and it bounced towards the lake.
"Ok look, I was eleven first of all. And you'd just insulted my friend and his family. And I'd just been told that 'not a single witch or wizard who went bad wasn't in Slytherin'. Second of all, Slytherin is
!" Draco's face was red and frustrated. "Why has Granger brought that awful woman here, has she gone mad?"
"Alright..." Draco walked over and sat in the last empty seat.
"I mean his dad's a Death Eater, he probably learned loads of stuff about the dark arts from him. I mean have you even met Malfoy, he's down at Knockturn Ally every Tuesday, I swear." Ron reminded her.
They exited the store, Harry trying to steer Draco away from stealing any sweets.
"Fine, fine." He concluded. He didn't want to argue with Draco anymore. It only showed him how much Draco had decided to give up; how soon Draco would be gone.
"Harry Potter," Draco gave him a charming smile. "We meet again."
"Thank you." Draco politely nodded to Hagrid as he walked. Hagrid gave him a surprised smile and returned the nod before closing the door behind them.
"But Hagrid's our friend." Said Harry. Hermione nodded.
The giant seemed to pay no mind to Hagrid, grabbing at the trees that
Suddenly, Malfoy slammed his book shut with anger, giving Harry a fright.
81...82....
Harry had small hope that maybe he'll find a counter curse before he ran out of time. But that hope was continuing to diminish. Harry found it hard to stay positive.
"See you later."
"Not as much as you do."
"Oh good you're up." She came over to him. "Does anything still hurt?" She asked him.
Sirius muttered the spell. The bones in Draco's ankle cracked.
He did exactly what Draco insisted he do. He lied. And with that, Dumbledore managed to save all their asses. But now Dumbledore was no longer at Hogwarts. That was the price payed. He was gone.
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked him, surprised.
"Yeah. A date."
agrees with. He ensured to make that clear at a very young age. His way
"That doesn't make stealing less wrong."
"But,Harry, he hurt you." Draco said
"I have Draco with me." Harry would say. Harry knew that if she could have a say, she would bring him back to the burrow in an instant.
"Now that that's settled." Harry said to the group. "We should, er,  get some things done... I think there's a particular spell you should all learn, because I think it's quite important, in my opinion..."
"You dreamt it?"
Malfoy looked at him with blank confusion for a few short seconds before beginning with a new sentence.
"Er....well when I went to the restricted section in the library last night, I found the book."
Harry felt upset and angry as he began to realize the way Malfoy treated him throughout the years wasn't his fault. It was his fathers.
Harry sat in the soft grass beneath a twisty, tall tree.  He leaned against the trunk, with his eyes closed and glasses crooked. There was several books surrounding him, and a book in his lap.
Friday afternoon, Harry returned to Umbridge's office. As soon as he walked through the door, Umbridge handed him the quill with an overly-sweet smile spread across her toad-like face.
"Do you think you could take Draco's name off the contract for the D.A.?
"Bloody hell, Potter. What were you thinking?." He whispered frustratedly.
"That's what I thought, Mr. Potter. After all, we only have a few hours left left before the message sinks in."
Sirius ran into the room, a large gash on his forehead. Blood was dripping down his face. He looked at Draco with worry, and pointed his wand at him, deeply concentrating. He muttered a few spells and a few minutes later, Draco stopped thrashing. He just lay there unconscious. Harry looked at Sirius in panic.
Tears rolled down Harry's cheeks as he looked for words.
"There. Now, whenever he runs out, the bowl will refill, as long as there's enough food in the bag." Hermione said. Ron looked at her amazed.
"But Hermione, what if the counter curse is right here and we end up destroyed our only way to stop Malfoy from
"You deserve love." Harry told him. "And the brightest souls attract the most love."
"Nope." He agreed. "So let me tell you this. My man, my main man." He started, that charming smile on his face again. Harry at him, knowing a different kind of magic made him feel so... dazzled. Was that the right word? Harry couldn't think of a better word to describe it.
They walked through Hogsmeade together, holding each other's hand. Harry half dared someone to say something, half was afraid of someone saying something. Thankfully, they went unnoticed except for a few passerbyers who looked curiously at them, and one person who just glared.
"Do you two even realize how risky that was? You're a
"So there's a new member in the DA, whom I thought I should talk to you about." Harry cleared his throat. Everyone looked around the room to see if they could find this new person.
"I'll go and close it again. It'll only take a second."
They pulled apart and Harry brushed his thumb against Draco's cheek. He never wanted to loose him. Draco, an artist. Making art with his words, with his hands, with his voice. Draco so who was so strong. So charming to everyone. So genuine with Harry. So Brave.
Draco looked at him in the eyes, and nodded.
Harry yanked the curtain in front of the portrait closed. Silence filled the air. He travelled back up the staircase to Draco's room.
Malfoy said as he read through the last words.
He looked up at Harry, tears running down from his eyes.
"Fuck, I love you." Harry grinned. And Draco's face lit up.
"What if you get caught?"
"If you're fine, then go ahead and walk down those stairs by yourself without Harry's help." Hermione challenged.
In the room was a door that emitted light from the bottom crack. His palms were sweaty and his heart was racing. He heard voices coming from the other side.
Harry's scar seared as he awoke, like fire burning through the shape of lightning. Drenched in sweat, he sat up, grabbing his glasses.
Malfoy's words echoed throughout his head, the same thing over and over again. He couldn't escape the ice in Malfoy's voice, no matter how far he tried to run away from it, no matter where he went. They were still clear and loud as ever.
He had told Hermione about his vision, and as he'd expected, she tried to persuade him to go to Dumbledore. Harry told her he would, although he knew he wouldn't.
"There is no fucking counter curse! We've researched for
He put his head in his hands and he couldn't control the sobs. Hermione came beside him and hugged him. Tears ran down her cheeks too.
"So I assume I drunk more than I should've." said Draco, yawning.
"Jesus Christ, Potter. Don't you ever listen?! I told you. We're working on your essay. Forget about the curse for today."
He silently slipped into the library. He held his breath as he opened and closed the big wooden door. The familiar musty smell of old books hit him, which calmed him the tiniest bit.
Harry became uneasy. If Sirius was here shouldn't Harry be able to hear him? Unless...
Harry's eyes widened as Malfoy continued with his next sentence.
"W-what do you mean sentenced to d-death?" Harry sputtered.
"He wants to apologize to everyone. I really think this could end up with him on a better foot with nearly everyone." Harry told her. Hermione gave him a reluctant nod. Ron only snorted.
Harry hesitated before he spoke. "Malfoy...Are you okay?" Harry asked quietly. Malfoy only looked up and give a deep sigh. Pain shown in his silver eyes.
After Snape had walked away Hermione and Ron looked at him sympathetically. Harry sighed.
clears things up." Draco said sarcastically, waving his arms about.
"Well what are you waiting for?" Harry asked eagerly. "Let's make it." Hermione frowned.
Mrs. Weasley's visits became less frequent and the Order was having problems with the ministry.
"Is it true that the guy did that to you because of what the Prophet said about you?" Ron asked.
"We could use the Floo Network." Hermione said suddenly. "Umbridge's fireplace is connected. She hasn't been gone for long we could get through before anyone realises. Her fireplace isn't monitored either."
"Good. He should." Hermione said, before quickly changing the subject back to Draco.
"No. You have more."
Harry approached Snape's desk grudgingly. Snape looked up at Harry with his cold black eyes.
Harry shrugged those feelings off like sand being brushed off of his shoulders. He walked towards the fire, and after taking a breath, he threw the book into the fire. The fire grew and  became a bright burst of teal for a second before slowly fading back orange and dying down to it's regular size.
The sun was up and shining and it was a beautiful day. But Harry was exhausted, and all day he'd been struggling to stay awake in his classes.
"Definitely." Harry grinned. It was Draco's turn to lead him. They walked for a few minutes, before Draco stopped them in front of a shabby, small place. It looked old, with tinted windows. the metal sign was bent and shook with every cool gust of wind.
Draco didn't back away from her. He simply smirked and held up the glass orb.
"Oh." Draco said thoughtfully, "Interesting. Can you help me write one?"
"Wow, Harry..." Draco said as they were outside of the pub. "I knew terrible stuff happened that night, but I hadn't expected it to be so...so...." He was lost for words for a second. "That sounded absolutely terrible. Fucking epic, but absolutely terrible."
Umbridge glanced over at Harry's dripping hand and nodded in satisfaction. "Very well then, Mr. Potter. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow evening. Hurry along."
Draco looked directly at Harry, a smile playing on his lips. Harry's heart beat faster.
"Ah, Potter. You know me so well. I would. But that's different."
"I know."
"Okay..." Hermione said with uncertainty.
"No- I should go-"  Harry began.
"I'm not going to do that!" Draco argued.
"Harry. As long as whomever you choose to be in a relationship with isn't abusive or hurtful towards you, I wouldn't care. You can love anyone you want, I wouldn't have a problem with it. You have the right to love a guy, a girl, someone who's neither, even multiple people at once if that's what you choose. I will never be upset or angry. As long as they don't hurt you." Hermione's speach made Harry's heart warm closer to her.
"Harry... will you please tell me what's going on between you and Draco?" She asked quietly as they looked through their textbooks.
Draco started to stir and Harry closed his eyes in relief. He helped Draco up to his feet. Draco looked shaken, yet determined.
Harry hesitated. "I'm frustrated at myself." Harry admitted. "I should've been able to defend myself."
"Where'd you learn to do that?" Ron asked.
"No- you're not"
"Thanks." Harry gave a slight smile. He still felt a weight on his chest.
"Draco..?"
"God, Malfoy, why are you like this? I need to get to class."
"People never really do."
"What do you mean?" Harry asked quietly.
"When do you think you'll be able to meet up again?" Harry asked him.
"I don't want to talk about the curse anymore! You could be focusing your time on better things, instead of obsessing over this stupid curse! Maybe, I want to talk to you about things other than that blasted curse. Maybe, I don't want everyone to get their hopes up before it all gets torn away from them! I hate the fucking thing, I hate talking about it!" Draco's voice raised. But Hermione didn't back down.
"I- I" Malfoy looked at Harry's emerald eyes and sighed. He closed the book.
"No it's not, but thanks for saying it."
It's obvious"
"Yeah I did." Draco nodded. "It was fucking terrifying." Harry laughed.
"I'm kiddin, I'm kiddin. But I have ter say, this was the leas' likely frien'ship I imagined "
Snape has made no sign of recognition. When he left, Umbridge was becoming desperate to get answers out of Harry. To the point where she threatened him with the Cruciatus Curse.
"How have your Holidays been?" Harry asked. Draco snorted.
"I understand, I've been a horrid person. I understand that you guys won't trust me right away, and that some of  you might never trust me. I'm only asking for a chance. I really am sorry. Sorry to all of you. I'm sorry for the insults, for treating you cruelly, for judging you based on the purity of your blood and the amount of money you own." Draco looked at Ron for a second. Ron gave him a nod.
"We'll just. Take off from the Hogwarts express. Before anyone notices we'll just board a muggle train and leave." Harry said, imagining the fantasy, wishing desperately and hopelessly for that dream to become reality.
"I hate the person I've been. I hate myself for everything, but it had become second nature to me, and It was so hard to break out of it. I'll try my hardest though, for as long as I live, to be a kinder person. To all of you, to everyone in the different houses, and to myself. Nothing can excuse myself for everything that I've done. I know that. I've been so cruel. So if you never forgive me, I wouldn't blame you. But, please, give me a chance to redeem myself at least."
"Maybe he doesn't know kindness. Maybe that's why he did that." Harry said. Draco was lost for words. He just sat there and thought for a moment.
Harry waited for Draco after potions class, pretending he needed to talk to Snape. It was the last class of the day and students rushed out of the day, all except Draco who was the last person done with his potion that day. Harry found that odd, considering Draco usually finished his potion the same time as Hermione.
His honesty was brutal.  He looked anywhere but Sirius' eyes. He knew it was already too late for Harry. He was already too close to Draco, and there was no turning back.
"One more for the road?" Draco asked with pleading eyes. Harry brushed Draco's hair away from his eyes. He pressed his lips to Draco's once more. The same sparks. But it didn't last as long. He didn't want Draco to get in trouble.
"Thanks, Harry." Ron said.
They ordered a couple of coffees, and sat down at a table by the window, looking at the snow gently falling down.
Then he heard screeching again. Harry sighed.
" I love you more."
Harry quickly disarmed the Death Eater, sending him flying to the wall. A look of shock froze on the Death Eater's face before he dropped like a rag doll to the ground, unconscious.
The Three Broomsticks wasn't too far. They entered, and held eachother's hand as to not get separated in the crowd of people. They found Hermione sitting stiffly in the corner, already holding a Butterbeer, sitting across from a disheveled Rita Skeeter.
Umbridge was evil. Pure Evil.
Malfoy snickered in the corner of the room. Snape glanced at him for a second before turning back to Harry. Hermione was about to argue back but Ron motioned for her to sit down and shut up.
By the time he got there, though, the screaming had stopped and the curtains were already closed over the portrait. In front of the portrait was Mrs. Weasley accompanied by Ron and Hermione.
"That's because you're as clueless as Gilderoy Lockhart." Malfoy informed him.
"Of course."
"Isn't it?" Harry smirked and Draco rolled his eyes and sighed.
Harry looked at the three of them. There was no arguing against them. One against three was a hopeless battle.
"You don't know what it's like..."
By the end of the week, Hermione had managed to gather all the ingredients.
"Drink. You're probably dehydrated" Madam Pomfrey instructed. Harry chugged the cup of water, playing over in his mind what had happened. He gave a shiver that had nothing to do with him being cold.
"Exactly." Harry nodded. "So I thought to look in the Library for the book and, of course, I couldn't find it. So last night I ventured to the Restricted section."
"That's an understatement." Someone coughed. Draco refused to look awkward, and only continued talking.
"Please, Harry." Draco said quietly. "I can't stand not knowing."
"So Harry..." He muttered quietly, his voice almost a purr. "Now that I'm no longer drunk, can I have that kiss?"
Harry wanted to be cautious telling everyone about the new member of the DA because he knew their reactions wouldn't be good.
Harry was surprised to see Draco in the crowd of faces.
"Don't worry, we've been in the forest loads of times. As long as you're smart about your surroundings you should be fine." Harry reassured.
"Hold on. No." Harry said, processing what Draco was saying. " you can't go to the ministry with us! You'll get hurt-Voldemort- what if something happens to you?" Harry's words came out anxious and panicked.
"You want me to sneak you into a party in the Gryffindor common room?" Harry asked wearily.
Draco was across the room, knelt down, looking at Harry with panic in his eyes. Harry ran over to him.
He turned to Draco.
As the 31st  neared around the corner and Harry's panic grew. Time was going to fast and Harry yearned to slow it down.
"Don't tell me you're standing up for this woman's teaching methods, Christ Harry."
The plan followed through. Harry attempted to contact Sirius. But instead he found Kreature, who confirmed Harry's suspicion. Sirius was at the Ministry.
"Can I kiss you, Harry?" Draco asked. Harry nodded with a smile. As always those sparks were as strong as ever. Even though Draco was weak their connection burned strongly.
Harry looked up at him. "Do I think what hurts?"
"Hermione will probably ask you to sign a bunch of stuff for confidentiality and all, but uh you should meet me in the 7th floor corridor on Wednesday, after classes. We'll initiate  you into it. "
close.
"The spell could brake- if Draco says anything to Umbridge-"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione traveled to Hagrid's hut, which was now empty, for Hagrid was on the run. When they entered they were greeted with slobbery licks from Fang, Hagrid's dog. In the kitchen a bag of dog food was knocked over, and dog food was scattered everywhere.
"Hermione told me." Draco said quietly. Harry looked down to hide the tears welling up in his eyes.
him." Fred managed to say through their uncontrollable laughter.  Draco looked to Harry, an intense expression on his face.
They walked towards Hagrids, taking the long route, as to not be seen. Draco complained the entire time.
The Order has less frequent meetings. According to Mrs. Weasley, there wouldn't be another meeting for another week and a half.
. I will." Draco handed Ron the jar. Harry was suddenly filled with anxiety.
Five minutes later they were travelling through the stuffy passage to Honeydukes, the invisibility cloak in Harry's left hand.
But as he stared down at the field, eyes following the blond streak circling smoothly around the field, Harry began to wonder more about Malfoy. Harry had observed as Malfoy and him talked alone with each other, Malfoy became less of the awful person Harry made him out to be. Harry was curious about him. He was curious if Malfoy really meant everything he said to him in the past, or if it was just an act being performed for an audience that gave him no mercy.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" Harry asked, already putting toast on his plate.
Harry looked at Malfoy who had started to regain colour in his face and began to look more sprightly.
"Could you. Could you be more specific please."
"I didn't even drink Fire-Whiskey!" Harry argued defensively.
"If you throw up on the floor of Flitwik's classroom while he's out sick, then you'll get detention. So don't."
Draco, who was  dark-haired at that moment, was dressed in Gryffindor robes.
"He's just gathering his energy for when he has to leave." Harry said. They'd told her that Draco was scheduled to leave the country on the 31st, to go into hiding.
Harry wasn't sure what he was feeling. It was a complex mixture of warmth, emotion, and happiness. He didn't know how to put it into words, but he liked the emotion.
"Fair point." Harry sighed.
"Alright. I'll meet you there. I don't want anyone seeing us walking together in the hallways, because, well you know..." Draco shuffled his feet.
"I figured that Rita could interview you, about the night you saw V-voldemort return. To get the truth out there." Hermione explained.
"Potter you bloody idiot," Malfoy's voiced cracked, as he obviously was trying to hold back an abundance of emotion. "You- you've cursed me to a death sentence."
"My father says all muggles are
Draco gave him a slight smile.
Sparks. Everytime. Lighting an everburning fire between them that Harry knew would never die down.
"What's that?"
"We've got some methods , but I can't share them with you unless you join... Would you like to? Join, I mean." Harry asked him awkwardly. He was nervous to ask him, because he was a Slytherin and they had
Hagrid stopped suddenly stopped, motioning for them to be quiet. He slung out his crossbow and aimed towards the trees. There was rustling. Draco squeezed Harry's hand.
Harry went through a door they'd already marked, and set Draco down, kneeling beside him. They were the only ones there.
"He's
But Harry said nothing more to Hermione, who had let the subject go. Probably under the impression Harry had complied with her idea. Harry decided he would let her give him the sickles. But he wouldn't use them. He just wanted to avoid an argument that he knew Hermione would probably win.
"How the hell did you figure out this was here?" Draco asked, looking curiously around the passage. Harry pulled out the Maurauder's map.
"What?" Harry asked, caught off guard.
"No way, what happened?" Draco asked him.
"It's the safest place I could think of to talk." Harry explained.
Harry nodded. He knew that Draco would probably react like that.
"I know. But wouldn't have happened any other way. It had to be like this. It's sad but it's true. I'm just so glad I got the opportunity to get to know you. The real you." Harry gave him a soft smile.
Draco hurried his face into Harry's shirt again, keeping him close.
"Bet." Harry challenged.
"Nope. Slytherin."
"I can't do that I need to read through it and try to find a reversal of the curse!" Harry argued.
"Fine fine. We love each other the same amount."
He hated the Prophet. It was one thing to have the Prophet printing out fake stories about him.  It was different having such an intimate aspect of his personality being berated, so that he whole wizarding world could see. And this time, there was photographic proof. He couldn't just claim it was a lie. Not that anyone would believe him, even if there wasn't a photo.
Lucius looked to his son. Draco reached out for Harry's hand again. Harry grasped it. Draco was shaking.
"You're less safe." Hermione said, annoyed. "You know what I meant"
"Sure, Hagrid. We'll do that for you." Hermione smiled.
"I'll see you, Malfoy." Harry gave him a small wave.
This changed his plan. Anger and frustration surged through him. With a flick of his wand he channeled his emotions.
Before Harry could say anything, the door slung open but there was no one there. Draco appeared, uncovering himself from under Harry's Invisibility Cloak.
By the time Harry reached the common room, he still didn't know how he felt.
"But-!"
"Snape shouldn't give you any problems with this essay, seeing as I walked you through and proof read the entire thing. It has everything he asked for
"At least you've managed to remember that." Malfoy sighed.
Draco wasn't safe to go home any longer, so he came with Harry to Grimmuald Place. Harry had inherited Grimmuald place from Sirius. Harry was glad to be able to leave the Dursley's after only having to stay there for a week. He was especially glad to be able to spend all his time with Draco.
Draco said clearly. A silver Lion erupted from the end of Draco's wand, it's paws treaded silently on the floor. Bright and warm.
"Yeah." Harry said quietly. Ron turned red from anger.
Draco looked up warily at Grawp. The giant took a notice to Draco.
"Two Prefects. Drinking Fire whiskey
Harry's arm began to cramp up and little drops of dripped onto the nearly filled up parchment. It was now almost completely dark out, with the top of the sun peaking out on the horizon.
"Oh, do explain." Draco said, intrigued. Harry recounted everything that had happened.
Harry pulled Draco closer to him and Draco wrapped his arms around his neck. Their lips connected, and once again Harry felt  those brilliant sparks. Like what he drew from his wand, only it was like their souls intertwined. All Harry wanted was to be closer to Draco. Harry never imagined something could feel so gentle yet so feirce.
"Tripping Jinx. Very well done, Draco. 200 points to Slytherin." The malicious voice of Dolores Umbridge cried out behind them. Draco looked at him wide eyed before looking to Umbridge. His demeanour completely changed. He gripped Harry tighter and placed him in a choke hold.
"No, Harry. Promise me you'll take care of yourself." Draco said seriously.
"I'll be fine."
"Er okay... I'm not sure what I'd be able to help with though, I mean it'd be you're list." Harry told him.
"I'm sorry that happened to you." Draco said quietly.
"Don't worry, I'll talk to her." Harry assured. "But you should probably apologize, she'd take more consideration into that."
"Thank you, the food looks delicious." Draco said with a smile. He sure knew how to charm people.
" Draco gave him a mischievous look that made Harry mildly concerned, yet excited at the same time.
"Yeah, Of course."
"Yeah, of course. It's Valentine's day isn't it?"
Draco took his hands. His fingers were cold and Harry held them tightly.
"Lets go, Potter." Draco started off down the hall.
"Look at me in the eyes." He said seriously. Draco obeyed, tears threatening to spill out of his silver eyes, his face red.
"I'm not stupid, Harry. You haven't spoken to him in nearly a month and every time Ron and I bring him up you change the subject." Hermione pointed out. Harry knew he couldn't get around telling her.
"Wouldn't you like back up?" Draco had asked Umbridge before they left the office. "In case one of them tries anything?"
Draco played with Harry's hair and Harry closed his eyes.  Draco was gentle, and he hummed softly. Harry didn't recognise the tune.
"Obviously not, or else you would be paying attention in class, Potter. " Snape sneered. Harry stayed silent.
"They should." Draco said quietly. He hesitated. "For the first 11 years of your life, you weren't shown any kindness. Yet, you're still- wonderful. Your still selfless. Considerate. Maybe it's not the lack of kindness but the lack of  willingness to grow and learn."
Draco nodded, a smile on his face and looked out into the lake. Harry knew they should head back to the castle as the sun was beginning to set, yet he didn't want to. He just wanted to stay with with Draco. But then he remembered that his invisibility cloak was still in the common room, and it'd be more trouble then what it was worth to try and sneak around the school after curfew.
Harry looked at him. His pale skin looked almost silver in the moonlight.
In no time, Harry had already devised a plan with Ron, Hermione, Draco.
"You're not going to remember any of this conversation." Harry sighed. Draco laughed.
"You're work in class in the past week has been disastrous." Snape told Harry.
A surge of frustration and hurt filled Harry, and he threw the text book at the wall. Hermione jumped.
"There's a 99% chance that there is no cure to this vile curse. I just...I Just don't want to spend the remainder of my life working my arse off to find that one percent. I don't want to waste the rest of my life looking trying to get away from this when I could be doing things I've always wanted to do but never had the chance. When I could be spending the rest of my life actually
They worked all throughout lunch on the essay, perfecting it.
would." Harry teased.
Harry looked to Draco who was still in shock from the sudden water attack. Draco rubbed his forehead and groaned. Harry realized he was probably having a hangover. He remembered the sweets in his pocket.
Don't insult him like that!"
"Yeh see, he's my brother. Half brother I mean. He didn' really want ter come... but I couldn' jus' leave em there..."
out." Hermione blurted out.
"How'd you get in here?" Harry asked groggily. He reached for his glasses before he realized they were still on his face. He pushed them up.
"Midday I think..." Harry replied. Draco looked down at his watch.
"I'm fine." Draco would pass off.
"It's a potion.." Hermione said without taking her eyes off the page.
"Yes."
The book had the English translation for the Latin spell that he had had in his possession. He whispered the words softly as he read from the book.
"You should have just left him! If he wanted to stay."
"Draco, please." Said Harry. "Hagrid's our friend." Draco hesitated before sighing. He faced the giant again.
Mrs. Weasley brought a home baked vanilla cake.
"I don't know, Ron." Harry sighed. "But he's a prefect so he probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble for wandering the halls after curfew."
"Ah. See. That's a good question cause I seemed to have forgotten." Draco told him, deep in thought. Harry chuckled.
"What are you saying?" Draco asked him.
"God.. If my father-"
Harry stood up and cautiously looked into it. Laying in the ash was a book. And in the blink of an eye, it was open. Harry hastily picked it up and read inside it. His heart jumped.
"Has - has something else happened?" Harry asked him. Draco bowed his head.
"Fair point." Then Harry smiled. "I'm glad I fell in love with you."
"I'll see you later." Harry promised.
Harry writhed in pain.
Hermione looked at them with a bewildered expression.
They faced a huge mound of what looked like boulders and earth. Harry's heart raced, wondering what Hagrid had in store. Draco looked terrified as he stared at the mound. He grasped his hand tighter and moved closer to Harry. Hermione looked absolutely shellshocked.
The Gryffindor didn't argue, he simply leaned back down and shut his eyes. Hermione looked wary.
Harry pulled Draco into a tight hug, and they laughed.
"No, Potter. Hand it to me." A cold, angry voice pierced from the silence, startling them all. He looked up to face the livid face of Lucius Malfoy.
"Grawp-y, NO!" Hagrid scolded.
Harry spoke to Sirius upstairs, while he was feeding buckbeak. He shared his concern about the snake, and Sirius reassured him. But he also told him about Draco, not including the kiss.
"But Ron's playing!" Hermione argued.
"You should probably get some sleep." Harry advised, brushing Draco's ice-blond hair out of his face. Draco seemed to like when Harry messed with his hair.
A Death Eater cackled behind the threatening man. "Another traitor in the family, Lucius? Must be bad blood."  There were a couple of chuckles.
"Harry I don't think you should pick that up." Draco muttered uneasily.
Ron's eyes widened. "You wouldn't."
"You've done very well Draco. I'll take Potter from here. Go see if you can find more of them. Students who are out of breath. Check in the Library, the bathrooms." Umbridge directed.
" Hello Harry. Ron and I were just discussing the idiocy, riskiness, and foolishness of last night." Hermione said, her mouth forming a thin line. "Care to join us?"
"Who is this? I don't think I've seen him before." She didn't take her eyes off Draco.
" Hi Grawp." Draco said smally. Then, without warning, Grawp reached out and grabbed Draco in his hand. Draco screeched.
Harry was frozen. Time seemed to have stopped. Pain went through Harry like a knife in his heart.
The article, Hermione told him, was going to be published in the Quibbler.
Harry was in a bad mood for all of class. He messed up his potion and had to start over three times. Snape was especially upset at him today, and kept yelling at him to stop being stupid and pay attention to what he was doing.
"So we wanted to talk to you about something, Harry." Hermione told him as he ate his toast.
"Well I can't exactly explain to you-" Harry started but the room up-roared once again. But then Luna spoke, silencing everyone.
"Ah. My apologies. " He said sincerely. "I really am trying, though."
"Can you kiss me, Harry?" Draco asked softly. Harry hesitated.
"No... Please stay. You bring me back down to Earth." Draco told him.
"So...what exactly am I here for?" Harry asked.
"I've been researching more about the curse..." Hermione began.
"Thank you, Ron." Harry said genuinely. "For everything. For the support. And especially for helping me out with that Slytherin. You're a really great friend, you know."
"We should work on that essay Mcgonagall gave us..." He changed the subject.
"That is the complete opposite of how life works." Draco rolled his eyes.
?" Hermione said in quiet rage, a deadly look in her glare. She suddenly grabbed Ron's drink right out of his hand and splashed the contents in his face, making his red hair droop in front of his startled face.
"I actually wanted to talk to you about something as well." Harry informed her.
Harry was curious to see what Draco drew, though. If someone spends hours on doing something, then it's worth being seen.
When they travelled back, leaving Umbridge behind with the centaurs, they were greeted by Ron and Draco.
"What happened to protecting Draco and taking precautions." Hermione scolded.
"I'd like to see your Patronus again." Draco said distantly.
"How ambitious of you, golden boy." Malfoy huffed.
"Nonsense, Harry. 16 is a very important year. I'll bake a cake and I can invite a few of your friends over."
"Yeah Harry, why haven't you shown Dumbledore?"
"My son. Don't be ridiculous. Come with me. You will be rewarded for bringing Potter along. Come stand with me." Lucius held his hand out to his son.
He did not smile, for Lucius brought grim news as well.
"I'm not hungry."
As he walked he couldn't stop smiling. When he reached the common room he was surprised to see Ron up, talking to Hermione. It was now empty except for the two of them, and Harry presumed that the passed out Gryffindors had either gone to get breakfast or sauntered off to their dorm.
"Gryffindor is -!"
good job faking then. I mean his eyes turned red! And he's seems more ... I dunno... vulnerable if that's the right word." Harry replied
"Fine,
Harry met with Draco in the room of requirement after breakfast. He changed his robes and his hair colour. He didn't mess with the colour of his eyes though. Harry enjoyed looking into the misty silver, and no one was going to notice. Anyways, He didn't want to risk the spell going wrong and Draco going blind or something.
"Slytherin." Harry replied with a scoff.
"Out of favouritism!" Scoffed Draco. "We would've won if fucking Dumbledore hadn't cheated and given out last minute points. The banners were already up. We thought we had won. But GUESS NOT."
Draco scowled at him.
Draco leaned and pressed his mouth to his for a moment. Harry wished he didn't have to go. Then he remembered something. He reached over to his bag, which was difficult when one of his arms was in a sling.
"Yeah but it's generous of you to help me considering how mean i've been to you over the years...so...er... if you need help with your essay in Potion, then I can help you with it... Potions is my top class."
Malfoy held in a breath and breath and slowly exhaled and put his head in his hands.
Malfoy muttered under his breath as he read the text.
"I, Potter, happen to know quite a bit about this curse. " Malfoy said bitterly. " I know that it's called The Devil's Spell. I know that the first person to look at the caster in the eyes will fall victim to the curse. And I know that this damned book shouldn't even be at Hogwarts, not even in the restricted section."
"Malfoy, do you or do you not hate me?"
He remembered when Malfoy had first tried to be his friend. He had held out his hand, waiting for Harry to take it, and of course Harry didn't as he had just insulted Ron. Harry realized now that Malfoy had been like that because of what his father had told him.
Draco frowned. "You have to take care of yourself."
"Of course I am."
"A saving people thing?" Harry asked in disbelief. "Ron's Dad, Ginny, Cedric, Sirius..." Harry was becoming frustrated. "Are you saying that it's bad to try and help people? To save their life?"
"Malfoy. I don't hate you." Harry looked right into Malfoy's silver eyes as he said it.
"...Yeah, Harry... Friends." Draco said with a small smile on his face.
Harry was pleased that no one seemed to see through Draco's disguise. The lack of attention they got from people relaxed Draco. They were like a normal couple.
"Umbridge, she's sided with Voldemort. They planted the Book of Death at Hogwarts." Harry tried to explain.
"What?"
Harry stunned several of them, but they seemed to keep popping up.
As soon as he turned the corner he jumped. There was a person there. As soon as Harry gasped, the person turned around and walked towards him. They came into view. It was Malfoy.
"RUN, HARRY!" Draco gasped. Instead of the door, Harry ran to Draco and took him into his arms, carrying him out the door.
"Harry, we don't want to rush this. It looks complicated and we don't know what will actually happen if we give it to Draco."
"Looks like the house elf has done a good job. Maybe we should give him clothes" Malfoy laughed to Crabbe and Goyle as they left the room to get to their next class.
"It's - no one." Harry said quietly.
doesn't get away." Umbridge pointed a stubby finger at Ron, who was still struggling against the Slytherin. Basil was his name. Knowing the Sltherin's name didn't make Harry feel any different towards him. He was still the Slytherin that attacked him.
"Ah, he'll be fine." Draco shrugged, and looked to the fireplace.
"Well parts of it are foggy, but yes, I remember."
." The boy cackled and the wand flew out of his hand before he could disarm himself. He didn't dare move to grab it.
But did he really want that? Harry foresaw just an endless cycle of hurt. The Slytherin was wrong to do that to him. But was it any better to seek revenge? Instead of anger, he felt pity for the boy. He realised the Slytherin was probably hurting in his heart and in his soul. Sometimes the most insecure and broken people are the meanest.
" Harry, I can tell you're getting close to him. Don't let yourself get too close. It'll only be taken away from you in the end."
"I'm sorry, Harry. " Ron frowned. "Why haven't you told us? Who's the bloke?"
"But anyways, he decided he decided he'd try and eat an entire box of Bertie Bots Every Flavoured Beans in one go. And he downed the entire thing."
Now that Umbridge was at the school, he had to be weary of his surroundings and extra careful not to get caught. The ghosting pain from his last detention with that wretched woman still stung his hand.
Draco gave him a sly smile. "A party. Perfect. I wanna go."
Ron appeared through the fire next, looking dizzy.
Draco gave him a small smile.
But their time together always ended too soon, and when they were back in public, Harry was forced to endure the cruel mask Draco was required to wear.
"No, Harry." Draco put a hand on his shoulder. Harry looked at his surroundings again.
"Alright, Harry. Visit me again soon, will yeh?" Hagrid said, putting the mugs back.
Harry thought it best not to explain. Better for Draco. Safer. The less contact he had with Draco, the less suspicion Umbridge would have. His heart hurt, but he knew that if Draco and him talked about it, he'd end up changing Harry's mind. Harry knew that he couldn't face Draco.
"No, I mean that guy might be just the start. Do you even realise how many people read the
"Just give me a minute, ill be right there."
"Oh, like hell." Harry said, pushing the orb back into Draco's pocket. He slung Draco's arm over his shoulder, heaving him up.
"The only reason that Slytherin won this year was because Umbridge handed out points to Slytherin like candy and gave a handful if you the power to deduct points from other houses. That is the most unfair thing."
"Why should I?" Draco gave a laugh, brushing it off.
"Well Ron... it's a long story. He's not a Gryffindor... he was just wearing my scarf. And his hair was a different colour than usual. I- I'm dating Draco." Harry told him, looking around to make sure no one heard. The room was empty so of course no one heard.
"Er... Hermione. Can I ask a favor?"
"How many times do I have to say it? I've already got it set out for me. It doesn't matter what happens to me." Harry took in Draco's words but he wouldn't give in that easily.
So by his third potion, which exploded everywhere like it'd been put into a microwave, Snape stared at him with annoyance for a minute while the whole class was silent, before telling him that he was hopeless.
Draco finished vomiting and looked up from the bucket.
Ron would head off to start a diversion. Draco would go report it to Umbridge. Hermione would work to keep guard of the office while Harry spoke in the fireplace. Harry would use the knife Sirius had given him to unlock the door.
Harry longed to be down there, flying freely on his broom, rather than sitting in Umbridge's stuffy office that smelt like over sprayed perfume, carving letters into his hand. But instead, Harry had been banned for from playing Quidditch for the rest of his years at Hogwarts.
"Come on Harry. " Draco pleaded to him. Harry took his hand as Draco lead them out of the room. Before they closed the door, Hermione  marked the door, a red slash across it.
"Hm. Maybe."
"What do you mean?" Draco asked her.
"Well I found this spell translated into English. And i know it was a spell because I knew a few words in Latin because i had to study Latin in muggle school and i still remember a bit of it. And as I read it i kinda whispered it out loud. And after I read it i heard a noise and looked at the Marauder's Map and guess who had also decided to also pay a visit to the restricted section."
"There's not much we can do about that except be more careful about D.A. meetings and talking to Draco." She sighed.
"Ok, I was eleven! How was I supposed to know that Slytherin wasn't that bad! Anyways the Slytherin/ Gryffindor rivalry didn't help that. Also, Gryffindor is easily the best house, we've been over this." Harry argued. "Gryffindor won the house cup four years in a row!"
Hermione frowned.
"I hope I've made my point. Now leave." Snape motioned to the door, and Harry left immediately.
have-"
"I'm glad I got to know you both."
"Does it hurt still?"
" I-" Malfoy paused and changed what he was going to say.
Hermione and Ron faced him, frowns on their faces. They sat in the great hall for breakfast, waiting for mail.
Rage fuelled Harry to keep going. Love fuelled him. Pain fuelled him.
"What do you think I've been doing all day?"
"The only person I'll stand with is Potter." Malfoy spat before raising his wand to his father. Draco cast a stunning curse.
"Now enough pointless yapping. Let me see the book I told you to bring."
"Listen to me, Harry Potter. Lie. Don't tell her anything. Pretend you're completely ignorant about everything.
Draco ripped them from the board and pocketed them.
Draco frowned.
Now that the Room of Requirement had been discovered, they no longer had a secret meeting place. But thanks to Fred and George, they could manage to find time alone. The twins were determined to cause mayhem for the new Headmistress.
"Hagrid!" Cried Hermione. "Make him put Draco down!"
Harry didn't respond. How could that be true, after Harry had caused him so much misfortune. How could that be true when, the more he was around Harry, the more danger he was in. But oh, there was something in Draco's eyes that told him his words were sincere. Harry looked right into the silver, feeling closer to him.
By the time class was over, the room was scrubbed spotless of potion.
"Is it so wrong to want to try and help you?" Hermione argued.
"That's beautiful..." Harry said in awe. Draco gave Harry a slight crooked smile.
"There is
"My dear Lucius," his voiced peirced, cold and high, "Share with me your progress?"
"Hear what?" Ron asked. Harry signaled to the veil.
"What the HELL?!" Said Draco, his voice high pitched.
? He wondered to himself.
"Understandable. But what's this got to do with you turning on me with no explanation?" He asked politely.
"He didn't even want to come?" Draco asked faintly.
"Oh?"
"How?"
He was able to clear his negative thoughts and focus on the peaceful sounds of the nature around him.
"I wanted ter show yeh 'cause... well by the way things are lookin', I might have ter leave... and I wanted ter ask yeh if maybe yeh can look af'er him? Not feedin' him or nothin'. Jus' as company.

"Do you think it hurts." Draco asked him.
"You should head back to your common room...You'll get caught."
"Thank you." Harry said, looking solemn.
"I know that you... want to get revenge on the person who did this. I know you want to make them pay for it. But you shouldn't."

"The sooner you leave the less of a chance you have of getting caught. So lets get a move on!" Hermione led the way out, and when they passed the common room, they found a couple Gryffindors still passed out.
