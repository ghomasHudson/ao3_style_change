Suffolk wasn't a place that Harry was familiar with, but the growing wildlife was something that he could take a liking to. His black dress shoes crunched along the dirt path—it was charmed, that he was sure of, to keep the soil on the ground and not on the person.
Harry coughed, clearing his throat and gathering their attention, “The letter that the Ministry addressed to me is the reason for this session.” Their faces went blank. Harry was beginning to grow annoyed with their rudeness.
within the Auror Department, leaving behind whatever opinion his brain could muster up about the article.
Yet then they make do eye contact, and Harry begins paying for it with the look of coldness he gets. The accomplishment fades and there is a rising mortification settling in its place.
Harry blinks. “Fine.” He tilts his head around her shoulder to try and catch a glimpse of the nearest person scrambling down the stairs. “Er, Mrs. Weas—Molly, have you—!”
Deputy Warlock Trulock slammed down his wand, casting a Caterwauling Charm and causing the people inside the court to clutch their ears at the loud wailing his wand broadcasted.
The Burrow is a mess, redheads scurrying in and out of the makeshift home in bouts of chaos. He runs into Mrs. Weasley whose shaky fingers squeeze him into a tight hug.
Pressure prodded from behind his eyes, pulsing when Hermione slammed the book shut in frustration. His teeth clenched, eyes flicking closed as well, at the heaviness in his head.
“This… this is insanity!” Hermione throws down the papers, while Ginny continues to read hers in tight clenched hands. “This can’t be legal!”
There were three piles: Family, Press, and Official. It was rare to receive more than one letter in the Official pile per week. This week he received none.
“It’s not your fault, Harry.” She sets three different thick volumes on the table in front him. “Just… just try to speak to me about these things.”
A bloated, middle-aged man dressed in plum robes remained standing while the others sat. “The voting will now commence.” He sits back down, and another plum robed woman rises.
Mrs. Weasley pulls back at an abrupt speed. “Harry,” she says, hands caressing his cheeks, tired eyes checking him over. “It’s wrong of me to ask you this, but please do your best to watch over Ginny.”
“Yes, Granger, drinking games,” Parkinson’s red nails reflected on the Room of Requirements conjured lights when she tapped them on the table. The lights glimmered like a burning fire, though there was one near that lit up the multicolored chairs and seats. Parkinson’s was a black leather, Harry’s a soft, cushiony red, etc. It was comfortable enough—especially with the pale white walls and the dark brown rugs.
“You and Ron’s talking has been long since overdue, Harry,” she tells him, digging her spoon into her Raspberry and Chocolate flavored ice cream. “You never told me what you two were bickering about, but I’m glad it’s over.”
“I can’t—I can’t take it,” Harry shakes his head, pushing himself up to push the folder away. “Why do I get it? Why does it have to be me?”
When he saw him looking, his lips twitched as if contemplating on whether to forfeit the smugness and just smile (or sneer—he never knew with this man).
“Of course,” she responds, “This is our last chance to finish our education.” She goes on to prattle about the benefits of taking their N.E.W.T.s, and, for a second, Ron and him share a dry look.
“Even infants understand the effects of alcohol, Granger,” Malfoy grouses, all but rolling his eyes when Harry and Ron set their eyes upon him. All thoughts of being elsewhere with Malfoy vanished under the premise that the arsehole wasn’t supposed to talk bad about his friends. Nonetheless, he still found himself fancying just one friendless night in bed reading
Auror’s stopped him wondering when he was going to start his Auror training, it was the definite lesser evil.
There’s a second in that moment, where he thinks he might explode. Because he’s been trying. He’s trying, trying
He tells her that it's brilliant, because it is, but his eyes stray to the book in her hands like they always do. ‘How to Pinpoint a Psychopath’, the cover read.
There’s a guilty look on Harry's face, and it was there for the wrong reason. “You were, weren’t you, you cheeky bint!” Ron guffaws loud, rough when he reaches over it tap his shoulder. Harry flushes, ducking his head to watch as the bottle spun, because he wasn’t.
“Or do it the simple way and know her match earlier and be able to plan ahead,” he shrugged. “With all your complaining, you’d think we weren’t doing her a simple favor.”
He didn’t mind it though, because the elf’s presence was a comforting familiarity that he almost never got these days.
Maybe it was the way the stars had been aligned that very night. Maybe it was the way electricity bounced off of his fingertips as he spat out something rude—
“The letter.” Hermione slid an open notebook in front of him, still staring at him like a puzzle she couldn’t figure out. “The problem is that it all seems legal.”
“When did you even have time to do this stuff, Harry?” Lisa asks Harry, tilting her head as she sucks on her candy. Harry notes that they both have the same amount of candy left. “Like, I’ve never even heard you were in a relationship other than that Cho girl! But now I hear you’ve been doing loads of things like sex and—!” She has the same had candy wrappers as he had.
She’s too furious to put an end to her fire, which is why he doesn’t reject her demand that they go get scooped ice cream in Muggle London. She remembers his favorite flavor, Salted Caramel not Apple Crumble, and he remembers to give her his full attention. It’s not hard when she’s the only one trying to get it.
Outside his window pane, storm clouds were gathering in dark groups and migrating towards him in silence. He peered down at the large plant pot hanging in his hands. More water wouldn’t do for the furthering the health of his fiddle-leaf fig.
Someone’s blue rag is dangling above her head, threatening to fall any minute. He looks down from the rag to her hands that cover her face.
Upon closing his eyes and succumbing to sleep, he wonders if Ginny would ever speak to him again if hadn’t chosen her.
Two of the ten Aurors stood by the lifts drew their attention to him as he slinked closer. “Sir, we require a distance of 10 feet away from the lifts.” His words were resigned and weary, and he clenched at his wand as though awaiting Harry’s duel proposition.
“Merlin’s saggy balls, it was so awful,” Ron groaned, sliding his elbows off the table and letting his head fall onto the table in one fluid motion. “They hounded the wards for weeks. We couldn’t even leave the house without reporters three inches up our—!”
they'd told him. To destroy it, he would have to destroy the binds that sealed the contract. It couldn’t be spelled away. It couldn’t be removed by hand.
In the third year of his lower school, Harry liked to draw. He liked to draw so much, in fact, that his teacher suggested an art career pathway to Petunia and Vernon. This included paying extra for afterschool art classes.
Harry was astounded. Nixon Paris had to be a pureblood supremacist with the nonsense he was spouting. He looked over to the chamber door wondering if he and Hermione could change places. Perhaps she had the right words needed to deal with this maniac.
She drops her purse on the countertop, “The new law is legal—almost too legal. We’ll have to make a loophole ourselves then.” She hesitates in pulling out her books, looking up at him from her eyelashes. “Ron and I…”
Quidditch was a fast-paced sport, far too dangerous for anyone in their pregnancy or postpartum stages. Ginny would never be able to play even if they did get her a spot, because then there would be a child thrown into the situation.
Again, no one ventured into Hog’s Head. His eyes scanned the near-empty bar. No one except a head of red hair seated at a small circular wooden table that looked to be on its last breath.
“I is not liking the guest room curtains. I be tearing them down,” Kreacher grunts, sidling close to him, making his comment and then popping away when Harry begins opening his mouth.
“A godson, aye?” His hands snatch a medium sized stuffie from his own cart. “Give ‘em this.” He holds out a stuffed dragon—it’s purple, a pattern of green and yellow sitting beneath its underbelly.
His toast almost slides out of his mouth—what more did they want from him? Hadn’t he fulfilled his duties as Prime Wizard? They couldn’t ask anything else of him if they didn’t want to break all sorts of laws.
His feet dragged on the glossy cobblestone street path, quiet without the bustling buyers and locals that lived there. Most of them were doing their best to assist in the physical damage done to the castle.
Blaise Zabini had to take his shirt off, which earned him a few catcalls and wolf whistles. He made a show of it too, canting his hips and flexing his torso. Harry had eyes; he knew Zabini was attractive. But when he opened his eyes, all he saw was blonde hair and grey eyes and pale skin. It was no surprise that he found his gaze wandering behind Zabini instead of at him.
He went to sit next on Hermione’s right side, overlooking the empty chair and plate beside Ron. “Hey, there.” Ron stretches tight beside her, acknowledging Harry’s presence in a soft grunt.
Harry watched him wash his hands, not moving once to turn his attention away or even breath. His mind demanded his attention to each of his racing thoughts, yet all of them repeated one recurring theme: why was Malfoy here? Was he not serving house arrest?
He still had no clue as to how he found himself there that night. He knew that as a member of Hermione's well-mocked club, he had to attend. Harry found it hard to keep track of everything they spoke about when he spent the majority of his time dozing away on his comfy sofa.
“Harry, I’ve done all of the research that I can do; there’s nothing that can be done,” Hermione remarks, her gaze falling from his face to her hands. “We’ve all accepted that we don’t have much of a chance, and now it’s time for us to accept that you’ve been given a way out of this.”
This is why he begins unwrapping his candy, reddening when Hermione and Ron did as well. He hung his head when Malfoy started at his first piece too. No matter how many times the other told him otherwise, deep down Harry thought of himself as a whore. It did lessen everyday with his kisses—i’ll never let you go—and his touches. Because those were special; they were intimate and rare and they were Harry’s.
Except, there were two Unspeakables. Between their arms was a ragdoll like figure, dragged along in whatever top secret escapades Unspeakables kept themselves to.
A few people cheer the lantern on, and it radiates one last strong glow before it disappears within the opening. Harry sits back onto his seat, gripping the table as an anchor to keep himself reality.
“...accused of several accounts of alleged first degree murder, aiding and abetting terroristic acts, and Death Eater affiliation.” The Deputy Warlock halted in his reading to glance up over his square framed glasses and stare at Harry.
Chatter flooded the courtroom, accompanied by the greedy photographers, who’d begin flashing their cameras in his face and near blinding him. The leering newspaper columnists shouted questions, each trying to outshout the other in the hopes that he would answer the loudest.
“You naive little boy.” Nixon studied him for a while, but stamped over Harry’s venture to  vehemently defend himself. “Blood means everything in this world. Your muggleborn friend has filled your head with equity rot, and now you’ve both concluded that all wizards jump the same height.”
Hermione pushes back her dull hair, bloodshot eyes connecting to his red rimmed ones. “We’ve always gone through the craziest shit together, you know? Why would we be stupid enough to stop now?”
Why did they need his presence for a bloody marriage law? Harry freezes, toast in fact falling from his teeth at the horror mounting his heart.
Nixon shook his head, amused. “Potter, Ms. Weasley is a pureblooded woman, therefore she is required to either attend the wedlock ball and have a match raffled that’s been pre-produced given to her.”
Not that doing illegal activities had bothered them before but still. It was the thought that counted.
, will you? As of now, Harry and Ginny are considered one of the most influential couples in England.” Ron and Harry looked away from each other in their awkwardness to speed up the conversation.
After giving Ginny the ticket, she left without any delayal to get it registered. She was photographed coming from the Union with her accepted registration clutched to her chest in joy.
An old wizard with a faded brown goatee preached, uplifting the crowd's spirit. Four more voices joined into his chants.
—to shout, He could feel his eyes burning with tears and indignation, because he could taste the wheels cracking in his head. They were both breathing hard, and the crazed gaze she’d squired was gone. Now, panic was shown as he stumbled backwards into his chair.
“D'you think that’s why they pushed back the age deadline?” Ron mused, “It only passed Gin’s birthday by the skin of its teeth.”
There was a soft thud; Ron’s head was laying on the dull red cushions of the sofa behind him. “Anything else you wanna tell us? Something else you would never tell us under different circumstances?”
“That has nothing to do with this,” he groans, closing his eyes and ignoring her defensive mutterings that were mildly amusing to him now. “You only say that when you can’t think of a proper comeback.”
Harry’s grip on his wand loosens, knuckles jerky in the fast race to get to it. It was a letter from Ron. He vanishes the envelope, skimming down the small paragraph all while remembering Hermione’s request for a fire call.
Not in Malfoy’s bed though; not with a warm arm wound around his stomach. Warm, and oh-so (not) pleasurable.
There was chaos around him, but Harry found himself staring at the nose of the bottle in disbelief. It had to be an act of magic, he knew that. But who? He took a chance to glance up at Malfoy, only to find himself being stared at already.
What he could never bring himself to see was this disarray of order the war had caused. This shining fury had embedded itself, deep and shallow, into the chains of the Weasley family.
He took a deep breath. “Nothing, sir. The pass is mine, and… and this time it should go to me.” They assured him Ginny understood, that they’d already spoken to her. He focused on his hands, blinking hard and pushing away the thoughts.
The press at best wanted to be entertained to the maximum. His story, his thoughts, his legacy: simple gossip to be whispered on the sheets of magazines and newspapers.
“I doubt they have the means to,” he says, putting his glass down. “If they did, they’d make no mistake of doing it and coming out wrong.”
The frown on his face darkened, and he threw himself onto the bed tucked neatly in the corner of the room. He wondered if Mrs. Weasley would still speak to him if he hadn’t chosen Ginny.
What kind of question was that? Harry’s simple questions then seemed much too inadequate in a situation that was becoming much more complex. With self-consciousness in his cheeks, he tried not to make it obvious.
"Well. James can get a little overboard. So do not expect others will get the same reactions he had." Sirius explained.
"Well at least I'm not the one who still clings to Malfoy even though she's been dumped more than 20ish times." Ren shot back. Making the other girl's face redden with anger.
"Okay…" Tonks said as she moved again after two seconds. "This officially sucks!" She screamed. I really can't blame the girl; we've been stuck here for two hours straight. In this fucki'n thing called traffic. And aside from that, two more fucki'n thing happened. Number 1) it's hot, I mean out of the norm hot, even if the AC is on, it wasn't enough. 2) We are still four kilometers away from Hogwarts.
"Yes, is there a problem?" Hermoine asked. "We need ordinary students for this survey. And I already have both of you so, why look for someone else?" she explained.
"Because I WASN'T ABLE TO GET INTO HOGWARTS ACADEMY!" Harry shouted eyes closed afraid of what his godfather's reaction might be.
"I just wanna know my baby's condition… sorry for not calling in months… your stupid father took my phone away. Sooo I just bought a new one." I really can't help the smile that's tugging on my cheeks right now.
This made both of us panic. We hurriedly stood up, pick out clothes up from the ground and run for it…
"YOU!" Millicent said as she tried to wipe cream out of her face. "Both of you are going down!" She said as she ran with Pansy to the nearest bathroom.
"Do you think you can hide things from huh, Hanna? Or is that even your real name?" Draco said with a serious tone of voice, which made me swallow a bit.
"Now, now; let's stop the behavior shall we?" The councilor interrupted. "Tomorrow, your punishments will start. For now, you're all free to go."
There is only one thought that is swarmed around my mind this morning… that is "Did I suddenly grow another head, or what?"
"Okay." I replied, making him smile a real smile. I took a deep breath as he pushed his finger in and out of me until something happened. "What was that!?" I asked after I felt something inside me.
Now I'm really confused. I never thought that I'll ever wanna do this with a guy… never in my life have I thought that I might fell for a guy. And absolutely never did I think that I'd be willing to do this role for someone.
"We have to put a stop to whatever it is about that girl. First she refuses our offer of friendship, she went and befriended those freaks, and now she steals our prince!" Pansy said fuming with anger.
"Why would she want another meeting, a few minutes after we had the council assembly?" Blaise said as he passed his Nokia Lumia to Ron.
"Let's go." I said as I let him out first. After I locked up, we continued walking towards the elevator. "So where are we eating later?"
She just looked at me and smiled. "Will entrust me a secret of yours if I told you." I nodded. "He chooses crocodiles and grizzly bears over me." I tried not to laugh but failed horribly. I laughed out loud. "ha ha ha," She said. "And you?"
I imagined the heat of the water to be that of Draco's, while he's embracing me; while he's making me feel important and loved… making me feel the feeling that my own family refused to give me.
"I'm sorry!" I said as I help him up; and walked him towards my door. I opened the door for him and pushed him out. "I'm really sorry, but I'm not quite ready for that." I said looking at the floor. "Let's just continue the lessons tomorrow." I said as I closed the door in front of him.
"You're not getting away with the shoe issue." The shorter one, Faith, said. "Okay, we need to fix this hair of yours." She said as she touched my hair… and just to my luck, the fucking wig fell… making me blush like a tomato. "Or rather wig… Where did you buy this?"
"No, not really; 'coz if they let them go without properly training them and then something bad happens; they'll get all the blame." He explained, and then took another sip of his pineapple smoothie.
"Hey." She smiled at us. "I'm sorry about those two's behavior, I really don't know what their reason is but they're really hate the cross-dressers and their companions." She said.
"Why didn't you ask one of us? You know me, Ginny, Faith or Gray will be happy to come with you!" Hermoine said.
She's definitely got a HUGE appetite for a girl. Maybe to some guys it might be a turn off; but I actually like girls who eats Lunch, Dinner and breakfast without leaving a single grain of food behind.
The kiss was short, passionate yet chaste. There was nothing but love flowing around the air. The two people were just savoring each other's lips. Until the kiss ended.
"Oh, little brother… we're not doing it on purpose, we're just doing it to annoy you." Faith said as she walked to the room
"As ye're know, the business department will be with us for the year, or until they found a replacement." He explained. After that the Slytherins came inside and we started discussion. Luckily Draco Malfoy is the male freshmen representative, and the first class conflicted with the student council meeting, so he was excused from class. SAFE for today! But what about tomorrow? The whole year? The student council meetings were only held once a month, Man! I'm sure Sirius won't be happy if he heard that I only go to class once a month.
It felt a little weird as I felt Draco's finger inside me. I closed my eyes as I tried to hide the uncomfortable feeling which accompanied it. It wasn't really painful, but the feeling was so alien, that I almost pushed his hand away.
"Hi Babe…" Ron said as he turn around and kiss Blaise's cheeks. "Hannah dear has the same dilemma again."
"T-thanks." I said. "I'll get some water for this." I said as I took a cup noodle container from the sink and filled it with water. "Remind me to get a vase for this later."
"I see you're ready." Malfoy greeted me. And damn he looks really delicious in that black slim suit, and man! Some of his luscious fair skin is peeking from that unbuttoned beige under shirt, and that hair of his makes it even worse. I need to look away before my underwear becomes too tight.
"Then let's go to my room later, after this." He said before he pushed me off the ground, he smirked as he hovered above me. I stared at him; to be honest I really don't know what the hell is going on, until he kissed me. His lips were still as soft as the last time; the kiss was still sweet hot and passionate even though there is no tongue involved.
"You know them; you know them very well. And they want a certain girl out of their way." He said lighting a Marlboro. "The silly children even tried to persuade me to write a dismissal form for the poor girl." He said as he puffed smoke between some words. " If I were you I'll pull out their horns before they hit your property." He said going to the way his "Girlfriend" went, how ironic, the vice and the president together.
I walked a little further inside, and I saw something. A beautiful form was sitting beside the lake, her face looks a little troubled, and I can see that from a far, her bronze dress was bathe with moonlight, her deep raven hair was stunningly shiny, her face was illuminated and looked beautifully with that angle.
"Have you elected your muse?" Malfoy asked looking at Hermoine. She just shook her head as a response. "Then I think this one here would be a good candidate. He said as he turned around and started walking, Blaise following behind him, Hermoine stood up next, she smirked at me before following the others. And why the hell wouldn't she? I think I looked like a tomato! Draco fucki'n Malfoy just said I could be a candidate for our department's muse! Draco MALFOY! I know I probably look like a damn school girl right now, but who cares? Since I'm posing as a school girl anyway, why not embrace it?
"Because if we sent little, sweet Susan there again you might not come with her right away." Tom said. "Now just sit here and make a show."
"Oh dammit!" Sirius said as he shoots up from his bed. Then a loud "Bang" followed by the word "Dammit!" Was heard when Sirius fell hard from his bed. "Hide, hide, where to hide!" He said looking left and right, panic and fear clearly shown in his face.
So now I've made my decision. Since she already pass the test; and she definitely likes me. Why not take things to a whole new level. Why wait a whole lifetime, like a certain president for something that I can take now.
"What's with the face baby?" Blaise said grabbing Ron from behind, startling me and Hermoine. But Ron looked like he expected it.
"You'll still graduate, but they won't let you go. You'll get extra training. Then they'll test you again if you pass then you may go and leave. If you fail again then you'll stay and train until you get it right."
"Oh… but, isn't Durmstrang an all-male military academy?" I asked. From what I remember, DI values military arts on high standards that their graduates became reserve soldiers in case of war.
"Don't worry; even if they found out, you won't be expelled." Sirius shouted from the kitchen, making himself some coffee.
"You, called for us, ASAP you said, you made us run from the second floor to the fourth floor for this?" Harry said.
"Yeah right, we'll just go the mall and buy a new one… but we'll still fix that red weed." Fred said as he took his black metallic clutch from the sofa, and made his way out of the door.
Okay I admit it. The practice she made me does really pay off. The last time I wore clothes like these, it really felt so freaki'n uncomfortable. But now it feels like second nature.
"Mhmmm." Harry moaned as I kissed his neck, his weak spot. "Stop that!" He said trying to push me away.
"No, it's a little grotesque, but still acceptable." The taller one, Gray, said. "Actually, you can go on with your life without this."
"Okay…" Harry said, blushing; a he took Draco's hand. 'OMG!' He thought as Draco's other hand snaked around his waist; which made his heart beat faster. Making him beg to the heavens for Draco to not
"Well, that is what the word practice was created for… for the things that don't like you to turn around and love you. Or to make the things that loves you, love you even more." Draco explained as he sat on Harry's computer chair. 'That includes me.' He thought. "Now let's start dancing with classical music." He said as he held up a C.D. and strode towards Harry's C.D. Player.
"D-dray!" I screamed urging him, to slam in me more. He did so, making me scream more. "ple-please." I said as I reached out for my neglected member.
I tried calling Ron three times to make him come with me, but the line is always busy… and it only happens when he and his boyfriend do unspeakable (for me) stuffs with each other. Then I thought about calling Hermoine but I realized that she might still be away. So I just thought about touring the campus, even if I've been here for a month I still haven't seen everything. I put the ear phones on (playing If It's Love by Train) as I started walking towards the garden leading to a lake, I don't really know the lake's name at that moment, but I remember Ron said something about a beautiful lake in front of those trees.
"I'm just a messenger, why would you think I know?" He said as he turned around. "Don't just sit there, and stare. Get up." He hissed.
Right at this very moment a very angry woman, with brightly colored purple hair is stomping towards the Black Manor, followed by a worried, tall, brown haired man.
"I'm here to get you from that creature." He said pointing at Ron. "And I'm also here for this creature." He said pointing at Hermoine. "Didn't you get the emergency message from McGonagall?" He said waving his iPhone in the air. And just on cue, both Hermoine and Blaise took their phones out.
"We'll meet each other in the accessory department of the department store. We'll just have to take orders." George said.
"Yep, I've been here since Elementary school. Of course I knew!" He said as he sips from his iced tea. "It will be hard to adjust after graduation."
"Okay… by the way Hermoine might not come to class at all today." Ron stated as he took another sip.
"I will study as Hogwarts, one way or another. I'm going to show dad that I'm much better than he think I am." Harry replied with a serious facial expression.
"Ren!" Hermoine shouted, making me wince at the intensity of her voice. "Come with us." she said looking at me. She stood up and drags Ren with her towards the exit. We stopped in front of the Visual arts: Fashion Designs Club room. Hermoine just pushed the door open and threw Ren inside. Everyone stopped at what they were doing and stared at the red head on the floor "OUT!" She shouted and all the people inside ran to the exit leaving the designs and dress fitting unfinished.
"Well, quality and design is what our shop is known for." He said sipping his… you've guessed it… strawberry fruit shake.
"It's annoying really, that they scheduled this lousy secret meeting excuse for a party on my day off." He said without looking at me.
"That's my problem!" Ron shouted, waving his arms over his head. "Why is there even a stupid rule about cellphones in a meeting?"
Not notice two things… 1) his chest is hard and 2) His heart was beating at the minimum of 100 beats per minute.
"And I'm proud of them for that." He said with pride radiating from his smile; which made me smile in return.
"She's just the champion of last year's Liberty Shannah's summer marathon and triathlon." I just stared agape at him.
"I don't have any idea, but if she wants it that bad, the reason is 100% not good." Malfoy said. "Who is this?" He asked looking and pointing at me.
"And you'll both have a harder beating than Cho can give you." Tom said as he tried(in vain) to light a cigarette, only for it to be taken from him and thrown to the ground. "Noooo Smoking… I get it." He said as he faced the glare of Ms. Diggory.
Draco sighed. There really as no escaping Blaise when he had his head around something and maybe talking about it out loud would help things make sense. The blond took a seat on the foot of the bed, leaning against the heavy cherry footboard.
As the green light fell on them Draco felt a horrible tearing sensation in his back. He screamed out in pain.
Now more than ever he knew he had to destroy that thing. Not only was Voldemort using the weapon to destroy Hogwarts and all those it contained, he was killing his own Marked, and one of those was Severus. Paige's ward would only protect the man for so long, Harry had to get to that weapon and shut it down, destroy it if possible.
The hallway outside the Great Hall was empty, the students either at breakfast or still in their beds, and Harry stopped sharply, forcing Draco to stop as well.
But at the same time, could he trust Alex? Alex, Harry's boss, could have been trusted with the information but would never have asked. Alex the monster was an unknown quantity.
Alex, Harry's boss and the co-owner of the club, had left early. He didn't say where he was going, but the slight smile told Harry all he needed to know. Over the weeks Harry had been working at the club, he and Alex had become friendly and even though Harry had never met the one-eyed man's boyfriend, he knew the two were very much in love.
I hope the folks reading this story are enjoying it. I have, I believe, 40 chapters total. It's maybe 1 or 2 chapters shy of finished so fingers crossed by the time I get there I will have thise written
It couldn't be Draco. There was no way the Slytherin would set foot in a Muggle strip club, Harry couldn't imagine it, so it had to be someone else. And yet, Draco knew where Harry was.
When he turned, Harry met the familiar amber gaze of the dancer he'd seen the previous night. With a disarming smile, the man walked forward, hand outstretched.
When the food was gone, Severus gazed at Draco in silence, waiting. After a few moments, the boy began to squirm, cheeks pinking. Eventually, the young whitelighter broke. "I got upset. They were yelling, and I didn't do anything, it was Spike, and I couldn't handle it and I left."
Inside there was nothing. Well, not nothing. The cots and cabinets were in their normal locations. Nothing was disturbed, nothing was broken. There was no sign of the destruction Severus expected. He moved further into the room, but Harry was nowhere in sight.
Draco choked on his own spit, he was so enraged and shocked. After a few minutes of coughing, his eyes watering, he said, "No cause? I've no cause to be rude? My father just killed me. I am, in fact, dead. Formerly living. I am an ex-Draco."
When they entered the room, Harry let go of Draco's hand. He didn't really want to do it, liking he way the long cool fingers felt against his skin, but there were more important things to focus on.
As the man reached towards Harry's face, Draco used his grip on the Gryffindor to tug him closer to his side. Glaring at the tattooed bastard behind the counter, he said, "You know what love, let's go somewhere else. I don't think I like this place." the last words were spat out with sharp venom.
It had been three hours since Hermione sent the request. They didn't know exactly when Ron was injured, but all three of them knew time was running out. Neville had taken Harry aside when Hermione went to get ice and said that there was no way it was only a scratch. Ron was too sick for it to be anything but a bite, and if they didn't get the potion soon, Ron would be a werewolf for the rest of his life.
When he was discovered as a spy for the Light he came closer to death than ever before in his life, so close that the darkness was one breath away.
Harry tried to laugh, but it fell flat. "Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Death Eater torture is the same no matter where they go, I think it's in the handbook."
Paige felt the pink heat of a blush rise up on her face and she turned towards her sister who had been giggling the entire time in the hopes that Severus wouldn't notice.
The other woman took it and shook it once, firmly. "I'm Shannon." The woman, Shannon, looked Paige over curiously. "You're a whitelighter, aren't you."
His eyes widened at the sight. It was amazing. Courtiers danced with maids and the fine ladies of the court with footmen. Even Hagrid was there, nodding his head along with the music. And what music it was, filling the ballroom with longing notes, like hope and lost love. Before he knew what he was doing Draco was moving across the floor and towards the band.
Draco froze for a second, then began sawing again, frantic to get into the tent, to find the weapon, to stop whatever was going on in there.
Draco saw Paige walk into the room from the hall carrying two tote bags and a backpack and pulled away, wiping at his eyes and nose with the cuffs of his shirt.
Lucius looked up and saw Pomphrey, the nurse he had assigned to his son's care. To see her here brought into reality that this boy before, the image of his late queen, was their son, his son, and the last remnant of Narcissa on Earth.
And he was in complete and utter shock, his head spinning with what Ginny had told him only a week before.
Severus shook his head. He knew about Harry's Uncle and his childhood and while it was terrible it had no bearing on this situation. "You have had a week to wallow in the death of your love life, but we are in the middle of a war and there are far more important things to waste your energy on than pouting."
Harry smiled at his gobsmacked friends and followed. He knew where his priorities lay and he wanted to discuss their 'mutual circumstances' and 'agreeable solution' a bit more.
The man returned to his chair, next to the blond Slytherin, and Shannon looked at them both, a twisted smile on her face.
"I was unaware there were any other branches in the Black or Malfoy family trees, much less one named 'Spike.'"
It was one thing to fall in love with your childhood nemesis, and quite another to find out that the boy was your guardian angel.
Draco wasn't on the front steps where the two of them had been earlier, and Harry only hoped the blond man hadn't left the castle. Digging the Marauder's Map out of his robes, he tapped it and waited for his lovers name to appear.
The next day the kitchens were full of stories about the mysterious blond who had danced with the prince but Draco didn't hear any of them, too caught in his own daydreams and the rhythm of the turning spit.
"He's injured. Internal or something. He said it felt like a stab. I have to get out there and stop the weapon before it bring the entire castle down on us but I need you to watch over him."
Paige gently pulled his hand away. "I healed it for you when you came out of the room. Severus and I came to get you, he knew—or, rather, he thought that this would end badly, and I guess he was right."
That was broken by the sound of someone pounding on his doors. Severus stood up, setting his book on the coffee table and made his way to the door of his chambers. When he got there he disabled the wards and the pounding became louder without their muffling effect. He pulled the door open and stood as straight as he could, hoping the use every inch of his height to intimidate whomever was bothering him enough to send them away.
"No, I mean…," Paige saw tears build up in the brown eyes and looked for anyone who could help, but everyone had congregated around the black-haired man. The first tears fell as the boy said, "It's my fault. The accident. And now Severus is hurt, and the baby…," the boy trailed off as he gently rubbed his swollen belly. Paige looked closer and saw that the boy wasn't heavy all over, just his mid-section. He reminded her of Piper, when she was preg—
Draco saw the woman grin. "That's up to you, sweet heart," she said, pinching Harry's behind as she left the small room.
Harry thought he heard Snape's teeth grinding, and hoped neither man heard his own. Draco was his friend now, but that didn't mean that the way he side-stepped things had gotten any less irritating.
Unfortunately this gave the other two time to loop around and come in behind him and the next thing Harry knew he was being attacked on all four sides. Sheer panic bolstered his shields, but he knew that would only lat so long, and though the two injured Death Eaters were now weaker, Harry wasn't sure he would be able to defeat all four of them.
Neville shook his head. "It wasn't nothing. If it were nothing you would have come home right after, as it is you've been gone for almost a day. What happened?"
After Wyatt's birth and all of the birthing classes she had tended as part of her training as a social worker she knew the sound of that scream.
Harry opened his mouth, clamped it shut, then opened it again before releasing a ragged sob and sagging heavily against Severus's shoulder.
King Lucius called for the finest doctors in the kingdom and beyond, but they, in fear for their lives, refused to tell him his wife's true condition. As the kind and gentle Queen grew weaker, the King became angrier and angrier. Finally, he gathered the doctors together and demanded the truth from them. They all stood silent, but for one. The oldest and most venerable doctor had traveled from the neighboring Kingdom of Gryffindor at the King's request and he was a brave man. Stepping forward, Dumbledore finally spoke true words to the king. "You wife is dying. The child is taking her strength. There is nothing we can do." After a moment of silence, King Lucius howled his grief and rage. He had wished for a child, but not at this cost. Never at this cost.
But then a spark of guilt would flicker into existence inside him, for thinking of abandoning his five-year old child. Then the spark would catch fire on the dry, shriveling fragments of his shattered heart, and the guilt would burn and
. Life. Love. Home. Sanity. Draco. Harry kissed Draco's palms as his relieved tears made their way down his cheeks, he then leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco's gently, Draco's cheek warm and smooth against his, their noses bumping, Draco's soft, warm breaths whispering against Harry's lips.
Blaise Zabini outright laughed. Harry glared at him, only to find Zabini glaring back, an expression of pure disdain on his infuriatingly perfect features, he stared back at Harry like he was a disgusting, rotten, foul-smelling specimen he'd found stuck in the sole of his shoe, he wrinkled his nose, looked Harry up and down and apparently judged him undeserving of his self-worth-issues inducing glare, smirked and looked away.
Potter took a few tentative steps towards Draco. When Draco didn't say anything, he sat on the far edge of the bed from Draco. He picked at the collar of his dark, woolen sweater and seemingly giving himself an internal pep-talk and remembering he was a Gryffindork, he stood up, expression comically determined and sat right beside Draco on the bed. Draco turned his head to look at him, Potter did the same and realized their faces were very close - he blushed. Draco chuckled lightly.
, would probably look like him, have his green-eyes, his unruly hair...It's what all Harry had desired before he'd met Draco again.
Theodore Nott had never known anything but Heaven in his life. Harry didn't know which one of them had it worse. Théo'd always had Draco and always will. But adult Theo's Heaven wasn't the same as when he'd been a child. Théo had had a chance to leave his younger self's Heaven once but he'd missed it and now he was living in a Heaven that he'd long since grown out of. It was restricting him, paining him. It had become, on its own, his Hell. He was forever stuck on what might have been.
Harry was feverish for days after that. He'd slept in another bedroom and wouldn't let her in, saying he didn't want her to catch what was ailing him. Which was -
funny, until it wasn't. There was noway they could've known we'd end up like this. Me, in love with my dead wife, you, in love with my depressed ass."
He knew, Merlin, Harry knew, and hated it. Hated that instead of being angry and telling Draco to fuck off because Harry had had enough of manipulation and half-truths and people using him, "Merlin forgive me" Harry said instead and placed both his hands on Draco's waist.
"I wanted—I contemplated getting my hands on a time turner. Id fucking make one. Astoria would forgive me. She could never hate me. You know this, our love was the kind of love where you give
Draco's carelessly cruel words pushed Harry over the precipice he'd been on the verge of. The instable, thin ice he'd been standing on, shattered. He was plunged into freezing-cold unforgiving water, drowning, his mouth helplessly and involuntarily opening, foolishly expecting air but finding nothing but icy water, flooding his lungs, choking him, suffocating him, the instinct to inhale, to breathe, to survive, killing him. He was drowning, sinking down, because Draco would never love him. Harry had known it, yet it hurt so bad, it was killing him. Harry was like a mortal sailor who'd  been bewitched by a Siren, foregoing land out of love for a creature of the sea. But the Siren would never truly love him, and the sea was no place for a mortal. Yet the sailor loved the Siren so much, leaving would surely kill him just as staying would.
know that, but do they? Did people listen when you said Severus had been spying on The Dark Lord? Did they listen when you said that Dumbledore had been quietly premeditating The Dark Lords murder even before he'd risen? Did you hate it when they painted you as the chosen one when you knew nothing and only blindly did what you were told? Did you hate Dumbledore for planning his own fucking death? Didn't you feel like a pawn? Aren't you still a pawn? Don't you still feel like you're still led down a path other people made? Didn't you marry your own best friend's sister, the only other girl there was besides your other already taken best friend? A Weasley - the
In the middle of the night, waking up alone, Draco's side of the bed empty and unused, Astoria Malfoy thought that's how Draco was going to wake up when she was gone.
-"No. Not really. Theo adamantly refused, says we've been married since we were eight years old. So what's the point, you know? I kind of agree, even though Father doesn't. I mean, literally
he'd said came to him. Fuck! He frantically shoved those thoughts away and wished for lightning to strike him right then and there.
Today, thankfully, after they all had breakfast and fussed over Draco, Pansy left to wherever it is Ladies of Leisure who also happen to know many shameful, life-destroying secrets and work part-time at silly newspapers, go. While Greg went to help Narcissa with her flower gardens. Lucius retired to his extensive, giant library to potentially research the whereabouts of gay unicorns, or so Greg had insisted. So, only Theo came to see Draco and Scorpius off. Blaise too, since they essentially worked together.
Blaise was wearing his purple unspeakable uniform, that he so obviously, and effortlessly pulled off, for he was Blaise Fucking Zabini after all, no more explanations were needed.
But Harry's mind was on other matters. He couldn't believe how dumb and oblivious he'd been to not infer that they were together. But in his defense, he didn't think Malfoy would move on when its been only less than two months since his wife's passing. Maybe Malfoy had only married her to produce an heir and had been secretly in love with Nott since they were children. It didn't really matter. It was certainly shocking but still doesn't explain what's wrong with Malfoy.
Draco seriously considered then to refrain from ever calling her a cow, since she apparently wasn't bluffing and
He loved Draco. He loved him so, so, so, so, much, none of them—the Weasleys, Ron, Ginny, Hermione could ever fathom how much.
Draco didn't understand then, and would never understand, nor come to terms with the fact that the world hadn't ended when his did.
-"Why, Of course not, Draco, it was an impossible task to begin with. Potter has just been, regrettably, born this way. Nothing could be done."
Harry's knees were protesting from his kneeling position on the cold, hard floor. He reluctantly stood up, Draco's hand falling from his hair and sat down next to Draco. Harry tilted his head and watched Draco, reminiscing, wallowing in nostalgia and grief.
the time—practically lived with them, smiled and joked about the time we both fancied each other but stupidly thought the other didn't think of us that way—
-"WHAT! Oh. Oh, you're right, I'm sorry, this is ridiculous we don't live together. You're—yeah. Sorry. I just...This isn't easy." Harry stammered. His eyes downcast, he sighed miserably. He had to remind himself that Draco wasn't his.
-"Not really, we normally have breakfast around this time too, but everyone pulled an all-nighter yesterday so they're still sleeping." Draco said as Harry grabbed his hand and led him to the kitchen.
Outside, in the chilly early-evening weather, they stood side by side, facing the slowly setting sun. Harry silently mused that he might have thought it a beautiful thing to behold once, but he couldn't be sure, because Draco Malfoy was the embodiment of beauty. And Harry would never see him again.
-"Well, I'm not going either then. Will you come by tomorrow, please? I'll go out now, pick up a DVD-player since I don't have the internet and specifically ask for a movie starring Jack where he doesn't die in the end and buy it for us to watch tomorrow. How does that sound?"
He picked a random direction and ran, vision blurry, heart hammering, eyes wild with pure unadulterated fear, he scanned his surroundings as he ran, over and over again—
do such a thing to him. She'd never caused him pain deliberately. But what did it matter? Because he was feeling it anyways.
The moment Harry sees Draco, he sheds his self-control, dignity and principles like fucking snakeskin.
-"Fucking idiot," Draco said, Harry instead of taking umbrage to being called an idiot, felt happy to be mentioned at all.
, it would have been an extremely asinine and idiotic thing to do - choosing death when The Dark Lord would have simply forced and/or charmed other people to do his bidding.
I believe that you genuinely think my son doesn't care for you. I believe this letter might come as a shock. I believe you don't think yourself worthy of my son, or that you have any chance with him, for that matter. I believe you think—
Doesn't matter. Harry knew everything he needed. Draco was so pliant and vulnerable, post-mental-meltdown, that Harry felt a bit guilty for interrogating and getting answers from him when he'd otherwise sneer at Harry and leave. He also felt a maddening, overwhelming, intense
Draco, to Harry's surprise, smiled mockingly. Harry knew he was in love with an asshole so he really shouldn't have been surprised, he rolled his eyes and dug into his pie.
. In front of everyone. Harry was absolutely not prepared for this. He knew they were close, but not this fucking close, his blood boiled and he clenched his teeth hard to refrain from jumping in between them and demanding Nott stay the fuck away from Draco.
Harry hadn't seen or heard from him in two weeks. The last he'd seen of Draco, he'd seemed extremely distressed, like, really, really, heart-rendingly anguished. More than what was—sadly—the usual, and Harry's inference had been apparently on point since Draco hadn't been to work ever since.
Harry's heart missed a beat, and dangerous hope bloomed inside of him. His mood lifted considerably and a flare of joy surged up in his chest.
-"You said I was trying to garner sympathy using my little boy and dead wife." Malfoy deadpanned, flatly.
Draco smirked his signature smirk and disapparated before Harry could fruitlessly plead with him to stay some more.
But they did stare at each other; both, seemingly unaware of everyone else around them—there was no one but Harry, really, but still...Harry got the impression that they were so lost in each other's gazes, silently communicating or whatever the fuck they were doing, they wouldn't register it if Harry fucking dropped dead beside them, right that instant.
Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, along with Greg, appeared a moment later. Greg and Lucius shielded Draco, who was nothing but a heap of inconsolable grief on the floor, by their bodies so Scorpius wouldn't glimpse what had become of his once proud, strong and loving father. Narcissa coaxed Scorpius into looking at her, he turned his little, red, tear-stained face towards her, she whispered things to him that made him smile and reach for her, she moved him from Théo's embrace to her own, Lucius and Greg beside and behind her. They left quickly, Scorpius's giggle was the last thing Theo heard before he made himself really look at Draco.
Harry Potter stood up and made his way to The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Obviously not to see Malfoy or talk to him, or anything. He'd just go see Hermione, and his goddaughter Rose.
-"Now, now, children, Potter is our guest, we shan't accost him further. Let's sit down. What would you like to drink, dear?" Asked Narcissa.
Some of them were standing, the rest were seated. All of them, dispersed purposefully. Like actors in a play. Lucius Malfoy stood straight, utterly regal and irritatingly
they were in school. . . I mean Theodore never spoke much, and when he did, it was usually to Draco. Scorpius had mentioned that his Oncle Théo lives with them. Rose had also remarked on Draco's frankly exquisite hair and was told by Scorpius that his Oncle Théo brushed it for him—I could've sworn I saw Draco's cheeks turn a little bit pink. . . Anyways, they're sooooo dating, they're so sweeeeeet, I think Ron should definitely step up his game or I'm leaving him for Zabini or something. Slytherins care
He was feeling especially weak and tired anyways. Why not just go home and do nothing there? But he knew once he opened that door to himself he'd end up leaving early then earlier then skipping work altogether then working from home to from his room to never leaving bed ever again. Why was it such a bad idea again? He heard Scorpius's giggling from the room across and received his answer.
-"Ginny and I are hap—haven't been raised like you. We're not used to extravagant expenses. We're plenty confortable like this. It's not like I spend much time here anyways, or if pretty furniture could ever replace the absence of Sirius. In this house. In my life. Things would have been different, had he lived. I know it. We'd have lived together, been a family, caught up on all the time he'd been wrongfully imprisoned. Nothing ever goes right with me. I should be used to this. I don't know why it hurts, to know that you and I can never be."
So when Ginny had initiated intimacy between them, he'd gone along with it. But in the end, he'd finally gotten all the undeniable confirmation he'd ever need. Sex with Ginny had never been something frequently done, looked forward to, what with her constant traveling and Harry's presumed low sex-drive. It had almost felt like a chore. But with Harry's newfound, eye-opening attraction to Draco, and Draco's spot-on observations, and by consequent, revelations about Harry's life, last night had been awfully difficult to go through with.
-"Shut up. This makes me feel better. Leave me alone. No don't leave me alone. Why is this happening to me. Oh, Merlin. Zabini will be there—"
? I bet you hadn't thought about it twice since. You wouldn't be doing this whatever the fuck it is you're doing if you still thought I was a threat. So, am I supposed to be grateful now? Happy, that the great Harry Potter sees me worthy of basic fucking human decency at long last? Should I forgive you everything for deigning to talk to me? Am I obliged to accept your help simply because you offered? Do you believe I've changed instead of you being wrong? Well, Potter. I hadn't changed one bit. I'd do everything the same over again if I had to—Nah. . . You know what? I'd make sure
Harry would have felt offended or embarrassed or something that Nott would assume he knew two-shits about Harry, not to mention his dreams! But he didn't because Nott was fucking right.
Oh, Harry would ambush him when he's with his son! Preferably before lunch so Nott would have to wait. Harry smirked. Yeah, that would definitely work. Malfoy was a different person around his son, all smiles, pretty words and kindness.
Dinner was a quite affair, since it was apparently unseemly for people of their pure-breeding and wealth to speak and dine at the same time like uncouth gingers who fight rabbits for holes in the dirt to call dwellings. Per Lucius' words.
Théo came up behind Draco, and before He could turn, pressed a soft kiss to his neck and slid his hands around Draco's midsection.
and even Weaselbee once. It's still quite anticlimactic though. What a hopeless good for nothing bunch you are." He drawled.
sometimes he thought he really, really didn't deserve such a lovely child like Scorpius. He'd think himself utterly worthless and maybe Scorpius was better off without him. He'd think it was a win/win situation. Scorpius would get rid of a Father that was no longer a Father but a heavy burden of grief and pain. And Draco would be free. Free to be with her. Scorpius was a perfect child. Like his Mother.
-"I love you." He whispered, he couldn't not say it. He wanted to say it until Draco believed him, say it until Draco loved him back, say it until Draco was
But that was then, and this is now. And right now, Draco Malfoy was seemingly out of his own volition, from the shocked expression on his face, crying in front of his son.
Fuck. Harry's eyes widened, his entire chest area ached and felt uncomfortably hot, he brought his fist to his mouth and bit on it, breathing hard through his nose, he'd suspected as much but the prospect had made his heart seize
Greg would check up on them hours later, smile and take Scorpius to spend the night with his Grandparents.
-"Do you think we should have taken the easy way out and died instead of trying our hardest to survive and protect our own like your
The alley was empty, they'd already walked out. Harry darted across the street to catch up with them.
Harry sat down in the ugly excuse of a garden, that had none of Narcissa's beautiful flowers, and watched them stand, hug, call out for each other, shriek in glee, hug some more, talk, talk, talk, sit, eat, eat, sing, stand, hug, laugh, dance.
? Harry thought it might have started earlier, maybe when they first met at Madam Malkins all those years ago. But what was ‘
-"You can't be serious!" Harry said, the disbelief had vanished to leave place to a bottomless pit of hurt and despair. "You can't do this." He murmured, distraught.
-"Well, yes, for now, because Theo doesn't want to. Although, Father and I have high hopes we'd be married by early summer at the latest—"
The yearning brewing inside Harry wouldn't be quelled, even with Draco's dismissal and apathy towards him.
Draco's eyes, unsurprisingly were shiny; tears welled up in his eyes and steadily streamed down his pale, smooth cheeks, turning to Harry, Draco whimpered and buried his face in Harry's chest. Harry intrinsically enfolded him in his arms, and dragged him to his lap. Draco wrapped his own arms around his knees, and huddled closer, the top of his head tucked underneath Harry's chin. Harry held him like one would hold an ill, disheartened child.
Harry was going to be a Father. He was going to be a Father. Yes, a Father. Draco was a Father too and Harry loved him. But no, no, Harry was going to be a Father to a baby. And Harry had always wanted a family of his own, this child will be
-"Malfoy." Harry said. That was all he got. Damn it. Why the fuck did he come unprepared? What the fuck would he say to Malfoy? Why was he here? Why didn't he just ignore him, call 'mione and eat quietly and quickly? Fucking hell—
, really, to be let in. Lately, he just wanted to know if Draco was alright, whether he was still in England. But no one really gave a fuck about what Harry wanted or needed.
-"I want to," Harry choked on air. "But Theo doesn't; he says he doesn't want to replace her because no one can. It'd make him feel inadequate and somehow less. I don't know, they're both very disparate. Theo is Theo and Astoria is Astoria—what truly pains Theo, though, more than anything, more than his own pain and regret, is seeing
The sun was slowly descending which made the northern gardens even more gorgeous. Harry marveled briefly at how merely being in Draco's home worked better at improving his health and mood than all the medications he'd taken that morning.
Hadn't Dumbledore himself—from the countless memories extracted from Harry Potter—said that Draco's soul was untainted, that Draco was no murderer? Haven't we learned by now, not to doubt Albus Dumbledore? Haven't we all seen and heard from Harry Potter's own memories of the night Dumbledore had been killed, Draco's face, Draco's words, Draco's visible horror and fear and incapability to kill when he'd even successively disarmed his opponent? Hadn't Narcissa Malfoy lied to The Dark Lord's face, told him Potter was dead, actively insuring The Dark Lord's demise? Hadn't The Malfoys ran, unarmed in the middle of the battle of Hogwarts, helplessly shouting their son's name, stating their blatant disloyalty and disregard to anything and anyone but their son? I urge you again to remember that The Malfoys, did not know, nor believe that The Dark Lord was anything but invincible and unassailable. I am not saying they were loyal to the 'good' side all along. I am saying there was no 'good' side, nor a 'bad' side. It was war. It was The Dark Lord against the entire world. I am saying they were loyal to each other. The Malfoys loved and fought for each other. Isn't that what Severus Snape had done? Fought in honor of the woman he loved? Yet he's a tragic hero and The Malfoys aren't?
After dinner, Greg took Scorpius to bathe him. Theo and Draco excused themselves to go have their long overdue talk. Pansy and Blaise made to follow them. Draco sighed. They all needed to hear this. It was a good thing Greg was busy. Draco didn't want him to know anymore than he did his parents. Greg needed him to be strong for him. If nothing else, Draco could at least fucking pretend. He was good at pretending. They all were, but never with each other. It made him a little bit sick to lie to Greg—no one could fool Narcissa and Lucius—but he was
-"Morning." Draco mumbled, unpleasantly. He sneered at him and left before Harry could comment on the weather. Which was the next step. Dammit.
Draco smiled forlornly and apologetically at Theo. Draco knew what he was about to say would hurt Theo in particular really bad.
After settling Draco down on the bed and tucking him in, Theo sent a Patronus to Narcissa and went out by the hallway to wait for her and update her on what's happened. He didn't want to bother Draco or have him hear the pain and overwhelming concern in his Mother's voice. Obviously Theo wouldn't tell anyone about Emma but they needed to know Draco wasn't doing well, and that Draco would be staying at home, resting, that someone would need to take care of Scorpius, and talk to him, preferably Lucius, since Scorpius adored him and looked up to him so much, and that they can see Draco come morning if he was up to it.
-"Yes. I know. I'm fucking hungry, aren't you going to offer me anything?? So rude. You have no manners. Awful host."
Draco wasn't running aimlessly. No. He had a purpose, a direction, Astoria's grave. Because he needed to see it, he needed to fucking see where his wife was supposed to be, what she'd been reduced to. His wife, much, much, beloved wife was dead. Dead. Draco had just seen her a few months ago! He'd held her in his arms just a few months ago! She'd spoken to him, laughed with him, loved him just a short while ago. What the fuck was death supposed to mean? Where was she? How was any of this possible? The universe, God or Merlin or whatever—whoever the fuck was the almighty, all-seeing, ruler could not be as cruel as to take
-"And, Now. For what I've been dying to tell you all morning." She looked at Scorpius. "I have a three-year old daughter who'd be delighted to be your friend Scorpius! I've actually had the playroom made for her when she was just a baby. She'd love to come work with mommy again. Her name's Rose." Granger said gleefully.
apparated him in. Obviously they knew what the aftermath of being tortured by the Cruciatus looked like so they demanded Harry tell them who’d harmed him immediately so aurors would be dispatched - he refused, said he didn't remember, no he didn't want their help remembering, no he didn't know who it was, he didn't see anything, he didn't want to press charges, no he didn't want to call anyone, no he wasn't protecting anyone and if they didn't fuck off he would discharge himself and go overdose on muggle pain-killers at home. And then he remembered that he had no home anymore. But thankfully they let it go.
-"Shut up. Are you calling me a liar? Is that it? Do you hate me and want to cut off my hair? Are you working with Pansy?"
Harry Potter did not have any fucking hallways in common with Draco. He couldn't wave at him in the cafeteria. It has to be a hallway, and a morning so it would be a 'good morning' wave because why the bloody fuck would he wave at him at noon or something? That's a major I've-finally-fucking-lost-it red flag. He couldn't risk the head-auror offhandedly suggesting Harry take some time off now of all times.
she thought, Draco bitter and miserable in a world who couldn't care less. The world wouldn't stop when she dies, it would move on, the sun would rise and set, people would breathe, laugh, love and live. It would be the same to them. What was Astoria, but a droplet of water in the river of life? But she knew, her droplet was the
-"Merlin, Theo." Draco said jumping off the bed. "A month long trip! We need to go. Fucking hell. He just lost his mother—" Draco trailed off.
-"I'm here already, I'll take you home. My home. We can talk about this—" he angrily enunciated between clenched teeth.
-"We didn't fuck. What the hell!" Potter said in a hopeless attempt at brushing off his blush as a red face born out of anger and indignation.
him, but Harry - there's a very fine line between love and hatred, furthermore, the opposite of love (a very strong emotion) isn't hatred (an equally strong emotion) - it's
-"I'll poison them all! Lucy said they'd never venture past the southeastern gardens, that's the only reason they're still alive!"
bed! Do you want to talk about clingy and needy? Really? You literally flung the bathroom door while I was
Harry obviously couldn't risk calling, visiting or owling him, but if nothing else, he would make sure Ginny's pregnancy reaches the news. Draco would understand then that Harry meant it when he'd said he loved him and would always love him, and he would also understand why he couldn't be with him anymore, for Draco was a Father too.
Some time later, when Harry was dying of hypothermia, slowly loosing consciousness, Kreacher apprated in the middle of the bathroom, Harry didn't call him nor did he care that his unplanned but very-welcome suicide now had a witness—Kreacher wordlessly stopped the water's flow, levitated a seemingly lifeless Harry out of the shower-stall, single-handedly removed Harry's utterly soaked through clothes, dried him using magic and conjured up clean, dry clothes for him, Kreacher then dressed him and stared at Harry pityingly before disapparating.
love. Who wouldn't? But it wasn't the same thing. It would never be the same thing. But they'd made their promises when they were kids, and now, even as adults, they had to keep them.
Oh, yeah, because Draco, from time to time, after laughing at Harry, to his face, would be chuckling and watching Harry's reaction, his face, and Draco's derisive laughter would fade into a smirk that would sometimes, faced with Harry's own scarlet cheeks and scowl, turn into a little, soft smile that was only for Harry. It was an amused, marginally fond smile that was the last thing and the first thing on Harry's mind these days.
away from his son only for a handful of hours since earlier that day. But he was dying to see him already.
It was Christmas eve. They'd had a big dinner. Everyone came over, including Scorpius's maternal Grandparents and his Auntie Daphné.
fucking sweet it was, watching Nott and Draco steadily grow into the parents Scorpius deserves, after everything. Bulstrode had joined in and elaborately described the expensive, intricate jewelry Nott had bought for Draco who apparently loved everything from necklaces to earrings. Hermione the traitor had gushed about how superlatively endearing it was, to watch them interact together and be so
-"Yes, Scorpius is right. You'll have no choice but to sleep with me on the sofa, Draco. Come on, lets go out somewhere nice and have lunch."
-"The Dursleys? Ah, yes. You lived with those unseemly muggles. It was hilarious watching them drop you off at King's Cross Station every year."
Draco was suffering. He was a proud, self-indulgent man. He didn't feel contrite for what transpired during the war. Because he didn't have anything to feel remorseful about. Nothing to atone. He did what he had to do to keep himself, his mother and father alive. And he succeeded. Self-preservation was what Draco valued the most, he was a Slytherin after all. He didn't do self-flagellation, or self-loathing. He didn't like to suffer. Yet, he was suffering. But he didn't want to. Why wasn't death an option? Draco couldn't remember anymore. But there was nothing one can do with suffering except to suffer it.
'mione too." Harry said, grinning. And then the smile faded away from his face when Nott rushed to Draco's side and promptly pulled him in his arms, kissing the life out of him. On the
-"Draco! It's so good to see you. It's been such a long time. It's actually Granger-Weasley now. How are you?"
-"You're thinking too hard and it's getting too warm in here," Draco mumbled, voice muffled by Harry's neck.
Draco sighed and pushed his fingers between Harry's dark, tangled locks, he picked a random strand of Hair, tugged at it, wrapped it around his finger, tugged at it again, released it and moved to another. Harry nearly purred like a cat.
He watched as Draco closed his eyes and sighed in defeat, shuffled towards Nott and stood. His eyes, when he opened them, were brimming with tears, Nott visibly flinched like someone had tore off his nails. He smiled reassuringly at Draco and cupped his cheeks in both his hands gently like Draco might break if handled roughly, which they all knew, he would. Nott brushed off the tears as they fell down Draco's face.
note. The past two weeks had truly been dreadful. I felt like when I'd been on the run during the war, with a target on my head, except with so much more heartache and awful anxiety."
-"Why the fuck is Nott unhappy with Draco. He's got enough shit on his plate as it is. He should know better than to upset him further." He shouldered past Zabini in a hurry to get to Draco and check up on him, comfort and love him, be there for him.
He would wake up thinking of him, spend the day with him, sleep some nights beside him, dream about him, always him. Just,
His brows furrowed, lower-lip trembling, eyes brimming with tears, shocked, lost and everything in between.
-"What's wrong Potter, you've barely uttered two words. Had your speech-skills deserted you alongside your worth, after the war?" Parkison said.
. Never. I can never fully trust you. I hate it when I'm vulnerable with you, because you've seen me at my worse once, scared for my life, crying my eyes out, and you chose to nearly kill me. There's no going back from that."
-"—are in dire need of a potions-master. All the departments are currently suffering because of the considerable shortage we have. Overworked, underpaid, ministry officials are—"
it so well. Harry's heart hurt. His chest squeezed, enclosing on his heart painfully. He was having trouble remembering how to
Draco was relentless and succeeded in dragging her fully down. She kicked his shin from her position on the ground. It stung. Draco shouted obscenities at her, clutched his most likely broken shin, lost his balance and promptly fell atop her. She kneed him in the ribs, rolled them sideways and ended up sitting on top. Pansy, smirked like the evil witch that she is and pointed her wand at his throat—Only to find Draco's wand, already poking her own belly.
-"Why, yes, of course they do. I mean not really, they all have their houses but we've all lived with each other our entire lives, we like it better when we're all together. It really sucked to have Blaise in England when we'd all been together back in France. Well, Theo
After some time, Harry finally relaxed and accepted his impending doom, busying himself with covering every inch of bare skin on display with soft kisses, which wasn't much, just Draco's neck and hands since he would swat at Harry if he got too close to Draco's face when he was so utterly engrossed in the movie that was finally coming to an end. Harry had given up on it after he'd missed a good part of it throwing a pity-party. Kissing, touching, holding Draco was so much better anyways. Harry felt a teeny tiny bit bad since he was essentially taking advantage of Draco's distracted state and doing what he wanted when Draco was only half-aware of anything but the happenings of the movie. But then he remembered that Draco was a calculative, sharp-minded Slytherin and above all Lucius Malfoy's son and wouldn't be fooled or used by anyone let alone Harry, not in a million years. The thought made him smile and he leaned in to steal a lip-kiss because why the fuck not? He'd come to terms with the fact that he was a cheating bastard and he was going to divorce Ginny, and Draco was aware Harry loved him and he was here with Harry not with Nott, didn't that mean something?
After a while, he spoke, in a gentle, sad whisper, "I warn you, I'll break your heart." there was even a hint of disbelief in it, like Draco couldn't believe he was saying it, like he'd been on the receiving end of the same words before, like they meant so much to him. A painful memory, an echo of something that someone must've said to him once. It was a pointless warning or a hopeless supplication. Wishful thinking. Whoever'd said it to Draco had known it wouldn't change anything and so had Draco.
Hermione patted him on the arm reassuringly and linked her arm with his, her free hand holding Rose's and led them towards the cafeteria.
was what's wrong with him so they moved Ginny to the Burrow to be safe. Harry didn't care nor made a single effort to speak to any of them or even sit up in bed when spoken to beyond shaking his head furiously whenever someone brought up the hospital.
Would Lucius Malfoy's suicide—for saying no to The Dark Lord was nothing but an euphemistic way of saying one has a death wish— have saved any lives? Changed anything in the grand scheme of things? Absolutely not! Hadn't Lucius Malfoy known of The Dark Lord's immortality? He had. As evidenced by Bellatrix Lestrange's words upon her capture after The Dark Lord's fall in the first Wizarding world. they'd all known. The Dark Lord himself had expressed his disappointment at Lucius's blatant betrayal upon his return three years ago. Lucius Malfoy had known The Dark Lord wasn't dead. Weak, but never dead. Yet he'd turned his back on him, most death eaters had. Again, as evidenced by explicit assertions of multiple faithful Death-Eaters like Barty Crouch Junior. Lucius had become a father at the time, his son, Draco, was one year old at the time. He'd said the truth and been let out. He might not have been put under the Imperius curse, but The Dark Lord wouldn't have hesitated for a second to murder his family by way of punishment—Lucius Malfoy had been forced to serve all the same.
-"Salazar! Stop talking about 'communicating' and missing my mother when we all know you've a had a crush on her."
breath. It was always like this - breathing, every cell in his body would demand and protest vehemently for oxygen, yet still feel unsatisfied when it was delivered, like his body was disappointed Draco had obliged and breathed. Like it wasn't oxygen his body craved but something else or nothing else. Nothing. Nothingness. Death—she was walking around wearing muggle clothes: threadbare, pale-blue jeans, a white t-shirt, tattered muggle sneakers, holding a tray of empty drinks in one hand and wiping down an empty table with a rag in the other.
-"Shut up! We have a son. You don't understand, none of you do. She wouldn't leave him. She would never. He's only five! He needs his Mother. She'd never do this to him. She's not dead! He's my son. He's our son. Scorpius is my son, she'd never - you're lying, lying! Why? She's alive! WHERE?—"
curiosity, which wasn't an obsession at all was understandable if not excusable which is why he wasn't going to act on it. Absolutely not. Never. What the hell. No.
we’ve worked at the ministry combined. You stare at him all the time. You follow him around. You try to talk to him. You ambushed him when he was with his son!"
, and hope for the best. The kind of love that going in, you know it would break you, ruin you for life when it ended because it
? Would she stay here? Draco would, if she did, in this very muggle club. He'd live here for the rest of his days, in the midst of music, sweat, the sharp scent of alcohol, muggles, cigarette-smoke, laughter, dancing - he'd never leave. She was here.
A couple of hours later found them by the burrow's front-door. Ginny took a deep breath and giggled excitedly, beaming at Harry like he gave a fuck. Like Harry could see past the fact that he could never be with Draco. Like Harry could feel anything beyond the crippling despair slowly poisoning him,
. As Draco's sleep gradually eluded him, he opened his eyes to watch Astoria a little, maybe he'd wake her up just to be annoying. But as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, and as his senses fully awakened and sharpened, Draco Malfoy who knew his wife's body as he did his own, realized that the strong hipbone under his hand was undeniably and distinctly male. It was
He straightened, the sight of her dragging sharp razors over his guts, his lungs, heart, soul, everywhere. He wrapped his arms around himself, shaking, leaned heavily against the table to keep upright, panting loudly, watching her jump from table to table and back to the bar, cleaning up, smiling, chatting with patrons. Draco didn't think anything of this. He didn't think at all. He didn't. God, If there was a God. Please, Please, Please. Let it be
After a minute, Draco started patting Harry's back. Harry sighed and buried his face deeper into Draco's robes. Draco's scent was intoxicating.
, for Draco would never be just his. He kept quiet. So much had happened in a few short months. So much.
The heartache lessened at the sight of it. The hollow that led to dark, scorching depths at the bottom of Harry's stomach - shrank.
-"Well you like being tied up, dont you? Hmm?" Pansy crooned at Blaise. "Trust me, darlings. I would know." She was watching them all amusingly after regaining her spot on the chaise-lounge.
The meat pie was warm and huge so Harry assumed Kreacher was aware Harry had company, and wondered what the fuck was Kreacher thinking of Harry, who was essentially having his, almost-boyfriend? over, cuddling with him on Harry's and his
-"I'm not sure there's much you can do for him Harry. If he's sad about his wife - he's sad about his wife. These things take time." Ginny said, shrugging.
Draco collapsed on the couch again. Harry didn't dare join him. They were getting to the heart of the matter at last.
-"Oh, that's too bad Potter. You see, I'm not going down to lunch. I'm leaving earlier today for personal reasons. And I really should be going. How about you owl me?" He smiled evilly. Yet, no one saw it because they were all awkwardly shuffling their feet, looking down and pretending not to be there and listening in on their conversation.
who'd tripped us on the stairs and started throwing spells left and right, was it not?" Blaise said.
Draco rolled his eyes and lay back down on the bed. Harry joined him after more useless pacing and shoved his face against Draco's.
The following day, a Thursday, Harry Potter didn't bother with checking in with his own department and waited for Draco patiently by the door to The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, he'd debated upon his arrival earlier to wait for Draco in the atrium but he'd dithered and reluctantly admitted in the privacy of his own mind that he really, really didn't want to confront Zabini, seeing as he...slightly intimidated Harry, made him feel small and insignificant, regarded him as if he were a particularly repulsive and distasteful specimen that was indisputably unworthy of Draco. The truth was Harry felt self-conscious, increasingly-anxious and deathly-scared that Draco would grow bored and unamused with Harry and stop entertaining or tolerating Harry's constant proximity, pleading-looks, touching and undeniably problematic and burdensome feelings towards him. Add to that, the awful fact that he was practically deceiving his friends and family, and in a way, cheating on his wife. He really didn't need Zabini's contempt and revolted glare to fuck him up further. He spent the entire day with Draco, to Draco's great irritation. He rolled his eyes so much, Harry feared they'd get stuck if he kept at it any longer.
Sometimes he'd sleep an entire day and lie awake at night. Sometimes sleep wouldn't find him for days. Sometimes he slept for days. Theo was always there with him. Theo wouldn't let him sleep continuously though, he'd wake him up and make him drink things, all sorts of potions, water and then bathe and dress him, tuck him back in. Sometimes even force-feed him actual food when Draco was lucid enough and capable of chewing without choking.
-"Why, Blaise. Everyone has had a crush on your mother at some point. It's simply impossible not to." Draco said.
-"Yessss! You look amazing! I'd never be able to pull off pink like you." And Remembering Scorpius had a thing for unicorns, he added, "You look like a pink hornless unicorn."
The tiny, hideous owl came floating inside. Ostensibly conscious, just tired. Poor thing. She also seemed to be carrying a letter addressed to Draco Malfoy, which
-"I want you to do something for me." Draco said. They were facing each other in the neglected—the entire fucking ministry was dilapidated—dimly lit office. Draco moved closer to Harry.
Harry beamed because the sound of Draco's laughter—as cliché as it was—was his favorite sound. It was music to his ears.
Memories, happy, warm, safe memories tore at him like starving, mad vultures. The sound of Astoria's laughter sliced him open. And it was all he could hear. He should've been happy to see her, to hear her. But it was
The dull ache in Harry's chest became stronger, it burned, yet made him feel cold all-over. He tilted his head, saw Ginny sleeping next to him and felt sick.
people who ever truly gave a fuck about you. Didn't Harry Potter our hero and savior become the most obvious thing and what everyone else wanted him to become - an auror? Did you actually ever think about whether you wanted to fight evil? Did eleven year old Potter want to face The Dark Lord? Did twelve-year old Potter want to fight a Basilisk? Did you ever fucking do any 'evil-fighting' when your life didn't depend on it? Do you even know what thoughts are yours and what are deeply ingrained by Dumbledore, the Gryffindor house, your favorites teachers? Could you get any more mundane and
But Harry genuinely didn't think Draco owed him anything. He didn't think he was entitled to anything regarding Draco, he just wished Draco would give him a chance to help and, Merlin, he was trying, Harry had been awful to him but everyone'd been awful, it was war. Harry was really not being presumptuous and arrogant he was just hopeful and persistent in his pursuit of Draco's friendship.
Harry's entire body quivered and shook, from a combination of apparently fever-hallucinations, uncontrollable sobbing, acute physical and emotional pain, shortage of breath and unbearable and distressing yearning. He was also cold even while his skin felt hot and clammy to the touch.
The knowledge that he'd never, ever see her again would never fail to burn and scorch, inflict pain on everything that he was.
Finally, Narcissa's genteel upbringing made her stand up, almost glide towards Harry and hold her hand out to him.
They locked gazes for a few seconds, communicating all the fear, the gratitude, the love, they felt for one another.
-"Alright. Well, you obviously can't stay cooped up in here wallowing in self-pity no matter how much you enjoy it. So you'll need an occupation, don't you think?" Blaise said.
Oh, but yes! Of course! While he hated Harry and preferred Ginny and would have delighted in ratting him out, Kreacher loved Draco. Draco was a Black-Malfoy, his favorite Mistress Cissy's son! Harry grinned. They were safe. Or Harry was, really. Draco wasn't actually dating him and hadn't made him any promises and in fact said he was marrying Nott. Harry's heart squirmed in his chest and he pushed those thoughts far away so he wouldn't waste a second with Draco and milk their time together for all it was worth.
as Draco nicely put it, using the same potion that Astoria had made for herself and shared with Draco all those years ago. Anyways. Did Harry mention he was nervous? Regardless. It didn't hurt to repeat it. Harry Potter was nervous—the doors opened on their own, the moment they stood before them.
Harry flinched at the quiet crack, lifting his head back up in time to take note of Nixon vanishing his previous quill’s remains.
He flopped around the bed to burrow himself deep into the comforter. Hermione and Ron had given him a pitying look, as though they felt such grief for him. He didn’t want it, so the conversations that followed were stilted and awkward. Whenever Ron laid eyes on him, he could
In the kitchen Ginny spotted her mother and shrieked in happiness. She held her arms open and walked the small distance between them. Molly Weasley took one look at ginny and whispered "No," in disbelief.
He caught up with Draco by the bar. It was conveniently crowded, so Harry—delighted—scooted in closer to Draco, and to be heard over the blasting music, Harry happily plastered his face against the side of Draco's. yay!
-"It looks different now. More...hmm, cheap? Or what do you people like to say? Cozy. Yes, homey and cozy and other words with similar suffixes. Ugly sounds about right too."
They strolled, dramatically and purposefully down the hallways. They passed numerous full cubicles on their way. People stared at them open-mouthed, they were so shocked and enthralled by their entrance, attires and randomness they forgot to feel sorry for Draco. They forgot to look at him with pitying eyes. Draco smirked and winked at everyone who caught his eye. Theo shamelessly pulled out a muggle cigarette, lit it up with his wand and started smoking, the smoke dispersed magically upon being exhaled - everyone's jaws dropped to the ground.
-"Why? What's so funny?" Harry said, chuckling too because Draco's laughter was infectious and he was already feeling hysterical giddiness building up inside him because he had been fucking
He was lonely, heartbroken, lived in a shabby hotel room and shunned by the entirety of Wizarding England. Fucking Great.
Draco seemed as surprised as Harry, but not as mortified, when the tiny envelopes morphed into howlers, that followed them and screamed, somehow using Harry's voice:
. Yet, it hurt. It hurt so much like his heart and soul had been ripped out. They weren't there anymore, but the unending absence burned and ached all the same.
He abruptly turned his back to Potter and promptly crashed into Théo's solid chest. Two glasses of champagne floated beside him. Draco sighed in relief and buried his face in Theo's chest. When Draco didn't move away, Theo seemed to understand something was wrong, or perhaps just the ugly sight of Potter was answer enough. Theo wrapped his arms around him and steered him away.
The woman who'd said this, was speaking about her brother. But they'd loved each other so profoundly - the lines between brother and lover blurred. Brotherly love, romantic love, friendly love, I can't be sure. You can't label us. Categorize us. I love Théo intrinsically. Our love is hazardous. If it had been me that died, if it had been me, blood-cursed, Theo would have used a time-turner and gone back in time in a heartbeat, sold his soul to The Dark Lord to save me. Anyone's soul. I even know, that if it'd ever come to my life or my child's, Theo would choose me, even if I wish more than anything that he wouldn't. But it's me. Always me. Just,
-"I DID NOT SEE 'JEREMY' KILLING 'JACK' GATSBY COMING!" Draco said, mimicking Harry in a high-pitched voice that didn't sound like him at all, but more like a whiny toddler being denied hitting his siblings. But since Harry didn't fancy having his eyes clawed out by Draco, he kept his accurate analogy to himself. He was to blame after all.
-"Well, yeah, but we're older and wiser now and we understand things we didn't back then. Life's not black and white. He certainly was a mean child but he wasn't evil and we weren't innocent either. We were encouraged to be discrepant. Rivals. It's the school system's fault." Hermione said.
His heart squirmed and writhed inside him, leaping up and down, beating violently, bruising and beating itself up against Draco's ribcage, trying to shred its restraints, shred itself, explode, implode,
Harry kissed him and kissed him again, pouring all his fear, desperation and. . .Merlin. Merlin. Merlin. Love. Love. Harry loved him. Harry Loved Draco. He loved him. Oh, Merlin, he loved him. Uncontrollably. Hopelessly. Unequivocally. Truly. He fucking loved him!
One doesn't whine and write poetry about one's pain when they're still suffering it—And Draco would always suffer his.
He changed right then and there in front of Harry, unaware of his certainly unwelcome audience - his shoulders slumped, his head hung, chin resting against his chest in
-"What do you think?" Draco whispered harshly through his erratic sobs. "If I'd truly fucking known what it would do to me to lose her, I'd have run away with Theo after the war and never looked back. It's the truth. I hate myself for it sometimes—she's given me Scorpius. And there's absolutely nothing, no one,  I love more than my child. But it's true. If I could go back, if I could forget it all, not know of my son, I wouldn't want to know her."
She frowned again when Harry didn't stand up to follow her when she'd announced her weariness and heading to bed.
-"He's with Narcissa and Greg. Don't worry about him. Draco, please, are you sure about this? I don't think you're ready to talk about anything, I think we should leave. You can barely walk—"
-"I hadn't gotten out of bed for two weeks, Harry. I had a Major Depressive Episode. I slept through most of it. I'd felt like shit and couldn't even see my son." Draco delivered flatly.
-"Theo, son. Draco's clearly in the middle of a major depressive episode. He's not going to be feeling—"
Theo smiled encouragingly at Draco and rested his chin on Draco's left shoulder. He tilted his head and brushed his nose against Draco's hair and kissed it.
-"Blaise would've started getting suspicious if he'd never seen us leave together. It's settled. Thank you. You can go now." Draco said and turned to leave.
in the mirror and spelled her make up and hair back in place. Her eyes were still red though. All of their eyes were.
Blaise was the first to find a Portkey and therefore the first to get there. He appeared in their little château's drawing-room, to find a shaking Greg who could only manage to nod in the right direction.
Harry dropped a hasty kiss to Draco's cheek and grabbed his shoulder, rolling him onto his back to face him.
, Merlin was surely somewhere, out there, with all his unparalleled powers and immortality, grieving the centuries-old death of his King. Ironically, not unlike Draco. If Merlin himself couldn't bring his lover back, no one can. King Arthur was
Harry was an adult, he wasn't going to bitch about his wife rarely being home, how he didn't even miss her when she was away and felt that neither did she, or about how much he hated his job, how dull and dreary Grimmauld Place was, how distant he'd gradually become from everyone other than Hermione; because she
He went in, greeted Draco, hugged him, smiled at him, played with Scorpius, spent the entire day dying but unable to bring it up.
-"Va chercher ton oncle Greg, et dis lui que je t'ai permis d'avoir un tout petit morceau du cake au chocolat. Je te rejoins rapidement. Ok?" Draco said to his son.

new office. Which turned out to be a normal office, no cauldrons, work-tables or potions' ingredients in sight. Granger explained that the brewing rooms were located separately.
those things his father had been to him as a child for Scorpius. And although Draco wouldn't discourage Scorpius from crying or raising him to perceive emotions as weakness, he still wanted to be strong and invincible in his son's eyes. But Astoria's dead and nothing's the same anymore.
whispering around him, being reasonable and kind to him, treading carefully around him, murmuring soothing words, crying silent tears. But Draco couldn't care less.
The only sounds were of their labored breathing and hysterical, heart-wrenching weeping, and Théo's perpetual strangled murmur of "I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry."
Draco winced and grabbed Harry's hand, lacing their fingers together atop the table, Harry had to stop himself from crying out in joy. This was really happening, Draco was here!
enough to hate it, he was tired and constantly drowsy, yet, he knew, his issues weren't physical. His very soul was suffering and screaming mutely in acute agony, begging, pleading to be saved, to be reunited with its mate. Draco sighed and plastered on a big smile and stepped in the ministry's fireplace to get home.
-"You're sleeping on the couch tonight, darling." She said, seeming utterly unimpressed with Blaise's remark and Draco's very obvious and frankly dramatic seething.
did wrong to make Harry not attend for almost four months, he'd ended up pretending to suffer from initial symptoms of Dragon Pox and fleeing The Burrow like he was cheating on his wife. Which he was.
-"And Potter is obviously not looking like a kicked Kneazle because you said his dick was undersized." Theo added.
-"YESSSSSSS!" Draco enthusiastically nodded but stopped upon their foreheads' painful collision. "Ow! Do it again, do it again." Draco hissed.
in his path, to himself whenever Scorpius wasn't around. But thankfully Scorpius was usually there, playing with Rose and chiding his father or Zabini whenever they slipped and mocked Harry.
They sat down and discussed the boring details of how Draco's case files and assignments would pop up in a specific drawer and how he would be working with literally every department in need of his expertise, so while some departments like the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures or the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes didn't do shit individually, all of their cases combined would be a lot of work. Granger also pointed out that the Department of Mysteries would need Draco too, no one knew what they did, so things could be pretty busy. Blaise had his nose in the air like the pretentious asshole that he was, everyone except Granger and Scorpius looked at him with an expression of utter contempt and disgust they've all practiced and perfected during their teenage years. It was an expression that made the average person squirm and shuffle and feel useless and worthless, it was an expression that told its recipient to go quietly crawl into the nearest ditch and promptly die you fucking waste of oxygen.
-"You know I can neither confirm or deny that." Blaise said seriously. Draco raised an eyebrow.  Blaise smirked and winked.
She sat next to him on the booth, and Draco wept. Right then, there, in public, in front of Astoria, he wept. He didn't think. The pain was too great.
-"I wanted to get drunk on my own. Theo wouldn't let me, so I lied and told Blaise I was going out with you. I didn't know Theo would come see you."
Like Harry had been born for something. For someone. Like Harry's entire life had been leading up to this moment, to this realization. This sudden, life-altering epiphany - that
-"Your lexical knowledge knows no bounds, darling. It's your first day and we all want to be there for you. Blaise and Millie work there anyways. Theo needs to coddle you at all times or I suspect he'll die a most heinous death. And we need Greg to intimidate any twat still bitter about the war. Me? I'm going to keep Scorpius company and watch muggle movies with him on my muggle iPad thingie that my new muggle Boyfriend showed me." pansy said.
His wife was angry at him. She's probably been owling Hermione too, since Hermione was somewhat annoyed at Harry and regarding him suspiciously and knowingly for some days now.
for their own. Why, Millie even tells me that Pansy—" harry had tuned Hermione out. She'd turned to gossiping and living vicariously through others for a few years now. You can hardly blame her when you worked where they worked. And had the lives they had. Boring, monotonous and most of all - predictable. Every day resembled the day it followed and the day it preceded.
. Scorpius politely smiled and turned inquisitive eyes to his father, silently asking who's the stranger. Draco put him down on his feet and crouched down with him.
-"I didn't mean those things about you being a Death Eater. I mean you are—were, but I've been there Draco, I've seen you cry in that bathroom, I've seen you shaking and terrified, unable to kill Dumbledore to literally save your life. And I've known you for most of my life, you're an asshole, you've always made my life harder, but you're harmless. I believe you. I believe in you. Always. Even before the trials, I'd have testified for your defense even if I hadn't been subpoenaed. I'm sorry. I was scared and hurt and lashed out on you.
Draco—Harry heard rustling close by, followed by the sound of small feet padding up the stairs. His heart instantly started pounding furiously. Kreacher. Harry had fucking forgotten he was there! Had he seen anything? Had he seen them all cozied up and cuddling on the couch? The couch that Harry's
Draco Malfoy ambled down to the dining-room for breakfast, trailed by an energetic Scorpius and a still drowsy and tired Theo, who had felt Draco leave the bed and unbeknownst to Draco, had stayed up, waiting, ruminating, for a long time before he went to check up on him.
, tiny, keening noises escaped his throat. Quivering violently, Harry watched as he crumpled into a trembling, whimpering, messy heap of limbs and tears and sorrow, on the old chair. Having a
-"Sleeping." Theo whispered back. Or so he thought, because Draco had closed his eyes some time ago.
After Ginny enthusiastically ate multiple helpings of whatever the fuck pie Kreacher had made that Harry hadn't even bothered to look at, let alone plate and eat, they got up to dress for the day.
-"Fuck me! I shouldn't be allowed out. I'm too fucked to keep secrets. I should have agreed to Italy."
for us all. Well, don't you think it's a bit long-overdue? Spare me the patronizing pity and unsolicited, insincere sympathy. At least if you die I'd get about a week's reprieve of the constant staring. Everyone would feel obliged to mawkishly brood over your much belated death. So what do you say, Potter? I encourage you. It would be one hell of a dramatic exit. An appealingly tragic ending.
Blaise and Pansy stumbled out of their seats, breaking out of their petrified states and wrapped their arms around Theo and Draco. They lay on top of each other, sobbing.
. He remembered what Nott had done to his Dark Mark that night a few weeks ago—Nott and Harry, actually hadn't pulled out their wands and dueled to death once, mostly because Harry never wanted to put Draco in a position where he'd have to choose, since he knew whom he would choose. And also because Nott wasn't so awful to Harry anymore when they'd spent so much time together and he found out that Harry
It was obvious where Draco was; him and Nott had directly apparated inside, while he, on account of him not being cleared to enter, had been stranded outside.

She hugged him. And because Draco was right and Harry couldn't love him without hating him a bit, Harry hadn't been able to see through the haze of his resentment, jealousy that this wasn't an easy decision for Draco. That Draco was shaking and his words were almost stammered! Draco Malfoy was known for his eloquence and sharp-tongue but now he was reduced to a broken, stuttering mess. This wasn't about Harry, or at least not for now, Harry could go home later and cry his eyes out at the unfairness of the world but right now, Draco needed him.
Draco Malfoy opened his eyes with a big, for once, actually genuine smile on his face. It must be because he'd bared his heart to his friends yesterday, he did feel somewhat lighter if not better. But that wasn't completely why. Scorpius Malfoy and Theodore Nott were diligently competing in a contest that from the looks—
He'd been back two weeks ago. Theo hadn't been happy about it, but Draco was better. Or, in all honesty, feeling as good as he'll ever be.
They crowded around him on the bed, propped him up against the headboard. Narcissa and Lucius sitting on either sides of him on the bed, Blaise and Pansy standing over him, Theo with his knees on the floor by his side, next to Lucius.
-"Language!" Scorpius said. "And you can't go, because I'm little and can't go. If I don't go, Oncle Greg and Daddy don't go, if Daddy dont go, Oncle Théo don't go, if you go alone with Auntie Pansy you fight and ruin wedding."
The next day, Harry Potter stepped out into the Atrium and made a beeline for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He, again, started lurking around for a while.
Draco was really familiar with fear, he'd been scared during the war, scared during the trials, terrified when Astoria told him about the blood-curse, cripplingly frightened when she was dying—It'd tore at his insides and shredded them mercilessly.
-"You know. Now, that I'm settled in at Gringotts and have a somewhat predictable work schedule I'll pop by and have lunch with you sometimes. I'd like to see how your office turned out and this kitchen and food you've been talking about, alright?" Theo whispered in the dark.
Théo was saying something, Draco strained to hear him, because this was Theo, Draco's best friend, Draco loved him, they went to Hogwarts together, survived the war together. But Draco didn't think he could survive this time. In fact, Draco wished with everything that he was, everything that he had for the sweet, eternal and peaceful oblivion of
Ron's face went rapidly through expressions of: Confusion, surprise, horror, hurt, disbelief, and finally
Another surge of warmth and fondness bloomed inside Draco. He smiled and nodded at an elated Pansy to say what she was dying to say.
A man approached her, whispered something in her ear and indicated Draco with his chin. She turned, puzzled, and stared where the man was looking. At Draco. She saw him and visibly flinched. She stared. Draco stared back.
-"Rude. She was my aunt. She'd cared for me in her own way, taught me Occlumency, which admittedly didn't help against The Dark Lord but still. . .She was insane, she was my aunt—Mother misses her very much."
-"She can't be dead. She's not. Please, don't interrupt me and just listen. I love her. I love her, don't you see? She can't be dead because I love her. I need her. I can't go on without her. She's so young, so loved, so needed she can't be dead. Im sure—"
bed. Great. Why hadn't he said anything to Ginny when she'd come by? Did he even know who it was? That it was Draco? Obviously Kreacher knew, he was part of the house after all—
-"I can't—" Draco spun around abruptly, staggered and almost lost his footing if not for Harry moving in and righting him. But Harry couldn't immediately let him go. He'd just gotten him back; where he fucking belonged. With Harry. Harry kept his hands on Draco's hips, not physically steadying him anymore, for he was on his two feet again but maybe emotionally; at least the contact helped Harry.
"That's not the point." I sobbed. "That is the main reason I can't do this, I can't keep doing this to you!"
"Mind introducing me to your beautiful friend, love?" A huge but still, good looking man who's standing behind her asked.
"Oh about last time, mind telling me, why you can't have the one you love?" I said in a low voice, bluntly.
"Asshole." He said smirking at me. "Tell him to go to table nine if you see him." And he walked away.
"Nice meeting here young lady." He smiled and held out his hand. I shook it gracefully. "I suppose you're a first year aren't you young lady?"
"We will be playing mother and daughter from now on, right?" She said. "Then if I were your mom, I definitely would never let you wear anything chosen by these two, fashionably clueless people." She explained with a smirk, glancing at Sirius.
"But you should have just said that earlier, we were worried that this might be life and death important." Harry explained.
"Well, Ms. Hannah Jennica Black, you are my girl now. And after we graduated collage I'm marrying you. Any questions?" after the word marry, every one of us in the room seem to drop our mouths from certain angles.
"What!" Pansy shouted… and I was sure her screech was heard throughout the whole damn school. "You can't do that! You can't suspend us not for a month!"
"Yep, they are my twin older siblings, Faith and Gravity." Ron said gesturing to the two. "Faith is a jewelry designer and craftsman, while Gray is a photographer, and hair and makeup artist. Also most of the shoes in the clothing line is either designed or made by them." He explained.
As the word left my mouth, he began pushing one finger in, making a circular motion as he pushed it in and out of my hole. He then hit my prostate making me writhe in the process. Then he hastily added the second one scissoring the tight muscles, then he added the third.
"Yes and don't ask anything anymore." Sirius said, annoyed with the teen ager. "By the way kiddo. Why were you walking here in the middle of the night?" Sirius asked.
"Are you Ms. Hannah Jennica Black?" the guy whom I finally recognized as the president asked, looking at me from head to toe.
"Bitch! Let go of my hair, this costs more than your face!" Ron yelled, as he turned around and grabs a hold of Pansy's hair.
"Yep, all of my siblings, that's how we were raised by our parents. They raised us with love, sooo no one in the family will never have the right to hate another." He told me, with the widest smile I've ever seen in him. "Even if we do stupid things, even if we're the worst kind of people. We'll still know that whenever we go home, my mother's hot stew and forgiveness will always be on our dinner table. That's the true essence of family, someone to always come home to."
He ran outside to the hallway (a dark one even with lights), leading to the elevator. He felt his phone vibrate; he took it and read a text while running.
"Me." I turned around as I heard a rather soft but a little but low voice from behind me. "I saw everything and I'm telling you, both of your behaviors are not acceptable. But provoking someone is worse." A tall girl, a wearing a yellow version of our uniform, said looking daggers at Parkinson and Bulstrode.
"Soooooo," Harry said looking at the now very happy purple haired woman. "feeling good now, Tonks?" he asked.
I hurriedly took out my phone and shot a photo of the place. 'This is going to be the wall paper of all of my gadgets.' I thought.
"Well…" Sirius said. "The reason is quite controversial." He stated. "Actually, I and her mother didn't get to be wed. Because we wanted to wait until our daughter here was born. But sadly she changed her mind halfway through the preparations, meaning the big day ended before it even came." Sirius explained.
"Those two have under developed brains… they were the size of a chicken's but still is under developed." Hermione said as she munched on a chocolate bar.
"You know you can eat that naturally. No one will see you here." Draco said as he noticed me playing with my food.
"Hey, can I take Hannah, just for a sec?" I heard Granger said behind us… and at the time, I totally forgot about her being there.
He played with it until it got pebbled. And then replace his hand with his mouth as his hand played with the other one. He sucked on the right nipple while pinching the other… this time I was trying to catch my breath as I moan one after another.
I used the Student council pattern from the high school I came from. In my country Student councils varies from one school to another. But how the members were chosen were my idea…
"You know, if you don't stop being adorable… I'll ravish you and make you moan all night long, I'll leave my marks all over your body and fuck you so hard; you won't be able to stand for a week." I said with a grin, which made him blush harder… this time I let go of control tackled him down my left arm supporting his back and attacked his neck again.
"By the way guys." Hermoine called the boys without looking at the boys. "You'll be surprised in what you'll see on the board later." She smiled her mischievous smile.
"Oh boy, this is bad." The brown haired man said, behind the door. "Harry, why don't you come here, the atmosphere might get a little scary, and I don't want you to see that, so come with me."
But still even if I must do something even worse than wearing girly clothing, I'll gladly do it, just to get in that school and show that jerk of father what I can do.
"So, why is this shit not starting yet?" I said, trying to change the subject. "You're pig of a boyfriend might have already eaten everything before the program even started.
'Oh my God!' is the only expression I thought as I saw the inside of the tent. 'How in the world did they put these chandeliers in here?' I swear it looks much smaller from the outside. But they managed to put buffet and round tables all over the place. There were even chandeliers and paintings hanging from the walls. It was just "Amazing".
"No! It suites you perfectly, but something's missing." He said doing a thinking gesture. "I know!" He said as he opened my jewelry box, he pulled out my huge heart shaped pendant and a white satin chocker from her purse. "Here, it goes perfectly together." He said handing me the chocker, which now has the pendant on it. "That chocker is one of a kind, because I made it." He explained. "Wear it with your favorite ring and those diamond tear-drop earrings you made in my design room that time you got bored. Now sit down in front of the mirror." He instructed me, and I complied. He took off my wig and revealed my now almost shoulder length hair; I admit my hair grows long extremely fast. And since it's longer it was tame compared to my short nest-like hair before I came here. Ron pulled my hair in a loose bun using a pair of jade chopsticks that Tonks sent me (which I don't really know how to use), he left the front undone, hanging loosely reaching my chin. "There… Perfect."
I moved quickly trying to find the correct clothes to wear for my date. It's only thirty minutes before the one hour that I gave to Draco.
A few minutes after the opening speech of the school's board of directors, the faculty and the president and vice, the whole place went back to that noisy bargain market-like place it was before, with people asking waiters for food and alcohol. Our dates were allowed to come to stage ten minutes after Ced-Celine's speech.
Harry just smiled at his friend's message. He tried reply while he continued running, until he stumbled with a groan.
"Whatever… let's get the hell out of here, this place stinks." Millicent said as she strode away from the cafeteria followed by Pansy.
'What. The. Flying. Fuck is going on?' I thought, as my mouth fell a whole new level, like that girl from that episode of Jimmy Neutron when he confessed to the whole cafeteria that he likes Sydney(the blonde girl… which I'm not sure of if this is her name).
Draco abruptly stopped laughing then, he turned his head to the side so Harry wouldn't kiss him anymore. Harry felt marginally ashamed of himself, was he forcing himself onto Draco? It was what he'd always done with him. He didn't know any better.
Harry's mind went blank. His entire nervous system went on alert. Every neuron in his body firing one impulse. A single word echoing around, inside Harry's mind.
Greg was wearing a normal, boring, wizard robe because he was the only sane person in their five-way relationship.
Harry's heart stirred to life at the sight of Draco, and tears streamed down his cheeks. He missed him so bad, it felt like he'd been walking with his chest sliced open, and his severed heart was
unicorn onesie that she'd bought him a few months ago on his fifth birthday, and not only that but Draco had found it surreptitiously hidden away, for it was clear Scorpius still adored it and couldn't part with it but had made himself forgone it for Draco's sake.
-"Salazar! You look like you've seen a Boggart. I know my wife's dead. I'm not likely to forget that in the next few thousand years or so. It's been what? A week? It already sunk in. I want to see my son." Draco said. Smiling down at Theo and gently brushing Théo's hair from his forehead. It looked longer, and disheveled. Draco hadn't seen it that long since the war. Draco smirked "I like the new hair. It suits you. My wife's dead but don't let my grief stop you from being a vain little shit or anything."
It was a cold, gray, miserable, late November day. Draco was standing in front of four, long, neat and parallel lines of seated people. They all looked up at him. They've been looking at him, for quite sometime. There were words he wanted to say. No. Words, he
him and Scorpius, Theo and Blaise to have lunch in the nearby muggle restaurants, whenever she came by. The food wasn't bad and Draco frankly didn't have any qualms with muggles anymore. Those days were long gone, they bled, sweat and cried just as he did.
She squeaked delightfully when she remarked Scorpius, tucked in his Father's arms, sleepy, and full from
Harry turned to Draco, watched his face, his reaction. Would he forget Harry existed and jump in Nott's arms again? Leave with him? Choose him? Choosing! There was no choosing! Harry knew he didn't compare with Nott, there was no Harry or him. Only him. Nott. He had it all. While Harry was dying without Draco and Draco dying without Astoria, Nott had it all.
Harry followed Draco into the kitchen and found him already seated, the table had already been set, so Harry hurried to bring out what he'd personally made for Draco, a chocolate cake. Because Harry had heard how much Scorpius loved it and thought it likely that Draco liked it too, so he made two. One safely kept away for Scorpius for Draco to take back home and the other being presented by an overly excited Harry. Draco's reaction didn't disappoint, he squealed with delight and bounced in his chair, stretching his arms towards it and wiggling his fingers in impatience.
-"Do you still want to stay? We can go home if you want. Read about gay unicorns and go to bed. What do you think, darling?"
It was quite strange to feel this way for Draco Malfoy. Harry's arch-nemesis and tormenter for years, his rival and above all a fucking asshole. Draco was mean and nasty, a cunning, self-preserving Slytherin, he hated Harry's family, disagreed with everything Harry stood for, been a Death Eater even if it wasn't by choice, let alone his Father, no scratch that, his entire entourage—Friends and family, hated the living fuck out of Harry. Yet Harry loved him more than anything else in this world.
After a new, equally strong bout of mortification on Harry's part, and mock-consoling from Draco's part, Draco announced that he had to go.
He got up and joined Ginny for breakfast. She chattered on and on about how excited she was to break the fantastic news to the rest of her family at the Burrow later, and about how delighted her Mother would be, and how she couldn't wait to know the baby's gender. Harry nodded and smiled when appropriate. Thankfully, she was too engrossed in her happiness, she didn't notice Harry's own lack of it.
-"Harry. You've been in my department the past week longer than you've been in all the years—nearly a
. Harry Potter had fallen for Draco Malfoy. When Harry had gotten married to Ginny, he'd thought he was done with this. Feelings and stuff. He'd thought ginny was it. But she wasn't. And the thing is, Harry discovered that he'd never felt anything remotely like this. Admittedly he'd only been into two people. But still, to think that he'd ever thought he was
Everyday come morning—although he wished he could spend the fucking night there but he didn't want to aggravate Lucius further—Harry would go to Malfoy Manor and demand—hmm, more like
to run to Malfoy. Ginny'd been worried and asked what was wrong, Harry hadn't told her because it wasn't his secret to tell. She'd asked if Harry was mad at her for barely being home, Harry had simply said no and carried on restraining himself from apparating to Malfoy Manor.
He braced his back against the headboard and inhaled deeply. Panting. Gasping. Horrified. Craving more.
-"Oh, right. I was about to chivalrously rescue Potter from the ginger weasel-dragon hybrid." Draco said.
-"I know." Those two words held immense weight. So much went unspoken but understood between Harry and Draco at that moment. Draco knew Harry loved him, he was sorry Harry loved him, and he was sorry he couldn't give him more than the present moment. No promises. No far-future plans. No long-term commitments, at least, not the ones Harry wanted.
Harry would never pursue a. . .relationship with Draco, yet ached because he couldn't, even if he wanted to.
-"What! No! We've been waiting for this for ages. So have you, Theo. Come on, it's Potter! We had several bets that he had a crush on Draco in Hogwarts but was too dumb to realize it. And then he went ahead and nearly killed Draco and fucking Daphné and Blaise won the bet. You and I betted on this shit. Speaking of it, I don't care if it's been nine years, Blaise, Theo and I won now, you're going to have to go have a normal conversation with Lovegood like we agreed."
Draco snarled and shoved Harry away, stepping back, his eyes wild, "You want to know what's wrong with me? I've told you what the fuck is wrong with me! MY WIFE IS FUCKING DEAD THATS WHAT. She's dead. Gone. Forever. And it might be incomprehensible to you because I'm an evil Death-eater but I love her. I love her. I love her so much but she's
-"I'm so, so, so, sorry. I genuinely am sorry, Ginny. But I won't lie to you any longer. It's all my fault. I'm a horrible person but I don't want to die. And I honestly cannot live another day like this. Without him."
-"H-Hi, y-you...Not that I'm comp-p-mmmmmmmm—Complaining but w-whaaaa-aah-tt going on?" Draco managed between kisses.
. Go for it. I'll believe your contrition once you do it." Draco tauntingly spat. He wasn't crying anymore, his eyes were wide and mad, smirk in place, seemingly having the best fun of his life in the face of Harry's misery. But Harry knew the tears and distress weren't far behind.
for her exciting job rather than her intermittent absence from home. He also talked about how he wanted to be a father someday but hadn't brought up the subject with Ginny, and how she was angry with him because he'd been overthinking Draco and not paying attention to her and more importantly refusing to share what was occupying his mind. Draco hadn't said a thing during Harry's long monologue. Harry wasn't even sure he heard everything. Harry hoped he was helping. He kept running his thumb soothingly over the back of Draco's hand. And Draco let him. Harry knew it wouldn't last, Draco would come back to himself soon and would push Harry away again.
He was sitting on his bed —he'd moved out from Scorpius's room obviously, to his childhood chambers— propped up with the giant headboard and half a dozen pillows, chatting with Theo, when Pansy and Blaise pushed the doors to his room open and barged in. Pansy practically bouncing with excitement, while Blaise was smiling smugly.
He tackled Draco to the ground. No, not the ground - Draco recognized Théo's bed, And that Draco was curled up on it, dressed in one of his thousands of silky, pink pajamas, and covered in soft sheets.
"Oh, sorry. Good morning, Father, Mother, Greg." He kissed his Mother's cheek and merely glared at Pansy.
-"I'm homeless, shunned and pretty sure jobless. Your Father will not approve." Harry said between kisses.
The constant incompatible, disparate feelings Draco was experiencing were driving him mad. He wished for the road to madness to shrink already and for insanity to engulf him and take away his pain. But Draco knew that was pure wishful thinking. He'd always be in pain even if he was no longer conscious of
-"Do you have any idea, Blaise, what you took away from me? You all like to think you know the way I feel. You all like to think I've gotten over it. Especially you, Blaise. But you don't
You probably don't care about anything I have to say. Sorry!" Harry said as Nott made his way purposefully towards him.
. But Astoria would never hate me. I was her entire fucking world. She was entirely at my mercy and I was,
Harry surmised that Draco had never said those things aloud. The fact that Harry knew something about Draco nobody else did, didn't bring him much comfort, nor did the fact that he was presently crying his eyes out against Harry's chest, in Harry's arms—Draco's pain had become Harry's own.
Once in Malfoy Manor, Pansy and Blaise fucked off to one of their designated chambers, while Greg retired to his own rooms. Greg had been messed up after the war and Vincent's death. He had needed Draco. Draco took him in. They were happy in France, all four of them (Pansy included) and since Theo visited a lot - all five, in a little french chateau by the outskirts of the big city. And then Scorpius had been born. Their happiness was unparalleled. They've had a good life after everything. Astoria had saved the both of them. And now she was dead. Draco wondered at his heart's ability to beat when it hurt
-"Potter," Nott said, although he didn't spare Harry a single glance, "He seemed increasingly miserable, suspiciously so, when he ought to be overjoyed, all his dreams were coming true."
Draco smirked faintly. He wasn't very proud of some of the things he'd said and believed, but it is what it is.
reasons, but otherwise he was mostly with us, and Pansy was technically living in England too but she'd practically lived at my place. She loves me too much. I think she's codependent. The over-sentimental cow! We all are, honestly."
-"Now, that we've all gotten the animosity out of our systems, shall we move to the dining-room?" Draco cheerfully said.
A few hours later, found them afternoon-drinking in the sunroom like a bunch of losers. In their defense it was actually a Friday.
After a while of passing back and forth the muggle cigarette between them. Harry voiced what was really fucking with him.
-"WhynotIloveyoupleasebemyboyfriend?" Harry mumbled in a rush. He blushed hard and felt tears welling up in his eyes for the impending '
Harry couldn't discuss his wild theories with anyone though. There was a giant, unspoken rule - what happens in the cafeteria, stays in the cafeteria.
-"Can we talk?" And before Malfoy could weasel out of it, Harry added "It's really urgent. I know you said I could owl you but this really needs to be done face to face."
-"Why, yes, he does. That should make you feel better. Although Scorpius likes everyone, really. He is so kind, I don't know where his mother and I went wrong with him." Draco said, smiling proudly.
-"TEDDY WAS A PATIENT???? TEDDY IS INSANE!!!" He turned to Harry and clutched both his shoulders, shaking him.
Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott apparated by Malfoy Manor’s front-door. Draco, distantly and gratefully, registered that Theo had the forethought to not risk apparating inside the house, where anyone, and most importantly Scorpius could be lingering around. Not when Draco was like this.
. Everyone's wondering when you're marrying Nott! Does that mean they have a crush on you too? None of us have anything going on for them anymore. We're all slowly wasting away. And to be honest, I know it sounds awfully presumptuous but I'd thought you needed me at first. It's why I'd approached you—You know how I have a constant 'need' to save the day. . .it's stupid, you used to tease me about it and it's true; when I saw you that day, I-I felt alive,
Draco Malfoy dropped to his knees in front of an actively crying and screaming Scorpius. Draco frantically looked his son over, demanding what happened? Where was he hurt? Touching him everywhere, looking pale and scared.
Candles were lit in the otherwise dark sunroom. A house-elf brought them firewhiskey. Pansy took the lounge chaise hesitantly, Draco nodded at her to take it, he needed to say this standing. He was so mentally exhausted he'd probably shut down and sleep if he sat. Blaise took the loveseat. Theo stood rigidly, his shoulders tense, he seemingly couldn't bring himself to sit either. His expression was unguardedly scared and vulnerable, he stared apprehensively at Draco.
They were perfectly poised, all of them. Like Harry had come here to paint a portrait of them or to take their picture instead of why he was really there. Which was what exactly, anyways? To appear pathetic enough they let him have Draco? To be laughed at? To entertain them by his mere sad existence? To be horribly murdered? Intimidated? Well, he hoped Draco wouldn't let them kill him at least, Scorpius was there too so Harry was safe for now.
The movie was quite a mind-fuck and this time Harry had endeavored to actually watch the entire thing. So he was quite happy and pleasantly warm next to Draco, Draco's head on his shoulder, Draco's hair woven between Harry's fingers, when Draco unceremoniously dropped a fucking bomb in Harry's lap.
Draco threw his arms around Théo's neck, Theo did the same to Draco's waist and crushed him to his chest.
Draco felt razor-sharp claws playing with his heart strings. He swallowed a painful lump in his throat, and begged Merlin not to cry.
Harry's neck was wet with tears. Harry's own tears resurfaced—Nott forcefully tugged one of Harry's arms off Draco, the sudden assault was surprising and unexpected, Harry struggled to understand anything beyond - Draco was crying, Draco was sad, Draco was making small noises that shredded Harry's soul. Harry bewildered and distorted and
He couldn't stand the sight of the warmth and affection in Draco's gaze and bodily-gestures. He turned to her, and fully took her in.
He hurried inside, sat in the nearest booth to the bar, scanning his foreign surroundings. The place was somewhat decent, didn't smell disgusting, the tables weren't greasy, and the music was pleasant if a bit loud; surprisingly, for a Monday evening, there were many customers already; in the center of the club, was a dance floor where a few couples mingled, awkwardly shuffling around and bouncing stupidly to the music. Gross. Draco was embarrassed for them but nevertheless, they provided adequate entertainment.
Except, Draco Malfoy was talking to the pink lady again who was a green lady today since she'd changed her blanket. Whatever. Harry walked up to him and touched Draco's forearm to get his attention.
-"REALLY??" Draco reiterated excitedly. He spun around, spotted the black screen and moved quickly to inspect it. He turned to Harry, his eyes alight with anticipation and beamed at him brightly. Harry's heart was in danger of bursting from his unconditional, indisputable, wholehearted love towards the blond asshole in front of him. He smiled back at Draco and dragged him to bed. Draco lay down and Harry wrapped himself around Draco like a human-sized, needy and extremely clingy cat.
-"Fuck, yeah. That'd be awfully infuriating. Imagine stumbling upon the Weasel or someone along those lines, and having him out of some misguided sense of obligation, awkwardly shuffling his feet and blurting out
It felt like his heart was ripped out, yet, he was still alive and worse of all - capable of feeling.
The thing is. . .his fucking brain decided to defend itself, decided to live, decided it needed to survive. And the only way was to stop what was hurting Draco, which was essentially
. Damned grief took over his life, engulfed him and consumed him whole. The memories were tortuously unendurable. Draco's grief was razor-sharp, merciless, cutting out his heart over and over again, battering his weak, wounded soul. The memories.
-"Eternity sounds good." Harry said as he grinned joyfully and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him in tightly against him, Draco went willingly and cupped Harry's cheeks in both hands, Harry leaned his face into the touch and felt fresh tears resurface in his eyes, he breathed deeply Draco's scent.
The moment they were alone and safely inside the empty drawing room, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and pulled him in for a desperate embrace. Draco wrapped his own arms around Harry's neck and said nothing.
These people loved Harry. Perhaps he'd loved them too, once. But he couldn't recall any of that love anymore. How could he when he'd given up any chance at real happiness he'd ever have?
And then a familiar scent tickled his nose - Harry abruptly sat up, which was a bad a idea for someone who hadn't eaten more than an apple in the entire day and had been living off fruits, nuts, mysterious potions and little water for a month, the room spun and went out of focus, his skin broke out in a cold sweat.
So Harry Potter skulked for two hours outside the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures waiting for lunch two-hour.
Harry didn't love Draco, yet the knowledge that Draco wholeheartedly loved another ate at him, leaving hollowness and a recently developed sense of loss in its wake.
-"There's somewhere I have to be. I don't want anyone to know, I'm going to tell everyone that I'll be with you again when they ask; though, knowing you fancy me and that now you're presumably hanging out with me, Blaise might corner you, try to rile you up - don't stick around if he does, he'll read you like an open book and get suspicious. Just run, he'll think you're simply flustered or embarrassed."
Turns out Pansy Parkinson has a muggle boyfriend named Samuel, whom she calls Sammy. She said he liked it. Draco said it was stupid but secretly thought it cute. Blaise was a bit cross because he was no longer getting laid, since it was difficult to find someone who only wanted sex, on account of him being
some semblance of normalcy after everything; he'd needed Draco Malfoy to come back to Hogwarts; to sneer at Harry; to corner him with his cronies; to call Harry names; to painstakingly make hundreds of badges insulting Harry; to charm pretty paper-birds to fly after Harry, presaging his demise by a lightning-strike; to climb up trees and patiently wait to scare Harry and make a dramatic appearance; Harry'd needed Draco Malfoy, yearned for what he represented, for what Draco was reminiscent of - the past, when Sirius, Remus, Fred, Tonks, little Colin Creevey, Severus Snape were alive, when Dumbledore seemed larger than life, unassailable. When Harry hadn't
Now here I am, standing in front of the dorm, holding the clutch I used in the opening ball, with only a minute before seven pm.
"I won't. Being in the same department isn't an enough reason for me to favor you in this matter. What you are asking is ridiculous. And knowing both of you, you're the one who started the trouble. And that girl doesn't deserve to be expelled, both of you have done much more serious offences and both of you didn't got expelled. And you expected me to write a letter for her expulsion? You got to be deluded."
"They can't just do that! You have no experience. You'll just embarrass yourself on stage." She said as she lay beside Ron.
"And where did you hear those infos from? Granger? She's those freaks friend!" Pansy shouted, while Milliscent still looked as stoic as she was when she first came in the room. She just sat there quietly; seems like she's plotting something… though that is to be expected, she's a lot smarter than her sidekick.
"He really thought his words could kill." The shorter guy said making both of them laughed. They just smirked mockingly at me when they noticed my stare. They just walked passed me as I glare daggers at them.
"I know you've been disowned. I'm asking WHY you have been disowned. What happened?" Serius explained, a little bit annoyed. "Okay, if you're not comfortable about it now, let's talk about it tomorrow, no big deal." He said again.
"I really don't give a shit about genre. If I like a song I listen to it no matter what it was." Draco explained. "Now will I
"Wait!" Sirius exclaimed, "I won't let this woman, with an outrageous way of dressing up, choose our Harry's clothes. No way!"
I turned around and saw a brunet girl, in a revealing black halter gown with a neckline too low that shows every part of her cleavage, and a really long slit that went up to her upper thigh Which can be described by one word… EW! Also she's wearing her hair down, and wearing a gold bracelet and ring, she's also wearing these ugly blue earrings that that didn't go with everything and screams last minute shopping and fake. And standing beside her is a much better looking and much better dressed girl, with tanned skin. She's wearing her bleach blond hair down, and wearing a decent sparkly violet asymmetrical strapped short dress, black heels diamond necklace watch and earrings, her look is good and in place unlike her friend's that screams easy and whore.
Turns out that that forest houses the school's green house, where the science department does their plant research, it's also the dwelling place of the council's president. It also turns out that the president does proposals for different things, and he's a Slitherin.
"Shit!" I said as looked at the papers in my arms. "I forgot to return them." I looked back to Rens direction, but suddenly she is nowhere to be seen.
"Enough, Pansy." Millicent said. "Tom, you know that even if you didn't help us expel her, we'll find other ways to get rid of her, right?" She said.
Then just right after that I went straight to my bathroom. I turned the water all the way up then turned on the shower. I savor the heat and warmth the water is giving me, recalling the things that happen at the lake last night.
"Yes, sadly. How come he didn't say that to me?" Millicent asked herself. "Even though it's clear, that I'm prettier than that Hannah girl." She said folding her arms, looking daggers at the unsuspected girl(snickers).
? I don't think gossiping about the life of your subordinates is one of them." I said, my eyes never leaving my long overdue paper work.
"How do you get to do that… t-that thing with Zabini?" I asked my eyes closed. 'Please don't make me say it.' I mouthed, my fingers crossed.
'Good thing Tonks send me that yesterday.' Harry thought as Draco put the disc in the player. It took only seconds before the violin sounds were filling the air in the room. Then Harry realized that the song was a classical version of one of his favorite songs… Helena by My Chemical Romance. "Is that… Helena?" Harry asked amazement visible in his voice.
"Isn't it too early for the circus?" The woman with her said, the queen-like beauty that goes by the name of Millicent Bulstrode.
I fixed the other clothes to their proper hangers, and put my stuff in a paper bag before I went out side.
"Oh, Harry, Draco, This is Victor Krum. My boyfriend." And there was it, the look of contentment and happiness when she said the word boyfriend, and that look is also seen in Victor as he hears it.
It has been already been 30 minutes since Sirius got out of his bedroom with a black eye and a bleeding mouth. Since then, no one even tried to speak. Everyone just sat in the living room, munching on the snacks Remus bring in every ten minutes.
It's a nice sunny Wednesday morning, birds are flying chirping happily, the lake shines brightly and the wind hums lightly. And to top it all off, me and Draco are official, and he knows ALL of my secrets.
"I told you it's in bad condition, after that incident in the bathroom with Ms. Ugly-mug Parkinson." Ron explained as he took a seat beside me.
"Sometimes he do, sometimes I do… I do when he felt like having the one wearing girl's clothes on top was erotic… like on those porn movies he watches." He explained, pretending to check out his nails.
'FUCK NO!' I thought. 'No fucking way!' No way I'll be wearing clothes like these here! No way in hell! But again all pleading go to waste as I saw myself in the 3 inch above the knee dress, 6 inch wedge, and a wig the same color and texture as my hair, that Tonks just threw in out of nowhere. She then took me to the girls bathroom and opened a paper bag(which I'm sure she got with the wig, while I'm changing.) and reveal a make-up set, two lipsticks, a shadow palette, a foundation compact, a pressed powder refill and a pair of false eye lashes…
"Did you hear what Draco just said?" Pansy whispered to Millicent giving her the 'oh no he didn't!' look.
Tonks had already bought two pairs of tank tops, one electric pink with turquois lining and the words "I'm beautiful" in front, And "Problem?" in the back. The other one was a Green hanging top with a torn arm hole and also a torn plunging neckline, I swear, I can only wear that with an under shirt. She also bought two black tube tops along with it. We also bought five t-shirts and two denims, which I choose.
"I mean you were chosen to be one of the candidates for the 37th Pageant of the Annual Hogwarts Yule Celebration."
"Well, someone here is forgetting her place; I'm the vice president of the student council. And remember I placed second in the overall studious IQ examination last month. And you?" She spoke.
"Wait!" I tried to say to her, but I was too late since now here I am sitting on the floor with a bleeding nose.
"So… uhm." He cleared his throat. "If a student council member volunteered to be an escort for in the pageant… he would automatically be entitled to choose the candidate to escort. So… you don't need to participate to the draw tomorrow." He said looking away from me.
"What a maniac." Draco sighed to himself as he walked towards his dorm room. "But still…" Draco smirked. "such a lovely and intoxicating addition to the already interesting arts department."
'Common Harry Potter, think! Time is ticking out!' I thought to myself. It's almost 6:30 now and I still do not have a fucking idea.
"Always the naughty little boy, aren't you." He said, the corner of his red glazed lips tugging up, I swear if he was a real girl, I'll definitely give him a shot, he looks really edible in that lacey white dress, which shows a glimpse of that fair milky white shoulders.
"Dray, if only we're not here I'll be the first to one to initiate a make out session! Not here someone might come!" I shouted.
"Let's go! Here they come!" He said as he took my arm, ran out of the door straight to the elevator… and I freaki'n swear I heard a string of curses and 'come back here Ron!' behind us.
"Yea, and marks were still there. But since the products were new the punishment will be different." He explained, as he put the half empty glass on a counter.
"Did you forget that my boyfriend is in the council too? And, I made that look for you in just fifteen minutes. And putting makeup on someone else is harder that than putting it on yourself. And my outfit has been ready since last week; and I've stolen the shoes I'm using myself a very long time ago." Ron said as he took a glass of martini from the passing waiter.
"Oh, Harry…" He said worriedly at me. "You know you'll always have family in me and Herms. We'll always be here for you." He said rubbing my arm soothingly.
He just sighed and said. "Those two animals think very highly of themselves because of their parent's money, they think that everything they do is right. Take care of yourself, and the people who matters to you." He said glancing towards the other's direction. "Those two. They'll try destroying you, but remember that only one has strength, and the other only has brains." He said as he opened the door for me. I stood there dumbfounded for a second until I regain my composure, and starred at him.
"My mom and I bought it from a department store in a mall somewhere." I said still blushing like crazy. "Is it really that hideous?"
I started to feel a little bit uneasy, 'Please don't hurt me evil ghosts!' I thought to myself, but then I heard the sounds of something crashing towards the locker rooms. As I walked towards it I came upon two large boys laughing, high fiving each other. 'Slytherin boys.' I thought as I looked at their uniforms.
"What do you mean?" I asked Ms. Eves the grumpy looking woman, with a thick rimmed glasses and wearing a really t ight bun on her hair which looked like it hurt, by the way.
"Wait! Wait! Wait!" I shouted looking at them. "Why guys? Why do you go these lengths just to help me? We just met last September!"
Now that that ordeal is taken care off. I'll just need to have ideas on how I'm going to drop the bomb… Should I do the "Hey dude! I have something to tell you…" approach, the "Believe it or not I'm…" approach or the "Hey dude it's not what you think it is…" approach. Now that I think about it… all of those approaches always lead to disaster, which fucki'n sucks!
'Hmmm… Suspicious, very suspicious. What are those two talking about? Whatever that is it, it can't be good, why not follow them… now I have something exiting to do, and I can't help smirking at the thought.
"They fucking poisoned my models with laxatives and burned my entire collection to ashes!" Ron said waving his hand furiously.
"That's life for ya…" Harry sighed. "And… how can you even manage drawing in front of the window? Won't the light distract you?"
"No little sis. We just planned to trip you; we didn't plan on dumping our precious moochinos on you. But since these two were the victims, it's totally worth it." Fred said.
"The coast is clear right." A soft scared, manly voice asked behind me… why is this place full of sneaky assholes.
"Me too." She said as she looked away, seemed to be looking for someone. "There she is!" She shouted. "Mione!" She called, a girl with wavy hair, wearing pink halter dress, pink four inch gladiator heels, a pink croc skin clutch, silver drop earrings and bangles, and a silver wrist watch.
of bruises swollen cheeks, and messy hair). And the damage that's done to me (consisting of a tear on my sleeve, scratches on different parts of my skin (I never scratch enemies, that's just stupid, it's better to just punch the lights out of them), a swollen cheek from the earlier slap, and my beautiful wig that went a little out of place but thankfully didn't come off. Good thing I didn't get a bruise).
And that sight is my room… my pink and fab room. Courtesy of my momma, Ms. Nymphadora Tonks, since each student will stay in only one dorm room for the rest of his stay, every student is allowed to decorate his room any way he wants… so my surrogate mother took charge and colored my room pink, baby blue, and lavender. But mostly pink. My wall paper is electric pink with watermelons on it, it is decorated with gold and silver frames, which have stars, hearts or dolphins all over them, inside these frames were pictures of Remus, Sirius and Tonks herself. My book shelf is covered with lavender, pink, and light blue see through fabric that have dolphins on the corners, my window has a layered pink and purple curtain with gold stars hanging from them, my door has pink and blue fuzzy wires on it that forms the words STRONG & BEAUTIFUL, and had hearts on it, my desk has baby blue covers with under the sea patterns, my pencil holder has teddy bears on it, my pens and pencils has blue, pink, and violet shiny covers, my ACER laptop courtesy of Sirius has beads and butterfly patterns, my new phone which is a white Samsung Corby 2 has a pink case. And my bed has apple green covers with electric pink linings, pillows have the same patterns and on the bottom left corner is a very large teddy bear in ballet outfit, on top of it is a blue canopy with silver stars, my dresser is a made of white wood with two doors and a large mirror on the left door.
"What are we doing here? I thought were eating out." I asked, confused for the reason for us to be in the mall.
"All you need now are some long nails and long sleeves." Tonks said as she stood behind me. "I know!" she exclaimed. "Let's go!" She said as she pulled me excitedly to the changing corner…
"I don't know how you'll do it but please-" I didn't let him finish, before I pushed a finger in his mouth.
"WHAT THE HELL!" Hermione shouted as she emerged from the student affairs office besides the bulletin board. "I can't believe it!" She said crossing her arms in front of her chest. Her eyes in a fixed glare the looked like it may shoot lasers out any minute.
Yep I had the usual flings and fucks. But hey! No one is yet to won Draco Malfoy's heart. Many tried but I doubt they ever will.
"Why, even circus beauties like us needs to go to classes, or else we'd end up like you… beautiful, but with a foul attitude," Ron said pointing at Millicent. "or that woman, who might be absent when the gods showered the human beings beauty, grace and brains." He said pointing at Pansy who fumed with anger and embarrassment. "Let's just go Hannah or the ugliness might rub off." He said as he stood up, turning his back against the two.
"Don't blame him… He was on duty today, I'm the one who insist on bringing my collection to the tailoring department today." Ren said calmly.
"My phones are not even in my pockets, they're just in front of my skin!" He read the message and saw Hermoine's commanding tone…
"I don't know wha-" I didn't even finished my sentence before Draco pulled hard on my arm. "Draco that hurts!" I shouted.
Then I just couldn't help myself, and be the embarrassing best friend. "Sooo… you're the Victor that Hermione talks about morning, noon, and night." I said quirking an eyebrow; which resulted in making the couple blush and Malfoy dragging me somewhere far away.
Then as I look closely at him, it took my breath away… he was wearing a gray long sleeve shirt, white pants and black shoes. He also wore a designer watch that completed the look.
'Sadly… I didn't. I never did. Can this day get any better?' I asked myself as I smashed my head on my desk, which backfired immediately when pain shot up to my head. "Shit!" I hissed, Ren patted my back.
"No not really, but each one of them has his own room, and they thought that it will be much better if they both sleep in one, and use the other one to store their designs in."
"How about I'll make you see it tonight. Let's go out, maybe eat some dinner, watch movies, and maybe drink a little."
"I think that's the last of it." Ron said. As both of them stood up and handed the papers to Hermoine.
"Oh, Arthur, my friend!" He said as he embraced the man. "Oh, Hannah. This is my friend Arthur Weasley. He's the chief of the police detection and infiltration unit.
I figured I'll wear something a little bit boyish. Just to emphasize the fact that I was going to tell him tonight. I picked my beige cargo pants, a blue t-shirt that has an "I'm not bossy; I just have better ideas…" print, and my trusted black and white sneakers.
I touched my elf as I remembered the feeling of his arms around me, supporting my back as he laid me there on the cold grass. How his heat contrasted with the cold ground and air. How he made me forget that there were people that might come in any moment. How his kisses took my breath every single time.
Spike offered to slap the blond into his senses, but Paige pushed him away. The threat seemed to be enough as Draco shook his head and stood.
No, it was something older, and more sentimental. The sight of a red haired girl with a newborn in her arms and a glowing smile.
