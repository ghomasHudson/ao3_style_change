"And all of your fans!" Draco makes sure to coat his voice in disgust, rolling his eyes. "The press that follows you around; honestly I don't know how the Weaslette lasted as long as she did. As far as they knew we were just friends and still they hounded me for information about you, pictures and interviews and whatnot. I couldn't take a step from Hogwarts grounds without being bombarded, how could anybody suffer through that? I mean you're a decent enough person, Potter, underneath all of the," Draco waves his hand flippantly, "annoying bits, but you're hardly worth putting up with that for the rest of my life."
That’s fine too though. He’d trying to be honest here and the descriptor of tired just about sums Draco up these days.
Maybe it's the fact that they'd only left Hogwarts a few months ago and Draco is barely even able to
“Draco?”
Again Harry and Draco glance at one another, thinking back to the rejected handshake. Draco squeezes his hand.
When Draco had finally been unable to bear any more of Potter’s hatred he had run to Pansy so that they would both be able to leave. The relief he’d felt at seeing her standing in the entrance way to the tent had been overwhelming.
He and Harry can’t be together. Draco knows that and yet he is still letting himself hurt both of them.
“You’re fine.” Harry scrambles for a topic, a heavy silence falling between them. He doesn’t want to suggest leaving quite yet but at the same time the anticipation makes him feel like he’s going to throw up.
“It wasn’t something I expected you to do. It wasn’t something I would have expected anyone to do for me. And it made me think that maybe you didn’t hate me like I thought you did.”
It sounds like Millie is in a similar situation and will be joining her. Surprisingly Theo is going to do something in banking, though Harry will admit he doesn’t pay as much attention to the details as he should have because it had bored him.
Now he’s only wearing socks and tight dark briefs but as Draco watches Harry’s eyes darken he knows it’s not a turn off.
"And this summer you were so busy with everything, the trials, all those funerals, we barely saw each other. Even now, sometimes, you're so lost in your head you don't realize that we're here." She smiles at him. "You need someone to bring you out of your thoughts, Harry, to keep you present. And that's not me."
He shouldn't be here, he thinks wildly, not in his state or at this time. But he feels like he's shaking apart and everything hurts and he just needs- he needs-
Harry breathes in sharply. "Don't-"
Draco looks a bit lost and when he speaks his voice is just as unsure. “So you… came here? To see me?”
Harry blushes immediately and Draco chokes on his sip of juice.
The bloody
“I can’t go to Hogsmeade,” Draco reminds them all for what Harry knows to be at least the fifth time. They all have a habit of forgetting.
“One won’t hurt you, Potter. Come on. It’ll loosen you up. You seem incredibly tense.”
“I don’t know if I want to,” Blaise mutters but he turns regardless. “Honestly you guys, what the hell? Seeing each other since Christmas?”
Molly and Arthur have both spent a good amount of time trying to ask Harry about Ginny, his relationship with Ginny, and everything else related to both subjects in the past four days since he’s arrived. Harry had been left a stuttering and awkward red-faced mess each and every time.
She smiles and squeezes his hand back. "Are you-”
Harry smiles back at him in the mirror and steps forward to close that last bit of distance between them, pressing against Draco. “Then yes, we are being ridiculous.”
“Just admit you were lying.” Harry pushes and Draco glares. “Sure you got scratched that first day, but you went on about it for what felt like weeks. Just admit Pomfrey patched you up in seconds and the rest was exaggerated.”
“And the two of us will stay professional.”
“I’d rather stay here, if it’s all the same.” He interrupts Hermione quietly and stares down at his book. When neither of them answer he’s forced to look up. “Better lighting.”
When he comes to again it’s to the sound of somebody downstairs in his kitchen and he tenses. But then he hears Hermione’s voice, quiet, but definitely hers, as she sings along with the radio. It causes him to sit up so quickly it makes him groan and squeeze his eyes shut again.
. Draco fills with surprise, because even though he’s accepted that Potter is a better person than Draco had always pretended, he’s never thought that Potter actually
Draco blushes and pulls away a bit. “Severus knew?” He demands.
Draco frowns in confusion. “What wizards were involved?”
“I’m not tricking you.” Harry says gently, coming a bit closer with a frown. “Look, I’m sorry I haven’t come and seen you.”
"He's just a boy." She finishes while standing straight and tall in her pitch-black robes. "Doing what his father told him, knowing he'd be punished otherwise. We never gave Draco a choice and he did the best he could. Mr. Potter is correct when he said my son is not evil. He is a different generation of Malfoy than his father. Much better than either Lucius and I."
“Take it back.”
“But this year was meant to be the beginning of a recovery. Certain things were never meant to be permanent, just temporary measures to get us through this first year.”
But this time it wasn’t accusing or worried. It was Hermione smiling up at him saying, “I’m really happy you and Draco are friends now Harry.”
“Tomorrow it will be over.” His whisper is soft and he closes his eyes to take another deep breath. “Tomorrow- tomorrow you’ll know.”
He tries to stay quiet, really he does. When he does speak he'll chalk it up to not being capable of sitting by and watching somebody fail so miserably at Potions.
"Hmm." Draco feigns disinterest, perusing his notes, when in fact this is the most he's heard of Potter from a direct source in weeks. He wonders how Harry's doing, what he's done to make them stop asking him questions, and how Draco can do the same to Blaise. "How interesting. Such a sacrifice for you all I imagine."
missing you and wanting you. These last months I’ve been trying to fight for you the best I could. And that entire time you’ve lied to me.”
“That’s another thing to apologize for.” Draco’s quieter now and Harry still can’t see him. “17 years worth of apologies.”
“Of course they will.” Draco feels desperate and he stumbles over to Harry, only to freeze in his tracks when Harry takes a step back, obviously wanting space. “Of course things will change.”
“Because Kazi’s friends with Ginny and Luna and I speak to her sometimes. It’s obvious she’s had a crush on Roger since what? Their Third Year?”
“Don’t I know it.”
He looks a bit like Harry actually, and that’s usually Draco’s type. But right now he feels horrible, guilt and too many things to name swirling around inside of him.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco actually has the nerve to sound hurt. “Of course that’s what I said down there around the rest of them but don’t be stupid. You were supposed to say no!”
Maybe he’s overthinking this. It could just be that Keller doesn’t like being stuck inside sorting mail instead of working out in the field.
Narcissa stops speaking and freezes in the middle of shouldering on the emerald nightgown from the foot of her bed. Her hair is pinned tightly to her head but there are slight bags under her eyes showing how tired she is.
Draco swallows, something that's suddenly very hard to do. He imagines facing Hermione and Ron the next time they show up with the others, seeing the judgement on their faces- or worse, losing their friendship altogether. He can just picture Luna finally looking at him with the hatred he's long deserved from her. Draco can see the confused worry from Pansy, and even the scoffs that he's a bloody idiot from Millie and Theo.
“I just don’t want to mess it up. The last thing I want is to lose this.”
Draco nods and goes and puts his study notes away, wondering how on earth he’s going to talk to Harry about all of this.
Harry waves his words away. “Never mind that now.”
“See you back at school.” Harry takes a step back, opening the door as he does. “Thank your mother again for me.”
So why does he look so… tense? Even Harry was more relaxed than him. To begin with at least. It’s Draco and his nerves that are putting Harry on edge.
Draco’s still looking like someone smacked him and Harry resists the urge to smile and nudge him to bring him back to the moment from wherever he’s gone.
Harry Potter is left frozen and staring, surprised at the last dig. What the hell does he mean, better than what Harry's doing? How would Draco have any idea on how Harry's doing when-
“And I don’t know when you both got it in your heads that the rest of us would just sit by and watch this all happen, but it’s bonkers. Honestly! Anytime we try and bring it up to either of you it’s as if we’ve betrayed some kind of oath of secrecy.” Her glare was unwavering and Draco had been unable to do anything but stare up at her helplessly. “For fucks sake, Harry can’t even stand to hear your
But Harry remembers how tired he had been this morning, and how weary Draco had been earlier. He wonders if the Slytherin had gotten any sleep last night.
It’s a nice feeling.

He seems almost breathless by the time he is finished and Harry finally looks up from the picture of his parents, Sirius, Remus and Peter all standing with wide smiles and waving at the camera with a baby in his Mum’s arms. Him from years ago.
(It’s not a competition, he knows. It’s not like one pair will win and the other won’t. But like he said.
Or they could tell everybody.
“Bye guys,” Neville waves and then opens the door to slip inside. Draco waits until he hears the lock click before turning to Ron.
Easily. Ha.
They walk through the door and Harry finally relaxes, making Draco release him. When Harry chances a look at him he finds Draco already staring, a question written clearly across his face.
sentence. “Merlin, aren’t you chatty all of a sudden?”
Draco eventually speaks once Harry catches his eye, meeting his wide grin with one of his own. "I agree. And I'm sure our friends will be very happy that we've come to the same conclusion they have." His grey eyes look so open and earnest Harry loses his breath. "I am sorry, Harry. You'll never know how much. Every second after I ended us I wished I hadn’t. Ever since I've seen you again all I've wanted to do was apologize and ask you to take me back."
“Do you?”
“Just pass the jam!” Harry says loudly, making everyone nearby go quiet and look over at them. He raises his eyes from his plate to meet Ron’s. “Please.” He says, and his voice definitely cracks.
“And?”
It evens things up, Harry sees, and it appears to be working.
“When is he not?”
“But not just family dear, though I’m glad we’ve done right that way, at least.” She cups his cheek. “Even strangers, people you don’t know, people we grew up hating just for being different.” She takes a deep breath. “Even Muggles. They have families too, and they share some of the same problems we do. Everyone’s just trying to make it safely through this world.”
“Alright then.” She smiles shyly before her face and tone turn teasing. “Have a good day you two. Happy Valentine’s.”
His heart has been beating so loudly that he’s heard it in his ears since last night. He went to sleep feeling like he’d just crashed after an adrenaline rush.
"And you managed to get through an entire confrontation with the Golden Trio without hexing one of them," Pansy interrupts with a sneer to the nickname that has gained popularity over the summer. "Which is quite an accomplishment. Every time I look at Granger I want to cut off all that blasted hair."
Harry resists the urge to laugh again at the accusation as he looks both Harry and Draco up and down skeptically. Obviously their rivalry on the pitch is something people think hasn’t gone away just because they are friends off of it now.
Blaise tries to help, Draco thinks. He acts more and more ridiculous so that the people congratulating him have no reason to look away and spot Harry. But it doesn’t matter. People couldn’t ignore Harry if they tried. He has a way of standing out even in such a crowded place.
Ron is going to kill him.
The couple honestly seem surprised themselves at how little the rest of them bother. It’s surprising, but not because of their Houses or who they are. Just because it’s two of their friends from their friend group and the dynamic is going to change now a bit.
She frowns a bit, obviously just as mystified as he is, but shrugs it off. “Well he’s been popping around to visit him quite often these past few days. Actually he’s been behaving quite oddly, spending ages working on his Secret Santa gift. You wouldn’t happen to know who he has, do you?”
Draco leans forward, eyes caught on the picture as well.
Draco looks down at their enclosed hands again before answering. “Probably when you sent me back my wand over the summer.”
He’s loved this place for so long that he wants to be here for Christmas instead of, say, Grimmauld Place or anywhere else. He has the rest of his life to celebrate holidays away from school.
Ron snorts. "Right, mate, can you see Harry and Malfoy cozying up together to study by a fire?"
They’re sweaty and hot and panting and closer to one another than they’ve ever been. Draco feels connected to Harry, joined in a way that’s more than purely physical and from the look on Harry’s face it’s mutual.
and what they were
The feelings are distracting Harry to a truly despairing degree and he’s glad that most of their professors are going easier on them this last week before winter holidays. He’s not the only disrupted student and for that he’s grateful. When his friends notice and ask Harry explains his preoccupation away as excitement for break, all the while ignoring Draco’s quietly smug look.
“I mean I am known for my kind and giving nature,” Draco goes on, ignoring Harry’s snort pointedly. “Could practically be Father Christmas, I could.”
"Okay." Draco says, and Potter smiles and the class is over and Draco gets out of there faster than anybody, ignoring the flutters in his stomach that he thinks might even be anticipation.
Harry shrugs and reaches for a piece of unbuttered toast. “Why not?”
He has nothing to look smug about anyway, as Harry has caught him staring multiple times this week in Muggle Studies. Or whenever he has been able to get Draco to stammer while finishing a sentence whenever Harry surreptitiously rubs his foot against the other bloke’s leg teasingly at breakfast. Or when Harry allows his eyes to very obviously trail down Draco’s form and check him out, making the blonde blush furiously.
“We’re getting drunk tonight so that next week before we all leave we can have a classy Christmas party.” Millie lets the two of them know about half an hour after they joined the game of King’s Cup. “Don’t bother fighting it, we’ve all already decided. You two had best pick out some nice robes because Pansy and Hermione want it to be this whole thing.”
Ron starts talking about the Chudley Canons and for a while they lose themselves in Quidditch, a debate Ginny eagerly joins into, and by the time the train stops Harry's remembered why he loves the ride to Hogwarts so much.
“Who got the Snitch? Was it you, Draco?” Lynne asks, moving forward. When Draco holds up his hand triumphantly she whoops. “
“What?”
“Ginny,” Blaise’s voice is shaking slightly Draco notes with surprise. It’s not often he sees his friend unsure. As he keeps speaking though he grows more confident. “You are the most inspiring person I’ve ever met. Every day you challenge me in the best way and make me grateful that I’m the person you’ve chosen to spend your life with. You make me want to be better, in any way I can. Nobody’s ever made me feel that before, but for you I want to, not only for myself, but because you only deserve the best. And I vow, in front of friends and family, that I will spend the rest of our lives making sure that’s what you get.” Blaise cracks a smile. “You being the sexiest woman I’ve ever known is just a bonus.”
Draco laughs. “Why would you be sorry?”

“Alright Harry,” Hermione gives him a small smile of encouragement and Ron nods.
"Oh don't worry," Harry says, moving forward to replace his hand with his lips on Draco's chest. Draco releases a shaky breath and falls back against the sheets as Harry's tongue swirls around a nipple. "I definitely won't let you do anything like that again. Not unless you mean it that time."
That's all the warning Blaise has before Draco's stepping out of his boxers and putting on his robes. Blaise scoffs and rakes his eyes over Draco, making the blonde frown at him. "We were in the same dorm for years. Believe me, I've seen more of your bare arse than anybody ever wants to. Besides, you forget I'm with Ginny, who has the best bum-"
“No.” Harry says. “No it’s been brilliant, actually.”
“It comes from a place of love.” Draco says before taking another drink and wiping his lip before growing serious. Harry tracks his movement. “Sorry. I’m nervous.”
“We loathed each other.” Harry says quietly, searching his face. “I’m not going to lie and pretend we didn’t. I meant what I said, we can move on from everything that’s happened. I want to.”
Title from 'Poison and Wine' by The Civil Wars
“Draco.” Snape’s voice makes him look over at the old Headmaster, though he hesitates. Snape looks the same as ever in his painting and a small part of Draco settles as he gathers the courage to get up and walk a bit closer, checking to see that Harry and McGonagall are still lost in conversation.
Harry shakes his head, his hair fringe falling nearly his eyes. Mrs. Weasley or someone needs to cut that. “I said you looked awful. There’s a difference.”
“Um.” Harry says intelligently.
“Draco!” She whimpers before zooming right up to them. She ignores Harry completely as he stumbles back in surprise at her sudden proximity, and Draco instinctively reaches out to steady him so he doesn’t fall to the floor in a splash. “How are you?”
He’s never really thought it mattered that much. It was just something they never got around to, and now that they’re just friends again… he’s almost glad in a way. It’s one less complication he supposes.
to everybody else. My mother still gets hate mail every day and I still get curses aimed at me in the hallways and our mail gets screened and that’s just how it is. That’s how it’s always going to be. So yes, I have gotten into the habit of putting up Shield charms any time I leave my dorm, Potter, because otherwise I will end up in the hospital wing and this year, with the grades I need, I can’t afford to miss even a day of schoolwork, alright?”
“We don’t mind Hagrid,” Draco says and Harry nods.
The problem, of course, is that
“Blaise-” Pansy starts, but Draco holds up a hand to stop her.
“You were at it quite a bit, mate.” Ron interjects, making himself blush.

Harry racks his brain. “Was it Easter then? When Ron, Hermione and I…?” He trails off and Draco stiffens, obviously remembering those hours at Malfoy Manor.
Okay this one is a bit long but it was most cohesive to just keep it all together. Also there's a POV switch again.
! You can all suck it.”
“I would like.”
Harry shifts. “It’s not a time I like to remember. Even Ron and Hermione don’t know it all.”
“I suppose you’re right.” Blaise says finally.
He even talks about the Marauders and his father’s stag before finishing, quietly, with Severus’ doe. Draco understands now, why Snape’s
“Don’t ask me.” She answers blithely. “Oh, look, there’s Draco, shall we go and say hi?”
Draco nods when it becomes apparent Blaise is too distracted to do so and Arthur shoots him a small smile. “I have to say I never imagined Ginny would be the next to get married, but hey ho. It seems fitting in a way.”
Blaise swallows. "He doesn't want to see you."
“See you then.” Harry agrees easily, stepping out.
“I will not make a fool of myself alone, thank you very much. If you’re with me it make might the whole thing slightly more bearable.”
“Fuck.” Draco exhales and something deep in Harry clenches at the word dripping from Draco’s tongue. “Do you know how long I’ve been imaging what your dorm looks like? What your bed must look like?”
That only reminds him of the almost-argument that Harry and Mother had earlier though so Draco pushes those thoughts away to focus back on Harry, who is looking at him tightly.
“It’s not a game. It’s not- this isn’t me picking a side so that we can climb in society, Mother. I genuinely agree with what Potter and the others think now. I’ve changed my mind.”
Ginny shrugs, looking unconcerned. “He was practically giving the money away by betting me, how could I refuse?”
With that Harry grips Draco’s hips and without waiting pushes back in roughly, slamming home and then pulling out again to repeat the action.
Blaise nods. “You’re right there. They love Draco more than anything.”
“Ready to lose?” The Slytherin calls, making the team standing in a loose semi-circle behind him all cheer.
Their conversation devolves from laughing at how quickly Ron eats to throwing pieces of carrot at Seamus and Dean who are stealing kisses at the table. Ginny finally aims a subtle hex at the two of them, making them slide three feet apart on the bench and toppling over everybody nearby, making the rest of the Gryffindors break out into laughter.
“They better not be!” Pansy says with wicked glee. “Because we’re about to play spin the bottle.”
The witch does so and soon the Headmistress is stepping through the fire, smoothing out her deep purple robes as she does so and looking around.
Harry nods and avoids everyone's eyes as he makes his way back to Ron and Hermione.
Draco shakes his head. "So tonight we're all going out for drinks, I assume? To celebrate?" He moves to go back to his letter, dipping the quill in the ink pot before beginning to write again.
It’s only moments later that he gets the one-word reply.
“You’re going to kill me.” Draco breathes out eventually, leaning their foreheads against one another. “I always knew you would, somehow, but I never imagined it would be like this.”
But even when Draco had been distracted during Pansy and Blaise’s cold war he’d still known about and felt the weight of it. He’d still hated it and what it had done to them all.
He blinks in surprise. “Oh.”
He clears his throat and delicately picks the paper up by the corner, staring at the picture and trying not to give anything away with his facial expression. He expects he fails.
But there's an all-consuming tightening in his stomach that twinges painfully at the sight of the picture, so he knows, if he's being honest to himself, that that's not right.
“It seems like all of Great Britain knows that.” Draco mutters, surly, making Harry kick him under the table.
Even Ron, who Draco has always thought of as easy to wind up, is calm as anything.
She leaves them standing beside one another, Harry startled at the abrupt departure and Blaise smiling widely.
“Upstairs.” Harry murmurs.
“Well.” Harry shrugs. “Technically I was only invited because Hermione let it slip by accident.”
“I told you I wouldn’t pressure you to do anything you didn’t want to. And I won’t. That’s not what
The worst thing, the hardest thing, is that Harry had forgotten just how much he
“Here.” Draco gestures between them. “You mean the two of us now? In bed together?”
It will not happen again. Draco’s guard is up stronger than ever. He won’t let it happen again.
“Why not?”
“No I- I didn’t know he and Hagrid were even speaking.”
but that he isn’t stunning either because he is pale and skinny and pointy, looks up at Harry and knows that the other boy means it. Somehow Harry Potter honestly thinks he is something to look at. More than that, he thinks everybody is out there slavering over Draco.
They pretend that Eighth Year and all that happened in those ten months never existed.
the mess in a second, hopefully avoiding any stains or smells.
“He’s also a
“Mmm.” He agrees, still staring at the white porcelain and drain. A drop of water falls from his chin. “This isn’t completely new territory. We both want it.” Then he catches him self and looks up in the mirror, in time to feel Harry come up and stand behind him. “You do want to, right?”
The others, Slytherin kids in particular, are frantically writing notes, hissing questions to one another and trying to keep up. Trying to make sense of the words that Draco assumes must be English that are coming from their professor’s mouth but are making no bloody sense at all to him.
His hands clench. His mouth dries. His mind blanks.
She looks at him. “Really?”
“Come to bed with me,” Harry mumbles against his lips before kissing him all over again and Draco’s gut is flooded with heat.
He holds the woman's stare. "Anything else?"
He waits and Harry glances over before turning to take a few steps closer to the lake and sinking down to sit closer to the water’s edge. Blaise follows suit and settles beside him a moment later.
He tries to think of what he can do, of what would make him feel better, and he isn’t happy with the answer his brain supplies.
Then dessert is cleared and someone is up on stage announcing the award and his mother is beaming at him. His stomach is twisting a bit in anticipation, but mostly he’s going over his speech again and again in his head, trying to make a mental list of everybody he has to thank.
“If I can’t look like this, you definitely shouldn’t be allowed to look like that.” Draco says softly in a hush before stroking Harry’s cheek. “That’s the kind of expression that would make anyone fall in love with you, you know.”
“Go, Harry.” Draco looks down at the floor and snatches up his trousers, tugging them on before he turns away as if he can’t bear to even look at him. “Please.”
a cushion, sitting down with a smile.
“Are you mad? Angry? Annoyed?”
Even seeing the Dark Mark, something Harry had somehow forgotten was inked on Draco’s skin, in the showers hadn’t been enough for him to ignore how Malfoy was actually quite nice looking.
A Ravenclaw shifts to interrupt his line of sight and Draco glances away quickly. The last thing he needs is for someone to kick up a fuss about him being obsessed with Potter. They’d probably all think he was plotting against him just because he looked in his direction the first day of school.
Soon Harry’s stomach is beginning to growl and Hagrid cuts off. “Ah, I’ve kept you both too long, haven’t I? It’ll be time for dinner now.”
some of the sexiest things I’ve ever seen.” Pansy is talking animatedly with expressive hand gestures.
“I thought I was the one getting you off?” Draco murmurs against his lips and Harry smiles, tracing Draco’s cheek lightly with his clean hand.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asks in surprise before he seems to catch himself while snapping Harry out of his thoughts in time to see his expression closing. “Er, I haven’t found anything useful yet. Still working on it.”
Finally Harry opens his mouth to speak, but Blaise just shakes his head. He wants nothing less in the world than to hear Harry plead with him.
“Are so. And no, by the way, because I already know the outcome.”
Harry takes him in standing there, half behind the door, tone slightly hopeful, mostly apologetic, and somehow all of his anger and pent up emotion from the day leaches out of him steadily to be replaced with calm.
He watches as she gets up from where she’s sitting with her friends across the library and makes her way over to their group. For a second she meets Draco’s eyes and her expression twists in dislike, making Draco frown back at her.
? No!” Ron sounds so frustrated Harry can only stare up in shock as he leaps from the chair, apparently giving up some sort of mission. “No, Harry I don’t have anything to tell you. But if I
Draco winks at the younger sister. “I’ll tell you later, Gin.”
“There was one other bet.” Hermione says to Draco and Harry as they ignore the married couple. “Ron and I did join that one.”
in his office.” Harry explains. “Snape gave me enough memories of him and Mum that I would trust him. I saw them as kids, saw him coming to Dumbledore to ask him to protect her. He only cared about me after Voldemort killed her. And then his memories told me what I had to do.”
“-and the food’s ready for tonight. The band’s not arriving until later, but we have tea and sandwiches for the afternoon until the dinner and reception. Ginny’s upstairs with the girls getting ready but from what Molly’s told me everything’s coming along nicely.”
“Do what?”
“We-” Harry starts, about to tell her that they only just got here, but Pansy interrupts.
“Me too,” Draco says.
After that the lot of them split up. A few go to the library together to do homework and a couple of others head for a walk around the lake.
“Stop.” Draco grumbles, squeezing his eyes closed and then groaning in pain because even that makes his head pound. “Hangover potion?”
“I’m not mad.” Harry shakes his head. All the years with the Dursley’s and he’d only glimpsed a photo of his grandparents once, where it stood in Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon’s bedroom. He’d been forbidden from ever going in there for as long as he can remember and Petunia had never spoken of them. “I never would have thought- the way she acted over the years I just assumed she’d gotten rid of anything to do with her.”
“Oh no,” Hermione says quietly. “I knew it.”
Harry blinks. “What?”
There's smut. There's angst. There's a mood/ tonal shift that I'm not entirely happy with but am too lazy to work around. And it all wraps up with some happy fluff.
“I was coming right back,” he defends himself and then holds out the mountain of clothing in his arms to Harry. “Take your pick.”
Things have only been like this for five years but Harry is beginning to grow impatient with it. He’s begun to try and think of ways to improve their situation. He’s even started wondering whether they could all just move in to Hogwarts, or build a house near the grounds like Hagrid, but he supposes it wouldn’t help all that much.
Draco looks up at her. “I hope they’re alright.”
“It is.” Draco says firmly.
"Oh, Harry." Hermione's voice is so sad Harry squeezes his eyes shut harder, trying to block it out.
Draco hesitates only a moment before stepping towards Harry to hug him. The other boy stiffens in surprise before resting his forehead against Draco’s shoulder and relaxing.
“After you.” Draco allows graciously and Harry smirks.
“Excuse me?”
“I understand why you think that.” His voice is shaking and Harry feels his chest squeeze painfully at the sound. “And yesterday I would have agreed with you. But before I leave I’m going to tell you everything and then, only after that, if you still feel the same way I’ll respect your decision. Merlin knows you’re entitled to it.”
A stage is across the room with a live band and everyone is dressed in their nicest dress robes, dresses or suits. Kingsley and his husband are walking around together greeting everybody and generally playing the role of the hosts. Neville and Luna are dancing and so are Ron and Hermione while Harry is trying to politely end his current conversation with the Head of the Mysteries Department but spectacularly failing.
Harry’s gaze then softened. “It will be nice to see Teddy too. I’ve missed him.”
“Come on, Draco!” Pansy calls suddenly, and when the four of them turn they see everyone in the room is now seated on the couches, chairs or cushions. “We’re playing!”
“You did that wandlessly before,” Harry murmurs as they lie back against Draco’s sheets and Draco frowns, trying to remember.
"I reckon Hermione's right, just like always." Harry replies, not knowing why he's so fed up with the topic of the Malfoy's and whether or not Draco's on the train. He feels like all he’s heard all summer is gossip about the Malfoy’s. It’s almost getting as annoying as the gossip he hears about himself. "Can we talk about something else?"
Draco stops, and swallows. "Poor you, one House out of four doesn't love you. Not even a full House either, because the younger years trail after you like lost puppies, don’t think I've not noticed that."
“Shut up.” Draco groans, face in his hands. “The last thing we need is Mother seeing us having sex.”
“No.” Harry says shaking his head, thinking quickly. “No, I never said anything. Neither did he.”
And with that Blaise slams the door behind him and Draco finally lets his head hang, holding it in his hands.
Time ticks by. People slowly trickle away in twos and threes. Hermione and Ron leave first, followed by Luna and Neville and Theo and Millie. Pansy goes shortly after.
Draco’s hands cup his face and roughly his lips close the small distance between them.
“Of course,” he replies in surprise, though he has a strong suspicion of what this will be about.
Draco leans in too, closing the gap between them to less than a foot now. “It wasn’t a joke about the war, Harry. It was a joke about myself. And a bit about you, always following me around and trying to figure out what I was up to.” Draco’s voice falls further. “Some might say you had a bit of a crush on me.”
Muggles curse around him and they hurry their steps, ducking their heads and holding their jackets closed tighter around their throats as they move in steady streams, Harry a break in their midst. The few who had thought to check the weather forecast and bring umbrellas now open them eagerly. Soon the pavement beneath all of their feet is dark with moisture and as Harry holds out a hand the rain hit it strongly.
“Save it.” Draco’s laughing at him. “Salazar I can’t believe you. How many people have you told?”
Harry would probably have been able to tamp it all down if it hadn’t been for the fact that he knows, deep in his core, that Draco is feeling it all too.
Harry misreads his silence and looks down as sudden doubt creeps in, scuffing a show against the stone floor. “It’s not too bad. Besides the two of us can spend most of it together. Since there’s barely anyone left most of the rules about house division goes out the window. I know we don’t have classes everyday but it’s not boring, I swear-”
Both of their faces soften. “Love you too,” Ron says and then Harry nods and goes out the door. It closes softly behind him and he walks down the steps out their front gate and onto the sidewalk.
“We both made mistakes.” Harry says quickly. “But that’s all sorted now.”
Draco sniffs the collar slowly, looking curious and nervous of what he’ll discover. Harry’s lips twitch at the relieved look on his face. “Smells fine, at least. Though it’d be nicer if it smelled like you.”
It would be true, Draco tells himself later, if it didn’t hurt so much.
Harry grins.
Harry nods determinedly. “I want to say-”
Something passes between her and Blaise in the look they share and Blaise smiles, looking happier and more relieved than before. “Brilliant.”
Draco stops dead and Harry almost collides with his back before he steps up to stand beside him on the landing of the seventh floor.
Harry’s sad to go in the end but the thought of seeing Hermione and the Weasleys helps. The younger students wave them off at the bottom of the staircase before Harry and Draco head to McGonagall’s office to meet her.
“Arthur,” he says in reply, trying to hold back a laugh. “How are you and Molly today?”
They manage to snag a few more drinks in the half hour they’re there and then they join their friends for a bit with Harry trying to catch his breath.
“Just because you like what’s in my pants doesn’t make me a good person.”
Ron glances at Harry, who makes a pleading face to him, before looking back at Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes close slowly and he leans his head back against the wall. He releases a small sigh, as if in surrender. “I couldn’t let you
For Draco to stand there in front of everybody, in front of the reporters- who had splashed the speech all over all of the papers by the next day, of course- and their friends, in front of his mum, had been very brave of him. Harry knows what Draco’s like and he knows that for Draco that was big.
and Aunt Bella finished the job so that took some time. I read a lot. Cried sometimes. Occasionally I went down to the basement where they kept the prisoners but- but not often. Mostly I just tried to avoid him and everyone else.”
“Oh Harry there you are. How was your visit?” Molly looks up from setting the table to smile as he walks inside, and try as he might, Harry can’t seem to force his lips up to answer it.
She bites her lip lightly before taking a deep breath and reaching out to take his hands. Her warm eyes hold his, searching him for something he doesn’t know. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Something like,
“Goodnight.” He’d called and with one last forced smile she’d left.
They go to sleep in the Slytherin dorms that night. Lydia watches them play chess in the Common Room for a while before begging a few rounds of Exploding Snap off of them. Eventually though she gives in to her yawns and goes to bed.
“No actually.” Harry shifts. “Look, I’ll tell you some other time. Now you really should get back.”
Her lips are pursed as she looks between them all, again seeming to have a silent conversation with Arthur, before nodding firmly. “Fine.”
“No you can’t.” Draco says with a tone that brooks no argument. “I can take you. It isn’t an issue.”
Without thinking he’d whipped out his own wand, opening his mouth to cast a Shield charm, knowing it would be too late.
“But you should be sure Blaise.” Draco meets his brown eyes seriously, searching for any sign of doubt. He finds none. “If you really like her then I think you should, but you have to be careful. I don’t want you to get hurt again. And none of us want a repeat of what happened with you and Pansy.”
“Well-”
“It’s not good.” Blaise finishes.
But eventually Draco comes to miss him. It’s inconvenient that he can’t discuss their problems with anybody else because it makes Harry the one person he can go to. It doesn’t help that Harry has become the person he most wants to go to for comfort anyway, even though Harry is the problem in the first place.
“Yeah.” Draco shakes his head. “Merlin,” his voice is soft and he inspects the cloak once more before finally throwing it over himself. “Well?”
“Fine.”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Ron sighs, and Ginny nods. Padma and Parvati look thoroughly relieved.
Malfoy doesn’t know why, but he waves. And he’s stupidly happy when Harry waves back before he finally turns around and starts to walk away.
“Oh no.” Ron groans and drops his face into his hands as Harry and Hermione begin to smile widely. “You git, don’t say it. You didn’t.”
“Harry!” Hermione calls, but he doesn’t look back and actually breaks into a run once he passes the doors.
Hermione smiles a bit in what might be relief.
Luna looks at them curiously. "I don't know." She says as if the thought has just occurred to her. "We've never really discussed it."
He has no idea.
“Hold on, but you both have with other people, haven’t you?” Blaise presses.
“I want to ask you something.” She faces him so suddenly he nearly twitches in surprise. Instead he just waits for her to go on. “And I want to make it clear that I’m not- I’m not asking for your permission, or anything like that. But you’re my friend, Harry, one of my best friends, and I care about you and what you think, and I know you’ll tell me the truth-”
“Come on.” He practically whispers, jerking his head as footsteps grow audible in the distance of some passing younger students. “Let’s go.”
Since Hogwarts Draco has done much better than he'd thought he would.
It shakes him, the realization that Hogwarts might be as important, as essential to somebody else as it is for him. Draco’s loved this castle since before he even got his letter. The first time his father had brought him to tour Hogwarts’ halls Draco had been six and it had been one of the best days of his life.
“It was only three years ago,” Ron mutters, making Draco and Blaise grin at him.
Potter’s face settles in realization, quickly followed by embarrassment. “Oh.”
Harry suspects his hands had done that.
“You never got to know him did you?” He asks because he can’t help it. Draco’s eyes shoot up nervously.
“Not sure. The others left sometime after twelve, so I’d guess almost one?”
"No." Harry answers her finally. "I saved his life in the Battle of Hogwarts." Harry looks down, smelling ash and smoke, seeing
Blaise sighs. “Why do you insist on calling her that? You’re going to give both her and Ron hives, apparently only their mother uses her full name and it’s usually when she’s cross.”
Funny. Draco’s always been desperate for attention like that. Even if it only came from association, he’d always used his connection to Harry (limited though it may have been as just a classmate) to get his time in the limelight.
"What?" Harry asks, and bless him, he sounds so confused. "What are you-"
wouldn’t be one. Not that I’ll ever likely find out.”
“Will that be all, mistress?”
“Oh come off it!” Harry calls and he’s too loud and his cheeks are flushed and his eyes bright and Draco can’t look away, can’t stop his lips from twitching even as they argue. “You went on and on about how you were so in pain from three little scratches-”
Harry looks at Draco one last time but the wizard is now busy reading his book and taking notes. Harry’s disappointment is sharp and he pushes away from the table. “Well if we’re done talking about my love life I’m going to take a break. I’ve had enough studying for a while.”
“As if these Malfoy genes are anything less than pure perfection-”
Of course it’s when he excuses himself to the bathroom to sit in a stall, head in his hands and breathing deeply to stop his rampaging thoughts that Harry actually does turn up. Even better that they meet at the bar, taking Draco completely off guard and making him act like a complete fool. Harry had probably taken one look at his frozen state and realized he’d had a lucky escape back in Eighth Year.
Draco falters. “I-”
“Hello, Harry.” Luna catches Harry coming back from Hagrid’s hut two days before Halloween. “How are you?”
Draco forgets whatever he's been about to say. For a second he forgets everything and all he can think is oh, there's a pair of lips on mine.
“Yes, sir.” Draco tries to say, closing his eyes when it comes out as more of a whisper.
“Why not?” Harry shrugs. “It’s not you and you could help me pick out a present.”
“You’ll hear no complaints from me.” Ron replies. “Harry?”
He sounds more nervous now and Draco looks at him closely to make sure Blaise’s eyes really are closed, because despite how tired he is he sounds serious. This question is coming from a boy whose mother was married over seven times, Draco remembers, and even though Blaise does’t talk about that much Draco knows it has impacted him.
“How’s that?”
“I do live here you know,” she looks at him impatiently but walks at his side. “But I was outside playing Quidditch with the others.” She gives him a significant look. “Dad was not-so-subtly trying to ask whether we weren’t leaving for a secret date today, seeing as I’m visiting Luna and you’re going to Draco’s.”
Again they let the minutes tick past in silence and for most of it Draco watches Harry. He’s calmer now, Draco can tell, and whatever turmoil he’d been feeling seems to have been wiped away with the help of Draco’s words.
Draco huffs out laughter. “Did you scare them on purpose?”
“He hasn’t been giving you trouble, has he?”
Harry nods absently. “I am going, yeah. Andromeda roped me into helping her set everything up.”
?” Draco repeats, his voice icy. “I know exactly how that feels, as it happens, since I have to watch people fall over themselves to fawn all over you. I thought this morning made it perfectly clear how easy it is to
“I know they love Draco.” Harry says finally. “But that’s the only redeemable thing I really know about either of them.”
When they sober up only the Slytherins are left in the room, and Theo is carrying a practically purring Pansy. Millie opens the door for them, leading the trio out.
“I know what you mean.” Draco looks put upon, making Harry smile. “It’s really mucked it all up hasn’t it? We can never go back to our rivalry now.”
“It hasn’t been too bad yet.” Draco hands off Ron to his fiancée, ignoring the way Ron immediately snuggles into her, placing his face in the crook of her neck. “You’ll be alright with him?”
“You know the rest after that.” Draco shrugged. “The
“Shh.” Draco says. “Just- don’t talk.”
That problem, as usual, ties back to Draco Malfoy.
Harry pushed forward that much more, now pressing his own chest against Draco's and feeling his warm breath on his lips. "Tell me, Draco."
“Thank you,” he says, moving to hug her again, which she returns fiercely. “Thank you.”
A few of them look a bit sheepish but Blaise’s eyes are narrowed, obviously not buying Draco’s fervent denials. “I don’t know. You were gone for so long, maybe they just walked in on you after you were finished.”
“Definitely not,” Draco scoffs and Harry tries not to let it show that the words wound him.
The words snap Harry out of his brief daydream and he meets Draco’s eyes again as they lie facing each other once more. “A few minutes.”
He swallows and his eyes find Harry’s. The other boy is still grinning and the expression on his face is so open that for a second Draco forgets they aren’t back at Hogwarts and Harry isn’t his best friend. His resolve wavers for a second before a sudden bout of courage fills him and he decides to add a bit to his speech that he hadn’t originally intended to.
"Oh. Erm," Potter scrambles. "Today. Later. I don't care. Whenever you want."
It lifts the tension and she laughs again, though something in her eyes suddenly makes Harry wonder if his teasing words aren’t a little bit true. Not that he thinks Ginny still wants to be with him, he knows she doesn’t and that they’re far better as friends.
“Oh.” Understanding makes him feel unbelievably stupid. And self-centered. “Ron, is this about you? Do you want to tell me something? To, um. Talk it out?”
Draco’s mouth twists and he knows he’s given away too much.
“Not that that’s an issue. Far be it from me to judge anyone. It’s just…” he’s staring at Harry stunned. “You just never seemed like the type.”
“This is Draco we’re talking about mate.” Ron speaks up. “He’s never dealt with things well. He lashes out. We’ve known this since First Year. But he’s trying, any of us could see it.”
“I-” He begins but Harry cuts him off.
"Just say no, would you?" She asks him, slightly pleading, moving to sit in the nearest chair and taking off a shoe to rub her heel. "And join me for a drink. My feet are bloody killing me."
It’s a strange mix of emotions going through Draco as he slips into bed that night. The regret is there, heavier than ever, but there’s wistfulness and excitement for his friend and a bit of joy, a bit of hope all mixed in there too. It takes him a long time to fall asleep.
“Know what? That you can see yourself marrying him?”
“Harry.”
“That’s what I mean, you keep your gifts for you. Now, let’s go so I can put this present down, hmm?”
“What’s your news?” He asks, unable to wait any longer and Draco’s smile widens.
Draco rolls his eyes, starting to walk again and pushing down the mix of emotion inside of him. He can sort it all out later. “And the reason I didn’t invite you to the party,” he says, not looking Potter’s way. “It’s not because I don’t consider you… that. It’s because I already knew you were going.”
Sure the two of them are committed now, but what happens in a week? A month? Once they’ve graduated?
“I’m just saying, if you’ve never done this before you don’t really know-”
Blaise’s brown eyes turn soft with understanding. Sympathy fills in every crack of his expression. “Oh, Draco. Don’t tell me you love him.”
“It’s perfect Molly, thank you.” Blaise clasps her hands and smiles down at the frazzled woman. “We’re just looking around but I think we’re ready for guests to come, aren’t we Draco?”
“Meaning?”
And that makes him nervous. Because he’s been surprised before about his parents and how deeply they believed in something he disagreed with. If this turns out to be the same…
Another fond look from McGonagall before she’s facing the two of them, lips pursed. “Very well. I am happy that things are changing. And I’d hoped, judging from your year, that the other students were following suit. But it never hurts to check.
He’d immediately tensed and tried to pull his hand away, but her grip had tightened enough to be painful and kept her hold. “Why wouldn’t I?”
Draco swallows.
“Me too.”
Then there’s kisses on his neck and Draco’s eyes fly open just in time to find Harry standing in shock and staring at him and the man (Draco hasn’t even looked at his face, for Merlin’s sake) with only a couple of people in between.
Hermione studies Harry now before shrugging. "Alright then."
Which leaves wandering the Manor until he finds a tap to drink from.
“Well, well.” Pansy says, her eyes gleaming. “And so the two Houses meet, lip-lock, and don’t end up killing each other. Look at the progress we’re making.”
, and it's the sympathy on his face that drives everything home for Harry. Blaise
“I don’t know,” Draco says with forced lightness, mind racing to try and figure out what Harry could have been about to say. “I thought this was a pretty interesting- umph.”
Harry clears his throat. “Nice friends you have.”
“Good. Really good. Um.”
He sees Harry swallow. “Good thing I only save it for you then.”
, Potter.”
She stops her idle floating and whooshes right up to him, hovering so that she’s staring down at him by a few inches. “Oh yes, why would it matter? Stupid old Myrtle, why should she care what happens here? Even if she is trapped here forever, at least she’s already dead!”
Draco sneers even as he stumbles back with his arms hanging at his sides. "Hurt me, Potter? What makes you think you were so important?"
He loves it when they're all together best, though, whether it's for a movie night or to go out drinking. These are his family and he loves his little group of people. It makes him happier when they're happy, and as he stops getting hurt and partying crazily with strangers so much, they seem to be more content too.
Draco nods. “I have that Potions essay to finish.”
Teddy lets out a peal of laughter and Harry watches him change his hair from its regular colour to green and red, causing Harry to grin and Draco to let out a noise of surprise.
“I was giving him his Secret Santa gift.” Draco answers finally, staring up at them both and feeling remarkably overwhelmed as they loom overhead.
So they go. Harry leads Draco to the Room of Requirement, “
For some reason the signature is what makes Draco’s tears fall. His father has always signed his letters as just that:
“Draco!” Hermione appears out of no where, drawing both of their attention. “Where have you been?”
“Don’t be daft.” He says softly, surprised at how touched he is by the fact Harry actually took his hand. “You think some bad press can scare away a Malfoy? You still have too much to learn from me for me to give up on you now.”
Draco shrugs one shoulder, looking back at Harry. “I suppose. It was… really complicated, looking back on it. Especially after finding out he was working for Dumbledore the whole time.”
He stops beside his bed, takes one look at Draco and the haphazardly packed trunk and raises an eyebrow. "You're being an idiot."
Luna and Neville also come sometimes (another thing Draco had never thought to see was Ravenclaws Common Room, apparently this is the year for surprises), but they just showed up when they felt like it.
Harry snorts and Draco nudges him in the side pointedly while Hermione rolls her eyes at them before she focuses on the cup in Harry’s hand. “By the way, Harry, who gave you that drink? I know we’re supposed to be pacing ourselves but I’d like one.”
His eyes can’t help but be drawn back to Harry and he manages to catch a sight of the unruly hair and find him clapping harder than anyone around him. He’s grinning and this time he definitely notices Draco looking because his face grows into a wide and bright smile that makes Draco’s nerves disappear.
Harry had liked his gift.
His breath catches. “What?”
Harry’s lips thin and go white as he presses them together before answering. “Because I’m a Halfblood. Like he was.”
There’s only so much Harry’s heart can take and that seems to be the limit. Instead of walking down the Malfoy’s driveway backwards like he’s tempted to do, just to keep Draco in his sights, he turns and strides away purposefully.
And Smith had walked past as Harry gaped at Malfoy, wand out, while Malfoy had stopped, realizing Harry wasn’t following, to turn and raise an eyebrow.
"I had this vision while growing up- you and I, best friends. You'd adore me of course and I would teach you all about the wizarding world and we'd handle anything that came our way. Even later, during school, sometimes I used to imagine the two of us saving my family from the Dark- from Voldemort. Then we'd save the world. But as a kid… I didn’t even know you and I had all these ideas."
She gives him a slightly shaky smile before excusing herself to go upstairs, leaving Harry and Draco alone to walk out.
But he does remember Hermione’s screams from Malfoy Manor and whatever slightly warm feelings he’s begun feeling around Malfoy, the excitement at their banter, it fades.
Harry’s expression goes tender in an instant and he reaches a hand out. “Come here.”
But it will get better.
That particular morning Pansy isn’t speaking to Blaise or Theo, which means she is only talking to Draco and Millie. Which means she’s making a very pointed effort to talk loudly, quickly and nonstop to Draco and Millie so that the boys will notice she’s not talking to them.
"Of course, Potter." Draco rolls his eyes and wonders if he imagines the hurt in the green eyes at the use of last names once more. "I needed something to make sure I would survive this year unscathed by your hundreds of fans. Do you know how many threats we received at the Manor this summer? Mother told me I'd have to be careful, to protect myself, and what better protection than the Boy Who Lived?"
“Draco.” Her reprimand isn’t quite a scold but it is verging on it and he waves her away.
“Good.” Ron says. “Now I can look at him and-”
They stop and stand together outside the disappearing door, neither of them looking at each other.
He hears his name from Thelonius’ lips and the walk up to the stage is shakier than he would have liked but he makes it safely without embarrassing himself.
But if they do that… it means more attention. Press and publicity, people following them around once they leave Hogwarts. Constant scrutiny. Draco remembers the articles and Howlers from when people outside of school had found out they were just
Blaise shrugs. “Soon, I think. She said she’d be here about an hour before the ceremony? That must be close.”
“Sure.” He replies after a beat. “Um, milk and sugar please.”
There is only them, taking all the time they want. Exploring one another like they haven’t in years, unhurried and taking the chance to notice any differences or remember forgotten pleasures.
He stands and the two of them do the same. “I’m going to get out of your hair. And- and think about things, for a bit. But I’ll visit as soon as it’s all sorted.” He offers a small smile. “You’re both the best, you know that?”
She nods. “They really would. You’ve become such a mature and kind young man. And after everything you’ve been through, the things you’ve lost…”
But soon even Ginny knows she should head back, especially since her curfew is before the rest of theirs and all of them have broken it. She shoots a small smile at Harry and he smiles back as she and Blaise leave.
“No, Theo.” Hermione says. “We promised.”
He sees Harry smile a bit. “I did a bit too I suppose. Not that I realized at the time.”
He pulls Draco down to hover over him and their lips meet softly. Everything is quiet and warm and Draco’s heart is beating loudly from the countless emotions bursting their way out of his chest.
Draco laughs. “See? An owl wouldn’t do that.”
This case is Harry’s and it’s starting to become a big one. The M.O is victims being attacked outside of pubs or night clubs before they are usually dragged to a nearby alley,
“I can tell you’re upset.”
“So all this talk about what we’ve done to each other and the past… let’s just forget it, alright? We know what we’ve done to each other. We’ve lived that part of our lives. I’d much rather move on and live the rest now if you all don’t mind.”
“Tell me if you want me to stop, alright?” Draco leans down to gently kiss him. “We’re not going to do… that. But I’d like to get you off.”
Maybe Harry will panic and say yes. Maybe he’ll
“Do you really think so?” Blaise asks her. “You can just… put it behind you, rationalize it all, just like that?”
“Where are you going?”
He shrugs, looking embarrassed. “Luna did it.”
A Slytherin knows how to pick his battles, and Blaise is no exception. He also knows when Draco's being a git, and when he's likely to stop.
Draco’s face warms a bit. “Maybe you will.”
It’s stupid things, simple things. things that nobody else probably even notices. Things like the way Draco eats fruit or a simple muffin for breakfast because he’s never particularly hungry in the hours immediately after waking up, a fact that Harry stores away and takes pains to remember. Draco expands his Shield Charms to encompass their entire friend group just in case some arsehole is feeling particularly stupid that day and begging for almost half of the Eighth Years to come down on them in Draco’s defense.
, of all things.
Harry meets her eyes. "I know who he is, Hermione."
Harry leans in to see a small rose bloom better. “What was the occasion?”
all they are.”
“Forget it,” the Gryffindor keeps walking even though Draco’s stopped. “It’s just a stupid party.”
“Ah, never took ye to be the modest sort, Malfoy.” He turns back to Harry. “An’ then I noticed he was hanging around you, Ron and Hermione, Harry, and I thought well blimey, looks like he meant it after all. So when he came and asked for some help with that Christmas present o’ yours I told him our secret about ol’ Witherwings. Right surprised at that, weren’t ya Draco?”
(It’s a lie.)
He’d made promises and he’s going to stick to them. That is that. He’ll be a brilliant Auror- everyone already tells him so.
. It’s not possible to see the things we did and come out of it the same. Not if there’s a shred of decency left in you.”
The next room over maybe? It’s one room that they use for brewing, but then wouldn’t the smell have reached the hallway?
“You know.” Harry doesn’t, in fact, seem to know. “Us working together. Being friendly.”
Draco lets the façade fall. “Made you laugh though.”
Ginny’s long red hair has been curled and pinned up in a low knot at the back left of her head, with a braid running from the front to wind throughout the design. A few flowers are tucked in as well. She has small ruby droplet earrings and a matching necklace, and her dress is a V-necked white lace design that flares out past her hips.
“I was just going to say your mum might not like me being there.”
“I’m not going to wait for you. I don’t want us to be the thing that haunts me anymore. I’m going to move on now and I’m sorry it took this long to get here but from now on I want there to be nothing between us. At the end of the day nothing’s changed since Hogwarts and that will always keep us apart. You’ll keep running and I’ll always let you because I think it’s what you want until you come back.
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to say it.”
“Take these off,” he orders against Harry’s lips, tugging at the soaked robes. Now that he’s thinking about it, the front of his clothes are wet as well and he pulls away, looking down at the large damp spot running down his body.
He goes off on a tangent about a baby griffin he’d traded for over the summer and had to hand over to Magical Animal Protection and Services at the insistence of McGonagall. Harry and Draco sit through it all, nodding politely when required and drinking their tea to fill in the time. Then Hagrid gets on to asking about Ron and Hermione and even politely inquiring after the Eighth Year Slytherins before Harry finishes his tea and sets the empty mug on the table beside Draco’s.
him, is what he did, and then he did it some more in front of Lestrange! Just because my wife was a squib. My poor son, my poor boy-"
“I’m glad you like it,” the blonde says softly, voice barely above a whisper.
If he throws himself in harm's way more often than anybody else it's no one's problem, because Ron's always got his back. Besides, people seem to expect it of him at this point anyway. It's like they think he's lived his entire life believing he's not worth taking care of (since they’d all always known he'd been most likely to die young) that it's not as big of a deal for him compared to the other Aurors. He's used to it. To always be the first into battle, trying to save everybody else, putting himself on the line. That’s what he was raised to do. When he doesn't think things through the way he maybe should have, he always still gets the perp, even if the victory comes along with Head Auror Robards chewing his head off for putting the people around him and himself in danger while Harry's laying in St. Mungo's. But even that's only for the benefit of others. In private even Robards will congratulate Harry on a risk worth taking and a successful mission.
Harry pulls his hand away from Draco's touch and places it over his chest, where his heart beats. "I think I do know." He says, feeling the steady pulse of Draco's heart under his palm. "Because every day since Hogwarts I've spent missing you."
To be honest, out of all of their newfound group, Theo is the one he knows the least. Neither of them are the most vocal of people. All Harry really knows about him is that his dad was a Death Eater and he and Pansy are in a very public relationship.
So far it hasn’t happened.)
“There’s not much to say really,” he starts, because- well there is, but not anything that Blaise needs to know. “We became friends and then we became more than that.”
He remembers Zabini being the one to finally convince him that everything was over. That Draco hadn't- that Harry had been made a fool of.
He looks at her sharply. "Ginny-"
“Jesus,” Ron shakes his head. “As if I needed any more evidence that I have all the brains in this group. And the family.”
The House division at Hogwarts is exhausting. And he’s tired enough already.
But then, a quiet confession comes in the dark room.
For now Draco takes a deep breath and then another, wondering if he’s going to have a panic attack. He’s had them before, and if anything would trigger one, trying to rationalize what had happened last night seems like the very thing.
There is a round of agreements and a rush to the table piled with gifts before they all sit down again. This time Harry is between Ginny and Luna and he tries not to be disappointed when Draco finally sits down across from him on one of the chairs.
your parents will finally say no to something you want? That’s ridiculous.”
?” Draco interrupts him in surprise.
“Potions book,” Blaise supplies, sounding far too chipper. His eyes are hard though and it’s then that it clocks what exactly his friend is doing. “Help me find it.”
Both of them step forward to press their lips together at the same time.
She blushes in the strange way ghosts did. “Maybe a bit. They better get used to it. I’m not nearly as bad as Peeves.”
They spend that night in Draco’s dorm and he has to admit that seeing Harry on his bed looking tired and lax is doing something to him that he’d rather not look at too closely. Surely people aren’t supposed to go around feeling like this all the time?
For the split second before their mouths touch Harry is suddenly reminded of his kiss with Cho. But then he actually kisses Malfoy and his own tears don’t matter anymore. The ache in Harry’s chest is replaced with a hunger and he completely stops crying.
“Except Draco.” Harry butts in, making Draco’s head snap towards him and his eyes narrow in a glare. “He’s still being hexed in the halls.”
“Oh there you all are!” Arthur Weasley’s voice carries to them and Draco whips his head up in time to see where Arthur has spotted Harry appear with Ginny, Luna, Neville and Pansy and Theo. The last two make Arthur flounder a bit. “Erm, we were just saying you’ll all have to get on the train soon.”
The blonde trails off before continuing and Harry sits, enraptured. He can picture it, the two of them. If things had been different... he can see it. If he had chosen Slytherin instead of Gryffindor maybe.
Draco moves his lips from where they’ve been at Harry’s ear back to his lips. “You want to stop?”
Blaise whistles lowly. “Well that display wasn’t for nothing, Draco.”
A short and sweet chapter today! I may post two chapters next week because I'd like to finish this up before my school semester starts.
Draco frowns. “Why would you be nervous?”
Andromeda blinks, seemingly coming back to herself a bit. “Teddy, thank Draco for these lovely gifts please.”
He gasps and then as Harry licks again, slightly deeper, he stretches out, forgetting to hold his head up to talk. Another lick and he’s panting, the next one makes him push back, desperate for more. And then there’s nothing held back anymore and Draco can feel Harry in such a way it makes his back arch and eyes roll back slightly.
"-due to the complete lack of knowledge on the subject from most of our students and their families, I have decided one year of Muggle Studies is mandatory for all students before they graduate. The prejudice from earlier years must be rectified and the Ministry and I see this as a reasonable compromise and first step. All Third Years will be required to take Muggle Studies as a compulsory course from here on out, and all older students will be taking it this year as well, if they have not already done so in earlier years. The opportunity for previous students remains to continue their education in the course as usual.”
“After school.” Pansy admits. “You were both really angry and we vowed not to ask about it.”
“We might have broken up.”
“Yes.” Harry said and had finally looked back at him. “If you really mean it I’ll come. It will be nice to see you over the holidays.”
“That’s true.” Harry says, wondering what time Draco and the other Slytherins are planning on showing up to the Christmas party that night. He hadn’t thought to ask earlier.
Harry gets a sinking feeling but just pastes on a neutral expression and nods, shrugging back at Ron when his friend shoots him an inquisitive look.
“I didn’t-”
“I won’t.”
Harry presses his lips together for a moment. “I don’t want to mess this up again. And I want to know that if we’re together it’s not just because of our past. Neither of us are the same as we were in Eighth Year. So I think- I think you should go.”
Harry hesitates and scans the room, wondering where to look. “It was my dad’s.”
“Good night.” She says softly. “Thanks for bringing him back.”
“Well it’s obvious you’ve made an effort.” His best friend smiles. “I like what you’ve done with your hair. Making it look messy on purpose.”
The wind is still blowing coldly and Harry looks up to see the now darker grey clouds and be met with fat water droplets splashing against his skin.
He just shrugs. "If it can stop Purebloods from hating Muggles then I don't see the harm, really."
Draco looks over and meets his eyes, surprised at the admission. "Because I can’t stand you?"
The Slytherin had looked thoroughly unconvinced and thrown a rolled up piece of parchment at him before they’d finally gotten down to studying. Miraculously Harry is actually starting to understand the Potions reading without needing to ask for help and Slughorn has given him several happy looks. Nowhere near Sixth Year level, but close enough for Harry to be happy. He might have been doing even better than Ron.
“Yes,” Harry admits, holding out the wrapped book and bag of chocolates sitting on top. “I hope it’s the right one.”
“It is.” Blaise’s dark eyes search him. “I want to ask if you’re okay.”
“Will you tell me what’s wrong? Because I don’t see what the issue is here.”
Then she’s throwing her arms around him, hugging tightly.
Neither of them speak as Harry turns back to look at the statue for a few more minutes. Draco wraps one arm around his back, letting the other fall to his side, and feels a quiet happiness when Harry leans into his side, resting his head in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco hears someone shift in room before they let out a low and pained groan but he doesn’t spare whoever it is a thought. His mind is racing, and now that he’s had some sleep and the drink is (mostly) out of his system, he feels the beginning of fear.
up along with his two supposed bodyguards (watchdogs more like) he hasn’t felt a single spell aimed his way.
“No, I... decided to stay.” Ron says lamely.
“Oh. Well um, that’s good.”
to go with Harry to Godric’s Hollow.”
There are more whispers at that and Kingsley nods. "Very well, Mr. Potter. Thank you-"
“Two hugs in two days?” Draco murmurs into Harry’s hair, grip tightening in contradiction with his words. “Don’t tell me you’re getting soft, Potter.”
It’s in the morning and Harry and Draco are with the rest of their friends except Millie and Hermione who are suffering through Arithmancy. They’re just coming in from a picnic outside when they all pull up short in the Entrance Hall at the sight of their headmistress waiting for them.
Harry takes the cup he’s offered, eyeing Draco in return before frowning. “Better than you. What the hell are you supposed to be? The sun?”
It takes a little bit, and it’s more awkward than Draco would like, but soon Harry stops pushing in and Draco feels full, so full he’s amazed he can even hold all of it. Once the shock wears off though there’s something else, a pleasant ache.
“Alright.” Harry breathes, and Draco’s smile widens before he slowly bends forward to kiss him again with his heart racing.
His robes are lying in a crumpled heap beside it. Harry picks them up and he can see some areas have dried while the creases are still wet. Carefully he drapes them over a wooden chair at the room’s small desk before glancing around and doing the same with his socks, placing his shoes beneath the seat.
“Not yet.” Harry supplies.
“Me?” Ron splutters. “What do they care about me for?”
Harry slips the piece of paper in the pocket of his jeans and listens as Draco hisses to Pansy about him being at a distinct disadvantage.
He should just
Into the second last compartment. His stomach sinks.
It’s only just in time that Draco bites back a scathing remark about Dumbledore playing favourites, because now is really the worst time he could pick for a comment like that. Instead he frowns. “Dumbledore had it? Why didn’t your Muggle relatives give it to you?”
But there’s a difference between knowing that and taking the steps to make it happen. A difference between knowing Harry makes him happy and being willing to possibly lose his family to keep being with the other wizard.
“Um,” that hadn’t been what he’d tried to do at all but if it looks alright then he supposes it’s fine. Honestly he hadn’t noticed much of a pay off from his attempts at fiddling with his hair, not enough for anybody else to pick up on, but he supposes Hermione is just observant like that. “Thanks. I feel a bit ridiculous to be honest.”
“Promise.”
He gets several wolf whistles and head nods which he takes as a confirmation. A few of the older Potion Masters looks at his boisterous friends in disapproval but Draco ignores them with a wide smile.
"I don't- now wait just a second, what the hell do you think you're playing at? Is this some kind of set up?" Rory's voice is angry now and Harry shakes himself before starting to move on, looking down at the grass and trying to ignore the raised voices behind him.
“This is why I told you to start looking last time we went to Hogsmeade,” she told Ron. “There’s so much less pressure when you spread it out and don’t have to buy them all at once.”
"You're breaking up with me because of- because of the press?" Harry's voice cracks but Draco stares at him stone faced.
“It was fun.”
“-know I was a bit of an idiot before, when I was younger, but the war changed everything-”
Draco stares at her. “What are you talking about?”
Draco doesn’t need time to think things through. It’s clear now what he has to do. His parents’ feelings are clear and Draco only has two options to pick from.
Something heavy fills his stomach and he looks back as Harry scrapes his chair back, his foot leaving Draco’s leg- obviously he’s had time to slip it back into his trainer- to get up and follow her.
She worries her lip anyway. “Molly offered for you to stay there all of break.”
Now Harry is the one who wrinkles his nose. “We’ll just have to prove him wrong.”
The dark-haired wizard grins. "Right, yeah, I suppose."
Harry feels like he’s missing something very obvious. “Alright. Why are you talking like that?”
Draco nods, their eyes holding. “I have something to tell you.”
“Wh-”
He butters a couple of pieces of toast and has some fruit but finds he’s still hungry. When he’s scanning the table looking for something else to eat he catches sight of Harry appearing at the Hall entrance.
“I’ll take Neville,” Luna snaps him out of his thought. “Ginny-”

Harry looks up at him, feeling caught in Draco’s grey eyed gaze. “Thank you.” He says and Draco doesn’t say anything back, just reaches out to lightly touch the back of Harry’s hand.
That old monster that lived in him back before he kissed Ginny for the first time hasn’t reared its head at least. That alone is enough to tell Harry something.
“What?” Harry asks, unable to help himself even as he arches towards the wall as Draco slips another finger into him.
Harry turns his head to look up at her and Draco sees Hermione take her wand out and whisper the spell, making the letters piled up disappear.
She's looking at him with obvious curiosity burning beneath a feeling of worry. "I heard, you know. Most of the others saw you. You turned right around and practically ran in the opposite direction when you caught sight of him."
“That’s not fair.”
“Huh.” Harry sits thoughtfully. “That does ring a bell, now that you say it, but I completely forgot.”
“Yes.” Harry says, honest in his simplicity. “A lot.”
“Well.” Harry had looked away and Draco wished he hadn’t so that he would have been able to still see his face and make out his expression. “That would be alright with me. If your family don’t mind.”
! You have Blaise for Secret Santa? I told you not to tell me, you dolt.”
The rest of the day is spent discussing much happier subjects and when their friends all finally arrive back Draco is studying resolutely in the Slytherin Common Room and ignoring their flushed cheeks and happy smiles. For once he doesn’t even feel a slight pang of jealousy at having missed out, because he knows that no matter what the lot of them had got up to at Hogsmeade, it is absolutely nothing compared to the brilliancy of the day he has just had with Harry.
“If the world doesn’t know then we’ll just keep getting more of today.” Harry waves a hand to encompass his meaning. “You standing on the sidelines having to watch me come up with excuses and say no every single time someone asks me on a date. When it come down between being together or not… I don’t care. I don’t
“That would be lovely, Luna, thank you.” Hermione says warmly.
A couple of nights before Christmas Eve Harry and Draco decide to spend the night in the Astronomy Tower.
“But just so we’re clear I want to be with you. I’m asking for a second chance. If you don’t want that or can’t give it to me that’s alright, Harry. But don’t think I want anything less than you.” His honesty scrapes Harry raw. “That’s how I feel and where I stand. Anything else is up to you.”
“You’re a student.” Harry had said furiously. “McGonagall or somebody should be protecting you from that kind of thing-”
"You didn't want breakfast?" Harry asks, and Draco cringes at the concern that's evident in his tone.
Harry slides out of bed, gathering some fresh clothes as he does and trying not to focus on the fact that he’s naked except for a pair of briefs. Luckily the room is warm.
“Come on,” Harry says in exasperation. “This, whatever it is… I know we said it was real, but it feels…”
"Well you know we need top marks in our N.E.W.T.S to be Aurors," Ron had said while sounding uncharacteristically serious. "And Hermione's brilliant at Potions. I need all the help I can get, mate."
“No.” Draco agrees immediately. “That won’t happen.”
"It's taken all I have to convince Pansy to drop the subject of you and Potter and avoid bringing it up anymore," Blaise continues, ignoring his words. "Harry's managed to convince all of us that it's dangerous to do so in his presence."
“I don’t know what you mean.” Draco says with mock affront. “Haven’t I told you about my secret shrine dedicated to you, The Chosen One? Don’t you know I would do anything you asked of me? That I would go so far as to wipe your arse just for the honour of it?”
They grin at each other until Draco shakes his head and finishes his apple, the humor slowly trickling away. “But that was really good of Ginny, being Luna’s friend all those years ago. Everybody in Slytherin looked down on her.” Draco frowns and rolls a grape around on his plate and Harry watches, expecting it to burst beneath Draco’s finger. “We were horrible.”
“I’m sorry about everything. I was an arse.”
am, so I have to go. Try not to attract too much drama before then?”
Draco desperately hopes that they would all approve but a deep part of him doubts it. James Potter and Sirius Black may have grown up in Pureblooded families like Draco had, but they’d been open-minded enough to branch out and not let tradition shape who they became. Granted, the Potters had always been a more accepting bunch than most Purebloods, a lot like the Weasleys, but James had been the first to marry a Muggle-born.
“I thought all Slytherins were…. Like them.” The Saviour gestures vaguely and Draco feels a rush of affection. “But you… you’re not, are you?”
“Really really.” Draco promises and lets out a noise of surprise when Harry throws his arms around him, neither of them caring about the other students or the few staff members standing nearby.
But did it have to be so
looks at him. Their eyes meet and hold, and Draco sees several expressions cross the other wizard’s face but he couldn’t name any of them.

Draco blinks. He’s tempted to ask if Harry is serious but he knows there would be no reason for him to lie, not about something like this. “So he lied to Voldemort for years because he loved your mum?”
“Draco listen to me.” All of a sudden her eyes are knowing and heavy and sad. She reaches out as if to take his hand but stops at the last second. He’s glad, because every time she’s touched him before he’d been chilled to the bone. “I already told you, some of us don’t get second chances. I don’t get to fall in love with Harry Potter and have him fall in love with me, no matter how much I might want to.”
Fingers fidgeting ceaselessly he makes his way up to Harry’s office. He nods to the Ministry workers he passes along the way, scared they can see what he has just done by looking at him. The smiles he gets in return are normal, as are the few glares, but Draco is still restless when he comes to a stop outside of Harry’s door.
Blaise isn’t bad either. He’s quieter than the others, though he has a sharp wit, and Harry suspects he isn’t afraid to make his feelings known once he gets comfortable enough. But his presence is steady, he’s logical and doesn’t let his emotions show or impact his actions, which is surprising considering who his mother is.
Draco has never been so uncomfortable in his life.
“Yes,” Harry pleads and pulls forward before shoving his hips back and making his own knees waver.
here.”
When she meets his eyes, she looks suddenly upset. “You never told me what you were working to do that whole year. You only said you were lonely and under pressure and that nobody would understand.”
Harry sighs. "Look, just move before-"
“No.” He’d breathed. “No of course not. Or the dining room. Just- just the parlor.”
Grey eyes shoot up to meet his and he sees Draco put his walls back up. The Slytherin swallows visibly before speaking. “Get dressed, Harry.”
Neville hadn’t been able to make it so Pansy brings up the rear, eyes wide as Draco closes the door behind her.
Hagrid has really gone all out this year, he notes absently as the Headmistress speaks about how proud she is of the change she saw among the students. There are Christmas trees lining the walls and the ceiling gives the impression of softly falling snow that disappears about ten feet above the students’ heads. There is the smell of a fireplace fire even though there are none in sight, and garland is strung along the edge of the Head Table. The tables hold centerpieces of pine twigs, holly berries and frosted pinecones, and even the dishes where the food will appear show different Winter Wonderland themed pictures.
“Do you ever think about blokes?”
There’s an awkward pause before Blaise speaks again. “Fine, I take it back.”
The more distance Harry gets from the war, and the more he talks to and understands Draco and his friends, the more Harry understands what McGonagall is trying to do with this obligatory Muggle Studies course. Not only does it take away a barrier between Pure-blooded wizards and everyone else, but it gives the students another thing to bond over, another class to complain about. It gives Muggle-born witches and wizards a class where they’re finally the knowledgeable ones and the others are at a disadvantage.
assigned to go through Draco’s mail, as you were all perfectly aware at the time.”
“I never said ugly, Draco, for Merlin’s sake.”
“Too right.” Neville agrees from across the table.
His face feels hot and his blood is roaring. Draco knows that they’ve gotten away from what they were actually talking about and this has devolved into something else, but that doesn’t make these things any less true. Just because the propaganda he was taught was wrong doesn’t mean he’s the only one who’s been a victim of it. The idea of a purer and holier-than-thou Dumbledore is pure shite. Black and white thinking is bollocks, and Draco wishes that people could realize that sometimes. To realize and understand that he’s
“Stop. Too much.” He stills Draco’s hips and pulls out completely, making Draco mewl before he can catch himself.
Harry jerks his head towards the Fat Lady’s corridor. “Gryffindor Common Room is on this floor and I have something in my dorm that will help you get to yours without anyone seeing you.”
Blaise stops him with a gentle hand on his shoulder. "The password changed last night. I assume Draco hasn't told you what the new one is."
“Just a scrap of paper saying they were from old family albums. Though she was kind enough to label them on the back so I knew who was who.” Draco fingers move anxiously. “You’re not mad, are you? I know it was a bit presumptuous of me and that I might have been overstepping but once the idea hit me I wanted to do it the best I could.”
It’s refreshing, the honesty in Harry’s words and the openness of his expressions. It’s kind of an amazing feeling for Draco to be able to look at him and realize he already knows Harry well; even if it’s a result of years of studying him from a distance, Draco can read Harry’s posture and tone and expression and know how he feels.
“And you look wonderful.” Grey eyes look up to inspect his hair and the corners of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Whatever you did to your hair to make it look like that… I like it.”
“I’m so in love with you,” Harry sighs and slumps into his mattress, going entirely limp. Drunkenly he whispers, “I’m sorry. I wish I wasn’t.”
It begins to rain.
“My grandparents?”
Draco carefully takes the award and when he looks out from the stage he sees a crowd of clapping people and cameras going off, blinding his line of vision. He keeps smiling though, and when his eyes adjust in a brief respite of the flashing he manages to see the faces of those watching him and recognizes more than a few.
“Oh dear.” Draco murmurs, a bit distracted at the smell of sex and the way Harry is touching his fingers.
.” Harry whispers.
Draco shrugs as he closes the door of his closet. "No looking at my bare arse now, Zabini."
Merlin, he’s been an idiot.
“Tell me, Potter,” Narcissa speaks again when it becomes clear neither Draco nor Harry will. “How is Grimmauld Place? It’s certainly been a while since I was last there.”
Draco smiles, tucking it away. “Thanks.”
Draco had inhaled sharply.
Potter turns to face him fully, not pretending to listen to the Professor and Draco does the same, arms crossed. "What's turned you into such a git this morning?"
What did that mean? Harry had asked himself as he walked into the Common Room, heading straight upstairs to the boy’s dormitories. That Malfoy liked him? That he felt comfortable enough to confide in him?
“I can’t believe this.” Draco is stunned. “I don’t- I don’t understand.”
Ginny hummed again. "Why didn't either of you ever tell us?"
Of course her incessant questioning after they’d arrived back at Malfoy Manor afterwards had erased any affection or gratefulness he’d momentarily felt. Draco had brushed her off as effectively as he could, but Pansy is determined even on her worst days. Besides, Draco secretly suspects that meddling in his problems was a welcome distraction to her from the fact that Blaise is now happily married.
He breaks off to look at her, confused at the concern in her tone. "What?”
“Yes, I’m fine.” Draco had watched her right back. “It’s you I worry about, you know.”
each other… I don’t know, Harry, I’ve never had this with anyone else.”
Harry looks between the two of them and watches Hermione spin round. "If you think Harry will let you copy his work you’re even more ignorant than I thought." She says to the Slytherin. "Friends, do that, Malfoy, not people who hate each other."
“Why not?” Harry asks bluntly when no answer is forthcoming, and Draco meets his eyes again to watch him blush. “Er, I mean… you seem so confident with all that stuff. Experienced, you know.”
“She died here in the castle. McGonagall can’t just kick her out, no matter how many floods she causes.”
He’d just assumed- well he and Blaise are friends, of course, but Harry’s never harboured any illusions that when it comes down to it Blaise is closer to Draco than him.
“None taken.” She says laughing at him.
"I didn't mean it, you know." He replies after a minute or so of silence. "Any of what I said. I was hurt because you seemed- the entire day you had seemed fine. Completely normal. And there I was, every time I even looked at you it hurt and I had just seen you kissing some other bloke in a picture in the
Draco rolls his eyes but is quickly pulled into a hug by Pansy as the others all circle Harry to say goodbye.
“I’m sorry. For what happened.” Draco forces himself to meet Harry’s eyes so he sees as his expression shutters into blankness. “And I came to promise that from now on I’ll be completely professional. You don’t need to worry.”
“Yes?” Draco prods when Harry trails off, making him blush this time.
“I’m not sure I am.” Harry’s grinning now too, bounding up the stairs to catch up to Draco. “I hear you take note of my name in the papers, what am I supposed to think?”
Longbottom brightens at a sudden thought. “Hey, did I win any of the pools?”
To his arse.
He’s up early, earlier than usual. It’s still dark outside in fact, and though he turns over and tries to fall back asleep, his mind is already awake and the attempt fails. So rather than waste time lying in bed bored out of his mind he quietly gets up, gets dressed, heads to the bathroom quickly, and then makes his way downstairs, casting a
“Kreacher?”
“Draco,” he seems to be momentarily ignoring Harry. Harry accepts this thankfully, feeling a stray sock with his toe and looking under the covers to see that it’s his before he slides it on. “What the fuck?”
Pansy’s eyes are narrowed. “Are you sure? I can tell you right now that none of us want a repeat of any of that.”
Draco valiantly tries to keep his calm facade on his face, but Harry sees it crack. Sees the jaw clench he tries to hide. "As you just saw that clearly isn't the case-"
And catching the killer, of course. That’s pretty important as well.
“Just a note from Ginny.” Ron told her quietly. “Sent her a quick one back.”
“You’d best go and do that homework Harry mentioned earlier.” Dumbledore says suddenly. Draco glances over and sees Harry and McGonagall are now watching him. Harry looks unsure and McGonagall appears to be considering something. “It wouldn’t do to fall behind in your studies.”
They both gasp. Draco from the intrusion because Morgana’s tits Harry’s prick is bigger than his fingers and fills him in a completely foreign way. It doesn’t hurt, not yet because there’s barely anything in, but it stretches him and he remembers to breathe.
Neither he or Harry had brought any of that up last night though. Instead they’d discussed other things, relived and processed other difficult memories, until finally something in Draco had settled.
“Hey yourself,” the other boy replies and Draco feels all the nerves in his stomach settle.
Maybe if Draco had said yes Harry might have thought about it more, and perhaps even said yes himself. The thing is, he
“Look at you!” Harry cheers.
it.” Draco stresses. “I don’t deserve that trust after all this time. Not after all the ways I’ve lied to you and hurt you.”
The letter in Draco's hand is forgotten as he looks up. "Hello, Blaise."
"Oh, name me one person who isn't," Draco retorts.
the bouquet that had been sitting in his dorm. Draco knows he’d gathered it with help from Sprout.
Then Harry looks away and Draco realizes that while Draco has been taking in the town Harry has been staring into the plot of land beside them. A small gate shuts it off from the rest of the street and behind that gate is a ruined house.
"I'm in love with Draco," he whispers through the feeling, and in the silence of the room the words fall heavily on all of their ears.
That’s a Muggle sport reference. Draco doesn’t entirely understand it, but spending enough time with Harry, Hermione, Seamus and the others have at least made him comfortable enough to know he’s used it correctly, even if it’s only in the safety of his own mind.
“It’s mostly come about with you being friends with Potter, Draco, if you’ll believe it,” she says one night a few days after he’s arrived. “You’re my son, the heir to the Malfoy name. You’re choosing what direction our family takes now, and personally I’ve come to see that you’re on the right path. Especially now that you have Potter’s ear. Your father was never sure where we stood with the Dark Lord, nobody ever was. He could change his mood at the flip of a coin. But Potter- that boy is loyal beyond anything else. If you have him on your side it will be hard to lose that.”
Harry smiles. “Well if it helps it was raining earlier.”
Potter shrugs. "We have a test coming up soon," he says and Draco internally panics again because, yes, alright, he is not ready for this Muggle Studies test coming up on Wednesday at all. "I just thought maybe I could help you study for it and you could help me with Potions again. I still don't remember the seven different phoenix ash properties, and I’m completely lost when it comes to asphodel root."
Draco remembers a few times when he and Myrtle had discussed nothing except Harry and feels a bit embarrassed.
Draco had gone to it last year, Harry knows, which is why he’d pretended he’d had to work and missed it. Teddy had only been turning four but Harry still feels bad about it now and had felt worse even then when he’d shown up the next day and listened to his godson and Andromeda fill him in on the stories and show off the new presents.
They don’t have as many over-the-top displays of affections as Pansy and Theo, but they are very obviously together. If they’re not sitting in each other’s lap or resting their head on the other’s thighs, then they’re holding hands or murmuring in soft voices, or swooping in to give one another quick kisses.
He falls back on his bed and stares up at the top of it. Guilt fills him for how he’d treated Harry. He’s ashamed that he’d allowed his panic to get the better of him and make him lash out. They should have talked this out together- Harry had been trying to reassure him and what had Draco done? Thrown his words back in his face.
Fifteen minutes later he knocks on Draco’s door while telling himself that his willpower is the most pathetic one in existence. He is disappointed in himself both as the leader of this investigation and as a man.
Of all things Blaise actually looks disappointed.
He also can’t help but think about his bed, sitting innocently feet away, and the last time Draco had been up there only a week ago.
He’s the Auror department’s poster boy. He doesn’t like it but that doesn’t stop it from being true.
asked for the autograph after months of working up the nerve before Christmas. He hadn’t looked at it since bringing it home during that break though. Anytime he’d even thought of it his stomach had twisted. Besides, after Fourth Year everything had happened so quickly, falling apart around his family’s ears, it wasn’t like thoughts of Viktor Krum had taken up much of his time. “Did you?”
Draco laughs and it’s happier and more carefree than Harry has heard from him in years. “Was that a proposal?”
The cloak had been as cool and smooth as a calm surface of water. Ridiculously Draco had smelled it and the trace of Harry’s now familiar scent had helped soothe his anxiety.
The matriarch cocks her head just slightly. “You told me you were working under Ronald. Or am I misremembering?”
“Harry love,” Molly turns towards him suddenly and she looks far more awake now. He blinks rather sleepily back at her. “I’d like to ask you something, if it’s alright.”
When he manages to rein in the temptation he’s only a bit disappointed.
“Oh, just fine. He’s been worse.” She smiles. “Did you want a cup of tea before you go?”
“Professor!” Harry calls and McGonagall stops in the hallway, turning to look back at them in surprise.
All he wants is to be able to share memories of his life and his family honestly. And that includes the better parts of Lucius Malfoy, because, contrary to what most people think of the man, he had loved Narcissa and Draco. He still does. Nothing will ever be able to convince Draco otherwise.
Mostly though, they ignore each other. Or slide each other notes without saying anything. Neither of them ever ask the other for help, but somehow they've started silently offering it anyway. Even if Potter’s chicken scratch writing is appalling to look at, he seems to know what the important bits of Marylton’s lectures are. Which help when it all sounds like a foreign language to Draco.
He rushes to his dorm and crawls into bed, yanking the curtains closed around him and murmuring a charm to ensure no one can open them and catch him by surprise. It’s childish, perhaps, to hide away in his room like this, but he needs to feel safe.
Hermione watches him for a long time, so long that Ron starts whispering softly to himself again before she answers. “Okay. Thank you, Draco. I will.”
Harry meets Ginny’s gaze and sees the same questions that he has reflecting back at him in her eyes. What is Blaise playing at here?
Blaise sighs. “I thought so.”
“I’ll be just a minute.” He turns and says to Harry. “Just… wait here.”
And Draco had been expecting annoyance or real anger from Harry at that but all Harry does is look at him so fondly that it makes Draco ache all over.
“So she asked me out, so what?” Harry asks. “The others must have told you I didn’t want to date her in Sixth and I still don’t now. Especially now.”
Draco appears from the bathroom and quickly changes into pajamas before finally coming to lie beside Harry. He shuts off the lamp and then it is only the light from their window giving them any sense of where each other are.
“It is a nice view,” Harry says and then, always needing to get the last word, he stops any hope Draco has of replying by slowly licking.
“What about these?” Harry makes it back to the pictures of the Eighth Years all together. He frowns, trying to remember which of them had carried around a camera for each of the photos, but he doesn’t think any of them ever had. “When did any of us get these?”
Enjoy!
But he can’t think of that now. They’ve moved on past those times. This is simpler than that, and Draco takes a bit of hope from the fact. It might feel like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders, but compared to this same time last year the two of them are sitting pretty.
“That’s quite advanced, isn’t it?” He hears Draco murmur from the few feet separating them.
“Oh. Sorry.”
Harry nods again. “Ron and ‘Mione gave me some…”
“So does the charm just wear off?” He gestures to the Opaleye sitting happily on Draco’s shoulder, trying not to let his amusement show. “They were inanimate when they came out of the box.”
He had been angry too, after all, and Draco doesn’t really know why.
But seeing that man all over Draco, kissing his neck in the middle of the dance floor when Draco isn’t even out as gay to anybody except Harry, Blaise and Pansy had made Harry see red. The old monster in his stomach had roared to life and he’d wanted to storm forward and ask the man to kindly fuck off before remembering he didn’t have a right to do that. Not anymore. Not for years now.
A few seconds go by before Draco sighs, letting his fork fall. “He killed Voldemort, but it took the lot of them to save the world. No one could have done all of that alone.”
“Get out of conversations so quickly? I’d been trying to get rid of Chester for the last fifteen bloody minutes.”
It’s still early but his tears are finally gone and a bit of hope simmers inside of him. Grabbing it and trying to hold onto his earlier bravery he makes his way up the stairs to the top floor of the Manor and knocks on the door leading to his parents’ bedroom.
"I'll save you the time." Harry snaps at the woman before glancing at Kingsley apologetically. The Minister of Magic is just watching him closely. "You're just going to call me up to testify against those crimes too, might as well get it all done at once."
“More.” Draco pleads, still pushing back and making Harry’s mind incapable of thinking of anything past his cock. “Harder.”
Finally, Harry does speak, continuing his earlier line of questioning. “And you and Pansy… I know you said last night she was with Nott and had been since last year, but… did you two ever…” He trails off looking embarrassed, but Draco is too caught off guard by the question to notice.
“Think they’re getting back together?” Blaise asks Draco, who scoffs and takes another sip from his goblet to avoid everyone’s eyes.
“She’s not a baby,” Harry says sternly. “And you two love each other, don’t pretend otherwise.”
“Hey.” Harry’s brows furrow as he looks at Draco. “What is it?”
“You’ve certainly changed your tune since Third Year,” Harry says and Hermione grins proudly.
“Good.” She leads them into the room and like she said there are two Aurors waiting quietly beside the fireplace. “Once you’re gone I’ll write to the Minister saying everything went well. The Auror who accompanies you will do the same, Malfoy.”
This chapter could also be titled The One Where Neither of Them Have the Braincell. Both of our boys are Very Dumb and so we get back to the angst.
He stops his moving lips on Harry’s neck and they’re both panting. Draco’s hands have half of Harry’s shirt undone, and when did that happen?
and last night are practically visible beneath his eyelids every time he blinks.
Draco swallows. “How do you know? When- if none of you spoke about it, if you tried to hide it away all those years with the Dark Lord, how could you know what he felt?”
With one boy too proud to forget and another too overwhelmed to stop- or even realize- what he's started.
"For good reason! Would have turned around and hexed us in the back, that lot would have."
“Ginny.” He stops her long enough she takes a breath. “What’s this about?”
It hasn't been the easiest of jobs.
Potter rolls his eyes. "I know," he says back, a little more heated than before. "I was going to ask whether you wanted to study together later."
doesn’t matter that it had felt like Harry had stared at Draco for most of last night. They’re friends. That’s what mattered.
He and Harry stare at each other in stunned silence for a moment, hurt coursing through Harry fiercely, a hurt he knows Draco sees because Harry notes the moment it registers on Draco’s angry and betrayed face before the blonde whirls around and begins to stride away.
want. When we tell people about us it has to be when we’re both ready to do it or not at all.”
It’s funny, he thinks. At the start of the year he would have felt left out, but now he just- he’s happy for them and their happiness. They deserve it more than anyone, and he knows they’ve been running after him too much in their lives. Now instead of being guilty and jealous, he can look at them together and feel the way he’s always wanted to feel for them. Supportive without any clouds hanging around him. Their group dynamic had shifted at a time when he’d been desperate for permanence, and though it had taken time, Harry’s comfortable with it now.
There's heavy silence behind him until he hears Blaise stride to the door. "Fine," is the eventual retort. "Just to let you know, he'll be at the wedding. And you're my best man. So you'll have to figure out something to say pretty damn fast."
And now he just feels guilty, which is stupid because there’s nothing for him to feel guilty for. “Alright, I’ll stop by.”
Harry doesn’t protest so Draco moves Harry’s hands away and waves a hand to clean the spunk from his clothing before moving to unbutton the things Harry calls blue jeans (which Draco does not at all find attractive, thank you) and push them down. Harry shifts a bit restlessly to help and Draco bites his bottom lip in hesitation for a moment before moving his hands to Harry’s boxer briefs and pushing them away as well.
Harry grits his teeth. "That was years ago, Malfoy, you think I still care about it? Our schoolboy romance that turned out to be nothing but a substandard fuck?" Malfoy's knuckles whiten and Harry grins in victory at the response. "At the time it hurt, sure. But as soon as I got out of Hogwarts and realized what I'd been missing while being stuck with you? Merlin, you did me a favour."
Slowly Harry’s simmering anger ebbs away to be replaced by a slowly mounting dread. “What did they say back?”
“You’re welcome,” Harry says in a hush and he returns Draco’s kiss, chaste and warm.
He wastes no time in opening it when he sees whose handwriting it is on the envelope.
He doesn’t.
Draco doesn’t verbally argue but his expression shutters for a second. Before Harry can comment on it though he’s grabbing Harry’s hips and pulling him one step away from the wall.
“Ron’s drunk.” Harry says harshly, and Draco stops talking. “And I have a few things to do tomorrow anyway.”
“Oh,” he says and Draco smiles before moving to kiss him again, hips moving as he leans over the other boy. “Ah,
“Oh Merlin.” He groans, throwing himself down again and covering his closed eyes with an arm. “I’d really wanted to tell you most of that myself.”
“Oh, you two are too funny!” She teases. “It’s a wonder no one else has found out you know. From what I hear you aren’t exactly subtle, what with your flirting and your touching.”
in front of him.
“This one is,” he insists, a bit nervous. “You have to promise. Like last time.”
“I’m sure you will.” She says, not sounding the least bit concerned as she turns away to talk to Millie.
“I missed something didn’t I?”
“I’m sorry.” Draco repeats. “I can wait. However long you want.”
Blaise looks at her apologetically. "Ginny, I'm sorry but-"
“Four!” He says excitedly.
Draco’s stomach sinks. The thought hadn’t even occurred to him. “I- no, I’ll tell him.”
“Merlin.” He gasps as Harry’s hands move up Draco’s thighs, rucking up the wizarding robes he’s wearing to get to the underwear underneath.
They’re facing a war memorial in the shape of an obelisk. Draco reads the names on it, local names he supposes, and then in the span of a blink it changes to form the shape of three carved figures.
“I have to go.” He hurriedly gets up from the table, leaving Ron and Hermione standing there.
“Right then.” Blaise spins the bottle and as it slows down Harry feels a sudden spike of panic because it looked like it was about to stop on him. Luckily it stops just before, landing on Ginny and making Harry breathe out a sigh of relief.
His mother’s face pinches. “As I said these are extremely personal letters-”
“-but I need more, Harry, because lately, with today, I guess I’m just doubting… us.”
Watching his best friends makes him envious, and he doesn’t want to ruin their moments or take away from how happy they’ve been. He loves that they’re happy. It’s not their fault he’s a teenager who doesn’t know how to live without being in constant fear of death.
“Yeah, alright. But you know what I mean?”
He almost admits he’s missed the blonde git but holds it back at the last second. That would be too much, too easy for Draco to read into and Harry doesn’t need that. Even this conversation feels dangerous.
“All right, how about the fact that I don’t want to date Romilda? That I don’t think of her like that?”
“Wow.” Harry mutters.
But he needs to talk to someone. His mind is racing, his heart is buzzing and he’s torn between giggling and hyperventilating.
Harry won’t deny he’s curious, just like everybody else. But hearing them all talk about it irks him for some reason. He chalks it up to his own confused feelings about Malfoy- because he still hates the git, really he does, but a part of him feels bad for him too- and it’s hard to reconcile anything with that going on inside of him.
"I would have thought he'd prefer the rest of Slytherin to you." Pansy replies without missing a beat, pausing only a second before adding. “Longbottom’s table was empty.”
So all Draco gets in answer is a questioning, “hmm?” hummed against the pale skin.
Draco sneers. "That's not called running, Potter, that's called knowing when to cut my losses and survive. Believe me, it's working out better than whatever the hell it is you're doing."
He aches for her. As frustrated as he’s been with her for being torn between Theo and Blaise- because she does care for Theo, she cares for him a lot. And Draco knows that. She just fell hard for Blaise and hasn’t gotten over it since- as frustrating as that’s been for him to witness, Draco feels for her right now. She’s in pain, a pain Draco understands. He’s lived his whole life feeling like he couldn’t have the person he wants and now she’s getting confirmation of the same.
But for now this will do.
“He was the fucking worst,” Harry seems to respond from instinct, not even thinking about it.
Christmas Eve dawns crisp and bright. Sunshine spills bright and invitingly through the windows of Harry’s dorm and when he turns over to find Draco sleeping soundly beside him the morning only gets better.
(It doesn't matter that he's lost the desire to anyway. He has more than enough of the prat's attention during classes, he certainly doesn't need any more.)
"What?" He hisses back to the other boy. "Little busy here, Potter, not all of us grew up with this stuff, you know."
“Yes.” Draco’s mouth twitches. “Hagrid helped me get quite a few and then said I should ask McGonagall for some of Dumbledore since he only had the one of the two of them for me to copy. And I suppose she must have asked a few other teachers to see if there were any others you might like. This was the only one she got, I think, but I figured I might as well put it in there.” He flips a few pages. “That one of Moody was from an old
"But- wha- you two-" His sausage is dangling precariously from his fork and Hermione is keeping an eye on it beside him. Good thing too, because it looks like it might fall into Ron's lap. "But you two have been together forever."
“Slytherins were supposed to have the best costumes.” She frowns, eyeing him up and down. “What the hell are you supposed to be?”
“Well it would be your fault.” Harry points out. “In this scenario.”
“Don’t be so full of yourself, I would say you make up about 60% of school rumors.” Draco combats before pausing to reconsider. “Maybe 80% on a slow week.”
Everyone thanks him. Wherever he goes.
But he makes an effort to make himself vulnerable in turn, not wanting to increase Harry’s discomfort. The thing in his chest is warm and fond as his eyes take in every feature of Harry’s and a small smile quirks his lips up. The mussed-up hair, dark eyes and dark cheeks and rosy lips are as endearing to Draco as they are desirable.
“Now you just cast.” Harry says and he turns to stand parallel to Draco, wand out as he says in a soft voice, “
“I’ve tried them before. I think I do better without.”
"Get my hopes up?" Draco asks her. "Pansy, I don't care-"
“That present was brilliant.” He says without preamble. He refuses for them to be swept into awkwardness, and Harry is nothing if not stubborn.
“How…” He starts but his voice deserted him when he flips the page and is greeted with several pictures of Dumbledore. In some he might have been around Harry’s age, with short hair and the patchy beginnings of a beard and mustache.
Harry tenses a bit without meaning to. Did it have to be a snake, he asks himself? Harry’s sick of the things. He seems to be permanently linked to them somehow, first with
“I am,” Harry says at the same time that Hermione says, “He is.”
Draco still hesitates. “Potter.”
"That's what using people
And it’s there, on the tip of his tongue, the words he’s too afraid to say. That he and Harry are more than friends, that Harry gives him more than the others. It’s deeper and it’s more and Draco doesn’t think he could ever go back to living without it; that support and encouragement that comes from knowing he has Harry Potter in his corner.
“That’s okay.” Harry hurriedly reassures, moving a bit closer to stand awkwardly in front of Draco’s desk. “How are you doing?”
“Don’t,” Harry says sharply, and if anything would make him stop what they’re doing right then and there it would be the reminder of what they used to be and the disaster they are now. “Don’t talk about that. Just fuck me.”
"Truth." Draco repeats, closing his eyes and sighing. He takes a swig of the Firewhiskey. "What was your childhood like? Before Hogwarts."
Again, he hesitates but then Ron starts speaking into her neck, words muffled. “’Mione, Harry left early. Had to lie to Draco about it.”
Harry killed Voldemort, for Merlin’s sake. He can handle Draco Malfoy.
"But-"
“James-
She nods as if expecting the reply which- there is no way that’s possible, is it? Harry looks at Draco again who has nervously swiped up a chocolate biscuit and is nibbling on it. Had Draco mentioned anything about Narcissa being good at
“There’s a few things I have to do back there for this present and I figured better do it now while everyone is gone.”
“Muddled up your mind? Oh, thanks very much, that’s lovely to hear. Draco Malfoy, professional Mind Muddler. I’ll just go and customize some labels, shall I?”
His team all nod, determination clear in each of their faces, and Harry releases the Snitch from the case, watching as it goes up and flutters away.
Draco nods.
She glances over at Harry and he looks down at her with scrutiny, trying to figure out if he’d just been tricked in some way. He sees nothing but innocent excitement on her face though and he shrugs, trying to appear casual.
“Potter’s going?” Blaise asks, looking gleeful.
“Professor,” Draco speaks before Harry can, as the three of them stand. “Thank you for the offer. Really.”
Harry gives a wide-eyed look of panic to Draco who just waits until she’s done. He knows Myrtle, maybe better than any of the other students. All she really wants is somebody to listen to her.
He frowns, and the witch nods. "Mr. Potter, did Draco Malfoy kill Albus Dumbledore?"
“Well he shouldn’t be. Not when you two are… you know.”
The thing is, Harry knows while standing staring at the row of shirts hanging up with one fist clenched, he does want to go. Deep inside there’s a part of him, small or large he couldn’t say, that wants to see Draco.
“Do you ever think about it?” Harry asks abruptly.
The truth, he knows, is that out of everybody Draco is probably the one who’s
Harry grins smugly. “She did not say that.”
"What we had was real, back then." Draco clears his throat, and if Harry isn't imagining things his eyes are growing shiny. "But it's not now."
Harry realizes he’s staring and hurries to finish his reply. “And I’ve been pacing upstairs getting nowhere and I just- I wanted something to take my mind off for a bit. Have a break, you know?”
“Who gave it to you?”
Harry waits a bit but Draco’s tongue suddenly feels heavy and he looks away, back at their joined hands and moves his fingers up over Harry’s palm, rubbing gently in an absentminded gesture.
“Well they were.”
But seeing Harry helps a little. Enough to jolt him out of his inward spiral a little.
“No card. That was my idea.”
“Tell me there’s another reason you said no. One that isn’t me.”
“Don’t start acting like you have now, Blaise.” Draco says suddenly and the other boy turns a glare onto him. Harry almost leans away to get out of the receiving vicinity.
"Stop." Blaise shakes his head, hoping it hides how torn he feels. "I don't know what you think Draco told you, but you seem to have the wrong idea. Draco doesn't want to see you again. Ever. He told me that. He used you to get through the school year. Nothing else. He doesn't want a life with you, he doesn't want to put up with the press for you and he doesn't want to be known as the man Harry Potter saved. I don't know how to make you see that.” He takes a fortifying breath. "He wants nothing to do with you. Please don't make things any worse than they are, he let it go on long enough." Blaise stares him down. "You're just embarrassing yourself at this point."
The change that comes over Blaise's face is instantaneous.
Draco searches him quickly, eyes darting across his face, before nodding seriously. “Yes. You’re coming.”
The survivors are all still in St. Mungo’s. One is in critical condition and because of the random bursts of magic Healers are struggling to get close enough to help her for long enough periods of time.
“Perfect!” Pansy claps her hands. “Now can we all discuss costumes, please? There’s no way another House is going to upstage us in that department, I just won’t allow it.”
But the years went by and Potter kept almost dying, and then stopping the Dark Lord, and every time Potter lived Draco’s father got angrier and angrier. They lost a House Elf, and half of their family ended up in Azkaban, and then Draco was being sworn into the Death Eaters, branded as a follower because his father told him that if he didn’t they would all die. Finally, Draco had ended up breaking the law. More than once. The Dark Lord had been back and living in Draco’s home and if Draco wanted to protect himself and his family, he had to do what he was told.
“That is a
“It’s true!’
“Oh thank fuck,” Blaise says and Ginny nudges him sharply, making the Slytherin yelp. Ron and Hermione are beaming beside Luna, and Millie breaks out into a lovely smile.
assigned to their correspondence and to be honest they were more often stationed at the Ministry than Hogwarts.”
“Hello Draco,” Luna says sweetly, kissing his cheek before moving past him inside Harry’s house.
It seems Blaise and Ginny have no plans to hide it or to break it to them all gently. Instead they do rather the opposite. The pair of them sit their friend group down during a walk outside and just bluntly announce that they’re dating now.
Harry stares at him in awe.
“This is brilliant, Harry, thanks.” He frowns again. “I know it’s the game and all but now I feel a bit bad I didn’t get you anything.”
Ron hesitates to start with but as he speaks he seems to gain confidence. “You know I- You know no matter what I’ll be there, right? I might be friends with Draco too but he’s not- it’s not like you and me, yeah?”
“Yeah.” Harry looks around his room again, taking it in, before asking abruptly, “how do you sleep here?”
“We love you, Harry.” Hermione says quietly. “No matter what happens we just want you to be happy.”
he be upset? “Honestly, I’m not. Ginny I-”
Luckily it’s a decent day outside, despite being January, and Seamus and Dean are out playing Quidditch. Neville is off working on an independent Herbology project with Professor Sprout. And since Ron is down with the others that gives Harry the dorm to himself.
“Don’t be stupid.” She eventually answers, not seeming as annoyed or wrongfooted as Harry is. “Harry and I didn’t break up on a whim. We would have stayed together if we still felt like there was any chance of us working out.”
“You’re named after it?”
Slowly after an age they pull away from one another, Harry’s legs trembling while he helps Draco hold himself up.
“Was that a question?” Draco raises an eyebrow while Harry looks at him expectantly. “I suppose we’re like any other House. Some of us like sex, some don’t, and some haven’t tried it yet. And as for Pansy and Theo…” Draco frowns, not sure how in-depth Pansy will appreciate him telling Harry. “Theo needed someone to help him before and through the war. And Pansy needed a way to lash out at her parents and throw off their expectations of her. Their arrangement works for them both.”
He doesn’t look away from the intense stare Draco gives him, doesn’t fidget or squirm or anything. He stands, staring back at the other boy, trying to let him see that he actually means it.
, so they could just shut it- but they’re laughing at him all the while.
Ron rolls his eyes. "And we want to be Aurors," he mutters. "Bloody hell."
“So you’ll stay on the case?” Harry checks.
He remembers it clearly too, the way they’d all Owled him incessantly when he’d been in France studying Potions. He’d ended up writing one letter saying that he and Harry had fallen out and that they were probably never going to speak again before making several copies to send away.
Harry looks down, fingers fidgeting. “He told me he wanted to tell a few more people about us.”
Pansy had got up and when Draco had too she’d hugged him.
He gets up every morning (well, usually in the morning, he’s had his bad days in the past) and lives his life. He has a routine and he sticks to that routine. It's something that's helped him to be so successful. Draco stays in regular contact with his superior, has good relationships with his parents, and sees his friends at least twice a month. He’s only just gotten home from his six month stay in France a week ago, and since then he’s been too busy to pay much attention to anything.
He imagines his parents in Blaise’s shoes and shudders, unable to entertain the idea without his stomach twisting.
Harry moves through the crowd of bodies, ignoring people trying to peer at him. He’s used to this, to the double takes and second glances to make sure, yes, he is who he is, no he doesn’t want to dance or sign anything.
Draco nods and then after a few seconds go by where he regains his breath, he looks up. “What’s an elephant?”
Yet Harry had forgotten.
And Ron following up to say, “Yeah, and the rest of the Slytherins aren’t all that bad either, really.”
“Honestly Draco, couldn’t this wait? You’re acting a bit crazy, love.” Narcissa sits up and frowns, concern lacing her features. “You don’t look well, honey, have you been crying?
Harry bites his lip. There is a good chance if they tell even just their closest friends- Ron and Hermione, Blaise and Pansy- then it will slip out. Pansy might tell Theo, or one of them might tell Ginny, who could tell Luna and Neville. From there it could slip out to Seamus and Dean, or Ernie, or Hannah or one of the others.
But short of losing his parents, there’s nothing he can think of that scares him anymore. Because if the alternative is to lose Harry…
Inwardly he cringes at that, at his asking for permission. He’s in his twenties, for fucks sake, and he can hardly pretend to be an innocent virgin when Narcissa seems to know so much.
“Very decent of you.” Harry says, parroting Draco’s earlier expression while still wondering what on earth Hagrid could have been helping Draco with.
"Er, that's it." He says and Ron breathes out, "Oh
“No!” Harry turns to yell back. “Have fun!”
“Friends invite friends to parties they go to.” Potter says. “I invited you. You- if you knew about it you obviously didn’t want to invite me.”
Harry glances back at Draco. "He didn't have a choice, just like a lot of us didn't in the war. He did what he had to so that he would survive but- but he didn't kill Dumbledore. And yeah, okay, he took the Dark Mark but does the kid in front of you look like a Death Eater? Really?"
The Headmistress frowns. “This is a serious accusation?”
Draco is willing to bet most if not all of them are gone already.
“No. Well, maybe, actually. It’s just… I guess I feel like maybe this was the point of it all. All those years of the two of us, the similarities, it was all to get us here.”
And it’s not much but to Draco it feels like everything.
Millie’s eyes light up. “Oh, are we making it into a game? Please say yes.”
Nobody objects so Harry nods, making the Ravenclaw grin widely.
He’s shaking a bit when he hands them to her but she takes them confidently, frowning as she opens the first one to be met with the sight of Lucius Malfoy’s handwriting.
“Draco asked me to go.” He says finally to them, catching the look they exchange in his peripheral but not knowing what it means. “So I am.”
“You can’t know that.”
“I would like to offer you these positions, respectively.” She has put her glasses back on and now stares at them both over the tops of them. It’s eerily similar to something Dumbledore used to do and Harry’s eyes flicker up to the portraits behind the Headmistress, all of whom are watching them both carefully.
? You told Blaise?”
"I agree with what Harry said earlier." Luna finishes. "Draco is not evil and he shouldn't be put in Azkaban. He did what he had to and he did the best he could. In his place I'm sure many of us would not have been so kind. He was in a much more difficult position than I was in the war because his family had already picked his side for him. Draco was just never able to tell them it wasn't the side he wanted."
“No,” he says in exasperation, slightly bewildered.
He quickens his strokes, adding a twist of his hand at the end of each one, and Draco is shifting his hips and clutching Harry’s shoulder, fingers digging in. His breathing is wrecked, his face and neck splotched red with an uneven flush and Harry thinks that he’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
“I’m happy to hear that, Harry. I really am. But after everything you’ve all told me about Draco Malfoy I can’t understand how you can move past everything with him as well.”
He looks into the empty fireplace, noticing a smudge of soot on its lip, blinking quickly as Ginny continued.
Now Draco completely abandons pretending to take notes and stares at him in surprise. "I would have thought a relationship would be the best thing to happen after a war. Having somebody like that to rely on, I mean."
Draco had been too polite to listen to whatever it was the pair had murmured to each other as they’d embraced, but he clearly remembers the way Lucius had squeezed his eyes closed and fiercely kissed the side of Narcissa’s head.
His heart trip hammers a bit.
A bolt of heat goes through him at the sight.
She looks at him for a beat. “Don’t lie.”
But no, Draco realizes as he finally sees what Potter’s feeling. No, Potter
They don’t look too shabby, if Draco has to say so himself. And he’s glad of it, especially when Molly comes into the tent with her hair and makeup done.
Draco doesn’t really know what to say. It’s difficult, this empathizing business. With Harry it was different because Draco had known somewhere deep down since about Third Year that his own parents were wrong about things and Harry wasn’t the real evil to hate. But feeling sorry for Voldemort? That wasn’t on, no matter what happened to him to create him.
“Alright, so who won the pool then?” Theo says making both Draco and Harry frown.
“Well that’s alright then,” Draco says as Harry’s hands slip under the waistband of his trousers, making him moan.
He’d forgotten, briefly, and the reminder jars him for a reason he can’t pinpoint.
“Hermione needs a buffer from Ron.” Ginny whispers in his ear before pulling away to dodge Hermione’s elbow. “What? It’s true!”
Draco doesn’t seem as excited by the prospect. “Wouldn’t that just waste time? I’d be repeating what I already know.”
The moment when he realizes it for the first time is significant to nobody but them.
"Fine." He says and he does his best to sneer, to adopt the mask he'd worn for seven years once more. "Even if I wasn't, it wouldn't be any of your business now would it?"
They don't look like they believe him, but Harry doesn't care. They stop pestering him and he goes back to his steak pie and Potions book, trying, for the fourth time, to read a paragraph about asphodel root and how it affects potion consistency.
“Are you two alright?”
He’s up and out of his chair in an instant and Draco cranes his neck to follow him as he goes to stand in front of a pedestal. On top of it stands an adolescent phoenix.
The Headmistress presses her lips together. “I would remind you Narcissa that your crimes were much more heinous and
, I'll start doing that. Don't hold your breath."
“Come on,” he requests to Draco. “Let’s go visit Hagrid.”
He ignores the memory of Harry’s stricken face at seeing the man Draco had been dancing with. Purposely not mentioning the hurt that had been in Harry’s voice (because it didn’t make sense, why would he be hurt? And alright, maybe Draco knows why, but he is not prepared to deal with that implication tonight) he only tightens his grip on his friend and continues pulling him down the hall.
Harry groans helplessly.
“I told you I was funny.”
“Why is that?”
Ron rolls his eyes. "Harry, we shared a dorm. Believe me, you weren't."
“Draco?” Harry presses.
“I...” He searches Harry’s face and takes a deep breath. “I want to tell people about us.”
