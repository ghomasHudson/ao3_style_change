Harry is pacing when Draco finally shows up. There are scorched practice dummies scattered around the room, and Draco has to pretend he's not terrified of Harry in that moment. He just closes the door and waits quietly.
Harry knows he's being selfish when he freezes up outside of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because that's where he'd spent the most time with Remus; when he refuses to go to the library, because all he can see is Hermione and that triumphant look she always got when studying; refuses to play quidditch or even to glance at Ginny because all he can see is Ron and Fred and Molly's pain. He's used to pain, used to having the people he loves and needs torn away from him.
“You’ll thank me soon enough, after you have the plum pudding Hagrid made you,” Draco said. “Watch your step here, it’s icy.”
The man straightened slightly and peeked out the window of the booth, only to sink quickly to the floor. Curious, Draco wiped off the window and looked out.
“You thought we’d abandon you because you’re dating this ferrety git?” she asked, and seemed to suddenly remember Draco was still there. “And
that he has done more for the Wizarding World than either of you ever will. Now piss off, and don’t you dare try this again, or I will go to McGonagall and won’t rest until the pair of you are expelled.”
“You weren’t carrying Muggle money, Draco,” Harry said, unable to take his eyes off the twinkling lights that were wound around his bedposts.
“I don’t know why I told you all of that,” Harry murmured, running a shaking hand through his hair. “I shouldn’t have--I’m sorry. I’ll find another table.”
Draco reached into the bag and pulled out a telephone booth keychain. He held it up, then frowned at Harry.
Nearly there was an understatement, thought Harry a moment later, after they turned a corner and came face to face with Malfoy Manor. He stopped, staring for a moment, before he spoke.
At least it gave him an opportunity to keep up on his French now that he was away from home and his parents’ bickering.
when Draco was practically pressed against him. Instead, he faced forward, adjusted his hold on his wand, and tried to relax.
Draco shook his head, but Harry followed Andromeda into the kitchen, leaning his back against the counter as he watched her stir the soup that was cooking on the stove.
Of course, St. Mungo’s didn’t have a treatment for difficulties associated with surviving the Killing Curse. All the Healers could do was apologetically tell Harry there was nothing they
“I’m spending Christmas at the Manor,” he said. “Malfoy Manor. Uh, Draco’s parents invited us, and since bringing Draco to the Weasleys’ wouldn’t be the best idea…”
"We’re nearly there," Draco said, giving Harry’s hand a tight squeeze. He glanced over his shoulder to make sure they weren’t being followed and unlocked a nearby door. He pushed Harry through it and closed the door behind them.
Thank you for reading and for your comments! I was glad to get a pic set at Hogwarts so I could stop having these two run to London in the middle of the school week.
“When I was younger,” Draco said, completely ignoring what Harry had to say, “my mother was very adamant that I could do anything I put my mind to. I just had to get the technique right. You know the spell, you know what you want. All that’s missing now is the technique.”
"I remember that night," said Draco. "V—the Dark Lord planned the whole thing at our dining room table. He thought you’d be moved on your birthday, but Severus came in and said that was a lie." Licking his lips, Draco went on. "Everyone had their doubts about him, but I was surprised he gave you up so easily. I shouldn’t have been, not after he—"
Harry laughed, wincing at the shrillness of Teddy’s voice and the feeling of little feet kicking into his side.
Thank you for reading! These past few days have been really busy, but I do really appreciate your comments and seeing your reactions!
“I’m sure you’re clever enough to figure it out,” Malfoy said, pulling his hand away from Harry, who was left to wonder why the room suddenly felt so warm.
Blegh, chestnuts. I went for the very obvious song lyric for this one, since I like the song a lot more than I like the food. These boys are really not cooperating for longer parts! Thank you for reading!
Draco rested his head on one arm and traced his fingers over the scar that covered the left side of Harry’s chest. It started in the centre, right above his heart, where the Dark Lord’s curse had struck and spread like lightning over Harry’s skin.
He needed to get that book sooner rather than later. Besides, he could almost hear Hermione lecturing him about not avoiding his problems, and Malfoy had definitely become a problem.
Draco tucked his hair behind his ear, hoping the flush in his cheeks wasn’t as noticeable as it felt. He opened his mouth, but didn’t have a chance to utter a word before the door to the telephone booth was yanked open. Both Draco and the stranger turned to see the woman from earlier--Hermione, Draco’s mind provided--glowering at the pair of them.
“It’s nothing new,” Harry said with a shrug. “To be honest, I don’t think I’ve had more than a few hours’ sleep at a time since about fourth year.”
Of all the letters and invitations they’d received in the past few weeks, Harry had a feeling this was going to give them the most trouble. He and Draco stared down at the letter that had just been delivered by Narcissa’s owl, the sleek eagle owl Harry had always assumed belonged to Draco at school.
“And this is my grandfather on my mother’s side, Cygnus Black III,” Draco said, tapping his finger against the beautifully embroidered tapestry. It was loads nicer than the Black Family Tapestry had been, but Harry wasn’t sure if that was due to care or money.
“No, she’s not,” Harry said calmly. “She’s not going to be in her office anyway, so you’ll be safe enough.”
Trust is Harry being able to bow his head to a hippogriff. It’s exposing the back of his neck to that sharp beak and talons, and hoping he’ll be safe. Trust is making Draco know Harry can be trusted, because beneath the sharp words and the cold grey eyes, Harry knows Draco is vulnerable, just waiting to attack, to defend. Harry knows, because Harry is the same way. To Harry, trust is knowing he and Draco will make it out alive.
Harry made a frustrated sound and pushed away Draco’s fretting hands. "I’m not a child," he snapped.
“Right after I thank him for the Wheezes quill he slipped into my bag a few weeks ago,” Harry said lightly. Andromeda’s smile faded, and Harry knew she wanted to ask how he and Ron were getting on, but he didn’t want to ruin the evening with his answer. Draco cleared his throat slightly.
“I’ve never really been one for wine,” Harry said, following Draco into the living room. “I haven’t really had a chance to
He averted his gaze, staring out over the grounds once more. He shivered. He’d completely forgotten the rain. It didn’t feel like rain.
"And I am angry at Dumbledore. I’m angry at every person who made it my job to end that war. I’m angry at myself for following blindly and
They did have an owl, but Isidora was a temperamental and rather large barn owl. She was a pet, yes, but she wasn’t really a
As he tried to back away and turn to run at the same time in shin-deep snow, Harry stumbled, falling forward into the freezing powder. He scrambled to his feet, just in time for Draco to throw another snowball.
"Harry, if you apologise again, I will burn every single one of those horrible argyle socks you keep buying."
After the war, Harry stops playing quidditch. He lets people assume it's because of injuries, because he can't bear playing without half of his friends, can't bear seeing Ginny. In reality, the Golden Snitch has become one of his worst nightmares.
The next hour of Harry’s life was full of heartfelt thanks for things he hadn’t done and uncomfortable encounters with people who just wanted to say they’d met him. Uncomfortable, Harry could handle.
Harry can remember, after Voldemort was gone at last, seeing Draco in the Great Hall. He'd been seated beside his mother's body, alone. His father had fled when it became obvious the battle was lost. Draco had cried silently in his corner, so unlike the sobs of Molly Weasley when she'd found out she'd lost two of her sons.
Funnily enough, the prompt for today is currently my desktop background. Thank you for reading and Happy Solstice!
Draco hadn’t worn the ring since the end of the War. He stared down at it, heavy and cold in his palm. He hated it.
Harry opened his eyes and tried to focus on Draco, on his grey eyes and his slightly pointed nose, but the memories pushed forth, images flashing through Harry’s mind.
“I’m not allowed. You should know that, considering you’re the only reason I’m here instead of under house arrest, or in Azkaban.”
It was late, nearly three am, when Harry approached the door to the drawing room. It was haunting his dreams, his every thought, and he had to see what it had become. He gripped the cold metal of the handle and turned it slowly, wincing as the hinges creaked as he pushed the door open.
Harry waited until he was alone to open the book. Hermione’s letter was neatly folded and tucked beneath the cover. With it was a small folded square of parchment, with a small sprig of holly drawn on the front in green ink. Harry opened it and saw three words printed in the centre of the page.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco said, picking up Harry’s still-full wineglass along with his own. “Mother got out the good stationary. The least you could do is listen to what she has to say.”
Harry adds a few marshmallows and drinks. They don't talk, but for the first time in a while, Harry feels kind of alright.
To clear his mind and escape the grief that had threatened to suffocate him, Harry had apparated to Godric’s Hollow. He’d expected the small village to be as still and quiet as it’d been the previous year, but he’d arrived in the middle of a celebration. He’d nearly gone right home, but after a moment’s thought, he’d walked towards the noise and the lights and the excitement.
“Not to mention it’s considered incredibly bad manners to portkey right into somebody’s house,” Draco added. “And it doesn’t matter anyway. We’re nearly there.”
“Draco,” Harry said, backing away. “Draco, remember how much you love me and that it’s Christmas and if I don't come back, somebody will—agh!”
“You’re not allowed to hex me when I step on your feet,” Harry muttered. He didn’t think Draco actually would, but just in case, Harry looked down at his feet when Draco stepped forward.
Harry rolled his eyes at that, and then winced when Draco squeezed his shoulder and shook him slightly.
“I know even your eyesight isn’t so bad that you can’t notice there’s only one gift on the table,” he said quietly.
grin he always got when he knew he’d won an argument. At least it wasn’t an expression Draco had to see very often.
He rummaged through the pockets of his robe and pulled out a small scrap of parchment. Harry was tempted to ask if he actually owned a full roll, but held his tongue.
It was cold and entirely too early to be trekking through the snow. He hadn’t even had time for coffee, thanks to Draco’s forgetting to set some sort of alarm the night before. (Of course, Draco insisted that it was Harry’s fault, which it wasn’t. They both knew not to depend on Harry to set the alarm, because he would forget. He always forgot.)
“Thanks,” Harry said, taking the book. “I realised once class started, but I wasn’t really expecting a hand delivery. I would have come to get it myself, if--”
"It’s just a few more hours, and then we can leave," Draco said, sounding like he was trying to reassure himself just as much as he was Harry.
Harry laughed. “I always forget just how little you know about the Muggle World,” he said. “Come on. I’ll explain it when we get back to Grimmauld Place.”
This is it! This is the end! Merry Christmas and thank you for sticking around through these past 25 days!
This is extra early today because I have a lot to do! This is mostly based on my absolute need for coffee right now. I hope you enjoyed!
“Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers.” -Charles William Eliot
“No, but if you look closely, you’ll see the tapestry’s changed.” Draco pointed to where Harry James Potter had appeared in the space beside his own. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish showing Harry the house. Have a good afternoon, father.”
“I won’t let anything happen,” Harry promised, taking Draco’s scarf and draping it over his shoulders. He smoothed his hands over Draco’s shoulders and pulled him in for a kiss. “Ready?”
“Yeah, I suppose so,” Draco responded sarcastically. “Usually, the limit is one and the side-effect is death.”
The library was deserted. Harry preferred it that way; fewer people around to stare at him as he walked through the shelves. There were always a few who would give him startled looks as he went into the Restricted Section and came out with books on Dark magic that hadn’t been touched in decades.
1. I just realized that there are only TWELVE MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS. 2. I am going to be working on finals this week, so updates will probably be shorter. 3. Thank you for reading!
"People died because the Dark Lord was a raving lunatic! They died because of his hatred and his need for power. They died because he was so afraid of death that he would do anything to prevent it, and exactly none of that is your fault!"
travelling by Floo—before he had an armful of three year old. He hugged Teddy close to his chest and noticed his hair was incredibly similar to Harry’s own.
As Harry met Draco’s gaze, his eyes glowed unnaturally green in the moonlight. “Snakes,” he said. “I liked them before second year.”
“If you’re so bothered with walking, you could always go sit with my parents.” Draco raised an eyebrow, challenging, if just a bit irritated.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, pointing at a red telephone booth ahead of them. “I’ve seen them all over today.”
Harry was halfway to Gryffindor Tower when he realized he’d never asked Malfoy what he was doing in the girl’s lavatory too.
There were few things Harry hated more about the holidays than mistletoe. His knowledge of the castle’s secret passages had helped him in the past, but they were all still blocked off from the year before. This meant that Harry instead had to concentrate very hard on not walking too close to anybody, lest he find himself in a situation he would much rather avoid.
Harry sighed and tucked the card  into his pocket. He stood up, pulled on his jumper, and crept from Gryffindor Tower.
This is the first time I've broken 300 words since like day two of this fest. I hope you enjoyed and, as always, thank you for reading!
“I’ll never understand what it is with you and that scar,” Harry said, closing his eyes and allowing himself to feel Draco’s touch. “It’s horrible.”
Andromeda hummed. “Saturday,” she said. “I’m just pleased Draco’s willing to brew the Wolfsbane for him every month, even if Teddy despises the taste.”
Harry knew the rumours that were buzzing around school about him: that he was a Dark wizard himself; that he’d gained Voldemort’s power after he’d died; that he was immortal, and could never truly be killed.
Draco went very quiet, and for a horrifying moment, Harry thought he might burst into tears. Instead, he picked up a cookie and bit into it, a small smile on his face.
“It’s going to fucking bruise. It always does. Bloody Malfoy complexion--I bruise if you tap me on the shoulder.”
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it's over! Thank you everyone for reading and for your comments! Even though I didn't respond to many, which I usually try to do, I did read every single one of them, and they kept me motivated while writing this
Harry feels like he did during fifth year, like he did every time Dumbledore ignored him, or someone accused him of being a liar. He feels like he did after Sirius had fallen through the veil and Dumbledore just sat at his desk looking sadder and older than Harry had ever seen him. Draco conjures a shield as the dummies explode and the Room creates more to be destroyed.
“That’s not really what I meant,” said Harry, blowing gently over the top of his mug. “I just wanted to know why you brought the jelly beans.”
that was sitting at his elbow. It seemed harmless, sitting there on the desk. He looked back at Malfoy.
I forgot that I have plans tonight that will go past midnight, so here's a shorter one for today! Thank you all again for reading and commenting! I'm having so much fun writing this! :D
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of angry shouting around the corner. He hurried down the hall as quickly as his exhausted legs would take him, drawing his wand as he went. When he rounded the corner, he saw two boys kicking someone on the ground.
Draco leaned against the wall of the telephone booth and listened wearily to his mother chattering on about the weather in France. Really, he did like hearing from his mother, but she certainly had a talent for prattling on about nothing in particular.
Harry took a deep breath. He hadn’t slept the night before, despite how tired he’d been. It was always hard for him to sleep in Grimmauld Place.
“And here I thought you were happy to see me!” he put Teddy down and allowed himself to be pulled into a tight hug by Andromeda.
After the whirlwind of funerals and ceremonies, Harry had hidden himself away as well as he could—he still wasn’t sure how he’d managed to run into Draco, of all people, but nobody could deny he and Draco had always gravitated towards each other.
Harry turned and immediately felt someone collide with him. A flowery scent hit his nostrils, and he knew it was Ginny he was holding. He grinned against her shoulder and lifted her off the floor.
"You don’t believe that, do you?" Draco asked softly. He looked angry, but Harry knew better than to think that anger was meant for him.
The rest of the morning went on without incident. Harry managed to escape four different sixth year girls, in addition to--much to Harry’s surprise--a seventh year boy.
There was a crowd downstairs celebrating Dumbledore as if he’d been a good man and Harry as if he’d been a brave one, while all Harry wanted to do was forget everything that had ever happened.
Harry pulled a book from the shelf and added it to the stack that was levitating before him. He double checked the titles and then made his way to his favourite table by the fireplace and its warmth, only to find that it was already occupied.
"It’s wonderful of you both to come," said Professor McGonagall. "I can’t imagine it’s easy for you to be here." She squeezed Harry’s free hand between both of her own and then did the same with Draco, who looked genuinely surprised by the action.
“A ticket for the Hogwarts Express,” he murmured, feeling strangely choked up. He hadn’t seen one since his sixth year. “It’s awfully pretty for a portkey, isn’t it?”
"I didn't think to get you anything…" he says a bit awkwardly. Draco waves him off and tells him to get ready for lunch.
I wrote up something in my notebook and on my way to dance, my mind was like "But here's a better idea!" So here you go. Thank you for reading, and I plan to respond to comments tomorrow! They are a delight to read and I love that you're enjoying this so far!
“Fine,” Harry said quickly. “I was going to wait until later, but I thought maybe you’d appreciate it more if we didn’t do this in front of a bunch of people, so you can feel free to refuse without feeling pressured.”
“I was trying to make a wreath,” Harry snapped. “But I can’t. Just like I can’t transfigure anything larger than a mouse, or keep my champagne flute from shattering in Charms when we do the Unbreakable Charm.”
“Come on, then,” said Harry. “Let’s go to the shops. I went once with the Dursleys and saw a tree made entirely of wine bottles.”
Harry tumbled forward out of the fireplace and was only saved from falling by Draco’s tight grip on his arm.
It was quiet and cold as Harry walked through the early morning streets of London. There was a layer of ice on the grass and trees, and Harry walked slowly to avoid slipping. It wasn’t silent, by any means, but there was a peacefulness to the scene that Harry knew could only be attributed to the fact the sun hadn’t quite finished rising.
He’d been at this for ages, trying to create the white rose wreath that had seemed so simple when Hermione had done it the year before.
Draco shivered slightly as he slid the cool, silver ring onto his finger. He hated this ring and how it made him feel like the scared little boy who would do anything to make his father proud. His fists clenched and suddenly all he knew was the regret and the hatred and the fear that threatened every moment to swallow him whole.
“I suppose it must be, if Hermione’s calling me out on it,” said Harry. “Worrying about dying from year to year didn’t really give me a lot of time to figure out my romantic interests, I guess. Is that okay?”
“I know you eat treacle tart like it’s bloody going out of style, so I opted for a sweeter red.” Draco poured the wine. “It’s practically fruit juice at this point.”
“You know what he did!” one of them shouted. Harry was crestfallen to see the boy was wearing a Gryffindor tie.
It was always the same, that swooping feeling in his stomach at the first glance of the tree. The tree was always gigantic--the Dursleys wouldn’t be seen with anything but the absolute best, after all--towering over him in a way that should have been terrifying, but just filled him with a wonderful feeling, like he’d sipped something fizzy. He’d take in the lights that somehow managed to make even the Dursleys’ house feel just a little bit magical. He’d breathe, slow and deep, letting his eyes drift closed as the scent enveloped him. And then, he’d sit, staring up at the lights and the ornaments, and for a while, everything would feel okay.
“I can’t keep my hands steady, my legs shake so badly they ache, and I just feel exhausted all the time. I can’t fly, I can’t run, I can’t do anything!” Harry gave a bitter laugh. “I guess there are only so many times you can survive the Killing Curse without any side-effects.”
“Are you sure it’s alright I come?” Draco asked, anxiously twisting his scarf in his hands. “I mean, everyone’s always thrilled to see you, but there’s a reason I’m working at a Muggle school.”
“I haven’t been here since before I went to Hogwarts. I never thought this house could feel like this,” said Draco quietly.
“It’s a yes or no question, Harry,” Draco said patiently, though his expression was anything but. Harry grimaced.
open the book. It was a very small chance, but it was there. Though, the last time Malfoy had ended up with somebody else’s mail tucked into book, Harry had nearly been expelled for smuggling a dragon.
“Shit! Mother, I’ll have to call you back in a moment,” Draco said quickly, remembering that he was, in fact, in the middle of a long-distance call on a payphone. “Tell father I said hello.”
Draco loved to be the first to wake in the morning. It wasn’t unusual--Draco’s job meant early mornings more often than it didn’t, and Harry’s day started considerably later. What
“Is it going to be that lengthy of a conversation?” asked Harry. “Do you want to visit your parents for Christmas?”
“She’s in France.” Draco pushed his hair out of his face and grimaced apologetically at Harry. “I’d love to spend Christmas with you, Harry.”
Three days after Christmas, Harry wakes screaming. This time, he's not alone. Draco's sitting on the end of Harry's bed, looking more concerned than Harry feels he has any right to be.
“Harry, look at me,” Draco murmured, still moving, even as Harry gripped his hand more tightly and didn’t look up. “
He pulled Draco away from the booth and found a nearby tourist shop. He made Draco wait outside as he dashed inside.
The evening was theirs, but when the house had gone still and Harry knew everyone was asleep, he’d creep silently from his cupboard to where the tree stood fully lit in the front window.
Harry laughed and faced Draco. “I’ve always been shit at acting,” he said. He pressed a short kiss to Draco’s lips. “Good morning.”
. He knows surnames are used between acquaintances, but all he wants to be is Harry. He doesn't want to be Potter any more than Draco wants to be Malfoy.
“I know I was a little shit about my money in school, but I’d like to think I had more tact than that,” Draco sniffed.
Draco hummed absentmindedly at whatever his mother was saying. He was really too tired to handle dinner with her right now, after the week he'd had. As much fun as it was to wind Harry up every chance he got, there was quite a bit of stress on Draco's part, particularly the part where he still had to tell his mother he was engaged.
“Aren’t you going to ask what the portkey is?” Draco asked, following with his eyes as Harry went to set Teddy’s neatly wrapped gift on the small pile beside the tree.
Lucius took the ring between two fingers, hand shaking. He laughed bitterly and he looked down at it in the palm of his hand. “I suppose you’re not your father’s son after all.”
“Careful, that’s your future mother-in-law you’re talking about,” Draco said sternly, though his smile told Harry he was teasing. “The coldness is practically bred into us. It’s a defense mechanism. After a while you learn to turn it on and off. Oh, here we are.”
"Everyone keeps calling me brave, like walking into the forest was some great adventure, like I was anything more than Dumbledore’s puppet!" Harry slumped against the stone behind him, thoroughly exhausted. "I almost didn’t come back," he murmured.
Hermione looked startled for a moment. “Well, if that’s the case,” she said carefully, putting on a brave smile, “you might as well take the rest of this home with you. You can’t have Christmas without Molly’s baking.”
Harry nodded. “I wasn’t expecting her to hug me,” he said. “Seems...I don’t know. She always seemed so...cold to me.”
“Not unless you want me to.” Harry’s voice sounded just a little bit hopeful. “But if you’d like, it can be just a ring. It’s charmed to fit whatever finger you wear it on, mostly because I remember the time my Aunt Petunia accidentally washed her wedding ring down the drain and I had to—“
“But that’s not the only thing that brought you to this room.” When Harry didn’t respond, Narcissa went on. “I was surprised to hear you and Draco were coming,” she said. “I thought, after all the terrible things that happened in this place, neither of you would dare step through its doors...It’s the only room in the house I haven’t touched since the war. It felt too much like trying to forget the past.”
Harry could swear he felt the temperature of the room drop a few degrees when Lucius smiled at that. The smile was sharp and cold, and Harry was thrown back to that night at the Ministry, when he thought that smile would be the last thing he ever saw.
“I used to be,” said Harry, looking down and tracing the patterns in the wood with his finger. “In fifth year, he was--we had a connection, through my scar and--”
“You’re getting old, Harry,” Draco teased, lifting the blanket so Harry could sit beside him on the couch. “Practically ancient.”
He could still hear Neville’s promise that they would all keep fighting, could still see Ginny hugging that young girl to her chest and promising her it would all be okay soon.
I laughed for a good 15 minutes when I saw this prompt. I was both horrified and amused, and very glad it doesn't actually exist. (If it does exist, please PLEASE do not let me know.) Thank you for reading!
Twenty minutes and a lot of bickering later, Harry managed to get Draco into a pair of black trousers and a dark blue jumper.
But these were the days Harry stayed near, smelling of spice and earth and something Draco couldn’t quite name as Harry curled around him. They were the days Draco would breathe and remember: sometimes it took a hero to slay a dragon.
Draco was silent for a long moment, then: “My mother and I once stumbled upon a herd of unicorn. It’s the happiest I’ve ever felt.”
Cutting it a bit close tonight! It's 11:36pm EST, so I should stop typing this and post! Thank you for reading!
Malfoy ignored him. “I thought we should get to know each other,” he said. “So each of us is going to take turns asking a question. The other is welcome not to answer it, but must then reach blindly into this bag of Every Flavour Beans.”
Pretending he hadn’t heard Draco, Harry said too enthusiastically, “Look, Teddy! That one looks like the Hogwarts Express!”
The lights made Draco glow red and green and blue, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from crossing the room and pulling Draco into his arms. Their lips collided almost painfully, but neither of them seemed to care as they stumbled backwards towards the bed.
“You’re being childish.” A bit of tomato sauce spilled over the side of the pot onto the stove top, and Draco figured he should probably stir a bit less violently. “They’re disgusting creatures.”
"I never wanted to leave. I dreamt of staying here over the summer instead of going back to the Dursleys’, but Dumbledore always insisted I’d be safer in Surrey." Harry laughed, but there was little humour to the sound. "At least until I turned seventeen."
“I’ll be in the library,” Harry murmured. He squeezed Draco’s hand once and walked silently from the room.
“I was going to ask if you wanted to come to Grimmauld Place for Christmas,” said Harry. “I just thought, since I’m not going to the Weasleys, but I forgot about your mother. You should spend Christmas with her.”
Thank you for reading! I'm traveling today, so this is up a bit earlier than usual for me. Also, LOVE the prompt today. I love it when ice does this, assuming I don't have to go outside.
Harry lay in bed, running his fingers over Malfoy’s handwriting. There were indents in the paper, as if Malfoy had pressed his quill hard against the parchment. He felt like a lovesick girl, and he was wondering how he went from cautiously apathetic of Malfoy to practically besotted over the course of six days.
“We went one year...I can’t remember how old I was, but I remember that the lights seemed like magic all on their own. I still don’t know how Muggles make them glow like that.” Malfoy smiled to himself. “They were in the trees, and in the air, and on the buildings. They were beautiful.”
Draco raised his hands in surrender. “If it’s all the same to you, I’m the one who convinced him to come tonight, and I’d greatly appreciate it if the pair of us could make it home in one piece.”
The room was empty, but a fire was lit, and there she was, sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace in her usual elegant clothes. Purple, from what he could see by the firelight as she turned to face him.
From the look on his face, Harry knew Draco didn’t believe his lie for a second. To Harry’s relief, Draco didn’t comment. From the set of his shoulders, Harry knew Draco didn’t want to be here anymore than he did.
Harry laughed. “You would have,” he said. “It doesn’t matter anyway. I wouldn’t be asleep right now, even if I was curled up in my own little bed.”
“Hermione, should we at least address the elephant in the room?” Harry asked finally. Hermione picked through a small basket of trinkets with one hand, a steaming cup of mulled wine in the other.
“Hermione’s a bit...intense about school, has been since I met her. She’s on a bit of a warpath right now, which is why I didn’t just
Harry knew he should have comforted Ginny, but instead he went over and sat beside Draco. They didn't say anything, didn't really need to, but it was enough.
“You’ve never been to Muggle London before,” Harry said, locking the door and walking down his front steps.
“It’s like they don’t think I’m a real person!” Harry said angrily as he and Draco sat in the Astronomy Tower later that night. “I’d be less angry if people bothered to asked me if I wanted to be kissed.”
"That doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to ask for help." Draco handed Harry his cane, a beautifully crafted thing made of hawthorn with a curved handle made of holly. Harry took it, finding comfort in the way the smooth handle fit in his hand, and let Draco lead the way down to the fireplace.
Running a hand over his face, Harry settled Teddy’s gift in his lap. “No,” he said. “Well, yes...I mean--I don’t know what I mean. There’s this part of me that really wants them to like me, because I know how important they are to you, but I can’t forget what they did before all that, even if your mother is essentially the reason I’m alive right now.”
He had told him, but Harry wasn’t about to admit that. He hadn’t even asked for a hangover potion that morning, a decision he was beginning to regret.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. “At this rate, we’re going to end up with either a pygmy puff or a blast-ended skrewt.”
“I told my friend Hermione I couldn’t revise with her today because I had rehearsal, which she figured out wasn’t true when I made eye-contact with her crossing the street three minutes ago.”
This was going to be slightly different, but I suppose that'll have to wait until a later part, because I am bad at managing my time. Also, finals week(s). Thank you for reading! :D
“Ron doesn't hate you because you like men, Harry,” Hermione said calmly over the dinner he'd helped her cook. “In fact he doesn’t hate you at all.”
live in the Louvre. I just needed to get the boys to his house, but that is the reason why it's mentioned that Narcissa's in Paris. (Artistic license or something.) Thank you for reading!
Usually, he was okay. The fire didn’t frighten him, and he could see the beauty of burning embers and orange flames. But occasionally, all he could see was danger.
So while doing research (read: looking up how to spell 'poinsettia'), I learned that the "flowers" are actually a type of specialized leaf! ~The more you know~
“We’ve only got a few more hours before we have to be back to school,” said Harry. “There’s one last thing I want to show you.”
“I used to cook for the Dursleys,” Harry said. “It was one of the few chores I actually liked while I was there.”
It was like he’d fallen ten years into the past. The portraits of the former Headmasters were still hanging, and Harry suspected the majority of them were simply pretending to be asleep. Unable to stop himself, Harry allowed his eyes to travel down the rows of portraits until he found the two he least wanted to see.
hate bathrooms. (All of the CoS scenes in the bathroom with them sitting on the floor just make me shudder.) I tried to figure out so many ways to work this out, but this is the only way that wanted to cooperate. Thank you for reading!
Draco looked up, finally, and smiled. “What do you think my mother meant when she invited us to spend Christmas with them at the Manor?”
“Oh, he was absolutely horrible,” Draco said pleasantly. “One Christmas, he gave me a set of cursed Gobstones, to teach me a lesson of some sort. Mother nearly killed him.”
Malfoy stared at Harry, and for a long moment, all Harry could do was stare back. He watched the orange  reflection of the flames dance in Malfoy’s eyes, and then quickly looked away.
He squeezed Harry’s arm briefly and left the room. Harry waited until he heard Draco going up the stairs before leaning against the counter and covering his face with his hands.
“You know he and Mal--Draco don’t get on well,” Hermione said, grimacing when Harry snorted. “Okay, so that’s putting it gently, I know. But he’s also feeling a bit betrayed you didn’t tell us. I did, too, at first.”
“And I’m doing what I know is right for me,” Draco said, and looked at his father at last. “I know you did what you thought was right, but it wasn’t, and I’m doing everything I can to make things better. Harry saved me, he saved this family, and if your petty hatred won’t let you see that, then you’re going to have to blast me off this tapestry, because I won’t be your son anymore.”
"Professor McGonagall," Harry said in greeting, relaxing slightly when Draco rested his hand against his lower back.
Draco had schooled his expression into one of indifference, but Harry could see the light, embarrassed flush on his cheeks.
Lucius Malfoy’s smooth voice cut through the room, making both Draco and Harry jump. As usual, Draco was the first to recover.
They lapsed into silence once more, neither of them speaking until they approached the hospital doors. Malfoy looked up at them and sighed.
“Please, I would’ve died by the time you made it halfway down the stairs,” responded Malfoy. He pulled the strap of his bag higher onto his shoulder. “See you around, Potter.”
“It’s been too long,” he said, and was surprised when she pulled away and slapped him hard on the shoulder.
“Then I’ll have to stay near you. You know, in case dementors attack.” Harry grinned at Draco’s exasperated expression.
Draco chose his words carefully, picking at the blanket. “Sometimes, I hear you hiss in your sleep.”
Sometimes, he thinks he sees a flash out of the corner of his eye, and turns to reprimand Colin, only to remember that Colin and his camera are gone.
Their shoes crunched quietly in the snow as Harry led the way to his parents’ graves. Neither of them spoke as Harry conjured a wreath of Christmas roses and rested it on the ground. He straightened and cleared his throat, brushing his snowy hands on his trousers. He smiled weakly.
Finally, Harry raised his gaze, stumbling as he did so. Draco was kind enough not to wince too obviously when Harry trod on his foot.
"Harry." Draco’s voice was soft, but clear enough that it brought Harry back. He blinked and did his best to focus his gaze on Draco’s grey eyes.
Draco snorted. “That’s not a cat, it’s a bloody monster.” He ran the end of his quill absentmindedly over his bottom lip. “I’d suggest a snake, but you’d simply hiss at it all the time, and I wouldn’t know if you were griping about me, so that’s definitely out.  And I’ve never liked rodents.”
"I’m not—he only did what he thought was best." Harry tried to pull away from Draco, but Draco’s grip stayed firm. "It was for—"
“Typically, when I see someone going to a party, I expect them to be excited…you two look like you’re preparing for battle,” Narcissa said pleasantly from where she sat on the couch before the fireplace.
“You boys certainly took your time getting here!” she said, pulling away to wrap her arms around Draco. “I thought Teddy was going to lose his mind waiting for you two! I’ve already had to hide the Christmas crackers from him. Remind me to thank Ronald for teaching Teddy how to use those last year.” She rolled her eyes.
Is it okay to call plum pudding a cake? We don't have it here. Also, I nearly forgot the prompt. I hope you enjoyed! <3
“I don’t think you’ve got enough sickles, Malfoy,” Harry said, sliding the letter into one of his books. “Are you following me?”
"That doesn’t make you stupid, Harry," Draco said, calmly leaning against the rampart, arms and legs crossed. "It just makes Dumbledore clever in all the wrong ways."
They walked together, the silence between them so heavy that it was almost making it difficult to breathe.
Harry felt the cool wood of his cane being pressed against his palm. Draco was speaking quickly, Harry could tell by the way his lips moved, but it was as though Harry were watching through a thick pane of glass: he couldn’t hear anything. Panicked, Harry shook his head, and before he knew it, he was being led quickly from the hall.
He saw it all, then: the rubble, the injuries, the heavy, pressing feeling that came with knowing one wrong move could easily be your last.
Draco’s eyes flitted over Harry’s face, his gaze too intense and too personal for such a public setting. Harry couldn’t bring himself to care. Draco knew Harry—he was probably the only one who really did anymore--and if there was anything Harry wanted people to see, it was that.
“Ron and Hermione don’t invite us places, Harry. They invite you.” Draco reached out and grasped Harry’s hand. “Look, they must really love you if they’re willing to put up with my ferrety self for a night. I doubt Hermione would invite us without Ron’s knowing. Maybe he’s…” Draco paused. “We’re going. We have to.”
“If you don’t speak, I’m going to have to start asking you questions. We have two more floors to go.”
Draco laughed, though not unkindly. “As much as I love them, I don’t think even I could handle them for two whole weeks.”
“Harry! I didn’t expect to see you!” Ron pulled Harry into a hug. Harry stumbled slightly, but returned the hug, surprised as he realised just how much he’d missed Ron.
.” Harry sighed and sank into a nearby chair, dropping his head into his trembling hands as the wreaths went up in flames.
He focused on the curve of the wreath, and the sweet, strong scent of the roses and the sharp pine. He could feel Draco’s warmth through the fabric of his cloak, and felt Draco’s hand gripping his, guiding it smoothly and steadily through the wand movements.
The bathroom was as still and empty as ever. He wasn’t even sure Myrtle hung around here much anymore. He walked towards the tap that never worked and felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise.
Sometimes, Draco awoke in the middle of the night with fire blazing behind his eyelids, with the terror of death strangling him in his sleep. It was always the same, watching Crabbe falling to his death, and praying that somebody would be kind enough to tell his mother goodbye for him.
There were few things Harry enjoyed more than he enjoyed coffee these days. The problem with being friends, or whatever they were, with Draco was that Draco seemed to run on a schedule opposite Harry’s. Whether they were going to eat or to study, it always seemed to be just minutes after Harry managed to fall asleep.
Draco and Harry seem to gravitate toward each other after that night. They're not friends, exactly, but they aren't enemies; they'd had enough of that to last three lifetimes. They sit together at meals and during class; help with some of the repairs that had been forgotten over the summer. When they study together in the common room, no one says anything when Harry falls asleep with his head on Draco's shoulder and a book in his lap. No one says anything when he awakes almost peacefully.
Harry turned to see Ron walking towards him, frowning slightly at Draco’s presence. Beside Harry, Draco stiffened.
“We’re, uh, seeing the sights,” Harry said. “Draco’s never seen Muggle London, so I thought I’d show him.”
"We were all children, Draco." Harry knocked Draco’s hand from his shoulder and took another step away, tightly gripping the wet handle of his cane to keep himself balanced.
“Well, we had yesterday morning to ourselves,” Draco said, a smirk playing on his lips. “It’s not my fault that you weren’t very quiet.”
“What? Oh, yes,” Andromeda said, cheer back just as quickly as it’d gone. “It’s nearly ready. Would either of you like something to drink while we wait?”
They’d stayed in the Astronomy Tower long enough that Harry had actually begun to feel tired. However, he still wasn’t quite sure where he stood with Draco. The letter was true, and Draco had read it, but that was as far as they’d got.
“You were so upset the other day,” said Harry. “I thought maybe you’d be happier with a different ring.”
Compared to the year before, this December was particularly calm, but Harry still felt restless. He wasn’t accustomed to normal life, and he’d not had much of a break between the end of the war, the trials, and returning to Hogwarts. There hadn’t been time to think about what had happened in that year, and Harry hadn’t wanted to.
And then Harry felt like he was choking, and all he could see was the blood and Nagini striking again and again until—
But now, Draco was here, and all Harry could think about was the way he’d looked that night in the Room of Requirement, or in the cellar of Malfoy Manor. Harry couldn’t forget the fear in Draco’s eyes that night in the Astronomy Tower.
A long moment of silence passed, then, “The basilisk kills me every time. I don’t mind; it means everybody lives, in the end.”
“Right,” Malfoy said. He picked up Harry’s cane and handed it to him. Finally, he said, “So what’s that for, then?”
“That’s technically two questions, Malfoy,” Harry pointed out. At Malfoy’s scowl, he answered. “It’s not out of pity. I guess now that neither of us can be bothered to fight, we actually have some stuff in common. I know you won’t just give me worried looks about things I can’t help.”
“When you’re the one destined to kill a maniac, people tend to turn a blind eye when you break the rules.”
The reporters waiting in the entry hall went silent as Draco, Harry, and McGonagall approached. Harry flushed, feeling his anxiety spike and the trembling of his hands to increase. They gazed up at him, star-struck and a little bit teary; Harry wondered if they even realised he was human.
Harry awoke to the feeling of Draco’s fingers tracing over the scar on his chest. He turned his head away, trying to pretend to still be asleep, but Draco knew him better than that.
“Okay, so I think this turned out alright,” Harry said, levitating two plates onto the dining room table. “It doesn’t look too pretty, but it should taste good enough.”
“I was so afraid I was going to be like him, that I was going to hurt people because I could, because I
“Harry, look! Look!” Teddy wriggled in Harry’s arms, reaching out towards the large castle built entirely of snow. “A castle!”
“It’s too late for me to back out now,” Harry said. “I don’t want to, anyway. Draco’s been really good about this entire thing. We understand each other.”
The cracker came apart with a bang and a cloud of smoke. Harry fanned it away and reached into the cylinder to find only a scrap of parchment.
It’s in the middle of Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry feels the pressure building behind his eyes. His magic bursts from him, uprooting tables and parchment like they are little more than leaves in the wind.
“It’s a telephone booth. What else would I be doing in here?” Draco considered this for a moment. “Other than hiding. Why
Draco silently took the ring from its box and slid it onto his ring finger. He held it in front of his face, pretending not to notice how widely Harry was grinning, or the swoop of exhilaration in his stomach at the—strange, but not unpleasant—sight of the thin silver band around his finger.
Harry closed his eyes, inhaled, and then quietly said, “I remember, during the war, Hermione and I didn’t even know it was Christmas until we got to Godric’s Hollow. They were singing in the church, and I could see the candles through the window …" Harry paused. "Looking back, I feel like I should have been sad, but I think I felt…relieved, in a way.”
The weekend came faster than Harry had expected. Before he knew it, he’d turned in his final assignment and was packing his trunk for the winter holiday.
Draco smiled a bit sadly and pressed a kiss to Harry’s jaw. “Would you like to write the response or shall I?”
She smiled slightly and stood. Harry made to do the same, but was stopped by a gentle hand on his shoulder.
A pillow soared across the room and hit Harry squarely in the face. “Don’t be daft. I was talking about a pygmy puff. Does Weasley still sell them?”
Behind them, somebody quietly cleared their throat. Draco turned, moving to stand beside Harry as McGonagall walked slowly down the stairs and past her desk. Harry was struck by how old she looked—it’d been too long since he’d last seen her face.
“You probably could,” Draco said, “but if not, you do always have the option to rap them with your cane. Or, an even better idea, hex them.”
to. He and I were alike in so many ways, and there are still times I wonder what would have happened if the Hat had put me in Slytherin like it wanted. Where would we be today?”
“I’ll firecall George in the morning and ask,” said Harry, his smile feeling a bit forced as he set the pillow aside. It still felt strange to refer to George on his own. Harry shook his head slightly to clear his thoughts.
Harry hummed distractedly from where he was sat in front of their DVD player. It’d taken a lot of time and a lot of complicated magic to get it to work, and if he wasn’t going to undo all of that, he had to pay attention to what he was doing.
Draco reached over and linked his fingers with Harry's, and together they walked through the snow towards the sound of celebration.
What he couldn’t handle was Dennis Creevey, a strange image of his older brother, had his brother lived past sixteen; Lavender Brown, beautiful, scarred, and broken; and George Weasley, looking happy, if just a little bit
And it was true. The rage he’d felt earlier was back and it was growing with every passing second. Draco’s jaw clenched, and he nodded stiffly, but Harry was already speaking.
“You don’t need to worry about that, Harry. What my parents think about our relationship didn’t matter in sixth year and it doesn’t matter now, not to me,” Draco said. “And we can leave whenever you need. Besides, it’s not as though we’re going to be trapped at the Manor for two weeks, if that’s what you were imagining.”
I'm home! This is partially inspired by the fact my girlfriend's family very much likes to dress their cats up. (They also look a lot like the ones in the pic.) Happy reading!
“It’s a bloody tragedy, if you ask me. It takes nothing short of a miracle to convince a three year old to take a potion that foul.” She scowled and tucked her dark brown hair behind her ear. “Still, having you two come around always helps. Teddy never fails to get excited about that.”
Harry managed to huff out a laugh. He handed the ticket back to Draco.“I’m going to start dinner. I’ll call you when it’s ready.”
Draco ran his hand over Harry’s chest and down the flat pane of his stomach. Harry’s breath caught, and Draco grinned.
“Say those words to me again, Potter, and I will hex you into oblivion,” Draco said, snatching the jacket from Harry and stalking out the door. Harry smiled to himself and followed.
It wasn’t really something a lot of people knew about him; it wasn’t as though he spent his time speaking extensively about rodents. Plus, he knew it was a fairly irrational fear, if one took it at face value. Unfortunately for him, Harry hadn’t taken anything Draco did at face value in a very long time.
“I think, if either of us is in the place to comment on whether or not something is embarrassing to the Malfoy name, it should be the one who didn’t blindingly follow a genocidal maniac in his quest for power.”
Whatever else Astoria Greengrass was, Draco never got to hear, for at that moment, the door to his phone booth opened and someone knocked painfully into his knees.
“No,” he said, smoothing his hands over the duvet. “I somehow didn’t find the time while I was roaming the British countryside for a year.”
And now, Draco had his own phoenix, a man made of fire and second chances. If this is what melting was, well, Draco didn’t think it was all that bad.
“We’re going to 12 Grimmauld place,” he said, holding the jar of Floo Powder out to Draco. “I’ll meet you there.”
“Well, then there’s no point in me denying anything, is there?” Harry asked. He handed Draco a glass, and Draco noticed the glass was trembling as he took it. He frowned.
Harry wanders the castle without his invisibility cloak. He can't bear the sight of it. It doesn't matter; people have been avoiding him ever since the end of the war. There are rumors, rumors that his powers have increased ten-fold, and not necessarily for the better. Harry doesn't mind the rumors—they keep people away.
“You never struck me as a morning person,” Harry grumbled, pulling his cloak tighter around himself and clutching almost desperately to his coffee.
“It’s expensive, so you’re going to finish it,” Draco said and sat beside him. Harry held out his glass in a toast.
Lucius waited for the sound of the door closing before he went to stand beside his son. They stood together, neither one speaking, staring at the tapestry.
“As if you didn’t know,” he said, leaning against the counter beside Draco. “Or do you send all your letters in silver?”
Harry didn’t look at him, knowing he wouldn’t be able to handle the shame he knew he would see. "For a moment, I saw a way out. I could finally rest--it would all be over. I was so...relieved for that one moment," Harry whispered. "But I knew I had to finish it, because that’s what Dumbledore had said so many times.
“Yes,” said Harry. “I am aware. House Elves are strangely good at finding people.” He cleared his throat. “She said they were your favourite.”
Draco pulled Harry back by the arm. "What Dumbledore did to you was horrible and unfair and disgustingly manipulative, but that is not your fault," Draco said forcefully. "People aren’t calling you brave because Dumbledore told them to. They’re calling you brave because of what you did for us--"
Malfoy was sat at the base of the wall, with two mugs and a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. Harry closed the door behind himself and, with some difficulty, sat beside him on the floor.
“My mother figured you wouldn’t want to be portkeyed into a place that holds so many upsetting memories. The mind can do strange things, and she probably didn’t want to risk it,” Draco said.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t think so, and I’m getting less and less hopeful that I will. The healers don’t know what’s going on, but they’re able to help a bit with the pain.”
“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said. “My housemates have taken to hiding my belongings when they think I’m not looking.”
“We’ve already talked about it, Harry.” Hermione sighed. “I’m still very uncomfortable with the idea, but as you’ve already agreed…. You do know what you’re doing, don’t you? You’re going to be careful?”
Almost every surface was covered in fairy lights, and Draco was standing in the middle of the room, looking particularly pleased with himself.
Apparently, months on the run followed by a Killing Curse to the chest wasn’t without its consequences.
The hair thing is a little bit of a joke, but not really. I washed my hair last weekend and the whole process took like three hours between the washing, the deep conditioning, the combing, the rinsing out of the deep conditioner, and the application of the leave in conditioner. Apparently, I want my Black!Hermione to be as authentic as possible.
Harry stared down at the parchment in his hands. He wished he hadn’t written that last sentence about the Burrow. Hermione was going to worry even more, and she’d tell Ron, and Harry would have to fend off another round of questions about just what had happened between him and Ginny over the summer.
It started over his heart, and then, like forks of lightning, branched out to cover the skin of his chest, stopping just below his chin.
"I’m sure that’s unlikely, but I do thank you for your attempt at enthusiasm," McGonagall said dryly. She glanced at the clock and sighed. "We’d best head down. I feel our guests may become impatient if we wait too much longer."
By the time they’d arrived at the school, a few of Draco’s students had already arrived. Draco gave Harry a quick, nervous kiss and ran off to make sure everything backstage was going smoothly, leaving Harry to find his seat on his own.
“I don’t suppose you spend a lot of time on your knees,” Draco said. The other man blinked, then frowned slightly, and Draco covered his mouth in horror.
“What’s all this?” Draco asked, unwinding his scarf and draping it over the back of a chair, along with his coat.
“That’s not nearly as terrifying,” said Harry, releasing a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding. He picked up Teddy’s gift and finished wrapping it before setting it aside.
appeared before their eyes. He wiped his hands on his trousers and stood, groaning slightly as his knees popped.
“Harry Potter, if you finish that sentence, I will hex you and then lock you outside in the snow until the New Year,” Draco said sharply, throwing a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and stepping into the green flames. He held out his hand and forced a smile. “Shall we?”
“Someday, you will be able to Floo without nearly maiming yourself upon arrival,” Draco sighed, pulling Harry up and dusting the ash from Harry’s shoulders.
And that's it! Thank you so much for reading! I will (likely) be following this up with the New Year's Eve party, as it feels weird just leaving it. It should be up by New Year's Eve. I hope you've all had a wonderful Christmas!
Harry sighed and tapped the parchment with his wand. It’d been too hard to think about replacing Hedwig, so Harry was left with the task of coaxing one of the school owls down to help. After a few moments, a massive grey owl flew down from its perch, nearly cuffing Harry in the head with its wing as it landed on the window sill.
“That’s three questions, Malfoy.” Harry tapped his fingers on his knees as he thought of a question. “This isn’t fair. You had time to prepare something.”
The man in the image was scowling fiercely, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from saying, “He doesn’t look very pleasant.”
The four houses of Hogwarts have changed, for the Eighth Years. Only a few of them returned, so there was no need to separate them by house, even if there’s  too much tension between the four Gryffindors, Ernie Macmillan, and Draco for them to enjoy each other's company.
Narcissa Malfoy was wearing colours and a smile, two things Harry never thought he’d see her wearing. She pulled her son into a tight hug, murmuring something into his shoulder that made Draco laugh. Harry stood beside the door, watching the scene before him.
