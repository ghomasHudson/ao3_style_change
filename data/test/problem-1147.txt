(See the end of the chapter for
That night he was excused from dinner. Eating it, making it, and cleaning up after it. That was when Harry knew he had to get out, it only took him three more years and another near-death experience to actually do it.
Slowly Harry got up, and then he passed out. He woke up with a doctor huddled over him. “That’s quite a number you did on yourself boy, tripping into the mantle. You’ll be okay with a couple of days on the mend. Just stay in bed, and don’t let this happen again.”
Leaving the restaurant he went to search for Crabbe and Goyle. He had to walk so far. They were in about the center of the slums. Kicking the life out of a boy. He was dirty, clutching a rope wrapped around the neck of a goat, but Draco could see how cute he was. He walked up to his guards just as the boy fell. Crabbe and Goyle kept kicking and before Draco had reached them the boy was out cold.
“Okay, I’m going to go find someone to ask, are you okay in here by yourself for a minute?” Harry nodded. He forced a smile onto his face. It was a little bigger now, a little more genuine. He was starting to feel somewhat better. At least here his aunt and uncle couldn’t hurt him. At least here someone cared enough about him to offer him some food.
Dobby gave him a funny look but immediately barked at one of the many people scurrying around to make some tea and sandwiches for the prince.
I stepped in front of Harry and gestured to the guard to open the doors. When they swung open he took exactly twelve steps into the room and bowed to his father, seeing Harry doing the same behind him.
“You haven’t done anything, my dear, he just wants to meet you, now come on, we’ve got to go get ready to meet my bugger of a father, the king of Hogwarts.”
Draco bumped Harry’s shoulder with his own, “So, do you want to talk about it?” Harry shook his head a bit. “Okay then, how do you feel about tea?”
“That's just a test of what will happen to you if you're a faggot,” he said, spitting on Harry as he fell, face-first into the plush, velvet carpet covering the room. “I can’t believe you. So over-dramatic. Pick yourself up and go make dinner.”
Draco:
All the warmth faded out of Draco when he saw Harry. He was writhing back and forth, crying out for help. He looked so terrified and Draco felt so very helpless, so he did the only thing he could. He wrapped his arms around Harry.
How odd it must be, Harry thought, to be untouchable. To be safe from any beating or harm. No one would lay a hand on you.
“I feel the same way. But wait, throw me back out on the street, isn’t that where I’m going?”
“Sorry,” He mumbled, “You probably don’t want to touch me. I’m filthy and you are the prince. I don’t want to dirty your image by having you be seen shaking my hand.”
“Well, I was wondering if I could have some tea and sandwiches. Obviously, if you’re too busy don’t worry about it, but my friend is kind of upset and tea and sandwiches are what Mom always gave me and so I was just wondering if I could maybe have some,” Draco blurted out, suddenly nervous. Why was he nervous? He’d known Dobby all his life.
It was Harry’s 13th birthday, and because it was such he was allowed to ask Uncle Vernon one question (There was a strict “tight lip” policy around Harry). Harry had asked if he had had a godfather and if so what had happened to him. His Uncle had impatiently stated that of course, he had a godfather. Harry’s godfather, Sirius Black, had been hanged, along with his lover, Remus Lupin, for they were gay (a word Vernon spat out like it was poison).”Fucking Faggots had it coming. They made their choice and got what they deserved.” Harry then inquired what being gay meant and why it was so bad, and this is where it got ugly. “Being gay, or homosexual,” Vernon explained, “Meant that a man loves another man, or a woman loves another woman. It was a sin punishable by death, and usually, people would get burned at the stake or hanged to atone for it. Nothing like the pure, godly love that comes from a man and a woman. That's the only actual kind. The rest is just sinful and evil.”
As he ate he marveled at how poor the people in that area had been. He stuffed himself with all of his favorite foods until he could eat no more.
“I’m sorry, I know none of these will fit you perfectly, and we don’t have time to get a tailor up here to make sure they fit, but this is the best I can do right now. So just umm… like pick the one you like the best and yeah…”
Draco opened his closet and pulled several outfits he thought would fit the smaller boy. Although they were the same age Harry was several inches shorter than him and MUCH skinnier. Draco chided himself, that was a problem for another day. Right now he had to introduce this poor boy to his rather horrible father. If only his mother was still alive, if only she hadn’t ventured outside to help those people, she knew that it was freezing, but she had to be a good person. Draco wished he could be more like her.
A/N I hope y’all like this chapter.
Draco looked at the boy and felt his heart break for him. Whatever this beautiful boy had gone through had been terrible. So he just quietly lowered himself to sit beside Harry, leaning up against his bed. He took the tea and sandwiches off the cart and placed them in between their legs. He poured both Harry and him a cup of tea.
Pansy and Roger whirled round.  Pansy’s eyes rounded in wicked delight.  “Perfect, guests!” She trotted over to them and slung her arm through Draco’s, dragging him forward.  “Tell me, loves, how do you really feel about this piece?”
Harry laughed.  “Brilliant.”
“Do you do that often?”
“Ta, darling.” She said.
“It’s called a Nordic Track.” Davies announced with pride.  “This is a vintage piece of exercise equipment, very popular in America.  They’re brilliant.  It’s all the rage with muggles.  Isn’t it Harry?”
Now was as good as time as any, Harry supposed.  “Not only women.” he corrected.
Hermione let out a tired laugh.
Jacinda and Olivia sat in the middle of the curved booth, which put Harry and Malfoy at opposite ends, sitting across from each other.
Harry could see his old Auror Team crowded around a couple of tables shoved together in the corner. Ron, with his new partner, O’Dogherty. Moran, Shepherds, Peterson and others lifted their pints. Harry could hear their cheers muffled a bit by the glass. Ron flushed and hung his head while O’Dogherty slapped his back. Harry chewed his lip. He should be in there celebrating with them. He would be in a minute, but it felt off. Harry hadn’t actually helped bring in Rookwood with the rest of them. No, he’d been at the opening of the new DMLE wing at the Ministry thanking the public for their contributions. Standing beside Shacklebolt and pretending his grimace was passing for a smile. Harry caught his reflection in the dripping window and saw the same look on his face now. Shit. He tried for a brighter smile, with any luck, one that wouldn’t be mistaken for nausea, and pushed the door open.
“Yeah..” Dudley furtively looked around the pub and gave them another significant look. “You know.. Things.”
There was a polite knock on the door followed by Millie’s voice, “Hangover potion?”
“It’s alright, mate.” Ron clapped him on the back. “But I’m serious about the mind healer. You’ve got shit to work through.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy every few steps.  Malfoy seemed determined to ignore him.
Harry frowned, not sure if it was a compliment.
Draco waved him off.  “Do you think it’s true?”
“It was amicable.”
Blaise coughed something that sounded too close to “Potter” for Draco’s comfort. Draco glared at him.
“STILL HUNGRY?” George asked Victorie.
“For your hearing, Potter, honestly. Why are you following me?”
“I have seen you on your knees. I have seen you on a leash. I have seen you tied up against a wall. I have seen you gagged. I have seen you spanked and hit and whipped. I have seen you pleading for release.” He paused. “I have seen you in so many beautiful forms of submission, it makes my phantasies go rogue looking at you.”
“Yes what?”
“Don’t look so scandalized, Potter. Or, maybe do. It’s quite a sight.” Malfoy allowed himself a chuckle. “Me telling you I saw you also means I was there. My fourteen-year-old self might have found it amusing to drag this into the public. Now I find it much more amusing to tease you in private.”
This time, Harry could not only feel the heat rising to his head. He became as aware of his own body as of Malfoy’s, the decreasing space between them. The other had turned his torso towards him, arms open, legs crossed, back straight, one hand playing with the whiskey glass, the other resting on his thigh. It was a pose that shouted ‘enjoy the view’. And Harry did. As little as he wanted to, he simply did.
He was not good at dealing with media attention, he was even worse at seeing everybody around him finding stable relationships, settling into families, and he was worst at trying to establish such a relationship for himself. As his friends left the past behind, Harry felt more and more stuck with feelings and anxieties from the past. Seven years of living under a constant death threat to himself and everyone around him had left him with a deep anxiety to form meaningful relationships. And the ones he had formed estranged themselves from him as the other former Gryffindors returned to what they knew to be a normal life.
“Alright. You got it.”, she said and went off. This, she told herself, was at least an
Only now did Harry realize that he had held his eyes shut. For how long? He opened them, a tinge of guilt casting a shadow over his newly found relief because he had not done as he had been told, obviously.
Malfoy leaned towards him, the hand that he used to steady himself pressed flat on the bar right next to Harry’s arm. As he answered, in not much more than a whisper, his face moved past Harry’s cheek, next to his ear.
“Repeat the words.”
“Oh…” Malfoy stroked the insulted nipple with fake pity. Harry could see the grin on his face. “Did that hurt?”
joke or that this little bit of smut could cause such a response in a New York bartender. Maybe she had just moved to the city.
“Where
Looking at her, Harry could not prevent his gaze from shifting over to Malfoy who sat at his place unmoved by the emotional outburst in front of him. Maybe there was a hint of a smile on his face, but Harry’s vision was too weak to tell for sure.
“Any form of situation.”
The bartender turned away, nestled around for a second and set the glass in front of Harry.
“I take that as a: Tell him to fuck off?”, the bartender asked. She leaned forward, elbows on the bar, the cleavage between her breasts right in Harry’s view. Whether it was just coincidence or whether she was flirting with Harry he could not tell.
“It is quite remarkable how many different sensations the tip of a wand can produce.”, Malfoy mused while he let the said item wander across Harry’s ribs, his stomach, his hip bones. Harry’s eyes grew wider. He could see how Malfoy’s other hand stroked his own crotch as his wand approached Harry’s.
“Well, I like to take control of the situation.”
“I have always wondered why you never cared to cast a better transfiguration spell on you when you were out.”
Another blow, further down this time, not aimed at Harry’s ass but at the much more sensitive muscle below. Harry screamed and instinctively kicked his foot up at the site of impact.
Harry gave her a puzzled look.
Harry understood why Malfoy had positioned him in front of the mirror as soon as he saw his own reflection in the glass. The night sky transformed the window into a mirror that showed him his every movement as well as Malfoy’s. The blonde had removed his shirt as well and was stepping behind Harry with slow, deliberate motions.
The bartender blinked perplexed. “Ok. No turkey. You got it.”
Harry thought about it for a moment.
“Perhaps I’ll just drive you mad the other way.”, Malfoy growled.
“Just say the words, Harry.” Malfoy’s lips wandered up the side of his neck as he repeated himself. With a flick of his wrist, his wand lengthened to the size of a cane. Harry swallowed hard. He stared at the toy with a mix of fear and fascination. He did not want this game to end. As much as his ass hurts, because his ass hurt so much, he did not want Malfoy to stop. Every fiber of his body was alert, on fire. Arousal was rushing through his blood.
Malfoy snorted but touched glasses with Harry. “To fucking turkeys and flying pigs.”
“I gave you the choice.”, Malfoy said before the cane hissed through the air, coming down at Harry’s ass with an audible flick followed by Harry’s scream. He had automatically pressed his eyes shut but forced them open again, remembering Malfoy’s command. Harry knew he was close to giving in completely if he did not want to risk another act of disobedience. Pain and arousal had wiped most of his mind blank. Another blow with the cane and…
Before Harry had finished his surface inspection, he felt Malfoys hands on his shoulders. They pulled him out of his coat, turning him around to face his school day enemy. His coat dropped to the floor.
Harry opened his eyes halfway, gaze cast down on the floor in front of his feet. As he shook his head, Malfoy’s feet walked into his line of sight. He grabbed his chin with three fingers and forced him to look up into Malfoy’s face. The difference in height between them seemed to have grown by inches.
Harry gasped as Malfoy lay a flat hand on his cheek, caressing his lower lip for just one second. The sneaky glimmer in Malfoy’s eyes reminded him of whom he was dealing with. “In your dreams, Malfoy.” The last syllable had not left his throat when the hand that had just touched him so gently smacked him in the face.
“Scotch. Just a Scotch”, Harry replied.
“Not necessarily”, Harry answered. “Who is he?”
“You sound kind of hung over. I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving?”
The knot in Harry’s throat was of the kind that one cannot swallow. Malfoy had not given him an inch more space than he had when the blonde started his list. He could feel his breath on his cheek. With just a slight shift of balance, Harry could make their knees touch. It came as no surprise that Malfoy did not break that body contact.
“What can I get ‘ya?”
Harry turned around. Yes, he was in a state that was not compatible with being particularly eloquent. There was a mixture of fear and excitement brewing in his stomach. A combination that aroused him more than anything else.
have you seen me?” Harry asked, voice lowered.
Malfoy laughed. “Not yet. Not until you have learned your lesson.” His wand made a quick turn, ending up at the border between Harry’s ass and thighs. “I guess pants will not speed up that process.” And with one word, they were gone.
With one quick, determined motion, he pressed his hips against Harry’s ass and his hand against Harry’s erection. He was every bit as aroused as Harry, his cock pressed demanding against the trousers, its heat perceptible through two layers of fabric.
“Everything alright here?”, interrupted the bartender.
“Holy fucking shit.”
Malfoy slowly released his hand, letting Harry breathe for three seconds. His left hand wandered from Harry’s neck to his chest, drifted over each nipple, his flat stomach, down the marked line of black hair that surrounded his navel and then traveled further down. Harry bit his lower lip, watching every detail of the scene, following Malfoy’s hand with his eyes as he felt it on his skin.
The bartender dropped onto the floor behind the counter, joining his outburst with frantic giggles. She was still lying there when Harry regained control over his breath and inevitably looked at Malfoy who was, now Harry was sure, smiling at him.
“He”, she giggled. “He says… hew, man, you guys are good… he says that he
“You have no idea.”, Harry answered in a low voice. “Just get me my check.”
“Open your eyes, Potter. Look at what has become of you.”
There was an uncomfortable silence between them, thinned out by the background music that kept the conversations in the bar private and loners like them entertained. Harry took the seat next to Malfoy. He rose his glass and held it out for Malfoy to click glasses with him.
As soon as the words had left his mouth, Malfoy’s grip around his hips softened. The hand that had just hit him settled gently around the curvature of his butt cheek.
“Say it.” Malfoy whispered into his ear between two smacks. “Say ‘I am sorry,
“Well then, to two obviously wonderful Thanksgivings.”
“Ah, Potter. Three years in New York and two of them in Brooklyn. If my head wasn’t a mess, I would not have survived. And probably also not if two glasses of firewhiskey would already make me drunk.”
“Hm. Still not quite convinced, are we?”
“Here’s the deal, Potter.”, Malfoy looked at him steadily. There was no sweet whispering anymore. His tone was harsh and clear. “I will be back in a few minutes. If you want to play, stay right where you are. If you don’t, leave before I come back. It’s your decision.”
“Sure.”
“Hello?”, he croaked.
“Don’t give me that I-am-so-surprised-and-completely-innocent look, Potter. It’s cute but so misleading.”
After about a minute, the bartender had regained her constitution and walked back to Harry on stiff legs.
“The guy with the bleached hair at the other end. Rich kid, I’d say. So no waste in just takin’ the drink ‘n run.”
– my god, who says
“What was that?”
Harry did not know what a normal life meant. The way everybody treated him at home did not help him to learn it. He had lived and survived 17 years as the-boy-who-lives, never truly in touch with the person Harry Potter, and he felt himself growing into the-man-who-defeated-the-Dark-Lord, still not Harry Potter.
“So, I guess one on the house is one for me”, she added cheerfully, clinking her glass with Harry’s. “Cheers.”
“Tell him he could have only made it worse by dangling a fucking turkey in front of my nose.”
“Yes, Sir.”, Harry responded and at that moment, every fiber in his body meant it.
“Ouch.”, the bartender commented, playfully biting her index finger. She picked up a bottle from the shelf behind her and refilled Harry’s glass before she got on her way back to Malfoy with a cheerful “We don’t want this conversation to run dry too soon.”
“Love letter for ‘ya.”, the bartender announced, handing Harry a folded piece of parchment. “Seems like your
The blonde ran his wand across Harry’s spine. First, it felt like ordinary wood. Then the touch intensified, sharpened, like the tip of a knife pressing into Harry’s back muscles. With a playful swing, Malfoy brought his wand to Harry’s chest, letting the same invisible blade run across each of his nipples before he pressed it firmly to the base of the left one. Harry gasped in as the sharp pain shot through his chest, into the tips of his fingers and through a bunch of unidentifiable nerves.
“Good boy.”
The bartender brought a fresh glass. “I would have made it on the house, but the other Thanksgiving hater over there has gotten in the way of that. He congratulates you on, I quote,” and her voice shifted to an awful, Americanized British accent. “not falling for the dumbest holiday in the history of humankind.”
“Tell him he will see pigs flying around fucking turkeys before there will be an evening where
Suddenly, Malfoy backed away.
“What have you seen, Malfoy. Tell me.”
“Very good.” Malfoy let his lips brush Harry’s for the first time. The promise of more made both shiver. “Now lose your shirt, shoes, and socks. Then stand facing the big window over there.”
“Raw feelings?”, Malfoy remarked.
“Uh. Ok. Thanks for letting me know.”
“I wonder if I can get you to call me Sir quite yet…” mumbled Malfoy as he let go of Harry’s chin. “What do you think, would that be fun, Potter?”
“Just making this a better Thanksgiving for both of us. I already saw pigs flying around fucking turkeys.”
“Where the carpet is grateful for a pair of very high and very thin heels.”, Malfoy replied with a wink.
“That was quite a hard lesson to learn, wasn’t it.”
Harry pressed his lips together. He might be manacled, wandless, half-naked and at Malfoy’s mercy, but he was not yet at the point of mindless submission. With all bravery left in his clouded mind, he looked straight into the blue eyes that appeared darker and deeper with widened pupils. Which created a devious smile on Malfoy’s lips. He licked them as he moved to Harry’s side.
Harry had not noticed their bartender’s presence until she commented: “Oh… is this turning into some kind of sexy drinking game?”
Harry could have sworn that Malfoy bewitched him at that moment to create eye contact again. The undertone had made it very clear that Malfoy would not let the direction of this conversation stir in any other direction than the one he kept alluding to anymore. The blue-gray eyes rested firmly on Harry’s face, wandering between eyes and lips. The firm determination that was so typical for the Slytherin had taken on a slightly different, darker shade.
“I said that I cannot quite have you speechless yet, Potter. If I ask you a question, I want to hear a clear ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Understood?”
Harry burst into laughter before he managed to answer: “Oh, it’s all good. I think fucking turkeys are not so bad after all.”
It had been a tough decision to leave everybody behind after the war had ended. Until it did, Harry had never doubted that he would stay in England, with his friend and second family. That he would become an Auror and a normal part of the British wizard world. But it had soon become clear that this was a naïve conception of the future of the-boy-who-lived-and-defeated-the-Dark-Lord.
“Ha!” Harry could not help but be amused. “Because you
“Yes.” Harry’s breathing had quickened. He was aroused because he had felt this outright male body against his own, had felt its arousal because he was afraid what Malfoy would do to punish him for failing to follow his orders.
Harry nodded. Malfoy grabbed his chin firmly, firm enough to force Harry’s mouth open.
had been the one assuring Adam that he did not want the stereotypical in love-engaged-married kind of relationship and not give that impression to anyone.
“No. You?”, Malfoy replied without losing his smile.
Harry bit his lower lip harder than before as he shook his head.
Harry growled in response. His over-sensitized nipple ached but that only made Malfoy’s touch more intense. He wanted that sensation to intensify, he wanted it to spread. His cock twitched at the expectation of feeling Malfoy’s hands all over his body.
“Speechless, Potter?”, Malfoy asked. “I cannot have that quite yet.”
The ringing of his phone woke Harry up the next morning. Despite all means of wizard communication, he still found this Muggle device to be the most useful tool to stay in touch. He accepted the call without registering who was calling.
Harry resumed his task for the evening: silently staring at his glass. Only to be startled by a violent burst of laughter from the other side of the bar. The bartender who let it out was holding her stomach with one hand, gripping the edge of the bar for balance as she bent over with what looked like severe giggles.
“Keep your fucking turkey.”, Harry blurted out. “What is it with you Americans and that stupid, obese bird?”
Malfoy looked at him with more self-assuredness than ever. Whatever his plan had been, it seemed to have worked out so far. It made Harry uneasy but at the same time curious. He wondered just about how much Malfoy had seen, how much he knew. How well the other had picked his words to touch upon a part in Harry that he kept secret from the public for good reasons.
“No better option for an English-speaking wizard who does not want to deal with all the post-war drama on the island, especially if he’s gay. You should know that better than anyone else, Potter.”
Malfoy ducked, but it still hit his shoulder. He instantly decided to take revenge for this and threw the snowball he was holding. As he did this, he set his foot back to get some more grip on the ice, but this resulted in an ominous cracking sound. He ignored it though, it had been able to bear him until now, which meant it should be able to do that for a while longer. He wasn't that heavy anyway, right?
Honestly, he was turning into Granger. He let out a slightly irritated sigh and leaned back in his chair.
"I've tried with Pansy in sixth year," he said. "Mostly to create an image you know, but it soon became pretty clear that it didn't work at all. I don't think she even fancies guys, she's never let them close." He kept his eyes shut as he spoke, keeping his voice low. Loud sounds would absolutely shatter the calm air around them.
Instead, he lightly nibbled on the flesh he had kissed, making his way towards the front, just below the other's Adam's apple.
Not sure what had gotten into him, he already started to list down things in his head. A bag of candy? Nah, Draco didn't seem like the guy to accept work for sweets. Maybe a muggle pen? It lasted longer than the ink of their feathers. But then again, he knew about the 'that is what she said' thing… There was no harm in trying though. He searched through his stuff in hope of finding one, looking almost victorious when he found one "What about this?"
Was Potter a morning person? Maybe he was, Draco couldn't know that.
"You'll do well, if anyone's fit to be an Auror, it's you, Potter," he assured him. As much as he'd irritated Draco throughout the years, Harry had shown a great deal of talent for defense against the dark arts. Not only that but if Draco would have been able to get over himself, he would've admitted that Potter was someone to look up to. A born leader and fighter, highly suitable to become an Auror or something of the sort. His abilities were something to be jealous of, Draco couldn't deny that.
Once Harry had left his father grabbed him by the hair and shoved Draco to the ground. Draco’s head slammed into the thin carpet covering the solid stone floor. He felt warm all over.
Lucius whirled around and smacked Draco on the back of the head, “Boy, did I ask that question to you, no. I addressed the man you are trusting as your companion. Now trust that he has the good sense to answer my question. And now stand up boy. Both of you. Look me in the eyes while we talk. So, Harry Potter, why should you be the companion to the crown prince of Hogwarts?”
"Sure mate," Harry ran back to his tent. He grabbed two old blankets he had. They were both dirty and full of holes, but they got the job done. Harry had taken them from a stall at the traveling fair.
“And sandwiches! What are these?”
Harry:
Draco shrugged, “Lucky guess.”
A/N Here is chapter three. It is from Harry’s perspective. This is in the carriage when he wakes up. Sorry for the wait. I have a terrible case of writer's block so this chapter is really short. I am working on a longer chapter right now.
He walked back to the wealthier part of town. He stopped by one of his favorite restaurants. Le Peep. The owners opened a private room for him, and he sat. He told his personal guards, Crabbe and Goyle, to leave him and search for riff-raff.
Harry jolted awake. He was moving. His head felt like it was splitting in two. Maybe he was going to the hospital. No, they couldn’t do that to him. He was only 16, and the kingdom of Hogwarts had strict laws about minors. They would wait for him to wake up and then force him to call his aunt and uncle. He would have to go back to the abuse that he had just successfully escaped.
Harry looked up at him, obviously having been pulled out of his own thoughts. “Oh, sorry. It’s-It’s just that I’m filthy and I feel like I’m getting your expensive things all gross so if I sit on the floor then my mess will be easier to clean up.”
Harry often had nightmares. They all started with the all-consuming darkness. And then the voices came. “You’re a waste of space, Harry.” “Your parents died for you?” “You can’t do anything right.” Then there came the beatings. Sometimes they were creative, like smacking him repeatedly with a picture frame so he ended up with bits of glass embedded in his arm, or scalp, or wherever. Once he was locked in a bare metal cage, usually reserved for animals, and poked. He could still see their fat, ugly faces leering at him through the bars. “Come on, open the door, Harry.” “A boy as important as you can only be let out on special occasions.’ Mostly though it was the beatings. Fists raining down on him. First the beating was easy to endure, a punch to the nose drawing blood and breaking his glasses. Then they got worse. A blow to the ribs, bruising them badly. A snap of the wrist, or at least a few fingers. He remembered one particularly bloody dream, he had made the tea incorrectly, so his uncle had poured it all over him. Harry still had the scars, a pink puckering on his chest and forearms.
Harry wakes up from his nightmare. Harry and Draco drink tea and begin to get to know one another.
Just as he rounded the corner he saw his two sort-of friends, Dean and Seamus Finnegan-Thomas leading a baby goat (were those called kids) they'd clearly stolen. Dean glanced at Harry.
“Clear as a crystal, my lord.”
Harry smiled back and took the lead. Well, one more mouth to feed, but also at least now he had a friend. Looking at the goat he thought of Seamus and Dean. They had gotten married at 18 (illegally of course), fresh out of school, and both had been disowned for being gay. Too many people who lived in the areas had similar stories.
“Twinky, why are you here? I specifically asked not to be disturbed. I have a guest over and we’re having tea. There better be a good reason for this disturbance.” Twinky gulped, she was a young servant, her father had sold her to the castle to pay off debts.
Draco shrugged, “Lucky guess.”
Draco walked quickly back into his closet. He pulled out an outfit he knew would match and quickly walked out of the room. He ran into the bathroom and stared into the mirror. What was wrong with him? Why did this boy make his heart start to race? Oh, what would his father say. Nothing his father would say absolutely nothing because he was going to do nothing and say nothing. This was nothing and nothing it would remain.
“I shall do it immediately sir. Thank you.” Twinky bowed and left. Draco whirled around to see Harry with a look of immense fear upon his face.
Harry turned towards the door. Draco walked in pushing a tea cart, he saw Harry and frowned. Oh no, did I do something wrong? Am I supposed to stand up every time I see him? Do I bow… What did I do?!
He started up the stairs with Harry leaning on him with all of his weight. He knew that this was the prince and he shouldn't be doing this, but he was really just putting all his effort into not passing out again.
Harry picked up one of the suits. It was a black suit with a red shirt. He liked red. It was his favorite color. But Uncle didn’t like him to have opinions so he’d kept that to himself. Harry stripped off his clothes quickly. He changed into the suit. He’d never buttoned anything up on himself, though and with the bruises he couldn’t do it well. He got the bottom two but he got confused with the holes. He walked out to the bathroom door.
“Harry Potter, my lord.”
“I am so sorry,” He babbled, flustered, “I must have dozed off.”
Hello, my lovely people! Here is another chapter! It starts in Harry’s perspective when Draco leaves to go to the kitchen and then it goes from there. 😁As always comments are appreciated. And I know that this is a fanfiction, but ya girl has to set up some characters and conflicts before they can get together, but buy your tickets, the gay train is coming soon and you don’t want to miss it.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!!
Both boys broke into grins then, the sadness not forgotten, just pushed back a bit, replaced with the bubble of this new friendship, but that’s the thing about bubbles. Eventually, they have to pop.
Harry kept walking until he bumped into Ms.Trelawney. She was batty. Always going on about death and life. Everyone in the neighborhood took care of her. She was an addict and needed a lot of help. She smiled when she saw him.
“I know it’s not a friend,” she said suddenly.
And with that Draco started walking towards the door. “Alright, one wanker coming right up.” He opened it and ushered Harry out. Harry hadn’t really gotten to see much of the castle when he was coming in, being unconscious at the time, so he marveled at the majesty of it. Too soon though, the reached the audience chambers.
He bypassed her work station and went over to the cook. Dobbert had been the head chef at the palace for longer than Draco had been alive. He felt like a cool uncle to Draco, even going so far as to let Draco call him Dobby.
Comments and Kudos are always appreciated, as they are what the gay train runs on. But if you seem to have a lack, no worries :)
“My son, back so soon from your little expedition?”
If Harry noticed Draco’s shoddy attempt at switching the topic he didn’t mention it, simply nodding. Draco turned down a small side hallway and opened the door. He still felt a little woozy but he needed fresh air. Harry followed him out and smiled too. They had met with his father, and better yet, they had survived.

Note: There is abuse (beatings, mental abuse, etc.) represented in this chapter, as well discussed murder, and blatant homophobia. Please just skip this chapter if you will get triggered by any of this. I made this chapter to give a bit of Harry’s backstory, but you won’t be confused if you don’t read this.
“Father, as you must know by now, that my expedition took a surprising turn. I have brought back a peasant who desperately needs our help.”
“Hey, are you alright? You look a little roughed up? What did your father do, what did he say?”
“Hey, it’s okay. It was just a dream. You’re in the royal palace, You’re sleeping in my bed because you got hurt. It’s okay, the dream can’t hurt you. I’m here,” Draco whispered in the smaller boy’s ear. Hugging him tighter, only then did he feel how skinny Harry was. He was practically skin and bones. We’ll have to deal with that sooner or later, Draco thought.
Harry smiled, cursing his blushing cheeks, “Of course, Draco.” Oh god, he hoped the prince would chock it all up to injuries. No, it was his injuries, he liked women and women only.
Harry sat on the floor and attempted to compose himself for what felt like hours. Eventually, he heard voices outside the door. It sounded like they were arguing. Was he causing trouble? He didn’t want to be a burden. If he was an issue he could just leave.
Draco came out of the bathroom in an elegant silver and green suit, his tie around his neck but not yet tied. He seemed a lot less flushed, but the colour came back to his face when he saw Harry.
“Well…” Draco seemed nervous, “If you’ll have me, I’ve been looking for a companion for some time now and I thought that maybe you could be mine, sort of the Patroclus to my Achilles if you know what I mean.”
Harry buried his face in Draco’s shoulder, his breathing ragged. “How can you know everything will be okay? You don’t even really know me.”
Harry thought those sounded absolutely vile, but he was starving and he wanted to be polite so he took one. “Hmm, I’ve never had those before,” He took a bite and it wasn’t as bad as Harry thought it was going to be. Not his favorite but it was better then what he’d been eating for the past months, “Never mind, these are really good. I think I just found my new favorite food!”
Harry then made one of the stupidest decisions of his life. He said “ That doesn't sound punishable by death bad. I mean it’s only love. The gays aren’t hurting anyone, are they? Aren’t they just loving?”
“Chamomile,” Harry said with a small smile, “It’s my favorite, how’d you know?”
Draco deposited Harry onto his huge bed. Harry was laying on top of Draco’s silk sheets. Harry felt bad about getting dirt on them, but he could only hold back the darkness for so long and he quickly passed out. Into the world of dreams and recollections, he went.
“No,” Draco replied, reminding himself to keep his voice calm and steady, “But I know a thing or two about nightmares, and it always helps me to be reminded that it can’t get to me here. And you’re right, I don’t know you that well, but I know that you’re kind and smart and very funny and that you definitely don’t deserve whatever happened to you that causes you to have nightmares like this.”
Soon after they were on their way to the palace. Draco touched the boy’s neck. It was dirty and left stains on his skin, but it was pulsing with the beat of the boy’s heart. His head lolled onto Draco's shoulder, but Draco didn't mind. Up close he could see how cute the boy really was. Draco smiled for the first time in a while.
“Yes….. ummm…. just pick out one of the outfits. Whichever one strikes your fancy.”
Harry looked almost ready to leave, damn his injuries he looked ready to run as far and as fast as he could. Draco offered the boy his hand and when Harry grasped it he helped haul him up.
There was a sudden knock on the door. Startling both boys out of their thoughts. Draco cleared his throat and stood up. Straightening his clothes and brushing crumbs off of himself Draco walked to the door.
I think it's pretty apparent how much my style has changed. Please feel free to comment or let me know if you have any ideas or things you want me to include in the story. I'm still trying to get back into the swing of things again so I'm not going to have a set upload schedule, at least for a bit.
All he needed to do was to well actually talk to the prince. Harry pushed back his tarp and walked out into the crisp morning air. He needed to hurry so he took the fastest route. He walked through the cardboard village. Harry was poor, but these people had nothing. Here people can't even afford tents, much less food. Most of them had children who liked to play in the dump and sewage waste that they lived near. Many days there was no clean water, and others the only tap in the village of 300 was turned on for a few minutes. And still, the government just didn't do anything. Poverty had changed the lives of too many people here and walking through this area made Harry angry.
"You know Crabe," Goyal said, "It looks an awful lot like the one that merchant down the street was telling us that he lost. So let's help our pal out and return his goat for him."
Draco took one and bit into it, “I think that it’s cheese and pickle.”
Harry thanked her and continued on his way. Lost in thought, he wasn't paying attention until it was too late. The palace goons Crabbe and Goyle blocked his path.
“Don’t you ever disrespect me like that again, speaking out of turn is forbidden. Do that again and the consequences will be dire. Dismissed, get out of my sight.”
Hi, cuties! I promise you the gay is coming. Give me another couple of chapters, but we’re on our way. Also, as always let me know what you think and/or what you want out of this fic. Because I’m pushing for a happier ending, but if y’all want angst then I’ll attempt to rip your hearts out. Just let me know :)
Also, I just feel like this has to be said, Fuck JKR and her TERF bullshit. Trans women are women and trans men are men. There isn't any room for debate. She is no longer the author of the Harry Potter series. It just magically appeared one day (or it was written by an absolutely iconic ally: Danny Devito, whichever one you like better). This is a story about love and she spews hate over something she will never experience.
Then he started in on the kicking. Harry felt his rib crack and cried out. This only made Uncle Vernon more savage, and more willing to inflict harm upon Harry. He stomped on Harry’s face and Harry felt his nose crumble under the onslaught of abuse. He curled into a ball on the floor and attempted to protect his vital organs until Uncle Vernon forced him to stand and slammed him into the fireplace. Harry knew he was screwed then. When he felt the back of his head and his hand came away covered in his blood. Harry had broken the vase that was placed on the mantelpiece and as he fell he yelped, feeling the sharp pottery shards dig into his palms and knees. Everything hurt. His chest felt like it was filling up with fire, making it more and more difficult to breathe. Harry’s head was spinning, whether from the blow or the lack of oxygen he didn’t know, but he knew it was bad. He got up, fighting for consciousness when Vernon Dursley picked up an extremely sharp shard of pottery. He studied it for a minute, turning it over in his hands before he lunged forward and sliced Harry’s arm wide open.
Why is he staring at me like that? More importantly, why am I staring back? What’s happening. He couldn’t possibly be like you. No, he’s probably just thinking, maybe you have something on your face. Yes, that’s probably it. There’s no way he’d fancy you too! He’s just here because he was hurt and you needed to take care of him because he’s your citizen. Soon enough you’ll be king and they’ll all be your subjects. Yes, that’s it. He’s not still here because you want to lose yourself in those emerald green eyes. Oh, definitely not.
He hastened his pace as he walked back to the boys. The sun was coming up and if he wanted to eat then he needed to hurry.
Draco left Harry, his rather cute new guest, to sleep in his bed, and he tried to slip out inconspicuously. That failed. His father, the King, Lucius Malfoy, spotted him and called him over.
“Well your highness, I do not see myself as worthy of the position, I was simply a peasant boy just a bit ago, but I trust Dra- um, Prince Malfoy’s decision, if he thinks this is for the best then perhaps it is such.”
To this Uncle Vernon had simply responded “No,” and fell on Harry. First, he just struck him. “Gay is bad. It is an illness. Do you support people who go against God’s word? Did I raise you, giving everything you need, putting in my own blood, sweat, and tears into your well being, to bring up a supporter of sin? Or maybe a sinner himself.”
And then he realized what those dreams meant. “Oh shit, I have a crush on the peasant, Harry Potter.”
Even though it had been 3 months the nightmares still plagued him. When he was 13 he got one of the worst beatings for asking about his godfather. That was what he dreamed about tonight. Reliving every bloody and painful moment.
“Hey, why are you all the way down there, the bed’s nice and comfy, and it has plenty of space”
Draco hated getting up early. He usually only woke up around noon when the butler, Dumbledore, brought him breakfast and drew the curtains. Today he had to wake up at 7:00. How horrible! He walked to the washbasin and splashed himself with water. He took a little black cylinder off the shelf next to his mirror. He opened it and smoothed his hair back with the gel.
Draco took one and bit into it, “I think that it’s cheese and pickle.”
Harry felt a sudden rush of surprise. Was this the royal carriage?! He sat up and pushed the blonde hair out of the other boy's face. It was the immaculate face of the crown prince. Wait, he was riding in the royal carriage and the prince, Draco Malfoy, the source of his secret long-standing crush, was next to him. No, not crush. That was wrong, remember what Uncle had told him. This had to be a dream. Maybe, when he had gotten beaten up his brain had decided to give him some pleasant alternative universe to live in. If that was the case, then Harry wanted to be a wizard and go to a school and have a happy and loving family who wasn't dead. Well if this was his alternate reality then he couldn’t feel any pain. He smacked his hand on the metal armrest that was next to him.
Draco left and Harry could tell he was trying to walk softly. He was grateful Draco was being so thoughtful, even though he knew he didn’t deserve it.
“Sorry, sir.”
“Tea sounds good.” Harry’s voice was raspy and sounded forced, but Draco didn’t push it. He understood not wanting to discuss hard things.
Ms.Trelawney smiled as the little kid nuzzled her hand and started to chew on her dress. "Well, she has the spirit of a fighter. You should call her Hedwig."
When Draco woke up he was happy, but also very sad. He could never do that with Harry because he would be ridiculed and laughed at. Harry would probably take the ax to Draco's head himself.
Draco had always hated the way his father treated his royal subjects. He acted as though all of them were replaceable, and that they should be thankful that he is their king, not him being grateful for the people who worshipped him like a God. He had to think fast so His Majesty, The King, would allow Harry to stay.
“I can take him, I am perfectly capable of carrying him. Put his goat out in the royal menagerie. I will take Mr. Potter to my quarters while we set up a wing for him. Please setup the Gryffindor tower for him. Also, notify the kitchens to set an extra place at my private dining room.”
Harry is dreaming and the nightmare he has struck a chord.
Harry didn’t want to take too much. He didn’t want to be a burden. So instead of answering he just grabbed his cup. It was warm and felt good against his bruised fingers. He knew that smell! The nice old man, Mr. Flitwick, who owned the tea shop in town had given him a free cup one frigid day. Harry had been walking down Main Street when Mr. Flitwick had spotted him and insisted he take a cup.
Draco:
“Very well, you may leave, Draco remain for a moment.” With this Harry gave Draco a furtive glance, but Draco just waved his hand and smiled what he hoped was reassuringly.
Harry slowly leaned over closer to the bed. He looked a little less scared now, which made Draco feel better. Draco suddenly realized that he was still holding Harry’s hand. Harry seemed to realize it at the same time. Draco quickly let go, blushing something awful.
“Nothing, don’t worry about it, Hey since we’re so close to the side door do you maybe want to run to the stables with me for a second? We can visit your goat and maybe just go on a horseback ride through the forest, just to get out of the goddamned castle for a minute?”
“Very well, boy,” Draco’s father spat, “you will be allowed to remain, on a trial basis, one wrong move and you will not only be put back onto the streets, but you will be executed. Your blood will spatter the very streets upon which you once resided. Do I make myself understood?”
Then they heard the gates open and the trumpets heralding the prince’s return.
Draco frowned a little deeper at this but just grabbed two cups and some sandwiches from the cart. He sat down beside Harry and poured him a cup.
Note from another day: Hey Lovely People! I hope you all are doing well. So I wanted to ask y’all’s opinion on something. How would you feel if I rewrote the first few chapters of this story? I’m just going to come out and say it, they’re pretty bad. I was fixing the spelling and grammar errors in them (and I changed a tiny bit of the story because it was just that god awful) and I really realized how terrible they truly are (especially compared to the mediocrity I know they can be). So I would keep similar story beats, just like flesh out things that happen and characters. This would definitely make them longer as well because I would add stuff so that the relationship feels like it has a proper build-up and everything. Let me know if that’s something that y’all would enjoy seeing from me because I’ll do it, I just need to know y’all’s feelings. But I did fix the grammar and spelling in there because I just couldn't leave it the way it was. So let me know your feelings on that, or just let me know something you enjoyed or hated. <3
“Oh, of course. Let me just...” and he reached down and fixed the buttons Harry had put into the wrong holes and buttoned Harry’s shirt up the rest of the way. Harry blushed when the taller boy’s fingers brushed against his skin. Draco also pulled a tie out of the picket of Harry’s jacket and tied it around Harry’s neck. He smiled at him
Harry jolted awake. His body was wracked with the force of built-up sobs. He was alone, he was worthless. Everything they said about him was true. Gosh, what a disappointment he must be to his parents. He was just happy that they couldn’t see him now. He glanced down at his scars, and the tears just flowed out of him.
Suddenly, both Crabbe and Goyal descended on Harry, ripping Hedwig out of his arms and pummeling him. The last thing Harry saw before he blacked out was a pair of well-manicured boots and a flash of blonde hair.
“Um.. excuse me, Draco? I’m really sorry but I can’t button this shirt up. I don’t want to go in front of his highness.. Umm your father.”
Harry absentmindedly rubbed a scar on his ribs. That one had come from a particularly violent beating. He had sliced the carrots lengthwise instead of crosswise. His uncle had fallen on him. Harry’s ribs had been broken and Uncle Vernon had thrown the carrot platter at him, where it had shattered, cutting him.
A few hours later the chariot had pulled into the city. Draco’s father had forced him to come down to “help the citizens,” as a punishment for messing with the stable boys instead of studying. He wasn’t allowed to do anything fun. He wasn’t ever happy. Luckily, all he had to do was show up and the people would be happy.
kuodos and likes.... if you have any to spare :)
“Harry, you clean up nice. Let me tie my tie real quick.” Draco quickly tied his tie and buttoned the front of his blazer. “Okay, so my father is very specific about traditions. You have to stand behind me and when we enter we both have to bow until he allows us up. He loves to lord his power over everyone because he’s an absolute bloody wanker so it may be a second before we’re allowed to stand. Also when we’re in there only address him as my lord, your highness, or King Malfoy. He makes snap judgements of people and if he doesn’t like you you’ll have to go back out onto the streets and I don’t want that. I’d be such a hassle to come see you.”
“It’s not important,” he drawled.
“They’ve released the snitch, Potter.  Where has your Gollum like dedication to quidditch gone?  Surely Krum’s last professional match is a more riveting topic than the colour of my hair.”
Malfoy opened and closed his mouth several times.
Harry indicated the kitchen with his head, “Ginny’s just arrived.”
The dinner party would be fine.
“Harry, there are drawings. You made drawings to accompany each memory.” Hermione said gently.
Harry sent Kreacher to Hogwarts. He couldn't figure out another place. It wasn’t fair for Kreacher to stay on at Grimmauld Place, taking care of only Harry. Plus, he wouldn’t be lonely at Hogwarts, with the other house-elves there. It had nothing to do with Harry’s aversion to being constantly scrutinised.
Harry shoved his glasses up and pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes.
Harry volunteered for kitchen duty. Mrs Weasley tried to take the plates out of his hands, but he ducked around her.
“It didn’t go well.”
Next he added a blue and green swirled cocktail beside which he had “Debbie Downer: calm down and mellow out.”
Harry’s stomach was fully in knots. Ginny took a nervous breath, glanced at Neville and with tears in her eyes, announced, “We’re getting married!” She stuck out her right hand to show off a beautiful ruby engagement ring.
Ron shook his head, still grinning. “I can’t believe you gave Harry homework. He’s only just quit his job.”
Harry found himself walking beside Draco Malfoy through Diagon Alley yet again.  It wasn’t what he’d set out to do that day but there they were. Harry had just left Ron and Hermione at a cafe with some other Ministry workers when he’d come across Draco leaving Gringotts.
Of course he knew them personally.  Potter had probably told them loads of humiliating stories about Draco and they all had a good laugh at his expense.  Naturally. Draco noticed the way their eyes wouldn’t meet his, the slight curl of the lip when he passed. He threw back his shoulders and put on the most contemptuous look he could summon to precede Potter into the private car.  Draco ignored the set of seats with shackles built into them. He strode to the back of the car where there were bench seats and sat by the window. Potter did some checks along the perimeter and spoke briefly with the other Aurors.
“Do you know who that was?” he heard the man yell at the bartender. Harry felt his false smile start to fade and attempted to paste it back on his face before he sat down.
“Nothing. Merely enjoying the beginnings of your mating ritual.” Draco replied, looking down his nose.
Harry’s mouth went dry.  “What are you doing?”
“Harry?”  Draco asked, his voice soft.  Harry nodded absently.
“Fine.”  Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously.  “How is yours?”
“Draco? Are you home, love?”
“Potter this isn’t about me.  This is about your inability to regulate yourself.”
Harry blinked at her and smiled back.  He sank into the seat beside Malfoy and stretched his legs out.
Harry laughed aloud.  “Were you really? Must have escaped my attention.”
He wove his way through the throng of blathered patrons up to the bar and queued for a pint. In twenty minutes, no fewer than five men came up to him, offering to buy him a drink. One man in a mesh top came right out and asked to take Harry home. It only added to the restless energy dancing in his veins. He sat at the side of the bar where he could watch the ebb and flow of the muggles to the entrance.
Harry and Ron grinned at each other. Hermione passed Rosie over to Ron, who bounced her on his knee. She made delighted gurgling noises at him and tried to eat Ron’s wedding ring. Hermione disappeared down the hall. She returned a moment later with a roll of parchment.
“Oh, sod off you crazy old bint.” Harry yanked the curtains closed. “Kreacher?” Harry shouted. “Why did you let the old bat out again?”
Harry’s cheeks flushed.  His eyes darted around to the other patrons.  They were now drawing the attention of everyone in the pub.  Harry made sure his hands were clearly visible on the table top and his feet planted on the floor.  Watching Malfoy hitting the table repeatedly with his fists, throwing his head back moaning his name was a car crash Harry couldn't look away from.  One that made his toes curl and his mouth dry.
“Think it will last?” Draco asked with a sly smile.
“Yours? Are congratulations in order?”
He looked down his nose at her, “Of course not.”
“I can’t do this again. Just let it go.” Ron’s mouth pressed into a thin line.
“WELCOME!  WELCOME TO THE FINAL PERFORMANCE OF BULGARIA’S OWN VIKTOR KRUM.  HERE IN THE TOP BOX WITH US TONIGHT IS KRUM’S FAMILY. ”
Pansy rolled her eyes.  “Of course you think that.  You’d wear clothes out of the bin if Draco would let you.”
“Oh? You watch Bake Off, yeah?” Olivia said excitedly. “Be honest, how badly do you miss Mary Berry?”
“Daft” Olivia whispered. Then as an afterthought, “Pretty though.”
“So what’s it called?  The Twitchy Ferret?”
“Want to see the brewing station?”
Draco ignored the barely hushed voices and made his way to the counter of Slug & Jiggers. He set the bundle of porcupine quills and the jar of dragon liver down. The shopkeeper put them on the scales to weigh them out. His eyes strayed to Draco’s wrist, where his robes had ridden up a bit. Draco hastily tugged the sleeve back down.
“I thought that was you.” he said.
“We’re not trying to be.” Blaise replied patiently.
The crowd erupted in cheers, the loudest coming from the group surrounding Draco.  The screen showed those in the Top Box and Draco began to panic. He slid down in his seat as the picture of the Top Box zoomed in closer and much to Draco’s dismay the black shaggy head in front of him was not a Bulgarian, but in fact Harry Sodding Potter.  Because of course it was.
“Something substantial.” Harry said.
“No more dementoids?” he asked in a hushed voice. “They were well bad.”
Harry looked down at his clothes as if they would provide some sort of answer.
“It gets worse.”
“He went to Beauxbatons didn’t he?”
“Draco?” Blaise called out. “Where are you?”
Hermione and Harry both turned to the NotPassedOut Ron Weasley, who shrugged. “He ws misr… misrble.”
“No!”
Harry indicated an empty table for Malfoy to sit at. The car was about three quarters full.  Harry grabbed them sandwiches and a couple of butterbeers and sat down across from Malfoy.
“‘S nothing.” Ron shrugged. He opened his mouth again, but Harry interrupted him.
Fuck. How had he missed that? Of course Dudley wasn’t asking about his well being. He was asking about something that mattered.
“We’d agreed, you understand?”
“Shirty Hat Shorts, though.  Everyone says that, don’t they.” Harry quipped.
“Let’s get something to eat.”
She cackled with delight. “I love you too, dear. We’ll go once you’re dressed.”
“Draco. Even if we found some pigeon to sign as our potioneer, they’d know.”
The mug in Draco’s hand dropped to the floor and broke, scattering shards of pottery about.  Granger whipped out her wand and waved it.  The mug repaired itself while Draco continued to gape like a fish.
“But..”
Harry chewed his lip for a moment.  “I just didn’t understand. She said she doesn’t want to be married. As though marriage itself is the problem.  ‘Marriage’ is why she doesn’t want to be with me anymore.”
Draco made his way to the back corner table as he had done all week. Just after he sat down, he heard shouting coming from the kitchens. Olivia caught Draco’s eye and made a curious face. She peeked her head through the swinging doors and immediately ducked, covering her head. A metal baking pan hit the door where her head had been just a moment before.
“Ta!”
Draco swallowed, his eyes still on Harry’s lips.  He nodded, absently.
Muggle clothes.
“That yaa oddessy a fil- mooovieee-” Draco tried.
“Might have done.”
Draco felt Harry’s intense gaze on him.  “We’ve won an award for fewest brawls.” he added.
He collapsed on the sofa as soon as he arrived back at the flat.
“I mean, you know. What are you doing here?” The irritating man gestured broadly around them. He was impossible. Potter took a step closer to him. Draco swallowed.
“You’ve got about twenty pages of Draco Malfoy surveillance from first year in there.” Ron said.
“I know.” Weasley said, gently. “We all lost people.”
Harry looked back up at Ron. Guilt flooded through him.
“The muggle ones do.”
“You’re fine, love.” he said, placing a kiss on Draco’s cheek.  They’d been seeing each other for a few weeks and it seemed to be going well enough.  Draco erred on the side of caution, but was hesitantly optimistic.  He was much more fit that the last date Draco had been on.  Luc’s dark brown, nearly black hair was perfectly tousled, a technique Draco envied but had never been able to achieve himself.  Luc also had beautiful hazel eyes.  In some lights they shone green and Draco was captivated.
“You’re eating out of that pastry case?” asked Draco after she’d sauntered away. “Are you sure you’re not a Gryffindor?”
“Well?” Draco crossed his arms. “Are you going to tell me what happened or not?”
” She leaned in when she said his name, like she was in on some kind of secret.
Once they disappeared down the hall, Hermione collapsed on the sofa beside Harry. She leaned her head on the arm of the sofa and curled up on her side. Harry followed suit on the other end of the sofa.
“Harry?”
“Witchr?  It’s the muggle free dating app.”
Malfoy clearly minded but didn’t say it.  He merely nodded.
“Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.”
omnioculars Potter?  Absolutely not. Get your own pair.”
They turned back toward the registers, and Draco stopped in his tracks. In the middle of the aisle was none other than Hermione Granger and her progeny. The child was strapped to her with some sort of cloth wrap. Granger’s hair was up in a wild bun. She looked nothing like the sleek attorney she was the last time he’d seen her.
She blushed and gave Weasley a kiss.
Harry arched his eyebrow at her. “Oh really? You’re just going to let me languish on my own?”
“Utter shit.”
“Yeah, I think we got that.” Olivia said. “Soo…..”
Herb chuckled and tapped his temple.  “My best pensieve memories are of her.  And it was, oh around thirty years later.  I was visiting Diagon Alley. I saw her come out of Flourish and Blotts.”
“The difference is that one’s shit.”
Ron shrugged. “So? Where else is he going to go? I reckon the Malfoys aren’t exactly welcome in Diagon Alley.”
They sat a few moments, appreciating the silence. Harry was halfway through his cigarette when George spoke up.
Malfoy turned his glare on Harry. “Thanks for that Potter.”
Draco was watching him carefully.  “I wasn’t sure how to bring it up casually.”
“Why don’t you just scourfingy them, mate?” came Ron’s voice beside him.
“Too much?” She looked about to say more but something in the reflection caught her eye.  Draco gave her a questioning look. She indicated something with her head. Draco’s eyebrows knitted.  He looked around them at the table of books.
Draco poured a little cream to take the edge off. It was perfect. He had made coffee like a muggle. If only his father could see him now: in his muggle flat with his muggle flatmate and his muggle job, where he wore muggle clothing. A slow smile spread over his face as he caffeinated himself.
“I don’t know why people always say that.”  Harry replied. “Who gives a shit about a flat.”
“YOU NEVER HAVE EMOTIONS, MALFOY.”
“Malfoy!”
“Are you alright? Did she puke again?” He asked in a panic.
“Actually, sir, if we could just go over a few of the dates. You are double booked on the 7th and 16th.” She flipped open the file in Harry’s hands and started shuffling through the parchment. “I’ve really got to go, actually.” Harry snapped the folder shut and stepped around her, headed for the lifts in the Atrium.
“How’s Jean?” Potter asked, his eyes darted around as though waiting for Jean’s sudden appearance.  Never mind the fact that Potter had obviously been watching Draco and Pansy for a few minutes prior to his approach.
“Yeah, but they don’t know that, do they?”
“Oh, and thank you Millie.”
Harry scowled at Kreacher. “I’m not glaring at my eggs.”
“Oh come off it.”  Harry said, good naturedly. “I did not.”
Malfoy’s eyes sparkled with humor.  “The children, you twit.’
“But why didn’t he want me?”  Draco sobbed.  “Will I never be free of who I was at sixteen?  Will I spend my life alone?”
“What?”
“I don’t get it.”
“Do you want to come watch tv at our place?”
Draco resisted the urge to lash out. It was only friendly banter. “Obviously not.” he said stiffly.
“You found a receipt?"  he blinked.  "At Mood?"
“Er.. both?”
Harry didn’t see why not. He shrugged and gestured that they follow him up the stairs. Ron eyed the clothes that were scattered on the floor of his bedroom.
Malfoy huffed impatiently, “I’m not putting up with this.”
“I think I do actually.  The novelty aspect, anyway.”
Draco hated the way it sounded coming out of his mouth, the waver in his voice.  Self loathing curled about his stomach, settling in like a heavy meal.
“Just spit it out.” he replied, staying on his feet.
“Course I am.  Most people in my position are.  People only want to sleep with me for the novelty of it.”
Draco stared after her in confusion.
“I told him I wanted all of it.  I want to get married. And while I may not come from the epitome of a wholesome family, I’m open to the idea.  At the very least, I want to be in a family. It was always just my parents and me.” Mafloy looked out the darkening window.  “I was so lonely growing up.” he seemed to come back to himself and gave Harry a chagrined half smile. “That must seem strange to you, but I was.  My parents had to pay people to get their children to play with me.”
“I love you too.”
Jacinda waved him off. “Oh no. He and Olivia have got a flat here in London.” She finished the last of her drink. It was a pale yellow, bubbly something and smelled faintly of gin.
“Alright?” Harry asked once they were outside.
“We need to retain what is left of our image after the war destroyed it,” Laghari said. Se whirled and pointed a perfectly manicured finger at Harry, “An image you personally helped to build back up.” She paced behind Shacklebolt. “People need to believe their governments are productive in order for them to actually be successful. You are an integral part of that process, whether or not you like it.” Laghari said. “You are vital to the prosperity of the ministry and wizarding society itself, surely you can see that.”
“As you know-”
Harry was secretly grateful that Ginny was out of the country playing a match against Turkey.  Even though he was over it, Harry still felt flashes of guilt and embarrassment at the Weasley events she was in town for.
Harry glanced over his shoulder and Mrs Weasley and Hermione sitting side by side. Mrs Weasley dictating and Hermione getting it all down. He felt a smile spread across his face.
Draco’s head snapped up.
“Oh?” Draco sipped his beer.  “You didn’t go home with her, then?”
“Harry, her brother is your best mate.  It’s a wonder you’ve managed to avoid her for so long.  You’re practically family.”
“To France, you twit.”
Harry thought about this for a moment.  “He’s not who he was at school.”
“If you want efficiency, then you should BE EFFICIENT!” he shouted at her.
“You know what? Don’t worry about it.” Harry did a good show of pretending it didn’t gut him that his best mates to see the Chudley Cannons without him. Which was easy to do, because it didn’t bother him at all. Not one bit. Harry was fine.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed.  “So you pity me.”
“Draco looks good, doesn’t he?”
“I’m quite the hero, you know.” she quipped.
Harry shrugged and Draco didn’t ask any follow up questions.  He did, however, run his fingers up and down the neck of the bottle slowly. Harry trailed Draco's fingers with his eyes.
Stop, indeed.
“No? Joining Alex Horne in The Horne Section, perhaps?” the woman asked, a gleam in her eye.
“I’m bigotted.”
“Baking at the cafe doesn’t count. That is your place of employment. I’m talking beans on toast. Sunday roast. A cheeky bubble and squeak?”
“I swear, Draco, you’ve landed the last decent person in London.  It isn’t fair.”
“I am Draco Malfoy. Purchaser of chocolate buttons.” He grabbed a bag of said buttons from the shelf, threw them in with his shopping and strode off to the register, his head held high. He left Potter gaping after him in the aisle.
“Was that wandless?” George asked, impressed.
“Pansy..”  he trailed off.  Draco sighed heavily.
“So tell me about yourself, Malfoy.”
“I’m trying to move on, you know.  Why do you think I’m doing this?” he raised his right arm to Potter where the blue ministry seal was glowing mildly under his skin.  “I’m turning myself in for sentencing. I could have fucked off to France with my mother, you know. But I’m trying to do the right thing here.  I’m trying to start over. And you come in with your accusations!”
“About the same,” he blurted.
“It’s Jean.”
Malfoy looked doubtful.
“He is not,” Draco lied.  Potter looked like he was debating putting the book down.  “He looks as weedy and thin as ever.”
“Yeah, but it’s different, innit.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
“So what was Draco like at school?” asked Olivia, her eyes bouncing between the two boys. Malfoy slid into the round booth beside Harry. The pale blonde glanced up at Olivia when she asked her question and then stared daggers at his pint.
“You sound like you’ve practiced that speech a lot.”
“Yes, I am with Jean.  Not that it’s any of your business.”
Ron grunted noncommittally.
“Alright?”
Potter snorted behind him. “Ah, there he is. Same old Malfoy, having a go at me being an orphan.”
“Are you sure you should be alone, mate?”
“It’s been a few years, but I know enough to get by.”
“No offense, mate. But you’re not fine. I reckon you haven’t been for a while.”
Is dead because of me?
“And you know.. I’ll call if I need you for anything… Specific. Yeah?” Harry scratched the back of his neck. “McGonagall will look after you. She knows you’re coming. Got a place for you in the kitchens and everything.”
“You pity me and you feel the way to save poor wretched Draco Malfoy is to come onto me.  Despite the fact that you’re in a heterosexual monogamous relationship.”
Olivia correctly interpreted his reaction. Damn her. She bit her bottom lip to keep from laughing. After a deep breath she said, “Draco, you know I love you.”
“Naturally.
Harry’s head snapped up and away from Malfoy. He hadn’t even realised he’d been leaning in. Somehow, they were centimetres away from each other. He cleared his throat while Malfoy studiously refused to meet his eyes.
“I’m not following you, Malfoy.” Harry tried to sound casual. “Should I be? Are you hiding something?”
Olivia showed him the layout of the kitchen and the clipboard where the day’s baking schedule was kept.
“What do you think of Luc?”
Was the real winner of the Triwizard Tournament?
“Potter!”
Draco thought the song sounded vaguely familiar.
“I need you to answer something for me.” Olivia was doing a poor job of hiding her smile. “Have you ever been to Sainsbury’s?” She said it slowly, as though he were a child.
“I’m not a prude. I’ve got standards, is all.”
There was nothing for it: he’d have to get a flat. And he wasn’t sure that anyone in Wizarding London would let to him. Draco sighed. Muggle London it was.
“This is England, everyone knows Harry Potter.  Besides, we were at Hogwarts together.”
They were kicked out of the cafe a few minutes later.  Harry hadn’t even noticed how late it was. They strolled together through the evening in Diagon Alley.  Lanterns hung outside the shop entrances lighting the way. A few had magical winking fairy lights strung along outdoor seating.  Harry preferred Diagon Alley in the evenings. Not only because he was recognized less often but it just all seemed so much more….  Magical. Strolling through the evening talking to Malfoy he’d never felt farther from Privet Drive.
“He did something similar for me.” Malfoy said. “Saved me from a fire.”
“Where were we?” He asked as he slid into the seat.  He began unwrapping his sandwich. “Right, you were just telling me you were a virgin.”
“Indeed.”
“I was only asking.” Harry chewed his lip a moment, “I’m getting married.”
“Do not, for a moment think that because you do not see my emotions that I do not experience them.  I have a world of experience hiding them, Potter.  My life depended on it.  So you’ll forgive me if I don’t run about shouting every feeling I possess every moment of the day.”
Once they arrived at the DMLE station Harry led Malfoy to the Portkey Centre.  Harry nodded at the Portkey Officer and took the offered empty crisp packet.
Of how muggle he looked.
Then again, there was always the Floo. Sobriety was overrated.
“We’re worried about you, Draco.” Millie said.
“Was it just the two of you this morning?” Draco asked.
“Invisibility cloak.”
“No.” Harry said. He slid the parchment back. “Final answer.”
“You know Harry Potter?”
“I will not, Ronald.”
Harry opened the door to let a couple of biddies encumbered with knitting things. Harry recognised the paraphernalia from seeing them strewn about at The Burrow. A few ladies turned into many. Which then turned into an entire knitting club. Harry found himself at the receiving end of a line of ladies. They patted his arm, telling him what a nice young man he was. While he appreciated the sentiment, it was throwing him off Hermione’s time table.
“You didn’t.”
“So what happened with you guys?” Potter asked.
“Angelina and I split up.”
“Fuck.” Draco stretched and sat himself upright.
“Not necessarily. There are quite a few options included. I’ve organised them from most to least time-consuming.”
Hermione brightened and set her writing accoutrements aside on an end table. She gave Harry a quick bolstering kiss atop his head before joining everyone in the kitchen.
“Go on.”
A middle aged couple across the aisle from them had stopped eating, watching Draco with rapt attention.
Kreacher appearated in front of Harry and bowed.
“I’m well, Drake.  Really well."  His voice was disgustingly upbeat.  "And you?”
“Yeah, when we first started, but they’ve, er.. Got me pretty busy with other… things.”
“No.” He said, too emphatically.
“Go on inside, Potter,” he said softly. “They’ll take care of you.”
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?”
“Ah do deculare” Harry looked at Draco.  The blonde stared back at him fighting off a smile.  Draco used to do impersonations all the time at Hogwarts.  Typically of Harry doing something embarrassing. He knew Draco had it in him. Somewhere along the way, probably about the time of the war, Draco let that part of himself go and Harry was determined to see it again.  It was just the vowels that threw him off.
Pansy whipped out her mobile.  “Well it can’t hurt to look. Are you on Witchr?”
Jean’s fingers were just skimming the skin between the hem of Draco’s t-shirt and the top of his jeans when they were interrupted.
“Pardon?”
“I found a receipt.”
Weasley turned to the onlookers, “Alright. Bugger off, you lot! No one’s getting their bollocks hexed off.”
“I’m so sorry, mate.”
The colour drained from Malfoy’s cheeks and his eyes snapped to Harry’s.
Olivia took Draco to the coffee and tea section where there were brightly coloured plastic tubes and boxes of Nescafe.
“How did you know?”
“What are you on about ‘Mione?” Ron asked. He ran a hand along the back of her neck.
“Her team is the Holyhead Harpies?” Draco guessed.
“Harry!” Ron bellowed at him. Harry tried to ignore the awed silence that came over the pub as he made his way to the corner. The Aurors in the corner more than made up for the silence of the other patrons. They were not so much awed as pissed.
“Yeah!” she said, pointing her small finger at them.  “And you’re old!”
“I get them too, you know?” Malfoy leaned his head back on the wall. If Harry turned his head, their noses would be touching. His heart started beating faster.
“Your point being?”
Jean frowned.  “I’m sorry to hear that.  He’s not a bad bloke. Not conceited like a lot of celebs I interview.”
“I’ve made a list of activities you might try with your free time.”
“Not a chance.” Harry spat a grape seed into the bin by the door.  “You were right the first time.”
“Tell that to your face, mate. So what were you brooding about? Potter?”
“I don’t think you do,” Harry said. “I think you want what’s best for everyone other than me. I’ve given a lot to rid the world of Voldemort and his followers. It’s no longer up to just me. It’s time for you to do your jobs and stop relying on me to gaslight the community into thinking you already are.”
As soon as Potter rounded the corner Draco let out a sigh of relief. He casually draped his arm through Jean's. “Thank Merlin he didn’t recognize me.”
The remaining furniture seemed only to highlight how much had been taken. Most of Draco’s life spent either at Hogwarts or at The Manor, and he was likely never to see either again. Though, in his opinion, Malfoy Manor, much like the Malfoy family themselves, was tainted. Forever. Walking through the Manor now made Draco feel hollowed out. Gone were the days he could be delusionally proud of his heritage. If Draco never stepped foot on the place again, it’d be fine by him.
Draco paused.   He thought Potter sounded a bit remorseful, but that couldn’t be right.
Two loud things happened almost simultaneously that woke Harry from brooding. Not that he brooded, because, as previously mentioned, he was fine. The first loud thing was that Olivia called out, “Take away for Harry, Harry Potter.” The second was a loud crash from the kitchen immediately following this statement.
Harry snorted.  “Whatever you say.”
Harry smiled hollowly at Ron. “Not this time.  It almost feels inevitable. My whole life has been a one catastrophe after another, why wouldn’t my marriage.”
“And promptly divorced.”
“Potter?”
“Aaah?”
“A muggle place.  Didn’t want to get harassed, you know.”
Someone who deserved better?
“How was your evening last night?” Draco asked.
“But then he moved to America.” Pomona continued.
“Doing what, love?”
Draco thought back to his summers as a child hiding in the kitchens watching the house-elves create elaborate tea times with all his mother’s favourite French patisserie. He demanded to know how it was done and would spend as much time as he could get away with baking with them. Once his father caught him that all ended. Instead, he spent his summers being lectured about working beneath his station. And what the Malfoy name truly meant.
Draco’s heart sped up.  Why had Harry picked this song? Was he reading too much into things again?  Draco had to stop himself from over analyzing.  It wasn’t hard to put those thoughts aside.  Not with Harry Sodding Potter making a fool of himself in a muggle shop, doing his best to make Draco laugh.
Harry nodded grinning like a fool.  “Do deculare” he prompted.
“You look good with a beard.  Not everyone does.”
“No.”
“And, well.  I’m going to be a father.”
A hand at the back of his neck forced Harry to bend over his knees, the table shoved out of the way.
Harry sipped his Firewhisky as he made his way to the glass wall and sat himself down in the claw footed chair. The back garden was overrun, to be sure. He should probably call Neville. Add that to the list of things Harry ought to be doing. He debated heading to the ground floor to retrieve his bag of loathing. Or he could summon it, he supposed. Breanne! That was her name. Who knows how many hours she’d put into his schedule. He really should give it a proper going over. Instead, Harry got up and poured himself another Firewhisky. He watched the rain beat down on the window that was also a wall.
“Hadn’t thought, really.”
Harry closed his eyes a moment to appreciate his own stupidity before he trotted to catch up with Draco.
Eventually, his head began to hurt. He needed a coffee. Which required getting out of bed. Yet another thing Draco absolutely loathed. If he waited until eight, Olivia would make tea. Tea had caffeine which was supposed to get rid of his headache. The problem was, the last few weeks tea hadn’t been doing its job. Draco hated tea. If stupid tea could just give him enough caffeine, the first go round. Now he needed at least two, if not three, mugs of tea. Olivia bought him a coffee maker last week because of his rant about tea caffeinating deficiencies. Draco hated the coffee maker. Because he hated coffee, definitely not because he couldn’t figure out how to use it. Being awake was stupid and Draco hated that too. Draco rolled onto his side, his back to the window.
Draco flushed. Damn the woman. Why were they friends?
He watched the traffic move through the cafe and thought, as he often did, of Potter. Draco made it through the trials in a haze. He had a hard time telling if the despair, humiliation, or relief were stronger. Most of the time, he felt numb. The families with loved ones who died at Hogwarts were the worst of it. They sat there in the front. Witnesses to his list of atrocities. Draco couldn’t look at them, he felt sick. He brought this on them. He alone let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Every single person who died did so because of him. The Dark Lord had been trying to get to Hogwarts for fifty years and it was Draco who finally helped him succeed. He was sure he was going to Azkaban for life, alongside his father. But then Potter happened, as he always does. With his unyielding heroism and ridiculous hair. Going around sticking up for people who don’t want it and certainly don’t deserve it. Wasn’t it enough Potter had pulled him from the fire? Couldn’t he bugger off and let Draco rot away in prison like a normal person? But nothing about Potter was normal, was it? Course not.
Ron bellowed from the centre of the dance floor, “Ten seconds until the New Year!”
“TEN!” the crowd shouted.
“It is, truly.”  Draco said, turning back to his chopping block.  “It might be awhile before you connect with someone again.  Maybe even longer before you sleep with them. I think that’s perfectly normal.”
“We had our first detention together! First year!”
“Need help finding them?”
Malfoy gave Harry a long look before he swallowed and looked away. “Alright.”
“Harry you know I can’t do accents.  Don’t make me.”
“Shirty Hat Shorts?” the ginger shouted.
“Oh, come on Malfoy. You are the last person in the world who’d think I was perfect. You were taking the piss every chance you got. Or do you not remember when you made badges that said Potter Stinks and got half the school to wear them!”
Harry nodded.  Nods were easier than words.
“Goodnight, Harry.” Draco said quietly.
“I’ve just got to get these interviews, you understand?”
“Sure it is.”  Harry said, absently.  He was leaning on the door frame with the curtain pushed back.
The shouting drew quite a crowd. He heard the murmuring grow louder. Someone spit at his feet. Draco continued to stare at the ground. If this was how he met his end, it was a far better ending than he deserved.
“Harry, I’ve told you a thousand times to call me Molly.”
Blaise was kind enough to let Draco impose upon him for a few months after the Manor was taken by the Ministry. Draco knew it couldn’t be a permanent situation, even though the flat was owned outright and money wasn’t technically an issue. He felt uncomfortable having to ask for assistance in any way. It felt wrong to owe someone, even a friend. But Draco had a plan, one that Blaise wasn’t entirely sold on.
Draco Malfoy was heading to Muggle London.
Harry pulled a flask out of his jacket pocket. George lifted an eyebrow at him.
The waiter arrived with their dinner.  “That’s disgusting,” he said.
Her face fell with exaggerated exasperation.  “What would you know about tits, anyway. Should have asked Blaise.”
“Malfoy.”  He said, tracing a finger along his jaw.  Harry’s eyes were even more green without his glasses. Green and brilliant and more intense than Draco had ever seen.  “Draco.  Tell me to stop.”
Kreacher nodded encouragingly, “Very good Master. Friends is good for lifting Master’s spirits.” He shuffled into the sitting room, muttering under his breath.
“If you must know, he tried to chat me up.  I turned him down, obviously. He was seeing Ginny Weasley.”
“Careful, I’ve got glasses on.”
“EIGHT!”
“Sir?”
She arched her eyebrow at the given name.
“Excellent.” Draco replied.
“Another round?” Harry asked.
“That’s very dangerous, Draco. You can’t drink port like wine, it’s so much stronger.” Millie said.
“Lovely to see you both.  Please excuse us.” Draco nodded at them and trotted to catch up with Harry.
“What?”
“But I never forgot her.” Herb glanced at his wife, a half smile on his face.  Remorse for time lost but grateful for what little time they had.
Harry quirked an eyebrow.  His heartbeat sped up.
If Draco had to watch Potter manhandle his girlfriend for a moment longer he was going to sick up.  The stupid Auror had the Weaselette pushed up against the train platform wall, snogging as though oxygen was a luxury and not the very basis of life.  It was disgusting. Uncouth. Draco wouldn’t be caught dead in such an unseemly position, in public no less.
“Potter.”
“Is that what we are?” Harry asked, “Friends?”
“It’s just, he’s a bit young for Harry, isn’t he?”
“Nescafe?”
Harry’s eyes roved over Malfoy’s somehow (magically, that’s how) perfect hair. His well-fitting muggle clothes.
A round of cheers went up around the table. Harry grinned around at his former team members and made for the bar. The whispers followed him all the way there. He placed his order and tried not to make eye contact with anyone as conversation picked back up. That is until drunk bloke at a barstool swivelled right into his path.
“But-”
“You’re really fine?”
“What.” Harry groaned out.
shorts.”
“No, you’re not a simpleton. You’ve just led a very sheltered life. Honestly, I don’t know how you got on before me.”
Draco shook his head.
Harry frowned, “You don’t like it?”
Draco foolishly let Harry choose the location which is why they were at a Wetherspoons instead of fine dining.  They ordered burgers and opted for bottled beer which was safest according to Draco.
Kingsley glanced at her, “That’s right.  Roberta.” he turned in his seat to face her directly.  “But I couldn’t look away from you. I can’t remember what I said precisely.”
“No, that’s not it either!" Draco half-heartedly shook Potter in exasperation.  "He called, and I knew what he was going to say.  We don’t keep up.  There’s no reason for him to call.  I knew precisely what he was going to say and I took the call anyway.”  Draco took another deep breath and sat back.  Harry gently wiped a tear from his cheek.  Draco scoffed.  “Merlin I need a tissue.”
“Let it go, mate. Don’t get obsessed with Malfoy again.” Ron squeezed his shoulder. “Take a shower. Get dressed. We’ll swing by and pick you up for dinner later.”
“How was it?” Ron asked when he returned. He quirked an eyebrow at them.
“I’m sorry! It’s what I do when I’m terrified out of my mind.”
“Would you, now?”  Draco's fingers were now circling the rim of the beer bottle.
“Draco, you’re such a prude.” Millie said. She was nothing of the brutish girl she’d been at Hogwarts. She’d grown into her body and Draco had to admit, it was impressive.
“Nightmares, Dudley.” Harry said. His voice sounded wooden, “They were nightmares.”
“Course.  One sugar, no milk.”
Ron sighed. “Harry, mate. You were supposed to meet us two hours ago.”
“Fuck, mate.”
“Come now, Harry. You can imagine how helpful you would be. A little positive press for us, an enjoyable night of amusement for you.”
“I don’t know what else to tell you, Draco.” Blaise paused. He clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m sorry.” Blaise looked at Draco for a long moment before he stepped into the fireplace and disappeared.
Harry grinned and tugged him forward into the rest of the house.  Harry barely recognized the place.  Hermione had clearly been at work with the expansion charms.  The cottage looked more like a Tudor hall or something registered with the National Trust.  Huge brown beams led to a large vaulted ballroom where their sitting room used to be with beautiful hardwood floors.
Harry ignored him and began scrolling through the songs on the karaoke machine. Overjoyed with his selection, he grabbed Draco’s arm again pulling him in close so they could both see the screen.  “Come on, you know this one!”
Draco blinked.  Harry took advantage of his hesitation and wrapped him in a hug, his chin over Malfoy’s shoulder.  “Thank you, Draco.”  Harry felt Draco’s arm wrap around his waist.
“Alright.” Harry replied.
Potter handed him a self-inking quill.  Draco signed the parchment in mid-air and then Potter tapped it with his wand.  The parchment went slack again and rolled up into a scroll of its own accord. Potter snatched it out of the air and tapped it with his wand again.  A clump of purple wax appeared while a small ribbon tied the scroll in place. Draco saw the ministry seal form inside the purple wax. Potter tied it to the leg of an owl Draco hadn’t even noticed was there and sent it off.
“How?”
“Right. Mary Berries. She is..” Draco chewed on his lip. “Irreplaceable?” he said slowly, relieved when Olivia agreed.
“You absolute wanker.” Ron breathed, laughing.  “Go on, then. Tell me what it’s like.”
“You did what?”
“Back again, love?” Olivia asked him.
The server came to take Blaise’s order, and he bravely asked not only for a coffee but a cheese danish as well. She simpered at him and batted her eyelashes. It took ages for the words to make it from Blaise’s mouth onto the pad of paper. Draco wondered if she had brain damage of some sort. Blaise positively preened under her gaze.
“I’m perfectly capable of dressing myself, thank you.” Harry objected.
They stared at each other for too long. Somehow Potter had become more fit. Auror training must have helped him fill out his physique. Draco had been too shocked to find him outside the cafe the other day to appreciate Potter up close. His t-shirt fit significantly better than Draco remembered at Hogwarts. His jeans fit more snugly too, though he still had clearly never been to a tailor. The bottoms of his jeans draped over his worn out trainers, the backs of them torn to shreds from being stepped on constantly. Draco realised he just fully checked out Harry Potter and snapped his eyes back up.
“What do you guys do?”
“Are you doing okay, Harry?” Bill asked softly. He glanced at the pile of bread scraps that had previously existed, only moments before, as Harry’s bread roll.
“Drake?”
Malfoy bit his lip and looked down at his shoes. “It won’t work. There’s too much there.”
“I’ll be in the press box.”
Draco’s eyes darted around for the tall, limbering frame of Weasley. What if Potter and Weasley were both here with her? Draco’s pulse spiked. Was he going to run into Potter with his friends? Draco wasn’t sure he could suffer the humiliation, as well deserved as it was.
“I’d better get to my seat. It was good to see you, mate.” Potter said.
“Is he?”
“Those faux flames are wicked, innit."
Harry nudged Draco with his shoulder.  He handed over one of the microphones, nodding encouragingly.  “Come one, the words pop up on the screen, right there.   You have to have heard this at some point in your life.”
Blaise held up a half empty bottle. “Did you drink this by yourself, mate?” he asked.
After a few minutes, Ginny cleared her throat. Harry’s stomach tightened. He watched her grab Neville’s hand. Neville who looked up at her as though she were Felix Felisis come to life. Ginny took a deep breath and tried clearing her throat again, more aggressively this time. Neville beamed at her and squeezed her hand. Did no one else see what was going on? Harry glanced at Mr and Mrs Weasley. Then at Bill and Fluer. At George. Finally, at Ron and Hermione. Hermione’s eyes were enormous, and she covered her mouth with her hands.
“We’ve been growing apart for some time. It felt like a natural end to things.”
The man stammered at him, knife still in hand.
If Harry didn’t know any better, that sounded like jealousy.  It wasn’t of course. Draco wasn’t interested in Harry, he knew this.
Harry realized they were standing very close together.  Much closer than he anticipated. With Malfoy halfway down the step in front of him, Harry was ever so slightly taller than Malfoy.  The nearness of him threw Harry off balance. He lost the trail of their bickering.
“You want to have a good time, don’t you? Go to a party, have a laugh with your mates.”
“Stop, please waste no more of my time.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, letting his hand drop. He opened his eyes and looked directly at her, “I have a tuba to catch.”
This party went far better.  Ron and Hermione’s new house was perfect: the epitome of an English cottage, complete with a cow named Lady.  Hermione lit the back garden with jars of the little blue flames she used to conjure at Hogwarts.  It was enchanting and nostalgic. Molly took Rosie for the evening so Ron and Hermione could have some grown up fun for the New Year.
Harry felt guilty about his “bed days.” They occurred more often than he’d like. He silently reprimanded himself for allowing his behaviour to slip so noticeably. “You didn’t have to do all this, Kreacher. I was headed down to the kitchen, honest.” Harry lied.
“Oh.”
Harry snorted. Then groaned as his head throbbed in response. He took a deep breath and threw his legs over the side of the bed. Harry waited a moment before trying to stand up fully. He heard, rather than saw, Ron leave the room and return a few moments later. At which point Harry felt a hangover potion shoved in his hand. Forget what he thought before. Best friends forever. Never had he loved Ron more than this moment. Harry necked it immediately. He waited while the steam came pouring out his nose and ears. Then heaved a sigh of relief and flopped back onto the bed.
Olivia nodded. “Yes, I’d like an answer to that as well. Was there no internet at your school?”
“Earlier I was. But no. Not exactly.”
“It’s..  fine?” Harry said.
Draco was grateful enough time had passed since the war that he was no longer hexed in the streets.  His gradual re-integration into Wizarding society didn’t seem as monumental as he’d thought it would in his twenties.   Life in the Muggle world had done him good. Mellowed him out, gave him perspective. Meeting Pansy at Flourish & Blotts ten years ago would be terrifying.  Now it was commonplace. They’d meet up just as often at random muggle bookshops. Pansy always said she accompanied him out of loyalty but never failed to leave a bookshop without a few tawdry romance novels.
Draco climbed into bed.  Harry brought over a warm knitted blanket.  He sat beside Draco and put an arm around him.  Draco leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead.  Draco relaxed a little, which made things worse.  He sobbed messily onto Harry’s shoulder.
“You did.  And you said we couldn’t be friends.  So I don’t see why you’ve inserted yourself into my life again.  I can assure you, Auror Potter, that I am not ‘up to something.’”
Harry felt caught in the moment and their eyes met.  Malfoy tugged the left sleeve of his jacket down. A floral tattoo was poking out from the sleeve of his leather jacket.  He probably did understand, come to that.
“Life is beautiful?” Harry asked, “He just said they were shorts, mate.”
“So how was your date, then?  She was a muggleborn, right?”
“I’m sorry, Potter.” he said.
Blaise’s eyes continued to rove around the room.
“She never had a problem with it before.” Ron said.
Potter glanced at the watch on his wrist.  Potter had never accessorized before and Draco didn’t recognize it.  He must not have worn it at Hogwarts. Though, he may have worn it during the Battle of Hogwarts by the look of it.  Scuffed and tarnished, Draco would never wear such a dreadful thing. Were those scorch marks?
Draco looked down at himself.  He tugged his left sleeve down.  “Problem?”
If Ron thought a quidditch game would cheer Harry up he was dead wrong.  They didn’t have top box seats, thank Christ. Ron wanted to, now that he could afford them, but Harry didn’t want Lee Jordan pointing him out again.  He didn’t have enough energy to put on a cheery face and pretend he was having the time of his life. Particularly when his life was yet again falling apart.
“Your lot stopped it, then?”
Draco took a deep breath and swallowed what little pride he had left.
“Get what?”
Honestly, Draco didn’t know which part was worse. That Potter had so valiantly spoken on his behalf or that he wouldn’t meet Draco’s eye afterward. It was almost a relief that Potter avoided looking at him. Almost. Draco didn’t know what he would see in those green eyes. But it wasn’t hatred, not anymore. And Draco didn’t know what to do with that.
“I don’t know why you’re bothering to explain this to me. Just put it on.”
"There must be a reception issue.  It sounded as though you said you were going to be a father."
“You know” he gestured with his hand, “What have you been up to?”
Harry’s heart sped up.
They made it through another chorus.  Harry began dancing, jumping and in general making a prat of himself.  The joy was unbearable.  Draco hated it.  He never wanted the moment to end.  The two of them could go on singing silliness forever and Draco would die happily.  Decorum be damned! He couldn’t help but be taken in by Potter’s enthusiasm.  The man was such a fool and so happy doing it.
He didn't dare to look up due to the rapid pounding of his heart he could hear clearly and the heat that was crawling to his cheeks. This probably ruined their friendship but he felt attacked at this moment and he couldn't really handle it in his current state. Having given up on keeping his mouth shut he started to add in a low voice, directed to himself as he was in deep thought as he tried to retreat from the other's warmth.
Now if only his body would move right now, that would be great. But with Hermione staring at the two of them, Ron's hair peeking from behind her before he also came in view, he felt as if they had intruded. Noticing Harry's gaze shifting to something behind him, Draco turned around to see what or who it was. His body instantly stiffened and he could almost feel himself fall back into his usual posture, cold and distant. He had the urge to curse the two Gryffindors for walking in at this exact moment but was wise enough to not do so.
"What makes you ask it then if it's ridiculous?"
With the dark lord gone Harry had found himself having too much time on his hands which he never knew how to exactly spend. As he spent his time with Malfoy he felt something inside him spark, but he had brushed it aside as 'that he had just been lonely after Ginny'.
Harry wished to know what had made the other upset, although he knew better. One does not hide their emotions for no reason after all. It made him wonder what could have popped up in his friend's mind all that sudden to make him this emotional.
The reply was higher in pitch as usual, almost hoarse too, and Draco turned to find the other gulp down his water.
Though no one can fully choose their own path without sacrifice.
'Someone. If you hear this, please send help.' Harry wanted to slam his head against the table and-THUD. Oh no, he just couldn't control himself now, did he? He groaned, feeling his forehead tingle. That hurt. "I didn't mean it in such a way necessarily," he mumbled while rubbing his head. "Take a joke, Mal." He shifted in his seat and- oh shit... He did not.
Maybe it was better to ask for something they could take with them. Something simple.
"Aha.." Draco hummed, concentrating on his bread. They had had this conversation before, and as much as he wanted to be there for Pansy, he had gotten bored with her rants. But he supposed it was fair to listen since she put up with his rants about Potter as well. Speaking of Potter, Draco realized he should be having lunch as well. He looked up and scanned the crowd of students, looking for a familiar mop of messy black hair. Honestly, did that guy even know there were several ways to tame such hair?
For a few seconds, Malfoy agreed with this, but that soon changed when he realized this wasn't Harry's fault. He couldn't have known. And he hadn't shown any negative reactions to the scene yet, so...
They didn't help press the nightmare back though…
"I thought that Ron would probably be with Hermione and that we could find the two of them somewhere romantic, as far as romance goes here at Hogwarts, on a date. I… I should have been clearer about that. Sorry, I don't know if I made this… Weird."
That had surprised Harry quite a bit and he stalled his writings to look back at the blonde who had leaned back in his chair. Okay if this was some weird daydream due to his fatigue it might as well end now. He shifted back to his work before the other would notice his staring, trying to keep the words fresh in the back of his mind so he wouldn't have to ask the guy to repeat himself.
Not in a way that would leave him in pain, but in a way that would leave him both breathless and longing for more.
Malfoy leaned back again. Something about all of this satisfied him. Teaching someone, and then seeing the result was quite satisfying. Maybe that's why people became teachers. He continued to kind of look around, lost in his thoughts.
Draco suppressed a chuckle and folded his hands in his lap. "I know what you need. You need Quidditch. You're no good, stuck in a bed all day. Fresh air and some exercise might be better than staying put here. As soon as you're healthy enough to leave, we could just claim the pitch for a bit," he suggested.
Okay. Yep. This was absolutely the closest someone had ever gotten to Draco. He was not used to this at all and was actually a bit paralyzed by the other boy's actions. He didn't dare to move and dared even less to speak. A big part of him wanted to shake the other off, but there was this small part holding him back.
"It's okay Mal. We all had problems going back here. I guess I can understand why you would go back to the old ways, but... You're not alone in this anymore."
"Friends," He repeated, taking the other's hand. "I'll talk to them, but I can't guarantee anything." A small smile played on his lips. He was glad they had settled this. It was then he registered his surroundings once again. "Yesterday you brought me here, right? I can't really fully recall what happened, but seeing you came back I guess I was doiing quite badly, huh?"
Malfoy gave him a puzzled look. "Did I?" He wasn't even sure, maybe he had. But he'd given him that sort of laugh before right? Yes, but in a mocking way, that's different. Right then…
He shifted his gaze to the other, keeping it there because well, it wasn't a bad view. He would have done anything for the other, at least he could admit that now, but this was such a delicate thing. Draco did not trust himself enough to do it.
"The question isn't how I should do it, but when I'll get myself to do it," Draco explained while leaning back against the headboard. "I can just tell them, that's not hard. It's not some deep dark secret," he let out a short, breathy laugh. "Anyway… Have you talked to the party to anyone yet?"
The Slytherin felt himself freeze a bit. This was enough evidence, right? It was pretty obvious now. But it hadn't been put into literal words yet. Somehow, even though it was nearly a fact, Malfoy couldn't get himself to believe it. He wondered if he would even believe it if Potter would admit it. But then again, wasn't this just a matter of wanting to believe it? There was one way to end all of this, to maybe get his mind to shut up. He had to know for sure if he was right about this.
Harry let his hand slip out of the other's hair to cup the Slytherin's face, thumb caressing the soft cheek as he couldn't help but smile against the other's lips, his tongue soon enough darting out again. Time seemed quite irrelevant, but Draco still faintly wondered how much of it had passed by now.
He walked into the hospital wing and started looking for Madam Pomfrey. She'd know what to do. Draco found Pomfrey in her office and immediately asked her to please take a look at Potter. She seemed a bit confused at first, which didn't surprise him since nearly the whole school knew about Malfoy's and Potter's usual rivalry, but this was about a sick student. She got up and walked up to Harry, who was holding himself up against a wall. The first thing she did was guide him to one of the beds, then she commanded him to sit or lay down so she could ask him a few things. After that, she started a quick checkup to see if this was a natural or magical issue. Malfoy just kind of watched, he wasn't sure what else to do. Suddenly he felt like an intruder. This was a medical issue, those were quite personal, right? Who was he to just stand there, invading Potter's private doctor moment thing?
It was the most ridiculous expression the blonde had ever heard, but it was true. It would be a big enough distraction, Draco was sure of that.
Though the image of Snape kept lingering. He wondered why the man still seemed to hate him so much. Was it because he reminded him of his mom, Lily Evans, and the man still couldn't handle it? Maybe he shouldn't search for so many things to even occupy his mind if he wanted to rest, but his mind was overflowing with questions sometimes that just lingered.
"Yeah sure," he brushed it off.
A suffocating fear spread all throughout his body, paralyzing him.
"Just the usual, being so clever and all. I'm just as smart as her, but do I put up a whole show in front of the class, just to let them see how smart I am? No. I don't think anyone should act like that, but there she goes putting her hand up every single time-"
It took Malfoy the time Harry was in discussion with himself to feel truly at ease and to return the other's hug. At this point he didn't care what was happening anymore, it felt too good to bother. He was now completely draped in Potter's warmth and entangled with his body. His face was partially buried in the other's hair, which was surprisingly fluffy and apparently the source of the soapy scent he'd smelled before.
Draco stopped for a moment and looked over at the other. They'd been having a silly fight, and he was glad to call the quits.
Harry followed her through the hall, leading them towards a less secluded area.
One that ignored all of his standards and made him melt underneath the other's touches.
Draco was showing a ridiculous amount of care, it baffled him. Where was this feeling coming from, and more importantly, why wasn't he hiding it?
With his mind still lightly on Christmas, he recalled Ron's request to come over to his house. He felt like he would intrude though. And with the way things were going now, Snape would probably be on the verge of strangling him or anything. He guessed he had to stay at Hogwarts if he wanted to get on the right track with his assignments.
He softly chuckled as he bent down, "You don't have a scarf with you, don't you?", fingers brushing over the red spots.
"I'm sorry, but what is all of this supposed to be? A date? Are you asking me…" His eyes widened a bit.
"Yes, a great pillow that is," he huffed and lightly patted the other's arm before he walked past him towards the door. Harry kept walking even if while it felt like he had to force his feet to move. They felt heavy, his whole body did in fact. He let out a short hum. Was it something the potion caused?
Besides, Malfoy was mature enough to see that his childish feuds with Potter's friends should end. He wasn't 'my father will hear about this' Draco Malfoy anymore, he was nearly an adult. The war had changed him considerably, and he should've shown that from the start of their last school year. Now was the time to at least try to make up for that.
Of course, before Draco could enter the dungeons, he had to go through a hallway where a certain person was having some sort of midlife crisis on a bench. Of course, this certain person was Potter, because this universe really liked to fuck him over sometimes. He felt himself tense up a bit but used this to keep the calmest, unphased expression as he walked past the boy, ignoring him completely. He had apologized already if Potter didn't take his excuse, that wasn't his problem.
"I want you to forget about it. The whole conversation." He deliberately didn't answer Harry's question, because he couldn't. Just a moment he'd probably regret for the rest of his life. However, instead of being ashamed of it, it made him bitter. Angry, almost.
As usual, the Boy Who Lived felt that tension of being frustrated and powerless, the embarrassment not adding any good vibes. He just wanted to fall into a hole or sit in a corner so no one would bother him. Which had been Draco's goal, even Harry knew that. He tried to regain his senses and push his feelings away. He stood up with a deep sigh. "Can someone get a broom? I dropped some trash."
He had felt the other shake and only now realized his word hadn't really helped. Hesitantly, he brought one hand to the blonde locks to brush through them and bloody hell they were soft. "Sorry… It's okay, Mal. You're fine, I got you."
When the other finished talking, he simply smiled and told the other he was leaving. It was useless to stay if he couldn't keep his mind in check. He let out a deep breath and walked through the halls, not sure where to go to. Like this, he wandered around until he found himself back at the hospital wing. Harry let out a breathy laugh and shook his head while he made his way inside without questions and sat back on the bed he had left that morning. His stuff was still there and Pomfrey had filled his glass and left a note with it, stating he should drink it if he were to see it.
It was when he was about to give up on his work and search for Neville, ten minutes in his work, that the said boy came walking up to him with a thick book. He looked nicely surprised when he saw him. "Harry, it's good to see you. How are you?" As the boy closed in Harry turned around in pleasant surprise.
Silence fell between them as the students around them silently muttered to one another. Harry felt his anger fly out the window as if someone just used Expelliarmus on it. "I mean… He's very busy… Very important…" Draco added to his previous words.
When the elf scurried off again, Draco turned back to Harry with a stern look.
"W-well…" He started, just because he didn't want it to turn silent just like that. "Thank you…"
Draco had never looked at the other in the way he was now, but now that he did, things started changing. In a way, he was proud to be the one hugging him. He nuzzled back against the other, smiling softly.
He didn't want to think about the Room of Requirement.
He didn't care if it looked like he was staring, maybe he should just admit already that Potter was on his mind a lot. It would certainly make things easier, but also more complicated at the same time.
That was Hermione, he noted. Wait. He shot up in the bed that wasn't his own, head aching. Why was he here? Where was here?
Having the other boy actually realize that thought for him froze his body. There was no way this was really happening.
Pansy's playful expression turned a bit grimmer, and Draco instantly regretted being so harsh about it. "Look," he said, "No one here even knows I own a violin, it's kind of a personal thing. The fact that you even know I play is because you caught me doing it once. I've never shown it to anyone, ever."
Harry felt his body shiver at the tunes that came from the violin, accompanied by the feeling that radiated from the other. It swayed from higher tunes that slowly went back and forth to lower tunes, sometimes they would sound more rushed.
"Yes. You will indeed," he returned, sliding closer as he felt like his heart was about to explode. This guy would cause his death, unlike the damn dark lord…
He sighed and dropped his hand. "Because I laughed. Or well, it wasn't really a laugh, more like a sound that kind of sounded like a laugh in some way, but you thought it was a miracle because I never laugh and then you called it a Christmas miracle because it's almost christmas." The words just spilled out in an unflattering mess. He usually preferred to keep his speech formal and decent, but this time that really didn't work, somehow.
"A date," he murmured, deep in thoughts. Now Ron and he were in a fight it was even more likely the two would go on one, right?
Yes, it would be great if students from all four houses would join in. Not only would it be a 'jolly Christmas at Hoggy Hogwarts' it would also be a real come-together. No one had to be left out unless they wished not to participate of course. The teachers wouldn't bother them either, as the room of Requirement would most definitely provide them with a place they could just celebrate Christmas their own way without the teachers barging in. This would also be a good way to let Malfoy wiggle himself back in the masses. Harry knew that most students disliked the blonde Slytherin, but they might allow his presence near again. It was Christmas after all and Harry just knew that Malfoy felt bad for his actions.
There was no time to think about such things, not when there was so much going on.
Slightly turning his head Harry rose an eyebrow in amusement, a grin on his face as he answered. "Hm, no need to thank me for it, I had no influence in it. Rather thank your parents." He had done enough damage to his barriers as he was already cuddled up with the other… Harry knew the other didn't mind or else he wouldn't have proposed it himself, though he still felt like this was off. They couldn't just get this cozy without consequences. And his rapid pulse showed how too close to one another they actually were for his heart.
"Should I even ask what happened this time, or instantly assume it's because you don't know how to take care of yourself?" Yes, Draco was fuming, but not because he hated Potter. It wasn't like that at all. Maybe it was even the opposite. He was angry because he was worried. Though, it probably didn't look like that to the Gryffindor. He should've thought about that, but decided to not bother at the moment.
"Mornin'..." he mumbled as he raked a hand through his messy, blond hair. He probably looked terrible.
When it came to Quidditch, he had been carefully watching the other Quidditch players, Malfoy especially when he entered as a fellow seeker. The sport had been new to him but reminded him somewhat of football. With a light stretch, he pulled himself up to sit back up on the bed to look at the other. "I did watch you, close enough if I say so. That's why I said it. Care to show I'm wrong then?"
"Surely, you must also know that if you really do become friends with him, the whole school will know. Trying to keep it from me will be useless." "I know," Draco replied, his voice low. This had obviously annoyed Pansy. She went quiet but was nearly attacking her bread instead of just gently ripping pieces off. "Fine. Your problem then. I like a bit of a show anyway."
Malfoy nodded. He looked back and noticed that his violin was also still there, forgotten next to the couch.
Harry's hand lingered on the doorknob.
It caused a worried Gryffindor. All he could do for a moment was just stand there with the boy as he held his wrist. Oh man, how do they never give you social studies to teach you how to handle sad or traumatized people? When he felt a light breeze come past him he looked at his blanket. Would it be weird to open it up and let the other in? Honestly, Harry wasn't too sure if he could find any words right now but neither would it help at all if he just stood there. What he did know was that Malfoy wasn't the guy who would want to be seen in this broken down state by just anyone passing by.
If the other had stained him, he was going to return the favor.
A nauseous feeling washed over the Gryffindor.
"I'm sorry, it's just…" Draco stopped pacing and looked at the other with a difficult expression. "I know it's your own fault, I guess I'm just angry because you make me worry. And I'm irritated because you keep ending up in this damn room, I don't like seeing you hurt Potter." He really shouldn't have acted all his frustration out on him, it wasn't fair, but it had still happened. What was wrong with him?
For now, he wasn't sure what to do. Hugging was fine, not a permanent solution, but a nice temporary fix. Draco decided it was probably the best he could manage right now.
As expected Neville grabbed some students from the other corner after Harry's request and they could help him quite efficiently. It was hard to understand everything the kid said, yet eventually, they managed to get out of it. When it got late enough to call it a night Harry thanked the guy, whose name he had never caught, and headed off to the dorm with Neville - who was talking full enthusiasm about some plant.
Harry had shaken his head with a small smile before he returned his gaze at the other, who just turned out to look at him as well. Malfoy's gaze lay heavily on him, it made him feel weird to be watched like this, although it wasn't really a bad thing. When the other looked away Harry blinked.
"Say, you didn't mind the cuddles from before, right?" He asked hesitantly.
Harry didn't dare to look behind him anymore, not with his cheeks set ablaze like this. With unusually bigger steps he made his way towards the lake.
Disclaimer:
"But, I'm a mess..." The blonde mumbled, only realizing that now.
"Alright…" He nodded. Something in him wanted to continue bickering. Something in him wanted to scold the other for being such a prat, but this time he was thoughtful enough to ignore it. Instead, he noticed how Potter was looking dazed, again.
"Why's the fact that unlike you, I know stuff, interesting?"
Harry couldn't help but laugh. "Where...-where did that come from?" Seeing the previous question, he would have thought the other wondered why he wasn't staying over at the Weasley's household if Christmas were to be like that. It nestled in him, digging for the emotions he had shielded away for a bit.
Again, Harry's mind shifted to a whole different topic as if his basic functions were totally out of control. He turned to look at Draco, failing to notice how out of place the other felt, as he spoke under his breath. "It's almost Christmas." The blonde gave him a mildly surprised look. "Yes, it is…" He answered slowly. He'd avoided thinking about Christmas ever since his father's letter. He wasn't in the mood to discuss it now either.
"I doubt Ron and Hermione wouldn't go and tell me upright that it's all inside my head and the guy's gone, they have been doing that a lot. Didn't help. But if it comes to reminding me to drink I guess they do the job…" Harry murmured at that statement in response.
He had to confess he wanted the other to lay with him like this without rest. But with the other cutting himself off, he didn't know what the other wanted from him. It messed him up, made him need a few seconds to breathe. He was kinda afraid to be let down, so he needed to shake it off.
Call it Fanservice
He tried to listen. After all the other had wanted to talk to him about gravity-resistant trees when he had been searching for something that could help him breathe underwater with the Triwizard tournament. He had brushed it off while the other had probably just wanted something to talk about with Harry, as these trees were probably used for the brooms the players in quidditch used.
"Maybe you have to sit down with them and spill your genuine thoughts and feelings about it," he murmured.
"I don't know," Malfoy answered. "I guess I'll ask him later."
He had to agree on some point, but he didn't truly think it would be good to share this with Malfoy. Although a part of him screamed to just get it over with. He let his head fall back just too fast, banging a little hard against the wall which made him groan. "Okay karma, fine, I'll tell."
Her eyes fell back on them as she held Ron. "We will discuss this later. Come on Ron, let's go."
Harry's eyes flashed between the elves and Malfoy. His throat felt dry, yes, and he hadn't eaten yet. Yet he couldn't help but see Dobby in them. As one of the elves walked close enough with a plate, he signaled it kindly and asked for it, fortunately receiving it. He proceeded to grab himself a glass of water quickly before he left with the plate and glass in hand in kind of a hurry.
He'd always been somewhat of an attention seeker, which had to lead him to become an actual seeker. He didn't like sports. He'd never wanted to engage in such messy activities. However, as soon as his rival had entered, he'd felt a challenge. It had lured him in, and with some years of training, he'd actually gotten pretty good at it. This was why the idea of competing against Potter again was so exciting to him. It would spark things up, make things interesting again. He hated things being dull, there always had to be some sort of show going on in order for Malfoy to be happy.
The longer they stayed like this, the more used Draco got to it and the less he thought about it. In the end, he had almost sort of accepted it, because his mind had already wandered off to the next topic. He felt too lazy to be fussy about anything right now anyway.
The worst thing was that it had felt good, that he'd longed for it.
Malfoy was glad Potter liked the idea, and that he seemed to be willing to help him with it. It seemed like they were equally excited for it. "Great, great…" He said as he finished his tea. "I'll inform my friends, and the other Slytherins maybe. So if you could do the same with the Gryffindors, all we have to do is plan it out. Maybe find some people to help."
Luckily he had finished most of it. He could just write the last bit now and add it to the whole that was still in the hospital wing, with his other belongings. Harry grabbed the book and went back to the tables. Somehow it felt weird to sit at that same table without Malfoy, so he went to sit somewhere else. As he continued his writings, he managed to get stuck at some parts and with a groan circled them, knowing he would have to ask someone to help him.
"Mal, get- fuck that's cold. Get away from there or it might break," he said, hand still trying to fish all the last bits of ice out of his neck. His nose felt cold after that hit as well and he wouldn't be surprised if it was red because of it. That did not take away his worry though.
"I know it's bad, yet I can't find any reason to care…"
Malfoy nodded. "Well, there are a few things that have to be done. Like, when are we going to hold it, how late, who'll bring the food, the music, and maybe we could bring some other entertainments. I've heard Hufflepuff has a band, maybe they're willing to perform?" Maybe he was making the party too much of a big deal, but that's why he was a Slytherin. Go big or go home.
I'm not J.K Rowling and thus I don't own Harry Potter nor do I get paid for any of this.
Harry huffed at that reply. Wait for what, his heart to burst? Well, yes, wouldn't he just sleep peacefully then. Though he couldn't really do anything else, the other sounded quite drowsy already so it would be rude to keep him awake.
Even though he had gone through his own stuff with the war, Harry knew that he probably could never fully understand what the other had been through. Just like he wasn't that sure if he could manage to recall these memories to tell anyone about what had happened.
"Bloody hell?" he rasped, a mix of emotions dawning on him.
Draco had no clue, they hadn't exactly been friends before now, had they?
"Getting uncomfortably friendly, I see?" The blond boy responded, refraining from looking too surprised. Hiding behind disgust and irritation, his to-go escape plan. He and Potter weren't friends, where'd that idea even come from? Utterly stupid… right…?
Pansy let out a soft chuckle, patted his cheek with her hand and nodded.
I'm not J.K Rowling and thus I don't own Harry Potter nor do I get paid for any of this.
No need to worry. I'm fine. Sorry for just leaving without telling you. But let Mal explain.
Malfoy didn't complain and followed her into the hall. They sat there for a while, chatting and eating until Pansy told him she still had some homework to finish. Draco was left to his own devices again, which somehow resulted in him walking past the hospital wing. And by doing so, he spotted a familiar mop of black hair. Oh no Potter, you have not managed to get yourself back there again. Before he knew what he was doing, the blond strode into the infirmary, his coat and skates still dangling over his shoulder.
Now conscious of things like his heart rate, he shifted slightly to leave actually some space, no matter how little it was, between their bodies. "I think I'm in need of regular cuddle sessions," he stated. Now that wasn't all that much better as his other thought, was it now?
With his head still in his hands, Harry could feel his body practically freeze. He had come to that option as well beside the potion, but he had shoved it far back. Yet to hear Malfoy actually roll those words from his lips was unreal. He allowed himself to lift his head from the support of his palms to look at the boy next to him. Now that he had told him this, was he implying that Harry should find someone or some stuffed animal to sleep with, or was he proposing that he would stay next to him to help? He did say he… No, that is ridiculous to even think about. Malfoy and he were barely friends. Yet he couldn't help but chuckle.
"I mean, you don't look like you're very eager to eat anything at all," he corrected himself. "And I don't want you to faint because you've got me emotionally invested in you now. That makes you a victim of my care if you like it or not."
Taking a sip from his water he saw a mop of red hair enter his view and his priorities slipped. Placing the plate and glass to the side he jumped up to sprint towards his friend, leaving the blond without a word. "Ron! Ron, stop please."
"Like what?" he dared to ask.
Disclaimer:
"No specific violin pieces no, but I do know some songs with violin pieces in there or in which someone replaces an instrument like the piano with it..." he babbled on. Although he appreciated the sounds from musical instruments, Harry had never bothered to know the names of the pieces that were played. Just like now, he had enjoyed listening to the blond play, but that was about it. He had no idea what kind of piece it was.
Potter had said it was fine, but it wasn't and they both knew it. This was why he always took his time to think. This was why he was never impulsive, and always very composed. "I'm serious," he said just before they entered the great hall. "I say stupid things when I'm tired and grumpy and when I'm confused."
Draco hummed a 'yes', but then realized he had actually been dozing off. It was all just so warm and soft, how could he not fall asleep? However, he did understand why Harry hadn't fallen asleep yet, and why he couldn't. After all, this embrace thing was very unusual. His mind was probably spinning just as much as Draco's was.
"Not a fan of the cold though," he mumbled.
Hermione gave a hand signal to Ron to stay put in the opening as she walked towards them and Harry felt himself getting small - as if she was his mom coming to scold him. She took rather small steps at a casual pace, which made him even more fidgety. With another wave of her hand, this time between Harry and Malfoy, she finally spoke. "What is it with the sudden silent interaction between you two, if I may ask?"
The Slytherin nearly dropped his violin, but caught it in mid-air and clumsily held it, his eyes still set on the other. His secret was revealed now. This room wasn't his private space anymore. Someone had evaded the place only he could reach, which felt very surreal to him. Why wasn't Potter laughing yet? Or asking him what in the world was going on? He didn't even wear a bloody confused expression, he didn't look disapproving at all. What was up with that?
Harry frowned, not recalling having said that for a moment until he did. A short groan left him, short due that he cut himself off. "I let that slip huh…" Well, there was no denying that anymore, the other had heard him say it after all. Shrugging, as far as he could in this position, he tried to make it seem as not that big a deal he said that, while it actually really was. "Well, yeah. I do."
"Yeah, I got that," Draco softly replied as he carefully worked himself up a bit to clean some of the books and parchment away. Should he leave, or stay here? There was no reason for him to stay, now that studying wouldn't happen anyway, but did he want to leave?
"Then could we please just cuddle?" His question was mumbly and rushed, but Draco was sure Potter had heard him. He wasn't going to repeat himself anyway. Nervosity and embarrassment washed over him, consuming him all at once. There was no turning back now.
If they were in there, which he somehow doubted, he didn't want to disturb whatever what was going on there.
Harry went silent, his mouth left open as he stared at the other.
They lingered, taunting him from behind a wall of rules and standards. A wall that was now coated with a layer of sadness. Draco had reached a point where his pain had made him irrational. Where he couldn't think straight anymore because of his emotions. He was probably about to do something very stupid.
He hadn't made a big fuss yet about him and Potter falling asleep like that, so it had to be early.
The Slytherin walked to the sofa and put his stuff down. A few music sheets were already placed on the small table, probably containing his favorite pieces.
The request had put the other off. Draco sounded so serious about this. But why did he ask such a thing? Was he ashamed about his actions after all? Nah, no way. He had said it himself, he was not the kind of person to be affected by such trivial things. Something about Draco's posture and the look on his face was off though. "Is that all?" he simply asked. "I suppose it is," Draco replied, taking his hands off the chair he'd been leaning on and straightening up. There wasn't much else he could say about it.
As Draco got up, he noticed that his roommates were already up. This didn't surprise him, it wasn't even morning anymore. He quickly gathered some casual clothes, which were allowed during the weekends and which he was very grateful for because the dress shirts he owned were of much better quality than the hogwarts uniforms ones. He decided upon a dark grey one, and matched it with some black pants. He'd always thought dark tones suited him way better than the white dress shirt he had to wear for school.
Still feeling the other's lips on his even though they were apart, causing him to trace his lips with his tongue as to capture it.
And he didn't stop himself from walking away as soon as Potter scared him, because it was a good thing. He should walk away from him, he wasn't supposed to be his 'pall' or in this case, 'Mal'. Potter was forbidden fruit for someone like Draco, and he damn well knew that. He'd known it for a long time.
Harry hummed. "Sure, I was planning on heading back to the common room as well. Fireplaces make me feel relaxed or something, I don't know. There should be someone there who can explain what I'm reading as well."
A yawn escaped Harry as he laid in the embrace of the blonde. Honestly, he wanted to sleep, yet just the mere thought of the person he was cuddled up with and was actually returning the embrace was the very person he had started to grow attached to had him too awake to actually do so. It didn't seem as he could just slip away but that didn't matter. Lingering in the moment was a nice thing as well.
His previous thoughts had been forgotten as he embraced the other.
Draco assumed it had been his mother's wish to create the room but had never heard the full truth about why it was there. He simply loved it and was glad it existed. He was even more glad that Hogwarts had granted him the chance to revisit it when he wasn't at home.
"No," he stated, "you're garbage."
Harry hummed. "Ah, well forget about it then." If there had been no mention of what happened, maybe the war itself at all, it was not his place to say anything. Looking to the side he found the glass and with a soft puff, he decided to just take it down in one go. He was glad he did, 'cause it tasted horrible. "I thought it was over, yet it seems Pomfrey still belongs to the group that wants me gone. Merlin, what was in there?"
He noticed that Potter began to get fidgety after a while, and kind of retreated awkwardly. A hug wasn't supposed to last that long, even Draco knew that. It had just been kinda nice, and Potter hadn't pushed him away, so…
As Malfoy had mentioned that he had to do it for 'his friends', Harry shortly wondered whether the blond had forgotten about their talk last time, that they would be friends as well. However, as he continued Harry's eyes widened. He had never heard Malfoy talk like that. Not to mention that he felt as if he had been waiting for the other to say that. Yet that was ridiculous.
Maybe he should inform his friends about the party.
Draco nodded. "Yes, I'm not going to dwell on it. Seems like a waste of time." He didn't want to fight with Potter, he didn't want to lose the warm side of his attention.
Harry realized Malfoy was probably confused by his words, yet he was not planning on making it known that he may or may not be crushing on the Slytherin. Not that he was though.
Harry really seemed troubled. It annoyed Malfoy to only be able to watch, instead of making it go away. He simply didn't have a clue as to how he could get rid of the other's problems, due to a lack of experience and knowledge on this kind of subject. Of course, this was entirely his own fault, but still. It bugged him. And if something bugged a Slytherin, there was a guarantee that it would be crushed and gotten rid of eventually. He just needed to figure out how.
"Well, I never would've thought you would become keen on saving me. I guess I should risk my life more often then?" Draco grinned and dared to look over at the other for just a moment. He then resumed staring at anything but the Gryffindor. This is not the time for new feelings, don't start anything.
He wasn't sure what to say next. All he could think off, or rather, all the soft spots he knew from Potter, were a risky subject. He couldn't mock him with them and thus didn't. Instead, he sat down on the bed next to his and stretched. "I suppose all we can do is bicker, right?"
Pressing his hands, that were cold for some apparent reason, against his cheeks he hoped it would help him think of something, and as soon as he caught sight of the Hufflepuffs Malfoy's words replayed in his mind. In that instant, he stood up, told Malfoy to keep an eye on the list, and made his way towards the students he had spotted.
Harry breathed out and laughed softly, averting his eyes for a bit. "Well, yeah, obviously. Then... what was it?" he softly spoke.
Draco let out a frustrated sound and slapped his book shut. Why was he becoming so obsessed with the other? He thought it'd stop after he knew for sure what Potter felt for him, but that had only worsened it. The Gryffindor kept popping up in his mind at the worst times, accompanied by the most embarrassing thoughts. Draco was becoming a mess, even when he wasn't directly in front of the other. He really needed to sort things out, he needed to decide if he wanted to put his feelings away before they worsened. His mind and heart were fighting each other, leaving him confused and desperate for some rest. How was he ever going to figure this out…
"I can't stand that girl," she muttered, maybe more to herself than to Draco. As per usual, Draco took it as a comment directed towards him. No use muttering something if you didn't expect a response right? "What girl?" He asked.
Draco let out a relieved sigh. There was no way back now, but maybe he shouldn't care about that too much.
Harry looked off to the side to his red-haired friend. "I really appreciate your offer Ron, but I really don't want to intrude." Ron laughed. "You won't, and you know that. My mom loves you." Harry smiled at that. Yes, Harry had always felt like Mrs. Weasley truly liked him. It had made it easier for him to sit with the Weasleys.
Harry didn't really appreciate the tone of how the blonde spoke to him, but he guessed it could be worse. It was quite weird how he had the blonde help him instead of Hermione, though. But, what freaked him out more was that he finally understood what this stuff was all about. Draco explained it in such a natural way that it just clicked. Oh gosh, why didn't he have a Hermione who could just repeat this the same way?
Maybe Hermione could answer him on how to handle things with his feelings as well. She would only talk with him again when Ron and he made up. Though, Harry felt like he needed her help now as much as with the battle against Voldemort.
Hermione immediately came into action and moved towards her boyfriend.
Draco took some time to collect himself before he responded. He didn't want his voice to crack midway. "I'd like you to stay here, please." He couldn't be alone right now. It would destroy him. He would reduce to the ugly mess he'd been during his sixth year, the mess that had been sobbing in bathrooms and destroying himself over a heavy burden.
While he was curious about what happened and had made this sudden switch in Malfoy's emotional state, he found he had intruded on way too many fronts already. He couldn't possibly ask the other to just spill his beans to him every single time. Resisting the urge to ask, he just continued to try and comfort the other.
His hands found their way into the other's sweater, slipping over the warm skin that was underneath it.
"I get what you mean," he mumbled, his voice a lot less steady than he'd hoped.
He was wasting time with this childish behavior.
But Potter. He'd gone through a lot more than Draco had. Was that the reason for his nightmares? Draco looked up at the other but didn't voice the thought yet.
Pansy, sharp as she was, had noticed, however. She gave Draco a strange expression while ripping small pieces off her bread. "I'm still curious…" She said. "I know," Draco answered, not looking phased by her words at all. She was testing him, trying to get her answer by provoking him into emotional reactions. Smart, but Malfoy knew how to deal with this.
He wouldn't have thought that this would come from him staying over at Hogwarts over break with this rival-to-friend relation growing to this. Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would lay in his arms, showing Harry his fragile side like this?
Draco did hear him, but it took a while for him to fully register the words. He hated how he couldn't get himself to move, he had to get out of here. He took a deep, shaky breath, trying to unfreeze himself a bit. To Malfoy, it felt like it had taken ages before he finally kneeled down to crawl away from the weak spot. He knew that dividing your weight was a good thing to do, but thought it to be more efficient to crawl instead of roll.
With thoughts of winter and the sounds of the lake he was currently under in the background, he closed his eyes and finally got some rest. The last few days had been quite hectic.
For a while, he wasn't sure how to react. He just kind of stood there, unable to move. Then it dawned on him, and functioning became even harder.
Oh, they were really testing his patience right now. How lucky they were that he'd grown up suppressing his signs of annoyance and anger. "As I said, he's not in his right mind. I didn't do anything. If it weren't for me, he'd be laying on the floor in this library right now. But he's your friend right? I don't care what you do with this information, believe it or not. Wouldn't hurt to take a look in the hospital wing, but if you insist on thinking I'm a liar, which I am absolutely not because I wouldn't lower myself to that level, I won't hold you back."
Surely, he didn't know the Slytherin all that well, but to think the guy played the violin had never occurred to him. Neither did he think he would be so hypnotized by it and pulled in.
He took one of the sheets out, took out his wand, and made it fly up in the air so that he could look at it as he played. He still felt a bit awkward, playing like this in front of someone else, but his Slytherin pride told him to get over himself and show the other that he was a brilliant violinist.
As the door formed, he hadn't expected someone else to be inside already. Neither did he expect such a calm room, filled with harmony and a rather content Draco Malfoy who seemed lost in his own world. He felt like he intruded on something, yet he couldn't tear himself away from the spot, even when something in him had registered that he should maybe close that door behind him.
After a quick meal, he left the great hall again and went to his dormitory to get ready for the day. He wasn't sure what to do after that, but he'd decide that then.
Obviously, they had been informed of his cold and how he had, once again, managed to get himself in the hospital wing.
Rather now, he felt as if he had gone back to the Dursleys. Cold, holding back and acting as if he was alright.
He desperately wanted the other to stay but wasn't even sure why. All he knew was that being left here alone was a scary idea.
Harry flung his arm around the other and nuzzled into the other. His chest resting somewhere around the other's belly and chest. "You asked for it," he threw back, making himself comfortable. He paid no heed to the rapid beat of his heart. Deal with it.
Would people start wondering where they'd gone off to? Had they missed dinner yet?
There was a moment when Draco looked up at the other. Things had been moving fast, but suddenly everything stopped.
