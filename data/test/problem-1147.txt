'It's probably the fact that you're used to tracking things,' Malfoy said, not meeting his eyes. 'You'd be used to looking for signs that other people miss.'
Malfoy looked at him, gaze considering, as though looking deeper within him, trying to catch his thoughts.
Harry was in the shed when Ginny arrived on Saturday. He had the morning off before he headed in for a night shift. They'd made no further progress on the case, despite having sent investigators to Bright's workplace - he was a lorry driver, singularly unhelpful - and having tracked down friends and family members. All they'd been able to get was that he tended to keep to himself, and no one had any idea he'd been planning something so horrific. The Muggle Police were conducting their own less-strenuous investigation, checking CCTV and tracking Bright's movements in the past week, but the Muggle Law Liaison Officer had reported they'd turned up nothing of use either. In the absence of the removed photographs, they were close to ruling it an accident.
Harry's name spilled from Draco's lips without thought, as Harry continued to move. Harry moaned at the sound and cupped Draco's face, looking into his eyes.
Malfoy paused for a moment, his finger moving to hold his place on the page. Harry noticed his cheeks were slightly flushed and he wondered, for the first time, just how Malfoy experienced the dreams. Had he just come too? The thought sent a curl of heat through Harry and he caught his breath.
Malfoy's cheeks reddened slightly. Harry wondered why he'd never noticed in school how expressive Malfoy was. He wore his emotions all over himself, if you were close enough to see.
He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to focus on controlling his breathing, bringing his heart rate back down. It wasn't real. None of it was real. They'd escaped the Fiendfyre. They were alive.
'Perhaps I just like the colour,' he replied. 'If you prefer we change rooms, we can abandon what I have planned for you tonight.'
Harry stopped at his words, trying to get his growing arousal under control enough to think. A part of him wanted to fall onto the couch with Draco and ride him until they both came, and then to do it all over again. Another part of him wanted - very badly - for Draco to take control, and to pull Harry to pieces.
Harry thought about the Muggle man as he walked away. He felt that same tugging sensation in his chest. It had been a long time since anyone had offered him ... that. He'd long ago made it clear to the legions of fans and potential matches that he'd made his choice and was perfectly happy. The slim lines of the man's body and the clear interest in his eyes ghosted through Harry's mind again. He'd been fit. Harry could admit that. And it wasn't like he'd never
So Robards had sacked him and Harry had sat there and listened to the fear and disgust layered underneath the words. Robards had lost his wife to a were, after all. And Harry would never be able to forget what he had lost to the wolves so many years before.
He'd done some research earlier that day into Malfoy's pardon as well - the idea that he was out for good behaviour was ludicrous. Malfoy wouldn't know good behaviour if it bit him on the arse. No, Harry would be willing to bet the Malfoy fortune had a lot more to do with it. That idea just made him even angrier - the thought that people like the Malfoys could buy their way out of - or into - whatever they wanted. People had to pay for their crimes - had to pay with something meaningful, not just pull money from an inexhaustible supply.
They get a short way down the street before Malfoy steps into a dark gap between two buildings, then he moves closer to Harry and puts a hand on his arm. Without warning, Harry feels the sickening hook of Apparition tug at his guts.
'If you two have finished pissing on each other, might we look at the menu?' Malfoy says, exasperation in his voice, tinged with something heavier. Harry wonders, suddenly, if Malfoy
Harry nodded again and Draco leaned forward over Scorpius' head, cupping Harry's cheek with one hand as he pulled him into a kiss that ached with tenderness.
'Yes,' he said, voice thick with want, 'I'll say what you need me to say.' He stood abruptly, shrugging out of his own suit jacket and pulling at his tie with fumbling fingers.
' Harry asked again, tone harder this time. He didn't want to be drawn into this. Didn't want to be a part of this madness.
Harry was pushing back against him, clearly wanting it. He was naked and his body was hard and lean. His head was buried in the crook of one shoulder.
'I achieved what I needed to. Fared better than I expected, actually, and decided I'd head back here to see my favourite people in all the world,' he said, squeezing Scorpius and making him giggle.
Draco ignored Potter's self-correction as he tried to separate the person in front of him from Charlie's memory. Drawing attention to the dissonance never worked well. He always found he got better results with letting people sink into the pretence. He reached down to unlace his own boots, kicking the clumsy things off with a feeling of relief. He joined Potter on the couch, twisting to face him and bringing one leg up under the other, sitting the way Charlie had in so many of Potter's memories, as he thought about how he wanted to start the conversation.
He frowns slightly, leaning forward and flaring his nostrils subtly. Act normal. Be normal. He gets another breath of it and his frown deepens. There's something familiar about the way the man in front of him smells. Something that tugs at the edges of his memory, the same way his voice had.
dulling for a moment as he does so. His sharp features come back into view, his eyes shining silver in the light of his wand.
He hands Harry a brochure and he reads the words 'Dover Castle: Wartime tunnels.' He looks at the picture on the cover and feels excitement flood through him. Beside him, Malfoy stiffens slightly and Harry knows. This is it.
'Of course,' Ron says, turning to gesture through the still open gap in the desk. 'This way, please.'
Harry came back to his office for lunch. He normally had it on the run between meetings, but the last few days he'd made the time to sit with Draco and eat. He figured it was the least he could do - the man was bringing him amazing food each day.
'Maybe not,' Parkinson said, standing and looking down at him. 'But the choice of what it changes or doesn't change is up to you. And Draco - Merlin take him - wants it that way.'
'This is a Muggle club, as I believe you would call it. We do, however, get the occasional one of your kind passing through. Please indicate your status on the forms if you choose to return them. We will make sure you are appropriately matched based on your … other abilities.'
Harry sank back into the beanbag and tried not to feel humiliated despite the fact that he hadn't wanted to kiss Nott anyway. He didn't look at Malfoy. He didn't want to see the look on his face.
Harry threw shield charms as well, trying to wrap them around those who were running. It made a difference for those he touched, but there were so many of them, moving so quickly, and it was only a minute or two before the attackers noticed the jets of red light raining down from above and the way their flames and curses were being turned away. One by one, heads turned to his location and then Harry was forced to throw up a shield around himself as a fireball came hurtling back up at him. It burst against his shield, curling back on itself.
'You have the touch of death on you,' she said, holding the hand that had touched him against her chest. A trace of fear came into her eyes for the first time since he'd been on site.
Banks is on the front desk when Harry steps out of the lift and Harry approaches her with a smile that he doesn't have to fake. She'd been one of his favourite Aurors, one of those people that could diffuse a room with a few well-placed words. She'd been a brilliant part of his team. He realises, as she smiles back at him, the gesture slightly forced, that he hasn't seen her since his so-called resignation. Guilt tugs at him, and he knows what it must have looked like, him upping and leaving without a word to anyone afterwards.
'He caused the first rising,' they said to Mac, gesturing at Harry and making a shooing motion towards the chair. 'Did you know that?' They turned to Harry next. 'You caused the first rising. You won't be doing that again. Not under my watch.'
She tilted her head to the toaster. Propped up against it was a letter. He rushed forward, snatching it up.
Harry shook his head and Draco smiled sadly. 'It was you.' His shoulder lifted in a half shrug. 'I couldn't trust my father to keep us safe any more. I never trusted Dumbledore to help me. I couldn't trust my mother to protect me. I couldn't even trust myself not to make the wrong choices,' he said bitterly, running his hand over the mark inked onto his arm.
Ron was at his desk, also minus his heavy work robes, and Hermione arrived a few minutes after Harry did, her hair a frizzy halo around her head. Ron gave Harry a quick shake of his head when he opened his mouth to say something and Harry bit back his grin.
The moment Ladon led him into one of the smaller side rooms and the door closed behind them, Harry pushed Ladon up against the wall, glaring into his face.
'How was your day?' he asks instead, and Hermione launches into a detailed discussion of the meeting she's had with members of MACUSA and the Bulgarian Ministry of Magic.
The next few days passed in a blur. They located Euphemia Rowle and Geoffrey Selwyn and brought both in for questioning, but neither seemed to have anything remotely connected to the case to offer. Since they hadn’t actively been accused of anything, Harry's team wasn't able to question them under Veritaserum or Legilimency. He considered petitioning the Minister, but knew the laws would be upheld. They'd been put in place after Voldemort had turned the Ministry into a blunt force for trauma and torture.  He knew why they were needed, and wouldn't change them, not really. But it made his job bloody hard sometimes.
Harry thinks for a moment, but only two ideas come to him, and neither are ideal. 'Hogwarts is out,' he says. 'I can't think of a single reason McGonagall would let us in without asking questions. We'll have to use a Ministry one.'
The movement presses against Harry's cock, which he realises is half hard. He rumbles his satisfaction and licks at the skin again, before sucking at it as he gives a little hum of pleasure.
But Malfoy seemed ignore his words, continuing to speak. 'The Boy-Who-Lived would continue to be the boy who lived for everyone else. You've always been a bit like that, haven't you, Potter? Ever since the beginning.'
He throws back his drink and moves back to the sink, banging the cup down on the bench with more force than is necessary.
'Harry,' Malfoy says and Harry's fingers twitch at the use of his first name. What right does Malfoy have? 'I'm not like that—not one of them.'
'Right,' Ron said, mopping his forehead with a towel. He gave them an overly bright smile. 'The roof?'
As soon as he's done he reaches for Draco's arm. A crack of movement and they blink into a huge, dimly lit room. It's lavishly appointed, all glittering gold, silk, and brocade. There are chaise lounges dotted throughout, a raised dais in one corner and a well-appointed bar in another. Harry glances around, senses on high alert for any immediate threat, but none of the room's occupants pay them any attention.
Draco's smile deepened and he let his eyes flick over Harry briefly, that same heat in his gaze. 'You too,' he murmured, then rubbed one hand over the other, as though running his fingers over the touch of Harry's magic.
He'd forgotten how much of a rabbit warren the Ministry was, and it was becoming an increasingly windy one. The wind had gone from occasional gusts to a strong, steady blow. Every room Harry entered, it came at him from a different direction. He looked around at the people at their desks and saw increasing looks of frustration, annoyance and outright anger. The baking heat had cooled right off but the wind was unrelenting. Sticking charms didn't seem to be making much difference and the more the day wore on, the more the Ministry was starting to look like the site of a disaster. Paperwork, plants and even furniture in some instances were blown across rooms and into corridors.
' Harry said, voice shocked as he took in the appearance of the man before him. It was definitely Malfoy, face framed by the black hood, but he looked older, sharper somehow ... and just a little bit frantic. Harry pushed Malfoy's hood back, somehow needing to make sure he really was there - unable to understand how it could be Malfoy he was confronting after all these years. It revealed the same pale hair Harry remembered, but frizzed around his head as though Malfoy had been standing in the middle of the wind storm the Ministry had become. He looked far less together than Harry had seen him in a long time. Abruptly, an image of Malfoy stumbling off Harry's broom and collapsing to the ground, streaked with soot, flashed across his mind. Harry grimaced at the memory he hadn't thought of in a long time and let go of Malfoy, taking a few steps back.
'You need to get ready for the funeral,' Ron said and Harry felt the word like a blow. He realised for the first time that Ron was wearing his best black robes, the ones he'd married Hermione in. Harry stared at them, like they were a betrayal.
'This is where they started to plan it, I think,' Draco said, leaning back in his chair. 'See the references to being unseen and unheard, to seeking and to those who are accepting?'
'I met another wolf, tonight,' he says and Bill's eyes widen in concern. 'And—' Harry hesitates, but he knows this is a family tempered by grief, knows Bill can help him bear it. 'And I just—' he takes a deep breath, 'I just talked about Teddy and it all feels very real right now, and
'Being the whole thing is overwhelming,' Draco says. He turns so he's facing Harry, one leg up on the stone wall.
Three more left the circle - Lavender refused to kiss Malfoy and Parvati refused to kiss Parkinson. When Hermione's spin went to Parkinson as well, Harry started to suspect she had concealed her wand somewhere and was using it to rig the game so she could force people out.
When they landed two hours later, Harry was breathless and pleasantly sore from the exertion and laughter. They'd chased each other as much as the snitch, each one showing off in more and more outlandish ways, until Draco had fallen, and only Harry's quick dive had saved him from hitting the ground at high speed. They'd agreed to call it a day from there and were walking back to the change rooms, shoulders bumping together as they discussed Snape's potions project.
Draco was shoved inside and he looked around the small, brightly lit room. A table sat in the center, with a chair on either side. The walls were a light grey, one of them glass.
Harry couldn't be here anymore. He had to get out. He had to get away from Malfoy and his games - his lies. He had to try and get to a place where he wasn't falling into a million pieces. He could feel all the parts of him that had stitched together in the last few months flying away again -  making him feel as though he would never be whole.
Harry considers arguing with him, forcing his attention back up from what is in front of him, but he still feels sore and tired from the night before and from the resurgence of his anger the moment he was back in Malfoy's presence.
Draco had barely walked in the door of Release when he got the owl from Harry. It was the same as always, a request to meet, but this time, something was different. The handwriting was more rushed than usual, cramped, as though Harry had been tense while writing it.
Harry opened his mouth to point him out and then paused, something in him cautioning him against making that connection public. He took a deep breath in, hand shaking as his heart started to beat faster. He could feel tension running through his body, and suddenly, he desperately wanted a smoke. He crossed his arms over his chest to hide the tremor in his hands.
Draco opened the button of his trousers with shaking hands. He unzipped his fly and reached in, pulling his cock out, groaning as he gave it a quick stroke. He only meant to touch himself as he watched, but his eyes were drawn back to Harry's arse and how good it looked.
It opened a moment later and there was a sudden hush as Lucius Malfoy was led through. A second later angry whispers broke out and there were mutterings around the room. Marchbanks let it go on for a second before she banged a gravel hard on the podium. The sound cut off immediately. Harry didn't look up at the noise. He was watching Draco, whose eyes were fixed unblinkingly on his father as he was led into the court.
Malfoy leans forward and tells the driver an address in Whitechapel which leaves Harry none the wiser, then he pulls a mobile phone out of his pocket and taps away at it, a slight frown on his face.
'Scorp' nodded his head eagerly, and then leaned forward, 'Are you Harry Potter? Teddy told me heaps about you. Did you really beat my papa at Quidditch?'
Malfoy sucked back harder, tongue swirling as he worked his hand up and down Harry's cock in time with his mouth.
But when he opens the door, Bill is standing there, and Harry realises he must have still been up and had heard the crack of his arrival.
Everything looked different in the daylight. The street was quieter, though the building looked just as impressive and imposing as Harry approached it. He realized with a twinge that, it being a Sunday morning, they may not be open and, being a Muggle establishment, he had no legal basis to push his way in. He ignored the small voice whispering in the back of his mind, that even if it had been a wizarding business, he would still require proper justification … if he was even allowed to perform the visit himself.
Draco held out his hand and Harry took it, with just a hint of hesitation, as though he were telling himself he shouldn't.
'Hmm?' Draco asked, looking down at Harry, his fingers stilling momentarily before they began stroking through Harry's hair again.
, small concrete houses and shops, little front yards. There weren't many people about, but he could see curtains twitch as he passed, and he knew people were watching.
'I just had to help my friend with something,' he said, hoping Scorpius wouldn't register the hint of a shake in his voice.
'Lucius Malfoy, you are under arrest for the murder of David Bright, Jacob Summers and Cordelia Avery. A number of other charges will be brought against you. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be brought against you in trial.'
Marchbanks watched him a moment, then looked back down at the papers in front of her. 'Your evidence consists of traces of magical residue found on the body of the second Muggle attacker and a series of letters between Lucius Malfoy and an unknown correspondent known as 'The Heir'?'
He wondered if what Hermione said could be right, if he was still the Master of Death. If he'd just buried the possibility of it inside layer upon layer of rejection and self-doubt and guilt.
Harry's hands were moving before she'd even finished speaking and he sighed in relief as the familiar distortion to his vision fell into place and the cloak enveloped him once more. He let his shoulders uncurl slightly.
'Sure,' he nodded. 'Thanks.' Malfoy opened the fridge and bent to pull out a bottle of wine. Harry let his eyes linger, just for a moment, on the curve of Malfoy's arse, clearly outlined by the thin material of his joggers, before he forced himself to look away.
Malfoy finishes the last of his drink and sighs. 'Sometimes, the parents don't even report it. Some of the pureblood families hide Squibs. They've grieved the children, from what I can tell, but the scandal of the investigation of a Squib child missing from their family is just one step too far.'
Pheo hissed her displeasure at him, clearly disagreeing, but a moment later she was sliding down his arm and spilling onto the table in her eagerness. Harry felt something warm inside him when he saw what Malfoy was laying out on the table.
Hermione had always been better at this sort of thing than he was. For a moment he felt a fierce stab of longing for her. He imagined being able to lean on her, to share this burden with her. He forced himself not to think of Hermione. She had no place here.
'The whole Weasley-Granger extended family is in Romania this year,' he says, taking another deep drink, draining half his glass. I don't watch the way his throat works as he swallows.
'I've shut the - what did you call it? The Dream Room,' Malfoy said, as he took a step back and leaned against the sink. 'None of my customers will be back short term. Maybe long term, depending on how long your friends hang about.'
'Are you still flying?' Draco asked, though he knew the answer, had seen it in Healer Jeffries' report. Potter hadn't been doing anything for months now, anything but existing.
Draco understood the topic was off limits, but there was something in him that needed to push just a little bit further. Something that wouldn't allow him to experience what he and Harry had just shared and not try, one last time, to see if he could reset their past.
Draco's hair was mess, as though he hadn't bothered styling it. He was wearing a faded old t-shirt and an oversize pair of joggers that pooled at his ankles and had holes in the heel. His movements were slow and his shoulders were slumped. It was a marked contrast from his appearance at the aquarium the day before, where he'd looked fit and happy.
Harry looks down at the map again, mind racing as he considers and discards ideas. If he was still at the Ministry, he'd put surveillance on each of the sites and send someone in undercover to verify the child was present before they busted the whole thing open. He grits his teeth as he considers again how hamstrung they are, operating alone.
He'd been so focused on chasing his own pleasure he hadn’t noticed, but Ginny was usually more vocal. He usually concentrated on her, making sure he held off until she - Harry rolled off her and cast the cleaning charm, too tired to do more than take her at her word.
Harry's house was a tomb. He spent as little time inside it as he could. James had been gone for thirty-five days but Harry still saw him in every room. He and Ginny hadn't talked about what to do with his things. His highchair was still pulled up to the table. The colourful mat they'd laid over the floor in the living room, during his spewy crawling phase hit Harry like a punch in the guts every time he walked into the room.
Harry looked down into the empty cot and felt the aching loss of his child through every part of his body.
'He remembers his mother's love,' Draco said suddenly, 'I show him memories of her all the time.' Instantly he regretted the words, as he saw her eyes fill with sympathy and she reached out to hold his hands gently.
like Davies, it smells like Draco and that is enough to keep his wolf happy. Strangely enough, he can still feel Davies' wolf inside the body Draco is now wearing, as though a ghost of it is stirring. It's unsettling and Harry tries not to think about it.
Malfoy knocks and Harry sees the door open after a moment. He focuses, trying to make out the person inside, but they're in shadow and all he can tell is that it seems to be an older man, perhaps in his fifties, about Malfoy's height. He hears a greeting, the door closes a second later and both sights and sounds are gone.
Across the office, Draco snorted. 'It's just leftovers, Potter. You'd think you'd never been fed before, the way you carry on.'
.' Harry felt the burn of tears in his throat again and this time he couldn't hold them back. He felt the sob rip through him and he fisted his hands in Ron's robes as he felt himself crack open again.
Harry's about to turn and make some comment to Malfoy. He doesn't know what. Maybe something about how if he wasn't such a bastard he might get laid once in a while, when Malfoy stands, gathering his work together, and shrinking it down as he moves to his room with a muttered goodnight.
Malfoy laughed quietly, then smiled. 'He's wonderful.' His whole demeanor softened when he thought about his child, Harry realised, ignoring the twinge in his chest this thought gave him.
Ginny walked in the door and stopped dead, looking around with eyes that widened as she took in the sketches, pages torn from books, scribbles of notes and theories. They were tacked to the walls and spread over the floor and bed he was sitting on.
. But he kept his mouth closed, refusing to give anyone in the room the satisfaction of seeing him lose his temper.
No, this was not Astoria in the bed he'd shared with her for the entirety of their marriage, but that was okay. Somehow he thought she'd be happy that he'd finally found someone to share himself with.
'Harry Potter,' he repeated, happy to allow the Veritaserum to pull that from him, and glad he hadn't given a fake identity a few minutes earlier.
He woke to the smell of bacon cooking, and golden light flowing in from his bedroom window. He stretched and looked across at his clock. It was eight in the morning. Harry groaned and considered stuffing his head back under his pillow, but there was something niggling in his mind, something his mum had said, the night before, before he'd gone to sleep.
He gasped and then closed his eyes and kissed Ladon harder as he felt the other hand slide down his back to cup his arse, squeezing tightly.
'Indeed,' Davies says with a grin that broadens into a leer as he leans forward as well. 'Our Head of Operations asked me to bring you to them personally to verify the product. We would also like to inspect yours, of course. We can't flood the market with faulty goods.'
He had no idea how long it was before he latched onto it, but when he did, he knew that he had found what he was seeking. There was a hint of something wrong inside the creature, something purposeful and ugly, something beyond the animal thoughts of eat and reproduce.
Potter shook his head. 'Can't,' he said, leaning his head against the back of the couch and closing his eyes. 'I see you—him—everywhere.'
'Why are you doing this?' Malfoy said suddenly, breaking into Harry's musings. His question so closely mirrored the direction Harry's thoughts had been going, he wondered for a second if Malfoy was using Occlumency on him. He shook the thought off.
Harry's wide-eyed assessment was arrested by a slim figure in an elaborate silver jacket, over a sky blue waistcoat and much more sensible puffy shorts than he had on. The man came closer, familiar eyes fixing Harry from behind a black mask which peaked into a hint of horns.
Harry groaned as he skated a finger over his rim, feeling the furl of his hole. He concentrated and his fingers were suddenly wet. He arched his back to give himself a better reach and then groaned again, as he pushed lightly at his rim, before moving his finger away. He did it again and again, a light pressure, barely entering, barely giving him what he wanted.
Potter rejected him, he reminded himself with a grimace, time and again. Potter could have spoken for him at his trial. Potter could have given him a hand out of the darkness when he was finally released from the hell pit known as Azkaban. Potter could have done
. It was unnatural. He had this way of walking where he didn't meet anyone's eye and sort of faded into the background. He reminded Harry again of what it was like to hunt a Demiguise, as though Malfoy would disappear if Harry took his eyes off him for more than a moment.
Harry reached for a bottle of whisky in the saddlebags behind him. It was barely nine in the morning, but he didn't care. He took a swig and rinsed his mouth out, then spit it, before he tilted his head back and took another deep swallow, letting the burn help to ground him in the present.
She bustled off and Harry followed her, sinking into the chair at the kitchen table with a sigh. Molly busied herself for a moment at the kettle and then floated a cup of tea over to him, followed by a slice of what Harry realised must have been the cake from last night. He felt the sting of guilt run through him again - he was a right shit.
Harry was tired the next morning, but feeling more energised than he had in days. He'd stayed past midnight at Draco's house, talking through ideas and angles with him. They'd talked about pureblood traditions and society and the way things had changed in the last few years. The conversation had been quick, each of them jumping in with ideas and questions. Harry had been impressed by Draco's depth of knowledge, not just about his own family's background, but about many of the other families and what stances they'd taken on certain political issues over time.
Marchbanks flicked through the pages again. 'You have identified however, that this evidence may have been tampered with? This is the reason for including former Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, as a suspect to be questioned?'
Draco looked up and caught him staring. His eyes tightened. 'It's hot in here,' he said. 'I'll cover it, if it bothers you.'
Going back would be stupid. He tried to think as he rode, to make what he'd seen make sense to him. His memories of the bodies flashed in front of his eyes. Jakub's, blood everywhere; vivid and bright in his mind. Then it merged into James' body on the floor, so small and so much blood. He shook his head, trying to clear his mind, only to see Daniela, face stretched in silent agony. He could hear James' cries again. His desperate need for help.
Re-entering the storm was like flying through the ocean. The clouds crashed and roiled around him, throwing him through the air. There was an almost constant surge of lightning, blast after blast ripping the air apart. The thunder boomed through his body like it was a part of him.
'How often does he visit?' he asked, ignoring the slight stiffening in Murphy's posture at the fact that he'd gone totally off script. They knew how often. There was no reason for Harry to ask what he was asking. But what they didn't know, was why.
He'd just slipped the file back in the drawer and moved away when Barclay returned, looking surprised to see him.
Pheo tightened her grip around the leather necklace Harry wore when he flew with her and he buttoned up the neck of his coat again, before he lay the case out on the ground and spoke the words that would release the flock.
Jakub watched him for a moment longer, eyes shining in the low light, and then he blinked and shuffled in his jacket pockets, patting himself down. At his movement Harry felt the tension in the air, tension he hadn't even realised had grown, break. And it was back to him and Jakub, the old man who lived in the park and dealt drugs to him every Thursday.
Sue passed him notes occasionally, reinforcing the things that Elders, the Ministry's prosecution lawyer, was saying.
Harry reached blindly into the Mokeskin pouch at his side, hands shaking as he fumbled with the strings. He felt around until he found what he wanted, pulling Paddington out of the bag and holding the bear up to his face. He breathed in the scent of it and tried to convince himself that what he could smell was James, the baby warmth of him.
'No,' he said, his voice a cracked whisper as it travelled the distance between them. 'No. You don't have to stop.'
He felt his mood sour further. What the fuck was Malfoy doing with this photo, still? How dare he pretend that any of it had mattered?
'Seriously?' came a cry from the gate and Harry glanced across to see Ron approaching. 'You've been here less than one minute. I timed it. You've been on the ground for thirty-six seconds, mate,' he said as he pulled Harry into a hug. Harry laughed, returning the embrace.
Harry woke, sitting bolt upright and gasping. He reached up to feel for his hood and pull it closer, only to realise it had come off in his sleep. He must have knocked it off with his tossing and turning. He pulled it around himself and curled his knees up to his chest as he tried to swallow the bile and stop himself from shaking.
He feels the wolf's savage glee at his failure. It won't be denied. Not anymore. It knows what it wants and it's so close to freedom. Harry can taste its rage and its burning need to shift. To run. To tear and rip and kill.
Potter picked up the broom engraved with Charlie's initials and handed it to Draco with a smile that was almost shy. Draco took it with a big, happy grin of his own and gestured out the back door. Potter turned to it, his smile dimming again as he put his hand on the handle. Draco knew what was going through Potter's mind. He was remembering that he was in an apartment in London, that there was nothing beyond the door. Potter was remembering that this was all fake and he was only here for his own good, so he could learn to move on.
Granger shook her head. 'He told me about Ladon, yes, but I only just connected the dots. I've been doing some research into BDSM and into the man Harry said he'd been meeting with.' She raised an eyebrow at him. 'Ladon? Really. You thought a name that literally means 'Dragon of Hera' was a subtle way of hiding your identity?'
'Why'd you do it, Malfoy?' Harry said, taking a step into the room. 'Are you working with someone? Is this part of a plan to disrupt the Ministry?'
Harry froze as Malfoy's eyes moved over him and then caught on the shimmer of movement that his charm gave off.
'Couldn't hurt,' he said, as he dug his thumb into the arch of Draco's foot, rubbing a firm stroke back up it.
'You'll be fine,' he said, cupping Draco's cheek with one hand as he rested their foreheads together for a moment. 'Just don't let anything he says get under your skin.'
'We want to try something,' she said, not bothering with a greeting. 'Come down to level nine when you're done here.'
'I'm sure, dear,' she said, patting him on the arm. 'But there's just something about a mother's love -'
. But he remembers plaster torn from walls, mirrors smashed, his hand around Ron's throat when he'd tried to force Harry out of his house one night a few months in. Feral had been a good word for him, before Ron and Hermione had come back. Before he'd recognised the Burrow as a safe place. Before he'd started to come to terms with the fact that his family would be there for him, would help him manage what he was now.
Draco's eyes open, Markwell's dark ones meeting his, and the look on his face is conflicted. He opens his mouth to say something and then closes it again and looks down, shame spiking in his scent.
On the other side were the names of Aurors who'd died under his watch. Every time he went to get a new name added to the list, he considered asking the tattooist to ink his name there too.
'I ran a diagnostic on your paperwork after I realized you were luring unsuspecting victims to your club.'
'You've lived with the Hallows for years with no issues,' Draco said. 'If we can unlink you from time, you should be fine, provided you don't draw on their power again.'
Harry sucks in a breath at the boy's name. An image of his face flashes across his mind for an instant. A happy smile, green eyes, just like his. He closes his eyes against the pain of it.
Harry forces himself not to rise to the taunt and lifts the glass, uncapping it. He lets two drops hit his tongue and then passes it to Malfoy. He can feel it running through his body already, the truths rising to the surface, bubbling to get out. He bites his cheek. He's been trained for this. He'll be fine.
Harry felt his anger begin to stir, fighting through the rush of information he was seeing and hearing. Where did these people get off, judging him? He hadn't released the Horseman on purpose. No one had been there holding his hand and telling him what he should or shouldn't be doing. He'd done the best he bloody well could.
. The room reeks of it. He can smell sweat as well, and semen, both fresh with a sharp, bitter tang, and old, crusted and dead. There's anger in the room. Sadness. Disgust. It hits him at once, all of it, and it's all he can do to keep standing.
When it was over, he opened his eyes and looked at his new self in the mirror. Staring back at him was a middle-aged man with watery blue eyes, a receding hairline, a paunch, and a permanently disaffected look on his face. Harry could never remember if that was the man's expression or just the one he wore when he had to wear this body. He scowled at his reflection.
'Are you okay?' came his mum's voice from down below, and Harry winced at the concern in her voice. It wasn't like he fell out of bed all the time. Only sometimes. Well maybe a few times a week. But it was only that one time he'd fallen down the stairs. He rushed down them now, in his burgundy pj's. Dad had bought them for him a few years ago. Mum had rolled her eyes and said they should just wait and see, and not to put pressure on him, but Dad had hugged him close and said he knew a Gryffindor when he saw one.
He pulls his mouth away from Draco's and nudges his head out of the way so he can get to the tender skin of his neck. He sucks at it, hard, before biting down. Draco lets out a cry of pure want and arches against Harry, fingers tightening in his hair and pulling him closer.
'I found out he's been lying about a number of things,' he said at last. 'I have no reason to assume the information he's given us about the case isn't bullshit too.'
now, or your wolf, at any rate. I asked Weasley how he did the ones at Grimmauld Place and replicated that.'
'What film?' I ask, unsure as I do so just why I'm entertaining the thought, except that a part of me wants to, and it's been so long since I've done something I want to. 'It better not be a shit one.'
'Is that what's in the notes you're always writing?' Harry asks and Malfoy hesitates for a moment, then nods.
you could do is rest for a day. You should be dead,' Malfoy says, and his voice leaves no room for argument. 'Jimsonweed is incredibly toxic. It leads to fever, hallucinations and heart failure within an hour, two tops. People don't just fight that off.'
'Tonight,' Dean said, interrupting Harry's thoughts, 'we're going to play a fun little Muggle game called 'Spin the Bottle'.' There were one or two gasps from around the circle from people who had clearly heard of the game before. The rest just watched Dean as he placed an empty butterbeer bottle in the centre of the circle.
When they're standing naked in front of each other, Draco's fingers drop to Harry's hip, tracing the scar tissue softly. Harry shivers under his touch. No one but him has touched the bite since the Healers first assessed it. He doesn't try and stop the gentle exploration. It feels nice to have this part of him known as well.
Malfoy returned smoothly to his seat, reaching for the bottle and taking another sip. He blew the smoke up into the air as, just for a moment, his grey eyes flicked over Harry. Harry tried to ignore the jolt of excitement that look sent through him. It was just a reaction to seeing two people kiss. Two objectively attractive people.
Draco heard the door open behind him but he didn’t turn around, expecting it to be Pansy. Instead, he felt strong arms encircle him from behind. Blaise.
'It's simple,' he said, looking around at the assembled faces with a grin. 'You spin, and kiss whoever the bottle points to. Each round we'll up the stakes. Kisses must be at least five seconds in round one, or you're out. Round two will have tongue. Round three will be full body alignment. Round four - well, let's just see who makes it that far,' he grinned.
The three of them sat together, looking up at the two phoenixes flying together through the darkness.
'I was raised in a cupboard,' Harry said flippantly, then snapped his mouth shut as Malfoy turned his head sharply to fix him with piercing grey eyes.
Mac's face didn't change. 'This is Blake,' she said to Harry. 'They'll be seeing to your education. You'll be put into play when they judge that you have sufficient knowledge. Someone will be by later to show you to your room. Have you eaten?'
Ron took a step forward and reached out as he said, 'What are you talking about, mate? You have nothing to -'
. He can see an aching rawness in Malfoy's eyes, a trauma he's not yet healed from and he feels a strange relief, to know that maybe what Malfoy shows him is something true; something that he doesn't show to anyone else.
'What do you do now?' Harry asked, not wanting to make him uncomfortable, but needing to know, one way or another.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts as Jeffries stood and the case board changed. Harry glanced over the information displayed, and then focussed his attention on Jeffries when he figured out there was nothing new. Hell, he probably knew the information up there better than anyone in the room, Jeffries included.
'I- what?' Harry said, flat footed, the 'don’t worry about it’ he'd been about to give dying on his lips.
'Want to take this discussion elsewhere?' Davies says, as he finishes his meal. 'Leave your pet behind?'
Maybe the magic of the cloak responded to the wearer's need. No one knew much about it. Dumbledore himself had been studying it to find out more about it, all those years ago. Whatever the reason, Harry wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. The cloak had only helped him, his whole life until now. He had to assume the same was still running true.
Draco held those thoughts inside, keeping his face smooth and calm as his wand was taken from him. He ignored the rough grip as his hand was twisted behind his back, one of the other Aurors stepping forward to do the same on his right side.
,' Potter says to me, and his lip curls into a knowing smile. The bastard is enjoying this. I feel anger, bitter and hot, chased by shame, as it winds its way through me. I let them burn through the fear. If I'm going to have any hope of getting out of this I need to be the Draco Malfoy I used to be, the one who could match wits with Potter in his sleep and come out on top any time.
Draco tilts his head to give Harry better access to his neck, his gaze heating in the mirror. There's no shame in the look in his eyes. He knows what he does to Harry and he gets off on it just as much. Harry rumbles his approval and begins to nuzzle the bruises and bitemarks littering Draco's skin, all in various stages of healing. He licks and kisses softly against them, feeling himself begin to harden despite the fact that he'd taken Draco over the back of the couch the moment they'd both walked back in that afternoon.
Harry looked at him, hair shining in the sunlight, body long and graceful as he stretched his legs out in front of him.
'Congress has just passed an emergency measure,' the President continued. 'We are immediately bringing the power of the entire US armed forces to bear in this global conflict. Every person actively serving will be redeployed immediately, alongside our global allies, to combat this new enemy. Effective immediately, the National Guard will be activated to coordinate local networks to identify magic users.'
'Good evening,' Draco says, and there is something very knowing in his voice. 'It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance at last. I believe we just missed each other, last time.'
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it again. He was sick of defending himself. And he'd be damned if he defended himself to this idiot. The fact that Rick was right just made him grit his teeth harder.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but Hermione put a hand on his arm. Around his neck he felt Pheo twist against his skin, sensing his irritation. He forced himself to take a deep breath. He knew he needed to keep his cool when he was in the office. He couldn't afford for Jefferson to reprimand him about it again. She'd taken a Chinese Fireball case off him last time she'd decided he was being too antisocial at work.
Draco looked at him, expression dead serious. 'He lied to you, Potter. He lied to your face because he thinks he's smarter than you and wanted to show it off. He's behind this. I know it.'
Harry took another deep breath, feeling Felix flowing through his blood, calming and soothing him, telling him it was going to be alright. Harry nodded to himself and then set off down the street, imitating the same bent shuffle he'd see the man take on.
The man opened his mouth to protest, but something he saw in Harry's face seemed to make him reconsider. He pushed a button on the desk, and then looked up at Harry.
There were signs of the festering new ideology as well, in the boarded up or burnt out buildings he rode past. Not everywhere, but enough to know that the damage was rising. The night-time incursions were increasing. The fear was growing and with it, Harry could sense the city beginning to fracture.
'What was it like, last night?' Draco asks, and Harry can feel his eyes on him, though he doesn't turn his head to meet the gaze. 'When the wolf was in charge?'
He lay on the floor beside Harry, touching him with only the tips of his fingers, just enough that Harry would know he was there, but not so much that he would feel smothered or threatened.
He scraped at the desk with a broken and bitten fingernail, thinking about whether he wanted to go out that night. Dean might be up for it. Dean had come out most nights since he and Seamus had broken it off a few months ago. Harry could do with a good lay, even if doing it Polyjuiced into someone else's body always made him feel fucking weird. And if neither him or Dean found someone at the club, well, it wouldn't be the first time they'd come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
He walked in the door of Liquid Luck twenty minutes later as Erik. He squinted for a moment, disorientated. Gaudy gold light flashed all around him from the solid gold ornamentation and the sound of the bass thumped through him. But it only took him a second to adjust and he made straight for the bar. He caught the eye of one of the bar keepers who knew him by sight and held up three fingers.
Draco seemed comfortable, so Harry let it drop and they got back to work. Throughout the day, he stopped in to inform Draco of the latest theories and evidence drops. They had a team working the Lucius angle, but without proof, they couldn't move forward. Instead they were focusing their attention on trying to track accomplices. There had to be people on the outside casting the spells and setting up the attacks.
Harry could tell there was more to it than that - there always was, with Malfoy - but he didn't have the energy to pursue it.
Harry refused to rise to the bait. 'I quit my job. Also, the woman with the long black hair who was in here last night was an undercover Auror. She'll be back tonight.'
'Is that pretentious enough for you, Golden Boy?' Draco asked, his cutting tone belied by the way his eyes roamed over Harry's body, lit up by the sun.
Malfoy considers him for a long moment, and when he nods his agreement, Harry is certain that he's doing so for his own reasons.
Euphemia Rowle, according to Malfoy, was a rabid traditionalist, and had not let go of the idea that intermarrying was polluting bloodlines and that the correct place for Muggles was as servants to wizarding kind.
The door was open, despite the fact that it was two in the morning and Harry went straight in, touching the dragon carving and watching the door shimmer. Malfoy was inside and Harry spared a moment to wonder if he ever slept either. Then Malfoy was striding across the room to him, recognising Harry through the weak glamour he wore.
Draco hummed noncommittally. 'It was among my father's possessions. He always did like shiny things. Maggie's team managed to get hold of it and we duplicated it,' he said, gesturing at a row of them on the wall that Harry hadn't noticed when he walked in, 'just in case we need to repeat this. They haven't been activated, though,' he said, looking at Harry with serious eyes. 'There's no time in them.'
The Prague International Owlpost office was in a dingy little shop front that looked from the outside like it hosted regular drug deals. The inside didn't look much better. Harry entered the building and made straight for the back wall, angling his body away from the suspicious glare of the wizard behind the desk.
As Draco pushes back against him, hands dropping to the button of his own trousers, Harry forces himself to stop. He nips hard at Draco's neck and Draco turns his head to look at Harry, his face a picture of innocence.
'Everyone did,' Harry said in confirmation, thinking Ron may be right. 'I think he's found some way to make people forget about him. He's hard to track - hard to even
Harry looked up as the sky split apart with another flash of lightning, followed by a boom of thunder that shook the buildings around him. He wondered what was going through Draco's mind, that he was generating
'Are you for real?' He took a step away from the table, so that he was facing Harry. Harry pulled his smokes out and lit one up, drawing the tang of it into his lungs.
Harry cracks it and tilts the beer to his mouth, letting the cool taste of it wash over his tongue as he tries to come to grips with this new realisation.
'Do you have any Gillyweed?' he asked, then flushed. Of course Malfoy had Gillyweed, the whole room had reeked of it. 'A joint,' he clarified. He needed to relax. He needed this tension out or he was doing to say or do something more than he meant to.
. Malfoy is marked as his. He shouldn't even be looking at the other wolf, let alone offering himself.
Harry frowned, a mixture of pain and anger coming into his eyes. He shook his head. 'No one wants to see me. The way I acted after, after you—' Harry shook his head again, swallowing thickly. 'No one wants to see me,' he repeated, adamantly.
He was headed home after a long day at work - a long week, really. He'd been working hard on a case all month and he had a feeling they'd finally cracked it. Ron had come in with the final piece of the puzzle and all they had left to do was put it together and draw out the arrests.
'And who am I now?' he queried, already feeling much more comfortable. Malfoy's gaze jerked up from his neck and he met Harry's eyes again. He seemed to take a moment to gather himself, then he smirked, twirling his hand and bending slightly in a mocking half-bow.
They'd also talked, in a roundabout way, of whether Draco thought he might be able to have a life with someone else, sometime in the future. Harry's eyes flicked down to Draco's hands, clasped in front of him, the faint tapping of one thumb the only thing betraying his nervousness.
'Do you need help?' Ron asked, the look on his face pleading, as though asking Harry to turn to him, like he had so many times before. Ron looked tired too, Harry thought, and he was moving slowly, as though he was recovering from an injury.
Harry felt a tingle of nervous anticipation run through him at the thought that he was doing this again - that he was putting himself at someone else's mercy … someone who could make the world disappear, if only for a moment. Then he stood and pulled his shirt off, folding it neatly, before he toed out of his boots, nudging them together just under the couch with his foot. Then he unbuttoned his jeans and pulled them off along with his socks. He put his wand and glasses on top of the lot. His hands dropped to the waistband of his pants and he hesitated, glancing across at Ladon.
'You're back,' he stated, unnecessarily. Then he took in the others. Ron was helping Rose out of the Floo and Hermione was sitting at the kitchen table with Hugo.
'He's sleeping, Draco,' Lucius said. 'Just a bit of Dreamless Sleep. You used to need it, you remember, when you had the night terrors?'
The man in the image has a look of money about him. He's dark-haired, with strong, cruel-looking features and an arrogant gaze. He sneers out of the photo and Harry immediately knows his type. He's the sort of man Harry used to love being able to pull down a peg or three when he was Senior Auror. There's something about this sort of self-assured entitlement that just grates on him. Always has.
There had been an explosion. A flash of light and a roar of sound. Screams and heat and shattering glass. It had expanded out like a wave, unstoppable and deadly. He'd
He called Scorpius in, dishing dinner for the three of them, and then sat down. Despite the strangeness of Draco's mood. Harry found himself enjoying the meal. He listened to Scorpius talking about the day they'd had yesterday, throwing in his own comments occasionally about something he'd seen or done. But Scorpius seemed pretty happy to hold his own conversation and Harry found it distracting enough that he felt his dark thoughts slowly receding.
'I miss you so much,' Potter said, and his other hand slid onto Draco's hip. Two fingers slipped under the edge of his t-shirt, rubbing against his skin. Draco's breath shook as his entire focus narrowed down to that touch.
He supposed there must be a bus or a taxi or something he could take. He wouldn't be able to do anything about it until he landed and saw what was available though. He put the matter aside, which left his mind free to cycle onto other thoughts. So much had happened in the last few days. He could feel it whirling through him, round and round until he was almost sick with it. He pulled out the notes from Aoife and reviewed them again, thinking about the people she had identified as possible hosts for War and Conquest.
Harry frowned, annoyance spiking over him. 'I know exactly what sort of past Malfoy has,' he said. 'I was there for it. The names are legit.'
at the thought of taking them—he'd woken up completely differently. He'd felt alive, revitalised, as though taking his other form under the moon had renewed him. This time he feels both his lingering grief and his conflict over his conversation with Malfoy before he'd left shadowing his exhaustion.
'I thought we might do something different, tonight,' he murmured, and Harry couldn't help the faint shiver that crossed his skin at the sound of the husky voice in his ear.
Shacklebolt spread his hands. 'I'm sending a Ministry-wide memo today, but at this point, your guess is as good as mine as to whether someone's done this on purpose.'
The look on Ladon's face was hungry. His gaze was like a caress, taking in every inch of his body. Blue eyes lingered on Harry's cock and he felt himself twitch under the close attention. He reddened in embarrassment at his reaction, but Ladon merely licked his lips, gaze not leaving Harry's hard shaft.
'Stop it, Harry. This can't be such a surprise. Things have changed so much between us. You're clearly not happy either, or you wouldn't have kissed someone else.'
It feels so strange—so wrong—to refer openly to the part of him that he's been so careful to keep hidden. But Draco doesn't even blink at the reference to his other senses. He shakes his head. 'I think it's too risky. We don't know what sort of follow up they might do the day after a drop, or what other traps are laid down there. That magic—the room we were in—it's old magic. I don't think the people that are activating it have a particularly good handle on what it does.'
Ron came by his office at lunchtime. Harry had been surprised when they gave him the office in his second year, not long out of his training. It had taken him approximately three days to realise that it was a way to keep him quarantined, rather than to reward him. Apparently he was either a) too distracting to the rest of the recruits - though Ron didn't have that problem and he was still splashed across the papers as much as Harry back then. Or b) his 'I don't give a shit' attitude was grating on his supervisors and they were afraid it would rub off on the rest. The Rules at the Ministry were apparently so much more sacrosanct than The Rules of Hogwarts or The Rules of fucking keeping yourself alive while fighting the Dark Lord from ages eleven to seventeen.
Malfoy considered Murphy for a moment again. 'I was saddened, of course,' he said, no trace of sadness on his face. 'Geraldine Shafiq is still in St Mungo's, and Cordelia Avery lost her life. Purebloods, both. To think that they will be unable to carry on their lines. Dark times.' He shook his head. 'And to think Muggles are to blame.' He looked down his nose at them all again.
Harry jerked awake to the sound of a fire alarm blaring through the hotel. He sat bolt upright, pulling his hood back on with a curse and then rushed out of the room and downstairs. The foyer was chaos, as people poured down from the rooms above. Harry was buffeted as people moved into the space he was occupying, and he pushed through the panic, heading for the door.
'He's been good this afternoon?' Draco asked, as he sent Pansy's cup across to where she was sitting at the table.
He stepped closer, unable to help himself. He couldn't take his eyes off Harry and the pleasure on his face, or the sight of his bobbing cock, hard and untouched between his legs.
'I can't,' he says, into Draco's shocked face. The shock changes quickly to impassivity, though Draco's emotions are sharp in the air, painful. He needs to leave, Harry thinks, as he backs away. This is the right choice, he knows it is, but that doesn't mean he wants to be around the fallout.
Harry sees Malfoy's hand drop to his wand, but he doesn't even think to grab his own. That's never his first reaction anymore. His fingers flex against the table and he remembers the feeling of claws erupting through his skin. Strange how so many years of training can be overridden by foreign instincts so quickly.
Harry shakes off his sadness and gestures to Malfoy, standing off to one side. He has a job to do. Living in the past won't get it done.
Draco swallowed heavily as he felt arousal rush through him at the thought. Not one tentacle, but many moving over him, holding him in place, pushing their way inside him. He closed his eyes for a second and took a deep, shuddering breath. Then he nodded, a sharp assent, eyes still closed. He couldn't look at Harry while he admitted to something like that.
'You can drop the Cloak,' he said, still speaking softly. 'I have clearance to be in here but I definitely shouldn't be bringing other people.' He gave a Draco crooked grin.
Harry grabs Malfoy's arm and rips him forward, twisting and pulling him away from the blade. It's already descending and Harry has a second to regret the fact that he didn't cast a
'Uh - work. Good news from a junior Auror I recommended for promotion,' he said quickly. Ginny watched him a moment longer before she nodded and went back to her breakfast with a murmured congratulations. They didn't talk much about work anymore - hers or his. He doubted he could even name all of her teammates and coaching staff.
Harry glances back at Malfoy, hair shining in the light of his wand. It falls forward over his forehead as he works, wand movements graceful and sure.
'Fine,' Harry said. 'The only threat you've had against him has been the photos from the Muggle Killings cases, yes?'
It is dark all around him but he doesn't need his eyes. The scent of what he seeks is rich in the air.
His feet followed the familiar path. The moon was bright but he didn't need it to see the way. He'd been here so many times now, to this place he hadn't known existed until he was seventeen years old. He passed by the gaudy tribute to his parents without seeing it. Instead he made his way among the gravestones, to the part of the cemetery that was quiet and still. He reached his parents' headstones and sank to his knees in front of them.
Parkinson turned up her nose at a kiss with Seamus, claiming she didn't want him groping her the way he had Harry. Seamus, for some reason, hesitated when it came to kissing Zabini. Harry, watching him, as he looked anywhere but at the other man, wondered if it was a case of perhaps wanting too much, more than not.
'Draco Malfoy is Veritas,' he says, eyes still closed. The words come easily. He feels no compulsion to run to the Aurors, none of the consuming rage Malfoy's presence had caused in him when they'd first come face to face.
Draco didn't look at her, instead he turned his focus inwards, calming and strengthening himself. He thought about how he could make his innocence clear and at what point he would just tell Potter to fuck his head games and would show the Ministry just how much power his name could still command.
Harry feels a glow of warmth in his chest at the thought of Rose. He's always loved her—been fascinated by the way she'd grown, the way she was loved, the way she learned about the world. He'd seen her in some ways as his chance to start again, to do better than he had when he'd been a godfather to a child he had let down in the worst of ways.
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder at Harry's helpless glance, and grinned. 'I'll be in the kitchen if you need me, Potter,' he said, pointing back through the open entrance he'd come in though.
Harry felt his anger spark, mixing with the shock and the nausea at the dawning understanding that was becoming more and more real by the second.
This shouldn't be possible. Draco's ability to affect the weather should have no impact outside of the walls of the Ministry. Hermione had been clear about the limitations of the spell. But the evidence was all around him. The sky had been cloudless minutes earlier.
Harry looks down at the letter and feels the entire plan click into place in his mind. He glances up at Draco and lets a smile spread across his face. His wolf approves of his hunting tactics and he feels his smile sharpen with that approval. Somehow, rather than putting him off, the wolf's endorsement makes him relax. His wolf—the part of him that is the wolf—lives for the hunt. It wouldn't steer him wrong.
'In here,' came the voice from the kitchen. Harry smiled and kicked off his boots, lining them up neatly and hanging his Auror robes over the peg by the door, giving them a quick flick to straighten them.
Draco grunted sourly. 'Please don't tell me you're fucking Finch-Fletchley again?' he said. 'The last round got your crup named after him, what this time?'
'Thank you for seeing us, Minister,' Hermione said, as though they hadn't barged straight in. 'Apologies for jumping up the chain, but Magical Maintenance wasn't able to give us an update and we thought a Ministry-wide memo might be warranted at this point?'
Harry latched onto it. Malfoy was wavering, he could feel it. He just had to push it a tiny bit further.
He moved it in and out slowly. It was slim enough that it hadn't been a challenge to insert but enough that he could feel the pleasure as he moved it within himself.
'We're in Surrey Hills,' he said, pulling his mind away from that train of thought as well. 'You want a break before I let them out?'
Markwell's eyes widen in shock. He looks, for an instant, as though Harry has punched him in the guts. His expression immediately changes to a glare, eyes narrowed in suspicion and what looks like anger.
Instead he scrapes his teeth along Draco's neck and down to his collarbone, rubbing his cheek against the skin there before sucking hard into it. He returns both hands to Draco's arse and cups it, kneading it as he ruts his cock against him. Draco's legs are tight around him and the feeling of it makes him want more. Harry breathes him in, deep gulping breaths, as he licks and sucks and bites. A cluster of angry red marks already litter his skin and Harry knows they'll bruise, but it's not enough. He needs more. He nearly fucking lost Draco.
Rockwood seemed to have got wind of what was happening somehow, and was in hiding. Harry had two teams hunting him. Macnair had been injured during his apprehension and was unconscious in St Mungo's. Harry had reprimanded the over-zealous Auror but he couldn't blame him, not really.
'Three hundred fifty Galleons,' he said, completely ignoring Harry's comment. Harry considered pushing the point, wanting to see how Malfoy would respond, but he couldn't afford to get him off side if he wanted to find out what was going on.
Malfoy makes a slightly annoyed face, as he puts his feet up on the coffee table and leans back against the cushions. '"All this", as you so eloquently put it, was revenge, to start with,' he says as he swirls his whisky idly in his glass, looking down at it. 'I just wanted to fuck Jeffries over, the way he had me. I had to figure out a way to do it that wouldn't put me in Azkaban, so I found people who could sell faces and names.'
Harry takes a deep breath and slides his fingernail under the catch. He flicks it open with a snap that's loud in the tension that's growing in the room again. It opens and slides from his wrist. He catches it and throws it across the room to Malfoy.
Harry raised the drink to his lips, as his eyes drifted back to the stage. Then he paused and mentally slapped himself before cupping his hand around it to cast a discrete diagnostic over it. The charms flared before fading. Again, he registered the presence of compulsion. He sat back, looking at the drink in his hand and trying to analyse what he was feeling.
Harry shakes his head immediately. He can't afford to hope. 'No way,' he says. 'They kicked me out. They don't want me.'
He stands again, slipping his clothes off and piling them loosely on the end of a log. Then he looks up into the sky and smiles as he lets the moon take him.
The club is dominated by a catwalk that runs down the middle of the room. There are four women on the stage at the moment, all in various stages of undress, riding poles or presenting themselves to the crowd—overwhelmingly men—watching them. Most of the women in the audience seem to work for the club as well, based on the level of undress they're sporting. Over to the right are what look to be private booths, many of the tables in them holding a pole and some holding women, delivering more tailored shows.
'Right,' she said brusquely. 'Well. I think it's highly unlikely that host in particular was responsible for the death of your child, though the rider may have been. Catalysts like you always get the bad end of the stick.'
'We both almost died last night,' Draco says, slapping his hand away. 'We're done for today. We need to rest.
Malfoy turned around in his seat, addressing his son. 'When did he tell you that? And don't say heaps.'
Harry Apparated straight back to his bike and then cast a dampening charm that Ron had taught him. It was illegal to hide your magical signature, but that particular charm had come in handy many times before. He felt his magic fade away, burrowing deep inside himself and tried to ignore the discomfort that caused. It was better than being dead. He had no idea if he was being tracked but if whoever had killed Jakub and Daniela returned to either site, they would find his trace all over them. From there it wouldn't be hard to find his apartment, if someone had enough resources at their disposal.
'Potter,' Malfoy says. 'You need to let me go now. We talked about this.' He lets out a huff of exasperation. 'Well, I talked, you mostly hallucinated and groped me.'
As he reviewed it, circling and taking notes on the things that stood out to him, Harry found himself wondering just what had happened to Malfoy in the last eight years that had turned him into someone who was capable of this level of vicious manipulation. Then he thought of Lucius Malfoy and stopped being surprised. It was in the blood, after all. Harry had seen it himself—Draco's skill at lying, at telling someone exactly what they wanted to hear, right up until the moment he tore them to pieces with the truth.
Malfoy turned to Harry, suddenly looking uncertain and strangely vulnerable. 'You think my father took him?'
'It's probably best if I don't tell you more, Harry,' Luna said. 'I'm not really supposed to bring people with me, so I probably should wait and see what they would like to tell you.'
'I was out of line, with Davies. The—' He takes a deep breath, trying to figure out the best way to explain himself. He knows what some of Malfoy said was valid, even if he doesn't—can't—agree with all of it. 'The things you said were right. The reason a lot of weres are dangerous is because they're not taught how to be safe.'
'You're a gin drinker, no?' Malfoy's voice floated back into the room, from where he busied himself at the cabinet.
Things feel different between them the next morning. New. Harry doesn't quite know what to make of it. On the one hand, Malfoy's revelations of the day before have moved him firmly out of suspect territory. He thinks about all the evidence he's gathered about Malfoy's comings and goings, the tentative theories he'd started creating. None of it comes close to the truth about who he is—what he does.
They let go simultaneously and Davies turns a smile on Malfoy, seemingly unperturbed by the interaction. 'The food here is exquisite,' he says. 'My colleague said you were French?'
Thanks to the cheer squad <3 and thanks again to everyone who is reading, subscribing, bookmarking and leaving me the most wonderful comments. I really am overwhelmed by all of you. I hadn't expected anywhere near this level of support for the story and it's just the most amazing feeling.
Harry took a deep breath and dropped the hair inside. This was only a two hour batch, but it was cleared for use with random samples.
His face ached and he could feel pain radiating from several spots on his body where people had hit or kicked him before he'd managed to push them back. He thought of the surging fury of the crowd, the spectral creature he'd seen burst into life.
'It's fine,' Maggie said. 'There's books about how to do this. Timekeepers used to harvest time all over the place, back in the beginning. Before we lost the ability to trap it.' She was eyeing Harry with a hungry look.
'Do you have anything in here that would be damaged by a strong reversal spell?' Harry asked, not taking his eyes off the skull.
Mrs. Norris stepped back inside his office as though she'd been standing outside the door, waiting for his response. Probably had.
Draco could only nod as another tentacle reached for him, twisting its way around his leg, the suction cups raising and releasing his skin as it undulated its way around him. It pulled him closer again and then the third tentacle wrapped around his waist, until the sensation of the suction cups spread across his whole body. It almost seemed like the squid was exploring him,
'Do you remember that trip to Italy?' Potter asked, as he looked down at the beer in his hands. Draco was lost for a second, until he realised Potter and Charlie must have heard the saying while in Italy. He made an encouraging hum, but stayed quiet. Potter hadn't provided him with any memories related to that trip, and Draco didn't want to shatter the illusion by getting a detail wrong.
He knew what he had to do next. He had to find a way to get on board a Muggle aeroplane and make his way to New York. Then he had to find Malfoy and figure out what the hell he knew about all of this.
Scorpius nodded, wiggling off Draco's lap and disappearing back into his room. Draco sat on the floor for a moment longer and then he pulled his wand out of his pocket and cast a Patronus to Pansy. It was weak and hazy around the edges, but it would reach her.
Harry looked away, feeling unaccountably uncomfortable, the antagonism he'd felt in his office the week before strangely hard to muster - it was one of those emotions that seemed to spark, and then fizzle out.
Malfoy's mouth thinned and he sneered again. 'I suppose you want some romp with the girl Weasel, do you? Relive your glory days?'
Harry woke up as he came, grinding into the mattress with a cry of pleasure. He could still feel Malfoy on him, in him. He could taste and smell Malfoy all around him. He pushed against the bed again, wanting to reach for the man behind him but aware with every passing moment that Malfoy wasn't there. That it hadn't been real.
'I need to go and check if Hugo went down okay,' Ron said, kissing Hermione lightly on the cheek and somehow communicating with her without words. She nodded slightly. He gave Harry a half smile and a last, troubled glance before he disappeared back up the stairs. Harry watched him go, a pang shooting through him at their familiarity. Had him and Ginny been in sync like that, when they were younger?
He pushed the pain away, pulling other memories around it. He focussed on his family. Love. Happiness. Connection. Purpose. He layered himself with brightness, until he felt like he'd created his own internal Patronus.
Potter hesitated for a second and then shook his head, and this time he couldn't quite meet Draco's eyes. Draco could see that evasion for what it was; normally, it was one of his first hooks to help a client back towards a place of healing. This time, it would be a hook to get him further into Potter's confidence, to get him to the place where he could do the most damage.
He replays the Veritaserum conversation, runs a finger over the chain clasped around his wrist and thinks through the interactions he'd witnessed at the strip club.
Harry reaches for the door handle only to find it locked. He shakes the door but it doesn't budge. He sets his shoulder to it. He has to get to Teddy. His scream comes again and Harry feels the sound echo through him. He hits the door again, panic surging in him.
He couldn't - he hadn't told Harry who he was. He couldn't have sex with him again - couldn’t continue this façade that Ladon could be someone Harry could have in his life.
'Fill you up and then plug you,' Harry continues, the thought of it sending heat racing through him. 'So you're full of me, and smell like me and everybody knows you're mine.'
Somehow, Draco's slow exploration of his body, as he stood there, fully clothed, while Harry was naked and on display, was incredibly arousing.
'And we have passed the following sentence: For the crime of Malicious intent to cause grievous bodily harm, we pronounce you guilty.'
He lies awake at night and concentrates until he can pick out the sound of Draco breathing as he sleeps. Only then, when he's sure his wolf will wake him if something changes, does he sleep.
Malfoy just stands there, arms crossed, watching him, the light from his wand making his eyes shine with a devilish light.
'You knew?' he said, his voice a low rasp. He was talking to Malfoy now, not the thing inside him, but it was War who answered again.
'Harry,' she looked hesitant, sad, her face showing none of the shock and anger he'd expected. 'I've ... well, for a while now I've been ... seeing someone.'
The car roars to life as Harry stands there, staring at him. Malfoy revs it, once, and Harry realises that if he doesn't get in, Malfoy will probably leave him behind. He opens the door and slides into the leather seat, taking a second to appreciate that his first thought had been correct. This car is expensive.
Harry Apparated home from Ministry early that night - if early could be considered to be almost three hours after he was due to come off duty. Malfoy's interview had taken much longer than he'd anticipated. Harry was still unsettled by the entire experience. It was as though Malfoy had known he was standing behind the glass. His eyes were constantly searching the surface, like a hawk seeking its prey below.
'No.' Barclay shook her head. 'I'll be back again tonight. Start to build up some familiarity, turn myself into a patron. A place like that, something more than just drinks has to be going on. I need to be there long enough that he offers it to me, too.'
Malenkayacherpakha and Static_abyss who put their hands up straight away to help and then told me so many lovely things and made me feel so much better about all of it.
Hermione started at that. 'The Healers! We need to tell them you're awake, Harry. They need to run tests.'
Rick's eyes snapped to Harry's at that. They were a pale blue and there was nothing warm in them as he smiled in greeting and reached out his hand.
They move swiftly and the pile of files grows on the desk. Davies' office isn't visible from the entry way, but Harry keeps an eye on the door. He'll stun Joseph if he has to. It's fifteen minutes before they're done and Draco shrinks all of the duplicated files down, tucking them into his pocket.
Harry ignored their banter and followed his target silently. It was the work of a moment to step in close behind him and whisper an Imperio. Another moment and he was pushing him into a cramped stall, looking into vacant eyes as he cast a Muffliato and locked the cubicle door.
'You forgot to set the wards properly. It could have happened to anyone.' Her voice thickened with those last words, as though she didn't believe them as she said them.
The sounds of splashing from the bathroom down the hall had died down, so Harry assumed bath time was over. He moved down the passage, intending to use the toilet quickly, when he heard the faint sounds of a song coming from Scorpius' partially opened door.
He caught sight of Zabini again. He was at the bar now, bending his head to talk to an elegant woman in a sweeping black dress, her hair cut into a neat bob. With a start of surprise, he recognised Pansy Parkinson. At that moment, she turned, eyes scanning over the crowded room. Her gaze snagged on Harry and her eyes widened then she looked away, waving a hand in the air as she said something else to Zabini. Harry snorted at the irony of dodging a party of his old school friends only to attend one filled with his old school enemies.
After all, most of them were nothing like Lupin had been, and there were so many of them after the war.
He took a sip of his drink as he watched Andrews, who stared down at his own glass, as though he didn't want to meet Malfoy's eyes. Harry returned his attention to Malfoy, seeing in the lines of his body and the restrained eagerness on his face, something that reminded him of the fierceness of a hunting cat as it stalked.
Harry focused on the faint smell of lemons as he reached deep inside himself. He didn't try to coax the power forth this time, he just reached inside and ripped it out. He laid himself bare before his anguish and rage and regret and he let his magic surge over those wounds like a wave, reading in every line of his being what he wanted and needed from it.
As he toweled himself down, he resolved to have Mrs. Norris run the name Samael Ladon as soon as she was back on Monday. He knew from past experience that requesting his head secretary to do anything over the weekend would land him in a world of pain. Ron had thought it was hilarious when Harry first got the job and told him that his sixty year old assistant's name was Mrs. Norris. It had taken Harry approximately half a day to decide that she was even more omnipotent than old Filch's cat and that he
'It hates me,' he says, and closes the distance between them. He picks up the bottle, taking a swig directly from the neck. 'It wants to kill me.' He looks across at Draco to see him frowning. He seems to hesitate, as though trying to make up his mind about something, and then he speaks again.
'Thank you for agreeing to meet with me, Head Auror,' he said, grey eyes meeting Harry's confidently.
Harry felt his anger rise. Why did Malfoy have to be such a fucking shit in real life? In the dreams he was so different. Harry felt his thoughts leap.
It connects things from the past to things from the present in a way that's often jarring, sending him flashing into memories he'd long forgotten. A few months ago he'd vomited in Molly's toilet after he'd got a hint of scent from a cleaner Aunt Petunia had scrubbed him down with one time when he'd pissed himself. One time when he'd been locked in for so long he'd had no choice.
Harry thought for a second, not sure that he could, but he nodded slowly. 'If it's like that - about me - what do you get out of it?' he asked, reddening again.
'Do you have to be working today?' he asks, and there's nothing of his earlier judgement in his voice.
let himself feel it—most of the time. But now, tonight, on the night James had been taken from him, he couldn't stop remembering what it should feel like to have his son with him.
He hears a small huff of laughter and Malfoy switches the kettle off, opening the fridge behind him instead. He pulls out two Stellas and passes one to Harry as he sits opposite him.
Pansy kicked his foot from where she sat in the chair across from him and Draco started, wrenching himself out of his memories.
'Nothing happened. Place was a ghost town. She went in, had a few drinks and was the only person in the place all night. Apparently Malfoy spent the entire time sitting in the corner watching her like some creepy spider.'
Something about that, the tiny continuation of the routine they've established together, settles Harry. He can't let Malfoy find out his secret, but he doesn't have to decide what to do right now. He has time.
Malfoy. It was just that if there was something he could do to make things a little easier, that wouldn't be too much to ask.
Potter's eyes widened fractionally, as though surprised Draco hadn't wanted to push the issue. Draco felt like rolling his eyes at Harry. Really. Could he be any more obvious with his 'Slytherins always take the underhanded paths – especially Malfoys' attitude.
He took a step towards her, taking a deep breath, thinking of all the things he'd been considering in the last few days. 'But you were right. You do deserve to be happy and to be wanted, and I know you aren't getting that from me.' He felt sadness well in him, and realised that his anger at the situation was gone. He wondered how much of that was due to having time to think through what Ginny had said, and how much was Ladon taking him to pieces - allowing him to let go of it. 'I'm sorry I haven't been able to give that to you.'
He wrote to Susan Bones, explaining more about his leave of absence, apologising for the way he'd pulled rank out of pride and hurt. He told her he trusted her implicitly to act in his absence. The letter he got back was simple and soothed something inside him.
Draco's smile widens until there is something of death written in it. Harry watches in satisfaction as the dark-haired man looks away.
'Good,' Draco smiled. 'When we're done, we're going to discuss what you just told me.' He rolled his eyes, 'And we're going to set some rules about what does and doesn't belong in a scene.'
which should dampen the sound of his arrival. Then he took a deep breath, pulled out his wand, and hoped like hell he wasn't about to jump into a trap.
Malfoy ignored Harry's clear hostility and pulled out a chair. He sank gracefully into it, looking around Harry's office with an air of faint curiosity. Harry prickled at the judgement he just knew was sitting under the polite façade. His office was a mess. He wasn't paid to keep things tidy. He was paid to get things done. What right did
,' but his mate doesn't try and stop him from proclaiming their victory. He howls and howls until the feeling of it vibrates in his chest, then he drops to all fours.
When they got down into Harry's office, Malfoy wandered around the room, peering at the pictures Harry had stuck to his pinboard, picking up books about rare diseases and putting them back down after thumbing through them for a moment. He moved around the room, touching everything lightly.
He let his mind drift back over the night, regretting the amount of firewhisky he'd downed. It always gave him the worst hangovers. He remembered with a lurch his conversation with Javier, and felt his anger stir again. He made a mental note to speak to Kingsley on Monday. Technically he should be abiding by the directions of the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, but the man was a tosser who was going to get people killed. Harry would not -
'I won't take up too much of your time, Potter,' he said, injecting cool professionalism into his tone. 'There are two things I want to discuss with you. The first is to ensure that we both have the same understanding of the current reforms being proposed and the possible threats they will engender. The second is to establish the most appropriate way of ensuring this doesn't come to pass - advocacy, pressure or financial support for the existing system.'
it gives me to live inside a host who is so opposed to everything I want to achieve, yet who submits to me to save others.'
Harry shook himself. That was a distraction. It was all a distraction. He'd only kept going back because he wanted information about the case. Because he wanted to be the one to solve it. Thinking about the case made Harry think about work. Had Jeffries had any new leads in the last few days? Harry hadn't noticed any surveillance around the bar. Had there been any more disappearances?
He had to stop in Amesbury and ask directions to the big poncy Manor around these parts. Lucky it wasn't too late at night. He considered having a drink while he was there but something in him was itching to keep moving, to follow up this lead while it was fresh in his mind again. He couldn't believe he'd forgotten Malfoy's words. He could have been weeks ahead in trying to figure out what the hell was going on. He felt anger stirring at himself and tried to push it back down. That wasn't going to help him now.
Harry takes a step forward, a silent snarl rumbling in his chest, but Davies just reaches into his pocket for his phone. He stands behind Malfoy's chair and leans down over his shoulder, his face so close to Malfoy's neck that Harry has to dig his nails into his palms to stop himself from walking over there and slamming Davies' head into his desk.
Harry rolls his eyes in annoyance. 'I'm a damned Auror, Malfoy. I know what the minimum dose of V is.'
He was halfway back to the bar at six the next morning, after a restless night filled with fragments of dreams and an unfulfilled yearning, when he realised he'd forgotten to check his case board. He hesitated, but then thoughts of those tiny arms wrapped around him, the mischief in his other boy's eyes, the idea that he could have them again - see them again, filled his mind, and he changed his course. He was too tired to walk and it was taking too long. He stepped into a gap between two buildings and Apparated.
When he opened them, Draco was looking at him with an oddly intense expression on his face. Harry cleared his throat, looking away as he put a leg over his broom.
'No buts. Molly and Arthur were perfectly nice to you when we had them for dinner last month and you had your mark showing then too. It's fine. Let's go and have a good time, okay?'
Harry turned Draco gently in his arms, cradling him as they slipped to the floor, leaning against the tank.
Harry grits his teeth, but he keeps his smile in place as he straightens. He has to work not to show that he's favouring his hip. Something in Markwell's posture makes Harry think of a predator sizing up prey. He has a feeling this is not a man to show weakness to. He pushes aside the grinding agony. If only that wound would heal the same miraculous way all his others do now.
It's barely an hour later when they walk into the CTI complex that Davies worked in. Draco is Polyjuiced as him, having successfully argued that he has ten years more experience than Harry at living a double life. He's adapted one of Harry's Muggle suits to fit Davies' barrel-chested bulk. Harry walks closely behind him, invisibility cloak thrown over himself. He tries to ignore how strange it is to see the dead man walking again.
'Harry,' he said gently, his heart aching at the fear in Harry's voice. 'Harry, you're okay. None of it is real.' He reached up slowly with one hand and released the tie on the blindfold. It fell to the ground, but Draco could see Harry's eyes were squeezed tight.
Harry had planned to tell him that he was being a prat for demanding that the Aurors - that Harry in particular - inform him about whether his father was being visited, but something in Draco's tone stopped him. The man sounded concerned, rather than demanding.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and Harry knows he's considering it. 'This is ridiculous, Potter. You'll hex me the moment my back is turned and we both know it.'
The suppressants always leave him feeling like that. The two times he'd gone without them—that first moon where they'd had to see whether he would turn, and one other time, at Grimmauld, when he'd just been so absolutely
'This is Hunter,' Malfoy says, indicating Harry, as he takes a seat as well. 'He's providing me with support while I'm in London.'
Harry thought of why he was here - what he wanted to prove - what he needed evidence to be able to prove. He couldn't stop now.
Harry's body shook with aftershocks and he made little abortive thrusts as he came down from his orgasm. As Harry's arms relaxed, he leaned his head onto Draco's shoulder, breathing heavily.
Draco nodded, his attention back on the pan as he turned the sausages. He didn't seem quite as excited by the prospect. Harry looked more closely at him, trying to look beyond his own concerns for a moment.
'This, and other files,' Malfoy says, a smirk hovering on his lips. 'And no, before you ask, I won't be sharing the contents of the other files and the spell is coded to my voice and intent so don't even think about trying to sneak a look.'
Hours later, as Harry watched Draco and Scorpius walk away after a day spent talking, playing with the kids and sharing ice-cream, a feeling of happiness rose in him that was so bright it hurt.
loved him. That somehow, in taking him apart and looking inside his soul, Draco had fallen in love with what he saw there. He'd fallen so hard and so fast that he would never recover from it. But he knew that those very words would be the ones that destroyed everything - that would make it so Harry could never be his. And he couldn't bring himself to utter them.
Markwell is all sharp edges and disparaging remarks that have the Aurors just as willing to arrest him as listen to him. Harry wishes he could have a second with Draco, just a moment to tell him he understands. He gets that this is what coping looks like, he just wishes it didn't have to hurt so much.
on the coffee table just long enough to see the moon tally has been updated on the monthly front page count.
Ron's hesitancy didn't fade, if anything he began to look worried. 'We know what happened, Harry. Remember, they sent it all in a big letter. It was an accident. The was a gap in the wards and the window was left open. The monitoring charm wasn't set. The Erkling coming in was just an awful, awful accident.'
Malfoy seems to take a second longer to wind down and there's still tension in his jaw as he jerks his head at Harry. He mutters under his breath as he turns away, but Harry can hear every word. 'Why is everything such fucking
Andrews began to thrust faster, grunting as he did. He put his head up, clearly looking for a kiss. Malfoy supplied it to him, but the look in his eyes didn't change, as he stared beyond Andrews and let his body be used.
Harry nods and reaches for a piece of paper. Malfoy duplicates his pen and they both get to work. Empty beer bottles stack up to one side as the pile of notes in front of them grows. After a few hours, they've got six possible locations, three confirmed conspirators from Malfoy's list and another six faces. Neither of them have anything they think could be Mother.
But then the second half of what Draco just said hits him and it's like a bucket of iced water has been poured over him.
Despite the fact that a part of Draco had been expecting something like this, the action felt like a betrayal. Harry was doing this to get back at him - to hurt him. When word got out that he had been questioned in relation to the Killings, Draco knew he could count on one hand the number of people who would be willing to be connected to him. He could just see the headlines now. 'Former Death Eater Behind Muggle Killings?', 'Malfoy Heir Follows Father's Footsteps.'
'Are you kidding me right now, Potter?' he says, as he pulls out his wand and directs a Healing Charm at Harry's back. 'Have you seriously just been sitting beside me,
' The word fell from his lips like the toll of a bell. He watched as the thing inside Malfoy flinched at the sound.
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. 'Did you take a bludger to the head, Potter? You were with me when we went to Quality Quidditch to pick it out.'
The words ricocheted through Harry's mind for a moment before they registered, and then he looked up, mind abruptly sharpening.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes, keeping up his stream of encouragement and love. He saw, inch by inch as Harry forced the darkness of his past away and forced himself back into the present. He saw the exact moment
'He's not a separate creature,' Draco continues. 'He's the part of all of us that we can't touch anymore, the most primal, instinct-driven part of us. That's what the lycanthropy virus does. It grows that part of the brain, strengthening the cells, bringing it to life. The wolf in you is who you would have been a million years ago.'
'You're nothing like I thought you were,' he says, as he finishes, having basically inhaled the food. He sits back, considering me across the small table.
'Fine,' he says. 'Archer said the assignment was a long one. I'll need a couple of days to myself at the end of next week, but aside from that I'm available. What are the logistics?'
Harry stepped forward, out of his jeans, closer to Draco, and let his hands slide over his hips, dipping one into the front of his pants to grip around his cock. He let his eyes slip almost closed and bit his lip as he watched Draco watching him.
Malfoy was standing in the doorway to the dream room, as Harry had taken to calling it in his head. His arms were crossed and the look on his face was forbidding.
Draco is different while they're working with the Aurors. Grimmauld Place gets turned into an operations centre. Draco had made the very good point, which Harry had reluctantly agreed with, that the Ministry could be home to a connection to any point of the smuggling ring supply chain, and they couldn't take the chance of anyone being tipped off.
'I've heard weird things,' his companion said, a heavyset older man. He frowned. 'Just the other week Pavel and Matyáš came back from a raid and they were strange. They hardly remembered what they'd been doing. If it was just Pavel, I would have said he was drunk, but Matyáš has more sense than that. And anyway he likes the thrill of setting things on fire, he wouldn't drink through that.'
Harry turned and hurried after Draco, who was pushing open the door to his father's drawing room and looking around wildly. There was no one inside and the light had disappeared. Harry saw Draco growl in frustration and lift his wand. He realised a moment too late just what Draco was planning as he pointed the tip at his own throat, his voice booming out a moment later.
. He'd known the moment he stunned the two guards and tore the wards apart so that he could Apparate back through them, that War would know what had happened. He could feel the trace he'd placed on Malfoy jerking every fifteen minutes or so, as he jumped from one location to the next, searching for the child.
He felt like he was frozen in place. Malfoy had turned and was walking towards the piano. Harry glanced up at the movement and his gaze caught on the muscles of Malfoy's arse and thighs, rippling as he moved. He hadn't lost any of his lean power since Harry had last seen him like this and the sight of him was hard to look away from.
Draco pulled back at Harry's movement, breathing hard. Harry reached for him again, but Draco shook his head.
Draco watched him for a moment, as though wondering whether Harry would say more. He had so many things he wanted to say, but none were things he could afford to let slip from his mouth.
Harry woke slowly, clinging to the fragments of the dream. Draco gestured to the green door and Harry made his way out of the dream room slowly, his whole body feeling stiff and sore, his mind still half in the dream.
else did. And then Harry realised that it was exactly because Ladon had no place in his normal daily life that made speaking to him so appealing. Harry didn't have to face him every day - didn't have to look him in the face and see his own fears and weaknesses staring back at him.
Harry re-cast the Impervius charm over himself and the various crates and containers scattered around the office which he mostly used as a pre-transport storeroom. He frowned up at the ceiling. It had been raining all day. Inside. Normally rain wouldn't bother him, no matter how strange it was for it to be happening in the Ministry. He spent most of his time outside in all sorts of weather when he was on one of his trips, but he had a family of Puffskeins tucked away in his desk drawer and a nest of Bowtruckles sitting in a crate in the corner. Not to mention the Kelpie that was in the tank, awaiting transport to somewhere less populated by vulnerable Muggles.
'Get what - ' Malfoy started, before he scowled in annoyance, taking a step backwards and pushing Harry flat on the bed. 'Lie down, you idiot.' He reached up and put a finger to Harry's temple.
Ron's face softened when Harry walked in, but it wasn't a smile that crossed it. He was standing at the table cutting carrots and Harry could smell the stew bubbling on the stove behind him. His stomach gave a loud growl at the sound, reminding him that he'd barely eaten lately.
Rudolph Avery had been tried earlier in the month. The evidence against him was overwhelming. They had Muggle video footage of him entering the Sky Gardens and interacting with one of the Muggle victims. He had tested positive for polyjuice residue and the owners of the warehouse the bomb had been made in had positively identified him. He'd been given life in Azkaban. No parole.
Malfoy waved his hand vaguely as he stood, scooping up one of the sandwiches and a cupcake, which he shrunk and dropped into his pocket. Pheo slithered down from his sleeve, but rather than looking for Harry, she curled around Malfoy's wrist. He looked down at her, surprised, but then smiled. Harry almost forgot what he had been asking as he watched the two of them together. She wasn't normally so casually affectionate with anyone but him - even Ron and Hermione, who'd known her since she appeared last year, barely got a pat in.
'The things you show me - you don't do that with other people.' He didn't make it a question. He knew.
Malfoy's head jerks around and he meets Harry's eyes for just a fraction of a second before he seems to force himself to look back out the windscreen.
Harry saw the man's nervous movement as Malfoy turned away. Andrews took a deep breath, as though to steady himself.
They were halfway to the room Harry remembered interrogating Malfoy in when they heard the boom of an explosion in the distance. It was strong enough to shake the house around them. Harry spun immediately towards the sound, cursing as he saw Draco move the opposite direction, a light at the end of the corridor flickering into existence and then disappearing just as quickly.
'John has been perfectly pleasant, so drop your fucking spell and your attitude. I have a lot riding on tonight and I don't need your prejudices ruining it for me.'
The look on Draco's face was so genuine and so filled with joy and satisfaction, that Harry felt himself responding before he could talk himself out of it. He leaned forward and his broom scooted the last little distance alongside Draco's until their thighs were pressed against each other and they were inches apart. Draco caught his breath at the movement, eyes widening in surprise, but he didn't pull away.
, stripped naked, but with no obvious cause of death. They'd have ruled it an Avada, but for the look of terror on her face and the circle of raw skin on her chest, as though something had been cut away.
'Seriously though,' Ron said, putting his chopsticks down. 'Do you think he's involved? I know I said Robards wasn't interested in him for investigation but the damage tally is pretty grim. They had half a dozen hospitalisations from the heatwave and the repairs bill from the monsoon is up to half a million Galleons, last I heard. Turns out the worst damage is resistant to repair spells. They're having to bring specialists in.'
Payback came just over an hour later, when his assistant's voice came through his office door. 'Your nine o'clock appointment is commencing now, Mr Potter.'
The first thing he laid eyes on when he entered his workroom was a new case of memories, packed away into little green vials. None of them were labelled, but his name—the made-up one he worked under—was scrawled on the note attached to the top.
'Harry,' Hermione said, her voice shaky and small. 'Just one of those holds fifty times as much power as the time turner I had access to at Hogwarts …' her voice trailed off and then she rushed forward, hugging him tightly.
Draco is indeed downstairs when Harry heads down and there's a plate from the communal cook-up sitting next to him on the bench. Harry glances around to see most of the food is gone. Draco makes no acknowledgement that he saved it for Harry, instead sniffing disdainfully at the mound of food, but Harry makes sure to brush against him lightly as he reaches for the plate. Draco stiffens but doesn't pull away.
Ginny lay back, hair spread across the pillow and Harry rolled on top, guiding himself in. They moved together slowly at first, the room silent apart from Ginny's small sounds of pleasure. Harry had never been particularly vocal during sex, focusing instead on making sure Ginny was enjoying herself as he took his own pleasure.
Harry ran his hands over the box slowly, protectively, as he had done so many times before, in the quiet of his room, tempted by what it contained.
'Colour?' came a composed voice from behind him. It took him a second to pull his scattered thoughts together enough to understand what he was being asked, and to be able to answer it.
Malfoy made to walk back to the lift, but Harry bumped against him. 'So?' he said, a clear follow up on his unanswered question.
He shook his head in response to the question. He knew what Ladon had said in their last session together; he didn't interact sexually with the people he did scenes with. Harry's dream about kissing him was just an overactive imagination on top of an unfulfilled sex drive. That was all. He couldn't do anything that would make Ladon feel uncomfortable with him, or not want to see him again. The thought of this stopping - of not seeing what was next, terrified him ... and he wanted to hear that word again.
Malfoy was in the bottom right corner, dressed in an expensive-looking Muggle suit. His hair was shaved close to the sides but left tousled on top and his face was expressionless, eyes hard. The caption under his name said:
'This thing is like a Slytherin wet dream,' Harry says, and frowns as he hears the low rasp to his voice. He focuses on the garage door opening and the air he needs, to be able to clear the way he and Malfoy smell together from his mind.
Harry leaned against the building, the street dark around him. He slid his hand into his pocket and gripped his wand, casting a disillusionment charm on himself.
Harry varied between walking with Ron and Hermione and with Draco, in both instances not saying much, just watching the kids and helping to answer the myriad questions that came their way. He felt a slight pang that the three of them weren't really interacting, but consoled himself that at least they were in the same space, and their kids seemed to have no issues with each other.
'Right,' Malfoy says, standing up and walking towards the couch. 'Davies has set a meeting tonight at
With that he wrenches his arm forward and Harry loosens his grip to let him go. Malfoy makes for the door, completely ignoring the bouncer on the way in. The man glances at Malfoy but makes no move to stop him. Harry looks back at up the neon sign dubiously. If this is a strip club then Malfoy's type—all flashy and clearly with money to spend—are probably regular fare.
Harry gritted his teeth, looking down at the piece of parchment in his hand. 'I have to stand around watching a bunch of pureblood brats learn about buses?'
He forces himself to make small talk. Just being back on this floor is making him antsy. It's the site of so many of his best and worst memories. Forget second home, this basically
Now … now it seemed that that specific instant was the one playing on repeat in his head - the one he wanted to experience again with an intensity that scared him.
Harry cried out and shuddered, slumping against the wall as his orgasm crashed over him like a wave, ripping itself out of his body. He panted desperately, shuddering his way through it. His movements slowed as he worked his cock loosely, aftershocks rocking through him as he clenched. Finally he groaned in satisfaction. As he gathered his wits, reality came crashing back down. He dropping his hands guiltily, trying to ignore the sensation of emptiness - incompletion. He leaned forward, closing his eyes and trying to catch his breath under the stream of water.
'Thank you, gentlemen, for your participation tonight,' he says with a smile that shows too many teeth. 'To close the evening, we have a beautiful flower to show you. Our Peony is all the way from Wiltshire, gently raised and guaranteed not to be Traced.'
His eye was drawn back to Ladon who stood and reached again, muscles flexing, pale gold in the lights of the stage. He pulled another rope down with understated ease and doubled it, before he knelt again. He was behind her, denim-clad legs bracketing her naked arse. But he made no move to touch - other than to reach forward and lay the center of the rope across her lower back. He tapped her gently on the thigh and she spread her legs. He looped one end of the rope between them and then back out, so it was trailing behind her. Then he did the same to the other.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. 'No, Potter, we're just sitting in it for fun. Now, put your damned seatbelt on.'
He takes a deep breath. He's already decided to do this. He knows the pros and cons. He needs to just get it done.
Harry ignored him, stopping only when he reached the door. He turned back to Draco and his whole body radiated pain and grief.
The atmosphere in the airport was tense. People didn't meet each other's eyes for long, lowering their heads and hurrying past. No one was browsing the shops. Instead, they all looked like they were determined just to get to where they were going, as quickly as possible. Harry slipped between them soundlessly, feeling like he was walking through a world that was separated from theirs, as though he were behind a veil that was more solid than the cloak he wore.
His mind was lost in these thoughts when he sat down at a tiny café that was nothing more than a hole in the wall. He'd forgotten to eat. Again. He ignored the concerned looks the owner was giving him, which probably had a lot to do with that fact that after days without a shower and running on minimal sleep, he looked like one of the Preservation members he'd been hunting. Instead, he lit a fag and pulled the bowl of pasta closer as he cast his eye over the newspaper in front of him. It was written in Czech and he didn't want to use magic to activate his translation charm, so he just glanced at the front page image, wincing at the death toll of dozens that he could make out from the limited Czech he did know.
Malfoy frowns but doesn't argue. Instead he stands and moves to the far corner of the room. He hesitates for a moment and Harry wonders why, then he hears the distinct sound of a zip and a second later the sound of piss hitting the rock floor. Harry looks away, feeling something in his chest twist at this unsought sharing of space.
'Like you can talk,' Harry spits back, pushing away from the wall and advancing on Malfoy. 'You and your blood supremacy. All you care about is purebloods and advancing your own kind.'
'Why I left is none of your fucking business, Malfoy,' Harry says as he pushes to his feet. He's had enough of this conversation. Enough of this dance around Malfoy that leaves him feeling worked up and on edge. He throws Malfoy's words from earlier back at him. 'We're not friends, after all.'
You guys blew me away on the last chapter. I couldn't believe how many gorgeous comments I got. Thank you so, so much.
Harry nodded, he'd seen the Healers' reports. Jones had reviewed them as a part of piecing together the crime scene. Malfoy ran a hand through his hair, sadness clouding his face. 'They're saying she might lose a leg. Did you see her at the ball? She had that exquisite emerald dress on? She
'Whatever you're thinking about Potter, you need to calm the fuck down,' Malfoy says, as he takes a pull of his beer. Harry watches the long lines of his throat and the bob of his Adam's apple as he swallows. He wants to crawl over the table and lick it. He is so fucked.
Harry pushes himself into a standing position and takes a shaky step forward. His leg knocks into something warm and he stumbles, reaching out. He doesn't manage to catch himself and he falls forward as arms reach up to grab at him. He lands badly, twisting so that his back smacks into something hard. Harry cries out at the new flare of pain and feels a hot wetness as blood begins to run down his back again.
Malfoy groans as he stretches and when he lights his wand, he looks more tired than he had before he'd slept.
He holds his breath as Draco's eyes fly open, his fingers closing convulsively on Harry's arms. Then Draco reaches into his shirt to touch his wand and the glamour is gone and his fingers slide into Harry's hair.
Harry nods again and lets Malfoy pull him towards the door. He wants to feel embarrassed by his weakness, but all he can think is that Malfoy is calm and Malfoy knows what he's doing and Malfoy can be trusted. He can feel the wolf inside him rumbling its agreement and its pleasure at being close to the one who smells right. The wolf wants to lie at his side and curl itself around Malfoy. It wants to protect him from anyone who dares to touch him.
'This change is a bad one, but it is one they have seen before,' Jakub said, looking up at the dark canopy of the huge old oak above them.
Mac opened her mouth, as though to argue, but something she saw in Harry's face must have convinced her not to. She merely turned slightly towards Blake, who had come up to them as they spoke, and nodded.
Blaise hummed noncommittally. 'You did some pretty bad things to him in school, too. Seems like he's forgiven you for those.'
Harry looks at him, not understanding. Malfoy rolls his eyes in exasperation. 'I prefer cocks, Potter, not that it's any of your business. Owning women and selling them for the pleasure of men is very much not a space I play in.'
Theonsfavouritetoy, who gave me the inspo for one of the significant characters and significant sites in this ch and then enjoyed very much what I did with it.
Harry huffed in annoyance. 'I told him I knew it was him and that he was doing it on purpose and that I was going to take him to the Aurors. Then he bloody did something that trapped me inside a blizzard and ran off.'
He sighed, his anger leaving him all of a sudden. It took too much energy to stay angry. All of his emotions were like this at the moment - surging up in him like a storm and then fading away so that he felt hollow - adrift.
He made his way out of the pub, walking through the streets of the town, keeping his eye out for a shock of brightly coloured hair that would lead him to Teddy. He thought as he walked, wondering what was really behind Malfoy's offer of the memories. He wondered if he should turn them in as evidence.
Harry settles himself in bed, letting the darkness and the quietness of the room around him soothe him. He's so tired and he can feel sleep pulling at him. It always takes him a few days after a full moon to shake off the exhaustion.
Harry pretended to think for a minute. 'Oh, I don't know. Maybe I could talk to my uncle about you having some alone time with his library?'
Harry's mind stuttered, fixed on the word that had just left Ladon's mouth. He felt an ache in his chest. No one ever called him that, just let it tumble easily from their lips. He wanted to hear it again.
Harry stared at him, breath coming more quickly, and Draco smiled. It held a hint of a playful cruelty that spiked something in Harry.
Harry moved closer to Draco, the closest he'd come to the squid so far. He reached for the tentacle in Draco's mouth, tugging it free so that it dropped lower, curling around his throat, its grip tightening so that it was suddenly harder to breathe.
'Your testimony,' Malfoy confirmed, pushing himself gracefully to his feet and letting his shirt slide off his shoulders, falling behind him. 'America is on the brink of war. You are beset by dangers within and without.' Malfoy moved his hands to the buckle of his belt and drew it out slowly, watching Andrew as a hawk might watch a rabbit.
Harry's heart sank as he saw Marchbanks considering it, her eyes moving to Draco's still form. Finally she gave a single nod. Harry forced himself not to push his way up there, drag Draco from the stand and tell them all they could be damned. He forced himself to take a breath. Draco would be okay. He knew how to handle himself.
The door in front of them was cream with gold inlay and the plaque on the door proclaimed the significance of the space in flowing etching. Andrews reached for the ornate handle, pushing it open to reveal an entryway, done in the same cream and gold, wall sconces and chandeliers lighting the space. A huge silver vase displayed a bouquet of lilies on a table in the centre of the entrance. Harry could hear the lilting sounds of piano music coming from somewhere inside. The sound tugged at him, catching at something in his memory, just out of reach.
Draco takes a step closer and Harry sees something rising in his eyes, the same look he'd had the night they'd kissed. He feels panic run through him. Draco can't be involved with him. He'll get hurt. It's too dangerous.
But Ron spoke before he could, coming over to kneel beside the table, leaning gently against Harry's side as he said, 'People can be sad about lots of things, Rosie. Maybe Uncle Harry has an owie. Or maybe he read a sad story. Or maybe something happened to make him sad. You know what the most important thing is?'
'Harry,' Ladon said again, softly, eyes on his mouth. 'There - I have to tell you something. It's - it's important.'
Malfoy's return smile didn't quite reach his eyes. 'Good news,' he said as he turned to leave. 'Good to hear. I'll send the list through this afternoon, Potter.'
Potter snorts. 'Give off, Malfoy. If anyone's operating under false pretences, it's you. I saw you the other night, at the Lion. What did you have on that bloke? What's with the hooker act?'
Harry sat down opposite her. 'Right. Um - there's something. I - it happened a few days ago but you've been out and I've been - and I mean -'
'You have seen the promised world. The world without war, without conflict, without the resources of the earth being consumed by hungry hordes, always starving for more.'
Hermione hummed in thought. 'You said he was particularly hard to find the first time, didn't you?' she asked, looking over at Harry. He nodded, remembering the way no one around him had put any significance on the appearance of a skinny figure with crazy hair and flapping black robes.
Harry pulled back, licking his lips, and Seamus dropped him a quick wink. Harry smiled at him and then shuffled back into his seat. He looked around the circle, stopping at Malfoy. His eyes were lowered to the bottle in his hand, as though he hadn't paid any attention to the kiss, but there was a faint blush of red in his cheeks that Harry thought told a different story. He felt something uncurl in his chest in satisfaction at that thought. He tried not to examine the sensation too closely.
Harry tried not to react to the way Draco's eyes widened slightly, or the way his gaze dropped - an infinitesimal flicker towards Harry's lips before he pulled his expression into his customarily annoyed scowl.
He brushes against the bare, vulnerable throat in front of him. He could tear it out in an instant, he knows. Hot blood spraying into the darkness. Instead he nudges it, rubbing his shaggy fur against the skin. He draws back for a second and sniffs.
He was clearer, now that he'd had more than an hour or two of sleep. He could see where he'd gone wrong. He didn't have enough information, that was the problem. Perhaps he shouldn't have burned Robards' note. He pulled himself from the bed, slipping on whatever clothes he could reach the easiest. His robes were in a heap on the floor and they smelled like the self-cleaning charm had given out, but Harry couldn't bring himself to give a shit.
'Malfoy,' he called, over the crunching run of their footsteps on the gravel drive. 'Malfoy.' Then, 'Damnit, Draco.
He drew in a deep, shuddering breath and tried to focus on slowing his heartbeat. He opened his eyes and rolled to his back, grimacing at the wetness in his pants. He glanced around the room, the same one he'd just dreamt in, somehow expecting to see Malfoy there with him, but the room was empty.
. He forces himself to think of what this means, to see Malfoy in front of him; of what he should do with that. He forces the creature inside him to
He decides to push it just a little bit further. 'I mean you no harm, Malfoy. We're grown men now, and anything that was in the past between us is dead and gone. Look, fresh start.'
Harry breathed in and cupped Draco's cheek, pulling him closer, deepening the kiss as he tilted his head. Draco answered him immediately, his other hand moving to Harry's back, pulling them flush against each other. Harry moaned lightly at the sensation - at Draco's body against his, mouth against his. After so long, for this to be happening … it felt familiar and at the same time, so new, as if this was the first time. And it was, in some ways. It was the first time he'd known he was kissing Draco - had wanted Draco to be the one in his arms.
His eyes travelled lower, even as he told himself this was wrong. He shouldn't be watching it. Malfoy - Malfoy could do it, but Harry shouldn't watch, shouldn't even think about it. That was Aunt Petunia's voice in his head, he knew, even after so many attempts to banish her.
Draco looked across at her, incredulous. 'There's nothing to bloody give up. Aren't you listening? It's over.'
It takes them a day to get back to London. Malfoy swaps cars again, and Harry wonders just how many of the bloody things he has standing around. He parks near an Apparition point Harry has used before, and reaches into his suitcase to pull out a vial of Polyjuice and a small case containing around twenty labelled jars. He sorts through them quickly before pulling out one labelled 17 and shaking a hair onto his palm.
Gods, but he was tired. Draco's house was warm. It felt friendly. Lived in. It made him realise he hadn’t been to see Ron and Hermione since he'd ended up in St Mungo's a few days ago. He resolved to go by Hermione's office soon, and tee up a time to visit them. He'd have to arrange a day off at some point too. He was rostered twelve days straight. Maybe after that.
'Not just fucking though, Pans,' he said. 'We're friends, outside the club. We - we went to the aquarium today. With Scorpius and Harry's friends and -'
By the end of the forum, his shoulders were aching and he had a tension headache from gritting his teeth and forcing himself to play the game, rather than tell the lot of them they were blind fools who were putting the entire community at risk. Of all the proposals he'd heard, the only one he'd agreed with had been the Oceanian Coalition's proposal of increased cooperation between Aurors and other key Ministry Departments to ensure resources weren't diverted into pursuing leads that other staff already held information on, but were too inward-focused to share.
He started with the ones he knew would be approved and which Javier could just have signed off if he wasn't a monumental prat, determined at every point to undermine Harry's ability to do his job.
For a moment, Harry simply enjoys the fact that Draco is back to his normal level of scathing observation. He's been softer all day, as though he feels like Harry needs to be treated gently. He hasn't minded that, but there's something about Draco's Malfoy-voice that makes him feel even more comfortable than the softness had. He wonders what that says about him and decides not to examine it too closely.
fighting, even though the Dark Lord had all but won. And then you escaped again, and -' Draco fixed Harry with an intense gaze. 'Suddenly I knew. Harry Potter was going to win the war.' Draco looked away and his next words were so soft Harry almost didn't catch them. 'Sometimes I think that was the only reason I kept going.'
Harry stepped back a pace and grabbed the back of Rick's t-shirt, pulling him vertical and then slamming him back down so that his head hit the table in front of him and he slumped to the floor.
Harry can see the resolve in his eyes. Malfoy's heartbeat is absolutely steady. He isn't bluffing. He's ready to cut his losses.
'What happened?' Harry asked, interrupting Ron, aware there was panic in his voice but unable to stop it.
Harry thought about it for a moment - thought about what he'd seen laid out on that table, and shivered at the idea. It was a shiver of dread … and of anticipation. He remembered the sting of the lash, and the beautiful, bone-deep ache he'd felt for days. The sensation that had kept him grounded, reminded him he was still inside his own skin, not scattered across the world.
Ladon's smile grew. He pushed the end of the collar through the buckle and pulled it until it was snug enough that Harry could feel it, but not so tight that it was restricting his breathing. He raised a hand to touch it, and shivered slightly at the look of heat in Ladon's eyes as he ran his fingertips across it.
charm when one of the animals looked interested in heading his way. Harry wondered if this was how the airport always was, or if the Muggles were reacting to the increasingly severe reports of violence and unrest on the news. Everywhere he looked he could see TV screens and newspaper headlines screaming about the rise in death and destruction.
Ladon's face changed, though Harry couldn't read the expressions that crossed it in quick succession.
Lucius leaned forward. 'They're dangerous. They outnumber us a hundred thousand to one. They have science and technology, moving far faster than we realised. I have read of it. They have these 'bombs' that can do more damage than any of our curses. They are dangerous to all of us. It is imperative that wizardkind recognises this danger and acts on it.'
'Fuck,' Harry gasped, his movement on Draco's cock slowing. Draco pulled back slightly, blowing on the sensitive head, Harry's foreskin fully retracted, watching how he jerked and shuddered. Then he leaned in, enclosing Harry in the heat of his mouth.
'A beer would be great, thanks,' Harry said, shrugging out of his robes and hanging them over the arm of the chair, before sinking into the couch with another deep sigh, and closing his eyes.
The Kraken's tentacles undulated across the DeathKeeper's arms again, but Harry didn't wait to watch the effect. He turned back to the room, taking one last drag on his smoke before he vanished it and got to work.
'Enough,' Conor said quietly, and she subsided, shutting her mouth with a snap and glaring at Harry with crossed arms.
Harry pushed his way through the crowd. It was closely packed and he had to hold his invisibility cloak tightly around him. The people he shoved looked accusingly at each other and minor scuffles broke out in his wake. Harry ignored them. He only had eyes for one person—the woman standing on the thin stone edge above the entry arch of the Saint Vitus Cathedral.
Harry gathered more memories to himself, the ones he'd locked away, so many years ago. He put aside his hurt and his anguish and he forced himself to only remember the good. He looked into Draco's face and thought about holding him, dancing with him, flying against him.
Jones hesitated, 'You said Malfoy gave you the names? What makes you think they're legit. He doesn't have the best … past.'
Luna looked across at him, eyes not focusing in the right place. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'Many times. My father consulted with them often on his journey for the truth of the Hallows.'
'You like to watch then?' Ladon asked, raising an elegant eyebrow. He continued before Harry could respond. 'That would make sense given your … profession. Undertaken many stakeouts, have you Mr. Potter? Watched through the curtains as your criminal bent his wife over the kitchen table? Listened as she told him she wanted it harder. Deeper -'
Draco's face was going from angry to upset, as he flicked the quill in his hands against his fingers. Harry stood up and crossed the room to him, leaning back against the desk beside him. Draco leaned his chair back slightly to look up at Harry.
, his traitorous mind supplied. Malfoy was the very picture of elegance and confidence as he whirled and stepped, never missing a beat. He made an arresting sight, and, looking around, Harry realised he wasn't the only one watching.
to know how Harry would feel under his hands. He flushed slightly at the memory and pulled his hand away, looking down and straightening his robes before sitting. When he looked back up, Harry was watching him, head cocked slightly to one side as though studying an interesting case. Draco mentally pulled himself together. He wasn't a fifteen year old with a crush anymore. He might have only had feelings like this two or three times in his life, but that didn't mean he couldn't be an adult about them.
'We can't. We have no idea what sort of connections the people who came after you have. They could have someone at St Mungo's. If I have—' Harry draws in a pained breath and tilts his head into Malfoys neck, so that his lips are almost brushing Malfoy's skin. He breathes in again and lets the scent calm him slightly.
Somehow that small fact, more than anything else, was the crack that opened the door to his pain. He felt it rush into him, a wave that threatened to drown him with its force. Harry had left him. He had lied to Harry, and Harry had left him and now he couldn't even think.
Harry spent the morning wandering through the market, watching the slightly-overwhelmed looking group of witches and wizards, and taking in the sights and sounds and smells all around him. The excursion seemed to be going reasonably well. His team had had to put a some subtle
Nightmares woke him just before dawn. He'd been back in the chapel, surrounded by the bones. He could still remember every detail of it, as though he'd been reliving it, looking at it from all angles. Then the dream had changed, and the bones had changed and he had known, all of a sudden, that it was James he was seeing, James' bones he was facing. James dead fifty thousand times over, blank eyes staring at him, skeletal fingers reaching for him.
Jayne led him into a sitting room, gesturing him to a chair and then sitting opposite him. A tea set was laid out on a table between them, wisps of steam rising from the pot.
'I'm not doing anything to myself,' Harry said, anger stirring in him. 'I know something is wrong with all of this. That thing shouldn't have been able to get inside. Someone must have let it in.'
He pushed himself out of the beanbag, kneeling in front of it. If Malfoy didn't want to chicken out, he would have to come to Harry.
'Bondage, restraints, impact - broad range.' He nodded as his eyes scrolled. 'Makes sense with how well you responded last time.'
Harry shot a glance across at him at the sounds of the melodious words falling from Malfoy's lips. Was that
Harry shrugged, seeing no point in denying it. He had watched Draco, though not for the same reasons he did now.
Harry steps up to the podium and takes a deep breath as he looks out at the assembled crowd. His nerves are buzzing and he feels his wolf pacing restlessly. He can hear the other crowd outside the Ministry doors, the protestors, the families of those taken by the wolves. Their mood is ugly. Angry. He tries to block them out. Draco had known, when he'd written the article so long ago, that it wouldn't be an easy road. To be here at all was a miracle.
wolf,' Harry says slowly, looking up at the moon. 'It's inside me, but it's not me. It feels like it's a totally different creature. This thing that was done to me, that's ruined my life.' His tone becomes bitter as he speaks, and he realises that he's thought these words a million times, but has never said them out loud. He hasn't wanted to bother anyone by adding his self-pity to their list of Harry-related things to worry about.
Harry walks further into the room, deliberately taking his time now as he looks around, studying everything with over the top interest.
Ladon moved behind him and Harry felt the brush of the silk shirt Ladon was wearing against his back and shoulders as Ladon reached around to wrap the blindfold over Harry's eyes. He shivered slightly at the sensation against his exposed skin.
'I don't want to be the full me, anyway. Every character I play is a part of me, in some way, a facet of my personality given life.'
He stumbles slightly when they stop, his hip flaring with the agony of the fact that he's landed heavily and jarred it. They're standing in the living room of their apartment at the Marriott. Harry feels the snap of the anti-Apparition wards go back up around him and then he realises he's touching Malfoy—leaning into him—and that the fresh, clean scent of Malfoy is in his nose. He breathes it in, unable to stop himself.
It's only when Harry tries to stand that he realises how much blood he's lost. It's soaked through the field patch he'd put on in the apartment. The entire seat is sticky with it, and it's pooled beneath him. His arm feels heavy as he grips the door, trying to pull his legs around. His body doesn't seem to want to respond, but he forces himself to move, to climb out of the car. He slumps against the side of it, resting his head on it and closing his eyes, just for a moment.
Harry grimaced. He almost hadn't recognised himself in the mirror that morning. Always thin, he was now nearly skeletal. His skin was a faint grey and he had deep circles under his eyes. He'd forced himself to eat breakfast that morning on the way in. Two pieces of toast with his coffee.
Harry rubbed his thumb over his own absent wedding band, and tried not to hope. So far their letters had been those of friends. Friends with a past, but friends.
'What does it mean?' Harry asked sleepily, curling against Draco's naked chest as he listened to the quiet words.
Harry looked at Draco and thought about trust, about the things he had been talking through with Jayne. He thought about that part of himself that didn't trust anyone else. About the way he'd wondered whether part of the reason he'd married Ginny was that he didn’t trust that the Weasleys would still consider him one of them unless he became a part of their family.
Harry looked across at Draco, but he was locked in a battle of wills with Lucius, who had turned in his seat to stare his son down. Harry could see the side of his face. His sneer.
Hermione nodded her agreement. 'I imagine the system is just a scaled up version of the spells used to heat and cool magical homes. I wouldn't think it would be too difficult to fix.'
Davies' glance flicks to Harry and Harry can tell the mixed messages Malfoy is sending him are confusing him.
'How do you stop them?' Harry said again, pulling out his smokes and lighting another one up. He knew the words came across as noncommittal, but he had nothing more than that to give at this point. The idea that he could stop
Harry just laughed. 'It's the Burrow. There'll be people everywhere. No one is going to notice whether I've arrived on time, trust me.'
'Same for you,' Harry returned, unsure how to respond. He took a sip of his drink as he considered. 'I didn't realize you were a part of all this,' he said at last, waving his hand to indicate the room.
'The ropes,' Harry said. 'That first night, I saw you on the stage, with the ropes. I want that. Please.'
'Fuck,' Harry said in return, his hand working faster as he gripped Draco's shoulder, arching his back as he bobbed back down. 'Fuck, me too. I'm so close.'
Harry watches from the shadows, an Auror-strength Disillusionment Charm on himself, as Malfoy mingles among the people who live in the corners of Knockturn Alley. Several greet him by name—the wrong name, but still by name—and it's clear he's been here, has worn this face here, before.
, in a way that he knew would cast the light over his features and glimmer through his hair. Mrs Fawley had been the dragon at this afternoon's soiree, but if he played his cards right, he might net himself a few plimpies as well.
'Should we try and contact Davies again?' Harry asks as they're packing everything up. He doesn't want to. The idea of going anywhere near Davies again makes a possessive anger stir deep in Harry's chest, but he could still be useful as a lead.
War's face twisted at that, and it reached behind itself, as though reaching for the hilt of a sword that wasn't there.
'What's wrong?' Ladon asked, taking a seat at the other end of the couch and watching him carefully. There was something in his regard that pulled another layer of calm over Harry, allowed him to take a breath. He could tell Ladon. After all, he'd told him so much worse.
'I believe the upcoming campaigns are around Extension of Wizarding Law Protections to Sentient Magical Creatures and Muggle-Magical Educational Reform. But I would certainly be happy to put you in touch with the Board if you wanted to discuss other causes with them.'
Harry frowns, uncomfortable with Malfoy having that level of intimate knowledge about him. Sneaky bastard must have copied his signature when he unravelled the tracker.
Malfoy nodded once, still not meeting Harry's eyes, and moved to sit opposite Harry, clearing an extendable containment field off the chair before he did.
I let his words wash over me. I know all about a predestined life. I know all about the freedom of getting to choose, as well, to define who you are for yourself. My choices might be shit ones, but at least they're mine.
hunted him for sport, for some sick sense of pack dominance over a boy that smelt like a wolf but couldn't shift.' His voice catches on the last word and he has to stop, sucking in a breath and turning away.
'To living,' Harry echoes and tilts his head back, letting the warm burn of the whisky flow down his throat.
'What's gotten into you?' Draco tried, with some of Charlie's laughter in his voice. Potter was not always a happy drunk. In all the memories Draco had been given, Potter was having a good time, of course. But Draco had memories of his own, of watching Potter from the shadows as he drowned his sorrows alone in some Muggle bar. He had clippings as well, from articles where Potter's propensity for hard drink followed by an angry outburst had caught up with him.
'Yes, Chief Warlock,' he said clearly, hands clasped loosely in front of him. He focused on the top file, sending it floating wandlessly and wordlessly to Marchbanks' seat, duplicating it in midair to send a copy to the Court Scribe. He heard a murmur from the gallery at his casual use of wandless magic and mentally ticked one point to himself. If he had to be Harry fucking
Malfoy smiled again, that razor-sharp smile. 'General Andrews,' he said, his eyes dark. 'The sweetest of wins are the ones where we have the most to lose, are they not?'
'I'm going to do something very stupid now, Harry,' his mate says and Wolf whines at his lack of comprehension, leaning in to rub himself against the man again.
'I've been thinking about this so much,' Harry whispered. Draco's hands clenched helplessly against Harry's hips as he fought to get himself under control. He needed to be in charge. That was what Harry liked. He wanted to give Harry what he liked.
Harry focused for a moment, not bothering with his wand. Not bothering to speak. He called four chairs to life in front of Malfoy, satisfaction curling in him at the look of fleeting surprise on the man's face. Malfoy hid it quickly, but he'd been shocked by the demonstration of Harry's power. Good. He wanted the man as off-balance as he could get him.
'What makes you say that?' Harry asked, surprised by the words, he'd have thought it would be the opposite, with Malfoy.
Wolf's vision goes red with rage and he feels a white-hot fury rise up in him, coming from somewhere deep in his mind.
He feels Draco's thumb rub across his cheekbone and then Draco is leaning in and Harry is catching his breath and he can hear Draco's heart pounding, and his isn't far behind.
Harry sighed and rubbed his fingers over the embroidered rose pattern of the chair. He looked up a moment later as Ron came padding down the stairs, stopping in surprise when he saw Harry. He looked ready for bed too, in flannel pyjamas and a sleeveless top. Harry felt his guilt increase when a smile crossed Ron's face.
Ginny looked over with a smile and nodded. 'Coming, Harry?' she asked as she took a step into the room.
The power flooded from Harry and into the symbol hanging in the air in front of him, so that it shone like the sun.
Draco dropped his bag to the ground inside Pansy's bedroom door and went to kick his shoes off. He looked down. With dull surprise he realised he hadn't put any on when he'd left his house.
Now, a huge thank you my amazing crew of betas who I dumped a 33 (now 38k)K chapter on (sorry!) and who picked up an embarrassing number of typos, whipped my commas into shape and asked me all sorts of things that expanded this into a much better chapter <3
Harry focuses on Malfoy's touch and not on the instincts inside him that are screaming at him to fight. To attack. To defend what's
'I decided I needed to disappear after I had a visit to my shithole rented flat,' Malfoy continues, his voice flat, emotionless, 'from one of the Auror force's finest. You probably remember him—Jeffries? There was a picture of him and you in the paper once. You looked chummy enough.'
She was seated at the kitchen table when he entered and she glanced up with a brief smile before returning to the copy of the newspaper in front of her.
At that Jeffries looked even more torn. 'I can't let you in,' he said. 'It's an active crime scene.'
'Things with Ginny are still... tense. I didn't want to intrude,' Potter says, as he puts his hands in his lap, cradling the glass between them and hunching his shoulders.
'I can't just think of myself,' Draco said, his voice tinged with a regret he couldn't quite hide. 'I can’t expose my son to something that might not last. It's not fair to him.'
Harry felt his answer deep inside himself before he'd even thought about it. Draco had always been a part of his life one way or another. Harry couldn't push him into this and then abandon him to it.
Harry could feel nerves fluttering through him and he tried to ignore them. He was being ridiculous. He was meeting a five year old, not going up in front of the Wizengamot.
Draco began to find a rhythm. He pushed into Harry's tight, wet heat as Harry ground back down on him. It wasn't long before Harry's hand was on his own cock, pulling it as he gasped out his enjoyment in little moans and pants.
He opened his arms and smiled Charlie's crooked, half-smile, the one Potter couldn't resist melting at the sight of in every one of his memories.
He knows what Malfoy is seeing. His hair is losing its mousy brownness, reverting to the black tangle he sees every morning in the mirror. His eyes are bright green again, no longer hidden behind the glasses he has no need for anymore.
It was late when Harry got back to his room. The streets were almost empty as he rode back through the city. No one wanted to be out after dark, nowadays. He parked his bike and disillusioned it before he headed upstairs, his mind still full of everything he'd seen at the Ossuary. He'd barely paid attention on his ride home, instead he'd played Daniela's words through his mind over and over again, trying to make sense of them.
He picks up the brochure Harry's put on the small kitchen bench and flips it open, frowning. 'We're going to miss the last tour,' he says. 'So we'll have to break in. The drop is tomorrow. We need to know if that's the site.'
Daniela drew back with a gasp, though her next words put paid to the idea that the magical reaction was what had startled her.
He sighed and shook his head to clear it. Then he came back to his original thought, to the idea that Ginny had left, while he'd stayed here. 'We didn't - we haven't talked about the house. You shouldn't have to be the one to leave. It's our house, together. If you want, we can figure out some -'
He gasped, stripping his cock faster, shoving a second finger in beside the first and hissing at the burn of it.
Harry feels pride and a buzz of ill-timed arousal flow through him. Damn, but Draco is magnificent. Harry's always had a bit of a thing for competency and Draco goes so far beyond competent that it runs through every part of him. He's a master and Harry suddenly wants him. He can't give this up, can't give
Malfoy turns back to the door and begins casting his charms again. Harry can't continue watching him. It's moving too slowly. He can feel the singing of the moon in his blood. Soon it will be a song he can't resist.
Malfoy keeps up his doddering old Walter Green act until they've Apparated back to the place they left the car. He climbs inside, telling Harry about one time, in his youth, when he'd met a lovely young lass, name of Sally, who he'd thought he might grow old with.
Harry walked into work the next day feeling more relaxed than he had in a long time. Memories of the night before kept running through his mind. What they had done had been different again. Ladon hadn't touched him, not once, but what they had done … He thought of Ladon's voice as he told Harry to strip. To kneel. To wait. He felt arousal flicker through him again.
'Well,' Hermione said. 'It's just that the Reparation Society is actually doing some good work.' She held up her hand to forestall Harry's argument. 'They are, and you shouldn't let Malfoy distract you from that. We just got a million galleon donation from them in support of the Magical Education Squib Exclusion Law Reform Project. Half of it goes to overhauling the laws so that squibs can be educated alongside their magical siblings in advance of attending Hogwarts and the other half goes towards building new facilities to accommodate the increase in students once the law goes through.'
'Balance is what we work for,' Aoife said. 'That woman in Prague, the one who became the host for Conquest. Did you hear her story?' Aoife barely waited for Harry's nod. 'She would have been an agent—a person who is a suitable host for one of the forces. She was working for peace, dedicated her life to it. That would have been why Conquest took her. They like to corrupt the agents who stand against them most strongly. I think the power they get is stronger because of it. I've been tracking agents, you see, over the past several hundred years. Most of them get killed, of course, taken out by one side before the other side can have them, but those who live to be subverted, those are the most interesting ones, and often the most powerful. Those are the ones who can do the real damage.'
He'd taught Blaise that song. He and Blaise had comforted each other with it, after the war. When things had been hard and dark and cold.
Harry hesitated for a moment, glancing around the room. His eyes landed on the closed door to the bedroom, which, thanks to Draco's spellwork, now had something behind it. But he flicked his gaze away again, just as quickly.
He looks surprised for a moment but then he smiles and there's genuine warmth in it. I feel something catch in my chest. He's taken the leather jacket off, what a stupid thing to wear inside your own house. I don't know who he was trying to impress with it. Though he did look alright in it, I suppose, in a grungy sort of way.
Its tentacles twisted sinuously around and around, never stopping their movement. Draco dropped the Invisibility Cloak to the ground and then set his shoulders. He lifted his hands to his jacket, undoing the buttons with trembling fingers before slipping it to the floor.
exactly, but something to change between you two. You seem like you've been drifting apart for a while. But … you never wanted to talk about it. And Ginny didn't either and I haven't known what to do. And I've just hated seeing you both so miserable, Harry.'
Harry gritted his teeth at the memory - at his struggle to force himself to play politics to try get what he wanted in the long term.
When they stepped out of the Floo, Harry blinked in surprise. He didn't know what he'd imagined - somewhere dark and cold and steeped in evil, maybe. Whatever it was … it wasn't this. They'd entered into a large foyer, which was brightly lit by the warm light of hundreds of white candles. The air smelled of beeswax and trees - evergreen boughs decorated the walls and doors. There were half a dozen other people gathered in the foyer, all dressed in bright colours and opulent fabrics, dripping with jewels. It seemed Malfoy's theme was a hit - if wizards couldn't get modern Muggle clothing right, they didn’t seem to struggle too much with the medieval type.
Draco's smile sharpens as he brings his other hand up to clasp Rothwell's as well. 'Indeed. Terrible shame he met his end in such a gruesome fashion.'
Lucius didn't move in response to Draco's entry, merely watched them, a coolly amused look on his face.
'No, that's all,' he said, slipping off the stool and giving a bit of a wave as he walked towards the exit.
Still, it explained why the stupidity was continuing. Harry had cancelled or diverted all his upcoming cases. The people who worked in the Ministry might be daft enough to keep coming in, but that didn't mean he had to subject creatures to the extreme temperatures. Besides, with no active cases on, and provided he turned one or two reports into Jefferson each day, Harry's time was freed up to allow him to get to the bottom of just what was going on.
Harry shrugged, refusing to be drawn in. 'You told me I was a Catalyst. You told me I'd "know" if I was close enough. I'm telling you, I was close enough. Believe me, or waste more time trying to figure it out yourself. It's not him.'
Veritas has broken stories on illegal potions testing on house elves, bribes at the highest Wizengamot levels, outdated and inhuman sedation practices in the Janus Thickey ward at St Mungo's.
Malfoy makes a sound of frustration, but he complies. He places the pad of fabric against Harry's back, resting it there for a moment as he transfigures his shirt into bandages. He moves closer to Harry and begins wrapping them around his waist, his arms coming around Harry as he moves.
'Maybe we could do a scene on the public stage one day, get you some polyjuice if you're worried about someone recognising you ...' The voice was warm and Ladon looked interested in the idea.
He looked down at Daniela, who was just picking herself up off the ground. The neck of her robe was open and Harry's eyes narrowed as he took in her appearance, his response to the explosion fading in the face of what her dishevelled state revealed.
'Sorry,' Harry said, though he wasn't. He looked Malfoy up and down, surprised to see the usually impeccably dressed man looking so casual. The look suited him, he thought. Malfoy seemed more … approachable like this. Harry's eyes lingered on the way the t-shirt clung to his chest and showed biceps that were more defined than he'd thought they would be … not that he'd thought about Malfoy's biceps.
He knew it and still he pulled Malfoy's face down to his. Malfoy's mouth was hot and bitter. He tasted like whatever he had been drinking. His kiss was hard. There was no give in him and Harry immediately responded, opening his mouth to Malfoy's tongue and feeling desire flow through him. He closed his eyes and focussed on touch - on the feeling of Malfoy's body against his, on the movement of their mouths as they fought back and forth. Malfoy's hands on his arse were hard as well, gripping him and grinding him closer.
'Do you know when I decided to leave, Potter?' Malfoy says, and he turns to look at Harry. His face is hard, something brittle in his gaze.
'Why are you so calm?' Harry asked, sitting automatically. 'You've been raided, you're under surveillance and you've had two visits from undercover Aurors.'
'No,' Harry repeated, pushing his chair back and standing. 'No way am I meeting with that slippery, devious, two-faced -'
'Old guy's got Alzheimer's, I think,' Harry says. 'I came across him on the current job I'm running. I think he has some info I need to help protect my client, but I can't get him to tell it to me straight.'
. Besides, he wasn't quite sure if the offer to fly together was such a great idea, though something in him yearned to really challenge himself against Malfoy again.
'Unless the Catalyst that faces them is exceptionally powerful, if we don't get them at the start of their power, we need to wait until they need to burn themselves out,' Conor said grimly.
Harry brought a hand up to Draco's face, stroking it in a reassuring gesture. Draco forced himself to focus on that touch as he struggled to pull his breathing back under control.
Scorpius frowned. 'Not Papa comes all the time. He hurt me and Papa cried for it.' Scorpius cuddled his bear close to his chest.
doing here.' Malfoy's gaze was implacable and Harry closed his eyes as he felt Malfoy's fingers in his mind again, shifting and sorting. Then he was drinking. Smoking. Gaming. Checking the archives and thinking. Always thinking about Malfoy.
Draco nodded, before he could help himself, then stopped. Pansy's ministrations paused for a moment as her eyes widened, then she continued, silently.
'I'm fine,' Harry said again, realising as thoughts and fears churned inside him, how far from fine he really was. He could feel his heart begin to beat faster again. Having Ron and Hermione right in front of him, looking at him like he'd somehow let them down, wasn't helping in the slightest. He reached for his smokes and lit one, sucking back on it and trying to let the nicotine calm him slightly. It didn't work. But it gave him something to do with his hands, something to do aside from feel guilty over the hurt radiating from his two best friends.
sprinkled all over the country. Malfoy had always had a thing for sneaking around the place and spying.
'You're not going to distract me with sex,' Harry says, trying to sound firm, but unable to stop the rasp in his voice.
'Yes, Potter,' Malfoy says with an eye roll. 'I know. I've done this many times, with exactly zero input from you.'
'So what do you need me to do?' he said, wanting to get back to the job at hand, to get paid and to leave this strangely unsettling place.
'You ready?' Malfoy asks, standing and shrinking the papers down to put them in his pocket. He spells his glamour back on and Harry nods as he approaches.
'Nothing here interests me,' Malfoy says, in a tone of supreme boredom. He reaches up to where Davies is still standing behind him, leaning down over his chair. Malfoy places his hand on Davies' face, turning the wolf's head back towards him. Davies' gaze leaves Harry's and he looks down at Malfoy.
Harry landed in the alley outside of Cherry Dick's. It wasn't one of his favourite bars - he'd only walked in there for the first time because he and Ron had been wasted and the name of it had made them laugh so much they'd nearly vomited. But it was cheap and Muggle, which meant he didn’t generally have to Polyjuice. Plus, it opened at eleven in the morning, meaning he could pre-game while he waited for one of the clubs he preferred to open.
'You don't have to believe in it for it to be real,' said Aoife, the words bursting from her as though she'd been holding her tongue. 'I've been working here for the past twenty years, watching the world shape and change, watching it get ready for the next cycle. Whether you believe something is directing these changes or not, the fact remains they occur and we're entering the next big one. The question is what are you going to do to help stop what you caused?' She was breathing faster when she finished and there was a scowl on her face.
Malfoy is watching him, face impassive, and Harry thinks of a second consideration: the little matter of what Malfoy knows now, and who he might tell. He considers for a second casting an
Something about Malfoy seemed strangely familiar. Harry watched him a moment longer until the memory popped into his mind and then he almost snorted. Malfoy reminded him of the Peruvian Vipertooth he'd caught the year before last. It had been a tiny thing, all spitting venom and swiping claws. Something about it had just screamed that it needed protecting, but didn't know how to stop fighting.
Harry focussed back on the details in front of him. He wanted to remember, and at the same time he needed to forget. He took another drink, a bitter twist to his lips. Funny that. Just one more way for his life to fuck him over—to hurt him as much as it could. He was Harry Potter, after all. He'd chosen to come back from the dead, to come back for more. He could take it, couldn't he?
It's not until the scar flashes back into view that Malfoy seems to believe what's in front of his eyes. His mouth drops open, his grip slackening on his wand.
Harry worked slowly and methodically, Felix letting him know he had all the time in the world. He rolled the man against the building and disillusioned his unconscious form. Then he transfigured Edgar's clothes into a reasonable imitation of what the other man had been wearing and withdrew a vial from his own pocket.
'I got your note,' Ron said. 'If it was that bad, you should have told us. We could have brought over a casserole or something, kept you company.'
'Great,' Harry said standing up and throwing the towel in the direction of Draco's hamper. Pansy rolled her eyes at the two of them. 'I'll finish getting your son ready, will I Draco?'
Until Mrs. Norris pointed to the overflowing mounds of paperwork on his desk, then pulled out a sheet from the middle of it and handed it to him with a grim, 'Welcome back, Mr. Potter.'
Harry was lost for a moment, trying to take it all in, but then Malfoy was there, appearing beside him and wrapping an arm around his shoulder. Harry flinched at his sudden appearance, but Malfoy just hushed him.
'Where's the knife?' Malfoy says, and Harry opens his eyes and turns to look at him, faint confusion tugging at him. He tries to think what he did with the knife. He pulled it out of his back, and he had it in his hand.
Each of the seals had the name of the force they worked against written next to them, with words below that looked like some sort of invocation.
Harry watched Draco speaking softly, face pensive. 'It changed, over time. I realised it wasn't just about control for me - that was what I'd wanted my whole life; power and control, and all it did was almost destroy me. Instead,' he looked at Harry, and there was regret and pain in his eyes. 'Instead I realised what I wanted was trust and safety and the chance to create a space where we could both let go.'
Malfoy waved him into a chair at the table, pouring him a glass of white before putting the bottle back in the fridge. Harry resolutely did not watch.
'Have you ever done this before?' Draco asked, looking down at Harry again. Harry had his eyes closed, as if he was thinking of nothing more than what he was doing to Draco. He opened them at Draco's words and shook his head, his mouth not leaving Draco's cock.
Harry sits back in his seat, crossing his arms as he considers the offer, turning it over in his mind. He'll have to check the bond independently of course, make sure it does what Malfoy said and nothing else, but if Malfoy accepts him taking a bond as a sign of his goodwill, it will give him the time he needs to build a case.
Harry snorted to himself. Of course they hadn't. Malfoy might be a bastard, but he wasn't an idiot. He never had been.
'What you are doing right now is wrong,' Malfoy said, voice hard and certain. 'It might make you feel big and strong but it's
'Do you want me to bugger off?' he asked carefully. He hadn't meant to overstay his welcome. His suspicion that Malfoy could be behind this had dissolved days ago. Malfoy had showed no signs of being malicious or deviously interested in doing damage to the Ministry. The thought that Malfoy didn't want him around but had just been tolerating him made Harry feel strangely uncomfortable.
'And what about my son?' Harry asked, his mind coming back to that thought again and again, unable to make the connection as to why James had had to die. 'What does he have to do with all of this?'
Harry was surprised to see how calm the boy was with the creatures crowding around him, but then he realised none of them were coming closer than an arm's length away.
Something in Draco's body changed at those words, becoming harder, more intent. Harry shivered to see it.
Harry's mood changes and anger rushes through him again. Fucking Malfoy. He can't help himself; he's always been a suspicious, judgemental prat. At least the handshake has served its purpose; he's successfully placed the tracking spell on Malfoy. Technically illegal, now that he's no longer an Auror, but as natural as breathing. Now he can figure out where Malfoy goes and what he does whether or not Malfoy agrees to take him on. There's no need to continue trying to be nice to the prick.
Harry felt something cold slide its way into his chest. This—sex with Draco wasn't like this. It was heat and laughter and losing control and pushing and shoving and so much touch he thought he could die from it. It wasn't some cold, passionless thing that Malfoy endured. The sight of it made him feel sick. He couldn't watch it anymore.
The sounds from his side of the room are a perpetual scratching of his pen interspersed with his fingers tapping away at his phone. Malfoy is clearly pissed that Harry was snooping around, but Harry's definitely not going to apologise for it.
'It felt like I knew you,' Harry said, rubbing softly over Draco's stomach, tracing the faint silvery lines of his scars. 'Being able to see you was different, but it felt like I knew your touch.'
Harry flips him a two-fingered V and refills his glass, moving over to the couch and slumping into it with a groan. The whisky burns through his system faster now that he's a were, but it's still left him feeling pleasantly tipsy.
with Draco and he felt a flush of heat run through him that had nothing to do with the flight. Images filled his mind of stripping Draco, touching pale skin and hard muscle, of moving together. Once he'd started thinking about it, he couldn't stop.
Harry turned his thoughts back to what he was doing. The Repair Manual he'd ordered from the Muggle bookshop near the Ministry had arrived the day before and he was sitting on the workbench, the bike uncovered before him, flipping thought it, trying to get his head around the unfamiliar terminology. At least the thing wasn't still filthy with crusty pond water and twelve-year-old mud. The first thing he'd done on uncovering it again was to give it a detailed clean, by hand, rather than a
There was a grunt from Andrews and his arse clenched suddenly as he drove himself up into Malfoy and stilled.
When their lips touch, it's soft and slow and Draco's mouth is warm. Harry breathes in the smell of his skin, almost unconsciously. He feels the wolf press forward within him, rumbling in pleasure.
'Hi Scorpius,' he said. 'I've missed you. Sorry I haven't been around for a while. Your dad told me you're getting good at flying that Slipstream of yours?'
He heard his mother's pleading cry again. Heard her die for him - give her life … just for him. Harry screamed, at last, as the lash bit into his skin. He screamed his pain and the terrible, horrible emptiness inside himself.
seemed to be the gentle urging sent his way. He nodded his head, impressed at the forethought. He assumed it wouldn't do to have people getting drunk in an establishment like this. He imagined it would be easy for someone to go too far - for someone to get hurt.
Harry ignores the ramifications of Malfoy's knowledge—of his clear ability to manipulate werewolf instincts. Malfoy doesn't know about him, and won't find out about him. He has nothing to worry about. He just needs to get better at ignoring the games Malfoy is playing with Davies, that's all.
He stepped closer again, forcing himself to move. Forcing himself to breathe. He had to know. Blood. Blood. Blood. So much blood. Harry's heartbeat was pounding in his ears now. It was all he could hear. He took another step and then another, feeling like he was moving through treacle, like every step took more energy than he possessed.
Archie was in the pirate ship, captaining it, if the faint chatter Harry could hear as the boy talked to himself was anything to go by. He smiled at the three of them, thinking he might take them into Diagon for ice-cream later. It had been a while since he'd visited Fortescue's.
He dropped his gaze to the next set of info, and swallowed the pang of frustration at seeing the same words he'd seen every letter for the last six months.
The 'blue room' was a medium sized room with pale blue walls, which was decorated with couches and low tables. There was a bar in one corner and everything about it spoke of money and taste. Harry felt like he could have been in any other high end club … apart from the artwork. There were half a dozen black and white pieces spread across the walls and he couldn't help the way his eye was drawn from one to another. Each of the subjects was a person, engaging in some act that he could only assume the club provided for. He expected to see pain and agony on their faces … but what he saw instead held his gaze.
Harry crossed his arms, putting his feet out in front of him. 'Everyone keeps asking me that,' he said.
He shrugged. It didn't matter. He unlocked the door and walked in, stopping short as he saw the large sign taped to the banister.
'We support balance,' Daniela said. 'Unfettered life is no less dangerous than unfettered death. We filter the life of this site through the death that surrounds it. We keep both safe.'
Malfoy's hands were on his arse, and then his mouth was and Harry grunted in surprise, biting his lip at the slippery heat and the unfamiliar sensation. After a moment he spread his legs wider to give Malfoy access, and Malfoy hummed his appreciation, fingers tightening on Harry's arse cheeks.
He could feel himself begin to shake, giant tremors rocking through him. He tried to breathe through them but he couldn't catch his breath. Couldn't think.
'Most times,' Draco admitted. 'I couldn't keep Ladon's form when you were responding so beautifully. I couldn't keep my focus enough.' He coughed, embarrassed. 'I think a part of me didn't want it to be a lie, either. It's why I had to keep blindfolding you.'
He watched Draco over Hermione's head. Draco just shook his head, a rueful grin hovering on his lips. 'Fall in love with Harry Potter, they said.'
Malfoy steps up beside him a moment later, directing his attention down to Jonathan, still kneeling on the floor in front of Harry.
'Will the fact that I'm a werewolf become common knowledge?' Harry asks, not sure what he wants the answer to be.
Harry had been avoiding the photos. It was hard enough seeing James' face in his mind's eye, without seeing every perfect detail of him. He looked away, searching for something to put the image in, as he flipped the frame over and peeled the back off. He spotted a copy of
Harry nodded and wordlessly sent a thicker sheaf of papers to her, noting the eyes of the other Wizengamot members as they lingered on the lack of a wand in his hand. He felt a curl of satisfaction as he noted Javier's scowl.
Remus had been the exception, not the norm. If Harry had realised that sooner—had acted sooner to rid the world of werewolves—he could have kept Remus' son alive.
The boy smiled, showing a missing tooth in the front. 'My name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Can you tell me a story about Quidditch? Did you fight a dragon? Teddy said you fought a dragon.'
reveal to Draco Malfoy. He knew what he was doing was wrong. It went against everything he knew and valued about the trusting relationship he built as a dom … but somehow he couldn't stop himself.
He was lost in his thoughts until the bus stopped, its doors opening with a hiss. Pimms stood up, turning around with a smile.
Harry's eyes flashed but he obeyed, gripping Draco's leg as he continued to lick and suck at him, grinding against the bed as he chased his own release.
He pulls out his wand, casting the spell that will light Malfoy's location up for him. It fails. Nothing happens. Malfoy looks at him, eyes flinty.
'It's not something I hide,' Harry says, answering Malfoy's question. 'But it's not something I've flaunted, either.' He feels anger stir as he considers the journalists who've made his life hell and have ruined so many important things for him over the years. 'The last thing I want is those vultures from the newspapers getting their hands on that knowledge and making a big deal about it.'
