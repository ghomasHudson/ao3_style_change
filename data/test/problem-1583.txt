Besides, keeping mute allows me to evaluate the situation in which we’re stuck. As much as Simon seems to trust Harry, I don’t give over my stamp of approval so easily. And there is something off about him, something that feels vaguely familiar. The way his eyes sometimes unfocus if no one’s talking to him.
But then his clock struck 6 and manners overtook procrastination. He stepped into the Floo, calling out Harry’s address.
“Oh,” Simon sits up straight. “Well that explains a bit. Though I have no idea what a deatheater is. Doesn’t sound pleasant.”
“You make it sound so easy,” Harry huffed, almost pouting.
“What’s going on?” Draco asked, trying to adjust to the scene of his normally stoic son bouncing off the walls while his still stoic mother rubbed her temples delicately on the couch.
“Sorry,” He smirks. But I get the feeling he’s not all that sorry.
“How,” Draco panted. “What.”  He took a deep inhale, deep exhale. “What do you mean, the truth?”
. It’s Potter, actually. We’re making plans to go to dinner.”
Shrugging, “What can I say? I like a passionate man.” Pulling Draco back into his arms once again, “I like
I squeeze him tighter.
I can’t help but laugh; Baz has been sitting cross-legged in front of the mirror for the last thirty minutes. “If this is personally offensive to you, don’t watch.”
Harry eased his body language some. “I get that.” He smiled wryly. “Probably wouldn’t be kosher to invite the war hero to the pity party.”
.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Out as in the outside world. Out as in Harry Potter going to a gay bar before he officially comes out. Everyone needs a last ‘hurrah’ after all.”
I give him a good shudder (he loves those).
Draco allowed a sharp exhale at the way that confession punctured his heart. “I’ll talk to your mother, ok? See what she thinks.”
This isn't as polished as I'd like, but I realized I hadn't posted in a week so thought something was better than nothing. Hope you enjoy! And yeah... I DID google translate "hair color" to Latin for a spell. I'm not ashamed! :)
“Why?” Harry smirks. “Are you taking notes?”
Harry leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms. The movement sparked its own defensive reaction in Draco.
He clapped his hands in front of him and tried on a smile. “Let’s go introduce that boy of yours to the Three Broomsticks. He’s got to be ready for some refreshments after all of that swinging.”
After the tour, Teddy arrived, and the two boys ran off to play Quidditch.
Draco dropped his head in his hands, the exhaustion striking him with the force of a hippogriff. “
“They can’t have garlic, either,” Harry adds.
“Hey,” Baz turns to face Simon. “You’re here with me. You’re safe.”
“Lavender!” Draco exclaimed. “Come look at my calendar. I think something’s wrong with it.”
A deep sigh escaped him, and he threw his head back on the arm of his couch. He turned his head to eye the bottle of Firewhiskey on his cocktail cart. It
Simon tugs Baz’s hair gently. “Am I telling this story, or are you?”
“Don’t play coy with me,” Harry smiled. “What’s a Friday Snake Up?”
Harry’s face flushed bright red. “Prep work on the press conference?”
PS: Harry's outfit at the ball was inspired by this
“I’m not sure if I should be flattered or scared.” He shifted in his seat.
Draco spelled a nonverbal Scourgify at Hermione, and she smiled in thanks.
Only one more chapter left... then an epilogue. I can't believe this self-indulgent nonsense is almost over! Thanks to everyone who's enjoyed and commented on this fic so far. Y'all make me so happy, because I don't feel as alone wanting this weird Drarry-SnowBaz hybrid to exist.
Harry gave Draco a look, the intensity of his eyes flared. “Fuck.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “
Up next: Simon and Baz POV's.
Weary grey eyes lifted to meet green.
“I doubt Divination would interest either of you, but maybe Runes or Arithmancy…” She seems to realize she’s lost Simon’s attention.
“I still don’t understand.”
Malfoy clears his throat. Harry looks over, surprised to see Malfoy’s face nearly completely flushed red. He must be flushed from the alcohol.
“Draco?” Hermoine interrupted his thoughts, eyebrows furrowed.
“Mr. Potter! My apologies, I—”
Harry groaned. “I’m going to regret this question, but since it’s my hair, I feel I have the right to know.” He paused. “Who’s going to Polyjuice into me? Will it be you or Blaise?”
Except Draco didn’t want to look at Harry’s face right now, lest he see pity. Or something worse. Instead, he dropped his eyes to the book he held in his hand. Looked at the front cover once more, having seen it so many times in the grasp of his son’s hand, on the bedside table in Scorpius’s room, on his own coffee table. In every bookstore he’d passed for the last several months. In the hands of countless witches and wizards.
Or, he was simply too drunk.
Draco groaned, settling into the ancient leather. Harry motioned for Draco to scoot over, and, with a powerful eye roll, he allowed Harry to take the seat next to him.
Mother and Harry exchanged glances, then, after a meaningful head nod from Mother, Harry knelt beside Scorpius. “Did you know your Grandmother saved my life?”
Baz closes his eyes like my stupidity is painful. “You
Writing this fic is turning out to be more of a struggle than I expected, so I apologize for the delays. I really thought I'd move on this story faster. I threw in a reference from one of my favorite movies to cheer me up, so points to anyone who finds it. Also, I spent way too much time trying to figure out the perfect channel number for The Prophet news station.
“Hey!” Draco objected. “I lost those ten pounds, ok?”
“It’s lovely,” Harry said, a genuine smile on his face.
Scorpius shook his head, his hands tightening around his fork. He paused in his food hoovering,  shifting in his chair as if debating something. Without looking up, he spoke, “Maybe I could come back here sometimes? To visit you and Mr. Potter?”
Approving, Scorpius turned to his grandmother. “You may take me to the park, then, Grandmother.”
Harry clicked his tongue in disgust, but otherwise remained silent.

“Rough,” He pulls away to gasp before diving in once more.
Next chapter... we're going to have a POV free-for-all. Fingers crossed it doesn't get too confusing.
“It’s just…,” And he’s really on a roll, now, isn’t he? “I’m starting to wonder if Astoria’s been right all along and it terrifies me that I might have lost the chance to do this correctly. I thought I
“He Owled me, but, unfortunately I received so much mail in those first days that it took me too long to respond,” Draco said.
“I don’t know,” Mike said, returning his hand to Harry’s arm. “His outfit looks pretty good to me.”
Had he ever changed his glasses from those horrid round lenses into something more fashionable?

Hermione laughed, “As if you didn’t already get headhunted for those exact positions.”
Scorpius narrowed his eyes at Pansy. “No comment, Aunt Pansy.”
, Harry. Emperor, maybe. The Master of the Universe, obviously.”
Draco could think of a lot of people, himself included, who might disagree. But he ceded the point, “Right, who’d want that?”
, Potter. Keep your grabby hands to yourself.” He punctuated these words with a hand slap. “Salazar, your manners need work. Shame it’s not on our agenda for this evening. Now, where shall we eat?”
“Oh!” Harry smiled shyly. “Yeah. Ok.”
He let out a breath of relief; Harry wasn’t mad at him, then. Not that he thought Harry would be. Not at all. Still, Draco found the message reassuring and wrote back promptly.
Draco saw Harry’s worried expression, and reached over to grab his hand. “Don’t worry, you’re safe here. Remember, my middle finger reference from earlier?” Harry nodded. “Well, let’s say Treasure doesn’t approve of a lot of the wizarding ways. The bar’s mostly muggles, and the odd wizard or two. Having both of us here tonight has probably doubled his average nightly wizard attendance records.”
“Stop
Letting Harry off the hook, the two of them turned to watch Scorpius play. The boy found the swing set, and he took to it instantly, swinging himself higher and higher into the air. Draco tried to ignore the rising guilt about how he’d never taken Scorpius to a park before now. He imagined a world where Draco hadn’t been crippled by his past or his fear of becoming his father. In the fantasy, Scorpius called out, ‘
Draco corrected him, “This is my
Whistling, Draco planned his life for the next six months on his CL, marking down his ‘Scorpius Weeks’ with joy he’d not previously known.
Draco took a seat on the couch, and Harry followed. Their eyes both drifted to Scorpius’s worn copy of ‘The Wrong Sider.’
Harry ran his sweaty hands over the wool of his muggle trousers. Caught Malfoy doing the same on his formal Wizarding robes. Harry removed his jacket an hour ago, but finally succumbed to loosening his tie. Then, he rolled up the sleeves of his fitted white button-down. Malfoy watched with some expression of envy maybe, but he refused to allow one measure of comfort into his ensemble. For some sick reason, Harry found the obstinance endearing.
She doesn’t elaborate further.

give Harry Potter the complete ‘I-wish-you-were-my-real-dad’ stamp of approval. Draco would be jealous if the idea of having an emotion right now didn’t make him feel so incredibly tired. Instead, Draco sipped his wine.
“Right!” Hermione added. “And how the light hits his eyes just so, turning them almost silver?” Then she went off on some tangent about the main character's flaxen hair while Draco tuned her out. Whatever discussion they were having, Draco knew it was hopeless to try and enter it. After years of experience, he knew that when Ron and Hermoine locked in on one another like this there was no chance for anyone else to join. Draco wondered if Potter had felt this way, or still felt that way—he knew Ron and Hermoine saw him often enough, even if the rest of the wizarding world rarely did.
“No!” Lavender shouted, then remembered the setting. “
Draco took pity on him. “This tradition started after the war, Harry. It held us together when the world was dead set on tearing us apart. It’s like therapy. Or church. It’s.” He paused. “It’s sacred.”
Draco has an encounter outside the Leaky that leaves him unsettled, finally finishes reading 'The Wrong Sider', and has problems.
“Then
“But think of how it’d offend our parents,” He waggled his eyebrows.
After all, it was exactly Malfoy’s stubborn streak that had awakened something in Harry more damning than Ginny’s letter.
“I will end you,” Draco threatened. “I don’t care if it gets me sent to Azkaban. Compare me to one of those dirt-loving hippies again and I’ll kill you.”
Harry looked at Draco. “Thursday?” Draco suggested. “That way, follow up stories hit Friday, the opinion pieces land over the weekend, and by Monday morning maybe people will move on to something more important?”
With a wave of her wand, she conjures two shiny, gold bells and hands them to us. “If you need anything, please ring. Someone will come at a moment's notice to help.” She gives them another smile. “Welcome to Hogwarts. I hope you will enjoy your stay, and that it is as brief as we can manage. Oh, and the password is, ‘Unity’.”
“You sure you can handle more?” Harry smirks.
“Right, but you were faking.” Draco knew this story from his mother.
“Ah yes, that,” Pansy said, a hint of disappointment in her voice. Sighing, “So, business it is. Well, lucky for you, I have the inside track to delay or shut down the article.” She turned toward Harry. “I’m a society reporter for the Prophet, which means I have dirt on everyone and the means to employ it.”
“Luckily it didn’t take,” Treasure said, gesturing at his outfit, giving a more convincing smile. “And thanks to the both of you, I got out.”
He looked both ways down the hallway, then pulled her into his office. “Ok, but you can’t tell anyone.”
“I have no
“Babe,” I coo, and join him on the ground, bracketing his legs with mine and pressing my chest against his back. Given my wings, he’s become the default little spoon.
She waved his grinning face away, her own face trying to hide her pleasure, as if she hated it. Draco felt a slight twinge, one he always felt at blatant affection between the couples in his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
He beamed, and followed her into her office.
“Yes, well,” She raised her nose in the air. “
Then again, maybe I’m expecting too much from the silly sod. He’s only just now getting fed.
Hermione fixed him with her discerning gaze. “You’d better not have found a new job already. I’ll throw all of your newly filed papers on the floor if you leave me without warning.”
The second she’s outside of hearing range, I turn to Simon. “What in the actual fuck?”
“No,” Harry raised his hand. “You’re right. It’s not my place. He’s your son. I don’t—I really don’t have any right to comment.”
“What else is different?” Simon asks.
Thanks as always for reading <3
“Oooh,” Simon coos, pulling Baz tight against him. “I think it’s cute. Pining Baz is cute.”
“So you see,” Draco grinned without warmth. “It really made sense from a logical perspective.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know. I felt more like a soldier or a sacrifice.”
Regardless, Draco followed. “Did you show that to me on our tour?”
There’s a good chance Draco’s going to suggest to Hermione that their first joint legislative project should be to outlaw the broad grin this confession brought to Harry’s face.
“It all worked out for the best, though?” Draco grinned. “If it weren’t for S.P.E.W., we’d never been paired together.”
Despite the heat, Draco’s whole body turned cold. Ripping his arms from Harry’s grasp, he sneered, “Why would I want you?”
Harry chokes out a laugh. “Godric. I didn’t even think about that. I should owl Charlie.” Then, he gives Baz a curious look. “On second thought, that might not be a good idea.”
Harry doesn’t correct him. Draco’s spit of Harry’s name no longer has the same punch. Sometimes, it even feels fond.
“If we want the editor to drop the story, we’ll have to give him something juicier to run with,” Pansy proposed.
Tilting his head to the side like he was trying to solve a particularly complex puzzle, Harry said, “You’re a weird one, Draco. But I think I like it.”
“Come on!” Harry complained.
“Honestly, I know nothing about wine,” Harry laughed as they sat down. “But it is better than I’d expected.”
Harry shook his head, “If only I’d come out sooner. I thought that op-ed was enough, but I was a coward. Not wanting the press, when, in this case, it might have actually done some good.” He slapped his fist against the wall.
I feel my own jawline, which has sprouted a rather bushy beard. Something I might expect after a month of growth, were I not completely annoyed by the feel of stubble.
“On three. One, two,
Hermione and Ron winced, anticipating how Draco would react. And they would have been correct, if their anxiety hadn’t been so apparent, and Draco’s nature so drawn to being contrary.
Like that day, Harry Potter had been found out and, once again, his fate fell into Draco’s hands.
“That’s actually why I invited you tonight,” Astoria said, twirling her mostly full wine glass in her fingers. “I want him to meet you. And Scorpius.”
“You’re simplifying a bit,” Baz glares. “The Mage did something,
“Soften the blow,” Baz sighs.
“Astoria has Scorpius today.” Draco sat back up in his chair. Raised an eyebrow. Dared them to continue their jeering.
Harry gave a wry smile. “Technically, I wasn’t allowed until fourth year due to some issues getting parental permission.”
“Another thirteen years or so would do it,” Draco snarked, and braced himself for the resulting battle.
“It’s part of the reason I was so vocal when the Prophet outed you,” Harry confessed.
Then, one day she stopped being “Granger” and became Hermione. The rest was history.
“Salazar, Potter,” Draco interrupted. “I don’t need a whole laundry list of the people who love you. I get the picture. Your friends and family know, former childhood rivals don’t. So, come on, tell me the secret.”
Over lunch a few hours later, Draco spilled the beans about everything but his burgeoning friendship with Potter. Lavender was surprisingly supportive of his decision to explore advancing his career, despite her happiness at her current role.
Harry hummed a response, and relaxed back against the bricks.
As promised, they ordered, and moved on. Briefly. When the food arrived, Ron tried again.
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “That’s because it’s magic,” And he reveled in Harry’s shock. “It’s charmed to taste like your favorite wine,” He explained. “The charm does tend to make the wine a bit too sweet, and sometimes there’s a metallic aftertaste, but still. A neat trick, right?”
Shaking his head, “No. Harry, no stories. You can’t give them anything to work with. Let them wear themselves out asking as many questions as they can stand while revealing as little as possible.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anyways,” I redirect, getting a bit self-conscious at the way everyone’s looking at me. “Then I lost my magic, and nothing would get rid of the wings. Nothing magickal, anyway.”
“They talk about me?” Draco asked, his heart filling with something that felt addictive and also frightening at the same time. Whatever it was, it quickly erased the annoyance Draco had felt at Harry’s utterly worthless explanation.
“Honestly, Potter, your manners clearly need work. So many projects with you! First, I’ll help you write your coming out statement—I assume you haven’t started this yet, given the way you approached the six years of schooling we shared. Then we’ll tackle your public address. Of course, we’ll have to manage your wardrobe as well, because, I mean, look at you. Last, we’ll start on your manners. Merlin, I should have known being friends with you would be such work. Really, you should be thanking your lucky stars Hermione pushed us together sooner rather than later. Imagine if I hadn’t come along, how lost you’d—.”
Snowy flew off into the sunset. Well, regardless of how Scorpius felt, Draco could do one thing for his son, he thought as he placed the book on his coffee table.
She gave him an annoyed look.
Simon shakes his head and slumps against the headboard.
Like a toddler, Harry threw himself back against the booth and crossed his arms. The perfect picture of a pout.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry for the delayed posting; haven't been in a writing mood lately. After a really rough week, I'm glad this next chapter is a heart-warming one; I enjoyed editing this one to post for the ending alone.
She scoffed. “Well don’t make me regret it!”
Harry writes Draco a letter, Draco reads parts of The Wrong Sider to Scorpius.
“Watcha doin’?” A voice twittered from the entry of his office.
She nodded. “I’ve only just arrived.” But, from the thoughtful look on her face, Draco suspected she’d caught more than just the tailend of their conversation.
Like a kind person, Harry ignored Draco’s poor parenting. “Were we ever that small?” Harry asked.
“Draco, I’m so sorry. I knew I shouldn’t have—” He cut off, looking sheepish when he found Pansy in the room. She responded by mouthing ‘Draco?’ to no one in particular. Draco wondered if going back to bed would erase this all from happening.
and a tray of steaming chocolate chip waffles, butter, syrup, bacon, and scrambled eggs appeared on the kitchen counter. It took Draco a second to remember Harry warned of this possibility.
“No,” Harry says, catching his breath. “Not good.”
“You said my name,” He whispered, eyes glistening with emotion.
Hermione shook her head vehemently. “Even if he had asked, I would have said no, but he trusts my judgement. The job is yours, if you want it.”
Harry grinned. “‘S ok. Pretty used to it by now. No harm done.”
He rolled his eyes, “It’s not what it looks like, Pansy.”
Once again remembering Harry’s threesome confession, Draco decided to fully retaliate. “All that mattered was how well I sucked cock.”
“We’ll see each other soon, won’t we?” Scorpius asked, not making eye contact.
The change that revealed the author of ‘The Wrong Sider’ as Harry James Potter.
Landing in the Ministry, he was immediately tackled by the woman of the hour.
Harry nodded. “She saw the news articles and came to find me. After her own experiences in the war,” Here, Draco winced, “She went to see a mind healer, and practically forced me to go to one myself. I stopped drinking, started therapy, and went back to Hogwarts for my eighth year.”
“I am,” Harry said, kneeling down to address Scorpius at the same height, a gesture that did not make Draco want to swoon like a smitten schoolgirl.
,” Draco moaned.
No one speaks. No one even sips their drink. Malfoy still won’t face the rest of the room.
Relieved of parental duty, Draco settled into Hermione’s living room couch, and transfigured the cork out of the wine bottle and into a small duck for Hugo, who played on the floor in front of him. The little tyke obsessed over ducks, which Draco found ridiculous but indulged because Hugo was three, and three-year-olds deserved a little whimsy. Even if it came in the form of cork ducks.
Baz looks devastated. “No garlic bread?”
will find.” Turning to Draco, “And of course we have your hair saved up, dear. We have for years.” She turned her nose up in the air. “You know I had a terrible pash on you in sixth year, and Blaise lets me roleplay where I turn you straight.” Then, the evil woman winked at him, “You weren’t kidding about your best asset. Blaise was quite jealous when he saw it.”
Pansy placed a defensive hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Don’t bring Harry into this. You’re upset at the book, Draco. And you have every right. From what you’ve read, something strange and possibly invasive is happening. But it’s hardly Harry’s fault.”
Hermoine and Ron exchanged
She stifled her relieved sigh too late, but looked unrepentant. “Yes! It is exactly that time. I’ll help. Draco, Harry, watch Scorpius and Rose, will you?” As if Draco needed to be told to watch his own son (which, admittedly, was the whole point of this week with Scorpius, but Draco could ignore reality when it suited him).
“Malfoy. Mal-Draco.”
Draco could just picture Harry sputtering at that last line.
“Ah!” He raised his wand. “Don’t make me
Scorpius shrugged. “I like who you are when you’re around him.”
“Come on,” Harry whined. “I’m still a Parselmouth. Surely that nets me an invitation to a gathering of snakes.”
Sorry for the delay between chapters 5 and 6. I got distracted by my own brain and wrote two full fics and started posting another WIP because why live in sanity? Anyways. All I want to do is write smut lately so hopefully no one is offended that I added some to this previously teen-rated fic.
Somehow, that broke the spell building between them. “You promised a personal revelation?” Draco sat up straight, which both improved his mental state and increased the space between them.
The Headmistress doesn’t betray her emotions so obviously, but she does say, “Mr Potter.”
being tied up on a stranger’s bed in an alternate dimension, held captive by people whose capacity for evil we haven’t gauged, with no idea how to get home?” He finishes his statement with a piercing glare.
“And you were.”
She gave him an unrepentant smile. “Nothing, dear. Oh, look at the time.” She looked down at her wrist, which did not bear a timepiece. “It’s been so much fun, but I have some
, Draco thought, as a trickle of sweat dripped from his hairline. Nothing built to last started in a dark alley behind an overrated wizarding pub. But Draco refused to listen. Avoiding the traction of those damnable green eyes, Draco traced the features of Harry’s fine face with his fingers. The famous scar, bisecting one eyebrow. The imperfect nose, slightly crooked from their Hogwarts Express encounter. The prominent cheekbones, creased from years of digging metal frames. The heart-shaped lips, parted and perfect and inviting.
Draco filled his glass with wine, then summoned a glass from the kitchen and filled that one up as well. Handing the glass over to Potter, he had a slight panic attack remembering that the wine could be drugged, and this might be the second time he’d accidentally poisoned one of the Golden Trio. Then, he remembered that he’d already given the wine to Hermione, and decided the symmetry of poisoning all three of the Trio greatly outweighed the potential negative consequences. Plus, he’d drunk the wine as well, which his slightly tipsy brain now thought was very funny. How in the world had he gotten this tipsy off one glass of wine?
“Mmhmm,” Harry hummed.
“Potter,” She breathed. “I’m so glad you asked, and, to reward your curiosity, I’m going to let you choose. Although, you should keep in mind that Blaise and I keep our traditional ‘positions’ when Polyjuiced into other genders. If you know what I mean.”
, Draco thought as he flipped his tenth pancake of the morning. He knew he’d overdone it: cooking eggs, bacon, toast as normal, but adding hash browns, pancakes and strawberry compote to the mix.
Crap. Draco hoped Harry had forgotten. “What question?” Draco deflected.
“Yes,” Draco’s grip on his wand faltered; that’d been one proposal he’d feared introducing. “You see, I think part of the reason pure-bloods fear muggle-borns is a watering down of wizarding heritage. I thought it might be nice to create an exchange of traditions. To help preserve our past while embracing our future.”
Simon scoffs and Baz elbows him.
She beamed. “Please, call me Narcissa.”
[HJP]
Treasure shot him a look, “You really don’t know your own influence, do you?” He sighed. “At the time, I’d just come of age. I was debating about leaving home, which, all things considered, shouldn’t have been a challenging choice. But I was afraid. Having only been homeschooled, I didn’t know anyone outside our pure-blood contacts, and I thought none of them would approve. Then, The Prophet outed Draco, and I finally found someone who might relate.” Treasure gave Draco a fond look, which Draco returned with a brief hand squeeze.
This chapter inspired by beautiful patios with great happy hour specials and shitty service.
“Does this,” Malfoy gestured the full length of his body, eyebrow raised in emphasis, “look like it was designed for heterosexual enjoyment?”
Draco sent Harry a grin full of teeth.
Draco cut off, almost running into Harry when their journey ended at a kitchen table. Somehow, Draco’s rambling had distracted him for the entire walk through the house. Harry turned, his face wearing an expression that might almost be described as fond. Feeling uncomfortable, Draco looked around the room, seeking refuge from his unexpected window into Harry’s emotions.
“Mr. Weasley?” Scorpius asked, eyes wide.
Harry clears his throat, ignoring the topic to pass out pint glasses. “All right,” He cracks open two beer bottles. “We call this a Buttery Beard. Here,” He pours half a beer in each pint glass. Then, spelling his pint glass to float beside him, he fills the shot glasses half up with brown liquor, “Firewhiskey,” He explains, mostly for Draco’s benefit, since I have no idea what that is.
She tutted. “Poor baby. Let’s have tea.”
Then, a
“He does turn a bit black at the edges though,” Simon points out. “But sunscreen helps.”
And found no rant. Only questions.
“Not from you,” Harry added. “You’re… you’re safe. I need. More safe.”
Draco felt Harry’s intense gaze on the side of his face, but refused to meet it. Instead, he settled for the glow of his mother’s rare wrinkle-inducing smiles, and rose to hug her.
Relaxing his fight stance, Harry asked, “Do you really think they’ll ask that?”
“Oh.” Harry looked like Draco’s words had sucked the air completely out of his lungs. “I never thought of it like that.”
The line of Draco’s body pulled taut with tension when this small action drew him awake.
Salazar. Draco was going to have to finish The Wrong Sider, wasn’t he?
“Draco, what did you think this was?”
Draco tried to ignore the hurt in Harry’s voice; this wasn’t something he could share. Not yet, anyway.
Pansy smirked. “I’m freelance, so I can always sell my stories to The Quibbler or Witch Weekly.” She paused. “What I want to know is how you found out about the story. I can’t imagine
His chest heaved with the effort. It occurred to Draco that he’d been rubbing his left arm as he finished his rant. He crossed his arms in front of his chest.
Harry smiled his (adorable) smile. “I doubt that’s true anymore, Draco. I expect you’ve changed quite a bit from the boy I once knew.”
Leaning against the door, Harry pulled Draco flush to him, letting Draco feel for himself the truth of the situation.
“You know, you two are actually perfect for each other,” Treasure observed. “Neither one of you can give up your past mistakes.”
(See the end of the chapter for
This is what Harry wants. What Ginny wasn’t ready to give him. She’d wanted a career all her own. The chance to be her own person outside of Harry’s shadow. And who is he kidding? It’s a big goddamn shadow, whether he chooses to cast it or not.
“Yes, well, as Pansy implied I tend to ration my facial expressions,” Draco replied, and he could just bet the tips of his ears had turned red. “Glad to see the sacrifice has paid off.”
“A vampire,” Baz admits.
“We’re not friends,” Draco said, his hand dangling naan like it’d forgotten how to make its way into his mouth.
“Is it so important that you marry?’ Harry asked.
“That my bride would leave with your groom on both our wedding days?” Harry let this laugh escape. “No, I didn’t suspect.”
Harry sat beside him, uninvited but, by the way Draco unconsciously leaned toward him, not unwelcomed.
“We don’t have those,” I muse out loud.
Leaning in, Draco continued. “Yes, she said that the way the main character had been described... Well, she said that he sounded like quite the dish.” He leaned back, mission accomplished.
[HJP]
They saw the master bedroom where Harry slept, the rooms preserved for brothers Sirius and Regulus Black, the latter an unsung hero in the defeat of Voldemort. They skipped the many guest bedrooms in favor of seeing the cellar where Kreacher conducted his business, the regulation sized Quidditch pitch the house had seen fit to build for Harry’s solitude, the room of Black heritage where the family tapestry and various ancestral portraits resided (including the infamous Walburga), and the house elf memorial which seemed a bit gauche until Harry explained Kreacher wouldn’t let him throw the taxidermied elf heads away on the threat of quitting.
“No,” Harry admitted. “It’s a new addition. After spending that evening watching Scorpius and Teddy with you, I thought it might be nice to have some other areas of outdoor seating. And, well,” Now he managed to look sheepish, “The house heard the wish and made it real.”
Harry leaned back, fixing Draco in a contemplative stare. “You’re too hard on yourself, you know,” Harry said. Draco looked away, but Harry continued. “Do me a favor. Later tonight, when you have the headspace for it, imagine Scorpius in your situation. Would you allow him to say the things you say, if he applied them to himself?”
“Um, Hermione? Not that I mind, but you didn’t tell me you had company,” Potter said, running his hands through that awful rats nest on his head he called hair. Draco ignored how badly he wanted to touch it. Thirteen years was not nearly long enough to erase the fact that Potter was, and continued to be, stupidly attractive. Draco wondered where all of the wine in his glass had gone.
Draco released his breath in a gasp, then threw his hand over his mouth. The silence in the next room was deafening. If they heard him... Draco had almost turned back into his bedroom when Pansy spoke again.
“Oh. Right. Sorry,” Draco apologized, feeling rather sheepish.
Harry gave up the ghost and turned.
“I don’t have a good answer for you,” Draco smirked, wiping the self-satisfied grin right off Potter’s face. “But I believe it’s because sometimes you deserve to be Harry, and sometimes you piss me off enough to be Potter.”
“He’s a character,” Harry said, eyes bright.
“I’ve upset you,” Harry pouted. “You called me Potter.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Sometimes, I say Potter when I need some distance from my feelings.”
“Heathen,” Draco shuddered, masking his pleasure with disdain. “You utter, absolute heathen.”
apparently vampired his neck and left him with an erection the size of—”
“I’m skiving off work, actually,” Draco grinned. “Scorpius wanted to visit Hogsmeade, and I’ve decided to indulge him.”
“I still don’t understand how I didn’t see it,” Simon groans.
,” Draco gripped Harry’s cock too tight, just right, and
“Yow!” He shouted, rubbing his head from where she’d harvested his hair. “Parkinson—what the hell?”
We all drop our shots and chug.
Scorpius stopped short in the doorway, suddenly transfixed by the sight in front of him. He’d met Hermione and Ron enough times to have passed this starstruck phase. But clearly nothing had prepared Draco’s child for the sight of his father eating Indian food with the Chosen One.
“I don’t care; I need to know,” Draco pouted, convinced now that it would, in fact, be a very boring answer. What a waste of his Slytherin impulses.
Hermione elbowed Draco, and he realized that this must be the part of the conversation requiring his participation. Verbally, probably, though he had no idea how to make sounds happen at the moment. It was, hopefully, a temporary affliction. One that would resolve itself any minute now. Any minute.
An invitation unique from every other in one very intriguing way?
Shaking her head, “Pansy gets a mysterious new celebrity PR client, Scorpius can’t stop asking about the Golden Trio, and you start making expressive faces at an unknown messenger.” She smirked. “It’s always been Potter for you, hasn’t it?”
face seeing the look on
“You’re such an emotionally repressed twat,” She smiled. “So, you’ll come?”
Sighing, “Can’t an established gay man flirt with a newly bisexual man without the blushing virgin routine?” Draco asked.
And when dawn rose on Sunday morning on an unslept bed and an increasingly unhinged Draco Malfoy, it was all he could do not to storm the Floo to Pansy’s.
Listening the whole time, his heart wide open in a way he hadn’t felt since childhood, Draco wished he’d brought a second bottle of wine to The Burrow II, and that he wasn’t one second away from crying.
Number 12 Grimmauld Place could design many other rooms at Harry’s pleasure, Draco understood from his knowledge of wizarding home dynamics. But the only additions he’d made were the Quidditch pitch, the ancestral room, and the house elf memorial. At least, these were the only custom rooms Harry included on the tour.
Harry chugs the rest of his drink. “Pretty awful, honestly.”
I watch my love hit the floor and before I can stop myself I have the blond man we’ve watched (and pitied) up against the wall.
Draco’s cheery mood slipped for a moment as he stood outside his Floo, take-out from Frankie’s in hand. Harry’s CL flirting had reassured Draco somewhat; he didn’t expect there to be much fallout from their strange outing to the Leaky. Still, Draco could hardly be blamed for facing their meeting with a bit of reticence.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Hermione conceded. “All right, come to my office. Let’s have a chat.”
Catching Harry’s frown, Draco crossed the room to his perch on Harry’s reclining chair. He squeezed Harry’s shoulder. “You’ll be fine, I promise.”
Harry smiled. “If you’re anything like now, I definitely would have noticed you. Admired you, even.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, his voice firm and fake. “I… I should probably go now.”
Draco pulled out his CL, reading through the words that might have spared them both a bit of indignity. “Well, fuck. Sorry about that.”
“Of course!” The elf sunk into an impossibly lower bow. “Kreacher will bring the meal straight away.”
Astoria groaned. “Draco, the whole Slytherin house played Bingo-Pottah starting my third year, your fourth year.”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “
Harry shook his head. “No. I, uh. I really died.”
“Sorry, Father,” Scorpius said, obviously not sorry at all. “You have to admit, it is a funny picture.”
In so many ways, he was no longer the boy from Hogwarts whose father bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team. After all, who’d have guessed he’d ever work for
They ran through the full list, Hermione’s small but satisfied smile filling Draco’s heart with pride.
As Harry reached for their drink delivery, his smile grew with Draco’s. “That’s amazing, Draco. You seem really pleased.”
He smirked. “Who are we kidding, Draco? It was always going to end in fist fights for us.”
attraction to you may have factored
Draco entertained a flashback of their night at The Pub, and the sly smirk on Harry’s face betrayed similar thoughts.
“The roommate; he’s frowning.”
“A plus one?” Draco held his breath. The door opened wider.
I let Baz’s groan be my answer.
Trevor popped his head out the back door. “Treasure! You’re on in five.”
“Sometimes, I wonder whether the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin was the biggest wasted opportunity of our lifetime,” Draco admitted. “Imagine if more people understood that pairing vision with cunning could change the world.”
“Now sit.”
,” Draco pouted from the comfort of his cupped hands. Really, this day was turning out
“Don’t pretend like that’s not entirely true.”
With a mocking gasp, “A workplace romance?” He tutted. “So scandalous.”
Harry flushed, then stammered, “Er, well, that book isn’t strictly—I mean, from what I’ve heard it’s not 100% representative of… That is to say, if such a thing happened in a book it doesn’t necessarily mean it happened in real life.”
I blush.
Although, what a stupid question. Of course he feared failure. Who didn’t? Ok, maybe not idiotic Gryffindors. Draco wondered if Hermione had been afraid of taking on the Deputy Minister role. He suddenly wondered why he’d never asked.
Real talk: is the POV/First Person/Third Person switch hard to swallow? It doesn't bother me, but I wrote this so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“If only I had popcorn to throw.”
I have a feeling he prefers it this way.
“How’ve you been?” Astoria asked, eyes full of concern.
Smiling, “Kreacher must have heard your wish and delivered.”
Pansy waved a dismissing hand. “I sincerely doubt that people will move on so quickly, but your logic isn’t bad. We can have the statement hit Thursday morning, which gives our reporters some time to dig into Potter’s past to see if we can give the story any juice before that evening’s press conference.” She glanced over at Harry. “Sorry about that. But you know it’s inevitable. You’re welcome to steer me in more flattering directions, if you’d like.”

. In defiance of every ounce of pure-blood etiquette surviving in Draco’s body, he reacted.
“Can I call you Draco?” Harry asked.
Baz rolls his eyes. “You just want to know if they sparkle in the sunlight.”
the war.”
“It’s my favorite part,” Draco said, his mind a complete blank. “I always save it for last.”
Draco wanted to scream,
“Tell me to stop,” Draco said.
I shout, looking at the mirror in dismay.
Harry nodded, a tender look in his eyes. “One of the best.”
Draco glared at her, which she answered by raising both her hands in the air. “Fine! Fine, no more teasing. But seriously, is someone going to tell me what’s going on here?”
“What happened there?”
Harry interrupted Draco’s rambling with a kiss. “They’ll finally see me, for who I am, with someone that I care about.”
Sighing, Draco let Scorpius walk into the fireplace, and, since avoiding things was the method of the day, Draco did not ask Scorpius to leave behind his now slightly worn copy of ‘The Wrong Sider.’

“Have you tried Muggle means?” Harry asks.
the headline read. Underneath, a split screen photo of Ginny and Blaise, kissing as they boarded the Knight Bus, and the closed door of the hotel’s honeymoon suite. The room in which Draco and Harry currently resided.
“Cheers.” Draco swallowed the shot with eyes closed. When he opened them, he addressed the ceiling with a sigh. “Did you suspect?”
Harry nodded along until Draco’s last statement, then spat out his drink. “I’m sorry, what?”
Harry took his elbow, and they moved to the stoop of Draco’s flat to Apparate. At least Draco had been able to teach Harry
You took Harry Potter to a drag show.”
“Oh!” Hermione gasped. “He told you?”
With a smirk, Harry scooped his soon-to-be-lover off the ground and plopped him onto the bed.
Draco sipped his wine. “What I told Treasure.” At Harry’s unimpressed stare, Draco continued, “And also because the club scene gets old after awhile. I got old.”
Then, Harry’s face exploded into a smile and he wrapped his muscular arms around Draco. “Thanks,” He whispered, his hot breath sending shivers down Draco’s spine.
Scorpius looked Harry up and down, giving him a very obvious but still Narcissa-esque scan of judgement. He completed the act with a nod; like there was a world where Scorpius
Astoria narrowed her eyes but said nothing.
Draco’s body went cold. He placed the book back down on the coffee table, downed the rest of his firewhiskey, and went to bed.
Draco stopped in his movements, his knuckles white where they gripped his fallen robes.
“Sure. Why not?,” Draco snorted. “Let’s pile on the absurdity. Lord knows a day like today deserves more crazy.”
Hermione and Draco looked at each other, then at the same time, “A big whiteboard and
Employing honesty and humility that was likely the end result of spending too much time with Gryffindors, Draco corrected himself. “Now that I think of it, no. We actually met at Madam Malkin’s off Diagon Alley. I regret…” Draco knew this next move was risky, but what else did he have to lose? “I wasn’t my best self. When we met again later, on the train to Hogwarts, I insulted his friend, Ron.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well,” She smiles, stopping back in front of a familiar door. Draco and Harry’s room, if I remember carefully. “I will let your new roommates provide input on what classes to take.” Clapping her hands in front of her, “All right. Lunch is served at noon in the Great Hall. In the interest of your safety, I will send an escort, and I ask that you only leave the room with a member of this dimension at your side. Mr Potter will be your best resource in recruiting volunteers.” Her lips purse a bit at this; the implication clear.
“You got the honeymoon suite, right?”
They split the Italian Draco’d purchased: eggplant parmesan for Harry, chicken florentine for Draco. Then, they negotiated sides, and Draco allowed Harry the extra garlic roll (apparently he didn’t need to be a wizarding house to be charmed by Harry, after all). Harry had pulled a bottle of pinot noir from the Black cellars, and poured generous glasses.
“And I was,” Harry agreed. “But at a cost. I came back… broken. We lost so many people in the war.
She slapped his shoulder. “Don’t be vulgar at the dinner table.”
Shaking off the memory of who placed that mark and why, he turned to Pansy.
“I am,” He blushed, taking a sip of his wine. “It’s so weird, I never saw myself here, but I can’t picture myself anywhere different.”
“Well,” Draco said. “You did promise Scorpius.”
“We’re past school age, Miss,” I admit.
, as he levitates Harry toward his bed. Harry sighs when his body lands on the mattress. Draco’s heart races as he lays the blankets over Harry, his sleep-warm body no longer twitching in anguish. If Draco allows himself a moment of delusion, he might believe it was his presence and not the soft bedding that coaxed Harry out of his nightmare.
Simon lets out a puff of air that ruffles Baz’s hair. “What’s it like? Being the Chosen One over here?”
“What do you need?” Draco asked, kneeling in front of Harry, seeking his face for a sign.
His eyes widen. “It was perfect.
Shrugging, “If you want.”
“Yes,” Draco breathed, and his heart kicked back into gear, sending his extremities tingling.
Then, he was alone.
No matter; I school the confusion off my face and work with Simon to get the blond onto his bed (there’s a sentence I never thought I’d think).
With a wry smile, Harry complied, and Draco watched his face as The Pub popped into existence, a rainbow of colors that lit up the dark street.
.” He said, wiggingly his eyebrows to indicate he was now in on the secret.
and suddenly Draco felt outside of the joke he’d started.
“Stop being such a baby. You know Hannah and Luna come, and they aren’t Gryffindors.”
Suddenly, it was all too much. Draco pulled back.
Rendered speechless, Draco stared at Hermione and tried not to drool, given the fact his jaw would likely not close for quite some time.
When Draco began spending time with Hermoine and Ron, he’d often thought how weird it was to see the Golden Trio without the Golden Boy.
Instead, Draco grabbed onto the one word that stuck out from his answer. “Technically?” He asked, one eyebrow raised.
With a coy smirk, “You’ll do.”
“Do you like this, Potter?” Draco licked into Harry’s ear.
Harry looks away from Malfoy, eyes red but dry. Kind and open. Not a pity in sight.
until Harry felt himself on the edge of madness.
Seeing Draco arrive home early shocked his mother, but she didn’t press. Most likely because she didn’t understand the nuances of working, and probably assumed some weird Ministry quirk sent employees home at 4 p.m. on Tuesdays. She released Scorpius reluctantly, and Draco pointedly did not notice the two of them got along better after two days in close contact compared to Draco’s and Scorpius’s relationship built over ten years of distant interactions.
he giving that face?
Harry shrugged. “We could be,” The Saviour said, not having the decency to swallow his mouthful of curry before sending Draco’s hopes and heart soaring to the fucking ceiling.
But instead of a fight, Potter laughed. A genuine, Potter-grade laugh. The kind Draco used to witness from a distance. The kind that was never directed at him. Never
“Me too,” Scorpius replied.
“Oh, it’s nothing to do with you,” Harry said, running his hands through his hair in what must be his go-to nervous fidget. “Only, I’m still really private, and I’ve been working on a project that made me even more private, and I guess I just wasn't sure how to welcome a new person into my life. You realize I haven’t really met any new wizards for a decade or so.”
She frowned and walked to his desk. Peering over his shoulder, “It looks normal to me? Except—” She slapped his shoulder. “
Draco did not dare to read more of ‘The Wrong Sider’ that night.
Adjusting her glasses on her nose, she peers at the bit of my tail that reaches out to her. “
The joke clearly didn’t land, given Pansy’s full strength death glare. Draco pushed back his chair, rose, and went to the living room, hoping softer furniture would help de-escalate the situation. Pansy trailed him, newspaper in hand. Draco was wondering whether Pansy would beat him with the rag or set it on fire when a sharp crack sounded as Harry Potter Apparated into Draco’s living room.
“Ok,” Draco said. “I fail to see what’s in it for me.” He paused, then panicked. “Wait, you’re not setting me up, are you?”
, I dare Harry. For the first time since we arrived in this world, I wish I had my sword.
Draco wanted more time with Scorpius. Of course he did. But there was a growing part of him coming to realize that what he wanted most was a family. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to parent Scorpius, it’s that he didn’t want to parent Scorpius
“A bit,” Draco admitted, pouring wine in their waiting glasses. “But now I can hire someone else to manage her calendar.” Honestly, giving up that task was one of the biggest perks of his new job. He flashed back to scheduling time between Hermione, five department heads, seven ICW delegates, and the Minister, merely days before the winter holiday break. He shook the thought away with a shudder.
“Weren’t you doing that already?” Astoria smirked.
[DLM]
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s unintentionally tight command of Grimmauld. Of course Harry Potter had earned the hard-won respect of the Most Ancient and Noble House, whereas Draco still couldn’t get the Manor to change the wallpaper in his childhood bedroom from anything other than a pukey shade of green.
Draco kisses Harry’s forehead, right on that supid scar he loves to insult. Then, he scoots to the far edge of the mattress and returns to slumber.
Harry growled in response, and that was about all Draco had patience for. He stepped into the living room, to Harry’s immediate relief.
Baz whips his head to me so fast his hair slaps my cheek.
Harry laughed. “Fair enough. All right, do your worst.”
“Draco, darling, I’m here to—“ His mother rose out of the fireplace, cutting off when she saw the occupants of Draco’s living room.
you use to watch my arse?”
Baz’s eyes go wide and watery. “You’re such a sap, Simon.”
“We are. The arrangement was my idea.”
“Don’t you fucking dare,” He warned. “You keep that Hufflepuff-esque sentiment out of my office.”
“All right, but I’m only letting him off the hook because I’m so very pleased you’ve graced us with your presence, Draco. Now, give us a hug.” The man commanded.
“What’s Kansas?” Draco asked. “Is that another gay bar?
“Oh,” Harry blinked, as if remembering he’d visited for a reason. “Pansy Owled me that the Prophet accepted our proposal.”
Her face lit up. “Draco.”
“They don’t call him the Saviour for nothing,” Draco drawled. “The man hasn’t met a cause he didn’t want to champion.”
your first question?”
“Draco,” Harry replied, pulling back even though every other instinct compelled him otherwise.
She nodded fiercely, hair bobbing with the movement.
“I didn’t know he was my father at the time. But I killed him all the same.” I pause and Baz finds my hand with his. Tightens. “All I did was ask that he stop hurting me. And it killed him.”
“Molly and Arthur are watching Rose and Scorpius, and it looks like Victoire’s joined them as well,” Hermione called from the kitchen, finishing the sort of post-work routine Draco imagined Hermione scheduled into her CL. Eventually, she joined Draco on the couch, two empty glasses in hand. “Ron will join us in a bit; he’s still at the shop with George.”
Whirling into the Ministry, Draco tried and failed to forget the memory of Harry Potter’s scared and shaking body, pressed up against his.

“To ask a question.” I suppress the urge to eye roll. Their eyes widen and they nod. “When are the two of you going to stop with the Potter/Malfoy nonsense?”
Harry shrugs. “Figured I’d start with an easy one.”
“I’m going to make you come in your trousers like a teenager,” Draco moaned in Harry’s ear. “I’ll make you forget the name of that slut who left you. Who never made you feel like
Raising one eyebrow, “You sure you want to keep whining? You’re running out of buttons there, Potter.” He tutted. “I don’t know what gay clubs
You see,” She paused and Draco peeked through his fingers to confirm that, yup, based on her quirked lip and nearly empty glass, she was about to truly and royally fuck him. “
Harry laughed. “All the things you could have—all right. It’s not an interesting answer, though.”
“Maybe if we’d had this back in our day, we wouldn’t have needed to resort to mud-slinging,” Draco elbowed Harry.
Harry waved him off. “No, Guillaume, please. No apologies. You’ve done nothing wrong. If I were offended by sarcastic barbs, I could hardly be friends with Draco here.”
“Oh, well,” Draco paused, then noticed Harry’s horrified expression. “Oh! No. No, I don’t plan on quitting. In fact, quite the opposite. You see, for the past year or so I’ve been getting quite a few job offers, and I found out today that Hermione was behind it.”
“As if it’d fit.”
Draco nearly spit out his drink. “When you were
At each outing, he arrived late and left early. Alone. The photographic evidence of his attendance made him appear distant, out of focus. As if his face had been charmed to avoid the flash of a camera. Knowing Potter’s aversion to the spotlight and Hermione’s skill at charm work, he wouldn’t doubt if that’d been exactly their plan.
But Draco knew one thing for certain: Hermoine Granger-Weasley would never read such a book. Thus, lunch was guaranteed to be the one hour of Draco’s day when he wouldn’t have to think about ‘The Wrong Sider’ and its increasing legion of fans.
“I see you’ve coaxed it into providing appropriate weather conditioning for you,” Draco seethed.
“Le petit mort. That means the little death,” Simon waggles his eyebrows.
Harry grinned. “Well, I did have an invisibility cloak and an enchanted map of Hogwarts’ secret passageways. It’s possible I may have visited a time or two before I had permission.”
Regretting what he now intended to do.
“Draco, I’d like to hug you. Would that be ok?” Hermione asked, moving around her desk.
with three lines underneath. He sighed. Here was one thing he could do right.
Forehead kisses to my stupid boys who love each other, and to all my readers/commenters/kudos-givers!
He knew he now found value in being the person behind the scenes in a way younger Draco never could have. Perhaps it was the public disgrace he’d experienced that changed him into someone weary of the spotlight. Or maybe he’d never actually been comfortable there. After all, it was never the public’s affection Draco sought, but his father’s.
They could hardly be on a first-name basis, having not spoken to one another in over thirteen years. If Potter saying, “I think this is yours,” while handing over Draco’s wand after the trials even counted as them having spoken.
“Really, Scorpius,” Draco said with mock surprise. “Betrayed by my own blood.”
describes the character wearing trousers. Tight, arse-fitting trousers.”
questions?”
They flagged the server down, paid, and moved to head out of the pub.
“Walburga?” Harry grinned. “Oh yeah, the old bat is still here. Permanent sticking charm. I doubt even the most experienced cursebreaker could get her off the wall, though we did manage to move her wall to a room outside of the main areas.”
Before Draco could stop himself (he’d lost all impulse control for the night, burned it all up in the first five minutes of trying not to touch Harry’s hair), he reached out to hold Harry’s wrist. “It’s ok that you didn’t consider that; it’s why I told you.” Draco smiled and shook his head at the expression on Harry’s face, reading its intention easily. “If you knew that was a factor, you’d have come out ages ago, wouldn’t you?”
Harry shakes his head. “I never did.”
“How come you sometimes call me Potter, and sometimes call me Harry?” Potter asked with a smile.
“Do you,” Potter paused. “Do you want
Pansy’s smile turned suspicious. “Does
He even enjoyed the work-life balance he’d carved out of his current job. His work never followed him out the office door and it didn’t keep him up late at night. Then again, if he found a more challenging job, he might be willing to give up some of his sleep and time at home.
“Add some eggs too, Scorpius.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco straightened up in his chair as the conversation spun back to him.
When we cease snogging long enough to realize we haven’t received an answer, we catch Harry and Draco in the most sexual tension-laden handshake.
,” Draco threatened.
Straightening in his chair, Draco started to very much dislike the look on Astoria’s face. She looked like she used to during their shared final year at Hogwarts, when she was a hair away from solving some class-related mystery.
“You know it wasn’t personal, Draco. It’s just, given how secretive Harry is, I thought it’d be better if he embraced the idea before Ron and I shared it with you.” Hermione gave him a look like she wanted to repeat their Tuesday hug.
He opened the book, and read.
Insert sharing the bed trope. Add a sword fighting/pining scene. Mix and share.
Draco still couldn’t bring himself to look into those eyes. Instead, he bent his face to the base of Harry’s neck, dragging his nose up the contours, bringing his teeth to a silken ear lobe. Before he bit, he placed one hand on Harry’s chest, feeling the race of that beautiful heart beneath Draco’s palm. He brought the other hand to Harry’s waist, clenching a fist in the fabric there.
“Yes,
He washed his hands, then turned to Scorpius. “Anything in particular you’d like for breakfast?”
He waved off her concern. “It’s not the
you!”
With a sigh, Draco sent back his confirmation for meeting with Astoria, refraining from the impulse to ask after Scorpius. Did his son talk about him? Did he miss his father? Or was he simply grateful to have distance from his emotionally constipated genetic provider?
“Draco Malfoy, open up your wards, you enormous shit; I’m coming through,” Pansy shouted through the fireplace.
“You wish,” Draco beamed.
Though Draco couldn’t see the broad width of Harry’s smile, he hoped the resulting hug would embody it. “Come with me.”
who beta'd for me (punctuation & plot-hole queen!!)
Draco’s mouth went dry, and his fingers flew in response.
And he read.
Harry’s stomach lurches. He looks over at Draco who has, mercifully, fallen asleep. Plucking the near full tumbler from Draco’s relaxed fingers, Harry chugs it in one.
Harry rolls his eyes. “If you want the drinks, you have to share the bed.”
Potter wasn’t completely invisible. He could be seen on rare occasions. At the weddings of various Gryffindors. At a choice few of the post-war charity events. At Platform 9 ¾ dropping off his godson.
“And now? Do you date?” Draco resisted the urge to cross his fingers.
“I’ll bite
Draco nodded. “Hermione’s told me about it. The search for horcruxes.”
Hermione’s whirlwind entrance finally helped Draco succeed in his efforts.
with a piece. Normally, I end a story with some semblance of where the characters are going, and an itch to keep telling their tale. This feels really wrapped up to me, and there's a lot of peace with that feeling.
They did as commanded, their eyes drifting over mismatched chairs, wobbly tables, a slightly-slanted stage, and lighting that faded from too bright to too dark throughout the bar.
They’d agreed to meet at her place, with Scorpius at Draco’s flat under his mother’s watch. Unlike Draco, Narcissa had been unrelenting in her request to continue visits with Scorpius. Just another reason for Draco to feel inadequate.
“Your kid?” Harry asked.
Nodding emphatically, she spelled her office whiteboard clean. Draco charmed his erasable quill to reflect his thoughts and Hermione watched silently as words and phrases wrote themselves.
to spend more time with him, don’t you?”
Harry buckled, drawing an arm across his stomach as if he’d been punched. “Draco?”
Draco looked at Scorpius, who tried to hide his yawn from his new heroes.
The plot accelerates. Harry makes his debut. Hermione starts to embrace her inner Slytherin. Scorpius needs to know how his father knows Harry Potter. Draco just wants to drink his wine in peace.
“Space,” Harry begged, his eyes wide, sweat dripping from his hairline, gripping his knees with white knuckles..
“For giving yourself the space to change. For not judging yourself for ending up somewhere you never expected to be. For allowing yourself to be happy.”
After a few minutes, she lowers her wand. “Mr Snow, you are a remarkable young man.”
Besides, he keeps giving Draco these
Harry nodded. “So you don’t go back, then?”
“Holy fuck,” Simon says, stroking the now luxurious golden curls sprouting halfway down his neck from his chin. His jaw drops (so does the hair). “I’ve always wanted to grow a beard.”
He took her hand, the grin on his face hurting with joy. “Deal.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Draco asked.
“Draco,” Harry said, eyelids flying open. “I want this.”
Draco filed that information away for later, but stayed the course, “My answer is still no.”
Looking at the empty second bottle of wine, Draco smiled. “Perhaps we should call it a night.”
“It’s not like I don’t appreciate her ambition for me,” Draco explained. “But every job offer just showed me that I enjoy my job, and have zero interest in advancing further.”
Me, one month later: I think this story needs a little Ginny redemption. And some more Scorpius; there wasn't enough Scorpius in the other chapters.
“Well, you have to announce it, of course.
Scorpius gave him a doubtful glance, but calmed down with the new information. Mother relaxed deeper into the couch, her hand twitching around a glass of wine.
“Mother!” He called out, and Astoria met him in the entryway to the kitchen.
“Now,” Harry claps his hands. “How about a round of twenty questions?”
As luck would have it, Scorpius preferred burnt pancakes, so Harry and Draco split the browned ones. All in all, it turned out to be a pleasant meal.
“Who? Oh, you mean Mike?” Harry shrugged. “Fine, I guess. We only talked for a minute or two before Treasure finished his post-show work. Why do you ask?”
Harry’s smile was still genuine, but pained. “You’re right, Draco. I would have. If I’d known what was at stake.”
. Draco didn’t need his pity.
My wand’s at his throat, my fangs are out (goodbye plausible deniability). It’s a whole production.
The itch returns, and I look up to see all beards (and sad mustache) shrink back into skin.
“I think I have something for you,” Harry said, giving Draco a meaningful look.
Harry pulls out the second bottle of clear liquor. “From Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” He adds, another reference over my head, then pours into each shot glass until full. “Now,” He sits up straight, “You drop the shot into the pint glass on my count and then drink it as fast as possible.”
I hum. “I wouldn’t be so sure about that.”
Scorpius pulled at Draco’s sleeve. “Can I go Father? Please?”
The office door opened.
“So, uh, Pansy,” Harry said.

The last few months had seen issue after issue chronicling their inane feuds over guest floo schedules and ceremony chapel timeshares. Things would only get worse when
It takes me a second to catch on, and Simon’s a step behind me.
“Harry.”
“You don’t get to have one,” Baz jokes, reaching his arm over his shoulder to flick my nose.
Draco didn’t know his heart could hurt this much.
This chapter brought to you by
“I’m missing something here,” Harry said. Draco finally looked up to see Harry flicking his eyes between the two of them, having noticed the change in their posture.
Draco winced. “I’m not sure about that. We’re still.” He sighed, and decided to gamble. “It’s not easy between us, but it seems to be easier when you’re around. Would you mind staying?”
The inside of Draco’s wrists.
Harry bounced in his seat. “Can I come?”
That was the word Ginny had used in her break-up note. Cozy. Because she wouldn’t admit in writing what she’d really meant. Instead, she implied the betrayal in subtext hand-delivered to Harry by Percy Weasley of all people.
Wasn’t that just good news?
Draco obliges Simon with a scowl that deepens when I join them. Looking at Harry’s subsequent advancement, “Oh no. The bed’s crowded enough without having to accommodate
“I thought my editor was having us all on, making a big to-do about a friendship, but Draco’s making a genuine expression, Potter. The kind that causes wrinkles if you hold it too long,” She stared at Draco again, who tried to school his face into something other than incriminating. “He

“You probably know them all,” He drawled, still reeling from Harry’s revelations. “My life seems tame in comparison. After the war, I spent a year in house arrest at the Manor; thanks again,” He raised his glass, which Harry met in another adorable clink, “For pulling the strings that kept me out of Azkaban. Then, I finished my schooling at Hogwarts a year after you. That’s how I met Astoria; she was two years behind us. We concocted our devious plan, graduated, got married. I started my probation at the Ministry, Astoria had Scorpius, we divorced, I was assigned to Granger, and I became a slut.”
“Well,” She said, flicking her eyes from person to person until she’d cast her gaze on everyone equally. “Mrs. Zabini, Mr. Potter, what an unexpected pleasure.”
“Until we spelled the stars together.”
“I’m an excellent actor.” Draco’s reddening face betrayed the minimal effort it would take to bluff the role.
“Salazar. This is where you live?” Draco asked.
I look at Simon, who’s still stroking his beard. “Come here,” I mutter, a wave of affection washing over me as I watch his entranced expression. I pull him by his too-tight t-shirt and press my lips against his. His mouth falls open in a groan and I relish the scratch of his beard against mine.
Harry nodded, his face tight. “I understand.”
Draco released him, a veil of coldness settling over his features.
Draco divested Harry of the next button, and Harry’s hand flew to the opening, clutching it closed like some kind of a virgin.
“I’m bisexual, actually,” Harry said at the same time Draco muttered, “I don’t think I have a
“Please take him,” Mother begged Draco before he’d even had a chance to swipe the Floo powder off his robes.
“Hand me back my hair, and we can arrange that,” Harry grinned.
“That’s amazing!” Lavender beamed. “It’ll have such an impact. Godric knows there are too many like me after the war.”
Furrowing his eyebrows, “Oh, I don’t think that’s true—“
They visited Zonko’s and Honeyduke’s before Scorpius begged them to see ‘the spot where it happened,’ aka the Shrieking Shack. Draco expected more jovial bantering from Harry as they revisited the scene of Draco’s embarrassment, but instead Harry got rather solemn. Knowing that there was likely a war story in his expression, Draco distracted Scorpius from his needling about mud fights of the past with promises of butterbeer in the future.
“Hey Malfoy!” Ron greeted, walking toward their table. Despite now being on a first name basis, sometimes they reverted. For old time’s sake.
Draco sighed. “Really, I should have talked to a Slytherin. Of course you don’t
for drinks at my bar!” His words faded as he strutted away.
Draco nodded.
Harry relaxed back in his chair, although his movement didn’t disturb Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand. Draco released it.
A small voice sounded from the hallway. “Father? What’s going on?” Then, Scorpius rounded the corner. “Aunt Pansy!” He screamed.
As quick as a wordless spell, Draco answered, “Fourth year, during the Tri-Wizard Tournament.” He paused. “I had… confusing reactions to Viktor Krum and Cedric Diggory.”
“Here,” Harry said, finally standing. “Come sit on the couch with me and your dad and tell us about it.”
“In that case, I should probably bribe you back. To comfort your snakey sensibilities,” She winked.
“No wandless magic in my office, please,” She frowns, but her upper lip trembles, like it’s holding back a smile.
Even though it’s been ages since I felt this light.
“Promise.” Draco held his son’s gaze for a moment longer, trying to express every ounce of determination on this effort. Trying to reflect every ounce of love he felt.
A brief review of previous events from Simon and Baz's perspectives, plus McGonagall helps solve a mystery.
“See what?” Harry hops in.
He looked so awful that when his mother arrived she’d told him she loved him, something she hadn’t said in years. Dazed with affection, Draco stepped into the fireplace, and only when he spun into the Ministry did it dawn on him that today was his turn in the rotation to pick up coffee for the department heads.
“It’s Zabini now,” Draco corrected. “And if it’s in ‘The Wrong Sider’, he knows. He’s only read the book 20 times.”
“Hit a nerve?” Simon says, flicking his eyes to Draco briefly before settling on Harry’s once more.
suddenly become a werewolf? Don’t shit on my enhanced senses. If I say I can smell happiness, then I can smell happiness.” She turned her probably-not-that-much-better-than-Draco’s-at-smelling nose up into the air.
“So,” She said, leaning over her desk. “After talking with you last week, about my fear of failure when starting this job, I started to think about all of the projects I’d wanted to tackle when I became Deputy Minister. And it honestly depressed me a bit. There’s still so much I want to accomplish. I complained to Ron, and he joked that I needed to double myself.”
“His name is Killian,” Astoria shared, her face taking on a honeymoon glow. “He’s… well, he’s not
Simon have magic. Or, more magic than he might have normally had.” He reaches out and grasps my hand. “And as soon as you realized, you gave it back.”
Draco waved his hand as if declining a second cup of tea, rather than explaining away how he’d willfully cut himself off from his son in a misguided act of protection. “The arrangement where Astoria and I marry despite having no interest in such a thing, sire an heir to unlock the contents of our vaults, and then Astoria raises the child alone without my involvement.”
He wandered the hallways, adjusting to the silence of his flat. Not that Scorpius had added much to the ambient noise. Still, Draco felt a stale quiet that made him feel empty deep inside. How could one person, and such a tiny one at that, take up so much space?
Draco had to suppress a gasp at this vulnerability: Harry’s green eyes, unguarded and earnest. Seeking Draco’s approval. If only his 11-year-old self could see this. “I do,” Draco responded, and he hoped Harry was too drunk to recognize the fond look Draco bestowed on him.
Oh. That explains his reaction, then. The hurt eases. “I’m sorry,” I offer.
Baz startles. “
“Draco,” Harry started.
With a brief kiss to the top of Baz’s head, Simon looks up at Harry and Malfoy. “We were roommates at school.”
“That’s a bad word,” Scorpius scolded, peering out of his bedroom and proving Pansy’s contretemps contagious.
“People keep offering me those,” Draco said. “I guess I’m just really huggable.”
“Of course I support it!” Hermione quickly backtracked. “You know I’ve wanted the two of you to become friends for ages.”
Pansy gasped. “Draco! You’re
“Yeah,” Harry smiled. “That she is.”
“Don’t walk away.”
“Have I gained a new assistant without knowing it?” Hermione asked, her confusion growing when Lavender passed out Hermione’s large black coffee with a splash of coconut milk on Draco’s behalf.
Harry grinned, sneaking a glance at Draco out of the corner of his eye. “I promised, didn’t I?”
“Someone cast a spell on me recently,” I explain. “It was meant to draw out my magic, assuming there was anything left. Instead, it made it so no one could cast spells on me. Not that I mind. I never liked having spells cast on me in the first place. But I am curious… as to what happened.”
Ten watercooler-side chats left Draco convinced everyone was reading ‘The Wrong Sider.’ The book had taken the whole wizarding world in Great Britain by storm. Draco wanted to believe that speculation behind the identity of its anonymous author drove its meteoric rise, but that was too optimistic for him. Best case, people were riding the wave to restart an anti-death eater bandwagon, and Draco could expect several months of howlers. Worst case, the public was starting to sympathize with those on Voldemort’s side. Draco didn’t need to explain the horrors behind that possibility.
