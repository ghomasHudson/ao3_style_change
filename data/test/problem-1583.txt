"Offer to skin his worthless hide!" yelled the disembodied voice. "Offer to kick him in the head!" the voice continued, and then began to laugh: an eerie, thin sound that sounded increasingly like a scream of pain. Things began to fall from the highest shelves. One of them shattered.
He honestly loved the way Draco was constantly touching him in public. The never-ending affection seemed to mend a hole in his soul he’d plastered over long before, then promptly tried to forget.

“Harry,” he eventually managed, helpless and shocked. “That’s… fucked up. I have treated you like shit. Hell, you have treated
Draco was pleased by the compliment, but it also brought back memories of tipsy nights when he'd struggled not to take Harry to his bed and give in to his overwhelming, shameful desires. So he simply said "Thank you," and stepped away from Harry so he could maintain his pretense of calm.
Everything he took was something Harry wanted to give. Everything he gave was just what Harry wanted to receive.
. He was suddenly, immeasurably sad. Draco insisted Harry couldn’t be in love with him. Maybe Draco was right about that, but whatever this feeling technically was, Draco had ripped it and stomped on it and…
Andromeda and her sister were fighting. Harry felt like sobbing out loud and begging Andromeda for comfort, but instead, he listened.
Draco paid the bill and hurried his mother to the Floo. “Vissy?” he called, and she was there, helping him settle Mother into a sun-lit chair with tea waiting at her right hand.
Malfoy, Harry realized as he helped Andromeda clean, ate his entire lunch without one complaint. Then he volunteered to entertain Teddy while Andromeda dealt with the kitchen. Harry said as much, but Andromeda just… looked at him. Chastened, Harry finished cleaning.
She was almost like McGonagall, if Draco thought a Gryffindor could be trusted to treat him — or any Slytherin student — with fairness. He almost giggled. Then he stopped. Dumbledore had been biased beyond belief, but had McGonagall? Truthfully?
“Course,” Harry said easily. He considered his next words. Should he say it was the order they’d agreed on? No. “I love sucking you.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Hmm,” Harry said, balancing his wand on one hand and pretending to feel calm. “You already know I like getting fucked.”
Draco marvelled at how ineffective it was. Nonetheless, his smile was very small; carefully contrite. He had no interest in hurting her. Only changing her behavior. Maybe, someday, even her
"Apparently," Draco said. "His seventh years do better on the N.E.W.T.s than Snape's did, and he has complete confidence that you and McGonagall will clear up 'this little wraith problem' quickly, or so he told my potions class the day before you arrived. Hogwarts is a safe place while there are still a few minor Death Eaters on the loose as well. But I think that's an excuse. I think he just forgot how much he likes the trappings of teaching. The free room and board, the prestige, the rising stars who feel indebted to him. I don't think he'll be leaving Hogwarts for years to come. And no other school will have me. I've asked."
Draco awoke in a chair. The golden web was no longer visible. The vials lay empty, discarded on the floor. Harry knelt before him, looking concerned. A house-elf hovered nearby. Draco’s vision jumped and wavered.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Harry cooed, letting the admiration go to his head. “Especially since we’re going to be stuck here, monitoring all these spells, for days.” Harry twisted his hips, pressing his cock into Draco’s prostate. Hard.

“Oh, well, you know!” Harry said. He waved both arms outward and promptly spilled his coffee. “Oh fuck!” Harry swore, and jumped up, watching helplessly as the last of his coffee poured all over the table and over onto the floor. “Shit, have you a rag? A tea towel?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco said nothing in response to Harry's little smile, so Harry poked him. "I like drinking hot chocolate. It's nice."
Draco grinned at Harry, who grinned back. Draco felt his ears warm, but didn’t care. This was really happening.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Then he Flooed to Harry’s and sat, heavily, on Harry’s grass-green chesterfield. Harry was at his hand moments later with a full tea tray, plus the offer of two empty glasses and a full bottle of scotch.
Andromeda nodded her approval. She set Teddy on the floor and charmed coloured sparkles to spin and dance above him. He sat on his bottom, reaching up and giggling.
Draco allowed this for a while, because it was wonderful at first. But it felt unbalanced, unfair, to just lie back and accept so much pleasure; so, shortly after Harry slid down Draco’s fully bared skin, Draco insisted on flipping around and turning a one-sided blow-job into an exploration of the position Harry called “sixty-nine.”
Leaving his hands in the soapy water, Harry leaned his head back onto Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve been known to. Occasionally. For the right man. Do you want to top?”

“You have set these new wards to discern the contents of my heart?” Mother eventually said, sounding quite waspish. Draco chose to focus on how long it had taken her to speak, rather than be hurt by her tone.
Draco leaned over to see what Harry had on his spoon. Harry put a hand on Draco's wrist, over the cloth but almost touching skin. Draco froze, then took a deep breath and looked again at the spoon, this time actually seeing what it held. "Yes, that's a square of fried tofu. I've tried to copy this soup, but I have no idea what their secret is. When I cook tofu it crumbles into flakes or irregular little chunks, no matter what I do."
Narcissa sipped her wine. “What about a diffusion door? They aren’t common, but I think a childhood friend had one. It helped her visit her grandparents in Wales whenever she liked, but kept her grandparents out of her mother’s hair.”
Harry nearly lost himself in slamming Draco’s hole, but not enough that he ignored Draco’s prostate. If Draco’s quiet wailing was to be believed, Harry’s diligence was appreciated.
my responsibility when the unbreakable vow was still in effect, but I hate both of those damn guttersnipes and I love the idea of shoving them together! And then Draco will fix it all and force Potter to admit he's an idiot! Potter is useless and why no one can see it but me I will never know!"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry offered to take them out for dinner in celebration, but Narcissa pled exhaustion, despite dinner being hours away. So Draco settled her at home, double-checked the Living Wards and his connection to them, and had Vissy and Bippy promise to call the moment she awoke.
Draco simultaneously pressed his erection into Harry, cradled Harry’s head where it had smacked the wooden floor, shoved Potter’s books away and told himself that this was a terrible idea and he must stop immediately.
“No,” Harry said, and Draco allowed him to touch his quivering lip once again. His cock started to harden and his heart pounded harder. It must have been audible. They were completely alone in the Great Hall and Draco decided that was unlikely to last.

"I don't like the 'Malfoy' part," he admitted, feeling unsure of himself. "It reminds me of your father, and he reminds me of Voldemort. But your first name is pretty brilliant, don't you think? Named after dragons and something in the sky… a galaxy? I can't remember."
Ugh. He didn't want to think about it. He was just glad Draco was studying Potions instead. Having Draco there to snark lovingly at him (Draco swore it was all meant lovingly) would
"Then the war was over and there was still so much work to do, and I almost never saw you. At first I was distracted, but then I started to miss you. Your wit, your edge, your sharp intelligence, your bravery, the way you never coddle my friends but had still learned - despite everything - to treat them with a respect that I could always see underneath your tease and fire.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Gonna fuck you good,” Draco said, trying to simultaneously tear off his and Harry’s clothes. “You’ll never forget tonight.”
Malfoy looked up at Harry, shocked. But he moved when he did, and now Harry found it even easier to reach Malfoy's growing dick. He continued to rub at it lightly with one finger.
"I believe I know the ring you speak of," the Merchieftainess said. "But if I am right, then I have… frustrating news. I am Merchieftainess Murcus, and have been for nearly thirty-five years. Twenty or so years ago, a child of my village brought me a ring he'd found while out gathering pretty rocks with his brothers and sisters. It was silver, with a fancy stone that shone like the moon. Engraved inside it said…" she paused and looked up to think. "It had your letters, ess ess, then a letter I did not recognize, perhaps a short tee. After that the letters ell and ee. Does that sound like the ring you seek?"
"Well, you did that already. And it worked. You shocked me outside the Headmaster's office. I'd never considered you, or any boy… that way… before. But I couldn't ignore the way I reacted to you. And now that I'm more aware of… this… I want us to explore this together. I want this to be real, Malfoy. Quit pretending to be someone you aren't."
"I can't keep calling you two by your names like this," Harry mused as Pansy knelt in front of him and began tonguing his soft cock. "You need nicknames. I think…" he tipped Pansy's chin and looked into her eyes. "You might do well to answer to 'Mouth.' It reminds me of that day you opened your mouth, trying to send me to Voldemort," - both slaves cringed - "but instead I tricked him into killing himself. With Malfoy's wand."
Draco swallowed and looked at Harry. Harry looked uncomfortable. No one spoke, and Draco felt his shoulders creeping toward his ears. Someone needed to break the silence. Could Draco do it? He shouldn’t have to, surely? Harry was the heroic one, the brave one.
“I see,” Potter declares, looking extremely intrigued. “I must say, the idea of a cock sucking expert with many hours of careful study under his belt, who nonetheless hasn’t actually sucked off a lot of men…. Suddenly your application has real appeal, Malfoy.”
not wanted to tell Mother about their dalliance, but once Harry had, Draco thought he’d described well to her the tightrope he’d intended to walk.
"Merlin's tits," Harry said, and desperately wished he were horizontal. Then he looked down to check on Malfoy. Malfoy, who had a softening cock in each hand. Malfoy, who had been jerking off. Malfoy had been masturbating.
Hoping he didn't need to ask the elder first, he reached up slowly and caressed Parkinson's left breast. The nipple hardened quickly. Fascinated, he flicked it with a slow fingertip. Ginny had never let him get further than occasional petting with all buttons buttoned and zippers upright and locked. This was new and wonderful, and Harry's cock was hard to ignore under his heavy clothing.
“I don’t know much about babies,” Draco admitted as little Teddy started to pull on Draco’s right ear.
“And don’t you forget it,” Draco said, his face open wide in bemusement. “Really, the whole world shall be surprised I deign to date you.”
He couldn’t be anyone’s hidden fuck, he decided. No, it was more a realization than a decision. As much as he wanted Harry, as often as he fantasized about submitting to Harry’s will, that was fantasy. In reality, in life, he was dominated in almost everything, in almost every part of his life. He couldn’t be humiliated in love, as well. It would destroy him.
"Well," Afelgate said, still caressing Mouth's clit with one hand, and allowing his other hand to wander up to stroke one of her tits, "there's no hurry, but within two, or maybe three years, if you push back hard, they will start insisting that you begin interviewing virgins for the privilege of carrying your children. Those babies will mostly be raised by their grandparents, as you'll be impregnating a lot of young teenage girls. Although you'll also be able to choose boys, if you wish. There's good magic for that now.
Every kiss was perfect. Every thrust of Draco’s gorgeous cock. Every murmured word. Every caress, every firm grasp, and every confident push.
Draco pressed his cheek to the red and gold wallpaper. There he stood, subservient, turned away from the door, waiting in impatient silence. Just before placing himself against the wall he had prepared himself with precisely the amount of lube Harry preferred – something he knew from experience and from Harry’s written instructions. Eventually a noise from the other room prompted Draco to reach back and spread open his arse cheeks. Harry had finally returned from work. Now he was ready to take Harry’s big erection, at the first moment Harry might like to fuck him with it.
Muggle libraries were impressive places, once you got the courage to enter, and to ask a librarian for assistance.
"Yes, they are what you think they are," Harry explained. "I want you to measure them both and go out to a few shops and buy them both a large assortment of clothing. Nothing for regular wear. I want leather, latex rubber, sex toys, corsets, bondage gear, skimpy costumes, anything you can buy. Make sure you can return it if I don't happen to like it. All right?"
feel about pretty girls. I hate that being with you feels simultaneously almost normal, while also completely wrong. In every way. I hate feeling I’m doing everything completely wrong.”
“Because I don’t agree with you about what that means,” Harry said, sounding gentle. He took both of Draco’s hands in his own. Draco let Harry guide him back to the bed. They sat next to each other and now they were both looking at their feet. Draco pulled his hands away from Harry’s, regretting it immediately. He began to wring them, and then regretted that immediately, as well. He dumped them in his lap and tried to forget they existed.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"As per usual, you think you know everything. But you don't know anything! You jump in like you can handle fucking anything!"
Draco smoothed his hand over the top of the settee. “Grandfather intended to choose your husband, but you and Father chose each other. You brought him to Grandfather, hoped he would allow the match. He was thrilled, agreed immediately.”
Draco’s aunt straightened her very straight spine, looked her sister in the eye, and started again. “Yes, Draco, I was saying changing to correspondence learning might be wise.”

Soon both slaves were not only nude, their genitals were completely hairless. Amused, Harry had his elves depilate both slaves everywhere else as well, until they both had no hair around their arseholes, on their legs, around their nipples, or on their faces. Pleased, Harry pulled both his slaves close, in what might have looked like a hug. He stroked their backs and arses firmly, enjoying their silken skin.
He would feel awful using a business’ floo without spending money, but he was confident Molly would love that snow globe, so that was one Christmas present secured, and months in advance, too.

Draco blanched and stared at the table. “I had convinced myself that... was not real,” he eventually said into the silence.
Draco's eyes widened and focused on Harry's hand. "I think you stretch me." He lay on his back and encouraged Harry to cuddle close, then he lifted his right leg and rested it on the wall.
Narcissa nodded at Andromeda, then at him, and then flooed away before he could do anything other than nod back once.
“Goodnight, Draco darling. Harry,” Narcissa said, her amusement audible if subtle. “I think the time has come for me to retire for the evening.”

Draco had attempted to express his gratitude for Severus' tender feelings, but Severus scoffed at the very idea. Nonetheless, Draco could clearly see that it was true. After all, no one else understood Severus - his life and sacrifices - the way Draco did. Slytherins, spies, marked, misunderstood. They had the worst things in common, and the best.
They talked through a long, four course meal: salad, soup, entree, dessert. Harry ordered a second bottle of wine and they were still talking about magic and technique as the restaurant emptied.

Harry leaned back. He'd deliberately chosen the comfortable chair. "And once everyone hears Scrivener's did these, your business will go through the roof, I expect."
She looked at him without any expression for a hot-then-cold painful moment, but Harry held his ground. The she tipped her chin to the left and allowed herself a tiny, crooked smile. "You know, Mr. Potter, while I couldn't possibly authorize your taking control of both of them, I can fully understand that you might need to… test them both out for a few days, before you choose which of them is to be your…" she paused and her grin, and tone, grew self-satisfied. "… long term choice."
“I know I’m not exactly being normal here,” Harry admitted, spinning Draco out and back in to the music on the radio. “But this is not a normal day!” He hugged Draco again, and Draco chuckled.
“I’m tempted,” Draco said, looking at his tea. “But it sounds like… an uncomfortable process? You would be there for… everything?”
“Sure,” Draco said, grateful for an equitable offer that he had not had to invent. He gestured toward the chair Harry was standing behind. “Would you like to have a seat?”

“Heroes don’t kiss?” Harry lay on his kitchen table, legs dangling off the side. He felt drunk, randy, and desperately attracted to Draco. “Or heroes don’t kiss other boys?” Frowning, he reached to stroke Draco’s collar.
Five and a half hours later, sitting on a Eurostar train speeding them toward Paris; Harry and Malfoy toasted the brilliance of being able to combine wizard and Muggle lives. As train rides went, it would be a long one: from London, to Paris, to Milan, and finally to Lecce, Italy. It nonetheless easily beat the magical alternative. They had driven the tent back onto the Scottish coast and shrunken everything down into four parcels that looked like Muggle luggage. They'd made it all as light as possible via magic (not very light, but they could still carry it), walked to the nearest wizard Inn (thanks to Malfoy's knowledge of the local area, that had only taken ten minutes),
“Mother,” he said, turning from the sleeping image. “I visited your sister Andromeda today,” he continued, recalling Grandfather’s advice to try to repair the rift between the sisters.
In response, Draco simply squawked out a strange noise and shook his head, clearly astonished. Then he opened another beer and tipped half down his throat.

"Not right now," Harry said. "Thanks, though." And he stared at the countryside speeding by, mulling over everything they had both said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The young King’s beauty nearly stole Draco’s false outer calm. His skin was a warm brown, with golden undertones. His hair was a wild tangle of deep, black curls and twists. His eyes were as green and luminescent as emeralds.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Neville laughed again, smiling. Harry sat on the windowsill and looked toward the room, but he wasn’t really paying attention to Neville right now. His eyes were nominally focused on the top of the door frame, but his mind was far away.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
He didn't bother showing them around. Once they arrived in his bedroom he turned to face them, opening his trousers just enough to pull out his dick, still soft after two recent orgasms. "Parkinson, get on your knees in front of me and suck me. Don't try to make me come, just give me pleasure."
“Just,” Mother swallowed once, then straightened her already perfectly straight spine. “Just be my warrior, Miss Granger.”
Finally, Malfoy spoke. “I might have said that, Potter, but I’m surprised you were listening. I recall you spent that entire meeting vacillating between fury that I’d been called in, and drooling over my arse in these Muggle trousers.”
“Not because I cannot lift as many pounds. I could levitate anything Lucius could. I proved that quite early. We were both slightly tipsy, after our first successful garden party. Swaggering, Lucius challenged me to a magical contest, but he did not win.” She leaned forward slightly. “He was unaware, but we only tied because I knew not to show off my full magical strength.”

“Yes,” Draco sputtered, regaining control of his senses. “You should fuck me; hard, fast and dirty. Then we catch our breath, start over. Only the second time, we’ll go slow, patient.”
“Just as you say, Mother,” Draco said, but his brow was still furrowed. He sat on the couch next to Harry, who took his hand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
should punish? Wait… no, perhaps that is what Master tries if rewards fail? Since slaves opposite, then
“Yeah?” Harry said, and kissed Draco on the cheek, clearly slightly distracted. “Can you tell me all about it while I get ready for dinner? I need a shower, and I suspect I should hear the whole story before we sit down with your Mum.”
They spoke about work, silly little things about the Ministry: oddly charmed window scenes, memos fluttering everywhere, strange Unspeakables who seemed to lurk obviously — as though they were reveling in their mysterious reputation, only pretending to not want to be seen. There was nothing much to say about Draco’s cramped, beige flat, but they spoke about the work Harry was doing on his house. Sirius Black had left it to Harry and apparently the place was a bit of a dump.
Narrowing his eyes, Draco tried to regain his control. “You like teasing?” he asked, putting his own hand onto Harry’s abs.
He smiled broadly at Draco, and in return, Draco found himself smiling back, almost relaxed. “Where are we going?” he asked, as they stepped onto the street. “How do we get there?”
I interrupted you,” Harry said. He sounded sad. Draco had made Harry sad. He hadn’t even said no, and Harry was sad?
They quickly retire to Draco’s bedchamber, where Potter pulls out his wand and performs the usual barrage of spells to secure and then seal the room. Once Potter is done, Draco pulls the rest of his uniform off, and pushes him toward the bed. “On your back, Guard,” he says happily. Once again he tries to remember why he only does this once a month instead of once a week. Or every night. Or twice a day. His harem has nothing on these big, beautiful erections. “Lube your cock. I’m more than ready to ride you all the way to heaven.”

Harry found sleep elusive at first. He lay in his barely-large-enough bed, wondering how he and Malfoy could manage to work together long enough to fix Snape's mess and never have to see one another again.
Harry felt warm oil spilling onto his back. He felt strong hands spreading it, pressing it into his skin, his tense shoulders and strained lower back. Then he felt the oil warming, heating, intensifying. For a moment he worried it would heat to an uncomfortable temperature, but it stopped just before, the heat sinking deeply into his tense muscles and relaxing him.
“My Lord King,” Draco tried to say, but there was a cock fucking his mouth, tongue, throat, and his words came out as a loud, wanton moan of lust.
Malfoy's lower back now shined with a large 'X' with a circle around it. The right leg of the 'X' was a bright red phoenix feather, the other leg was a very narrow version of the sword of Gryffindor, and the circle around them stated 'Property of Harry James Potter.' Behind it all glowed the irregular red chunk of the philosopher's stone. The whole picture stood about seven inches tall and five inches wide.
Then he'd gotten drunk with Harry, laughed at Harry's jokes, tried to hide his attraction and responded with overwhelming enthusiasm when Harry had asked for permission to….
Harry took his hand, despite needing to finish getting dressed. “Maybe a little,” he said, his tone and words unusually gentle, even for him. “Are you trying to protect her, or are you just… going to miss her?”
Draco, Harry realized, was normally more controlled than Harry was. Even when they were little boys of eleven, and neither of them had much self-possession, Draco – Harry decided – had more.
On Thursday Harry was sitting in the kitchen finishing a sandwich when Dudders suddenly appeared next to him, vibrating with excitement. Harry was reading a magazine and didn't notice Dudders at first, but then his elf coughed. Loudly. Harry dropped the magazine.
a man. We were both happy, engaged in meaningful work, spending time with people who cared about us. But when we made a connection, we each found something special. What we’re building here, this is no accident. I’m taking deliberate steps. Toward you.
"That cuddling is very nice, Mouth," Harry said, feeling magnanimous. "So is this hand job. You each earn three gems."
Stupefied by Draco’s insane behavior, Harry paused, blinked, then looked around slowly at his friends.
There was no queue at this hour, and Draco flooed home quickly. Home to his building’s dingy beige lobby, that is. Draco couldn’t afford a flat with floo access included. Though honestly, he wasn’t sure he would actually want it, considering the security risk involved.

time he asked Harry on a date (and got rejected), Michael was impressed, but Harry knew the attraction wasn’t about “heroics.” Michael was genuinely attracted to him: as a man, a person, and (potentially) a sexual being.
That was before. It had taken time, apologies, self-reflection and slight shifts of perspective to get Harry to see Draco as a friend.
She clapped her hands and four fully cloaked figures of varied heights and widths, herded by a pair of intimidating guards, shuffled in through a door Harry had not noticed. Since Harry couldn't see the prisoner's faces, he looked at the guards. He didn't recognize them, but was impressed by their bulk, their double-wanded weaponry, and their remarkably fearsome costumes of leather, metal and sparking, visible magic.
“Yeah?” Harry asked as they stepped into the lobby. It was empty, and Draco didn’t know whether to be pleased or disappointed. He had neighbors who would surely be a great deal nicer to him if they saw him stepping out with Harry Potter, of all people.

Harry helped Draco decide what to eat, and he ordered for Draco when the waiter came. Despite the cafe’s name, Draco was able to order a small chicken parmigiana, which turned out to be quite nice, despite being one of the cheapest things available. He got a salad as well. It turned out to be enormous, so he shared it with Harry.
“Bisky?” Draco called, and his house-elf appeared. Bisky helped him find Mother in the sunroom. She seemed pleased to see him, asking if he had enjoyed visiting Harry.

Putting down her teacup, Mother paused to search Draco’s eyes. “I have heard,” she began delicately, “about some of the methods involved in creating Living Wards. Does this explain why the square Persian rug was not covering the golden X in the main drawing room when I returned?”

“To me?” Draco said, surprised. He squeezed Harry tightly, then let go, moving the few steps to sit on Harry’s grass-green chesterfield. He put his glass on the coffee table.
Harry didn’t bother answering with words. He kissed Draco thoroughly, then pushed his shoulder. It was just the smallest gesture, but Draco gave him an outsized, exaggerated wink and sank immediately, gracefully to his knees.

"Your side is asking a lot of me, Boy Who Lived. I'll be asking something in return." Then Malfoy pressed his hips into Harry's. To Harry's overwhelming surprise, he felt his blood rush down, felt himself grow half-hard, felt himself fill with a longing he couldn't quite place - except that it had something to do with Malfoy's slim, pale neck, his warm hips, his pretty hair. He relaxed his arms just enough to allow Malfoy to press into him. He left his hands on Malfoy's chest, doing nothing at all with them.
And when she put it like that, Harry felt simultaneously better and worse. He’d not been honest with Malfoy. Especially when
Harry fucked in slow, in deference to Draco’s situation: tender, fully fucked, already orgasmed. He needed to make this good, needed Draco to accept this arrangement for their entire stakeout. He’d longed to be in exactly this position for far too long to fuck this up now.
Harry continued, “You’re worried I wanted to fuck out here because it was easy, and now I’m just looking for something convenient. What I think will be news is, I’ve had my eye on you for months.”
“I really doubt you will,” Draco said, making sure they kept eye contact. “We checked your fingernails carefully, you washed your hands, and I know what I like. You know? Are you sure this isn’t about, er, you know….”
“Perhaps,” Draco said. “Or perhaps you underestimate your own willingness and ability to tell the rest of the world to take a flying leap.”
It had been nearly seven weeks since his first day on the job. Draco was getting accustomed to the methods the Aurors preferred, the forms which really mattered, the departments and superiors Head Auror Bergum most wanted him to butter up, or impress with the department’s efficiency, proficiency, and expertise.
Harry didn’t bother to voice agreement. He simply turned Draco around, pushed him up against the sturdiest tree captured inside their wards, and cast a few spells as he pulled their clothing down.
He unpacked his own little bag, not wanting a house-elf even for a few moments. He thought to change into more comfortable clothing, but once nude he stopped, paused, then ran himself a scalding bath.
Weasley was due any minute. Draco had managed to apologize to Madame Rosmerta already — and she’d been remarkably gracious about it — but could he possibly manage a proper apology for
“Oh?” Draco replied, cool unconcern layered all over him. Harry was beginning to see the tells, though. Draco was really into him. Or Harry’s dick, at least.
“You can go, do something else around your house,” Harry said, pushing up his robesleeves. “This part is going to take quite a while.”
“Yeah,” Draco said in a soft voice, like he was still surprised. “I’ve gone and done all this apologizing, I’m eating all this healthy food, and my aunt is really proud of me. I think my mother is, too.”
to Hogwarts and spoken frankly and worriedly to McGonagall. Then, with her blessing and a Hogwarts expense account, they'd
Wand in hand, Harry opened his door. Malfoy looked… bedraggled. Instead of looking at Harry, his eyes were cast at the floor. Instead of threatened by Harry’s outstretched wand, his own drooped from his robe pocket. His hands were not at his hips, or reaching out to attack. They didn’t offer a handshake. Limp, they barely clutched each other, crossed in front of Malfoy’s robe-covered cock.
The morning of the festivities, Draco had arrived extremely early to reserve the best space with his large blanket and his magical picnic basket. He was quite pleased to see he was just early enough to take the space he had chosen, for as he rolled out his large blanket and put his shoes in one corner and the basket in the opposite corner, other picnickers arrived and looked toward his area.

They pulled one another’s clothes off, awkward and eager and messy, and Draco bent over to yank his wand out of the pocket of the trousers he’d just pulled off. He finally had a real reason to cast the spells he’d been practicing at home: to clean himself, stretch himself, lubricate himself for Harry’s convenience and pleasure.
, Draco thought sadly. Then he caught sight of the way Harry was clearly forcing himself to submit, to be quiet and outwardly calm; the way Harry's ignored erection looked so hard it probably hurt.
Casting a few spells to ensure their privacy, Harry put his two increasingly heavy cases down and encouraged Draco to do the same. They sat next to each other at a small picnic table that -- based on the crisp packets and other discarded wrappers stuffed in the small rubbish bin nearby, was usually a place people grabbed a bite of junk food before or after catching a train.
"So, here's the situation, Draco. I'm not leaving. I am deeply horrified by what Lucius taught you and put you through. I am honored to be the man you would try to work through that sort of childhood
“I feel much more adult these days, Mother,” Draco said, bracing his hands on his thighs and leaning forward just a touch. Mother waited for him to continue.

Harry took a step closer. “Oh, certainly,” he said as quiet as he could. He watched Malfoy turn his head a touch to listen intently.
Neville raised his wand and shot a locking spell at their door without opening his eyes or turning away from the ceiling. He hit the doorknob square on and it glowed for a half second. Harry raised his eyebrow but said nothing. He’d seen how confident Neville had become with casting since they had returned for their “Eighth Year,” five weeks previous.
"The part where you can keep yourself from dying, accidentally, because another teenager rejected you
Then Draco declared he would eat with the Slytherins, and left. Harry watched Draco’s arse as he walked away from the Gryffindor table.
“Harry and I had been… flirtatious. Creating the wards proved to be an… intimate experience. Several bodily fluids were required for the wards to be created at their most strenuous, and, er…”
“I should use a guest bedroom,” Draco said, his eyes enormous and his mouth tight. Harry didn’t notice. “Don’t have one,” he said, and sat on the foot of his bed to remove his shoes and socks.
Quite a few of whom looked like they couldn’t decide whether this was the show of the century, or they really ought to GTFO before magic started to fly. Indiscriminately.
Draco spent long moments on Harry's shoulders, then his arms, then his back, then his arse. Just when Harry was starting to hope his boyfriend would turn the massage sexual, Draco moved down to Harry's thighs and then his calves. Draco worked hard on Harry's feet, and the massage seemed almost over, but then his boyfriend simply started back up Harry's legs.
“No one had ever mentioned such a thing before,” Draco said, peeking at his Aunt. She nodded once, so he continued. “So I had to figure out for myself whether or not it was true.”
"You should go nap," Harry said, feeling smug as hell. "It's been nearly two hours. I don't think they have the ability to catch up anymore."
together and all the rest if this wasn't serious? The little kids are terrified! Snape's wraith is a fucking menace and he's ruining the school year for everyone! He's a million times worse than Peeves ever is, and he's getting more dangerous every damn day! He's already sent at least three people I can think of to the hospital wing!"
, well. He might as well go ahead and work those fifty, sixty hour weeks, warm something to eat from a can or a box, and go to bed early enough to indulgently wank for an hour before he relaxed and fell asleep with a true, uninhibited smile on his face for the first time all day.

"I don't like queers!" the seven or eight foot tall King boomed. It came through the translation and bubble-head charms as particularly threatening, or perhaps that was all the spears.
"Now let's see if I understand the picture you wanted, all right? Can you twist that dildo around a bit, pull it out and back while I do a mockup here?"
Harry’s reaction was surprisingly intense. He sobbed out one abrupt noise. Tears filled his eyes. He blinked them away and gathered Draco close. “I love you, too,” he murmured into Draco’s hair. “So much.”

“Good,” his King praised. He put a hand into Draco’s hair and scratched through the blond strands once, making a shiver run down Draco’s spine. “But get that hand wet. I want you to work me with your hand while you suck hard and caress me with your tongue.”
On Saturday morning Dean was still fast asleep when Harry returned from his shower. Neville winked at him, and they quietly got dressed in denims and light jumpers before tiptoeing out of the room and heading down to breakfast.
“Sadly, no,” Draco admits. “The Aurors confiscated it as potentially Dark, when they swept the Manor shortly before my exoneration at trial. Nonetheless, I had many hours of opportunity with the device, and as I was confined to my room while I had use of it, I used it almost exclusively for… masterbatory benefit.” Draco holds his head high, but he can feel his cheeks heat.
"Thank you, Severus," McGonagall said calmly. Then she turned to Harry and Draco. Her eyes flicked to their joined hands, but she said nothing. "I do hope you will both stay to dinner, gentlemen. The school owes you both a tremendous debt of thanks. Harry, you are also welcome to stay the night if you would like. The house elves can easily make up a guest suite for you. Until then, however, I have a great deal of work to do. Including informing a large number of parents that you have solved the problem that most concerned them!" She smiled, and Harry bowed at her, feeling joyous. Still holding Draco's hand, he moved for the door and they left together, trotting down the stairs together, still hand in hand.
But Draco had read Potter completely wrong. He had not been there to scuttle Draco’s interview, but to upend it. Draco had been offered the job that very morning, and had accepted immediately. He hadn’t worked less than a fifty hour week since. He was determined to be the best damn departmental manager possible. The best in the entire Ministry. The best in history. Harry Potter was never going to regret intervening on Draco’s behalf, not once. Not if Draco could help it.

“With Father… away,” Draco said carefully, “perhaps you would like to have your remaining sister back in your life?”
Harry put both hands on the counter and took a deep breath. “I’m sorry I instigated a fight over Teddy right in front of him. If you can honestly call that little… tiff, a fight?”
And — he could see it clearly now — it was Harry’s fault. He’d been dismissing Draco as a colleague when he should have been cosseting him like a lover.
"I missed that fire, Draco, I missed your spirit. After a month or two, I realized no man could compare to you, and I didn't want to pretend or make do, so I sought you out and tried to get inside your polite, aristocratic defenses. I could tell you were interested, and yet what a merry chase you led me on! You wanted me, yet you seemed to hate the very thought of wanting me. I didn't know why, but as long as you let me follow you around, I didn't much care.
“I came while you were coming in my mouth,” Harry said before Draco could even worry about what Harry's soft cock meant. Harry looked embarrassed and pleased at once. “I love getting you off. I love feeling you come. That was so fucking hot, Draco. I just, er, rubbed against your thigh while I fucked you with the dildo.” Harry paused. “We are
Harry smiled and squeezed Draco's shoulder very slightly. Draco's cock jerked uncomfortably in response.
Dumbledore's face opened up into a warm, kindly smile. "I believe you remember a house-elf named Dobby?"
They rushed on foot. “Wards,” Harry’d groaned. But the house was small and soon they were stripping and kissing; panting and falling, naked, onto Harry’s big, soft bed.
"No." Draco was a bit shocked at how uncompromisingly he spoke the word, but his cock ached under his robes.
But not right now. Harry finished a beer and opened another as Draco finished the entire bag of Doritos. Right now Harry was trying to mend fences, as Andromeda had insisted. Low, cutting remarks wouldn’t help. And yet, he really had to restrain himself! Especially after having drunk so much beer.
Miserable, trying not to fill his heart with hope, Harry ignored his better judgement and listened — rapt — to every word. Draco loved him. Wanted him. Was utterly and completely queer. And yet, they’d not so much as waved at one another from across a large room in three months.

“It’s all right,” Harry said. “I was nervous at first, too. Come on, love. You said I earned a shag, yeah?”
“I… apologize,” Harry said to Vissy. “I’ve had so few clients who’ve called me after a wards breach, let alone between such vicious attacks. I’ve no other clients with house-elves. This isn’t my area.”
They kissed for a few more minutes, relaxed and undemanding, until Draco slowed them. He wanted to have the talk they’d been gearing up for. Harry was a living legend to some, but Draco nonetheless thought he could be brave enough to ask for what he really wanted.
Draco wanted to swoon, or shriek, but instead he reached out to unfasten the King’s breeches, as demanded.
Parvati patted Harry’s hand and Lavender gave him a warm, caring smile. Seamus snickered quietly at the admission but Neville spoke up. “And there’s nothing to be ashamed about with
“Decorated war heroine,” Mother said, nodding, and Draco nodded back, hoping he wasn’t hurting his mother’s feelings but needing to continue, even if he was.
"Mr. Potter. What do you think would happen if you were to open a storefront on Diagon Alley charging witches and wizards a few galleons for the privilege of sucking your cock?"
"I thought I would be able to get over you, Harry," Draco said, staring at the floor. "I sent you away and waited to get over you. You will note, however, that I asked you to wait for me instead of telling you to leave me alone and never come back. You will also note that, well... here we are."
, but McGonagall has a very good case for needing you, quite specifically. You know Hogwarts better than most, you have a hell of a track record for solving mysteries specific to the school, and Snape's wraith itself is insisting you are required. I suppose it's that last one that's tipped me over the edge on this."
"Ok," Harry said nervously, "er, I can do that. I thought you liked pretentious stuff, yeah. Back when we were both at Hogwarts you talked a lot about money, and you always had nice stuff, and you made fun of Ron because his family doesn't have as much as yours. And you always wanted people to think you were better than we were. Um, didn't you?"
Malfoy looked surprised, then pleased. "I suppose we should find out, then, shall we?" he replied. Draco rolled onto his right side and pulled Harry over closer, rolling Harry onto his left. Draco pulled Harry's right arm over his side and kissed him once. Then he smiled and - throwing his left leg over Harry's hip - grabbed their hard cocks in his left hand and began to stroke up and down their shafts. Harry's eyes rolled back in his head and he groaned.
He had to face facts. He didn't date anymore. He sucked at his job. He got drunk a lot and he was probably gay. Possibly bisexual, but definitely attracted to Malfoy. His dick got a little harder and his eyes snapped open. This was intolerable. He leaned over, picked up the paper off the floor, turned to put it on his chair as he stood and then shuffled out of the seat into the aisle, wishing he was wearing concealing wizard robes because his erection wasn't getting bigger anymore but it wasn't going away, either.
“I have a few ideas,” Abraxas said slowly, “but I don’t wish to share them with you without first consulting someone else among the living.”
"Then wrap a hand around my cock and jerk me off while I ride your dick," Draco said coyly, blushing and smirking and rolling his eyes a bit again. Clearly, he'd dealt with the past already, better than Harry had, for certain.
Anticipating, Draco held his breath, awaiting Harry’s penis, his thrusts, his fuck. He was not forced to wait long. He felt Harry’s cockhead, just there, Harry crowding close, then Draco’s body was surrendering to Harry’s big cock. He exhaled, finally, feeling his day restart, his sun rise. He loved this more than anything in his life.
“I first visited to satisfy Mum,” Draco said, picking at the label on his bottle and not looking at Harry. “But Aunt Andromeda pushed me to hold Teddy, feed him. The first time he fell asleep while I was holding him, I… I guess I just fell in love.”
“No parties,” Mother said. “I can wait until after the trial. That does seem sensible. Will I ever have a grandchild?” Her voice broke on that last word, and Draco rushed to his mother, who clutched his clothes and sobbed onto his shoulder.
"But you should finish up the exams. I'm sure you have plenty of work to do back at the hospital, and I was going to nap before dinner."
Draco sat down, hard. “Holy hell,” he said in a harsh whisper. “Do you think that’s where this is coming from? Sexism?”
Harry managed to keep his mouth shut, somehow, but he saw his inability to keep his shock off his face acknowledged in McGonagall's tiny grimace of disapproval.
“Only in the sense that I feel very comfortable with you,” Harry said, sounding decisive. “I’m happy to be very informal. But I want us to be monogamous.”
“Spray come on the ground?” Harry scolded. “Too easy to track. No, I need to come inside you, and you need to come inside… me. So, do you want me to suck your cock before, or after I top your beautiful arse?”
), Harry Potter was not actually going to show up at Draco’s miniscule flat in half an hour! But… what if Draco had not imagined him? After all, it was the weirdest fantasy. Nothing like Draco’s usual. No submission, no sex. Harry had no confidence, Draco had on all his clothes. The coffee had even spilled. Did that mean it had really happened? It had felt so real while it was happening….
“Yes, lovely?” Draco asked. He knew full well his smile had gone dopey, but decided — he didn’t much care.
He was there, waiting in the hall near Harry, making small talk with Su Li. He was facing away from Harry. Harry maneuvered himself to the other side of the hall.
This time they managed to get out of the submarine tent without making much of a mess inside it at all. They took the ugly ring, the copied map, and a short note that Merchieftainess Murcus had written up as introduction and request. Taking deep breaths and reaching out to hold one another's hands without really thinking it through beforehand, they began the walk to the front gate of the castle.
Hermione and Ron were eager to know everything, but he made it clear that he couldn't talk about it and went up to bed. He told himself he was tired, but when he was finally in his pyjamas with clean teeth and hiding behind his thick, warm curtains, Harry was able to admit to himself that it wasn't exhaustion that had sent him to his bed only two hours after dinner ended. He was hard. His mind was full of his encounter with an aggressive, sneering, white-pink-gold pretty Malfoy.
