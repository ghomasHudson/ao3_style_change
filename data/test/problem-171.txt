Those lions really couldn't leave well enough alone. What made them think they had the right to dig into other people's personal lives, anyway? Curiosity should just do them all a favor and kill the cats already.
The lake was... nothing like Draco would've expected. He thought the water would be dark and grimy closer to the bottom, his vision obscured by weeds. Yet, he could see all the minor details with a shocking amount of clarity. Although the sunlight from the surface didn't reach this far down he was still able to make out all the figures in the dark. What he couldn't see in the distance, he could smell. The Grindylows burrowed in the weeds, a small school of fish on the other side of a rock to his right...
He nodded an affirmation, and he watched Andrew cloak himself before the two swam off. It had been his idea to split up, as he knew he needed to get comfortable being by himself in the water. If absolutely necessary, he could easily locate the other two of his pod through echolocation.
Bloody hell, she knew? Was there anyone in this damn castle that wasn't aware of its siren occupants? Why was Draco just finding out about all these people now?
The continued shaking of her shoulders was a nice touch. He shushed her and put on the most pained face he was capable of.
Severus came back in, looking slightly out of breath. "You've been dismissed from your classes for the day. Cassiopeia is dismissed as well, from every class except for Defense."
Now, more attuned to others' energies... Draco could feel the shock and dread rolling off of Potter in waves. Interesting... perhaps Potter had not been the one to chance entering his own name? But, who did? Why?
"Dracoooo-," she drawled out the last vowel, "no one will ever know we were there! We can enter the lake from the pool here in our rooms! By the time the second task rolls around, you'll be almost completely mature! That means a tail, scales perfect for camouflage, it'll be great practice for navigating while trying to avoid being out in the open."
"Hermione, you've met my cousin Draco, so sorry if he's been a real sod to you in the past." Cassie shoved him forward like the petulant child that she was, and Draco wished he'd made up an excuse about his gills still hurting.
The hike through the forest felt like a blur. It had been a far walk--was it three miles? Four?--yet it felt like it had only taken them five minutes. The trees were thinning out, the beige castle walls peering through to confront him. They stopped, and Corey reached into his knapsack to rummage around.
Ron seemed unphased, nodding in response to Harry's question, but ducking to the side to look behind him.
"First you'll have to teach me how to brew it." Along with every other relevant siren-created potions that he'd been too incapacitated to help brew the first time around. It also wasn't helpful that most of the ingredients needed were sold in apothecaries on the Islands, a place he had yet to travel to.
"Now, who can tell me what the five kinds of sirens are?" Moody and his twirling prosthetic eye made Draco feel nauseated.
Her words had grown into a hurried excitement by the end. Draco was glad she found his birthright prophecy so fascinating. He loved not having a say in his destiny. Not having a choice in the war.
The doorknob began to turn, and Draco leapt back. Cassie poked her head in, not amused with his behavior, grabbing his wrist and dragging him out into the parlor.
"Would you like to join me tomorrow afternoon to study? I can meet you outside of the Great Hall after lunch," Draco offered, and Harry began nodding in agreement before Draco could even get his full sentence out.
There was a tapping on the door. It creaked open to reveal McGonagall, who hurried in to close the door behind her. It was daylight now, and although they were in a part of the castle that was unfrequented they still had to take precautions. If Draco were accidentally seen...
"Severus, thank you for coming." Lucius Malfoy looked gaunt. It did nothing to ease the terror swirling in Snape's gut, but it also didn't make it any worse.
"I was doing just fine," she replied, "until you pulled at my magic again. I blame you for this mess."
"Is this because he's human? I know this is scary, Dray-" Corey's sentence fell off at the sound at a twig snapping from behind.
He opted to slide in versus diving straight in, still not 100% comfortable in the water. As he got in, he let his glamours drop, letting the cool water rush through his gills as his dorsal fin flexed, having been a few days since he last stretched them out. Compared to Cassiopeia, he felt like a baby bird, awkward and ugly-looking as its feathers grew in.
Harry couldn't even find it in him to get mad at the nonsense Ron was spewing. He would be here tomorrow, they would see for themselves! Draco would be back, and Harry could finally talk to him about-
He retracted his hand like he'd been burned, hitting himself for being so careless when Draco was wounded. Yet as soon as he pulled back, Draco growled, grabbing at the waist of his robes to pull him back towards him.
He found his date, her sister, and Ron sitting at a table. All had their arms crossed, and the twins were glaring at Ron (and, now, Harry by proxy).
"I'm sorry," Draco said, his voice trembling. They were all mad at him and it was all his fault. He couldn't handle it when people were mad at him.
Lupin's chest bloomed with relief. The old Snape he knew would never reach out the olive branch like this, allies or not. Having a daughter had changed him drastically for the better.
Potter, frozen in his spot, was shouldered out of the way by a fuming Cassie. Draco was quick to fall in step, not sure how much more he could witness her covering for him. The more details released, the weaker their lies became. Although, Cassie being a skilled liar certainly moved the odds in their favor.
While temporary, the potion dampened his connection to Harry as much as one could without severing it (AKA: killing Draco). He hated the loss he was left with--like a gaping wound festering where a limb had been lost. It didn't affect Harry the same way, but Severus and Andrew had gathered it was because he wasn't a siren. The bond affected him differently as it was.
Draco was rattled as a shoulder roughly bumped his, his godfather rushing to his daughter's side. He looked behind him to find the room cleared, only a few sirens lingering here and there as they talked to Professors Flitwick and McGonagall, both Dumbledore and Umbridge nowhere to be seen.
How did Draco know this? His stupid bond was doing things it shouldn't be able to, like giving him a front row seat to Harry's surroundings at random moments of the day. It wasn't something he could trigger or turn off or control in any manner, and it was driving him insane. Plunging into his mate's brain randomly throughout the day was nonsensical, and Harry couldn't even perceive it was happening. The thick Gryffindor was only aware because Draco had informed him, which was as helpful as teaching a Grindylow to crochet.
"Put that thing down, you're not helping!" she yelled, making a move to snatch the wand away from him. The Headmaster evaded the movement and in the moment he was distracted Harry dove to kneel in front of Draco.
While they were all users of magic, none had wands. They wore muggle clothing and played muggle games and did things the muggle way. It was mind-blowing to watch how different the two worlds were.
Ron's eyes widened. "Oh! That's right, you wouldn't- Well, with Pure-blood families, it's expected that the Heir will continue on the family bloodline. Malfoy's the Heir in his family, so it would be expected he'd marry a witch, but since he's ill that expectation for him gets waived. The Lord can pick a distant relative instead as the Heir... Wait, I wonder about that cousin of his, the American? Maybe she qualifies..."
Albus. This is personal. If you haven't forgotten, everything I've done for the past two decades has been for her. You promised to help keep her safe, so pardon me if I don't immediately run to you when you fail to keep that promise. I trust very few when it comes to Cassiopeia's safety, and you've been dropped from that list."
Severus did not seem amused at being called a 'giant teddy bear' by Cassie. Although, his true thoughts on the matter were hard to decipher, as his facial expression remained stoic as ever, and he simply stared at her just a second too long before acting like he hadn't heard her.
"Harry loves you, and nothing will change that. He's a Gryffindor, so while he may do stupid shit every now and then, he's going to protect you no matter what. He'll
If he let himself get close to Harry, allowed himself down that path... If Harry ever changed his mind, if he decided he could no longer handle the idea of Draco... It'd be the end of it. He'd be subjecting himself to a life of misery, a most painful and slow death stemmed from the agony of his own heart.Â Even worse, if Harry did not make it out of this war... Very few sirens were strong enough to overcome the grief. If they didn't go mad, they died of starvation, unable to even consider the idea of taking care of themselves. Most died soon after their mate, if not out of heartbreak then by their own hand.
"When individuals in hiding are on the move, you will find that said travels are held in the highest of secrecy, as to not endanger them any further."
And didn't Granger just eat that up. "That sounds so much better! I've always thought that Trelawny's methods were quite unstructured in their applications-"
"Wait, when I asked if you knew he was the one, you talked about his offering. If you already knew you loved him, wouldn't that not matter?"
Andrew put a hand on his shoulder, and Draco clenched his eyes shut, as if it would prevent him from hearing what was about to be shared.
Draco spun on his heel. Potter was covering his ears with a grimace, but hadn't fallen to the ground like the others. Draco ran for him, grabbing a forearm with an unrelinquishing grip and took off. Either Potter would follow or risk his arm getting ripped from its socket.
Potter had been the most recent addition to his headache. Severus was long past the point of wanting to hex Albus, but the last thing he needed right now was to try and wrangle a
He found Cassie outside of the small villa, laying stones and twigs in a Xylomancy formation that he didn't recognize, and therefore couldn't tell you what it was that she was trying to predict. Draco had long given up on that form of Divination, it wasn't his strong suit and made him more frustrated than anything else, even after he had done it correctly and gotten a prediction in response.
"What, did you honestly think I was going to let you die back there? Have some faith, I may be Slytherin-"
He complied, pulling the front of his robes over his nose and pinching his nostrils closed. Andrew removed the lid of the canister, and despite his precautions Draco was hit with the pungent, rotten smell.
"Of course not," he sniffed, turning his head away from her, nose high in the air. Bloody Gryffindors and their desire to confront people about things. Was it really that hard to be passive aggressive like normal people?
Except they weren't even just friends. They just, were. Harry had tried to hex him, for Pete's sake. Draco had thought that Harry hated him, had tried telling Harry that he had changed. And he'd been too stupid to realize that it was himself who hadn't changed, instead caught up in trying to maintain their stupid rivalry, because at least then Malfoy had talked to him!
Draco nodded, smiling back, avoiding Cassie's eyes burning into the back of his head. He could already hear her voice and what she wanted to say to him:
The common room, as it turned out, could transform into a makeshift classroom. Four tables lined the bookshelf/fireplace wall with three chairs at each. An extra chair sat awkwardly in front of the table closest to the dorms. Draco dragged it behind the table before climbing over to the chair squished against the wall. The corner spot helped release some of the tightness in his chest that had been building all morning.
The thirteen were sat in the astronomy tower of St. Achelous' like lambs waiting to be sent to slaughter. It wasn't so much nervous energy that filled the moonlit room, rather a resigned dread at what was to come.
"My daughter. Take care of her, Lucius, she can't just rot away in your makeshift dungeon and starve. If you wish for me to look out for Draco, I ask you do the same for Cassiopeia."
"They were going to hurt me. Kill me, maim me, and you of all people should understand," Draco forced out to the frozen boy, "They've been killing us for centuries, skinning us for our scales and making us drown in our own blood. You think I enjoy it? Enjoy this? It's not a choice, none of it was ever a choice! Don't you get it?"
Cassie shifted in her sleep, and he turned in his seat as she huffed and flexed her shoulders before returning to her state of rest. She had decided to 'lay down for a bit' a little past noon, and had been asleep for five hours since. If there was one thing he did not envy of Nightingales, it was the battle they faced against their nocturnal sleeping habits. Every week he was forced to watch her struggle to get through the day, before eventually getting so exhausted her body would shut itself down under the guise of a 'quick nap.'
"No. Absolutely not, not after what he did. It's siding with the Light that will be taking a calculated risk, or choosing to side with neither, stay our own faction aligned with neither side."
Aegeus nodded in thought, hands pressed together, fingertips pressing in to the cusp of his chin. "Two Nightingales will play a part in the downfall of the Great Evil. The question is, which ones?"
Draco was laying on the floor in Severus' office, struggling to catch his breath and stop himself from laughing hysterically. Alas, anytime his laughter subsided and air finally returned to his lungs, he'd make eye contact with either Cassie or his godfather, and it would start up once more.
And, no matter how much he may have disliked Andrew at first, the darn boy had grown on him. He'd never admit it, but it was the closest he'd felt to having a son of his own. Excluding his ungrateful godson, of course, because the little brat would've been disowned at least twice had he been really his. That aside, if anything happened to either of them,
y'all!!!! all the comments on Nightingale really hitting me in the feels. in other news, my roommate's pizza cutter sucks and I used a butcher knife to slice my pizza 4 dinner ð
Dumbledore raised a hand to lightly rest on Severus' shoulder, and the latter released Cassie with the greatest reluctance. Sensing their departure the labyrinth parted to create an opening. Draco grabbed Cassie's hand before stepping over the threshold, both looking over their shoulders to wave as the wall closed up behind them.
Hexes were being swapped a couple hundred feet to the east of them, and the hedges bent and curled to make a path for them. They stopped a few feet away from Diggory, using a charm to peer through the hedges unseen. He was being overcome by the skrewt and looked worse for wear. As the conflict progressed, it appeared less and less that Diggory would be able to walk away in the end. Cassie gave him a pointed look, and he hummed a few notes, the skrewt easing up enough in the fight for Diggory to get the upper-hand needed to win (and more importantly, walk out of the squabble alive).
Draco crawled towards the blood scent in hopes to find something to tamper his hunger. The room he was in was small and windowless. Had he not been a magical creature, he doubted he would've been able to see a damn thing at all.
them. Draco reminded himself of this fact as the ugly toad berated him for getting up to use the loo without asking her for permission first.
Because he wasn't an idiot, Draco knew that Harry's stuff had been moved into that room while he'd been asleep. Andrew was
When Draco's consciousness reentered the conversation, it had been picked up by Pansy, who had been chattering excitedly with Granger about potential dates to the dance. In the past, he'd probably have asked Pansy to go with him, a politically safe choice. There were friends, and complimented each other well.
Cassiopeia sipped her tea, not taking her eyes off of Severus as she did so. "He doesn't know, and I wasn't planning on telling him. Narcissa already made me to swear not to."
The portkey threw the four of them to tumble onto the muddied grounds. Draco had landed a good five feet from Potter, landing behind a headstone-
Yet all he could focus on was the quick rise and fall of Draco's shoulders, stare into the depths of the colorless eyes. Feeling a surge of Gryffindor courage, he leaned forward to press their foreheads together.
Except... He'd be betraying Harry. It wasn't something he was capable of doing anyways, seeing as it'd go against his very nature... But even if it were a choice he'd be able to freely make, would he? Dare he risk betraying Harry's trust in him by just entertaining the idea?
Andrew barked out a laugh. "Don't stress over that. Tomorrow I'll take you to St. Achelous' where they have hundreds of shelves with the different collected waters you might need for potion-brewing."
. People were talking, their raised voices pounding nails into his skull, and shrinking away from them was fruitless. Hands grabbed his shoulders and he wanted to thrash away--he might've, as he registered his body slamming onto a hard surface--and he was a turtle wrapped in a ghost net. He was dying.
The siren smiled at him, for once his eyes glinting softly, no hint of mischief or disdain. He had somehow moved so his knees were pressing into Harry's thigh, their faces even closer as he leaned in further.
He pressed their bodies as close together as physically possible, chest rumbling in happiness at the pliant putty that Harry turned into at his actions. He grabbed at his robes, Harry trying to push a little space between them as to be able to remove them, and Draco huffed in annoyance. The other boy seemed to find this amusing as he chuckled at the look on Draco's face before pulling the robes off and loosening his own tie. Draco crowded back against him the second Harry finished throwing the tie to the ground.
If Lucius disproved of the hug, there was no visible sign. Ever since the end of Draco's third year, that's how it had been. Narcissa taking a sudden charge over Draco's upbringing and Lucius being put in his place if he attempted to have a say. The first time it occurred had been jarring for Draco, not used to his passive and mild-mannered mother lose all subtlety and begin to announce how things were going to go.
His voice trailed off with a choke, and for the first time in his life, Draco watched as the man struggled to collect himself. McGonagall turned to Cassie with an evaluating look.
He was confused. Was this what they had wanted Draco for? These individuals clearly held some connection to each Champion, but where did he come into play? If this was what they needed him for then who was his replacement? Which one of these four didn't belong?
Now or never. "I know you had something to do with putting my name in the Goblet, and I know you're lying about this whole 'being deathly sick' shtick. Everyone else might buy it, but I'm not stupid."
Andrew had maintained his composure, not looking surprised in the slightest. "No one told him, Draco, he figured it out. Don't worry, he's one of the few advocates for magical creature rights, he's not going to let anyone harm us here."
They were supposed to be studying for Herbology. Andrew and Cassie had gone out, citing they'd be out well past midnight, so Draco had the quarters to himself. Himself and all his spinning thoughts.
Now he had both Andrew and Draco breathing down his neck to run after her. It was all too familiar to him, their fierce love for someone stuck in an impossible situation.
"Harry, you can't be serious!" Hermione looked ready to wack him upside the head with the book she was holding.
"You're not gonna die, you're gonna be okay," Harry tried to reassure his panicking boyfriend, to no avail. Hands raised in surrender he tried to get close to Draco once more, when someone fisted the back of his shirt to yank him away.
She didn't protest, getting up and brushing off her robes of any lingering crumbs, striding out the door and down the staircase after her father. They certainly had the same innate flair for the dramatic.
Cassie's posture straightened, eyes sharpening like a hawk. "If you call me 'child' one more time, you will find yourself unable to use your tongue for the remainder of your pitiful life."
Cassie smiled, soft and maudlin. "He gave me ocean jasper. It represents bringing love into your life, but also empathy and responsibility. He told me that he admired my strength, but even more so that I trusted him with my vulnerabilities. He hoped to bring out those qualities in him, to see the best of himself reflected within me."
It had been three days since the Second Task, and everyone sat in the Hall seemed groggy this Monday morning, with the exception of Hermione of course. Leave it to her to be excited for a full day of classes.
When he got there, Andrew and Corey had Draco on his knees, pinning him to the ground by his shoulders. Another siren was holding down his legs, while another was putting a physical distance between him and Dumbledore.
"Draco isn't?" Corey sat dumbfounded, and he could see the exact moment it clicked. "Oh. That makes a lot more sense, actually."
Snape closed his eyes, stray tears trailing down to the ground. "More than anything, I knew that the day she found love was the day where her life was no longer in my hands. A selfish part of me wished she would never, but I'd be cruel to deprive the earth of the happiness that he brings her. I'd go mad knowing I was in the way of her feeling the purest, most selfless feeling in the world. Yet, I find myself wishing that I had, hid her away from the pain that love brings. Even if it had made her hate me with every fiber in her being, at least she would be safe."
Weasley paled, failing to catch on to the obvious sarcasm. What Granger saw in those fools, Draco would never know. She was far too intelligent for their likes, not that he'd ever say it aloud to her face.
"Sir?" At this point, Draco wasn't entirely sure that Snape was talking to him in particular, or just venting to the world.
He continued to stare blankly at her. Quite honestly, he expected her to try and smack him for his ignorance.
Draco couldn't withhold from flipping to his other side, ignoring the bile that burned his esophagus. "You think this is Harry's fault? Is that why he's been acting like he gutted me like a fish this whole damn time?"
Draco tossed and turned, his nightshirt rubbing his skin like it was made of burlap. It clung to his sweat-soaked body no matter how many times he tried to separate himself from the offending clothing to the point where he got fed up and disrobed and threw it to the floor. If only the fireplace was nearer; it would've been a much more fitting destination for the retched thing.
Had he been in any other setting, he might be mortified at their childish behavior. Instead, it was something he had come to depend upon, as steadfast as gravity or Her love. He didn't have to worry about appearances or a reputation or anything of the like here. He could be anyone he wanted to be. Most importantly, himself.
Cass relented, but the smile stayed on her face. "It's not like I have much else to work with, with that hollow head of yours."
Dumbledore smirked, and Harry wanted to punch him, but knew that Andrew would be first in line followed by everyone else in the room.
And, ugh, Draco hadn't even thought that far ahead. They most certainly would be, and now Draco added that to his pile of things to mope about.
There wasn't a doubt about that. He had been to the ocean many times before, but not since his fourteenth birthday. Now, as he stood barefooted in the shallows, he could feel Her love. The protection that She would always provide for her children, a promise no one else but Her could keep. The wizarding world would be no match against Her wrath, for no wizard in existence could be more powerful that a formidable force of nature. In that way, She was much like magic itself. A living energy that could not be created nor destroyed, forever existing, as true as the sun and stars above them.
She turned to him to explain: "Cassie has this beautiful dark red-orange scale on her right shoulder, it almost looks like an ember at the base of a campfire. And Andrew's scales are just gorgeous in general--although all Hellfires seem to have that striking coloring that just totally enwraps your attention--but his mating scale is this sudden patch of black... Not pitch-black either, but the black of the night sky, and-
"He's evil, Hermione, just like his family. He was in Dumbledore's office last night with Snape and his cousin and someone else whose name I didn't recognize, and when I followed them they didn't go back to the Slytherin dorms! He has his own quarters that aren't even attached to the dorms-"
Lucius swallowed audibly. "I haven't been in contact with him for some time now, my Lord. At his age it is not uncommon for sirens to already be mated."
Ron stopped scanning to turn to him in concern. "Is this some Muggle thing? Same-sex attraction isn't unnatural if that's your question, it's just not some people's cup of tea. Heck, I have a great uncle that's gay, don't see him too often but he's alright-"
"Did the Ministry... Do they suspect who did it?" she asked, and still Draco didn't look away from her. She was being strong enough for the two of them, he could feel it.
He felt Draco's eyelashes flutter as they opened after a period of being closed. It tickled even more than the tiny exhales that sent the hairs on the back of his neck straight up.
She looked to Severus, some unreadable expression on her face that only the professor understood. "Will the Ministry be aware of our involvement in the Task? The champions? Does Dumbledore expect him to stick his neck out for an IOU?"
One thing was still unclear. "If the problem has to do with Harry's magical core, then why is Cassie miserable too?"
He was interrupted by Margo reaching over to tap at the tabletop to get his attention. "You have a visitor marching this way."
Lunch was a much desired break. Draco didn't even care at the fuss he was sure to cause. He was desperate to stretch out his legs--as he hadn't yet a chance to stretch out his tail--and felt a newfound confidence at the attention he would bring. This year he didn't have to hide what he was. It didn't matter what the others thought or said about him, because this time Draco was different.
"You're lucky the merpeople claimed to have been the ones to free Gabrielle when they saw no one was coming to rescue her, but that meant there was no viable explanation to give him regarding the grindylow! Dumbledore had to lie on the spot to the Ministry judges to throw them off your scent! After all I've done for you, this is how you repay me? By not only endangering yourself, but your friends, my daughter?"
He could have easily continued, but Cassie's stern kick to his shin shut him up. "If someone finds out, hex them and find me. You can. If a potion explodes, Snape already knows. If you're in a different class and something goes to absolute shit, which is unlikely, Pomfrey would have to be very specific in her spell work to find out you're a siren. It wouldn't happen on accident, she'd have to be purposefully looking. Which, she won't, because no one at that damned school has any reason to believe you're anything but a pure-blooded wizard."
His lungs struggled to get air. His feet were cemented down, and he was trembling, his joints protesting at the harsh movements. How had he been so blind? How had this happened? This was Malfoy they were talking about! He couldn't, he wouldn't-
to his left as Andrew added the last potion ingredient. Draco could already taste the bitter concoction sticking to the sides of his throat. How dissonant it would make him feel once it started to take effect in his system.
Mad-Eye Moody made him uneasy. It went beyond his physical appearance, there was something about the energy he gave off that felt dark in a way Draco had never encountered before. And that was coming from the child of a known Death Eater.
They dove under the surface a good fifty feet, in case there were any birds trying to catch a glimpse of where the wards for the Sirenum scopuli islands started. The islands' location now changed every three days, moving to a new corner of the world that had been decided only moments before the move, and there were patrols around the borderline 24/7. Death Eaters still managed to find them every few weeks, and the patrols were tasked with removing the threat before more of the sea rats could flock to them.
The magic floating about shifted in the slightest, like a mouse leaving its tracks on a fresh blanket of snow. Someone was coming.
She held her hand out towards him, pinky outstretched, and he mimicked her. Then she wrapped her pinky around his, and he bent his to mirror hers.
Draco was now slightly more awake. Key word being: slightly. He blinked a few times to clear the fogginess from his vision, unveiling the sight of two stunned Triwizard judges.
He swallowed, throat burning. He searched the floor desperately with his hands, but it was completely dry, even the air lacked humidity.
Harry would have otherwise struggled with this conversation, had he not spent the entire summer discussing this very topic with both Padfoot and Moony. However, he had preemptively decided to keep quiet should it come up on the train, as he loathed getting into it with Hermione. She was brilliant, mind you, but had a way of making you feel like you knew absolutely nothing at all.
Andrew hopped down from where he'd been lounging on the pool ledge to grab a rose-colored potion. He knelt down behind Draco, using a clean scrap of gauze to apply it to the established scales on the back of his neck. While the anti-itch potion was clear in color and smelled strongly of winterbloom and chamomile, the conditioner for his scales smelled like freshwater algae and came with a cool burning sensation.
Blaise looked at him expectantly, and Draco swallowed a lump in his throat. Worse case scenario, he just said 'no.' There were worst things, like embarrassing himself in front of the entire school, or in front of
unleash your vile insecurities onto those drastically younger than yourself. You call us your students? Then take a hint from all the other professors in this godforsaken castle, and learn to stop acting like a petulant child with the emotional maturity of a toadstool. You want our respect, really? Then behave better than the
He looked at the other boy, feigning an air of nonchalance as he kept his face composed. It was his only choice, with twelve sirens' immediate attention falling on him. Corey was right there, too. Draco couldn't risk sabotaging that.
Arms wrapped around his shoulders from behind. He watched in the mirror as Cass rested a chin over his shoulder, one of her hands drawing his down from his face to over his heart, hers resting on top of his.
Snape nodded sagely, bringing his mug back up to his mouth and taking a slow slip, as though contemplating everything in life that had led to him being afflicted by the
Ron elbowed his side, and he was broken from his trance. Hermione was trembling like a leaf as she cried, Ginny shushing her and wrapping an arm around her in comfort. She had been his friend. He hadn't even gotten the same honor.
"No. No." Was his face getting even redder? He might have to give the tomatoes a run for their money. "Him and Cassie..."
When he awoke much later in the day, he was no longer on the floor, but in his own bed. There was a plate of food and a cup of tea on his nightstand--still warm, likely charmed to do so--and a piece of parchment atop a few of his school books. As he scarfed down the much needed meal, the parchment revealed itself to be his list of assignments to complete for the day.
As the pain drained from his head he was able to glance over his shoulder and observe as Cassie gathered another handle of water to pour over him. His nose made a loud crunching noise as it set back into place. Now healed, Draco was able to wrinkle said nose in distaste at the gross sound of it fixing itself.
He almost wanted to laugh at Snape's theatrics, barely reigning it in as the Ministry official analyzed them both. The potions professor rested the mug on the edge of his knee, looking towards the ceiling in defeat.
She looked quite hesitant to interact with him. Bloody hell, she probably thought he was an irredeemable asshole.
The worst part was that it wasn't painful in the slightest. He'd gotten used to the pains, whether they be dull aches or sharp stabs, they were manageable. The itching?
He turned to look at her, but she'd closed her eyes, slouched against him where their bodies were pressed together. If this was going feral, just like falling asleep, then how bad could it really be?
Cassie hummed to draw Draco's attention towards her. "Now, now, Draco, that's not how we treat our friends. Come here, let's get you a calming draught, hm?"
Movement out of the corner of his eye revealed Andrew padding their way, and he came to sit among them. Cassie sought comfort in Andrew's side in the blink of the eye, the two curling around each other as though they could shield each other from the horrors of the world.
The motion was watched by a glaring Cassie that seemed ready to strike the vial out of his grasp in a moment's notice. He wished he was courageous enough to smash it onto the ground and stomp on the glass shards. If only.
In total, there were five of them: Draco, Cassie, Corey, Jessica, and Andrew. It was his first time ever fully immersed with others just like him; that had an answer for his endless questions and curiosities. He hadn't even known that he was a Nightingale. Hadn't known how that made him any different from any other siren out there. He had come in with only the knowledge that he was a siren, and that his body would soon transform to reflect that.
He couldn't exactly say 'are courting to become lifelong mates, which is irreversible even in death, thus destroying my chances eternally.' That didn't really roll off the tongue, and would raise more questions than it would settle.
"Perhaps she'll be grateful upon us healing her, then. If we bond her to me then she'll have no choice but to swear her loyalty."
Loud growls and splashed waves of water died down as the Nightingale finally stilled where he was held. His charcoal eyes lazily looked around, the effects of the sedative still in effect. They landed on Harry, and in the blink of an eye, they were back to their usual pale grey.
"Andrew, you made it!" Cass exclaimed, and Draco wanted to die. Of course he hadn't been warned of his visit, what good would that have done him? Draco didn't need to mentally prepare himself for his summer crush suddenly appearing in a place he'd least expect, that would be absurd!
His thoughts must've been too loud, as both of the older sirens turned their backs to him. Stripping quickly of his robes, he slid into the pool, his muscles tensing at the freezing temperatures.
They kept on that way for a minute before letting the note fade. Draco's eyelids now drooped with exhaustion, grey eyes still unfocused and distant, his upper body swaying with the threat of giving out at any moment. Harry had to lunge forward to catch him in time so he wouldn't hit his head on the floor, letting out a grunt as Draco's deadweight hit him full-force.
"Ilvermorny has never had a student transfer to Hogwarts, although they do have an exchange program with Beauxbatons. All privately schooled wizarding students can test for credits there, so they have a transcript when applying for advanced education opportunities. Having friends in high places there made obtaining a fabricated transcript way too easy," Cassie had explained to him over the summer.
They swam up until they could see the bow of the Durmstrang ship before turning around. Draco didn't know why he had been so apprehensive about doing this, it was so much better than staying in the pool (even if it was charmed to measure a couple hundred meters in distance, it didn't come with the same excitement and life that the lake did).
The cobra made no noise. It did not occupy the walls like his friends, instead opting for the stone floor, slithering with an eerie grace towards Draco. He was paralyzed, captivated by the creature. It stopped mere centimetres from his feet and the two stared at each other for what felt like hours.Â It was then, when Draco finally let his guard down, blind in the belief that perhaps the cobra was an ally, that it struck. Lunging fangs first towards his face, Draco recoiled with a scream from the anticipated agony that was about to befall him.
' You'd think the Goblet would have better security. Like a blood oath! If anyone can write another person's name and bind them to a contract, especially in this case a minor, and I bet your ass it wasn't his legal guardian that signed him up for this! It should be spelled to bind the person who wrote the name, not the owner of the name itself! What if Potter legally changed his name? Would he still be bound?"
Draco had been staring vacantly out into the Great Hall for all of breakfast. Hermione hadn't come down, likely passed out from exhaustion or still scavenging through the library for answers.
The old man stepped closer, attempting to look down upon her despite her height. "Cassiopeia, do you have a even modicum of respect for your elders?"
"Also, I think we should be friends with Hermione Granger. I quite like her, even if her two best friends are possibly the most empty-headed wizards this side of the sea. The other Slytherins weren't even surprised to see me talking to her! Pansy said something about 'Americans having such loose morals,' and I couldn't even care to try and argue her point."
He found that he could barely look away, the rest of the room drab and pitiful, the crackling fire place and its orange glow no longer the most lively entity in his presence.
Corey released a strained laugh which he then tried to conceal with a cough. He was focused on something in his hands, fiddling with it before he continued.
A blast of sparks went up not long after the Task commenced. It was Delacour, stunned and beginning to be consumed by vines. He hummed a low tune and they released her, and cast a silent levitation charm before sending her on her way, the maze automatically parting and guiding her back to the entrance.
"We need to keep moving," Andrew spoke in a low voice, but it sounded warped to Draco. Like they were underwater.
Draco gasped awake, falling from the bed onto the stone floor. He scrambled to find purchase before someone was grabbing at his shoulders and he had to kick them away. He turned his head and began to violently retch, his breath stolen from him as bile burned his throat. There was shouting, more hands grabbing at him, and Draco vomited.
The thirteen were ushered into the castle before the students could wake up and catch a glimpse. It was Pomfrey, of all people, who greeted them and led them to their new residence.Â Walking past the entrance to the Slytherin common room, they came to the same portrait of a kraken that marked the entrance to Draco's private quarters from last year. Pomfrey taped thrice on its head, and it swung inward to reveal a room quite transformed from the one he remembered.
Snape tucked a kiss onto the top of her head, stopping them both. Hermione had to strain her ears to hear their conversation.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, looking back at the teachers table before speaking. If he noticed Snape's absence, he didn't look twice.
Draco ended up missing the first four days of classes. Not that he minded too much, with Cassie doing all the assigned work he had missed on top of making him review guides of the topics for him to catch up.
Draco blinked, piercing gray eyes staring straight into his soul. The bond thrummed with a warm energy--content, safe--as his boyfriend regained his sense of composure to take in his surroundings.
He was leveled with a glare that rivaled his mother's. "What we do know is that it keeps him out of your head, thereby keeping you safe from his influence. You can counter the drowsiness from a Pepper-Up while I work on reducing the side-effects, okay?"
"This is not about you, Potter. Sit. Down." Snape waved a hand, conjuring the nearest chair to slide over, running into the back of Potter's legs so he'd topple back and be forced to take a seat.
His body was trying to fight off an infection. His connection to Cassie left her vulnerable to the same ailment as their magical cores were so interdependent. His magical core was now infused to Harry's, but Harry's core had been compromised.
She was silent, save for an undercurrent of sadness surrounding him, letting him know that She heard him. That She could feel his sorrow, his fear. She made no move to try and comfort him otherwise, no declaration of love or promise that it was all going to be okay.
"As you already know, sirens are more respected than half-giants among magical creatures. Not even veela are a match to your kind."
Cassie took the last bite of her pie, still chewing as she spoke. "Dray, Corey really isn't that hung up, and he's told you this himself. I don't understand why you're even here. Go find Potter and snog in an empty classroom or something."
The French doors opened as he sat down in the seat next to his mother. She had already poured his cup and added his preferred amount of cream and sugar, and he murmured his thanks as his eyes trailed over to their guest.
And both Dumbledore and all the other professors were none the wiser to the true extent of Cassie's knowledge, as well as the vast capability of her magic. It could pose a challenge for Draco to continue to be a straight-O student while also hiding his increased magical abilities. As his siren heritage had manifested, the sudden ease with which he could do wandless magic was unbelievable.
She grinned, stepping into the fountain and dragging him in by the wrist. "You're saying that, next time, I should just leave you to be threatened by a fucking Weasley? A wizard?"
Cassie tilted her head at him, as though the answer was obvious. "You did vanish for quite a few days there, princess. He probably thinks you made a pact with the Devil and you're out for his blood. I've only been here less than a week, and him and his friends are definitely the paranoid type. Like, not all people have it out for you. Maybe you're just annoying and way too self-centered."
Draco turned to Cass as unease rumbled in his chest. "How did she get stunned? Nothing in the maze is capable of anything like that except for us."
She shrugged, as if this were a fact of life to just be accepted. "A song cannot be unsung. However, if it bugs you this much, I can counteract it by the end of the tournament."
Cassie seemed more invested in her pie than she did in his words. Andrew had not once paused to look up from his writing.
Cassie's hair was drenched from the shower spray. He watched the dark tendrils cling to her face in disordered swirls as she talked to Andrew. Well, less talk and more commanding. Andrew called it her 'delegating' voice. Normally, it'd made him smile.
He let Corey link their fingers together and closed his eyes. Then he wouldn't have to look at him any different than before.
Draco started trembling from where he was pressed against Harry, but it was impossible to tell if it was out of fear or something else since he couldn't see Draco's face from where it was pressed into the crook of his shoulder. The water buzzed with anticipation--despite there being not even a ripple on the lake's surface--and Harry realized that this was how the sirens communicated with Her; he had inherited the ability to understand Her from the piece of Draco's magic that now lived within him.
thank y'all for being so patient and kind!! it's been forever since the last update, and believe me when I say I've been wanting to write and update this whole time!!! sadly i pulled a stupid and signed up for a fast-track language course in a language I knew nothing about and now I am suffering the consequences :))
Diggory came and released Chang from her bindings, tapping his watch and looking pointedly in Potter's direction before taking off. Potter still hovered around, looking torn up about having to leave the tiny Delacour behind even as the merperson hissed that he 'could only save one.'
No one questioned their leave of absence, and for once Draco didn't mind the pity-filled glances some of his housemates directed in his direction. He couldn't think of any other excuse for this once-in-a-lifetime sort of experience.
Instead, there was just a collective fear of the older siren. Wordlessly shared between students. And how boring was that?
Cassie applied more salve onto Margot's arm before wrapping it with seaweed. Looking at the burn, Draco could still feel the heat of the flame that had sprouted from Umbridge's wand. Could still hear the screams of agony that followed.
The door creaked open, the high-pitched whine drawing the room's attention. It was one of St. Achelous' professors, but Draco couldn't remember their name. Perhaps she was the Potions Master?
"You know," Corey said, "It's a shame, really. How at Hogwarts, you'll be concealed by polyjuice potion."
Moody seemed barely restrained from stomping out of the room like a petulant child, if his huff of disbelief were anything to go by. The door slammed shut behind him, and Dumbledore switched the focus of the room.
When Harry laid eyes on Malfoy, he stumbled forward, stomping onto Parvati's foot. He was grateful, even as she kicked his shin, that everyone else had joined in on the dancing and that all eyes were no longer on them.
Cassie entertained him, biting back a growl. "Sirens and goblins don't get along. You should've paid better attention to not-Moody's lecture in DADA fourth year."
Draco inched closer, looking at the chain attaching the mini Fleur to the statue. Taking a breath, he focused on increasing the pressure of the water surrounding it, until it broke apart. The girl began to float up towards the surface, and Potter (once more utterly confused) made quick work of grabbing Weasley and going up towards the surface. Draco followed the girl long enough to ensure she breached the surface, before diving back down to the village.
Andrew walked out of his respective room, holding a steel container in his hands. "Draco, how was the library?"
of Blaise Zabini. The world had not come to this. This was all ridiculous. Maybe he really was hallucinating, maybe this was all a farce. Maybe he was just caught in some weird potion-induced dream, and he'd wake up in the Hospital Wing and everything would go back to making sense. He did
Draco had fallen a few steps behind Cassie from getting distracted at the sights around him. Not that either of them were in much of a hurry to get anywhere. Cass must have noticed, as she stopped, her slate grey toga ruffled by the soft winds. Her dark hair tousled around, some strands wrapping around her face as she turned to look at Draco. The sun here had changed her complexion, the once pale skin now a light olive, her near black hair sun-bleached to a golden brown.
Cassie didn't raise her hand this time, and Draco tried his best to not tense up in his seat. No other student provided an answer. Moody did not seem to care too much, ready to answer his own question.
The guilt swirling in his gut told him that Ron had a point. He hadn't been the greatest friend lately, but he couldn't help it! The only times he got to see Draco were outside of class, as the sirens didn't share their classes with any of the other houses. Sometimes they didn't even attend shared meals, and took them in their common room at random, Harry couldn't find any consistency to their schedules.
Despite watching his memories over and over, the Aurors couldn't ask enough questions. It took Snape of all people to get them to finally back off, escorting Harry down to the Hospital Wing.
Her sobbing resumed. Harry felt faint. If he hadn't been so hung up on accusing Draco of whatever he'd been so hellbent on accusing him with, he could've gone with Hermione to study with him. Maybe they would've been friends. Maybe, maybe instead of Zabini, Harry could've gone with him to the dance, or at least been friendly enough to ask him to dance? Maybe they could have been more, than just friends.
Someone tucked their arm into his elbow, guiding him out of the Great Hall with gentle steps. His chest rattled as he sucked in air, and Hermione helped lower him to the ground, sitting beside him as he cried.
Andrew must've read something on his face, and stopped Draco from forcibly waking his cousin up while he was still pondering it.
"Good, good. We'll have to move some things around, we can't risk you getting involved with him. Something's coming, Dray, something dark. Given Potter's track record, he'll act as a beacon for that darkness, it'll just put us all at risk."
"I really tried, Andy, I really did. But no matter how much Narcissa asks of me, I couldn't get him to feel that way for me."
Hermione beamed at the opportunity to share her knowledge. "Nightingales are the only siren that form hunting pairs, as their magical core is fairly unregulated in daylight. When solidary, their magic seeks out stabilization, and witches or wizards with a powerful magical core can send the siren's magic into further unbalance."
Cassie kicked his shoulder to roll the corpse onto his back, before looking back at Draco over her shoulder. "They didn't have a chance to alert their friends, and have no clue on Potter's whereabouts. So, unless Padfoot and crew royally screwed up, we're in the clear."
Cassie moved her hand from his shoulder to his hair, running her fingers through it. Here come the waterworks...
Andrew didn't answer right away. Draco forced his eyes open, the tears welling in them not daring to fall. He willed them down, he would breakdown about this in private, not now. Not in front of Dumbledore and Snape and all the portraits that were asleep but could very likely be eavesdropping anyways.
Harry scanned the room, looking up at the teachers' table to find everyone present except for Snape and Dumbledore. His attention was quickly drawn back to his table when George stated, matter-of-factly:
Andrew was 'jumping leagues,' a skill where he would swim straight at an obstacle--whether that be a rock or a cluster of weeds--and vanish right before colliding with it, appearing again a good distance away that he logically couldn't have swam to based off of trajectories. It was a skill more advanced than portal creation, where water would swirl into a physical portal that could transport you into any body of water anywhere, as it involved illusive evasion that required blind trust in Her. With a portal, you had a destination in mind. With league jumping, you had to trust Her to prevent any collisions and also trust she would transport you safely out of harm's reach.
Parvati made a comment about finding Padma and disappeared before he could really process what she was saying. His eyes flew back to Malfoy--they honestly hadn't left the Slytherin in the first place--and tried to process the sight before him.
There had been debate over whether or not the prophecy had turned him into a martyr. This was all the confirmation he needed.
"She will." Snape didn't seem to be having any of this. "Because if you die, then so does she. Even if she doesn't, there is no forgiveness to be had if I let anything like that happen to you. Don't you understand? Everything I do is for her, so she can live! She loves you, and if you feel the same you won't risk her life so carelessly."
But if this war was going to kill him, he wasn't going down without putting up a goddamn fight. If he couldn't walk out of this blaze alive then
Draco opened his eyes to darkness. His head was pounding, his entire body aching from where he'd fallen asleep on the stone cold floor. He sat up, his joints announcing their discontent at the action, and let his eyes adjust to the light.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the unexpected audience that greeted them inside and barely managed to restrain himself. He allowed Cassie to manhandle him into a chair, with her sitting atop one of the arms like a crow perched on a castle spire. She leveled her gaze at Barty Crouch Sr. and Ludo Bagman.
"It means that if I were to break your promise, that you'd have the right to cut off my finger. It means it's a promise of the highest regard. So, pinky promise."
This is what would happen to him. Perhaps during the war, or perhaps later on in his life. He would be reduced to nothing but inconsolable grief as half his soul parted from him, his exposed heart bleeding from underneath the heel which crushed it. All it would take is a matter of measly minutes. It was that easy.
McGonagall finished her tirade, demanding all of them (even Harry) immediately go to the headmaster's office, when Cassie raised her chin in Moody's direction.
"I'm sorry." Andrew sounded pissed. "But wizardkind isn't capable of anything when it comes to sirens except for making us drown in our own blood and fear for our lives. If this is really about Potter's stupid magical core, then we'd've been better off going straight to the Oracles for help."
He could understand now, why the Ministry had been so adamant on wiping out his kind. Had he been a regular wizard, not an ounce of creature blood in him, he too would be terrified at the power sirens held. He hadn't even mastered his Song yet, still had a ways to go in his development.
He wouldn't even have to drink the damn potion if Andrew hadn't corrupted Hermione with his agenda, who in turn had went and badgered Harry until he was on the same page. He would've been able to succeed in refusing the prescribed regimen if he didn't have two incessant Gryffindors breathing down his neck until he complied.
She was weird, too. Old enough to be in fifth year, but her timetable was incoherent. He'd heard from some Ravenclaws that she had started out in fourth year classes, but had since bounced around and had sat-in on sixth and seventh year ones, but on days where Malfoy attended classes she'd be inseparable from him. She acted like she was badly educated in magic, but Hermione had raved about how intelligent she was after one of their many study sessions. She was connected in this all, somehow...
He clapped his hands, standing up from the forest floor. "Great news! It's scheduled to rain tomorrow. Now, can we please go back to the castle? I hate being out here past sundown."
He would not be pestering Harry with these insecurities. He already had enough times before their mating, and now Draco had to refrain from anything that'd push Harry away faster than he could leave on his own. Did that even make sense? Draco felt like he was making sense.
Andrew disappeared at some point, and returned much later with Cassie in tow, both of them smelling crisp of salt and brine. Cassie had come to kneel in front of him, gently removing the empty mug from his hands before speaking to him.
"Anything interesting?" he asked, spotting the breakfast spread on the coffee table and helping himself.
Corey had gone over to Snape's desk, but the professor himself was nowhere to be seen. If they had been waiting up on Draco, perhaps the man had made a run for it, given the opportunity to flee.
Harry did not see Draco again that day until he was leaving dinner. Hermione had at least shown up, but had been occupied by Ron asking a million questions about his Potions essay. Thankfully, he was able to get over his slight irritation quite quickly, it wouldn't be fair to Ron after the conversation they'd had earlier about Harry dedicating all his time to Draco.
She ruffled Draco's hair, and he took a deep breath in. He blinked, and his eyes returned to normal, the hostility draining from his face. Draco looked around, first in confusion, and then in mortification as he realized both the position he was in and that their audience included his godfather of all people.
Now, he supposed, he was more than capable to take her out himself. He was 15 now, and a fully mature siren at that. He had perfected the use of his Song during his time on the Islands, meaning he no longer needed help from others in fighting his battles.
Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Vince, and Hermione Granger sat with him around a library table, discussing the Potions practical coming up and the ridiculously lengthy essay they had to complete for History of Magic.
He had noticed that most of those that resided underneath scopuli were Moonbeams and Tomb sirens, but hadn't paid too much mind to it. In all honesty, the idea of sirens living separated by species was an idea novel to him. But here, pods lived in permanent settlements. Traveling pods were more likely to be diverse with their safety relying on numbers.
Snape had never been the sentimental type. Draco's brain malfunctioned as he tried to think of an appropriate response.
"Cassie?" he asked once more, not even trying to hide the tremble in his voice. Why did she have that look?
hell. So many questions were spinning around in his head, accompanied by a silence so loud it was painful.
Harry gave him a look of sympathy. No potion had been able to ease his suffering and Severus was beginning to look mildly concerned as a result. It wasn't often that the Potions Master was left stumped. Draco was also quite certain that Harry felt a tinge of guilt every time he looked at him and hadn't yet determined the best way to stamp that out.
He turned to Andrew for confirmation, who stared blankly in response. A yes, then. He pointed at the kook. "And him knowing about our suspicions about Moody?"
on the Hellfire siren before him. His warm almond-shaped eyes were always kind and inviting, and when Draco got caught staring by them he barely managed to not completely malfunction and disintegrate on the spot.
Cassie looked up at Draco like she hadn't expected that reaction out of him. Her mouth stuffed comically full, he had to wait for her to finish chewing for a solid twenty seconds before she was able to speak again.
Severus seemed equally displeased. "He said that, should this be a regular excuse from class, that he wishes to have a meeting with us and Professor Dumbledore."
Cassie grasped Andrew's wrist, tugging him even closer to her side. "With everything that the Oracles have been predicting and that Moonbeam in France, Andrew's family put pressure on him to begin courting someone to be his mate." She ducked her head, hiding a grin.
Corey shoved his shoulder into Draco's. He could nudge him all he wanted. Draco would not relent in his stubbornness.
"Correct. Seeing as Draco is quickly spiraling I wouldn't be surprised if he was out of it enough to react to being marked with instinct."
Dumbledore stood from his seat. "Alastor, I will have to insist upon your immediate suspension until after Winter Break. Attempting to hex not one, but two students, is quite the egregious offense ever committed by a Hogwarts professor. This punishment, in my opinion, is a tad too forgiving. But, as a longtime friend, I insist upon giving you the benefit of the doubt and a second chance. Take this sabbatical as a time for most needed reflection. You are dismissed."
Draco shuddered at the recollection of the tale. At moments like these, he did not wish to think too much about his future, but it was all inevitable. It wasn't like he hadn't brought it up with Cassie a few times over the summer. Talks about faking his death in the British wizarding world and going off to live with a pod in America. It was easier to be in hiding there, with the vast lands and the Magical Congress' lax laws regarding magical creatures. While sirens weren't immune in the States, the Native wizarding community had been strong opponents to their persecution and had stayed true to their word of protecting them.
The cruel she-devil had then blockaded their access to any living water as to prevent Her from washing the wounds away. She had known to wait long enough for the burns to settle, sink deep into the flesh as to ensure a scar would be left in its wake. There were some things that not even She could reverse. It was why there had been no hope for his mother's malady, no reversing the damage done to her siren form.
Snape did his best to school his expression, waited for the other father in the room to say the words first.
Harry tensed for a whole millisecond, barely noticeable if you weren't looking for it, his chest constricting as his breathing ceased until Harry caught himself and tried to brush off the reaction.
Cassie sat in the chair next to him, followed by Andrew next to her, and Corey on the end. The room was silent. No nervousness. No excitement. Simply silent.
thanks for sticking with the story, updates may be a bit erratic with fall semester starting and my professors deciding that I do not need sleep nor a semblance of free time.
"You need to be bonded, before the Dark Lord comes for you, and for fuck's sake, Draco!" Andrew gripped his hair like he was on the verge of pulling it out, "You're going feral! If Harry hadn't been back there in the Hall, what do you think Dumbledore would've done? Do you really think he's so tolerant as to've let you keep on like that? We're only pawns to him, and a feral siren is beyond anyone's control! We mean nothing to him!"
Sturdy enough for the two of them, Draco's balance did not even falter. Sometimes he forgot how much lithe muscle his boyfriend was made out of. But, that was a thought to be examined at a later time.
He hadn't been able to tell last night, but... It was much, much longer than he expected. Draco didn't even reach six feet tall in his human form, but that was the length of his tail by itself. It made sense when you considered how deep down sirens had to dive on top of the fact they could swim across oceans within a matter of days (but only if they stopped for breaks, according to Corey).
The fingers kept brushing through his hair, lulling Draco into a state of calm despite the dull throbbing in his sides. Everything had been handled, all he had to do was lay there and heal. Letting the darkness overcome him, he fell into a dreamless sleep.
Draco's face might've drained of all color if he wasn't so pale. "We barely understand the prophecy as is, how could you let them be so reckless?"
Draco tilted his head back, blinking away tears with a stubborn grimace. He wished Cassie were here, if only because she would understand how he was feeling without him having to put words to it. It wasn't that he didn't love Harry. To try and deny that was a lost cause. It was the burden of binding Harry to him, forcing him into an obligation that'd only endanger him further.
Harry must've looked like a deer in headlights to elicit such a laugh out of Draco Malfoy. The laughter quickly turned sour, Draco's eyes flittering towards the nearest exit with a nervous jitter to his movements.
Draco stayed hidden in his room for the first ten minutes of Granger's visit. He could hear the two girls talking through his now closed door, which he now stared at intently. He wasn't building up courage to open it, that would be preposterous. He simply doubted his company would be enjoyed, and he'd rather not sit through an awkward silence.
Was she far away? Why was she far away? She popped into his tunnel vision, placing her hands on his face to force him to look at her.
She grinned that one of the two was finally starting to get it. However, her ecstasy was short-lived.
The truth was that Draco had not been 'cooped up in the villa' all of the time, per say, with the exception being the hours and hours he spent swimming in the sea surrounding the three islands. He had seen the civilizations built underneath, elaborate caves and structures built to accommodate the hundreds of sirens that lived down there. He'd seen the Oracles' cavern underneath the extinct volcano of St. Achelous, full of enormous, shining crystals that were illuminated by the brilliant skies that peered through the volcano's crater.
He shouldn't push it, he kept reminding himself, even as he failed to shake her words from his head. Yet nothing could hold his tongue back as she moved to take the first step forward.
He shook his head vehemently, even if he knew internally that this was going to be a losing battle. And... It would be an interesting perspective on the competition.
Andrew gave him one of those stupidly cheery smiles. "I'm glad, I'm sure you two will have a lot of fun. Now, you may want to cover your nose for this next bit."
! No wonder they've never been involved with this damned Tournament, they see it for what it is-" Her tirade ended on a choked sob, and she buried her face into the crook of Draco's neck.
Harry wanted to die of embarrassment. He'd had to go and make a fool of himself in front of the whole group of sirens in the Great Hall, had been dumb enough to assume that Draco had... What? Waited for him? They weren't even friends!
And that was the end of that. Cassie was done with her little show, resuming her glaring contest, and Draco leaned against her side. They'd have to levitate him back down to his quarters. As the voices in the room lulled in volume, assurances made that Draco would not be involved in any way and that they were sorry for even thinking it was 'permissible to entertain the idea' in the first place...
Lucius then rushed to Severus, snatching both hands into a death grip. "He must, Severus, please. You must warn Draco. He has followers in the school, has told them to, to figure out if he has a mate. Please, help me."
Gulping, he made of point of avoiding Draco's burning gaze, focusing on Andrew (no matter how scary he was, it was easier than looking Draco in the eye as he threw Cassie under the bus).
As they grew closer to Gringotts, Draco snarled. While he was needed for the mission, he still felt his blood boil at the faint scent of goblins.
Blaise, ever the socialite, was quick to strike up a conversation with Cassie. Pansy's interest was also sparked when they heard her obvious American accent, and Draco was grateful for the attention being redirected away from him.
Andrew had run himself out of breath, and Draco tried to understand the flurry of words being thrown at him. "You're talking about Cassie, right?"
Sirens only loved once. When they lost the one they loved many died in their grief, if not by their own hand.
Fallen trees with trunks taller than Draco in diameter had been hollowed out to act as bridges between the three islands. Draco could see one coming up in the distance, a group of young kids chasing each other through one. He wondered what it would have been like for him to grow up here instead, never seeing the world outside of this safe haven. He wondered if news of the impending war was even scarier considering sirens were being targeted by Voldemort, or if they were blind to the threat lurking around the corner.
Potter was a blur running past him with the amassed group of dark wizards hot on his heels. He needed to do something, anything, despite the growing lump in his throat and the searing pain that pushed past the adrenaline rush.
His parents were remnants of Voldemort's wand as a direct result of their murders. Dumbledore had said so. Yet, he had nothing to do with Draco's death. No one did, as it was Draco's illness to blame.
"Snape's been trying to help me improve my occlumency but I can't seem to get it right- Draco, are you alright?"
Draco had been pestering Cassiopeia with his worries for the rest of the day. "Are you certain he doesn't know? What if he was hinting that he suspects us?"
Draco nodded, hoping that the buzzing of his nerves wasn't as evident as he felt they were in that moment.
Draco had heard enough. The decision had been made for him before he had even been conceived. This meeting was a formality; you would be foolish to think otherwise. Come tomorrow, he'd be shipped off to Hogwarts, no matter how he felt. He had no say, and never would.
She turned away from him to look back towards the sky. The smile had left her face, and even at side-glance Draco could tell that he wasn't meant to see the look in her eyes. He'd seen it more than enough times all year, knew it had to do with what they had discussed all those weeks ago in Severus' office.
The Americans dancing, a mesmerizing movement that had drawn a crowd around them. Ron had stood, moving to them as if under a spell, his hold on Harry still not relinquished and forcing him to follow.
care for Potter. There were too many reasons why it could never be. He was a siren, a fugitive, the son of a Death Eater. Potter was the boy-who-freaking-lived.
It was late in the evening. Andrew had long gone to bed, so it was just Draco and Cassie sat in front of the fire. He had tried to convince her to go to sleep as well with no luck, she was determined for him to fall asleep first, no matter how unlikely that was.
"You may understand, one day, the fear that comes with having a child. The fear that you won't be good to them, won't be there to protect them, won't keep them safe from the world."
Severus shook his head. "I'm afraid I can't tell you until we reach our destination, for even I do not know the answer to your questions."
Andrew plopped down next to the professor, smirking at the disgruntled look he received for jostling the older man before turning to Harry.
Both were distracted by Cassie throwing her duvet out of the way to slowly climb out of bed, looking green from the small effort. She
"My money's on Mad-Eye," Cassie mentioned, her interest directed more to the heaping mountain of mashed potatoes occupying her entire plate. It was by some divine miracle that none was occupying anywhere else, with how it threatened to spill over the edges.
This damn castle really was not that accessible to anyone with a disability. He'd have to bring up that particular concern to his father some other time.
He'd decided that the Oracles' cavern was his favorite place in the entirety of the Islands. Although it was extremely unlikely he would ever advance to become an Oracle with his strong dislike for the practice of Divination, none could deny the absolute beauty of their residence.
"Yes, mate, it's okay." Ron resumed scanning, but once he found what he was looking for, he grabbed at the front of Harry's robes so tightly that he barely saved himself from toppling out of his chair.
He set the pieces of parchment down, knowing he would not be able to get any more studying in now. "Oh?"
His eyes fell to Severus' hands. They were clutching his knees, knuckles bone-white as his fingers dug into black robes. Robes being clenched so tightly that Draco was certain the fabric would tear under the pressure, straining and stretching until it could handle the tension no longer.
Draco was torn from unconsciousness by a brilliant light, so bright he felt as though he had been staring into the sun despite his eyelids being clenched shut. He could feel his heartbeat in the relentless throb in his head, worsened by the shouting-
The fire made his eyelids warm and heavy. Closing them was almost painful from the heat yet was nothing but a pleasant sensation. He leaned into it, caressed by the blazing glow and soft crackling of the logs, accented by the occasional turning of the page per Cassie.
He was about to try and calm down Cass but was quickly beat to it. Honestly, he was quite thankful that even in his frail state that Andrew would be the one to comfort her, knowing she'd be inconsolable until she was convinced Andrew would be okay.
In his periphery he watched Andrew kneel down so someone could pour a goblet of water onto his face. Unable to resist, Harry broke his gaze to watch the scratch wounds stitch themselves back together while the blood washed away.
"Draco, don't move!" she yelled back at him. She sounded more irritated than panicked, which allowed him to relax his shoulders and take a deep breath. Although he had improved his Divination thanks to their shared psychic bond, her having confidence in her next actions was much more reliable in predicting the outcome.
Ron tentatively raised his hand, still glancing between the two of them. Hermione stopped mid-monologue to look at the ginger expectantly.
The phrase was novel enough to break him out of his daze, and he looked at her for an explanation. "Pinky swear?"
Draco refused to admit that he saw where his cousin was coming from. There was a logic in siding with the rest of the magical creatures--which was, in fact, what they were still considered by the Ministry--and ensuring better chances for their survival (even if it was only for the duration of this war). Wizardkind didn't like them, that hadn't changed, so what difference did it bloody make?
They followed the Transfiguration professor down to the Quidditch patch, not coming across anyone else in the hallways. Probably in class, he figured.
Andrew was eerily calm as he slipped around the table to stand in front of them. Umbridge had taken a step back in uncertainty, the grip on her wand so tight her hand was shaking.
"I wanted you three to hear it from me, before you read it in the papers tomorrow," the headmaster started, looking down at the letter like it was a dark artifact.
Two hands cupped his face and he shoved them away. Everyone was too close, his clothes were too tight, he couldn't
Umbridge did not come back after the incident. Dumbledore had informed them that the Ministry would 'deal with her' for her actions, but they all knew that meant a slap on the wrist (if that) and transferring her to a different role as though nothing had even happened.
"Was there a moment when you knew... When you knew you loved Andrew?" he said, trying to keep his tone as neutral as possible.
It prompted him to bring one of his hands up to his face for closer inspection. He hadn't noticed until now, but he had changed to the new environment as well. Not unusual, as sirens had to be quick to adapt as they traveled through the oceans. He, too, had gained a significant amount of color, more so than he ever had in his entire life. Who knew all it took was a bit of Mediterranean sun for him to look like he didn't spend all of his years hidden in the shadows?
It sort of scared him how easily the older siren was faring. He didn't even have bags under his eyes or even seem to be having trouble sleeping, although it was entirely possible Professor Snape was supplying him with Dreamless Draught. But, unlike Draco, he didn't need to be harped on to eat a meal, didn't space out on a frequent basis. He had become mechanical.
It wasn't a consideration. Draco was long past weighing his options. He was already in the thick of it, and could only ponder which path his life would go down.
I figured since Draco was learning about the non-magical world in an American setting, it only seemed fair that he would learn the American terminology instead of the English ones
Cassie must've moved him. The cold pool of water lifted some of the fog, the searing pain dulled down to a strong ache. He feel into a fitful sleep, but it was hard for him to tell whether he was sporadically waking up or simply having fever dreams. He could've sworn he could hear Severus talking at one point. He also heard his mother's, too, which convinced him it was a dream. Someone kept screaming. They must be drowning, for the noise was mixed in with harsh gurgles of water. He wished to help them.
"He died weeks before we knew that Voldemort was back," Hermione clarified for him, like he wasn't already considering that tidbit of information.
"Hey, are you alright?" Corey questioned, blinking wearily as he sat up in his sleeping bag. They were in a tent.
Sometimes, it wasn't even Death Eaters they came across. Ministry officials, typically Aurors, trying to recruit them for the 'good fight.' They loved to wax poetry about how they wanted peace now, preached cooperation in order to win the war. While they were spared from death, they left with the clear message that siren-kind wanted nothing to do with the bastards after all they'd done to them.
He had been ready to lie to the Dark Lord, tell him that he couldn't save her from her wounds. He had reached the point where he didn't care if it got him killed, his own survival had become fruitless, the furthest from being the thing he cared most about.
Whatever it meant, Andrew understood, and was ditching Harry within seconds. Not enjoying being left out of the action, he stumbled up to hurry over to them as they moved to exit the hall, but just as he got to the door he was being grabbed by the arm and dragged off to the side.
"Snape, please," he whined, pressing his hands over his ears and clenching his eyes shut as the room came to be too much.
From the neck down they were all scales and sharp fins. If the moon weren't full and directly hitting the water, Harry wouldn't be able to recognize the shape of Draco with how he blended in.
How the hell was he going to make it through the school year if his first day back he could barely focus?
He nodded, not capable of any more words, his throat tightening and holding the air in his lungs captive.
Harry felt like shrinking in on himself, Vernon's words pounding around his head. "Isn't it... not natural?"
Draco's mind then drifted to Andrew, a thought he had to quickly shake away. He was two years older than Draco, and would never ask him out even if Amortentia had been slipped in his morning coffee. No one would be appalled if he went with a bloke, it wasn't unheard of in the Wizarding community, and not anything to be ashamed of. He was the only heir in his family, and in the past would have deterred him from any sort of public announcement to his sexuality. It'd disgrace his family if he displayed intentions to not continue his bloodline.
No, that wasn't fair. Corey could not be blamed for his humility. That was just how he was. Killing everyone with kindness. Draco had only harmed himself in letting it get to this point. He had gone to Corey to forget himself before he was a siren. Tried to shove down that old part of him as a solution to his frustrations. Now, it reared its ugly head.
"You said no one was going to tell him!" Draco was also struggling with volume-control at the moment, but in his defense it was well past hours of when students should be in their beds.
"I didn't just come with you to Hogwarts to help you with your transition. The Triwizard Tournament is a colossal event that only happens once in a blue moon. Behind the curtain there are so many things happening, there's been shifts in magic itself, in the very essence of nature, and She feels it. She knows that something is coming, and She's scared. Whatever is happening, the sirens need to know about it. We need to be prepared. She refuses for our kind to be threatened any longer."
Draco grinned against his neck, arms snaking around his waist. They stood like that for what felt like minutes, hearts racing in tandem as they panted to catch their breaths. Harry had managed to get him to take a step back from the wall before the pressure became unbearable.
In some twisted way, Draco could see how his grandmother's actions could be seen as protection. Sirens have always been prosecuted and brutally killed by the Ministry, and if her secret got out, keeping her safe would've turned impossible. Fueled by fear of not understanding her siren daughter and the need to protect her from the world turned it all into a distorted goal of snuffing out the thing that caused both. Two birds with one stone, and all that.
"Draco," she started, moving towards him as though he were a spooked animal, "do you care for Harry Potter?"
Severus stood with a gloom expression on his face. It was very similar to the one he made when Longbottom botched yet another potion. "Very well. I will deal with the matter. Do not go investigating on your own."
Cassie opened the bathroom door with her side, carefully maneuvering a tray in her hands from bumping into anything. She brought it over and set it on the side of the pool ledge before placing both hands on her hips and looking down at Draco, who laid miserably on the floor surrounded by a pile of dead skin and blood.
If his stomach weren't already empty, he would've been sick. Instead, coughs wracked his body as he dry-heaved while struggling to sit up.
Severus was unaware of any information campaigns to spread the word that they were traitors, but that didn't mean that Voldemort hadn't given any of his followers special instructions to be on the lookout. Severus had yet to even be informed that his daughter had disappeared from their prison, and they had gone great lengths to ensure that it wasn't suspected that Severus had any involvement.
"Nightingales were feared the most by sailors, as they couldn't be spotted at night. They couldn't sleep easy if they knew they had crossed a siren, and even worse, days would go by with no event. Then, when they finally felt safe, Nightingales would enact their revenge, and She would drag them to the very pits of Hell itself."
He wasn't entirely sure he had a concrete answer for that. He could remember the moment just fine, how he'd had a burning desire to destroy anything that threatened his mate.
After term had ended, Mother had taken him to the American state of Washington, a rainy place thick with endless forests. He had known about this trip since the Christmas break, and honestly, had been filled with a looming sense of dread leading up to it.
"Hello new students," the pink lady greeted with the world's most sugary tone, "I'm Miss Dolores Umbridge, the appointed High Inquisitor of Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic. During your stay here I will be overseeing your education, but more importantly, getting to know you all. The Ministry is quite curious about sirens, you see, and I've been tasked with reporting my findings to the Minister himself. Now-"
He mouthed his thanks, getting a wink in return, and popped one into his mouth before treading back into the belly of the beast. The elder Oracle and her were still going at it with full vigor. At least no one had been stabbed in the two minutes of Draco's absence (not that either of them had noticed).
Snape sighed. "Fear. The Dark Lord had plans for his son, Draco, and when Lucius could not offer him, well... He needed to provide an alternative or face certain death."
He had forced her free. Apparated her far, far away and stunned her so she wouldn't try to follow him as he ran away. She should have been safe after that. He should have made her promise to never come near him again.
He was cut off by two clammy hands grabbing his face, a mouth pressing against his. He leaned in, even as he realized the implications of the situation he found himself in. So sue him, if he wasn't going to pass up on a chance to kiss Harry bloody Potter! By Circe, he never could've imagined his luck.
"I don't know why, but I didn't think that we'd have to deal with him as a threat just yet." His throat felt tight, and when he swallowed to dislodge the imaginary knot the sharp pain only got worse. "I know the war's already here, I know that-"
Granger's eyes were wider than saucers, her skin almost as ashen as the Bloody Baron's. She blinked rapidly in succession to reacquaint herself with her surroundings before responding.
The porch door opened, letting in the warm ocean breeze. It was Corey, hair still dripping wet from the water, carrying a crate of potion ingredients for Andrew.
His cheeks burned and he ducked his head, not capable of forming words coherently. Andrew stood and ambled toward them, giving the Headmaster a warning glance. He kept his voice low as he spoke next, although the Hall had seemingly emptied out since it had all started to go down.
Draco didn't fare much better in that aspect. It was a wonder to him that they could sleep like rocks when the sun was up, but burst to the brim with energy once the sky was black.
Severus pulled away from the hug and readjusted Cassie's hood that had slipped back. Draco was never going to grow accustomed to the look of Severus as a doting father, despite it being the most convincing proof that Cassiopeia truly was his daughter. Otherwise, anyone who told him that Severus Snape was indeed a loving parent would get the quickest recommendation to the nearest Mind Healer.
Dumbledore looked furious as Potter made his way towards the front of the hall. Good grief, the theatrics were already too much. How in Merlin's name was he supposed to make it through an entire tournament of this debauchery?
The dream came back to him in pieces, yet also all at once. He reeled back from the sting of it. It hadn't been a dream. It wasn't a dream.
Another twig snapped, and this time Corey snarled in the direction of the sound. As Snape came out of the shadows, the professor failed to conceal the deep roll of his eyes.
But when Corey reached for his hand, Draco didn't pull away. Harry didn't know what he was, would never consider him as a choice if he knew. The world wasn't safe enough for him to be taking risks like that. This was how he needed to play it. A war was brewing on their back door.
She never did go into much detail after her initial explanation of what she had underwent, as she had only told him as she wanted him to understand why she was taking such a 'liberal' approach to his upbringing in turn. Why she had sent him off to be with a pod over the summer instead of teaching him the culture herself. Why she hadn't known how to help with his pain as his first set of gills developed, only stared at him in shock for a moment before doing her best to comfort him.
His own father. The bloody coward only cared about saving his own skin, damn it all if it meant endangering the rest of his family. He'd been distant since Draco had come-of-age, but to go this far? Did Draco mean nothing to him at all?
He let out a deep breath. His hands still trembled as they held the letter. Whatever words were inside, they were bad. Even if they weren't regarding his mother.
Cassie tilted her head in consideration. "Usually the civilizations beneath the Islands are considered the 'residential areas' for sirens. I believe the best comparison for Amphitrite is that it is much like the muggle state of Texas: lawless and wild. Most of those that live on Amphitrite are Sea Devils and Sea Demons, historically it's always been that way."
Cassie's features were more dark. Coffee brown hair that appeared black unless she was in the sunlight. Eyes much the same, the amber brown appearing inky black in all other lights. But she shared his build, and his bone structure, enough so that one would believe they were more closely related.
He got no answer. His attention was drawn back to the water at the air grew metallic. It was impossible to tell who had begun bleeding as they had healed just as fast, but it was obvious Draco was the culprit given from the crimson dripping from his maw; His fangs looked even sharper from the way they glinted in the moonlight.
A younger Oracle that glanced nervously around the circle raised a hand before interjecting, "Actually, we are positively certain this time. Cassiopeia's natural talent for Divination and Draco's aptitude with aquatic alchemy signifies how each are blessed by Her. They've been given the two most powerful tools a siren can possess, and they were born exactly twelve moons apart. We overlooked them the first time around because we were unaware that Narcissa Black was a siren, we had no way of knowing her son was also a siren by relation. They're the only two that are twelve moons apart in the timeline of the prophecy, and both are children of a pair of fraternal twins!"
Draco hoped his dissociating wasn't that obvious to the blind eye. As Dumbledore droned on about new staff, the Triwizard Tournament, Merlin knows what else... He couldn't buy into the excitement. He simply wished for the feast to be over so he could retire to his dorm.
Another voice, off to the side, joined in. "Like I said, it's normal. It means the spines are breaching through his skin. This part's almost over."
He closed it, but held it on his lap instead of setting it aside. "It says that sirens almost never get sick."
That wasn't even considering the press attention that the Tournament brought. Rita Skeeter, in her obnoxiously bright outfits and her invasive disregard for others' privacy or personal space, made Draco consider bribing Cassie to use her Song and get the horrid reporter to have an untimely appointment with the Great Lake. It surely would do everyone else at Hogwarts a big favor.
Severus had many regrets. It had defined much of his life, if it wasn't the source of his misery, then it was a byproduct. His biggest regret had been choosing a life of hatred that led him down the path he currently walked, and how it put his daughter's life in the same line of fire that killed her mother.
Pansy's eyes widened a tad at the informal introduction, a clear indicator that Cass was not of a Noble and Most Ancient House. If only she knew the full story.
As they grew nearer to their destination, both had changed into their robes. It was around this time where Draco began to feel butterflies whirling around in his stomach, his heart picking up its pace.
Cass looked longingly at her mashed potatoes, likely regretting triggering a conversation in the first place. "Well, I'm sure there are plenty of wizards out there that'd rather have him dead, it's not like all the Dark Lord's followers vanished overnight."
Cassie snorted, audible enough for those nearby to startle at the sudden noise. Why was everyone so quiet? Surely-
"I'm sorry my inaction has made you feel so strongly, Severus. But, I assure you I understand the importance of her life and the role she will play in Voldemort's defeat."
Cassie shrugged. "That kind of chaos is too controlled. Practically predictable. Where's the fun in that?"
Draco dried off and threw on the first toga he saw, barely managing to not trip over himself as he made his way to the parlor for evening tea. Cassie and Andrew were already there, curled together on the loveseat like two elderly cats begrudgingly sharing a napping space. It was almost funny how grouchy they both looked, but Draco knew the truth. Both were exhausted and overworked, and running on fumes was beginning to catch up to them. It was the boat that everyone was in; they could only scoop out the building water in pails and dump it overboard so quickly. At this point, some were hoping it would just sink already and seal their fate.
He crossed the small space to kneel down next to her, sitting on his heels as he brushed stray hairs from her face. He breathed out a laugh at the physical proof she was here.
He hated that she knew exactly who he was talking about with very few hints. "He did not drool!" Draco protested.
At this point, Harry wasn't even sure that it was answers. Just the slightest of hints, anything to explain her betrayal.Â Seeing as she was literally Snape's daughter, Harry wasn't sure why they even bothered to excuse her actions. The apple didn't fall far from the tree, and all that...
He wished he could voice his thoughts, yet all Draco could do was hold back sobs, his emotions getting the better of him. A small voice in the back of his head told him it was because like his magic, he was quickly unraveling, a lit fuse getting ready to blow.
He was about ready to bash some logic into that thick skull. "Yes, they pair up on instinct, but it's because it strengthens their vulnerabilities. Did you not pay attention in first-year health at all? They're the only type of siren to abstain from solo or pack hunting, and they're drawn to each other to balance out their weaknesses. Cassie is a seer, and..." He waved his hand at Corey, prompting him to finish the sentence.
Harry rolled his eyes, knowing the two of them were done listening to anything he had to say. He'd show them how wrong they were. Malfoy was a conniving Slytherin that hated his guts, there was no way he'd suddenly be interested in becoming friends with Harry's muggle-born friend, with his whole house not saying a word about it.
"You're insufferable," he said, refusing to face her as her footsteps made their way towards the door. Had there been any witnesses, one could say Severus Snape began to cry as the door closed with the tiniest of clicks. However, the room was empty with the sole exception of one Professor, and he'd tell you he spent the morning alone revising lesson plans.
"Way back when, sirens lived in pods based on their subspecies. The First Siren we're all descended from was a Sounding Tomb siren, native to the oceans around Greece, you know? But pods traveled a bunch, and over time they evolved to better fit their environment. If you didn't notice, the ocean is ginormous. We needed a way to communicate across long distances; turns out the best way is by humming the same frequency as your fellow sirens' bones. From an evolutionary standpoint, it reassures us that we're not vulnerable or alone."
There was a certain lilt to her words, like she was trying to convince herself at the same time. So, she hadn't known that Dumbledore knew. She was just prepared to blindly defend her father's honor.
"The Moonbeam in France-" Cassie said, her voice catching. "They found her like the Moonbeam in France was found."
He wanted to be the one Malfoy was dancing with. Cassie passed him off to Zabini, making some snarky comment that Harry only caught the end of.
Draco tucked his head into Andrew's shoulder in hopes to hide himself away. He hated how much he had come to rely on his cousin's vehement presence at his side. Although, he supposed his magic had grown used to counterbalancing hers. He could almost feel it now, bundling him in a tight embrace, like the way his mother had when he was young and scared. It was crushing him, squeezing the air out of his lungs. As his vision grew spotty, Draco imagined he was in the deep trenches of the Atlantic.
She poured some cream into a small dish and set it in front of the cat, which immediately purred with delight at the sight of the daily treat.
She stood from where she knelt to wrap an arm around his shoulders. "It's coming, that's for sure. The Oracles believe he's connected to the murdered Moonbeams, as well. Did you need something from me?"
Ah, yes. The dreaded event that meant everyone would be staying over Winter Break, and would draw unwanted attention to Draco if he didn't make an appearance. His mother had already had him measured for new dress robes in August, and they would be arriving within the next week, likely along with a stern reminder he still had certain appearances to keep up.
"Dray, how come you didn't tell me how easy it is to manipulate Dumbledore? He's the most unsuspecting wizard I've ever met, not an ounce of resistance in him! Even Moody put up more of a challenge!"
His godfather laughed, a sound so rare, Draco spooked a bit from the floor to and tried to sit up. Cognizant of his struggle, Severus moved to sit down next to him. It honestly was all a bit unbelievable, seeing him sat on the floor with his robes pooling around him. Didn't he know the floor was wet? Likely a disgusting mix of blood and saltwater from the tub.
"It's okay, Draco, I'm right here," he reassured, lifting his hand once more. This time the touch wasn't rejected.
"Goddamn fucking Ministry and its anti-Apparition wards... Seriously, I should be able to zap out of this place in the case of emergency...Absolute fucking OSHA violation, fuck this stupid country and its backwards ass approach to everything..."
A weird itch in the back of his brain informed him that he wouldn't be dying anytime soon, and he groaned. The psychic bond between him and Cassie kept getting stronger, and with it meant he was picking up her knack for Divination. He already despised his Xylomancy lessons, but the unsolicited nudges from the universe
Andrew felt this was the opportune time to comment: "You're so lucky the wizards aren't here to listen to this crap; Weasley would be demanding our heads on spikes already."
Someone cleared their throat from behind them, and Harry nearly fell out of his seat, not recovering well when faced with Professor Snape. They really should not have been having this conversation in the library, of all places.
This is exactly what he had been trying to avoid! Sure, if Andrew was alone, whatever! There was no need for Draco to be a casualty of the probable truth.
Ugh, not pity. Did she really think that he'd have to be on his actual deathbed to apologize to her?
"Come in, then!" Cassie splashed the newcomer, which Draco took as his cue to begin moving towards the ledge occupied by a stack of large, fluffy towels and hurriedly climbing out and wrapping himself in one.
"What if someone sees us? They'll recognize us for sure, and even if they don't, there'll be reports of sirens in the Black Lake."
Harry had a tendency to have absolutely no clue as to what was going on around him. Hell, on a good day, it'd be a miracle if he could decipher what Hermione's mood was at breakfast. It wasn't that he didn't care, he just didn't know how to read for any emotion other than
Their daughter had been born in Sirenum scopuli for her own safety. Cassandra had refused to name her without Severus present, and had come alone to Spinner's End with plans to take him to a safehouse in the States where the three of them would be safe. They were supposed to meet in an alley a few blocks down at sunrise.
More footsteps greeted them. "Dray, stop looking at the water like it's going to bite you, this isn't Louisiana."
They didn't know what the general public were privy to. It was no secret that his father was an active Death Eater, nor Cassie's father for that matter. Would it be assumed they were protected under the Dark Lord, or, Heaven forbid, that they were fighting on his side?
The Snatcher's death was much quieter and took less than a second. It would have been silent if his hearing hadn't tuned in to the soft allure of Cassie's Song, followed by the thud of rumpled clothes hitting the ground as their owner folded in on himself.
Draco's migraine had gotten to the point where he felt the need to vomit with the slightest of movement. He groaned his displeasure, forcing down the threat of rising bile as he rolled onto his side to curl into the fetal position.
Wiping the tears away furiously, Lucius smiled manically, on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He nodded at Snape's response, before pacing the length of the room while rubbing at his face.
There was no need for Lucius to know he had already briefed Dumbledore and Minerva, had the entirety of the sirens at Hogwarts briefed and ready to lie at a moment's notice. Not yet.
Friends that he had barely communicated with all summer, and who he would have to keep his distance from to keep both him and themselves safe. If they discovered his secret and harbored it (as he knew they would), they could be charged as accomplices in harboring a fugitive creature. If he was going down, he would not drag them with him.
The bloke from before had returned, with a furious looking Cassie in front of him. She stormed towards Moody, who seemed taken aback, raising a hand in his direction. Where was her wand?
Dumbledore raised a wand, and Corey snapped at the headmaster to back off. He kept advancing forward anyways, and Harry couldn't restrain himself any further. Hermione was unsuccessful in stopping him the second time around--likely stunned as the scene before them unfolded--and no one else got in his way as he rushed to the front of the Hall.
"You're lucky there are witnesses present, or the things I'd do... They would not even recognize your corpse," Snape started, but Dumbledore cheerfully cleared his throat, which was enough for Snape to collect himself and back off, dusting himself off with an unnecessary amount of aggression.
Both males regretted the question at the Cheshire grin Cassie made, her eyes devilish as she made eye-contact with her mate. Thankfully, they'd never know what she was about to say, as the door swung open in time to settle the mood.
She rubbed circles into his back, shushing him. "The dance isn't going anywhere. Breathe with me, alright?"
Being back at Hogwarts after months of being away was a strange experience for Draco. Cassie and him had port-keyed to Hogsmeade at midnight, moving in utter silence through the desolate village before meeting Severus at the gate. Both wore long cloaks with hoods that obscured their faces from view, but the second Cassie laid eyes on Severus she leapt at him, the hug nearly toppling them both to the ground.
As Malfoy danced with his cousin, an uncoordinated mess--were both of them trying to lead?--that they still somehow managed to look graceful, Harry felt a pit in his stomach as he came upon a realization.
Draco detested everyone being privy to his business. His safety be damned, he'd like some privacy as well, thank you very much.
Perhaps by the end of the year, the Ministry would be prompted to change their classification to magical
Draco shuffled over, desperate for anything that would cure his trembling nerves. An arm tucked itself around his shoulders, the weight a reassuring presence to his fraught mind.
Her face hardened. She made no move to look in his direction and pushed herself up to a sitting position. He followed automatically, trembling with nerves.
Moody was chastised for his handling of the situation, and Harry heard Dumbledore's name brought up, yet he was still trying to wrap his head around the wandless magic he'd just seen. Wandless magic was incredibly difficult, especially one that was powerful enough to ward off a hex. Cassie didn't even break a sweat, hadn't even hesitated. She'd done that before.
Draco spun in circles, trying to find the location of the culprit to no luck. Why would someone do all of this for a silly game? It was just a cash prize in the end, plus a trophy that would mean absolutely nothing once the war started.
"Your mother called here, but you had left already. Let her rest, Dray. She's been learning aquaparition this week."
The shower spray was turned on, lukewarm water soaking him in a feeble attempt to calm his trembling nerves. He kept gagging, despite there being nothing left to purge from his system, the water dripping down his face and into his mouth and turning his coughs to pathetic gurgles. He wished for it to drown him. He wished he was capable of drowning.
Having re-watched the memory himself, there was one question still rattling about in his brain. One that Kingsley had asked, one he was not able to answer for them or himself.
Draco would never be the same because of it. It was the last pure thing he had in his life, he couldn't move on from it. Had no desire to do such a thing.
The Gryffindors, well. There were some capable enough to unearth his secrets, and once someone found out it would spread like wildfire throughout the whole school. The Ministry would be upon him in mere seconds, swift to deliver his death sentence. Even worse, if they kept it secret, they'd use it to hold it over him and blackmail him into doing their dirty work. He could barely fathom being dragged into one of their reckless schemes.
"Harry, this is the fourth time you've read that book cover-to-cover. It's not going to change, so you may as well just say what's on your mind."
Definitely Severus, then. Probably looking more worried than before if Harry failed so badly in hiding his nerves.
Draco somehow ended up squished between Andrew and Cassie on a couch that really wasn't large enough for the three of them and their broad shoulders that protruded into each other's space. Said shoulders were bumping into each other as they all tried to get comfortable, before Snape took pity on them and charmed the couch to fit them more comfortably.
"Ah, and not the other way around? I have heard some little birdies about saying something about Draco Malfoy's-"
One of the young men pushed off the wall he was leaning on, sauntering up to the trio. Andrew had straightened his posture, and Cassie had shoved her way in front of Draco, her height obscuring the men from his view.
Cass smiled at his eagerness. "Am I going to teach you how to put the fear of Merlin deep into the very bones of random strangers, compelling them into a mute silence?" She mockingly scratched at her chin. "I don't know, such a nefarious act seems very out of character for me."
Snape glared as his coughing slowly died down and made no comment before moving on. "It should be noted that for this portion, both will need to be in the water, if that wasn't already implied by the need for a scale. After She aids the human's part of the ritual, the scale should then be taken and inserted into the incision on the Siren's shoulder. At that point, the ritual is complete and water can be poured over the wound to heal it. It's very likely,
The portrait swung open, and he broke out of his friends' supporting grasps to rush to the toilet and empty the contents of his stomach. Andrew stood at the portrait's entrance, stance wide and arms stretched between the open door and the wall, as though he were trying to block someone from entering. Draco rested his cheek on the cool porcelain, observing the protective stance. If She couldn't protect them, then how could Andrew? They weren't even near a body of water.
"Draco, is there something in my teeth?" Andrew asked, having caught him in the act of staring like a creep.
A chair toppled over from the speed at which it was pushed back, clattering to the floor as its owner stood up. Cassie finally lifted her head from her seat, if only to look up at fuming Andrew with a calculated innocence to her face.
Mad-Eye Moody was much like looking at a fish left out to rot for much too long. Draco didn't dare dive any deeper than that, not needing the nightmares of whatever he'd find.
Snape chuckled, the sound lacking in mirth and not reaching his eyes. "Seeing as her mother was tortured by You-Know-Who before she took her own life to escape his wrath, one could say she was a very hands-off parent."
"Narcissa, it's lovely to see you." The two smiled at each other, but otherwise made no physical contact. If this was supposedly a member of his family, would they not embrace for even the slightest of seconds?
