And, fuck, Draco was
change his life.
But Draco, Harry realised with a pang, wasn’t smiling anymore. He wasn’t even blushing. Instead, he looked almost distressed, chewing on his bottom lip, seemingly deep in thought as he regarded Harry.
“Promise, Draco.”
“Harry?”
“Harry.”
When they broke apart again, Draco didn’t go far, instead settling his forehead against Harry’s and whispering with a mischievous, oh-so-Slytherin smirk, the sort that made his eyes dance and flicker like two licks of silver flame, “To be perfectly frank, so am I.”
“He’s a muggle, right?” Harry said, silently proud of himself he’d remembered that much. Honestly, Hermione was right; his memory was almost as terrible as his eyesight.
, was already foul.
Immediately, Harry’s mind started racing. That made no sense; why would the Order of the Phoenix have anything to do with the maniac currently hell-bent on murdering Harry?
Except then he promptly shut his mouth again, shook his head once and then said, tone incredibly weary, “I should have seen this coming, shouldn’t I?”
“A dangerous endeavour.” Draco was grinning now. “But please, by all means, do share your no doubt fascinating thoughts. I’m all ears.”
could be listening—he’d secretly been quite pleased. Hearing Harry be called his
Draco had done enough protecting this past month, had saved Harry more times than he could count, both physically and emotionally. The least he could do now was return the favour.
“I just came by to see how you’re doing,” he said. “I heard about Yaxley, or, well, read about, and I figured you might appreciate some company.” His eyes darted back to Draco. “But I see I needn’t have worried.”
The woman’s spindly fingers curled tightly around her jar of spiders as she hissed, “You went and betrayed not only the Dark Lord, but your family name and all it represents, boy, and yet you have the gall to come here and lecture
“Draco,” he said again, and his soothing tone made Draco want to rip out first his hair, then that of his so-called friend. “I’m going to tell you something, but before I do, you need to promise me you’ll stay calm. Trust that everything that can be done is being done, and then some. None of it is your fault, not even marginally. Okay?”
And, Merlin, it felt
But, as he’d said oftentimes before, someone up there really did have it out for him. And so, while he followed Potter into the kitchen, watching under a furrowed brow as the Gryffindor started loading their dirty dishes into some ghastly muggle contraption he’d called a ‘dishwasher’, Draco’s luck shrivelled up.
Harry could feel his face heat. Oh god,
Draco weakly hoped she’d at least grant him the mercy of a quick and mostly painless death—he’d take Avada Kedavra over an Entrail-Expelling hex any day of the week. Judging by the glint in Hermione’s eyes, however, he knew it was a futile hope.
Draco looked absolutely baffled. At least he wasn’t sad anymore, Harry thought weakly. “Merlin, I really can’t believe you don’t know this. How can you not know this? You have a bloody soulmark!”
Bile rose at the back of his throat, and he rolled over just in time to be sick all over the side of his bed, rendering the previously white sheets, well…not white anymore. Groggily and with a pounding headache, Harry sat up, and after blinking the blurriness from his vision, his gaze drifted across the room, instinctively taking in his surroundings. He’d been in plenty hospital rooms in his life, so it took him about half a second to realize he must be in St. Mungo’s. But why? What had—
Harry chuckled. “Hogwarts Professor not showy enough for you, Parvati?”
on so many different levels. “You disappoint me. Here I thought you would jump at the chance to duel me. You know, defend your boyfriend’s honour and all that. How is Mr. Potter, by the way? Not dead yet, I presume?”
Especially when it came to Harry's nonexistent love life.
Oh Christ, Harry’d been lurking in front of Draco’s bedroom door like some sort of creep.
The moment Draco crossed over the threshold, eliciting a dull sound from the rusty bell that hung ominously over their heads, yet another wave of nostalgia rolled over him—and not the good kind. He swallowed hard, his throat tight, but forced himself to adapt his usual pureblood composure. He just wouldn’t look around. Yes, that’s it; he’d keep his eyes fixed resolutely ahead, and he’d speak to Philomena, and he’d convince her to help. And then they’d leave, and Draco would never ever set foot in Renaults and Co. ever again. No, scratch that—the entirety of Knockturn Alley would be off-limits from now to the day he died. Self-inflicted exile, of sorts.
“—oh, sorry, you first—”
. Merlin, Potter was still as oblivious as he’d been back at school. But, for once, Draco was grateful for it. For a moment there, he really had thought Potter had figured it out.
Draco shook his head resolutely. “No. I mean it, she doesn’t want me like that. Or any way, really. But it’s fine. I’ve long since made peace with the situation. There will be other options down the road, I’m sure.” Only he wasn’t. He’d tried it before, searching for someone who might fill the void. But each time, it had always gone up in smoke. Draco knew it was partially his own fault.
Fuck, Harry
Harry blinked, caught off guard, only to find Healer Preedan looking at him expectantly, while Healer Hodkinson scowled at the floor, Ron watched him nervously and Ginny stood at his side, arms crossed, frowning.
But, still, he continued. Knowing when to stop had always been a problem for him, ever since childhood. He blamed his parents—well, primarily his mother, but she’d pretty much encompassed the term ‘parents’ for Draco ever since he could remember. And, alright, yes, perhaps he had been a tad spoiled, both materialistically and with attention. However, in situations like these, pushing and prodding until you hit the breaking point was simply such
“Attack the Chosen One, without a wand?” Yaxley barked an entirely mirthless laugh. “I may be slightly insane, Potter, but don’t make the mistake of thinking me a fool.”
He wasn’t even irritated by the heavy dose of sarcasm in her tone. God, being with Draco all the time really was affecting him. “Yes,
“I—” he stammered, mind a reeling mess, heart all the while stumbling over its own rhythm. “What the hell are you talking about? What did you—did something happen to Draco? Is he alright?”
Good god, Harry was completely smitten.
. Because he must have noticed Harry’s painful winces when Ron had thrown his arms around him, must have spotted his suppressed little yelps of pain every time he’d tried to sit up.
Hermione let out a flustered huff. “But it
Harry blinked. Opened his mouth. Closed it again. Finally, he settled on, “You have issues, you do realise that, right? Normal people can’t do that.”
They were silent for a long moment, and Draco watched Harry sigh and run his fingers through his hair again and again. It was a painful sight, seeing the usually so optimistic Gryffindor so down.
And then.
“Well then,” Hermione said at last, evidently trying hard to wrangle her shock, for which Harry was eternally grateful. “It’s fantastic to see you two getting along so well. Honestly, I had my doubts whether you’d be able to work things out. But it seems I needn’t have worried.”
from!”
Harry forgot to breathe. Either that, or perhaps his heart just stopped working entirely, split in two by that horrid sensation of fear that had suddenly gripped him and wouldn’t let go.
Draco had yet to decide whether he respected the man for it or pitied him.
you, boy.” The Death Eater gave a particularly deranged cackle. “You’re done for, don’t you realise, you and your precious Potter both, your father ensured that when he helped me k—”
“Harry,” he began slowly. It was the sort of tone that might proceed the words ‘we need to talk’ and were it not for the fact that A) Harry had complete and total trust in both Draco and the state of their relationship, and B) he’d just gotten a fantastic snog, then he might have been a tad worried.
Harry blinked, looking a mixture between surprised, confused and utterly horrified, but then hastily dropped his wand again. A deep, deep blush spread over his cheeks as he ducked his head in mortification, and Draco might have swooned at how utterly adorable his soulmate was, were it not for his mother.
There was a silence so pregnant it hung in the air like smog, and Draco couldn’t take it anymore.
Fortunately for her and her ever-reddening face, Nic jumped in at that point, still chuckling lightly. “Lovely as Parvati is, she and I aren’t dating. Our relationship is strictly platonic. Besides, it wouldn’t work anyway. Me, I play for the other team, unfortunately.”
“You should know you’re already facing three lifetime sentences in Azkaban, Mr. Yaxley,” said Takeuchi, tone calm. Draco knew it was important they keep their calm, knew he should be trying the same, but he couldn’t help but feel resentment towards the interrogator for it—how the fuck could one stay calm at a time like this? Yaxley had just
When their Butterbeer came a short period of time later, Draco was delighted to find there was, in fact, both a heaping of extra cream, plus a generous amount of caramel-golden drizzle atop of his, and he didn’t hesitate before taking one long, deep sip of the drink. It was only when he noticed Harry staring at him instead of drinking from his own mug of Butterbeer that Draco froze, realizing too late that he might have very well made a fool of himself.
It was safe to say Narcissa Black-Malfoy was a Slytherin through and through, even decades later.
more that actually was.
But there would be no yelling, and there would be no cursing. Draco simply clenched his jaw and hissed coolly, “Do not for a single second put yourself on an equal footing with that man.”
For a moment, Harry thought he was going to refuse. Sneer like he’d always done back at Hogwarts, spit some disparaging remark about how Harry wasn’t worthy of Side-Along Apparating with a
“It was good seeing you,” Harry said. “Promise me you’ll send a Patronus the moment they have news on Yaxley’s whereabouts?”
Just like that, Draco stopped cursing, and his face smoothed over in that carefully constructed mask of composure Harry had grown oh-so-well acquainted with over the years. It was answer enough, so much so that Harry hardly even heard his next words over the violent beating of his own heart.
But Harry didn’t say any of that. Instead, he smiled, and said, “Fine, you two, enough of this horrible sentimentality. I’m starving, so if you two don’t mind, I’m going to get me some Thai.” Ron grumbled something, but when Hermione plopped down beside him (read: basically on his lap), he promptly shut up.
To remember that something—what something?—was being done to combat whatever—which whatever?—was causing his typically so unrufflable friend such worry.
“Plus, we should head over to see Mum and the others anyway,” added Ron. “She must be going sparse, what with the baby coming and Harry here and Fred’s incessant crying. Didn’t you say anyway you wanted to be there when Roxanne’s born?”
, all he could do was clamp his mouth shut and nod dumbly.
“You and your morning coffee,” he heard Harry mutter, but thankfully neither him nor Weasley argued as Draco led the way out of the interrogation room, heart a beating, blustering mess.
When Draco glanced back over to his boyfriend, the Gryffindor looked stunned, eyes wide as they jumped from Narcissa to Draco and back. For a split second, Draco had the irrational fear he might be overwhelmed; Narcissa was known to oftentimes come on as a bit strong, and Harry hadn’t had the best experiences with the Malfoy family so far. As a matter of fact, the last time he’d seen Narcissa must’ve been directly after the war, during the trials.
Harry’s mind was already devising a hundred different escape routes with varying degrees of success, wondering whether either of the other men would notice if he slowly slunk back into the kitchen and acted like he’d never set foot in the living room in the first place, because honestly, wasn’t he supposed to stay cooped up in his flat to
“Will you make it right?” asked Granger, and Draco had momentarily forgotten she was there. He didn’t know whether she meant he ought to apologize, or whether she was telling him to
Within a half-second, conversation at their table—and the next, and the next, it seemed—had halted just as abruptly, and all eyes found him. Harry had half a mind to rip down the sleeve still hiding his new soulmark from the world, but instead simply gaped stupidly at his right wrist as the warmth lessened, then subsided completely.
—Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it. Because, while he’d fantasized so often about being friends one day with Harry Potter, about being able to do things like this, go out to a pub and just talk and laugh and not get into a row every time either of them opened their mouths, it had always been just that—a fantasy. But now it appeared as though Draco might finally be getting his wish after all.
“No, you listen to me, it
, the second most oblivious person in the world! And it made Draco want to yell at the carrot-capped buffoon so, so bad, yell and punch that infuriatingly curious look off his freckled face.
Calm.
Hermione sighed and raked a hand through her hair. “I didn’t mean to alarm you further. You must be so stressed as it is, and me barging in here blathering on about how much danger you’re in surely isn’t helping. It’s just… Well, this might sound stupid, seeing as you work as an Auror, but, Harry, after the war finally ended, I thought the danger was over. That we might finally get a break. God knows we need it—you more than any of us.” She breathed a laugh. “And now there’s another Death Eater after you. It’s all quite laughable, isn’t it? In an entirely mirthless way, of course.”
The Gryffindor turned to Weasley, and he smiled at him as well. And call him jealous or spiteful or cruel, but Draco took no small pleasure in seeing that smile become tighter, smaller, less genuine when directed at Weasley.
Draco clenched his jaw. "It was hardly pettiness on my part,
But, damn him, it worked.
And be it that broken look or the simple sound of his voice, but something sobered Harry enough to break him out of his temporary daze, and before the Slytherin could say another word, finish an apology he shouldn’t even be making, Harry braved the little space between them and kissed him back.
“Yes. Friends.”
, Harry thought dimly as Draco’s hand once again wrapped around his wrist and started pulling him down the sidewalk. The real Draco Malfoy, the one with the sneers and sarcastic comments, the one who would never ever have the effrontery to
Draco scowled, anger simmering up in his chest. The
“Look, clearly something’s bothering you,” Harry began, forcing himself to remain calm. Inside, he could feel a surge of irritation swelling in his chest, but he pushed it away, pushed it down. Now was not the time. “If you could just
Draco snorted and rolled his eyes, and although he was evidently trying hard to look annoyed, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards effectively betrayed him. “

Slytherins—even when you knew they were playing mind games, you simply couldn’t help but play right into their cards.
There may not have been any need, but that didn’t stop Draco from worrying, not at all. And, it seemed, neither did it Potter’s friends. Yet, by some miracle, none of them said anything further, and even Weasley merely pulled a face before plopping down on the chair beside Granger’s, her hand clasped tightly in his own. Draco caught a glimpse of the name stamped on Weasley’s freckled wrist, and, with some disgust but absolutely zero surprise, found said name to be
He sighed. “You know what, why not. Maybe you’ll be able to shed some light on the whole situation, because I’m bloody well swamped. It’s Draco. He and I…we had a row, to put it simply.”
And it was that second kiss that first Weasley, and then seconds later Hermione walked in on, and then promptly froze dead in their tracks, eyes wide, mouths agape.
Harry that—but because
But just because he’d invited her didn’t mean he wasn’t shocked when she’d actually showed up that evening, offering him a tentative smile before sliding into the booth beside Luna.
So, really, sod all that.
For a split second, Harry feared he’d done something stupid. That he’d ruined it, ruined this moment, the sort of moment you were supposed to remember until the day you died, the sort of moment you’d tell your children about one day.
Lavender’s smile widened even further, and Harry was glad at least one of his friends was loving their life right now. It made the confusing muddle that was
“Wait,
Instead, he studied the Slytherin closer. While his pale skin was flawless as ever, it was slightly darker underneath his eyes, and his usually neatly combed back white blond hair was loose, falling all the way down to his sharp cheekbones. Harry dimly noted he liked it better that way, but then immediately winced at how ridiculous that thought was.
Draco looked pained. “Harry…”
A flash of silver blond was the last thing Harry saw before his legs gave way and his vision went completely dark.
Nic chuckled. “No worries. Sometimes you just get those sort of days, right? Happens to everyone.”
It was so very
Potter had been glancing over his shoulder towards Draco quite a few times now, and so Draco snapped, growing increasingly frustrated by the so completely and utterly
And maybe Harry wouldn’t want him, maybe he wouldn’t love him back, maybe he’d decide their friendship wasn’t worth it after all, not when Draco wanted
So, yeah, enough chitchat. Have fun reading, and I hope you like it!
Even through his fog of dislike, Draco dimly appreciated the She-Weasel’s cunning. Seems he’d underestimated her in that regard—it would be the first and the last time.
Harry really needed to get better at reading people’s expressions, how had he survived a bloody war when he couldn’t even figure out what his best friend was thinking? “That’s…a useful hobby to have.”
That was another thing—Dominic Hayes was indisputably pretty. Or handsome, rather. Harry wasn’t sure exactly which one word or characteristic would be best used to describe Nic; his eyes, for one, were very deeply blue, and his hair looked incredibly soft, and he had a very nice smile with very white teeth. He was one of those people who looked amazing without even trying, sort of like Dra—
Harry only dimly noted they must be putting on quite the show for the muggles all around them. Dinner and a performance—they were certainly getting their money’s worth, that’s for sure.
As if Draco hadn’t surprised everyone enough already, he simply shrugged in response, although Harry could tell by the stiff set of his shoulders and ever-so-faintly flushed cheeks that the Slytherin was a lot more uncomfortable than he was letting on. “It…needed to be said. I, uhm, realise now I might not have been very…courteous towards you during our time together at Hogwarts.”
“I’m more than glad to risk that if it means shutting that pretty mouth of yours up for once.”
But then a single tear rolled down the side of Draco’s face, and he smiled at Harry and breathed, “I love you, too. Merlin, Harry, I love you so much, you have no idea.”
Harry nodded along to his words. “I heard about that. That’s why you need to develop feelings for your soulmate before their full name appears on your wrist, right?”
Draco continued to glare down at him and Harry continued to glare up, neither so much as blinking lest the other think they’d won. Except staring directly into the Slytherin’s eyes was quite a lot harder than he’d have expected, possibly due to the startling silver intensity of them, and it made Harry realise two things:
to be
But the fact that she now sat farther away from Harry meant she sat nearer to Draco. It made clandestinely watching Harry much more difficult.
Pain exploded as his skin was ripped open, and Draco cried out as blood poured through his left shirtsleeve, visible even through the dark fabric. His nerves felt as though on fire, and he had to clamp down on his tongue to keep from whimpering like some pathetic animal. But the agony was horrific, more so than he’d expected, and his eyes promptly started to burn.
Harry knew he should move. He should move, and he should stand up, and he should laugh it all off, offer an awkward joke or two about his ridiculous clumsiness and then act as though none of it had happened, as though it were nothing and as though he wasn’t mentally panicking.

do. And besides, it’s not like I can leave you alone here anyway.” He said it like a joke, but Harry couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty. “It’s silly, I know.”
He hurtled across the room, focus on the small pot of green powder sitting on the mantelpiece. But just as he reached out to grab a fistful of the stuff, a jet of purple light zipped by and hit with the wall just above his head.
“As much as I would love to berate you on the subject of blindly trusting strangers just because they’re passably attractive, Potter, I’m going to let it slide this once, for the sole reason that we do not have the time,” drawled the Slytherin. “Now stop gaping and
Malfoy lifted a single blond eyebrow. “That may be so, but there’s one slight hitch in your brilliant plan. Lest you’ve forgotten, I’m stuck playing babysitter for
At this, Harry chuckled—and immediately froze again, eyes widening ever so slightly. And then, because clearly Draco’s soulmate was a complete nutcase, he reached out and swatted at Draco’s arm, pulling a face as he said, “Ugh, I shouldn’t be laughing.
A little bubble of silence engulfed their table, the muffled sounds of the rest of the restaurant nothing more than background music.
Draco didn’t deserve Harry. No one did, no one and nothing, not him, not the Wizarding World, not the cruel, harsh reality they’d been thrust into without a bloody choice in the matter.
The corners of Blaise’s mouth twitched, but he wisely kept his thoughts to himself. “Yup. Actually, I thought he was still here. If I’d known Potter had left, I would have come in earlier. I’m glad he did, though. Last time I saw him, he looked like death personified.”
Again, Blaise, much to Draco’s gratitude, answered evenly, “Yes, that’s right. I’m afraid I can’t tell you any more than that, though, since I don’t know any further details myself. But we do have a team of our best Healers in there with him as we speak. I have no doubt he’ll make a full recovery.”
Because Pansy had indeed taken the words ‘head-to-toe makeover’ to heart; Harry’s hair was shorter, but not by much, just enough that it no longer appeared like he’d just rolled out of bed and instead looked tousled and mussed by choice. Plus, now that his hair was shorter you could actually see his ears.
? What was that about?"
Draco’s fingers slid through Harry’s hair, teasing and coaxing, and the latter showed his appreciation by pushing up and against him, all the while unable to stop smiling. They stood there and kissed until the outside world completely fell away, until seconds merged into minutes and minutes seemed like hours, until they had no choice but to break apart lest their lungs give out on sheer lack of oxygen.
Harry swallowed hard, let his eyes rake over Draco’s face one last time—and then he looked.
It was then that Draco, the utter loon, finally had the brilliant idea he might want to
However, first and foremost, Draco had ruined his date, so he shoved all thoughts that weren’t how much he wanted to wring the blond’s skinny, maddeningly long neck out and away.
Blaise simply watched on wordlessly, giving Draco all the confirmation he could possibly need.
was as well—that same pained
“Yes?” Draco asked, hoping the Gryffindor couldn’t hear his racing heart.
“Actually, Hermione,” he said with a smirk, “please do continue. I find myself unusually interested in this story. Obsessed with me, you say?”
“But you
No, the person in front of Harry was a stranger, and said stranger didn’t want to be his friend, to go on a date with him, to take him out to some fancy French restaurant in muggle London and talk about his family and friends and infuriating bodyguard/flatmate/crush.
Draco cast a quick Reparo on the plate, and gathered up the pieces of sandwich, careful to be quiet as not to wake Harry, who still slumbered peacefully. Then he stood, and walked back across the room, plate and smashed sandwich in hand. He allowed himself one last glance over his shoulder and smiled.
What the fuck.
Funny how he hadn’t even mentioned Hogwarts’ fourth house. A Slytherin hater—how novel and entirely unexpected.
The blond cleared his throat, and then he said slowly, tentatively, “Right then. Potter.
He stopped speaking, the words dying in his throat. For just like Harry, Draco’s gaze had dropped to Harry’s wrist, the one that had been previously inscribed with a large, cursive
Baby steps. Ha. If only.
Blaise chuckled, waving a dismissive hand. “Nah, not saying. Especially not after you so rudely replaced me with
“Sorry what?”
“Okay, what’s going on?”
Hermione made a sound halfway between a buff of laughter and a grunt, but the rest of them knew better than to comment on it. Another long tirade about how inept Professor Trelawney was as an educator was not something Harry wanted for his twentieth birthday.
It was so out of character, so un-Draco-Malfoy-like, that Harry still couldn’t quite fathom it.
“Salazar help me.”
Jennings frowned but wisely refrained from commenting. Draco hadn’t yet gathered the courage to look in a mirror since being flung against a bookshelf by Yaxley’s murderer, but he had no doubt he must look properly appalling right now.
“But then,” Harry said—or rather, croaked, because suddenly his throat felt awfully constricted, “why did you lose it when I told you I was going on a date with Nic?”
And so, finally, he pursed his lips and knocked.
Silence.
And, the thing is,
“Potter?” Draco called, but only silence answered him. He tried again, “Harry?”
, Draco had no idea whether with ‘you’ the Death Eater meant the Auror department as a whole. Or just him. Just Draco.
But, of course, Harry being Harry and having the luck of your average Grim, his stealthy retreat back into the kitchen was cut short when he bumped into the very sharp edge of a nearby cabinet, eliciting a sharp, involuntary “
Warmth, and gentleness—and affection.
He expected Potter to retaliate with a comment of his own. But the usually so quick to anger Gryffindor simply sighed, angry scowl thawing into a weary sort of frown that had Draco’s anger melting away as well.
Harry chuckled. “No, not even after all the horrible things you said. And, to be perfectly frank—” He draped his arms back around the Slytherin’s neck and leaned forwards to plant a quick peck on the corner of his mouth. “—I’m quite glad you ruined my date.”
Well, not any longer. There would be no more missing out, and no more ‘supposed to’s, because now Harry was determined, he was focused, he was
He said it with such conviction, such certitude, that Draco almost believed him. Almost.
Harry should have been touched by the compassion, but all he could feel was that same ache, that same
The kiss lasted for what might have been a few seconds or minutes or hours—the feeling of Draco’s warm, soft lips against his caused Harry to quickly and totally lose all sense of time.
After the war, things had been hard for Harry. He had no trouble admitting that. Things had been hard for everyone, he knew, not only those directly involved in the Battle of Hogwarts. But it had taken him longer than others to fit himself back into the mould, to find his way back into ‘normal life’, as Hermione so loved putting it—a life where he didn’t have to look over his shoulder every two seconds, a life where there was no Voldemort chasing him, a life where the day’s most challenging feat was figuring out what brand of cereal to buy at the grocery store.
Oh, if looks could kill, Draco would be nothing more than a smouldering heap of ashes.
The force of it sent Draco tumbling to the side. Before he could scramble up again, Yaxley was already there, looming above him with a truly murderous expression.
“Now,” Robards said. “There are still plenty of things I need to get done today, and I’m sure you all do too, so I’ll make this short. Auror Malfoy will watch over Auror Potter until this would-be assassin is identified and detained. Once Auror Potter is discharged from St. Mungo’s, I suggest Auror Malfoy take up temporary residence at Potter’s flat, after all, it’s entirely possible the culprit might try to get to him that way. I'd also suggest the both of you refrain from coming into the office any time soon, with the Ministry being such a crowded place. Consider the successful realisation of this partnership your assignment for the imminent future.” He paused, glancing from Draco to Potter. “I trust you two can maintain a professional, civil partnership for the duration of the matter?”
Somewhere in the room Draco knew Weasley was hanging around as well, and Robards and another nameless Auror there to watch the proceedings. But all Draco could see was Harry, and Harry’s distress, and it made him seethe with disgust and anger and hatred for Yaxley, who had done this.
Taken aback by Luna’s uncharacteristic seriousness, Harry simply stared. Before, he or anyone else for that matter, could utter another word, the door to Harry’s hospital room opened once again. This time, three new faces came striding in.
Harry had to wait until Ron pulled back before he could speak, both because A) he’d have likely gotten a mouthful of ginger hair had he opened his mouth any earlier and B) with Ron draped over half his chest, it hurt. Quite a lot.
Draco kicked the man’s legs out from under him and immediately dove to the side. He leapt up and started back towards the fireplace, shooting a hasty ‘Stupefy’ over his shoulder.
After all, Hermione and Ron had found each other—they were
Potter, of course, didn’t hesitate before walking right up to the shop door and past the threshold, not looking back once. Not that Draco had hoped he would. However, Potter’s eagerness gave Draco no choice but to follow, thus robbing him of any opportunity to chicken out.
And, at last, he did.
Yaxley snorted, and for a moment, Draco feared that was it. His eyes roamed over his surroundings, desperatedly looking for something, anything.
But standing there in the dimly-lit kitchen with Draco’s warm lips pressed against his, one of the Slytherin’s hands tilting his chin up, the other at the back of his head, tangled in his hair, Harry completely lost all ability to function. He could only stand there, frozen to the spot, limbs as useless and unresponsive as his brain.
Fourth floor.
Draco, however, took pity on the man and broke the kiss, backing away to give Harry room to flee, if he so desired. Honestly, Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if he actually did try to flee, that’s how panicked the Gryffindor looked.
That, and it caused the monstrous claw around his heart to tighten painfully.
For he was no morning person, and that was a fact.
Draco’s chest tightened. “He could be bluffing. Maybe there is no accomplice, and Yaxley just said that to create further panic. His last hurrah, as he said.”
if he squinted hard enough. The skin there was still perfectly bare, just as it had been his entire life. Tomorrow, though, that would change.
Draco scoffed. “Taking personal offense now, are we?” His eyes narrowed at Nic, and he took in his jeans and trainers and coat, all very muggle indeed. “You’re muggleborn, clearly, or at least half-muggle. So, who was it? Who did you lose during the war, and which Death Eater did it? I doubt it was my father—he never liked getting his hands too dirty—but perhaps dear Auntie Bella? Or was it someone else entirely, and you, just as so many others, are simply looking for a scapegoat to blame for all the misery the war brought you?”
Draco was a dark chocolate sort of person, as in 90% cocoa, so bitter it made you grimace. Harry just knew it.
He said it with a hint of wry humour—but Harry couldn’t bring himself to laugh, or chuckle, or even smile. The resignation in the Slytherin’s tone, the quiet acceptance that a measly half-truce was all the two of them could ever be trusted to have…it was the last straw.
. “Tell me, or I’m not coming.” He scowled. “Wait, no, I’m not coming regardless, because as you well know I’m on a
But Harry had just
Harry reached out with his free hand to shake Narcissa’s, and he replied, “Nice to meet you too, Mrs. Malfoy. Properly, this time.”
Narcissa opened her mouth to reply. But then she paused, and closed it. Glanced between Draco and Harry.
that it was a miracle the Slytherin didn’t keel over dead from the sheer intensity of it.
Pansy, much to Harry’s evident annoyance, snorted. “Oh, you’re
Thankfully, Harry hardly resisted at all, and Draco was almost at the door when Weasley let out a startled yelp. “Hey! What do you think you’re doi—”
For it wasn’t Harry standing by the fireplace, wasn’t Nic either, or Robards or anyone he would have expected.
Remember back when I freaked out about posting two days late? Good times, good times.
Why remained a mystery to him. God knows he had more than enough reasons to cry, to lay curled up in his bed, curtains drawn, and sob until his eyes were sore. He used to think he’d used up all his tears in the year directly after the war, that he’d depleted his tear-stash to the point of ruin. There’d been too many lives lost, too many people irretrievably gone, too many names to mourn and faces to miss.
Right, Harry decided, already gracelessly rolling off the couch—self-pity could wait, at least until after dinner.
Harry grinned. “I will. How about you invite her over sometime this week? After all, it looks like you’ll be staying here for a while.”
Draco huffed beside him, and Harry thought it might have been a chuckle. But before he could look and make sure, Pansy quipped, “
She laughed at that, and although it was hardly more than a strangled little huff, Harry’s smile widened at the sound, a flake of the tension still smothering his chest lifting.
“Yeah, I, uhm…gathered as much,” Harry mumbled, and he tried to look away—except when you’re sandwiched in between the kitchen counter and the one person you’re trying very hard not to look at, your options are fairly limited. “I’m bi.”

And then there was his stomach.
a horrible idea,” Draco insisted. “And I’m not being
A flash of something Harry couldn’t read passed over the Slytherin’s statuesque features, but then he was back to scowling again, and he spat, “Making a right fool of myself, it appears. Merlin, Potter, next time you faint in front of me after having just coughed up enough blood to fill a bathtub, I’ll just leave you in the alley, yeah?”
Harry shot him a glare, but the effect was ruined by the smile tugging steadfastly at his lips. Merlin, Draco thought, they really had come far, hadn’t they?
Harry sighed. “Yes. Yes, it can. Again, so sorry for everything.”
And, under the starless dark night sky and colourful fireworks around him, he finally closed his eyes and let the shadows sweep him away.
And, although he’d love to argue, Harry’s drooping eyes and sleep-craving body begged to differ, and so he found himself nodding. “Fine. But I expect owled updates. Hourly.”
When a few more seconds passed and still no answer came, no sound or response of any kind, Harry chanced a glance up into the other man’s face.
Harry added in his mind.
Harry sincerely doubted that. But, when faced with that
And so, he swallowed hard, and nodded. “I’m sorry. I…I didn’t mean for any of it to happen. Yaxley…he caught me off guard, caught both of us off guard…” At that, his eyes trailed back over to Draco’s bed, and Harry went quiet, the lump in his throat making any further words impossible.
Damn, Draco though faintly as he flung open the door, wand lifted high, Blaise had been right—Harry’s Gryffindor tendencies really were rubbing off on him.
The emphasis, of course, lying squarely on ‘tried’.
If things go according to plan (and I hope they do), next chapter ought to be a big one, so stay tuned!
Not to mention Harry’s fondness of the woman had doubled, maybe even tripled when she’d admitted Draco had totally
Oh bugger.
Draco drew back his hand from where it had until moments before rested on the bed, tangled in Harry’s, the motion so lightning-fast even Harry might not have caught it—were it not, of course, for the burst of cold that seeped from his fingers up his arm and into his chest at the sudden loss of contact.
Harry gave a curt nod and headed back into the kitchen. He glanced at Draco as he passed, but again the blond would not meet his gaze, too busy glowering. Either he simply didn’t notice, or he very much did and merely could not be bothered to meet Harry’s eyes—whichever option it was, Harry didn’t like it one bit.
soulmark on the front page of the Daily Prophet for the entire country to read?”
“Right then,” said Harry, looking from Draco to Nic. The smile he sent the other man, if small, made Draco want to break something. Preferably Hayes’ face. “See you later, then?”
, what do you think you’re—”
All he cared about was the very interesting, some might even say fascinating crack in the wall mere inches above Draco’s head.
“I don’t think you were being homophobic just then,” she said, tone light, as though it was all just so unproblematic and easy.
!” Parvati exclaimed, looking scandalized, and at the same time very, very embarrassed. “Nic and I aren’t…he isn’t…we’re not—”
, Blaise had said.
Harry made a face, splaying his hand over his heart dramatically. “And here I thought you were supposed to be protecting me. Turns out I was the sacrificial lamb all along.”
No. Yaxley couldn’t know. He simply
Harry smiled, but it was a smile of pure wretchedness, of sad understanding. “Thought so.”
Malfoy wrinkled his pert nose. Harry was silently glad for the familiar sneer—the earlier panic in Malfoy’s eyes, accompanied by something else, something Harry couldn’t quite put a name to, had been
A moment of silence passed. Then Malfoy said simply, “Good. You're awake."
How the hell had he ever gotten so damn lucky?
The corners of her mouth twitched upwards into a smile, but before Harry’s jaw could hit the floor, Narcissa cleared her throat and stood. “Anyway, I really should be heading back to the Manor now. I just felt I should inform you personally of the news.” Her gaze darted back to Harry, and, yes, that was genuine warmth in her eyes. “Harry, I’m so glad you and Draco finally found each other. You two suit each other well, if I do say so myself. Just…take good care of him, will you? He likes to act tough but, sometimes, oftentimes, he needs protecting as well.”
Draco scowled. “I’m an Auror, Blaise. Danger’s quite literally in the job description. Where’s all this new-found concern coming from?”
It wasn’t that he felt uncomfortable with Narcissa Malfoy here; on the contrary, Harry found he quite liked the woman. He figured that was just what happened when someone saved your life from a psychopathic snake-man.
were the irrational one here. It ought to annoy him. Except it didn’t, not really, because it was really bloody hard to be annoyed with the git when he was smiling like
“If you must know, he spent most of yesterday and this morning seething about this.”
Draco snorted, finally having shaken his momentary daze. “Whatever is the matter? Are the near-death experiences deterring you? Late-night duels with Death Eaters? Nights spent at St. Mungo’s?”
Her eyes were apologetic, but Harry couldn’t help but feel a wave of white-hot disbelief wash over him. Draco had said once that his mother still loved Lucius, even after all he’d done, after how he’d hurt her, hurt
This elicited a small, if slightly hysterical laugh from Harry. But Draco figured it was better than the alternative, better than the unnatural broken look he’d sported for a few moments back in the interviewing room. “No pep talk, then? No ‘come now, Harry, things aren’t that bad, stop acting so pessimistic’?”
Harry’s head snapped up, his eyes widening in surprise.
Harry pulled a face, repressing a groan. Christ this was awkward. “Sorry. You go first.”
Except then Harry’s crooked grin widened, and all of a sudden he took a large step forwards. Draco stepped back instinctively, and immediately cursed himself for it. Salazar, they were
But he needn’t have worried. “My father?” Draco finished, face as grim as his tone. “Yes. Lucius was never a very good father, to put it mildly, and I doubt he was a very good husband, either. Mind you, he never…hit my mum, or insulted her, or anything like that. He simply…never quite learned how to show affection. He was of the firm belief love is a weakness.” The blond scoffed. “But mum loved him anyway. Still does, I think. And I suppose she’d have to, seeing as he’s her soulmate.”
was that when he caught his mind sidling back to the topic of Draco Malfoy, the first emotion he felt was never anger. No, on the contrary, anger and frustration and resentment never so much as made the top five, and Harry
And then a yellow flash illuminated the alleyway, and pain ripped through Harry’s entire body.
There was a long, long pause, in which Draco’s eyes flickered across Harry’s face like two silver flames. For a moment Harry wasn’t sure he’d succeeded in convincing the Slytherin, worried Draco might do something rash.
that immediately had Harry’s heart plummeting again.
Harry could only force a small smile in response. One would think after three years he’d have gotten used to being bombarded by total strangers with attention and compliments and overall glorification—but no, he was still just as uncomfortable with it as before, and thus reacted correspondingly.
The shift in the air was palpable, and Harry didn’t quite know what to do or say as they stood there in awkward silence, a very respectable, appropriate distance in between them. But, for all his usual quick-witted eloquence, Draco didn’t seem to know, either.
Just like that, speeches and racing hearts dropped from the forefront of Harry’s mind.
Even Blaise said gently, warningly, “Draco…”
“Look," Harry said quietly, "I’m sorry I brought up the trials. I…know that was hard for you. It’s just… I really wish I could do something for once and not have to worry about what the whole world thought of it. Ever since I left the Dursleys, it’s been this way, and, well, I know it’s a bit naïve, but I always thought once I’d fulfilled the prophecy and killed Voldemort, things would get…easier.”
after all, and he had so much empathy in him you could probably fill the Great Lake with it.
won’t. And I don’t think you will either, at least not intentionally. But you have met you, right? Your magical control is practically non-existent. All raw power and no restraint.”
Harry pulled back ever so slightly, and Draco followed, although admittedly dismayed their snogging session had ended so abruptly. It was true, he would have loved snogging Harry even if the man were a disastrous kisser—except, as it turned out, he was actually rather brilliant at it. To the point that Draco might just have to thank Ginevra Weasley the next time their paths crossed.
He stopped midsentence, and suddenly, those dark, empty eyes of his went very, very wide.
when you could use your wand?
“Right, so I have absolutely no bloody clue what you’re on about now, but can we just back up to my original question? He’s not as bad as you make him out to be. I think if you gave him another chance—”
Potter’s jaw clenched visibly, and Draco could tell by his tight fists and the rigid set of his shoulders that suppressing his anger was a difficult feat. “And there was nothing else? Nothing at all?”
Draco huffed, satisfied, and threw a pointed look at Harry. “There you have it. That woman is ruthless, don’t be fooled by the dresses and heels.” Not that anyone in their right mind would ever be fooled by Pansy’s skin-tight leather dress and needle-like stilettos anyway.
on the table, concealed from Potter only by a flimsy bit of fabric. He was beginning to panic a bit, his heart already racing in his ribcage, drumming a furious beat.
But Blaise stepped in front of him, blocking his exit. “Good one, Draco, but you aren’t going anywhere. There are still some tests we need to run before you can leave, and Healer Hodkinson—”
However, Harry had just turned twenty. By wizarding law, he’d been an adult for over three years now. And while he certainly didn’t mind being single, Harry at the same time couldn’t quite shake the feeling he was supposed to have
Salazar, the nonchalance with which they spoke about it, about
Draco knew almost better than anyone that Pansy Parkinson was not someone you ought to underestimate. She was smarter than she let on, more ingenious, and much, much more perceptive—all traits of a perfect Slytherin. It was one of the reasons she’d flourished so during their time at Hogwarts.
, and it certainly wasn’t helping protect Harry.”
he set foot in her store like that, she had a

Harry was infinitely glad they'd all managed to get together like this, a sentiment the warm swelling in his chest only reinforced. Everyone was always so busy, himself included—some of them, like Luna and Neville, didn't even live in Britain anymore. So to have this finally happen, to be together once more like this, as though the war had never happened, had never torn them all apart and left them to mend themselves...
Awkward silence filled the room, and Hermione had the decency to look distressed when she realized what exactly it was she’d just said. “God, Harry, I’m sorry. That’s…good lord, that was rather tactless, wasn’t it?”
Because Harry cared quite a lot more about the blond git than he would have ever thought possible, and the idea of not being with him all day, of someone
“Yes, of course,” he answered evenly. “Slip of the tongue.”

“You can’t tell me what to do,” replied Ginny coolly. “I don’t know what you did to make Harry tolerate you, but it’s not going to fool me,
you’re a total snob, you’re
Draco didn’t even have time to draw in a gasp before the door on the other side of the room slammed shut with a definite and resounding bang, and a blast of green erupted from the shadows.
The glower Philomena fixed Potter with was so scathing any lesser man would have collapsed to the floor in a trembling heap of sobs. But Potter, bless his Gryffindor heart, had proven often enough he was not such a man. He stayed standing tall, chin lifted defiantly, eyes blazing.
Harry stared at the Slytherin. “It didn’t cross your mind to remind me of this earlier?”
And before Draco could so much as form another thought, Harry’s lips had crashed against his. At the force of the impact, the blond staggered back another step, and was met with a very hard, very solid wall.
Ron simply waved a dismissive hand, frown still focused on Harry. “Same difference. What I’m trying to say is, mate, I know you're all weirded out by the idea of soulmates, but there's really nothing to worry about.” His face suddenly turned very serious indeed, which really was an odd look on Ron. He reached out for Hermione’s hand, whose frustration in turn promptly melted away. “Me and Mione, we were lucky. But even if I hadn’t met her on the train when we were eleven, I still would have found her one day, and she would have found me. Because we were meant to be together.”
Harry gritted his teeth but obliged, falling silent once again.
Draco stopped midsentence, the words dying on his tongue. Because when Weasley’s dark blue eyes lifted again, there was no anger shining back at Draco, none of the fiery irascibility he’d come to expect.
But then Harry’s face split into a humongous grin, and he laughed, “I know one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but you practically inhaling a mug of Butterbeer not only with extra cream, but
. He was wearing a pair of dark trousers, nothing like the worn jeans he usually always sported, but instead far more form-fitting and sophisticated. And although the outfit alone made him look so much more polished, it wasn’t it that captured Draco’s attention.
“I mean just that,” Narcissa answered. “A message was slipped into his copy of the Daily Prophet a few days ago, telling him that if he told you anything, he’d regret it.”
Draco snorted. “Why am I standing in your kitchen, baking a chocolate cake with a muggle device from hell that seems intent on taking off my fingers?”
“Mr. Potter?
“Allegedly,” replied Harry calmly. “He might, or he might not. Maybe Yaxley’s accomplice is just overly paranoid. You heard your mother; Lucius’ mind isn’t the same as it was before he was incarcerated. Perhaps he did know something once but forgot it over time.” He intertwined their fingers again. “You can’t beat yourself up over this. Lucius isn’t going to tell us anything anyway. The best we can do now is go to Robards with the information we do have, and otherwise stay alert. Okay?”
So he said, “Where’re they keeping him now? They do have him in custody, right?”
“Not to mention,” Draco continued, ignoring them both, “where the fuck is Granger? Because she certainly wasn’t where she was supposed to be, was she? Otherwise this could have very well been avoided. It was
Nic’s eyes swivelled to Draco and narrowed, and it would have been impossible for anyone, even Potter, to not feel the sudden change in the air, the coldness in the American’s gaze as they took in Draco. But Draco refused to avert his eyes, to back off and admit defeat. If he hadn’t cowered for Philomena Craigs, he certainly would not now.
Nic watched him, eyes like two empty, frozen sheets of ice. It was then that two separate realisations hit Harry with about as much subtlety as the Hogwarts Express at full speed:
“But I didn’t. Whoever did this, they didn’t succeed.” His gaze flitted to Malfoy, who still stood by the door, as still and as tense as a statue, grey eyes fixed on Harry. “Malfoy found me, and Apparated me here before anything bad could happen. So, really, there’s no need to get worked up about it, Mione.”
, he found his jaw clenching painfully, eyes narrowing into slits.
Now, Harry had been kissed plenty times before, and had done plenty of kissing in return. To be honest, that’s all he and Ginny had done at the beginning of their relationship, when the intensity of it all was still red-hot and blazing, new and untested; they’d stolen away to some quiet, dark corner of the castle where no one and nothing would find them, a blundering mess of lips and teeth and clumsy fingers like teenagers so often were. And Harry’d enjoyed it at the time, sure, but it’d been more experimental than anything, more fumbling and messy than intense and passionate.
When, a full minute later, Malfoy still hadn’t answered, Harry turned back around again, already frowning. But then he took one look at Malfoy’s indisputably comical expression and couldn’t suppress a slight laugh. The Slytherin, in his pristine black suit and expertly tousled silver blond hair, fit with the look of Harry’s apartment about as well as a stray dog in a five-star hotel. He looked about that comfortable standing there, surrounded by Gryffindor colours, as well.
!” she exclaimed, withdrawing just enough to level an especially scathing glare at Harry, the type that had even Draco wincing from across the room. “Do you have
He gaped. “
Harry ducked his head and started across the pub, and although Draco wanted to say something as the Gryffindor passed, reach out for his arm and apologize for getting carried away—he didn’t. He let Harry go, and followed him dutifully, chin high, shoulders tense, silent as they walked through the pub, out the door and into the cooler air outside.
This stranger wanted to hurt him, potentially kill him.
He knocked again.
talk to me,” the Gryffindor said. “You
Draco really didn’t mind them one bit.
Something about the figure felt off, and so Harry slipped into the shadows as well and followed the figure down the unusually empty street, wand all the while drawn, footsteps so quiet they were near-silent. He kept his distance at first, but then the figure veered into a narrow alleyway, and Harry took a second to curse his bad luck, but then hastened to follow.
But there was no need, for Draco simply sighed and said, “Okay, yes, Weasley, you made your point. I was awful to you—there, I admit it. Granted, you were equally awful to me and
The next few moments happened in slow motion, as though the world had come to an abrupt stop, paused, and then started turning again, slowly at first, but then quicker, and quicker, and quicker, until everything was spinning, until the dark cell walls blended into one shade of black and Yaxley’s pallid, frail form was all Draco could make out in the haze.
,” exclaimed Ron and jumped up from his seat, and Harry immediately followed his example, ignoring the ensuing screech that was wood on wood.
And then it hit him.
Harry stared up at Draco, and finally, there it was, a name for that ‘something’ he’d been feeling all day, that pesky little ‘something’ he’d found kicking about in his chest so many times before when he looked to Draco, when he found the Slytherin smiling at a joke he’d made or discussing some German potioneer whose work he was a fan of, or even just sitting by the fireplace in his designated armchair, reading with that adorable little crinkle between his eyebrows.
But Pansy simply chuckled. “That I liked blokes? Surely you’re not that small-minded. I’m
Draco gave a dark laugh. “
life—”
“Fine.” Malfoy flicked his wand once, and within the blink of an eye his dragon-hide boots had appeared on his feet. “But if you get yourself killed—”
Pansy caught the newspaper and skimmed the front page, dark eyebrows immediately lifting sky-high. Blaise peeked over her shoulder, and his mouth almost instantly formed a grim line.
about the whole situation?—but then that damn letter had arrived and Potter had looked like he might just burst with joy. The nutter couldn’t be inside for a day.
The date.
“It’s not about changing your past mistakes, Malfoy,” Harry said, uncertain why he felt so strongly compelled to do so. “It’s about getting rid of all that guilt you so clearly still harbour.”
Harry grimaced at the reminder. He knew he’d fucked up when it came to Ginny but, save for one especially heated lecture directly after the breakup, Ron had to the most part stayed out of it, much to Harry’s eternal gratitude. Ron wasn’t one to hold grudges for long, so Harry had thought himself pardoned for the entire issue.
“I know!”
The resulting silence was so laden with tension even Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat across the table, emerald eyes shifting nervously between the other two men. However, Draco only noted this out of the corner of his eye, for his gaze was still interlocked with that of Nic, waiting for the latter to break eye contact. After all, Draco was certainly not going to do it. Backing down now was simply out of question.
? Really? And don’t even get me started on ‘Hogwarts’. Who the hell came up with that one?”
There was a long pause, and Harry stared at Draco and Draco stared at Harry, and then the Slytherin’s eyes widened and he was shaking his head with such vigour it sent another few strands of blond falling into his eyes.
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion. Was it that obvious? No, it couldn’t be, because the obvious answer would’ve been homophobia, which was clearly not the case here. Harry thought about all the times he’d had the misfortune to witness an encounter between the two of them, remembered that very first altercation between Nic and Draco at the pub, or the day Nic had come over with his beignets to apologise, or earlier today—
, the disappointment therein, the sadness, the utter
Instantly, fact after fact after fact went racing through Draco’s head, none of which did anything to calm his sprinting heart; Moonroot, a perennial flowering plant native to North America, known also as Banshee’s Glove or simply the Death Flower, with snow-white petals and vivid red berries, the former of which are used in many dark potions. Highly poisonous to animals and humans alike, and ultimately also quite fatal.
engraved in his wrist—after all, the single letter only ever turned into a full name if there were, err, feelings there—Potter would likely still find a
Draco threw himself to the side just in time, and the Killing Curse hit the wall behind him, ripping the mint-green wallpaper apart where it collided. He swore and rolled behind the desk just as another curse hit the spot where he’d stood mere seconds before.
There was a moment of silence.
Draco snorted. “Good to see you too, Blaise.”
Pity.
And then stopped dead in his tracks when he walked in on a glaring-contest between Draco and, much to Harry’s surprise, Nic. Which is to say, Draco was sitting in his usual armchair, back ramrod straight, glowering at the brunet as though he were some deformed cross of a flobberworm and a fire slug, while Nic just stood by the fireplace, awkwardly clutching a little basket, expression caught somewhere between dislike and pure discomfort.
The door swept open, and one moment Harry was standing in front of a large, imposing door, hand lifted and only millimetres away from the wood, the next he was standing face-to-face with one equally, if not more imposing Draco Malfoy, who was very decidedly
“They do,” Nic assured him. “Four of them, just like Hogwarts. Wampus, Thunderbird, Horned Serpent and Pukwudgie. And before you say anything, trust me, I’m well-aware how silly the names are. I was Pukwudgie, so believe me when I say I’ve heard it all.”
morphed into the name
. “Come now, hiding’s no fun. Step out where I can see you, so that we might have a civilised conversation as two equally civilised adults.”
It wasn’t that he didn’t want kids, nor that he didn’t think himself capable of raising an actual human being, temper tantrums and all. On the contrary, he knew he could do it, might even enjoy it.
“Oh well,” Blaise answered with a shrug, although judging by his humongous grin he wasn’t all too dispirited. “I suppose in the grand scheme of things another few days is nothing.”
And so when he pulled back, breathless and grinning so wide it hurt, he didn’t think twice before saying, “I love you.”
Draco glanced at him, and it could have easily been the dark confusing his senses, but Harry would have sworn the Slytherin smiled ever so slightly. “Apparating you home, of course.”
But now Draco looked at Harry, and he knew he’d fucked up. So. Bloody. Bad.
. Robards’s off trying to identify Yaxley’s accomplice. Thinks they’re the ones to have broken him out this time around, too. He’ll be busy the rest of the day.”
Parvati pulled a grimace, shooting a glare first at Lavender, then Harry. Everyone laughed, including, Harry noted, Draco (why he noticed he really couldn’t say, it wasn’t like he was staring at the man or anything). Although the Slytherin was clearly trying to hide his smile, his lips curled up at the sides, nonetheless. It was rather endearing, actually. In a very normal, non-attractive sort of way.
Harry wasn’t sure whether she was being sarcastic or genuinely sweet. She was a Slytherin through and through, so most likely the latter. Except, somewhere along the line, Harry had grown to like the illustrious Pansy Parkinson, spiky words and even spikier heels included. She reminded him of both Hermione and Ginny, if Hermione were meaner and blunter, and Ginny were…well, more Slytherin.
die. Seems I was wrong.”
? For Christ’s sake, he and Draco had only just gotten together, how was Harry already imagining them married and with
Oh shit.
Yet it was his calculating Slytherin eye that immediately took in every single detail of the room, however tiny and trivial it may seem, and immediately relaxed when he realized that, no, there were no murderous Death Eaters lurking behind the door or hiding in the curtains, poised to attack.
And, oh, didn’t that make his heart sing.
Harry had no choice but to follow.
Despite his better judgement, Draco was now curious. “I doubt that. What is it? Out with it.”
! And it didn’t matter that he’d only done so mentally, it didn’t matter that Draco hadn’t heard, that he didn’t know what traitorous,
. It had an intensity to it Harry had never felt before, and he loved it more than words could possibly describe.
“It’s just…,” Potter said. “About your soulmark.”
Harry nodded uncertainly, not knowing how else to react without running the risk of being torn to pieces by those sharp white teeth of Parkinson’s, both figuratively and not. “Err, thanks. I’ll…think about it.”
“Bloody goddamn piece of fucking
When everyone had left and it was only Harry, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy left in the hallway, Hermione frowned and said, “Look, Harry, I know you don’t like this. None of us do. But Malfoy’s here to make sure that, if you ever do let your guard down, it doesn’t result in your death. That doesn’t mean anyone is undermining your competence, or saying you aren’t skilled enough to defend yourself. It’s just like Robards said; everyone needs a bit of help every once in a while. So, promise me you’ll comply to the agreement? That you’ll stay with Malfoy at all times, even if he irritates you?”
Oh, bloody hell.
He’d done very well indeed the past few years avoiding Potter, even though they both worked as Aurors in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and their paths were bound to cross every once in a while. He’d done so, so well to keep his head down and only ever give a stiff nod if their eyes met across the hallway.
“What can I say,” Harry said, hoping to lighten the mood. “He may be a giant arsehole, but at least he can bake.”
“Little sister,” Ginny repeated, and the fact that he couldn’t read her expression worried Harry more than her previous harshness or unrepressed anger ever could.
friends, and Granger even
And that knowledge alone gave him the necessary surge of courage to pull himself together and
Something inside Harry burst at those words, at the tenderness behind them, the fear. Because that’s what Draco was, wasn’t it—he was afraid, afraid Harry wouldn’t want him, afraid he, Draco Malfoy, wasn’t good enough after all.
And perhaps it was due to this or simply because the stress had finally gotten to Draco and peeled away one layer too many of his self-discipline, so meticulously crafted through years and years of self-imposed constraint. Whatever it was, Draco found himself once again feeling the urge to hold Harry tight, to cling to him and never let go.
like any normal person would have done by now.
Malfoy was silent as they traversed the hospital, gaze trained on the white floor below as they marched towards the exit. Once they were in the lobby, Harry turned to face the Slytherin and said, “Side-Along?”
—he also knew it would only end badly.
Harry gave a sympathetic frown. “That’s the best we can hope for, though, isn’t it? To get better, however long it may take. All of us.”
What a bloody stupid, reckless, suicidal fucking Gryffindor, Draco thought and opened his mouth to say as much. Or tried to—he appeared to have lost all feel in his face quite a few seconds ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry simply raised an eyebrow.
“It’s a rock on a needle in your ear,” Draco huffed. “Hardly anything special. Plus, if it’s the diamond you’re proud of, I’ll have you know my mother has rings with gems ten times the size, not to mention a hundred times the value.” His tone was brusque. But his cheeks were pink.
Silence.
“Good,” the voice continued. “Now lift your hands up where I can see them, and back away slowly.”
An incredulous laugh sounded (probably Pansy), and Harry’s mouth set into a tight frown. It was hard to keep his voice level as he answered, “Yes, well, I’m afraid you just missed them. They were here an hour ago but left to spend some quality time with the newest Weasley. Roxanne was born just the other day, in case you haven’t heard.”
However, as he glanced once over his shoulder only to find Draco looking deathly pale, Harry’s thoughts came to an abrupt pause. The Slytherin’s mouth was set in a hard line, and his entire body was tense to the point that he looked like a statue. But all it took was one look at his eyes, filled with an ever-churning mixture of dread, panic and…
But Harry simply continued calmly, “No more truces.” He took three great big steps forwards, until he stood directly in front of Draco, whose grey eyes went wide. “I know you’re a Slytherin, but the real world doesn’t have truces. In the real world, people have friends.” And, with that, Harry raised his right hand and stretched it towards Draco. “So. How about it, Malfoy? Friends?”
“Maybe you—” Draco stopped midsentence and cleared his throat, and when Harry chanced a quick glance at the Slytherin’s face, he was surprised to find it flushed as well. “Maybe you could move a bit? You’re, err, blocking the way.”
Or at least Weasley did. If Draco weren’t at that moment so preoccupied with his boyfriend, he might have laughed at the Weasel’s truly comical expression.
And although, technically speaking, Draco was the one doing the protecting, Harry couldn’t help but feel oddly obligated to offer the blond, silver-eyed Slytherin the same courtesy.
‘Why, that I’ve been in love with you since we were eleven, of course’?
With Blaise leading him, they made their way across the room, and then they were out in a hallway, walking past white, white walls that seemed to stretch on for miles, caging Draco in, past faceless people in equally white robes who rushed along without so much as a glance towards the two Slytherins.
“So it’s true then?” This time, it was Ron who spoke, looking sickly pale, so much so that every single one of his freckles stood out like stars in the night sky. “Malfoy really didn’t try to kill you? He…he saved your life?”
And so, he hovered there awkwardly as Granger, Weasley and Potter conversed in hushed tones, every so often throwing blatant glances over at Draco, only to then turn back around and start whispering all the more vehemently.
Draco still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around all that had happened. But there was exactly one thing he knew for certain: Harry Potter was calling Draco by his first name, and, moreover,
Draco pulled a face, but secretly, he found a small, nameless weight slipping from his shoulders. “
Once the Head Auror was gone, all eyes of Potter’s friends shifted to Draco, most of which were narrowed and looking far from pleased. Usually, pissing off so many Gryffindors at once would have made Draco’s day. But today wasn’t a usual sort of day.
Oh, right,
Again, thank you so much for reading!! Feedback is always appreciated!
“Wankers, the both of you,” he grumbled. “I never should have asked you to come.”
“No,” he bit out. “I have to get back to—”
Potter simply huffed, throwing his hands up in frustration. “If they love me so much, then why can’t they bloody well leave me be for five minutes?
The former Slytherin’s head snapped up, sending strands of her black bob tumbling into her face, which she promptly flicked away, a small scowl having already overtaken her face, much like the seemingly permanent one she’d always worn in Hogwarts—at least whenever Harry had the misfortune to cross her path.
Harry started spluttering indignantly, but Pansy just laughed.
It was a very reasonable idea indeed, in Harry’s opinion. Besides, the last assassination attempt had been quiet and out of the blue, so he doubted whoever was after him was going to try their luck with a handful of Aurors by his side at every step of the way, all on high alert. Plus, Harry now knew to be especially careful, whereas the poisoning had occurred when he’d had his guard down and least expected it.
Immediately, both Harry and Ginny’s eyes snapped to Draco, who stood behind Harry, arms crossed, eyes narrowed as he took in Ginny.
But before that could happen, Harry cleared his throat. The tension didn’t disappear, not at all, but it was as though even it paused for Harry Potter. Draco found himself instinctively glancing towards the messy-haired Gryffindor, breaking eye contact with the other man, feeling instantly reminded of all the mealtimes he’d find himself unintentionally looking over to the Gryffindor table back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. But just as quickly, he realized his mistake, and Draco scowled, whirling back to face the stranger. Yet, thankfully, or perhaps not, the man’s gaze was on Harry as well.
It was barely audible, more a few panicked gulps of air than actual words, but Blaise, bless him, understood without problem.
“Sorry, what was that?” asked Blaise, suddenly the picture of virtue and innocence.
“No,” Harry sighed, lips still twitching. “I just find your constant dramatics amusing, is all. You really ought to have considered becoming an actor. I could ask Lavender to introduce you to a few directors, if you want.”
Hope everyone enjoyed this little pre-Christmas present xD
we are
Harry chuckled. “No, me neither.”
Since then, Harry liked to think he’d gotten a lot more skilled in that department. Granted, he had less relationship experience than most everyone else he knew, but he was rather certain that was partially due to the fact that he was Harry Potter, the man with a hundred useless titles, not because he was as undateable as a potato.
After about five minutes of Draco tapping his foot, hands clasped tightly around his steaming mug of coffee (three sugars and two dollops of cream—not that Harry had memorised it or anything), grey eyes fixed on the floor, on the carpet, on the red wall behind Harry’s head—everywhere, really, but
At least it wasn’t him in the hospital bed this time, he mused, and immediately grimaced. Wow, okay, bad phrasing.
As in, 24/7, round the clock, day and night.
Draco looked incredulously between the two. He opened his mouth. But then he shook his head, deciding it was better to give up than make any more of a fool of himself than he already had. “You know what, I’m not even going to ask. Have fun with your bizarre muggle topics. Oh, and Weasley—” The redhead was in the process of shoving about half a piece of cake in his mouth at once, and when he looked up, startled, some crumbs fell out. Draco grimaced. “—do try not to eat the entire cake. That much sugar is bound to make even you sick, and that is one thing I
Harry burst into laughter, and the sound was as beautiful as it was infective, and soon Draco found himself chuckling as well, unable to look away from the bright twinkle in the Gryffindor’s eyes.
that the two of you stay with him at all times, that he not leave the flat, not under
But, hell, if it kept busybodies like Jennings away, then bring it on.
“Damn,” Harry said and grimaced, looking sufficiently cowed. “I didn’t think of that.”
Thank you so much for reading the first few chapters of "no need to panic"...there's a lot more to come! Feel free to comment or leave kudos if you've liked the story so far.
Perfect.
Apparently oblivious to the tension between the two Aurors and Draco, Potter said happily, “Guess what, Malfoy, Jennings here is a potions-genius, too! He spent two years apprenticing under some big-name potions Master in Germany before coming back here to become an Auror. To be honest, Malfoy, I always thought you might do that; become a potions Master, you know, like Snape. All grumpy and mysterious and anti-Gryffindor.” He chuckled. “You were certainly good enough for it.”
When, again, no answer came, spoken or otherwise, not even the rustling of paper or the squeaking of a chair—that’s when Draco began to get truly suspicious. Wes, Robards’ secretary, had assured Draco just minutes before that Robards was in his office, sorting through paperwork. He’d even buzzed up to let the Head Auror know Draco was there, to which Robards had responded simply ‘send him on up’.
Lavender looked mildly (read: massively) disappointed, and Parvati still appeared as though every milliliter of blood in her entire body had flooded to her face, and Harry had to chuckle at the comical look of abject humiliation etched into his friend’s expression.
. With the likes of you.”
The Slytherin slowly traversed the room, never letting his guard down despite the office’s apparent emptiness. During his years as an Auror, he had witnessed one too many close calls to ever do that, and the hairs at the back of his neck still stood on end, that restless, writhing feeling in his gut telling him to stay alert, keep an eye out,
And before Yaxley could even open is mouth again, Draco flicked his wand once, and thick ropes bound themselves around Yaxley’s wrists and legs. The Death Eater gave an enraged outcry and tried to wriggle free, but in return the ropes only tightened.
“I did warn him,” came the woman’s voice again, sounding a mixture of weary and vexed.
Draco knew the instant he’d uttered those words that he was a dead man, and, indeed, Hermione’s glare became feral.
Draco led the way into the kitchen, and at first Harry didn’t even notice the smell, too preoccupied with the unruly jumble of mush that had become his mind as of late. However, the tangy, aromatic scent of curry was not something easily ignored, and so by the time Draco had come to a stop in front of the kitchen counter, where multiple paper bags contained mountains upon mountains of stacked takeout-boxes, Harry realised just what it was he was seeing.
It wasn’t anymore.
Because knowing Robards wanted to see him for some mysterious reason regarding the case was bad enough. However, having to
But damn if it didn’t make Draco want to kiss him.
Draco glared at his so-called friend and wrenched his arm out of Blaise’s grip, silently glad when he didn’t immediately collapse. “I sincerely doubt you saved my life. You don’t even have your license yet.”
Ron looked completely torn, eyes wide, hair a mess as he raked his hands through it, gaze jumping from Harry to the fireplace and back. “Blimey, Harry, I can’t just leave you here, what if Yaxley—”
. In the past week, we’ve become rather good friends, wouldn’t you say? I mean, obviously not best friends or anything, because I know that’s Granger and Weasley for you, and I have Pansy and Blaise, and that’s fine. Cool. Great, really. But…friends. You and I.” He exhaled through his nose, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen the Slytherin so flustered. It was…unnerving, to say the least. “What I’m trying to say is we’ve come rather far from our Hogwarts rivalry. I don’t hate you anymore, and I’m almost certain the feeling’s mutual. As a matter of fact, I quite like you. You’re… Hmm.”
It was likely just a lie, Draco knew that—a trick, just a way for Yaxley to toy with them, to get them to believe he had some sort of plan, some sort of secret weapon yet to be unleashed. Draco knew this.
. An actual, genuine, real-life compliment, from Potter, to him, Draco Malfoy. It must have, for Draco hadn’t been able to hear any undercurrents of sarcasm in the Gryffindor’s voice, and he didn’t think the man capable of such a Slytherin thing as subtle insults.
“Hmm?” repeated Draco, one eyebrow lifted questioningly. And, yes, alright, he knew he really shouldn’t be taking such pleasure in this, in watching Harry squirm, not when the Gryffindor could not be more evidently uncomfortable. But he was, after all, still a Slytherin at heart, so really, who could blame him?
“Secondly,” he continued, “what do you mean, ‘Yaxley’s murder’? He’s dead?”
But he wouldn’t, and so Harry reached up and tilted the other man’s chin until he had no choice
Harry quickly forced himself to swallow his own surprise. So he’d just caught Draco red-handed in the complicated process of baking what appeared to be a chocolate cake. So the Slytherin, who had never once wasted an opportunity to make fun of Harry’s taste in fashion—or lack thereof—was currently wearing a pale pink apron with flowers stitched into it. So what? It was fine. All of it. Just fine. Not a big deal at all.
He’d just shut his eyes what felt like minutes ago when there was a loud knock on the door, effectively wrenching Harry from whatever half-slumber he’d been suspended in until seconds before. Draco, who’d been busy creating a list of events leading up to Yaxley’s murder, jerked so violently Harry almost fell face-first off the couch since he’d been using the Slytherin’s lap as a makeshift pillow.
Immediately, a scowl overtook Draco’s face. “Tell him what, Pansy? I only just managed to befriend the man literally ten minutes ago, and now you want me to tell him we’re apparently soulmates? How well do you think that’d go over?”
Harry flushed, but it was Draco who nearly spewed an entire mouthful of tea all over the table as he stared up at Blaise with plain, horrified shock. He wanted to be angry, or accusing, and he knew both those emotions would arise eventually. But at the moment all he could do was stare and hope Harry was too busy stammering out a response to notice Draco’s dread.
Draco felt the overwhelming urge to either faceplant or, once again, smother the idiot in kisses—but, by some miracle, he managed to restrain himself, if only just barely.
Harry sat up, too, his own wand in hand, and they both went very still, waiting. But then there was another knock, accompanied by a voice, muffled through the wood but still very much familiar.
. We’ve been out an hour already, and I’ve been neither poisoned nor assaulted. So tone down the worry, will you? Otherwise I’ll have to start thinking you
A look of complete bewilderment overtook Blaise’s face at that, and Draco groaned into his hands. He should have stayed the fuck at home with his cosy pyjamas and sappy book and delicious chocolates. Harry Potter was always—
Perhaps Nic realised just what it was Harry was pondering, for he then said, “Unfortunately though,
, recoiling ever so slightly at the sound of his voice, inching towards the fireplace as though she might like to jump in and Floo far, far away from this flat.
an overcautious pessimist, and an Auror on top of that. He knew what he’d felt—that had been Yaxley’s hand around Draco’s ankle, he was sure of it. And so, he did not breathe a sigh of relief, nor did he drop his wand or let down his guard. Draco waited, eyes trained on the fireplace, ignoring the sound of Philomena Craigs’ shouting, of her shrill voice demanding he leave at once, how
Well, Harry thought defeatedly, at least that’s a first.
Draco had known from the moment he’d stopped considering their relationship an alliance and instead let it turn into an actual
The other Gryffindors looked up to, and Harry was frowning slightly as he studied Draco. Draco immediately stiffened, alarmed, only to then chide himself for it. There was no way Harry would be able to see through the mask Draco had perfected over the course of most of his life; Harry, the oblivious Gryffindor who likely hadn’t even noticed his ex-girlfriend glowering at Draco as though he were the very bane of her existence. There was simply no way.
“Yes,” Harry insisted firmly. “Yes, I do. Like it or not, Draco, I know you a lot better than you might care to admit.” He shook his head. “I know you’re neither cruel nor vindictive nor cold-hearted. You’re not even mean, not really, not in your core. I know how you like your coffee, and that you bake when you’re stressed, and that you’d sleep until noon if I didn’t wake you up beforehand. I know that you care about people and protect those you love with a passion, that you can’t help but feel responsible for your mother even though you’re doing the best you can. That you’re just as broken and scared as the rest of us—but at the end of the day, you’re a survivor.” He looked up into those startling silver eyes and said, “I know you better than I do most people, Draco, so believe me when I say you’re
Blaise wasn’t fazed. “You have to promise first.”
So, he’d made a decision. After all, it was high time he took matters into his own hands. Even though Draco had fought against Voldemort in that final battle, it still did not accost for everything that had been done. That
alive, right?” came Yaxley’s cold voice again, wrenching Draco back to reality. The man sounded amused, if such an emotion was even possible with such a shrivelled, pitch-black heart.
Pansy’s eyes sparkled with mirth and something much more sadistic, and Draco was afraid she’d say something uncalled for. But he needn’t have worried; instead of taunting Harry, she sighed softly and said, tone much gentler, “Look, Potter. Penelope’s my soulmate, it’s true. But she has a girlfriend. A fiancée, to be precise, as of a few weeks ago. And I’m happy for them.
Anywho, enjoy chapter 10!
“Don’t be daft, Draco. Of course you do.”
Draco looked, even under the harsh lighting, even with the dirty clothes, even with the enormous dark circles hanging under his strikingly silver eyes. Despite everything, he looked rather ethereal, sort of like Harry imagined a fallen angel must look—hell, perhaps even
Something twisted in Harry’s gut.
As he passed Potter, who, judging by the murderous glint in his eye, had not yet managed to swallow down his rage, Draco took pity on the Gryffindor, and he said quietly, “Let it be, Potter. We have all we need. Let’s…let’s go home, yeah?”
you’d keep an eye on him. Make sure he stayed safely at the flat, safe and sound and
Before any further bitter thoughts regarding Harry being kicked off his own case could find their way into his mind, Harry busied himself retrieving a plate from the cupboard, ladling it with what was left of the fried rice.
“Three words, Potter: Pot. Kettle. Black.”
Robards didn’t look pleased, but his scowl had eased up slightly, and he nodded as well. “Good. Now that that’s settled, I really must be off.” He glanced at Potter. “Don’t rush the recovery, understand, Potter? You’re no use to anyone dead.” And with that, he turned on his heel, strode past Draco with a minuscule nod, and disappeared out the door.
“I—” began Weasley, and Draco thought the redhead might honestly put up a fight. Fucking Gryffindors. But then he paused, and, expression tortured, glanced over at Harry. Draco’s gaze followed.
wrong, and he gripped his wand tighter, preparing for the worst. Except Yaxley remained on the floor, unmoving and bound. As a matter of fact, the man had gone entirely still, unnaturally so, and he shut his mouth, the flood of insults coming to a sudden and abrupt stop.
you show your face in this shop at all anymore, boy, when you’re no better than a filthy mudblood yourself! Insolent and fickle, going against all your father stood for—”
Honestly, Ron, you really should have seen this coming.
But Draco surprised everyone, Harry included, when he replied, “I agree. Especially living here, since Potter obviously has no idea how to obtain a decent meal if it’s not delivered directly to his doorstep by a muggle food delivery service—which, mind you, I hardly think should be described as a ‘decent’ meal.”
, that’s how red this apartment is. It’s wrong, you hear me?
relieved the schoolyear’s over.”
Either way, Draco thought, what a moron.
The war was over. It was high time they stopped behaving otherwise.
Philomena. On second thought, Draco mused, it was highly probable the shopkeeper wouldn’t even allow Potter to set foot in her store, not as a known half-blood with muggle ties.
Weasley shook his head. “I know, okay?” he said wearily. “I
Pansy merely nodded. “Absolutely, dear.”
Harry (and Draco, he noted out of the corner of his eye) perked up at that. “Really? A sighting? In Knockturn?”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at that. “Why, the poor man would have a heart attack.”
mirrored in Draco’s eyes as he studied Harry, sort of like apprehension and fear mixed all up in one.
Stuck-up, too—don’t think that’s ever going to change—plus self-important as all hell, and—” He stopped, then grimaced. “And I should probably shut up now, shouldn’t I?”
Draco couldn’t suppress a smile as his idiot boyfriend—his idiot, excruciatingly
Suffice to say, it hadn’t quite worked out that way.
. In all honesty, Harry liked most things about Draco.
now than the rest of us…I guess there’s no use, is there?”
And this time it wasn’t Harry alone who chuckled and smiled, and that fact made Harry burst with both joy and pride for Draco at how far he’d come.
, Potter.”
Yeah, no, who was he kidding, it totally was.
Bloody
Harry shook his head, at which not only Seamus, but almost everyone at the table visibly deflated. Everyone except Luna, that is, who said cheerily, “Unpredictable, soulmarks are. Some of them like creating suspense, you can’t fault them for it.”
Noting Draco’s very genuine, very deep-rooted fear, Blaise’s grin softened. “No one. I made certain of it. The undressing and re-dressing part was a bit of a problem, not to mention the actual healing procedure, but I managed to put a temporary Disillusionment Charm on the mark long enough that none of the healers working on you saw. So, there’s no need to worry. Your secret’s safe.”
And so, when said figure suddenly came to an abrupt stop, paused for a second and then whirled around to face Harry, wand drawn and pointed directly at his face—well, at least Harry didn’t miss the moment his wand was wrenched out of his hand and flung across the alleyway.
Yet as he barrelled into the kitchen, every single one of those numerous, well-thought-out plans evaporated in thin air when faced with the sight that awaited him there. Harry had encountered many a mindboggling situation in his life. He had come to expect the unexpected, predict the unpredictable. He had thought nothing could surprise him anymore, not after the war and Auror training directly afterwards.
Blaise was standing beside him, Harry noticed, looking worried. And rightfully so—the typically so put-together blond looked absolutely horrendous. His hair was the messiest Harry had ever seen it, and his robes were actually ruined, that’s how dirty and torn they were. But that wasn’t what made Harry’s chest tighten in worry; it was the look in Draco’s eyes that did it, like someone had died, and that pain was so stark Harry could almost feel it himself.
To his right, Harry shifted on his feet, knuckles white from where his hands clutched the back of the iron chair he was supposed to be sitting on. Draco’s heart twisted at the sight, at the frown set deep into Harry’s usually so golden skin, now reduced to a grey sort of pallor that made his eyes duller, less emerald and more mossy green. He was still beautiful, of course—Draco doubted anything could ever change that. But the nervousness coating his features was unmistakable, and it made Draco sick, because this was Harry Potter, for fuck’s sake, he didn’t
Harry only dimly noted how Draco hadn’t, in fact, apologized for his own behaviour on Tuesday evening, too utterly flummoxed by the man’s sudden change of heart. And, okay, yes, wary, too. Because, to put it simply, what the actual fuck was happening.
Another deep breath. One problem at a time.
He wasn’t entirely sure what he’d expected to happen, to be honest. Harry truly did believe Malfoy had changed—after all, the war had changed them all—and although he was certainly still an arrogant, contemptuous little arsehole, it wasn’t like Harry expected to be murdered in his sleep. Err, not by Malfoy, that is.
“Head Auror Robards,” Harry said in surprise, and inclined his head in greeting. “What are you doing here, sir?”
Harry stared at the Slytherin, incredulous. “Why not? It makes sense for you to be there. If you can manage to get the owner to talk, we’ll be a hell of a lot wiser than we are now. The sooner we find out who did this, the sooner it’ll all be over, and we can both go back to our lives. Isn’t that what you want? Stop being ‘stuck with me’?”
But Draco didn’t budge. Quite the contrary; he took a step closer, until he loomed rather menacingly over Harry, one hand sprawled on the table, one on the back of Harry’s chair. Which was just brilliant. Lovely, really. After all, it wasn’t like the bloody height difference was bad enough when they were standing.
As always, kudos and comments are immensely appreciated!
One look at the grin still stretching across Blaise’s face and the twinkle in his eyes, and Draco only snorted, whacking Blaise on the arm. “Prick. We’ll see how well
Harry much preferred this one anyway.
The woman’s nostrils flared, eyes like blazing coals, illuminated with pure loathing. “How
Draco was still shocked by this newest revelation about his mother, and he breathed, “Can I… I should go see her. I should—” He started past Blaise, but the other man’s hands quickly settled on Draco’s arms, effectively stopping him once again from running out the door.
argue with anything Harry said.
not. He sounded like a bloody wanna-be therapist, for Merlin’s sake!
and are just
So how was it then that, while Yaxley was the one chained up, caged in a room of metal and iron and magic, a man who’d spend the rest of his life in Azkaban with no one and nothing but Dementors to keep him company—how was it that Draco was the one who felt exposed?
. Forgive you, I mean. He’s come to like you quite a lot, to tell you the truth, and that’s more than good enough for me. So, I’ll tell you this now with complete honesty, and you can make of it what you will.”
“You do release what’s at stake here, right? Let me remind you: this is Harry’s life you’re trifling with. His
“Right then.
, I can see that. But why are you doing it in my kitchen?”
, mate. Sure, Fleur and Bill’s wedding was great, minus the whole Death-Eater-attack-thing, but me and Mione don’t want to get married
Draco’s smile widened.
Especially when Draco Malfoy had gone and
He offered Hermione a smile of his own. “I’m very sorry, Hermione, but I’m afraid I must get going now. It seems I have some work to do.”
Yaxley chuckled, and the unnatural sound was accompanied by another bang of green light, making Draco wince despite himself. “No, of course he is. Silly me. I’d have heard, if not. You understand, I had to ask—after all, my accomplice is quite unpredictable.”
Draco huffed a silent laugh…and immediately regretted it when his bruised stomach gave a sharp stab of pain in protest. But he couldn’t help it—Merlin, Philomena would have a heart attack if she could see the state her precious shop was in now.
“No,” Harry insisted. “No, it’s not silly at all. You said the other day that you were worried about her, too. Is she sick? Or is it because of…” Harry trailed off, not entirely sure Draco would want him to finish that sentence.
This, it had to be just another attempt to rile Draco up. Yes, he decided, that was it. Get him panicked and flustered so that Yaxley could catch him off guard.
Harry offered a forced smile in response. He was regretting more and more with every passing second having picked such a public location for his birthday dinner. The pub was filled to the brim, and he could at all times feel the weight of expectant eyes pressing into his back. More than a few times, he’d caught people at neighbouring table whispering excitedly, throwing glances towards him.
“And Apparated you here, to St. Mungo’s,” Malfoy finished, looking annoyed. “Yes, yes, Potter, do keep up.”
Hermione pursed her lips slightly. She didn’t answer at first, and Harry was beginning to think she wouldn’t at all, until she asked, “Has your opinion of Malfoy…changed any, over the past couple days? After all, he’s with you all the time, plus I can imagine going through an ordeal like yesterday might make you…consider him in a different light.” Harry had abso-bloody-lutely no clue what to answer to
Weasley snorted. “I’ll say.”
it wasn’t a request,” Potter growled. Draco was surprised at how measured his voice was, for, while the man was clearly livid, it was a far cry from the anger-prone Gryffindor he’d grown up knowing. “You will answer the questions, or we can bring you in right now to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Mrs. Craigs, and have you questioned there under Veritaserum. But, I should warn you, things will be a lot less pleasant for you if you decide to go with option number two. We may only be ‘a bunch of sanctimonious half-bloods’, but we’re still Aurors and can easily arrest you for hindering an investigation, not to mention saying all those not only vile, but also incredibly incriminating things you just said. So. An answer.
He started cackling, and a shudder of pure disgust ran down Draco’s spine as he stood over the man whose pitch-black eyes held not a shred of saneness, not so much as a flicker of humanity.
a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat.”
Harry opened his mouth, unsure what to say, but needing to say
. Blaise had yet to find his soulmate, but the day he did, Draco vowed the most epic teasing of all time would commence, as payback for all the shit Blaise had given Draco over the years for his crush on Harry.
Instead, Harry was rather certain that was warmth in the Slytherin’s gaze. And a gentleness he’d only gotten to see a handful of times, when Draco was laughing and smiling and at his most vulnerable.
, bloody hell. Eventually, he managed to stop. Pause. Breathe. “I have no idea what it is you’re insinuating.”
But the Slytherin shook his head decisively, sending a lock of silver-blond tumbling onto his forehead. “No. Listen.” A pause. “Please.”
don’t even know who they are.”
Draco cleared his throat and redonned his familiar cold sneer, all the while mentally chiding himself for his own bloody carelessness. Honestly, at the rate he was going,
Merlin and Morgana, how someone so utterly incompetent had managed to secure a spot as an Auror was beyond Draco. The only explanation he could come up with was that the instructors had taken one look at the man’s burly statute and decided brains were overrated anyway. Only now taking effect?
“Yeah. It was my fault, really. Pansy’s the first person I’ve met that genuinely doesn’t care about her soulmark or thinks it’s this super secret, taboo sort of matter not to be discussed
So, because of this—for let it be known that Harry Potter did possess a basic understanding of good manners, contrary to what Draco might claim—he sent her a thankful little smile…and was, mere moments later, pleasantly surprised to find it mirrored back at him, if slightly more smirk-like than smiley. And with more teeth, pearly-white, straight, and disturbingly sharp.
, and he’d never wanted to leave as badly as he did at that moment.
I know is bullshit.”
Harry considered the question. “Well…I like duelling, I guess. And I play a mean game of Uno.”
And then they were moving—or rather, Draco was moving, stumbling forwards, gently pushing at Harry, goading him to follow suit, and the Gryffindor obliged, staggering backwards until the hard edge of the kitchen counter pressed against his back, where the bags and bags of takeout still sat, untouched.
Okay, that’s all for now. Again, thank you so, so, so much for reading! You guys are literally the best!!
Harry made a startled little sound, but he didn’t pull back again. Instead, he melted into the kiss, arms looping around Draco’s neck—and then they were full-out snogging again, completely uncaring that they were technically in public, out in the open, where anyone could see them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah, yes, because you’re such a walk in the park,” Harry answered with a laugh, and Draco didn’t even have the emotional capacity to feel vexed, not on top of everything else he felt every time he was within a one-mile-radius of Harry Potter. Which really was its own type of torture these days. If Lucius weren’t still so very alive, Draco might even guess it was his father’s revenge from above for Draco being such a horrible disgrace to the Malfoy name.
of it, of kindness and compassion and warmth and love, had those traits woven into his DNA, his magic, his very existence.
Fortunately, Draco simply gritted his teeth and nodded politely, if rather curtly. “I do.”
Draco was going to be sick. He was going to be sick, and he was going to throw up all over the perfectly clean, ivory-white bed sheets, and he was going to do so until the horror and fear and pain became secondary and his head grew so dizzy his mind stopped reeling.
One, this person in front of him, the man whose wand was currently pointed at Harry’s face—this wasn’t Nic, at least not the Nic Harry knew, the one with the laugh lines and kind smiles and sympathetic words. That Nic was gone, vanished, had perhaps never existed in the first place.
Except that was stupid, Draco had literally just been gone for a few minutes. Harry needed to
look his way as he said it that the Gryffindor was referring to him. It made his stomach twist and churn, because he’d
“Yeah. You know the place?”
Granger studied him with sharp eyes. “Positive, are you?”
Draco, much to the other restaurant-goers’ indignation, spared not a second glance at his surroundings, focus solely and resolutely pinned on Harry and Nic’s table. The intensity of it was…unnerving, to put it mildly, and Harry found himself briefly forgetting that he was supposed to be angry at the git.
“Err,” he tried again, not quite able to look Draco in the eye. “I, uhm. Didn’t actually mean that. Sorry. Tell you the truth, you’re actually a lot nicer than you give yourself credit for. Loads more thoughtful, too, and empathetic, and wicked clever as well. Honestly, I’d never tell Hermione this because I know she’d murder me in my sleep and hide my body where no one would ever find it, but I think you really give her a run for her money. You see, you’re actually quite brilliant, and a mighty good listener, and—”
And Yaxley raised his wand until the tip of it hovered directly between Draco’s eyes, whose heart was beating thunderously in his chest and gaze went slightly cross-eyed trying to keep his eyes on the tip of the wand that was to bring his death, and the Death Eater smirked and said what Draco realized—after all he’d been through, after all he’d survived, after all he’d so painstakingly worked through just to find his way back into society, into reality, into
here.
“Oh please, I’m not actually going to tell you the plan,” Yaxley’s cold voice sounded from across the room. “What sort of fool do you think I am? By telling you, not only would that ruin the plan, I’d also be depraving myself of the great amusement that is watching you struggle.” A chuckle sounded, the kind that made Draco want to retch. “You and the Potter boy are doomed already, and you don’t even realise it. There’s no more getting out of this one, you’re already—”
From across the carpet, Draco rolled his eyes, apparently having given up on his whole ‘I’m ignoring you, feel ignored’ routine. Harry was glad he had, even if that meant having to put up with a blond, Slytherin, slightly tetchier Hermione 2.0. Harry almost smiled—he doubted Draco would much appreciate the comparison, but it was hardly Harry’s fault that it was just so incredibly accurate, was it now?
But Potter’s gaze didn’t drop, emerald stare triumphant. “That’s exactly what I mean! You already get defensive when I mention your soulmark. Now imagine the entirety of Wizarding Britain talking about it. You can’t simply
Harry's brow furrowed in confusion. Nic? Who the hell was Nic?
—when compared to this. Kissing Ginny had been like a flicker of flame, a small, spluttering tealight whose wick was almost burned down, who could be snuffed out with a little puff of air.
Whatever spell had been holding Potter’s loyal bunch of followers in paralysis, it disappeared at Longbottom’s words. Weasley’s mouth thinned, and he fixed a scathing glare on Draco as he crossed his arms and said, “
Mind you, Harry loved his friends. Harry had missed his friends. Harry had been looking forward to seeing them again for ages now. But Harry also
There was a beat of awkward silence, in which Pansy looked smug, Harry looked dazed, Draco
Harry visibly deflated and returned the hug without hesitation, a small, affectionate smile playing across his lips. “Thanks, Mione. Love you too.”
“So, you’re here because…?” he began, lifting an eyebrow of his own as he eyed the other man with a sneer.
did we not realize it was Yaxley? Or, if not him, some other Death Eater escaped from Azkaban. They certainly have motive, plus they’re all just about deranged enough to try and off the Saviour of the Wizarding World.”
All eyes were on the tall, dark-eyed Healer. Finally, she sighed. “Fine. But if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call us. Just press the button right there, it’ll alert us immediately.”
Harry Potter.
Yet here they were.
And so that was how Harry ended up weaving a complex net of protection spells on his apartment and belongings therein, then clearing every last piece of furniture and residual items out of the way until nothing but a large, empty space remained in his living room, while Draco, the prick, simply stood by, leaning against the doorway to the kitchen, a steaming mug of coffee clasped in his hands, and watched Harry with an expression that screamed both sardonic amusement and the clear message ‘You are a complete and utter idiot and I hate you’.
Yes, the Gryffindor decided with a pang of dread, something was definitely off.
And just like that, Draco’s humiliation took second place. For when Narcissa’s gaze shifted to Harry, Draco’s eyes followed, and the fact alone that his mother had just called Harry his soulmate made his heart soar. That paired with the adorable smudge of pink currently coating the Gryffindor’s cheeks, and his previous discomfort was all but forgotten.
, he’d ended up getting cold feet and settling across from the Gryffindor instead.
“Fine,” Draco gritted out, wrenching himself free of the other Auror’s grip. “But I’m Apparating there myself.”
“I am sorry, though,” Draco said suddenly, and when Harry looked back up into his face, the Slytherin wasn’t looking him in the eye anymore, gaze instead fixed on the curl of Harry’s hair he was currently busy twirling around his finger. “For all I said. You were right, Yaxley’d riled me up, and when I came home to see him there with you, when you told me you two were going on a date…well, I really did lose it, didn’t I? My reaction was unfair, I know, and I’m truly sorry for that. I shouldn’t have said those things. I’ll…do better in future, okay? If…” He swallowed hard, still not looking at Harry. “If you’ll give me the chance to.”
“Fucking hell!” cursed Ginevra Weasley as her brother staggered back a few steps, hands flying to the side of his face. “You bloody
Harry smiled. “Give her my best.”
“Oh, thank
It simply wasn’t fair.
“I must admit I was dubious at first,” the Death Eater was already continuing, tone calm and unbothered, as though talking about something as mundane as the weather. “Lucius had told me, of course, about your unhealthy obsession with the Potter boy throughout your time at Hogwarts. But I’d always been of the impression it was just that—not
And then the twat really did pull away, looking irritatingly sombre all of a sudden with his soft frown and soft gaze and soft furrow between his brows. Except, at the same time, Harry also looked irritatingly gorgeous, so Draco couldn’t actually be annoyed with the git.
A charged, hair-raising silence descended upon them, and the tension in the air seemed to double every further second Harry stared into Draco’s eyes and Draco stared into Harry’s, locked in a staring competition neither dared break.
Draco found it amusing how the stranger—yes,
Plus, Harry really didn't like getting kicked.
Draco very much wanted to snap at the man to not call him mate, thank you very much, but another wave of pain got ahead of him, effectively cutting the Slytherin short as he gulped up another sharp intake of air through gritted teeth.
Except, no, that wasn’t true anymore. Perhaps a month ago he could have still claimed that, but certainly not now. Call him vapid or cliched or overly sentimental, but even with all that was going on, with Yaxley on the loose and his mother slowly wasting away and the most oblivious moron of all time stuck as his soulmate—even then, looking at Harry now and being able to confidently say
And he grinned.
Draco didn’t know who these Dursley-people were, but he shelfed the question for a different time, instead fixing his attention back down to his steaming cup of Darjeeling. He took a sip, and the silence was heavy, but much less awkward than it had been the day before.
A growl sounded from Yaxley’s mouth, and his next curse shattered against Draco’s shield. But before the other man could so much as blink, Draco was already moving again, his wand twirling and twisting as he shot non-verbal spell after spell after spell. Yaxley only barely dodged the first three before he managed to throw up a shield of his own, and the man’s answering scowl was one of pure loathing.
Draco’s smirk only widened in response. “Is that a promise?”
Draco didn’t look angry anymore, not at all. But Harry found he preferred anger or irritation over the sheer, undeniable
But what he saw there immediately dwarfed all worries about past dates and hypotheticalities.

now, do and not immediately have to fear he’d ruined things, fear Harry would never want to see him again because he didn’t reciprocate his feelings.
“Alright. Fine. I understand, and I won’t pester you any further. You need to do what’s best for you, and only you know what that is. If you think now’s not the time to tell him, then don’t, easy as that. But—Draco.” Blaise’s eyes shined like polished onyx. “Please please
“Is she…well?” Harry asked. “Your mother I mean. I haven’t really seen her around much.” An understatement. He hadn’t seen her even once since the day Lucius was found guilty.
Blaise.
A flash of light ripped through the dark alleyway. Except it wasn’t green, but scarlet. Nor did it origin from Yaxley’s wand, a wand that, at that moment, was wrenched right out of the Death Eater’s grasp and thrown by some invisible hand across the street to join Draco’s across the cobbled pavement.
that laugh. That laugh, bloody hell, he remembered hearing that laugh at Malfoy Manor. Remembered sitting at the long, ebony dining table, horrified and sick to his stomach, as Voldemort perched at the head of the table with Nagini like some self-proclaimed king, petting the snake as though it were a cat, praising the face Draco knew that cold laugh belonged to, a face that had taken almost as much pleasure in torturing and murdering muggleborns as Bellatrix had. Bellatrix might have been much more obvious about it, but Draco still distinctly remembered how the man’s dark eyes had glowed every time he recounted his stories for all the Death Eaters to hear.

“Potter.”
“I—” he said, blinking, trying to reel himself back in, to calm down, to
“Blimey, you really do need to head over to St. Mungo’s,” Jennings’ voice said from somewhere above, his hand coming to rest awkwardly on Draco’s shoulder. The latter tried to shove it off, but only ended up wincing and swearing harder.
“Yes, Mother?” he said, straightening his spine and smoothing down his hair before he, too, stood. “Is something the matter?”
Draco had a bad feeling about this.
perfectly fine. We don’t need Lucius. We’ll figure it out without him, just like we have everything else.”
. Especially when a Weasley was involved, and
(See the end of the chapter for
Salazar’s tits, was one stress-free day really too much to ask for?!
. “I sure hope you weren’t about to say ‘he’s used it’, because that’s tactless even for your standards, Weasley. You don’t just ‘get used to’ people trying to kill you. Now move, or so help me Salazar, I will move you.”
The Death Eater laughed, a cold, mirthless, broken sort of sound, like walking on shards of broken glass. “Of course I do. Frankly, how it took you lot so long to figure out is beyond me.”
“Hogwarts?” Draco asked, eyebrows lifted. “You work at Hogwarts?”
It was only when the stranger turned to face Draco that the Slytherin was wrenched back into reality, that he forced himself to breathe again, look,
And for some reason, that hurt him far more than any of Ginny’s cold glares and barbed-wire words ever could.
“Careful there,” a soft, deep voice said, and two firm hands closed around his arm, effectively stopping him from collapsing in a heap of useless limbs.
Somewhere across the store, Philomena whimpered, and Yaxley cackled from below, while Draco only gritted his teeth harder. The stranger, however, simply dug his wand back into Draco’s skin and hissed, “Lift your hands. And back away slowly. It was not a request.”
to look up.
“No. Please, Harry, just give me a moment, okay? I’m getting to it.”
He couldn’t quite decide whether that was panic or excitement flooding his mind.
Ron nodded enthusiastically. “Robards dispatched a bunch of Aurors to go after him, but I’d already promised Hermione we’d come over, so I couldn’t join. But there’s no way Yaxley will escape with a dozen Aurors on his tail. Maybe this’ll all be over in a few minutes and everything can finally go back to normal!”
, and just like that, Harry was frozen to the spot, a simple touch more effective than any Petrificus Totalus known to wizardkind.
He remembered the blinding pain in his stomach, as though someone was slicing him up from the inside, and the fire in his throat, and the black spots that had clouded his vision, and the coughing fit of blood, and… Wait. Someone had
Is there even such a thing as 'too sappy'????
(See the end of the chapter for
“Deep breaths.” Blaise’s voice again. “That’s it. In, and out. In. Out. Good. Keep it going.”
Ron opened his mouth to protest, but Robards was already continuing, “My decision on the matter is final, Auror Weasley. However, I did make certain Auror Potter’s new escort is someone whose skill level might match his.” And then, much to Harry’s horror, and Ron’s horror, and, judging by his expression, Malfoy’s horror as well, the Head Auror turned to face the blond Slytherin still standing rooted to the spot across the room.
Harry blinked, surprised Draco would tell Pansy such a thing. Not that it was personal or anything, but it certainly called into question what other things Draco had told her. Knowing Harry’s luck, Parkinson likely knew all about every last idiotic, fickle thing Harry had said that night outside the pub and would make it her personal mission to murder Harry in his sleep for it. Maybe, if she was feeling particularly Slytherin, and Harry had a feeling that was pretty much her everyday state of being, she’d use poison so it would look like Yaxley had done it.
He had, hadn’t he. Only problem was, Draco was a liar. It was a fact just as inborn as his dry humour or condescending superiority or sadistic sarcasm. He’d never minded much before—after all, the best Slytherins were those that lied well and without remorse, those who would never let something as pesky as
“Look, mate, it’s protocol,” Jennings interrupted him. “If you get injured on the job, you have to have it checked out. That’s the rule. Nothing anybody can do about it, not you or me or even Robards. If I were you, instead of protesting, I’d just get it over with.”
But Hermione, on the other hand…Hermione looked smug.
someone?
.” Draco huffed irately and glowered over at Harry, as though he were genuinely annoyed and it wasn’t instead a blatant lie.
No, he
Harry nodded once, ducking his head as well. Well then. So much for that.
Right now, all Draco wanted to do was kiss his soulmate—and if, in the process, he managed to forget the rest of the world existed, then all the better.
, and as all Malfoys ought to be, he was a firm realist, for it was no good dwelling on dreams and fantasies when you had an estate to run.
. That’s something I would have never said about the smarmy little git I met back in First Year.” He shrugged. “Sure, you’ve made mistakes in the past, but who hasn’t? The point is, you’ve long since recognised them as such and have made damn sure to atone for them. You asked me earlier whether I think you’ve changed. The answer is, yes, of course you have. And now that I know you—the

“Oi!” Harry exclaimed once he’d regained his composure and whipped out his own wand. “The duel hasn’t even started yet, arsehole! How about a little heads-up next time?”
bugger. Because his day hadn’t been going bad enough as it was.
Nope. Definitely panic.
“So you’re admitting you’re not sane, then?” Harry said. “That you’re mad? Bonkers? An utter loon?”
Not that Draco expected them to find anything. No, the man—whoever he’d been—was in all probability already halfway across Britain, if he had any common sense at all.
Recognition dawned on Draco.
Draco snorted, but the moment Harry’s eyes slid to him, he was stunned to find the blond blushing furiously, looking at the ground with the same fervour Harry had just minutes earlier. “No need to sound so surprised. I’m not entirely ignorant, you know.”
The man dodged the spell with ease, but Draco had counted on that. A flash of orange light exploded from his wand as his non-verbal ‘Everte Statum’ sped towards the figure, hitting the man square in the chest before he could react, or so much as move. Their assailant was immediately thrown backwards, powerless as he found himself flung through the air like a ragdoll and landed in a shop window with yet another explosion of glass. Draco sent up another shield as the jagged crystalline shards came flying, effectively saving himself from any further cuts—but the attacker was not so lucky.
Harry smiled, and Malfoy must have been as uncertain as Harry was, for the sight visibly calmed the blond, making his shoulders sag slightly. No—not Malfoy, Harry reminded himself, and an inexplicable surge of warmth went through his chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry rolled his eyes. Really, he ought to be annoyed with Draco, or at least reproving. Sure, Nic had been the arsehole first, but then he’d tried to apologize, and Draco had shot him down stone-cold. But Harry couldn’t dredge up the necessary ire to scold the blond, and so he simply plopped down in his own armchair with a, “Ha-ha. Very witty.”
“No,” he gritted out. “No, I don’t. And, frankly, I’m in no mood for your mind games right now, so either tell me what you’re so clearly itching to say or do us both a favour and shut up.”
Harry had expected himself to feel smug, or victorious, or at least a tiny bit triumphant. After all, he’d been fantasizing about punching the git in the face just minutes before. Yet all he felt then was that same vague pain in his chest area.
And what had Draco gotten for his trouble? A near-death experience and another Harry-induced scar to add to his collection.
ENJOY!
Draco, whose eyes had started to tear up at the sheer force of his coughing fit, shook his head, managing to inhale long enough to stop from suffocating. He swallowed and cleared his throat, finally recovering enough to shoot another disparaging look down at the newspaper article. Front page, naturally, surpassing even the four-month anniversary of a breakout in Azkaban that led to many convicted war-criminals getting free. Fortunately, Lucius Malfoy had not been one of them—Draco had checked the instant news of the escape got out—but that was hardly very placating.
And then his right hand curled itself into a tight fist and collided with the side of Ron Weasley’s jaw with one resounding thwack.
Harry blinked. “Err, thanks, Nic. But, to be entirely frank, I don’t think I’m the one you ought to be apologizing to right now.”
Draco had panicked. There, he admitted it. And in his panic, he perhaps hadn’t behaved entirely sensible. Instead, he’d jumped up from his chair, almost knocking it backwards, and bounded out the restaurant, ignoring the worried exclamations from his friends and the alarmed cries of the other restaurant-goers, only to Disapparate the moment he was outside.
He hadn’t expected Draco to be so
Harry chuckled. “Very.”
many people out there like Dominic Hayes or Ginevra Weasley, just waiting for the chance to make the famous Harry Potter their own. After all, who wouldn’t want him? Who wouldn’t want the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Vanquisher of Voldemort, the Saviour of the Wizarding World?
The words held so much venom it was almost a tangible thing, but, whereas the Draco of four years ago would have minded the comment about his father, twenty-year-old, Harry-Potter-dating Draco honestly couldn’t have cared less.
Harry blinked, and was about to turn back to his pancakes.
He just hoped nothing too bad would happen.
“Harry? Harry, I know you’re in there, Ron told me you’d be. Please open up, I just…want to talk.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry stiffen, and his own anger doubled, tripled, until he was almost shaking with it, with disgust, with hate, for the man that had tried to kill Harry multiple times and now had the nerve to sit there and smile.
Draco’s eyes were sparkling with mirth. “Yes? And?”
“Before you say anything, she didn’t tell me who it is. She didn’t say anything, really, at least nothing you hadn’t already told me. She was just telling me there are plenty of people like her, people who’ve found their soulmate but don’t end up with them. I said you were one of those people, too, right, and she was surprised at first but then agreed. And we got talking and… Anyway.” Harry hesitated, still blushing, still not looking at Draco. “I just wanted you to know. That. Well. I know we said we wouldn’t talk about it, and I’m not trying to force you to, I dunno,
But then…there it was. Soft and faint and too slow, but there nonetheless, and, for the time being, that was all Draco could ask for. He would have breathed a relieved sigh if there weren’t a deranged killer waiting for him just behind the desk.
“You were horrible, and I used to hate you,” continued Harry, and paused. “But that’s just it. I

about Harry.
me?” Ginny shook her head, looking at him down her nose despite being at least two heads shorter, as though he’d just singlehandedly murdered her entire family. “I think you’ve done enough, thank you very much. Honestly, I don’t even recognise you anymore.”
. There were so many people whose names started with the letter D. How the hell was he supposed to find…
Lucius’ trial was still a sore subject for Draco, as he was certain Potter must know. He gritted his teeth, a peaceful breakfast long since forgotten. “Oh, yes, boo-hoo, Potter. You have my deepest condolences.”
Draco didn’t regret it, hadn’t ever. However, that didn’t lessen the sting of the words he’d tortured himself with during long nights spent thinking of all that had been lost in the war, tangible and not.
things like that,” he continued in a furious whisper. “Merlin, Blaise, what if someone heard—what if
With one large stride he was at Harry’s side, and before the Gryffindor could so much as open his mouth to protest, Draco was clutching his forearm and dragging him out the room.
, Draco prayed, face all the while flaming,
“You do?” the Gryffindor asked, as though this answer came as a genuine shock to him.
“Don’t you ‘Mother’ me, Draco,” she said, eyes narrowing. “I sat through years and years of listening to your complaints. Every single holiday it was ‘Harry Potter this’ and ‘Harry Potter that’ and ‘oh why won’t he ever notice me’. And now that, years later, you finally got over yourself and confessed, you have the audacity to say you
All the while not moving a muscle, neither to take a step back, nor to
“No more hide and seek for you, Draco,” Yaxley growled, and the cabinet was flung to the side as though thrown by some invisible giant.
Blaise’s lips thinned, but he didn’t answer.
? Shame on you, Draco. I’m disappointed.”
I've decided to post two chapters today, for the reasons that, one, I am a very impatient individual with absolutely no self-control, and two, I'm not entirely happy with how Chapter 5 turned out in the end. But that's life as a writer for you--self-doubt is your best friend.
“Oh god, I’m sorry, you really don’t have to. I didn’t mean to—”
Problem is, Draco didn’t know what the bloody hell he’d do if he found Yaxley lurking on the other side of that door. Although he’d rather collapse from exhaustion than admit it aloud, he knew he was still a far cry from ‘healed’. Moving still took far more energy than it should, and his mind was a lot slower than he was accustomed to. Plus, he doubted any hectic spells cast now would be very effective at all, seeing as his magical core was apparently still damaged and only slowly recovering, to quote Blaise—provided said spells even hit their target in the first place.
.” The dreamy look on his mate’s face had Harry and Hermione trading another exasperated look. “And you know all ‘bout Ginny. My ickle baby sister, flying for the Holyhead Harpies.”
And, will you look at that, now Draco’s mood was downright homicidal.
(See the end of the chapter for
crossed his mind.
And so Harry didn’t wait for Ron to catch up before stepping into the fire place and throwing down his own handful of Floo Powder.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, and the switch in the air was a palpable thing.
“Fuck off, Potter.”
. And, as he so often had in the past and would likely continue to do until the day he died, Draco could make an exception for the Boy Who Lived. Could, and would, if only to see that blindingly bright smile a few moments longer.
A wide, if initially hesitant smile broke across Harry’s face as well. “I…okay. Great. Sounds like a plan.”
But Draco needn’t have worried. For it was at that exact moment that Harry clamped his mouth shut, surprise melting into the sort of look that made Draco’s heart melt, smile easy and kind.
“Robards thought it best not to tell you. Probably, if I had to guess, to avoid a reaction like this one. Surely even you must understand it’s for the best,” Draco drawled, and the iciness in his tone shocked Harry into silence. “Or would you rather Yaxley be able to simply stroll up to the next best owl, strap a package full of Garrotting Gas to it and merrily send the thing over so you can suffocate in your own living room?”
apologetic for being a dickhead all through Hogwarts. You’re still the same arrogant, imperious bully you were back then, and nothing, least of all your half-hearted little apologies, is going to change my mind about that. Why Hermione might forgive you I understand, she’s just too forgiving in general, and Ron basically does whatever she says, but Harry should know better, Harry—”
. Not smiling in his vague direction, nor because there were Gryffindors nearby that might elicit one of those rare moments of vulnerability from the Boy Who Lived. No—these, they were smiles meant for Draco and Draco alone, smiles he had earned, smiles he deserved.
“Okay, that’s it. Tell me what’s going on.”
“Something wrong?” Harry asked at last.
Draco nodded. It was all he could think to do, all his mind could come up with.
When her constant glaring became too irritating, to the point Draco feared he might accidentally shout at her and thus effectively negate whatever small progress he’d made today, he fixed her with his coldest look and said, quiet enough that Harry and his friends wouldn’t hear but with a sufficient amount of bite, “Yes, Ginevra? Can I help you?”
fallen hard, so, so hard, whether voluntarily or not.
Harry’s eyes boring into him, drilling through the skin in between his shoulder blades, piercing through him sharper than any blade.
had somehow poisoned him…
Harry Potter, but
Draco didn’t stop grumbling, but let himself be pulled along, nonetheless. “And they say us Slytherins are the conniving ones.”
“I…,” Harry breathed, and immediately grimaced. He waved a vague hand towards the exit. “I think I need some fresh air. You guys stay here and enjoy yourselves.” He shook his head when Ron started to stand, repressing another grimace. “No, really. Stay. Keep having fun. I’ll manage.”
And, damn it, Draco wanted to say he did. He wanted to reassure Harry, tell him everything would be fine and that there was no need to worry. After all, Harry deserved that, didn’t he? He was right—after all the years of running from Voldemort, of living under the constant fear of dying, he deserved a fucking break.
“No,” he said, unable to stop his lips from curving upwards at the smile Harry wore. “No, I really don’t deserve you. Didn’t anyone ever tell you? You’re as radiant as the sun, love.”
Pansy snorted, and Harry found his eyes promptly shooting back to her, so shocked by the uncharacteristically un-pureblood sound he could only gape. Sure, he’d heard Draco snort before, but that was
Granger huffed a laugh as well, one that was just as grim as Draco’s but still so full of confidence. “The crazy thing is, Draco, I genuinely don’t think he does.”
“Yes. Much good it did them, too. Now that Lucius is locked up in Azkaban, slowly wasting away day by day, my mother gets to experience that as well. I used to wonder all the time whether the Wizengamot let her off the hook on purpose, knowing she’d suffer right alongside my father anyway.”
It was at that moment that Harry truly realised the gravity of the situation—he was alone, without a wand, and with someone who was making very little sense and saying things which sounded very much disturbing.
Nic hummed his agreement, expression unreadable. “Homophobic? You’re sure?”
“Why, yes, as a matter of fact. My family owned a horde of
It was all there, for the whole fucking world to read. And whereas such an article might have helped them find Yaxley, they had nothing to go on when it came to his accomplice. They were a shadow, a ghost, a nameless, faceless person who could very well be just outside the door, waiting for Harry to leave before making their next and final move.
But right now was not that day.
Harry blinked a few times, both so that his brain might catch up to his surroundings and in an effort not to look directly into the blinding white lights shining down from above.
And then a blast of green shot from the stranger’s wand, and Corban Yaxley spoke no more.
Blaise chuckled. “Let’s get you dressed first. After all, you need to look your best if you’re going to win over Harry Potter.”
Somewhere throughout the speech (because that’s what this was, a
“Yes,
“Uh-huh,” Harry said, and oh, this was simply
, so you can ask Potter once he wakes up. I’m sure he’ll be happy to explain everything in terms even your pea-sized brain can comprehend.”
Harry sighed again, ignoring the way Draco’s eyes narrowed at the sound. “Of course I have hobbies. But they’re all outside, aren’t they?” He was itching to go flying again, but he doubted Draco would go for it. Christ, Harry had never thought staying inside would be so bloody
He marched up to the cupboard they kept the mugs in with singular focus, anger a palpable, searing thing inside him, blazing white-hot within his chest. Draco grabbed the next best mug, and if he slammed the cupboard door shut again just a bit too forcefully, if he flicked his wand with a vengeance as he cast an Aguamenti on the mug, followed by a half-hissed, half-growled Water-heating spell, if he accidentally ripped open the tea package as he thrust it into his tea water—well, then that was no one’s business but his own.
Draco’s smile widened another fraction.
But then, slowly, gradually, a smirk twisted its way across Draco’s mouth. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry noticed Ron’s mouth drop straight open, but Harry’s attention was focused elsewhere; mainly, on the way Draco’s eyes twinkled as he drawled, “Better than a hopelessly inept Gryffindork who can’t even make an apple pie without nearly burning down his flat.”
“Oh? Then, by all means,” he bit out, “enlighten me.”
Harry, instead of scowling, found himself chuckling slightly, and it obviously surprised Malfoy as much as it did himself, for the blond fixed his disbelieving gaze on Harry. “Potter, are you alright? Do you need to Apparate back to St. Mungo’s?”
And just like that, Draco’s worries had been appeased, at least for the time being. The people that mattered hadn’t minded the name now tattooed across his wrist, hidden 24/7 underneath either long sleeves or a leather band.
When Draco had been silent for what could’ve been mere seconds and just as easily several minutes, Harry looked up. He’d been anxious enough as it was, but the moment his emerald eyes locked onto Draco’s, his cheeks took on the deepest, darkest crimson yet, so vividly red the Gryffindor could have blended in with the walls.
A few moments of silent glaring passed, until Draco snorted. “And you honestly believe us Slytherins are the arrogant ones.” He shook his head again, sighing the same sort of exhausted sigh he’d given Harry shit for just minutes earlier. “But my point stands, Potter, I am not duelling with you in your apartment, do you have any idea how much damage you’d end up having to pay for, plus I sincerely doubt your muggle neighbours would appreciate it much—”
Right, now Harry was completely lost. “The…baby…?”
“Careful, Mr. Potter,” said a soft but adamant voice somewhere above him, and he cracked his eyes open to find a stranger looming over him. She reminded him of Professor McGonagall with her severe scowl and don’t-you-dare-disobey-me gaze.
! I know I may not have the best track record concerning Potter, but how utterly
An invisible injury without apparent cause.
He made his way out his bedroom and across the living room and opened the door to be greeted by the smiling faces of his two best friends—and the heavenly smell of Thai. Ron immediately strode past Harry into his apartment and, after traversing the room, plopped down on one of the armchairs by the fireplace, giving a long, weary sigh as he did.
Hermione laughed. “And you say I’m bossy.”
For some reason Draco’s usage of his first name calmed Harry much more than he’d ever thought possible. It reminded him that, yes, although he had royally fucked up outside the pub, the progress they’d made before that had been
Draco instantly disliked the man.
“Bloody hell,” the ginger groaned across the room. “Look, I’m genuinely happy for you, Harry, but seeing my best mate snog a Malfoy is weird, okay?
the ones made for each other. Pen and I are great as friends, but nothing more. And we’re both fine with that. You see, a soulmark isn’t destiny—it’s a possibility, a choice. Sure, usually it works out. But sometimes it doesn’t, and that’s okay, too. It’s only as big a deal as you make it.”
The truth was, Yaxley had been right about one thing—the one question that bothered Draco the most was not who Yaxley’s accomplice was. It wasn’t even why Yaxley had done it, why he’d decided to throw his life away for a psychopath, how he could look at the people around him, at muggleborns and muggles and people like Harry, and deem them unworthy of life.
Harry had just opened his mouth to reply, when the doors across the room flew open and in marched Healer Hodkinson. The man froze dead in his tracks the moment he realised just who was keeping Harry company, and he blinked, startled, eyes darting between Pansy and Draco, evidently unsure which ‘who’ was worse.
“Great! Then that’s settled.” Ron turned to Harry. “You don’t mind us going, right, mate? We can come back in half an hour or so, yeah?”
“Tempting,” she drawled, “but no thanks. I have a feeling my sense of ‘entertainment’ and that of Harry here differ quite a bit. Not that I didn’t enjoy fake-dating you back at Hogwarts in an effort to convince our parents we were straight—which, I’d just like to point out, failed spectacularly—but I’m afraid I wouldn’t snog you if you paid me for it.”
He didn’t know how to react. Should he be glad? Should he be disappointed? On the one hand, he was silently thankful it wasn’t a
. Yes, I do. So, so much. Fuck, you honestly have no idea, do you?”
Draco gave a chuckle, but it sounded as miserable as he looked. “I can see that. But it doesn’t matter anymore, truly. Forgive and forget and all that, right?”
Draco wouldn’t lie; he’d imagined snogging Harry Potter plenty of times over the years. The very first time he could remember giving it active thought would have to be on the night of the Yuletide Ball back in Fourth Year. He had no doubt he’d been pining after the dark-haired Gryffindor for years before that, perhaps even since that very first fateful meeting at Madame Malkin’s. But it was on that historic evening in December of 1994, as all of Hogwarts twinkled like a snowy winter wonderland and students danced their way across the Great Hall until their feet were sore, that Draco realised just how far gone he truly was.
Then, she nodded curtly, eyes still trained on Draco. “Right then. Come on in. He’s already asked to see you.”
“Harry.” Draco inhaled a shaky breath, then looked up to his friend. “Where is he?”
“I don’t know how you sidestepped rotting in Azkaban for the rest of your life,” the man spat, “but that doesn’t make you innocent, not by a long shot. You’re just as much a pureblood fanatic as the rest of them, and equally to blame.”
Had Harry been smiling too much? Laughing too hard? Had Draco seen through him, realised where Harry’s traitorous mind sidled off to in the moments he found himself staring too long, the moments his mind went blank and the fluttery something in his chest grew unignorable?
And good that, too, for it was mere seconds later that Weasley came storming across the kitchen without any prior warning whatsoever, glare latched onto Harry, with the rest of him following seconds later.
It was with one foot out the fireplace that Draco froze. Blinked once, blinked twice, three times.
—you always had other people to formulate and then execute your plans for you, didn’t you.”
But guarding someone and actively putting one’s own life on the line to save that of another were two very different things. And frankly, Harry never would have expected the latter from Draco Malfoy, not in a hundred years.
“Potter?
for such a position.
Draco had thought he’d hate a gathering of loud, obnoxiously chatty Gryffindors much more than he actually found himself doing. He didn’t know whether to be pleased or alarmed by that fact.
reacted a lot worse during your father’s trial when they were spewing nonsense about you and your family in the Daily Prophet. And, before you say anything, no, I’m not suggesting the circumstances are the same. But they wrote an article about you once—I have to live with this
But all Draco could feel as he watched the broken shell of a human being stare at his interrogator, a small, slippery smile snaking across his face, pulling at it in truly unnatural ways, was hatred. A hatred so deep-rooted and intense it almost equalled what he’d felt for Voldemort in those last months, what he felt even now at times when he thought of his father and all he’d done to their family.
Nic chuckled and batted a dismissive hand. “Oh, I don’t mind. A bit of excitement now and then keeps us all young. Honestly, I’m just glad everything ended well. For a moment there, we were all really worried.” He cleared his throat and his grin widened, something Draco hadn’t thought possible. “So, what are you doing here?”
“Oh, don’t get me started,” Ron grumbled as Harry handed them each a plate of Thai. The redhead immediately began shovelling the rice into his mouth, even as he spoke. “Mum’s decided the wedding’s going to be at the Burrow. At the

shouldn’t be laughing. That isn’t funny. Christ, you’re a bad influence.”
The softness of the image, the pure affection swirling in those emerald green eyes—it sent a warm, serene sort of feeling through Draco, the type that reminded him of the many weekends spent outside by the Great Lake, enjoying the warm rays of sun and pleasant breeze as it gusted through his hair, laying in the grass and listening to Pansy recount the latest gossip, or Blaise rant about whichever essay they had due the next Monday.
Blaise rolled his eyes, but at least he didn’t look moments away from pulling out his own hair anymore. “I refuse to be told off by the likes of you, Mister I’m-so-smitten-I-can’t-even-be-apart-from-my-soulmate-for-five-bloody-minutes-without-going-absolutely-bat-shit-crazy.”
Only said stupid, pointy-angled, symmetrical-faced Slytherin
“Yes,” Harry croaked. “Hmm.”
“Afraid so.”
But then Draco Malfoy took Harry’s outstretched hand, eyes fixed resolutely downwards, and Apparated them away.
A scowl overtook Nic’s face, and gone was the subtlety he’d so meticulously exercised moments before, now apparently so far gone in his loathing for Draco that he didn’t care anymore that Harry still sat at the table, his anger so deep-rooted that even worming himself into the Chosen One’s good graces took second place.
, this had been simply too much, even for him. Not with any excuse or justification could Harry validate his reaction from the night before.
. Yes, that sounded about right.
He laughed, but stopped just as quickly when the other man didn’t join in.
Nothing could have prepared Harry when the raven-haired head of one Pansy Parkinson came tumbling out of his fireplace, features warped in indignation as she dusted off her skin-tight, very short ruby dress, adjusting her black leather jacket and kicking the dust off her matching pair of platform boots.
Now, Harry was not one to get easily emotional, at least not outwardly. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d cried, doubted he’d shed a single tear in the past two years.
To stay calm. (He was finding that rather hard at the moment.)
Harry’s reaction, on the other hand, was much less contained, and so there was little Draco could do before his boyfriend had already jumped up, wand out and pointed at the ‘intruder’. Which would have been a commendable reaction, were it not for the fact that the Gryffindor’s glasses were hanging off one ear, completely askew, and he was wearing sweats and only one sock.
anxious!
“What the
Ok so this chapter is a little shorter than usual (sorry!!) but I promise the next chapter will in turn be a lot longer. Also, this one's entirely in Draco's POV, so enjoy!
Draco whirled around, fixing Weasley with a glare borne of all his combined anger and hatred and disgust for Yaxley, and the redhead immediately shrunk back. Draco, however, didn’t feel an ounce of satisfaction.
, and the action didn’t even hurt anymore; there was no room for pain inside Harry, not when he was filled to the brim with such incredible, undimmable
Right then.
“Look, Nic, it was so great meeting you again,” Harry said, forcing a small smile for the other man’s sake. “But I’m afraid Draco and I really ought to go now. This is our, what, fourth round of Butterbeer?” The Gryffindor gave an evidently strained laugh, but even then, the sound had such a calming effect Draco could practically feel his own anger simmer down inside of him.  “Any more Butterbeer and I’ll go into a sugar coma. But, hey, if you come here often, maybe we could meet up some time, before you have to go back to Hogwarts, eh?”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but at that moment a thud sounded, and all eyes shifted to where Draco still sat in his armchair, his thick book having fallen to the floor with a loud thump. The Slytherin very determinedly did not look up at them as he bent down to snatch up the book, a miniature little scowl with no real edge to it playing across his lips. But it was the faint smudge of red in his cheeks that caught Harry’s attention, and he furrowed his brow in confusion.
And suddenly Harry found his mind circling back to the same topic he’d pondered the day before yesterday, after their first kiss, when he was lying in bed and rejoicing in the knowledge that
He did not, he decided, like the sensation one bit.
for Merlin’s sake. Yet all Harry had been able to dig up was an unusual feeling of…placidity, if you will. Sure, he wasn’t entirely thrilled with the notion of the former Slytherin babysitting him, much less living at his flat. But it bothered him much less than he’d expected it to. Which made no sense whatsoever, seeing as he really ought to be the opposite of calm when faced with the idea of
Another moment of tense silence ticked by, and Draco stayed completely motionless under Yaxley’s grip. Yet his eyes, his eyes he allowed stray towards Harry. And when he found one pair of emerald eyes staring back, filled with so many contrasting emotions, from hatred to anger to actual fear, so natural and raw it made Draco’s chest tighten, he actually forgot for a moment the deathly fear gripping his heart at the still dangerously high prospects of being murdered by his former colleague.
“Harry,” said Draco gently, his gaze never straying from his soulmate’s. He lifted a tentative hand to brush a stray lock of hair from the other’s forehead. “
, however, expected the response to come in the form of one Narcissa Malfoy.
The Slytherin smiled again. And then he extricated his right hand from Harry’s grip, pulling back the sleeve of his (previously) white dress shirt. He looked up into Harry’s eyes again and, without ever breaking eye contact, undid the leather band he always wore fastened around his soulmark, letting it drop onto the mattress.
Draco paid no heed to the irritated outcries of customers and waiters alike, his scarlet Auror robes flapping in his wake, the red monstrosity looking decidedly out of place in the sea of blazers and fine dresses and silk ties. That alone struck Harry as immensely odd.
! We’ll do it, and if something happens—no, scratch that—
He ought to be annoyed. And with anyone else, Draco
And to think, the last things Harry had said to him had been cruel and undeserved. He still had no idea why he’d reacted so strongly after Draco’s altercation with Nic at the pub. Sure, he’d glimpsed a side of the Slytherin he’d never wanted to see again, the side that had reminded him of the sneering, drawling pureblood Draco had been at Hogwarts. The sort of Draco that would have rather danced naked through the Ministry of Magic than call Harry a friend.
any day of the week.
“That’s…kind of him,” she ground out, all the while looking at Draco with such heated, barely suppressed loathing that not smirking was becoming excruciating.
to thank you,” Harry said. “For saving my life, obviously, because had you not been there, I’d be dead now. But…also for the pub.” He took a deep breath, all the while feeling the weight of those grey eyes on him. “Talking with you was surprisingly nice. Oh, err, sorry, that came out wrong. What I mean is, I enjoyed it very much. Much more than I do fighting with you. Look, afterwards, when we left the pub…I honestly don’t know what came over me. I’m so sorry for everything. I reacted cruelly and unjustly and said some pretty horrible things. I didn’t mean any of them, and if I could take them back, I swear I would—”
No. He pursed his lips. No, that simply wasn’t an option.
“First of all,” Draco said, “Pansy did not ‘suggest’ anything. She told us the outing was happening and that we were coming, period. Had we tried to argue, she’d have no doubt bullied us into coming anyway. Isn’t that right, Pans?”
Draco uncrossed his legs and raised an eyebrow at his best friend. “Not that you don’t look marvellous, darling, but I’m not sure it’ll do you much good if you can neither move nor speak nor breathe.”
The first thing being, of course, the humongous scowl and rumpled, silver-blond mess that had replaced his usually-so-sleek hair. Oh, and the demonic glare he was currently pinning their table with.
Draco swallowed.
“‘Corban Yaxley: The complete story behind his escape from Azkaban, attempted assassination of War-Hero and Saviour Harry Potter, and eventual murder’,” Pansy read aloud, then looked back up immediately, smirk gone.
Fuck, Harry thought, cursing himself and his stupidity. Things had been going so well, and naturally he’d gone and ruined it.
And just like that, whatever comfortable atmosphere that might’ve existed an instant ago vanished into thin air, and Malfoy’s head snapped up so quickly he risked whiplash, grey eyes wide.
“That was supposed to
Nic nodded, already lifting his hand to throw down the green powder. But then he hesitated and said with a little lopsided smile, “Do try the beignets, though, will you? Trust me, you’ll love them.”
was the kind of ending his already-complete-and-utter-shite day needed. Soaked all the way down to his underwear within a matter of seconds.
—would be the last words he’d ever hear:
Draco’s eyes went wide, and, ignoring the brief flash of pain the hasty motion brought on, tore his right arm out from under the blankets. Only to see the sleeve and leather band having previously hidden the mark from view unmistakably gone.

Harry blinked at him, then back at his wrist. And, slowly, carefully, as though the soulmark might leap out and attack him, he pulled down his right sleeve just enough to briefly peak at the letter now stamped into his skin.
an option he cared to take.
“How’s everyone else doing, then? Are Bill and Fleur enjoying Egypt?” Harry hadn’t seen the two of them since Ron’s proposal.
And that brought on yet another surge of worry, but for a very different reason.
“Where’s Harry?” exclaimed a bleary-eyed Hermione Granger, at the same time as an unusually pallid Ronald Weasley narrowed his eyes at Draco and Blaise and spat, “What the bloody hell are you two doing here?”
The dismissal was as subtle as a fist to the nose, and Harry could only gape at Draco, whose smile and gaze were focused entirely on Nic, who in turn stood there for a long moment, evidently torn between standing his ground and leaving as he’d wanted to do from the start. In the end, though, the latter won out, and he shot one last narrow-eyed look at Draco, before turning to face Harry.
But he gave himself no time to lament his injuries. Instead, he sprung up, wand already gripped tight and lifted, and bellowed “

Parvati made a face at her best friend, but Nic simply laughed.
Draco still remembered that day with so much clarity it could’ve easily been yesterday, as though it’d been just the day before he’d stood in his father’s study, in front of the 18
the whole ten minutes he was here? One more of those ridiculously pathetic smiles and I’d have lost my breakfast.”

Pansy frowned, but her tone remained doggedly optimistic. “But that’s great! Honestly, I didn’t even think you two would manage
scare them away.”
Across the café booth, the object of Draco’s affections rolled his eyes dramatically, as though
Harry would have dropped his wand in surprise if it weren’t, of course, currently on the other side of the alleyway.
After that, the conversation devolved into mindless chatter, like how Seamus and Dean's new neighbor was an asshat who apparently loved Metallica a little too much, or how Lavender had missed out on a role in a theatre production she'd been dead-set on for months now all because her would-be costar wanted his girlfriend to have the part, or how Neville had just discovered a new species of man-eating flower over in Asia that had almost devoured Luna on not one, not two but three separate occasions ("The poor thing just wants a friend," she'd replied sagely).
, but Harry couldn’t remember a time when he’d ever felt so happy.
Harry scooped up his own spoonful of rice to hide his grin. “So, you already have a date in mind?”
Well.
It was, however, extremely uncomfortable to witness.
Ron grimaced slightly, but squeezed her hand reassuringly, nonetheless. “Bit.”
“Oh dear,” came a different voice, and a new face appeared above him. It was a pudgy man with silver-grey hair, and although it took a moment, Harry’s mind supplied a name before the rest of his senses had the chance to catch up.
Blaise huffed. “Please don’t tell me I just missed the single most important moment of Draco’s life. The culmination of years and years of griping and grousing and complaining and pi—”
It’d been fun with Ginny, sure, but it was nothing—
“What?” Harry asked, one eyebrow lifted in amused suspicion as he watched Draco gently set down his cup of tea and stand from where he’d indeed been sitting the last few minutes, deep in thought, staring at Harry because…
Draco blinked. Opened his mouth. Blinked again. “Harry Potter. Here. As in, right there. All night.”
“Right then,” said Ron, and Harry had completely forgotten his best friend was there in the kitchen as well. The redhead was looking out the kitchen door into the living room, a small frown tugging at his lips. He turned to Harry. “He’s an odd fellow, isn’t he?”
He gently closed the door to the empty hallway, then turned to fully face his boyfriend, who was still staring at him. Harry forced a small smile, even though his heart still thundered in his chest, beating wildly and at the same time feeling awfully constricted, as though Ginny had reached into his ribcage and squeezed it with all that cold anger he’d found in her typically so warm brown eyes.
But Draco’s smirk only grew. “Harry Potter getting side-tracked—what a novel concept.”
He wasn’t scared of much anymore, not after living in the same home as Voldemort, not after all he’d seen and been forced to do. The old Draco Malfoy, the one who’d been too much of a coward to show up to his duel with Potter in First Year—that Draco had been yet another casualty of the war. But, still, old fears were hard to move past, especially if Lucius Malfoy was somehow involved.
There was a slight pause, and then Healer Preedan opened her mouth again, still looking unconvinced.
Harry nodded. “Totally. Hogwarts was like that for me. Still is, in a way. Do they have Houses in Ilvermorny, too?”
Besides, whatever irritation he might perceive, it was still just a trickle compared to the ocean of relief he’d felt after finally finding Harry in that muggle restaurant halfway across the city. And hate the man as he may, he had to hand it to Hayes, nonetheless—the bastard had good taste.
Healer Preedan repeated, “What is the last thing you remember? Before waking up just now.”
Draco kept staring ahead, but said finally, “My mother, to be perfectly honest.”
Harry felt like his world had just been rotated by 180 degrees. No no no, this wasn’t right, none of it was. Draco was at the Ministry, talking to Robards. He wasn’t—he couldn’t have—
Draco blinked, but before he could so much as open his mouth, Nic was nodding, wearing a grin so gigantic and bright it made Draco glad he’d forgone lunch. “Sure thing. Say around six?”
“So, wait, let me get this straight. Not only did you just stand there, watching me very nearly throw out my back, you also purposefully withheld the fact that I could do it all magically?”
Draco and Harry had a split second to jump apart, before the kitchen door flew open with a resounding bang and in marched one dishevelled but determined looking Ronald Weasley and one scowling, particularly terrifying Hermione Granger.
And then there was the whole convincing-Philomena-Craigs-not-to-hex-them-on-the-spot-business. Draco had only ever met the severe-looking shopkeeper a handful of times, when his father had brought him along after some back-to-school shopping over in Diagon. But even years later, he remembered how utterly terrifying the woman was, despite looking to be about a hundred. And Draco knew better than to think that particular impression had anything to do with the fact that he’d been a naive, easily intimidated child at the time.
Ron squeezed his fiancée’s hand, but his gaze was still on Harry. “You understand what I’m trying to say? These things have a habit of working themselves out. And if they don’t, so be it. But that doesn’t mean you can’t try. What’s the worst that could happen?”
Well.
, as you so expertly phrased it, ultimately resulted in his lifelong imprisonment, in case you haven’t heard.”
Only this time, he didn’t fight it.
something, something he was very decidedly not supposed to know—for Circe’s sakes, this was
The silence was as loaded and tense as the previous noise, and Draco didn’t dare breathe as he waited for a response, for a reaction.
Draco’s gaze shifted to the floor beside Harry’s bed, where a plate lay broken on the cherry-wood floor, what seemed to be a sandwich scattered in pieces of bread and cheese next to it. There was a piece of paper there, as well, and when Draco Accio’d it to his hand, he was surprised, yet simultaneously not at all, to find Hermione Granger’s neat scrawl imprinted there.
“Right then,” the blond finally said after what felt like an eternity. “Hungry?”
, who’d never once missed an opportunity to show how very poorly he thought of Draco—who’d asked Harry out on a sodding date, for Salazar’s sake!
. Then he gave me a pouch of gold, and I procured a vial of Acturin for him. You see, in my trade, one doesn’t oftentimes make small talk with the customers.”
Because that was basically it, the crux of the whole matter—
His soulmate.
Dimples, Harry realized, still dazed by the fact that he was apparently so out of it due to all this soulmate-shebang that he'd failed to notice a
“I don’t know your endgame, but I guarantee you there are other ways to go about it, better ways…”
, Potter. It means I like boys
“So, Malfoy,” he said, keeping his voice light in an attempt at civil conversation. “I heard you cracked that case on that illegal potions ring recently. They’re a tricky bunch from what I heard, having managed to stay under the radar for so long. So, yeah, err, good work.”
I hope you enjoyed the fluff of the last chapter, because, full disclosure, shit’s about to get real. (sorry in advance :))
.” At Harry’s telltale expression, the blond groaned into his hands. “
He could feel his heart racing, and he was sure Draco’s must be, too. But when the blond shifted forwards, his motions were so slow and calm you’d have never known, even as he leaned forwards until their noses were nearly touching—and then stopped.
“As a matter of fact—” Her eyes were like two slits of smouldering flame, a fire that was directed at Draco and Draco alone. “—I think that’d be rather hypocritical of you. Am I wrong?”
“Harry!” Hermione yelped, and her brown eyes went wide as they in turn took in his no doubt miserable appearance—and then instantaneously narrowed. “What are you
Eventually, though, Ron said quietly, “You don’t remember?”
It was as though everyone was holding their breath—Draco certainly knew he was—in apprehension of what she might say next. Her expression was utterly unreadable, and Draco’s heart almost gave out at least twice waiting for her to say the words that’d either make his day or forever cast an impregnable shadow over his life.
The others followed, even Ginny, although she very pointedly did not look anywhere near Harry as she passed him, with Hermione bringing up the rear, smiling even through her exasperated sigh. When she walked by Draco, she paused and offered him a tentative smile—a smile that, although a bit more cautiously, the Slytherin returned.
someone by now.
“Nothing, Potter,” Draco snapped. “Do at least try and remember the agreement, will you? I don’t bother you, you don’t bother me. It’s simple enough even you should be able to understand.” And without allowing himself another moment of indecision, he turned and strode out the door, all the while lamenting the horrid mess he’d gotten himself into.
“Salazar, Potter,” he huffed, dragging his heels. After all, he couldn’t have Harry thinking he’d gone soft or anything so demeaning. “You may have been discharged a full ten minutes ago, but I highly doubt Healer Hodkinson would appreciate you sprinting down the hallways like a maniac.”
believe that, something so wrong, so untrue—it made Harry’s heart break for the blond, break and melt all over again.
“Well, I am,” he snapped. “Sorry if I interrupted something.”
And so, quietly, all the while still smiling, he slipped out the door, and left Harry to his well-deserved rest.
Well.
It was all so incredibly bizarre, and yet at the same time also so very not.
Draco must have been able to read his expression, though, for his expression softened slightly and he said gently, “You do trust me, right?”
And so, instead, he reached for Harry’s hand, squeezing it once as those tragically green eyes met his, surprised. He smiled in response, then turned to Narcissa and said, “Mother, meet Harry. My soulmate.”
“No,” Harry agreed quietly, his throat suddenly tight, exasperation forgotten. “No, it doesn’t.”
His mother had been confused, to say the least, when a frantic, wide-eyed Draco clutching his right wrist as though it might fall off at any second sprinted through the Manor and into his room, not offering a single word of explanation before barricading himself in.
And be it the please or the genuine desperation in Draco’s eyes, but Harry snapped his mouth shut and gave a small, brusque nod. He never stopped glaring at the Slytherin, though.
Potter grimaced a bit at the title, which Draco had used on purpose, knowing how much he disliked it. Potter straightened up, but suddenly he looked a lot more embarrassed than Draco was comfortable with. An embarrassed Potter was never good, because then that in turn made Draco blush, and
“Oh, and guess what, Harry!” exclaimed Lavender, and Harry gave a start, only to look up to find Lavender’s brown eyes glowing. “Remember that role I flew to Dublin to audition for a few weeks back?”
The other part of it was Potter’s.
instead of simply wasting a minute or five gaping at the title, having a mild panic attack, and then Apparating directly to the ministry to more or less hysterically determine whether his father was or was not currently running free with a pack of deranged killers all harbouring a personal vendetta against not only the government Draco worked for, but
Everything hurt.
“Ron…,” he began wearily.
Harry shrugged and pulled a fork out of one of the kitchen drawers. “Suit yourself.”
Draco smiled carefully. “Oh. Thanks.” His eyes shifted to the floor, and he admitted quietly, “Baking always calms me, to be honest. Not that I’ve ever done it the muggle way before. Obviously. But…well. Mum’s always trying to protect me, and I love her for it. Only she seems to forget she might just need protection every once in a while, too.” That reminded Harry of what Robards and Hermione had told him when Draco was first assigned to his side, and he had to smile softly. It felt like an age had passed since.
But after watching Angelina lay on a makeshift bed of Silver Sparkling Snakes packages, huffing and wheezing while George sat by her side, one hand clasped tightly around hers as he repeated again and again ‘deep breaths, hun, you’re doing great’, his other hand gripping that of little Fred, who stood by just as helplessly as Harry, wailing and crying that his mummy was dying…
There was another pause, in which Hayes just stood there, looking in between the two of them, eyebrows still raised, while Draco simply glared at him and Harry—
those ideas—that was where things usually went tits up.
He pursed his lips and glared at the reddish-brown wood, at the golden name plate polished so meticulously he could see his own scowling face reflected back at him.
“Oh God, I’m so sorry about the other day,” he said. “I owe you an apology, Nic. Because, well, you see…Draco and I…me and Draco…the two of us—”
“Ginny, that’s
“No,” Draco said and shook his head. “No, I don’t think so. I’m not letting you off the hook, so spit it out.”
And be it that or the warmth of Draco’s skin against his or just the overwhelming knowledge that
He said it with a slight laugh, but it was entirely half-hearted and thus didn’t convince Draco in the slightest. Harry was still looking at Nic oddly, and he didn’t laugh either.
Calm, Harry reminded himself. Calm, calm, calm.
Not that Draco expected her to; Philomena might have stayed relatively neutral during the war, but it didn’t take Hermione Granger to be able to see the old hag’s game-plan had changed drastically over the course of the last three years.
“I don’t deserve you.”
“And nothing,” he choked out. “Nothing at all.”
Draco immediately relaxed again, and he rolled his eyes. “Oh yes, har har, call the Slytherin a bad influence. How very original. You know what I think? I think
But Pansy simply waved him off, unimpressed. “All the more reason to tell us about anything…
Because
in my year during Auror training—”
Except now it was obvious, and it made him so happy it was almost impossible not to break out into a colossal grin right then and there. Because Harry—oblivious, quick-tempered, fierce, brilliant, wonderful Harry—truly, genuinely
And then he looked over Takeuchi’s head, at the glass wall separating him and Takeuchi from Draco and Harry. The glass wall inlaid with so many enchantments and spells it should be absolutely impossible for him to see.
Harry nodded grimly. “Everything.”
Something twisted in Harry’s gut, something he neither could nor particularly wanted to place. So instead he said merrily, “Malfoy the Menace and Potter the Pest. Gotta admit, that has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?” He flipped another pancake, this time throwing it up into the air and catching it again with the spatula, whooping when it landed safely back in the pan.
to. Once you accept the bond, your magical cores are basically intertwined. On the one hand, this means more power. On the other hand, though, if one core is damaged, so is the other.”
“Harry.”
Harry had made it a point after that to use no magic whatsoever in the preparation of the meal.
Only, fuck it all to hell, that wasn’t true, and he knew it.
? Of course I know Heind! That study he did on the Death-Cap Draught was a gamechanger!” He found himself sizing up the bald-headed Auror more carefully, wondering how the hell the man had gotten
Harry made the same sort of surprised little gasp he had the evening before. But instead of freezing up, shocked and caught off guard, this time he kissed back immediately and without hesitation. His hands fisted around the collar of Draco’s shirt, pulling him closer closer closer, and the latter was more than happy to oblige, one hand on the counter behind Harry as he leaned in, the other at the back of the Gryffindor’s neck.
Potter snorted, yanking the article from Draco’s hands, but with hardly any real force. “Oh, sod off, Malfoy.”
Fucking
Ron frowned. “You sure? I really don’t mind—”
It really didn’t sound like a question, and just like that, the apprehension was back.

Blaise nodded seriously. “He does. Wouldn’t you agree, Healer Preedan?”
But Narcissa was right; she would never let him live this down. Really, Draco should have known this was coming. Not that that would’ve saved him.
at any second.
Draco’s smile dropped entirely.
But then Nic replied, “Mom stayed in New York. She…hasn’t been quite right, since Da—since Delia died. But my aunt’s taking care of her while I’m over here, so she’s doing as well as can be expected.” He said it with a tight smile, but Harry could hear the pain lacing his tone.
, with his usually-so-messy head of curls flattened against his head, retaining not a hint of their usual bounciness, and his green eyes especially radiant under the ghostly silver light of the moon. He had absolutely no
Draco was blinking rapidly, and Harry could have sworn his silver eyes twinkled brighter than usual. He cleared his throat again. “Harry…”
Harry was still unnaturally pale, and it was almost like someone had gone and dimmed his very essence, dimmed what was usually such a radiant glow until it was nothing but watery murkiness. But his eyes, his eyes had regained their usual brilliance, and at that moment they focused on Draco.
Draco shot him a quick narrow-eyed glance over his shoulder. “I’m going to go change out of these wretched wet eyesores. In the meantime, do me a favour, Potter, and don’t get yourself killed. Think you can manage that?”
If possible, Harry’s expression softened even more.
Also, yes, this chapter is loooooong, much more so than usual, but that’s due to the sheer amount of scenes I had to pack into it. Yes, I could have (and probably should have) split it in two, but I really didn’t want to, plus y’all deserve a humongous chapter for all your amazing and continuous support.
Draco was silent for a long moment. So long, in fact, that Harry started to think he wasn’t going to reply at all. Long, long moments ticked by, the playful mirth of the duel forgotten, the silence hanging in the air like smog.
at all. Draco had done the research; while very, very rare, unrequited soulmates did exist. Draco would never ever admit aloud, but he despised said second option with every fibre of his being.
. More so than Draco had ever expected, more so than should be possible—
! I fucking promise. Happy now, you sadistic tosser?”
Draco knew he ought to be annoyed with his friend, ought to glare and snap some intelligent yet scathing retort. And the time for that would come, he knew. But right now, right now all he could do was force air into his lungs and wrench his eyes away from a pair of emerald green ones and put on a calm, blasé and totally unaffected expression as he answered, “It’s definitely an improvement from your usual muggle clothes, if you can even call them that. But don’t let it go to your head, Potter—it’s big enough as it is.”
Finally, Yaxley said, “You really have no idea, do you? You’re done for already.” The man sounded a mixture between amused and hate-filled, and Draco clenched his jaw tighter.
“They can stay,” said Harry without hesitation.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, because that hadn’t been the deal and Draco knew it, the bloody git, but was rudely interrupted by the blond’s warning, withering glare.
Draco’s eyes finally interlocked with his, and although the unspoken words ‘you’re a moron’ coated his expression as thick as a like layer of varnish, Harry was also glad to see at least a bit of the tension in his posture seep away.
But he was Harry Potter, and so he should have known an evening of relaxation and cheerful conversation with his closest friends was simply too much to ask for.
. And here I thought boyfriends were supposed to be all loving and supportive. Serves me right for assuming, I guess.”
Harry did not flinch as he took in Yaxley, and his voice was even but brimming with hardly-repressed anger as he said, “Get up, now, hands behind your head, and don’t even think of putting up a fight, because I have my wand and you do not, and I assure you I have gotten a lot better at spell work since joining the Aurors.” The cold mercilessness of his words was so unexpected, so uncharacteristically Harry, especially as he continued, “Should you resist in any way, trust me when I say no one will shed any tears if I find myself forced to hit you with, say, an Entrail-Expelling curse.”
Draco, too, blinked, and just like that his shock morphed into blatant mortification, only to vanish again a second later as he schooled his features back into composure. “Yes, I…of course.” He scrambled off Harry so fast one might think Harry had some contagious disease. The way the blond very determinedly would not look anywhere near him when Harry stood as well only served to further underline that theory.
Actually, no, scratch that—Draco knew exactly
And just like that Draco knew exactly what the matter was.
“Holy shit,” he breathed, and Draco laughed, a bit of the tension seeping from his shoulders as he did. The sound was mesmerising, as was the grin playing across his face.
But, all things considered, better. Healthier.
“I should tell you something,” said Draco finally, voice impossibly gentle yet tense at the same time, and Harry couldn’t help but squeeze his hand tighter. Draco squeezed back without hesitation, but then continued, “I probably should have told you this a long time ago. I suppose I was just too afraid. Scared how you might react. To be perfectly honest, I’m still scared how you might react. But after almost losing you today, I’ve realised…well, I
He’d expected it, and yet expecting didn’t make it any less horrifying when the name
But, no, that was definitely Draco Malfoy barrelling towards them through the restaurant. But not the regal, elegant version of him Harry’s traitorous mind had conjured up only moments prior—this one looked a lot less elegant and a lot more manic, not to mention twice, no, triple as scary.
But then, eventually, she sighed, glower softening into a mildly irritated frown. “You’d better, Harry. I mean it.” But the words lost all their menace when she once again wrapped her arms around her would-be victim, pressing her face into Harry’s neck and said, “But I’m really glad you’re not dead, too.”
“But I—”
“Mr. Potter, I don’t think—” began Healer Preedan cautiously in a tone one might use to talk to a small child on the verge of a temper tantrum.
“Did you know you’re beautiful?”
At the sound of his name, Harry looked up, as did Draco—only to find a brown-haired man standing before their table, blue eyes fixed on Harry, a small, shy smile stretched across his face. Draco didn’t recognize him at first, thinking this must surely be another of the Saviour’s fans.
