Professors had names in case things went bad but it was some trust those said names were given, so there wasn’t any proper authoritarian figure neither minding this kind of party nor being physically present. Some perks of being in an expensive private school.
“Are you kidding?!” Pansy erupted in the exchange, after taking a small drag she kept going with a nasal voice, “Don’t thank us, we looked so fucking cool, we were like the fucking Matrix cast!” she released the smoke by her nostrils.
“What? I’m really not-” Marigold’s voice pitched higher, feigning offense.
“Oi, not my fault we don’t have the same schedule, okay?! And you’re friends with her now? I wouldn’t trust her with driving; you never know what she’s been do-”
Everybody felt bad for bringing back the pain she had hard time to get a rid of.
“Ugh, Ron, I told you at least five times already. He just wanted to chat,” Liar “and to know if he had to keep 24/7 an eye on me so I wouldn’t make anything that would cost me my place at Hogwarts, or something.” Another lie.
Ron looked the most uncomfortable, not knowing how to handle something like this or which side to take if there was even a side to take in the first place.
cupboard under stairs?? who tf even does that??? i promise to never let you sleep in some broom closet or anything like that. i’d fight anybody who’d suggest such silly thing (ง'̀-'́)ง
“How are you feeling?” the worry in Blaise’s voice was genuine. She checked on Pansy and Theo, quietly smoking and chatting in the background, politely ignoring the two friends but ready to blend in the conversation if needed.
“Gosh who’s the lucky friend now? Love ya love ya love ya !!!” he only heard the last sentence in a fading kind of way as the jet black-haired girl was already almost running to where the music was coming from, which brought a soft smile on his lips.
The slender girl harshly elbowed him in the ribcage, “Don’t even begin, or I shall kill you before your next breath reaches your lung.”
She had just a few meters left of walking in the main corridor, and then she would take several turns and arrive in front of the steps leading to the astronomy tower. Her phone buzzed. She took a quick glance, willing to ignore anybody that it could be right now.
“And one last thing;” his voice turned in a threatening tone, now coming clearly to her ears, “McLaggen, noting happened.”
Once reaching the center of the room, near the music booth, she saw exactly what she had expected while running to the spot.
She failed.
“Oh sorry, Mari, I’ve tried to be as silent as possible I didn’t want to wake you up, sorryyy.” Dean looked at her with an apologetic face, his hands clasped together.
Looking back, it was fun. Trading bedrooms every two days, never facing the same person twice in the morning, she would go to sleep with Ron and Hermione, all of them sharing one of the large beds, to wake up with Luna just besides her, and Ginny on the floor.
The boys followed the conversation as some Roland Garros tennis’s exchanges.
Everybody began to clap in sync to the beginning of the lyrics, positioning themselves to dance on the has-been but catchy song.
Hermione looked at her and rolled her eyes, again.
So basically, Severus in here is not a dick and abusive adult. it's like responsible!Severus you know. he's the only good father figure Fulvia gets and their relationship is precious to me bc they're both awkwards.
Fulvia's mind is precious but fragile and fickle.
There was a narrow path between two full bookshelves with a narrower staircase, turning few times before the last steps stopped to a dark wooden door.
As some chuckles were heard, she kicked her high heels off on the stage, and pulled at the ribbon holding her dress with one hand, still struggling to keep her bag as it was forcefully being dragged away from her with the other one.
“Don’t.”
She knew that, she even knew he was by far the person who had the most concern about her life; her proper father figure. The efforts he may have been through to get her a new room was only one of the numerous proofs for it. And in retrospect, it always had been her godfather that got her presents, interests and attentions with real sentimental value.
Overthinking has a name, Marigold Jamie Potter.
It just hit her. And not like an apple falling down a tree and landing on her head. More like a semi truck running over her body.
“Awww, lookit you being all cheesy-”
Her voice resonated again over the gathering.
They both chuckled.
“No! Err no, it’s okay; I was in my head that’s why I- Well never mind. No I changed my shifts, I no longer work on the Sunday nights.” Marigold stepped out of her bed to look for her phone that had been catapulted somewhere in the room, so she would have to do something and not stare at Hermione with awkwardness.
Potter went first and dabbed at Fulvia eyebrow, with more strength than it was necessary and made her flinch and wince.
“Fuck off.”
“I don’t know man, but I miss him-”
She silenced her phone by putting the ‘do not disturb’ mode after her last text, laid down her phone on the nightstand and adjusted her body in the no longer cool sheets.
Why was she even trying to defend Potter again? She couldn’t remember.
wealthy family, you know what I mean, right? It could be a good thing. What does his mother do again?”
they both thought. Hermione usually didn’t stutter this much, or at all for that matter, neither she hesitated when she needed to say something.
She rolled up her eyes at her own reaction.
On the same wall the entrance was in, there were a massive angle desk and then a library closing the space in a U shape extending one of the alcove walls and shielding the bed space from the entrance point of view. Again, reassuring and comforting enough in a way.
“Don’t say that. I told you plenty of times; you never overreact, it’s just you gotta work on the communication skills afterwards reacting to the situation. I’m sorry and messed up and stressed you out, it’s just that right now, I’m... I don’t know. It’s hard.”
Marigold didn’t want to admit the fact she was now more than interested in the rest of the story, but with Dean’s last remark she was too prideful to sound eager for the next part of his gossips. But as soon as he talked, she regretted not saying anything.
Actually, she was not the only one; it had been a thing between Potter and her since the day they met.
She recognised it. She recognised him.
Also, Blaise is the only one allowed to tease Fulvia, like he can make her live hell if he wants but the minute someone else just even tries to annoy her, it's the end of the ride.
That was basically how she had spent the following days, dissociating and letting her occupations control her day-life like a routine.
Her sobs were now howl-like desperate wails escaping from under the covers, echoing between the blank walls of her dark room.
The professor screaming her name in warning had now almost reached the turn of the corridor. But nobody minded it, they were mesmerised by the sight. In their defence, the half naked girl with the sun kissed skin was glowing as if she had previously fell in pool of oil; every curves and muscles shinned and glimmered under the light of the corridor.
Yet, she couldn’t break out of her sleep and open her eyes. She tried to sink some more.
The ride had been pretty silent but comforting at first, reassuring in a way. The man couldn’t help but feel uneasy thinking about the last time he had had to drive her somewhere.
From the very end of the corridor, a name was loudly called, firstly indistinct, then when listening more carefully you could made out it was an infuriated man repeating a name louder and louder as he was approaching, “MiSs POtTEr!”
[1:29AM]
Her aunt remained silent until now, she cut Fulvia’s sentence with a cuss as she took in all the information.
Fulvia was glad for the shift of attention. Her phone buzzed and she saw a new text appear on her screen.
Said girl was now nowhere to be seen, and the student that had helped with the demonstration was now doing push-ups from his former position as to show a method of exercising, clenching the fabric of the dress and sponged himself with it as he would with a towel.
“Oh, I see. So, this is what it is really about. I see now. How caring of you.” The last sentence conveyed more sarcasm than the whole Daria cartoon TV show.
“Sorry, you know what I meant, it’s just, you won’t tell me what happened and I can’t understand why you’re so resentful of her and I’m your friend and-”
She turned her head in the shout’s direction, and saw her friends already settled down at one of the Gryffindor’s table. She walked toward them and joined the conversation already going on while taking some food from the plates and putting it on her tray, something about the next and very first test in chemistry class.
Fulvia flinched and turned to see who had joined her in this isolated corner; people really
he knows about the hospital bills and I know too
“Language... I’d gladly do so but I’m too busy ignoring both of you, sorry.” Hermione took a bite of her food and looked away.
“Sevs, I’m alright, there’s no need to-” she tried to escape from the affectionate grip and he hesitantly let go. She tried a confident smile but his brows were still knotted in a frown as he inspected her, his lips forming a thin line.
“Okay, so hm. I don’t really know how to ask that. See, I have this
She rolled on her back at the sound of Hermione’s voice but kept her eyes shut.
Rapidly, she noticed she was not the only one intrigued by Potter’s outfit; the latter seemed to have bewitched both the gathering and the other clubs’ members, even Blaise had his mouth slightly hanging in the void. Knowing him, it was likely to be more about the boldness of Potter more than for her
She also spotted Malfoy’s pack at some point, thinking, still bitter, she’d never see them to this kind of event and reminding her of the sour pain that the earlier realisation had brought to her heart.
Fortunately, the head master chose this moment to make a public announcement, giving Fulvia enough to pull her act together and, once everything in her vision was steady again, she plainly fled from the room without being followed by Blaise, Pansy or Theo. She needed some alone-time; they were kind and respectful enough to understand that.
She could hear Blaise’s voice on top of her own, helping her with counting the seconds between every deep breath.
“NO! Not at all! I just love to rummage randomly into people’s belongings and judge them for their tidying skills because you know I’m that bitch!” he deadpanned.
“Hey,” Hermione looked up at the call, “it’s gonna be okay Mione, don’t worry about it. You don’t have to meddle in; I know you don’t like that.” Marigold warmly smiled at her, which Hermione returned, a little bit uneasy. She wanted to believe her friend, but alas, drama seemed to always follow their group like their shadow.
“Don’t look at me like that. Of course I’m worried about you!”
[1:43AM]
“Aren’t you supposed to be on my side?! You know sister-code and all?”
She’d won. Duh.
“Yeah, haha, mood. What’s up with the ankle and the hair, gorgeous?”
“Mari, look,”
She’d apathetically brushed her teeth after leaving reluctantly her warm cocoon, and got fully dressed.
“Oh because you’re any different?” his tone was light but he wouldn’t meet her eyes. Marigold knew it was because he had instantly regretted saying those words, knowing Ginny was in the room with them, as a silent spectator. Still, it hurt a bit, just a bit on top of everything else.
“No, please go; it would only make me feel worse to know you’ve missed a meeting already by my fault.”
Anyway, back to her self-care routine.
Once there, Professor Lupin opened the door and indicated the room with his chin, meekly suggesting for them to go in, which they did.
“Sorry, didn’t mean it,” she impishly answered to which the professor deeply sighed in disapprobation.
[2:14AM]
and we talked like i thought i did something wrong
[9:29AM]: Everything is good I swear. Better if you know it now, like, you have a whole week to digest the fact you gonna sleep on the ladies restroom’s floor
Ginny considered for few minutes her position, and, with an infernal grin, locking her eyes in her brothers’ sank even further in Dean’s laps.
“Monopolizing everybody’s interest I mean. She’s basically the most hetero bitch out there that I know attract so much people. Come on don’t look at me like that,” his voice took a tone of false outrage, “you know exactly what I mean. She only had to jump on the stage without her uniform and what, smile, and all the assembly sighed out of admiration. What is so good about her?” he added with a wink and laugh in his voice.
“So? France doesn’t change a thing; it does not make it less illegal.” Marigold had a point and she knew it, “At least here we know how it’s made and all you see?”
It rang once, twice. She took several puffs of her cig. It rang again and again. She hung up. Tried again. Lit up another cigarette. Hung up again. On the fourth try she finally reached the other end of the line.
His mother had assured him she ate pretty well during her stay, but he also knew the tricks his best friend could use when she didn’t feel like taking care of herself.
Pure venom, Marigold was taken aback.
“Oh, fuck you, bitch boy!” she scoffed, “see what I mean?” as Fulvia phone screen turned into a facetime request.
Fulvia couldn’t bring herself to return the glares she would eventually get from Potter as she just wanted to be left alone and go through a eventless last year of school.
Here are the statements she could make: said club was the athletics, regrouping the ‘Slug Club’ track team as she recognised its members; there wasn’t any professor as supervisor/chaperon which was weird after attracting so much students and being far from the other clubs.
They sat on the bed, her new bed in fact, and they were glancing at each other silently, cross legged – the ankle support making it more difficult – on the mattress. She observed once again the room and its disposition.
She knew she had half the responsibilities for this interruption of thoughts but couldn’t help the not so gentle words and tone that came with the pain in her leg. She still reached for the girl’s arm and help her to stand, but regretted it in the very moment she did.
“Here, look for the Loyalty number, the one with the tie and dye wings. You know, that wouldn’t be an issue if you let your stuff to the club. You even have your own room there! That would be so much easier,” he saw the annoyed glance of a recurring conversation passing in her eyes, “Or not, I’m just saying.”
It was the second Friday since they came back to school; Neville, Luna and Ginny were eating at the Hufflepuf’s table so it was just the so called Golden Trio eating at the Gryffindor’s.
“Hydra? Are you alright, love?”
“So you see her too, right?” her tone was flat, “My eyes aren’t messing about with my brain? It’s not a bloody joke from fate isn’t it? Ron punch me please, I wanna be sure.” She turned towards him, a desperate grimace showing on her face.
She tried something else, something that would make him drop the subject, “Thank you for the car by the way! Blaise only bumped into three walls and two trees.” She added with an authentic cheeky smile. She had guessed right, Severus’s frown morphed in an unbothered blank face knowing she was messing about with him.
[3:24PM]
“What?! The further I am from her, the longer I will be in peace. There’re only unnecessary issues coming at us when she’s involved.”
“Hey, it’s okay, Sevs. I’m not blaming you for anything that happened, and your help is more than welcome and you’ve already done so much. I’m just not ready right now to seriously think about...” she gestured vaguely at her loss of words, “all this.”
Her vision became darker and blurrier, her perceptions stumbling over each other, alien voices entering her mind but refusing to make sense. She once again slammed their foreheads together finally breaking free from the bite and giving her time to regain the control of her thought.
As she entered the Great Hall, she repressed the shivers coming down her spine and adjusted her stance.
Ron only responded with a cold frown.
“Oh, and, Miss Potter?”
An uncomfortable silence followed. Dumbledore had an impish expression, implying he yet waited for Fulvia to carry on, except she didn’t know what it was about. The feeling of awkwardness grew more and more.
A fifth year was assuring Malfoy had left Hogwarts for good, whereas a sixth year swore she could sense Malfoy’s ghost every night in their common room hunting down the ones who didn’t behave properly and shamed the name of the Slytherin house. But what struck the brunette the most was what a boy had said – he should know, his father work at the Foreign Office with Malfoy’s father – something about Malfoy losing some of her hair and that he didn’t know the reason of it. She imagined for a second the untouchable white-blonde girl finally reaching the human level of stress and losing hair from it.
“Thank you, that’s my new expensive liquid soap.” Fulvia faced the other boy, “Where’s Pansy?”
Years ago, she had found one of Sirius’s old pictures of when he and his friends – whom her father was part of – were hanging out here. Thus, the shop must have been older than the Palaeolithic era.
She stalled as much as she could but eventually, she would have to face up at some point.
They all spoke at one time.
And she’s just wearing a hoodie and a jacket. Like life didn’t have to try this hard.
That’s when Remus reacted and crawled back into his former position of the adult and Marigold’s guardian.
“Woah, thanks, big boost for my ego right now.”
“See, Goyle, I’d love to exchange with you about the relativity of time because I’m sure I bumped into you few days ago, but unfortunately I have places to be. So, if you’ll excuse me...” she tried a polite smile.
Then she felt the mattress move, a new text appeared on the lock screen.
“Well, you know... I’m sure his wealthy family would be more than happy to seal a contract with
There was a bunch of messages from yesterday and this morning she hadn’t opened yet. Sirius, Sirius, Sirius, Ron, Dean, Dean, Sirius, Parvati, Sirius, Sirius, Sirius, Sir- ugh, he’d answer to him later but still opened the others’ ones. Some new memes, ideas for work, and her weekly meeting reminder for a tarot session she had asked to come and consult tonight.
“It’s fine!” she ignored the long-winded speech about her health, knowing he wouldn’t drop the subject until she resolved herself to see an actual therapist. “Don’t worry. Just because my body had a weird sudden reaction there was no need for all of this...” after a tight blank she added, “I appreciated it though, thank you guys.”
Mark answered, his face buried in a pile of paperwork trying to find something between all the mess she assume his desk was under.
With Malfoy not being missing, the first years were not traumatised yet. They knew what to expect by now, hearing all sorts of evil tales coming from the older years.
Even with the glasses help, it was hard to make out who was that person; there wasn’t so much hair and it was easy to establish his body shape.
She watched – tried to watch – the person walk away in a limping demeanor, and without her glasses on, she could only see a slander, all black dressed, ivory skinned human form putting back their hood on and getting away from her.
“I don’t have any idea what you’re going on about?” she chuckled, genuinely puzzled, “Are you challenging me, Weasley number two? You know I can take you.”
Unimpressed, she smiled wider and stood even straighter, ready to end them and make them sorry about the sole day they entered this world for it was now personal.
For Seamus and Dean, I know it's not very in their usual characters but I decided to go with soft but still awkward Seamus and Dean who is pretty timid out of his friends group but once with them he's really that sweetheart always joyful and cheering ppl up and like great activist of LGBTQI+ rights and all being part of it.
“Yeah, whatever Saint Potter.”
“You already ate?” Blaise’s tone claimed to be nonchalant, but Fulvia wasn’t fooled.  She knew he was worried about her and looked out for her; still, she tried to control her furrowed brows.
“One minute you’re destroying your ex-girlfriend and the very next you’re hitting on me! And so you know, just because she won’t cover her face under I don’t know how many layer of concealer or something else, doesn’t mean you can act like she’s trash. At least, pretend to have a bit of respect for a fellow woman when you talk to one. That’s the basic decency of humanity.”
“That’s good, right? What does he want? He wants to see you?” Theo asked.
She saw the name
She curled up against the stone wall.
“Hermione you’re no help right now...” said Marigold with an afflicted tone, turning towards her other best friend.
(See the end of the chapter for
No, scratch that, what she had thought the majority of her life actually.
She waited for the young girl to lock her pale grey eyes, redden by the crying, in hers and added, “You know, I could stay here with you tonight-”
She took back her purse, slipped her feet in some sneaker her friends had threw besides her, passed the strap on her shoulder and turned towards the crow, “See you on Monday practice!”
“My office, now.”
“So that’s it, you’re in love with a fuckboy.”
She looked one last time in her friend’s eyes and with the help of her left hand settled on the wooden table, she span her upper body towards where everybody was looking. There was a bunch of Slytherins crossing the Great Hall toward their own table – maybe because of a chemistry AP course they had to eat after everybody or something.
He tried not to be too explicit about the reasons why, as he’d shot down any facial expressions and managed to remain blank.
[7:17PM]
Her fingers stopped on a cardboard box still sealed with sellotape. So,
gently, she would convince her brain to just, turn off or something, so she wouldn’t have to witness the shitty mess that was her life anymore.
“So what now, you’ll stick with me until the end of my guard turn.”
It has been quite a while it hadn’t popped in her feed, so she had forgot about it. She had followed the account because of a certain person working for this very agency.
Nevertheless, he took advantage of the fact Hermione was bent toward her notes to discretely shake Marigold’s hand while whispering to her, “That’s on.” adding a wink.
knew something about irresponsible grown up men?
She now knew what was off the first time she tried to identify the boy, uh girl.
Luna interjected, “So, can I?”
She’d grabbed her backpack and her earphones before rushing as much as she could with a twisted ankle down the stairs.
[10:24AM]
Marigold shoved her dormmate with her feet trying to throw her off from the bed, making Hermione falling down.
[3:21PM]
“I know, and I knew why you were acting like that. But I was expecting more from you, out of all people, to have the maturity to come talk to me instead of literally barking at me for two weeks straight!”
As the party was officially open to both the seventh years and the sixth years, the students in charge were extremely careful and kept their eyes on everybody’s drinking quantities, plus, some fifth years had break in and were lost in the crowd as soon as spotted.
With a bright grin she challenged him, whispering, “Twenty bucks they’re fucking right now.”
“No, no not at all. You don’t know him, but that’s not important. He is in trouble with his... parents actually. They- well, his father is hm- his father, I think we call that abuse? I’m not sure but-” she couldn’t help but choke on her words, her throat was so tight, she could feel her eyes tingling, “he’s suffering from his father’s mental abuse and phy- I think physical abuse, like domestic violence? I don’t know if it’s called like this-”
Like a cold embrace, but at the same time, the warmest thing she had ever felt deep in her guts.
Only few knew the self-care routine Marigold had for her person. Not that it was something important or substantial to know. This knowledge just implied to be also aware of what made her take this special time. Indeed, apart from a closed group of individuals – in other word her friends – nobody knew about her side life.
everything will be fine.”
“Funny how you treat her now when all those past year, during the saga of your sexual awakening, y’all tried desperately to climb her bed. And not only her bed, you crept around her and thought y’all were so subtle about it.” Marigold rolled her eyes at the forced irony, even it hurt her to admit in public she was aware of Cormac’s cheating attempts.
Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott had been
Also, Dean and she indeed worked at the same place even though once there, they acted as they didn’t know each other – hated each other even –  when they were to cross the other’s shift. And they knew load of shit in sexy dance moves.
Chileeee
“None taken,” Marigold sheepishly answered with a bitter taste in her mouth, the coffee having nothing to do with it “come on, don’t stall, tell me what this meeting is really about, Moony.”
“Are you a Cullen?” her mouth blurted out. She got flat out ignored, not even sure she actually said it.
It was sure disturbing, seeing Malfoy’s pack without their chief, their leader, their guru or whatever Malfoy was to them.
She changed in her uniform and tried to arrange her hair which was more of a fur than proper hair. She took off her lenses after a quick shower and put the old round glasses back on her nose. She then looked at her reflexion in the mirror; her mid-thigh length skirt was a bit crinkled, she wore high socks in a pair of faded red Converses, her white shirt had the three first buttons opened – she didn’t like it when it was almost tight around her breast, so she always wore oversized button shirts she messily tucked in her skirt. The thin and long black robe they had for when the weather was pretty warm fell just over her ankles whereas others had them around their calf length. Damn her shorty-blood.
As she stalled to take it, he insisted “Here, Fulvia.”
Theodore Nott was another matter, he was more of a true-lone-wolf and he usually came and went with the three Slytherins, not that she cared.
Dumbledore suddenly began speaking after sharply showing up to his emplacement.
“What? You didn’t tell him? Haven’t you, like, kept in touch with him this summer?” Pansy was truly puzzled.
. She relaxed her body at this realisation. Blaise must have noticed the tension leaving her, “Fulvia? You’re back? Vee? Hey? What happened? Where did you go? Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four. Come on, breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four.”
“Oh, okay thanks, I did too much, then, I think. Never mind,” she checked her texts on her phone, she lifted her head and smiled at Hermione, “Sure, I’ll just go and get my business done with Patil and Brown. You can leave it on my bed or my bed side table; I’ll read it before sleeping.”
After a long week of boring classes and hard homework, it was all she could dream of. She would lay down a bit, letting the foam covering her up to her chin, the liquid diffusing heat as she let herself dive gently in a slow process that helped relax her muscles.
“Looking up Naruto’s hand signs techniques is not a hobby.”
“Hey, back off now!” he scowled at her, “For one, you don’t work the same days as I do, so you won’t drive me. Second, I know you have beef against her, and I don’t know why since you won’t tell me, but she’s a delight to me okay? She’s the one who’s proposing every time!”
“You were not all against that this summer at my godfather’s.” responded Marigold, smiling devilishly.
Then Neville followed, speaking softly, “Of course there’re always tiny risks, but we took enough precautions in order to not being caught.”
Then, she eventually took her tray and walked towards the wall, a bit farther and hidden from the tables, where the trays were discarded. She turned to leave once and for all the Great Hall but collided with something, well, someone.
Her friends didn’t push by following her as they knew she sometimes needed alone-time, and today more than never. So once Marigold was out of shout-reach she dropped the fake smile she had keep not to worry them and slowed her pace.
Potter was dating. Anyway, regardless of the words spoken, the first hit connected with her cheek and threw her off balance. It also proceeded to anger her as it was uncalled for. Fulvia hit her in turn, landing a good right in the nose, still ignoring the noise around her.
Before the cornered girl could answer, Ron followed, “Wait-wait-wait, you follow her on instagram?! Like with your main account and all?!”
She could only mouth a poor “thanks” through the quiet sobs.
did u try to call him instead?
“Mari! Over there!”
“Speaking of clothes, Luna told me earlier the outfits for the presentation of the athletic team later in the afternoon had arrived in the cloakrooms.”
She was about to close her bathroom door when she caught Blaise’s worried eyes, “What?”
There was an eccentric satisfaction to get to see the old Malfoy back to her incensed self, finally responding to Marigold’s provocations as she used to, not pretending to be too good to show this side of her anymore. The familiar fuzzy feeling of savagery breaking free after layers and layers of frustration meeting the same wave of wrath, colliding together into sheer chaos and unhinged violence.
Once Hermione’s brown eyes came back to meet Marigold’s green ones, there was a sort of unspoken plea coming from her telling her friend not to look back and not taking any interest of whatever was happening just behind her back.
“Ginny!” Ron tried.
The feeling of wrongness grew more and more by the look both Hermione and Ron wore; like worry-ness or apprehension.
wanna tell me how did it go w/ Gandalf the White today? ain’t gonna pressure you or anything if you don’t wanna...
“Ashamed?!” The young girl repeated, “Oh, I surely ain’t as I need to keep preciously every single drop of shame for when I have to be around you in public.” She ended her sentence with the sweetest smile she could offer.
Remember when I promised you I wouldn’t let you live under staircases or a broom closet and all??
Something, reality she thought at first, collided with her body. It happened quickly, harshly, suddenly. One minute she remained still, her feet stuck on the corridor cobblestones, the next, her phone flew on the ground and she had a hard time maintaining her balance as she was forced to take several steps back due to the shock.
“Chill, mate, breathe,” She spoke, addressing the gathering of friends around the table now, “I’m not the one breaking it to you.” Ginny went back to poking her plate.
was a piece of shit. I swear I’m gonna-” his voice broke and he averted his eyes.
“Well, take care then.” A polite but strict small smile on his lips, the Slytherin boy closed an arm around Fulvia and walked out, bumping his shoulder in the other boy’s one.
“Ouh, it’s getting kinky.”
“Thanks Jimmy, I could no longer feel my arm.”  She smiled at him before taking the shot and walking away, trying to keep it steady with the high heels.
Not one text but three, actually.
In the meantime for her vision to adjust she examined the scenery that remained blurry until the attempt of any facial recognition came to be fruitful.
“Yeah, bullshitting award goes to him without any doubt. But anyway, we were both equally fooled by his act this summer. I mean, the fact he was away for work didn’t help but, hey.”
Sirius isw ear im so sos o so sorry
Hermione grabbed it and tried to hide the fact she was relieved the discussion had lasted only few minutes, ashamed of being put in front of the fact that she’d rather go back to her homework than keep trying to resolve dramas that kept coming and going lately.
“Well, for those parts I’m glad to know everything is more under control. But I was wondering if you had time to reflect on the suggestion the professor Snape gave you, what I also mentioned?”
“Gosh, you’re sweating. Are you alright? I’m sorry, I should have known better. I- I can’t still realise that I can be a factor of danger to you I’m sorry, I love you. I’d never want to hurt you. I’m sorry
Which was strange from them, did they found a new god to worship between periods, or the four of them happened to walk in the same direction but, like, together? Because there was sure a sort of cohesion between the four of them.
“How was practice today, aren’t you going to be super sore and aching if you’re staging today?”
The last sentence sounded like a suggestive request. He was now the one asking for forgiveness by offering all the support she needed. She understood that. She knew he felt responsible and she felt sorry for him, she didn’t want him to blame himself.
[9:26AM]
“So back to the former subject of this afternoon gathering; namely Marigold being allegedly threatened for no other reason but Malfoy being back among the mortals.” She added, changing the topic of their conversation.
“Mm-hm. Do you have everything you need?”
They locked eyes; Malfoy’s being all shades of storm clouds, making Marigold shiver in turn, then, the girl was gone with a dismissive slur.
Little did she know this actually was about to make her day worse.
She then lay on her back; her arms stretched and tried to think of what happened at lunch without crying. She knew her friends were angry at her for messing with her own health, she knew they were just worried about her well being and her capacity to treat herself right. Her poor choice of decisions could totally explain the worry they had. From her last boyfriend – anyway she wasn’t thinking about Cormac right now; fuck him – and her secret side job, and a bunch of other things she was supposed to be underage for.
“What have you come here for uh?” she took a false-pitying voice, adding, “somebody was lacking in self confidence today and decided it would be a great turn to make fun of a person that had cared for you in the past?” she now mollified her voice, “Who’s the good jock? Who’s the good trash mouth uh? It’s you, yeah it’s you!” she stepped in front of Potter, locking her eyes in the boy’s, their forehead almost touching. “You’d be kind to go fuck yourself before you’ll make a fool out of you. So gently fuck off, roam the room and go see elsewhere if somebody misses your fragile masculinity.”
She caught sight of Dean and Seamus slowly waltzing in a less crowded spot. They’d stop the choreography and their choice of atmosphere detonated with the music.
“Is it my knitted sweater you’re wearing?”
but then the subject drifted and he told me you hadn’t answered some of his texts for a while during the summer and it was weird because first of all you didn’t see each other at all for a while and normally that doenst’ even happen
“You don’t know what you’re talking about scarred piece of fat. A bitch like you better shut up.”
Even if she would not admit it, Hermione thought it had its perk to be obsessed with Malfoy, Marigold could catfish her flawlessly, by the tone and also the edgy cold attitude.
Ginny is feral, and I'm not sorry for it. I would be too, feral, if I were the youngest sibling, only girl of her family. She knows how to fight and have some character. She doesn't like her friends messing themselves up.
“And it truly aims at making our students safer. If we can’t stop what aggregate immorality we shall at least together learn a way of protect ourselves and others. It is what community mindset means to me, to us, and I hope, soon, to you.”
glad to hear it. Sflr we were watching a movie and my phone was dead.
After going through a rush of unpleasant feelings in such a short time span, Blaise had come to help her, once again. In times like that, it always felt like a tormented ocean was washing her away, and he was her lighthouse, guiding her back to reality.
“Bella,” she sighed, “it’s
She emitted a silent snort, “Breaking news, my hairstyle doesn’t speak for my sexual orientation, welcome to the twenty first century guys.”
She hardly had slept three hours when she’d stepped down the platform with only her school rucksack and a duffel bag containing the stuffs she couldn’t let at Blaise’s.
She was free to come and go but remained extremely careful not being seen when she had to leave the school because of the prefects, but their guard duties ended before her return anyway.
She couldn’t believe it belonged to her. Dumbledore had mentioned nothing of the sort.
Luna tried to intervene, but her sweet voice was no use.
There was a blank.
She found it, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott; so she didn’t understand her friend’s reaction at first – but wait a minute – after analysing their body language, it wasn’t just a moving formation of three persons, they seemed to follow a new guy – his tie to the Slytherin colours – who was walking at the same pace, a little bit ahead of them.
“What’s wrong? Are you safe? Do you need money? I haven’t had any news from your mother in a while but I assumed everything was doing fine. Is it not the case?”
night. He would kill any single soul attempting to harm her. And he would kill
[3:02PM]
We need to talk.
– grabbed the hem of her duvet and removed it from her face. She was done for.
pshhh what a princess
She marked a significant pause, threw back her hair with the help of her hand even though it wasn’t in the way at all. “Bitch, I was only sent to this school to step on the Drama Queen throne Sirius left me. If she tries to take it away from me, he will hear about this.”
“Well, it’s not a proper meeting actually,” she searched her words and added “more of a ‘you’re-in-my-way-move-or-face-the-consequences-of-the-collision-thanks-to-the-gravitation-law’ kind of meeting, so...”
Her ankle throbbed, her chest tightened, her look was distraught, she couldn’t see nor feel clearly what was happening around her.
She would be lying if she told she didn’t think about this at least once a day, but however, the school ground was calmer since no fight had been witnessed between the two of them, so basically none at all.
In retrospect, it had never been like that when she still was with Cormac, nor even near this state of smug happiness.
Both boys and girls were focused on something happening behind Marigold’s back – she was not facing the Great Hall’s doors.
Blaise scoffed while Fulvia eyeballed him, visibly disconcerted. Pansy’s eyes left the screen of her phone for a hot second, “You follow her?
As for Marigold, her work shifts didn’t bother school schedule at all for it was essentially night shifts and she was pretty well paid – and her school fees were handled by her godfather.
The green eyed girl was speechless. Something in her stomach broke and her insides filled up with something both freezing and burning at the same time, regardless of whatever had happened yesteryears.
He had taken the habit to make fun of her and to belittle her as much as he could, minus all the time she had echoes of cheating material. She knew that at that time but had remained with him until it was unbearable.
Unfortunately the skinny boy was sitting while facing down the table with her face, only his perfect light eyebrows and the straight line of a nose showing, a heavily ringed, fair-skinned hand covering/supporting half of his face.
“Yeah that was pretty much the big idea, as Ron already left with Hermione for another duty – he should be glad she’s patient enough to keep him company and follow him around, Jimmy has taken my place and Ginny has Luna and Nevs keeping her company. That makes me think, where is Thomas? I couldn’t find him all night long, and I pretty much physically roamed the room.”
She changed in her uniform and Blaise helped her to do her hair.
It’s not that Malfoy’s hair was shorter, well it definitely was. But it was not in a bob or cute pixie way.
She marked a dramatic pause in her speech that reluctantly made Fulvia’s hair rise and only made her hate more Potter for that. Once again everybody was listening carefully to what the latter girl was saying.
“How much did you felt like dying out of boredom?”
fyi some kids were using it at school and i wanted to try.
“I- You know it’s something I’m working on! Listen, I’m sorry, I was scared fir myself and I overreacted.”
[1:52AM]
She too, would get sacrificed if need, no doubt about it.
Fights between their own friends group and Potter’s one were really a weekly event since their very first year attending this school, from just loud words to throwing hands in the middle of the corridors. Generally it happened between periods and on a basis of 1v1 but it also happened by the past, when it involved Cormac, Potter and Fulvia for example, that more people found themselves in the middle of a fight.
Fuck this day, fuck this life, fuck the world.
Progressively, as she listened to the girl, Marigold felt her legs go lighter and lighter and it was difficult to feel properly the insides of her own mouth. She still tried to hold her ground while facing the other girl’s harsh answer.
They had followed all the choreography construction as well as the two teenagers after all.
She obviously very much regretted it as soon as she was aware of why her friends had complained earlier.
Mrs. Zabini was gone, and the girl had removed her socks and her ankle support before letting a track of clothes leading to the ensuite bathroom.
There wasn’t so much hair at all actually. Shorter on the sides, gradually less and less shaved, like a sort of undercut, and plated back mainly on the top and a bit falling on the other side.
“Ow come on, I’m talking in your place because it also infuriates me when she’s showing her angel side when half the castle knows she also can be such a dick.”
Other people around the table started to join in, while Ron was too focused on his first sulking session of the day.
Nothing could be more infuriating than getting help from the person you hated the most. This is quite a universal statement. And when you were Fulvia Malfoy, getting any sort of sympathy at all was, in fact, the most infuriating thing that could happen – maybe more frustrating than infuriating, but still.
She was finally able to show off to a larger public this time, making sure that Cormac was watching her.
“If you say so...” Hermione still had doubts about their plan but never mind; she’d tried to prevent them long enough and it was not her problem anymore after 3 years of long arguments, she wasn’t their mother after all.
His eyes, all glassy and suffering now.
Speaking of the devil.
And you know what, that’s what I’ll do now if you don’t have any objections.”
[3:19PM]
It stopped her plan to make a scene in front of everybody somehow by confronting Malfoy, which Hermione was glad about.
Mrs. Zabini appeared at the door, hearing the noises the girl was making, with a tray of food she quickly put on the dressing table.
“I was told you were up to shenanigans to put the professors out of surveillance from the presentations event. Is that true?”
“So, it
Of course, it was more than enough to raise Marigold’s interest and make her wanting to urgently throw her head in the hot topic direction, to the point of breaking both her neck and back. But considering the warning expression of Hermione, she tried to act as disinterested as she could about it.
Neville just joined the Great Hall and came across the room to meet his loud friends at the Gryffindor’s table while Marigold claimed back her glasses, her deadpanned look still on her face.
“Hum, sorry professor, but you only appear to arrive at the end of our presentation.” Said McLaggen on a flat tone. “Marigold was not there, she let us alone to deal with it.”
A new students get on the school grounds, well that's wat Marigold aka Captain Obvious thinks.
“How much did you have already?” he hinted the now empty glass with his chin, also placing himself with his back to the wall, mirroring Marigold’s position next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
When she stood at Dumbledore’s stand, she was brutally startled by his gentle touch on her shoulder.
EDIT: neither I’m glorifying violence, I just happen to have a lot of repressed anger but I actually cry when ppl start fighting...
“Well you know I’m still not positive love will occur once she’ll know who actually this person is. I mean, look for yourself!”
After putting a large shirt – borrowed from Blaise’s wardrobe – and her pants, she’d sat on her bed, removing the covers, crossing her legs and massaged her left foot and ankle.
can. And do not be afraid, people are here to support you. Don’t hesitate to reconsider any help we’re offering you.”
“Oh come on, you know what I’m talking about.”
Not thinking too much about this she excused herself for not helping in further cleaning duties to her teammates and left for the Professor’s office.
It was also the first time for Fulvia to hear such a cold voice from her Latin Professor who was usually more eager to smile and comfort his students with gentle speeches. She saw that Potter didn’t put up a fight and went to wash her hands, so Fulvia did the same.
Me writing this fic: the more they suffer, the more it shows just how much i love them :)
[2:52PM]
“Fuck, you totally met someone!” exclaimed the dark skinned boy, rising from his seat in excitement. Now, everybody around the table was focused on the next word the jet-black haired girl would pronounce.
At some point, their respective friends tried to separate them, but snarky comments were thrown, again, and it was all they needed to turn in an orgy of violence.
“Theo, don’t pressure her!”
“What number is it anyway? What are you looking for?” she noticed he had just got out of his ballet classes as he still had his leg warmer. Some classes took place on the weekend as well.
That’s why she was genuinely surprised to hear they had also helped.
Of course the ballet teachers wouldn’t have kept the information about her dismissal for them only, and she should have expected the new to spread within the club pretty easily. For now, they only cognized her ankle support with heavy stares.
wouldn’t have be a worse scenario actually.
Ok done, shitty day.
“Hiya, honey! How are you doing! It’s been a while! I have so much to tell you, but you seem to have a lot to tell me as well, haha.” Her voice changed from enthusiastic to mischievous which had Fulvia lost for a minute.
The cup of pure black coffee was pretty small but she still held it with both of her hands, so her mind projected a feeling of usefulness and her anxiety would leave her alone for a bit.
want to leave her alone tonight.
She couldn’t help a whimper out of throat as she forcefully shut her eyes in anticipation.
She hadn’t missed of course all the mouths hanging, the gazes all over her body as if she were a sort of tasty meal. But she’d rather not think about it or also about Cormac’s comments when he learned about the plan as well as his lewd look over the entirety of her body as he had stood next to her during the presentation. She had just brushed it off.
Her head hurt.
She now wasn’t at least the center of attention at 100%.
[7:46PM]
“You know that’s not what I’m asking. We talked about that. You’re supposed to go through that; it’s nothing uncommon after what happened. And we also talked about how it would last for a while, not forever, and how you needed to acknowledge the way your body react to prevent it once and for all in a matter of few weeks. ” His tone was firm, “Did he touch you? Did he hurt you? What did you two talked about?”
Dean raised his hand in victory, “Damn right, I’m baby.” His fluttering eyes mocking his boyfriend, Seamus, across the table.
“You didn’t accustom me to be this talkative. Would you mind coming with me so we could chat some more... intimately?” He was pointing outside with his hand holding a glass filled with a clear liquid.
She gracefully sat at the table with them, her anger pouring out of her facial expression. Fulvia really thought a glare could kill and Pansy was the one who had made her believe so years ago.
“Hi, sweetheart, it’s been a while and you’ve been hard to get. How are you? How’s the house, are you back to school, how was your summer? Fuck, where’s that contract again?” some papers flew off his desk, “Anyway, I just wanted to call you because we’ve been contacted by this very brand of- OH MY FUCKING SWEET GOOD LORD WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?!”
Fulvia had no chance to strictly understand what was threw at her face but could easily imagine it had a certain link with the older Gryffindor boy
She’d tried to discipline her hair. With the new haircut she couldn’t do much; it was longer on the top and bend to one side and this very side began to curl into thin waves. She would have to find a way to tame it once at Hogwarts. She would look it up later, something like how to have a professional undercut look... or something.
He kept bothering her with filthy mental images, clamming it was pure revenge for all the times she tried to mind both the boys’ business as she desperately tried to cover her ears, giggling. But eventually, one student broke a glass as a sudden agitation was heard and there were a lot of shatters on the floor.
“Great, you’re both coming with me to Madam Pomfrey. Do you need a hand to get up?”
“Well, I’m gonna go, else I’ll be late. Becca’s gonna pick me up soon anyway.” He packed up his bag and stood up.
Said loved boy only smile in return, “I know babe. And it was worth arguing with the DJ to play it, even though it still is in theme, some people just don’t like to have fun somehow. But like, who doesn’t like flash-” the end of his sentence was interrupted by Marigold diving pretty harshly in his arms.
“He always had been impossible when he drinks.” She couldn’t help the wave of shame washing over her; she’d had to face this public shaming in company of Malfoy, yay.
“It is always the same with you; you don’t know where your place is. I’m not the one everybody says sleep around with anyone who’s got a cock.” She literally spitted at her face and let go of her hardly enough for Marigold to take few steps back, letting the now misshapen collar of her tee fall back in place. She waited for Parkinson to leave before wiping out the dirty gob off her face and dry her hand on her sweatpants.
But unfortunately, she couldn’t risk breaking her mask. Breaking down and let out all her bottled up emotions would associate her as a hysterical human being and she wouldn’t – she couldn’t – allow that.
“I appreciate everything you did to help me. It means a lot, and I know I can count on you if needed in the future. For now I will have to figure things out. I don’t want to drag anybody further into this. It’s the last thing I want. But if it can lighten your mind, I’m planning to call aunt Bella, she might knows something about what is possible to be done for emancipation rights and all. And with all the divorce she had she might now something law speaking,” she put all of her emotions in her eyes as she crossed his glance,” thank you, Sevs.”
She felt like yelling, screaming, crying, shouting at the top of her lungs.
The others had just watched in silence, letting the two get their usually heated argument of the day, but it was dangerously drifting towards a more serious tone.
[3PM]
where did u find that
She didn’t want to think about last night, as Blaise had said, nothing happened. She knew some people saw them with McLaggen; she knew there would be words going around about it. She knew some people – the face of Crabbe and Goyle appeared behind her closed eyes – who wanted to protect her would become nosy and would make a fuss about it. She really needed not to think about it now, too bothersome in her opinion.
“Let’s get the show started.”
The energy around them shifted. Fulvia thought it was so strange how the allegedly strong Marigold Potter was silent and bending under the abusing words of her ex-boyfriend, and in front of several eye-witnesses, McLaggen’s friends were enjoying the show just behind him.
[3:16PM]
She knew he tried hard to play down her actual situation.
The boy was no longer sitting down nor was he no longer smoking. He had tossed his cigarette butt away and he was now agitatedly chatting with his friend that had just came out from the little shop and that was none other than Zabini.
Another door opened.
Ma belette????
confessed to me and as I know you’re in communication with a lot of lawyers, I wondered if you knew someone to help us, him, out for this situation? What are the steps and the means needed?”
She‘d carefully took the stairs as she went down to the kitchens to take her breakfast. Mrs. Zabini was already at work so she had the house for herself minus some people that worked around the house.
“Are you mental?! That’s it, fuck, you’ve gone mad!” she dangerously bent over the girl, now fully facing her “Yeah you’re wrong, fucking wrong. You’re not my friend, hell you’re no one! No need to fucking analyse me, I dress and cut my hair the way I want, I owe you nothing. There’s no need to associate me to a category or to put me in a box the simple second I walk away from the ‘perfect-princess’ path I’m supposed to take, okay?” her voice had now dropped to a dangerous, cool tone, the talk had unlashed most of her insecurities without the shorter girl knowing, “I’m avoiding you because you’re ruining the air I’m supposed to breath in, okay?” she pointed an accusatory finger to Marigold’s chest, “Last year proved that nothing good comes when one stays too close – even in the role of a girl your boyfriend tries to hit on or whatever – to you.”
“For your information, she followed me back okay?! Also it’s all about her professional pictures, so I follow her just because I appreciate the modelling company she works with, and the pictures quality you see. I couldn’t care less about her personal pictures. Because they take extra care finding some new way of playing with the shades and the filters and it’s really interesting how-”
And once she’d entered it, she had understood what this room was supposed to be.
She was now back in her uniform and among her friends and fellow track mates.
The light flashed before her eyes – and it had nothing to do with the spotlight in the room – her lungs were suddenly too small for the rest of her body. The smell of the boy’s beverage seemed to anchor itself into her whole system added to the fancy whisky one that seemed to come from nowhere. She could only phrase some words in a weak voice despite her efforts to maintain it as hard and clear as it has been few seconds ago,
Smiling both devilishly, they went back at their plates and Marigold summed up the supplies they had to get tomorrow at Hogsmeade.
“How can you say that–”
“Yeah, on my way back from Dumbledore I grabbed a sandwich in Sevs’s rooms. He wasn’t there though; but I left a note.”
It was a new school year of truths.
She curled up on herself, bringing the covers above her head and letting herself be buried into the softness and warmth of her bed. She wanted it to swallow her, giving her the possibility to disappear. He would not find her.
. A lil’ tipsy, aren’t we?”
“So, what’s this luxurious carriage is all about?” she’d sarcastically added, smiling fondly for she knew it was a favour from a certain professor.
She didn’t say anything; she didn’t know where to begin. So, he kept going.
who stalk her instagram page non-stop. I’m witnessing it every morning and every night though and it is really sad I have to say.”
Once they arrived to the cloakroom, they changed and practiced one last time their lines and movements. Then, with a wicked grin, Marigold turned towards her friends, she would mind the ‘Malfoy related issue’ later,
“I’m gonna get better, I promise. I’ll take an appointment soon don’t worry,” she pulled at his hand and brought him in a strong embrace, “I know you’re here for as long as I need and the same goes for me. I’m here for you when you need me and as long as you want,” she whispered, “We’re immortal together.” She was facing the entangled snake on her arm and thought about his very own; their link through life and death, linked to their souls, their Ouroboros.
“Well, I’m not going crazy anymore if that’s what you’re asking.” She sheepishly smiled, adverting her eyes.
once there.” After two seconds of silence he had felt bad about the comment and had gazed at her, “Too soon?” he asked with both a small voice and smile, but she had hidden a wide grin behind her hand and deadpanned, “You and me both know I unfortunately can’t do that.”
She excused herself as Blaise and Pansy kept bickering in the background. She vaguely acknowledge Potter’s friends without Potter (
Dumbledore wasn’t responsible for all that crap; contrariwise, he tried to help her finding a way out of it.
Fulvia could hear a distant conversation happening, but something was off. She couldn’t concentrate on the spiteful words.
tf it is?? lmfao is it supposed to show somebody fighting???
“Gosh I totally forgot about him... What a shame. He was so cool I swear ‘Mione! If only you could have seen him.” She left the bed and joined Hermione on the floor with a sigh.
“Hey, Scarface... long time no see. Cute hair.” The snarky comment made her roll her eyes.
Suddenly, the global hubbub began to tune down and there was only whispers, gasps and questions rising from tables to tables. The first years looked lost and searched around for answers as if they would float in the air, not understanding the sudden commotion.
Marigold’s face was distorted into an expression of fear and disgust, “Do I really do that? That’s so gross oh my god, I had no idea, ew, why didn’t you tell me sooner?? Why would you let me do that?!”
She did as he instructed. They both did.
At some point, her voice got shakier and hoarser, her cries exhausting her vocal cords. Her breath was shallow and her head hurt even more than before if possible. She released her fist, letting the cutter knife escape on the mattress somewhere. She curled up on herself and concentrated on the burning sensation of her arm freshly butchered against the soft fabric of her tee absorbing the possible blood.
To this day, she’d never understood the white-blond girl’s reaction to this incident and didn’t try to look to deep into it.
“Zip it Finnigan!” she stopped after slightly elbowing the boy, keeping the same low voice he had taken. She turned, all smiles, to face her former math professor frowning at her.
This first Friday night – Saturday morning in fact – of school was the beginning of a promising yet completely altered year, but she did not know that as she was dreaming of her dark-and-not-so-polite-mysterious-lover.
“Ginny?”
The burning sensation of discomfort won over the cold one but didn’t stop the goose bumps to invade Marigold’s skin. She didn’t know what the significations of her body’s reactions were, and she wasn’t in the right state of mind to read into it at the moment.
She could witness different kind of tactics. Some clubs bet on fast motions to attract the gaze, others on the fuss created by the members. Some were quiet but still brought people to give them interest.
resounded, awakening Marigold up from her slumber. She blindly looked for her phone with her hand to stop the alarm, somewhere under her pillow and grabbed her glasses before looking at the screen. As she processed her notifications, she heard rummage in the room with her and rose on her elbow to take in the view around her.
shit for real i totally forgot to ask properly where i’d sleep during the school year!!!!
Hahaha I can smell your bullshit from over here you’re not even scaring me you little bitch
[3:10PM]
“Here, that’s the first part. Do you want the glow in the dark glitter, let me look for it.”
[1:29AM]
“Wh-What? I don’t know what you’re talking about; pshhh I’m a little tipsy at most. I never thought I would meet you at such an event, I had to make sure it wasn’t a mirage and that the holly Hydra Malfoy had granted us with her presence you know.”
“So what? You want me to pander at her feet just because the Ice Queen is back and throw a Hallelujah? Hell fucking no, no fucking way! She can burn alive for what I care! Gosh you know that I hate her!”
but more srsly whats his fucking prblm w/ you like dude chill this perfect girl is your only child. i can’t believe he’s acting like that towards you. i always had kinda respect for him like the strict minimum required because he made gold-and-pure-creature aka you, but you’re right fuck him. how come he can even ask that ?! don’t tell me Gandalf approved!!!
Her breath accelerated, her heart pounded louder and louder in her chest. She hoped she was thin enough not to be noticeable under her duvet. Her stomach ached, she could feel her body getting colder and colder with a wave of anxiety and adrenaline and yet the pearls of sweat wouldn’t stop rolling on her face and along her back, bringing shivers and goosebumps on her skin.
Marigold, as her other fellow comrades from the athletics club, hosted the party following a precise schedule giving places, functions and hours with names.
The boy didn’t let her compose herself, he continued, changing of target.
Fulvia progressed towards her usual spot, in the narrowest space between the stone walls framing the small stained glass window, just behind the desk.
Of course there were exceptions and it included the individuals she couldn’t correctly give back the attention they offered her, and here was the reason for feeling useless – at least in their lives. Nothing but a selfish prick taking everything she needed and never paying it back.
Then Potter climbed the stage in turn, everybody knew her, or soon would, as the co-captain of the track team with McLaggen. A lot of people knew the tension between them was still present given their
“Take it off!” Ginny burst in, in turn. She hadn’t bothered to look at her messy haired friend until now and the look of her face was cold.
Naturally the school didn’t allow part time jobs.
It had started with Potter coming for Fulvia after this latter had let a note in Potter’s locker explaining the disgusting behaviour of her ex-boyfriend, well boyfriend at the time.
“Well, I’m really sorry Parkinson, believe me! I didn’t smell any of the sex and musky scent of the harem usually surrounding you, how could I know you were here.” She closed her mouth in a sardonic smile. Today was too much, there were no longer any fuck in store.
“So what, you suggest we get rid of all men on the planet?” Malfoy’s tone was half mocking half serious.
“Huh, nothing specific.” Marigold sighed.
“I- thank you, aunt Bella.” She lit up yet another cigarette and mindlessly caressed her fresh wounds with her thumb nail as she crossed one arm over her knees pressing against her chest. She could feel the knot in her throat getting more and more suffocating but she needed to remain neutral in her tone. At this moment, it seemed to be the hardest thing in her life, tears pearling at the corner of her eyes, threatening to ruin her act.
im so so so so so sorry Sirius
Seamus began to sigh, going to look for the broom and the shovel, not so far from where they were both standing.
As for Marigold, she had taken after her godfather about the particular interest of photography. She liked taking blurry pictures of unknown people the most.
“Yesss, thanks, babe. And like, I don’t know, even the bitchy girls from year 5 were not has bitchy. It’s frightening how much a single person can hold- ah thanks –the pressure in a room. I swear- oh do you have the same ones in purple and gold please? –I even heard some people laughing. Well, not laughing but- ah perfect, you’re a life saver, love –I’m sure they were chuckling at least, and I’ve never ever heard anybody chuckle in the studio.”
Before any response could cross her mind, the green eyed girl was cut by the entrance of another trio joining them in the Gryffindor’s Common Room. Luna and Neville sat on the only couch left, closing their circle.
“Oh, well, if that’s the case then, suits yourself, hon.” Marigold motioned to wrap herself back up into her duvet.
sorry, i didn’t check my phone for a while
It was 1:37pm, it was clear all her friends around and away from the table had finished eating. She hadn’t. But they didn’t have to know that.
As he was showing several videos he had saved on his phone to show Fulvia, Blaise’s gaze wandered around the different houses’ tables. Then, he spotted a fulminating Pansy coming back to them.
“Are you for real?!” now Ron was snickering, “I only told you this one time and never used it since! I saw it in a ‘how to call French people for fun article’??? I was 12?! Will this grudge take you hostage of any common sense?!?”
The French and Latin Teacher, Potter’s guardian. This latter information she wasn’t supposed to know.
She scowled it off and limped her way – too tipsy to mind and control it – through the Requirement room.
The voice was strong on the intention but the panting following it indicated that the person it belonged to had had to run to physically interrupt their aggressive scuffle.
“You are going to both wash your hands thoroughly and then you will tend to each other’s wounds, is that clear? I don’t want any complaints or tentative to hurt each other.”
“And I do, I told you, I support you.” always with a gentle smile on her lips.
Then she had entered the filled up bathtub, as softly as she could; her brain was disoriented by the crying.
When she got out of the bathroom, dried and changed, Blaise was out; she didn’t know how long she had spent in under the water but she knew he had other things to do.
“What?! Are you for real now? Mate, I was telling you. I found it in a pile of clothes, I had no idea. What it is to you, you’re probably even the one to have forget it there. You don’t understand how fast I rushed down here not to miss lunch. There was no point looking for my own clothes??”
“Hey, now! We’re not disgusting, and neither is it a contest!” Hermione hoped in the current conversation as she had finished her rummage, “Once you’ll know him personally, it’s possible you’ll both fall in love. But also maybe you won’t like his character so much. But you’ll never know if you don’t actually speak with each other. And by no means should we adopt a defeatist attitude.”
It was dissociating her by the insidious sensation of madness.
Cormac comments about her body, back when they used to date, sure hadn’t helped her to feel proud about it, funny how the table turned.
Hermione and Seamus rolled their eyes.
She would have to come back to school  and during the seven last days of ‘rest’ she’d woke up, showered, been forced to eat something by Mrs. Zabini, gone to re-education for her twisted ankle, been forced to eat again. And all over again each days until next Friday. The only peaceful moments being coming back home after the RE, taking her time walking down the streets, her head empty.
They both walked back in the common room and joined their friends before going to their respective courses.
No but more srsly I went to talk with Derlin the Wizard about where you’ll sleep when you come back next Friday
She tried to focus and on the good energies surrounding her, just as Lavender had told her so many times, but couldn’t find any. She still tried to breathe in and out, making her way to the astrology tower. She breathed in. Patil would read her next week predictions and give her a stone to carry around for the week, she would have the smoke session of her life with the new breed she just got back with Neville and everything would be soooo fine.
She snapped out of it.
Fulvia frowned in incomprehension at her best friend. He was teasing her as he would when he tried to phrase out loud Fulvia’s thoughts.
She hadn’t been raised to say it.
“Hi, aunt Bella, yeah it’s me,
She felt awful but knew it fuelled her anger and it would be easier to release it this way. Almost there. She repeated the last events behind her shut eyes, how of a handful she was, all the worry she provided her few loved ones with, how she was such a disappointment to her family, all the awful things she went through for most of her life, her father’s abuse on her younger self, how she wished it never happened, the way it would be better for her to just not be around anymore, permanently, but how she couldn’t bring herself to imagine the weeping faces of her loved ones after hearing about her death.
Fulvia disconnected from the call. Answering had been a mistake. She knew she should’ve warned him. She had tried.
“Come on Ginny, sit properly aren’t you ashamed?” softly scolded Ron.
He won’t answer to my texts or my calls??????
Potter was definitely mastering the attention seeking attitude.
She saw the tapping bubble appear and disappear several times in a row.
“For the love of god, language! And don’t call them that.”
He then dragged her in a warm and comforting embrace that made her startle for it was usually Sirius that tended to express his emotions by any form of direct contact, Remus would show a lot more with words.
“Hey now! Don’t call him that! You don’t know him.”
but we’re okay now
Saying she was swimming in her uniform was an understatement.
ok Vee calm down it’s gonna be alright I swear
There was once a time when she had been awfully self-aware of her rather ‘prominent curves’, but both the track club and her job had helped to work on it, making her chisel some aspects of her figure and accept it as it was, even more, embrace it. She could still get moments where the dismorphia hit hard, but she got better at handling it now.
“What the actual fuck happened Fulvia? It’s not like you to change your appearance and not saying anything about it to me! You know your hair was your trade mark? How could you do that without telling me?! What am I supposed to say to our clients? We can’t find any wig as perfect as your hair and you know it, we tried by the past. Oh my god, okay, okay I’m hyperventilating now. OMG I can’t believ-”
Marigold only swore when she was fulminating. Two times in a raw was bad news.
She’d go to excuse herself to the team tomorrow for living this early and not being able to properly help.
“How can she do that?”
“Yes, Professor?” she turned only to watch the back of her former math professor; the latter hadn’t judge that last commentary worthy enough to even face Marigold.
She scoffed, “You’re the greatest misogynist arsehole and soulless piece of shit of all time.”
[3:02PM]
“SHE’S NOT- she’s not my girlfriend for fuck’s sake!” she tried to hide her blush mixed with disgust while Theo and Blaise just silently raised their eyebrows in a doubting expression. Fulvia still tried to defend her point, “You know I hate her as much as you do and I’d gladly watch her shut up for good with you! I hate her so much, she’s just an attention whore who tries to start fights just for the fun of it and to get away with a smile, and it must be exhausting to be her! I hope her ego consumes her!” she was just throwing arguments after one other.
Facing directly the bed space, there was a first door leading to the bathroom. Another door on the same wall, closer to the entrance, opening on the dressing in a way that if said door was open then the main door of the bedroom would be blocked. Details, but it was reassuring and comforting in a way.
The bespectacled girl chose to lean against the wall as well, not facing the other girl, as if no sound had come from her mouth just seconds ago.
“MISS POTTER!!!” It was Flitwick who appeared to hoot the name of the girl for the last five minutes already.
The duvet was back above her head but she felt a fresh breeze sliding around her feet. She flinched. A warm hand gently curled around her – good – ankle, tracing soothing circles on her malleolus. The circles were following a rhythm, somewhere in the distance she could hear a repetition a words going round and round again.
She thought that sometimes she didn’t need to put up an act to be dramatic; her high sensibility was doing the job.
lame!” she mocked.
She tried to tame down her anger, not wanting to lash all her fears at him, knowing the usually understanding and composed man didn’t meant all those atrocities.
“If you need anything else, know that you are welcome to consult me, you will always be welcome. If not, then I will see you back on the next week Friday. Take care during this week. ” He opened it and his look implied her to leave.
And even after trying to end this week with a proper sound mind, the world was against her; no one to be seen crossing the streets behind the window.
“Yeah, yeah mate all of that is him, no need to waste time reciting his biography. So you see him too? That’s reassuring. I was so sure I dreamt him as I never saw him around after our first encounter. I’m so relived now, OMG you can’t even imagine how happy I am right now.”
They were out for the Hogsmeade weekly and official outing and wandered between the old shops and bookstores. They had split their usual group in two. Dean, Seamus, Neville, Luna and Ginny were helping the latter to finalise their “party” purchases while Hermione, Ron and Marigold were off to wonder aimlessly in old bookshops.
She wanted to dodge the subject so badly. But she couldn’t ignore it forever, so, as much as she hated how things would get in few seconds, she also really wanted for this to be over with.
“Yeah, Ron,” Marigold added accusingly, “Let her finish. It seems to take a very interesting turn. What do you mean by that, Ginny?”
“Well, if you were my friend as much as you say, you’d trust me for my actions and beliefs, I don’t ask for a lot but really, I’m telling you this one last time, if you want what’s good for you, ditch her or you’ll regret it sooner or later.”
“Did you have time to check your new room?”
“Uh?! What thing with my tongue? That’s the first time I ever hear of that!”
She hadn’t met anybody there in two years and she cherished the idea that this school year wouldn’t be any exception. She even achieved not to come face to face with Filch or his stupid cat.
He had taken a slow pace for she would never tell him her ankle hurt.
“Ron, do you ever listen?! I do not miss her!” she said abruptly, “I was just wondering what in the name of Dio Brando could have happen to her for not being at Hogwarts and show to everybody her stupid superiority,” she blurted out, “Plus I’m worrying because she didn’t post anything on her instagram page since the beginning of august. And-”
“Your situation is something to worry about Miss Malfoy, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about this, but yes, I had a discussion  with professor Snape for I know you two are close.”
[2:31AM]
At which Marigold – self-proclaimed brain of the operation – bit the inside of her cheek and reassured the other girl while hoping for her mysterious love interest to also be present later on, “Why, of course we’re not sure and neither 100% safe, but it’s legit the only way to catch the amount of attention we’re seeking,” she continued “It has been planned for weeks since midsummer! Nobody can put themselves in our way now, not even Malfoy will steal my place. If she really believed that she just had to come back with a new haircut to steal all the attention of everybody in the room, she’s madly wrong.”
She rushed to knock out her opponent by throwing him over her shoulder. Maybe the rush of the events made her act a bit fiercer that intended seeing of the boy’s face went from surprise to slight discomfort once hitting the ground.
Fulvia kept going, “Well,
But she also knew she couldn’t just ignore Potter without giving any explanations of the sudden disinterest for their fights and expect the girl to leave her alone knowing how hungry for confrontations she was.
“Well,
“Pardon me Miss Malfoy; I know you do not like to be called by this name. It is just that I could not get your attention by any other way.”
yeah right i forgot about that
This damned universe had betrayed her so many times she couldn’t believe there was still room in her heart to feel this disappointed. Still. There she was.
Her main courses were sciences, both physics and chemistry in her case, and she easily lost track of time once she dove on these subjects. More for it demanded a full attention than for the hypothetical dedication to it.
“Yeah, because it’s totally credible he took a hospital room for somebody else, for about two-three weeks, knowing he’s a cancer veteran, and as his charity never ends, he totally kept the bill for himself and didn’t tell us about financially sheltering a poor soul that might have to go through what he went through because he’s just like that. You’re right, that’s an acceptable answer, my bad.”
“I’m so pleased to see you too.” she deadpanned while ditching the cigarette butt in the not so empty ashtray besides the window and rose from her former position so they could greet each other with a quick but fierce hug. When they separated, he cupped her cheeks between his hands and cautiously studied her face.
The girl was still bickering with her brother, unbothered, but Marigold noticed that she was tenser than earlier. Luna took the girl’s hand , as if she knew she was eavesdropping, and received all of Ginny’s attention, “Do you want to go? It could be fun?”
Hydra Lucia Malfoy.
There will be in few chapter, I think, an explanatory of Marigold's youth and education, to show how were Remus and Sirius around and her and other people too!
The rest of the golden trio was not long to follow but a few more people were also tagging along, Potter’s other Gryffindor friends.
[3PM]
[3:37PM]
Fulvia was weirdly unpleased by the situation, the remarks about Potter made her skin crawl even though she couldn’t care less. It was more of the attitude a man was giving in public shamelessly. And because she couldn’t care less, she didn’t control the flow of venom that flew out of her mouth.
Marigold urged away the drunk thought suggesting her that Malfoy looked like an ethereal living being, even though she was no longer confusing her for her dark prince.
They swung between small talks and deeper ones and she didn’t forget to grandly thank him again and again for the time he had invested to help her.
, almost 11:45 am by now. As her teammates were getting out of the cloakroom, she followed them and headed towards her common room and her dorm.
Ginny had said it.
[1:39AM]
The look in Seamus’s eyes was sheer admiration, adoration even, he looked so proud. And Dean. Dean looked so loved, in love, happy and complete, right now in his boyfriend’s arms. They looked so whole and alive even they moved to a slow pace.
“It’s fine.” She had trouble breathing properly.
She snapped back from her thoughts. This single word, this awful name she was given in order to continue their silly names’ tradition, brought her back in the present and reminded her person she was in the room with.
Marigold couldn’t tear her eyes away from that face, from that timid expression originally intended for his friend’s eyes only, from what appeared to be a silent laugh of small joy and pure amusement, oblivious to the rest of the world.
“Don’t you dare play innocent with me you insolent; I’ll have the end of it!” He quickly went back from where he first came, letting out indistinct fuming words. Let’s say after seven years of dealing with Potter’s shit, Fulvia was not the only one hating her gut.
She grabbed the retractable cutter knife lying on top of the box and brought her arm back under the covers.
She’d sighted out of relief; 6 days left until the end of her RE but winced a little at the idea, since it meant she had to go back to Hogwarts by this time.
“Fax.” Ron added with a compliance tone, while Hermione let go of her sleeve looking annoyingly back at her notes while sputtering words.
“Calm down, we never said that. But you have to accept it wasn’t even her fault, like, she didn’t do anything in fact. And you weren’t even in ‘love’ with him anymore; you just needed an occasion to ditch him and the fact he tried to woo Malfoy was your perfect occasion.”
“What?! Is this a joke? So you’re telling me you’ve fallen in love with Malfoy?” turning back to Marigold. The joke was too big for her to contain her laughing voice.
But the fresh events had destroyed every single hope she had left.
A buzz had once again took her from the focus she gave her homework. She hadn’t seen the time fly but her feet were sore from the flooding blood interruption as she sat crossed legged on the top of the blankets.
Fulvia couldn’t help but think about how when she had
“So, as I said, you will have to choose a new activity or course in order to replace the ballet classes that you were taking until now. Mr. Malfoy has been clear about this.”
“Oh dear lords! Dude, you’re seeing that?! It isn’t my imagination, right? Because I have good reasons to think that he might be my future husband, you know the one I allegedly talk about 24/7.”
Fulvia, as well as everyone else facing the stage, could easily see the wrap-around dress that hardly covered anything, clinging on Potter’s curves. Needless to say it was far from the proper school uniform Fulvia could usually spot her into.
[3:01PM]
A hand –
Potter was not the only one who had noticed how Fulvia avoided confrontations since her return. Not that it was bad, per se, just weird, uncanny.
“We won’t ‘Mione, don’t worry.” Marigold smiled.
Anyway, the chatter of the cloakroom brought her back in the present, and for reasons; the conversations had drifted from how everybody was dead-ass beaten by the exercises to what people had been doing during holidays, and finally to what was in the back of every single student’s mind since the 2
“Fuck her.”
“Yeah my bad, my bad,
The second one was just another way for her father to leave his prints on her, what a distasteful mockery.
Blaise smiled and rolled his eyes at the answer and kissed her on her temple before closing the last door and leaving her for good for the night.
The two girls separated awkwardly and seemed both perplexed by the new voice joining them, dropping their heated argument. They identified the voice owner and grunted in harmony – Cormac and his lot.
“Hey what’s wrong Mari?” She followed the general direction where the older girl’s eyes were glued to and more or less putting together the other girl train of thoughts, “OMG, is this the allegedly dude you crushed on? Is this the beautiful guy Mari had fallen for?” She had turned towards her brother, “All dark, tall and mysterious?”
He still hadn’t responded after the threat. She’d shrugged it off and went for preparing herself before the daily RE at 11:30am.
Everything flooded the rest of sanity and pride she had left, she couldn’t accept to keep it silent any longer. She let her sobs out and louder each time for the first time in her life. She accorded herself to feel something; too bad it had to be pain.
“Calm down, four eyes, I can’t hear what you’re saying over all the whining. Last night happened what happened and you could do nothing about that, and I’m sure it’s nothing personal.”
“I swear everything is going to be ok from now on, I’m here and you are not going anywhere.” He emphasised his last words with a firmer grip on her wrists.
But again, I’m sorry, ily.
Followed by her friends as they were heading for their usual spot at the Slytherin table, she tried to ignore the way the voices died dramatically in the room to let place to whispers and murmurs. She felt the weight of the thousand eyes glaring her on their way to sit down.
Where are you?
“I’m so sorry you had to do all of this for me.” She cupped her nose and mouth in her hands and tried to frown her emotions away. Blaise, who had expected her to say this and knew her words didn’t apply only for the hard work they had invested these past days, grabbed her wrists and lowered them down her laps, forcing her to cross his gaze. He took a deep but gentle voice.
“She could have stayed wherever the hell she was hiding at.”
“It is. Thanks Bella.”
“How did you know about the dick pic?”
Marigold crossed her arms over her stomach, coughing as Malfoy, heaving, took several steps back, “I can only think about your friend, Pansyphilis, for that one,” she just regained a bit of stamina and dived on Malfoy, her face livid with anger, “You fucking frigid virgin Satan, you’re right,” after tackling Malfoy to the ground and straddling her, Marigold hammered her punches after punches,
At that she realised how much of a lost cause she was.
She breathed out.
“You know what, I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say anything okay? I smell condescendence in your tone, and I’m not really sure you want to talk to me like that when you know one day I’ll destroy your ass with a fucking hand thunder pocket okay?! So, you better swallow back your venom, snake lady.”
He offered a warm smile before inviting her to take a sit in his office.
a boy you think?”
“I would recommend a course where you can sit or at least not moving around too frequently, given your current state.” His look slipped down, and even if his office’s desk blocked the view, she understood the old man was referring to her legs.
“It’s okay Mione, I’m not mad at her. Don’t worry. You can go back to the library and finish your homework; your chemistry book is here by the way.” She held out said book that had been buried under some clothes, while uselessly scrolling on her phone with her other hand.
Hermione was a bit sceptical about their “peculiar” method to attract the attention of everybody in the hallways.
I'm pretty satisfied with this chapter because we can see that Marigold is far from being a goofball and that she also has great worries and bad thoughts. Also Cormac is a little shit.
Cormac had humiliated Marigold as he had tried to cheat on her with a lot of girls. Back then some of them went to tell her but she simply wouldn’t even listen to them, she was in denial, he couldn’t be doing that to her. Of course she saw he wasn’t caring about her as much as she cared about him, but they had been together during the end of the fifth year and the whole sixth year – seventh year for him.
[9:12PM]
Both of them held their eyes into each other, sharing one shaken breath, not knowing what to do for those everlasting seconds/minutes/hours.
“Are my poor mortal eyes deceiving me? Is it you, ô Sleeping Beauty to whom the wisdom and the virtue remain unequalled?”
“Self care™?”
[2:25AM]
in the background while Hermione rolled her eyes for the umpteenth time today.
Malfoy, who had been taken aback until now in front of such a disproportionate reaction to their casual bumping into each other, leaned in and twisted her face into a threatening smile, “Or what, what you gonna do? Nothing, you’re too afraid your little favourite professor Lupin will tell you off. What a pair of lunatics you both are, just need to see who he’s married to, to understand something is clearly wrong with him and then you came along and they had to raise you. Poor all of you, that’s why, personally, I don’t blame you too hard for your foul words; you’re just coming from the wrong side of the Black family. Sorry we don’t share the good things with the plebe.”
“You take back what you said about Remus and Sirius first!” Marigold bit her forearm and Malfoy screamed under the surprise, smacking Marigold’s face and making her glasses fly away.
(See the end of the chapter for
A brief glance around the room; the same weird glass jars with the same amount of dust on the shelves against the walls. Reassurance and comfort.
The party wasn’t especially themed but songs where all from the 90’s to 2000 or so, and from time to time some current ones would pass.
Her imaginary future boyfriend was Hydra Malfoy, her nemesis that had come back to school at last and that persisted in ignoring her. The one that had drastically changed her looks without any explanations, not that Marigold would admit she craved for one. The one that had helped her back on her feet, the one that had made her fall in the first place in the corridor the previous week.
Fulvia never ever complained before of the attention she could be given, at the contrary she even craved for it somehow.
Screw it, he would figure this one out. He had the second out of the three set of keys after all. She left her last cigarette burn off by itself in the ashtray and crawled under the covers of her bed to rest.
He walked towards his desk, alternating between looking awkwardly at Fulvia and fidgeting with some papers on the wooden surface. She threw him an inquisitive look.
“Fuck off, Ginny. What do you want? If you keep the attitude up, I’m sure you can finally make your dream come true and make money as an official knob head.”
“Sorry to summon you out of nothing. But understand that he left me no choice, even though this one is not so much of a professional one.”
“Okay, good.”
He excused himself right away putting his hand back along his body, “Sorry, my bad... just...” she looked up at him, a bit lost by the contact. “We, the educational team, may not be able to do anything against
In front of the closed expression of the other girl’s face, Fulvia couldn’t help but have a flash-back/memory of the very last year ending, the arguments and dramas she had been involved into by force more than by will; which added to the complexity of the situation and gave some more reasons as why she didn’t felt like confronting Potter this year and would do everything possible to avoid her.
Once alone, she looked at her hand, the one that had gripped Malfoy’s fingers on their own, and thought that the contact had been warmer than she would have thought – disturbing and totally unexpected even if she was the one who’d done it but warm still. Maybe her return to Hogwarts wasn’t that bad after all.
and maybe it was because of your visits to the hospital, idk
Theo jumped in, totally unaware of the tension growing between the two best friends, as the perfect distraction, “So, how do you find your new room so far? Does it still smell like fresh paint?”
She proceeded to clean the small wound pretty gently but had to step closer has she still hadn’t put her glasses back on. Fulvia tensed as she could feel Potter’s breath on her face. She then wiped off the smeared blood coming from Fulvia’s nose, “There! Perfect enough to do the Vogue cover, princess,” she grabbed Fulvia’s hands to clean the bloody knuckles next.
The other picture must have been taken shortly after, both of them were on a bed, but there was also Remus in this one. He had one knee on the bed, holding Sirius’s shoulders as this latter held Remus’s head and they shared a tender chaste kiss. Marigold was still in Sirius’s laps and was playing with Remus’s tie, falling down around her face.
“Still a prick after waking up I see, nice to know nothing will ever change. Somebody didn’t quite sleep well.” Ginny was poking at the food on her plate.
[9:24AM]
The first guitar chords of
It was like every single student in the big room had waited for him to confirm it. The pressure in the room dropped immediately.
By doing so, she caught sight of her hands. They were shaky, dry and seemed thinner than... few weeks ago by the way the several rings she wore now dangled a little around her fingers. She slept another guilty glance at the wrapped up food; she wasn’t hungry for now.
With all of the students gathered in the Great Hall she allowed herself to give up on her perfect stance and gave in to the limping rhythm her body begged her go back to, safe from any humiliation. She just wandered around the school grounds.
“I’m sorry for borrowing it and putting it on without you knowing Luna, I didn’t mean it.” she said with her eyes locked in Ginny’s. Her voice was as calm as the waters of the Great Lake on windless day. She tried to repress the shiver that only the thin but large tee top couldn’t chase away.
“Yeah, judging by how long you’ve been staring at her I also thought you had it figured out. But somehow, was too taken aback to act on it.”
“Hydra? Is it you sweetheart?”
[3:18PM]
Then she changed the subject. She didn’t feel like going on on this path without shattering in front of another person, it was the last thing she needed.
She decided to unleash everything, she had already started anyway.
“Mari, don’t do it please; you’re going to make a scene about nothing and it’ll be ridiculous.” Hermione, knowing what her friend was up to, had now grabbed her sleeve trying to physically convince her not to go further.
She had been lucky enough to be able to borrow Blaise’s old band shirts as her suitcases were already at Hogwarts, and not to only be left with a pyjama and a blanket.
It was now Blaise’s turn to shove Fulvia’s elbow.
He corrected her, “Not only me; Pans’, Theo and Snape also helped. Well mostly Snape actually as he was the one taking care of everything. He found this old vacant room and asked us to help him in our free time to repaint it and add some furniture. I think he said it belonged to an old student that had an illness or something that required him to be isolated and so that’s why it possesses its ensuite bathroom and all I guess.”
In the parking lot of the station, standing by an ordinary old but clean dark car, a man whom the white of his shirt’s collar underlined the deep pigment of his skin, had been waiting for her.
“Playing smart won’t help you right now Miss Potter. Maybe detention could keep you from disturbing professors’ supervision and improve your geometry grades?”
Anyway, it hadn’t been enough to spy on Malfoy, so she had ended putting her pride aside and has sent a following request to the girl’s account. She could still remember the strange looks from Malfoy towards her the week it had happened, but she had lain low and her request was eventually accepted.
“Miss Potter! You better not be doing something compromising for your place in this institution!”
np. you didn’t go to Hog's Head?
She left the room and headed toward the corridors without a word.
[3:36PM]
She couldn’t risk using dishes in fear of being busted and managed to keep everything clean.
that if you get caught-”
“Oh my god,” she gasped “I can’t believe you have been gifted with the capacity of actively analysing your surroundings.” The taller girl dryly snorted.
“No- that’s not what I meant...” Marigtold took a deep breath before stuttering and blurting out her thoughts, her hands still in her hair, “what I meant is – don’t get me wrong, usually I don’t listen to student’s gossip that much but there was a lot of hearsays about you – y-your new haircut, your new ‘even-colder-than-before’ attitude, the way you behave once out of the gates of the castle, the- the way you dress outside school even. And you smoke now?” She was referring to this later afternoon, when she had saw her wearing the unusual casual outfit, “The fact you stopped taking ballet classes, your late arrival to school, your ankle, and the way you got skinnier... People talk. I- I couldn’t help but wonder what could have happen to you and one thing leading to another I came to the conclusion – correct me if I’m wrong – that you might have experienced some sort of discomfort, disphoria with your body and that – maybe – you were... gosh okay... transitioning. And the reason you acted different towards me, I mean the way you didn’t provoked me anymore, or didn’t started arguments and all was that you were afraid for me to find out, which I still pretty much did by the way, and then I could use it against you when we’d fight? But I want you to know that I would never do anything like that. What you’re going through is valid, you are valid and I would never even think about using it as an argument against you, ever. So I just wanted to tell you that, yeah.” She ended her speech with a timid and hopeful satisfied smile on her lips thinking how she finally had the guts to say what had been on her mind for the past hours.
of September, aka, the non-presence of a certain Malfoy.
She heard the chuckles from both Dean and Seamus while Ron was hiding his smile behind his hand.
“Plus, I told Nevs to blame it all on me if we were to get caught and all.”
[2:27AM]
how touching of him
i had no idea he didn’t know
So glad your brain’s still useful, so glad
“He’s so weird. I can’t with him. He’s just a beard, rambling nonsense.”
Fulvia comes back to the castle but she has to adjust to her new restrictions.
Then, she had let her manager down. So, what. She had done worse in the past few months. He would find something to make it work, she knew it. He always did. Else he could just break her contract and end everything, saying goodbye to her last steady financial support as a minor.
She got out of the comfy warmth of her bed and squatted down around the pile of mess Dean had made, “I’m not cleaning that up when we’re done.”
“Well, contain yourself or you will make me blush, Fulvia,” an eyebrow sardonically raised before going back to his so usual serious tone, devoid of any emotions, but with a new shadow in his eyes, “I told you, I only helped bringing the furniture and mobilising hands to move in.”
Once the majority of the mess was washed up, he cupped her face with his hesitant hands and dried away her last tears; she avoided his eyes, looking somewhere else.
“I’m sorry; it’s just that you’re a little gloomy since yesterday evening, for somebody who had a conversation with her godfather’s love muffin, I mean.”
The phrase echoed in her head while passing again and again the exchange she just had in her head. Blaise had also told her so.
“We won’t.” said at the same time both Neville and Marigold.
, but still.
“Oh shut it, Ron. Don’t go full manly-handling the situation and big brother on me now.”
Moreover, one could think there wasn’t enough free time to properly attend a work and to financially rely on it – given it would be the only imaginable reason to get one in the first place at such young age.
So yeah, basically, it was very important to me to explain that Marigold being a girl and being raised by Sirius (& Remus) changes all the character of canon!Harry potter. The same goes for Fulvia, as a girl in the eyes of her father is not the same on her as it is on Draco, plus she deals with her own way with her rebellious stage and all. If you have any questions about how I proceeded in the choosing of the names or why they have their characters and temperament, just ask!
There was a bit of shame passing through her in those moments, bringing her back to deep and dark moments when she used to suffer from more frequent binge eating episodes.
“MISS POTTER.” It seemed near enough to soon put the girl on stage in troubles.
Remus mumbled to himself more than to Marigold, “So, that’s how it is. I tried to reach out to him but he prefers ignoring my calls, excusing himself with being too busy with work. I should have known it was totally bullshit, tsk. We haven’t had a proper conversation since April, what a healthy relationship, huh?”
Marigold gasped in surprise and threw her phone away as Hermione had clearly entered the dorm and she hadn’t heard her, too absorbed in her previous... activity?
Marigold had some hard shit to unpack with her guardians/godfathers and she's getting there.
Cormac is repeating his year in Hogwarts.
[2:53PM]
i’m home.
She tried hard to remain poker-faced, but the series of weird actions the old man had just pulled took her by surprise and it suddenly was the hardest endeavour of her life. She chose to answer with a flat tone instead, “I’m fine. I went in town yesterday, to the bank and did what I was advised to with my account. Thank you. And I’m settling for French classes as I already intended to, Blaise will help me and I know French already I had a French au pair for a while. I’ll take the same class as he does as it’s the same coefficient as the ballet one. So I won’t need to take another new subject.”
She wanted so much to believe in her best friend’s words and yet knew better than to get rid of her apprehension.
[9:36AM]: You there?
“So this dude is your prince charming? The one that helped you back on your feet when he shoved you in the first place? The one who walked with a dark knight aura surrounding him? The one that you keep obsessing over. The one-”
The professor took a deep breath finally releasing Potter’s arm, he concentrated on Fulvia now, crouching without inviding her personal space, “Are you okay, Miss Malfoy?” His face implied ‘as okay as you can be after beating each other’s faces, “Can you walk?”
“Well, I take pride in being my own strong and responsible female figure!” He added smugly. Fulvia was fully laughing now. Knowing Theo had issues with his family and his mother in particular and making jokes around it was some really common for their group.
Their break-up had been quite fussy, between her friends trying to talk her into it for months on end, repeating her it was becoming more than really toxic for her, the other sixth year boys’ comments about her – Cormac had also took for habit to tell lies about their intimacy to load of his friends – he happened to be violent towards her and finally even Malfoy had been involved.
Said useless brain started on its own a top 10 of the happiest moments she had lived with Cormac as she walked errand in the room, quickly followed with the worst ones. She forgot how it was to be sad-drunk. She desperately needed a distraction; else the pearls that peacefully hung at the edge of her eyes for now would dramatically fall down her cheeks for hours.
He turned towards her with a sad smile, “Yeah, you’re right sorry I understand you have other things to do and- it’s just- well you don’t want to be part of an old quarrel between Sirius and I. It’s just- you, better than anybody else, know how secretive he can be sometimes and mostly when it’s about himself and about not being a burden for others and all that drama queen discourse shit.” he dropped once and for all the formal approach. They both had an awkward muffed laugh at that.
“Mari! Defend me! Ron called me a snake lady! Mari?” Ginny clutched at her sleeve.
I'm posting them again bc i need to be sure everyone see them, i love them so so so so much...
On weekdays, food was usually served from 12:30am to 1:30pm, sometimes 2pm if you were lucky enough. The Great hall was still open and one could take all the time in the world to eat, the kitchens would simply open close around that restricted time.
didn’t have the heart to without you since you’re the one setting the fun. not cool if you ain’t there xxx.
One of the two students would randomly throw a sneaky remark, an insult or even sometimes just a dirty look and it’s all they needed to bring attention towards the both of them.
“Well,” she answered, “it is what it is. Are they doing well? The plants, I mean”, a faked innocent interest sprouting on her face.
She stormed out of her bed, put on warm socks, sneakers, trading her pyjamas shirt for a bra, a simple large tee, the first warm cloth she could grab, a pair of sweatpants; all in this very order. It’s unnecessary to say that the sight of Marigold running in her room, trying to put sweatpants and tripping on herself while having sneakers already on was a certain degree of pathetic, almost worthy of the most famous Greek tragedies. All trace of gracefulness forgotten.
“Yeah Marigold, do as Hermione says, be a good girl and don’t dig too far. You won’t be able to take it anyway and you’ll end up getting too high to know how to cry.”
The bed they were sat on was a mattress relying onto treated wooden pallets forming the bed base. The whole thing fitted the alcove in the room, an egress window placed just above it on one of the inclined walls.
The annoying taping sound of the antic computer keyboard somewhere around the register was growing louder and louder on Marigold. Ron wouldn’t stop asking questions about Remus’s discussion with her, which she didn’t intend to share. Said discussion also had contributed to nourish her anger since the previous evening, making her more and more irascible as hours passed.
Best timing ever for the alcohol to kick in. Ughhhhh
She didn’t like that.
“And I’m sure that if I look in the list of the people you follow, I will find at least one more account of their models-”
“You can’t tell me my frustration is not valid. You know how important this year is to me. You know university closely pay attention to the two last year of school and we’re even hosting the Athletic Events in spring! How can I stay composed and be fine with you when you’re,” she indicated vaguely with her hand towards Marigold on the floor, “like that!”
“Shut up and don’t forget to be thankful for the lending, and gROSS!! Don’t put your feet there, I promised him to give it back in the same condition I found it in! Else I’ll have to clean the chemistry lab.” He snorted while trying to shove her feet off the dashboard of the car.
She felt pitiful.
Blaise’s face and worried eyes but soft smile flashed behind her eyelids as she had clutched her eyes, killing the whine that had came with her tears rolling down her cheeks. Somewhere in her mind, she knew she had still been in denial or in a form of denial at least. But, hearing her aunt saying things like that to her, reflecting the intentions of Blaise and others towards her was the last string.
“Mari!”
“Oh c’mon, we’re on the same side now, snowflake.”
12:58am.
“Okay, but I’m not dropping it yet. Yeah I got your message in the week. Sorry I didn’t call sooner. I was busy with other clients. So, what kind of advice do you need? Did you get in trouble with your fake ID? Did you get a STD? Don’t tell me you need me for coming with you to an abortion clinic because I swear I’ll fly back as soon as possible but please get an appointment ASAP, don’t wait for me-”
The Great Hall was still pretty silent and Marigold was about to ask her friend what bothered them when she heard it.
That’s how she’d found herself in the dungeons; in her chemistry professor’s office more precisely.
McGonagall stared at her for few more seconds, examining the girl from head to toe, and then left the group of students.
The silence lasted only for the new information to sink in and unlock the meaning of it.
One boy advanced towards her, balancing himself by putting his elbow on McLaggen’s shoulder, a threateningly dirty expression covering his face, “That’s not what we said, and know it’s not the first time people refer to you this way. Better get used pretty quickly because loads of people won’t consider not hurting your feeling anymore. Also I can try and convert you to the right path” He hinted her lower body and winked.
She hurriedly pulled herself from the wall and expended the space separating them. She rolled her eyes for the umpteenth time tonight. He tried to close the void between them and intended to reach up to her but she harshly smacked his hand away as if she had been already burnt in anticipation of the touch.
“And what if I am, ridiculous I mean, since when do I care about people’s opinions.” She spited, keeping purposely the same low voice her friend had employed.
“And I’m telling the truth when I say a lot of people want to see you bleed, you should’ve thought before letting your arrogant arse do and say whatever it pleases. Also, keep your boyfriend and your lot out of Fulvia’s business; else, you’ll regret it.”
He sat next to Marigold, also taking a plate of food. “I was in the greenhouses... taking care of the plants... kinda...” he smiled awkwardly at Marigold, her eyes dripping pure malice at the information.
Marigold finally went back to her former position, facing her friends who were expectedly looking at her.
[3:01PM]
She hadn’t closed the curtains and she had woken up with the light filtering through the windows.
What’s important to know is that somehow the fight ended and every single one of the involved students were sent to the infirmary after being promised to spend some time in detention and doing some work around the castle as to make amends for the disturbance caused and their awful and unexampled behaviour.
She strolled between groups, for an hour now, to offer drinks – and sharing some – or food, making sure everyone was having fun, enjoyed their nights and was not going through heated arguments.
That’s not what she focused on.
“And yet, here you still thought it would be a great thing to come to me then? How dense are you? No forget that, more important, how drunk are you? You can’t even stand. I saw you walking; you’re like a baby deer trying to walk for the first time. I almost feel sorry for your liver.” She didn’t sound like she was sorry for a bit.
“Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four. Again, with me. Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four. Breathe in for four, hold it for four and release it for four.”
“Don’t worry
This time was no exception when she almost scathed her words as she comfortably sat on Dean’s laps, her calves hanging out from one armrest and her back pressed against the leg Dean had curled up on his armed chair as he passed one arm around her waist.
She tried a small smile back.
She left the room and headed to the Great Hall for lunch.
Her mouth went dry, too angry at herself and at the turn of the events, and too bewildered by what was happening in front of her. She didn’t even reacted when her other friends had joined them in the bookshop and where also witnessing the exchanges of the two people on the other side of the street.
“It’s okay, I’m waking up anyway, I didn’t hear you. You’re looking for something?” she indicated with her chin the way Dean was awkwardly standing over several piles of clothes and accessories out of Marigold’s chest.
“Of course, sweetheart. What ‘bout you? How do you feel?”
At that, all the heads but Marigold’s turned to Dean, intrigued by what the dark skinned boy had just said. She just laughed at the nick name that brought back memories. The boy explained to the other Gryffindors present on the couches and armchairs that the name was an invention from both Marigold’s and his during their work time, outside school.
All of them seemed peaceful and happy. All of the shit that would happen later was nowhere in sight of course, still she felt more than sad but couldn’t describe it.
Once she felt better she removed her duvet for good and met the worried face of her best friend, “Hey, good to have you back.” He smiled.
No more words were spoken.
She was now fully awake but remained lost in the fog of her spiralling mind.
He made her feel reassured and comfortable.
How could she be so full of it and yet feeling this empty, like a vessel filled up, submerging with void.
“Hm, I don’t know, I would say all the unsolicited dick-pic girls have saved in their galleries would be evidence enough what do you think? And by girls, I mean, with just Hermione, Malfoy here and I, there should be enough proof to make you appear as sexual predators preying on girls who didn’t ask for shit. Having your daddies up there in the Ministry won’t help you forever, and in this special case, it shall even bring them down. So shame on you for not being able to tame your dicks but as she said earlier, you can kindly fuck off.”
She locked her phone and buried herself under the sheets of her bed. She set her alarm for 5:30.
I assure you to meet your entire expectations princess. Np ily too. Sleep tight _(:3」∠)_
were even easier to hide. Nobody had ever really noticed them and she intended to keep it this way.
Saying the room was freezing cold after that would be an understatement. Luna stepped in, trying to get some of the pressure down.
She heard Blaise ask a girl what the rally was all about but didn’t had the time to ear her answer as she made out the identities of the moving figures on the stage.
“So let’s say I can’t win by opposing direct strength,” her words were a little more hashed, “very well, but unfortunately for them, I know exactly how to take their breath away and it’s all about the flick of the wrist.”
Last year, she had held her ground against false accusations, against low blows and public settling of scores. She couldn’t bring herself to do the same things all over again; the two months separating the two school years had been awfully eventful and had changed her in a way she wouldn’t stand for any of her past words even though it was the honest truth.
She felt the bed subsiding under the weight of another body.
She had seen the girl, and eventually convinced to herself there was no way the real Malfoy was back; she seemed to be her former self’s dusty ghost at most.
. He’s not my boyfriend. Just my best friend, we already talked about it.”
She winced at the call of her name
“I- I don’t know what else to tell you for you to get how serious this is and how bad you’re getting. I mean, you’re not like three years ago, but still. You’ve been weird all summer. And now that we’re back to school, I don’t know. I thought you would, like, go back to be the old captain of the track team and show example to the new years and, yeah...”
“As I demonstrated it to you, we cannot allow ourselves to take any risks. I am sorry Miss Malfoy, I really am.” The long silver bearded man tried a little, still encouraging smile, “He agreed on letting you your prefect title...”
“You have no respect for women. You play them and use them as you please. You’re a jerk and a liar and just a pile of garbage in a flesh suit. Get lost!” her breath was heavy,
“SPA-? Spaghetti legs??? Those legs won the fucking relays and long distances at last year athletic events you know, blimey! Be fucking respectful.”
find the things
She was about to yell at them something like “HA-H, GAAAAAAAAY” but she noticed something and her legs suddenly felt heavy.
Sorry
do for each other, you know.”
[3:19PM]
“You said it yourself, I have no longer anything to do with him, he can do whatever he wants and you can take care of him how you please.” She almost spit these last words. “Does Malfoy know you call her that by the way?” she gave her most arrogant smile; she showed that she knew what place they held in Malfoy’s circle.
... yeah that was kinda stated on his birth certificate??? i excepted something i didn’t know.
As she walked down the corridors near Dumbledore’s office, she heard the harsh and loud noise of a door slamming shut, and just had the time to catch a glimpse of a dark silhouette before bumping into it. The shock was such that she fell to the ground straight on her butt. Artistic curses escaped from her mouth as she mechanically searched for her glasses that had fell off somewhere.
oh okay
“Are you sure? That’s not what it looked like this morning. I know damn right the jumper wasn’t yours in the first place, still you got so aggressive.”
The four of them would often hang out together since then, but they were not as close with each other as they made the rest of the school believe. Or at least that’s what Fulvia thought.
Just as they were both about to punch each other, two arms stopped them, “ENOUGH!”
“Yeah, I mean, what else can I expect from the ‘traumatic experience I went through’?” She finger-gunned him to what he excitedly replied, finger-gunning her in turn, “trauma bonding check!”
[3:18PM]
[3:21PM]
She had dreamed about a sort of blurry fairy tale. It was a reminiscence of joyful times, as a child, loved by her parents. They were laughing together. She remembered the feeling of hope filling her heart, wishing for things to stay this way forever in their perfect little holiday house in Norway they went during the summers.
“Huh?!”
Malfoy stopped protecting her face out of shock and got hit by one of Marigold’s punches before she could grab at her hair and then slammed their foreheads together. She then took Marigold’s arms and rolled them both over before the girl could try anything, so she was the one hovering over her and she pushed Marigold’s head as hard as she could against the stone floor, her eyes rolling back under the sudden shock, Malfoy felt something hot spreading on the left side of her own face,
She felt awful, she was scared of what would happen next. Soft tears began to roll around her nose. He vision got blurry.
“What?! No! I don’t!!! It’s not me, it’s her. She’s all over the place!! I consistently fall on her vids just because we’re in the same area. Come on, guys.”
Basically, if it wasn't clear until now, Marigold is using cuss words when she's only in despair/distress or having one hell of a time. Else, she tries to change the slurs in imaginative sentences.
Fuck. She needed the money. Fuck. She needed to find a lawyer. Fuck. She needed to call her aunt. Fuck. She needed to get out of her life.
Fulvia anxiously released the smoke from her mouth as she was looking for words to explain the delicate situation she was in. She opened her mouth and met Mark’s eyes through the screen of her phone. She knew the man enough to say she had never seen him relaxed or close to it even once, but the look he gave her made all the words she could gather escape her once again. She stub out her cigarette in the ashtray, and tried to word some excuse but didn’t even have the time to stutter an syllable for Mark came out of his shocked state.
How to say it properly?
Fulvia could only barely walk straight, but soon, Pansy and Theo were back at her sides. She was numbed out, only aware of Blaise’s warmth against her body. They looked like friends helping another friend when this latter had one ankle damaged but wanted to go somewhere else. She only focused on putting one foot after the other, careful to rely on her friend when the pain was stabbing at her leg like a thousand needles.
Being useful was exactly what happened to lack at this precise moment. She stood sit still in one of the chairs Professor Lupin had in his office. As for himself, Remus was pacing behind his desk, roaming his mind for something to say. He then faced the window, his hands crossed on his lower back while looking in the void through a window, trying hard to keep the professional boundary.
Marigold settled for shoving her earbuds further down her ears, hiding a smile as she tried to concentrate her attention back on her paper. Ginny gasped, falsely offended, “Hermione, you’re my last hope, please slap him for me, I’m too far and can’t even reach his spaghetti legs!”
She went and sat back at the window seat, sipping from the bottle before dialling her aunt’s number as she lit up a cigarette and cracked the window open.
“Oh, because I’m still wanted there? I thought I wasn’t good enough for you and couldn’t bother to show my face sorry, champ’”
Ron talked first:
Why would the only two loves of my life ignore me? Did I do something again?
“I don’t know what’s happening, but I swear I won’t tell anyone, sweetheart. Come on, tell me!”
I hope you enjoyed it! Leave a comment/constructive criticism/kudo, don't be shy ;)
“Tsk... careful!” spitted words coming from the other person’s mouth while roughly helping her to get back on her feet by raising her up by the arm as if she weighted nothing – which last time she checked, was very not the case.
[2:24AM]
She didn’t like that everybody around was suddenly acting so different towards her. She hated that it was because of her. So she cut short to it.
“Oh, okay. Is that friend Blaise? Is he okay right now.”
Stating that out loud, it was actually possible, but in this scenario he wouldn’t have kept quiet about it.
She couldn’t help the small feeling of awe for the... boldness and nerve of her sworn enemy who had just practiced the most badass parkour escape from a stage to a 13ft opened window in the wall, only leaning on few old stones.
[3:22PM]
“Sorry to drop this bomb on you out of nowhere.”
“Self care™.” She opened her eyes while turning her head and saw Hermione lying on the bed mirroring her, fondly smiling at her.
obsessed by Malfoy’s existence.”
[2:58PM]
She turned back towards her friends who anxiously looked at her, even Hermione tried to repress her I-told-you-so face. They knew being summoned by Remus Lupin of all the professorial corpse was bad news for her.
“I won’t do anything to you I just want to talk.  Come on.”
“I’m serious, Ginny, not the part about fighting you but about what you said allegedly happened last night. Did I do something and blacked out. Because I have no recollection whatsoever about something that would make me upset apart from talking with this dick head over there.” She hinted at her ex boyfriend somewhere in the great hall, “OMG don’t tell me I danced naked in front of everybody again, tell me I went to bed before exposing myself, please, please, please.” Marigold was out of breath, fear creeping up more and more in her mind with all the scenarios getting wilder and wilder.
Even though Sirius had reassured her a little, she eventually let the frustration of the day get to her and fell asleep with tears hanging at the corner of her eyes, without really being able to differentiate which tear belonged to which issue.
“No, I’m sorry Professor.” She winced.
“Hey guys, what’s up? Who made a really bad pun?!” taking his professional voice and a serious look Neville added “With the look on your face Mari, I can tell it’s at least a six out of eight on the bad-meme-lord-pun scale. And more importantly who’s the terrorist?”
So she hastened to open the second door, to which the lock was a bit tricky. Once in the room, they all sat on the surfaces the furniture offered, Pansy knowingly opening the window and closing Fulvia’s dressing door before sitting on the window seat. Theo was on the desk chair, and Blaise and Fulvia on the bed, facing each other.
Ginny was a lot of things but she wouldn’t just erase Marigold from her family circle just because they fought.
First, she would cross the school fence by the east side when she was back from work, hiding from dorms’ windows, and she’d open the kitchen offices’ door with her card and sneak in.
“Ughh, Fulvia I swear I’m gonna kill your girlfriend!” Fulvia chocked on her saliva, knowing perfectly who Pansy was referring to, “I’m going to shove her fucking audacity down her throat and she’ll slowly die out of air and I’m gonna enjoy watching her suffer.”
“It’s gonna be alright, love. You’re strong and you’re here for your friend. I’m sure that to him, it’s what counts the most.”
“AW, come on; don’t tell me you’re still bitter about how it ended in fifth year?”
“Professor Lupin asked for you. He is waiting in his class office.”
Marigold locked her eyes down to her feet, little shades of red darkening her face and hears, her glasses getting steamed by her exasperate breath.
Some others but fewer ones had closely followed the flow of actions.
Mornings after having literally traded all of the 60% of water composing her body for alcohol sure didn’t make things easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy for her brain and her stomach. It was much more about being achy-achy-lemon-fucking-let-me-die.  Last time she had done that it dated back to her last summer, in France, so few weeks ago in fact.
well nothing new i just had the confirmation that he was a huge fucker.
Her nerves were about to make her lose it and go batshit. She had no one/nothing to take it out on and it was even upsetting. She was working on controlling her emotions, but fuck, she had her own limit in these fucking trying times.
They pretty much almost all understood something was wrong, that it wasn’t a question of life or death but still an annoying one judging by the seriousness of Ron. They wouldn’t have found out what her friend had just discovered if it wasn’t for his stupidly clairvoyant monster of a sister.
She tried to be as gentle as she could bring herself to be, a busted lip was always a pain in the arse until it healed, for each single everyday thing would be painful. No more speaking, nor eating, nor sleeping, nor showering or else normally until the scar would disappear.
“Thanks Mio-. Wait what?!” She looked at her traitor of a friend who was smiling angelically.
hand tried to grab one of her wrists; she did her best to attempt and repress a shriek. She wouldn’t give
Not about any particular event. Just in general.
Blaise winced at that and threw him a death glare, silently writing his friend’s eulogy in his head.
Yay, not awkward nor weird at all Potter, good job.
This very morning she was alone in her cool dorm. The other beds were empty; there was no surprise such as finding one of her dormmates that had come back to the room way later than her.
“Oh yeah, don’t worry I didn’t miss your attitude towards me since we’re back to school. It would be hard to. It’s warming my heart to know I’ll be able to count on you in the hard moments though, thanks for being another voice of disapprobation in my head, Ginny, it means a lot to me.” She smiled warmly but her eyes remained cold.
When her vision got steadier, she took in the dark corridors they were in, flowers catered all over the place, Potter mirroring her position, clearly exhausted on the floor, her bottom lip busted and the bridge of her nose swollen, both bleeding. She was having a heated conversation with someone but it seemed blurry in the way Fulvia couldn’t grasp anything tangible to help her understand what situation they were in.
“Annnd now you’re just gross.”
[3:16PM]
“What do you mean?” her tone was still poisonous, sneering at the unsolicited pet name.
Fulvia settled herself to get her breathing back to normal, her hand swiping away the sweat on her face. It didn’t feel like sweat on her hand, she knew this sensation too well. Her eyes stopped on her bloody fingers, she was trying to listen to her body and understand where it was coming from. Her body answered to her back and brought a sudden ringing pain on her eyebrow and in her nose. Her bad ankle made her wince as well, she might have had twisted it again somehow even though the ankle support was still there.
She dropped the damp towel around her shoulders, picked up a warm pair of leggings and a jumper to put over her clean tee-shirt. She slipped back her ankle support and grabbed the water bottle beside a plate covered in foil.
She wore the club sport bra and the matching booty shorts. The thing was that it appeared to be at least one size below her own. How to say that, there was no way if she really wore them during her practice everything would stay in place.
[7:56PM]
“It’s okay, Blaise. Don’t worry. Yes, Theo, that’s good, but, how am I supposed to explain all that?” she vaguely gestured at her face, hair and legs.”
“Mh-hm.”
Ron and Hermione were framing her sides on one of the couch
“Hold on, I’m doing it, stay here, you’re on duty. It’s my time to shine.”
She stayed silent after that for a while, looking at her plate, waiting for the murmurs to fill back the hall.
“You take that back immediately or I swear I’m killing you on the spot,” with the coldest tone she had ever used she now threw punches after punches, sometimes hitting the floor as Marigold tried to dodge the blows, “I said, take,” a punch, “that,” another punch, “back,” yet another punch.
