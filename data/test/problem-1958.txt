"That's not a meal. That's not even an appetizer," Malfoy said, his eyes still glued to the menu not even bothering to look at the little girl.
Harry ate dinner alone in his hotel room that night. At first, he felt bad about wasting his vacation days to room service inside alone when it was such a nice day to eat outside or go to a nice little restaurant. But Hermione called him so he decided to order in and stay in his room to talk to her instead.
Harry felt hot. He felt good that he was making Malfoy feel good and he never wanted this to end.
"Come on, clean up time," Harry smiled at his godson who groaned but started cleaning up the small mess they made. The paper Harry wanted to pick up manually to help Teddy get in the habit of cleaning up after himself while he couldn't use magic, but the glitter will definitely have to be magically cleaned.
Harry turned towards Malfoy and smiled, "It's breathtaking." He wasn't talking about the view.
"Please don't beat yourself up," Draco said.
"Malfoy? As in Draco Malfoy?
"What is it?" Ron asked.
"Hmm I'm more interested in your ass than winning, I can assure you."
Harry snickered and turned his head towards the table Malfoy sat it. Malfoy was nursing his mug of coffee with his left hand while writing in what looked like a journal with his right. His face scrunched up in concentration and ever so often he would bite the end of the pen he was using.
He felt Draco's gaze on the side of his head but kept staring straight ahead. He didn't say anything, but he was certain the grin on his face spoke a thousand words.
The man shook his head. "You usually don't, but we're almost full. I'm gonna go check to see if we have anything available."
Draco couldn't help the blush that crept on his cheeks. He looked up at the sky to try and hide it but Potter probably caught it.
Potter grinned, nodding his head. "So, what do you do? Besides fostering kids?"
Stepping inside, Harry was immediately engulfed in the scent of baby powder and lavender. The lavender was a gift from Luna to their entire friend group, claiming that they all needed some harmony in their lives, and apparently, that's what the lavender was for.
How could Harry argue with that?
The next day after work, he apparated to the nearest apparition point and headed to the coffee shop, book in hand. He greets Mimi as she knowingly started working on his usual order behind the counter with a smile.
"Can't believe that just happened."
"Would you like to get acquainted again?"
"I think I'm gay," Harry whispered in the safety of the darkness in their shared bedroom.
"They got adopted?"
"No. Before her was a little girl, she was younger and found a permanent home quicker. And before that was a set of twins who spent only two weeks with me."
"I don't know. You won't let me have a phone."
"I'll tell you everything if the date goes well," Harry promised and that seemed to satisfy both of them for now.
"Here we are, Mr. Potter," The bellboy, whose name Harry had come to learn was Haku, set the bags down in front of the door.
to notice him. On the field, he has to tell himself to focus on the snitch, not Malfoy.
Harry watched the way he stuck his tongue out before taking a bite of his food, something he noticed he did back at Hogwarts when he couldn't stop staring at him in the Great Hall no matter how hard he tried not to.
Harry had to ask. "Is she your daughter?"
His platinum blonde hair reached past shoulders but it was fuller than his father's had been and curlier. His eyes were still that beautiful grey but they looked more full of life. His perfectly small nose had a red tint to it, no doubt from the cold outside. And his lips -- Merlin, his lips. Harry had never wanted to kiss a pair of lips so much.
He didn't have a house-elf and honestly, he didn't feel the need for one. He took care of his small two-bedroom home and was more than capable of looking after Teddy when he gets him every weekend.
Draco rolled his eyes, turning around to rinse his hair, his back facing Harry. "Next time I'm topping."
"Don't worry they're all healed now."
Harry shivered under the cool February breeze as he struggled to get his door to open. Once inside the small little cottage, he walks in taking off his shoes and leaving them near the door. He grabbed his wand and turned on the lights around the house and made his way towards the kitchen.
Draco pecked his lips one more time before taking the ring out of the box and sliding it in Harry's ring finger. The beautiful silver band was decorated with two bright diamonds. On the same hand just one finger over was the beautiful stone ring Draco gifted him on their very first Valentine's Day together.
"We agreed on no makeup," She glared at the women in front of her.
Draco laughed and gently nudged Potter. "Ha Ha," he mocked him, slowly rolling his eyes. "Thanks for inviting me today."
Malfoy cleared his throat and reached into the wicker basket, pulling out a small box. "I have a gift for you."
"What are you doing here?" Harry found himself asking.
"Ah," Harry shook his head, "Rita Skeeter never misses."
Harry nodded in response. Malfoy turned around and walked in the same direction Ellie did.
When he didn't get an answer, he walked towards the showers to see if someone was still in there.
"We know a thing or two about that," Harry laughed, earning a smile from Malfoy.
The two went back to working until Harry's living room was back to its spotless self -- well as spotless as it can be with a child running around.
Everything looked and smelled so good, including Draco.
"I actually need to talk to you guys about something," Harry said.
He knocked on the adjoining door leading to Ellie's room and waited for an answer. After three knocks, the door swung open revealing the eleven-year-old still dressed in pajamas.
"Wow, that's amazing. I wish I could paint, but I have two left hands and I'm right-handed."
Malfoy huffed, his hand is still wrapped around his cock, slowing his movements. He wasn't scared to make eye contact. Neither one of them said anything for a while, they just looked at each other.
"I want to fuck you," He found himself say.
Harry smiled, "Of course."
"Why would I lie, Ronald?"
"Your eyes are going to get stuck like that one day. And what a glorious day that will be."
The two made a date for Valentine's Day on Sunday.
Harry ordered alfredo pasta with lobster. He'd never had it before but the menu also included pictures and the dish looked too good not to try. Malfoy ordered a stir fry with white rice for himself, and broccoli pasta for Ellie with a side of fries, which made her smile before she quickly tried to hide it. But Harry caught it.
"I get that a lot," she shrugged. "What happened to your wife?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Lay back down for me," He said, not bothering to look at Potter. He took the time to study the small camera, eventually figuring out how to use it.
He admired Malfoy from behind. His pale skin covered in water droplets, his long legs — the same legs Harry has seen wrapped around a broom almost every day of every week, the legs he dreamed would someday wrap around his waist with his cock is buried deep inside Malfoy.
"-sit here and eat dinner as if you possess a once of civility and then maybe I might consider letting you go to the luau-"
Potter had a bag thrown over his shoulder and his regular round glasses were replaced with dark-framed ones. With his wild curls sticking up in every direction, Draco felt the air knocked out of his lungs when he smiled at him.
Harry made quick work of taking off his shorts and the t-shirt he was wearing, leaving him in his briefs. He went up to the table and slid on top, pulling the sheets up to his torso.
He quickly spotted Malfoy the second he walked in. His hair wasn't in the signature bun, but laying flawlessly on his shoulders, swaying slightly while he laughed at whatever the four were talking about.
"And that I'm glad it's you and not some weird, creepy stranger."
There he was, Draco Malfoy in a muggle coffee shop. Harry's muggle coffee shop. No Harry didn't own the place, but he was there every weekday for about an hour for the past four months and not once had he seen Draco Malfoy come in. Harry would've definitely remembered seeing the face of his old school nemesis in his favourite place.
"I'm thinking of adopting her. It's crazy but I feel like the best place for her right now is with me. She needs familiarity and stability."
"Mione, you're six months pregnant. You did not have to come help me pack and make me lunch," Harry said, taking a seat at the installed island in the middle of the kitchen. Hermione's pregnant form walked towards him and set the bread on the table next to a spread that looked like it could feed an army.
The cat seemed to understand and made her way down the small corridor leading to the two bedrooms in the house. They passed several pictures on the wall. Most of them were of Teddy. Some of Harry and his friends at Hogwarts and from a few years ago. He smiled at the new additions to the wall, several pictures of him and his boyfriend. Everything else in the hallway looked normal.
"I'm Luana, I'll be your masseuse for today. Please follow me."
"Oh yeah, I heard about that. Three months of marriage? Record-breaking if I say so myself."
"More than you know. But nothing ol' Harry can't handle," he pointed his thumb towards himself.
The conversation dragged on, Draco telling them more about Potter and about their dumb childhood rival making sure to leave out the magic part. He told them that he was recently divorced from a woman, making it clear that he was as straight as a ruler and nothing would ever happen between them.
"Is she a muggle?" He asked in a hushed whisper and Malfoy nodded.
He looked around the room, taking in the white simple interior. He heard a low instrumental coming from the speakers attached to the wall. It was soothing.
Mimi grinned, taking the bag from Harry and rummaged through it. "Harry if I didn't have a girlfriend and you weren't crushing on Drake, I'd kiss you right now."
Potter hummed in response. He swallowed the last of the cantaloupe he was eating before grinning. "Thank you for coming with me. You've definitely made this a memorable experience.
Harry decided that he would just wait and see what happened.
Harry followed her into a small hallway leading up to a room smelling strongly of lavender. It wasn't so much of a room as a private patio with curtains framing the space. Harry could hear the ocean outside along with birds chirping.
Grabbing Draco's hips, Harry huffed and pulled all the way out before slamming inside him again -- all the way up to his balls. He stilled for a moment, enjoying the tightness. Draco's muscles clenched around him and Harry's knees almost buckled.
He called them Friday night asking them to watch Teddy for him Sunday because he had a date and lucky for him, the two decided to stay in for Valentine's Day and could watch Teddy. They kept pressing Harry to tell them who he was going out with and Harry refused to tell them anything.
He started off by telling her about the bizarre twenty-four hours he had just experienced at the resort. Bumping into Malfoy, eating dinner with him, spending the day with him, and agreeing to spend more of his time with him.
On the eight note Harry received, it was hinted that his admirer might not be a muggle after all and Harry finally decided to go to Hermione for help.
He reached his hand to turn off the knob. "Leave it on," Malfoy whispered and Harry obeyed.
As he drifted off to sleep, Harry thought he should definitely get a cat.
He stared at himself in the mirror and smiled at his reflection. He looked good. Good enough to be seen in public with the walking greek god that was Draco Malfoy at least.
Draco reluctantly agreed until they had about ten pictures of the view and the two of them.
He mentally cursed at himself for sleeping through his alarm and quickly climbed out of bed. He got dressed, hoping that his booked 12 o'clock appointment would still be available by the time he reached the treatment room at 12:36.
Harry blinked in surprise, almost dropping the drink in his hands.
An hour later, everything was in place and Lionel started driving the boat while he told the two to put their wetsuits on over their swim shorts.
"Aloha. You must be Harry and Draco. I'm Lionel, your scuba instructor," he smiled.
That Monday was no different as Harry spotted the small piece of paper sitting on the table, waiting to open.
The restaurant was just as loud as it had been the first time Harry went there. But it seemed a little less crowded.
"I'd just like to know who. And from the most recent one I got, I think whoever it is, might be someone I know and they might be a wizard or at least know about magic."
Harry gasped when the door opened in front of him. It was definitely just as luxurious as it looked in the brochure.
"There we are," Draco said when the two approached the large oak tree at the far end of the park. Harry let go of Draco's hand, much to his chagrin, so he could set down the picnic basket. Since they couldn't use magic, Harry helped him lay down the blanket on the grass and arranged the wide array of food from the basket.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, pointing towards the direction of the door leading inside the hotel. "Let's go."
Malfoy on the other hand still looked the same yet nothing like the pretentious snob he knew back at Hogwarts. His hair was long and pulled back in a bun and his arms were crossed as he so obviously ignored the little girl's question.
He spotted the head of bright pink hair as soon as he entered the small shop and smiled.
Hermione handed Ron the note about magic and Ron eyes the piece of paper suspiciously before turning it around to read it. When Harry first saw it, he questioned whether it was just the muggle saying about sparks and magic between two people or actual magic. Harry had never once felt any sort of magic inside the shop. As far as he knew he was the only wizard who frequently visited the place
Harry went to put her down when he spotted something on her yellow collar. He went to remove it and saw that it looked like a small piece of paper. He gently set the cat down and made his way out of the small foyer.
Being a primary school teacher was not on top of the list of things Harry wanted to do. He only ever started teaching two years prior when Teddy got old enough for primary wizarding school.
"Is someone in here?" Harry asked, clutching his wand in his wand to prepare himself for whatever was making that noise.
Next time.
Harry was about to ask her what she meant when Malfoy spoke up. "Ellie's a flower girl at the wedding. Aren't you, Ellie?"
Harry's eyes widen. No way was Mimi trying to set him up with Draco Malfoy of all people. He was the blond Mimi told him about the week before. Malfoy was gay? "You're gay?" The words rushed out before Harry could stop himself and immediately regretted it afterwards.
He closed his book to see what careless individual or reckless child did that to him and was met with Ellie's grinning face inside the pool. Her signature red heart-shaped sunglasses framing her face while her arms rested on the edge of the pool.
Harry blushed and shot him a playful glare. "Must you tell the entire universe?"
He looked up to find Malfoy sitting down in front of him, a blush dusting his pale cheeks and a bottle of water in his hands. Harry looked at him then at the note then back up at him. He eyed Harry suspiciously, keeping his face blank and pushed a strand of hair behind his ear.
After a few moments, Malfoy nudged his cock against Harrys' mouth. He grabbed Malfoy's prick, parted his lips and gave a kitten lick at the top. He took in as much as he could. Malfoy hand was holding the back of his neck, supporting his head.
Teddy nodded, "He came over last week and brought toys. I forgot to tell you," The boy said with a frown as if he was mad at himself for not remembering to tell his godfather about his new toys.
Harry laughed. "He's blond. That's it. That's his most redeeming quality?"
Harry looked over the two who were still whispering, before Malfoy sat back up, grabbing his wine glass and slowly raised it with a smile on his face.
"It was good. Ran into an old schoolmate," Draco said, trying to stay nonchalant but he heard Ellie snort beside him.
"To my best friends and their beautiful partnership. I wish you guys a lifetime of happiness."
"Were you two friends?"
She always did this. Covered for Ron saying he was stuck at work and couldn't make their lunch date. Ron was feeling under the weather and Harry couldn't come over because then he would catch the bug.
They got their food and dug in, keeping the same light conversation.
Once he reached his usual booth, another note greeted him. Harry looked around and read the note.
Harry smiled, reaching for the key along with the envelope she handed to him and before he could protest, the nearest bell boy had his suitcase.
He stopped counting the number of times she's tried to set him up on a date and the number of times he's refused. Her intentions were always in the right place so sometimes Harry even indulged her and tried to hear about the people she wants to set him with.
She got out of the pool, dragging along a puddle of water with her while she reached for her towel two chairs away from Harry. She wrapped it around her torso before dragging a chair and moving it closer to Harry's.
Harry took in the new information. After a few more minutes of chatting, he decided to leave Mimi to her job and eventually left the coffee shop.
By five pm, Harry told Lionel they were ready to go back to the shore. He and Malfoy shared an awkward goodbye in the hotel elevator because he wasn't sure if he should hug the man, shake his hand, or do anything at all.
"Mimi, Potter," He nodded towards the two. "I was just leaving."
"Yes," The boy grinned a toothless grin. Harry rolled his eyes fondly and kissed him on the forehead before telling him to go find one of Luna and Ginny's many animals to play with.
"Do you have a camera by any chance?" Draco found himself asking.
He opened the book he brought with him. One he'd started earlier that year but never really got a chance to finish due to his busy work schedule. He was halfway through the book when he felt a splash of water hit him in the face, getting on all over his sunglasses.
"Merlin, Potter who knew you were such an intoxicating kisser?" He whispered against Harry's lips before sliding down Harry's throat sucking at his Adam's apple.
Although Malfoy claimed he fingered himself earlier, Harry was reluctant because he didn't want to hurt him but he also wanted nothing more than to be buried inside of him.
"Hello, do I need a reservation?"
"Fine with me, you rented me for the rest of the afternoon and It's only four," Lionel said looking at his watch.
After showering and changing to a pair of khaki shorts and a "Hawaiian" shirt as Hermione called it, he grabbed a pair of sunglasses and pocketed his wallet, and made his way downstairs.
"Oh Harry, you've met Drake!" She smiled "He's the guy I was telling you about."
No one paid him any attention.
Haku thanked him before making his way back towards the elevator and Harry let out a sigh as he opened the door to his room. Traveling and the time difference made him tired, and he already planned on taking a nap before he did anything else.
He stood in the middle of the room, checking the list he made inside his head to see if he missed anything else. He couldn't remember the last time he went on a trip anywhere outside of Britain, let alone by himself. But he needed this. Merlin, did he need this.
Malfoy went back to his food, taking a fork full of vegetables, and answered before putting it in his mouth. "The prophet. Went to visit Mother at the manor and saw it lying on the kitchen table."
She stood in the middle of their very bright and colourful living room, while ginny leaned against the fireplace, a mug in her hand and a small smile on her face. Harry loved Luna and Ginny's home. It always smelled of lavender and sage and everywhere you stepped, you would no doubt come in contact with some type of plant.
Malfoy nodded. "They found nice homes."
"Teddy no!" Harry yelled while being chased by an overenergetic seven-year-old with a bottle of magical glitter in his hand.
Harry beamed at the name. He reached forward for Draco's hands, pulling the two up from the ground. Their chests touched as the soft tune of I was Born To Love You by Queen played in the record player in their room.
"The notes. It's you."
Mimi made his coffee while he told her about his day at work and how fulfilling it was to work with children. When Mimi finished, Harry thanked her and paid for his coffee.
She still treated Harry like they were in their first years at Hogwarts, and Harry loved it. Yes, he was a twenty-six-year-old man but It was nice to have someone care for him as Hermione did. Molly Weasley did too but after divorcing her daughter, things were a bit rocky with the entire clan, Ron included.
Harry couldn't help the laugh that came out of his mouth as he almost choked on his pasta. "Sorry."
He wasn't.
"Who?" Ron asked.
The two laughed and fell asleep, holding each other, a smile on their faces and a huge weight lifted off both their shoulders.
"I-" Potter blinked, looking away from Draco's chest. "It's hard not to."
"I can see that," Mimi said. "You sure you don't wanna sit a while longer and have coffee with Harry? He's all alone"
Malfoy smirked, "So you want me to drown with you?"
Ready To Run by One Direction
"You always did have a sweet tooth back in school."
"Ooh, scuba diving" Jane piped up, wiggling her brows in an almost comical fashion.
"Well, we are strangers, aren't we?" Malfoy asked, leaning back into his seat.
Harry laughed, leaning on the counter, "Mimi, love, I never hired you as my matchmaker."
Draco chuckled, "Surely stranger things have happened. Like a crazy wizard looking to wipe out half of the human race."
The barista grinned at Harry and waved. Harry headed for the door when he heard Mimi's voice mix with the bell above the door as she yelled, "I'm a natural blond, you know!"
Harry picked up the small piece of paper from his table and looked around the shop to see if anyone was looking in his direction. Apart from him and Mimi behind the counter, there were three other people inside and all of them were scattered around the shop, tending to their own private matters.
He seemed to forget how to act like a human being around the blond.
Malfoy face remained in its usual blank state as he slowly nodded his head.
Luana had magic hands. That's the only way Harry could describe it as he slowly rose from the table thirty minutes later.
Now there he was, at the same resort, at the same time as Draco. A sick and twisted coincidence -- If it could even be called that.
Harry internally laughed at how cliché the entire situation was as he pulled back.
After finding the sixth note, he decided to finally ask Mimi if she's seen anyone weird lurking around his table. After drinking his coffee and getting a few chapters into his most recent book, he made his way towards the counter, smiling at Mimi.
Harry nodded and sat upright in his seat, finally deciding on a dish.
"I- Im-" Harry stuttered. Why wasn't he leaving? Why couldn't he leave? He internally screamed at himself.
And Draco did. The piece of fruit sliding into his mouth, Potter's finger slightly grazing his bottom lip leaving an almost tingling feeling. Draco didn't even register the fact that the fruit was now inside his mouth and that Potter was in fact right, it did taste amazing.
"That's always a nice job. One of my best friends is a doctor."
Harry smiled at the gesture. "How did you two meet?"
"Good morning to you too," Draco said sarcastically and Ellie rolled her eyes. "It's ten, Ellie. We're meeting Margot and Jane at ten-thirty. Why aren't you dressed?"
He was frozen in place. His feet were heavy and jellylike at the same time. His eyes widened as they made eye contact with Malfoy who surprisingly looked unbothered -- not surprised but more so annoyed at the interruption.
Once he reached the lobby, he spotted Potter waiting for him. He was wearing a flowy tank top with green beach shorts with palm trees on them. Draco caught a glimpse of his chest and his toned arms and almost tripped over nothing.
Everything felt right.
The three ate and made small conversation, Harry learning more about Ellie, carefully avoiding the topics of her parents.
"You look amazing," Harry whispered.
Draco's eyes widened at the fact that Potter just called him by his first name. For probably the first time since they've known each other.
"Yeah." Draco nodded. Harry let out a mix of a sob and chuckle.
He slipped his tongue inside Harry's mouth and moaned in his mouth. Harry whimpered and shivered at the water he felt sliding down his back wetting his shirt. His glasses fogged up but he didn't need his sight. Not now. Not when all he could taste was Malfoy.
Ellie rolled her eyes, "I guess?"
"Thanks, babe," Margot said, reaching forward to place a kiss on her fiance's cheek. "Now. Tell me what happened last night Ellie," Draco was about to interrupt when Margot gave him a look that shut him up.
gay man.
He made his bed, never really feeling comfortable leaving his room a mess for the hotel staff to clean, then sat on the bed and waited for Ellie who emerged from her room not shortly after. Without knocking -- something Draco had lectured her on but he decided not to say anything today.
Draco smirked, "It's called fashion, Potter. Don't expect you to know anything about that."
"It's quite a distraction, especially while I'm trying to beat your team."
Harry woke up at 12 o'clock, the same time he had booked his spa appointment.
"Accio sunglasses," The pair of sunglasses floated atop the stairs of Grimmauld Place and landed into Harry's waiting hands. He let out a satisfied sigh and pocketed his wand before making his way towards his suitcase next to the couch and placed the glasses inside.
Draco Malfoy was a writer. He had a work of fiction published under a pseudonym and was currently working on his second novel. He lived near the beach in Italy and he surfs. He loved the beach, poetry, and baking. He owned a muggle record player just like Harry and his favourite muggle band was Queen.
"We should do this again," Draco blurted out before he could stop himself.
His table was empty.
There was a soft knock on the door and Harry muttered "Come in."
"And then there were two." Malfoy smiled, taking a sip of the white wine he was drinking.
"We're here for a wedding," The little girl said, looking and sounding bored.
: such a coincidence
: for the record, we are dating, right? Because, you know, I like you and you like me and stuff? So
After dinner, he made floo call to the Tonks household and spoke to Teddy about his homework and the fact that he needs to start putting every single one of his toys in the toy chest in his room before he leaves. Harry then listened to Teddy chat about his day at school before biding both him and Andromeda goodnight.
"Thank you," Draco said.
Draco blushed under his stare but thanked him for the compliment. "So do you,". Draco had what looked like a picnic basket in his hands and Harry was suddenly more excited for their date. "Shall we go or do you need more time?" He asked.
He picked it up as a hobby but soon found himself in love with it. It was therapeutic -- got him out of his head for a while. He didn't stop and he only got better until Jane convinced him to share his art with the world.
He made time every month to go see his mother. His father, well his father was rotting away in Azkaban. Draco hasn't seen him in eight years and he's not planning on it any time soon.
"Harry James Potter," Another sob escaped Harry's mouth while Draco smiled up at him, nothing but love and fondness in his eyes. "I love you more than I thought it was possible to love another person. You bring out the best in me you push me to do good and be good always. I've known you for more than half my life and you were always one of the kindest most beautiful souls I've ever known. I'm eternally grateful you agreed to go on a date with me three years ago and even more grateful for the life we've built together since then.
"I don't want to."
"Ginny and I are fine. More than fine, actually, but Ron won't listen. He'll come around eventually," Potter shrugged. Draco could hear the uncertainty in his voice but didn't comment on it.
: YES

You were the me at home, the me getting scolded by my parents, the me who was so terrified. And I hated that part of me, and because I was too much of a coward to actually do something about the mess I was, I instead targeted you.

AND I want to make sure that u know this isn’t some kind of OP!Harry story (which I’m not bashing at all bc sometimes u need those fics where people realize that Harry is actually fucking amazing like fight me right now). Just. It’s established in canon that he accomplishes things which are simply Not Normal for your average teen wizard (the patronus thing is just one example, remember how impressed the tester at the OWLs was after Harry showed him Prongs? That was in an exam setting, with no Dementors there and TWO YEARS after Harry had learned the spell. And yes, the other DA members learned the spell as well, but again, they were (mostly) fifth years and it was a classroom exercise. Harry managed the spell at a really young age while being emotionally distressed and in the presence of like a thousand dementors even though he reacts extremely bad to their presence.) I truly think Harry could be one of the most powerful wizards of Britain – he simply doesn’t really feel the need to push himself more than he has to. That’s why I don’t think Slytherin!Harry fics with Harry being much more powerful than in canon are extremely implausible – a Harry in Slytherin is ambitious and would push himself more, and the skills and the magical power were there all along.
Harry moaned and grabbed a handful of Malfoy's ass. Merlin this had to be heaven. Malfoy whimpered and turned around, his face all but slamming against the cold tile of the bathroom stall. For one second Harry forgot they were in a bathroom — a very public bathroom.
Harry heard shuffling before he heard Ron's voice on the other line, no doubt it was him holding the phone now.
"I've been living with muggles for years and it still fascinates me how they live," Draco said, taking a bite out of a very juicy strawberry.
"I am a child," Ellie huffed and crossed her arms across her chest as the first waitress came back to the table.
Harry put his hand up, "Exactly. We were children literally at war with a madman. No need to apologize, Draco, we all did things we're not proud of."
"I definitely like this Draco more though."
"Their love story is one for the books if I'm honest," Malfoy said.
"This is so good," He said. "You have to try this." His hand reached Dracos lips catching him off guard. "Open."
After his calls, Harry headed down the corridor leading to his bedroom, picking up spare toys he found on the ground and smiling fondly at them before opening the door to Teddy's bedroom and putting them away.
"So you're telling me that you left me these notes because you wanted to be my friend?"
"Malfoy," Harry whispered once again. Harry didn't even notice someone standing next to him until she spoke up.
"Harry, we both know this is the first real meal you've had in over a week," She said and took the seat next to Harry. "Besides, I wanted to see you before you left."
"Merlin, Malfoy, you're so tight," Harry groaned, feeling Malfoy stretching to adjust to him.
"We're meeting a man named Lionel near the beach over there," He said pointing at the beach, wherein the small distance, Draco noticed a small boat he assumed was for them.
Jane was a Literature professor at the University of London and  Margot was an artist just like Malfoy. He learned that Jane was actually the one who gave Malfoy the idea to foster and that he was the best man at their wedding.
"Surreal," Draco breathed out once he was finally free from the mask on his face. "So surreal."
"You're welcome," She giggled before turning around and running out of his classroom, her pigtails bouncing in every direction.
That's when he noticed him. Draco Malfoy in the showers, his back turned to Harry and he's naked. The water spraying his back. His ass looked even better
"Does he come here often?" Harry asked Mimi.
Draco loved it.
Malfoy looked at him. Harry tried his best to maintain eye contact, aware of how intense the atmosphere was.
He was nauseatingly gorgeous and Harry willed himself to stop staring.
Harry was speechless, to say the least. He hadn't seen the man in over eight years, not since his trial where Harry testified and later shook his hands thanking him after he was pardoned. The last he heard, Malfoy had left the country. And here he was in the same resort as Harry.
The restaurant was packed, Harry noticed as he made his way towards the front desk. Loud booming music could be heard from yards away.
Instantly, the fear left Draco's body simultaneously as the feeling of freedom kicked in.
"Aloha," Potter smiled at him and Draco did the same.
"I envy you, Harry. I could really use a vacation," Hermione groaned as she sat on Harry's sofa, lifting her feet up to sit them on Harry's lap.
Harry closed his eyes, feeling the soft petals under his feet and the magic and love radiating around them. He hears a soft meow every now and then making it sound as if the cat was singing along to the song and smiled.
"I don't like cops," Ellie said. "I think I wanna be a doctor when I get older."
Malfoy sent him a warm smile before turning towards the little girl, his smile turning back to the scowl he had on his face earlier. "Do you realize what time it is?"
He then floo called the Weasley household. Hermione answered and Harry heard the shrill cry of his one-year-old goddaughter in the background. Harry offered to come over to help but Hermione said she was just teething. The two talked and Ron eventually joined after he put Rose to bed.
"He's so nice," Teddy gave Harry an excited nod. "I'll bring my new toys next time," He added. Harry laughed at the fact that Teddy was already focused on a new topic, completely disregarding their last one.
Newly divorced Harry Potter.
"Ex-wife. And we just wanted different things."
"Okay, no more TV for you ever again," He interrupted.
"What about Ellie?"
"Well, it's three o'clock in the afternoon and you were supposed to meet Jane for your dress fitting at two-thirty."
"You'd be surprised," Margot said.
He couldn't see anything but felt the bed move and then Ginny's hand on his chest.
"It's you isn't it?" Harry finally broke the silence.
After his massage, he headed back to his room to change into swimming trunks before finding his way to the large pool outside the hotel.
This was the sixth one he had gotten so far, and if his assumption were correct, he would be getting these until Valentine's Day or until he stopped going to the coffee shop.
"Hey! My goddaughter is no monster."
Potter giggled. Fucking giggled.
"I am," he chuckled, ignoring Malfoy's smirk next to him. "It's so nice that you guys are getting married. I didn't think it was legal yet."
"Glad to know I've been the main subject of the Chosen One's wet dreams," Malfoy panted grinding back on Harry's already leaking prick.
"Harry," Draco whispered and that's all it took for the tears to start spoiling. "Oh love, please don't cry."
The rest of the dinner went smoothly and the small group never ran out of things to talk about.
Draco was horrified, "We did no such thing!"
The songs mentioned in this chapter are:
The brochure Hermione gave him was on the coffee table covered in stains from the scones he had for breakfast and didn't bother cleaning it up. He lived alone and he was prepared to make the best of it. Starting with a two-week vacation to Hawaii.
He tried his best to put it out of his mind while he played with Teddy at the park on Saturday and when they went out for ice cream at Florean's. Harry had to admit that after the first few notes, he smiled at every one of them and looked forward to the next one.
"Malfoy," Harry whispered once again, pushing his glasses further up the bridge of his nose. "I'm sorry, I wasn't looking."
Draco, pulled off his shirt, not missing the sad, shocked look on Potter's face when he saw the scars.
"Yes, I did. May I have this dance?" He reached his hand out for Harry which Harry gladly accepted. They swayed slowly, not really matching the pace of the song but neither of them cared.
He backed Harry up at the end of the hallway and Harry laughed, shielding his body before yelling, "Okay I surrender please! I'll give you two cookies after dinner!"
He heard a noise, someone groaning -- maybe a teammate left behind. He thought maybe someone was hurt.
His eyes were brighter, Harry noticed. More full of life. His nose was still perfect and pointy and his pale skin glowed under the dim pink lighting. His hair -- Merlin, his hair was tossed in a messy bun that looked too put together to actually be considered messy. Loose strands fell on his face and ears. Harry so desperately wanted to reach out and tuck them behind his ear.
"Wouldn't wanna die alone. That just seems sad."
Eventually, the subject changed, much to Draco's appreciation, and they started talking about their rehearsal dinner.
Harry's mouth went dry as his eyes widened. He wanted Harry to do what?
Draco arched thrusting his hips back as his hands found his own cock. "Yes! Fuck, don't stop!"
"Was he nice to you?" Harry asked.
"Good to hear from you Ron," Harry said and heard shuffling until Hermione's voice was back on the phone.
"They're all lies," Harry quickly said before chuckling, "Unless they're good, of course."
"And Ron is working tonight?" Harry said while Hermione served him a portion of the lasagna on the counter.
"Your shorts are absolutely ridiculous."
On Monday afternoon, Harry walked inside the coffee shop with a smile on his face. He waved to Mimi and ordered his coffee while asking her about her weekend. She told him about the weekend she spent studying for midterms and Harry listened with a smile, wishing he himself had gone to muggle Uni at one point.
Harry pumped against him, feeling the muscles around him clench and loosen as he fucked him with everything in him. He moved his hands around Draco's chest, finding one of his nipples and squeezing it.
Harry clamped his fingers on Draco's hips, no doubt leaving bruises, and gave a particularly deep thrust that had Draco screaming Harry's name. He found his prostate.
This is what harry spent countless nights and wanks fantasizing about. This was what it's like to kiss Malfoy. His lips were soft but firm he knew what he was doing. He was a great kisser.
Harry hesitated but decided to reach for his hand, barely holding it but managed to rub a small circle on the back of it, "You have to forgive yourself Draco. I forgave you a long time ago."
Part of Harry knew it was Malfoy leaving him the notes but the other part was denying it.
Harry took in the man before him. Malfoy still carried himself like the proper prince he was. But now with more confidence than arrogance. His face was spotless, free of acne and any scars, unlike Harry's. His hair framed his face perfectly and Harry smiled at the way he was constantly moving and or two away from his face.
His ass was the cherry on top of the very delicious, very attractive cake. Harry spread Malfoys pale cheeks apart, revealing his most intimate body part. The small pink puked stared at Harry and fluttered deliciously making Harry's mouth water. He quickly got on his knees deciding no way was he going to waste the chance to eat that sweet ass.
"Grown-ups are so complicated," Harry was about to answer when he saw Malfoy walking towards them with an angry scowl on his face.
The walk felt like a hike but eventually, they were near the water. Harry stopped for a second taking off his shoe and watched Malfoy do the same, he held them with one hand and the two continued walking along the beach.
Draco rolled his eyes playfully, "No I'm gonna take some nice shots of Lionel. Lay down you git."
"It's magic?"
He reached and grabbed Draco's jaw turning him around and slamming their lips together — not so much of a kiss but a clashing of teeth and tongue but Harry didn't care.
"What's so funny?" Jane asked.
"I take it he didn't agree with you divorcing his little sister?"
* * *
"S'good."
Potter looked at Draco while he answered the man's question, "Is it okay if we stay on the boat for a while? I brought some food I thought we could eat before heading back."
"Nothing," Potter looked like he was trying not to blush.
"She has a funny way of showing it," he chuckled. "But I care for her a lot. More than I ever thought possible and I just want what's best for her. She's had a tough life, you know?"
Harry brought in his bags and plopped down on the bed staring at the ceiling before deciding to unpack before he slept.
"But do you want one?"
"Me too," He sounded wrecked.
"I'm ready," she said, putting on red sunglasses that matched the red sundress that Draco got for her the month before when she found out she couldn't go visit her mother.
Harry then took a seat against the tree on the blanket with Draco sitting cross-legged in front of him.
"No, not at all." Harry quickly answered, "They're basically harmless. I'd just like to know who's leaving them."
"I'm having trouble believing you're the same Draco Malfoy who cried when Buckbeak bit him in third year."
Ellie started telling the two about how they were apparently undressing each other with their eyes, leaving Draco shocked that she would even know what something like that meant.
"Hi, Mr. Potter!"
"From school," Harry smiled.
"I told you I'm not looking for a relationship Mimi."
It was hard to remember to breathe and he nearly choked. The hand holding his head held him in place, the pulsing of the cock in his mouth under his tongue made him moan. Harry reached for Malfoy's balls and squeezed, earning a soft moan in return.
"That was bloody amazing!" Potter beamed.
Margot came from money, her father was the CEO of some big company in London, which was why they were having their wedding in Hawaii, spending an entire week at the resort before going to Paris for their honeymoon.
Bringing Ellie to Hawaii wasn't originally part of his plan since the wedding was in the making months before Draco got her. But she somehow found a way into his heart and both his best friends so now she was in the wedding as one of the flower girls.
Harry just blinked at him ready to say something else when he heard Mimi's voice from behind the counter.
"Potter," that same snobbish tone that tormented him for years. Harry's entire life flashed before his eyes and Malfoy seemed just as shocked as Harry but tried to mask it.
"Harry, lunch is ready," Hermione's voice broke him out of his deep thought and Harry made his way into the large kitchen, smiling when he spotted Hermione taking what looked like bread out of the oven he rarely used. With Ginny always traveling and Harry having all his meals at the Burrow or Hermione's place, he wasn't sure that the oven had ever been turned on.
It didn't bother Harry much because he knew Ron would obviously come around to the idea. Especially since this is obviously what's best for all of them. Ginny didn't disclose her sexuality to her family and neither did Harry. He was sure Hermione knew something but if she did, she didn't mention it, and Harry was glad.
He opened the paper as he walked and stopped when he read the words written on it.
"Seems like it, yeah. Do you want to go for a walk?"
Harry sat at his desk after the school day ended and decided to finish all his work at the school, not wanting to take anything home with him. He kept track of the time and by five in the afternoon, decided it was time to head home.
"Harry Potter?" His head snapped up. The masseuse, he was assuming, stood at the doorway with a small clipboard on her hand and a smile on her face.
Draco laughed, his eyes still bright even in the dim lighting. He stepped back and gave Harry the rose, which he gladly accepted. He pulled out a box from his back pocket before his knees touched the petals on the floor.
By the time he woke up, it was pitch black outside. He checked the alarm clock on the nightstand and it read 7:28 pm. He essentially missed an entire day of fun on the island but decided he still had time for dinner. Harry lowly cursed at the crick in his neck and made his way out of bed.
Jane took a sip of her red wine before answering, "Only in the states but not quite. We're doing a civil union, it's not the same as a marriage but it's all we have." She said sadly, taking Margot's hand in hers over the table.
"Yes. I would like that." Harry smiled, reaching out his hand across the table for Malfoy to shake. "Hello, I'm Harry James Potter."
Malfoy nodded. "Sure, we'll take the table. Thank you."
Harry noticed a lot of things.
"Like a secret admirer?" Hermione piped up and Harry nodded slowly. "That's rather romantic, don't you think?"
"Thank you so much," Harry said, following the bell boy towards the elevator.
The crick he usually had in his neck was gone. He felt lighter, better than he had in years. He made sure to leave her a personal tip.
"You'll never believe who Harry ran into in Hawaii," Harry listened in.
"Wow, you're like the grinch of Valentine's Day."
"Happy Valentine's Day, Mr Potter," Harry looked up from the stack of papers he was in the middle of grading and smiled at the little girl standing in front of him. She had a small pink bag in her hand, her face red as a tomato as she handed the bag to him.
"You have a little-" Harry motioned to the corner of his own mouth but Draco didn't get what he was trying to say. Harry reached forward and swiped the red away with his thumb. The finger hovered near Draco's lips and Draco stared at him, his grey eyes wide in shock.
It was expected that after all his friends played matchmaker for him for years, they would want to know who Harry finally agree to go on a date with. Hermione and Ron were the exact same way but Harry refused to say anything.
"What?" Harry was confused.
"So what brings you here? This is the last place I ever expected to see you," Malfoy said, resting his arms on the table while his hands rested under his chin.
Harry was lost. He watched Draco squint his eyes in an intense staring contest with the little girl next to him. "I'll make them put makeup on you. Lipstick and all."
Harry thought about it for a second. Granted, it was a bit chilly outside, but it was still a nice day so he agreed.
Harry cleared his throat and looked at Malfoy who was scanning the menu just as Ellie was. Malfoy looked up and Harry beckoned him to get closer. He placed the large menu in front of his and Malfoy's face.
The dark mark on his arm was still there in the same spot but looked more like a regular tattoo and Harry was ashamed to admit that he found it extremely attractive.
The little notes started showing up on the very first day of February. The first note read:
"I'm sorry I thought you would like it-" Harry set the small box down and leaned forward to cup Draco's cheeks. They felt warm under his palm. Their faces were so close but the fact that they could be so much closer made something flip inside Harry.
What started as cardmaking for Teddy's classmates and Harry's students turned into a glitter fight and Harry couldn't think of any better way to spend his Thursday night.
"Harry!" She smiled. "Hi love, come sit," She patted the spot on the couch next to him and Harry happily obliged, taking his goddaughter from her mother. "What brings you here?"
"Your cock is buried in my ass. I think you can call me Draco."
"What? They have more fun," She smirked.
Harry brought his hand to cover his mouth as he willed the tears not to fall from his eyes.
Reaching his own bedroom, he ran a hand through his wild hair and plopped down on the bed. At times like this, he realizes just how quiet his life was. Without Teddy around making a mess of everything and screaming everything he says, Harry found the house quiet -- borderline depressing.
"Follow me, Mr. Potter," He said at the same time the sweet lady chirped, "Enjoy your stay," before moving on to the next person in line, reciting the same speech Harry and no doubt hundreds of others had heard that day.
Potter nodded, showing the small camera to Draco who smiled before taking it.
"Surrender to the glitter monster!" The little boy giggled throwing more glitter after Harry.
Draco loved his friends. He loved how easily they just accepted him and now he had a family outside of just his mother.
"So, Harry, tell us all the dirt on this one here. How insufferable was he in school? He never wants to talk about his life before he moved next to us."
He parted his lip and felt Malfoy's tongue slide inside his own. He moaned at the feeling and let his tongue explore Malfoy's mouth. Harry didn't care for oxygen at the moment. All he wanted to do was kiss Malfoy now and for the rest of his life.
The three made their way inside the restaurant, Harry walking in front of Malfoy and behind the waiter who led them to a round table at the back of the restaurant near the bar.
"Gods no," Malfoy said at the same time the girl said "Fuck no."
"Malfoy? Why is he calling you by your last name?" A girl, no older than twelve or thirteen said with a smirk on her face. She was several inches shorter than Harry, with black and purple hair framing her round face, wearing a dress similar to what everyone at the resort had been wearing.
He got dressed in pale blue shorts and a simple white button-up and threw his hair back up in his signature bun that Margot said made him look like a douche but in a sexy way.
"When we were fourteen actually. We got paired up for a chemistry project and we've been friends since then. We got together about ten years ago though, our first year of uni." Margot said.
"Did too."
"Honestly if I were you, I'd just go to the shop a little early to catch the person."
"Draco sodding Malfoy."
He wore his hair down today. It framed his face just perfectly, leaving Harry in awe from the moment he saw it.
Lover by Taylor Swift
Harry stared at the man sitting in front of him. He still couldn't believe that for the first time in his twenty-five years on the planet, he had a date on Valentine's Day. His date wrote cute little notes for him and gave him a ring with a healing stone.
Hermione laughed, retracting her foot so Harry could massage the other one. Harry stared at her swollen belly, wondering if he would ever have a family of his own. Now that he wasn't married anymore and he knew for a fact he preferred men, the chances of him having kids were slim. Part of him would need some time to get used to that.
"It's the truth," She argued, putting her hands up.
The elevator ride was less than a minute long and left Harry dizzy and intensified the headache he'd been sporting since he woke up that morning. The doors opened and led to a vast beautiful hall and Harry sported his room number two doors down from the elevator doors.
"Your cousin Draco?"
Harry chuckled. "They're great, I love them."
"What do you want me to say? That I saw you come in here a few weeks ago and thought you were bloody gorgeous. That I wanted to kiss you but I couldn't approach you so I left you a note in hopes that you would be my valentine? Because that's just nauseating and untrue." Malfoy huffed, crossing his arms across his chest while looking at Harry.
Malfoy laughed. A belting sound that would no doubt turn heads if the music and noise level inside the restaurant wasn't louder. "No, I'm not. I don't think marriage is for me."
"Leave the duckies out of this."
Draco rolled his eyes, "Get your mind out of the gutter."
"You're welcome to join us," Harry smiled but the man waved him off saying he was fine waiting for them in the front of the boat.
"I agree with Ron," Hermione bit her lip.
"I never hated you during school. If anything I was envious."
Harry grabbed the base of his prick with his right hand, spreading Malfoy's cheeks with the other. He felt the blond jolt at the movement. Malfoy's face rested against the cold tile and Harry was glad they moved away from the water spray. He wondered if Malfoy's has done this before but decided that this was no time to ask such a question.
Harry stayed quiet as he reached up and washed Draco's hair. Draco closed his eyes, his hands resting on Harry's waist. "Now that you got what you wanted, will you finally stop staring at my ass on the pitch?"
Ron would no doubt tell Hermione and Hermione would tell Ginny who would, of course, tell Luna meaning the entire Wizarding World knew at that point. Harry smiled at the thought, resting his head on Draco's chest as the chorus of the song started playing.
Malfoy blushed at the question. Harry gave him a small smile "Just curious as to how your hatred for me turned into you being my secret admirer."
He went to bed that night thinking about how and why Malfoy was so bloody gorgeous and secretly hoping it was him leaving the notes on his coffee table every day.
"I'm a painter actually," Draco replied. His love for painting was definitely unexpected and not what he ever thought he'd find himself doing.
"Did not."
Harry raised his drink, "What can I say? I'm a record-breaking man," And the two burst out laughing. "I thought you lived in a muggle neighborhood. How did you hear about it?"
He opened the window to sleep that night, the music and activity from outside reaching his room. He didn't fall asleep until three in the morning, heavily engrossed in some American crime show playing on the TV.
"Well thanks for the coffee Mimi," Malfoy paid for his coffee and smiled at the barista behind the counter before turning to Harry. He stared at Harry for a while, making him slightly uncomfortable under his intense long gaze. "Potter," He nodded before walking off.
He looked around the restaurant for a while longer, almost taking a mental picture. He'd never experienced anything like this before. Even though he spent a good part of his life living among muggles, he still found it enthralling how different they lived from wizards.
He had to board a plane for the first time and he thought it would be like the first time driving a muggle car when he crashed on the very first attempt to turn.
"Hello, Olive," He picked up the small kitten and kissed her fur gently. "Hello, sweetheart. Where's Daddy?" The cat meowed in return.
"Whatever are you talking about Potter?"
Music played in the speakers in the front of the restaurant at a reasonable volume but was still a little bit too loud for Harry's liking, but when in Rome, right?
"Still can't believe I'm in Hawaii with Draco Malfoy eating fruit on top of a boat after we went scuba diving," Potter said.
Harry chuckled, his fingers still in Draco's foamy hair. "Now wheres the fun in that?"
A few hours and a few too many drinks later, the two had to head back.
Harry smiled and made his way towards the last table. He was surprised to find a small note on the table. He looked back and saw that Malfoy was still talking to Mimi at the counter when he got an idea. He grabbed the note and sat down.
Potter shrugged, "It's nice to be away from work, that's for sure."
"We are," Potter said. "I mean things could be better between Ron and me but it's fine."
"Does she?" Malfoy pursed his lips before giving Harry a barely noticeable smile. "I'll see you at seven?"
"Don't apologize, please. It's not like I didn't deserve it," he laughed but Potter didn't. They get undressed, the silence heavy between them but not uncomfortable, more... sad.
"I'll keep that in mind next time you ask to go to the cinema by yourself."
Happy Valentine's Day y'all :) <3
Harry grinned at the pink box being handed to him. "That's so sweet of you. Thank you."
"Good morning loves," He said, kissing both their cheeks before taking a seat across from Jane. "I apologize for being late. Blame Ellie."
Harry set the book down, making sure to mark his page. He knew Ellie would probably keep talking to him and he wasn't going to refuse the girl polite conversation.
But the chances of that were slim.
Harry chuckled, "She means well."
"I love the beach, but we could really do without all this sand, don't you think?"
He showered, washing his hair in the process and tried his hardest to tame the bird's nest on top of his hair. Draco told him to dress comfortably so Harry stelled for a pair of blue jeans, a red sweater with a black coat since it was February in England, meaning it was still very much winter.
"I can't believe it," She said in disbelief. "Ron!" She called out on the other line.
"How did you all meet?" Harry asked.
When his best friends told him that their wedding would be held in Hawaii, he was over the moon that they actually picked his suggestion.
He heard a knock on the door at precisely 5 PM. Harry all but ran towards his door to open it. Draco stood on the other side of the door, a smile on his face as he greets Harry. He had his hair up in a bun instead of down, framing his face. This hairstyle made his face more prominent and wow was his face symmetrical. Symmetrically beautiful.
He looked back at Potter who was licking strawberry juice from his lips, pushing himself up on his forearm. His hair was matted down on his face but it looked a little bit dryer. His golden skin shined under the sun. It was a scene straight out of a painting that Draco already started painting in his head.
She wasn't too happy about it. Going on about how he was losing touch with who he really was but he assured her he was the same Draco, he just didn't need magic to help him with everything now and trying to get her to see that as a good thing.
"Really?" Potter looked surprised. "Are you any good?"
The two sat in comfortable silence, staring at the clear water in front of them. Draco started to feel the afternoon chill on his shirtless body and involuntarily shivered.
Harry felt the sand underneath his feet and the water occasionally hitting it and it felt nice. Walking with Malfoy felt nice. Just in the man's company felt... nice.
Harry hummed and continued to lick. "You taste delicious," He blew on the skin before kissing it. "Can't wait to get inside you."
Hermione worked in the Ministry of Magic, slowly climbing up the ladder to become the new Minister of Magic -- a goal Harry had no doubt she would someday attain. Unlike Harry, Ron stuck to his Auror training and was now one of the best on the force.
Harry shook off all thoughts of the tiring day and quickly graded the grammar homework he assigned to his students. When he finished, he put on some muggle music from the record player Hermione gifted him for Christmas two years prior and made himself a small dinner.
The room was bright and smelled tropical. In the middle was a king-sized bed with what looked like a bright yellow duvet covering it along with ten too many pillows. There was a sitting area with a sofa and a chair in front of a table near the window, a big flat screen tv on the wall near a small dining area with a table and two chairs.
Draco smiled back, walking closer.
"Where are we?"
"And you were always stalking me."
Malfoy nodded and sat down on the sand, and Harry sat next to him, an inch of space between them.
Harry's hands reached down Malfoys body and Malfoy let out a strangled groan as firm hands wrapped his hand around his cock.
Draco felt a smack upside his head and winced. He looked up and saw Margot sitting back down, resting her hands under her chin.
of the quidditch uniforms than it did in. Harry wanted to reach out and simply squeeze them.
Draco adored all three of them. Especially Ellie -- angst and all.
"I'd rather have yours inside of me," Malfoy said. "I won't beg potter."
He passed the time inside his hotel room, taking a short nap while Ellie was with the bridal shower doing Merlin knows what. He and Potter agreed to meet downstairs in the lobby at 2 and the clock next to him read 1:50.
"I hope so."
"Well Drake here always comes in by himself, much like you Harry and I thought the two of you would hit it off."
Something Great by One Direction
Harry chuckled and spit in his hands spreading the saliva on his hard prick, moaning both at the feeling and the thought of finally being inside Malfoy. He eased his way inside and heard a small whine.
Harry thanked both her and the gods for alcohol and made his way outside, trying his best not to bump into anyone else.
Harry poured himself a cup of water and drank it while standing in the kitchen. After a while, he decided that he put off grading his assignments long enough and headed towards his office to start.
Ellie was eleven years old. She would've been going to Hogwarts in the fall if she wasn't a muggle and she reminded Harry so much of himself at that age. Their situations weren't completely different, but unlike Harry, she had a Malfoy. As strange as it sounded, it seemed to have been a good thing.
"A camera."
Ginny was back touring the world with her Quidditch team, and Harry was going on a two-week vacation alone at a luxurious resort.
"Wanted you for so long. Wanted you to ride me the way you ride that broom," Harry purred hotly in Draco's ear.
"You get used to it I guess?" Draco chuckled, "It was hard at first. Magic was all I knew but eventually, I found myself learning things. Small things like how to cook or clean properly. There's a certain satisfaction from doing things from myself after not really knowing anything for seventeen years."
Draco rubbed the side of his head, the place where she Margot him still stinging a little, "Nothing happened. We just made plans to go scuba diving today."
A waitress shortly came by and took their orders. Harry ordered some native dish called Loco Moco. And the others all ordered different things, Malfoy getting into the same argument he got into with Ellie about eating vegetables which she eventually caved in after negotiating chocolate cake for dessert.
Harry laughed, opening the small bag to find two chocolate frogs inside. He set the bag down on the chair next to his desk that was already filled with treats and gifts from all his students that day.
So, he kissed him again. And again.
He'd never really thought about his job from that perspective until today -- until talking to an 11-year-old, that is. And he was right, it was expected of him.
Harry was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was being set up with Draco sodding Malfoy.
There was no name on the paper. Nothing other than the short sentence -- just a muggle pen to muggle paper in small yet annoyingly neat handwriting.
Harry doesn't care much for relationships. He doesn't see himself actively seeking one out, but if one happened to fall into his lap, he would take it. Which is why he was curious to know who left the notes for him and why. Which is also why he has kept every note he ever got.
Harry's brows furrowed in both curiosity and confusion. He looked down to find the small cat staring up at him, her eyes just as wide as his. "What's your Daddy up to huh?" Olive meowed, making Harry laugh. "Well, lead the way, little miss."
Harry smiled. He found himself doing that a lot throughout the night. While having dinner with Draco Malfoy, nonetheless.
"It's so nice to finally meet you." She pulled back from the hug and squeezed his arm gently, smiling at him. “We’ve heard so many things about you!”
"Do you wanna sit for a while?" Harry asked.
Lively Cafe is a muggle coffee shop just outside Diagon Alley that Harry started going to every weekday after work since Hermione introduced him to the place a few months prior. He always wanted someplace where he could just be
Harry's cheeks flamed at the compliment. He smiled, pocketing the small note and finally taking a seat inside the booth. He looked around the coffee shop like he always does to see if he anyone's lurking.
Mimi tilted her head to think for a while before shaking it slowly, "No, I haven't noticed anything. But if you want I can keep a lookout and tell the other staff members to do so too. Are they threatening you? Should we get the cops involved?"
"Because I just woke up?"
"Yeah, we should" Potter grinned a red toothy grin, showing Draco the strawberry he trapped between his teeth and not closing his mouth until Draco threw a grape at him.
Harry spotted some muggle children playing on the swing set and a few people scattered around on the grass or benches, going about their business.
He felt giddy as they reached his bedroom, thinking that whatever the surprise was would be in there. His heart started beating faster when Olive stopped and looked up at him.
"Didn't take you for much of a beggar," Harry pulled back.
"I'm ready," Harry said, grabbing his keys, wallet, and the small gift bag containing Draco's gift from the small table in the foyer and closing the door behind him. The two walked to the nearest apparition point which was right around the corner from Harry's house and Harry found himself next to what looked like a muggle park.
Harry took off his coat and hung it up on the coat rack then proceeded to take off his shoes." Ron led the two inside the living room where Hermione sat down with Rose on her lap.
Draco felt something flutter inside his chest at the small sound. Potter finally looked away, going back into the small bowl of fruit and pulling out a piece of pineapple. He brought it up to his lips, releasing a sound that was definitely a moan, making Draco's eyes widen.
He still wore glasses. Draco was confused as to why he hadn't just used a spell to help with his eyesight by now. The scar on his face was only visible when he ran a hand through his hair or reached forward to touch it occasionally, unaware that he was doing it.
"Thanks so much for watching Teddy," Harry kissed Luna on the cheek, moving over to the same with Ginny. Teddy had his arms wrapped around Harry's own as the two stepped out of the fireplace. He let go of Harry's arm, making his way into Luna's waiting arms for a hug.
"Hey, Drake!" Mimi chirped while Harry was picking his scarf up from the counter to make his way towards his usual table. Harry cursed under his breath but turned around nonetheless. Standing in front of him was once again Draco Malfoy.
The divorce was amicable and when they broke the news to everyone, Molly cried, Arthur gave Harry a shoulder squeeze and said he would always be welcomed and Ron, well, Ron hasn't talked to Harry since he broke the news two weeks ago.
Harry felt like he was intruding, but the situation in front of him was so interesting he couldn't just leave. This definitely beat eating dinner by himself.
"Elizabeth."
"I think I prefer women."
"What?" She said, slowly rubbing her eyes.
Their lips touched. Soft, but firmly. And Harry closed his eyes and melted into it. His entire body ignited in sparks -- something he'd never experienced before.
"Of course," Luna beamed, ruffling the boy's green hair as they part, making him giggle. Teddy then walks over to Ginny and gave her a hug.
And if Harry stared at his arse while he left, well, no one had to know.
Harry's grin never left his face, "Yeah, completely nauseating and untrue."
When Teddy was old enough to start school, Harry was the one in charge of enrolling him so he went to the school and was offered a job to teach English to grades one and two. Harry took the job and on the first day of school found both him and Teddy ready to start a new chapter of their lives.
She nodded.
* * *
Harry chuckled "So cocky."
Harry loved his life. He loved his solidarity. He loved his house and the way he really turned it into a home. He loved his time with his godson. He loved his friends and the little family he made for himself. But everyone around him seemed to think he needed someone. Even Teddy who tried to set him up with the sweet Maths teacher at the primary school.
"You're right about that," Potter said.
"I'm not an orphan." She snapped.
"Welcome to Aloha Paradise Resorts, Mr. Potter. Here is our itinerary and your room key. You are on the 17th floor with the ocean view as requested. Your room is equipped with a state-of-the-art entertainment system and equipped with telephones in both the room and bathroom. Do call if in need of anything including room service," The small lady behind the counter smiled at Harry while reciting the same script Harry heard him recite to the family that was in line in front of him.
Teddy shook his head, "I mean someone you kiss. Like Uncle Ron kisses Aunt Mione."
The thought made Harry sad a little so he turned his attention back to the two just as he heard Malfoy say, "I'm ordering for you since you want to act like a child."
"I'm sorry. I have to go," he breathed before getting up from the ground. "I'm so sorry," he said one more time before walking away leaving a very confused Harry alone on the sand.
"Can't wait to tell Mione about this," Potter chuckled, shoving what looked like a piece of pineapple in his mouth.
"That's great Draco," Harry smiled. "She loves you."
The owner was this sweet middle-aged woman who Harry had met once. His favourite barista was a nineteen-year-old uni student named Mimi. She worked behind the counter and was always up for a short conversation. Harry was intimidated by her bright pink hair at first now he helps her come up with wild colours to dye it next while she tries to set him up with everyone who walks inside the coffee shop.
Harry smiled and started massaging her feet, "You could take the time off you know."
Ellie smiled for the second time that night, "Naturally."
She scoffed, "Please, I've been living with you for five months now and the only thing I've learned from you is sarcasm."
"I hope you like everything, I prepared it myself." Harry was shocked that all of the food in front of them wasn't prepared by a house-elf or two.
"I think someone's leaving me notes in the coffee shop I go to."
"Let's talk like civilized people, shall we?" Margot said and Jane tried to stifle a laugh.
"Like an orphan?"
Hermione brought up the idea a week earlier, mentioning she knew a nice resort where one of her cousins got married the year prior. She gave Harry the brochure and basically planned his entire vacation and packed his entire suitcase for him even though he begged her not to worry so much.
"Ouch," Draco breathed out, turning to Jane who was still laughing. "Control your woman will you?"
"What are you-" A strangled moan escaped Malfoy's mouth as soon as Harry's tongue made contact with the sensitive hole. "Holy bloody fuck-"
Potter turned to look at him, a confused look on his face. "Sorry what?"
"Do you love anyone?"
Harry closed the folder and smiled, "For me?" He asked, taking the bag from the seven-year-old. "Wow. Thank you so much, Allie."
"What if it was? Hypothetically of course."
He threw on a white plain shirt and a pair of yellow shorts with bright red ducks. A birthday gift from Jane about two years prior.
Draco hummed, "Teddy more than anyone. Although I did tell Ron I would be proposing tonight."
"Unless you're willing to help, I suggest you leave now Potter."
You are my love, my life and my best friend all wrapped in one. I never want to spend a day not loving you or being loved by you. Will you please do me the honour of becoming my husband?"
Harry was fully aware of what happened the last time Malfoy offered his hands to him. He pushes the memory in the back of his mind, still slightly disappointed at his younger self for being so rude to Malfoy. But they weren't eleven anymore. They were adults and Harry had a crush on him. A crush he was sure that Malfoy returned.
Harry sighed and leaned back a little to keep Rose from ripping his glasses off his face. The toddler pouted and Harry leaned forward to blow raspberries on her cheek, making her giggle.
"What is this?" Harry managed to choke out.
Harry was about to apologize for upsetting her when the waiter came back. "Mr. Potter you're in luck, we have one table remaining. Will you three be dining together?"
"It was actually Ginny's idea to get a divorce. If she hadn't said anything I wouldn't have and we probably would've been forty by the time we realized that it's not what any of us ever wanted."
Draco loved his life among the muggles. After his trial, he decided that in order for him to change, to become his own person, he had to leave the scrutiny of the Wizarding World behind.
Malfoy looked at him for a few seconds, that lovely smile of his never quite leaving his lips. "Sure. Let's go scuba diving."
Nervous for what? He wasn't sure. He wasn't sure if he was nervous to meet up with Potter or the fact that he willingly agreed to go explore the ocean.
Being a primary school teacher, Harry rarely had the time to read anything that wasn't assigned reading material for six and seven-year-olds. His hour in the small coffee shop every day was his hour of solitude.
"And the rehearsal dinner tomorrow night," Jane added.
"We? I was never angsty."
Harry picked up his cup of coffee, the smile never really leaving his face as he got to know Draco Malfoy a second time.
He was certain no one would recognize him but he might've been wrong.
Harry shook his head with a smile, pulling out one of the high stools next to the counter and taking a seat. "I actually had a question about something." Mimi nodded and urged him to continue. "I've been getting these weird notes on my regular table every time I come in for the past week and I was wondering if you saw anyone weird lurking around the back or sitting at the booth I usually sit at?"
Malfoy took the hand offered to him, giving it a firm shake, "Draco Lucius Malfoy." He gave Harry a small smile. Harry took back his hand, ignoring the small sparks of lightning that shot through him.
Fourteen years later, Harry was still glad he met them the two of them on the train to Hogwarts.
"Listen Harry I-" Malfoy paused, looking at Harry, the intense eye contact making Harry squirm. "I want to apologize again. For what happened when we were kids."
Harry laughed at the statement, "I promise I didn't just sprout a love life out of nowhere."
"Oh god. Please, Harry!"
* * *
While Harry couldn't see her, he heard her footsteps walking inside the room. "Alright, Mr. Potter. Is there anything, in particular, you would like to listen to?"
Harry grinned, pocketing the small note, "I'd say that your handwriting is really nice."
"F-fuck," gasped Malfoy as he struggled to hold himself up. Harry's reaches around him and grabbed his stomach holding him up.
"We have a meeting with our wedding planner bright and early tomorrow," Margot said, getting up from the table. "But Harry, love, you have to come to the wedding."
"It's so beautiful here at night," Malfoy said.
He whistled to himself while he unpacked, giving himself a proper tour of the room and bathroom. He put his clothes away, happy that Hermione helped him pack, or otherwise all he would have was swim shorts.
Harry laughed, ignoring the part about him crushing on Malfoy. He took off his scarf and leaned on the counter waiting for Mimi to finish his order. "You flatter me."
"I can now die a happy man."
"I'll definitely keep on the lookout now. It's about time you started coming in here with someone. I was starting to think those luscious curls and green eyes would just go to waste."
Harry pulled back to look at him, "You told Ron?" Draco nodded as Harry laughed.
His usual order was a small Americano with two shots of espresso. Mimi would bring him his coffee at his table while he took out the most recent novel he's reading that week and tried to finish it.
The resort itself was one of the most beautiful things Harry had ever seen, and he had spent seven years at Hogwarts.
"I think you should do what makes you happy. Life is too short," Ellie said nonchalantly.
"We're here?" He asked. The cat titled her head and Harry looked at the door, noticing another piece of paper attached to it.
He smiled all night and each time they were directed towards Draco, his knees went weak under the table.
They slowly approached the dive platform on the boat and looked at each other. Potter gave him a small nod and a smile before looking back into the water.
Harry let out a laugh. The interaction between the two was unbelievable. He had never seen Malfoy like this. Granted, he had never seen Malfoy outside of Hogwarts or him not being an asshole. But now he was a foster parent. And while Ellie seemed to be giving him a run for his money, it seemed as if she also found her match.
"People go on vacations alone all the time Ellie," Harry chuckled. "Don't worry, I'm still having a rand ole time here."
"You ready to go scuba diving?"
His outfit was much like Harry's. Instead of blue jeans, he wore black faded ones, with a white sweater and a coat on top of it.
Why wasn't there a note waiting for him?
"It's a pleasure to meet you guys," Harry finally took a seat, scooting the chair a little and cringed when he heard the legs squeak. "Hey Ellie," he smiled at the little girl sitting next to Malfoy before whispering "hi" to Malfoy himself.
Harry looked up at the green-haired boy, "What do you mean Ted?"
After the war, he thought he'd give Auror training a go but didn't last a month. Consequently, he found himself lost, not really know what he wanted to do with his life. So, he devoted himself to being a good godfather to Teddy.
This was his routine, dull, mundane life. He loved it relatively alone and he was pleased with it. but at night, he almost wished he had someone to come to bed to, a body to keep him warm.
He took a seat on a small white couch, rubbing his hands on the black shorts he decided to wear that day. He was the only person in the room, apart from the receptionist.
"You boys wanna head back now?"
"Nah," She leaned back in her chair, shoving a piece of fruit in her mouth. "Let her do her thing."
Potter threw his head back in laughter and Merlin, was he beautiful.
But it wasn't anything like that. He squeezed Jane's hand all through the flight, never closing his eyes in fear he would wake up in the middle of the ocean surrounded by killer sharks.
He was not a vain person but he also won't deny his looks as a way to fish for compliments. He carried himself with as much confidence as he could and his fashion sense has improved since Hogwarts. He was still finding it hard to believe he would have sort of secret admirer.
"Told you he was a cute one," Mimi's voice brought Harry back to reality. "So, what do you think? You already know him so it makes my job easier."
He glanced up at the boy in front of him, Draco looked thoroughly fucked and Harry's spent cock twitched at the sight. He reached up and captured Draco's lips in a kiss and moaned when their tongues made contact.
Teddy was right -- while he didn't need someone to kiss on Valentine's Day, he definitely wanted someone to kiss on Valentine's Day. And that someone was Draco Malfoy.
Draco set the camera down and looked at Potter, "The Golden Trio is still together?"
"And they believe you?"
"How are you enjoying your vacation so far?"
"I know, but I'll need all my vacation days once this little monster arrives," She said, pointing to her swollen belly.
Harry watched him walk towards the back of the coffee shop, taking a seat in the booth in front of Harry's usual one. Harry narrowed his eyes before gasping. Could it be? He shook his head. It couldn't be. He wouldn't let himself believe it could be.
Malfoy got up and pulled out the chair between him and a beautiful brown-skinned woman. Sitting next to her was a woman with bright red hair who Harry assumed was her fiance. And Ellie sat between her and Malfoy
"What?" Draco asked.
"I love it," Harry whispered. He stared into Draco's eyes, his thumb gently caressing the rosy skin underneath it. His eyes flickered from his eyes to his lips as a sort of warning. Draco didn't stop him, so he leaned forward and captured the pink thin lips into his own.
"Exhilarating," Draco added.
"We're engaged," Harry stared at the ring in disbelief. He looked up and found Draco grinning at him, his perfect white teeth showing.
Eventually, he saved up enough money to move into a bigger place, a nice two-bedroom home in Chelsea in a relatively quiet neighborhood. In that same neighborhood, he met Jane and Margot who were only dating at the time.

Illusion by One Direction
"You're not my dad," Ellie got up from the table not bothering to push her chair back in.
"I would appreciate that, thank you," Harry smiled as the man closed the book in front of him, disappearing inside the restaurant. He didn't ask Harry to follow him so he stood outside awkwardly, his glass now half empty as he leaned on the wall, closing his eyes and inhaling the fresh ocean air.
"I quite like being alone Mimi," Harry shot her a glare.
Harry chuckled. "It always seems to end with the two of us."
"She's very angsty for an eleven-year-old," Harry said after a few seconds of silence.
"Satisfied?" Harry whispered against the pink lips.
Hermione chuckled, "Told you he'd come around. I swear that man is lost without you, Harry."
There was definitely magic between the two of them. Harry heard Draco sigh a happy sigh as he cupped the back of Harry's head with his own hand, deepening the kiss.
"Mimi, what have I said about playing matchmaker?" Malfoy scrunched up his pointy nose, narrowing his eyes at the pink-haired girl behind the counter who just blinked innocently at the two.

Narcissa looked at her son then, her eyes taking in the handsome young wizard sitting next to her. She wasn’t blind to Draco’s faults, not at all, but she believed that she could see his strengths better than anybody else. Behind the arrogance and sarcasm was a strong wizard, who was not always brave but would do everything to protect his family. And now she and Severus were the sole focus of all that protectiveness. She knew that her son would set the world on fire to protect her and in return she would destroy cities and countries to keep him safe. It probably made her a horrible person that she was willing to sacrifice everything and everyone for her son, but she didn’t care.

CannonBALLS – Ron W.
Head of House Gryffindor
: he should have been in the year below Harry but his father pulled some strings
Molly sighed and wished her husband would be at her side right now. As it was, Arthur was still at the Order’s Headquarters, discussing their plans regarding the Ministry. She hated to be forced to do this to her own children. How she wished Dumbledore would tell the lies himself instead of asking her to lie for him. But it was probably for the best. She knew that at least Ron and Hermione had made plans to search for Harry on their own, and Ginny had probably planned to join them. They would have been in so much danger yet
: thanks babe

I hope you laughed at least ... twice.

The snake stopped in front of him, her head swaying slightly with what Harry recognized was her way to shake her head.

10:45am: Meeting with the Hogwarts Board of Governors regarding the increase of the Hogwarts budget
: im pretty sure The Thing is going well
The white-haired wizard kept silent for a few moments while they were still walking quickly through the forest. “It wasn’t only the pure strength of the magic which surprised me, Severus. It was the emotion behind it.” He glanced at his friend. “It was very angry magic. With so much anger bottled up inside a person… I am afraid that we might have another powerful Dark wizard at our hands.”
: that's just his name?
are u gonna elaborate on that???
: don’t worry it’s cute
: finally
: forget being bisexual I’m bye-sexual now I’d love if u all fuck off
The green flames in the big fire place suddenly roared up, until they were easily at a man’s height. They only died down as the wizard which had appeared amidst them took a step forward, leaving the harmless fire. Severus Snape was scowling at nothing in particular as he shook the dust from his black robes. His hands were still clad in dragon-leather gloves and it was obvious that he had indeed been in the middle of brewing something.
: no comment
: we are direct descendants of Helga Hufflepuff, I can’t dirty our name like this

11:30am: Call with French Minister LaBlanche regarding the trade negotiations on rare potions ingredients
The silence in the large room was a strained and tired one. Several people were sitting around the large table, some staring at the wooden surface, some nervously looking at the others. Some men and women had chosen to stand instead of transfiguring something into a chair. It seemed as if they were all waiting for something, or someone. At the head of the table, the oldest of the present wizards and witches was sitting in a simple, wooden chair. Albus Dumbledore, one of the most powerful wizards in the world, looked older than ever. His eyes lacked the amused sparkle which had given them all a little bit of hope in other dark times. But today, Dumbledore seemed to be weary, as if he had lost a battle he hadn’t even known he was fighting.
: OKAY first off all why do you just assume //// I //// did something??? Something could have happened // to // me???
: here I go
A notice of approval. But for the sake of merlin, Do. Not. Actually. Approve. This.

: I just need someone to distract pince while I sneak a few books out of the restricted section
: having TWO boyfriends instead of only ONE
: … obviously. … So… how long did you have to prepare yourself for Hogwarts?
There are some new names here. They are pretty easy to recognize out so if u want to figure it out on your own just read the chapter. There’s a complete user name guide in the notes at the end of the chapter if you prefer knowing them beforehand.

Thank you for the clearance of the protocol notes.
Dumbledore seemed to collect himself and stood up. Immediately the attention of the whole room was focused on him. He took a second to make sure that his voice would be strong instead of shaking with the uncertainty he was actually feeling.
: why do u have to be like that
: u all suck
: never as bad as fake quirrel but enough to make talking to people embarrassing
: yes
“It’s possible because he will accuse me of taking you from him. The Bond will recognize his anger at loosing his heir and will want to give him the chance of confronting me about it.”
"What about you Harry? No girlfriend?"
Harry's feet moved before he could stop them he stood in front of Malfoy in mere seconds. Malfoy let go of the grip he had on his prick before grabbing Harry's jaw. He stared at Harry and Harry's cheeks reddened under the intense gaze. Malfoy slammed his lips against Harry's and Harry moaned.
Draco was nervous.
"I'm already regretting this."
"But, it's so fun!" The barista pouted, "You're both hot, queer, single men. Come on Harry, do you really want to spend Valentine's Day alone?"
"Draco," Ellie replied, not moving an inch from the chair.
He hadn't seen much, from the moment he landed at the port key station, he took a muggle cab to the hotel, and inside, Harry studied the map as the soft tune of some soothing muggle music played in the background. His cab dropped him off in front of the hotel, where he went straight inside to check in but the sunny sky and blue waters at every corner had him absolutely mesmerized.
Draco stayed quiet.
His mother was a wreck when he left, but she understood why it was something he had to do. So he left home and found a nice small flat in muggle London that his mother helped him pay for until he found a job working as a barista in some overpriced coffee shop.
"Just go enjoy some coffee. I'll give you another cup on the house, Drake. Go sit, talk, discuss your plans for the weekend," Mimi smiled grinned, trying her best to appear innocent.
"How do you know Draco?" She asked Harry.
"Is Ellie the first child you've fostered?" He asked Malfoy, turning to look at him.
Harry ignored Malfoy's answer and smiling at Mimi, "Yeah we went to school together."
Harry pulled back and rested his forehead against Draco's. "I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."
After about thirty minutes later, he gathered his things and walked to the counter to tell Mimi he was leaving early when he bumped into a firm chest. Harry cursed under his breath and picked up his book that fell on the floor before looking up to apologize to the person.
"They are," the other woman said, getting up from the table so she could hug Harry too. "I'm Margot and this is my lovely fiancée Jane,"
"No. You will have a hearty meal complete with vegetables. You're grounded so no dessert," Malfoy said, taking a sip of the water a different waiter had just put in front of them.
Potter stayed quiet, slowly bringing his hand up before dropping it on his side. "I'm sorry."
He didn't even know he and his mother were back from Italy. Andromeda might've mentioned it since she told Harry the two sisters started writing to each other, trying to repair their relationship. If she did mention it, Harry wasn't listening or he simply forgot.
Harry wasn't an expert at this as this was his very first blowjob but his enthusiasm mixed with the fact that the thought about giving Malfoy a blowjob was extremely arousing, he was ready to give it his best. And judging from the sound that came out of Malfoys' mouth and the grip on his hair, he knew he was doing something right.
He swam and moved around the water, mesmerized by everything he encountered. He looked for Potter and found him a few feet away with the same look of wonder on his face that Draco had when he saw Hogwarts for the first time.
Potter looked at him, a deadpan look on his face.
Draco sat down on the small seating deck, grateful to be out of the wetsuit and back in his duckie shorts. He watched Harry take two small bowls out of the bag he was carrying earlier.
"Really?"
Draco angled the camera and took the picture. A small square instantly popped out of the camera. He smiled and looked at the moving picture of Potter with a dopey smile on his face while his eyes remained closed.
"Okay but there's this guy that's been coming in here for the past few weeks and you guys would be so perfect for each other please," The pink-haired barista cupped her hands together in front of her in a pleading manner making Harry shake his head.
"Hey yourself," Draco replied, shoving his hands in his pockets.
They made their way downstairs to the small room where they served breakfast and Draco immediately spotted Margot's bright red hair amid chatty families and children.
Malfoy looked amused. He leaned back in his chair and looked at Harry, "Harry here was too cool to be my friend. So naturally, I made his life a living hell."
"The beach is nice until it starts smelling like the beach," Harry said after a small moment of silence.
He and Draco laughed until their faces hurt, swaying and twirling each other around their bedroom, dreaming about the rest of their lives together as husbands and best friends. A promise and bond that could never and will never be broken.
He watched the two women talk about their wedding and how happy they were having this civil union, as they called it in the states. He listened with a  smile on his face, occasionally checking up on Ellie and seeing the same smile on her face.
Harry suddenly felt nervous at what might be behind the door. He slowly opened the door, seeing scattered rose petals all over the floor. He gasped as the door opened all the way. The room was dimly lit with candles all around, the curtains were drawn to block the sunlight. The floor was covered in roses of every colour. On the bed, the petals were arranged in the form of a heart.
"No," Ellie said at the same time Jane said, "You could say that."
Shortly after the encounter, the gossip of the Wizarding World was that he and his mother moved to Italy. This was the first time Harry was seeing him in seven years and if Harry thought 16-year-old Malfoy was gorgeous, 25-year-old Malfoy was a God.
"My friends Margot and Jane are getting married on Saturday."
Ellie soon followed, claiming she wanted to go eat her cake in her room.
"Oh shut it," Harry chuckled.
That would be a good idea except Harry goes every day after work. Mimi herself said she would keep a lookout but the girl did have a job to do. Harry doubted she would be able to see what everyone inside the shop was doing at a certain time.
As he made his way back to his cottage, Malfoy never left his mind. To say harry hated the git in school would be an understatement. But to also say Harry didn't have a crush on him would also be a big massive lie.
"How exciting! Were you guys friends?" The question earned a snort from Malfoy who turned to grab his coffee on the counter. Harry slowly shook his head, his eyes shifting from Malfoy and Mimi behind the counter.
