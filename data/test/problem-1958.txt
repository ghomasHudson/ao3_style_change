Draco was rocking against him now, helpless, his cock pressing up against the fat curve of Harry’s gut, Harry’s hands on his slim hips.
Harry glanced down. There was about a quarter of his pie left. Ron and Hermione’s pie, on the other hand, was barely half eaten. God, he really ought to slow down. A pie like this could feed a whole dinner party of people, not one person who’d already eaten two dinner party’s worth of food that day. He rocked uncomfortably in his chair, belly aching so fiercely he couldn’t help but soothe a hand up and down it, knowing Ron and Hermione could probably tell how full he was.
“You,” Harry said, hoisting himself to his feet and leaning awkwardly over his belly to kiss Draco, “are incredible.”
“Then you’ll never come visit!” Molly said, but immediately started shouting the recipe across the table, and soon enough everyone was yelling at one another about something other than Harry’s weight, which suited him fine.
They grinned at each other for a moment, a strange shyness in the air, and then Draco piled the fork high again. “Well, that’s settled. Let’s give you a horrible stomachache, shall we?”
Harry put a hand on his cheek. “I know you would. Here, give me another bite. Mmm. Oof. Fuck. No, I don’t want to stop.” He gave a self-deprecating smile. “You know me. I rather like being out of control. So long as it’s you who’s in control.”
Potter swallowed visibly and set down the menu, sliding it deliberately to Draco’s side of the table. “Deal.”
The little witch flushed and darted a glance down the hall, though she looked excited despite herself. “It’s – and he’s actually so nice, he signed a card for my mum’s birthday last week, I felt so silly asking but it absolutely made her week, she –”
Harry gave him a look so soft and sympathetic that Draco looked away. But aloud he only said, “Fine.”
“That armoire, the one that grew teeth and tried to eat anyone who came near it? I got the curse off yesterday and sold it today. Seven hundred thousand galleons. Not quite the million you promised me, but…”
Harry plucked at the green wool. “Hermione gave it to me. Says it brings out my eyes or some nonsense.”
He sat in the break room for a whole hour, quietly eating cake, drinking (tragically excellent) coffee, and listening to his coworkers banter – and in all that time, he didn’t see a single auror.
“’Arry,” Fleur said, swooping in so suddenly that he jumped. She kissed both his cheeks and then turned to Draco. “Oo is zis ‘andsome man!”
“Merlin, I thought Hermione was the pregnant one! Ron told me you’d packed it on but I didn’t believe him! Look at you!”
Harry hesitated before telling the truth. “I don’t… I don’t like having people in the house. Not unless I completely trust them, so it’s mostly just Hermione and the Weasleys these days. Call it paranoia, but…”
“Draco,” she said. “I’m so glad you’ve come.” She stood on tiptoe to put her arms around him, well-practiced with reaching Ron, and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
Relief flooded Draco’s body. “That’s fair. That’s absolutely fair. Really, you’ll have dinner with her? I could invite Pansy too, she’s in town next week and my mum’s mad about her.”
“What?” Harry said, looking adorably startled, and he tried to peer around the mound of tummy that blocked his view of her head.
Malfoy fixed him with an exasperated look. “Potter, you work for the Ministry. You’re head of the aurors. Did it never occur to you that someone else could go through everything for you?”
Draco was looking at him with raised brows. “You certainly ate it fast enough. All the Weasleys are bringing you food and telling you how big you’ve gotten, I’m practically vestigial.”
“Well, she’s coming to see them next week, and I told her she could stay here for a night. She always loved this house, Merlin knows why. And also I promised them I’d invite you for dinner. So.”
Because that was the truth. Watching Potter eat was undeniably erotic, and the more he ate, the more erotic it was. When he picked up the last brownie of his own accord and, panting, started to chew, Draco had to bite his lip to keep from making a sound.
“Little Lord Malfoy,” the elf croaked, and swept a bow so deep Draco worried he’d never get out of it. “Kreacher is at your service.”
Harry broke out into a dazed grin, embarrassed to find his eyes filling with tears. He shook his head, speechless, and a moment later Hermione was in his arms and he was sniffling into her hair. “A baby,” he said stupidly. It seemed unbelievable, after all they’d been through, that anything so good should be allowed to happen. “A baby.”
Potter paused and swallowed his mouthful, then pushed his glasses up his nose and gave Draco an odd, considering look. “We both of us had a time, didn’t we?”
Draco smirked. “Well,” he said. “You might help him along a bit by kissing his neck. What do you think, Harry?”
Which apparently, he did. Because here he was six hours later, four servings deep in macaroni with both Ron and Hermione looking at him curiously as he helped himself to another thickly-buttered slice of bread, his fifth. Harry paused briefly to ask himself whether he was still hungry, found the answer was a resounding no, and shrugged, pushing the bread into his mouth anyway. He’d gotten into the habit of eating what was in front of him.
“Malfoy,” Potter groaned, but he took the brownie and doggedly began eating it, as if he couldn’t help himself. Draco found that his own breath was coming a bit short, and he sat up straighter, trying to regulate it, trying not to let on that he was…
“I couldn’t,” Potter repeated, but more doubtfully this time. Draco rolled his eyes. He ought to leave it be, ought to turn and go, but Potter really did look too thin, his jawline sharp, his t-shirt hanging from those broad shoulders as on a clothes hanger. And why should Draco care? It was good office politics, he told himself. If he wanted to get ahead – if he ever wanted to make a damn friend – it was in his best interest to keep Potter from badmouthing him left and right. How could he badmouth if his mouth was full?
Ron, who was seated next to him, snuck a hand over and placed it on Harry’s gut. “You’re softer than ‘Mione,” he said, “but not by much. Same water balloon feel.”
“You’re not old enough, Freddy,” George said, and she began screaming again. George beamed at her in delight and came to shake Harry and Draco’s hands. “Good to see you both. Malfoy, I hear you’re less of an absolute shit these days?”
He did manage, and after the pie was gone, he managed a stack of gingersnaps and five glasses of firewhisky, by which time both he and Ron were quite drunk, Ron lolling on his back in front of the fire, Harry in an armchair with his taut belly piled in front of him, looking so round that even he was surprised.
“Sit,” Draco ordered, and felt an odd flicker of pleasure at seeing how quickly Potter obeyed him. A moment later the coffee machine spat out an incredibly rich, sugary concoction of chocolate and caramel, topped with a quivering mound of whipped cream.
Harry put a careful, bracing hand on his belly as he stood, and he saw Malfoy track the movement. “Overdid it with those,” he said, nodding towards the pumpkin bars. “Had a big breakfast this morning.”
Draco dropped a hand to the side of Potter’s poor stomach, knuckling it gently. “Think we burned some calories. Time for dessert?”
Harry shrugged, looking sheepish. “I don’t know. I just… I got hungry. Or, no, I haven’t been hungry in months, I just… wanted it.”
“Is he coming to family dinner tomorrow night?” Ginny called over her shoulder. She and Emmaline were tromping up the stairs with an energy Harry had lost two stone ago. He hoped they couldn’t see how winded he was getting.
“Night, Pans,” Draco said, and caught her by the wrist as she passed, pulling her down to kiss her chastely on the forehead.
“Just here,” Draco said, and sucked the patch of skin beneath Harry’s chin. Then, abruptly, he stood. “Well, work to do.”
“Are you planning me a second dinner?” Harry said, wide-eyed. “Why? You don’t want your mum to see the way I eat?”
“Your relationship with your best friend is very different from mine,” Harry commented, scraping his spoon around the nearly-empty pint.
“You’ve put on thirty pounds,” Draco said, and Harry laughed. Draco liked the US metric system because it sounded like more. “Of course people are noticing.”
“Say the word, and we’ll stop,” Draco said. “I’ll start making broccoli instead of cake, we can watch your portions, we can go on walks…”
Both things managed to somehow be true at once. The hair was the same, wavy black chaos, and the eyes were the same, big and green behind the same terrible glasses. The basic face was the same. But Potter… there was no other way to describe it… Potter had grown up. He looked like a man, not a boy. His shoulders were broader, and though he was still thin – too thin – there was something sturdy about him, too, as if his stubbornness had etched itself into every line of his body. His jawline, sharp and strong, was covered with dark stubble. He’d gotten… oh, gods damn it. He’d gotten hot.
“Let’s get you out of this jumper, hmm,” Draco murmured, and Harry leaned forward over his belly enough that Draco could pull the jumper off. Bare, his belly looked enormous and pale, a swollen moon, and Harry pressed a palm soothingly against it.
“Little Lord Malfoy has fed my master very well,” Kreacher said, and Harry blushed. “Kreacher is not so talented as you are, no, not nearly, but Kreacher will do whatever he can to keep master fed.”
Because they were in public, Draco did not lay a proprietary hand across his belly, as Harry knew he would’ve liked to do. Instead, he put a hand on Harry’s thigh and gave it a squeeze. “We ought to talk about this more in-depth later. Alone.”
When the server came, Draco took great pleasure in placing their order, watching Potter’s eyes grow wide and his lips part as if he might protest, only to stay quiet, to stay obedient.
“Big strong auror,” Pansy panted. “I used to be a dark witch, you know. Are you going to punish me?”
“Can’t believe how much weight I’ve stacked on,” Harry said. He hauled himself a bit further up the cushions so he could look down at himself, and Draco watched him trace the jut of swollen underbelly that crushed his waistband and threatened to settle in his lap. He’d eaten a little over half a pan of the lasagna and Draco could feel how full he was, could hear the strain of it in his voice, but he opened his mouth again when Draco raised the loaded fork.
“Well, you must be hungry,” Molly said, then flushed. “I don’t mean because you’ve – I only meant –”
“I can’t remember the wand pattern to make it start,” Potter said. “And I’m too embarrassed to ask my secretary, I’ll never hear the end of it. I forgot my lunch again and now, no coffee…” He looked positively morose.
They made their way up the stairs slowly, Harry deliberately taking his time, noticing how much of an effort it was, how heavily his belly weighed on him, how he gripped the railing and lost his breath halfway through. Noticing, and savoring. He’d gotten so bloody big and when he wasn’t in his head about it, he could admit it felt amazing. Felt amazing to sit on the edge of the bed and let Draco unlace his shoes; amazing to shuck his jeans at the end of a long day and let Draco kiss the red marks left by his waistband; amazing to flop down onto the bed and curl around a full belly; amazing to wake up every morning with Draco’s hand gentle on his bloated tummy, morning wood pressed up into the crook of Harry’s chunky ass.
He leaned back against the couch cushions to eat, too rattled to participate much in the conversation, which was mostly about home decorating anyway. Yet again he felt blindsided by how big he’d gotten, and realized he had no idea how he looked to others. He looked at Hermione and thought, My god that’s a big belly – but all evidence suggested that his was, in fact, bigger.
Potter shook his head, eyes half-closed against the discomfort he must be feeling. Then he said, “Butter chicken. Can you make that?”
“Had a dinner party last night,” Draco half-lied. His mother had been over, anyway. “Too many leftovers.”
True to form, Narcissa spent much of the meal criticizing: the lighting, the glassware, Draco’s tattoos, the herbs he’d used to roast the chicken, his lack of house elf. Normally this would drive Draco up a wall, but Harry’s calm presence steadied him, and most of rolled off his back. The bottle of wine he’d had before she arrived didn’t hurt, either.
“You were absolutely obsessed with him,” Ginny corrected, swooping back in to pet Harry’s belly at its broadest point. “I suppose he likes this, does he? Pervy git.”
“Here,” Ron said generously, adding another scoop of sugared berries and another mound of whipped cream to Harry’s plate. “Have a bit more.”
He glanced up to find Malfoy staring at him. “She’s right,” he said shortly. Then, before Harry could process this, “Finished. It’s all yours.”
Pansy began kissing her way back up his belly, pausing to suck on the soft flesh below his navel. “One last plate,” she said. “Then I’ll take my top off.”
“Oh shush,” Molly said. “Harry, I for one am thrilled to see you so comfortable. You were always such a thin child, it used to worry me awfully. This is much better, if you ask me.”
“I myself cannot ‘ave it,” she said sadly. “Too many calories! This weight, it suits you, but not me.”
Harry sighed, reaching for the platter of bacon. He could feel this meal settling in his belly on top of the cake he hadn’t quite managed to fully digest; could feel each bite of sausage and syrupy French toast stretching his stretched-out stomach. Yet he didn’t stop. He let Kreacher refill his plate again, and then once more, until the table was just a mess of empty dishes and Harry’s hands were sticky with syrup. He was lightly out of breath, leaned back in his chair to give his stomach more room, sticky fingers pushed up beneath his jumper to soothe the gurgle of his pained gut. He pet himself as he’d pet an unpredictable animal, with soft, reassuring strokes, feeling how tight he’d gotten yet again.
He hurried back to find Pansy sitting on Harry’s knee, one hand resting on his belly. Harry looked terrified – terrified, and turned-on. Draco knew that look.
Draco’s first few weeks at the Ministry were without incident. It was very odd, to be working in such an official capacity after so many years of freelance work, of taking whatever jobs he could find. After his father had died in prison, he and his mother had begun painstakingly cataloguing and selling off the contents of Malfoy Manor, a years-long process that had not only amassed them a certain amount of liquid wealth, but also accidentally made Draco into something of an expert on removing ancient curses. It had turned out that the majority of the Malfoy’s heirlooms were not only very old and very expensive, but also very hexed to react poorly to any non-Malfoy – not ideal, obviously, for selling off. After five years spent breaking centuries-old curses on vases, wardrobes, spoons and more under his mother’s highly critical eye, Draco had decided it was time to leave the nest, and bought a flat in London. He was surprised to find that he’d gotten something of a reputation for the man to see in ancient cursework, and the jobs had come thick and fast. Still, it had been a bit of a shock when the Ministry had reached out.
“Nonsense!” Molly said, so affronted that Draco managed to smile even through the slightly strangled look he was giving Harry. “Here, I’ll make you a plate.”
“Yes, but don’t worry, she’s quite gay. Engaged to a woman on her Quidditch team, Emmaline, she’ll be here too.”
Draco made him another piece and stroked his belly gently as he ate it. He could feel the swell of Harry’s hip pressed into his own side and he leaned down to mouth at one of Harry’s pudgy pecs through the cotton of his shirt. Harry let out a little whimper and let Draco fill his mouth with more bread and cheese.
“Me too,” Harry breathed, because it was true, his cock was twitching to attention in his tight jeans.
Harry waved him off and managed to sit upright. He tugged his shirt down and stroked a hand over the tight curve of his belly, thinking of all he’d put into it that day. He’d eaten enough for three people, easily, and here he was, anticipating breakfast. Quite a change from the weeks before Malfoy had come back into his life, when dinner was often the only meal he managed to eat with any regularity, to his house elf’s supreme distress. Kreacher was a lot happier now that Harry had started eating breakfast again – it was, for reasons unknown, the elf’s own favorite meal of the day, and also the only meal for which they both fully agreed on timing. Kreacher was old and devoted to the five o’clock supper so he could be in bed by eight, while Harry preferred to dine later. Often Kreacher charmed his dinner to stay warm and Harry would eat it alone by the fire instead of at the table with his elf, and that, too, had contributed to how thin he’d let himself get: he never managed to eat much when he was eating alone.
By this time, most of the table had drunk a fair amount, save for poor Hermione. Harry’s belly was bloated not only with a fantastic amount of food but also with several strong beers, which had the converse effects of dulling the pain at the same time they added to it. He’d undone his jeans button around his second plate of pasta, and when the sticky toffee pudding landed in front of him he gave up and began undoing his flannel shirt, too. He had a perfectly nice white t-shirt underneath, after all, though it was a bit snug and showed off the deep hollow of his belly button. He sighed with relief as the flannel fell away, then blinked down at the solid heap of belly he’d uncovered.
Ron magicked away the dishes and Harry stood with a groan, making his way to the green velvet couch and throwing himself down onto it. Lying down, half-supported on the cushions, he could see the gentle swell of his packed stomach rising from between the unbuttoned flaps of his jeans, and he tugged his shirt up a bit, too, just enough that he could lay a warm palm across it soothingly. With his other hand, he knocked his glass of firewhisky against Ron’s and took a warming sip. Immediately he began to feel a bit less nauseous.
In his fifth week, his co-worker Sheila turned up at his office and took a moment looking around the tiny room, thick black eyebrows raised.
“I’ll just leave this here,” he said, putting the sack on the table. “If you want to let it go to waste, well, that’s your business.”
Hermione plopped down on the couch, still admiring the changed atmosphere, and Harry sat beside her, hands on his knees as he carefully lowered himself down with an involuntary “oof.” Hermione gave him an understanding smile.
“I think I’m bigger by the hour, too,” Harry said quietly, watching Draco’s face, which turned a wonderful pink. He put a deviled egg into his mouth, and quickly followed it up with three more, eating much more quickly than he’d normally do in public. Draco had taken a risk accompanying him tonight and he wanted to make it worth his boyfriend’s while. It took him barely a minute to clear the whole plate of six deviled egg halves and then start in on Draco’s.
It came up again, of course, when dessert was dished out, Ron piling so much sticky toffee pudding onto Harry’s plate that even Hermione started laughing.
Fleur pouted as Harry shifted forward, sighing a little. He really was remarkably stuffed already, though the sticky toffee pudding proved absolutely delicious. He licked cream from his lips, pressing a palm into the side of his belly to try and rustle up some room, and was rewarded with a burp, which he managed to stifle. It was amazing to think that he’d spent most of his childhood quite hungry, when now he had trouble recalling what hunger even felt like. God, his stomach felt so stretched-out, rounded to its limits. He wiped his brow and chugged some beer, hoping it would kill the pain a bit, but it only filled him up further.
“How noticeable is it?” Harry asked, dragging his hand across his stretched-out navel. “The weight, I mean.”
Draco kissed his neck and pushed another bite between his lips. “What’ll your house elf make us next week?”
Harry conceded grudgingly that it might. Gingerly he stroked the tight, warm skin of his belly, still bloated from last night’s excess. Kreacher, jealous to learn that someone else had been making him lunch each day, had taken to baking pastries and leaving them by Harry’s bed each night, and Harry, newly unable to resist, had taking to eating them.
“So you needn’t make me lunch!” Potter burst out, too loudly. He was never one for silence. “It’s all wiped clean between us, you don’t have to butter me up.”
“Four o’clock,” Harry repeated, hand straying unconsciously to pat his aching belly. One by one they filed out of his office, and he locked the door behind them before collapsing into his chair and tucking his hands up his shirt, cradling the throb of two breakfasts too many. Why hadn’t he stopped at one plate? Especially on top of nearly an entire chocolate cake from the night before; especially on a morning when he’d had to charm his trousers just to get them buttoned. It was humiliating.
“C’mon, love,” Emmaline said, dragging Ginny off Harry and herding her towards the floo. “You don’t want me to get jealous.”
By the time Ron had turned back around, Harry had cleared his plate and was leaned back in his chair, one hand resting gingerly on his aching belly.
Draco could see that he was. His belly looked swollen beneath the thin jumper, rounder than when they’d sat down. “There’s still half this curry left,” Draco said. “Here, let me.” He poured the remaining curry over the rice and offered Potter his own spoon.
Kreacher had left a candle burning by his bed, and, Merlin have mercy: a plate of iced cookies. Harry eyed them with trepidation as he pulled off his t-shirt and – oh the relief! – tugged off his unbuttoned jeans. He raised his wand to do a tooth-cleaning charm, but lowered it a moment later, because it seemed pointless to clean his teeth if he planned to have a cookie, which, despite the gurgling of his overpacked belly, he did. Of course he did. He climbed into bed, curled on his side, and reached for the plate.
Fleur came back with more cake, which Harry choked down half of before setting it aside for the plate of mini quiches that George brought over.
Potter popped keenly to his feet, and the witch added, “… with the copy-spell. All your reports are coming out in French.”
Harry took his hands and Draco braced against his weight as he let himself be hoisted up, smiling down at him with such fondness that it took Harry a moment to realize why the look was familiar.
In answer there was a foreboding clatter. Then Pansy yelled, “This lasagna’s hot, should we feed it to him and then see what happens?”
“You know, we are going to give you dinner,” Ron said, watching Harry inhale the bowl of potato crisps he’d just handed him.
Molly was getting misty-eyed, as she always did at the thought of Harry and Ginny’s breakup even though she quite liked Emmaline, and Harry hastened to change the subject.
“Don’t look now, here comes Dracula.” Timothy muttered, nodding his head towards Ebony who had just stepped out into the courtyard. Ebony noticed the group staring, and stuck her middle finger up at them. They raised their collective eyebrows in interest and amusement as they saw Draco Malfoy come up behind Ebony and begin talking to her. Though none of them could quite make out what occurred in the conversation, Draco appeared nervous as he spoke to her. The exchange was cut short, however, when a small gaggle of other outlandishly dressed girls called Ebony over.
Tim thought for a moment. “With any luck, the whole teaching staff will be so confused by Draco coming back from the dead that there’s theoretically no reason why we should be noticed.”
“Give me a second, I just need to grab something from the dorm.” said Adam, stopping his friends as they headed down the corridor to leave school.
Maggie looked over too. “Looks like Harry Potter.” Lucy shook her head vaguely, indicating she didn’t recognise the name. “Orphan? Funny scar?” Lucy’s memory was still murky. “Draco had a wet dream about him in the common room in, like, fourth year? Came all over one of the sofas?”
“Ew, you fucking pervs, stop looking at me naked! Are you paedos or what?” she shrieked, pulling her towel around herself tighter.
"Well, nevermind. Point is it's on the record now." Maggie turned her back and surveyed the street. "Does anyone know where we're meeting Isaac?"
The young man smiled lovingly and tilted his head. “Ebony, I love you! Will you have sex with me?” He said as passionately as if he had asked to marry her.
As they rounded what felt like the hundredth corner in their chase, they collided head-on with Matthew, Tim, and Adam leaving the Astronomy Tower.
Snape was silent. Vampire was silent. For a moment, the entire room was covered in such a thick blanket of shock that it was only when Draco scuttled in behind Ebony, naked, with his hands clasped around his crotch, did the class erupt into hysteria. Lucy and Ruth began clapping like seals and shrieking with laughter as Draco grabbed hold of Ebony’s arm, seemingly unaware that he was utterly exposed to twelve of his yearmates, grovelling at her.
Finally, they reached the surface and escaped through the cave, where, after Matthew had gained a bit of distance, Lucy spied their pursuer standing in the entrance. He stared out from the mouth of the cave at them as they fled, as if there were something preventing him from crossing the threshold, before his interest in them seemed to eclipse and he turned around, descending back into the depths of his lair.
They kept going until they finally bumped into Dumbledore, who at first chastised them for running in the building, but upon seeing their grave expressions stopped to let them speak.
Vampire glared sulkily at Jack and began to turn away, but then spotted Ebony approaching the forest.
"Yeah, fine, he was shagging Vampire while he was meant to be shagging her.” Matthew explained, filling in for Lucy and Ruth who had both now crumpled against a wall clutching at their sides and emitting a sustained, high-pitched wheezing sound that better resembled the whistle of a boiling kettle than anything that could be produced by human vocal cords.
“I was wondering when we’d get the chance to bring that up actually.” said Lucy. “If Draco’s alive, and I guess we’re assuming that the Draco who was tied up in that cave was the real Draco, then who died in the boys’ dorm?”
I think this is technically two chapters from the original smooshed together because I fucked up some of the chronology, oopsies. du NAT flamm me 4 dat!!!!
“I’d probably say this weekend if we can. If we leave it later than that they might give us shit for not coming sooner.”
“No, I do want to. I just…” her voice failed her. She fidgeted for a moment. “Well, I’ve never done it before.”
“We’re – old friends,” Harry corrected, though that was not true either. What did you call a former enemy, someone who’d been manipulated to kill the person you’d admired most in the world and now brought you extravagant lunches each day? Maybe friend was the right term. Had to be, considering Harry’d put himself on the case just to be close to him. Well, no, not close to him! Not close, it was only that Harry was curious about how Draco worked, and this was an excellent opportunity to make a connection and get to know a new member of the staff in their professional capacity. Yes, it had nothing to do with wanting to spend time with him and everything to do with Harry’s commitment to the aurors. Good to be clear on that.
“Am I going to have to restrain you so you don’t run away?” Draco said, reaching around Pansy’s body to cover his breasts with his big hands. He let her feel how hard he was against her ass.
They all sat there contemplating this until Draco said, “I’m getting us all some water. Harry, can you do an impression of a man who did not just eat an entire cake?”
“See you Thursday, yeah?” Ron said. “I’ll do a roast, you can stuff yourself silly on those mashed potatoes you love.”
“Nothing, nothing,” Hermione giggled. “All right, I’ll walk you through it. Take the trousers you’ve outgrown and –”
Harry let out a heavy sigh. “You know I did. God, I can’t remember the last time I wasn’t so full it hurt.”
“Draco, I honestly think I’ve gotten bigger since yesterday. I don’t even fit into my robes anymore.”
“I suppose Draco’s been feeding you,” Narcissa said, looking down her nose at Harry’s belly. “The boy’s always liked heavy foods. Can’t make a salad to save his life.”
“Don’t touch the hair!” Pansy shrieked, and Draco yanked his hand away. It had been going, by instinct, to thread itself through Harry’s black waves. “Christ,” Pansy complained. “I haven’t been laid in a month, could you kindly refrain from kissing each other like that? Unless you follow it up by proposing a threesome. Which I’d say yes to, by the way. If it were on offer.”
“Gold star,” Pansy said, and began unbuttoning the blue silk blouse she was wearing, letting it slide off her shoulders and pool to the floor. “Draco, would you do the honors?”
It did sound good, even though Harry was technically stuffed silly right now. He climbed to his feet, one hand still soothingly cupping his protesting belly, waved to Ron, and managed not to splinch himself as he apparated into his bedroom at Grimauld place.
It was very hard logic to argue with, so Harry was tucked onto the couch with the cake platter, not bothering with a plate, looking absolutely ravishing in a green cashmere jumper and black jeans Draco had begged him to buy. His eyes were the color of fresh leaves and his hair was behaving itself beautifully, thanks to every grooming charm Pansy had ever learned. He looked so good it was almost painful, and Draco found himself clenching his fists.
He hugged Hermione goodbye, both of then laughing as they carefully angled their bellies so they could embrace, then shook hands with Ron.
Draco scraped the last of the brie onto the last of the baguette. Harry’s belly had started to bloat, finally, after a party-sized worth of appetizers. Merlin, if he was eating gallons of ice cream when Draco wasn’t looking, it was no wonder he couldn’t fit his robes. He nibbled Harry’s earlobe and caressed the firm jut of his belly, playing with the bare swollen slice that was touching his thighs. His boyfriend looked so ostentatiously overfed; a far cry from the skinny wretch who’d surprised Draco in the breakroom nearly a year ago. He bit Harry’s neck, sucking the extra skin there, and Harry groaned.
The server had collected the Muggle plastic and returned it without Draco’s noticing. Potter picked up a pen as if it weighed a great deal and painstakingly signed his name, then began the slow process of leveraging himself to his feet. He was hunched over a bit, protective of his food-filled stomach, and as they left the restaurant Draco found himself hovering a protective hand across Potter’s lower back.
Potter was waiting for him outside the restaurant, hands in his pockets, sage-green jumper stretched gently over that little push of stomach. It would be tighter by the time Draco was through with him, he thought, and had to stop to school his features before he turned the corner and let Potter see him.
In answer, Harry turned towards her, angling his belly to one side so he could pull her close and cup one of her beautiful breasts, lowering his head to lick a stripe across her nipple before sucking it into his mouth. It absolutely killed Draco that he had to stand sideways to do this, and to kiss her, her arms entwined around his neck.
“I know,” Hermione said happily, giving him and then Draco a kiss. “Everyone’s shocked when I tell them I still have a month to go. I hope it means my baby’s lovely and fat.”
Potter flinched slightly at the name, like the twinge of an old wound. “Yeah,” he said. “Well, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t wish I could go back in time and… and…”
“Well,” Ron said heavily, “bring it in.” And he took a very uncomfortable-looking Draco in his arms, delivering several powerful thumps to his back before releasing him. “Guess you’re part of the family now,” he said. “Can’t believe my kid’s going to call you Uncle Draco.”
“Let’s get you sat down so you can stuff yourself on appetizers in peace,” Ron said, leading them to the couch. Harry reached out to steady himself on the sofa’s arm before lowering himself carefully down, trying not to simply fall back with a thud as he’d gotten accustomed to. He arched his back, letting his belly settle more comfortably atop his thighs, wincing a bit as he tucked a finger in his tightening waistband and tried to give himself more room. Too late he realized that the button-up flannel he’d worn was getting snug and the buttons strained around his mound of stomach when he sat, showing slices of the white t-shirt beneath it.
“And for his next trick,” Ron said, handing Harry a massive slice of heavily-buttered bread, “he’ll disappear half a loaf of sourdough!”
Harry grimaced. “The problem is, I don’t want to stop eating as I have been. I love being packed this full, as mental as that may sound. It turns me on, you know that. And I love how much it turns you on, too.”
“What is this?” Potter said doubtfully, though he immediately poked a finger into the whipped cream and licked it off. Draco found he had to look away from this sight.
“I’m so fucking full, is what,” Harry said, and looked at Draco through lowered lashes, an invitation Draco took gladly, leaning forward to catch his mouth in a bruising kiss.
“I’m going to burst,” Potter said, wincing as he began to eat the curry. He took a long swig of beer, belched, kept eating.
The appetizers came midway through a heated and deeply gossipy conversation about whether Giggy and De la Cruz were in an open marriage or not, Draco maintaining they were, Potter swearing they were monogamous, and Potter didn’t even hesitate before tucking into the egg rolls, the fried chicken, and the beef satay, rotating his way through the three dishes, speaking through a full mouth. His appalling manners didn’t even bother Draco.
“Really am full,” Potter commented, finishing the salad with a little grunt. “I should save some room for dinner or I’ll insult Ron.”
“Feeding himself’s not his strong suit,” said a willowy blond witch, head appearing suddenly around the door to the auror’s department. “Sir, bit of a situation…”
“Harry!” Molly cried, and then he was being ferociously kissed. “And Draco Malfoy, as I live and breathe.” Draco too was being kissed, and looking quite surprised about it. “It’s been ages, Harry, three months at least! Letters don’t cut it, I need to see your face every now and then!”
“I’m stuck in the office doing paperwork,” he said glumly. “If I’d known how bloody much there’d be, I never would’ve accepted this position.”
Draco could not quite say why, but suddenly what he wanted most in the world was to make Potter whinge in this exact manner. The lunches he’d been cooking were generous, certainly, but they weren’t overgenerous, weren’t stuffed-to-the-gills generous, and out of nowhere Draco felt this was an absolute travesty. Ronald Weasley, a gourmand? Please. If he was coaxing Potter to stuff himself twice a week, Draco could surely do him one better and make it a nice, round five days a week.
“You really are getting round,” Draco said, his tone sending shivers down Harry’s spine. He caressed Harry’s sides. “Keep eating like this and you’ll have quite the muffin top.” He gently bit the swell of hip that bowed out over Harry’s tight trousers, then dragged his tongue downwards. Harry filled his mouth with milkshake and Draco filled his mouth with Harry, both of them sucking, sucking, sucking, until Harry was choking and coming at the same time, gasping for breath, so full even as he was emptying himself down Draco’s throat. With the ebb of the intense pleasure came the after-effects of chugging that much ice cream, and he sighed as Draco patted his tortured gut.
“I don’t want to be outdone by Draco sodding Malfoy!” Ron said. “Anyway, I’m curious to see if you can get down a whole shepherd’s pie in one sitting.”
“I know,” Ron said, suddenly sounding very sober. “It’s mental, isn’t it? After everything. Oh, come on, don’t cry again.”
“Well, that’s not bloody likely,” Harry said, watching with some alarm as Kreacher piled his breakfast plate high with French toast, butter, syrup, scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. “This is delicious,” he said, mouth full, “but I couldn’t get my trousers done up this morning. Going hungry might not be the worst thing for me.”
“And, hmm, we’ll need someone over in, er, in Cursebreaking today for the Tripathi case. I’ll, er, that’ll be me. The rest of you, finish up your paperwork, for the love of Merlin. Then all back for the four o’clock. Questions?”
“I ate a gallon of cookie dough ice cream last night and barely even felt it,” Harry confessed. “I think my capacity’s growing. Along with the actual belly.”
Draco laughed helplessly, imagining Granger in her full Minister for Magic garb trying to talk Potter through one of the most basic sartorial charms in the book. Potter was grinning, watching Draco laugh. It took a moment for his mirth to subside and the basic facts of what Potter had said to sink in.
Harry nodded grimly. He put one hand on the table and the other on the side of his belly and slowly, carefully, began to hoist himself out of the chair, belly-first. He felt like he’d gained a stone just over dinner. When he’d gotten himself upright he then had to submit to being kissed and hugged and belly-patted goodbye by everyone, Fleur caressing his round side, Ron giving him a firm poke, Ginny drunkenly resting her hand on the swollen push beneath his pecs. It was not unpleasant, necessarily, but he was glad when Draco had steered him firmly to the floo and nudged him in.
“Thanks for lunch yesterday,” he said. “It was amazing, I felt absolutely revived. And I – what’s this?”
“Bring the wine!” Pansy called after Draco as he slid the lasagna into the oven. Then he heard her say, “So, about that threesome.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Harry groaned. He could already taste the flaky, buttery crust. “When are you going to let me take you out, for a change?”
“Well, it shows strength of character,” Narcissa said, nodding approvingly. “Forgive and forget, no?”
“No, your arse has gotten a bit bigger, too,” Draco said. “And your thighs. And your face, a little.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, breathless for totally different reasons. “We should, we should get you flat, get you comfortable.”
“Is it just me,” Wendy said to Draco one afternoon several weeks later, “or is your boy-toy, my esteemed boss, looking extra-round today?”
“Hi,” Ron said abruptly, extending his hand, and Draco took it gingerly. “Draco sodding Malfoy and Harry sodding Potter, in soppy gay love. What a world.”
The silence was uncomfortable. Potter began shredding the brown lunch sack nervously and Draco turned to the coffee maker, heart thudding strangely in his ears.
Draco coasted a hand across that hot, tight skin. “I lied, earlier,” he said. “I can tell you’ve put on weight.”
“Let’s get the cheersing over with first,” Ron said, raising his glass of champagne, and they all clinked merrily and then sat down. True to his word, Ron set a bubbling shepherd’s pie down in front of Harry’s plate and then another between himself and Hermione. There was crusty bread, too, and buttered peas, and more champagne, and Harry thought he’d never been so happy.
“Delicious,” Harry said, choking down another bite. He wasn’t sure how butter and flour could turn out so wrong. It was so thick and dense it felt like glue in his mouth.
Kreacher announced dinner shortly after, and everyone got up to file into the dining room. Hermione planted her hands on her knees and heaved herself up on the first try, but Harry found he needed a bit more momentum, leaning back and forth a few times and then lurching upright, belly throwing him off balance. Draco caught his expression and gave him a questioning look, but Harry shook his head, lips pressed tightly together.
Harry flicked his wand and a pillow flew at Ron’s head, which he deflected easily, laughing. Harry patted his poor belly thoughtfully. “Have I really, though? Put on a stone, I mean.”
“Merlin, yes,” Potter said. He lowered himself onto the closest sofa, a baby blue brocade number that was a thousand times more comfortable than it looked. Draco poured them each a knuckle of whisky and brought it back to find Potter half-reclined against the cushions, one hand up under his shirt trying to soothe his stomach.
Harry balanced the plate on the crest of his belly, supporting it with one hand and stuffing two more eggs into his mouth in quick succession.
Harry stood before the scuffed glass, breath held, trying in vain to button his trousers. Finally he let out his breath in a whoosh and watched the new curve of his belly relax forward over his boxers. “They closed yesterday,” he complained.
“While I’m up here, let’s take this off,” Harry said, and pushed Draco’s shirt off, his big belly nudging up against Draco’s flat torso. Draco reached down and held onto the domelike underside, hefting its considerable weight in his hands as he kissed Harry deeply. Pansy came up behind Harr, running her hands down his broad shoulders appreciatively and squeezing the thick spare tire that now encircled his waist, a crease of fat that went around his back.
They had dessert around the fireplace, drinking tea and firewhisky and eating cookies until Hermione was nodding off and Harry was too full to carry on a proper conversation.
“About to be on their fourth, if that undone button’s any sign,” Wendy said, and Harry flushed even deeper, trying to tug his shirt down to cover the evidence. “That won’t work,” Wendy said patiently, “because your shirts are all too tight.”
Potter was still staring at him, and Draco reached for his cappuccino, trying not to wonder – or care – how he himself had changed. He hoped, for the sake of his pride, that he’d improved, too.
“Oh, you two are impossible,” Hermione said fondly, finally standing up. She dropped a kiss on Ron’s forehead. “I’m going to the study to work for a bit. Harry, come say goodbye before you go.”
Harry and Draco glanced at each other speculatively, but the floo began to sputter before any conclusions could be reached. Harry got laboriously to his feet while Pansy whisked the evidence of cake away, and then they hung back as Draco stood before the floo and waited to greet his mother.
Harry smiled as Ginny reappeared with not only the drinks, but also a heavy plate of salami and more cheese, which she set on the coffee table in front of them. Harry leaned to reach for it, then paused, startled, when he realized how much his belly was getting in the way. Draco beat him to it, leaning with ease and holding it up for him. Harry nodded his thanks and piled salami onto a cracker, his face a bit red. It was all very well and good to joke about being nine months pregnant, but Merlin, he really was getting big, and fast. He ate another mouthful of cheese, another mouthful of salami, and looked down at how his stomach was creeping forward on his lap, not even full yet, but so round. The plate of cheese and crackers was clean now, and a few more bites finished off the salami.
The charm worked like a – well, like a charm. The jeans were up a size, the denim slightly thinner overall since the extra material had to come from somewhere, but that would reverse itself when Harry reversed the charm tomorrow. He buttoned them with ease and pulled on a t-shirt and green wool jumper and went downstairs feeling far more cheerful. Thank god for Hermione.
“I’m up another stone,” Harry said around a mouthful. “And then some. That’s forty-six pounds, American, by the way. More math skills for you.”
With dawning horror, Harry realized that they were going to get along. He hadn’t fully accounted for this possibility. As if reading his mind, Ginny smiled wickedly and said, “So, does he still do that little screamy thing when you bite his –”
It took Draco a second to realize she wasn’t mocking him, and he felt his tight smile loosen, surprised. “Oh,” he said. “I – certainly. I’d be glad to.”
A knock came on his door and he fumbled to slide closer to the desk and hide the swollen evidence of his binge, but he relaxed when Draco put his head through.
“By the time Ginny gets here, at the rate you’re going, it’ll be quite a lot,” Ron said confidently. “How’s the shepherd’s pie?”
He’d had to hang back from a series of planned interviews with suspects that afternoon, too full to go anywhere; had instead locked the door of his office and popped the button on his jeans, thinking maybe he should start wearing robes to work, if he planned to eat like this at every meal.
“Leave the apparating to me,” Draco said, leading him to a darkened alley nearby. Potter nodded, too out of breath from the walk to speak, and Draco took his hand. It was surprisingly large and calloused in his own smooth fingers, and there was such trust in his grip. Draco squeezed once, and with a ferocious crack, they vanished.
His jaw dropped. Malfoy’s office was small, tiny even, but it was one of the loveliest spaces he’d been in in the Ministry, which was overall drab, dull and functional. This room was bright, full but not overcluttered, all soft wood and glimmering glass and rich, velvety colors. Malfoy sat behind his desk looking posed there, as if arranged to enhance the beauty of the tableau, so tall and golden and upright in the midmorning sun, his brow creased at the papers on his desk and then smoothing out a bit when he saw Harry, almost as if he were glad to see him. A second later he was frowning again.
Harry jerked upright, eyes wide, glasses askew, shirtsleeve damp where he’d drooled on it. For a moment he didn’t know where he was and felt a rising tide of panic, but then his stomach grumbled, bloated and grumpy at the sudden change in posture, and he put a hand to it, remembering, grounding himself. He’d fallen asleep nearly instantly, and an hour had passed. He did feel a bit better, less agonizingly stuffed, more alert. He cleaned his glasses and ran his fingers through his hair as if that would make one whit of difference, then stood, smoothing his sweater. He hoped he didn’t look as if he’d just fallen into an hourlong food coma.
“Come,” Draco said in her ear, and she did, crying out as she stuttered and clenched over Harry’s cock. Draco could feel the contractions of her muscles beneath his hand, and a moment later, Harry too cried out, throwing his head back as he came.
“Hey! What are you playing at?” Jack snapped, tugging his abused wrist out of her grasp and frowning.
Deeply underwhelmed with their exchange so far, Lucy and Jack turned their attention back to what Professor Grubbly-Plank was saying, and their eyes were only lured back in the direction of Ebony and Vampire by the sound of an all too familiar sort of… faint, wet, slapping noise.
“Ah, shit.” muttered Jack, falling back down onto the grass and throwing an arm languidly over his eyes. “How are we meant to explain this then?”
Nevertheless, she humoured him. After performing the appropriate combination of tapping and whistling, she waited outside the door to be let in. And waited. And waited a little longer still. Tim was not going to be happy about this. Was he in the bathroom, perhaps? Then she really would be stuck. It was one thing being smuggled into the boys’ dormitory, the boys’ bathroom was taking the piss a bit. Lucy smiled to herself at the pun. Maybe he just hadn’t heard her, somehow?
Though Ebony looked shaken about something, nobody could take either of them seriously enough to ask her what had happened.
Once Lucy had finished her breakfast, she and Maggie returned to the dorm to gather their books for the morning’s lessons. As they passed the door to one of the boys’ dormitories, they couldn’t help but hear the creaking of a bedframe. No matter how hard they tried to suppress it, the image of Draco and Ebony wrapped in a passionate, writhing embrace barged into their minds uninvited, remaining there completely rent-free until Lucy finally managed to wrangle her attention to her timetable. She crinkled her nose in distaste. Nothing like double potions to wake somebody up in the morning. Sweeping up her books in her arms, she made her way down the corridor to Snape’s classroom.
“No Ebony, those are not roses.” Hagrid replied. Lucy and Maggie looked at each other sceptically. Where was this going?
The three of them dispersed into their respective dorm rooms to change out of their uniforms. As Lucy pulled off her jumper, it struck her that neither she nor Maggie really had the sort of clothes that would suit a concert that would appeal to people of Ebony’s kind. Rummaging through her chest of drawers, then noticing a similar pensive expression etched into Maggie’s features as she fiddled with her own garments, it dawned on Lucy that her whole friend group would be hard-pressed to truly blend in with such a crowd. She mentally cursed her parents for raising her to dress so sensibly - cable-knit rollnecks, tweed skirts and the right surname only get a girl into so many elitist underground bars, and certainly not a concert for people who never quite grew out of their preteen pop-punk phase.
Pursing his lips, Tim decided to go nuclear. “I’ll buy you as many daisyroot draughts as you can drink if you go and get him.”
Maggie didn't look at her, but held her middle finger up. Lucy grimaced at what an Ebony-esque gesture it was. She silently prayed that she wasn't rubbing off on any of them.
The next day was much the same. Lucy got up, shared a silent, wary glance with Maggie in the direction of Ebony’ coffin, was sworn at, washed, and dressed. While she brushed and French-plaited Maggie’s hair kneeling in front of the mirror (a ritual they had performed on most mornings ever since they met in the first year), she overheard a conversation between Ebony and Willow about Ebony’s encounter with Draco as they clothed themselves in their own bizarre interpretations of a school uniform. However, eavesdropping on them didn’t hold her interest for long, and she and Maggie soon left the dorm to meet up with Adam as they had yesterday.
"Not to ruin a beautiful moment," Tim began flatly with his usual unimpressed expression on his stern face, "but does anyone have a fucking clue where we are?"
Suddenly, Vampire ran in (Lucy couldn’t help but wonder how he would have known about this from all the way in the Gryffindor Tower) brandishing his wand.
Suddenly, remembering the sight and smell in the dormitory, she felt the need to be violently sick and sped off to the bathrooms with a hand clasped over her mouth. Maggie ran after her, and scooped her hair away from her face while she retched and coughed into the sink. Once Lucy managed to gulp down a few lungfuls of air, she slowly lifted her head, steadying herself with her hands gripping the porcelain.
“He’s always whinging about it the next morning. Oh, shouldn’t have had that last slice of tart, that sort of thing. The sweet tooth on that man…” she clucked her tongue.
The floo trip into the Ministry was unpleasant, to say the least, and Harry found it difficult to concentrate on the meeting he led each morning. Usually he paced around as he spoke, but today he sat gingerly on the edge of a table, mindful of how full he still was, and rattled off the day’s agenda.
“Phew,” Potter said. “I’m…” he paused and let out a quiet belch. “Scuse me. I’m getting quite full.”
“I’m not head over heels for anyone,” Draco said. He positioned himself in front of the fire so she could see him better, and held up two ties. “Pink or grey?”
“Well, you should make up for it now,” Draco said, and handed Potter one of the two rich brownies; all that remained of the frankly immense lunch. He had not expected Potter to finish everything, but now he was so close it seemed a shame to let him off without completing the meal.
“We did,” Harry said, “but I’m unhappy to say that it’s quite withered at this point. We aren’t hopeful about… reviving the person, if that’s what we’re dealing with… but after you break the curse I’ll be able to handle the vase, and look through its history to see if there’s a connection.”
“I know.” Draco bit his lip. “I’m sorry, I told her it was idiotic, I shouldn’t even have asked you.”
“Excellent mathematical skills,” Draco said. He licked sauce off the side of Harry’s mouth and eased another bite past his lips. “Tell me some more. What’s two and two?”
Surprised, Draco glanced to the timid-looking young witch at his elbow. He was technically part of the Cursebreaker’s team and she, apparently, was their collective intern, barely out of Hogwarts. He’d forgotten she was there. “Yes,” he said. “Coffee.”
“Come in,” Harry said, waiting ‘til the door was properly closed and locked before he grinned at his boyfriend.
“Giggy says he’s first rate,” she said importantly, then lowered her voice a bit. “Former Death Eater, though.”
“Yes,” Harry said adamantly. “It’s – I’m sorry it’s taken me so long. I mean, it’s nowhere near as nice as your flat, and my bed’s not half as comfortable, and Kreacher won’t let you in the kitchen so you’ll have to ask him whenever you want to feed me something, but… if that all sounds okay with you… then, yes. I want you to come over.”
Harry could imagine it, and in fact had. Malfoy, tall and slim, his blond hair shorter than it had been at school, that one gold earring he wore winking as he moved around the kitchen, maybe barefoot, sleeves rolled up to show tattooed forearms, the Dark Mark nearly hidden amongst flowers and leaves. Scowling at the pan when it didn’t do exactly as he wanted. Smirking in satisfaction when it did.
There it was, that bright, unconcealed grin. Potter pushed his glasses up and waved, so transparently pleased to see him.
She cackled, and a moment later her laughing head disappeared with a whoosh of flame. Draco frowned at the empty hearth. There were downsides to being very well-known by an old friend. Although the advice about the tie was appreciated.
“Yes,” he said, pausing on the second floor landing to catch his breath. “He’s coming. You’ll be staying in this room, Gin.”
“This came over from Cursebreaking,” she said. “Might want to have a look-through before your meeting.”
“Well, of course, you’re the type who’s up on history.” Wendy nodded smartly. “Anyway, the Minister’s got this house-husband, does all the cleaning and cooking, apparently he’s a real gourmand. Harry’s at theirs twice a week, getting stuffed to the gills.”
Fleur, who’d somehow swapped seats with Draco and was now sitting beside him, fluttered her fingers over Harry’s stretched-out navel. “May I?” she said, then gave him a gentle caress that had Draco glaring over her shoulder.
“For a meal, I mean. I mean, you always bring me food and, and it doesn’t seem fair, I should, I should take you to dinner, I think, maybe. Maybe tomorrow? I should maybe take you to dinner tomorrow?” Harry was aware he was babbling but had absolutely no idea how to stop.
“Blimey, Harry, this place looks amazing,” Ron said, turning in an awed circle. “It’s like a different house.”
Potter shoved away the empty curry dish and curled over himself, arms wrapped around his bloated middle. He was panting audibly, glasses slid so far down the bridge of his nose that they were nearly coming off, and Draco, daring greatly, leaned forward and gently pushed them back up for him. Potter met his eyes and Draco could have sworn he saw actual sparks.
“No time like the present, I suppose,” Malfoy said, pulling on a pair of white gloves, and a moment later the vase itself appeared on the desk in front of him. Harry yelped and scooted back in his chair. “This may take a while,” Malfoy said, narrowing his eyes. “Here, you can have a snack if you get bored.”
“I have found myself you mean old man!” Hagrid suddenly snapped at him. Lucy and Maggie leaned forward awaiting Dumbledore’s reply, but were only met with stunned silence. “You’re a liar, Professor Dumbledore!”
“Sit… Down… Potter…” He said, dangerously quietly and turning his back on the class as Vampire slunk back to his seat, head bowed in humuliation. “Eighty points from Slytherin!” Snape cried, suddenly whipping around with his robes swirling by his feet and unleashing a spray of spittle from his trembling mouth. Were they not frozen in place by their better judgement, every Slytherin in the room would have let out an outraged groan.
“They’ve all changed their names though, haven’t they.” Maggie murmured, not looking up from her food.
Dumbledore’s expression suddenly darkened. “No!” he spat bitterly. “I don’t give a darn what Voldemort does to Draco. Not after how much he misbehaved in school, especially with YOU, Ebony!” He jabbed a bony, accusatory finger at Ebony before turning his back to them. “Besides, I never liked him that much anyway.” He said before walking away.
Lucy’s morning was blissfully Ebony-free, and as she translated a passage of ancient runes she slowly became aware of what a peaceful feeling that was. Her respite, however, was cut tragically short at breaktime by Matthew proudly thrusting his phone under her nose, playing a shaky video with sound dampened by his and Tony Cohen’s hooting laughter. She snatched the phone from his hand and adjusted her glasses as Ruth and Amanda peered at the screen over her shoulders. To Lucy’s chagrin, the video was (of course) of Ebony and Draco. Ebony had her arms draped around his neck, gazing up at him as he sang something god-awful at her. Professor Sprout seemed to be ignoring them, as her cheerful voice could be faintly heard in the background. The video ended abruptly on a frame of Ebony presenting her middle finger at the camera.
Lucy sighed thoughtfully and looked up Ruth, who scrunched up her face and shook her head. “I’m not sure about it. I’m swamped with work, I know for a fact so is Luce because she’s copying my essay plan. You only want to go to stalk Ebony because you’re a sad case.”
“What, the forest?” Lucy made a face. “It was just sort of.. I dunno, a forest. We didn’t see anything particularly exciting.”
A few minutes later, Isaac jogged into the coffee shop, puffing and pink-cheeked. "Sorry guys!" He panted, wiping his boarish face with his sleeve. "Totally forgot you were here, I'd gone all the way back to Hogwarts before I saw your text." He looked down at their table expectantly.
“Fine, but be quick. The table I booked at Three Broomsticks was for quarter to seven, and you know they don’t hold that shit if you’re late.” Tim warned, checking his watch.
The next morning, as Lucy crept from her bed and began to dress, the door was flung open by Ebony, still dressed as she had been the night before. With her signature brand of melodrama, Ebony snatched the razor from her bedside table and swiftly drew it across her scarred wrist, before holding it to her mouth as if drinking from herself. Lucy cringed and hurried into the bathroom.
The final comment made it extremely difficult for Lucy and Maggie to not scream. They clapped their hands over their mouths and leant closer to the door.
“No! Don’t! We need to save Draco!” they begged, still in unison. It was starting to make Lucy a bit queasy.
Lucy was glad that Adam could remember what had happened so clearly. She'd probably be asked to give a witness statement of the events to the aurors and she'd already basically forgotten.
By the time they were finally back on school grounds, the sky was streaked with violet and orange. Their once-presentable shoes were caked in mud and leaves, and Lucy’s bare legs had become mottled from the cold.
“No!” the young man gasped, clutching at his chest with shaking, panicked hands as he fell writhing to his side. His fat body gave a few pained heaves before stilling entirely as his hands dropped limply. Ebony whined and began to cry.
Maggie flopped down on her bed and began to scroll through her phone as Lucy undressed. Once she’d stripped down to her underwear, she approached Maggie’s chest of drawers and began to rummage as if they were her own.
Lucy sighed. “If it were anyone else? Complete bullshit. From her? Not so much. If I didn’t know any better I’d say we ought to report it.”
“No!” Ebony cried in response, running back over to him as he thrashed around in the grass. “I thought you didn’t have a scar anymore!”
Later that day, after supper, Adam was decimating Maggie at chess in the common room, and Lucy spied Draco approaching Ebony once again. She still couldn’t hear their exchange properly, but she did manage to extract a few words, including ‘Good Charlotte concert’ and ‘go with me’. Lucy nudged Adam in the ribs with the spine of the book she was reading.
“Yeah!” Ebony replied, a little too loudly. Several surrounding pairs of eyes turned their attention to her - half of them curious, the other mildly irritated - but this attention was dealt with in her signature fashion. Ebony’s middle finger was probably the most famous finger in their year, second only to Rory Schroeder’s after Sadie Callery couldn’t keep her mouth shut in the aftermath of a particularly rowdy fifth year common room party.
As Lucy washed her face, Ebony strutted into the bathroom as well. She rinsed her face, dried it, then began to apply her characteristically dramatic makeup. Technically, the girls at Hogwarts weren’t really supposed to wear any makeup, though this rule had never been strictly enforced so most people tended to ignore it, though none ignored it quite as vehemently as Ebony. While Lucy preferred to maintain a fairly natural appearance, just a peachy flush on her cheeks and lips with a little mascara, Ebony’s inspiration seemed to be a cross between a mime and a skeleton. Every morning, she would apply a white mask of foundation, before adding bright red eyeshadow, thick black eyeliner, and black lipstick. To complete the look, Ebony would often cover her watery blue eyes with red contact lenses, though such a step was not present this morning.
Lucy, Ruth, Matthew, and Matthew’s childhood friend Tony Cohen, took their seats at their regular table near the back of the classroom. Snape stood expectantly at the front of the classroom, waiting for the scraping of wood on the flagstone and the shuffling of papers to finally end. There was an unspoken though very active running competition in that potions class as to who could exacerbate the scraping and shuffling for the longest without actually getting in trouble, as Snape refused to commence the lesson before the room was in utter silence. Isaac was the reigning champion, with Ernie Macmillan running a close second, though today’s last scrape was had by Hannah Abbott before the power of Snape’s oleaginous sneer finally got the better of them.
Lucy whipped around excitedly. “Come on! Don’t you want to see where they’re going? There’s barely five minutes of class left, it doesn’t matter!”
While Maggie, Jack, and Ruth scrambled for shotgun of Adam’s Volkswagen Polo, Amanda pointed out of the window at Ebony approaching Draco and his car on the other side of the car park. The four of them watched intently as they exchanged greetings and stepped inside Draco’s car, a meticulously polished Mercedes with vanity plates reading ‘666’ (was that legal?). They could hear the music they put on from all the way on the other side of the car park, and Matthew’s trained eye observed that it looked like Draco had lit a blunt.

Having been silent for some time, Lupin unexpectedly held up Snape’s camcorder in triumph. “The lens may be ruined, but the tape is still there!” It seemed that it was only at this did Lupin register both Hagrid’s presence and what he had said. “Why are you doing this?” He asked heatedly while tucking himself back into his trousers with his bloodied hands.
No sooner had Ebony uttered the name than the figure in front of them suddenly changed to that of a short, rotund young man with bedraggled hair and long front teeth. As the motley group inched further into the chamber, the wretched form of Draco, gagged and bound, came into view. He began to grunt throatily behind his gag as he realised they were there, and the unknown man responded by delivering a sharp slap across Draco’s hollow-cheeked face. He looked as if he hadn’t eaten in several days. He raised his head again slowly, and a bright mark glowed where the man’s fleshy hand had connected with his cheek. Bloody tears spilled from his eyes, and Lucy swallowed and tightened her grip on Matthew’s jumper as she remembered the lurid sight of him sagging down on the bed in the boys’ dormitory. If this was assumed to be the real Draco, then whose body had Adam found? Judging from his parted lips and the twitch on his heavy brow, Adam was grappling with the same question.
“はじめまして gurl.” said B’loody Mary as Lucy and Maggie entered the dorm. For a moment they thought she was speaking to them, but as they struggled to reply Ebony pushed past them. “BTW, Willow that fucking poser got expelled. She failed all her classes and skipped arithmancy.”
“Yeah, since they moved houses. I guess they got it into their heads that you can only be in Slytherin if you’re some kind of Bauhaus reject, so they’ve all got different names. Plus, apparently Granger found out she was adopted or something like that? I’ve only heard bits of the story, though, so I’m not sure how much I buy it.”
Now that they had overcome their panicked disorientation, they could more easily see the outline of the castle’s highest spires that before had blended in with the trees of the dense forest. They rose, and began the trek back to Hogwarts.
Maggie looked pensive and chewed the inside of her cheek. “Right, on a scale of 1 to 10 how bullshit do we think that statement is?”
Lucy Bonniface yawned as she opened her bleary eyes. Today was the first day of her final year at Hogwarts, and despite her tiredness, she was excited. Reaching over to her bedside table, she felt around on the wooden surface for her glasses. Her friend Maggie was already up, running a hand through her hair and making her bed.
The next couple of chapters are just short ones, even by this story's standards, so I might just upload them both today so they feel more like one chapter. That being said, I particularly enjoyed writing these two because of how batshit insane they are in My Immortal.

Harry hiccupped. The cake was almost gone, and Draco had watched him drink quite a lot of wine. He reached over to tousle his hair fondly, then stopped at Pansy’s warning look, and withdrew. Mustn’t mess with the hair, he repeated to himself.
“Oh, little things.” Draco was rubbing his knuckles up and down Harry’s side now. “You take up more space in bed, and now and then I’ll reach for you but find your belly’s in the way. I tried to sit on your lap the other day but it’s too small now to be comfortable – that belly again. And sometimes I’ll catch sight of you at work and I won’t recognize you. I’ll think, Merlin, look at that gut, and then I realize I’m looking at you.”
“Anyway,” Sheila said, running an admiring finger over the walnut bookshelf in the corner, “it’s Giggy’s birthday and we’re having cake in the break room. Come and join us, won’t you?”
She turned back to Draco, who let out a breath of pure relief. That hadn’t been so bad at all. “Darling, I brought champagne, hurry and put it in the fridge.”
Harry smiled into his pillow. “Okay, but even without… the sexual component… I really do enjoy eating. Overeating, I should say. I don’t want to go on a bloody diet, that sounds awful. And I like situations like tonight, I like when people notice, when they see how much I’ve eaten and can’t believe it. I can’t explain it, but it really pleases me. But then I see how big I’ve gotten and I’m embarrassed. I don’t know. I’m confused.”
Draco watched Harry from across the room. He was delivering what was supposed to be a stern lecture to one of his aurors, but looked much more like a gentle therapy session. Harry’s arms were crossed atop his belly, resting on it as he nodded sympathetically, and his button-up shirt was unbuttoned over a green t-shirt, which was snug enough that the folded arms had rucked it up, exposing the bloated slice of underbelly that jutted out over his waistband. He nodded again and Draco admired the little pillow of flesh that gathered under his chin as he did so. He was standing ever-so-slightly swaybacked, trying to accommodate the weight of his big tummy, which was a new posture for him.
Draco did. He also knew rice pudding and samosa and pakora, all of which Potter would be having for lunch tomorrow.
“He always did have good taste,” Hermione mused, leading them to the table. It was set very nicely, Harry noticed. They didn’t usually pull out any stops for him, but tonight they were eating off Molly’s mother’s good china, candles flickering in silver holders, and there was a champagne flute set at his and Ron’s seats. Not at Hermione’s, however – and his heart gave a skittering lurch in his chest.
“More penance?” Harry said, then draped a hand across the upper curve of his belly. “I think you’ve done enough.”
Smoothly Draco stalked over to Harry and handed him the milkshake. “I’ll rub more than that,” he said, and Harry’s mouth went dry. He fit his lips over the straw as Draco sank to his knees, gulping cold liquidy ice cream as Draco fingered his unbuttoned trousers.
“Well, that was batshit,” Pansy said a while later, wrapped in one of Draco’s (many) silk kimonos and sipping the champagne Narcissa had left in the fridge. “I haven’t had that kind of fun in a while.”
“Another stone,” he decided, and tore off a piece of the bread, loading it up with hot, melty cheese.
Harry tilted his face up and Draco kissed him anxiously, then forced himself to slow down and properly enjoy it. He ran his tongue over that little white scar he so loved, tasting chocolate, and put a hand to Harry’s face.
“Hi Freddy,” Harry said to the screaming toddler as they passed. She stopped screaming very abruptly and turned her beautiful little face up to him.
“I’ll have the green curry with tofu,” Draco said. “He will have the fried egg rolls, the fried golden chicken and the beef satay as an appetizer, and then the pad thai with duck. And…” He flicked his eyes through the menu. “The massaman curry with chicken.”
“Looks like four more bites, go on. Beautiful, darling. Yes. One more. That’s it. Well done, my good boy.”
Narcissa, seventy years old, silver haired, perfumed to within an inch of her teeth and glittering with jewels, presented her cheek to be kissed. “Hello Draco, darling.”
To his utter chagrin, his cock didn’t seem humiliated at all. In fact it was downright perky. He’d noticed this happening before when he ate too much, as if there was some strange connection between the swelling of his poor belly and the swelling of his cock, blood rushing to all the wrong places. He palmed it hopelessly then resolved to ignore it, focusing instead on the clock. He still had an hour before he had to meet Malfoy in his office – plenty of time for a quick nap, just to try and work through some of this debilitating fullness.
Never in his life had Harry actually felt like what every called him: the Chosen One. Never, until now, chosen by Draco sodding Malfoy, of all people.
“He’ll eat whatever you put in front of him, won’t he?” Ron said to Draco, and then, at Draco’s answering leer, “Oh, Merlin, I walked right into that one.”
“Master has had an appetite lately,” Kreacher croaked, pulling out a chair. “Kreacher is only trying to keep him from going hungry.”
“You’ll probably put on more,” Draco said, leaning forward and letting his breath ghost Potter’s ear. “If you don’t learn some self-control.”
Cursebreaking had ten employees, the youngest of whom had only overlapped with Draco one year in school. He was embarrassingly grateful for this, that none of his new co-workers had known him at Hogwarts, though of course they knew who he was and treated him with a kind of willful tolerance that was a cousin to condescension. Still, they were polite and did not loathe him outright, which was honestly more than he had hoped for.
“I’m just saying,” Wendy said, putting her hands up and laughing. “You’ve put on a spot of weight, nothing wrong with that, but you’ll be wanting to do a shop.”
“I’m leaving early today anyway,” Draco said, which was perfectly true. He was picking up his mother at the Manor and taking her to an appointment at St. Mungo’s; her arthritis had been bothering her. “I’ll eat as soon as I’m out.”
The truth was, Draco knew his apartment was in fact quite beautiful. Space was important to him, it always had been, and he liked lovely objects, liked nice things. It was gratifying to see Potter momentarily forget his physical discomfort and go wide-eyed.
Draco shifted so Harry would not feel the beginnings of his erection, but Harry laughed and pulled him closer.
Harry laughed at the wistful look on Malfoy’s face. “Seems I’ve found your weakness. Murderous antiques.”
“They’re not so bad,” Draco said grudgingly, watching Harry shovel cheese and crackers into his mouth. “The Weasleys.”
Harry thudded heavily down onto the couch in front of her, running his hands up her thighs. They disappeared into the darkness of her skirt, and a moment later, Pansy gasped in unfeigned pleasure.
“Stone is so much more evocative than pound, don’t you think?” Pansy said, leaning a head on her hand and gazing at Harry. “You look like you’re carrying stones in there, not pounds.”
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Still can’t quite believe this is all me,” he said. He jostled the belly in his shrinking lap. “I got out of breath climbing seven stairs today.”
“My point is, I know overstretched trousers when I see them, and the charm’s not going to cut it anymore, boss. You need new clothes.”
“How does that belly feel, by the way?” Draco said, pressing his fingers into it experimentally. “You’ve finished off most of this brie and you’re not even tightening up yet.”
“Doubtful,” Draco said, and was horrified to hear himself saying it fondly. “He’ll probably wear horrible dark wash jeans and a too-snug jumper like he does every day.”
“Oof, not sure if I can,” Harry said. “I’ve just had three cinnamon rolls. Maybe if you rubbed this thing I could fit a bit more in it.”
Draco kept his grip on her, letting the friction of her rocking body tease his leaking cock, fumbling until he found a rhythm on her clit as she fucked down onto his boyfriend, who was too full to do much of anything except lie there, belly pinning him down as he panted and moaned.
“I’m not having Kreacher waking me up at four in the morning again, shouting at me for kidnapping you,” Ron said. “No.”
“Because I love the taste of human blood.” He replied, an unsettling smile creeping across his face. Lucy, Maggie, and Adam looked at each other with a worrying glance, then back to the objects of their concern.
"Ah well, nevermind." The auror began to scribble in a notebook. "When was the last time you saw Willow?"
I readily admit that this chapter is boring as fuck. Since in the original it's just a sex scene between Ebony and Draco, I couldn't see much opportunity to have Lucy and co interact with them without reaching in a pretty major way. So, I tried to mirror the events of My Immortal's chapter iv, just substituting Ebony and Draco with Lucy and Matthew (nothing as graphic though, for the time being at least I'm going to keep it family friendly pg 13 clean). MATTHEW IS SOO IN LUV wif her dat he is acting defrent! dey nu eechodder b4 ok!
“We heard gunshots.” Matthew explained, heading over to Lucy and Maggie to check they were alright (he was always itching to show off the rudimentary medical knowledge he picked up during his summer work experience at St. Mungo’s a couple of years ago).
“What is it you want, you despicable snobs?” Dumbledore demanded, his patience with the two of them already wearing thin.
And yet, as she and Adam slunk out of the dungeons, there was an irritating, sobering voice at the back of her mind insisting that part of what had just happened was her fault. She and her cohort had hardly been the most pleasant to Draco, especially not since his conversion into gothic-ness. Had they gone too far? What had been his breaking point? Guilt began to creep through her very blood, its icy fingers clawing and gripping at her heart as she began to cry. Adam pulled her into a brotherly embrace when he saw the tears fall down her scrunched-up face, trying to calm her down but it was clear that he was thinking the exact same thing.
The group got back to the car park just in time to see Draco’s car leave. They began the return journey to Hogwarts a few yards behind the Mercedes. However, when Matthew and Adam began to descend back into the Hogwarts grounds, the Mercedes continued straight on over the castle.
“I thought Harry was seeing Britney Avila?” gasped Tony in-between laughs, desperately trying to regain his composure and failing dismally. Snape, inflamed, still made no attempt to calm the class.
“Well, I am a vampire.” Now it was Ebony’s turn to look smug. Though Lucy was disappointed that Ebony still insisted on keeping up this bizarre fantasy, she was in no way surprised. Vampire seemed to cringe away from her slightly in fear.
Jack and Adam murmured in agreement. The group took a moment to take in their surroundings. Tall pine trees towered over their heads, leaving only small patches of grey sky visible. The grass beneath them was patchy and damp, and they saw that the cave from which they had emerged rose from a small mound behind them.
“What are we still doing here?” snapped Maggie, as if now determined to follow through on her threat.
Lucy looked over at Maggie to see if she was ready, but before the two could exchange any words Ebony entered the dorm, presumably to prepare herself for the concert as well. Though she eyed Lucy and Maggie’s attire suspiciously, she didn’t say anything, instead heading straight for her own chest of drawers, donning a leather corseted minidress, some slightly tattered red fishnet tights, and a pair of black boots with sharp, towering heels. Then, without warning, Ebony seized a small pocket-knife from a drawer of her bedside table and slowly dragged the blade horizontally across her wrist. Even though Lucy and Maggie were well aware that Ebony’s self harm was not a cry for help but merely to draw attention to herself, it still inspired instinctive feelings of pity. Lucy cringed squeamishly at the sight of the blood slowly pooling up around the wound.
Once dressed, Lucy and Maggie made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast, leaving Ebony and Willow - the fourth girl in their room whose mannerisms greatly resembled Ebony’s - to their preening in front of the mirror in the dorm. On the way, the girls joined up with Adam, a fellow Slytherin and close friend of theirs as he came out of the boy’s dormitory. They sat together in the Great Hall, and Lucy took a light breakfast of a cup of black coffee and a small jam pastry (she rarely had much appetite in the mornings, and eating much more than this too early often just made her feel queasy). While they ate, Dumbledore delivered a speech welcoming the students back for another school year and giving a few general announcements.
They sat down and listened to the morning's announcements, delivered today by Professor Flitwick, before starting their breakfasts. Lucy couldn't help but notice Ebony and Draco sitting a few seats away from each other, and every now and then one would glance shiftily up at the other before redirecting their attention to their food (if one could really call what Ebony ate in an average day food, so much questionably sourced blood surely could not be good for the digestive system).
Lucy glanced warily around the room. It was rustic, and a little dingy. The thin December sunlight reflected off the snow outside, barely helping the feeble ceiling lights in illuminating the room. The benches were wooden and uncomfortable-looking, like church pews. She could hear shuffling beyond the closed door.
“Matt! You’re not going to believe this shit!” Jack, with the amount of grace that would far better befit a small hurricane, burst through the door of the common room, blunt in hand.
“Huh, wrong room.” Lucy said when they entered a large hall painted an aggressive shade of pink, then seemingly hastily painted over again with a watery black. Large posters of the Backstreet Boys dominated much of the wallspace. Lucy shrugged and turned back into the corridor, before Maggie seized her by the wrist.
She dove in further, past her ditsy-print summer dresses, past her foppish frilly blouses, past her collection of tartan trousers, until finally her fingertips found and extracted something made of black velvet. It was a dress - a short, tight one at that - that Lucy remembered buying on a whim, trying on again at home, then bursting out laughing at herself and throwing into the floor of the wardrobe in her bedroom. It had somehow found its way into her suitcase (perhaps she planned on wearing it to a common room party?), and despite her better judgement, she slipped it on and looked at herself in the mirror. She looked less ridiculous than she remembered, especially given the context. Satisfied, she sat down on her bed and pulled out one of her seemingly endless pairs of Doc Martens. In retrospect, Lucy probably wouldn’t have noticed if one pair succumbed to Ebony’s kleptomania, but it was the principle that offended her more than the act itself.
“Excellent,” Harry said fervently, and it was. The meat was tender and juicy, the gravy flavorful, the potatoes creamy, the crust flaky and buttery. He noticed with some consternation that he’d already eaten about a quarter of his, while Ron and Hermione hadn’t even gotten that far in the one they were sharing. He forced himself to slow down, to stop shoveling the food in like it was going somewhere. Vestiges from a childhood of deprivation, Draco had once said, and Harry had snapped at him not to pop-psychologize, but probably it was true. He had some more bread instead, layering it thickly with butter, and more champagne.
“I was told aurors were out in the mornings,” Draco said, then winced. He didn’t want Potter to know he was avoiding him; didn’t want him to know he still held any power over Draco whatsoever. But Potter only nodded.
“Merlin, yes,” Harry said. “And I can’t lie on my front anymore, so I can’t even get Draco to rub it for me.”
He chuckled to himself, imagining Draco’s reaction if he knew what emergency the Minister for Magic had spent her early morning fixing.
A weak laugh. “Yes. To, er, to put it mildly. But Malfoy… the war, it was… we all did things we regret. I’m not saying I’m happy with what you did, who you were – how could I be? But...” He tightened his jaw as if about to say something difficult, and Draco braced himself. “But I forgive you. I forgave you in the Room of Requirement, when I saved your life.”
He swallowed the last bite of pasta and sat back with a groan. Draco was talking intently with Fleur about Merlin knew what, and for a while he just sat there, bathed in the chatter of his loved ones, floating on the pain in his belly and the haze from the beer, one hand rubbing the fullest part of his belly, which was stretched and aching. The straining button-up didn’t help. He met Ginny’s sympathetic eye and gave a helpless little smile.
Harry darted a glance at Wendy, who whistled at the ceiling and didn’t look at them, and a moment later they were in Harry’s office with the door locked behind them, Draco straddling Harry’s lap.
Pansy, who was living in France, had brought them a cake so gorgeous it had been decided that Harry should eat it right then and there, before Narcissa arrived.
“Fine,” he said dramatically. “I suppose I might as well put this theoretical bisexuality into practice.”
“She doesn’t have a jealous bone in her body, this one,” Ginny confided. “Sometimes her lack of jealousy makes me jealous.”
They were both fully clothed, though Harry’s t-shirt was rucked up around his chest to give Draco access to the belly that had grown out of another pair of overstretched trousers in the past month. There were angry pink stretchmarks spidered around his navel and striping up his sides, and his pecs in Draco’s palms were meatier, nipples peakier. Draco slipped a hand under Harry’s shirt now and cupped one of these pudgy pegs, thumb swiping over the nipple.
“Who cares with who,” Hermione said, squeezing Harry’s hand. She was such a bloody romantic, Harry almost preferred Ron’s teasing. “When will you bring him to dinner?”
“The potential is astounding,” he said, running a hand over the marble fireplace in the sitting room. “If you gave me six months and a million galleons…”
“Aside from killing Voldemort, yes. Ugh, how did I fall in love with someone who calls him the Dark Lord?”
Draco was laughing so much tears were streaming down his cheeks, and at his side Harry was gripping his belly, laughing helplessly and saying, “Oh god, that hurts, stop –"
Lucy and Maggie huddled together on Lucy’s bed, mirroring the other two girls. “When did she start speaking Japanese?” Lucy said in a low voice.
Mini-hiatus over. Sorry about the wait for this one, I've been spending some time working on schoolwork and university applications and all that kind of stuff. hargrid isn’t really in luv wif ebony dat was sedric ok!
This chapter just didn't want to be written tbh. Technically not on hiatus anymore, but I'm not going to make any promises about regular updates (I do still plan to finish this though!!). Thanks for being patient with me

Before Lucy could comment on the new wave of anxiousness that this information had brought on, a scrunched up napkin smacked Amanda in the face. She yelped, and Lucy picked it up out of her lap. She opened it up to see the words “ready to go now?” scribbled across it in chicken-scrawl handwriting. The three girls looked towards the Gryffindor table to see Isaac poking his head out of the crowd and smiling his signature gormless smile at them. Maggie rolled her eyes and slowly stood up; Lucy and Amanda copied her (Maggie was the oldest girl in the year, and in many ways that made her something of a big sister figure to the other girls).
She woke having felt like she hadn’t slept at all. The obnoxious creak of Ebony’s coffin lid was so grating in her groggy head that she could have throttled her. She exchanged her regular scornful, silent glance with Maggie as she dressed and they shuffled behind her, muttering.
“So the timeframe’s plausible. But where would she have done it?” Maggie perched on the side of a sink and began to grind her heel into the floor.
“Oh yeah.” Jack sniggered, though Lucy wasn’t quite sure if that was because what he had to say was utterly hilarious, or just because he was high.
“I know? So after he’d done that he and Ebony just took off, and there was barely any of the lesson left anyway so Jack and I went after them because we could, then we bumped into Adam, Tim, and Matt and they just sort of joined us. We followed them into Big Dumbles’ office, and Big Dumbles started monologuing about how much he secretly hated Draco or something like that. He left, then Vampire somehow managed to teleport all of us into this dungeon thing in a cave-”
Vampire was now visibly distressed, but wouldn’t divulge any more. After a few more moments of expectant silence, Matthew helped Lucy and Maggie to their feet.
Ebony and Vampire still somehow failed to notice the presence of Lucy and her friends, who had begun to huddle closer together as they surveyed the environment. Ebony drew her wand as well, and the two of them charged ahead into the gloom. Tentatively, moving as one unit, the five who remained began to shuffle forward, hoping that Ebony and Vampire knew where they were.
Tim was still standing by the main entrance, his arms folded crossly. "What the fuck was that all about then?"
Her lower half was peppered with bruises that she must have gathered through the course of the afternoon, and there was an angry-looking graze on her left knee that began to sting now that she had noticed it. She stretched and yawned, scratching her side absentmindedly, then gingerly stepped into the hot water. She relaxed down, closing her eyes and breathing deeply.
For a moment, a trick of the low light gave the man who had appeared before them the appearance of being nothing more than a floating skull. He stared at the group almost unseeingly, seeming far more interested in Ebony and Vampire. As he slowly stepped forward, the sharp toe of a heeled leather boot peeked out from under his dark robes.
“Oi oi, don’t look now. What’s Draco going to make of all this?” Maggie nodded towards Draco who had just appeared at Ebony’s side. After whispering something into her ear, Ebony stood up and left the Great Hall with Draco, leaving Vampire alone and jealous-seeming to the viscera he was trying to eat. He noticed his three classmates looking at him in mock fascination, and responded by growling at them like he thought it might deter them rather than just adding to their reasons to ridicule.
Lucy pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. The anticlimax of her interactions with a now very giggly Matthew had made her suddenly realise how tired she was, and she looked up at the clock. If she walked quickly, she could probably make it back to the dungeons before Snape and pretend she'd been there all evening.
After that, the two of them finally sat down and the rest of their conversation was swallowed by the hum of chatter in the hall. Lucy, Maggie, and Adam settled back to their food, disappointed.
She joined the ranks of the first few students to be lined up outside the door, all muttering in discontent at their timetabling misfortune. Before long, Ruth appeared and came to stand by Lucy, fiddling with her hair that she was never quite happy with. Ruth Abelman was the type of person who could go through seven different hairstyles a day, and still be experimenting with it at dinnertime. After a few moments, the rugged wooden door opened with an obnoxious creak, and Snape emerged from the dank room in its place. The students fell silent.
“We should get going.” said Matthew, standing up while looking at his watch. We should be able to slip into dinner without anyone noticing if we walk quickly.”
She pushed the door lightly, gingerly stepping over the threshold. The room was dark, but she could hear shuffling in the gloom.
As Vampire was speaking, the five eavesdroppers found themselves unable to quench their curiosity an began to creep closer, but before they really understood what was happening, the room seemed to warp around them. The walls melted and shifted, until their surroundings were no longer recognisable. The air suddenly felt dank and close, and it took a while for Lucy’s weak eyes to adjust to the sudden darkness.
Before Maggie could nudge Lucy and make a snide remark about the unfamiliar spell Hagrid had just cast, there was a sudden violent crack in the air, as if lightning had just struck the building, and a ball of black flames rose above them, visible to Lucy and Maggie over the screen. They stared, mouths agape and brows furrowed.
The auror looked up suspiciously. He slowly set his quill down beside his notebook and stared hard at the three of them. "This is turning into a very serious accusation. You understand that don't you?"
“Today,” Snape began “We shall be continuing preparations for your N.E.W.T level exams. I still find it positively… miraculous that as many of you have managed to reach this point in your education, though I have decided to take this as a mark of my ability as a teacher than any of you having any particular talent or aptitude. Open your textbooks to page thr-”
“Yeah, but everyone is in love with me! Like Snape and Lupin took a video of me naked, Hargrid says he’s in love with me, Vampire likes me and now even Snaketail is in love with me! I just wanna be with you, ok Draco? Why couldn’t Satan have made me less beautiful?”
He led the three girls through the door and down a long hallway, then into a small boxy room labelled ‘interview room D’. He motioned for the girls to sit. "Right," he began. "First things first, could you give me the name of the missing person?"
"How'd Ebony take it? Does she know yet?" Ruth asked darkly, clearly remembering the impassioned display in that morning's potions class.
Thankfully, Tim’s estimation had been correct. They joined the crowd of students shuffling into the Great Hall, and, aside from a handful of funny looks to their muddy shoes and the fact that they were still in uniform, they attracted no attention.
Lucy scrubbed herself with her flannel one last time then rose from the bath. “I’m done, shall we go?”
Don't have masses to say about this chapter other than sorry it's taken this long to update. If uoureue a prep than du nat red it!!!!!!!!!!!
“Wake up you dozy bint, we’ve overslept. Bella Swan smashed the alarm clock for reasons unbeknownst even to herself, so you have exactly eleven minutes to be completely ready.”
Matthew shrugged. “Sure we can. Everyone’s bound to be in bed by now.” He knitted his brow in concern. “Do you not want to?”
Hagrid did not take this well. “I may be a Hogwarts student…” He paused for effect. “But I am also a Satanist!”
“That’s a point.” Lucy conceded. The atmosphere suddenly felt oppressive as the two girls avoided each others’ gaze. The muffled voices on the other side of the door now seemed ominous, and Lucy couldn’t help but feel uneasy at the prospect of sleeping there tonight.
“Draco runs in absolutely bollock-naked. Starts begging like a total bottom for Ebony to take him back because I guess he shagged Harry-"
“She thinks she’s a vampire. You kill them with a STAKE to the heart. She must have thought it was a STEAK, as in the food.”
Oops. I didn't realise it had been two months since I updated this. uhhhhh somthing something prepz fuvk of stop flamming da stroy grerod way is my daddy fangs 4 da reviows
They nodded. A nostalgic smile crept across the aurora's face. "Good old days. I graduated in the 90's, Ravenclaw pride. Any of you Ravenclaw?"
Vampire rose from his seat and gingerly approached Ebony as if she were an enraged manticore. He shakily rested his hands on her shoulders, flinching slightly as he made contact with her.
Ebony returns, thank Satan! Chapter updates may or may not become a little more sporadic as my school are encouraging us to start thinking about our personal statements and university applications and all that. I enjoy writing this tho, so I'll see what I can do to make time. Da only reson Jcak swor is coz he is hiygh ok an on tup of dat he wuz mad at dem 4 making outt!
“...although most people call me Vampire these days.” They heard Harry - sorry, Vampire - say in a low voice, almost as if he felt embarrassed by the nickname.
Good old Amanda, always the voice of reason. Lovely, sensible Amanda. Maggie, however, was sick of it. “Lucy if you don’t get off your fat arse in the next 10 seconds and get in that interview room with us I’m telling Isaac to leave you behind and you can walk back to Hogwarts.”
“Nah, invite her,” Harry said. “She’s always good for a laugh, and I’ll feel better if it’s not just me and your mum in a staring contest.”
Draco was back at his side, one hand resting casually along the back of his chair, and Harry took a moment to look at him, how lovely he was, so cool and upright and calm. He quirked a questioning brow Harry’s way.
And with that death knell, she flung open the door to the auror’s department, grabbed his arm, and ushered him in.
Kreacher gave Draco an approving look and vanished. Draco took the pastry-encrusted cheese to the couch and tucked himself into Harry’s side. Experimentally he tried to lay the baguette atop the curve of Harry’s stomach, but it rolled off.
Potter looked supremely disappointed, as if he’d been hoping for a more pressing emergency. “Ah,” he said. “Thanks Wendy. I’ll see to it after lunch.”
Draco bit her neck and began manhandling her towards where Harry lay back on the couch, looking swollen and indolent and so fucking sexy. She straddled his thick waist, Draco behind her, and she leaned forward to grip Harry’s lovehandles as she sank down onto him, both her and Harry gasping as she began to ride him.
Malfoy looked surprised, then avid. “Courtesy of your godfather, I assume. I can only imagine what kinds of horrors you found in there… Rugs cursed to smother you? Teapots that eat your face?”
He ran through the math. It was true he’d put on another two and a half stone in the past few months, which made three and a half altogether since Draco had made the comment about outpacing Hermione. That was more, in fact, than what Draco had predicted. Harry cleaned his plate as he considered this, barely noticing when Draco took it from him to quietly refill it.
Pansy cupped one of Harry’s soft pecs through his jumper and began sucking on his neck as Draco filled a third plate. She bit his ear gently. She pushed his jumper up and then slid between his legs to kiss his belly, swirling her tongue through the fine hair that trailed from his belly button and disappeared down the waistband of his pants. Harry was getting full now, the cake catching up to him, Draco could tell, and he made small, hurt noises as he started on his fourth plate. Pansy stroked the pink lines that framed his gut like suspenders, and while Harry started on a fifth plate, she pushed his belly up to unzip his jeans.
At least, that’s what Draco tried to tell himself as he stood in the doorway and took in the cramped, cobwebby room he’d been given, so tiny he suspected it might have begun life as a supply closet. But he’d never had his own office before, and besides, there was a window. So long as he had natural light Draco could work with anything. Mentally he began throwing out the hideously functional furniture and replacing it with pieces more befitting the Ministry’s new (and only) Curse Historian – he’d put in a new desk with a slimmer, more contemporary profile, replace the metal filing cabinet with wood, put down a nice kilim rug and –
Ginny didn’t need to be told twice. She held his belly in her hands and beamed at him as if he really was the pregnant one. “Sorry,” she said, “you’re just so fucking cute like this. Emmaline, is he not precious?”
Harry’s house was nothing like Harry himself. It was dark and lugubrious where Harry was bright and determined, antiquated where Harry was fresh, Slytherin to Harry’s Gryffindor. Draco absolutely loved it.
“I think you ought to know something,” Draco said. His heart was pounding in his ears and Harry looked faintly alarmed, struggling around his packed belly to sit up. Draco laid a placating hand on the buttery, softening skin of his stomach, and forced himself to meet those green eyes. “I think you ought to know that I love you.”
He could feel his overstrained stomach bloating up again and he winced, laying a hand across the round swell beneath his pecs. It had only just started to go down after that treacle tart. Halfway through his shepherd’s pie he realized that Ron and Hermione weren’t eating anymore, but Ron was still happily drinking champagne and the conversation kept flowing, so Harry didn’t feel too awkward that he was still the only one chewing.
“True,” Potter said, taking another big bite of curry, then turning to the pad thai as if facing an old opponent. He tugged the platter closer to himself and began to eat the noodles in earnest, quickly and neatly, head down. He didn’t stop when the server put another beer at his elbow, didn’t stop until the plate had been wiped completely clean and he was sat back in his seat, one hand pressed into the side of his belly, mouth glistening, breath coming in shallow pants. “Merlin,” he gasped. “I’m so stuffed.”
“Big portions,” Potter said, looking at the mound of pad thai in front of him, and then at the steaming tureen of rich peanut curry with its generous side of white rice. “One of these alone is more than enough for two.”
“As of yesterday,” Harry admitted, trying to refrain from touching the pushed-out swell of his own belly. “I know, I know, poke it all you want. Ron certainly does.”
“I promise I’ll be nice,” Harry said hurriedly. He didn’t like to be reminded that he was, “you know, Harry Potter and all.” One of the reasons he loved his department was that he managed to go for whole days at a time where nobody seemed to think of him as anything but Sir, the too-young boss who deserved respect not for his name but for the things he’d done.
“We do,” Draco said, and thumbed a creamy droplet off Harry’s chest, offering his thumb for Harry to suck clean.
“Oh, I believe in you,” Draco said airily. “Anyway, your ex-girlfriend’s coming next week. Don’t you want to look your best?”
“Put on another three and a half kilos the past week and a half, so yes, just about six. Maybe even a hair over.”
Harry felt obscurely cheered by this. Two stone was a lot. He might easily plateau before then, mightn’t he?
Pansy reappeared, floating three glasses, a bottle of wine, one fork, one plate, and the pan of lasagna. Draco hurried to arrange his coasters to accommodate the hot pan while Pansy settled herself back on Harry’s lap, snuggling around the round swell of his belly. She looked so slight compared to him, blond where he was dark, small where he was thick, and Draco felt his interest begin to stir in earnest.
“It is, nice,” Draco panted. Harry’s hands were at his waistband now, nimbly undoing the buckle of his belt, and for some time there was no more conversation.
“Molly,” he said, “I was thinking, maybe you could give Draco the recipe for that onion soup I like?”
“I see why, it’s a good color on him. Can’t you swap it out for a larger size when he’s not looking?”
Potter was breathing heavily, glasses slid down his nose and the scar on his lip somehow more pronounced after all the exercise his mouth had gotten.
“Draco, I hate to break it to you,” Harry said, “but I’m getting rather fat, and I don’t think she’ll miss it.”
He collected his various notetaking devices and exited his office somewhat sheepishly, certain Wendy would be able to tell he’d been sleeping on the job, but she just smiled and handed him a folder.
Right. No wonder he was putting on weight so quickly. Every time he made the mistake of tallying what he’d eaten that day he was frankly shocked at himself. He hadn’t even had dinner yet!
“If you want me to fuck you,” Pansy purred from between his legs, “I’m gonna need you flat on a couch. Your belly’s too big in this chair.”
“Just stretched ‘em,” Potter gasped. “Already feeling – tight – oh, fuck, that’s good, fuck I’m full.”
“Granger’s got four more months until she’s full term,” Draco said in his ear. “You think you can keep up?”
Soon enough they were tucked in bed, Harry on his side in nothing but a pair of new, roomy boxers, Draco big-spooning him and reaching over with one long strong arm to rub his belly. It was mounded up faithfully beside him, taking up so much space that Harry felt another flicker of the alarm he’d felt over dinner.
“Honestly,” she said, turning wide eyes on him. “Would you come round and have a look at mine sometime, give me a bit of advice? Maybe if my office looked like this, I’d come closer to matching your stats.”
“Anywhere,” Draco confirmed, though he met Harry’s eyes to make sure. Harry nodded fervently and attempted to swallow the enormous bite Draco had just fed him.
There was also that voice in his head, that smooth, slightly snide voice, telling him to go on, have one more bite, go on.
Harry pushed another egg into his mouth, then another, taking advantage of the fact that for once, no one was looking at them. He finished the second plate with a little burp of triumph and Draco stacked the empties on the coffee table. He caught Ginny eyeing him from across the room and grinned at her. A moment later she was at his side, offering him a plate piled high with cheese and crackers.
“I mean, I did. But now… I’m really getting big. What you said earlier, about getting as big as Hermione will. That’s probably going to end up true, with how much I eat.”
“Thank god,” Harry agreed. He tried to find a more comfortable position, but his belly was so bloated and heavy that the only good position would have been lying down, preferably on his side, preferably with a heating pad tucked against the taut skin.
“Dark magic,” Harry growled, and unfastened Pansy’s skirt, pulling it down so roughly she had to steady herself with a hand on his back. She stepped out of it, in just high heels and panties now, and Draco groaned as he watched Harry pull her forward so he could mouth her cunt through the lace of her panties, one hand steadying her on her hip, the other hand dipping beneath that lace, thumb finding her clit.
“You’ll have it now,” Draco said. He hadn’t meant to, it had just come out, and he and Potter both went still. Frantically he tried to think of a joke, a way to play it off, but a moment later Potter gave a terse nod and began eating the salad.
Harry accepted a beer and watched as Kreacher set down a spread of appetizers – a cheese plate, a dish of olives, a platter of smoked meat, a plate of sausages on toothpicks, a baguette sliced and buttered. They were on the coffee table before him, right at his knees. He watched as Hermione slid to the edge of the couch and spread her legs even further, leaning awkwardly around her belly to start filling herself a plate as Ron and Draco sipped beer and made smalltalk about George’s latest business venture. Harry, too, slid to the edge of the couch. He had to hold his breath to lean forward enough to put together a plate of food, and even with his legs spread wide his belly squished up on his lap and left him breathless. At his side, Hermione appeared unwinded. She had her plate partially balanced on her belly, but needed one hand to hold it in place. Harry, very casually, rested his own plate on the crest of his tummy, and found to his shock that it decidedly did not need any hands. It sat comfortably on the shelf of fat.
“He wasn’t joking about this,” Harry said, patting his belly, “and he wasn’t joking about the other thing, either.”
Harry moaned around the next forkful, arching his back in discomfort, and as Pansy shoved his jumper up high enough to suck one of his peaked pecs into her mouth, Draco began to rub Harry’s belly with firm, even strokes.
“So he may very well be scared of you, at first. They usually are, poor souls, even the ones that turned it around. You being, you know, Harry Potter and all…”
“—and for cappuccino, it’s three flicks to the right,” the intern was saying. They were standing at the coffee maker, and Draco blinked. He’d missed the entire demonstration, but that hardly mattered. He’d bring his own coffee from now on, the better to avoid this place, to avoid Potter. Although, since he was here…
“I’m sure it’s not,” she said, still scrutinizing him. “You know, the last time we saw each other, you’d just saved my son’s life. And now you’re sleeping with him!”
“You really can’t believe it?” Draco said. “You’re eating enough for three men your size. Every day. With absolutely no let-up.”
“Yes, I really went out of my way,” Draco said drily, and Potter let out another startled-sounding laugh.
Potter groaned, whether from this comment or from the way Draco was tracing circles around his stretched belly button, it wasn’t clear.
And with that he was gone, the bastard, leaving Harry to fumble with his trousers and try to make himself presentable. He stood, thinking it might be easier to get the fly done-up that way, but even standing his belly was too swollen to allow the buttonhole to swallow the button. Gritting his teeth, he threw caution to the wind and attempted a stretching charm, and a moment later let out a groan of despair. Wendy had been right: the denim was essentially see-through. He tried to reverse the charm, but to his absolute horror, his put-upon jeans gave up the ghost entirely, and burst into a shower of glitter. He was left standing in his office in a too-tight pair of boxers and a shirt and jumper that were clinging to their last legs.
“I agree,” Ron said, and Harry looked at him in surprise. “Not,” Ron added, “that I’ll stop giving you shit about it.”
Draco’s only “thing” to put down was his coat. He dropped it onto the scarred maple surface of the desk, then gave the wood a slightly guilty pat -- it had no idea it would soon be kindling. He followed the little witch through the dark, narrow hallway, noting the name placards on each of the offices and wondering if every space was as shabby as his, or if they reserved their shabbiest offerings for former Death Eaters. Unconsciously he found his fingers straying to his arm, to where the Dark Mark still lurked livid beneath his robes despite the many tattoos he’d gotten to cover it, and when he noticed what he was doing, he dropped his hand with a scowl. This was a new job, technically, but with a name like Malfoy, he knew he could never hope to really be new anywhere. His old self, his old life, trotted after him wherever he went, looming like a restless shadow, so anyone who wanted to see him as he was now would have to squint into the darkness. Few people made the attempt.
How long would it take, Draco wondered, until the shirt didn’t fit again? Until instead of being too loose, it was too tight? His toes curled of their own accord.
“He can take it faster than that,” Draco said impatiently, after a few minutes watching Pansy slowly levering lasagna into his boyfriend’s mouth, and she obediently picked up the pace.
“You’ll think I’m mental,” Potter said, reaching for his second slice of focaccia, “but I’ve actually started to like paperwork a bit. Don’t tell anyone. Maybe I’ve had enough adventure for one lifetime, you know?”
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, confused by the conflicting messages of cake and comment. He dug into the cake, which was absolutely terrible. “Did you make this?”
Draco had known Potter for nearly twenty years. He knew the man was determined, focused, passionate, reckless – knew this intellectually. But it was quite another thing to know it physically. Potter made love like he sought the snitch, like he’d fought the Dark Lord, like he’d saved the whole damn wizarding world: very fucking well. Even half-incapacitated with fullness, Potter took Draco apart even as he himself was coming apart, both of them panting into one another’s mouths and whining like beasts, unable to get enough contact, enough friction, until all of a sudden it was enough, it was too much, it was glorious and painful and perfect, and they were both shouting as they came.
“You mean this?” Harry said, framing his belly between his hands. He accepted another bite of lasagna and chewed thoughtfully. “I’m not bothered, I guess. Or, no, I am a little bothered. I feel a bit… out of control, I suppose. Especially when I catch sight of myself in a mirror. It’s always a surprise, how big I’ve gotten. How big I’m letting myself get.”
“A date,” Pansy Parkinson pronounced. “Definitely, indisputably, disgustingly, a date. Oh, if I could go back in time and tell the little prat I used to snog that one day he’d be head-over-heels for Harry fucking Potter.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think so. Keeps surprising me, somehow, how big I’ve let myself get.”
“Oh, don’t listen to them,” Molly beamed. “You look marvelous. I brought deviled eggs, do you like those?
Draco bit his lip. “It’s fine,” he said. He sounded dubious, and said it again, more convincingly. “It’s fine. I want to know your friends. You came out with Pansy when she was in town, and she’s absolutely horrible.”
“Right,” Harry said. “There is that. Turns out I’m a bit of a glutton. And you’re a bit of an enabler.”
“Good,” Draco murmured. “Another bite. Good. Merlin, you’re going to feel this tomorrow. Thank god you’ve got me to rub that gut of yours.”
“You can’t tell?” Potter wanted to know. “Good. I thought it was obvious. Yeah, I was a bit underweight before, so it’s not a bad thing, but… I’ve added about a stone and a half. Thanks for that, by the way.”
“I don’t want to let her into my life any more than I have to,” Draco said. “She’s… well, you’ve heard me talk about her, she’s quite judgmental.”
“Well, you look very nice,” Hermione said decidedly. “That color blue is beautiful on you, is it new?”
Ron burst out laughing. “You look so surprised every time! Oh, this is priceless. The great Harry Potter, felled by hiccups.”
They stumbled out into a scene of total chaos, everyone hugging and yelling and shrieking, and Harry realized he’d misjudged the scale of this dinner. It wasn’t just Ginny – it was Molly and Arthur, too, and Bill and Fleur, and George and his wife Niti, plus their terrible three year-old daughter, Freddy, who was sat in the middle of the room screaming her head off.
“That way you won’t be hungry,” Pansy said, “and your mood will be less likely to take a nosedive when Narcissa complains about Muggle rights.”
“You approve?” Harry said with some amusement. De la Cruz was married to a Cursebreaker and considered herself something of an expert in their office culture.
Draco found, to his horror, that this got him so hard he had to unzip his trousers immediately and take himself in his hand. He saw Harry notice this over Pansy’s shoulder and grin.
Harry walked the narrow, familiar hallway, his heart thudding for some reason. Maybe it was vestiges of the panic that had overtaken him post-nap, or maybe it was just the elevated heartrate of pure curiosity to see where Malfoy spent his days. Either way, it banged in his ears as he banged on the door labeled Draco Malfoy. It sprang open a crack, and tentatively Harry pushed his way in.
“Aren’t you worried about insulting me?” Draco said. He handed Potter the last slice of buttered cheese-bread and Potter looked up, his eyes meeting Draco’s. He looked tired and full and intrigued. He took the slice of bread and ate it slowly, leaning back in his chair as he did so. It definitely wasn’t Draco’s imagination: he was filling out his shirt better than he had been. It fit him perfectly now, and it was all Draco’s doing. Well, and perhaps Ron Weasley, but Draco batted that thought away like he would an annoying fly.
