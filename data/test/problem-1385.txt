if you wanted to."
"Er, hi," Potter says nervously as Draco steps into the room.
"You shouldn't have done that," Draco shakes his head. "You should have—"
He washes his face on Friday night, wanting nothing more than to vanish after this dreadful week he’s had. He just happens to look at his eyes in the rickety mirror hanging over the sink. There are dark smudges under them. His mirror self moves its mouth at him in a stutter.
"And you're always so sweet to me, dear. I don't know what I'd do without you," she shoots right back, holding a hand dramatically to her chest. It's gone in an instant, replaced by her elbows on the tablecloth as she leans forward. "Anyway, do tell," she says, in the sort of lowered tone used for secrets and confessions, "how was it?"
"Come on, let's get you to bed."
“I…” What is she even talking about? What on Earth did he tell her, what could he possibly have said that night that would matter to him now? “No?”
The villa is relatively small—when compared to the manor anyway—but it has tall glass windows and a large garden, and a small lake where wild geese swim during the winter.
, as odd as that is. Maybe because he’s free, or at least freer than he’s ever been.
. Seriously, do not.”
So he sits there for ages, mostly watching, quite boredly. He looks through the menu—not that he’s going to order anything else, thanks—then fiddles a bit with the napkin on his table, mostly because
He read it because it was the normal thing to do. And deep down, Draco really wanted normalcy: to have people around him that admired him, not for his blood status, but for what he had done. Granted, much of what he had done was quite misguided, but was it so wrong of Draco to want friends that stood by him with pride, despite that? Well, apparently, it was, if the way things turned out for him were anything to go by.
Draco’s eyes itch. He has a dire feeling about all this. It’s not going to end well. It’s never going to end well.
"You weren't at work, okay? I thought," she starts, taking an unsteady breath at the end. "You haven't taken a single holiday since you opened it, and when I got here you were so still and I—"
"This is my home too," Draco yells back. "Besides, need I remind you this is at least partly your fault?"
“Because,” Draco explains when he’s about to leave, Scorpius tucked against his chest, “we are not the same people that we were back then.”
“Look,” Potter tentatively starts, “why don’t we have a drink and let him sleep for a while?”
He just wants something that will help him forget. Wants something to work. But nothing ever does.
“I no longer drink.” Draco lifts one eyebrow, mockingly. “What with the pregnancy and all, remember?”
And all his efforts are useless now, because there’s no way he can flirt with Potter in front of
“You remember everything.”
"Figures. And are you going to tell him about . . ." Pansy trails off, gesturing awkwardly towards his stomach.

on his teeth. “Do you really think this is a good idea?” he heard Fred-the-ghost saying from the kitchen.
"No! I miss you." Potter steps closer and captures Draco's hand in his. He puts a kiss there, right on Draco's fingers. "I'm asking you to come back
"Really now?"
"Because it's just around you! He doesn't treat anyone else that way, it's just you, and I can't for the life of me figure out why he'd be such an arse to you," Pansy replies. "He forgave me for trying to turn him in to the Dark Lord, he even saved your life, for Merlin's sake! And you used to get along just fine back in eighth year, and now . . . now you can't even stand being in the same room together."
Draco’s stomach dips with every nervous breath.
"Just go, Potter. Go back home, or wherever it is you go when you're not here breaking and entering."
"Harry."
When he lets the door fall shut, the noise seems to startle Potter out of whatever trance he's been in.
here, Potter is. “You’re no longer pregnant. I have one of those bottles you used to like.” The issue here is Potter is asking for things neither of them wants. Things Draco doesn’t even
He looks like one of the Furies, intense and stalwart in his might, and all Draco can do is kiss him. He surges forward and kisses him, and Harry's mouth parts for him as if it were that easy. As if there were no thought behind it, no real alternative. And it's just as hot and gentle as it's always been in Draco's dreams.
“No, of course not. You were just a sentimental little prat.” Pansy rolls her eyes. “Oh dear, my family is in danger!” she mimics mockingly, hand pressed to her chest in a dramatic fashion. “Yet you couldn’t save them in the end, could you?”
his way and be done with him. It's absurd how much he wants that. In fact, Draco is quite sure he's never wanted anything this much.
, he thinks. Confused, injured. He’s gotten his share of slaps and punches over the years, especially during the last one, yet he’s never looked quite like this. A bruised lip. He can’t even open one of his eyes. His skin hurts when he touches it—marred all over, he guesses. He also guesses he should be glad Miller mostly stuck to physical strength, glad the worst he got were a couple of stunning spells and a curse—which, luckily, wasn’t
"So . . ." Draco licked his lips, looking away. He could do this. Some risks were simply worth taking. "What if I did want you to? What would you actually do then?"
"Don't go," Draco says, grabbing Potter's arm when Potter pushes himself up. "I just—I don't think I could let you leave again," he adds quickly, and he feels so stupid once the words are out, so very stupid. He's revealed more about himself in one afternoon than in several months bonded together.
Draco stares down at his hands. His fingers curl tightly around the warm china of his teacup, cradling it in his palms as his thumb strokes along the rim. He's always found Pansy's house comforting—it feels like home in ways his London flat doesn't yet, in ways the Manor hasn't in ages.
to,” Pansy says, her voice as blatantly dispassionate as it’s been through all their talk.
For a moment there, Draco contemplates losing all his clothes again, is not like his prick can stay down too long when this is the view he’s getting: Potter, still naked, still shimmering with sweat, all skin and those bloody green eyes and… those perfect lips. Merlin, they did feel great around his cock. Why not try that again, indeed, why not?
Potter tries to kiss him one month later. It doesn’t exactly work too well. Except, perhaps it works
Potter’s eyes snap open, looking down at him instantly.

is the one who's a complete and total prick, not Draco. He's the boy who had Draco's heart in his hands and crushed it, the boy who walked away from Draco when he most needed him. And Draco shouldn't have to deal with any of this anymore. He shouldn't have to put up with Potter's accusations years after the fact.
“There’s a bug in your code, Hermione. You haven’t noticed it yet, but you will.” And she would, because at least now
"How come you didn't drag me along this time?"
"Stomach flu," Draco lies as soon as the nausea lets up.
“Whatever.” Potter rolls his eyes. Then, he stretches on the couch, all naked.

exactly.
to want, but he can’t help it. He does kind of want that. He just doesn’t want it for a day or two—he’d want it forever, but Potter here is the farthest thing from trustworthy he can think of. And honestly, he can think of plenty of untrustworthy things. Like his luck. “Or we could have tea, no alcohol there. How about tea? Shall I make some?”
All in all, Draco thinks it's rather fitting: whoever they paid to make their banners obviously needed to see a Healer, light pink and coffee brown schemes haven't been called fashionable since the late fifties. But, whatever.
Harry's eyes are dry when he looks up, and Draco really wants to kiss him, but his back hurts too much to move.
Pansy snorts. “As if you’re over him.”
Draco would ignore him. When their lips met, slow and tentative, Harry's fingers would sink deep in Draco's hair to pull him closer. Harry's mouth would open for him. Harry would hum happily against his lips, melt against him, spreading his legs in invitation, and it'd be just as hot and wet and brilliant as his dreams back in sixth year.
Draco shivers, tugging him closer, sucking on his lower lip. “Upstairs,” he says.
And when Harry kisses him, not strong but deep, Draco makes a soft humming sound. His whole world suddenly feels better, determined, resolute… all those things he’s never managed to reach himself before.
Draco turned around in his bed, squinting in Harry's direction. It was dark, but if he tried hard enough he could still make out the contour of Harry's face—his cheeks, his nose, the strong angle of his jaw.
to—hold onto a table for support.
“I know,” he whispers. But he resents it’s not
Yet the thought remains in Draco’s mind, coming back when he least expects it.
On the sixteenth day however, either Potter is not on a very good mood, or his whole morning has been mud, blood and poppycock, (and therefore, not a very good mood), but when Draco reminds him, “You overlooked the sunglasses I asked for last time, remember? Classic style Aviators. Ray Ban sells them,” Potter grumbles, “What are you, an upper class hobo or what?”
Even though he has no clue what’s he’s going to do afterwards. Go back to Pansy’s, he reckons.
“Muggles are
"No, you couldn't," Draco retorts. "He used to make terrible jokes about Muggle things I never understood, you know? And I still
"I think . . ." Potter pauses, nervously biting his lip. "We need to talk. At least I'd like to talk to you, if that's okay."
* * *
“I know. I’m sorry.” He’s still feeling a bit shaky, and would prefer not to start a quarrel over chiding himself on today’s blunder. “I stopped for a cuppa on my way back.” She’s better off not knowing he never did, not knowing he basically stood half-dazed mid-street for quite a while, because the flashbacks came back when he wasn’t even expecting them. He hasn’t had a very good week. Yet, he’s smart enough to know telling her that would turn concern into real worry, and that neither of them needs that right now. “I didn’t even realise what time it was.”
When Draco comments on the obvious growth of his vocabulary, Harry simply tells him he's learnt from the best. And that's the exact moment Draco comes to a decision. Only he doesn't get to tell Harry straight away because he really needs to use the loo—one of the perks of being an even bigger whale now, he guesses.
"Oh, please," she interrupts, rolling her eyes, "when have I ever ratted on you?"
Harry guesses he still does. Or rather, he tells himself he does.
But there’s past. The sad thing is, there’s
"Nothing is going on, alright?" he cuts in firmly. "This is nothing like that." There's no Dark Lord, for one, and Draco hasn't sold off his freedom to anyone this time around, let alone his life.
"What about?"
A cry.
he writes, and Potter's response comes much faster than it should have.
Merlin, it would kill him.
"He told me he wanted to talk the other day." Draco shrugs carelessly. "I guess we'll be talking."
“Do him, obviously.”
"Well then, have fun. I'll just stay here, bored out of my mind."
“Well.” Pansy laughs, again, but there’s something dangerously desperate in it. “This is huge. Massive, even.”
Draco feels oddly lost amongst so many people, many of whom he's been avoiding since leaving Hogwarts. He guesses he should have known. It's a party after all, and everywhere he looks there are drinks, people dancing and colourful lights, there are even several giant banners floating up above him—offensively flashy things reading 'Healers' Graduation Ceremony'.
"No. Salazar, no." Draco laughs, a dry laugh that sounds more like a sob than he wants it to. "I can't do that. He'll think I'm a circus freak, he'll—" Leave and never come back, Draco's mind fills in for him. Only Harry wouldn't do that, would he?
Harry walks closer, sitting on the chair by Draco's bed. "Is who my girlfriend?"
Begrudgingly, she admitted, “Yes. Not in full detail, but I knew you were somehow together back then. It didn’t even seem weird to me when Harry asked me to
Draco groans, burying his face in his hands. "Just admit you engineered this whole thing."
Draco thinks they have all day, and this is amazing, and why not? It must be the moment’s fault, or perhaps that Draco is literally crazy about him, or perhaps the fact that he’s done in when pleasure is all, and there’s no better, because he hears himself saying, “I’m pregnant.”
“I’ll work less when we’ve got cash.” He fills a glass with water and sits on the counter by the sink, because he’s tired, burnt-out and half-dead, and he really, really doesn’t want to talk about this. Not now.
himself than go crawling back to Potter. Even though he really, really wants to. It’s not like he can do that though: there’s still a child to take care of, a child who won’t even let him rest his eyes for a mere second.
“Really. He must be freaking blind. Even I can see it, and he gets to see you daily,” she goes on. “Puh—lease. You

"Says everyone," mutters Pansy. "And anyway, I should know, shouldn't I? I see him every day."
"Aw, jealous, are you?" Pansy winks at him. "You know you'll always be my BFF."
“Yes, definitely. Please, please just keep talking…”

“No, I didn’t,” Potter says, quite dejectedly, “but sometimes I wish I had. I wouldn’t have to remember other people dying around me, people I
Draco doesn't answer. He doesn't know what to answer.
He knew he should have banned Potter from his Floo after that night. He just . . . never did. For some reason. And it definitely wasn't because he'd been hoping this might happen.
“We’re both his dads!” Potter complains, yet again.
He flicks a quick look at Potter. Come to think of it, perhaps Potter is, as in his complete lack of poorness he still somehow manages to dress like a church mouse. In all honesty, all Draco wanted was to do the shopping himself, just so he could keep a small part of the change. He’s obviously not going to ask
“I... well, yes.”
Hermione swallowed. “Harry,” she began, “say, have you considered seeing a psychiatrist? They deal with, well, with this kind of... issues.”
Instead, there's Draco naked underneath the sheets, his clothes strewn all over the floor, and then there's Potter, naked as well—naked and
It’s not quite an apology, but it’s certainly getting too close to one to feel anywhere near right for him. It’s enough for Draco to pull back and try to remember Potter is

can’t see it.
Draco blinked, startled out of his thoughts. "I thought you had always wanted to be an Auror."
Draco eyes her doubtfully. “I don’t know…” It might be Pansy’s grin while talking about Potter, it always makes the hair on his arms stand on end. She is most definitely up to something. What though? He wonders. “Did you ever have any of that honour thing? I honestly can’t recall… I thought those who had it went to other Houses, not ours.”
“—dy hell, you’re not even listening to me!”
“Yes, I understand,” Draco reassured him. He raised his hand to thread through Harry’s hair and swept it back. Harry relaxed as Draco essentially pet him. “That’s... That is bad... That explains why he was so... unstable. I can’t imagine splitting your soul even once.”
“It might not be enough,” Draco warned. “Even if our souls are different, it might not be because of the horcrux. Perhaps souls are like fingerprints and everyone’s got a different one. We may need to ask others to participate in this experiment.”
Draco frowned at the door that appeared in front of him. He grabbed the handle and stood there for a moment. “What I need is... I need my father,” Draco finally decided. The words just as much as his tone made it clear that whatever he’d been doing all year, it was out of Draco’s depth. With an almost savage strength, Draco opened the door, resolutely stepped into the room, and closed the door behind him.
If Andromeda noticed that Harry had an easier time with Teddy, she was tactful not to mention it outright. She made sure both boys got plenty of attention while in her house. She waited awhile before broaching the subject of survivor’s guilt, but only did so to offer her own shoulder to cry on should Harry need it. At first Harry had no intention of taking her up on her offer, but eventually he found himself sharing small bits of truth. Nowhere close to the whole horrible story, but enough that he lost some of the tension he’d carried since he woke up.
“He’d want to decide for himself what happens to the boy,” Lucius disagreed. “He’d see your actions as disrespectful and presumptuous.”
“It’s unfair,” Mrs. Weasley said when Harry quieted down enough to hear her. “It’s unfair, and I hate it, but it’s not your fault.”
“Yes,” grumbled a few prisoners that heard Harry’s question. Harry took the tray without further comment and once again started picking at his food. He thought he understood now why so many of the prisoners refused their meal. Of course, the dementor visit likely negatively influenced their appetite as well. Harry was beginning to understand how most prisoners ended up looking rather gaunt despite Malfoy’s assurance that he would get three meals a day.
“Er, right, but...” Harry frowned. It didn’t seem right.
Surprisingly, despite the threats, their conversation had cleared the air enough that the dinners were no longer tense affairs. Both Lucius and Harry participated more in the conversation, and even spoke civilly towards each other. By the time Andromeda was ready to invite her sister’s husband into her home, Harry was prepared and willing to attend and support her. There were plenty of uneasy moments, but it helped that Lucius was kind to both Teddy and James, despite his feelings about both boys’ parentage.
Draco lost the defensive look as he considered Harry’s word.
“Consume- I’m not- it’s not food to me,” Harry stressed. He thought back to how little he had eaten since kissing Burke. “I mean, I
All three of them watched Jugson walk away. Harry would have been relieved if it didn’t mean he got a good look at the man’s hairy arse. Even without his glasses, Harry could tell it was an unpleasant sight.
“No idea,” answered Malfoy. “Fortunately it tastes as bland as it smells.”
The sound of the hallway door opening again interrupted whatever Wiblin was going to say in response. Heavy footfalls moved towards the little gathering. Harry wasn’t surprised to see it was yet another guard.
“Harry,” Hermione said softly and placed a hand on his arm. “Was it... was it really bad?”
“Hale is contacting a reporter he knows. I’m going to give an interview, try to appeal to the public… not that I even know where to start. There’s just so much,” Harry said with a gesture to the scroll.
Still... Harry also knew it would be effective. He and Hermione were on a wild goose chase to find all of Voldemort’s horcruxes. If by some miracle they managed that, they still had to figure out how to destroy them.
“Harry Potter,” Harry responded as he shook his hand.
“Could you maybe, er, not look?” Harry asked.
“Right, and we’re supposed to trust you?” Parkinson asked. “You’re probably setting a trap.”
“We’ll go to the kitchen with you,” Ron offered.
“Potter?”
“But you believe Draco was behind this,” Malfoy stated more than asked.
Instead of arriving at the ministry as he expected, they are standing at the edge of a large body of water. As far as Harry could tell, there was nothing for miles around.
“Wait,” Lucius said after a few moments. “Do you think you could cast some illusions to make it appear as if he is still injured?”
Harry picked up the first book he wanted, but had trouble finding the second. He moved to see if it was in the next isle over, but froze when he spotted the sixth year Slytherin boys all working at a table. It was rare to see them all together, but Harry assumed they must have followed him like a good chunk of the school. He took a moment to observe them, before it dawned on him that it was a good moment to deliver the letters. He hesitated over Zabini’s presence as his father - nor several step-fathers - wasn’t a known Death Eater as far as Harry knew. Harry hoped that Draco and the others would be able to ensure Zabini kept the matter to himself.
“You do seem to be consuming it faster than we do,” observed Asherath.
“Potter isn’t innocent. He won’t bet getting out no matter what the
The others argued with Theo, but Harry paid it no mind. He was too focused on Draco, who sat down next to Harry as he continued to look over his notes. Harry felt ridiculous at how happy it made him to have Draco sitting next to him.
Harry felt minimally better when casting spells, so he decided to spend the rest of the night distracting himself in this manner. Slowly he added more and more pebbles until he had about a dozen hovering in front of him at eye-level. He set them to move around his head in a wide circle. When he grew bored of this, he alternated moving them up and down. It reminded him of a muggle merry-go-round.
“It’s in his laugh,” Mr. Weasley said. “When he laughs... I see Ginny then.”
“OK?” Draco questioned.
“What’s another way to make a transfiguration permanent?” he asked. He was proud of his creation and wanted the brush to last. Lucius guided him in using blood magic to lock in the spell. The benefit of this method was that anyone other than Harry would have a hard time reversing the magic. The downside was that the spell would reverse itself at Harry’s death. Harry knew most people would be wary of using blood magic as it was a branch of magic that often intersected with dark arts. However, Harry knew this type of magic could be used for good. The wards meant to protect him during the summer used blood magic. Harry also recalled that Slughorn claimed his mother gave him a transfigured fish that reverted back upon her death. Harry suspected his mum had been rather gifted in blood magic.
Harry blinked a couple of times as he was thoroughly confused. “I didn’t,” he said slowly and wondered if he somehow managed to halt the deterioration subconsciously. “I’ve been using Burke to power my magic almost non-stop since it happened.”
“No real harm done-” said Dumbledore.
“Good quality to have,” Mulciber conceded. “And kudos to you Harry for not starting with ‘he’s hot’.”
Harry felt he should resolve to stop using wandless magic, but that seemed impossible. Even if he could grow accustomed to the uncomfortable feeling of having an extra soul in him, he couldn’t stop being a wizard. If he was ever released, he’d go back to Hogwarts and would cast multiple times a day. It wasn’t like he could explain why he couldn’t do the practical portion of his classes. McGonagall wouldn’t stand for it, and Snape would demand he be expelled if Harry insisted on living like a muggle. Harry couldn’t go back to living with the Dursleys fulltime. He just would not. In some ways, being stuck in Azkaban was preferable.
. The knowledge subconsciously and unintentionally passed from Voldemort to Harry through their connection. Harry knew the exact steps he had to take. It was why the idea had stuck around. He knew it would work.
“I suspect Scrimgeour and his like feared Dumbledore would snatch you away the second you were out of prison. They hoped to give you a guilty verdict without having to move you,” Hale groused.
Harry let out an embarrassingly needy whine as Draco’s lips met his. He knew he shouldn’t, but he allowed himself this one moment of weakness. Instead of pulling away, Harry deepened the kiss as he pulled Draco closer. He didn’t know if it lasted a minute or an hour, but he felt at peace and happy for the first time since he made that damned horcrux. He would have stayed that way had Draco’s other hand not started to tease the hemline of his shirt.
I didn't want to humanize Burke by giving him a first name, but it seemed odd that all his coworkers kept referring to him as Burke. I don't know about you, but most people refer to me by my first name. So, I settled on Maxim Burke because it sounded like 'maximum berk' (sorry if anyone reading this is actually named Maxim Burke!). As in true J.K fashion where names have meaning, his name would mean "the greatest fortification". In a way it works as he serves to build up Harry's defenses against an attack... and I think this subconsciously led me to have Harry build a literal wall around him at the end of this chapter.
There was an awkward pause.
“You’re insane,” Harry said and once again tried to buck the man off. He wasn’t flexible enough to reach him with his legs and couldn’t get enough leverage to free his arms.
“How could I when his father’s right here and threatening me with unnecessary sex ed lessons?” Harry responded. Mulciber snorted, Rodolphus chuckled, and Lucius tried to look unimpressed but ruined it with a smile. “But, er, he is that too,” Harry added shyly. Draco might not have the same glow about him this year, but Harry thought he was still unfairly beautiful.
Harry didn’t protest as Hermione gently lifted the baby out of his arms. He was shaking too much to hold him anyway. But he did watch him, and took in all the features he’d gotten from Harry... It’s wasn’t his dad’s hair and his mum’s eyes. It was all
“Can you not do it yourself?” the dementor asked. At the sound of its voice, Harry recognized the dementor as Asherath. Harry looked at him pleadingly, hoping the dementor had grown fond of him enough to want to help.
“While this... situation is terrible, the ministry cannot condone violence against muggles,” a wizard stated.
“Just don’t be surprised if people start kicking you,” she added.
“But I did mean it at the time. I really wanted to hurt her for killing Sirius,” Harry admitted. “It was actually frustrating that it didn’t work.”
“It should probably just be you, Draco, and Crabbe,” Harry pointed out. Parkinson and Zabini frowned, but Theo nodded.
not really. Harry recalled the sense of rightness he’d felt when he was first given the child. Ginny didn’t destroy his horcrux, because the baby was its new vessel.
Somehow, they made progress in finding the horcruxes and ways to destroy them. When he learned Dumbledore always meant to sacrifice him, Harry had been hurt and betrayed, but not as scared as he thought he’d be. He didn’t know if he would have still walked to his death had he not made a horcrux, but it didn’t matter. Ginny had the means to bring him back, so he stood still and let Voldemort destroy his own horcrux.
Perhaps because he’d used Crabbe’s gift as the inspiration for Neville’s, Harry immediately considered the brush and mirror he’d made for Lucius. It felt uninspired to create the same gift, but Harry hoped that like with Neville’s gift, he would figure out a way to make it something unique as he went. He started by changing the design. It would have been a little embarrassing to use a dragon motif. He didn’t think Draco would immediately jump to the conclusion that Harry had a crush, but Harry had gotten used to Mulciber’s teasing that it felt like too big of a statement. Still, Harry thought Draco would appreciate some significant design, so he fashioned the handle of the mirror with peacocks.
He spent the rest of the night theorizing how it could be done. He thought he could make it work if he had both mirrors in front of him, but he couldn’t puzzle out how to do so at a distance. The only reason he didn’t give up hope was because he used his own blood on Lucius’ mirror to make it permanent. Harry was certain that blood magic might be the key to connecting the two mirrors, but he didn’t know enough to figure out exactly how he can use it for this additional purpose.
“That’s because he has the good sense not to like you,” Lucius bantered. There was no real heat behind either of the men’s words.
Before Harry could ask what that had to do with anything, the sound of the door opening at the end of the hallway interrupted their conversation. As the other prisoners did not immediately start moaning, Harry figured it was the guards this time instead of more dementors. His suspicion was confirmed as he heard them passing out lunch. Harry was surprised when it sounded like the guards were having a more difficult time rousing the prisoners than they had that morning. A large number of the ones that were responding were refusing the food.
“I wouldn’t call that fortunate,” muttered Crabbe.
“Leave the boy be,” Nott muttered after he spat out a mouthful of toothpaste during his morning routine.
Harry watched as Draco tapped absently over a part of his notes. While Draco probably wondered about how the mirror got there in the first place, the bigger mystery was why Harry incorporated blood magic into his spell. In order for that to work, it would require blood magic on both objects. Performing blood magic in Azkaban was even more improbable than somehow getting their hands on the mirror in the first place.
Dagaz-Dawn: Intuition, light within, breakthrough, awakening, embarking on an enterprise
Considering Burke left without unlocking Harry’s cell for the dementor, Harry was pretty sure that the threat to have him kissed was just a scare tactic. However, Harry had seen enough of Burke’s personality to believe that the man would probably try to assert his dominance again somehow.
“There is nothing
“I use a potion that prevents hair growth,” Lucius blinked in surprise. “It only works for 18 months at a time, but it hasn’t worn off yet.”
“I guess,” Harry snorted. Reluctantly he levitated the rocks away from him. He lined many against his own walls but had to return some to the hallway and the other cells. As soon as all the pebbles were on the ground, the uncomfortable feeling of having Burke’s soul wedged in him returned. He was tempted to start levitating the rocks again, but if the other prisoners were waking up then the guards would be by with their breakfast in the next hour or so. Harry couldn’t chance it.
“This doesn’t concern you, Nott,” Burke warned.
“Sorry, you probably had a whole speech. Did I ruin it?” Harry worriedly asked. His hand closed over the ring as if fearful Draco would take it back because Harry interrupted.
“What? It’s not like you thought any different,” Ron defended. Hermione didn’t deny it.
“Yes,” Harry answered. He had not looked away from the man, so he noted the relief his words brought.
He goes mad as a bag of ferrets. Which almost makes him laugh, considering he’d been one for a while, and it bloody

his father.” Draco’s hands clench into fists. “His father is that bloke who kicked me out of his home when he found out about…” His own lips press tightly closed—he can’t say it, he won’t say it. He doesn’t want to feel like that again, like he’s useless. He’s doing something with his life now: he’s working a decent job, he’s taking care of Scorpius. He is
"Come on in, you git," Potter says, grabbing Draco's wrist to pull him inside. "It's raining out there."
"You're stirring clockwise, Malfoy," Potter points out. "You're supposed to be stirring counter-clockwise first, then clockwise twice, and finally, counter-clockwise for about—"
“Absolutely.” Draco grins, as he bends his head slightly to kiss Harry, sucking at the tongue that invades him. It feels like a promise, a promise of lust and clumsy tumbles under sheets when sun goes down. “Granger said there’s a gala next week. She said you’re going—”
There's obviously no easy way to say this, so he writes, 'Mother, I'm pregnant,' and quickly ties the scroll to his owl's leg.
He pauses awkwardly by the door. "You're awake."
"It's Potter's, isn't it? Potter's baby."
. Then again, when have they ever tried to talk before? Without spells, blasphemy and insults involved.
It stings like a thousand needles trying to crawl their way through his skin. It stings so much it takes Draco several seconds to register the cracks of Apparition around them, and he's only faintly aware of Harry dragging him behind cover, all the while mumbling, "You bloody idiot…"
Harry hisses and moans somewhere above him, and Draco can hear the dull thud of his fist hitting the wall when Draco goes deep on him, another muttered, "Fuck," every time the tip of his erection hits the back of Draco's mouth. It's a manic dream, it's exhilarating, and Draco is trying his best not to come just yet because he
right then.
It's soon after that that the random vomiting starts. Morning sickness, Pansy keeps calling it, and Draco thinks the name is beyond laughable—especially when, as he soon finds out, it can happen at any point during the day.
"I meant what I said," Potter tells him, pushing Draco back until his spine is uncomfortably pressed against the armrest. "I'm really am sorry, I know I was an arse to you."
And that was exactly how he spent his Sunday. At first neither Ron nor Hermione paid much attention to what he was reading, but Hermione was too observant not notice Harry had been reading up on something they were not covering in their classes. He’d claimed he was merely curious. Hermione did not push him, but she kept eyeballing the textbooks. Harry knew she’d eventually figure out his main interest. It wasn’t that hard since he was looking up how to connect two objects, and several ways to use reflective surfaces for more than primping. He didn’t know what reasoning she’d assume he had, but Harry felt safe that she wouldn’t jump to the conclusion he was trying to contact Lucius.
“And it’ll really let me speak to my dad?” asked Crabbe once Theo and Harry grew quiet.
“What?” asked Harry.
“Please sit,” Hale said. He wasn’t quite what Harry was expecting. Given that Lucius and Albert had spoken so highly of the man, Harry had expected a pureblood with a holier-than-thou attitude. The man was certainly dressed in an expensive robe, but otherwise didn’t look like most pureblood wizards Harry knew. For one thing, the man’s hair was shorter than most purebloods his age seemed to prefer. Hale styled it so it still screamed ‘expensive’, but it almost seemed like a muggle hairstyle. Furthermore, the man has built in a way that Harry had come to expect only from Quidditch players. Unlike most wizards Harry knew, Hale seemed like he spent a good portion of his time exercising and building muscle. It made the man appear imposing. His apperance probably helped him in his chosen career.
down too... I don’t want him to be my horcrux, but the alternative is just as damning.”
“Draco,” Lucius said reverently.
“The twins started a new line of products in your honor,” Neville added. He hurried to his own trunk and pulled out an item. “This is part of their
Once they reached the stalls, Harry was surprised that the two men still kept Harry in the middle. Harry would have protested but Mulciber abandoned his stall to move into the one on Albert’s other side.
The others told him about the constant stream of reporters that hovered around the school. The professors couldn’t officially allow them on school grounds, but they turned a blind eye to the interviews that happened in Hogsmeade.
More banging noises rang out as the prisoners slowly sat to await for breakfast. Harry recognized the sound of a food tray being pushed across the floor from his time with the Dursleys. Sure enough, eventually two guards entered Harry’s field of vision and slid a food tray into Albert’s cell.
“Harry… shouldn’t we finish the outline since your meeting is now set for tomorrow?” Hermione said. She wanted to encourage Nott to leave but didn’t want to be overtly rude about it.
“Depends on how much the ministry tries to stall him,” Nott said honestly. “But don’t worry. He won’t back down from the minister himself.”
“A boy who cast an unforgivable,” dismissed Runecraft. “The law does not state that the cruciatus curse is an unforgivable curse only for those who’ve reached maturity. Children are not exempted, madam.”
“No problem,” Harry offered.
“We can go through the rounds,” Harry offered. “I can give Hale a letter each time I see him.”
“Just as well. Not sure how we’d have pulled that off without being able to read and write them,” responded Nott. “What about arithmancy?”
The other subjects were similar to Harry’s experiences at Hogwarts. Someone would go over the theory, and if there was an incantation, Albert or Lucius would demonstrate the wand movements. The major difference was that these lessons moved quickly. Harry didn’t have to wait for an entire class to master the spell before moving on. And having multiple tutors meant that when Harry got stuck on the theory, another man would jump in to try explaining it in a different way. Harry was worried that he was learning
“I’ll go with you,” Perkins said. “Bradley, please help finish off the forms.”
“Now is as good a time as any. It’s not like I’ll have any privacy while in Azkaban,” Mulciber pointed out.
It didn’t help that when the guards brought breakfast, they too were staring at the area. Harry assumed that Burke or Wiblin must have been bragging about it to their colleges.
“I’m good,” Harry stated. At Burke’s narrowed eyes, he added “it’s a bit too cold now anyway.”
“What’s your plan?” asked Hermione. When Harry glanced up at her, he knew she was trying to be supportive.
“I didn’t even know Canadians could get angry,” laughed Rabastian as he recalled the trouble his brother had gotten into.
“That’s an exaggeration, Severus. He has been doing remarkably well considering,” McGonagall said.
“What? You were his...” Draco asked horrified.
Having Hermione and Ron at his side felt right, but watching the rest of the gathered Weasleys, Harry couldn’t help but think it was wrong. Fred and Ginny were missing, and it left two large and obvious holes. Mrs. Weasley was holding a tiny baby with black hair instead of red.
Once the others asked all the less personal questions they had about Azkaban, the conversation turned back to what was happening in Hogwarts. Since Ron, Hermione and Neville had updated him about the reporters already, the others mostly told him the standard school gossip. Harry wasn’t all that interested in who started dating who, beyond the relief he felt knowing Draco hadn’t started seeing anyone in his absence.
“Please don’t. The ministry would just assume it was me and send me right back to my cell,” Harry said.
Anton pulled out a new folder from the filing cabinet. When he placed it on his desk, Harry noted the label was a serial number. He was pained to realize it was about to be his criminal serial number.
Harry took to researching two-way mirrors as obsessively as he had tried to figure out what Draco was doing all year in the Room of Requirement. He really hoped he’d have more luck with the mirrors than he’d had with Draco. It helped that he had someone assisting him this time.
“This is unfortunately business, Harry,” the man said. “Rather unfortunate.”
“Yeah, well…” Harry stalled. He still thought it was best not to come out and admit to anything.
“How long do you think it’ll be? Or are they really going to ask for more paperwork before they start my trial?” Harry asked after he signed the last form Hale brought for him.
Harry was a little horrified to see that Malfoy seemed to be on the verge of crying. It was ten thousand times worse than being faced with a crying Cho. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. The man had appeared cold and distant in the past, but it was clear that he loved his son. Harry recalled the numerous times Draco had indignantly proclaimed he would tell his father about any sleight. Harry had the epiphany that Dumbledore was wrong. Lucius Malfoy has been fighting his son’s battles for years. The man would probably gladly stand in front of even Voldemort if he though he could shelter Draco from further harm. Being stuck in Azkaban, unable to help his son, was probably a fate worst than any pain Voldemort could dish out for his previous failures.
“Just give us something pretty to look at. Anything is better than these stone walls,” said Avery. Harry picked the pinup poster of Wilda Griffiths that Seamus kept on his nightstand.
“Vincent,” he read and passed it over to Crabbe.
“What else? There must be more to your suspicions than just an odd conversation with a shopkeeper,” said Malfoy.
Harry dutifully wished his son a good night, and bid goodbye to those he ran into on the way out. Draco made sure at least one of those people was one of his best friends. Hermione didn’t look too pleased with him, but she already had her hands full with Ron. He and George had their own share of alcoholic beverages that night, though Harry thought they’d stopped short of drinking enough to be sick.
As they pull away from the shore, the fog grew thicker until Harry could barely make out the men next to him. Bradley tightened his grip on Harry’s arm. Harry briefly entertained notions of kicking the prat and trying to swim to shore but quickly discarded the idea. Even if Harry could undo the magical bindings and lose them in the fog, he was no longer sure which direction to go. With his luck, if he didn’t drown, he’d probably end up swimming to Azkaban… or into a waiting dementor’s arms.
He panicked, wondering what happened to Voldemort and his friends. He hoped his own relative safety in a hospital meant that they were okay.
“It’s not that,” Harry said. There was definitely no love lost between Harry and the Dursleys. “I just don’t feel like talking about them.”
“I know! I’m prepared! Please for the love of magic, stop,” Harry was beyond embarrassed now.
“I’m honored to call James my grandson,” Lucius informed him, which surprised Harry until he added, “Draco has done an admirable job raising him with the manners expected of a child from our family.” Harry didn’t bother disputing Lucius’ claim that Draco was solely responsible for the proper upbringing of their child. Harry reinforced the please and thankyous, but Draco was the one that insisted on proper table manners and how they should behave in public. He suspected those were the manners Lucius cared about. Even Harry got the occasional ‘stand up straight, dear.’
As the footsteps came to a stop in front of Harry, he found himself blinking at Scrimgeour.
“Could you get Crabbe too?” Harry asked as she marched away. She held up her middle finger in response and continued to walk away.
“Hi,” said Nott with a hint of amusement. Rather than feeling defensive, it actually put Harry at ease as it reminded him of Albert.
The sound of someone clearing their throat had Harry glancing behind him. He saw Ron and Hermione hovering awkwardly behind him.
“Er, probably sometime in the past three days,” Harry said honestly. “Look, we’re going to be here all night. Can you please just go get Theo?”
“I wasn’t sure there was anything you could do,” Harry admitted slowly. Dumbledore looked sad at his response.
“Harry, just the man I wanted to see,” Hale said with a large smile. “This is my son, Dazhbog,” he introduced, and Harry tried to keep a straight-face at the somewhat pretentious name. The two students said hello politely. Harry had not thought too much about Hale’s children, though he vaguely recalled the man being concerned about them when Umbridge’s actions had come to light. Harry wasn’t too surprised to learn the man’s son was in Slytherin. He assumed it was Hale’s house as well.
“I’ve known... almost since the beginning. You know I’ve been ordering books internationally? Some countries aren’t as restrictive and openly study soul magic. I found the ritual in one of the texts I bought,” Draco explained.
“Unforgivable curse,” offered Bradley as an explanation while he interrupted the man.
“You could also use a surrogate,” Lucius suggested, either unaware or unconcerned about risking some unknown person’s life if Harry’s worst fears came to pass.
“I mean,” Hawkworth stammered and blushed, “
“Harry,” Lucius said in a tone that was meant to placate him, “it’s hard to believe in the good of muggles when most of our grandparents actually lived through decades of witch hunts.”
“Is there one for my mum too?” asked Crabbe. “She’s been...” he trailed off awkwardly as he eyed Harry, not sure how personal he should be with him.
“I save the articles... you might want to avoid reading a couple of them, but most were on your side,” Hermione said.
“I’m not sure,” Harry said slowly as he second-guessed himself and tried to remember. He knew Draco and his fellow slytherins were willing to help Umbridge, but he wasn’t sure if they did so with knowledge of exactly what went on in detention. Even if they did know, Harry wasn’t sure he could blame them for not speaking up. Harry himself had been adamant about not saying anything in the false belief that it would somehow mean Umbridge won. It seemed stupid now.
“Ok... but would you please take these,” Hermione said and riffled through her bag until she pulled out a stack of pamphlets. “Just – just in case you change your mind.”
“Thank you,” he tried to tell Hale, but his voice was drowned out by the cheers from the news and spectators allowed to attend the trial. Hale must have seen the sentiment on Harry’s face regardless. They smiled at each other, and Hale gave Harry a few comforting pats on his shoulder.
Harry wondered why Malfoy didn’t seem upset at the news.
“Are we sure it’s real?” asked Nott. Harry couldn’t help but instinctively bristle, but he understood their skepticism.
. That was how these men viewed him. Harry was so glad uncle Vernon couldn’t see him at this moment. The man would have had a field day.
“Do you even know where I live?” Harry wondered and leaned against Draco’s side for support.
“We remember that all too well,” Mulciber snidely commented. As the others started ribbing Lestrange about some youthful indiscretion where he apparently tried to sneak into the Harpies locker room but instead mistakenly went into the opposing team’s locker room. Apparently, the Moose Jaw Meteorites were not too happy with him.
“It’s beautiful,” Lucius remarked. Harry jerked his head up and noticed that the man was sitting up in his bed. He looked wide awake, so Harry knew he had watched Harry work for awhile.
“You do,” confirmed Lestrange.
"Darn... I guess you can always use 'Harry Malfoy' as one of the passwords," Mulciber suggested. Even though Harry couldn't see him, he was sure the man was smirking.
“He won’t be safer with me,” Harry whispered. He couldn’t blame Lucius if his acceptance was only a scheme to provide his son with extra protection. It pained him, but he could understand it. Lucius was trapped, unable to help his son except perhaps to convince someone else to take on that responsibility. The plan might have worked if Harry had been anyone besides the boy-who-lived. “Vol – you-know-who would just be even more happy to hurt him if he knew Draco mattered to me.”
“It won’t hurt to know the basics,” said Nott firmly. Harry nodded in agreement.
“I should try to find your sons before supper,” Harry offered. Lucius and Albert were conflicted as they wanted to keep talking to Harry, but the thought of seeing their children after so long was too tempting to pass up.
“Not really,” Harry tried to shrug it off. He felt his breath catch when Zabini just smirked in response and Harry belatedly realized how obvious he was being about his crush on Draco. If the prisoners were able to figure it out without seeing Harry and Draco interact, it wouldn’t take much for Draco’s friends to figure it out if Harry kept watching him with lovesick, honeymoon eyes. Still, Harry couldn’t help but feel disappointed when Draco straightened up and they were no longer pressed together.
"Why won't you visit your mother?" Pansy asks.
Later that night, as Potter is making good on his promise of pushing Draco yet again into the delicious abyss between orgasm and unconsciousness, Draco catches himself thinking he wouldn't mind having every single day end up like this.
here!”
“Funny that…”
Harry yawned. He pretty much knew the whole thing by heart now, mainly because he’d been living this day forever and, with Ron gone, there was no one else she could talk to, was there? So he yawned and nodded and ordered, “Two, sorry, one Mocha and a Caramel Macchiato.”
One of his hands on Draco’s hip, pulling him back onto his prick. He feels a shift behind him. The angle changes, the pace speeds up and up. The hand on his hips lifts and comes heavy between his shoulder blades, pinning him in place to take the final few pushes inside him. There’s a cut-off moan. A sigh. Miller stills, and then there is just breathing.
“Azkaban, I know,” Draco breaks in. “But I wasn’t one by choice. You, of all people, should know that.”
fine, for a while.
Draco smiled, letting his eyes fall shut as Harry's fingers ran softly through his hair. He had no idea why Harry had taken to doing this, but it felt absolutely brilliant, even though it did make Draco want him more. He stood no chance there anyway. As far as he knew, Harry wasn't even into blokes.
“No, not yet. I have to pick up Scorpius first,” he says, with a smile. A smile he’s not feeling at all: dropping by Potter’s tends to make him more furious than pleased.
“... silly, nuts, crazy?”
Draco's breath is coming faster. Pansy is still standing near the door, but now she's biting down on her lip, looking back and forth between them as though she's sure they're going to start throwing hexes any minute—and Draco doesn't
“Draco, he can sleep here. It’s not like I’m going to kill him. He’s my son, for Christ’s sake!”
"Draco—"
"Take you on that date, of course. We could go to the cinema. We could even go watch
, Draco thinks, let him complain all he wants. He catches himself hoping, a bit maliciously, Potter chokes on his complaints the same way Draco choked on apologies and sorries for months on end, no one else beside him but Pansy. See, at least Potter is lucky in that too: he has more than one friend standing by him.
"You're always talking and it's very distracting—" Potter says when he pulls back, but that's as far as he gets before Draco drags him back in, forcibly shoving his tongue into Potter's open mouth.
Another drawn out sigh, a tiny sip of tea.
She follows him to the kitchen when he helps Kreacher clear the table—which admittedly Draco only does whenever Harry is around. If he’s off at work, Kreacher can do it by himself, thanks.
The sky is dark on Thursday when he leaves work. There’s a chilly wind outside, blowing into his face in a quite unpleasant way, but at least it’s not strong enough to sneak under his jacket. The air feels a bit soggy, he thinks, as his hands pull the jacket closer to his chest. He reckons it might rain soon—not that
By the time Draco's second work week rolls around, he's pretty much convinced he knows everything there is to know about working with Harry Potter—namely, that working in the same building as Potter is a veritable nightmare, and that this version of Potter quite possibly thinks that Draco is his own personal potions expert.
It's been two days since since Potter sought him out at work, and Draco has been feeling kind of twitchy ever since—but all in all, he thinks he's doing a fairly good job of covering that up.
Draco's fists clench helplessly by his sides. He suddenly feels very, very small. "It's not like that. It's not—" he tries. He can't force out the words. They never make it past his lips, they
There are no tables nearby.
Draco stretches his neck up when Potter's mouth moves down to it, his stomach muscles straining under his skin. Potter moans into his neck, sending warm shivers along Draco's spine, and fumbles impatiently with the buttons on Draco's shirt—but it seems Potter's still not the most patient person Draco has met, eventually deciding to simply tear Draco's shirt apart.
Salazar, that, again. Potter and his bollocksed principles.
None of them could never see it.
Not even Mother.
Miller looks at him like he’s crazy, like he doesn’t see why on Earth Draco wouldn’t want to be tied up, like this is part of his job, this is what he gets paid for, isn’t it? And it’s also his job to be a tiny bit more obliging towards his clients. “Anything else you won’t do?” he enquires. “I’m assuming you do at least take it up the arse. Otherwise, I’m not sure what I paid for here.”
“Potter…” Sadly the worst part of all this is that he’s rather sure Harry knows that, too. He’s just not listening hard enough. “… let go of me.”
He watches through wide, incredulous eyes as the head of Harry's cock disappears rhythmically beneath his fingers. He catches the glint of the first drops of precome, wipes at them with his thumb.
“Right, sure,” she says slowly, both her eyebrows raised in a pointed look. “Only, somehow, you don’t sound too thankful.”
"I told you this would end badly. It'll end with you heartbroken, and, as usual, it'll be up to me to pick up the pieces and put them back together."
situation has him more than a bit stumped. He’s still pondering that, when he hears an ‘ouch’ coming from downstairs.
. But then the next day, Pansy comes home mid-afternoon.
Potter lifts both eyebrows. “What about stout? Guinness?”
Granger nods distractedly. "And what are you up to these days? It's been ages since we last heard from you."
“What about Potter?”
“Merlin, Pans,” he snaps, pushing her off his lap. “It’s not—I don’t do that, all right? I swear some days you are unbearable…”
“You know what’s even harder to believe? That I’m still head over heels for the prat who keeps reading
"That's okay," Potter is saying, "I can wait until you've made your decision."
Draco’s nose crumples in distaste. “Could we talk about this after I’ve finished with breakfa—

He does end up going to St Mungo's, though not exactly by choice.
, somehow.
"God, you're… Just stop doing this to me, all right?" Draco wants to laugh at the sheer amount of desperation in Harry's voice. "Just leave me the fuck alone."
them, even when I had no idea what they were about—because he was funny, I guess, or perhaps because he looked so happy then. I don't know." He takes a deep breath before saying, "And then one day, he was just . . . gone. From one day to the next, he was gone."
mate. And you came back with—” insert accusatory finger pointing at Draco, “—that thing standing over there,” moments.
to him.
“Nothing. He means nothing at all. Evening, Blaise,” Draco greets, and thank Merlin, Morgana and Salazar that at least he’s good at faking smiles, “we were just leaving.” Mostly because he has this awful feeling inside him, that Blaise is going to do something here that he might not like. It just keeps being there, not going away, and it’s driving him mad. “Come on, Harry.”
It doesn't once occur to him that he could be wrong about that.
“No, not really. Not now,” Potter says. “I’m just glad you told me.”
"Oh . . ." Draco hesitates. "Not that long, really. I mean, after eighth year, after—you know."
Today is one of those days. The light coming in through the curtains registers before the brief confusion turns into panic, into shame, sometimes into shame of panicking over memories past long gone, and things he can’t remember anymore. Neither of those emotions is too flattering to go through. But he does know this bedroom. He’s been here before, with Mother.
Draco catches himself mid-gape. “He
He wonders if Draco still notices these things. Time passing by. He used to pay attention to what Harry did, what his schedule was, where he went, with whom…
“You,” Harry whispers in his ear, reaching around him, gentle hands closing the paper to hold him close, “are clearly thinking about something, aren’t you? You’ve got that face, the one you wear when you ponder things like a mad hatter.”
"No, not while you insist on turning your life into a bloody nightmare. It's almost as if you're trying to—"
at all. It’s just insane. “What else could I have done? It’s not that I didn’t trust you, I couldn’t even trust
, and he wants to cry, he wants to die. He doesn’t want Potter to look at him like that: like he’s hateful, pitiable, pathetic.
He'd apologise to Harry on their first day, and Harry would chuckle quietly at him. "You don't need to explain that to me, Draco," he'd say. "I always knew. I know you better than you know yourself."
“He’s not – we’re not... I
“... away. I got this,” Burke was saying to a dementor that had stopped at the open door to Harry’s cell. It hovered on the threshold, neither moving in nor leaving as Burke requested.
“Don’t get sappy on me, Potter,” Draco snorted, but relaxed knowing Harry would allow him to pursue different avenues.
“I have a bad side too,” Draco said into the quiet of the room.
“Stuff?”
“The circumstances-” started Dumbledore but Runecraft cut him off.
“Some place where it’s legal to do soul magic,” Draco answered quickly. He’d have to jump through some hoops for any study that involved children, but it would be possible. He mentally ran through the experts he knew to figure out which country might be the best if he needed help with the data. “Perhaps we can schedule a family trip to Albania, Romania, or Bangladesh? Or if you don’t like those options, there have been a couple of interesting studies that recently came from Mozambique and Latvia... or perhaps Ca-”
“It’s perfect,” he reassured her. Honestly, Ginny could have named their child Voldemort and Harry wouldn’t protest considering.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” Harry said once he’d pulled out his map from his bag.
A warm hug on a sunny morning, Draco would give his world for both to last.
“You really think he’s into me?”
It’s stupid. He already knows what he’s done. It’s not like there’s anything he could have done to prevent it. It has nothing to do with him. Besides, Pansy sees him: she knows he’s not worthless, and that’s something. She would never blame him for what happened, even if she
Of course that's not the end of it for Pansy. "You do realise he's never going to leave her for you, don't you?" she asks him the following day, as she steps through the tinted doors into Draco's workshop.
“Yeah…” Draco tries on a hesitant smile. “I know.” He thinks he does now, he’s never been sure before today. Harry doesn’t talk much, he just does—and fucks up more often than not when the things he does have to do with Draco.
A couple of weeks later, Draco stops halfway through unwrapping his scarf to give the scene before him a moment of puzzled deliberation: Potter, sprawled over his couch like he owns the place—
Draco blinks.
Draco tries to back off, but there's a wall behind him. There's nowhere to go and it's too warm with Potter near him and he hates it, he hates how Potter makes him feel even now. He hates himself for feeling like shit when
.” Potter sighs. “You know, I thought I’d die that day, when I faced Voldemort.”
Harry's eyes narrowed, and he poked his finger into Draco's side. "
“Yes, I know. Because yesterday was Sunday.” Gosh, seriously? How many more times was he going to have to put up with this?
.” Potter shakes his head. “But it’s not the same, not the way I do.”
here, because it’s all changing too fast and he’s not sure he likes where it’s going. Not when it makes his chest ache.
Potter grabs his face and kisses him. For a moment there, Draco is so afraid Potter will think twice and decide this is a terrible idea, that he'll push Draco away like he did before. But Potter just keeps kissing him, making soft noises into his mouth.
Robards' Patronus would wake him in the wee hours of the morning one Thursday. "Auror Potter's partner has been injured," its thready voice would say, "we need you to take his place in the field."
Draco, on the other hand, will probably never forget.
In a rush, Draco shuts his laptop and hides it under the bed. Doesn’t want Potter to see it, wouldn’t like the questions that would come with it. Potter still thinks he’s like he was, explaining to him that Muggles are perhaps higher up the line than he’d once thought might take recognising a few things he’s not too proud of. He stops by the kitchen on his way to the sitting room and grabs a couple of glasses.
Draco buries his face in his pillow, but he can still hear the door slide open and Pansy's nervous steps as she walks closer to his bed. She sits beside him, running a hand through his hair.
Draco never gets invited to Harry's birthday, but he does go to Granger's in their final year. Harry is there as well, of course, but he seems intent on pretending Draco doesn't exist. And that, at least, is nothing new.
Draco watches him, watches the uniform row of houses across the glass, under the sun that burns his eyes.
“Good. Because to me, it doesn’t either. But that,” he emphasises, “that is what he’s going to hear, being my son.”
He refuses to answer her question.
“What?” Draco blurts, arms crossed in front of him. “I am not!”
breakfast. No, it’s turned into more of a late brunch, as most of his days start past midday. Apparently, he’s an ‘escort’ now. A job he absolutely hates, but at the very least he’s not alone. Alongside him is his BFF Pansy, whom he sometimes loves… but most days he truly, madly, deeply loathes and despises.
Draco snorts. "Oh, no. He's brilliant all right." And that's really as much as he plans to say about it—Pansy looks satisfied enough, and she doesn't need to know how Draco's back arched desperately against the mattress as he came down Potter's throat, or how Potter's hands pressed down on his hips hard enough to leave bruises.
Draco wakes up in his own bed, under sheets that don't smell like Harry because Harry has never been there. When he goes back to work on Monday, he gets partnered with Bones. He tries—he
Punishment. Pain.
Potter freezes, hovering above him, but then he exhales slowly and lets himself fall back down. "I was just going to fetch my wand," he says softly. "I'm not going anywhere, I promise. To be honest—" Potter smiles a sad little smile, "—I don't think I ever knew how to forget you either."
about.”
“It will give you one male child, no more,” he recalls Mother saying. “It will go into effect when you are past eighteen, if you ever bond to someone while still childless.” He sees it now, that him being fond of boys never really mattered. At least not to her, not to them. Certainly not to the succession line. He can’t help laughing, a bit on the hysterical side. As long as he finds someone he loves, that ridiculous spell will do all the work needed, regardless of how he feels about it. The dismal bit of all this is he has no clue how he feels about it. Partly glad, partly bitter. Definitely heartbroken. Merlin, what will Potter do when—
. Her,
to, or else he’ll forget what Potter did to him.
He thinks, perhaps, they might be growing in him now.
, and the Fiendfyre Potter saved him from. So he curls away from the light, pulling the blanket back over his shoulders—it’s a bit chilly after all.
, that’s why I asked them not to. Somehow, it never occurred to me that you’d end up—”
How is he feeling indeed.
"You'll leave me alone?" Draco presses. "For real this time?"
“Sure. Fine and dandy. Can’t you see?”
"Well, yeah, I wanted that, at some point. It's just, I'm not so sure anymore—I mean, I don't want following dark wizards to be the rest of my life. I know it's what people expect of me but . . ." Harry opened his mouth and closed it, and then, just when Draco thought he'd given up on whatever else he'd been going to say, opened it again to add, "I don't know. To be honest, I think I've done my bit by now."
Potter simply grinned around his fork before shovelling another bite of tart into his mouth.
Potter seems to have reverted to that thing he used to do a few months back, criticising Draco's brewing skills as if he were just that much better at potion-making. And Draco . . . Draco has just about had it.
Draco waited. He waited until he could no longer take it, and then asked, "Well? You're not going to tell me what it is?"
. Yesterday he cried over a stupid argument with a client. Today, it seems it's going to be Pansy's words that'll push him over the edge, and there's nothing he can do about it. It's so ludicrous he almost wants to laugh at himself, only then Pansy will be certain he's finally gone round the bend. "I'm just . . . I'm really, really tired. I can't—could we just do this some other time?"
“Well, yes, but the steps themselves are well, they’re-”
“And yet, you threw in someone like Stan Shunpike into Azkaban without the same curtesy,” Harry pointed out the minister’s hypocrisy.
“Ah,” was Hale’s response and he stopped frowning at their audience. He carefully tucked away Harry’s memories and the written statements. He handed Harry the two forms he’d mentioned and waved a third scroll of parchment in the direction of the castle.
,” Harry attempted to imitate Draco on those last few lines. He internally cringed immediately after and hoped Draco didn’t take it as an insult. Harry was temporarily relieved when Draco offered a small smile, but it faded quickly. Harry wanted to say something as Draco looked so sad, but he didn’t know what would make it better. Everyone knew exactly how bleak Azkaban was. The little bits of comfort to be found would seem small outside of the prison. An uncomfortable silence fell upon them.
“And what exactly am I supposed to do until
“Some, maybe,” Harry conceded because he knew better than any of them what muggles who feared wizards were capable of. Harry was pretty sure that the Dursleys were unhappy they couldn’t pawn Harry off on a priest and be done with him. “But there are many more that are decent people,” he insisted. Hermione’s parents would never just stand by if someone tried to burn or drown her just for being a witch.
the next time they brought up the dark arts.
Harry easily recognized bread and the hardboiled egg, but there was a slab of something Harry assumed was some sort of meat but he couldn’t tell which kind. Harry was just experimentally poking at a few sketchy items mixed in the portion of beans, when the guards started making noise again.
“It’s not an unforgivable curse, but the ministry will want to make an example of them. They take break-ins very seriously,” continued Burke.
“What?” Harry asked in surprise.
In the morning, the other prisoners remarked that they had a good night’s sleep. After some speculation, Nott realized it was because the dementors hadn’t done their nightly patrol. While the other prisoners celebrated the reprieve, Harry couldn’t help but worry about it. After their initial interest in him, it probably wouldn’t bode well if they had decided to start avoiding him.
“Burke once broke Mulciber’s nose,” added Crabbe, “and he didn’t heal it for three days.”
“He is,” confirmed Lucius.
“Is it because they’re muggles? We won’t judge you if you love the muggles that raised you,” Lestrange offered.
Rodolphus Lestrange taught him a spell that mimicked birthing contractions in its victim. Harry was glad that the man couldn’t demonstrate the effects of the spell as Harry wasn’t sure he’d be safe if the man was able to properly teach him.
“I’m not sure yet, but if you have your soul, then clearly James isn’t carrying it around,” Draco said.
“Albert is still injured as well,” Harry added.
“I can try,” he whispered.
“I know it’s not a weakness to need a mind healer, but I don’t,” Harry asserted again.
“I know this will be uncomfortable for you, but I need to take pictures of all your injuries,” Hale said. He started off easy by focusing on the injuries on Harry’s face. But soon after he asked Harry to remove his shirt and trousers so that he could document the full scope of the injuries. Hale worked efficiently so that Harry did not feel exposed for long. Despite knowing it would help his case, Harry wanted to burn the photographs before anyone could see them. Luckily his accidental magic did not spill out and follow through with that wish.
“May I see?” asked Lestrange. Harry passed the photo to the man and waited for his criticism.
“Potter, sit,” Burke said.
plane of existence was really called. He wanted to be able to see Ginny again. He wanted to spend eternity with Draco, who was surely bound for there when he died. Harry doubted he was any more worthy of it than he was worthy of Draco’s love, but he’d take it if it was given to him. And if the best he could hope for was an eternity sitting on a bench with Voldemort’s baby soul piece in the in-between, then he’d work on building enough good memories to make up for the lack of true peace. He’d horde memories of Draco to keep him sane. Starting tomorrow, he’d treat James as his son and only his son. He’d show Draco the love he can offer their children should he trust Harry with giving him more. And some day,
“You’re Burke’s lapdog now?” Nott butted in as he scrubbed at his armpit. It was hardly a threatening stance, but it gave Jugson reason to pause. He looked between the two men on either side of Harry as it became clear that anyone who wanted to mess with Harry would have to go through them first.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, somewhat hysterically. He was not reassured when Burke merely smirked at him and charmed his shirt to remain in place.
“It was only after hearing stories like... after hearing how a muggle hurt someone magical that Albert would speak poorly of muggles. At least to me,” Harry said to further encourage them away from Harry’s mortification.
“Why are you- oh. Harry, what happened with Ginny won’t happen to us,” Draco tried to reassure.
“Three days?!” Harry exclaimed. Even the Dursleys hadn’t made him wait that long.
It was so hard to write that last part; I hated having to put Harry through that :(
,” Harry insisted. “If you knew, you’d tell me it wasn’t good.”
In big bold letters, the Daily Prophet announced: ALBERT NOTT ACQUITTED OF ALL DEATH EATER CHARGES.
“Wait,” someone called. Harry only stopped because he recognized it as Draco’s voice. Harry turned around but didn’t move any closer.
“What else did he teach you?” Hermione asked, and Harry hoped that his inner turmoil hadn’t been broadcasting on his face.
“No,” Lucius said for Harry. “As incredible as it sounds, Harry kissed Burke the way a dementor would.”
“There’s nothing you can do about it now,” Lucius said as he noticed how worried Harry was.
“Not Ginny. Me. I did this, only me,” Harry said firmly. Ginny bore no blame for this mess.
Harry had no delusions about his own fatherly skills. He tried. The last thing he wanted was to be anything close to the Dursleys, so he vowed to give James a better childhood than he had. Still, he couldn’t look at James without being reminded of what he’d done. Consequently, he couldn’t provide the easy affection that the rest of the family gave. He let them pick up his slack and prayed it was enough for James.
“Everyone needs a break, Potter,” Draco said and rolled his eyes at Harry’s dramatics.
The door at the end of the hall opened a second time, but Harry was busy poking at the mystery meat, so he didn’t register the significance until Burke leaned against the bars of his cell and spoke.
“Harry...” Draco sounded sad instead of disgusted, but Harry found he didn’t like that either. He didn’t want to make Draco sad.
“Who is?” Harry asked, just to be sure. Not that there were many possibilities of who they could be talking about. Harry didn’t have a large circle of friends and acquaintances.
“And now Snape is trying to get a mind healer to say I’m unfit for school,” Harry grumbled.
“I’m not making you a friendship bracelet... but, yeah,” Draco said, and shrugged. There was a slight rosy tint to his cheeks.
Harry counted four guards. They were all watching the prisoners carefully, wands at the ready. As Harry neared the end of the hallway, he noticed a couple of dementors near by. They were prevented from reaching the prisoners due to Wiblin’s Patronus. Harry deducted that the presence of the dementors was what prevented the prisoners from attempting to overpower the guards with their higher numbers.
“Harry, what did you do?” she asked him with wide eyes. He glanced down at the paper she’d been reading expecting another article on the Dursleys, or perhaps something radical from Lance.
It was more awkward to support Albert once they were all naked. Harry and Lucius bracketed Albert and allowed him to set the pace. This unfortunately meant that Harry couldn’t use his hands to cover his privates while he walked. And since everyone was curious about Albert’s injuries, everyone was watching them. Despite this, Harry was willing to sacrifice his dignity to help Albert.
“But why wouldn’t he?” pressed Runecraft.
“Compensation?” asked Runecraft snidely. “He just got away with an unforgivable, and you suggest we further reward him?”
judicial-wizard: lawyer. I figure if they use the term medi-witch/wizard for nurses then they might have a different name for lawyers as well.
A small foot tapped the side of his palm, and lightly jostled the remains of the ring. Harry slowly turned horrified eyes to the baby still in his arms. His eyesight blurred as the full horror of what he’d done dawned on him.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione whispered. Harry shifted uncomfortably. He wished he hadn’t said anything in the awkward pause that followed.
“It’s rare but not unheard of,” stated a voice Harry thought belonged to Walden McNair.
“Of course I’m sure!” Harry hissed and wondered what the man was trying to accomplish. “She did it in front of me! Weren’t you there?”
“Yeah,” he worried.
Harry decided that Crabbe’s plant ought not to move while it was in its mini size given that drew attention to the figure when the purpose of shrinking them was to easily hide the objects. The password Harry selected for Crabbe was “Hyacinth”. Once it reached its full size, the life cycle of the plant would start automatically. If the password was said a second time, it paused the animation before shrinking the plant.
Harry panted into the rough thin sheets, eyes still pressed tightly together. He didn’t want to open them to amused Death Eaters. Taking a few deep breaths, Harry braced himself to be taunted before he sat up and opened his eyes.
“Potts, ain’t you a sight for sore eyes,” Mulciber greeted.
“So, I have something to compare mine to,” Harry realized.
Eventually they moved into Harry’s sight. There were two other guards with them, though Harry didn’t let himself relax since one of them was Wiblin. But it was Albert’s appearance that caused him more grief than either of his two least favourite guards.
“Bloody hell. He’s a natural,” Mulciber laughed breaking the sudden silence. “You know, under different circumstances, Rodolphus, you might have just had a new apprentice on your hands.”
“Those would be hard to maintain under the circumstances,” Albert pointed out. Harry felt willing to try as it occurred to him that they would have a hard time explaining Albert’s sudden lack of injuries to the guards.
“I still made choices. Choices that hurt someone,” Draco said. Harry wanted to insist that Draco wouldn’t have done it if his family wasn’t in danger. But he knew Draco would still feel bad about every spell. Mostly because if given the same horrible choice now, he’d still choose to keep his family safe at the expense of another.
“Why were you out after curfew?” Nott asked as he took pity on Harry’s flustered appearance.
“Get up, Lestrange, or I’ll take it to mean you’re not hungry,” said one of the guards. Harry’s eyes widened as he realized the guard was speaking to the man in the other cell next to Harry. He didn’t know which brother was there, but either one was bad.
“Oh, well that’s disappointing,” continued the voice. Ignoring the ‘shut up’ that was hissed from Lestrange’s cell, the voice continued. “Crucio then?”
“You should get some sleep,” suggested Albert. Harry didn’t think he could sleep, but nodded at Albert’s suggestion all the same. He knew they were tired, but got the impression that they would stay up with him if Harry refused to sleep. Harry extinguished the conjured light, returned his wall to its original state, and reluctantly made his was to bed. It was hard to lay down in the same spot Burke had pinned him to only an hour ago.
“Thanks,” he said and sat down next to Draco. He wanted to make a quick escape, but knowing his first stop would have to be the Weasleys to pick up his son had him agreeing to the acceptable delay.
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he tried to recall what Riddle had told him in the chamber. Lestrange asked a few other questions about Riddle’s abilities. Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t tell them much. He hadn’t asked Ginny too many questions as he worried it was too painful for her to relive. He regretted that now. He shared what he had felt when writing in the diary and when he was pulled into a memory by the horcrux. It wasn’t much information, but it gave Lestrange a few things to mull over as he considered the theory behind how horcruxes work.
“My tattoo... another guard helped him do it. And they helped him take Albert away so he could beat him up,” Harry said.
“I miss him too,” Draco said softly, but managed to keep his voice steady. “He... spoke about you too... in his letters,” Draco added.
“Son?” he parroted faintly. He felt like he was dreaming. Just moments ago he’d been walking to his death. How was it possible to go from that to waking up in St-Mungo’s with the news he was a father. It was crazy; impossible... except, Harry recalled the last time he had seen Ginny. It wasn’t
Harry had double transfiguration with McGonagall first. During the practical portion of her lesson, she spoke to Harry about catching up on the work he’d missed.
Before Harry could respond, he heard a surprised “Neville?”. Harry’s heart stuttered. He feared that the ministry had decided to arrest Neville after all. He looked around the room in panic, but instead of seeing his fellow Gryffindor, Harry spotted Stan Shunpike. The man had paused in the middle of getting dressed to stare at Harry in shock.
“What?” Harry asked.
Burke paused but Harry kept quiet. He didn’t know how to respond and he hoped that if he ignored Burke, the man would move on. Unfortunately Burke was not willing to let it go.
“That matter has also been dealt with,” stated Dumbledore, cutting Harry off before he could get himself into too much trouble.
“Albus, we will also need to question Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Ronald Weasley, and Ginevra Weasley about their involvement in the ministry break-in,” Runecraft stated clearly.
Draco spent the next fortnight writing down his observations on Harry’s projected soul. Occasionally he would cast a spell on Harry and see if it reflected anything in his soul’s projection. Harry didn’t understand most of it, but he did help Draco detect strange aspects. The most notable one was a weird void near the top. At first it looked like another scar, but Harry noted that none of the light strands were making the jump from one healthy spot to the next. It was a real blank spot.
“Potter is hiding something. How do we know that Burke actually assaulted him? Mr. Hale, you filled out forms to collect a memory of this event, but none were submitted,” Runecraft stated.
Next to him, McGonagall scoffed. Harry was certain she had already figured out what angle Hale was setting up. Harry thought the man was mostly successful. He didn’t get much out of the first ministry worker, but the second one became flustered at Hale’s questions. Hawkworth had tried to dismiss him early, but Hale pressed on until the man covered everything Hale wanted him to.
He left the stand after that. He felt everyone’s eyes on him as he returned to McGonagall’s side. He was uncomfortable with the attention. Harry regretted revealing so much, but he also knew he'd do it again for Albert.
“Well, the others followed Bellatrix’s orders… but they also respected what Lucius said…” Harry said hesitantly as he didn’t know which scenario helped Hale more.
“Yeah,” Ron said nervously. “I know you don’t like talking about it, but we hoped it would help your case or at least get the bitch fired.”
“Watch it,” Harry warned. He could not pretend to be unaffected if the man tried to sully the name of his parents. Unfortunately, Burke caught on to this.
Burke glanced back towards the showers. There weren’t that many prisoners left given that the water was rather cold by now. Jugson still seemed to be in the shower area.
“Where is Mr. Longbottom, Miss Lovegood, and Miss Weasley?” Runecraft asked. The professors raised new protests, especially when they noticed how tightly Bole was holding on to Hermione’s arm. Neville had stood up on his own and was making his way towards the aurors. Harry wasn’t sure where Luna and Ginny were. He didn’t have time to look around either as one of the aurors nodded to Perkins and the man started leading Harry out of the great hall.
grateful, but it also makes it even more obvious how I’m... lacking. Hell, James is more likely to go to
“Don’t tell me they arrested
Harry paused as the truth of that sunk in. He wasn’t bleeding. In fact, aside from the overwhelming feeling of having an extra soul taking up residence in him, he felt fine. Harry brought his hand to where Burke had bit him, but when he pressed down, there was no pain. He also felt smooth skin when he ran his tongue along his lips.
I wasn’t going to do the whole occlumency thing because I was worried it would be too cliché. But honestly how could they not suggested it given all the secrets they have? Still, this is one area where Harry is not immediately OP/BAMF. Occlumency relies on skill, not power. Harry is still too emotional to be able to master it.
“Wasn’t your fault,” Albert groaned. Harry was surprised the man could read the guilt on Harry’s countenance, given the swelling around his eyes.
“That’s bullshit!” exclaimed Harry.
“When my husband died, well, I found it to be a difficult adjustment. I tried a few sessions with a mind healer. However, talking openly about myself is not something that comes naturally for me. You may find the same to be true for you,” McGonagall realized that while she had always considered herself to be a private person, Harry was used to keeping his secrets for a different reason. Still, it may end with the same result when it came to mind healers. “After a few sessions, I decided it wasn’t for me and found another way to deal with my grief. There isn’t one straightforward way to heal. I just hope you don’t discount it simply because Severus was the one to suggest it,” McGonagall said.
While Hale waited for Harry to gather his thoughts (and courage), he rolled up his sleeves. It temporarily distracted Harry as something about the action registered as wrong to him. It wasn’t until he shivered, that Harry realized Azkaban was too cold for Hale to have done so because he was warm. Harry frowned at the man’s arms. It took him a moment to realize what was bothering him was the fact that there was no tattoo. He had become used to seeing dark marks on the arms of everyone around him, that an unmarked arm registered as odd to him now. Harry felt bad for assuming Hale was a death eater simply because he represented so many of them. This was Hale’s way of assuring Harry that he wasn’t directly answering to the man that wanted to kill Harry. It didn’t mean that he wouldn’t indirectly support Voldemort’s agenda, but Harry did feel better knowing the man wasn’t a death eater.
A sniffling sound had him turning to look at his side, and was heartbroken at seeing Mrs. Weasley dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. His own eyes filled with tears in response. “I’m sorry,” he croaked. It was aimed at Mrs. Weasley, but he owed it to every Weasley gathered in the room.
“There isn’t really that much time left in the school year. I don’t want to fall behind if I take even more time, er, away,” Harry stated and hoped that appealed to the professors. McGonagall looked as if she agreed, but Snape looked unhappy. Of course, Snape was the perfect example of ‘Resting Bitch Face’. No surprise there.
“He needs a few minutes alone,” Harry said.
Harry was grateful that McGonagall wanted to see him after classes, as it gave him an excuse to avoid everyone without looking like he was running away. He wasn’t particularly proud of it, but he knew he was hiding away from them. He feared what new rumours would circulate about their Defense class. He knew even more intrusive questions were in his future.
“So...”
“Not under these circumstances,” Hermione defended, “... though, I suppose that is a silver lining of sorts.”
“Well, I am quite gifted in charms and transfiguration,” boasted Malfoy. It was the first instance where the man lived up to the mental image Harry carried of the arrogant Malfoy family. It surprised Harry that he didn’t mind the bragging as much as he once would have.
“I know,” Harry said, and he did. He knew everyone wouldn’t give him an indefinite pass on being a miserable sod. He just didn’t know how to go about it when his family was a constant reminder of what he’d cost them. He had to get his shit together somehow. Fortunately, he felt a bit lighter after unloading on Draco. “If it makes you feel better, I drunk-sobbed all over Malfoy last night.”
“No, I’m fine,” Harry said. He suspected Dumbledore knew it was a lie, but he didn’t press. There wasn’t anything Pomphrey could help with anyway.
Fighting back tears, Harry slowly made his way down his body leaving the appearance of hand shaped bruises and a few scratches. The deep bite mark looked particularly harsh. Harry didn’t know when he had healed himself, so he wasn’t sure if his illusions matched up to what the guards saw. He’d just hope that they hadn’t looked at him too closely.
“You appear less... bright,” Asherath explained. “You are still brighter than the rest, but the newest soul is fading. It is not as bright as last I saw you.”
“He deserves better,” Harry admitted softly.
“Can we just go?” Harry asked. Everything about the situation made him uncomfortable. The food was good, but felt too heavy after weeks of Azkaban’s standard meal. Having Ron and Hermione glued to his sides was a double-edged sword. It was comforting to have their support, but simultaneously unpleasant to have them so physically close after weeks of minimal human contact. And it was
“Good, good. This will save us some time searching for you. Auror Bole has some questions for you about your involvement in the ministry break-in last June,” Runecraft stated. The auror on the far left turned his attention on Hermione. He didn’t look as reluctant to be there as Auror Perkins did.
“What? Why would Ginny put your horcrux in a new vessel, her son no less, when you weren’t even dead?” Draco asked.
Harry reluctantly parted ways with Draco, but not before Draco offered to help set up any meetings Harry might want with the prisoners. As Harry made his way to the Gryffindor table, he wondered what would happen if he asked Draco to use the mirror. Would Draco meet him in that classroom alone? Or perhaps he’d sneak Harry into his dorm room.
Harry struggled with selecting a gift for Albert as well, much to his surprise. He felt close to the man given their daily interactions, but Albert kept a lot of his personal life private. Harry created an enchanted razor as he knew the man didn’t like asking the guards to remove his stubble. Yet, Harry felt this gift wasn’t enough. It didn’t convey the gratitude he felt for everything the man had done for him. Harry wanted to create something personal, but had few personal details to draw inspiration from. He knew the man was a widower with a son Harry’s age. The man’s animagus form was a porcupine. His wife’s form had been a sparrow. Harry wanted to incorporate an etching of a sparrow in whatever he created, but found he had trouble picturing a sparrow clear enough for the spell to work. Much like the static pictures he had created before, Harry needed several attempts before he was satisfied with the results. In the end, there were only three stone blocks with sparrow engravings that Harry ended up being satisfied with. Harry created three more stone blocks and added a porcupine engraving to each. He found this easier given he had seen the Albert’s animagus form recently. He arranged the blocks to form a box. He fused together the bottom and side blocks but charmed the top block to slide back and forth. On a whim, Harry charmed the inside of the box to give off a soft glow.
“The professors will understand that,” Ron pointed out.
Harry was still uncomfortable discussing his crush, but was worried that if he didn’t distract Lucius the man would insist they go back to sex spells. “He’s smart,” Harry admitted. When Lucius raised his eyebrow, he felt the need to elaborate. “Like, not just book smart. I mean… well, in fourth year he animated these badges. They said ‘Potter stinks’ so it was pretty insulting, but it was impressive all the same. I wouldn’t have been able to do that,” he said. If Harry hadn’t been tutored by these men, he probably still wouldn’t be able to create those badges. As soon as Harry realized he got his new skill set from them, it also occurred to him that they might not be as impressed as Harry was with the badges. “It’s not just that he’s smart, I guess. It’s that he’s creative too. He doesn’t just regurgitate spells. He finds ways to use them in different situations,” Harry concluded.
Harry had been content to leave it there. Happy to take whatever time Draco gave him, and not be selfish to ask for more. He honestly had not intended to progress into a romantic relationship, but somehow fell into it anyway.
“Don’t be shy, Potter,” Burke called out from his spot at the door. When Harry looked back at the man, he noticed Burke’s wand and eyes were squarely on Harry. “If you dally here, there won’t be any hot water left.”
was, so James should be OK. Right?” Harry babbled.
“I don’t do enough. I know I could be better if I wasn’t so... ashamed, I guess. I’m trying to give him the life Ginny would have wanted for him,” Harry knew Ginny would have given James a great childhood. Harry would never know if she realized the child was carrying his soul, but even if she had, Harry knew she would still want the best for him. He didn’t doubt that she’d loved him, even if Harry was clearly unworthy of that love and trust.
Harry grabbed a book to lookup a spell and jostled the pamphlets Hermione had given him. One fell to the floor. Harry was about to toss it back with the others but stopped when he noticed its subject. This one was about the difficulties many prisoners face once they were released. Harry thought it might be muggle in origin, but many points likely applied to wizards as well. After he read through it, he realized he had not asked Hermione to help him develop a plan to get some positive changes for the prisoners in Azkaban.
During his turn to teach Harry something, Crabbe decided to combine herbology and potions. Crabbe told him about a flower that on its own is benign, but if fertilized by unicorn dung, it glowed and could be used in potions. After describing the flower, Crabbe transitioned into potion lesson. Rather than describe a particular potion, he talked about the effects that flower’s stem and petals might have on potions. This led to Macnair jumping in to talk about unicorns and their properties.  While Harry had covered unicorns already, this review helped him make the links between classes.
