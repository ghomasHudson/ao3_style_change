Draco turned around again to join the others in the Great Hall when he felt the soft touch of a hand upon his elbow. He knew immediately to whom it belonged, and the soft voice that followed as well. 'Draco,' Harry said. It was almost a whisper, so silent the boy had pronounced his name.
Of course Harry hadn't been able to keep himself quiet after that comment. How could Kingsley forget about Malfoy that easily? He didn't do anything wrong, expect for maybe making a few bad decisions. And even if he
Cedric seemed frozen to the ground as his eyes weren't searching like Harry's but staring at something behind the boy's back. Hesitant and even afraid, Harry turned around to stare into the rat-like face of Peter Pettigrew; a man he knew all too well. Anger boiled up inside of him as Pettigrew dared to smirk, drew his wand and pointed it in Cedric's direction. And Harry wasn't able to save Cedric again; the spare got killed by Voldemort's orders. A single flash of green and he was gone, his soul leaving his body and his eyes turning the same porcelain haze he had seen on Krum before. The only difference was that Cedric wasn't possessed; he was
'Don't steal my word, Harry,' was Draco's comment on it as he tried to hide his once again blushing cheeks. 'And I am most certainly not.
Draco placed his hand on the green locket at the mention of it, took a step backwards but didn't lose eye-contact with Harry. 'He's indeed not quite acting like himself,' Hermione replied.
Another sigh from the Healer followed. Harry started to wonder wether the Healer was incapable of speaking when he opened his mouth; 'We have tried every test possible, did research from morning to another… Besides from a few similar curses and potions there aren't any clues to what was cast upon this man. We have researched every inch of his body to only conclude that it is a complete mystery. Don't even know how his teeth grew to their current sharp state…'
Letting out a sneer at the sight of the cup, Draco places it down on his desk. He needs to think about all the things Potter said for a second. Dropping himself down on the chair by his desk, he rereads the letter.
Harry listened to his words with his eyes still focused upon the mermaid. 'And what does that have to do with the second task?'
His mother shrugs, lifting her shoulders ever so slightly. “I thought it suited you rather well.’ Then she let out a sigh. 'Better than the Eagle Owl every did, at least.”
Taking in his strong facial features and posture, he found his heart skip for a third time that very day. It wasn't the same as when he had seen the boy's green eyes, though. Those eyes were mesmerizing compared to Krum's dull browns.
Draco nodded as a reply, brushed through his hair with his golden comb. It had grown ever since his difindo, but he had kept it at a length just under his ears. He liked the way it softly waved; something he hadn't noticed as it had always fallen down as straight as straight could be before. 'You shouldn't worry yourself too much about our guests —
You're waking up all the girls!' Draco gave him a vile look. His heart was racing again because of Raphael's loud voice. He didn't want any of the girls to hear their conversation.
'Harry,' Draco replied, the right side of his mouth slightly lifting upwards — as if he wanted to smile but keep a straight face as well for the monster next to his lover. Wearing one of his many hats and dressed in well-fitted trousers in pale blue shades again, he couldn't have been a bigger contrast to the elder Wizards in the room whom seemed to be dressed in ancient Wizarding robes. Harry himself looked disheveled in his school robes and couldn't help but find it truly wonderful how Draco always dressed so well — even when coming into battle.
The days at Grimmauld Place went by too fast and the new school year was coming closer and closer. Harry knew he had to say goodbye again to Draco, had to miss him for Merlin knew how long. At least, if he was allowed to go to Hogwarts again; he still had to go on and defend himself at the Wizengamot. How on earth was he going to do that?
“If you don’t want to, you—,” Potter tries, but the question has already been asked, and Draco’s unwilling to let the pair handcuff him for disobeying an Auror’s order.
With a single flick of her wand, Molly's presents flew over everyone's head and landed in front of their new owners without a sound. Eagerly wanting to open their presents, the Weasley children stared up at their mother, waiting for a sign. As soon as Molly nodded her head, wrapping paper got torn and flew through the air, landing on the ground, table and even Draco's shoulder. Colorful jumpers appeared with personalized designs and everyone immediately pulled them on over their clothes, showed them off to the person next to them. Harry got one with golden snitches in a blue color; almost as if the snitches were flying in a sky made out of wool. Arthur was the only one to receive a scarf instead of a jumper, and Molly wrapped it around his neck with much delicacy before kissing her husband on the head.
He watched her swallow and cross her arms over one another. 'It's not entirely the same though; I'm not helping Krum,' was her answer.
' Madame said, not even looking up from her writing. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Madame interrupted him by lifting her finger. 'And I don't mean you, Draco.' She finally lifted her head, a soft smile lingering upon her lips as she looked in Harry's direction. '
The boy turned his head to Draco now, his raven hair blowing out of his face and exposing his lightning-bolt shaped scar in its full glory. 'It's nothing you should worry about.'
A wooden desk pushed against a window was loaded with letters, their ribbons and waxed crests scattered in between them. Every one of them started with 'my beloved James'; all were from Draco. He had received many letters from his French angel, but non of his friends; and it worried him.
'I'll do it,' she said, placing the cup on the tree trunk and picking up the sword again. 'It doesn't seem as evil as the locket.'
,' he whispered before Madame's door unlocked in front of their eyes; access to the boys granted. Her door was locked in a truly magical way; locks from floor to ceiling shaped in those of tiny stars graced her door and turned in various directions before they clicked into place and lit up as a starry night sky— and as they all glowed a pure white light, the door swung aside to let the one who knocked inside.
That same night, already way past midnight, Draco was stirred awake by Harry — a big smile still gracing his face as he held up a little vial in his hand, a white light glowing from it. 'I got it!' he nearly shouted. Draco, Hermione and Ron had been waiting for hours on end in the common room — worried wether something would happen to Harry or not. When he still hadn't returned around eleven, they had all gone to bed with a little heart. It had been hard for Draco to fall asleep, and it felt like he had just closed his eyes when he had to open them again for Harry.
.' A weird gleam was visible in Voldemort's eyes, one Draco caught as dared to glance at the monster. 'There is a way, however, in which he can right his wrongs.' Voldemort rose from his seat at the head of the table, slowly sauntered behind everyone's chair before coming to a halt by Draco's. A pale, near-blue hand reached itself out forwards— placing a locket the color of the death-spell on the surface in front of Draco's eyes. 'This, my boy, you will protect with your life.'
Hermione shook her head in disagreement. 'I bet Honeydukes is closed — just like all the other shops. There is no way we'll be able to get in.'
insisted on finding out where Dobby went — what exactly had happened. Of course he hadn't been very pleased when finding out he had been set free, and was working at the Hogwarts' kitchen like a true employee!'
Dumbledore sighed again, this time very much audible and patted Draco's shoulder. 'I agree with that fact, Draco. It will only be alright once he is defeated, but do know that you are not fighting this battle alone. Harry is a greater pion in this game than you may think… and so are a lot of others. You will have to believe that there is another way; that you're not alone. And when it comes to sides; I know that you will always be on ours, Draco; no matter what task Riddle gives you.'
?' Fleur's words were a relief but the tension between Madame and him still hung above their heads. He felt her eyes shift from his face to his jumper and back, judging without truly doing so. Unreadable, the woman was.
'I wasn't done with it yet!' Draco sneered at her, picking up the comb but handing it to Fleur anyway.
Thank you so much for the lovely comments on my first chapter and all the kudos! It really made me excited to already write a second chapter today. A third might be up as well at the end of this week but we'll see!
The boy frowned, but hidden behind his green eyes there was also the slightest glimpse of hope visible. ‘So, what you’re trying to say is that you
'There is someone that does need the cure to this curse, you know. That Unspeakable was lying to you,' he then said.
'Would there perhaps be a way out through your vault?' Ron speculated, but Draco had no idea for he had only visited the family's vault once when he was a child. On the same day he had visited Bellatrix' vault. Another place where toys had greeted him — toys he hadn't been able to play with.
Draco's own heart beat faster than usual again; but this time it was because of his rage. He always had been able to maintain his anger quite well but ever since he met the boy from the tales, it felt like he had become more emotional. Harry was truly changing many things inside of Draco and the blond didn't know wether he liked it or not. He liked how his heart skipped a beat whenever he saw the boy and how he blushed when Harry said nice words to him — but he didn't like that it also made him defensive, as if he needed to protect Harry.
Believing his words and too busy with managing a team, Harry nodded to his words and shouted some more words in Ginny's direction. He then finally gave all his attention to Draco and looked him straight in the eyes. 'Something's different,' he noticed. 'As if you're
A wax seal on the owl's small package told him otherwise — it was a gift from his mother. With a sigh, Draco gave his barn owl a piece of his toast and saw how the creature flapped her wings and flew away with some of the other owls. 'Do you know from who it is?' Harry asked, eyes glancing at the small package with curiosity.
Without hesitation, Ron immediately sat himself down on one of the chairs and shoved a piece of bread into his mouth — his cheeks immediately bulging like that of a hamster. 'Thank you,' Hermione said to the man, seating herself as well and taking a slice of her own. Harry glanced at Draco, questioning wether he should eat some of the bread as well. Draco shrugged, sat himself down next to the others but didn't touch any of the food at all.
‘However, if you do decide to turn around again, you might want to check what I’m leaving behind—,’ he took a little box from his robes’ pocket, placed it on the small table next to the door ,’—right here.’ A feeling of nervosity sank from his heart to his shoes, and without waiting a moment longer, he opened the door and slipped away.
The other boy followed and seated himself next him; pulled out a stroll of parchment with scribbles and drawings to hold in front of Dumbledore's eyes. 'See; I've been studying them for a while now and I must admit they can indeed be inventive but listen—'
Bolting of their chairs, they clustered themselves around Draco's figure. "Who is it? Where does he live? Are you sure it's a
didn't I just say so?' Draco took a broom himself, acting so naturally as if he had been practicing over the summer. It filled Harry's heart with joy to see that the thing he once feared so much had now become one of his greatest pleasures. 'Just follow me,
Everyone grew quiet as their eyes got pointed at Draco again — curious to know the answer to the question. 'Well, the Dark—
'Well, he seemed kind of in a hurry. Also quite anxious about something, not sure.' Ron then glanced over at the pier and took a look on his watch. 'But we really have to go now, Harry.'
A smirk appeared on Draco's face as he realized what was bothering the poor boy. ‘Before you ask silly questions that will turn your head the color of
as one of the most useful spells in duels when the door to his classroom swung open and banged against the door. Everyone’s head turned to see a shocked blond man stand in its opening. Draco was wearing a brighter smile then ever, his blue robes put on in a hurry and his hair just as big of a mess as Harry’s always was. ‘Draco?’ Harry gave him a confused look, but the blond didn’t even seem to hear him.
,' Draco responded. He went up the stairs himself, taking in the specks of rain the girls had left behind on each step. Hands clutched around his dressing gown, he pulled the fabric close to his chest. As he reached the top of the staircase, he gave the boy another curious glance before turning himself in the opposite direction.
Malfoy's eyes find Harry's again but their expression is blank with maybe a hint of confusion. Harry must admit he's quite confused about his move as well. Is it to reassure Malfoy? Maybe it is. Or maybe it's just because he doesn't want him to leave; to be alone in this. It feels like his hand is burning a hole through Malfoy's cold, pale skin and slowly he decides to loosen his grip and take the man's hand instead. To his surprise, Malfoy's palm feels warm and
'Is alright,' Ron told him. 'But are you?' Draco waved his words away again. Of course he wasn't alright, but how could he tell Ron that? Not saying another word, Draco returned the way he came, leaving Ron behind feeling a bit confused.
'I didn't tell you to leave,' he started. 'Just — get some sleep as well. Looks like you could use it.' The other boy indeed had dark circles from a lack of sleep around his eyes; his blond shoulder-length hair a greasy mess and clothes put on in a hurry. The strangest thing about him, though, was the fact that one of his eyes was as white as snow; something Draco had never seen before.
Perhaps ten years ago those words would've driven Harry mad, would've made him protest — but he'd been banned from the table already too many times to complain about it. "Oh
'Yes, I could,' Dumbledore admitted. 'I should've known once he started dreaming about Wizarding superiority.' A silence of a few seconds fell between the two as Draco thought about everything he knew about Grindelwald, but then Dumbledore started talking again. 'But I must admit Harry and you aren't like Gellert and I. You are more alike yet you are both on a different side.'
The weeks before the first task of the Tournament were filled with hate and despise; everybody gave Harry the most vile looks and the poor boy seemed more and more deserted by the day. Already the day after the Champion selection, everybody had turned their back on the boy. Fellow students were angry because they also had wanted a chance to participate, the yellow scarfed students were angry because he was taking away the spotlight from their Cedric Diggory and the foreign students were furious because their school only had one Champion while Hogwarts had two. Draco found it unfair as well, but he didn't place the fault at Harry; he believed that Harry genuinely didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire — but was it then that did?
'Find him,' Harry told Kreacher and watched how the house-elf diapparated; to where, he had no idea, but he hoped he would be able to find the thief.
Draco blinked a few times with his eyes, but didn’t seem quite surprised by those words at all. And Harry on his part wasn’t surprised by that — if this boy had spent over sixteen years observing his life, he should know how things went on by now. “I’ll handle it,” Draco then said, not waiting for a reply and opening the hatch, pushing down the ladder.
The others stopped eating; a bit startled by Draco's question. Come on, it wasn't as if he had offended the man or anything, had he? The man didn't think so either, as he sat himself down on the remaining chair, and answered him. 'Aberforth Dumbledore, is the name. And yes; I am Albus his brother,' he added at seeing the shocked eyes of Ron.
'Let's go to my office, Draco. I believe it is better if I show you,' the headmaster then told him, gesturing with his hand for the blond to follow.
'Then where were you guys all day?' Hermione had her arms crossed and still tried desperately to make eye-contact with Harry.
‘And then he met this man, a certain Tom Riddle. Everything went downhill from there but in his eyes he was a
A bright blue light had shone their way as he and Cedric faced a dead end of the maze; the Triwizard Cup at its end. And they had played it fair by taking off, reaching out their hands and taking ahold of the Cup at the same time.
Uncertain of what to do, Harry looked at Draco's face. He still held the same peaceful expression upon his handsome face and it reassured Harry somehow that everything would be fine; something the boy had said to him so often. He then caught the movement of something dark in the corner of his left eye and shortly after saw a human body with the head of a shark appear; Krum. His failed transfiguration was quite gruesome to look at but at least he had reached the village; ready to save Hermione. He freed her in a matter of seconds and raced away through the water as if it was all he ever did.
It makes Harry feel sad; suddenly realizing that Malfoy is on the edge of losing himself. And not even losing himself to just anything, no; once again a soul is slowly losing itself to Voldemort.
so to say. Dumbledore also noticed and looked at it with a frown. The Headmaster got surprised by a sudden burst of red flames, shooting up towards the ceiling higher than any of the previous three had done. Another piece of parchment wandered down towards him, landing on the palm of his hand. Dumbledore swallowed at the sight of the written name. 'H-Harry Potter,' he called out, his voice trembling of confusion.
'Not — not without my friends,' Harry stammered as a response, looking around to see where his friends were actually. He then saw glimpses of them appear in his sight, a warm feeling filling his chest at knowing they were save.
wrong. 'Draco,' she stammered. Her eyes were shining with unshed tears as she made her way to her son and embraced him with a hug — a hug of which Draco experienced as awkward for the first time ever. As stiff as the statue he thought he would've been turned into, Draco stood there and let his mother shed a few tears on his shoulder. As the woman finally lifted her head and wiped away the black lines of make-up off her cheeks, she sighed deeply. 'Your father has been taken away, Draco,' she told him in French. Whenever they were alone they always communicated in French — in the language they felt safe in talking. 'They have locked him away in Azkaban as if he's one of those evil Wizards that belong there!'
but not worthy of their attention. A bit hesitant he made his way around the crowd, finding a vacant table and chairs somewhere in the corner of the pub. As he sat himself down, a Wizard beside him gave him a vile head-to-toe glare before returning to his conversation. Another dingy looking Wizard passed by his table, giving him a bright smile of rotten teeth before joining a few others at another table. It all gave Draco the creeps and he gave himself a reminder to wash himself extra thoroughly when he would return, just to make sure no weird bacteria had crept upon him during his stay.
But it wouldn't. For two whole weeks they wandered off to the Lake after lunch; Harry casting the Bubble-Head charm on himself and Draco timing his dive into the water — but it just didn't work. The times would differ in odd ways; one day Harry would be able to stay underwater for over half an hour and other days he would only succeed in maintaining the bubble for a mere few minutes. It had nothing to do with mood, weather or which part of the Lake they used which made it impossible for them to know just why it wouldn't work. It frustrated both boys greatly as Christmas was coming closer and closer; the second task only planned two months after the festivities. Draco kept telling Harry it would all be fine, that he and Hermione would find something else. Harry had also joined their research days a few times and had followed Ron in falling asleep upon the thick, boring books that held no information they could use.
Harry nodded and tucked his hands a little deeper in his pockets. 'Yeah, I want to visit some shops. Get distracted from all the chaos for a moment. Clear my head.'
Harry took a step forward, throwing his hands up in the air as if it was obvious. 'Oh, I don't know — maybe the fact that
Returning to the Ministry hadn't been like the duo thought it would be. Ready to interrogate the annoying
Draco had once described the girls of Beauxbatons as blue violets; so elegantly like a flower and always dressed in silk and with their long hair waving behind them. The day before the wedding a violet alike came to him and tapped him on the shoulder. 'I want to show you something,' Fleur told him with a heavy French accent.
what's up with his arm. The look on Malfoy's face says enough, and satisfied, Harry leaves the Manor behind.
The Ministry Day, as everyone had called it, had come August the twelfth and Arthur had brought Harry to the Ministry. It had been a normal choice for him to do so as he worked there and knew one or two things about the Muggle world. At least, so Harry had thought. He had laughed a lot when he hadn't known how to use a metro card and at his enthusiasm for using the visitor's entry for the first time. Harry had been amazed by the Ministry's atrium but got hurried down corridors and hallways as they had found out his trial would be taking place in only a few minutes instead of an hour. It had been Draco's idea to go earlier than mentioned; he had warned Harry that the Ministry could play an ugly game when it came to trials. And so his advice had helped them to arrive in time.
Draco hurried himself after Harry, out the Great Hall. He heard a few students call the boy names as he walked through the hallway, showing off their
Stripped down to their underwear, the boys stood awkwardly side-by-side in front of the bath. The mermaid had started grinning at their sight and brushed through her hair more fervently. Draco turned himself towards Harry but found the boy's eyes everywhere
'He does,' Hermione replied to it, gesturing towards Harry with her head. 'And he will forever blame himself, no matter what you will tell him.'
do a few horrible things; nobody, expect for maybe Voldemort, deserved to die from a curse without at least
Non of the girls seemed to understand either, but they didn't like talking about the Tournament anymore. Cedric's death had shocked them all, especially Fleur. Beside from mourning her fellow Champion's death, she also remained in shock from being close to getting murdered by an evil plant.
'I don't know wether it's the locket, Hermione,' Harry admitted. 'Maybe they've just brainwashed him at the Manor or something — is there a spell for brainwashing a Wizard?'
So, I decided to give the story a little twist and give the locket to Draco as it will completely change his behavior. I also just wanted to change the story a little more so it wouldn't be too much like the real one. The weddings parts and such are short but I found them necessary to keep up with the story and remember everything that was going on.
The topic was closed, and they decided to stay. As Hermione and Ron set up a tent she had magically pulled from her tiny bag, Draco and Harry set themselves to get some water from the river and branches for a fire. 'Are you still alright?' Draco asked again, now keeping his eyes a little longer on Harry. He had finally let go of the sword, given it to Hermione whom had put it in her purse as well.
Draco sighed again, deeper this time as he threw his hands up in the air out of frustration. Didn't he have this same conversation only a few hours ago? 'Because I find it unfair that he has to all these tasks
Draco sighed. Of course he had thought about it before, but he knew it was still a few years away and that he would have time enough to think about it. Yet, he couldn't help but always answer the same thing whenever someone asked. 'A professor,
A voice woke him, Hermione standing hunched above his figure. 'Harry, what's wrong?' she asked, Ron joining by her side. Harry could still see the last of the twins their fireworks explode above his best friends' heads, his eyes unwilling to focus on any of it.
Even though it might sound strange, it was something that had happened quite a few times before in Harry's life; strange things that he'd never been able to explain. He'd already seen things move many times prior to that encounter in the bathroom, had seen people suddenly act strange, had escaped a handful of accidents… and no matter how many times they happened, Harry'd always kept telling himself that it was nothing, that he'd imagined it. Yet sometimes, at night when he laid alone in bed surrounded by the dark, he often wondered if there was something — or
A bit hesitant Harry opened the front door, whispers following shortly after. He immediately looked around, took in the place he had just entered. The hallway was dark, the wallpaper tearing off slowly as if spirits were trying to crawl from behind it. He flinched slightly when Draco closed the door behind them, the loud sound interrupting his observations. A few portraits were hung against the walls, Wizards and Witches dressed in black throwing glares at him. He flinched once again when Draco hit something, grumbled French words as he kicked something that looked like a troll's foot only to hurt his toe again.
Harry had told Draco that the room they had used for their secret D.A. meetings had also been on the seventh floor, and that it simply had to be the same room yet transformed into a completely different one on the inside. Perhaps, Draco thought; as he had sworn to have seen some duel-practice puppets there before.
A blush appeared on Harry's face as he remained silent and turned another corner, Draco's hand still in his. Again, it wasn't the right way and Draco started to worry wether Harry had forgotten the way through his own school. But as they once again turned another wrong corner, he felt Harry's grip tighten around his hand and pull him forward. With all the force the boy seemed to possess, Draco got shoved against a wall and held by his writs. He felt Harry's nails dig into his delicate skin as the boy's face leaned closer to Draco's, and his soft lips pressed themselves against his. The kiss was so sudden and happened so fast that Draco didn't know what to do, and just stood frozen against the cold wall.
“Oh yeah, I actually have been meaning to tell you about that. The reason Sirius wanted to meet with me and why he came back is because he wants to train me. He’s still being paranoid and thinks someone is out to get me. He and Lupin are going to meet with me in the Shrieking Shack and teach me defence.”
Draco settled back against the couch and shrugged. “I’m allowed to, and you aren’t,” he said matter-of-factly.
“Wait, the two of you weren’t actually dating? You were constantly covered in lovebites!” Lavender Brown burst.
As he got closer, he could hear Sirius and Remus bickering. Harry was still getting used to calling him Remus and not Lupin, but it was a work in progress that Remus insisted upon.
“Someone here is possessive,” Draco teased bumping his shoulder against Harry’s. Harry was now bright red, a rarity with his complexion. The table was absolutely roaring with laughter at his expense, but he didn’t seem upset about it. Draco had to admire the Gryffindors for being there for Harry at the moment.
To Severus’ credit he only stared a second before grasping his shoulder and dragging him towards Dumbledore. Draco should have been more worried about people seeing his Mark, but he was too full of terror for Harry to think about it too much.
“All I’m saying is that you should all be a lot quieter if you’re trying to not get caught. Unless you want to be next, Granger, which by all means be my guest.” Malfoy glared at Harry, looking swiftly at Harry’s fist where the bottle cap was still tightly clenched.
"And let that insane man know he got the better of me? Absolutely not, I can heal myself." He gestured towards the potion, pulling his stirring rod out and setting it down on the table.
Harry threw the cloak over both of their heads, grasping the map and his wand in one hand, “The only one we really have to worry about is Mad-Eye, his eye can see through my cloak. But he’s always in his office, so we should be okay. Oh, and Mrs. Norris, I think she can smell through it.”
Harry was silent for a while, the laughter gone from his face. Draco should have taken a moment to see how Harry was feeling, but all he could feel was his own anger.
"Nah, don’t worry about it. I'll be sleeping anyways. Thanks though," Harry said hurriedly turning towards the steps.
Draco grasped at Harry’s hands, “No, I’m glad you’ve told me. I want to know everything about you. Especially the tough stuff. Believe me, I get it. I obviously grew up in a very different household, but it was by no means perfect, as you have guessed. Father is not an easy person to please or to live with.”
"Are you ready to go back out there?" Draco asked, settling the towel around Harry's shoulders so his hair didn't get him wet. Draco had cast a drying spell on his own trousers and shirt but still left his shirt hang open so Harry could see his Mark. Harry kept reaching up and touching it briefly like he was trying to remind himself it was still there.
“Just a few months and we’ll be back,” Draco assured him as Harry cast a last glance around the room he called home for most of the year. Decoding his emotions with ease, as per usual.
Finally, after what felt like several lifetimes, like Dumbledore long lifetimes, Harry walked through the door.
“Only when it comes to Draco, apparently,” Harry sighed, looking over at her briefly as well, before returning to focusing on holding the ice pack to Draco’s face.
Malfoy nodded, “We need to figure out how to glamour. I didn’t have time to research when I was at the Manor, but I’ll find something once we’re back at school.”
“No need, I feel the same way,” Harry whispered, his fingers also coming up to caress across the moon on Draco’s chest. It seemed like the moment they were safely in each other’s presence; the buttons on their shirts came apart. Harry couldn’t quite explain the feeling just seeing Draco’s mark brought him, let alone when he could touch it. Although, if Harry was being honest with himself, it still felt like he was stealing biscuits from the jar whenever he was allowed to touch another person this frequently. Draco kept having to tell him he was always allowed to touch him when they were alone, Harry had not quite gotten used to initiating contact.
At the far end of the Ward there was a set of curtains around what Draco had mentally labelled ‘Potter’s bed’, or the bed Harry always took residence in whenever he was in the Hospital Wing. Draco wondered if Pomfrey put him in the same bed each time on purpose. Outside of the curtains Madam Pomfrey and Dumbledore were standing, Pomfrey was red in the face, her finger inches from Dumbledore’s face.
“Will he sleep through the night? Can I stay here with him, please?” Draco pleaded. He already seemed pathetic enough in her eyes, he might as well use it to his advantage.
Draco was fighting hard not to think too much about what Weasley had said. Torture? That better not mean what he thought it did. Draco looked to Pomfrey, letting the sneer drop, “I am extremely sorry to bother you, Madam, but I took a Bludger to the ribs and it was beginning to get hard to breathe.”
Hermione smiled at him, looking like she wanted to say more, but bit her lip instead and moved to the door. Harry grabbed her hand and pulled her into a brief hug, thankful to have such an amazing and supportive friend.
“I have it taken care of,” Draco said flippantly. His mind on one thing and one thing only. “Can I go to him now?”
There was one person Draco was actually worried about upsetting and that was his mother. He didn’t think she knew the extent of what Lucius did. She definitely knew Lucius punished him, but he didn’t think she was aware of the severity. The society women were going to have a field day with this information, and it was going to look badly on her.
“Her transfiguration skills are quite impressive,” Hermione mumbled, her eyes still glued to her arm.
“That was bloody brilliant!” Weasley gasped before breaking down into laughter, “Did you see his face?”
“You best think over your priorities before the next time I see you,” Father threatened. Draco thought the torture was over before he suddenly felt a different blinding pain than the one he had just experienced. The pain encompassed his left cheek bone as Father struck him hard across the face with his cane. Stars burst across Draco’s vision and he let out an involuntary gasp as footsteps faded away from him.
If Harry could have screamed he would. His whole body felt like it was on fire, like every nerve ending was being bathed in acid. Harry had thought that the pain he felt the night Draco suffered from the rejection sickness had been bad, that was a walk in the park compared to this.  Even feeling it second-hand did not compare at all to the real thing. For a moment, Harry was filled with rage towards Lucius. How could he knowingly cause this pain on his only child? Just as quickly as it started, it ended and Harry was brought out of his thoughts. Harry felt his cheek collide with the ground as he was dropped. Harry dimly noticed thuds and the sound of footsteps receding when warm hands flipped him over.
Harry felt anxiety rise up inside of him and his head flew up to look across the room again, Harry was beginning to be able to tell the difference between his emotions and Malfoy’s. The latter having a distinct ‘flavour’ that he could recognize as not his own. Malfoy was looking at Pansy, but kept shooting sideways glances at Harry. Harry sighed, as much as Malfoy tried to tell him he had to be more subtle, Malfoy was being as subtle as a flying brick.
“Harry and Draco never got along. They were at each other’s throats most of the time. Ron’s whole family hates the Malfoys. He’s probably afraid Ron wouldn’t accept Draco. That most people won’t like the two of them together.”
“Harry must return in order for the protective spell his mother enacted to continue to work,” Dumbledore explained slowly, like Draco was a small child.
The music started and Draco’s lessons paid off apparently. Harry looked at least somewhat put together as he twirled the Gryffindor Patel around the floor. Krum and Hermione were also holding their own. Soon Dumbledore was joining the dance which signalled the rest of the couples could join. Draco waited a few moments before leading Pansy onto the floor. The two of them had been dancing together at Balls for as long as he could remember, it was almost second nature to follow their customary steps.
The whole walk back to the tent Harry was in a daze. Had that actually just happened? Was Draco Malfoy his actual soul-mate? He hadn’t even known that soul-mates existed before he came to Hogwarts. He hadn’t even really believed they were real until he watched Dean and Seamus go from friends, to the closest two people could possibly be after realizing their bond late in their second year. It had been a nasty shock to them, but perfectly timed because both of the two of them had been developing a crush on the other but had been terrified to say anything.
Draco unbuttoned the top buttons on Harry’s shirt, placing his hand against his Mark and feeling the rush of warmth fill his body. Draco used his other hand to carefully brush Harry’s hair from his face.
Draco made a show of every step of the potion from then on, loudly instructing each move like he was teaching a small child.
“Well, er, Mr. Malfoy, no need to be hasty here. I am sure you must have misheard me. As for the situation with Crouch, it was beyond my control. Obviously, I had not instructed the Dementor to Kiss Crouch.”
There was no doubt that the other two Headmasters had definitely given their students a head’s up on what the task was, and Draco was momentarily thankful that Hagrid had clued in Harry. He could only imagine what would have happened if Harry had not been able to strategize beforehand. The elaborate spell that Delacour cast on her Welsh Green had been impressive to say the least, although Draco had not shared in the excitement of some of his peers when they saw her skirt catch fire. Savages, the lot of them, the girl was on fire for Merlin’s sake.
Draco tried to make a noise in the back of his throat that could be a scoff, but it came out more like a poorly construed whine. Pansy dug her nails into Draco’s arm and he took the message, shaking his head slightly and taking a deep breath to better focus himself.
Draco grasped the dagger and sliced the palm of his wand arm, he let blood flow from his hand and off the dagger into the goblet.
“Fisticuffs and other forms of grappling are beneath a Malfoy, my Father would be beside himself,” Malfoy twirled his wand in his hand.
"What just happened, Mum? I felt something," Ginny asked, her eyes switching between the two of them suspiciously.
Happy Monday everyone! The last week has been insanity. I hope everyone has been staying safe and sane. Here we had some big boy talks between our fave couple. I felt like it was time Harry explicitly told Draco about his upbringing. I headcanon (as yall have probably assumed) that Harry was treated pretty badly by the Dursleys since the books are mostly vague. As yall also already know, Lucius is not father of the year either.
“He tried to summon something I think,” Pansy said, staring at Harry quizzically. Finally, Draco could hear a faint whistling, and Harry’s broom soared into sight. Unfortunately the sound and movement also caught the dragon’s attention, she whipped towards Harry, but he took a running start and leaped onto his broom, zooming into the air. Draco finally sighed out quietly in relief as the crowd erupted into ear-splitting cheers, almost drowned out by the roaring of the dragon and the stream of fire she exhaled at Harry.
“Please, help him,” Harry choked, worried how bad things must be for Draco if they were even a shadow of what he was feeling now. Pomfrey turned towards Draco, pulling his shirt apart to bear his chest, she gasped as his mark came into view. She whirled around pointing her wand at him and Harry felt himself being hauled across the floor towards Draco, his knees dragging across the tile.
"Harry and I bumped into each other leaving the Cup, if you can recall. We’ve been meeting in secret since then, for his and my own safety. He was worried about your reaction in particular, and it seems to have been for good reason," Draco pursed his lips, his eyes briefly flashing to Hermione. He wasn't going to throw her under the Knight Bus but he hoped she'd fess up.
Harry was very intrigued by this girl, and couldn’t help staring at her. She smiled brightly at him and then looked over to Ginny.
“Of course Saint Potter would be able to throw it off, why am I even surprised?” Draco commented dryly. Draco did his absolute best to keep the relief out of his voice. Based on who Harry was, it was probably for the best that Harry could resist the curse. Never mind the impressiveness of him throwing it off the first time it was cast on him. That is if it hadn’t been cast on him before, who fucking knew when it came to his soul-mate.
“You have absolutely ruined my robe,” Malfoy finally complained as they came to a still, Harry straddling Malfoy’s hips.
“Mr. Potter I am quite busy at the moment, if it isn’t an emergency I would really appreciate if you came back in the morning,” Pomfrey called to him from behind a curtain. Harry could feel the magnitude of magic she was casting the second he entered. It was like a wave of static had hit him, bringing him to a halt, the hair on his arms standing up.
“Tell me what the Manor is like,” Harry said, his quill scratching across the parchment in front of him.
Draco was momentarily distracted as he felt a stabbing pain in his elbow. A few moments passed where Harry seemed distracted, and then terror more so than Draco had ever felt flooded through. Draco couldn’t imagine what Harry must be experiencing.
I feel like the Pomfrey scene just had to be included. I tried to see if I could make it an outtake, but I just feel like it adds a little something to the series that I wouldn't want anyone to miss by not reading it. So I kept it here.
Draco didn’t like the feeling coming through the bond, it was like he could barely feel Harry at all. It was making the anxiety in his chest tighten more so with each step he got closer to Harry without any emotions coming through. Draco hadn’t realized how much of a comfort feeling Harry’s undercurrent of emotions flowing through him had been until he couldn’t feel it anymore. He understood why Harry had gotten so upset about him cutting off his emotions all of those weeks ago. He would definitely think twice before he cut them off again.
Harry did the only thing he was currently capable of doing and spit as hard as he could. A wad of red tinged saliva hit the boy square in the face, dripping down and staining the light blue of his uniform. The boy angrily wiped it away, hatred and disgust filling his eyes.
The silence was finally broken as he muttered a quiet thank you. Hermione had never heard Draco sound so utterly defeated.
Harry shrugged, “I only do it when I’m around you it seems. I can’t make it happen, or control it, it just does.”
Blaise was still stuck as a rainbow canary and seemed to be getting increasingly agitated by the fact he wasn’t changing back. Blaise squawked angrily, but abruptly got up from the table and stalked from the Hall.
The rest of the game went by too quickly for Harry’s liking and before he knew it he was getting to his feet to leave the box. Fred and George were singing loudly behind him, arms around each other’s shoulders, celebrating the large bet they had just won.
“It’s just bizarre...” Harry started, getting to his feet, the corners of his mouth perking up at Malfoy’s little tantrum. Malfoy strode towards him, pushing him roughly against the tree behind him. Harry grunted softly as his back bit into the bark.
“To be fair, Hermione is brilliant and she really struggled with that,” He grinned, and Draco shook his head in annoyance.
“Yes, I am,” He whispered, unable to look away from Harry’s eyes. They stood there for a few moments before Harry hauled him in closer, burying his face in Draco’s neck, their chests flush against each other. Draco could almost feel sparks jumping between their marks.
“Shouldn’t be here,” Draco chided, realizing he was more affected by the Cruciatus than he was accustomed.
“You think my parents are going to be thrilled about my bond?” She explained quietly into his ear, her voice barely able to be understood despite how close they were sitting.
Theo rolled his eyes, “Yeah I know that’s not what you meant. I dunno I guess I suspected at the naming of the Champions, then I really thought so when you got sick, then after the First Task I wasn’t so sure, then during the Ball and the Second Task I was positive. Sorry mate, I mean this in the least homophobic way possible, but I know you couldn’t get it up for Pansy if your life depended on it. It was too weird that you were now dating her, but I have to hand it to both of you, you put on quite a show. I honestly just thought maybe you were giving into your dad, but then when you stuck it to him after the Second Task, I knew there had to be a bigger reason.
Theo kept his eyes on Draco as he spoke the words, watching as Draco’s pupils dilated. To his credit, Draco hardly flinched in his act.
First things first, coding italics and bold is a freaking pain in the ass on here so please love me for the struggle I just went through. Second how'd you like Christmas presents?? What do we think Harry took? I'd love to hear your guesses. If anyone correctly guesses I'll give them a shout out in the next chapter.  Yule Ball is next and it's a very fun chapter I promise. Also there is another bonding coming up. In a couple chapters my absolute favorite quote of the entire story happens and I can't wait for yall to read it. Like I kinda want to make shirts with this quote on it. Anyways. I hope everyone understood that Harry signed a moon because their marks represent the other, so Harry would be signing the mark that represents him, which happens to be on Draco's chest.
"Oops. Sorry." Harry shook his hands out, gulping in air and unbuttoning a few buttons on his shirt. It suddenly felt like it was 50 degrees hotter in the room. On the other hand, pleasant warmth was flooding his body from where Malfoy’s hand settled on his arm. "I'm okay. Sorry this is just a lot.” He gulped in a deep breath. “That feels nice,” He commented absent-mindedly.
Draco looked at him, finally pulling his eyes from the gift, “Not really. I could tell they definitely wanted to ask me, but they’re more worried about me getting better first. I’m sure once I’m not in a pathetic dressing gown they’ll be all over me with questions. How did Granger take it?”
“It’s going to be hard, but I’ll try to keep in mind that you don’t have an ulterior motive for finding out more about me.”
In truth, he wasn’t ready for his House to deal with Harry. He could take harsh words right now; he didn’t want Harry subjected to it.
Harry nodded and took the potion from Madam Pomfrey, "Promise?" He asked again and Draco had to bite his lip with how vulnerable Harry sounded.
“I’m sorry, I’m rubbish at healing. I’ve never learned,” She said as Draco winced at the cold. His wits were slowly coming back to him. His face throbbed painfully and Draco didn’t know how Harry hadn’t already come to find him. He hoped he hadn’t been too affected. Hermione gently pulled him into a  seated position when she pressed the snow-scarf to his face, but she still kneeled beside him.
“You have no idea how much torture it has been wanting to do that all night,” Draco said a few moments later.
“Speaking of, have anything to tell us, Hermione? Any secret soul-marks with a certain Bulgarian?” Ginny grilled, smiling kindly over at Hermione.
“I’ll be back soon, I promise,” Hermione assured him. She reached out quickly to run her hand across his arm, smiled at Harry, and left the room.
“Watcha working on?” Harry asked, setting down his things and collapsing into the chair next to him.
So, they were getting straight into it then? Draco hoped Harry’s meeting with Sirius was going better than his meeting, at any rate. Draco was mostly just thankful Harry wouldn’t be anywhere near the Three Broomsticks while Father was present. He had been overjoyed when Harry had told him his godfather had organized a visit for this particular Hogsmeade trip.
“Goddammit I wish we didn’t have to keep this secret. It’s such fucking bullshit,” Harry burst and the same fizzles of light that had shot from his hands before started up again. Draco got nothing but bad feelings from what Harry could do with his uncontrolled magic when upset like this. Also, Draco had never heard Harry curse so badly. Draco was corrupting him.
“Great, I was wondering the same thing about your dad. He ran before the Ministry captured him though, right?” Ron shot back, his ears turning red.
“Today we’re going to continue working on dodging, evading, and summoning or transfiguring things to block spells.”
“Draco is very bright. He and Hermione were at the top of every class. He knows you’re either with Harry or against him in this war.”
No, Poppy had been wrong. The best thing that could have ever happened to Harry might have been the boy currently sobbing over him.
Draco stayed silent, not wanting to do or say anything that would make Harry stop. After awhile he couldn’t help himself, “Last I checked I have the moon and you have the sun. You’re the Light and I’m the Dark.”
Draco laughed out loud, his relaxed smile back on his face, “He didn’t do anything to them. There was a reason I asked you their schedule. He pissed me off. I paid them to play the prank on him.”
“That is none of your business, now leave, I will not ask again!” Harry had never heard her so furious, but he didn’t move towards the doors. Draco looked even worse up close than he had in the corridor. Harry felt guilt gnawing at his chest. This was his fault.
Harry couldn’t believe the calibre the professional teams played at. He could barely keep track of where the Quaffle was, due to the speed the chasers threw it to one another. Harry kept his eyes peeled for the golden glint of the Snitch. Catching it in his view a couple times before it would disappear again.
Draco was momentarily thrown off before it clicked, and he quickly re-buttoned his shirt. “You know who it is then.”
“Harry did you just perform wandless magic?” Hermione burst and Draco laughed out loud, frowning at the ache in his cheek. He was glad some things were still the same.
“Oh, you’re no fun anymore,” Pansy whinged, stopping to look around as Draco sealed the door. “Love what you’ve done with the place.”
Dread pooled in Harry’s stomach at the thought. He couldn’t imagine telling his best mates about his newfound bond. He hoped whatever soul-mark he had wouldn’t be impossible to hide, but knew it was only a matter of time. He couldn’t exactly get changed inside his bed curtains or the loo for the rest of time, Ron was bound to get suspicious eventually.
“Thank you, Theo,” Draco grinned. Across the Hall Harry had snuck a glance at him and his emotions were a mess of curiosity, probably wondering where he had been. Draco felt bad for sneaking behind Harry’s back, but he couldn’t bare to think about what would have happened had he failed. Better to ask forgiveness than permission, as they said.
“Do the Slytherins really have to sit with us? Malfoy I get, but Parkinson and Nott? Get back to your own table!”
Millie smirked, reaching up and pinching his cheek. Draco batted her hand way and pinched her side in retaliation.
Harry stared out at the sea of tents stretching as far as he could see in every direction; he briefly closed his eyes and opened them again. He could barely believe that he was here, at the Quidditch World Cup. It was one thing to be surrounded my magic at school, but here it felt absolutely surreal. So many magical beings, all in one place, all there to enjoy their favourite sport.
“What the – “ Harry complained before a hand was clamped over his mouth. Immediately Harry went for his wand and realized it wasn’t in his waistband like it normally was.
Hermione noticed more often than not that Draco would somehow intervene before Ron or Harry made a mistake, either narrating loudly what he was doing, sending Harry a signal through their bond, or throwing the correct ingredient at them. Hermione had to hand it to him, he somehow did it all with the same attitude he had handled Harry with since first year. If she hadn’t known better, she would have never noticed anything amiss. Although, to be fair, her classmates were not the most observant group of people. No one had noticed Lupin becoming sick once a month at the same phase of the moon last year, even when Snape had practically screamed it at their faces.
“The Tournament as a whole has not been the most fun on the pain scale. It’s one thing to worry about a person, it is a whole different world when you share their pain.”
Harry’s head snapped up and Draco saw a fire in them that he hadn’t seen aimed at him in almost a year.
“Harry, hey look at me, love, open your eyes,” Draco commanded. Harry did as he was told, his eyes linking with Draco’s, recognition blossoming. “It’s me love, remember, you’re safe. I won’t let anything happen to you right now. We’re just going to get cleaned up. That’s what you wanted, right?”
Draco shook his head again, “It feels far, but I can still feel his pain and emotions like he’s inside the Castle.” Draco was struck with the pain of being tortured again and sagged down onto a chair, gripping the back as he rode out the pain.
“I have to go to the Owlery and order something, then I figured you’ve been bugging me about talking to a certain person and we could go there after.”
Harry went downstairs to retrieve his books from the table. He found Hermione staring out the back window, sipping at a cup of tea.
What had his life turned into? “You hoped for the best?” Draco muttered weakly, he couldn’t believe he had driven himself to the brink of insanity over this.
“I wish I could bring you as my date,” Harry sighed bitterly. Draco frowned and bit his lip at the comment.
“That’s something to think about too, actually. Do you feel temperature through the bond?” Hermione asked and Draco looked over at Harry who shrugged.
“And break!” Remus called and Harry rolled onto his back, throwing his arms and legs wide in a starfish shape, gasping heavily. One great thing about the training sessions was that Harry was definitely exercising the anger inside him into a worthy outlet. Harry’s anger wasn’t nearly as frequent. These trainings definitely exhausted him.
Sorry I missed my update last week. Life has been full of stress. I hope some more Pansy in your life starts to make up for it.
“I don’t think this Mark is meant to be platonic,” Draco said. He didn’t voice out loud how absolutely gone for Hermione, Weasley was. That wasn’t something Pansy needed to be reminded of in the present moment. Draco reached out and intertwined their fingers, sitting in silence as Pansy cried.
Malfoy was most definitely his soul-mate. Harry stared at himself in the mirror, mouth agape. A massive sun tattoo covered the left side of his chest. The sun was woven full of reds, yellows, and oranges, with even some purple and blue making its way through for the most elaborate depiction of the sun he had ever seen. The colours were still massively bright against his brown skin; Harry wasn’t sure why he expected anything different after seeing Dean’s mark so many times. Dean was even darker skinned than he was.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, sorry it was kind of a filler. I wanted to devote some time to Draco learning about the map. Also I love the headcanon that Snape is Draco's godfather, so I hope you all are cool with that. A million hugs and highfives for the reaction to this. We're almost at 10k hits!! Love you guys! See you Monday, have a great weekend!
“Just keep an eye on my conjugations in the second paragraph, I’m not incredibly confident,” Draco warned and she nodded.
Draco didn’t say anything, just readjusted so his head was on Harry’s chest. He listening to the soothing sound of Harry’s heartbeat and the feeling of his fingers carding though his hair. Slowly, Draco felt himself drift off into the sleep he had been robbed of the night before.
“Shit,” Harry whispered to himself. His neck was littered with love bites. They weren’t as prominent as Draco’s normally looked but Harry attributed that to the fairness of Draco’s skin; bruises tended to  stick out in hard contrast. His were still very much visible, and very much apparent of what they were. Harry considered his possibilities. He could ignore Ron and not answer who gave them to him, but he was bound to be interrogated without end until he told him. He could lie and say he fell? No, Harry shook his head, that would never work. “What am I going to do?”
Draco snuck a look sideways and noticed Harry was quickly unbuttoning the first half of buttons on his shirt. “Two can play at that game,” He muttered under his breath. Draco bit his lip to keep from laughing.
Draco looked down at him, the soft look returning. “Take your glasses off if you’re going to do that, you’ll injure your face.”
Frowning his eyebrows, Draco tried to remember if he had seen around another girl the last couple of days. Suddenly remembering him hanging around a girl he knew was named Lavender Brown a lot, often talking quite intimately, Draco nodded his head. 'Of course; I apologize.'
She drew back, staring at Draco with still those giant blue eyes. They seemed to be even larger in the moonlight; almost deer-like. ‘Actually, it was Madame Maxime that pointed them out to me. She had an
Hermione explained what she had discovered; how prophecies of certain value could be stored away in orbs of glass. A prophecy only came through a Seer's soul; Wizards or Witches that were highly skilled in Divination. A Seer would recite a prophecy involuntarily and wouldn't remember the event — making the listener of the prediction often the only witness. The prophecy then could be stored into an orb of glass to keep it for a future hearing — for when someone would need to hear it once again. To where they were kept, no-one seemed to mention in depth — only that it was a well-hidden and well-secured place.
Trying out the same password he had heard two years ago, Draco was surprised to have the stairs turn upwards for him and bring him to the headmaster's chambers. A single knock on brown wood was enough for it to open already; to open its door to a deserted office. Dumbledore was nowhere to be seen but a blue, dazzling light shined brightly from the corner of Draco's eye. His feet dragged him towards it and he quickly recognized the shining liquid as the memories contained in a pensieve.
'And that one?' She now pointed at her own heart, referring to the butterfly-shaped scar, now covered with light grey wool.
'Then you should've realized the danger.' A certain anger resounded through his voice — a certain worry that Draco had so often heard in Albus Dumbledore's voice as well.
"Pibbly was sent by Mistress Malfoy to bring down master Malfoy for breakfast, master Malfoy, sir," she announced. Her voice always sounds sharp in Draco's ears, and sends a small shiver down his spine every time she opens her mouth.
As they seated themselves amongst students dressed with blue details — he later discovered were called
'So you know him?' Bellatrix reacted, wand placed underneath Harry's chin. 'Let's keep you a bit longer then, shall we? Let's see what that pretty face of you looks like after a few hours.' She glanced over her shoulder at Lucius Malfoy, indicating that he had to take Harry and his friends away.
Hermione rolled her eyes at his words. 'I don't mean the warning — I mean the part where he told you his father kept on mentioning this
A silence fell. Not even the others, whom had been talking in the living room nearby, were making a sound. Only the loud wind outside was hearable, the faint waves of the sea. 'Where do we start?' Draco asked, turning himself to Harry and breaking the silence.
'Actually, I've always known. It's on your bag, on a few of your books as well. Back at the Lake, I wanted to tell you that I knew what it was, but you never gave me the chance,' Harry told him as he looked up into Draco's eyes. ‘Neither did I have a clue it was so important to you that I knew.’’
The boy's table was especially quiet that morning as Draco ate his toast, waited eagerly for the owls to arrive and bring in their letters. A tree branch painted gold was placed upon the dining chamber's tables every Monday morning for the animals to land on, and Draco couldn't keep his eyes off of it. 'If you stare any longer at that thing it might disappear,' André pointed out. He himself had never really been interested about what his parents wrote him — quite the opposite to his brother who was always just as eagerly waiting as Draco for his letters to arrive.
Hermione shrugged and closed her book. 'Remember his letters from last summer? I haven't read them, of course, but I remember you telling us a thing or two about them,' she started.
I really hope there's still someone interested in reading how this story continues? :/) Anyway, I still enjoy writing it, though updates are slow as usual (sorry). I believe there will only be one more chapters left after this one, and then Papillon will officially be finished. I already want to thank those of you whom stuck around for so long, it truly warms my heart!
And before Harry even realizes what he's doing, his hand is already clenched tight around Malfoy's wrist; his thumb easily touching his other fingers.
Draco actually didn't know. Well, he actually kind of did; he had wanted to tell it to him because he thought it was fair. But now that he had actually said it; it felt like he was betraying Fleur, Madame Maxime and his entire school. He ended up saying the thing he knew Harry would want to hear; the only reason why Harry would believe why he had told him about the dragons. '
It seemed to take forever until they reached the right vault; climbing through small passageways and escaping death through the eye of a needle while moving past a deep, dark abyss. Draco often clamped onto the fabric of Harry's shirt, his knees wobbling under the weight of nervosity. He was going to die, he knew. He was going to die underground while following a dimwitted goblin, dressed in black instead of blue and without a hat. And that simply wasn't the right way to go. Therefore he kept his chin up, set his mind to determination and tried not to think about what was hiding in the deep darkness beneath his feet. Draco could almost cry when spotting the shining number of Bellatrix' vault appear in the distance, ogling at him with a golden gleam. 'There is is,' Draco said as they came closer and to a halt. 'Open up, goblin!' he demanded, and the goblin obeyed by bowing his head and letting a finger slide over the heavy metal of the door.
Harry was the most clumsy dance partner he had ever had, but he seemed to enjoy every second of it. Draco knew how to dance both in the role of a boy as that of a girl; and he also knew perfectly how to guide his partner. Therefore they somehow managed to not embarrass themselves
Frowning his eyebrows a little, Harry tried to make sense of something. "When did you start guarding me? I thought you said you've been guarding me for sixteen years, no? So, does that make me—"
a Death Eater like his father; he is just an innocent boy like all of you that wants to continue his education. Isn't that only normal? You mustn't blame him for the mistakes his father made,' McGonagall replied in defense. It warmed Draco's heart at hearing how hard the woman was defending him; even though she knew nothing about the real reason he was there.
Even though he often wished he had had a family to go to like most students, the Holidays were always quite the sight at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he’d always loved spending Christmas there. And
Draco raised his glass as well, a small smile upon his lips. He still wasn't sure wether everyone around that particular table actually wanted him there; but having at least the support of a few was enough to give him the feeling only Christmas could give. He noticed Sirius was there as well; all the way at the end of the table, looking extremely tired and bored by it all. Something had changed — or something wasn't going like the raven-haired man wanted things to go.
It was already after midnight when the last Gryffindors wandered off to bed, leaving a drunk on Butterbeer Dean and Ron behind upon one of the sofas. They were still chatting about Quidditch and that they missed it so much this year. Harry had joined their conversation at first but as Hermione had drooped away to bed as well, he had preferred Draco's company over that of his friends. They were laying on the rug in front of the fireplace, talking about nothing in particular. 'Do you know what you want to be after seventh-year?' Harry suddenly asked.
'It's down in the basement so perhaps if you'll hang out with silent Davis for another hour we can still go to that place afterwards? Really have to do this task first; the Minister himself gave it to me so I better be off now,' the man continued.
. The boy seemed to blend in perfectly in the frosty winterscape, and Harry found it quite a strange sight — a sight he had never seen before.
'Are you alright?' Harry asked him, looking at his tormented face. He seemed on the verge of bursting into a laugh.
, Draco was quite the celebrity as well. In France however, Harry didn’t get as much attention at all and could enjoy his time without being stopped every other second.
And so it was that they were sharing a bed with Tonks by their side, snoring loudly as if she had transformed her head in that of a pig again. 'I never got the chance to thank you for that warning you gave me,' Harry whispered to Draco. The blond had his eyes closed but Harry knew he was still awake.
As if the curse didn't want him to talk about it, his hand started to shake. His tea cup and saucer jingled against each other and Draco's forced to place it back on the small table. Keeping his mind as calm as he could, he tried to stop the shaking by holding his hand down. And it is then that Potter reached out towards him, brushing over Draco's pale hands with his fingertips. The physical contact made him shiver and look up in the man's green eyes. Had they always been that green? Potter's eyes looked like morning grass, polished emeralds and even… the color of the spell of Death.
He dressed himself in the school's uniform, proudly showing off the golden crest of Beauxbatons stitched upon his heart. His hand automatically reached out for one of his hats, but he drew it back and decided he wasn't feeling like wearing one today. Throwing another glance outside his window, looking at Beauxbatons' Quidditch Pitch in the far background, he decided it might be a good day to fly and let that strong autumn's wind blow through his hair.
‘Harry, it’s so nice to see you again,' Sirius said to him. His dark eyes were sparkling and Harry noticed he had gained some weight since he'd last seen him. 'And I must admit it’s my fault that mister Malfoy is here; I invited him to come.’
. Draco took a glance upon his timepiece, one he had borrowed from his mother as his own had been given to Harry, and noticed that he had only a few more minutes left before the Portkey would leave without him — make him unable to return to Beauxbatons.
Harry laughed a little at Draco's comment, and Draco's lips curled upwards once more as well. "How did you know I was wondering just that?" he asked, a little
, was the most terrible thing to overcome the boy out of all. He worried about Draco every second of the day; wondered what was happening to him and of course, wether he had survived the damage he had done. What would Voldemort do once he knew Draco hadn't completed the task he had been assigned to? Would he be mad? Or would he forgive him as he hadn't even been a decent member of the Death Eaters in the first place? Harry had no clue, and therefore worried even more.
'Mun— Mundungus Fletcher,' he answered. Glancing back at his friends, he could see how Ron angrily bit his teeth. That very same man was the one to have fled during the night of the attack — the night Mad-Eye had died and his partner had fled like a coward. That very same man now had stolen things that belonged to the house of Black, and therefore to Harry. That very same man had taken away a horcrux without even realizing it.
unite their education systems. They have seen how well we can get along during the Tournament last year and now believe we should keep on getting along,' Madame explained.
'And he happens to be one of those elected students,' Ansel then said, interrupting Draco's story and getting a glare from the same blond in return. '
Swallowing because of the fact that that same Harry was standing right beside them, Draco looked away for a few seconds before being able to focus himself again. 'Right,' he answered. 'Then at least let me take a look at it again,
, I have arranged something better.' Out of the pocket of his robes he retrieved two miniature size brooms, threw them in the air and casted an
Harry shrugged. 'I'm not sure yet, really. Maybe an auror, maybe a professional Quidditch player — I don't know. Being a professor here at Hogwarts sounds appealing too after hearing you talk.'
The boy shook his head. "Not by far. For now however, it's enough." Without another word or warning, the enormous wings then both folded themselves and disappeared into the boy's back as if it was the most normal thing in the world. A pale, smooth back was the only thing left visible — besides the wound that now looked flat and had a pale pink color.
.' Harry grinned at his words and slid a hand through his messy hair. 'I would like to tell you that story now, if you would like?
"Draco, are you alright?" Her eyes are full of worry as she drops down in a hunched position next to him, laying her hand upon his arm.
'Just like I could use one as well,' Harry then said. The boy had slowly come closer to Draco again and Draco could feel the touch of his fingers against his own. His cheeks felt hot and he looked away, probably blushing, as Harry's hand slowly found his again.
The small table they had in their tent was now loaded with books Hermione had pulled out of her purse; together with a broken radio, packets of biscuits and the sword of Gryffindor. The piece of metal was still shining as bright as ever; as if it hadn't destroyed a few dark items earlier that evening.
Dumbledore?' he asked. His voice sounded weird in the room, almost out of place as if he was interrupting a conversation he wasn't a part of.
Desperate, Harry took ahold of Draco's arm, as if to show he wouldn't let go of the boy so easily. A glare of eyes followed as Snape pushed him aside, Harry immediately losing his grip on the boy and stumbling backwards. 'I must return him to the Dark Lord, Potter. It is the only way.'
Mundungus swallowed and took a deep breath. Hands were shaking as he wiped away a drop of sweat from his bald head. 'Lestrange,' he answered. 'Bellatrix Lestrange.'
'Now we find a way to destroy the locket — and try to find the other horcruxes,' Harry replied, sighing as well.
. Only during the early morning hours he retreated outside, caught a glimpse of white hair as his mother took care of her roses, taking in the morning dew on their petals. Not many words were exchanged between the two during the day, not even in the morning when they both spent their time in the garden. Sometimes, when his mother felt lonely or grieved Draco's father, she could ramble for hours on end. Draco would nod at her words, but not hear them.
'I wish he could be here — he probably would've wanted to,' Harry admitted with a sigh, letting go of Fleur's dress and staring back at the photograph.
Unsure of what to do, Harry hesitated for a few seconds longer, but then decided he couldn't let this boy suffer any more, and gave in. "It's a few more minutes walking though — will you be able to manage?" The boy in white nodded. "Wouldn't it be better if I took you to a hospital? To a doctor? You are bleeding and seem terribly hurt…"
?' Raphael asked, his voice full of concern. A sad look lingered upon the portrait's face, and the key's wings seemed to flutter less fervently than usual.
Fingertips then met something so extremely cold that Harry couldn't help but pull away again immediately, as it burned like ice on an open wound. Barely pulled away, the boy suddenly moved as if coming to life again — lifting his head from the ground and staring directly into Harry's eyes.
As he had lain down in bed, the other boys already filling their dorm with loud snores, his mind couldn't stop thinking about the next day. They had kept on practicing the Bubble-Head charm but the result still weren't where they had wanted them to be. With the Lake fully frozen for a few weeks since Christmas, they also had had to move to the Prefect's/Beauxbatons' bathroom to continue their try-outs. Beside from the Bubble-Head charm they had also tried out a few other things that they had found in books. But non of them had worked.
Draco thought to himself as he neared the boy. Harry was dressed from head to toe in red robes combined with brown around the arms and legs, his House's crest on his chest. Draco stopped immediately, only a few feet away from the crimson boy. But it was too late to turn around again and make a run for it; Harry had already seen him. 'Draco' the boy called out as he waved his arm cheerfully. As he came closer, wanting to meet Draco halfway, Draco himself took a few steps back.
There were three more days left until they were leaving Hogwarts, saying good-bye to the memories that hurt him so greatly. Draco didn't dare to face Harry anymore and had spent the entire previous day in his room, thinking about nothing else but the consequences of everything that had happened; losing Harry, Cedric's death and of course Voldemort's rebirth. It was something Draco had never really thought about; about the Dark Lord's return. Of course he had heard his father musing about it a lot of times, but never had he fully thought the day of his return would follow. The future he had always seen for the Wizarding World had been bright as if casted upon by orange-gleaming sunlight. But now it was quite the opposite, really. Dark days would follow, Draco knew. Days where Wizards and Witches wouldn't believe that he was back. Days where they would be confronted with the truth in the most gruesome ways. Days where they would lose their loved ones like Cedric's father had lost his son. Pain, terror, screaming and the poisonous green light of the Killing Curse; would it all be awaiting him once he returned home?
Impressed by Ron's genuine words, Draco felt his cheeks glow. The fact that he could make the most hard-headed person in the Wizarding World change his opinion of him, made him feel like the elegant and sublime Wizard he had always been. '
, Weasel!' The calmness he had wanted Harry to remain, he himself hadn't been able to keep. He looked furious all of the sudden, as if old wounds had been opened with the slightest mention of his last name and that of the
Not even a moment later Hermione shot a spell at the chains that held the dragon hostage; releasing it from its imprisonment. The dragon struggled though, its wings unused for years and heavily scarred. A few failed flaps later and the creature was finally off, flying upward towards the globe of light.
Dumbledore had eventually defended Harry and lifted his suspension so he could return to Hogwarts again in a few weeks — but he hadn't said a word to him at all. He even had avoided any eye-contact and it had become yet another thing for Harry to worry about. Not to mention that strange, dressed-in-pink lady from the Ministry that had been so much against him; that had put him right in Azkaban herself if she could've, just because he had saved his cousin from getting devoured by a Dementor. It had seemed all so strange, her behavior. He had told Draco about her once returned and he immediately seemed to recognize her as the woman he had seen at the Manor only a few weeks ago. 'You must be careful around her, Harry; she's pure evil.'
a boy even though he still looked fairly young — in a little more again, Harry noticed he'd put on a new shirt, one of his. Or at least, it
His mind then wanders off to Pibbly’s announcement; a pair of Aurors are currently in his house. It’s strange, Draco finds, as they’d never cared about him before.
Harry shrugged as a response. 'You're not really giving me a choice when you're holding me like that.' With frowned eyebrows, Draco looked down to see his hand clamped around Harry's wrist; showing a nervosity he didn't knew he had. He quickly let go with a slight rose color appearing on his cheeks.
A dungeon. The smell of mold, the dripping of a leak. Dust covered the once blue tiles a dirty grey and there wasn't a single light lit in the darkness of the cellar. But there was something that made their hearts flicker with hope; the voice of someone they knew. Luna Lovegood appeared out of the dark and as Ron lit up the single torch, her face smiled at them.
' he greeted them. 'Mind if I join you?' Without waiting for an answer, Draco took place opposite the three boys and gave them all a long stare. A silence fell as Harry nor Dean nor Seamus knew what to say. 'Why so silent?'
“An excellent point!” Fred yelled as he and Angelina took turns jumping between the two beds. “A name, we must have a name!” Before Marcus could respond, the door swung open with a bang and a flash of bright white light filled the room.
Potter waited until the waitress was out of earshot before turning to Draco. “I thought you hadn’t been here before?”
“So,” said Draco, dragging his eyes away from Potter. “You picture yourself and Liam the Underwear Model commiserating over the superficial nature of the general public, followed by-”
“Look.” Draco shifted in his chair, tugging Harry around to face him. “My parents are a truly wonderful pair of tyrants who I love very much and do not wish to ever expose you to.” It took Harry a few moments to work out what Draco was on about but he nodded, gesturing for Draco to continue. “I didn’t want to scare you off or, heaven forfend, remind you of how I…how we used to be.”
“Alright. Well, here I am.” Harry spread his arms, plastering on a manic smile. “Oi Snape.” He raised his voice. “It’s time for the grand reveal.”
While Millicent was gagging and chugging Dr Pepper, Cassius’ second spin landed on Katie. The mist turned green, and Harry and Draco added their voices to the catcalling as Cassius sat down next to Katie and gave her a gentle kiss on her bright blue mouth. She grinned - showing off her blue teeth - and offered him one of the Nerds she’d been refusing to share all night. Cassius declined but he stayed on the twin’s bed next to Katie, which resulted in Angelina and Fred switching over to Harry and Draco’s bed.
The kiss was surprisingly nice. Should kisses with old rivals and new teammates be nice? Harry’s train of thought was interrupted as Draco pulled away, his cheeks flushed as his eyes darted across Harry’s face. Unable to shake the feeling that he’d missed something important, Harry settled back against the wall, wiping his mouth with the cuff of his sleeve. Most of the yelling had died down and everyone stared back at Harry. Including Draco.
The thought of spending a few nights in whatever a ‘Travelodge’ was didn’t exactly sound appealing, she mused as the Third year Hufflepuffs attempted to transform their quills into backscratchers. While the Slytherdor team was bound to be a handful, keeping an eye on fourteen teenagers was nothing for a woman used to patrolling the Hogwarts corridors.
“Oh, that’s... okay.” Harry tipped his face up slightly, brushing his lips against Draco’s. “S’good,” he murmured, thrilling at the way Draco sighed against his mouth. “Do you want to, um...”
“Probably 5th year,” Potter readily replied. “It was during the Triwizard Tournament. Cedric suggested that I pay a visit to the Prefects Bathroom, for a bath, you know and-”
“Our financial position may no longer be what it once was but I assure you, my dear boy, that matters are far from desperate.”
“Cheertinis.” Potter swirled the last few soggy Cheerios sitting at the bottom of his glass. “I asked for a recommendation and then I got embarrassed when she asked if I liked it and ordered another.”
“Well,” Malfoy sniffed, retracting into himself and alerting Harry to the fact that they had been sitting rather close. “I suppose that bad temper and self-pity are to be expected. Some people might suggest that a little common courtesy wouldn’t be too much to expect among old school fellowes and bed mates, some might even say—”
“Fuck’s sake.” Harry rubbed his hands over his face. “I told him I was having a quiet night in. How long before—” He was interrupted by the rush of the Floo as Draco and Hermione appeared. Waving cheerfully, Hermione wound her way through the crowd. Ron gave a limp wave in return while Harry sank further into his seat.
“Oh no, not everything is about sex. Unless you’re a fan of feederism, I don’t judge!” She cut a large slice and offered it to him. Smiling in relief, he took the plate and they stood in companionable silence, munching cake.
“Oh, yes, thank you.” Draco grabs the jug, dumping half the contents into his bowl and hastily passing it down the table to… “Ginny?” Had she been sitting next to him all this time?
Groaning quietly to himself, Draco pushed open the door and almost tripped over a free standing cardboard cutout of a monkey that appeared to be offering Draco a bowl of its own liquid faeces.
“You told me he fancied me and that I should ‘ride that Dragon into the sunset’.” Harry felt compelled to point out, wincing as he remembered how hopeful he’d felt after that chat. Not that Harry didn’t know his own mind when it came to Draco, but it had been nice to have his best mate’s approval and—
“Fuck off, Potter," said Draco, turning towards the door. He felt a light tug at his coat, followed by the smack of a falling cereal bowl. He didn’t look back. Behind him Potter shouted Draco’s name again and one of the diners tutted over their spilt cereal. Draco kept walking. He brushed passed the cardboard monkey, felt a sudden hitch behind his belly button, and the world went dark.
Draco chuckled, “You would have been wrong, until very very recently.” His eyes fixed onto Harry’s emerald irises.
“No, continue screaming your head off. Make the job that much easier for everyone out there.” Malfoy lazily looked at his nails, his wand twirling in his other hand.
“Not just any sweet, a sweet that will make those beautiful bruises go away,” George said matter-of-factly.
“Malfoy, what the hell? Get out of here!” Weasley shouted and Draco didn’t even spare him a look as he made a beeline for Harry. He was just a few paces away when he felt hands on his shoulders shoving him backward. “I said, leave! Can’t you see he’s had a bad enough night!”
“Yes?” Harry stared at Malfoy who suddenly ran over to a tree and set a hand against it, bending over, his other hand over his mouth. “What the hell, Malfoy?” Harry ran over, unsure of what to do.
Harry had performed the Patronus Charm the other night like it wasn’t this massive magical feat. Draco had never known anyone of school-age able to perform it, let alone at 14. Draco wondered how long Harry had been able to do it, since it was such a ‘small’ feat in Harry’s eyes. Draco had never realized the spell that had hit him and the other Slytherins at the Quidditch match last year had been a Patronus Charm, but it definitely had not been the fully formed stag that Harry had shown him the other night. Draco only knew a handful of people who could summon a Patronus – full stop. He knew Severus could summon one, but he resolutely refused to ever show it to Draco. Draco was almost positive neither of his parents could, he’d never seen it at any rate.
“Why the fuck did you stay?” Draco spit, turning around to pace in front of where Harry stood, loud cracks echoed through the room as he squeezed each knuckle with his thumbs.
They were silent for awhile and Draco found he wasn’t feeling how he expected to, he had thought being open with Harry would lead to anxiety and vulnerability, instead he just felt closer to Harry.
Harry threw up his hands, “That’s really it! I guess we’re going to have to get past them or something?”
“Can I ask you something?” Malfoy asked shaking his robe out, seemingly as something to do. Harry knew he wasn’t going to put it back on with how wrinkled and dirty it was.
Love you all, thank you times a million bajillion. I send all of the virtual flowers, chocolates, candy, or whatever else tickles your fancy. Yall are the best!
“Ron, there isn’t just straight and gay. It’s a spectrum. There’s a whole myriad of sexualities, and you’re the bad guy because you’re ruining a very special moment with asinine questions about her sexuality! I just can’t believe Luna knew it was going to happen. Maybe Ginny was mistaken that they’ve touched skin to skin since Ginny turned 13. It’s always the first time after you turn 13.”
Draco did fall to his side now, warm blood flowing down his face and into the snow, staining it crimson. Draco was reeling. Father did not normally leave physical marks. He had apparently royally infuriated him.
“Sorry it took me so long, I couldn’t get out of Gryffindor,” He mumbled. “Are you wondering how I did it too?”
"Draco has apologized to me for the things that happened and were said in 1st through 3rd year, and I accepted. He isn't as bad as you think he is, believe me I was skeptical at first too," Hermione said and Draco stuck his tongue out at her.
Dumbledore was staring at Draco, his eyes doing that twinkle thing they so often did. Draco felt the gentlest of nudges against his mental shields, so soft and unobtrusive that he barely noticed the presence before it was too late.
Suddenly, Harry felt an intense stabbing in his chest and he grasped at it, twin pangs of pain blossoming in his knee caps as they bit into the floor of the ward, his legs no longer able to support him. Madam Pomfrey’s eyes grew wide, “What is going on?!” Her voice was shrill, climbing several octaves.
Malfoy laughed before quickly sobering up, “Hi, Harry, I’m Draco and I’m beginning to realize that.” He held out his hand.
Draco did his very best not to show his annoyance, but quickly bottled his potion and cleared his space, his eyes darting around the room. Where had Harry gone? It was like he had apparated away, regardless of how impressive Harry was Draco doubted even he could do that.
going back to the Manor. He had a number of properties he could choose from, but there was still the manner of how he got to them. He also would not be going anywhere without Harry, and that meant getting Dumbledore to okay Harry not returning to his Merlin-forsaken relatives. Draco figured there was a better chance that Voldemort started galivanting with muggles than Dumbledore letting Harry not go back to the Dursleys. Draco would have to figure out a backup plan.
“Last I checked she’s bonded. I could reach out to Daddy Parkinson to draw something up with the second youngest Weasley, if Draco concedes. Come to think of it, I believe all of the other Weasley children are unbonded. Take your pick,” Theo shot back and she flicked egg at him.
Draco stared at him before scrubbing his face, “Of-fucking-course you have an Invisibility Cloak. How did I not realize before? I’m so thick. Outside the Shack, Merlin, help me.” Draco wanted to stomp his foot, but was distracted by Harry laughing. “How do you have one of these? They’re incredibly rare.”
Theo was slightly disappointed he wouldn’t be able to pretend he had no idea about Draco and Potter’s secret bond anymore. It was so nice not having to hear about it. Pansy constantly complained that Draco literally would not shut up about how Potter pretty much shit rainbows and butterflies. It would be fun to make fun of Draco to his face though.
Hermione glared at him immediately, "Yes because I knew you'd act like this! Now keep your voice down!"
** Very very very minor, self harm trigger warning. The moment is very brief, and inadvertent, but I felt a need to warn everyone.**
“Who, indeed?” Hermione commented quietly, sipping her cup of tea. Harry refused to meet her eyes, instead letting them drift over to a certain blond across the room. A rush of warmth filled him as his eyes met grey ones before they quickly flitted away.
“It also seems as though you may have subjected an incapacitated criminal to the Dementor’s Kiss, without a trial. A criminal that assaulted my soul-mate and whom I had planned to file a personal grievance against. That couldn’t be correct could it, Minister? I would hate to take the Malfoy’s normal contribution to the Fudge foundation and put it elsewhere on the basis of incompetence.”
“That’s my tie, Pans,” Draco grit out, dipping her slightly to make her lose the absolute look of delight on her face.
So we get some more interactions between our fave duo and the much-needed handshake scene. I'm just a sucker for first names and hand shakes between these two. Next chapter is Draco's POV! He is so so fun to write so I am very excited for everyone to get to peek into our favorite Slytherin's mind.
Happy New Year everyone! If you're reading this on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day or whenever, we made it through 2020. I hope you are safe, happy, and healthy. I read this and thought it was fitting but, "I hope your thoughts stay positive and your tests stay negative".
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, crossing his arms tightly across his chest. Pomfrey had given him a long-sleeved hospital gown that covered up to his neck.
How did you like the Task? The image of just this absolutely desperate and terrified Draco just brought the feels, I'm not gonna lie. The next chapter is the aftermath, *spoiler alert* Draco is as subtle as a flying brick, if you catch my drift.
Draco looked up at her, his hand still holding her scarf to his face. It had once been a red tartan, but was now a deep reddish brown. His skin was almost devoid of all colour besides the stain of blood down his nose and chin.
Draco’s smile came back. “That’s great! I think it’s a brilliant plan! It’s about time an adult paid you some attention and worried about your well-being.”
Draco hurried away from Severus’ quarters; he noticed the pain in his leg had disappeared. Hopefully Pomfrey had done something to the injury. That had been excruciating and Draco was glad for it to be gone.
Draco grit his teeth and closed the distance between the two of them. He caught Harry’s hands in his, ignoring the slight pain the magic emitting from them was causing him, and clenched them tightly. “I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere. You’re stuck with me, Potter.”
“Well that’s another thing we have to consider. Unless they plan on stealing you,” Hermione teased and Draco whipped around to stare at her, eyes wide. She looked at Draco in confusion for a moment before she realized what she said. “No! They couldn’t put children at the bottom of a lake for an hour, that’d be insane!”
Harry choked on his orange juice again and resolved that he should probably just quit liquids altogether. “Er, yeah. Who would keep a soul-mark secret?”
They filed into the stands, and waited for the Task to begin. Draco could see a white tent like at the First task that he presumed the champions were waiting in. Finally, they filed out after Dumbledore and the rest of the Tournament organizers.
Harry had been hurt at first when Draco had made him aware of them before they were debuted, but thankfully had found some humour in them. He had also liked Draco’s idea of playing up how upset they made him, hoping to show to those running the tournament how incredibly fucked up it was that they were forcing him to compete.
Draco’s jaw was clenched more often than not now-a-days. His patience was also abnormally thin. He was snapping at his Housemates constantly, and was mostly quiet when Harry and he were able to spend time together. Harry attributed it to the stress and the more time Draco was spending with his Housemates. Harry had been busy most nights between school work, training, and trying to spend time with Ron and his other friends.
Harry rolled his eyes and cast his Patronus. Draco stared at the gorgeous stag, still not comprehending. “My Patronus takes after my dad.”
“Harry?” Draco rasped, his voice soft and raw from sleep. Harry tried to respond, but found he couldn’t seem to find the words. Why couldn’t he respond? He wanted to, desperately.
“Don’t heal it,” Draco demanded, the volume returning to his voice, the tone more similar to what Hermione expected from him. “I want everyone to see what Lucius Malfoy does to his son.”
“I’m surprised there hasn’t been more bondings this year, with all the extra students here,” Hermione mused, stirring her eggs mindlessly around her plate.
Draco shrugged, “There’s no point anymore. I was not subtle at all at the Task, and now we’ve both been missing for 2 days. Most people will be able to put two and two together.”
“Theo!” Pansy called suddenly and Draco looked up to see Theo approaching, something was off about the way he was holding himself. He seemed anxious if Draco didn’t know any better.
“Honestly, I think it’s majorly fucked up that they took that little girl. I’m glad Potter brought her up,” Pansy said, Draco was surprised that there was ascent through the group at her defiant words. Draco’s love for her grew slightly. He could also still feel the simmering anger through the bond and was incredibly curious as to what it was about.
“Do you want some water?” Draco asked, reaching for a cup on the table his glasses had been placed. Harry nodded and did his best to lean up to take a drink. Draco wrapped an arm around his back, hefting him upwards to help him. With anyone else Harry probably would have been incredibly embarrassed, but somehow, he wasn’t when it came to Draco.
“Spread out and look for the perpetrator, they could not have gotten far!” Crouch called out, immediately shoving through the trees next to them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione forgotten.
Ginny glared at him, “What, just because they’re both girls they can’t be anything but platonic? They’re lesbians, Ronald. Imogen has been out for awhile.”
Draco started pacing again, twiddling his hands, but Harry noticed he had not touched his wand or brought it out at all.
The pain had vanished from the bond and Draco carefully pressed against his chest pretending to scratch his pectoral. There was no return warmth as there normally was but Draco also had a pretty thick jumper on today and wouldn’t be surprised if Harry hadn’t even felt it. Harry must still be so far away, Draco could barely feel anything except the exhaustion that was ever present nowadays.
“Well, sue me for having morals!” Harry said throwing his hands up. Hermione laughed at him and he couldn’t help smiling as well. “Believe me; I’m not doing anything to bring on what happened last night again. It wasn’t a walk in the park for me either! I had no idea how serious it had gotten for Draco.”
He made his way through the stacks, looking for a specific potions book. He turned down an aisle and saw Longbottom paging through a tome. Draco peeked at the title and figured it could be useful.
Harry finally spoke, the emotions inside of him a vicious whirl, “I didn’t grow up in a home like yours. Obviously not in size or whatever, but other stuff too. I live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin, but they hate me. They think magic is unnatural, that I’m a freak. I didn’t even know I was a wizard until my 11th birthday when Hagrid broke into the shack my Uncle had dragged us to to avoid the owls with my letter, and told me so. I grew up thinking my parents died in a car crash. That my father had been drinking. They hate anything that’s out of the ordinary. We live in a two floor house with three bedrooms in it, which looks exactly like every other house on the street. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs until I got my letter. Then they gave me Dudley’s second bedroom. Mostly because I think they were worried I would blow them up if they didn’t.
That was how Hermione found them, they had, of course, sprung apart the second the door opened, but Harry could tell from her smirk that she had seen. Draco took a few steps away from Harry, and Harry could see part of the Draco he had come to see in classes and when Draco was around his housemates, fall into place like a mask. Harry hoped eventually Draco could be the person Harry knew in front of company that didn’t include just himself. His head was held high, his shoulders back, posture perfect.
“Yeah, you’re probably right, Dray,” Pansy agreed, she reached out and grasped a lock of his hair, twirling it around her finger. “What’s made you suddenly wear your hair down? Not that I’m complaining. You look brilliant.”
Hermione very hesitantly reached over and pressed her pointer finger against the bundle of twigs. They both gasped as she made contact.
“Shall we go?” He asked offering his arm. She accepted it and they strode off towards the Great Hall, most of the other Slytherins slowly making their way upstairs as well.
“I just feel like Hermione and I are kind of growing up and leaving him behind a little, at least relationship wise. It doesn’t help that he’s gone for Hermione and won’t even say anything. At least he’s being respectful. I definitely thought he would have said some shit about Krum by now.”
“We live in a hetero-normative, traditional, conservative society, that’s why. Technically you could bring a man; people just assume you’d only want to bring a girl. Regardless, one day we will go to a Ball together and we will dance, okay?”
Hermione walked with the group, keeping an eye out for Ginny and Luna. She had promised to meet up with them, but had sent them on ahead of her. Hermione pulled her scarf more tightly around her throat. It was quite chilly and the wetness just seemed to seep into her bones.
“Merry Christmas,” Harry whispered pressing his lips to Draco’s. Draco couldn’t hold in his grin as he kissed him back and pulled away.
“Of course, be safe,” Draco said wishing, for once, he could pull his godfather into an embrace. Severus did reach out and squeeze his shoulder again before releasing him and exiting the room without a backwards glance.
FYI everyone, I don't normally do a POV change in the middle of a chapter, but I had to here to get things to fit how I wanted. Also a special treat, the POV change is to Hermione's. Enjoy yall.
“You will be silent,” Father commanded. Draco barely had a moment to brace himself before he felt the Cruciatus hit him and he fell to his knees in agony. Draco bit down on his lip to keep from screaming, knowing it would only make Father angrier and the pain last longer. Father cast the curse in short spurts as to not leave lasting damage. Draco felt the cold seeping into his trousers as he knelt in the snow, barely able to keep himself from falling into a heap in the slush.
“Lucius was not pleased with me,” Draco shrugged, like it didn’t matter, and finished getting ready for the day.
Hermione snorted; he was definitely okay. She shifted towards the door. “I’ll let you two have some alone time, I’ll go run interference with Ron. I’m glad you’re okay, Draco.”
Harry glared at him. Confused and frustrated with how he was feeling. Harry was worried. Anxiety tightened at his chest as he kept reliving Malfoy being slammed against the ground over and over. He knew there were more injuries hiding beneath Malfoy's uniform.
“Yes! Wait, yes! Charlie said something about them wanting only dragons that were mothers and even brought their nests along with them!”
“What standards?! You’re still doing really well in your classes, we don’t have Quidditch, what else is there?”
“Yeah there was a green one, a red one, a silvery-blue one that only breathed blue fire, and then a massive black one with spikes on its tail. Charlie said the names, but I can’t remember what they were. No Norwegian Ridgebacks, I know that,” Harry said shooting a smirk at Draco.
Ron looked like he had been hit upside the head with a heavy weight, “Er, yeah, of course. You don’t have to ask…”
So, my apologies to those of you who wanted Hermione and Krum to bond. I have never liked their relationship. An 18 year old adult wizard, dating a 15 year old never sat right with me. I also have other plans for Hermione, just be patient. :D
“Call even more attention to yourself, Weasley, why don’t you?” A sneering voice came from their right. Harry turned to see Malfoy leaning casually against a tree. He was glaring at the group of them.
“That’s different. For his dad to have hit him like that, that’s messed up. Mum spanked me once when I was little, but you don’t hit your kids. Especially not once they’re old enough to go to school. That’s bang out of line,” Ron looked at Harry seriously, seeming like he wanted to say more. Harry wondered if Ron’s mind was drifting to the bars they had pulled off his bedroom window, or the letters pleading to send food if possible. He looked down at his eggs, hoping Ron would drop it. Harry was on edge already; he really didn’t want to talk about the Dursleys.
“Mr. and Mr. Weasley my office immediately!” McGonagall shouted over the din, her voice carrying in that way that was unique to a professor that had taught for most of their adult life. They simultaneously bowed before hopping off the table and leaving the hall.
“Ron, please slow down, we can’t keep up,” Hermione gasped, tugging hard on Ron’s arm. Ron stopped abruptly, staring at Hermione and Harry for a second before glancing around quickly at the trees.
Harry rolled his eyes at him, and pulled Draco roughly against his chest. “Of course, you fucking can. I’m not furious with you, really, I’m just furius in general. I also don’t like it when people yell at me, I get sort of defensive.”
“Harry, are you all right?” Longbottom asked, jogging over towards where Harry was trying to get to his feet.
“I’ve been trained my whole life to always be perfectly put together, always say the perfect thing, be the perfect gentlemen. In just a few months you’ve completely undone me, Harry.”
“Of course he is, probably to lecture me about my last potion. Someone here got me distracted,” Draco tickled Pansy in an effort to keep his hands from fidgeting. He stood up slowly, carefully sliding Pansy off of his lap. “I ought to go now so he doesn’t make a scene tomorrow.”
Lastly, yes Harry is definitely someone who says 'no worries' a lot for someone full of many many worries.
Mrs. Weasley stared at him in wonder before shaking herself, "I accept your apology on behalf of my family. You need not worry about owning up to the mistakes of your father, Draco.”
“What is going on? Who’s doing that?” Harry asked trying to keep up with the group of Weasley’s, who were practically sprinting towards the wooded area next to the campground.
Draco returns when he’s poured two new cups and placed them on the kitchen counter. He murmurs some thanks and leans against the counter across from Harry, closing his eyes to savour the first sip.
“Don’t come in!” he croaks, resting his elbows on the rim and his face on his hands. Oh, to be sitting on the floor in front of the toilet. Today has been as humbling as yesterday.
Ron and Hermione’s garden is a slice of paradise no matter the season. Seeing it still brings back lovely thoughts of earlier days, before they’d all gotten sucked a bit deeper into their individual lives. Harry had flattened the land and laid the stone pathways. Hermione had charmed the pergola into shape. Neville provided all the landscaping and planted the apple tree. Ron cleaned out the shed until he found the spiders, then stuck to supervising the operation. Then they’d spent their summer nights in the oasis they’d built.
“Yes, I did and now he’s too smitten to think straight and we’re sitting in a hospital room. The situation at hand has changed. I’m just doing my due diligence.”
True to his prediction, Harry bounds past him from his bedroom moments later in shorts and a t-shirt, stopping to tell him there’ll be lunch in ten minutes, tops. “Wear the blue,” he says, hesitating in the doorway. He’s pointing to a sky-blue tee. “I’ve never said, but you look good in colours. Live a little.” He winks and is gone.
As he finishes, he glances at Harry with a glint in his eye, and there’s that perfect light-speed conversation he knew they were capable of. He’s buzzing with intensity, and Harry doesn’t need to be told that it’s time. When ‘
He’s thankful that news of his temporary arrest and Potter-induced release hadn’t made the papers. Pansy and Blaise had been in a panic. He’d stood silent on the lift up, seeing red, sure that if he even began trying to thank Potter the world would implode. Or worse, Potter would try to make casual conversation as if it wasn’t the worst night of Draco’s year, and he’d curse him right on Ministry property, deserved or otherwise.
“The timeline is so fascinating,” Draco gushes. He’s shining in a way even Harry hardly sees. It’s like a thrumming liveliness. “And it’s so…
“What?” Harry whispers, a hand sitting on his thumping heart. “God almighty, Draco, you could’ve just
It sounds like an order. His posture instantly grows rigid and when there’s a long moment where nothing is said, Draco realises that he’s waiting expectantly for confirmation.
“Did he do it?” Jack sits entranced, hanging on Harry’s every word like he’s just missing a bucket of popcorn.
Draco clearly tries to hide just how excited he is at Harry’s progress, but he still catches a glimpse of enjoyment on his face when he does especially well. It’s entertaining to watch him vacillate between excited friend and objective teacher. It’s also commendable—he’s certainly not as impartial during fight training.
“We’ve joked,” he says, suddenly intent on conveying sincerity and openness, “but we never talked about this again. Or about why…”
Harry slowly sets his cup down on the saucer next to him, moving infinitesimally like someone careful not to wake a sleeping beast.
“Fine, then… consider it an exchange of information. We’ll trade. Keep it even, just how you like it.”
Harry reaches his hand out towards the blackness under the bed a little nervously but feels nothing. He pushes up onto his feet. Draco had stopped doubling back over his tracing by the third floor.
Hermione’s case had been a yearlong process, during which Ron had taken on many nights of putting Rose to bed alone and losing his wife to the library. A win would mean rights for non-Being creatures with sentience like Centaurs to seek medical care at the hospital. It would be precedent-setting.
“If you don’t mind, though, I’m talking to my friend right now,” Harry interjects between the woman’s hurried compliments, pointing in his direction.
“Maybe I’ll just go,” he finally says, incredibly, as if Harry hasn’t stunned him across a London street at midnight.
His eyes widen in understanding. Perhaps he’d known from the moment Hermione mentioned a specialist but pushed it to the back of his brain.
Murray. Harry barely breathes a goodbye to Tim, wills the lift to move double-time, and moves past Yolanda upstairs without so much as a word. He knocks but enters without waiting.
Draco groans, lowering his forehead to the mattress. “I miss when I didn’t care about your survival.”
to help, he’d said, “Brilliant! Cyril Denis from Denis & Flavius is the defence lawyer. He never listens to a word I say. You’ll be a perfect stand-in.”
He’s not sure if Draco is always this pale or especially so. His eyes are closed, hair fallen back in a way disarmingly removed from the professional, put-together appearance Harry is often presented. He sits folded on the ground a moment longer in disbelief, before whispering, “Oh, right,” and scrambling to point his wand gently at the unconscious man once again. “
