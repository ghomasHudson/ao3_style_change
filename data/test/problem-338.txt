He opened his mouth to try to talk, but was cut short by Malfoy, who was standing up, and Harry followed his steps and got to his feet, his neck still craned from the wand harassing it.
to get in trouble, don't you see?!" Said Hermione, but still sounding confused "I just don't understand
"I-I,, Thank y-you H-H-Harry" The blonde said the last part more lowly, finally looking at him in the eye, reminding the Gryffindor of a scared kitten ready to flee at any moment from danger.
He looked like a polar bear he had seen in an informative leaflet desperately trying to stay on the gradually melting iceberg, but ultimately accepting his eventual extinction.
Draco said carefully, the smile staying on his lips as he could only stare at Harry's parted lips, shame boiling inside his gut from being so close to another man but he could also feel something more threatening ready to slip at any moment, something he had been hiding from way too long.
People treating him like dirt because he's a wizard, people wanting to be his friends only because his parents were killed to save him, people calling him a murderer and the one behind the basilisk attacks, people calling him crazy for believing Sirius is innocent and finally, people blaming him for taking part in a dangerous tournament without him wanting to.
Harry was cut off again, this time by three loud knocks on the door by Malfoy's pale hands. He made a mental note of how the dark oak wood contrasted against the Slytherin's milky skin alongside the dark fabric of his school robe. He also took the gesture as a sign that this was not the right time to talk about it.
"What, Potter? Your pea sized brain still can't comprehend that you were outmatched again?" The blonde said as his voice cracked a bit, probably as he had by now understood his situation and was hoping the other boy hadn't noticed, his face pale again.
The blonde didn't even dare to look up at him, now he was just looking at his boots lost in deep thought, his wand still out and now lazily pointing at his chest.
His voice trembled a bit as he tried to understand the other's intentions, feeling his heart pounding against his chest.
Suddenly, as the Gryffindor was boosting off animatedly how many people he had won today at Wizarding Chess with one-hand movements, the Hufflepuff took ahold of his other hand that was resting on the table.
Draco Malfoy but...Harry couldn't understand why he did that. He looked over to the Slithering table and his eyes fell on a certain blonde. Draco's and his eyes met for a few seconds before the Slithering
"This is going to be a long night, try to relax Malfoy…" the Gryffindor sighed as he rubbed his eyes with his defined fingers, the vains covering the tendons and showing.
The blonde said while getting on his feet. Harry was frozen. He wanted to tell Draco he didn't want him to leave. He wanted to wrap his arms around him and comfront him. How could he had thought Malfoy was planning something evil up here?
"DON'T FUCKING TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!!!! IF YOU HADN'T BEEN SUCH AN ASSHOLE ALL THOSE YEARS TO ME AND MY FRIENDS, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE AT ALL!!!!!!" Potter screamed as he walked closed, now the desk the blonde was leaning on falling on the floor and breaking and the blackboard hanging on a nearby wall trembling as the screws holding it there went flying off.
intentions of the two of them taking a bath (or maybe something more?) Harry thought to himself which made him blush
Harry could smile if he didn't want to look suspicious. Still, the corners of his mouth twitched up rebellious to his intentions. It was rather fun that McGonagall was exposing Malfoy now, and Harry could see from how his teeth were grinding ever so slightly that he was not happy about that.
"Did you manage to tame my hair ex-ferret?" Potter said with a half smirk that had the potential of a Slytherin.
she added dramatically looking at Harry, as if he wasn't expecting this new approach having a twist for the worse.
Potter's hair actually looked half decent when the right hands were used. In this case, a blonde spoiled brat's ones.
When he heard the name Cho Chang, he remembered different moments of her, Cho eating a croissant, Cho on the Quidditch field holding her broomstick, Cho catching the snitch, Cho looking at him, Cho smiling at him, Cho talking to him.
Draco said the password which was "Extrafine Ash", and they entered the luxurious bathroom full of marble.
"Thank Merlin Voldemort hasn't killed me yet, so I could live to see Draco Malfoy, who has the perfect grades, worry about a stupid degree" Harry jokingly said finally looking at Draco, still wanting nothing but helping him feel better.
He looked down at his lap and let his thoughts roam, while carefully listening to the other's shuffling around to make sure he didn't wake up out of the blue and ran away.
He thought to himself. But the situation had only gotten "worse" Harry would say. Malfoy was almost being nice to them, you could say. Harry shook his head with disbelief. Malfoy would never act like that, he thought. It was probably another one of his pranks, he would act as his friend for a while and then laugh at Harry's face the minute after Harry would show any weakness. And Harry wouldn't let him do that anymore. He already had enough problems on his one, he didn't need Draco's instability at his life. But did he?
"I wanted to see if your stupid mop of hair could be tamed, don't be so sore Potter" Malfoy said to Potter's back now as he pretended like it wasn't just an excuse to touch Potter's hair to see what would happen.
Draco still hadn't told Harry where he was taking him, and all Harry could do was speculate. Well, that was until he saw a familiar door with the sign of
He turned around again, before raising his head off the pillow and flipping it to the cooler side before letting it fall again.
The raven haired boy blinked at him multiple times, his eyes wide like saucers over his flushed red cheeks, which only made them seem even greener in the dim lit class.
Harry's whole body was on fire,his face was red, his prick was begging him for any kind of friction and Draco was staring at him with his deep grey eyes, those delicate pink lips and his porcelain like skin and thousands of water droplets on him.
All resistance Harry has been putting up was now gone as he was hyperaware of Draco's body against him, feeling more blood pump through him with every beat of his heart as his arms sloppily let go of the other boy.
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, what did you two do again? Do you find it that hard to keep your hands off eachother!?" Mcgonagall barged through the door furiously.
"D-Don't call her Malfoy, I just wanted to see if y-you're okay…" Harry said before he could stop himself. He took off his Invisibility Cloak with a sigh, his face flushed both from the unusual appearance of the blonde -those damn silk pyjamas suited him like a glove- and from embarrassment.
But Harry saw the uncertainty in his face, the terror in his eyes because of what that reaction of his meant. If he was lucky, he felt some sexual attraction to women, but from the lack of interest in them except for cronies made Harry think that Malfoy wasn't lucky in that department, but by how desperately he tried to seem even the tiniest bit of intimidating and how mortified by it and shocked he was after Harry noticed his issue, it was clear as day for Harry.
Ksjsjaksksksjnsbs i have very inconsistent update schedule,, but,, anyways here's your dose of queer horny teenagers being too horny for their own good once more ;)
"What Potter? Too impressed by my brains to talk, are you?" The blonde said too confidently, a smirk on his lips.
No one heard his muffled panting outside of the Hospital Wing as Madam Pomfrey treated a pale first year that had an slight accident with a cuting charm, but ended up with a back injury from the fainting.
Harry just stood there looking at her go, not knowing if he should go after her or leave her alone. The whole Gryffindor table was looking at him, judging him merciless even if most of them had called Hermione names behind her back. The news about Hermione's outburst spread around the Great Hall like bonfires, and in fifteen minutes the whole room was buzzing with rumors and remarks, judges of everything being Harry's classmates and friends.
"He's supposed to be with you at the boys' dorms!! Could he have gotten lost maybe!??? How will we tell Snape his godson is dead Blaise!??!" Pansy babbled incoherently as she pulled at her hair and frowned.
Malfoy grabbed Harry's both wrists gently but firmly and they locked eyes, Malfoy serious as ever before he moved a bit closer to his face, his eyes flickering down at Harry's lips and the faint freckles painting his cheeks.
"Malfoy…" Potter said quietly as if it was just another name, as if it didn't carry the dozens of fights and insults they had thrown to each other, and the blonde snapped back to reality to look at him.
He wanted to see Harry. He wanted to tell him that he didn't care about his injury or that they were supposed to hate each other or that he was supposed to marry a pure-blood rich woman and have a hier or that there was a war ready to break out.
The blonde started,e though he could feel his throat starting to burn again and his breath getting heavier he continued
He felt like they were roasting him over a fire, but in a more pleasant way if that made much sense.
Harry was pacing away from the library after hearing Ron complain once more about Krum. The first task was in 6 days and Ron still didn't believe him when he said he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire
He said concentrating as to not start hugging him again, out of fear he wouldn't be able to leave the Slitherin's arms.
He asked tiredly. His whole body was hurting, his head was killing him and his legs felt heavier than ever. He thought of just going back to sleep, but he remembered how that Christmas day escalated and blinked rapidly to not fall asleep again.
Harry grunted as he picked up his things from the ground. He just realized he would have to finish his homework by himself
she looked sternly yet again at Malfoy that was using his self control she talked earlier to not start spewing insults at her for daring to compare him to the Gryffindork.
"Dobby, I need you to tell me the truth. Were you spying on me for someone Dobby?" Harry said sternly. Dobby probably didn't want to do him harm, but he was often naive to people's intentions.
"Dobby has promised not to say to Harry Potter who has sent him, but Dobby can assure Harry Potter, it is a friend of Harry Potter"
Harry had hugged him in an attempt to stop his self-hating speech, and the silence from the blonde's side seemed to prove he did the right thing, since now he was trying not to go on full panic mode because
The blonde stare at him mesmerised. His unbuttoned Gryffindor robes that were a bit small on him, his red and gold tie that was made too tigh and asymmetrical, his black baggy trousers, his unruly like always raven black hair that framed his face, his striking emerald eyes that looked greener than every tree and precious stone Draco had ever seen, his thin round glasses that made him seem even more of a dork than he already was and his pink lips matching his flushed cheeks from the Slytherin's prolonged silence.
‘It’s surprisingly difficult to spot. Often such memories are all linked to a particular event or person or even place. They might be spread out across a long period of time in small chunks so that you’re not even aware of it. I think you’ve made enough progress in trusting me that we can give it a go.’ He was scribbling away in that stupid notebook again. Draco wanted to burn it.
‘Why are you asking so many questions? He’s here because you just came back from school and we both missed you and wanted to see you.’ Draco mentally thanked Harry for not spilling the beans like he often did. He was always soft on the kid – not that Draco could blame him.
But he also knew that the Ministry couldn’t always be trusted to do the right thing. It was also inundated with the extra workload that had built up during and after the war. How did he know the fox wouldn’t just be abandoned for more important things?
“What? And having two massive black things swiping across my field of vision every few seconds is better?!”
‘He keeps writing me letters. I think he writes them to you too. I assumed that because he wrote us separate ones maybe he wanted to tell us about different things.’ He sniffled. His tears had tried but there was a weariness in his demeanour that shook Draco. ‘At first they were quick notes like he scribbled between classes. He just said he was having a great day and he’d tell me all about it later. But then…’
‘Why did you have such a hard time telling me about your anxiety and your magic trouble? What did I do to make you think you couldn’t trust me?’ Draco was surprised he hadn’t asked that question sooner. He never did have the balls to take Harry to his mind healer appointments, although with the help of Smith he had begun to understand where his issues had become so deeply rooted.
Draco started crying some time during Harry’s little speech, but by the end he was both laughing and crying and could only imagine how disgusting his face looked. A greater Slytherin than him would’ve left Harry kneeling there on the cold for even longer, just to memorise the terror in his eyes at the prospect Draco might say no. Draco had no intention of that though, he never wanted to go another day without Harry either.
‘Hi! You must be Draco!’ There in front of him stood Leggy-Blonde. She was wearing the skimpiest spaghetti strap top and jean shorts and Draco thought it was highly inappropriate around a child. He’d almost completely forgotten about Harry’s stupid girlfriend with everything that’d happened between him and Harry recently.
His stomach flipped when he realised Lyra had rested his head in her lap. Every inch of his body felt awkward. What should he say? What was he supposed to do? They’d kissed a few times, but if he was honest, he didn’t really know how she felt, and he was way too scared to ask; she wasn’t really that affectionate a person. She’d definitely never done anything like that before. But then the unthinkable happened. He was trying very hard to stay completely still, too afraid to open his eyes, when he felt her fingers run through his hair.
‘Exactly, Harry! Each of them were sedated when they were admitted into St Mungo’s to slow the effects of the aconite. We wouldn’t have found anything unusual about seeing valerian in the samples because the healers had given them doses of it themselves!’
‘Be careful, Draco. All this secrecy, this is how it started last time.’ He sighed, he knew she was right.
‘I decided,’ Teddy started. Draco glanced sideways at him, but he didn’t stop what he was doing. ‘I don’t think I’m too cool for hugs anymore.’ He clung onto Draco’s waist awkwardly from beside him and Draco nearly dropped the plate in his hands.
‘This might well be the most awkward thing that’s ever happened to me.’ Draco admitted. Harry finally let go and wandered over to the kitchen and put the kettle on. Most likely just for something to do. ‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for this to happen.’ Draco said. They’d come to a tentative truce the day before and Draco didn’t want it to be ruined. Harry sighed deeply, and his shoulders slumped as he leant against the bench.
‘Jesus Christ, Harry. Remind me to never, ever, let you name our kids.’ That was the worst alias name he’d ever heard in his life.
“Yeah, well. I’m a criminal, aren’t I.” She said in a low tone. It crushed him to see her frown and turn away from him, to be so dismissive of herself.
It was the 24th when Draco had been poisoned, that was thirteen days after those photographs. Had Harry broken up with Wood because of Draco? If he had, was it because he wanted to care
Granger pondered this for a second before turning her gaze away from the Veil. “I say the wand. There’ll be no point trying it on you if the magic doesn’t take to the wand.” Draco nodded, trying to ignore the feeling that he was being submerged in water. He really didn’t like it down here.
‘The quidditch match! How could I have forgotten? We had a good catch up that day. So much has happened since that it hardly seemed relevant. Where did you get that from anyway? I haven’t had a subscription for years. Speaking of quidditch, Bill told me Ginny is worried the Harpies won’t renew her contract in the new season. Can you believe it?’ Distracting from the subject – strike three.
‘I’m sorry,’ he said a little sheepishly. He couldn’t understand what had happened. Hermione had just left and he’d been drinking his tea, how had he-?
“They’ll have to do,” he sighed, and handed the two slips back to her. “Wouldn’t you rather be a Meg March?”
Harry didn’t react. Draco could feel the seconds tick by as slow as Harry’s much-loved treacle. Harry was rejecting him, wasn’t he? He didn’t want Draco here. Just as he was about to pull away and roll away from him, Harry’s hand came to rest over Draco’s and his heart stuttered. He held his breath as if any movement would make Harry pull away again.
‘Thank you, Draco. You look wonderfully handsome as always. Pansy my dear, let me take your jacket.’ And off the pair of them went, leaving Draco standing in the hallway. It wasn’t like he needed to be shown the way. He let himself reacquaint himself with his surroundings. The hallway remained warm and open as he remembered. They’d lined the hall with hard wood when the kids were small so that they wouldn’t traipse mud through the house when they’d been playing outside. The coat rack Harry had fixed to the wall lopsidedly was filled with the family’s jackets; it was midsummer so there were no coats this time. Draco had thrown a fit when he’d realised Harry hadn’t put it up straight, but Harry claimed it added charm.
“Draco could help you look for it though, couldn’t you?” Pansy interjected lightly. She seemed far too bright and interested for someone who detested anything remotely close to hard work or magical theory. He wondered what it was the two of them found to talk about.
Harry had been observing the sky. The blue was turning slowly grey and cloud had started looming over them. It seemed Harry would have to take over again soon, although prising Draco out of the driver’s seat would be a challenge in itself.
‘Let us do that, you start getting ready. You need the head start.’ Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t argue and headed upstairs.
Harry was still woken up regularly at five in the morning by Aspen pouncing on top of him, trying to dig through the duvet and screaming with what Harry presumed was excitement.
“What? No! Don’t put words into my mouth. I wouldn’t be here unless I really needed to be!” Harry winces when his words came out very differently than he intended. Malfoy looks furious. There’s a vein throbbing down the side of his neck which is flushed bright red. His eyes however are glacial as he stares Harry down.
How much isolation can the human consciousness withstand before it starts to deteriorate? How long on average does the neurotypical prisoner survive before being slowly eaten alive from the inside, driven mad by the inner thought? These questions are not ones that Draco could answer, although he would’ve liked to have studied the concept while he had the chance.
Like the way Draco’s eyes subtly changed colour when he was happy or sad or angry. How he feigned cold aloofness while helping the first years with their Charms homework at the Slytherin table over breakfast. The way he always noticed when Draco entered a room or left it.
He didn’t know what made him do it. He never really wanted to hurt Potter. He hated the git for being everything Draco could never be, but he never wanted to harm him. It was a reflex, words coming out of his mouth he thought his father would expect him to say, a curse the Dark Lord would expect him to use. ‘Cruc-’
” His breath was ragged after his tirade, and Pansy sat staring at him with her mouth hanging open. It was perhaps an overreaction, but he had put far too much into this plan to throw it all away now, not just for himself but for Granger and Potter too.
The clock on Draco’s bedside table read 4:12 am. That explained the darkness. There was a note on the table he hadn’t seen before. With the arm that wasn’t currently stuck under Teddy, he carefully reached out and plucked up the note. His eyesight wasn’t quite good enough to read the note in the dark, but he did his best.
‘Is that all? From my notes I can see that you never wanted for anything as a child.’ Draco looked at Smith indignantly.
“Aspen,” Harry said quietly, “do you know the forest in the dreams?” Harry’s heart felt as though it could burst at any moment, with excitement or fear he couldn’t quite tell. The fox’s silver eyes blazed. He keened with affirmation.
Smith was wittering on about mind spells even though Hermione was standing right behind Draco saying the exact opposite. He couldn’t see her, but he assumed Smith could. Despite this disadvantage, her voice still echoed around his head.
‘You would’ve what? Come running back? No, you wouldn’t.’ Knowing Harry though, he probably would have, and it all would have ended up so much worse. Draco was in a bad place back then. ‘I took my own memories away. I didn’t see another way to make them stop. I don’t remember the spell I used, it’s probably all kinds of illegal anyway.’ Harry wiped the stray tears from his face but left his hand there, cupping Draco’s jaw.
He wasn’t allowed to brew anymore. Not because it required magic as such, at the end of the day it was still very much similar to muggle cooking. However, should anything go wrong, his inability to use magic would become as issue quite quickly. Whilst he would usually be far too stubborn to admit defeat, he could well imagine it wouldn’t bode well for his relationship with Harry if he endured yet another near-death experience.
Their eyes met once more. “I want you to kiss me.” The steady determination in his voice as he said it broke something in Harry and leant forwards and captured Draco’s lips hungrily. He imagined this was what sunshine would taste like if such a thing were possible. A different kind of warmth flooded through Harry as Draco met his kiss with equal fervour.  Somewhere in the back of Harry’s mind he had half expected Draco to be a tentative kisser, although he should have known better.
“How did you- what are you-” He couldn’t string a full sentence together to save his life. She knelt in front of him and turned the cool cloth over and pressed it back to his forehead and he sighed involuntarily.
Somehow, he’d never been able to bring himself to leave. He supposed that said a lot about how he felt about the whole thing, but he was never quite willing to admit defeat and buy somewhere more permanent. This flat was small and cramped and half of his stuff was probably ruined now that it had spent three years under a shrinking charm, but he’d done his best to make this place a home.
He didn’t know how long he’d been crying on the floor, but long after the sun set and he sat alone in the darkness, he heard a clank from outside the door. He lifted his head and waited a few minutes as footsteps retreated down the stairs. He stood and opened the door a crack to find a plate of food set on the floor. He shut the door again. He didn’t want it.
thing. You think you’re so much better than me just because you got that stupid scar and have the whole world fawning all over you!’
‘Harry isn’t Head Auror anymore.’ She cut in. If Draco’s head hadn’t been spinning before, it certainly was now.
‘You know I’m not always right and you should never apologise for coming to see me. Honestly, you have enough to say about Gryffindors but you’re being the most Gryffindor person I’ve ever met. Don’t be so stupid. I love you and I want to help you. We all do. When are you going to get that through your thick skull?’ He sighed and squeezed her tighter for a brief moment before stepping away.
‘And have the Ministry be snooping around in our business too? It had too much personal stuff in it. The divorce, and parts of the case and everything I feel for you now and you’re such an intensely private person that I couldn’t bear the thought of your business being splashed across the papers. He’s been blackmailing me ever since. I didn’t want to tell you because you already had so much going on but that also meant that he knew I didn’t want to announce we were back together, so he kept making me go to events with him, imply that we were an item. I managed to get a few of the articles pulled but it didn’t always work. I’m sorry. Really, I am. Maybe I could’ve gone about things better but fuck… you know I’m bad at this.’
Eventually, the shock wore off and the world started to return to normal. It was still bizarre to see Lyra wandering around his kitchen making him a cup of tea like she’d been there a hundred times before, but the warm fuzzy feeling the familiarity of her movements gave him was enough to offset his confusion.
‘Honestly, Harry. Don’t you read? That’s the Gallery of Kings. It represents the 28 kings of Judah.’ Harry looked at him blankly. ‘Descendants of Abraham? Ancestors of Jesus?’
Draco stormed up the stairs and went straight to Harry. He barged his way into their bedroom where he threw the phone at Harry. He was sitting on their bed arranging the photos they’d taken over Christmas into an album.
If Draco had told Potter the truth about how he really felt, would it have been enough to make him stay? Or would it only have tipped him over the edge sooner? Draco supposed most people wouldn’t want a failed Death Eater mooning over them. Why would Potter have been any different?
to wander into their flat? As far as he knew, they hadn’t left any doors or windows open, and foxes didn't just appear out of nowhere. His instincts told him there was something purposeful about the new arrival.
By the third month of Draco’s agreement with Hermione, work was becoming unbearable. One Wednesday afternoon, he found himself sprinting up from the labs to Harry’s office.
Teddy lived with Harry now that Andromeda was getting on a bit. Draco had been furious when Harry had moved him in without consulting Draco first, but Draco hadn’t been able to stay angry for long, not when Teddy was so cute, and Harry was so smitten. The poor woman hadn’t been spared in any way though, since her home had become a half-way house so that Draco and Harry needn’t see anything of each other.
‘Yes.’ He said proudly, puffing out his skinny chest. ‘I checked three times. Twice last night and once this morning.’ Draco felt a stab in his chest knowing Harry got to spend Teddy’s last night with him while Draco drank a whole bottle of chateauneuf du pape and cried watching
His entire face was soft. Rounded jaw, button nose, wide eyes, soft brow. His hair was now a dirty blond and his eyes were hazel. It was difficult to tell but he estimated he was about three inches shorter, the inches added to his shoulders and waist. This muggle wasn’t particularly bad looking, but he certainly wasn’t Draco.
They took a right at the fountain and walked through the rose garden – perhaps the only part of the grounds to have successfully survived the winter. Draco wanted to stop and smell the roses, but now wasn’t the time. Eventually, nestled between the hedgerows separating the rose garden from the wild flowers, they came across what may well be Draco’s favourite place in the world. He had been too busy to spend time here during his little sojourn to France, but he would make up for that in the future.
Sirius and Remus burst into the room with a clatter. Harry’s vision wasn’t up to much by that point, even with his glasses on, but he could see that Sirius’s eyes were red-rimmed and raw. He was shocked, however, to see the fiery red mop of hair sticking out from behind Remus’s head. Ron pushed his way through between Harry’s godfather and his best friend and started babbling away.
“Well,” Granger began hesitantly. Draco found it amusing that she was now being so timid; it made a significant change from the last time he had an ‘important’ discussion with her. “I’ve heard on the grapevine,” she gestured vaguely, “that the Ministry have found Harry’s wand.” Draco had just finished taking a sip of tea as she spoke, and his teacup clattered back onto the saucer more violently that he anticipated.
To top it all off, he only made it halfway back to the Manor before his dampened protective charms failed. The rain quickly soaked through the silk and drenched his skin. Lightening continued to flash, and thunder continued to roar as he plodded miserably back to the Manor through lawns quickly turning to quagmires. Having used most of his wand’s power on the charms, he had to remove his clothes and dry off the muggle way. By the time he made it back to the warmth of his bed he was shivering uncontrollably. It was gone six in the morning by then, so he felt no guilt in calling one of the elves to light the fire in his room. It left him with little time to sleep, but he would take whatever he could get.
He went back downstairs in search of Harry. He found him in one of the offices with Helen and one of the admin staff he’d never bothered to learn the name of.
‘Go and do something useful, Kreacher.’ Harry barked irritably at him. He didn’t need to be dusting Harry’s limited-edition snitch collection, Harry had seen him do that three times already this week and he swore he was doing it on purpose just to piss him off.
Harry looked like he was about to start crying and Draco would never admit it, but he wasn’t far behind him. Draco began to feel a familiar twist of guilt in the pit of his stomach when he realised that if he did indeed to go France, he’d only be proving to Teddy that his fears were well founded.
‘Why don’t we agree that it stops today? It doesn’t have to be that way. Think about all the things we’ve done together. We didn’t let the backlash stop us getting married. We didn’t care when everyone thought you must’ve cursed me or poisoned me with amortentia. We didn’t care when they said I was using my fame to promote a political agenda. Look how well we did when we first decided to raise Teddy together. There were so many times when it was us against the world and we made it. We just have to find it again.’
It was Luna who had named the place, much to Draco’s surprise. Emine was supposedly a name of Turkish origin which Luna said meant “one who is fearless and courageous”. A few years ago, Draco would have curled his lip in disgust at such a Gryffindorian idea, but he supposed it was incredibly brave of the children to move to an orphanage and find their way. Particularly those old enough to remember their parents and the happenings which brought them to the orphanage.
‘Hugo is fine, sweetheart. He’s spending some quality time with Uncle Ron while I come to check on Draco.’ Hermione said kindly. She sometimes talked down to Teddy a little bit, since her own children were much younger, but Teddy never complained.
Harry could see that Sirius was dubious, and sure enough, just as Harry was winning against Aspen, “I’m not sure about this. If he’s just a little too old…once they start to mature…foxes and dogs famously don’t get along…”
‘I’m fine Hermione. Go back and spend time with the kids.’ Since Hermione became head of the DMLE, her time with her children had been suffering. She gave him a smile loaded with sympathy and pity. It made his stomach churn.
‘You never lost me, Harry. There’s no point dragging it all out again, but I want you to know that even if I pretended like I hated you for a long time, I never stopped loving you.’ Draco could feel hot tears pricking in his own eyes and he willed them away. Now wasn’t the time to cry for what was lost, it was a time to hold on to what was left.
‘You two are so mean to me.’ Draco said like he hadn’t plagued Harry’s existence for the first eight years they’d known each other.
“Draco, you’re standing in a supply cupboard Polyjuiced as a muggle so that you can break into the Department of Mysteries. There’s nothing legal about this. Besides, I was thinking if this works it won’t matter what I said or did. We can stand here arguing about it all day, or we can get to that Veil before the Polyjuice wears off.”
The same thought had been ringing in his head for an hour now, stuck on a continuous loop. He didn’t know what to do with himself. He’d make tea, that’s what he’d do. Tea fixed everything. His hands shook as he filled the kettle, the cupboard door slammed against the one next to it because he opened it with too much force, the mug clattered when he almost dropped it instead of putting it down gently. All in all, it was the most disastrous cup of tea he’d ever made.
It was absolutely wrong. They’d only been getting along for one afternoon, and even then, it was begrudgingly on Malfoy’s side. But then he hadn’t been able to take his eyes off her all day, nor had he been able to when he’d seen her at that open mic. He’d blamed it on her singing then, but she wasn’t singing now.
‘Stop that.’ Harry hissed behind his smile as he waved at Teddy. Draco frowned for a split second before he realised he was fidgeting, shifting his weight from one foot to the other like a maniac. He stood stock still immediately and Harry shot him a strange look.
‘What the hell are you doing here?’ Harry barked at him. He was wearing nothing but his underwear, he had total bed hair and Draco was finding it very difficult to take him seriously, even though he knew Harry could destroy him in the blink of an eye.
Harry returned the favour by using his torso to push the blonde to the right, the brunette now between his legs trying to choke the other, by now both their robes only straddling their arms.
What in Merlin's beard had gotten into him!? If there were spectators he could kinda justify his behaviour, but to just start a fight from nothing?
Harry swallowed hard as his throat felt dry. Malfoy wouldn't understand that Harry knew he had an erection unless he pointed out, which Harry did not want to point out even if his gaze was wandering at Malfoy's groin.
He didn't understand why he had left the library in the first place. It pretty git-y of him to do so if he was being honest with hims--
As much of a hero complex he had, and as much of an idiot he was, Harry gave good hugs, that's something he could admit….To himself at least.
Harry wanted to do something about this, but he knew acting right now that everyone was awake wouldn't be very smart.
He got closer and closer, till he was standing next to the lying boy, the covers shifting alongside his breathing.
Harry looked at the map for a few moments before running to the girl's bathroom on the first floor. He needed a quiet place to think, which now that he thought about it, didn't fit the description of Moaning Myrtle's bathroom at all, but he could work with it.
His hands left the desk fell to his side as he stared at his shoes. He couldn't look at Potter now, couldn't stand to remember the dreams and fantasies of his younger self. They had started the minute he learned he would be in the same year as Harry Potter himself, the Boy Who Lived.
Harry felt his face flush even more when Draco broke eye contact and looked at his crotch, his pale eyes widening.
Harry just couldn't stand it anymore. He was getting these feelings of sudden unfamiliarity and almost panic lately. They made him want to just curl up in a corner forever. A good wank wasn't helping, even if the naked women on the muggle magazine he had managed to smuggle from Dudley last year should had seduced the reader. But Harry didn't want just a random person, he wanted someone special.
Although he wasn't really good at it with other people, Harry had to admit that reading Malfoy's emotions wasn't hard for him. He knew that nosy git after 4 years of fighting with him, he knew the things he had to say to make him furious, not as well as the git made him, but still good enough to help them get detention.
A blonde boy ruffled around in his bed, his hair even more out of place than before due to his mental anguish.
She blinked away the stinging of her eyes as she got up and ordered them to follow her. She could only hope the two of them had enough time in their hands
The pure-blood Slitherin walked closer to Harry and sneered, the curious smirk on his pink lips deflecting a bit and the sun reflecting off his 'Potter Stinks' badge.
"Don't you have to go charm even more badges for our-lord-and-saviour-Cedric-Diggory since you everyone hates me so much!?"
But, he always had Ron and Hermione by his side supporting him, even when they were troublesome 11 year olds.
His mind was overflowing with thoughts and desires he couldn't understand or make sense of yet. He sighed softly as he felt colder from touching the porcelain sink.
After Harry and Draco were both shirtless, Harry got in the tub rather quickly -to hide the now raging boner that had developed thanks to Draco- while Draco dived in the full of lilac bubbles water.
But it seemed the universe wasn't with him as he turned to see none other than Flich himself, carrying Mrs. Norris bridal style and looking at them wide-eyed like he had just won the lottery.
Draco looked at him questionably, his eyebrow furrowed from Harry's odd behavior, the Gryffindor's emerald eyes wide and his heartbeat fast. Something was bothering him and making him rabble like that, but what exactly was doing th--
He was tucked in the bed under the covers, only a pale neck and head protruding from the soft sheets as he was looking tiredly to the ceiling, his hair ruffled and his lips a frown.
Harry was ready to attack Zabini, because he couldn't just let Malfoy just take that and Draco seemed to have picked that up because he held the Griffindor's arm
Yet another thing Malfoy had something Harry would never have the chance to have. Yet another thing he had to solve, another person wanting to kill him, yet another thing to worry about, yet again death almost getting him, he was tired of all of this, tired of everyone turning against him yet again.
Maybe it was how tired he was, or maybe it was something else that made Malfoy that moment want more than anything to make the Gryffindor chuckle like this every day, to see his eyes shine and his adam's apple bob and his messy hair to gently touch his face and Merlin--
"I know what's behind it, but I won't tell you unless you kiss me" he said with a wink from his eye. Harry right then and there woke up from disgust, or at least he thought, but he couldn't be more wrong. His bottom half seemed to enjoy the thought of kissing Draco bloody Malfoy. He tried to calm himself down but it wasn't working. He put a Silencing charm around him, not as good as the ones Hermione made on Charms Class but it was enough for what he was about to do. He tried to get off with the usual, imagining men or women in seductive poses but it seemed his bottom half didn't enjoy
Harry looked up from his plate now filled with food by Hermione and spotted the pale blond boy, his facade up but his eyes betraying him as they flickered around the room, like he was worried he would get attacked at any moment. Thank Merlin for his Malfoy genes, he internally thought, it made him almost too easy to spot.
"Draco, you genius!! Of course!! I can send a message with my Patronus to McGonagall for help!!!" Harry almost shouted as he mindlessly hugged the other boy from his excitement.
Harry looked at him go, almost completely careless about his detention, and more curious of what the future held for him
He admitted tiredly. He'd been trying to fall asleep for Merlin knows how long, but he just couldn't because of that stupid Scarhead that plagued his every thought with his behavior.
He had almost forgotten his detention because of all the homework he was trying to do. He was sitting on his bed trying to improve his crappy Silencing Charms when he finally remembered what he had forgotten. To his horror, it was 7:46 and he was still in his pyjamas, so it was no surprise when he arrived outside her door at 7:58, still painting nonetheless.
Draco continued but instantly regrettied it. He didn't want Harry to pity him. Seeing him crying like a baby was more than enough
Before Harry knew it, it was time for his Potions lesson. Unfortunately, as if having a lesson with Snape wasn't enough, the greasy black-haired professor decided a change in seats, ending with Harry and Draco sitting together in front of Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. As Harry was focused on not yelling at Pansy Parkinson to stop her pig screeches she called laugher, he hadn't looked over to look at Malfoy from his embarrassment about what the Griffindor did at the morning. Malfoy was looking rather strange for the Malfoy Harry was used to. His platinum hair was gently teasing his gray eyes, which looked tired today and most of his right index finger was covered in a cloth like material.
‘Really? Man? Woman? Neither? Both?’ Draco asked him. She certainly wasn’t behaving like it. He assumed she’d hate him a little less once she’d found herself someone. She’d only had brief flings up until now – he wasn’t even sure why he was so interested anyway, it was no skin off his nose.
‘Draco!’ She half-yelled when she looked up from the pages and saw that he was awake. ‘You absolute shit! I thought you were going to die!’ He didn’t quite know what to say when her eyes starting filling with tears. He felt awful for upsetting her. He tried to tell her so, but he was suddenly aware of how dry his mouth and throat were.
‘It’s not the only one.’ He muttered under his breath and Draco nearly choked. Thankfully the pastry chef seemed to be turning a blind eye. Or deaf ear. Or both.
The air between them had changed. It was no longer thick with humidity, instead holding the promise of new territory. At first neither of them moved any closer, but they didn’t move away either.
‘My, my, we are sensitive today, Potter. Lover’s tiff?’ Draco mused. The familiar twitch in Harry’s jaw appeared and Draco felt a little thrill shoot down his spine knowing he could press Harry’s buttons just as easily.
‘What did he say to you?’ He asked her. He didn’t look away from Hugo, choosing to watch his little fingers grip the edges of Draco’s coat. He probably should’ve taken it off, but he didn’t always notice temperature changes with his bad circulation.
That was odd. It was the time the Dark Lord had been living in his house, eating at his table, sleeping in his wing. He didn't recall the last time he had reviewed those memories, even though they were important. Wasn't that simply because he'd been focusing on understanding his divorce? Come to think of it, he didn't exactly remember much about that time-
“Please don’t do that. Don’t hide it from me.” He looks into Malfoy’s eyes properly for the first time. It’s possibly the closest he has ever been to Malfoy’s face before, and he can see that the glimmering grey of his irises are lined with a darker graphite ring. There’s even a small smattering of freckles across his nose that Harry is convinced he must have been hiding at school because he absolutely would have noticed that.
Well over an hour later, Harry arrived with his silver bundle held tightly to his chest from fear that it would wriggle free and he would need another hour to catch it again. He was already exhausted from chasing it around the flat and trying hopelessly to reason with it. In the end he bribed it with peanut butter.
‘What brings you here this morning? It isn’t normal for you,’ Susan asked him. He looked away from the kids to observe her more closely. She had a kind face, the crinkles around her eyes looking like they came from decades of too much laughing. She had thin hair, almost totally grey, which would have made her look old if it weren’t for the spark in her eyes. Draco liked her, he had been instrumental in her hiring if Harry should be believed, he’d only picked up that she had an air about her and suggested her as a favourite.
Draco frowned. ‘Mastered a wand? When did you master my wand?’ He flushed embarrassingly as the innuendo, feeling even more ridiculous when Harry wiggled his eyebrows at him.
‘What the fuck, Draco? Why are you being like this, it’s my right to know what’s going on as your boss and your friend.’
It’s a shock when Malfoy himself opens the door, rather than the house elf Harry expected. He hasn’t changed much since the last time Harry saw him – jawline a touch sharper, cheeks a little less full. The biggest difference Harry can see is his hair. It’s much longer now, reaching down to his shoulders. The top half is pulled back from his face, emphasising how sharp his features still are.
‘You’re taking the piss, right? You can’t seriously be throwing that in my face again. Who even are you?’ Draco knew he was being horrible and unreasonable, but he didn’t much care. He was having a terrible day and he couldn’t deal with this right now. Thankfully, when Teddy went off to school, he and Harry wouldn’t have any reason to see each other anymore.
‘Ok, but wouldn’t we have noticed valerian in their systems? It’s a common ingredient in potions and healing.’
‘Oh, right.’ Draco heard the curtain scrape against the rail and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He’d wanted a shower with a door anyway, not a stupid flimsy shower curtain. Stupid bloody curtain. Stupid bloody Harry. Stupid bloody day.
‘It’s a big change, it’ll take a while to get used to. He’s off having fun and making friends. Surely you remember our first year, there was barely a moment to think.’ He tried his best to avoid the fact that Harry hadn’t had any family back home missing him the way Draco’s mother had. ‘He’ll be coming back soon, and he’ll be all over you like a rash,’ Draco told him. He gave him the most convincing smile he could muster but he wasn’t sure Harry believed him.
“Are you thinking about Potter again? Or your little project? I really can’t decide which is worse. Probably mooning over Potter, but then I would so love to watch you coughing up fur balls.” A couple of weeks ago, Pansy had showed up unannounced, again, and found Draco researching animagi. It was an ongoing project he had begun months ago but which had been fruitless so far.
“It sort of is, but it’s also very vague. There are so many words that I presume don’t exist in Latin that have been substituted. They don’t exactly fit in the context though.” She pointed towards the word
‘Let’s not talk about that now. It’s the holidays! It’s time for fun! We even left the star off the tree for you…’ Harry pointed out of Draco’s view towards the tree. Teddy looked unconvinced but when he followed Harry’s arm gesture, his face split into a broad smile.
‘I don’t like this man.’ She said abruptly and pointed at a name in the book she’d been reading when he came in. He couldn’t read it upside down, but she didn’t seem to realise that.
him. How dare he presume that there was anything he could advise Harry about. How dare he pretend like he hadn’t made one disastrous choice after another. How dare he tell Harry he shouldn’t pursue happiness when he had the one thing Harry had always wanted but had never had.
He missed dessert, although there was plenty left over, and he also missed gift exchanging. Later on, Harry passed him a beautifully wrapped Weasley jumper with the initials DP knitted into it to signify Draco’s return. He promised he’d send a thank you owl the next day.
‘You forgot something!’ She giggled and launched herself at him. He wasn’t strong enough to told her up, so he lowered her to the floor to hug her back. Her hold was so vice-like it almost hurt which was quite impressive for a little girl. She’d come a long way since she first arrived at the orphanage and wouldn’t look at or speak to anyone.
‘Uh, yes. I make my own now though and I only need one dose a month. No, wait, that’s not the point. The point is, they put my trial back because I wasn’t well.’ If he was going to do this, he wasn’t going to let Harry distract him.
‘Oh. It’s a new phone, it’s called an iPhone 3G. 3G is muggle internet that works wirelessly. It’s supposed to be the fastest one yet. I just got this, but they’ve been out a while now. Apparently, I should have emails on the go and the internet on that old flip thing was useless.’ He went off on a tangent about all the fancy muggle technological things Draco didn’t want to know about. Harry didn’t notice the way the teacup shook in Draco’s long fingers, or the way he was staring at a point just beyond his head instead of looking at him properly.
‘I didn’t stop loving him, Teddy. It’s difficult for you to understand because you’re so young. Sometimes when you love people you have to let them go so that they can be happier and sometimes they go and they’re not happier and they want to come back, and other times they don’t.’
‘Oh, yes I’m fine. I just need some water.’ He helped himself to a glass and he sat down at the kitchen table with her since most of the pans were happily stirring themselves with impeccable household charms. He thought she was a very smart woman pretending she needed to be glued to the kitchen when she really didn’t. He doubted either of them would get a word in edgeways if they went outside…
‘He can stay with me.’ Harry said immediately, and Draco’s heart skipped a beat at how enthusiastic Harry was about letting Draco back in what was supposed to be their family home.
‘Hermione, please.’ Draco said, rubbing his forehead. He didn’t need another rant, he’d already had one when he’d had the self-same conversation with Pansy. ‘I can, and I will. I don’t see why this is such a big deal. There really isn’t much keeping me here anymore and I need a change of scenery.’
‘I honestly don’t know. Smith said I made progress, but he never gives much away. From what I can gather, he thinks the issues with my magic are to go with my inability to share my feelings with Harry. Apparently, he thinks I’ll find something in my childhood that caused it. Honestly, it’s rubbish. It’s pop psychology at best.’ He was fed up of having something wrong with him. Why did something have to be wrong with him? Why couldn’t he just not be perfect and functional like Harry or Hermione? Why did everyone think he had to be happy all the time?
It wasn’t like any kiss they’d ever shared before. It wasn’t like any kiss Draco had ever had with anyone. At first it felt like Harry’s lips were just ghosting over Draco’s, Draco was even about to question if any of it was real when it seemed like Harry’s last thread of restraint snapped. He pulled Draco flush to him and kissed him like his life depended on in. Draco could feel Harry’s chest pressed flush against his own and his hands trembled as he tried his best to be the strong one of the pair.
He had to pause for a minute while the faint spell passed. Out in the corridor he could still hear their voices, but he couldn’t make out what they were saying. It wasn’t even easy to tell what tone they were taking, but he sincerely hoped that the two women could get past this. After all, it could all go exactly according to plan.
“You broke up with her, Ron. You can’t complain when she’s not here waiting with a cup of tea.” Harry shuffled off into the kitchen to put the kettle on because despite their youth, neither of them could sleep without a cuppa. In a way it was probably a good thing Hermione wasn’t here waiting with a cup of tea because they’d have been kept awake for at least an hour longer listening to another of her rants about not becoming a Stepford Wife.
He hadn’t known until coming here himself just how awful it was when they attacked. Although he had seen the state his father had been in after his stay in Azkaban, he’d never been there during the nights when the place was a cacophony of wails and insane screams. Never had he regretted scaring Potter more. Each time the dementors approached he couldn’t help but remember all those times when they were younger that they sought Potter out, fed on his pain.
‘Well, I’ve been talking to Neville sometimes, just at the weekends, when he comes to tend to the plants. He was telling me about how all the plants he grows in the greenhouses can be used in some potion or other. Some of them are poisons of course, but some of them save lives. I think that’s pretty cool. He lent me lots of books on plants and when I understood how they grow and how they’re used, potions made so much sense!’ He beamed across the table at Draco, proud of his little epiphany. Draco was incredibly proud too.
‘I’m not worried.’ He turned away from her and caught Ella clambering up onto the chair clumsily. Bless her heart. ‘You should probably help her with that, I’m not getting involved.’ Daphne laughed and went over to help. Draco took the opportunity to take in the appearance of the salon since Harry was pacing back and forth talking quickly and running his hands through his hair impatiently.
will support you in this. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about you in the last decade, it’s that you’re honest, and I don’t think you’d make something like this up.”
They were wandering around the toy section of Harrods when Draco turned to Teddy and asked, ‘Ted, if you could have anything for Christmas, what would it be?’ He realised it wasn’t the smartest thing to ask a child, but he couldn’t help himself. Teddy paused in front of a giant Lego set which seemed to be a model of a spaceship. He opened his mouth and closed it again with indecision. Draco had to admit, he hadn’t expected him to find the answer so difficult.
‘I really need to go; my lunch hour is up.’ They kiss each other’s cheeks and Hermione makes her way over to the lifts while Draco heads for the ministry floo. The food in the atrium really was always terrible.
“What exactly is it that you think I can help you with, Harry? I will, as long as it’s in my power, you know that.” Sirius had nearly finished his tea by the time that Harry had finished talking. It was still too hot for Harry though, so his sat full on the table in front of him, slowly warming his hands.
“Don’t you bloody start. I’m going to bed after this. I think all this sunlight is giving me a headache.” Harry thought that highly unlikely considering how much time Ron and been spending indoors, but it must be bad if he was prepared to skip dinner.
“Yes, yes, all of that.” He waved his hand, swatting the questions away like flies and turning towards the dining room. Not the one which had been repurposed for blood supremacism meetings, but the one just along from the grand piano parlour with the pretty view of his mother’s rose garden.
“Which door is it?” He hissed in Granger’s ear. She was looking ahead with a frown on her face. It worried him because he had been reliant on her knowing her way around. And then came the rumble. Granger had obviously waited for this to happen, but she hadn’t warned Draco. They stood in the middle of the room as the doors around the edges started to rotate into new positions. It was impossible to tell which door they’d entered through and therefore would get back out of.
Luckily for Draco, the featherlight charm on the box was still in place, so getting it down the ladder was more of a spatial problem than a weighty one. By the time he got to the bottom he couldn’t be bothered to take the ladder back out to the shed, so he pushed it to one side and decided to ask Harry to do it later.
“I want my friend back!” She burst out. “Don’t you dare sit there keeping information from me! Do you have any idea how agonising it has been? Not a word from him since September – no messages, no calls, no idea if he’s even still alive. And here you’ve been, sitting on information that could be the difference between life and death. You’re a disgrace!”
‘Are you sure? Dad was really worried. He called like, everyone and he was shouting at everyone for not fixing you. Aunt Hermione says Dad is the best when bad things happen because he always knows what to do, but this time he was hopeless like Uncle Ron when Aunt Hermione had Rose.’ Draco huffed a laugh. When Hermione had gone into labour, Ron had quite literally lost his mind with the strangest display of adult accidental magic Draco had ever seen. Thankfully Draco and Harry had been there to make sure everything ran smoothly.
That wasn’t a situation Draco was willing to accept. At varying points of his desperation, he had even considered going into the Ministry and finding Potter himself, but the consequences of being caught were more than he could bear. He was already watched everywhere he went, which was precisely nowhere.
‘Come on, Draco. You need to do something, and I didn’t take an expensive international portkey just to sit here and watch you mope like a child even younger than Teddy.’  She told him firmly. Sometimes Draco really hated Pansy, but he had to give the woman credit, she was always strangely motivating.
Of course Weasley would be inhospitable even when he was in a vulpine form. Perhaps it was built into his DNA.
“You wanted to kiss me.” The disbelief in his voice sounded wrong even two his own ears, but he found the concept of her wanting him difficult. That afternoon at Luna’s Harry had been the one to move in first and although Lyra had seemed very pleased with the notion, nothing had been said about it since.
He groaned with the effort of raising his head off the pillow as it sent a wave of pain out from his chest to his fingertips. He couldn’t see all that well, but he could tell from the copious amounts of white that he must be back in St Mungo’s. He was sick of the sight of the place now. His head fell back against the pillow, entirely of its own accord, and he realised trying to move was futile. He thought perhaps he wasn’t actually fully awake yet since all he could see was a giant blur of white and the clock right next to his face.
‘Don’t over think it. Things don’t have to be perfect, let’s just see what happens.’ It was difficult for him to offer any real advice when he didn’t exactly know what was happening, but he tried.
‘Ok fine,’ she said as she finished her pasta, ‘but if this whole thing blows up in your face, don’t come crying to me.’
‘No Draco, I don’t have to understand anything. I’m sorry for what I put you through, even if I don’t know exactly what it is I did. I want you to know before you tell me anything that I’m sorry either way. You must know by now that I care. Please tell me you know I care about you.’ Draco turned his face into the sofa, the same way Teddy had when Draco had taken him out to Diagon before he went to Hogwarts. He couldn’t look at Harry anymore.
‘Uh, alright then. I’ll, uh, see you at home.’ Draco winced as Harry fumbled over his words. He used to berate him for doing that, way back before they’d realised they didn’t hate each other. He’d come to learn that he only did it when he was upset or nervous.
Still, he was finding it difficult to adjust to life without a purpose. That sounded a lot more dismal than he really meant it, but he hadn’t appreciated the significance of waking up every morning with a job to do.
‘Don’t you dare, Draco. None of this is your fault.’ He reached out and stroked a thumb across Draco’s right cheek and if it wasn’t just a little bit terrified of this situation, he probably would’ve melted right there and then. ‘Hell, if I hadn’t been such an arse to you, you never would have left in the first place. You have no idea how terrified I was when I saw you lying here. I thought you were dead. On the bright side though, if you’re the target of the neo-Death Eaters, you can’t be one of them. It’s done your reputation wonders.’ Harry joked but the implication was clear.
‘Christ. She doesn’t think you’re a horcrux, does she?’ He was back to looking worried again, just when Draco had been getting used to being carefree.
Hermione was solemn as they walked back to the Ministry after their lunch and Draco was genuinely sorry to be the cause of her poor mood. If someone had told his teenage self that he would be sorry to cause Hermione Granger pain, he’d have hexed them into the middle of next week. As it was, she’d become one of his closest friends and even though he couldn’t keep up his end of the deal, he appreciated that she cared enough about him to ask him to stay.
“You mean… do whatever I want and sod the consequences?” The way Granger scrunched up her face in confusion made Draco laugh, which in turn made his head pound again. It was going to be a very long day.
‘Exactly.’ Harry mumbled. Draco frowned at him. His posture was defeatist; shoulders slumped, elbows rested on the edges of the sink. His hair was wild after spending the afternoon stood in the summer breeze and it took Draco a lot of self-control not to run his hands through it. Harry’s hair was a disaster, but few people had any idea how soft it really was. Draco supposed looks could be deceiving. He just wished he could same for himself. Cold on the outside, even colder on the inside.
“The only way I could assuage Pansy was to promise her we’d go through the plan together.” She said after a beat of silence.
Draco flinched violently as Harry’s hand slammed into Wood, ripping him away from him and shoving him against the wall.
Draco felt as though he’d been dumped head first into an icy plunge pool. A chill spread through every inch of his body and a tight knot formed in his sternum which somehow managed to make him feel sick and unable to breath at the same time.
‘I-I- I don’t know what to say,’ he rasped. He took the ring from the box and with some difficulty due to the tears blurring his vision he could just make out an infinity symbol engraved on one side. As he turned the ring over, he noticed on the inside of the band the date
Except there was no easy way to say it. How could he explain to someone he had hated for longer that he’d liked that he had weird dreams about a man trapped in an archway in a forest after following an imagined version of a fox that randomly showed up at his flat in the middle of the night. And how, after explaining all of that, would he then go on to say that the mystery forest man looked just like said person and he wasn’t entirely sure that said person was actually real.
He couldn’t help the feeling of terror that crawled up his spine. There was no one to help him this time. No father, no mother, not even Severus. Ultimately it gave him two choices. He could refuse to help Granger and let the court of public opinion swell to the point that the still-corrupt Ministry arrested him anyway, or, he could go with her, try to fix the problem he helped cause, get caught, and be arrested anyway.
He was in his favourite coffee shop near Mayfair and for once he had decided to read the Prophet, to make sure he was up-to-date with the wizard stock market. It wasn’t strictly relevant to him, but Goblins were notorious for undermining wizards’ intelligence with their quips. Draco was no fool, his father had taught him well when it came to negotiations.
When he didn’t respond, she tried a different tactic. “So, tell me about this project of yours.” She waved her hand idly and refilled her coffee while Draco managed a couple of mouthfuls of his mangled, and now cold, eggs.
“Tell me it’s real.” He could mean a dozen things by that, but he didn’t know exactly what he was asking.
‘I’m ok. I just had an odd dream about this place while I- when I was in the hospital again.’ He really had forgotten about it until yesterday, it wasn’t as though he was trying to hide it from Harry.
‘The nice ladies don’t like me anymore.’ She fiddled with the corners of the book Draco had finished reading.
Draco opened his mouth to pathetically blabber his way back out of his stumble when another healer opened the door. It wasn’t the same one that Draco had seen before, but Draco was secretly grateful. This one looked about fifty and had a completely grey beard and generally appeared like he actually knew what he was doing.
‘He said he wanted me around, get to grips with everything he does, learn protocols, meet dignitaries, etcetera…’
After ten minutes the noise from upstairs stopped but Harry didn’t reappear. Draco waited; listened for any more sound, but there was nothing. After fifteen minutes, he grew impatient. He got up and made his way quietly upstairs to see what they were doing. He dodged the one creaky floorboard on the landing as he went to Teddy’s room at the far end of the house. He’d avoided that room since he came back – he didn’t want to see it still and empty when Teddy wasn’t there.
Sensing his hesitation to finish his story, Sirius chimed in, “Harry, whatever it is, you can tell us. We will support you whatever it is.” The earnest look in his godfather’s eye brought a lump to Harry’s throat. It was the kind of thing he imagined his parents might have said to him whenever he’d been worried or stressed.
He looked imploringly at Harry. ‘Tell me you didn’t.’ At least the man had the gumption to look guilty.
‘It’s hideous!’ Draco whined as he adjusted his jumper. Molly made a rule after the war that Christmas was a day of silliness. Draco had only spent Christmas with the Weasleys after he and Harry were married, but Harry had told him how difficult that first Christmas without Fred had been. As such, they all had to wear amusing Christmas jumpers to lunch and Draco and Harry always bought theirs for each other. This year, Draco had bought Harry one with bells on it that said, “jingle my bells” and Harry had gotten Draco the worst jumper he’d ever owned.
‘Will you please tell me what happened?’ He asked the mediwitch as she updated his notes. He was desperate to think of anything else.
It was completely irrational, but Harry wanted the fox’s attention back. “What do you think of Aspen?” He asked him. They waited while he stood on the table and pondered Harry’s question. After a little while, he sat down and looked right at Harry, although he wasn’t sure what the fox wanted from him.
‘You want my help sir? Are you sure about that?’ Kingsley sighed over the floo, dropping the professionalism for a minute.
‘Less time for what?’ Draco probed him gently. Teddy sometimes had trouble getting his words out when he got worked up.
‘Paying cars!’ He waved a toy car into Harry’s face with a cheeky grin. Harry feigned excitement to match.
The man stared at him menacingly through the bars and Draco waited for him to say something else. He was surprised that he wasn’t even angry, but his limbs felt so heavy that he doubted he had the energy to feel anything at all. He wanted to ask what would happen to him, how long he was going to be here, whether he would be allowed to fight the charge or write letters, but he knew by the victorious look on the man’s face that it would be futile.
The silence between them was getting awkward. Things hadn’t exactly slotted back into place when Draco had moved back. They were clumsy around each other, unsure even. Of course they cared about each other, but it was difficult to ignore the changes they’d been through over the years.
“Thank you.” He took a sip of the tea and sighed. “Yeah, I’d like to read it.” It occurred to him when she shivered that she was still cold and damp, so he waved a hand half absentmindedly to dry her off and warm her up. He jumped when she gasped.
Early on he’d taken to singing quietly the few songs he remembered the words to, only so that he didn’t lose the ability to speak and in the absence of his piano. It was evening, although it was hard to tell when the sky remained the same shade of stormy grey at all times. He could tell on this occasion by the faint glow of a waxing gibbous behind the clouds. He tried to think about which potions ingredients would be best to harvest during a waxing gibbous, but he was too tired. He was always too tired these days. Looking out at the glowing white circle, he was reminded of a song his mother used to sing when he was small.
He felt like he’d been taken for a ride. Had Harry been disappearing off to see Wood this whole time? Had he been lying to him? What if he hadn’t and he really did love Draco as much as he said he did? That would still mean he took him in out of pity, not because he wanted him. Surely Wood wouldn’t have stood for it if his boyfriend had brought his ex-husband back to care for him. Draco certainly wouldn’t have. Then again, if Harry had lied to Draco, maybe he’d lied to Wood too. Draco didn’t like Wood. Of course, he’d become a competent professional quidditch player, but there had always been something off balance about him. He was as much about the social climb as he was about the climb to the top of his profession.
‘What’s up with you today, hm?’ Harry asked him. He felt a kiss being pressed into his hair and he bit his lip to hide his smile, even though he didn’t need to.
‘He didn’t though, and that’s what matters. And we have to do everything we can to make sure he knows how much we love him. Can you do that for me? I think it’s very important.’ Draco’s chest felt heavy with emotion. He felt so much these days, far more than the rage he felt before. He supposed it was the effect of being unable to take his anxiety potions – he wasn’t used to feeling so much all the time.
‘Love you, Draco.’ Teddy said. Draco’s chest swelled. Teddy didn’t say it very often, which only meant that it was so much more special when he did.
“Potter?” Harry wonders if Malfoy realises his posture straightened stiffly when he registered him. “Whatever it is I have nothing to do with it!”
‘Well, you are basically a philistine after all.’ He blew flour in Harry’s face to annoy him, but he missed, and it all went in his hair. He started giggling like a child until he breathed in some of it and started hacking up a lung.
And so, at the end of Draco Potter’s agreement with Hermione Granger-Weasley, Draco found himself lounging in the living room of his old marital home, surrounded by the best, and the worst, of his memories, and he realised the only thing he’d ever needed was the man who lay with him, ready to risk it all for one last chance at happiness.
The lull was the time for him to tell her about what he really came for, but it was also hard for him to explain it when he wasn’t entirely sure what he wanted. She went back to her guitar, playing chords quietly while he thought.
‘No,’ Harry said quietly, his voice cracking slightly. ‘Just know that you scared the crap out of me and you’re not allowed to do that ever again. I already lost you once, I won’t lose you again.’ Draco could feel the hurt radiating off Harry in waves and his heart did an uncomfortable flip in his chest.
‘If you calm down, I promise I’ll get him for you. Stop worrying about them and think of yourself. You can’t do anything from here. You need to get better first.’ He wasn’t listening to anything she said. He had to see Harry.
‘Shhh. That one’s only for the grownups.’ He whispered in Draco’s hear as he took a seat on the sofa. Draco was unable to supress a shiver as he felt his hot breath against his skin.
When he finally made it to bed at the end of Christmas Day, he thought perhaps the bar was set just a little too high for next year.
‘Bloody hell Draco!’ Harry jumped when Draco appeared looking like death anthropomorphised. Draco giggled at Harry’s shock, remembering that time in third year when he’d pretended to be a dementor just to make him fall of his broom. He’d been so obvious with his crush back then, how no one had noticed was beyond him.
Harry thought back to the last time he saw Remus, but the memory was too foggy for him to see it clearly. “I think he still loves you, you know.” Sirius cleared his throat awkwardly.
place anyway.” Granger shivered, no doubt remembering the time she spent in the manor with his aunt, but even her disgust only masked her anger for a second.
‘If you know of any better solutions, feel free to make a suggestion,’ she said contritely, her lips pursed. She looked unusually McGonagall-like. He nodded defeatedly and swung his legs over the side of the bed, wanting to leave as soon as possible. He refused to let Harry come to these check-ups since he hadn’t yet managed to control his over-bearing worry, but that didn’t mean Draco was all that comfortable going alone either.
He did his best not to react too much, in case she shut him back out again. Instead, he followed her over to the far corner where her small bookshelf was the only item of furniture in the room untouched.
‘What are you doing?’ Draco asked them like they were stupid. If the poor girl was scared, crowding her certainly wasn’t going to help.
‘Regeneration Potion?! As in, that awful dark magic concoction supposedly used to bring Voldemort back from the beyond?’ She sucked in a sharp breath when he called The Dark Lord by his still-fake name. It had taken him ages to be able to say it himself, but he had done it. As he’d once read in a book way back when, “fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.”
When Draco finally figured out how to get back to second gear, the grinding noise came again. Except this time, it was much louder and was accompanied by a loud clunk. That was when the heavens opened.
‘Hermione that’s fantastic! Congratulations!’ He burst out. He grinned at her broadly and was about to ask her how long she expected to be PA before taking over when a loud crash made them both jump. One of the empty shelves fell from the wall and splintered as it hit the edge of Hermione’s desk.
‘Oh gosh I’m so sorry. Here.’ She helped him prop himself up on the pillows and handed him a glass of water, but his hands shook so badly he couldn’t lift it to his mouth to drink, so she had to take it back and help him. He coughed and spluttered when his throat was so dry he couldn’t swallow it properly. She smacked him on the back a little too hard.
‘I didn’t know they were going to discharge me until half an hour before they did it. Harry is more than likely at work, and I don’t want to take him to the mind healer anyway. Honestly Hermione, that’s just the way it worked out.’ She didn’t seem impressed, but he wasn’t about to argue. Thankfully, his first perusal of her new office had the conversation take a different turn.
Just like that polar bear Malfoy tried so desperately to pretend to be the little perfect Slytherin prince, how graceful and powerful he was, always bragging about his fortune or how much influence his father had over Fudge.
Of course he was jealous of the blonde's hair, it was so tamed and perfect all the time and he couldn't even brush his own successfully. There was no way he could find someone who would find such crazy hair attractive.
He didn't seem exactly good, but he could be worse, although Harry had to admit that the ruffled hair look suited him a lot.
He was supposedly alone in the room, and he sure as hell wasn't wearing shoes or anything that could make this sound, so someone else must be in here somehow.
The Gryffindor felt his cheeks burning as he tried to think of a lie to tell her, but all he could think was how nice it was to wrap his arms around Draco's lean torso and how good his cologne smelled and--
"Yes Potter, I am not an albino, we Malfoys have always been this pale and with such fair hair. But you see, for a ferret to have fur as pale as my hair, it would had to have albinism because otherwise it would have darker fur creating a mask-like effect around its face" Malfoy explained briefly but more with an educational tone than an insulting one.
Malfoy thought about it for several moments before responding, pretending he was calm as ever. He decided to be half honest with him, at least for the time being. He couldn't blatantly lie about it since there were only a few explanations about his bodily reaction.
He suddenly felt a warm hand on his shoulder, the heat radiating from his shoulders and climbing up his neck till it reached his face and made it burn.
"Mhmgh, Potter--, you d-didn't answermyquestion, stupid Gryffinpork…." Malfoy complained from his drunk- like state,
Harry really wasn't in a mood to confront that spoiled arse, but shouting at him was relieving. Even if he knew he wouldn't be able to find a teacher quickly enough if Malfoy pulled his wand at him, the corridor seemed so far away that no one would hear his shouts.
Meanwhile in the Great Hall, a muggleborn witch was waiting for her best friend. Hermione Granger rolled her eyes when she spotted him walking in the Great Hall. Harry really just physically couldn't stay out of trouble, could he? She thought.
The Slytherin quietly whispered to himself with wide eyes as he griped the  covers tightly, feeling like this day couldn't get any worse.
Hopefully it's just the change of environment that made him remember more of that day everytime he fell asleep, after all, he wasn't used to spending the night at the Hospital Wing, but something told him that this wasn't the case. He sighed, taking in his surroundings on more out of boredom, just wanting to forget what happened then.
"Professor Mcgonagall, wait--" Filch tried to beg her to let him punish them way worse but the animagus had already left.
"Are you attracted to me Malfoy?" He said so lowly he could pretend that he hadn't heard it, but his pride and Potter's weird behavior made him not want to.
"But how? We don't have swimsuits" Harry responded confused. He hoped Draco wouldn't say they didn't need them because Harry was worried he could come just by seeing Draco shirtless.
Malfoy hated himself, hated what the world thought of him. Not only because Potter was right, but also because he knew he would never be able to get what he truly wanted. Not because of a lack money or fame, but because he wasn't good enough for it. He wasn't good enough for it even when he was eleven.
Before the figure could reveal itself Harry had already pulled out his wand and turned around to see none other than Dobby, the once Malfoy house-elf.
(I'm gay & trans so I can reclaim it, but it's used in a self-hating manner so that warning is needed)
He used to feel all kinds of things when she was around, anxious, flustered, embarrassed, overwhelmed, excited, happy, but, these feelings weren't there anymore.
I'll try to post chapter 12 later,, but in my time zone it's currently 1:14 and i wanna go to sleep so i cant promise anything :/
Now there was no one except Sirius, and he as much as he appreciated him, it just wasn't the same talking to him like it was with his best friends.
He felt his throat tighten as he pulled at the silk fabric over his chest, the dread slowly manifesting itself in his mind.
"Oh, um, Hermione?" Harry asked carefully as he imagined how boring it must be for the git to sit on his bed all day long.
When later he told all of this to the other two, Hermione seemed to be as confused as Harry was as to what was happening to Malfoy to act like that, but Ron seemed to be sure it was some kind of trick
He looked down at his plate while he ate and ignored the people getting up to shove their Potter Stinks badges in his face or shouting how much they dislike him to each other. He really wasn't in the mood to deal with them, that day was just getting worse and worse as time was passing by.
The same Harry Potter that he fought with yesterday in that dusty classroom and that later even hugged him out of the blue.
She missed Ron, but there was no way she was going to admit it. So she just gritted her teeth every time she saw him to stop herself from shouting at him at how stupid he was being, and many other things Hermione hadn't come to terms with herself yet and certainly wasn't ready to say out loud, especially in front of the crowd that will have probably formed by now around them.
"Dobby would never spy on Harry Potter! Dobby was looking out for Harry Potter because someone was worried about him!" Dobby said strangely confident in that someone.
Draco thought quietly as the Gryffindor shifted his weight from one foot to the other, his emerald eyes avoiding his gaze as silence filled the room.
ferret, at least get it right if you're going to use it against me" he said but it had half the bite it used to.
The blonde averted his gaze before finally talking softly, his ears pink from embarrasment even if he wasn't the one caught red-handed here, but his eyes holding a kind of sadness in them.
He was doing his best to imagine non sexual images, but it was all in vain. He was so concentrated on trying to control his hormones he didn't hear what Draco muttered hesitantly against his shirt.
How could he even *try* to look at Pansy the same way as Father wanted him to? Or anyone else really when there was Potter, with his stupid bravery and his stupid hair and his stupid eyes and his stupid abilities at Quidditch and his stupid Quidditch robes that suit him like a glove and his stupid laugh and his stupid everything, and, just Ngghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The blonde felt his eyes widen and his face burn crimson at the sight of the other boy's bulge. He had felt something rubbing against his collarbone, but he certainly didn't expect it to be
Harry knew that he had to be careful if he wanted to get in there without setting off any alarms on the Medi-Witch's radar.
"I don't think Malfoy would be genuinely doing that for being nice, that git must have some kind of bloody plan I know it Harry" the redhead said
He either had to reveal himself or Madam Pomfrey would come back, probably do a Human detecting spell of some sort and find him here instead of the Great Hall, freak out and he'd get even more detention, and probably his Cloak confiscated.
The brunette let his hands fall to his lap to look at the blonde's face, his blue grey eyes dark, his usually pale pointed cheeks now flushed and his breathing quick as he said with furrowed brows, now less than foot separating their faces.
The blonde closed his eyes from the sudden pain as he started backing away, his body dangerously leaning. He felt like he was being sawed in half, his vision darkening. It was getting more and more exhausting to be standing up, he was too tired to even scream.
Harry looked around the corridor, now disguised under the Cloak. No one was there except the Fact Lady's portrait, so he pulled the Marauder's Map out without caring for the rustling of the parchment.
"You should hate me, you should be happy I'm in the Hospital Wing, you should be out there boasting off about how strong you are and how you send Malfoy the Faggot in the Hospital Wing without even using your wand because he got hard when you were beating him up like the freak he is"
Maybe it was a good thing that Harry didn't recognize him, but it was still hard for him to believe Mal- Draco, was hiding this part of him all this time. That this part of him even existed was even better, it was just something he didn't know if he could get used to.
It seems his mind was trying to tell him something, but he didn't want to hear it as he tried to push the memories away. He didn't want to remember Father being like that, but it didn't matter to his subconsciousness as the same events that were plagueing his mind started replaying again
"And also no picking on each other" she said now looking at Malfoy sternly since she knew he was usually the reason they fought in the first place.
With all these negative thoughts filling his mind, he somehow managed to finally fall asleep, even if it didn't last long.
Then it struck Malfoy that Potter had realized what was happening. He rushed to stop himself from at least most of the humiliation by loudly whispering more pleading than he ever intended
"Y-Y-Yeah, You're, You're not yourself let's get you to the Hospital Wing wai-- Oh Fuck" Potter cursed softly as he remembered the door was not charmed to open until 10:15 pm. He looked at the clock on the wall.
The Hufflepuff was sneakily shooting glances at his companion's hair as if he wanted nothing more in the whole world than to bury his hands in it.
Harry gritted his teeth even harder to not beat up Malfoy's stupid face that sprouted all this nonsense. The legs of six of the nearest chairs snapped in half, leaving them mangled on the ground.
Malfoy would respond to the raven haired boy with something along the lines of 'Have you seen me in something else except this school robe Potter to know if my skin is really that pale all over?' but that would come of more flirtatious than mean, so he ignored it.
"Dobby?" Harry lowered his wand "What are you doing here? I haven't seen you since second year!" the taller boy said as he run towards the house elf, now staring at its mismatched socks.
Malfoy didn't want to think what that meant. He didn't want to think the consequences this would have for his life
Malfoy, still unfazed, his body on autopilot as he walked through the corridors and stairs, following the caretaker alongside the brunette.
The pale boy chuckled lightly despite the context of the words he said, tears pooling in the corners of his eyes as he hated himself for showing just how weak he was in front of Potter.
"Oh Brilliant! Yet Another spell to put on my list on 'How Not To Die In The First Ten Minutes Of The First Task Like Malfoy Hoped', Thank you Hermione" Harry loudly whispered more bitterly than he had ever intended. All that thinking about that blonde git was making his head ache in a not pleasant way. Still, he shouldn't have talked to Hermione like that as the bushy haired witch stood up, looked at him with fire in her eyes and chewed out the following words
And his behaviour was suspicious without even taking into account that Malfoy had gotten a damn erection during their fight. He had just blamed it on bad timing, because how could it be justified differently?
How was Harry supposed to be friends with someone like this? Someone so close minded and bad natured!?
"I am not going to send you to your grave, you might have done bad things but as long as you try to change from now on and apologize, I promise I won't hold it over your head Draco"
With Sirius in hiding after accidentally killing Wormtail and Remus no longer the DADA teacher, he felt even more alone. Writing to Sirius just wasn't the same as having a home to come back to for the holidays.
"I don't deserve this, I haven't done anything to deserve this, I've always been just a bully to you"
"W-What? I didn't hear what you s-said…" Harry said apologetically, his senses on edge as the tiniest bit of movement on Draco's part just aroused him more.
Harry forgot he was supposed to be fixing his clothes, his wand still at hand as he was carefully observing the Slytherin's movements to make any sense of the situation, but utterly failing.
One of these moments of dread was yesterday. He was trying to find old articles or photos of the Marauders. Surely Filtch's dozens of documents for their pranks couldn't be the only remainders of them.
He knew what he had to imagine to be able to finish but, he hated that idea. Claiming defeat, Harry let his imagination run wild thinking about the part of his dream his bottom half liked. Harry had finished in just 30 seconds and he didn't like that at all. Malfoy had been an annoying git to him and his friends, he wasn't supposed to be the thing Harry gets off to.
He sat under a sink and brought his knees close to his chest before wrapping his arms around them and resting his head.
An annoyed look on his face that hid something between confusion and embarrassment, Harry Potter entered the Great Hall.
Nevertheless, he got up and started dressing while Ron was just starting to wake up. He would give anything to stay in bed to avoid seeing Malfoy but he knew it wouldn't end well. His homework was already piling up again.
A small smile formed on Draco's lips as he heard the other boy say his first name, his pale eyes shining like the Great Lake did in the sunrise that one time Harry had stayed up all night looking at the Hogwarts grounds, his pale face contrasting with the flush that was painting his cheeks in that very moment.
The taller boy hesitantly raised his head to look at the other's direction and was surprised to see that the brunette had turned in his direction, his brow furrowed and his mouth muttering silent words.
Hope, no matter how hard things are or how awful they seem, is what keeps us going, what helps us to keep trying to reach our goals.
‘Of course I have Pansy, you utter tit.’ He said angrily. There had been a string of one-night stands in the earliest months of his divorce which he’d somehow managed to hide from everyone he knew. It had been fun at first, lowering his inhibitions and forgetting about everything for a while. The company staved of the loneliness and helped him relieve tension. After a while though, he woke up feeling even emptier than he had before. He never brought anyone to his own flat; it was much easier to sneak out of someone else’s bed in the early hours of the morning.
‘Let’s not think about it now. Today is for better things.’ Harry offered him his hand once again and they left the empty shop and made their way towards Notre Dame. They walked around to the West Façade, Draco’s favourite, and he took in the sheer immensity of the gothic architecture.
Harry was looking at him that way he used to. Like Draco was the centre of the universe and nothing else mattered. His face was so close, his breath ghosting over Draco’s face and he wanted nothing more than to kiss him again. So, he did.
‘Well, sounds like someone needs some brain fuel, huh?’ He took him over to the fridge and pulled out a yoghurt before sitting him down next to Ella. He pulled the lid off the yoghurt pot before Johnny could get to it – one time, Draco hadn’t been paying enough attention and Johnny had managed to fling the whole pot across the room and splatter it everywhere.
He watched through the glass as Harry adjusted Teddy’s grip on the broom. He had always loved watching them interact with each other, so much so that he often forgot that Teddy wasn’t biologically theirs. Not that it made any difference as far as Draco was concerned. He watched as they kicked off the ground and flew out across the neighbouring fields until they were out of sight.
“And why the hell are you letting them do this?!” Pansy rounded on Draco. She was running behind the three of them as he was escorted out of his home, her thin heels clacking loudly on the marble flooring in the hall. There was no way to explain himself to her without implicating himself further in the accusation. He could only look at her pleadingly.
He was disrupted from his perusal of the file by a knock on his office door. It still felt a bit strange to have his own office, but it was a lot warmer up here and he wasn’t about to complain. Not with his circulatory issues.
The woman produced two sets of paperwork for the Hit Wizards to fill in and she was joined by a stooped middle-aged man who was the first to speak to Draco directly. Luckily the paperwork meant Draco was temporarily released from the tight grip on his upper arms, although his hands were still bound.
“I rather got the impression it’s Sirius’ fault they’re not on speaking terms. I brought his reply for you to read; I’m not sure where you want to go from here.” He wished he could enjoy them finally being civilised with each other. He wished he could fully take in the phenomenon of her coming to his flat like this. But all he could think about was that man’s faced overlaid on hers. They weren’t just similar; they were
‘He had…strict principles we were expected to adhere to,’ he said eventually. He tried to say as little as he could to satisfy his healer without having to say much. It didn’t seem to work.
He could feel sweat trickling down his neck and for a moment he wished he was in a wizard club, so he could cast a cooling charm. Then he realised he was so smashed that even if he could get his wand out – Draco snorted aloud at that – he wouldn’t be in any state to cast a charm effectively.
Harry broke away first, his expression was worn and the bags under his eyes made Draco feel so guilty for waking him up. ‘Are you ok?’ His thumbs skimmed Draco’s cheekbones as he looked at him with concern. His lips were cherry red, and all Draco wanted to do was keep kissing him until he’d poured all his heart into him.
‘DRACO!’ She yelled with a lung capacity completely disproportionate to her small size. She launched herself at him and although he caught her expertly, she knocked the air he’d only just recovered right out of his chest.
Harry’s look of disbelief melts into a charming smile. “Nothing. It’s just that that was the first ever Gryffindor password in first year.”
‘I can’t very well say I’ll forgive you and then rub it in your face every chance I get, can I? It’s not right and it’s not proper.’ There was a finality in Draco’s tone that stopped Harry questioning him. He went back to his pancake batter which by now was probably completely useless.
Harry had promised Ron that he was only allowing the fox to stay in the flat until he could figure out what to do with it, but that wasn’t exactly true. Straight away he was drawn to it. After all, why would a silver fox just
‘I WON’T FORGET YOU!’ Teddy yelled frantically in his ear. Yeah, this is definitely why Harry always did this.
‘We’ll find a way to fix it. I promise.’ Draco didn’t like to be promised anything, but he didn’t argue. ‘Thank you for showing me this. Although I have to say, I’m glad it didn’t work out in a way. I can’t imagine what life would’ve been like if you’d stayed here.’ Draco had never thought about that.
“What?” His face was mere inches from hers and it was impossible not to see how perfectly her face matched the man in his dream; everything fit feature for feature. But those eyes. He’d seen those eyes somewhere else too. Somewhere long before he’d had that dream, but he didn’t know where.
‘You’re too good to her.’ Harry said when she was far enough away to be out of earshot. Daphne had opened the salon even though it was supposed to be closed just so that she could give Ella her first haircut. Draco had had the idea weeks ago when he’d noticed her hair was getting too long to be manageable but had been so busy, he’d totally forgotten to arrange anything.
‘I really like him. I have friends in all the houses, but we don’t get to spend as much time with each other.’ Harry started asking Teddy about quidditch – he’d been keen to get him interested in the sport since he was tiny. He’d told Draco he bought Teddy a toy broomstick for his first birthday because Sirius had done the same for him. He could be really sweet like that. Teddy liked quidditch, but Draco couldn’t see him being much of a player himself – although he did always join in with a family game at the Weasley’s.
He headed home to get changed before he went to pick up Teddy. Normally Harry fed Teddy before he went to Draco’s since Draco used to work late on a Friday, which no one hated more than him. Ok, Harry probably hated it more, but that wasn’t exactly a surprise.
Walking in the opposite direction of the apsen trees, he passed the rock garden and the orchard. The apple trees were far from bearing fruit at this time of year, which was disappointing, so he strode on past them. He came to an old shed structure he couldn’t remember the purpose of until he kicked open the stuck bolt.
When he’s ready, he rushes back over to where Harry sits with the laptop still open and shows him what he’s done. Harry looks over his shoulder in disbelief.
‘I really couldn’t say. A potion is more conventional, as pills are far more muggle and not as easy accepted among a lot of wizards. Having said that, private clinics often trial more experimental drugs and apothecaries have been trying to create pill style treatments for their longer shelf life.’
‘Johnny wet the bed again,’ she whispered, ‘He went to see Matron.’ Matron was the orphanage’s onsite nurse. They’d tried their best to find a woman who would be motherly rather than the slightly brusque Madam Pomfrey. Johnny, a little boy whose parents had gone missing just a couple of years ago before the last of the Death Eaters had finally been found, was still having terrible nightmares despite only being three.
Teddy ran off to get his broom, but Harry hung back a minute. ‘You ok love?’ He looked at him with such tenderness and worry that he just wanted to pull him close and ask him never to go anywhere without him ever again – but he wouldn’t. Teddy was too excited, and he was glad they’d have a little bit of time together that they might not have had otherwise.
He was glad it was Molly and Arthur’s turn to host Christmas, although he had a hunch they’d have volunteered anyway considering the circumstances. The only houses in the family big enough to house everyone were Harry and Draco’s, The Burrow and George and Angelina’s new place in Eastbourne. Between their half-unpacked house and Draco’s current state of low energy, it was the only logical option. According to Harry, the whole Weasley clan had been very worried about him when they’d heard what had happened, although Draco didn’t feel like that excused all that had gone before.
‘Draco, I owe you an apology.’ Hermione said. They sat in his flat on a bitterly cold, later October afternoon, cocooned in woollen blankets and scarves and plied with endless amounts of tea. Draco had slowly been reducing his coffee intake, realising how bad it had been for his anxiety.
‘I just wanted to get it right. It would have to go through so much testing and trials, and I’d have needed so many stamps of approval. I didn’t mind testing it out on myself since I would only have me to blame, but if I had opened the shop and hurt someone because I brewed it wrong… It’s people’s lives. They deserve someone who’s dedicated to the cause.’
They walked together to Grimmauld Place on autopilot. It assuaged a little of Harry’s guilt knowing that it couldn’t have been too long since he last saw Sirius if he still knew the way like the back of his hand.
“Do you think you would have been burned off the tapestry?” He asked when there was enough space between them to fit a hippogriff. He tried to keep his voice steady but
‘I’m sorry…’ He heard himself say but it sounded warped as the cold feeling in his body made his head swim. He’d sounded like his father – he’d always been terrified of turning into his father. He looked down at Ella and tucked a loose curl behind her ear.
‘We can deal with that later. Now I need to rest.’ He turned to the bed – probably the largest bed he’d ever seen in his life, and noticed the sheets were his favourite shade of forest green. His pyjamas were already folded neatly at the foot of the bed, but he moved them away. Harry noticed the action but didn’t say a word. Draco took Harry’s coat from him and hung it next to his carefully, before stripping out of the clothes that had already absorbed some of the chill. He didn’t know why, but it seemed important for him to do this. It wasn’t as if Harry had never seen him naked before, of course he had, but it felt as though it were a watershed moment where Draco could consciously bare all to him both physically and emotionally. He felt Harry’s eyes on him as each garment was removed – he felt his gaze burning into his skin and it sent shivers down his spine at the odd intimacy of the situation.
His eyes roamed her appearance and although he was distracted by the heavy thumping of his heart in his chest, he found he was able to notice almost every detail of her. She was barefoot for starters and it reminded him of Luna Lovegood who often went barefoot. Had Harry been watching Luna, there would have been nothing unusual about her barefooted-ness. Lyra Malfoy however, the woman sitting on the stool, was far more proper than Luna and going barefoot was simply not the Malfoy way. It was even more strange to Harry that she was wearing yet more rings on her exposed toes. She was wearing a floaty dress with flowers all over it and a denim jacket, both of which must have been borrowed because Harry couldn’t imagine them being anything Malfoy would ever wear in a million years. Even her hair was wrapped around some kind of purple flower Harry couldn’t name. If it wasn’t for the pointedness of her features and the chill in her eyes when they locked with his, he would have thought she was someone else entirely.
The dizzying underwater feeling slammed back into him with such force his knees almost buckled. More flashes flew across his vision. The man, who he knew now to be Draco, yanking his arm away from Madam Malkin during a fitting sometime around their sixth year. Harry throwing punch after punch after a quidditch match until Madam Hooch had to pull him away, leaving the boy on the ground before him dazed and bloody. He remembered the rage he felt, the animosity between them, but then he saw a wall of fire and felt that desperate need to
Granger was clearly uncomfortable with his silence. “She called every lawyer in the city but none of them were prepared to help.”
He stumbled out of the floo in the Manor drawing room, feeling rather lightheaded, when he collided with something solid and smelling strongly of vanilla.
Most of what they found were revisions of pureblood rituals and traditions. Half of them made no sense at all and the ones that did were so old and barbaric that even Draco couldn’t face reading them. One of the more grotesque ones suggested that if a pureblood patriarch died without leaving an heir, his genitals should be dipped in a preservation potion and used posthumously.
“No, I’m not.” He kept his voice flat, hoping that if he could feign disinterest, Granger might let the subject lie. He lent forward and poured himself and Pansy a second cup of tea. Granger was so preoccupied she’d hardly touched hers.
‘I will. Love you.’ He gave Draco one last over-tight hug when Draco gratefully returned, committing to memory how Teddy felt and smelled just in case he might forget.
‘I always forget how well you can sing until Christmas comes around,’ he mused as Draco threw tinsel over him. They banned magic from the Christmas tree decorating, purely on principle. The first Christmas Draco and Harry spent together they both realised they’d never decorated their own tree. Draco because he’d never celebrated Christmas outside of Hogwarts, and Harry because his aunt and uncle had never let him. They both made it a point to decorate their tree themselves. Draco hadn’t even bothered getting a tree after the divorce, it didn’t feel right without Harry.
It felt like the tapestry was calling out to him and he closed his eyes so he wouldn’t find his gaze wandering towards it. His stomach swooped with wave upon wave of emotions he couldn’t fully decipher, and he felt his eyes itch with hot tears that he didn’t understand. Why would a single name make him feel so cast out and untethered? He didn’t remember lying down, but he could feel the soft material of the transfigured sofa pressing against his cheek. It didn’t stop his head swimming, but it was a relief not to have to hold himself up anymore. He jumped when he felt his head being lifted but he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes. There was a rustle of clothing and a dip in the sofa and suddenly his head was resting on something warm and solid.
‘What are you doing here? You’re going to ruin that dress,’ he pointed at the long hem resting on the dirt track.
, when he was unceremoniously deposited on the kitchen floor. Instinctively, he darted into the corner, his paws slipping across the smooth floor and making it difficult for him not to slam into things as he went. The growl he heard was as much Draco as the fox. The weasel retreated, for once being the more sensible of the two imbeciles. A contradiction in terms if ever there was one.
‘We’re happy to let you leave, as long as you have someone to stay with you while you recuperate, preferable with a next of kin. Which, if memory serves,’ the healer flicked through Draco’s file, ‘is the other Mr Potter.’ Draco couldn’t think straight; his heart was beating at a hundred miles an hour. He glanced warningly at Harry who squeezed his hand. It was a useless gesture since he could hardly feel it, but he did see it and he supposed it would have to do.
Draco’s fingers made their way to Harry’s hair the way they always did. It was getting just a little too long again but that hardly mattered right now. Harry broke the kiss so that he could kiss Draco’s jaw and neck. He automatically moved his head to the side to give him better access.
He leaves some of the rustic wood surface in view in the gaps between the books and he intersperses some of the white hydrangea he has in a vase nearby. It takes a few minutes of adjusting the position of the books exactly how he likes them before he’s prepared to take the camera anywhere near them. Once he’s happy, quickly he snaps a few photos from different angles, plays with the brightness and the saturation just a bit because the light isn’t brilliant.
‘Nothing to worry about,’ he said casually. ‘Have I missed anything?’ Helen smiled and pulled her long blonde hair over her shoulder. It was much more of a honey blonde than Draco’s own, but whenever he took a minute to look at her appearance, a wave of insecurity washed over him.
‘Hey buddy,’ he said, kneeling down in front of Teddy. For the first time ever, Teddy didn’t turn away from Draco and go straight to Harry. Harry seemed to realise from this that something serious was going on.
‘Of course not. I just wasn’t feeling very well that’s all. I’m fine, you don’t have to worry.’ Draco did his best to reassure him, but it wasn’t really his strong suit.
‘Not today, darling. He’s at home. Where I should be.’ He cast a sideways glance at Hermione who nodded.
It’s also quite new to him to be allowed to take genuine pride in what he has achieved. Although he used to boast a lot when he was younger, it was always about things he had been given, or things his father had done that he thought were great. Until he started dating Harry, it never occurred to him to take pride in himself as a person.
He walked back into the kitchen as if he hadn’t heard a thing and sat down with the pair of them. Teddy sat next to Harry but dashed to the seat opposite Draco, as if he thought he would disappear if he couldn’t see him.
Suddenly she was alert. She stopped leaning against the table, the quick movement causing the splayed pages of the book to rustle and reorganise themselves around the bookmark. “Me?” She asked him with wide eyes, her hands twitching at her sides, “What on earth for?”
‘Don’t fall asleep just yet. There’s one more thing I wanted to give you. I’ve been keeping it back until after the festivities.’ Draco frowned and thought about pushing himself back up, but he was too comfortable. As it happened, Harry manoeuvred him upright anyway. ‘Please at least pretend to be awake or I’ll look like a first-class prick.’ Harry laughed nervously and suddenly he had Draco’s full attention. What was so important? Harry pulled a small box out of his trouser pocket and Draco forgot how to breathe.
They sat in silence for a long time. Draco stared at the clock on the wall opposite. Five minutes. Ten. Fifteen. Twenty.
‘What am I supposed to say to him, Mum? I know you never fully warmed to him, but you knew he’s a good person, didn’t you? I thought he was a good person, but I’m not so sure now.’ A gust of wind blew through the thick fabric of his coat and it wasn’t enough to prevent him from shivering.
‘You remember I told you Smith said I have repressed memories?’ She nodded. ‘Is there a way that I could use those to solve this magic problem?’
‘Ok. Just focus on me and you’ll be fine. Can you do that?’ Draco nodded, unable to trust his voice. Harry’s hand sought his and the minute their fingers intertwined something loosened in Draco’s chest. He was still terrified, his pulse thudding heavily in his ears, but it was still easier to breathe. He let Harry guide him carefully through the crowds, focusing on the back of his head and trying to remember how it felt to run his fingers through his dark hair. Draco’s grip on his hand was vice-like and he hoped Harry wouldn’t hate him too much for hurting him.
‘Hey little wolf.’ Draco said, his voice scratchy. He glanced over Teddy’s shoulder to see Harry standing there holding Eltanin’s cage, a conflicted look on his face. Draco supposed it was a mix between the hatred he was feeling towards Draco mixed with the empathy he felt at the fact this this was a tough day for the both of them.
When Spungen reappeared, Draco got such a shock he hiccupped around his own breath. Harry sniggered and he shot him a glare.
He waits politely for Malfoy to close the door behind him and lead him into the house. Despite the bright day, the interior is particularly dim, and Harry thinks it must be pretty depressing to live in a place like this. Especially with all the memories Malfoy must have.
‘Oh. Yes, absolutely. How can I help?’ He said awkwardly, straightening his already perfectly straight tie.
‘Potter wanted me to invite you to his birthday next week.’ Pansy said quietly after a few minutes of peaceful silence. Draco’s last scan of this particular sample ricochet off the workbench as his concentration slipped. He put his wand down to avoid destroying his remaining samples by accident.
“I think we have a visitor,” Potter was saying, but Draco wasn’t paying much attention. He was quickly calculating what he could do to make damn sure he could stay in this place. Only then would he be able to get Potter back.
Draco felt like a fool. He hadn’t really meant to say what he had. Did he really think he loved Harry more than Harry loved him? He hadn’t even realised that was an issue for him. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he had thought that once they’d finally gotten around to talking, it would be some kind of light switch moment. If anything, he’d only become more closed off since. It was as though letting himself be vulnerable had sent his anxiety into overdrive.
“I know. And I don’t think we need to share hobbies, it’s good that we’re interested in different things – it gives us plenty to talk about. But Granger and I have very different tastes in books. Actually, sometimes I think she says she hates a book I love on purpose just to annoy me.” Draco huffs, finally locating his second Donna Tartt novel. Harry laughs again, although this time it’s more like a quick little puff.
‘Oh, sweetheart please don’t cry.’ He pulled her into his arms and rocked her gently. He had to admit that he sometimes forgot how young she was because she was so bright for her age. She sobbed into his shirt and his chest ached for her. He’d been quite a prissy child himself and he’d always been furious whenever Pansy ruined his toys. Luckily for him he was an only child and he could easily get away from it.
‘Thank you.’ Harry said to the elf who bowed graciously and disappeared again. He poured the tea and Draco was grateful since he knew his own hands shook too much. When Harry pressed a teacup into Draco’s cool fingers and took his seat, the silence couldn’t hold any longer.
Harry met them downstairs and signed the sheet with the time of their departure. Ella was holding tightly onto Draco’s hand and bouncing excitedly on the balls of her feet. Draco only hoped the surprise would live up to her expectation.
Because, as Draco turned over, the sleeping face of his ex-husband was on the pillow, right next to his. It had been so long since Draco had been lucky enough to witness this that he couldn’t even be angry. The air was knocked out of his lungs as he took in the sight before him.
“Harry?” Sirius rasped. It sounded like he hadn’t used his voice for a long time. Perhaps he hadn’t.
Draco was utterly shell-shocked as he slid out of the bed and stood in the middle of his old bedroom wondering whether he should run away now or stay and face the consequences. He always left after a one-night stand. But then, his one-night stands weren’t Harry. If he left now, he could be at work before Harry woke up and Harry would just assume that his random shag just disappeared. Maybe he wouldn’t even remember bringing anyone home at all. How drunk had Harry been anyway? Draco wasn’t sure.
the dead? Because one would establish a moving connection with the other side and the other would effectively have us fishing for corpses.” The word had been niggling away at him, but he’d only just figured out why. The colour drained from Granger’s face and she pursed her lips in thought. She turned back to the watermarked pages and scanned them again.
‘How isn’t it any different? I know you and Harry had a talk. He wouldn’t tell us what it was about, but he seemed really please you two were making progress. He even thought you might be on your way to being friends again!’ Her poor pasta dish was being massacred by her fork as she took her frustration out on her food.
“Where am I?” Draco’s voice was gravelly and low but at least he had a voice, which meant he was back in his human form, and suggest that the thing which had hit him in the back was most likely an un-transfiguring spell. As far as he could tell, his back had suffered no lasting damage, but the cold that had been brewing when he’d left the Manor had gone full throttle in the time he had been out. He had barely had time to register that he had finally achieved his transformation and now he didn’t feel much like celebrating. He was cold, he felt ill, and there was a general air of misery around him.
“Potter is going to explain a few things to us, aren’t you Potter?” She dropped him in it without even looking up from the board even though it was Ron’s turn and he wasn’t the slightest bit interested in the game anymore.
‘How much do I owe you?’ He asked Daphne as Ella scuttled off, her now much shorter curls bouncing prettily behind her.
‘I’ll do this, you’ve had a long day already,’ he said softly. Draco wasn’t sure since Harry wasn’t exactly the most eloquent person he knew, but Teddy listened to him, trusted him more than anyone.
He took Granger up to one of the libraries in the North Wing, where his father’s study remained locked at all times. They left Pansy downstairs to amuse herself, which probably meant she would try to teach herself the Chopin he’d left open on the piano, even though she hadn’t had a single lesson and couldn’t read music.
‘I have a surprise for you.’ Draco looked up from his journal when Harry entered the library room. It wasn’t really a library, just a room with a comfy sofa, a few bookshelves and Draco’s rare tea collection. Still, Draco was nothing if not pretentious.
Harry was stunned. He had watched Draco in the Great Hall during every mealtime for seven years and never once had he seen him have less than impeccable table manners. Yet here he was, stood in the middle of Harry’s kitchen, eating standing up, with hummus covered fingers.
“Bloody hell, Harry. Can’t you shut him up with something? Silencing spell? Literally anything!” Ron grumbled every morning at the breakfast table. Harry wasn’t much of a morning person, but Ron was even less so.
“Restore it?” Lyra seemed shocked and had gone very white. “Why would you want to do that? Surely now is the time to destroy it.”
‘Yes sir. As you wish.’ He disappeared with a pop and Draco went to join Harry. He sat opposite him, curling his feet underneath him. They sat in silence, staring at each other creepily. Draco didn’t want to go first and he didn’t want to be interrupted by Spungen bringing their tea. After a little while, Harry got up to light the fire the muggle way. Draco wouldn’t have bothered but he guessed Harry wanted something to do with his hands.
‘Unca Hawwy?’ She asked him, pouting at him and blinking rapidly. It amused him that already Rose could be such a flirt. Hermione would be furious.
Draco could feel the stubble Harry had regrown catching on his chin as their jaws worked. It sent a strange thrill up his spine for a reason he couldn’t identify and despite the strange circumstances, he felt like he was coming home. Harry’s lips were always warm and comforting, and this time when he pulled on Draco’s bottom lip, Draco did nothing to stop him.
‘Because you’re really pretty and people think you’re poisonous but you’re not really. And everyone thinks Daddy’s fantastic at everything so you can’t love him because you’re bad. It’s a bit like rhubarb though, the stems make great pie, but the leaves are poisonous. It’s good and bad but you can’t have one without the other.’ Draco’s brain couldn’t process that.
Harry shook his head and walked into the classroom, wondering why Draco wanted to meet him by the lake of all places. Summer had hit Scotland unseasonably hard already, even though it was only mid-June, and Draco would surely not want to spend much time outside being as pale as he was. The temperature was rapidly climbing into the thirties and Professor McGonagall had been forced to relax their uniform code to account for the boiling hot castle. Harry had rolled his sleeves up to his elbows and loosened his tie.
‘Experiemental procedure? What did you do to me? Do people not normally recover from that kind of thing?’
“Yes, it will. If you want to do something for someone else for once in your life, you can start by not being a judgemental prick.” She was so taken aback by the force with which he spoke that she almost dropped her guitar on the floor. Luckily, he caught it by its neck with his seeker’s reflexes, dropping his coat that he had picked up when he had been preparing to leave.
Harry had never seen anything like it. He had seen a fox before, obviously, but usually they were a burnt orange sort of colour. This one was a soft greyish-white and was currently pawing furiously at the wooden flooring. As the light from the kitchen shone over it, it looked up at Harry with eyes so light he could almost see right through them, and began whining in a horrible high-pitched screech. It was such an unusual sight that he stood there staring at the creature as if it would disappear if he looked away. When it sensed that its whining wasn’t having much effect, it came over to Harry and started pawing at his legs instead. It seemed rather domesticated for a fox, Harry was under the impression that they were often violent things, and his first thought was that it was someone’s escaped pet.
‘Why can’t we just get along, Draco?’ Harry asked him tiredly, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses.
“Really? I suppose it makes sense; fire-breathing dragons, Gryffindors. You Gryffindors are pretty hot-headed… but I can pick something else if you want…”
“All done!” Luna announced happily. For Harry it was disappointing – he wanted an excuse to hold onto his fox forever. Reluctantly, he put him down on the table again, although he stuck close. “So, are you going to give him a name?”
Harry’s hair was a knotted mess all over the pillow and Draco desperately wanted to run his fingers through it once more. He daren’t though, since he knew how much of a light sleeper Harry was. Harry was pouting in his sleep and his eyelashes were fluttering as he dreamed and if Draco wasn’t absolutely terrified of his current situation, he’d think it was the most adorable sight in the world.
Ron clapped him on the back before taking the floo back to the flat. No words were exchanged between them, but they didn’t have to be. Ron had already followed him to the end and back again.
He thought about where he should go. He was burning with anger and he needed an outlet. Going home would only make him feel more caged, but he was still waiting for Hermione to come through on the favour he’d asked her. He couldn’t go to the orphanage, he’d probably terrify the small children who were too young to be at school yet.
‘I don’t want them to get used to me,’ he admitted. ‘It’s not my job to be here and they need to understand that.’ She sipped her tea and her brow furrowed.
‘So you thought pushing and pushing me would help? It took years to clear my name enough that I could walk down the street without getting hexed within an inch of my life. You can’t expect the world to change overnight. I did some really terrible things and I can’t expect the whole world to forgive me just because you have.’
‘It’s not bad. I quite like having you to myself too.’ He pulled Draco against his side and kissed his cheek quickly. Draco pretended his cheeks didn’t flush like a teenager.
‘I don’t want to,’ Teddy mumbled. Curling up into Draco like a small kid. His heart ached, it really did. He was such a sweet boy.
‘Don’t give up the day job.’ Harry swatted at him, but he couldn’t help but crack a smile. Thankfully, Gabriel gave them some other pastries to enjoy in case their own weren’t all they were cracked up to be. Draco would’ve been offended at his lack of confidence in his culinary expertise, but as one of his mille-feuille sank in the middle he thought that was probably for the best.
‘I’ve got this Harry.’ Kingsley rested his elbows on his desk and paused as though choosing his words carefully. ‘We’ve been keeping tabs on anyone with connections to the Death Eaters. In recent months, Albert Runcorn has been spotted numerous times with Mafalda Hopkirk.’ Draco’s brows furrowed.
‘I’ll never be as clever as you! But…I think…well, it’s a bit stupid, I only just went to school…’ Teddy dropped his hands under the table, looking self-conscious suddenly.
He didn’t want to move when he woke up the following morning. It wasn’t a regular occurrence that they woke up still wrapped up in each other. More often than not, they moved apart during their sleep, and on the occasions that they didn’t, Draco usually found himself as Harry’s human pillow. That morning, Draco woke up nearly on top of Harry, like he’d tried to climb into him in his sleep. He should move, he knew he should, he just didn’t want to. He got to have this to himself. A sleepy Harry, with a sweet little pout and even messier hair than usual. No one got to see him like this except Draco, and he was the luckiest man in the world.
She shrugged. “Better than ‘the posh twat’.” Just then Aspen came scampering back into the room. He went over to his water bowl, stuck his entire head in it, flicked water all over the floor, then jumped up and put his head in Harry’s lap.
‘And yet I’m here.’ Draco’s heart pounded, his head span, his mind was racing at a hundred miles an hour.
‘Are you my friend?’ She looked up at him hopefully with her big brown eyes. It was a loaded question and one he knew he shouldn't answer.
“The bloody hell is that racket?” Ron was standing behind Harry and blocked the kitchen light, plunging the fox back into the darkness of the hallway. The fox immediately ceased making a sound and Harry could vaguely make out the fox curling up at his feet, its fur acting like a mini furnace.
‘I miss you.’ Harry said abruptly. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. He didn’t need this. Not now.
At the beginning of his second week on the case, he was preparing blood samples to analyse them for rare compounds when he got a surprise visit.
‘You can’t stay here Draco. You can go backwards, or you can go forwards, but you can’t stay here.’ She told him quietly. He was confused.
‘Gosh! You gave me a fright, you sneaky devil.’ He grinned at her early morning enthusiasm and passed her a plate. ‘Are the others up yet?’ He asked her.
‘He did?’ Draco couldn’t image why Harry would do that. Draco had barely scratched the surface with this case. In fact, he was waiting for Kingsley himself to come down and tell him to get his shit together. Maybe not quite in those words.
She was really quite fluent in body language. That, or Draco knew her far too well. He supposed that if what Granger had said was true, and a Malfoy really was involved, there would be a paper trail back to the Manor. There was over a century’s worth of material stored up within the house’s many twisting corridors and hidden rooms.
‘He’s Belgian Potter you heathen. Cut him some slack anyway,’ he said tiredly, ‘it’s not easy being the most intelligent person in the room. He has to let off some steam somehow.’
‘When Harry?’ If he couldn’t be honest about this then it only went to show how much of it all had been a lie.
‘She told you about that?’ He was very surprised, he assumed Hermione wouldn’t say a word. Although, in her defence, he hadn’t said she couldn’t.
‘This variety is untraceable in the bloodstream by diagnostic magic if combined with the right ingredients. Someone was definitely keen to cover their tracks. I have the magical signature on file, so it will be traceable if anyone comes across it again. I’ll need to consult with the healer overseeing the patients in order to reverse engineer a cure.’
They sit quietly like that for a while. Draco doesn’t shed any more tears, but Harry still feels helpless. It hurts that no matter how much he loves Draco, nothing he is or can be will ever fill the space of his twin. Draco takes hold of Harry’s hand, the one that isn’t in Draco’s hair, and starts playing with Harry’s fingers. It’s something Harry has noticed he does when he’s nervous.
He wheeled around, drawing his wand without even realising he was doing it. Potter was looking at him with a look of such pity it made him feel sick. He didn’t want Potter’s stupid pity, he’d been chosen for this. He had to do it. He threw a hex at Potter which missed and hit the wall behind him. Potter flung his whole body sideways and flicked his wand. Draco blocked the jinx easily and aimed another.
Granger watched the two of them as if she wasn’t supposed to be there. He thought about whether she had begun to like him, or whether she had only been putting up with him for the sake of Pansy and the chance to sort this mess out with Potter. She had stayed in the Manor on a number of occasions whilst they’d been planning, but of course Pansy’s guest rooms were at the opposite side of the house from his. And then there was that strange moment the night before when she had thanked him…
‘Of course! They’re just through there.’ Daphne pointed towards a white door Draco hadn’t even noticed before.
‘I know. I guess we’re all just suckers for a happy ending.’ She sighed. ‘Hey, it’s getting late, do you mind if I stay for tonight?’
“Unless you can transform into a cat or an owl, you’re going to be conspicuous walking through the Ministry, even if you do manage to keep to the shadows.”
Granger looked as if she was going to say something sentimental but a glare from him had her changing directions.
The case was actually going well. Draco knew it would take him a few weeks to analyse the pills Harry had been given at the clinic. He’d said that Healer Matthews had all but thrown them into his hands and told him they fix almost anything. Draco was certain that these were the pills that had caused the problem, but he’d need to use muggle techniques to analyse their contents and whilst he had some knowledge of the subject, he would have to be much more careful. Muggles didn’t get instantaneous results, so Draco would have to wait a while before he knew exactly what he was dealing with.
‘I made peace with your choices a long time ago baby. Your father tried, but we can’t all be perfect.’ She smiled at him gently, and for the first time in a long time Draco craved the old times when she’d kiss his knees when he’d played too hard and fallen over, or she’d spend hours trying to tame the naturally wavy hair he’d inherited from the Blacks just because his father said, “it’s not becoming of a Malfoy”.
‘There you go then,’ Harry said with a smile and kissed him again. ‘I don’t care what anyone else thinks, I care what you think.’
‘The healers said there could be accidental magic as part of the adjustment. I’m not worried,’ He shrugged. He frowned which she shook her head and rolled her eyes.
‘I don’t need to go home, sweetheart. This is home.’ He watched Teddy’s face very carefully. At first, he started to frown. His brow didn’t quite furrow properly before surprise registered.
He still couldn’t figure out why they couldn’t find any concrete evidence which linked Harry’s suspects to the case. Everything they had was purely circumstantial and despite the fact that Harry seemed convinced the case was sewn up nicely, Draco had a niggling feeling that there was something glaringly obvious missing.
‘I was thinking wizard actually. I heard about a new French place that opened on Diagon when I was at St Mungo’s.’ He watched Harry’s face carefully for his reaction. There wasn’t so much as a twitch anywhere on his face and Draco began to think he’d said something stupid. Of course Harry wouldn’t want to go out. He’d been at the orphanage all day working hard and then he’d come home, and Draco had slept while he cried. It wasn’t exactly a great set up for an impromptu date night.
Back in his office he decided on a game plan for his departure. He decided to create a giant pin board, like the ones he’d seen on muggle detective shows, and map out all the evidence and theories he had so far, so that anyone who was working on the case after him would know where he was going with it. On the muggle shows, they usually started with the suspects in the middle and worked their way out but since Draco wasn’t still wholly convinced Harry’s prime suspects were part of the case, he decided to start with the victims, and work his way backwards.
‘I’m sorry Mr Malfoy, the Minister is fully booked all afternoon. Perhaps you should try asking for an appointment further in advance?’ Kingsley’s bitch of a secretary told Draco with an oversweet voice and a derogatory look.
It was easily past midnight by the time Draco made it to bed. He noticed a half-eaten pasta bowl in the kitchen and he felt marginally better knowing Harry had at least eaten something, even if Draco hadn’t seen him again for the rest of the night.
Maybe he just wasn’t capable of becoming and animagus. He stood there in the middle of the storm for more than forty-five minutes hoping that something would happen. When it didn’t, he decided to go back to bed and salvage some sleep before the dawn came. He cold and empty inside. All these months under house arrest and the one productive thing he had done had come to nothing. What a waste.
‘Oh! Really? Well, I suppose that’s alright then.’ Molly looked a lot older than she had the last time he’d seen her. She was nearly completely grey now, and the bags under her eyes betrayed how tired she really was. He could relate – watching the children at the orphanage for one afternoon drained the life out of him and he knew full well she saw a lot of her grandchildren.
Draco looked up at Harry nervously, biting his lip so hard he nearly drew blood. Dare he have hope that this was the piece he needed?
‘You’re so boring. Draco never makes me do homework.’ Oh dear, Draco might have spent a little too much time with her recently.
‘Is that necessary? It’s ok if you don’t want me involved, but I can give you space when you need it. I’m always out somewhere doing things for the orphanage anyway.’
‘You still knew what I was laughing for. I count that as an admission of guilt.’ Draco’s stomach flipped as Harry pressed him into his side. Harry was warm and familiar and smelled like home and Draco wanted to bury himself in the feeling. Except it was tarnished with the knowledge – or lack therefore – of what was going on between Harry and Wood. Near death experiences or not, Draco wouldn’t play second fiddle to anyone.
He shook hands with Arthur, whom he hadn’t had much chance to talk to all day, and he reassured him it was good to see him at The Burrow again. Molly attacked him with bear hugs and berated him for not coming to visit more often, only letting them go once he’d made his promises to stop by in the new year.
The wards emanate from the house itself where the magic is strongest. Up in the eaves it’s easiest for him to get at the basic structure of the Manor where centuries of magical enchantments are layered over themselves.
“Draco, no. This has to stop. Don’t you think you’ve had enough hummus for now? You’ll make yourself sick of it and then you’ll never get to enjoy it again.” He was looking at Draco helplessly now. It wasn’t the end of the world that Draco had developed a love of hummus, but Harry would quite like to be able to kiss him again without tasting garlic.
‘Yes!’ Teddy didn’t come to Diagon all that often, but he’d never once forgotten the combination, even though on the occasions they did go, it was often by apparition. If Draco thought the Leaky was busy, it was nothing compared to Diagon itself. It was so packed he couldn’t see one exposed cobble anywhere.
‘Nothing…I just thought t-that you wouldn’t be h-here and I’d have to w-wait all day to see you but you’re here n-now and I really, really, m-missed you and-’
‘You’re such a housewife.’ Harry laughed as he sat down next to Draco. He swung his legs up into Harry’s lap and he didn’t complain.
that was knocking around inside his skull also seemed to repel him, as if the name was a carefully guarded secret. It left his head thick and soupy, like he’d opened a door for something that could never go back again.
‘Un bâtard?’ He clutched his chest in feigned horror, ‘je n’aurais jamais!’ By this point Harry was flushed heavily and Draco thought he’d best stop teasing him.
‘And here I thought he was too cool for hugs.’ Harry said with an amused smirk as he reappeared and crossed the garden and handed Draco some water. He might’ve got a bit too tipsy earlier and under the hot summer sun Harry had started supplying him with water sometime after dinner.
‘Stop it!’ Myrtle shrieked and her voice echoed around the room, reverberating against the dirty tiled. ‘Stop! STOP!’ She had a set of lungs on her for a dead girl – Draco would give her that.
‘Alright Malfoy? Glad to see you’re still in the land of the living.’ Was the greeting Bill had given him when he sat down. That was fine though, he appreciated the Weasley tactic of dealing with trauma through humour. It was an excellent choice.
‘We love you too bud.’ Harry said with a fondness that made Draco’s heart swell with affection for his small, messy little family. He wouldn’t change them for the world.
“Next time we see each other I expect you to be more courteous.” She returned to that snotty, perfectionist sort of tone she’d had throughout school. “Believe it or not I’m trying to help both of us, and you’d better count your lucky stars I let Pansy talk me into it.” And with that she turned on her heel and marched out of the room with her nose in the air and her files clutched to her chest like schoolbooks.
‘Don’t you dare feel guilty. You’ve been through enough this year as it is without beating yourself up over Teddy. He loves you. Even if he is upset do you really think he’ll stay like that for long? He’d miss you far too much.’ Draco desperately hoped he was right, although they were due to pick him up in just under two hours, so it didn’t matter now either way.
‘Are you sure? You look pale…’ The worry lines Draco always wanted to smooth out were appearing again. He didn’t much like it.
“Oh I was so worried!” It was then that he realised they weren’t alone. Behind Pansy stood Blaise, Theo, Millie, and Greg. He never thought the six of them would ever be in the same place at the same time ever again, but there they were.
‘Hm, ok.’ Harry didn’t sound convinced but didn’t push him. The pressure on his spine stopped and he was about to whine in protest until Harry wrapped his arms around him fully. ‘Go back to sleep Draco,’ he mumbled in his ear. Draco had no idea what time it was but that sounded like a good idea.
‘Sorry. I, er, had a dream about my mother. And you. She used to love the waterlily house.’ He indicated off in the opposite direction where the greenhouse could just be seen in the distance. ‘I’d brought her here for a little trip out.’ Harry squeezed his hand. He was grateful they were walking as it meant he didn’t have to look at him and he could focus on the crunch of gravel beneath their feet.
‘Why do you write in this thing so much?’ Harry asked him a couple of days later. It was unusual, but he’d had a strange dream and he wanted to write it down as soon as he woke up so he didn’t forget it. Draco paused mid-sentence to look at him. There was no anger on his face, but it didn’t seem like a good question.
‘This is great Malfoy. I really appreciate your support on this. I’ll have St Mungo’s contact you directly. I think in the future, you could accompany the aurors on any fieldwork concerning the case. The signature may be on file, but I’d be happier knowing someone with intimate knowledge of the issue is on hand at any given time.’
‘Finding the cause has proven much harder. It seems your magic had been with you since about a month after you were last admitted, however there appears to be significant mental scarring preventing you from using it. So, when you tried to cast the spell which brought you here, the lingering dark magic in your arm tried to fight it. We can’t figure out why the dark magic seems to be connected to your mental state, but it seems you’ll be spending a lot of time with your mind healer in the future.’ Draco groaned. He hated that twat with a passion.
‘Hey! My grandfather didn’t invent Sleekeasy’s so you could ruin my hair with flour!’ Harry reached for a second jar and dumped it right over Draco’s head.
He rested his arm against the wall as he got his breath back. The room was tiered to the bottom like a courtroom, but it was devoid of most of the benches. In a way it was like a gloomy, damp, British equivalent of the inside of the Colosseum. Except, in the centre of the room where a defendant would usually stand, there was a large rock on which was mounted a stone archway. The whispering they had heard when they opened the door was loudest here, and now he realised what it was.
Draco thought. Harry had learned to drive a muggle car and sometimes took Teddy out in it. Draco hated the thought of being trapped in a lump of metal hurtling down narrow lanes with nothing but a few bits of plastic to cushion the blow. He’d always take a broom over a car.
“I was trying to tell you about the huge engagement party Astoria is throwing. She wanted to know if it would be appropriate to invite you.” She stared at him with anticipation over the rim of her coffee cup but if it was an outburst she was looking for, she wouldn’t get one.
“Don’t you remember how much paperwork we had to fill out to allow me to move in? They only let Granger pass because they thought there was no way in hell she’d ever go against them. She’s still one of the golden ones.” Draco wasn’t quite so sure about that anymore; he was starting to see just how determined Granger was.
“I er, thought you might be able to help me with something. For Sirius. He said you see him sometimes?”
‘Um, yes, of course. Is everything ok?’ Harry shook his head and muttered something under his breath that Draco didn’t catch. He tried to ask him, but he was already turning tails and storming out.
‘Listen to me.’ Draco said slowly, placing his arms on her desk and leaning over her menacingly. ‘I can see we have a problem here and you can look at me like shit on the bottom of your shoe if you want to, but I’m here on top priority business and I’d appreciate it if you would speak to the Minister immediately.’ She swallowed audibly, and Draco could see his tactics were working. ‘I’m working on the Runcorn case.’ Her eyes widened, and she scrabbled around to find her wand which was buried under piles of poorly organised paperwork. Amateur.
‘Alright, alright, we’re coming.’ Harry said exasperatedly. Draco snorted because he was in fact an over-grown child. ‘Shut up you,’ Harry hissed in his ear before he let him go. They followed Teddy downstairs, having agreed to take the floo to The Burrow.
“I thought about that.” She took two slips of paper out of her pocket and handed them to Draco. They were two Ministry ID slips belonging to Jo March and Atticus Finch.
‘No, I did not. I assumed that since Harry has been referring to you as Malfoy, he is also unaware of this.’
Harry couldn’t help but watch Malfoy’s hands as she wrote to Remus. The way her long fingers twirled the pen every now and again was almost as mesmerising as watching her play her guitar. Each word was carefully and precisely placed on the page; each loop immaculate and perfectly uniform. He could watch her like this all day, head bent over the paper, brow slightly furrowed in concentration. Over the past few weeks and months he really felt like he was starting to see the person she was under her armour of insults and haughtiness. Even if there was still the occasional slip.
