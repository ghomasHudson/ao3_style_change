Draco can’t imagine what kind of personal business would involve accosting him at Malfoy manor, but he’s sure he wants no part in it. But his mother is giving him the look of calm collectedness she uses when she means business, so he pastes on a passable fake smile.
Potter had Flooed him in a panic, the night before, sounding increasingly frantic and incoherent.
“Oi, they invited themselves over, Malfoy. And they’re tolerable,” he replies.
Harry groans and covers his face. His friends are terrible.
“You couldn’t have picked a place with better weather?” he spits out.
friends, Potter.”
Draco smirks. “I know I’m delightful, Potter. It’s about time you finally agreed.”
Draco eventually bites out that he’s fine, but he’s secretly drinking in the sight of the other man.
Ron pats his shoulder comfortingly and goes back to his sandwich.
There’s just enough time to dodge the loud
“I’m tired of this conversation,” she says dramatically.
Especially when Potter begins coming home increasingly late, quietly eating dinner and falling into bed without much in the way of conversation.
Draco finally realizes that he might like Potter a little bit after he’s dragged the man to various tailors and bullied him into cooking him breakfast for dinner.
He admits he’s too distracted by the stretch of the warm, red Weasley sweater across Potter’s back to bother paying attention to the conversation.
“Of course, Potter. Please follow me,” he says, leading the way to a sitting room.
Draco can tell Potter is sucked into a new case soon after wrapping up the old.
“As you say.”
Malfoy pulls away a little while later. “Potter, not that I don’t enjoy kissing you, but Kreacher did spend a long time preparing this, and I would hate to ruin- what? Do I have something on my face?”
Draco falls asleep to the muted tones of their second favorite show.
He’s not prepared for the wave of affection he feels when Malfoy remembers the house-elf’s hard work.
He can practically feel the tension emanating off of Potter’s shoulders. After hesitating for a moment, he reaches over and digs his thumbs into the muscles.
Harry has this sudden moment of alcohol-induced clarity where he realizes that he might have just fucked everything up with one of the few people he genuinely likes talking to.
“Don’t tell Malfoy just yet,” the Minister says, tapping a quill against an ink well before he continues writing. “There’s no guarantee the info is accurate-“
There’s still a sour taste in Draco’s mouth as he gestures at a sofa.
“Was there something else? This has happened loads of times, Potter. There’s plenty of kids who’ve gotten mixed up in this. I’m not saying you don’t have every right to be cut up about it, but it just doesn’t usually-“
He zones back in briefly.
doing here?” Draco asks, not bothering to hide his disgust.
“Thanks, Hermione,” he says with a half-smile, but he gives her a kiss on the cheek when he leaves.
“Shut it, Malfoy,” he says with a half-smile, puts a hand on the other man’s cheek and kisses him.
Draco’s starting to become suspicious. “What’s this about?”
Harry wants to say that he’s not pining, but Ron raises his eyebrows like he’s daring him to disagree. So Harry keeps his mouth shut.
Potter, the simpleton, doesn’t seem to mind.
Harry is tired.
Harry nods solemnly. “-and there’s no point getting his hopes up if we’re wrong.”
He fails.
“Mate, I really don’t get why it had to be Malfoy. But if you don’t find him soon, I’ll look for him myself just so I can stop hearing you pine after him for ten more years.”
“I told you she’d want all the details if you told her.”
“Yes!” Malfoy says, gesturing wildly. “A bloody sign that says ‘Hello, you human dumpster fire, the man you’ve been madly in love with since first year is also in love with you and you may have permission to jump his bones!’”
Potter mulishly doesn’t respond until Draco pokes him in the ribs.
“Watch it, Scarhead,” Malfoy cuts in playfully. “It almost sounds like you listened to any of the drivel that came out of my mouth at Hogwarts.”
“I told you before. We just want to send a message to your Head Auror over there. And then we’ll be off. Nothing happens to us, nothing happens to you,” he sneers. “Him, on the other hand, there’s not much hope for him. But you’ve never truly liked him, so you might as well drop the act. We all know you’ve been undercover this whole-“
“Yes, yes, Potter,” Malfoy says impatiently. “It’s all very important, and I appreciate your concern. I’ll move into your place and bring all my trauma with me tomorrow. Now will you please get these bloody clothes off? I have ten years to make up for.”
“I said what I said.”
There’s a splash followed by a thud.
Potter slumps down next to him, tucking a socked foot under him, and sticks his hand out.
He doesn’t realize the words are out of his mouth before he hears the clatter of a glass and a quiet swear as Malfoy starts mopping up the spilled drink.
“Just a moment, Potter.”
Harry doesn’t get it, but he nods decisively anyway.
Potter pulls away from the previously stolen and recently recovered python, looking extremely guilty. The last sibilant hiss of whatever words he was muttering die out completely. His hand’s already coming up to run through that annoying mop on his head.
He’s starting to think he might be more drunk than he thought.
“So…drinks then?”
“Honestly, Potter,” he sneers. “I agreed to join you on this case, because I thought you were an Auror. If I knew you had all the grace of a five-year-old, I would’ve left you in your office.”
Harry’s silent for a moment.
Draco stares at him in the silence that follows.
“Because you’re hiding it!” Harry stops pouring and replies indignantly. “What if I said or did something offensive? I can’t even remember, so how can I apologize?”
“Hmm?” the Auror says with one foot outside the massive front door.
Draco opens his mouth to argue, but Potter beats him to it.
“I mean, I walked in for tea, she took one look at me and smirked.”
The Auror is still facing away, but Draco doesn’t rush him, merely humming in acknowledgement.
“Potter,” he says instead of saying something inane about how he’s never noticed how green Potter’s eyes are.
There’s some screaming and swearing apparently, but thankfully far away from Harry.
He wants to move towards Potter and almost takes a half-step in his direction before he’s pulled back by a ringed hand clenched in his hair.
Draco glares, but he squeezes Potter’s hand.
Draco watches him toe off his boots and move towards him.
“Breaking and entering, Potter?”
“Draco,” his mother says reprovingly. “Mr. Potter says he’s here on personal business and has requested to speak with you.”
He debates for a few moments before finally leaving it the way it is.
So he’s not sure what Parkinson is doing here.
That’s the last straw for him.
“Malfoy, you always have hidden meanings. Your hidden meanings have hidden meanings.”
“-you didn’t answer my question,” he finishes.
Every so often, Draco can’t help it. He wonders what possessed Potter to say it.
Draco’s stomach churns.
“Hermione’s,” Harry replies, daring Malfoy to contradict him.
“Less talking, Mr. Malfoy, if you please. You’re the hostage, of course, but we don’t really want to injure you.”
He’s not blind. He knows how people looked at him before Potter spoke at the trial. But public impressions are different from private ones. Potter would have every right to criticize behind closed doors. There’s no rule saying you have to like a man to spare him from Azkaban. But the other man merely looks at the renovations and makes a bland comment about how the new windows have a lovely view.
After hours upon hours of tireless grilling, she finally leaves.
Harry leaves the stew Kreacher’s been simmering on the stove and walks the few steps to Malfoy.
He starts showing up at Potter’s office and dragging him out to lunch.
He sighs. He just wants one moderately boring week.
Harry looks at her and abruptly decides to wipe the smug look off her face. “Malfoy and I are together, Pansy.”
He shakes his head, unable to fight the smile breaking across his face and goes back to waving his wand over the stew.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco says and kisses him hard.
His heart’s pounding, and he can barely see someone racing towards him in the fog.
Harry snickers. “No need to sound so appalled, Professor.”
“Really?” Malfoy asks. “I was a prat. You’ve said so yourself.”
Someone crashes into him, hands fluttering everywhere.
“She’s your friend, too!” Malfoy retorts, but he sighs and procures a bottle of Dittany without too much fuss.
“Who knows, Pansy, maybe he’s lying about something else,” Blaise says. “Maybe it was the Threstral.”
“Tell me
“Was there any other way?” Draco asks finally.
He fiddles with something in his pocket for a moment before pulling it out.
“Well, you-“
Harry just looks at him.
Harry doesn’t want to know.
He sometimes thinks this absolute lack of relationship awareness is probably why he and Ginny never made it.
It starts to become something of a regular occurrence.
“What gave it away?” Malfoy asks dryly, because of course, Harry said that out loud.
He tries to convince himself it’s only because Potter is one of the few people in his entire life who’s never wanted or expected anything from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He braces himself for a smart comment from Potter as he leads them down the hall, but it never comes.
Draco pulls his sleeve enough to turn him around and raises his eyebrow when they make eye contact.
Draco looks at it for a moment before slowly accepting it. There’s that same warm sense of anticipation he felt in Ollivander’s all those years ago.
“I love you,” Potter says, cutting him off.
“Be nice, Pansy,” Zab- Blaise admonishes. “Leave the bloke alone. We’re here to get to know Draco’s friend. Not interrogate him.”
Hours and a location change later, Harry’s dozing off when he hears Malfoy mutter a quiet, but heartfelt, “Thank you.”
He’s so fucked.
“You know, you’ve actually loved me longer than I have you,” Harry says as he idly traces one of the long scars he left on Malfoy’s chest. “Why didn’t these change your mind?”
“Potter, meet…well, we’ve all gone to Hogwarts. I’m sure you know each other,” Pansy gives up mid-way through introductions. "Greg's in Romania actually. Very into dragons."
“No,” Malfoy replies, biting his lip. “That’s it. And I took you home.”
“Er-“
“I didn’t- Potter, I’m sorry. You used it on me, and I was in such a lousy place- I learned it so it could never be used on me again-“
Eventually, Ron smiles. “That’s what I thought. Just talk to him. I’ve wagered twenty galleons against Seamus that he likes you back. I’m pretty sure I’m right, but if I’m not, absolute worst case, he’ll just hate you forever.”
Harry doesn’t acknowledge the look, instead turning to compliment Blaise on his new diamond cufflinks. There’s only the usual polite smile that crosses the other man’s face, but Harry’s spent enough time around the man to know he’s pleased.
“Who cares about that?” Pansy interrupts. “Are you trying to say you’ve never been with a man before?”
Harry suddenly gets the feeling he did not think this through.
“I don’t know why I- Malfoy,” Potter says upon looking up. “…how much did you hear?”
“Malfoy, what the hell happened? What did I say to you?” he asks partly to distract himself and partly because he’s been friends with this man long enough to know that they’ll just keep beating around the bush otherwise.
There’s a moment when Potter looks at him like he’s seeing him for the first time.
He doesn’t know whether he should back out of the room quietly, but regardless, he’s too slow.
“Malfoy,” Potter finally says in a low voice.
Draco clears his throat. “….thank you, Potter. That was rather decent of you, all things considered.”
“It seems like we’re having a nice time,” he says cautiously.
“How did you know I was here? I haven’t visited my parents at the manor in years. They usually come to me.”
Draco looks at it for a second.
“I’ll think about it.”
“No,” he says glibly.
“About this?” Harry says, leaning against the table. “Yeah, I’d say so. I’ve been half in love with you since third year. Everyone knows that.”
Potter’s finally managed to find his feet, slicking his muddy hair back and idly wiping the muck off his glasses. He makes no attempt to salvage his clothes.
Harry cheerfully tells him that he passed on the greetings, and Hermione had been baffled, but pleased. She’d indicated that Theo could owl her whenever was convenient.
“When the bloody hell did you want me to sleep with him?” Harry asks in amazement. “We’ve been enemies for most of our-“
But Potter asks him questions about a new case and actually seems interested when Draco discusses some of the finer points of potion making.
Blaise and Theo occasionally owl as well.
He turns up his nose as Potter good-naturedly shrugs. “I’ll make do until we can make camp. Don’t worry your pretty little head over it, Malfoy. I won’t slow you down too much.”
Malfoy crawls out from whatever hidey hole he managed to find before Pansy arrived.
“Except someone conveniently forgot to tell me it went beyond a crush at Hogwarts!” Malfoy says shrilly.
Malfoy looks stunned that Pansy’s feet are in Harry’s lap.
“You can still speak Parseltongue?” he spits out in disbelief.
Draco sighs. “Nothing really. But also enough.”
“You want to know how long I’ve been friends with them, right?” Harry says, putting him out of his misery.
“Oh, Harry, I’m sure it’ll work out. You’re already practically dating. Just give him some time. Who knows what you said? It might’ve just thrown him off a bit.”
Today’s one of those days.
“Potter.”
The next day, after Draco has painstakingly used his left hand to brew, there’s a small bottle of Dittany on the counter with a hastily scrawled note pinned to it.
Ron and Hermione were constantly sniping at each other to the point where he’d told them rather bluntly that if they couldn’t find some way to avoid the late-night screaming matches, they’d have to move out of Grimmauld Place.
Draco waits calmly for a few more seconds until Potter crowds closer until their arms are touching. He doesn’t move, even when Potter finds his hand again and squeezes so hard, Draco’s certain it’ll bruise.
“Harry.”
“If you get off and breathe too hard—“
“Need you...Give it to me.”
He crawled into bed, solemnly, feeling Harry do the same next to him, on the opposite side. His eyelids felt like lead, but Harry’s words were rattling around in his brain. After a few minutes, he felt Harry wrap his warm arms around him.
“Why the fuck are you healing me?” His voice is livid and low, his face streaked with tears. Draco flinches back, not understanding why he’s so upset. He was just trying to ease the pain.
Harry snapped his fingers, and they were both completed naked.
After ten minutes of rolling on the floor together and massaging each other’s tongues together, Draco had to wonder no longer.
Harry turned his back to him and he thought, this is it. Harry was going to leave him. It had already become too much for him. He couldn’t handle Draco’s true self. He was not surprised. He had been hiding this part of himself, from him, all along. Not everyone could endure it, and that was fine. Good riddens, then.
“Yes, sir. Very dirty.” He grinned.
“Yea, swallow it all. Swallow every drop.”
“Hmm. This turns you on, pet. You have such a beautiful, thick cock.”
______________________________________________
“Not yet…this collar has to be earned. It’s a privilege. It makes you mine, in a different way. The power shifts to me and you become my responsibility. It may be months before that happens. In the meantime I have a whole collection of collars to choose from when we play.”
He didn’t trust himself at the moment. He couldn’t name his feelings but he felt a gravitational pull towards the marked man today. It felt dangerous.
Still, Draco knew that was never enough to curb Harry’s lust for him. He felt Harry pulling away from him and hardly knew what to do. His racing thoughts put him on edge. He felt like the anvil would drop on his head, any day now. Harry was getting ready to leave him. He felt it in his bones. In addition to denying him sex, Harry was completely acting out, intentionally being a terrible boyfriend in the hopes that it would lure Draco’s Dom to the surface.
“Harry is not himself. I’m very worried for him. He would kill me if he knew I was here, but I had to come. He doesn’t say much, but he’s different. I can tell...there’s something off. He’s heartbroken.”
Draco would have to tell him when he awoke, the following morning. He would drop him off to the beach cottage, afterwards, before going to work. It was always his favorite place.
Hot tears spill down Harry’s cheeks, but Draco just pulls him closer…and closer, so he’s choking. As Harry’s eyes leak, he blows him. He does it because he can’t not. This is why he has a mouth. This is what his body is made for.
He could no longer count how many times he had saved Harry’s life in the field, especially lately. The man was acting like he had a death wish.
He stepped in the floo with his bottle of firewhiskey, still in hand.
In a second, he swallowed Harry’s cock to the root, found Harry’s prostate with his finger and pushed it. Hard.
the man who treats me like vermin, any chance he gets. He's the only one that could hurt me like this, but still, you didn't care. Thinking with your cock, always. The guy is married and doesn’t give two fucks about you. He’s just using you as an experiment.”
Harry’s mouth tightens. “Don’t say that.”
“Harry.”
Harry immediately dug in, and Draco just stared at him.
What was the point of that? He had Draco for those sexual urges, and besides, no family could come from it.
“How does it feel? Hard enough for you?” He grunted.
Draco smiled and kissed his back. “Now you know how I feel.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry groans. And he cums all over the sheets beneath him, his cock untouched. His inner muscles clench around him and Draco feels white hot heat course through him as he shoots his load inside Harry with a quiet groan. Harry pulls away before he can even finish and Draco’s forced to stroke himself to completion, his cum landing sadly on the sheets below, instead of inside Harry.
“Did you fuck her?”
He sprinted to the bathroom on light feet and shut the door behind him as softly as possible before promptly sicking up in the toilet.
After breakfast, Draco and Scorpius spent the morning horseback riding. He was riding Prince while Scorpius chose his unicorn, as always. When they got to the edge of his property, they paused, looking down at the valley below.
Adjusting his collar, Draco tried to think of something to say to that but couldn’t.
Draco stood quickly and moved to open the door.
Harry grins, disbelievingly. “Haven’t you had enough?”
Finally, Harry let out a soft laugh. The sound thrilled Draco.
Harry hesitated to answer. Draco licked and kissed his neck to urge him on.
He had lost a best friend over this. A best friend turned enemy.
When he got out to wash his mouth in the sink, he muttered a
As they sat down to play, they chatted about everything, from family to work. Draco realized too late, that it was a probably a bad idea to share quality time like this. He found himself enjoying his non-sexual time with Harry, even more than their time in the bedroom. He loved to hear his soft laugh or to watch him blush, as he turned his head away shyly. His face lit up when he spoke of his children. It melted his insides.
Draco smiled and nodded at him. He did not notice he was tense or behaving in such a manor to reveal it, but perhaps, it was subconscious.
Blaise worked in the Department of mysteries and would often sneak up to Draco’s office to see him. He did not know whether it was a blessing or a curse that Draco was always so near him, yet so far away.
“Don’t act like you didn’t enjoy that. You were begging me to fuck you. I saw the look on your face afterwards. You always try to hide it, but I can see right through you.”
“I’m going to go back to the manor, to see Scorpius.”
Thirty minutes later, he felt a long tongue licking at his hole, from beneath the sheets. He moved the covers aside to see Harry below, licking and kissing his most intimate spot, with rapt concentration.
No, sir, I have no ego. I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were there.”
“What is the meaning of this? You broke into my house to steal a sleeping shirt?”
“…I’m so sorry about today, Draco. I’ll never say such things again. I love you. You know that, don’t you?”
Draco just stares at him like he has a screw loose.
“What would you have me say?” Draco asked in his soft drawl, “Do you want to hear how beautiful are? Do you want to hear about the way your skin is coloring for me? Or do you merely want my voice?” He struck again and again, harder, and just a little faster. “I want you to let go, pet. Just feel, don’t worry. I’m here.”
Draco couldn’t deny the appeal of that suggestion. His cock hardened to full-mast at Harry’s words, but he suspected Harry was just saying these things because of his recent mistake with Blaise. He was bone tired, in any case.
“Why? Did I do something wrong last night?”
Whatever the facts were, Draco still could not breathe or calm down. His whole face turned red with the effort of breathing.
“How can you say that? Why do you like to pretend that this means nothing to you? I’m not made of stone, Draco.”
Draco peeked around to see his face. He had to get close because it was so dark. His lips were clamped shut. He couldn’t see his eyes, but he could guess they were squeezed closed because his face was drawn tightly, like a man in suffering. His erection still had not flagged.
“But you’re eager...You’re my eager little whore. Aren’t you? Such a filthy whore. And all mine.”
“How was dinner with the children?” he asked, as way to cover up his evasive maneuver.
Draco wanted this case over with, as soon as humanly possible. He couldn’t stand Potter’s familiar magic filling up the small space. It felt thick in the air and threatened to suffocate him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Blaise. He’s not my boyfriend…He’s not my anything.”
and Harry broke the kiss to quickly unbutton Draco’s shirt, kissing each part of newly exposed skin. He could have simply vanished their clothing but he knew Harry loved disrobing him, by hand. He treated every part of Draco’s newly exposed naked body with tenderness. He tore his own shirt off, and pressed Draco flat against his silk green comforter, lying flush with his body, kissing him until Draco's head swam. Their naked chests touching, while kissing passionately, was a dizzying sensation for Draco. They were both hard already, and Draco could feel Harry’s erection rub against his through their pants.
He hung on his every word and chuckled at all his lame jokes. Draco often wondered if they took a piss in the loo together. He was always touching Harry any chance he got, and Harry never seemed to mind. It grated his nerves.
Draco tenses at the name, but forces himself to relax as he leans against the wall gingerly. “Listen, Potter, I’m not proud of what I’ve done, but it happened. No point dancing around the subject. He looked vaguely like me in a comparably horrible situation. And it made things harder.”
Malfoy gives him a dubious look.
Draco shuts the door and cradles the wand with some delicacy.
Harry just stares at the Slytherins.
Malfoy’s robes are half off, and he’s panting against the sheets. Blonde hair spills out of a hasty braid. He bites his lip, and Harry can’t help but lean in to kiss him again.
Potter is apparently satisfied there aren’t any more, and he’s back in front of Draco, searching for injuries amongst the blood. His movements become more frantic when Draco fails to respond.
He quickly turns around on his heel and marches back to the Floo.
Harry crosses his arms. “I’m telling you. They showed up and said they wanted to get to know your new friend better. So we’ve met up a couple times.”
“Of course,” Kingsley replies. “But between us-“
Harry runs a hand through his hair, making it even more messy than usual.
Of course it’s Potter. As if Draco could mistake that shaggy, black hair even before living with him.
Harry’s not sure what possesses him to get a portrait of Professor Snape commissioned. Well, he does have a reason, of course, but he feels like he’s signing himself up for a lifetime of snarky commentary and needling wit. The things he does for love.
“What was that?” Harry asks.
He relaxes into Potter’s embrace, breathing hard.
It’s a bit lonely without Malfoy around.
Potter is actually quite good at his job. And Draco has spent nearly half his life analyzing the Auror’s movements, so it’s not exactly hard to follow his silent commands.
The Slytherins leave eventually, and Harry tries not to dwell on what Pansy said.
“You can take out the ‘may,’ Malfoy. You definitely have permission to jump my-“
There’s an audible thud behind him as Kreacher struggles to fix a Christmas wreath to one of the doors on the third floor. It’s only October, but Kreacher is remarkably fastidious about holidays.
“Now, now, Mr. Malfoy,” the voice says, hissing a laugh. “None of that. We’ve been over this.”
“But it’s still your wand, so…here,” Potter says, holding the wand out in Draco’s direction.
The whole fiancé thing more or less falls by the wayside.
Draco shakes his head. “Yes, but Potter, I’m fabulous. Not everyone desires to be different.”
Draco knows they have plans to visit the eldest Weasel and his wife. One look at the thunderous expression on Potter’s face when he returns, and Draco quietly sends a polite owl to cancel.
Draco takes it, smirks at the messy “Sorry,” and finds a bowl to soothe his aching hand.
“Potter, I know you are…deficient in many ways, but surely, your memory has not failed you quite yet? Did you, or did you not, watch me die?” he says eventually.
She looks up at him as she throws her designer heels off. “We’re having tea,” she says, sounding like Harry’s asking the wrong questions.
Things were much simpler when Hermione belonged with Ron and Harry belonged with Ginny. Malfoy always said he’d gotten himself a fan and not a girlfriend. Ginny had outgrown him years ago. Still a good friend though.
Harry throws up his hands. “We’ve known each other for most of our lives and now, we’re supposedly together, but you can’t even call me by my first name? It’s the same number of syllables, Mal- fuck, I mean, Draco.”
Sitting there in a previously neat green sweater and black jeans with his pancakes laden with heavy maple syrup that Kreacher had dug out of some unspeakable place, Draco feels like he’s been smacked in the face.
He pretends to sigh long-sufferingly, but he takes Potter’s hand with only moderately concealed glee.
So he admits he might be going a bit over the top in a moderately (very) self-destructive effort to scare the Chosen One off.
He’s not going to make it though. He’s too far away.
Slowly, but surely, Draco’s spending more and more time with Potter.
Potter just laughs.
“Was it really necessary to Floo this early in the morning?” Malfoy asks the moment Harry sticks his head in the fire.
This continues for a few more days before Harry’s fed up.
Remarkably, Potter’s mouth actually does click shut.
Draco used his wand to cast locking and silencing charms.
had felt over Astoria, these many years. It was a sense of,
Their morning ritual felt familiar, like something they did together, ever day. Draco found himself comfortable with that fact. It didn’t bother him as much as he thought it would, and he walked Harry to the floo afterwards in an unconscionably good mood, parting with a soft kiss.
Draco used the metal rings to attach padded cuffs on Harry’s wrists and and ankles so he won’t be able to move. He knew Harry could break out of them wandlessly and nonverbally, but
“You’re doing this for Potter, aren’t you? You fucking bastard. I’ll never release you from that contract! You’ll have to kill me first.”
Draco noticed all the healers rush into his room and ran in. He thrust all the healers aside and got right in his face, putting his hand on his shoulders to push him down.
Harry removes his briefs because they’re soaked with tears…and because he can’t be near him without craving. Any time he’s rejected him, it’s like a double edged sword and only leaves him hard and aching. He guides his cock in his mouth. He feels a low groan vibrate through as his lips close around it. Draco shifts so his legs are spread more, welcoming the distraction. Then his hand comes down on Harry’s head. His fingers lace gently through his hair.
When Draco awoke the next morning, Harry was gone, but there was a small piece of parchment on the abandoned pillow next to him.
“Malfoy, I’ll have the reports in when I can. You know I’m not much for paperwork,” he grinned with chagrin. That stupid handsome grin, Draco wanted to smack it off his face, wanted to punch his teeth in.
“You can’t be serious!
Blaise was horrified. His stunt with Jacob was having the opposite effect than what he intended. His worst fear was being realized. He had pushed Draco away with his heavy proclamations. What was he thinking, telling him he loved him, demanding that he leave his wife for him? He had felt emboldened with his coming out. He wanted to scream every truth he held inside from the highest mountain top, for all to hear.
The only difference is now they’re actually friends.
Harry sometimes wishes Voldemort was still trying to kill him. Life was easier back then, he laments.
He knows it’s not the best expression of gratitude he’s ever given, but it’s all he’s got right now.
“Wait, Malfoy-“ Harry tries as Malfoy summarily ends the Floo call.
“He looked a bit like you when-.”
Potter just gives him a withering look when he brings it up, but Draco is just calling it as he sees it. There was quite honestly no good reason to lie. So either Potter’s secretly fantasizing about being Mr. Potter-Malfoy, or- Draco honestly can’t think of another explanation.
“Fair enough,” he replies eventually. “Just promise me we’ll talk about this at some point?”
Completely ridiculous.
Malfoy looks faintly horrified. “What do you mean she knows?”
“You said you wanted me to fuck you,” Malfoy eventually says, careful not to make eye contact.
He then promptly passes out.
“-you can take your bloody opinions on my love life and back the hell up,” Draco hears.
He’s not sure, but he thinks he sees Malfoy smile slightly.
Potter asks him if he had a funny dream when he wanders around in a daze that morning.
Potter’s looking away now as his jaw tightens. “Yeah.”
He’s busy kissing down Malfoy’s collarbone, but he pauses briefly before moving lower.
Pansy just looks at him.
Malfoy pauses before taking a sip of tea and stares at Harry like he’s a particularly interesting potions specimen over the rim of his teacup.
at him like they’re simple acquaintances and sashays away before he can catch up.
“That’s it?” Harry interrupts. “Nothing else?”
Pansy somehow becomes a fixture in his life. She’s not always in the country, but she keeps a steady stream of owls to Harry.
“You trust her, but you don’t trust me?” Harry responds, crossing his arms in mock offense.
“What did you…never mind,” he says abruptly.
“This is why you’re my favorite,” Harry says after swallowing a mouthful of pastry.
Harry blinks before smirking. He sidles a bit closer.
He can tell Potter looks like he wants to pull away now, but instead he swallows and stays still.
Draco eventually approaches Potter steadily, escorting him further into the home. He carefully tugs the Auror robes off and casts
“Listen,” Potter begins. “I’m sorry it took this long to get this back to you. It’s going to sound kind of ridiculous, but this is one of the few things I had after the Battle that didn’t end up broken or useless, so I kind of held onto it longer than I meant to, because it was one of the few things that didn’t leave.”
He dreams about rings and Pansy proposing to Blaise.
Harry glances up at him briefly. His bleary eyes land on immaculate robes, long blonde hair, and polished shoes. He’s suddenly feeling very thirsty and he steals Malfoy’s glass of water.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now that he thinks about it, Malfoy’s always been around in some shape or form since he was eleven.
“I think I like you, Potter.”
“How are you both this blind?” she laments and drains her cup.
“That prat,” he says fondly before changing and heading to work.
So much for staying out of it, he thinks. He’d only lasted one day before being kidnapped rather close to the Ministry. They’d quickly Portkeyed to a rather deserted field.
And then they told him they’d broken up.
Draco should be disgusted at the smattering of maple syrup that dribbles from the dangling fork to the front of Potter’s hideous Christmas sweater. Potter’s not even looking at him. He’s got his tongue between his teeth as he cautiously plates a hefty stack of well-earned pancakes for Kreacher.
“Knut for your thoughts?” Potter says a while later after just sitting and holding hands. Draco slowly traces Potter’s warm hand, fingers brushing against the numerous calluses and nicks from a lifetime of Quidditch.
“I just haven’t, alright?” Harry says, starting to feel defensive. “It’s not like I’m less-“
“No, no,” she says, waving a hand. “This has nothing to do with your orientation. I’m saying you’ve never slept with Draco? Ever? Not even once?”
“Potter, are you dabbling in necromancy now?”
Kreacher returns just as Draco is reaching for him, leaving a tasteful selection of foods nearby, and disappearing shortly after Draco nods his thanks.
"Where's Goyle?" he adds inanely.
He downs the accompanying vial helpfully labeled “Hangover cures for prats” and scans the note.
“And secondly, I don’t have to catch up, because they’re right up through there,” he continues, his voice dropping down into a whisper.
“Nothing,” Harry repeats in disbelief. “Nothing, my arse.”
“Sounds like they kind of do,” Draco tries to say jokingly, but it falls flat.
Pansy smirks. “You know, when we first had tea, you seemed so boring. But now, now you’re just a little bit feisty, Potter.”
“-the info’s good,” Harry finishes.
Harry huffs. “I’ll leave you two to catch up.”
Harry doesn’t know when he becomes friends with Parkinson.
Luckily, Harry’s spent seven years stalking him.
Harry chokes.
Harry really wishes the effortless display of wandless magic was less attractive.
“Yes,” Malfoy sniffs. “I was under the impression they were
Pansy stares at him like he's something disgusting on the bottom of her shoe.
His old Potions professor sneers. “Potter, surely I had enough of this place when I was alive. Must you condemn even a shadow of my former self to haunt these halls as well?”
It apparently happens somewhere after becoming friends with Malfoy and sometime after running into her at Malfoy’s office in the Ministry.
He’s gnashing his teeth when he receives the following short reply.
“-I just- it just happened. I tried to reason with him. He looked really nervous, but he just kept sending curses at us. I tried to aim as best I could, but it was really dark, and I just-“ Potter says, the words pouring out. “I hit him in the chest. And now he’s in a magically-induced coma. They say he’ll be fine, but he looks so young compared to some of the other Death Eaters. Who knows-“
from behind him as he throws Potter aside. And without thinking, he uses
When he’s looking for an excuse to get takeout, Malfoy’s already dusting himself off from the Floo, loudly proclaiming that they’re ordering Thai food. When Harry has to dress up for formal occasions, Malfoy’s there, quietly clicking his tongue until he finds the proper robes. When Harry’s leaving work, Malfoy’s already draped himself in a plush armchair in Grimmauld Place with Kreacher bringing him tea and biscuits.
Draco’s mouth quirks with suppressed laughter. Evidently, Potter felt like making someone else kneel through the Floo today.
“Happy Christmas,” he says, pulling the Cloak off of the scowling former Headmaster.
Potter’s silent again.
But the moment ends, and he’s left with Potter in front of him looking almost taken aback.
“Whatever for?” the former professor replies scornfully. “Have I not made it clear I detest you, Potter?”
I'm just really enjoying writing stuff for these two. I haven't even hit half the scenes I meant to. Hopefully, I'll get there soon. Hope you enjoy!
After several minutes, Draco pulls away, smiling slightly when Potter chases the feeling briefly.
“-then there you go, Potter.”
Potter eventually comes back from the Ministry to see Draco lying there bonelessly in the living room. For all that they’ve bickered throughout the years, Potter is unusually silent. He slowly removes the Auror robes and drapes them on their hook.
“Saint bloody Potter,” he says finally, pushing Harry’s reports over enough to bend him over the desk.
“Think whatever you want, Potter. No matter what I say, I can tell you’re already convinced that I had some hidden meaning.”
He’s keeping busy. Cleaning up Death Eaters even ten years later. The usual.
Stepping over the man, he thinks he might have overdone it a bit.
Harry slides down in his chair.
He’s complaining about it to Ron the next day over lunch. They’re pointedly staying far away from the Hermione topic, so Harry’s decided to regale him with the latest in the Malfoy saga.
“That’s fair then,” Malfoy says with no hesitation. “I trust Granger’s judgment.”
And he doesn’t expect this fragile friendship with Potter to last. After all, the only relationships he’s managed to maintain over the years have been with the Slytherins who’ve known him for so long they don’t have a choice in liking him.
Draco doesn’t really know what to say to that, so he huffs and carefully makes his way forward into the gloomy jungle.
Malfoy begrudgingly appreciates it. Not.
Theo nods at him.
He’s clearly called the same person back, because he walks through without so much as a by-your-leave.
invited you for drinks even though we hadn’t spoken in years and you were convinced I hated you. I’ve consistently gotten you birthday and holiday presents that are far too elaborate for simple coworkers. I hang out with you more than Ron and Hermione for crying out loud. I regularly have tea with Blaise, Pansy, and Theo now, thanks to you. And I get distracted by your voice or your hair or your hands or your arse on a daily basis,” Harry replies in exasperation. “But
“Thanks, I think,” Harry says, resolving to stop thinking so hard.
He almost wants to retract the friend thing now. Maybe they're still enemies, he thinks wildly. But Malfoy's legitimately very busy, and the note's innocuous enough. So Harry bites his tongue and replies with some nonsense about how that’s totally fine and to have a safe trip.
Potter looks at one of the men on the ground, squinting hard at the curse used. He closes his eyes.
He turns to sift through the tray of food, but Potter’s hand snatches at his sleeve.
“Shut up, Malfoy. You just scuttled off somewhere and watched. If I didn’t tell her, she’d find out from someone else, and then we’d truly never hear the end of it.”
Draco braced himself on the back of the couch, bending over more, as Harry thrust inside him. Harry leaned over with him, refusing to let their skin part. He began thrusting into him slowly, but deeply, muttering the whole time,
His eyebrows were furrowed with worry, as if from true concern.
Draco moved forward to pluck the coffee from his hands and place it on his desk. Forgetting his no-fraternizing policy at work, he kissed him softly and embraced him, before stepping back.
What he lacked in experience, he made up for in enthusiasm. He caressed his balls while he sucked shallowly on Draco’s cock, almost half way, using his tongue to lap at the underside and around the tip.
He was fully dressed as he looked down at Blaise, naked but for the pajama bottoms sagging sadly around his ankles. He was still bound, gagged, and bent over, his ass stained red.
“Oh! Master, please” Harry sobbed, boneless against the bench, but he still staunchly and stubbornly chose not to use his safe words.
More days pass. For the first time in a while, Draco wishes he could talk to his mom. He tries to keeps busy, spending most nights riding his horses until his body is sore. As he lies in bed at night, he’s forced to admit there’s something wrong with him.
“Perfect. I’ll be treating you to the kangaroo flogger today. Lighter than leather and deer hide. One of my favorites. Nice high impact with a good sting, but not much chance of marks. No healing magic when the collar is on, pet, so remember your safe words.”
Finally arriving home, Harry went straight into his office to conduct his daily ritual of jerking off in the pensive memory. It started after his conversation with Blaise in the atrium, a few weeks back. He knew it was sick, but it always made him feel better.
“Sure you do.”
Draco did as he was bid and sat at that table, burning with the shame of his words. Harry stared at him, trying to reign in a smile. He was wiping his eyes because his laughter had brought him to tears. For cripe’s sake, it wasn’t that funny.
Draco tries to answer him. That’s how he ends up choking on a mouthful of his own blood. Harry pushes his hand back into his hair, draws it back because it’s warm and sticky. A wave of helpless fury fills him as he turns back to see who the perpetrator was—so much so that he doesn’t look back down until Draco’s eyes are closing.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Draco said in a small voice.
Harry clawed at his body desperately. It was as if he was trying to get underneath his very skin. He rubbed his hands all over Draco’s chest, to his back behind his robe, alternating between caressing and grabbing. He removed the robe and pushed Draco back roughly on the bed before tearing off his own shirt and crawling on top on him.
“Please, sir. You have every right to expect me use my safe words. Give me another chance.”
“I’m putting in a request to transfer to the DMLE in Paris.”
Astoria started to finger the pillow next to her, guiltily.
He considered faking sick to skive off dinner with Harry. He didn’t know why he had agreed to it the first place. It was before they went to the beach, but now this whole thing was beginning to feel like a lover’s vacation, and Draco didn’t like it. He just wanted to go home.
“I’ll see you around Drake,” Blaise said without meeting his eyes.
“I want you to accept this as a token of my…affections. It has many protective enchantments on it and has been in the Malfoy family for hundreds of years. It would make me feel better, knowing your safe. The clasp only opens at my touch. If you accept it, you will have to wear it, until I decide to take it off…I don’t see that happening in the near future.”
He plunged into his mouth relentlessly. Though Draco was experienced at deep-throating, it only worked when he was able to control the pace. Blaise’s pace was erratic, and he shoved into his mouth without mercy.
“What the fuck are you doing here, Blaise?” so much for a cool head.
hopped on top of him, pressing his glove to the side of his perfect porcelain face, forcing Draco's cheek to the dirty ground.
He started fucking him hard straight away, without mercy. He needed fuck these ridiculous notions out of his head. He recalled what Blaise said about not being able to get it up because he was pining for Harry.
Draco sat tall on the white horse with perfect riding posture, wearing Tuffrider sand colored breeches with a breathable fabric, a tight black short sleeved polo shirt and a black belt. He had foregone his robes tonight. His black riding boots came up to the knee and crunched the gravel beneath him as he dismounted, a mask of indifference planted firmly on his face.
Fuck you, Malfoy,” and he began walking towards the door in angry strides.
“Again, Harry? You’re insatiable.”
“Pansy’s great. She can be a little needy, like every spoiled pureblood girl, but nothing I can’t handle. I definitely go shopping more. I can tell you that.”
“But…the kids are over. You always refuse if the kids sleep over,” Harry says.
Draco slapped his ass once more, this time hard enough for Blaise to fly forward
He studied his hand as he pulled it forward and turned it over, forcing his sleeve up more.
the bloody baron. A ghost who wandered this life with heavy clanking chains, connected to no one.
Harry’s cheeks pinked.
That evening, as Draco showered, Harry lit the bedroom with soft candlelight, after disrobing. He took massage oil from the drawer and placed it on top of the nightstand. When Draco came out, he smiled at the warm sight. Harry’s naked body on display, with his broad shoulders, huge cock, bulging muscles, and piercing green eyes, always made him swoon. This was love, he thought. This was so much better than anything that could be found in a dinky dungeon.
“No,” he lied.
“I’ve missed you,” Draco stroked his arm softly, but it was just a whisper of a stroke, barely a graze. Blaise unconsciously leaned into it.
Fuck. Draco was truly screwed now. Harry could blackmail him into anything.
He’s white-knuckling the door, looking like an apparition with his pale face and his sharp-edged physique. Just one glance, and Draco can see he’s shaking. He steps under the shower’s spray with him. Draco barely gets his arms around him him before his knees buckle.
“Eyes down. Always. Yes, even when you’re behind me. I shall know.”
Blaise nodded and began to retreat, but not before Harry gave Draco a hateful look and started speaking in his loud, auror voice.
“Harry. He took a bullet for me yesterday. I can’t betray him.”
It was late enough for him to dress in his silk, black pajama bottoms and a matching top robe. Harry was a guest but he wasn’t naive enough to be ignorant of what would happen tonight. He may as well dress for bed. He decided against underwear. They were going to be removed anyway. He liked the feeling of the cool silk on his cock.
“I see. I don’t know if I believe that, but I do know that I’ve missed you. I miss my best friend. Not having you at the proposal party felt awful and wrong. You were the only one I really wanted to celebrate with and you weren’t there. We’ve talked about this, since we were boys.”
When he closed the door behind him, he heard it lock and sensed the blanket of sound proofing that came from the silencing charm when it was cast in a room. Potter hadn’t moved a muscle or uttered a single world. He managed to cast both charms wandlessly
“No. How lovely. Blaise, may I speak with you in private?”
“Don’t do that!”
By the time it hit five o’ clock, Draco thanked all the gods that this horrific day from hell was over. A paper airplane memo flew in onto his desk. It was from Harry requesting to come over after work. Draco replied in the affirmative. If he was going to pay the very public price of being Harry’s lover, he may as well reap the benefits.
He began scanning the paper, looking for clues, but that was a bad idea.
Put your arms around me, stubborn arse.”
“You’re welcome, Master Draco.”
“Get off me Malfoy.”
Except he isn’t.
Harry nodded and gave Draco a tight, uncomfortable smile.
“Harry, look at me.”
Harry snuggled against his side, purring softly, and put a hand over his chest. Draco put his hand on top of his, and they both fell into a sated sleep.
Draco’s body flushed with anger. The scene was too reminiscent of true play. How dare a sub speak to him this way? He tightened his hold and twisted his arm, nearly to the point of breaking. Harry let out a panicked shriek.
“Do you watch me like that, too?”
“Listen, Draco, I know it was harsh, but it needed to be done. You were never going to tell him about me. If he knows you’re involved with someone, then he can move on too. I did you a favor.”
Draco started panicking.
There’s a fruit bowl on the counter. It catches his eye because there are gnats above it.
Harry moaned, despite not being in the mood. Draco’s cock-sucking skills were unparalleled. Harry hardened to fullness within seconds and it was no small organ. He was far bigger than most men, but Draco engulfed his cock to the hilt, without gagging once, and swallowed.
“I know you’re not gay. I never catch you looking at blokes, but I constantly catch you looking at birds.”
Harry waits anxiously and excitedly, hopping on foot to foot. Five minutes later, Draco reemerges.
Inside the office, however, it was a different show, entirely.
Blaise looked up at Draco for a moment, pupils blown, their eyes locked in a heated gaze. He reached up to grab Draco’s arm with the hand that was not occupied on his cock. Draco lowered his hand at his bequest and Blaise placed it on the back of his head, silently begging, mouth full of cock,
Harry’s jaw drops at that one. “I would never!”
“Sure…I’m going to look at rings with her next month. She’s really excited.”
The blonde bloke stood up. His hair was not as blonde as Draco’s but rather a warm honey. He stood taller than Draco at 6’4. He was massive but trim. Draco hated him immediately.
“Draco?”
He wasn’t planning on fucking Harry again. This was just a one-off, a drunken mistake, never to be repeated, as far as Draco was concerned.
Draco takes pity on the man and stops his assault, and Harry sags in relief. Standing up to pet his hair, Draco lubes his own hard leaking cock, squeezing the base painfully to bring himself under control. The sound of Harry’s moaning, begging, and submission is almost enough to make him blow. He has a cock ring on, but it’s not enough.
“Of course not, Draco. They’re just...not used to us yet. It’s going to take a little more time.”
“Neech is honored serve the ancient, noble house of Malfoy. Master Draco is the bestest, most kindest master any elf is having.”
In the end, that’s why he can’t go yet. It’s fucked up but Draco is a fuckup for him. If he’s ever going to leave London, he needs to see if he’s okay. But he's leaving for Paris tonight, regardless. He just wants to be sure he has someone to share his shy smiles with. Realizing that makes him feel like he might cry.
“I do want you...sexually.”
The kids get along beautifully, and they already function as a family together. Draco kisses him again.
“Besides, did you forget that you’re the Savior of the Wizarding world and I’m an ex-death eater?” Harry finally looked up as he pulled up his sleeve to show him the dark mark. It was faded but still stark against the white background. It stood ugly and raised, the only blemish on his porcelain skin.
“Blaise, don’t be coy. How great are we talking?”
“Your head is in the clouds. You alright?”
When lunch time came, he walked down to the atrium to meet Blaise, as he often did. While they were standing in line to buy food, Blaise casually brushed the back of his hand against Draco’s. It was subtle enough that no one noticed, but Draco felt it and allowed a soft smile, that only Blaise could see.
“Yes, sir,” he sighed, “I think I understand.”
Draco chortled and looked away with a devil-may-care attitude. Harry was always so confident about his sexual abilities. It rankled to know he was an absolute god in bed.
Draco moves onto the bed, lies on his back and holds his arm open. “Come besides me.
After ten seconds, Harry starts profusely sweating. Weasley notices and Harry practically jumps out of his chair, excusing himself to the bathroom. Draco waits to be sure he’s there and then kicks up the vibration to full intensity for a full minute.
He lifts his head, his glazed eyes reaching for Draco’s. He presses his lips together, bringing both of his dimples out. “I love you.”
Harry wondered how they knew him so well. He must have frequented this club a lot when he was married to Astoria. He had mentioned on their trip that he was good friends with owner, George Wolfe. Harry couldn’t possibly fathom the strange connections of the very wealthy.
“And why is that, Potter? If this is over your stupid jealousy with Blaise, you’re in for a rude awakening.”
Draco could absolutely not have sex with Blaise tonight. He was already on shaky ground with the man, and having sex with him again would make things worse. Draco couldn’t remember why, with Blaise’s scent so close, but he knew it would. Besides, he had just had sex with Harry at noon that very same day. Harry would be livid if he found out. He went from having sex with one man his whole life, to feeling like a strumpet, overnight. Maybe, he really did, only think with his cock.
“He loves you, huh. After a hot few months? Potter wouldn’t know the first thing about loving you. He might love the way he feels with you, but he doesn’t love the real you. He doesn’t even know you, not like I do…”
‘Are you sure you’re a Malfoy? This is not how a Malfoy behaves.’
He was doomed.
The table was set for two already. A single long stem candle was burning in the middle of the table.
Draco would be completely lost without her. She deserved every gift and more, considering…
this man was going to be the death of him. His ass felt amazing in his hands. The muscle was firm but still moulded to his palms. He could not deny a gift so willingly offered.
“Stop calling me that.” Then, with a whisper, “There’s no winning with you, is there?”
Blaise’s face breaks out into a full, beautiful smile. He’s all perfect, white teeth and shining eyes.
His breathy voice shot straight to Draco’s cock and was enough to make him shoot streaks of cum on the sheets in front of him, clenching around Harry’s cock tightly.
Then again, Draco had never been open with Astoria about his sexual proclivities, either. Yet, he was certain she had known about them all along. His situation was different. It’s not as if he were seeking other women for comfort. Astoria would always be the number one woman in his life. Draco surmised that she knew that, which is why she never questioned him about it.
Draco arrived at Malfoy Manor Saturday afternoon, boneless and spent. No one was there to greet him, but he was fine with that. He didn’t have the energy to deal with anyone. He could barely lift his pinky finger, let alone tug his suitcase up the stairs. He immediately disapparated from the foyer to his bedroom and collapsed on the bed.
“Harry, you were under the affects of a poison. It wasn’t your fault. I did worse, the night before. What about that? I didn’t have a poison in my veins to excuse my actions.”
He tied his robe tightly and headed to the main parlor where the fireplace was. Harry was going over a case on the couch. When he caught sight of Draco, he set the case file aside and took off his glasses.
It went on a long time. When he finally pulled away, Draco could hardly catch his breath.
Draco considered him for a moment, shocked he was even asking. Blaise had never dared even approach him, since his betrayal.
“If you feel like it.”
“Ten minutes,” he replied. Scorpius grasped Draco around the middle in delight for a few seconds and then skipped towards the blanket that Albus directed him to. Harry watched this interaction with rapt interest.
Harry followed his eyes and coughed, trying to distract Draco from the truth. He quickly rose away from Draco, ashamed but meeting his gaze defiantly, daring him to say one word.
“This could be the honeymoon?” Harry asks.
It was a textbook submissive pose. Draco was shocked that Harry seemed to know exactly what he was doing and wondered if the man had any prior experience. He doubted it.
Draco just nodded in return, covering his eyes.
Draco didn’t answer.
They lay like that for about ten minutes or so while Harry caught his breath. He, then, turned on his side to face him.
Neech’s eyes filled with tears.
Harry’s heart flutters so forcefully that he has to look away from a moment. He scans the crowd and sees that many park-goers are staring at them disapprovingly, but if Draco doesn’t mind, then Harry doesn’t either.
Harry sighs. “I needed time to think. It was my fault. I was all in my head...I let that bloody contract take over my life. I was being stupid, not myself. That’s all over with now. I promise to never behave that way again, even if the contract holds forever. I love you, and I’ll take anything you have to offer. Please….don’t go to Paris.”
Draco startled and release him, stepping away quickly.
He was even more angry at himself. He should just be happy for Blaise, ecstatic even. His best friend was finally getting married. Yet, he could not find a single ounce of happiness for him in his heart, no matter how hard he looked, and he did not know why.
“I’m afraid so. I’m not mad about it. I always wanted to be photographed in this leather jacket.”
hearing how desperate you are for my cock is enough to make me cum, right now.”
He’s already arranged to meet him and insisted on private time between the two of them, so Blaise sends Pansy on a spa vacation for the weekend, insisting she take his house elf to wait on her. His eyes practically glow when Draco asks for “private time.” It was their secret code.
Harry was watching him the whole time, smiling. When Draco caught his eye, he asked,
“Love you,” he whispered. Then he came, burying his face into Draco’s neck.
“You’re quiet. I always get worried when your quiet. What’s going on in that head of yours? I could never tell.”
Blaise chuckled.
“But, sir…I’ve been a bad boy, remember?”
He chanced a quick look down, past his moppy black head and saw that Harry was stroking his own cock as he sucked him. His other hand was stroking the base of Draco’s cock to make up for what he couldn’t put in his mouth.
Harry tightened his chokehold around Draco, who could hardly breathe, as yet, another orgasm tore out of him. He groaned above him and bit another spot on Draco’s neck, hard enough to draw blood, again.
He wipes his face off on the towel. He dresses in his van’s, black jeans, and a black t-shirt.
Harry had been getting berated all day. People were screaming at him and hounding him with questions, yet his first worry was about Draco? He didn’t expect this. His heart softened. All thoughts of ending this left his mind.
“Please, sir, leave that on,” he begged.
and he felt hot cum flood the inside of his hole.
When he gets out, Hermione is visiting. She tries talking to Harry, but his eyes are locked on Draco like he’s trying to communicate with his mind and wants Draco to do legillimency on him. After she’s gone, they’re alone in the room again. Harry holds out his hand for Draco’s, and when he takes it, his eyes shut. He inhales deeply…exhales slowly. His hand grips Draco’s.
Harry’s head was turning left and right, a look of rapture on his face, as he tried, desperately, to stave off his orgasm. His proclamation coupled with the view, triggered Draco’s own orgasm and white cum shot out of his cock to land on Harry’s belly. It was always a heady thing to watch Harry surrender to Draco, out of pure lust, despite his best efforts.
Hermione, on the other hand, is sympathetic.
Draco beats him to it.
It’s quite gratifying to see the look on Potter’s face.
He whistles offkey as he leaves the grumbling portrait.
Later, after the professor has long since fled, Malfoy corners him. “I don’t know how or where you found him, and quite frankly, Potter, I don’t care.”
“Nothing,” Malfoy says, but the corner of his mouth is curling upwards.
The capturing and arresting actually goes remarkably smoothly, Draco admits reluctantly to himself.
He pauses, and then shakes his head. “That’s not a fair question. I mean, you’ve done it.”
Potter’s still facing away from him, clenching and unclenching a hand.
He can’t just get away with that, Draco thinks darkly.
“Seems like you’re still a prat though,” he manages to say through the slowly spinning room. “Well- well, it’s your loss, Malfoy. I had big plans for you to fuck me tonight.”
Harry sees the sliver of pale, exposed chest and the briefest glimpse of a thick, raised scar. He gulps.
He has to admit, he didn’t expect Ron and Hermione to be such an issue. Sure, they didn’t always get along, but Harry assumed that the constant stress of Voldemort and dying and the war and him probably exacerbated whatever actual tension they had. So he figured that once they had a couple years to get settled, everything would even out more or less.
He turns to Draco.
Harry’s not sure when exactly Malfoy slithered into his life and took up shop, but he’s become rather partial to the Potions Master’s tendency to show up right when Harry wants him around.
It goes fairly well for a few months, before Draco finally has enough.
The snake curls closer to Potter’s hand, and the Auror hisses reassuringly.
It’s a bit charming.
Malfoy studies him for a moment. “Why do you want to know so badly?”
The day is muggy and warm. Mosquitos lazily flit about near the still, murky water.
Malfoy rushes to speak. “I would never-“
Potter squirms for a second, but quickly, he starts leaning into it as Draco continues to massage into his neck.
He doesn’t see Potter for the better part of a month after that though, so he supposes it doesn’t matter. It’s probably better that he doesn’t see the bloke. He was starting to develop a sense of grudging respect for his erstwhile nemesis, and that’s just simply not acceptable.
Harry’s hands are moving on their own, maneuvering Malfoy up against the now closed door. He’s attempting to separate the robes from the Potions Master. There’s a moment of hesitation when the other man kisses back in surprise, but soon after two pale hands gently pull his own away.
“Potter,” Pansy says, snapping her fingers to get his attention. “Are you even listening to me?”
Draco waves him off. “I might be horrible on occasion, but even I wouldn’t subject someone to this.”
There’s a painful smack to the side of his head.
The person on the other end, whose face is now unfortunately obscured behind Potter, eventually acquiesces enough for the other to finally let them go.
Potter sighs. “Maybe not. But everything moved so quickly, and it felt like I was standing under the Cloak again, watching you and Dumbledore- sorry.”
“Yes?”
“Potter, shut up.”
Potter accepts the seat and thankfully doesn’t waste his time.
“You mean to present me to him as a Christmas present?”
This is, of course, after they painstakingly and thoroughly clean the desk. They’ve both agreed that even the thought of hearing Kreacher mutter about “the masters defiling the desk” and “poor Kreacher must clean it” would haunt them to the end of their days.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kreacher pops in, takes one look at Potter, and leaves just as quickly.
An hour later, because Malfoy insisted on staying long enough to get their money’s worth, they’ve arrived back at Harry’s.
There’s a few more cases together over the years where Potter continues to earn Draco’s respect. He’s kind with victims, cooperative with all manner of staff and consultants, and consistently values other people’s opinions.
Potter runs a hand through the bird’s nest he attempts to pass off as hair, and Draco is momentarily distracted by his innate need to insult everything about the man.
He’s spent several lovely evenings with them before Malfoy is finally able to join them.
“Where?”
Kingsley Shacklebolt ignores the Patronus speaking in Draco Malfoy’s voice. He has no interest in why his two best personnel both need a sick day on Friday. If he were remotely interested, which he isn’t, he would say, “about bloody time.”
Potter’s returned, dragging someone else back through, just enough so their curly hair pokes out among the flames.
Draco isn’t sure what exactly looks lovely to him. Was it the new chandelier to replace the one they destroyed? Or the renovations to hide the spot in which his insane aunt tortured Granger? Or perhaps, it was the new tapestries covering the many Malfoy portraits commissioned over the years.
They’d chosen to leave in the end. Privately, Harry was grateful. He was finally able to sleep through the night. Things had picked up at work, so other than a handful of Floo calls and postponed dinner invites, Harry hadn’t seen either of them for a few weeks.
Malfoy is staring at him.
“It wasn’t all drivel,” he says offhand, still thinking about Malfoy’s unwitting relationship advice.
“Not that I’m not into it, but you’re very drunk,” Malfoy tells him, not unkindly, after he’s plied Harry with water and practically tucked him into bed. “I’ve left a Hangover potion for tomorrow morning. I’ll see you around, Potter.”
He’s annoyed enough that he mistakenly signs his name as Harry and has to snatch the parchment back from the owl.
“Potter,” Draco responds.
Malfoy hisses in frustration and steps towards him.
Kingsley nods. “Very well then.”
Eventually, he raises an eyebrow inquiringly. “Cat got your tongue?”
Sometimes Harry forgets that as the Head Auror, there’s no such thing as a quiet week. But that’s different. He enjoys the work. Even though he’s more on the administrative side of things than before, he’s still involved in more of the legwork than people expect.
Malfoy’s a slippery bloke.
“Don’t you ‘er’ me, Potter!” Draco says indignantly.
His hands fumble around for his glasses, and he shoves them on. In the dim light of his bedroom, he sees a note addressed to Scarhead in the same precise handwriting he’s seen in some form or another for most of his life.
Theo eventually leans around Malfoy to ask if Potter’s had a chance to contact Hermione about her research.
Surprisingly, Ron and Hermione are on much better terms now that they’re friends.
“No, she did not,” Harry fills in awkwardly, when Pansy just hums and looks elsewhere in apparent boredom.
“Just…lighter hair, kind of ferret-like, a bit desperate,” Potter continues, and chuckles a bit weakly.
He wants one nice week where the junior Aurors stop blowing shit up and Ron minds his manners with Hermione and Kreacher-
When they eventually leave, Malfoy hovers in the doorway for a moment.
Eventually, weeks go by with Potter fighting the media and becoming increasingly secretive. Draco doesn’t question it. There are times to be dramatic and bother answers out of the man, and there are times where it’s best to just leave him to his devices.
“Just- let’s not talk about this now,” Draco interrupts quietly.
How dare he go and be
“That’s fair,” Malfoy replies thoughtfully. “I have to go, Potter. I can’t keep bantering with you all day.”
Malfoy gives him a reproving look, but doesn’t say anything.
She’s too busy to join him for lunch this week, but Hermione’s made time to listen to him anyway. Harry makes a silent promise to drag her to a bookstore in the near future and let her pick out as many books as she wants.
“Well, Potter?” Pansy prompts a second later. “What is it?”
“What do you mean you haven’t?” Pansy says scornfully. “What kind of lie is that, Potter? We said two truths and a lie. Not three increasingly unbelievable lies.”
It’s very them. The first time Potter properly says it, and Draco’s covered in someone else’s blood.
Draco almost wants to laugh.
Draco’s positive that even a few hours ago, he would’ve immediately Flooed to Pansy’s to rant about inconsiderate and malevolent stalkerish Potters poking their noses into perfectly innocent people’s business. Now though, he’s in a good mood, and he just huffs a laugh.
Despite his best efforts, Harry can’t seem to find Malfoy. He’s tried stopping by his office in the Ministry, Hogwarts, and the apothecary he frequents in Knockturn Alley.
“Oh, I don’t like you either,” Harry chuckles. “But Malfoy does. And it is the holiday season after all.”
“Thank you,” he finally manages.
They are enemies after all.
the dense one?” Malfoy responds, eyebrows shooting up.
“Potter, what are we doing?” he asks after one evening where idle musings about a case have devolved into Potter’s rendition of some absurd story about the Weasel twins and throwing snowballs at the Dark Lord.
“Very good, Potter,” Parkinson replies, clearly not paying any attention. “And enough with the Parkinson. Pansy is fine. There’s no need for you to stand on ceremony. After all, I did try to turn you over to the Dark Lord.”
“It was the only thing that came to mind to handle it,” he says, focusing on the rain flattening the other man’s hair and not on the slight roiling of his stomach.
There’s batter on Potter’s face and some stray flour dusting his hair, remnants of losing his fight with Kreacher over the whisk.
“Doesn’t mean I was right,” Harry says dazedly. He’s not quite sure how much he had to drink.
Harry doesn’t see Malfoy again until the following week. He finally sucks it up on Thursday and Floos straight into Malfoy’s apartment. They’ve been friends for this long, so his school nemesis can deal with a little Gryffindor courage.
“Of course, but-“
“First off,” Potter says as he carefully steps over a creeping root and bats aside a cluster of palm fronds. “I’m not your protection detail. We’re on this case to figure out what this smuggling ring is up to and to stop them if we can, and you just so happen to be the expert on the potions they use and have extensive experience in the particular blood curses they’re so fond of using. So if anything, you’re
He was lying flat on the bench press making loud grunting noises as he pushed the bar up. He set the bar in its holster with a loud clank and sat up smiling.
He hadn’t had sex in weeks.
made his passage smooth. The feeling of being inside him was still too much to bear. Draco tensed, trying his hardest to hold off a premature orgasm. He groaned when he entered him fully and paused. Kissing Harry’s back, he wrapped his arms around him, leaning over so that he was flush against him. He began fucking him slowly, rubbing his hands up and down his chest from behind, stroking lovingly.
Draco answers with a sigh, then, “I do.”
Harry took his wand out muttering a complex transfiguration charm and it transformed into something resembling a two-door black dodge charger.
“Healers say he’s going to be fine. Gashes will eventually heal completely.”
White wine and oysters to start.
“Bend over the foot of the bed with your legs spread, wide.”
After the Dark Lord took residence in his house and was finally defeated by the man sitting across from him, Draco resolved to abolish anything that could serve as a reminder of his presence. Draco though of burning the place down, and starting anew, but the manor was very old and had all sorts of enchantments specific to the Malfoys. Instead, he did a complete remodel. The dark walls and dark furniture were gone. The walls were now, a bright white with a pale tint of grey-blue, with white crown moulding and white base boards. The furniture was mostly ivory now. The effect was drastic. The sun cascaded into the dining hall, merrily. The room looked warm and inviting.
He went back to work and sat at his desk in pain, a reminder of the fact that he would never allow himself to be treated like this again.
“Number 12 Grimmauld Place!”
“You could have told me, Astoria. Something could have been arranged.”
“I like being your submissive Draco. It’s what I want. I've learned a lot about it, and I'm ready.”
Harry jerks in surprise and groans, probably from the shift of the plug. He casts a quick silencing and locking charm on his door.
Draco was relieved, but he still shuddered to think what Harry would have felt if it wasn’t a full moon, that night. Even if Harry could break the ropes, the first few blows would have been enough to scar a person's psyche.
“I do want to spend my life with you, Draco. Nothing’s going to change that. Albus has no issues with it, but James and Lilly kick up a fuss. They’ll come 'round eventually. You’ll see.”
When he felt Blaise’s hard cock pressing against his thigh, he finally thought of Harry. He would be heartbroken if he saw this.
He was left panting and laughing softly, draped over Harry like a blanket.
_____________________________________________________________________________
“What would your new boy-toy say, if he could see you now? Jacob, was it?” he teased.
Draco ignored him the rest of the day, but that was okay. He was to spend the night at Malfoy Manor.
He bent down and started tickling Scorpius relentlessly. Scorpius cackled loudly, rolling on the floor, trying to get away. His son’s laughter was one of his favorite sounds in the world. It worked like a tonic for his nerves, and he felt his heart fill up.
Draco considered him, in his sorry state. He remembered the abuse he suffered at the hands of that vicious Dom and was afraid he would go back to a similar situation. No matter what Blaise had done to him, he didn’t deserve that. He needed this. Draco would deliver his punishment and be on his way. He clutched his arm and apparated both of them to Blaise’s manor, just to be safe. He couldn’t risk Harry walking in on them.
The following weekend, Draco found he was left to his own devices. Astoria had Scorpius and Harry was with his kids at Grimmauld Place. Draco didn’t mind the alone time. He needed time to think and get some shopping done. Harry hated going shopping with him which made him almost miss his shopping partner.
“When are you going to start calling me Harry?” He stroked Draco’s bottom lip with his thumb as he spoke.
“Sit down, Auror Malfoy.”
More cum splattered his stomach but he remained silent through this orgasm, as if he were trying to hide it.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.”
“But sir, we broke the rules. As Auror Potter is my boss, this is against ministry policy...I have a proposition. I have been thinking about transferring to the DMLE in Paris for quite some time now. It’s the best choice for me, as I speak French fluently. I have already written a formal request.”
Draco went boneless. He was completely exhausted. Bottoming took so much out of him. He still had not grown accustomed to it.
The spanking and BDSM club scene owes credit to "A Strong Hand" by Catt Ford.
“I need it. Need it all the time. Give it to me.”
Draco took this chance of having attention averted from him to glance passed the reporters. Hundreds of ministry employees stood still, observing the mayhem, with interest.
The week that followed their office break-up was the worst week of Draco’s life. Harry had been avoiding him, at all costs. Even when there was a big case, he would choose a different partner to accompany him.
It was like a hard slap. Draco touched his cheek softly, still in shock.
Harry swallowed with fear and arousal; he wanted to feel those gloved hands on his body, sliding over his skin, bending him over, spanking him…At the same time he was terrified that Draco was going to take him out in public at the end of a leash and they’d be photographed.
“Is there anything you don’t know?”
Harry tried to pull him back, but he managed to escape his grip to stand up,
He pulled him closer to the water for a rinse, rubbing his hands all over his lower body, finally resting on his cock. Still on his knees, he turned around to shut the water off. Thick steam billowed around them.
“I’m sorry. You said Harry wasn’t here this weekend, and I miss you. I can’t sleep at night. I haven’t been able to sleep in months. I thought it would help to have something of yours.”
_______________________
“Fuck you!”
“Me too.”
Draco started ramming into him now, feeling close to the edge but knowing he was not going to cum yet. Blaise’s words would have normally made him cum, already. The potion gave him endurance.
Draco’s mind began to wander to thoughts of Harry. This kiss felt wrong somehow. All he could think of was Harry’s face contorting with ecstasy, as Blaise moved down his body to suck his cock. He felt his insides seize uncomfortably.
Not bloody likely, as long as Harry was around to torture him, endlessly. Draco just glared in return. He couldn’t understand Harry’s motives, and didn’t care to.
“I wouldn’t mind being introduced to a few Doms. People I could trust, that’s fine. I appreciate the gesture.”
Draco pulled out slightly.
Harry used the fireplace in the main hall to floo call Shaklebolt to give him an update. Draco heard him say that there were a few loose ends to tie up and that they should both be back in London by tomorrow morning.
“When we’re in play, you must always walk behind me. About two feet behind me.”
Maybe you’d have a fighting chance if it wasn’t so obvious that Potter’s cheating on you.”
Unacceptable tone. Draco reached down and smacked his ass with full strength, three successive quick blows. The slaps echoed loudly against the shower walls. He had promised five spankings, after all. A good Dom never forgets his promises.
They get upstairs and Draco leads Harry to the bathroom and runs the tub. Harry looks tired and still seems quiet, as if the alcohol has flattened him—or Draco has. The water runs while they stand by it, not thinking to use their wands.
Draco had to figure out a way out of this, and fast. There’s no way he was getting roped into a picnic with
“Auror Malfoy, any word from St. Mungo’s on Unspeakable Zabini?”
“Darling, welcome home. We’ve missed you.” Astoria stepped forward and give him a light kiss on his cheek as Scorpius followed closely behind her, hiding from view.
He started hammering into him right away. Draco gritted his teeth at the pain, not making a sound. He was afraid if a single sound escaped, he would start begging Harry to stop.
“That’s it. Fuck me hard. Fuck me like a whore.”
He made sure to allow at least one week to pass before jumping into bed with him, both to maintain distance and allow Blaise to fully recuperate. Blaise had to be sore from yesterday morning in Rome, and the waters were murky enough as it is.
“Draco!! Please stop! RED!”
Shacklebolt begins the meeting, but Harry’s hardly listening to a single word. His head is full of Draco— wielding the whip, torturing his body with pleasure, his fingers, his voice, his praise, the sheer joy of kneeling in front of him. There seems to be room for nothing else, and he stares in the general direction of Shacklebolt to make it seem like he’s listening. Finally, he chances a glance at his Master. Draco narrows his burning storm-grey eyes at him and instead of glaring hatefully back the way he always has, he finds he can’t hold his gaze. He lowers them to the table immediately.
“Yea? You miss my cock inside you?”
And then it’s 9:45. There’s firewhiskey in the cabinet. Of course. He should have thought of it before, but he rarely ever drinks unless Draco’s offering.
The seemed to galvanize Harry into action.
“I need you. I need to feel you. Please, it’s been so long since I had you inside,” he whispered breathlessly. Draco stroked Harry’s flaccid cock to no avail. He tried to dip below the covers to put his mouth on it, but Harry held him up.
When he received another lunch invitation to Grimmauld Place, the guilt threatened to overwhelm him, and he didn’t know why. He didn’t owe Harry anything. It’s not as if he and Harry were in a relationship or discussed being exclusive. He knew Draco was married, in any case.
let’s go.” Scorpius gasped in delighted shock, expecting his father to deny him in favor of work, as he usually did.
“Are you cheating on me with a woman? Just tell me the truth, Harry. I can handle it.”
He had blocked him from flooing or apparating directly into his home.
___________________________________________________________________
Draco paused to consider. This was the second time he heard this today. Something in the universe was conspiring against him. Harry would be waiting for him at Grimmauld Place. If he was honest with himself, that’s where he really wanted to be. Harry would definitely be angry if he didn’t show. On the other hand, he couldn’t deny Blaise this small thing after everything he’s endured from Draco over the years. Blaise’s need for Draco was far greater than any one person’s personal preference, at the moment.
“Yes Pippy, Firewhisky please.”
“Hand it over.”
___________________________________________________________________________________________
He picked it up.
He decided he was going to confront the man at Grimmauld Place and hex him into oblivion. He did not care if he was carted off to Azkaban prison. He had nothing to lose. No job, no lover, no wife. It would be worth it to cast the
Draco pulls him close. “Yes.”
Draco is on his back on the marble floor, his eyes blinking quickly at the ceiling, his mouth opening and closing. His arm is bent behind him weirdly. Harry hears shouting, but he’s so focused on Draco he can’t even process. Blood start soaking through his shirt in random gashes and he has a horrible flashback of that night in the bathroom.
as a swarm of reporters descended upon him immediately.
Draco shrugged into his salad.
Draco looked dejected and hurt. Harry laughed coldly.
“Oh, wow, Again?”
Draco shook his head and his eyes prickled, but he kept his voice steady. “We’ll talk about it later, pet. Rest and then we’ll get you cleaned up. I think we could both use a soak in the tub.”
As soon as he did, Harry snapped his fingers and the metal chain came undone. He walked inside and shut the door behind him.
“Harry, stop this. You can make love to me instead. I enjoy being fucked by you, more than you could possibly understand.”
Harry kissed him languidly and softly now tasting himself on Draco’s tongue. He tried to touch his cock, but Draco smacked his hand away.
“A little.”
He almost calls out down the hall, towards the kitchen. He’s met with a slap of resistance.
“Oh, yeah. It’s been so long. I missed it. I love it when you fuck me.”
Draco turns to face him and crouches so he’s eye level.
“With my cock still inside?” Draco nodded again.
“Is this what you want,
Draco nods solemnly.
“No flying higher than ten feet off the ground. I don’t want any injuries today or Albus won’t be able to come over anymore, Scorpius. I’m serious.”
He rolled his eyes but got in. In truth, he feared for his safety. He read the statistics on car accidents and considered them death on wheels, but he wasn’t about to show fear.
“Do you think a true submissive would have an emotional outburst like that and destroy his Dom’s room? They would sooner die than show that level of disrespect. Your jealousy over Blaise is ruining us. I’m sorry I slipped up in the shower, but you have to accept that he was a part of my life. He was my sub for fifteen years. Of course this stuff makes me think of him, but you’re the one in my life now. I feel nothing for him. When are you going to accept that?”
Draco gets on the bed using a stool Harry put besides it, afraid his levitating magic will jostle him too much. Harry’s right besides him as Draco pulls his sweatpants down.
“Nah, not in the mood.”
“I’ll wear one and let you have control—on the boat
Spots of color touch his cheekbones. “Oh yeah?” He sounds bored.
Nothing.
“Harry, look at me.”
He had a case file in his hands. “ I just wanted to compare notes…can I come in?”
He hopes he’s alone. If Draco can do it, then he can too.
“I’m still going to try to get a transfer to Paris. If I you get me stuck in London, you better start giving me real cases. No more using the boss card when our private life is displeasing to you.”
This saddened Draco, but he tucked his wand back into its holster. He could not deny him now.
However, two Doms appeared to be having some sort of competition, their subs bent over two tables receiving a counted number of strokes from their weapon of choice. Each Dom was whipping the submissive owned by the other, the idea being to see which sub cried uncle first.
“Thank you, sir, anything. Anything you want, just…just need your voice, sir. Ah!”
"Open those cock-sucking lips for me, Potter." Harry immediately obeys and Draco shoves in deep enough to make him gag. The hot heat of his mouth is enough to make his eyes roll and he squeezes his fingers in his raven locks for leverage, pulling and pushing brutally, fully controlling the pace. Harry's mouth is just another hole for him to fuck, and he wants him to believe it. He knows it's what he craves. The back of Harry’s head bangs ominously against the door until tears stream down his face and he’s choking, hanging onto Draco's thighs for dear life. The savior of the wizarding world is on his knees getting throat raped by Draco Malfoy, loving every second of it. Loud thuds echo against Malfoy Manor's front door, and it's simply too much for Draco. He feels like he's in a dream when he cums down his throat in mere minutes, letting out a loud groan. Though gasping for air, Harry swallows it all with a smug look of satisfaction on his tear-stained face.
But he keeps his mouth shut sometimes. Potter had been rather frustrated at the time after all.
Some days, he has to pinch himself to remember that he isn’t going to wake up back in the manor to a madman traipsing about his home.
Potter grimaces, knowing full well why it came to mind. He looks like he’s going to apologize again.
protection detail.”
Theo, who’d previously remained silent, simply staring at Harry rather unnervingly, laughs.
“Come along, Potter,” he hears Malfoy say. “No,
Malfoy just shrugs elegantly and waves a hand to change into a finely-pressed three-piece Muggle suit.
But Ron puts his sandwich down and just stares at him in faint disgust and amusement.
“Malfoy, I literally told you what I want. Honestly, I know you’re not this dense.”
Potter will invite him for drinks under the pretext of a case.
Zabini sighs and steps forward, dusting off a well-tailored suit. “Potter, sorry for the intrusion. Someone was supposed to inform you we were coming. You’ve been getting to know Draco, and we just wanted to meet the latest addition to Draco’s friend circle. It really is a pleasure. I don’t believe we’ve ever formally met. Call me Blaise if you would. And this is Theo.”
He wakes up in a cold sweat.
Just because he’s grateful Potter isn’t a complete arse, doesn’t mean he’s lost his mind and started liking Potter of all people.
He enjoys the stunned expression on her face, but it slowly devolves into glee.
Malfoy chuckles and leaves.
But Harry’s a Gryffindor for a reason, so he stands his ground.
Regardless, nowhere in there did they become good enough friends for Parkinson to show up at his home unannounced.
silently to tide them over until he has the chance to do laundry. There’s more pressing concerns at the moment.
He swallows the feeling and slides into the booth across from the other man. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees that Irish Gryffindor and Weaselette’s other ex-lover hovering excitedly in the background behind the bar. He chooses to ignore them, given that Pansy and Theo are hidden away in a booth farther along with far less reason to be here than the owners possess.
Draco doesn’t care.
“I fought a Death Eater today,” Potter confesses quickly. “I don’t even remember him from the war. He was ranting about being from some minor branch of the Lestranges maybe. But he was trying to assassinate Kingsley and I-“
“Malfoy?” he hears a faint voice say. And Merlin, is that his voice?
Harry thinks he's doing fantastic.
It’s good.
Draco mutters a few choice curses under his breath. No one has the right to look that good covered in mud. It’s not supposed to hug all those muscles long since defined by years and years of Quidditch.
It’s harmless small talk. Meaningless drivel. But against his better judgment, it soothes his nerves slightly.
Harry laughs. “You’ve been sharing my bed. I know you’ve loved me longer than you haven’t. I know you’ve seen quite honestly the worst of me and probably very little of the best. And I have it on good authority that we’ve been dating for a while now even if we didn’t know it.”
The sound of the Floo interrupts Harry before he can ask more.
“It’s fine, Potter-“ he starts to say, but Potter isn’t having it today.
“You’ve been avoiding me, Malfoy. So I had to come by and help myself to some tea instead. Just tell me what happened,” Harry says tiredly, plopping down in a chair across from the other man.
“I know it’s not true, and I honestly don’t know why it came out of my mouth-“ Potter starts.
Draco wants to smack himself surreptitiously to wake himself from whatever hell dimension this is. Falling for Potter was never part of the fucking plan.
Even though Draco’s finally managed to convince himself that Potter might love him, not hating each other still feels quite new. Best not to push it.
He’d been polite enough. Malfoy had been bogged down with work for the last few days and hadn’t been lurking around Grimmauld Place as often. So Harry had taken it upon himself to visit in the Ministry. Mostly because he doesn’t get too many visitors right now. Ron and Hermione are also busy with their work. So it’s mostly him puttering around, bothering Kreacher.
Potter mercifully falls silent, instead waving a hand and turning on the telly.
Harry looks away from the reports he’s filling out, twirling his quill between his fingers.
Potter winces and steps closer.
There’s a long moment of silence.
It’s Harry’s turn to shrug. “Bold of you to assume they didn’t think we were already together.”
She even puts down the ten different memos she’s organizing for her report. There’s a quill tucked behind her ear and ink stains on her fingers. Her hair is frizzier than usual, but it’s oddly comforting. It must remind Harry of simpler times.
Right.
But over the next several weeks, Potter is relegated to the deepest recesses of his mind as per usual.
“Evening, Professor,” Harry says evenly. “You’re still alive somewhere, aren’t you?”
He eventually finds the man leaving the Leaky, but Malfoy fucking
“I conveniently arranged for us to work on the same case at the Ministry, and then
He’s sprayed with a second assailant’s blood.
“Whose authority?” Malfoy asks, raising an eyebrow.
He wakes up with a splitting headache and the feeling of cotton in his mouth.
and the wand shoots into his hand.
At the sound of his name, the idiot’s smile widens into a rather devastating grin.
Malfoy groans. “Stop reminding me, Scarhead. It just makes me feel like a moron for taking this long.”
He mutters several spells in quick succession, and his assailant topples over Stunned, in a Full Body Bind, and neatly tied up in rope.
“You leaving me hanging, Malfoy?” Potter eventually laughs, wiggling his fingers at him.
“You know what?” he shrugs. “Fine, Malfoy, it is. Someday, if we get married-“
Some things never change.
Draco gives him a smug look as he leans against the kitchen table. “Exactly, and you’ve called me Malfoy for all of it. Why change now?”
At some point, Potter’s somehow squirreled away enough leave to make this a long weekend.
“…do you think anyone can redeem themselves?” Potter asks hesitantly.
Harry bites back the flurry of questions and shakes the proffered hands, managing a weak, “Charmed.”
“None of that,” Draco interrupts. “You told me once that we all do what we have to do, whether it was the war, the job, or in life. You did what you could, didn’t you?”
There’s more secrecy than usual this time. He hasn’t been consulted, so he can only assume they’ve received word of further Death Eater activity after the attempted assasination. Even though the Ministry isn’t quite as suspicious of him as they’d once been, they’ve attempted to shield him from much of the goings-on of it. They say that Potter signed up for much of this excitement, but that unless he specifically asks for it, it’s not his job to take on cases that are not at least somewhat in his wheelhouse.
He clearly just thinks it’s neat.
“Thank you,” Potter says politely. “Your home looks lovely, Mrs. Malfoy.”
