Christmas at the manor was hectic as always. He woke up bright and early and rushed down stairs to open his presents, as his mother watched, he had received a new nimbus 2001 that he could not wait too brag to Potter about, and his usual array of robes, books, and other trinkets from his parents. He also received a lot of presents from his relatives, clothes and books seemed to be the most common, but he received broom caring supplies and even some toys form relatives who must have forgotten he was no longer 9 years old. Pansy had sent out some chocolates and Blaise a bunch of Christmas sweets. The rest of his morning was spent pacing the halls waiting for guest to arrive.
“they came looking for me, I – I” she stuttered “I came looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own” she lied.  “if   - if they hadn’t found me I would probably be dead by know” she continued to explain the situation and described about how they had actually knocked out the troll. “They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” She finished.
“I know you’re not.” Harry says softly, before glancing down at the Slytherin’s chest and running a finger along what Draco realizes is one of the thin, silvery
Sighing quietly, Draco can’t bring himself to tear the diary entry out of the journal just yet. He had planned to use it for school, but he figures he can leave the page intact until he actually needs it. For now, he shoves the notebook under his pillow and extinguishes the
“Malfoy.” Comes a whisper, a familiar voice that immediately sets Draco’s blood to boil. “Malfoy, are you awake?”
To his dismay, Potter doesn’t look at all affected by his scathing greeting. “Oh, brilliant, you’re up. Put on something warm and let’s go flying for a spell.”
Potter doesn’t say anything, so Draco, assuming that it’s up to him, manages to pull himself together enough to form words. “Potter, I need your help.” He rasps. He doesn’t even attempt his usual haughtiness, since his mini orgasms have kicked up a notch with the arrival of the other and he’s already having a particularly difficult time not outright moaning.
Has it been that long? Draco’s perception of time is pretty fuzzy at the moment, apparently. “Yes, well, all the more reason I could really use some help.” He grits out, feeling his balls ache with the strain of holding back his release.
Of course. It’s not enough for Potter to annoy him during regular waking hours; now he has to do it in the middle of the night, as well. Draco rips open the curtain and fixes the boy on the other side with the deathliest glare he can muster at such a late hour.
is. It doesn’t seem like it’s about to stop any time soon, either. The amount of fluid on his stomach is truly obscene, and Draco wonders how the hell he'd managed to produce that much semen.
When he finally bottoms out, the back of Draco’s thighs flush with the other’s hips, Harry’s fingers dig into his sides roughly with the effort of holding himself back from thrusting up immediately. Instead, he allows Draco to take it at his own pace, rolling his hips in circles as he leans over and braces his hands against the Gryffindor’s broad chest. Draco raises himself up slightly after a moment of adjustment before quickly dropping back down, Harry’s cock reaching a spot that makes him see stars and drowns out the remaining uncomfortable stretch with pleasure.
Draco agrees readily, and they rush to return their brooms before making their way back to the castle.
With his confirmation, Potter waves a hand, and the sticky mess covering Draco’s abdomen disappears. Draco barely has a moment to be turned on by the way Potter’s magic washes over him before his legs are being pushed farther apart and a lube-slicked finger brushes against his hole. He nearly chokes at the abrupt contact, and Potter makes a low noise in the back of his throat, seemingly entranced with the view of Draco’s arse. Potter starts to press the digit inside him, his movements agonizingly slow considering how stretched Draco already is from earlier.
I can help you, Potter. And if you need someone to kick your arse in a Seeker’s match later, I could be persuaded to lend my talents there, as well.” At that, Potter gives Draco one of his uninhibited, boyish sort of grins—something that he’s certainly never done before now. Draco determinedly does not go a little weak in the knees at the sight.
Draco throws his arms behind him, scrabbling at the headboard and clutching it like a lifeline as he’s sure he feels his cock about to explode, the pressure growing with every thrust, Harry having worked a third finger inside of him. Just when Draco truly thinks he’s going to be torn apart by need, his throat vaguely sore from him practically screaming at the sensations, something snaps inside him. Suddenly, a searing heat courses through his veins; white-hot pleasure mixed with more than a little pain this time. He’s probably close to breaking the headboard in two with the grip he has on it as he rides out his fourth excruciating orgasm. Draco’s eyes roll back, and his head goes a bit fuzzy, but when the haze finally clears slightly, it’s to Harry placing unexpectedly gentle kisses to Draco’s thighs and whispering unintelligible praises against his skin. He’s pulled his fingers out of Draco’s arse, but to Draco’s shock, Harry’s other hand remains firmly coiled around the base of his prick, no more than a few dribbles of liquid having seeped out of the slit.
“The seat was open. Plus, I was hoping you might find it in yourself to stop being a prat long enough to help me with Potions.”
Potter is breathing rather heavily now as he drags his gaze over Draco’s body, and if Draco isn’t mistaken, he’s pretty sure he spots the outline of an erection in the other’s trousers. That alone strips away the last of Draco’s remaining sanity, giving him the wild idea to ask for something he’s wanted for a long time.
“sure” said Potter, trying not to be rude but he sounded equally as tired as Weasley. Thankfully though Hermione seemed pleased with her announcement, and though Draco could practically fell her vibrating with energy next to him the entire time they were eating she actually allowed them to have a quiet meal which he greatly appreciated, because Draco was definitely not a morning person and the cold put him in an even worse mood.
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured, Draco though it was anything but beautiful, but he was also in awe of the little creature he had never seen a dragon before. He saw Hagrid reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head It snapped at his fingers biting them and leaving a mark, Draco backed away instinctively. The dragon was sending tinny sparks out of its mouth. “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” Hagrid said.
Hi, Thank reading hope you had a great week and a wonderful weekend, side note, in this chapter and the few couple of next ones, the pacing really is all over the place I apologize, i was trying to match the pacing of the Og books it so happens it's a mess, I mean the entire chess thing happens in like 2 pages?? I sure as hell did't remember it was that short what?. Anyway I digress.
“Famous Harry Potter, can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” Draco teased and Harry elbowed him playfully as Draco laughed
After lunch he went back out to the gardens and was sitting by the green houses when a disheveled looking elf Draco noted looked strangely agitated, told him he was needed at his father’s office. This was unusual as Draco was rarely ever allowed inside no matter how many times he had begged as a child to be let in.
The weeks that followed where strange, Draco and Granger now sat together every morning for breakfast. In the beginning it was odd finding things to talk about, but with time conversation got less awkward. Draco was still having second thoughts about the whole thing but he for some reason could not bring himself to be mean to Granger any more. He still made other students life’s hell, and though Hermione didn’t appreciate this she didn’t really nag him for it after a couple of weeks finding it was most likely a hopeless endeavor for the time being. They mostly cached up about assignments or school gossip, because Hermione never found out about anything, and Draco knew everything so it was fun when he got to tell her all the rumors that where flying in the school. If they were not discussing their upcoming projects, they were most likely talking about some strange magical thing they had read about and slowly but surely Draco began consider Granger a friend.
“but who would do that, and for what?” asked Hermione. Draco though it was naïve, he could think about many reasons one would want to ‘test’ them, or well test Potter specifically. After all the contradicting talk, he had heard in his life about the ‘boy who lived’ the ‘savior’ the new ‘dark lord’ it would not strike him as weird that they wanted to test him, get a feel for where his loyalties laid, or even more try a sense of his character.
After that, Draco didn’t remember how they made it out of the forest or how he got to the hospital wing but frankly he didn’t care. He had been given some potions and was felling considerably better, his knee was still sore form the fall but he didn’t feel nauseous anymore. Potter was on the bed across form him, by the looks of it with a horrible head ache. Draco finally let his body relax, and felt the exhaustion catch up to him he finally let himself fall into a restless sleep.
The rest of the day was equally painfully slow, they had their first history of magic and herbology classes, and even if Draco had always been a good student, it was hard to focus at times. Granger on the other hand didn’t seem to ever get tired of taking endless notes.
Perhaps it was the sheer exhaustion, the overwhelming panic, or the headache he had but he fell asleep on the chair he was left in eventually.
The following morning was uneventful, mostly, Draco had spent most of his time zoning in and out in history of magic thinking of ways to make Potters life miserable. But so far, his ideas where lacking, because everything that he could do to Potter made his loose himself and he was not about to give him the satisfaction. Pansy suggested hexing his drink to turn his hair blue, but, thought Draco though that was funny, it looked like more of one of the twin’s pranks and he had was trying to come up with some better ideas. By the afternoon his mood had improved a little after having seen Potter struggle in potions. He spent the evening doing a terribly boring assignment for transfiguration class, making sure it was perfect. He had a house elf bring food to him and by the time he finished it was almost past 10. He rushed to not get caught in the corridors after he was supposed to. The last thing he wanted was to get in trouble.
That weekend was considerably better. Now that him and pansy where friends again he stared to hang out around her and her new friends more. Crab and Goyle where nowhere to be seen they had apparently found someone else to follow around, and Draco though it was better that way. He spent most of his time with Blaise and pansy and some other occasional first year but having friends to finally rant about Potter’s stupidity was amazing. Pansy agreed on his opinions about Potter's incompetence and Draco felt his old confidence slowly coming back. He wasn’t in Slytherin; but that did not mean he could not make Potters life hell. After all the friend idea was pointless at that point, in his mind it was over as soon as Potter had rejected him before the sorting ceremony. It didn’t take long for Draco to be back to his former self, making himself heard where ever he went, and being mean to others.
“You are the Potter boy, my name is Firenze,” the centaur said, it seen a shiver down Draco’s spine. “You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you.”  Harry just looked confused. “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” Firenze said, he hadn’t even direct Draco a look.
“are you even allowed a broom,” Draco said trying to not seem jealous after harry read the letter out loud.
“You coming or not” pansy called Draco who had been focused on the sunset to notice his friends walking away, “on my way” he said, sprinting up the hill to follow them.
“Oi, patil” the girl looked up from her own book annoyed, Draco didn’t care. “I need you to go get granger for me” he said.
She led him to the other side of the room, and pushed open the curtains, Harry looked pale, more than Draco had ever seen him. his face was covered in bruises and cuts, just like his own must be he imagined. Madam Pomfrey had clearly washed off most of the dirt off his face but his hair was still covered in dust in some spots, and it was tangled up with dried blood. The lighting bolt scar was redder than before and there was a new red mark on his neck. Nevertheless his face looked strangely peaceful. Draco could see he was breathing slowly under the covers, and he finally let out a relived sight, the tension he had been involuntarily holding on his shoulders until then released and he was able to relax. Harry might not have looked his best but he was alive and he would be fine. Draco walked back to his own bed, overhearing Ron complaints a few bed over, saying that it wasn’t fair Draco was allowed to see him but he didn’t. Pomfrey only answered that his foot was on no condition to be walking around, Draco smiled to himself, and drifted off into quiet sleep.
The next few days he spent most of his time either sleeping as he was completely exhausted by the term at Hogwarts, roaming the library of the manor in search of ways to spend his time, or catching up with his mother who now knew practically all of the details he wanted to share. Normally he would have told her absolutely everything, but he decided against recounting the hole troll incident to her, and when he talked about Potter, Granger and Weasley he choose his words very carefully as to not appear overly caring of them. he pretended they acted as mire side characters to the things he told his mother. Draco could tell she seemed very pleased and was definitely very happy to have him back home; Gryffindor or not. He felt good even to the point that after a few couple of days he started to question why he had been so anxious about coming home, as barely anything had changed. That was of course until his father finally showed up.
“Good work Malfoy, Parkinson,” Snape said as he walked by their table.  "Decent work Granger”  his portions and Granger didn’t look any different, Draco though glancing up, felt a sting of guilt, but paid it no mind.
“won’t you look at that” Draco sneered “the losers acting even lamer than usual,” he said. Ron started to go red
“This is certainly not how I thought we would be meeting,” Snape said still focused on his potions. “does your father know already,” he asked as if he could read Draco’s thoughts, Draco had always had the impression he could.
His father resolved to take him to diagonally the following weekend being he had some business to attend to, and Draco was ecstatic with joy about getting to follow his father along to do anything. By the time Sunday finally rolled around Draco had memorized all the books he needed, and looked over the catalog of
Draco could only think he must be an absolute lunatic, why no was being the voice of reason was beyond him.
Students started to enter the classroom slowly  as Draco took off to his first lesson of the day. He took a deep breath and made his way up to the charm’s classroom, sprinting, it was getting late. He made it to the door just seconds before professor Flitwick started, never the less Potter was nowhere to be seen. Draco was really starting to dislike him, what could possibly be more important that their first ever class at Hogwarts that he decided not to show up.
“He’s strange,” he said, “He doesn’t seem particularly academically inclined, which I'll admit made me dismiss him as first, but he's definitely magically gifted. More importantly, he is a natural leader and extremely perseverant, although, not particularly analytic,” Draco said, his father pondered on Draco’s words for a minute or two trying to decide what to think about Potter.
“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?” said Firenze.
As the first couple of weeks went by everything went back into an easy rhythm just as the term before. They spend their free time in the library looking for Flamel still with absolutely no results, took their lessons, did their assignments, Draco spend the weekends with Pansy and now occasionally went to watch Potters practices when he didn’t feel like staying trapped in the library for hours with Granger. He thought of it as research to see how the team played, he was determined to get himself a spot for the upcoming school year.
“You can possibly be serious,” he said with all the confidence he managed to put in his voice, noticing that a note of fear still had slipped through. “I’m not going into the forest,” he said with resolve.
The following day went by fast. Draco spend the evening packing his bag to go back home he felt like he was going to be sick as he tucked all the essential belongings he would need for the holidays into a smaller bag to take with him.
“That as uncalled for,” she complained and Draco simply laughed, they walked in silence for a while “Thank you,” Draco finally said as they exited the school and headed towards the quidditch pitch. Pansy smiled.
It was a sunny out; the chill of spring was finally giving way to the first properly warm weather of the year. He comfortably laid down on the fresh grass, his head rested on his book bag under the shade of a tree by the great lake. Hermione, Harry and Weasley talked about something Draco didn’t care to follow. They liked to talk a lot specially Weasley and Granger and Draco had learned by now it was okay if he didn’t pay attention to every single conversation, he felt himself slowly getting sleepy under the warm sun.
“Nah, I’m all right.” Hagrid replied dropping the trees onto the middle of the corridor to take a break.
“HEY” he complained turning then to see it was Hagrid who was attempting to squeeze himself into the tiny stands
“Listen to me, get back and get the broom from the flying-key room, it will get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, I might be able to hold off for a while, but if its Voldemort behind that door --” Harry stopped,
“Oh, right, Lumos Maxima!” she casted the spell, instantly the vines loosened their grip and they fell onto darkness once again hitting a concrete floor below.
Snape wasn’t pleasant to be around when Potter was involved on that Draco was clear. The disdain for each other was very much mutual. Despite that Draco could bring himself to believe it was him behind all  the stuff  Harry, Ron and Hermione  where trying to pin on him.
“What did you talk to him about, Did you discus Hogwarts?” Harry, asked, Draco ears started ringing, neither of the others looked so well either.
“Look at the of the day wasn’t this the plan, like didn’t you tell me that you were gutted when Potter didn’t take you as a friend the first day what are you so worried about,” there was the question coming Draco knew it
“We are fine!” Harry shouted, but Draco felt anything but fine. “The unicorn is dead Hagrid” Harry said, Draco didn’t know how Harry was managing to speak, his head felt like it was swimming, he felt dizzy and disoriented, his knees ached with pain, and his eyes struggled to focus. Draco noticed Harry looked as horrible as he felt but he couldn’t think properly.
“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,” his father replied coldly and Borgin resumed looking at his father’s list and discussing whatever it was they were saying about blood purity and muggles in the Mistry. Draco made his way mesmerized by the various shelves deeper into the shop. Stopping to take a better peak at a supposed cursed neckless when he heard a whisper coming from the cabinet behind him.
Potter made his triumphal entry to the common room later that evening, and thankfully almost everyone was out in the grounds for the day so there wasn’t much of a fuzz. Just a few stares, and Harry could handle does now no problem. Draco had spent most of his evening in the dorm enjoying some peace and quiet as the rest of the boys had gone out to enjoy their last weekend at Hogwarts for the year. Draco heard when Harry came into the tower, not because he himself made any noise but because the common room below went suddenly quiet. Therefore it was no surprise to him then when potter promptly walked into the dorm and collapsed onto his bed, not even noticing Draco was also there.
“it is a monstrous thing, too slay a unicorn,” continued Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips,”
His father sat opposite to him in the chair his mother was sitting before. Draco shifted his weight, he felt his heart beat accelerate, his palms where sweating, he hoped his father count tell, he keep his posture and looked directly at him as he always had been thought hoping his obvious nervousness wasn’t obvious.
“Yes, thank you,” he said Harry turned back to Draco offering him a hand. Draco recognized in Harry's eyes this was a peace offering.
“but what do we have here,” said peeves “Should tell Filch, I should It’s for your own good, you know,”
Draco was in shock he never expected absolute rule follower maniac Granger to tell a lie, and much less for him. Perhaps he had been wrong about her he tough. He didn’t really hear much of the rest of   Professor McGonagall’s scolding, he just knew they had lost a bunch of points but also surpassingly won some.
Draco didn’t hear much of the rest of the conversation he only knew he found himself standing in a court yard in the castle a few minutes later.
The day of the match was as the rest of the week had been insanely rainy he only went out to the pitch because he really wanted to see if the team would make it to the finals or not. Thankfully the game was over in less than five minutes when Potter caught the snitch. It could not be denied now that Potter had talent. The week after the Gryffindor victory he felt the atmosphere was a bit cheerier even if the rain didn’t stop. The assignments started to almost double and Draco found himself spending hours looked up in the library. Finally, by the last days of May the sun started to return, and the four of them where spending an evening out in the grounds for the first time in months. Hermione still deep into studying for the approaching final exams.
“Hate to say it but, he’s got a point mate,” said Weasley, Potter sighted and took a bite of his toast with disgust he truly did look pale as a ghost. Draco finished eating and got up, he cleared his voice
“Did you see his face,” he said loudly so everyone could hear him, tossing the Remembrall back and forward between his hands, he held it up, “look, it’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” He laughed.
Hermione pulled out her wand. And stood behind Snape, the hem of his long black robes was accessible.
The following day Draco found himself out in the yard with pansy who was loudly complaining and teasing him, at the moment she was pretending to be distraught at Draco telling him she was destroyed after not seeing him in weeks, and Draco laughed harder than he had it weeks at her dramatic monologue.
“Well, that seems -- eloquent,” he mocked “perhaps this is not all bad Draco,” Snape said going back to his potions. “after all you now have a chance to actually befriend Potter after all Isn't that what your father wanted?"
“I’m going to kill all of you,” Hermione shouted ducked under Peeves and ran for her life. Draco followed suit he didn’t look back.
“Hey on the bright side we only have like 3 more weeks till schools out” Blaise said. Draco wasn’t sure that was a complete positive, quite the opposite, he was even stating to feel a bit jealous of Potter for staying at school for the holidays.
He knocked softly on the closed door of potion’s classroom, the coldness of the corridors leading to the dungeons surprised him. Perhaps, at least because of the dorms Gryffindor wasn’t all that bad.
Potter on the other hand looked almost delighted as they approached the house, which made Draco’s desire to punch him in the nose grow stronger. Flitch must have noticed Potters smile as well, he commented
“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories.The boys hardly had time to exchange looks before she was dashing back, a gigantic old book in her arms.
Lockhart said as the flashes of cameras clicked again, Harry looked dreadfully about the whole thing and Draco couldn’t wait to tease him about it later.
Harrys broom was the only one to fly up immediately closely followed by Draco’s, though he blamed the bad quality school broom of course. He could not ignore Harry’s pretentious smirk, and it made his blood boil. Once everyone had finally managed to get their broom to fly Madam Hooch then proceeded to go over the basics of how to ride the broom and maneuver. She instructed them on how to get on the broom, and told them to stay put on the ground. But of course, it didn’t take long till Longbottom messed up and he stared to uncontrollably rise up to the sky. Probably 20 seconds later he slipped off the broom sideways, plummeting directly to the ground onto his arm. Draco only rolled his eyes, he saw Longbottom’s little gift fall to the ground, the Remembrall, Perfect to tease him back latter he took it when everyone was distracted.
“Hermione!” Draco beamed before remembering his father was around somewhere and he should not be acting so delighted. He stiffened and just in time his father walked towards them.
The day went by slowly in an excruciating history of magic class Draco prayed wouldn’t be tested next term because he could hardly focus on a quarter of what professor bins was saying. By late afternoon he wasn’t sure he had even paid attention to any of his classes that day, his brain still running over the lines he had been preparing for his parents the last couple of weeks. Later that afternoon the group found themselves walking around the halls, taking some of time to really do nothing for the first time in a while. They were talking about the embarrassing defeat of Gryffindor to the Ravenclaw team the week prior, to which Harry argued had only been a mistake because his glassed had fogged up because of the cold. They were turning a corner when the found Hagrid who was dragging two large Christmas trees leaving a trail of steps on the floor.
His father had been around a couple of times, most of them with ministry officials to talk business Draco want allowed to hear but wanted to desperately. He had also brought home other important guests for stoic diners that Draco found immensely boring but was forced to attend a couple of times. Most of them with alleged relatives or apparent important political figures that Draco could not care less about. Yet, Draco and his father hadn’t really spoken much since he had got back from Hogwarts, still he knew his father would want to know about everything that happened regarding the stone and as the weeks passed without even a mention of it he grew uneasy.
Draco’s untouched cock bobs against his stomach and his thighs burn with exertion. Finally, he feels his balls drawing up as his pleasure crests with another jab to his prostate and he comes hard, cock twitching and shooting white ropes over Harry’s stomach and chest, with a small amount even making it as far as Harry’s mouth. Riding out the aftershocks of his orgasm, Draco feels Harry thrust into him once more and still before the other’s hot, sticky release fills him, Harry gazing at the blond through lidded eyes as he comes inside him.
Shutting his eyes tightly, Draco doesn’t notice anything else except the wet heat surrounding his prick until there’s suddenly a cool, slicked finger prodding against his arse. He lets his legs fall open more as Harry brushes the pad of his finger over Draco’s hole. Harry takes Draco’s cock out of his mouth, instead moving to pepper the other’s thighs with soothing kisses as he slowly works his first digit into the tight ring of muscle. Silently, Draco appreciates the gesture, clutching at the sheets below him while he struggles to acclimate to having something inside him after so long.
Potter comes barrelling down out of the sky a moment later, landing with a thud next to where Draco is still lying, beaming triumphantly.
The first week back at school almost feels like a hallucination to Draco. He lies low, skirting large crowds in the hallways and sitting in the back of classrooms, only to find his efforts in going unnoticed subverted by none other than Potter himself. It’s truly unfathomable, the way Potter’s eyes seem to follow Draco’s every move; not to mention the fact that he always seems to be in Draco’s vicinity. It gets to the point where he half expects Potter to step into the shower behind him in the morning. (Of course, thinking about this is a mistake, because he had really hoped to avoid such a Potter-focused wank session so early in the school year.)
Summoning a bit of lube to help him along, Draco lies on his back and wraps a slick hand around his prick, taking his time as it quickly begins to harden. The action doesn’t feel any different, much to his dismay. So, he settles into his typical rhythm, his palm sliding along his shaft as he delves into the deepest recesses of his mind, conjuring up numerous unlikely scenarios where he’s having his way with Potter—bouncing on the other’s cock, or guiding the hard length between his lips, taking the Saviour apart with his mouth.
Draco is nearly vibrating with the heady excitement of what he’s about to do as he pushes open the door to Potter and his shared dormitory. He learned earlier that his roommate would be out until sometime that evening, as he and his clan of Gryffindors were taking advantage of the free day and making the trip to Hogsmeade. Thus, having the room to himself gives Draco the perfect opportunity to try the potion. He absentmindedly sends a locking spell at the door before striding over to his elegant school trunk, rummaging around for the glass vial. It’s right where he left it, and Draco doesn’t hesitate to take it out, uncork it, and tip the contents into his mouth. He knows time is of the essence; he may have a considerable amount of time, but he doesn’t have forever.
It’s not too much longer, though, until the burn eases and Harry is able to add another finger alongside the first. Eventually, Draco squirms below him as the Gryffindor scissors and thrusts two digits in and out of his tight hole, preparing him for his cock. Speaking of, Draco’s cock is painfully hard now, the member an angry red and leaking shiny beads of precome onto his stomach. Harry isn’t in much better shape, from what he can tell, the raven-haired wizard’s lip caught firmly between his teeth as he looks hungrily at Draco.
Draco almost wants to tell him no, thanks, that he’d much rather just have the other’s thick cock inside him, but he restrains himself. “Fine, then.”
It’s gentle, hesitant. Potter still holds on to Draco’s hand, but otherwise makes no move to increase their contact, as if he’s afraid he might scare the Slytherin off. Draco, still riding the high of victory and having harboured a deep desire for the other for years, reluctantly lets his eyes flutter shut. Their lips are cold, but something in Draco’s chest feels strangely warm. Not wanting to dwell on that feeling for much longer, he returns the kiss with more vigour.
“Potion, remember?” It’s becoming increasingly difficult for Draco to focus on anything other than the weight of Potter’s body in the space between his legs, just out of reach, and his desperate need for release.
“Ready, then?” The Gryffindor asks, holding the small golden Snitch up in his right hand, prepared to release it. His clothes are in even worse shape than Draco’s, not having even attempted a spell to resist the rain.
Having Potter as a roommate tested Draco’s patience in every way imaginable. Draco barely resisted the urge to hex him when he continually left his dirty clothes strewn about the room, or woke Draco up in the middle of the night as he walked loudly to the bathroom, or let Weasley sit on Draco’s bed during one of his many visits. Unfortunately for Draco, though, rooming with Potter also brought about a whole other host of unforeseen issues. Namely, the fact that Potter seemed to have developed a penchant for exposing himself to Draco. He always walked out of their attached bathroom after showers that were much too lengthy to be purely utilitarian, a lone towel slung low around his hips and bare skin still flecked with water droplets. And it wasn’t just then—Potter hardly ever wore a shirt in their room, shrugging off Draco’s hissed annoyances about his behaviour with claims of increased comfort within his personal space. Draco suspected it also had something to do with the new ripples of defined muscle and tanner-than-usual skin the other apparently acquired while helping to repair the castle over the summer. Even as winter approached and Potter’s skin faded to its typical shade, however, the git still had no qualms lounging about half-naked, driving Draco mad with want.
“Potter?” Draco questions, not quite a sneer, but not quite a friendly inquiry, either. “What are you doing here?”
“You can.” Harry responds in a tone that somehow soothes Draco and simultaneously ratchets his arousal up to impossible levels.
Draco claws at Harry’s back and shoulders—anywhere he can reach, really—and somehow manages to find his voice. “Harry, I need to
He knows he probably looks like a fool right now, covered in mud and grinning from ear to ear, but he can’t bring himself to care.
He shudders with every stripe of pearly white liquid that shoots out of him, sending pulses of searing pleasure through his body that make Draco lightheaded and cause his vision to dim around the edges.
After a moment, his orgasm starts to wane slightly, allowing Draco a bit of clarity on the situation with the oxygen supply being restored to his brain. His first thoughts are along the lines of,
“Alright then, today we will be covering the appropriate method of brewing…” Slughorn begins to drone, and Draco absentmindedly flips to the relevant page in the textbook while trying not to focus on how close Potter is, and how he can practically smell the other wizard’s shampoo.
Draco closes his eyes briefly, taking a deep breath and attempting to control his instinctual desire to compete with Potter at every turn. It doesn’t work, since as soon as he opens them again, it’s to find the Gryffindor still smirking at him challengingly, moonlight from the nearby window reflecting off his trademark circular frames.
Harry’s eyes light up infuriatingly as he laughs. “Really? I guess if one of us had just said something, we could’ve been shagging since the beginning of the term, then.” At this, Draco simply groans in disbelief. It turns into a startled squeak, however, when Harry places a quick kiss on his lips.
Eventually, Draco manages to pry his eyes open when the pleasure fades back into the familiar, maddeningly mild pulse. Potter is gawping at his prick as it continues to twitch minutely, still achingly hard, sending shivers up Draco’s spine with every dribble of semen leaking out of the slit.
The next morning, Draco and his prick are remarkably more than agreeable when Harry mouths at the sensitive skin of his neck and suggests they have another go.
It’s not until nearly two weeks later that Potter finally brings up the topic of their Quidditch match. He’s continued to sit next to Draco in Potions, however, attempting to fumble through their brewing assignments, which forces Draco to teach and work with him as to not have the concoction explode and give Slughorn any more reason to be cross with the Slytherin. (And Draco is entirely sure he would get the blame, as Harry Potter can obviously do no wrong in the Professor’s eyes.)
So that’s how Draco finds himself in the new eighth-year boys’ dormitory, the deliberately House-neutral beige curtains drawn around his bed, tracing his finger along the messy childish scrawl of that single diary entry exactly seven years after he wrote it. Around him, the laboured breaths of the other returning boys—mostly Gryffindors—reflect the exhausting nature of their first day back at Hogwarts, the tireless repair efforts over the summer having succeeded in allowing the school to open exactly on schedule after the war.
“No!” Draco cries. Sure, he might’ve been about to do the same thing, but taking himself to the hospital wing in this state and having
When Draco had received his letter inviting him back along with the rest of the seventh-year students whose studies were interrupted by the events of the war, he almost immediately dismissed the idea. It had been his mother, in the end, who convinced him. With his father in Azkaban, his mother seemed to have lost any joy or regard for most things in life, preferring to spend her time isolated in her room. When Draco had brought up the letter, however, he was surprised to see some of the old vitality return to her features as she immediately launched into what a fantastic opportunity it was for him. Of course, the war had only served to further Draco’s love and admiration for his mother, so he was inevitably powerless to protest once she had gotten started.
The Slytherin takes the other’s hand, mind reeling with the combined excitement of his win and the shock of his given name coming out of Potter’s mouth. The Gryffindor pulls him up, and the next thing he knows, he’s suddenly much too close to Potter, so much so that he can almost make out the individual flecks of green and brown in the other’s eyes. They freeze like that for a moment, until the only warning he gets is a barely-there flick of a gaze down to Draco’s lips before Potter is kissing him.
For a second, it feels like what Draco imagined burning alive would’ve felt like, back then in the Room of Requirement with the Fiendfyre hot against his skin, when he was certain that was how he was going to die. When the initial pain fades, however, it’s completely different. It’s like every orgasm Harry withheld from Draco multiplied by double, overwhelming every one of his senses and paralyzing him in ecstasy. He vaguely acknowledges Harry’s hand still moving along his prick, milking him as he twitches and comes and holding him down with the other hand as Draco unconsciously writhes against the sheets. Draco can’t force his eyes open or his head to move from its position thrown back on the pillow to confirm, but he feels each rope of hot ejaculate as it hits his stomach and chest and pools in his navel. His entire torso is warm and sticky with it, coated even as more and more spurts from his cock with every continued wave of his climax.
Draco, frustratedly thinking about the reason for his suddenly increased sex drive, snatched the potion off the shelf and brought it to the counter. The haggard old wizard there barely batted an eye at Draco as he took his payment, and Draco soon stepped back out on Knockturn Alley. His pockets were a few Galleons lighter, sure, but the swell of excitement inside him at the thought of using the potion was priceless.
“Ready to get destroyed, Malfoy?” He smirks, and Draco’s mouth only goes slightly dry at the double meaning.
Much, much later—after Draco and Harry have their first, second, fifth date; after they spend the majority of the winter hols in bed together, during which Draco learns how it feels to be buried to the hilt inside Harry, the other writhing in pleasure beneath him; after the snow melts from the Hogwarts grounds, the students coming out of their winter stupor to prepare for end-of-the-year exams; and after Draco finally comes to terms with the newest, most prevalent emotion he feels for Harry Potter—Draco sits, alone, in his bed in the eighth year boys’ dormitory, the curtains he spelled Slytherin green once he finally got tired of the boring beige closed tightly around him. He reaches under his pillow, knowing exactly what he’ll find there, still unused since the beginning of the year.
His musings quickly turn to how he can attempt to stop it. As tempting as it is to give in to the pleasure, Draco has a feeling he’s been lying there for too long already, and his stomach lurches at the idea of Potter returning and finding him in such a state. To his horror, though, the movement has more to do with arousal than discomfort. Left with few options (other than going to the hospital wing, that is, which Draco firmly dismisses), he decides to try the first possible solution that comes to mind—getting himself off again.
“Yes, well—now, if you don’t mind, I’d really like to get started on my week of sleep that I mentioned earlier.” As he is rather exhausted, Draco doesn’t have the energy to protest even if he wanted to when Harry simply pulls the sheets over both of their bodies and presses closer to Draco.
Suddenly, a lot of things make more sense. “So—was sitting around here half-naked all the time a deliberate attempt to seduce me?”
There’s a brief silence before Potter speaks up. “Maybe, er…” He tries. “Maybe you need someone else to do it?”
Draco only nods, fearing that his teeth will chatter if he attempts a verbal response. His heart pounds as Potter lets go of the Snitch, the tiny wings fluttering out of the ball and sending it high into the sky above them until they lose sight of it. They mount their brooms at the same time, and Draco finally notices Potter pointing his wand at his glasses and muttering an
There was a fire lit, and his father sat behind his oak desk that over the years had started to look a little less daunting, a glass of scotch twinkling in his hand. Draco couldn’t help but remark looked awfully like does mob bosses on Hermione’s muggle novels.
Back at Hogwarts he surprised himself being much happier to see Potter and Weasley again that he thought he would be, but of course he would never admit that to anyone. He instead kept up his usual too good for their antics attitude, as he happily went back into his routine of classes and Flamel investigation. It was clear to him the boys hadn’t done much progress just as he had expected. He was also quick to brag about his new nimbus 2001, it was still such a delight to see Weasley green with envy but trying not to look it as he described the features and facts he had discovered about his new broom.
He sped up a staircase to the third floor, and almost turned the corner towards the trophy room when he heard food steps coming from the other direction. ‘Filch’ he thought and froze in panic. It didn’t take long for the rest of them to catch up to him.
“So...as long as Dumbledore is here we are safe” Potter said, Draco nodded and Harry breathed relived.
“give it back,” harry shouted, and to Draco’s surprise climbed on to the broom he was holding. Draco half expected him to fall directly to the ground but to his surprise he didn’t. Draco was stunned as Potter meet him midair.
“I don’t know it’s just, it’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could” he said again.
“Thank you very much sir,” he said after finish writing the letter, and making his way out of the classroom
“what the hell do you plan on doing with a dragon,” he finally snapped, Hagrid look at him displeased.
The weeks went by and the rain was getting unbearable. But perhaps most annoying was the fact that even though exams where months away Hermione had already started to panic over them, to Draco it seemed a bit over kill, after all it was only first year. The fifth years appeared less worried about O.W.L.S than Hermione and though Draco had grown quite frond of her he was finding her constant nagging really annoying. Potter was gone most of the time to quidditch practice the defining match against Hufflepuff being just days away. Draco spend most of his time doing boring assignments and making them as perfect as he could to beat Granger out on them or reading in the common room, he was so bored that he even picked up one of  Hermione’s muggle novels.
“Gryffindor won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty,” Shouted lee Jordan from the stands. Cheering filled the air. The whole team went down to congratulate Potter who was still clearly very shaken up.
After the match the weeks only started to pass quicker, and Draco just wished time would stop. The corridors only got colder and colder, and the potions classroom became almost unbearably cold, so much so, that it made Draco not even look forward to his favorite class. He sometimes wondered if the Slytherin common room as cold as the potions classroom and found himself being thankfully for the save heaven of warmth the Gryffindor tower had become. He almost never left anymore. They four spend most of their time doing assignments and prepping for middle of the year exams. Or well he did, Hermione spend most of her time nagging the other two boys about unfinished assignments. Draco wondered if she knew she was basically the only reason they had not failed anything yet.
“yeah I’ve heard”  They were getting into the topic of the quidditch finale wen Madam Pomfrey came to kick them all out, and she would hear none of  Ron's various complains.
“No, Potter went down there on his own I had to stay behind at the potion spell I mentioned” he mumbled.  “But he was there, father just -- potter said it was like he wasn’t – well human, he was living off Quirrell,”
“I – Surely did not think this is how we would be meting – yet Draco has told me all about you, where were you headed to next Mr. potter?”  his father asked, Draco ignored his phrasing implied he hadn’t really believed it was just an accident Harry had been at Borgin and Burkes.
Draco read the letter over and over again, tears falling out his eyes unconsciously, he felt and immeasurable relief. He knew he would be held up to ever so high standards but it was not the end. He just had to prove himself to still be the same he had always been and so far, that was what he was doing. The fear although a little irrational but still possible of being complete disowned and casted out for this was finally gone. Now It was all on his hands, to continue to prove that he was worth his name. he still expected some degree of being out cast, but nowhere near unbearable. He still had his family behind him supporting him and that was price less. He stayed sitting on the edge of his bed fidgeting with the letter until he heard Longbottom come into the room with what he assumed was a broken arm. He quickly left to get ready for bed. He didn’t want anyone, more importantly Longbottom to see him cry. So, he got ready to go to bed and then went to sleep before Potter and the weasel had even come back from dinner.
“I don’t have one,” she said and gave him a death glare that made him to shut up. He still trailed closely behind her over the narrow stair way. they reached the top and started crawling again hoping to not alert anyone on the row of professors in front of them. Everyone was too focused on Potter to even notice, Draco breathe relived, he was still alive.
birthday celebration with pansy and Blaise in June just after the Hogwarts term had ended there was nothing else to remark about that summer.
“Well then son,” his father said picking up the glass and leaning back on his chair again. “I imagine there are many eventful things you’ve been longing to share about your school year,” Draco nodded. “well,” his father said simply and Draco began to diligently recount everything from the dragon to the dog and the stone as his father listened attentively. He obviously left details about Hermione and Ron out, but told his father mostly everything. he knew his father would be proud of him, he had done as expected of him. “Seems to me everything is working wonderfully son,” Draco beamed with joy. “I’m delighted to hear you’ve managed to gain the boy’s trust Draco, but do tell me more about him what is he like?” his father asked. Draco had anticipated the question and been thinking about what he would say when faced with it.
“Did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, Draco could tell he was trying really hard to keep his voice calm.
They walked for what felt to Draco like roughly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path of blood became almost impossible to follow, and the foliage of the tress got thicker allowing less moonlight to stream in. The pools of blood started getting bigger, there were splashes on the roots of a trees. They finally reached a clearing in the forest. That was when Draco spotted it. through the tangled branches of an ancient oak the body of the unicorn lay tangled in a disturbingly unnatural way, its snow-white fur covered in the shiny silver liquid that polled around its head, its horn stuck out towards the sky covered in mud from the forest floor, Draco felt a strange urge to start weeping at the sight.
They though he was insane, they had blind trust in Dumbledore. Draco didn’t really blame them, he knew his perspective on the matter was completely different. They hadn’t been around speculation about Potter their hole life’s, they hadn’t grown up listing to adults talk about the dark lord in whispers when they though he couldn’t hear, they hadn’t grown up going to events filled with sympathizers of the cause.
“Yeah cheers, what ever,” they kept mixing for a few more minutes refusing to look up or talk to her, but at least the potion was starting to look good.
“Oh, and one last thing, I’ve taken up a higher position at the Hogwarts board so you’ll likely see me around the school more,” his father said as Draco unlocked the door.
The three boys where left staring at nothing, they awkwardly laughed and entered their dorm. But form that moment on the animosity between the four of them was significantly less, and Draco would not call them his friends per say, but as the old tale says, there are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other at least a little bit and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them but Draco would never admit that of course.
“Fine, then I’ll go with you,” he said projecting much more confidence than he felt, with his snarky tone of voice he hadn’t really used in a while.
‘leave it up to Potter to show up 20 minutes late’ professor Flitwick didn’t pay them much mind but they claimed they had “gotten lost” as far as Draco was concerned they where idiots.
At around seven the manor started to fill with witches and wizards in very elegant dress robes. He had heard form someone the minister of magic was even there that night. He saw his mother and father graceful host as ever, walking next to each other, greeting all the guest with polite smiles and handshakes and sharing once more does roaring fake laughter’s Draco knew so well.
“Let go get your robes, wouldn’t want you to catch a cold and then miss Gryffindor’s defeat,” pansy said as she signaled Draco to follow her inside leaving Blaise with Bulstrode.
Harry finally woke up on Saturday morning, after being out for week. They were finally able to put together what had happened when he had faced Quirrell, and from the little they had told them it was no mystery why it had taken such a blow on his body fiscally. Draco had the theory he had been awake for longer than they were saying, and just hadn’t been allowed to leave the hospital wing yet. Finally, after incessant begging the three of them were allowed to see Harry . Draco was relieved to see he looked completely back to normal, he wasn’t pale anymore, his hair wasn’t covered in blood, it was just messy as always, he looked like Harry again.
"Draco,” Lucius said, his expression suddenly turning grave. “If, the dark lord shall return to full power someday, and he probably will form what you tell me, we must be ready,”
“I’d like to apologize son” his father began leaving Draco startled “I’ve been very busy and haven’t been able to see much of you this summer,”
“Been learning your curses, or are you still too thick to pick up on anything Potter” he mocked and just as he was about to cast his first spell flitch walked down the hall. They both hid the wands immediately.
“I - Yes” he said  “He will probably find a way even without the stone, but he is really weak at the moment so hopefully it takes him a while” Draco said hoping to reassure his two friends a little.
Everything suddenly felt bittersweet. His bed with the ugly red curtains suddenly felt more comfortable than before, and that cosy dorm felt more like home. He closed his trunk, and looked at everything around him again checking to see if he had forgotten anything, without his books and trinkets his little corner of the room looked off and empty. Eventually he closed everything off and went to bed already dreading the long summer months ahead.
“It’s just assignments Pans I’m fine, plus you know it’s just because our schedules are literally the complete opposite,” argued Draco. Pansy didn’t say anything and just started plucking at the brown grass.
It seems like he’s barely started, though, when he feels the familiar heat building in his groin. The pressure of his rapidly approaching orgasm takes him aback momentarily, but he pushes the thought out of his mind. His hand moves over his cock in a blur as the pressure builds, and builds, and builds, until Draco is writhing on his sheets, desperate for a release that surely should’ve already happened. He stays there, unbearably close to what he knows will be an incredible orgasm, for another excruciating moment. Finally, he feels the tight coil snap as he’s sent over the edge, and he nearly cries at the onslaught.
“Give me a moment to change. I’ll meet you in the common room.” Draco relents, waiting until Potter slips out of the dormitory before standing and hurriedly pulling on something he deems suitable for the weather.
Draco stands there a moment, waiting, but nothing happens. He isn’t sure what he expected—maybe something like a lust potion, a
It has to be Potter, Draco realizes. He locked the door earlier, but that clearly doesn’t matter much to the Saviour of the Wizarding World—because the next thing Draco knows, Potter is throwing it open and stepping into the room.
Potter draws back momentarily, and once the spell is taken care of, he eagerly resumes his earlier ministrations. He pulls Draco’s shirt over his head, the Slytherin having spelled both of their clothes dry and bodies clean as soon as they stepped back into the castle.
He fists the sheets roughly, his hole still clenching around his fingers with every twitch and spurt of his cock. Draco wills it to stop already. It’s all too much; his body is sore and aching with the continued tension, not to mention his somehow both spent and engorged prick. He’s just about to force himself out of bed to make the mortifying trip to the hospital wing when he hears what sounds like someone trying to turn the doorknob repeatedly.
Harry Potter—only envied him. He envied Potter when he managed to set the entire Wizarding world abuzz with his name by merely starting Hogwarts. He envied Potter when he became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in history by
his brain supplies, and the thought sends Draco hurtling even closer to the edge. He imagines Potter’s lust-darkened eyes boring into him, watching him fuck himself on his fingers, waiting for him to
Draco’s mind goes blank as it tears through him, just riding the line between pain and ecstasy. His toes curl and his back arches as his unoccupied hand clutches harshly at the sheets under him, his fingers aching with the white-knuckled grip. Draco’s cock twitches as he comes, and comes, and
He throws himself from his broom with reckless abandon, every fibre of his being singing with excitement when his hand closes around the cold, metal ball, only for his stomach to drop in fear as he feels himself falling. Thankfully, he was flying relatively close to the ground, so all that happens is he gets the breath knocked out of him momentarily as he crashes to the grass, rolling a few times and caking himself in mud as his numb fingers grip the Snitch determinedly.
Cautiously, Potter takes a step toward Draco’s bed, and Draco’s mind goes blank at the realization of what’s about to happen. To his shock, though, Potter settles between Draco’s legs on the bed almost
Draco levels out at the last minute, every step in time with the fluttering, golden ball. As the Snitch makes a beeline for the far side of the pitch, Draco draws close enough to reach a hand out, desperately grasping for the shining object, his fingertips barely brushing the surface. All rational thought having been dismissed in the pursuit of finally besting Harry Potter at Quidditch, Draco has the wild idea to make a jump for it.
The Gryffindor rolls his eyes, not fazed by the other’s taunts. “Come on, Malfoy. They’re not letting the eighth years join the teams, and I
So, Draco was left with an intense desire for his roommate, one Harry Potter, with whom he spent most of his school days as bitter enemies and was only beginning to be tolerated by due to the nature of their close proximity. Draco’s libido had been pushed to an all-time high, a consequence of having the object of his new fantasies so close at hand, and the frustration of it all had culminated in him purchasing an admittedly suspicious potion that could give him a chance for something more robust than yet another quick and unsatisfying wank.
From the moment Harry Potter, with his wild black hair and piercing green eyes behind crooked spectacles, had entered Draco’s life, there would be no one else who could get under the blond’s skin quite as easily. The scrawny, underfed boy had somehow begun systematically unravelling every confidence and air of superiority Draco had had instilled in him with one simple refused handshake. It drove Draco mad. If his first-year self, as he lay in bed that first night at Hogwarts, seething with rage, only knew just how much more was in store for him and his feelings for Potter.
As soon as they leave the castle and begin making their way to the broom shed, Draco tries to cast an
He doesn’t know how long he’s been out, but Draco wakes to find Harry at his side on the bed, propped on his elbow and peering at Draco concernedly. Thankfully, Harry seems to have already vanished the evidence of their activities. Draco lets his eyes flutter shut again, humming tiredly.
“Fucking hell, Harry.” Draco chokes as he feels himself hit the back of the other’s throat, who moans in response.
Potter.” Draco instructs, once they’re safely in the Gryffindor’s bed with the curtains drawn around them, Potter on top of him and sucking marks into his neck with reckless fervour.
to get himself off? It doesn’t seem to work like that, though. Not yet discouraged, he strips off his uniform before crawling onto his bed. If nothing else, at least he’ll get the chance to have a nice, long, naked wank.
He watches as Potter’s eyes darken, far too reminiscent of Draco’s fantasies for it to be anything but his fucked-out mind playing tricks on him. “What does it feel like?” Potter asks, though, and the raspy, lust-thickened tone says that it might not be Draco’s mind after all.
“What?” Draco asks, dumbfounded. “You’re telling me you’ve been pent-up when you could have practically any witch or wizard you want bent over for you if you just bothered to
Draco shifts so that the outline of his own erection presses up against Potter’s. “The feeling is mutual.”
Draco had written then in the elegantly leather-bound journal he’d received as a present from his mother, who advised him to keep a diary, stating that he would appreciate being able to look back at his Hogwarts years. As it was, with Draco having more of a flair for the dramatic and less of a resolve to do anything with disciplined regularity, that was the first and last time he had used the journal.
Taking out his textbook, parchment, and quill, Draco attempts to mentally prepare himself for the lesson ahead. He’s just practicing by recalling the ingredients for a Draught of Living Death when someone unceremoniously throws themself into the seat next to him, catching him off-guard. It’s especially unusual, since he hasn’t had a Potions partner, given that most of the eighth years still actively despise him.
“Sorry to disappoint lads, still here” Draco said starting to feel like himself again, they all laughed. “But I might be soon if I don’t get something to eat come on” he said, and the rest of the group Longbottom included followed him out the common room.
“I know it’s not me who has to go on its you” she said looking at them, “GO!” she urged and him and Harry took off into the next room.
“You coming or not?” said Blaise, he looked back at his two friends standing in the door of the compartment looking at him and was pulled out of his trance. He took a deep breath and picked up his stuff.
He decided it was best to go to bed as soon as possible, he didn’t want to be part of any conversations. Just alone with his thoughts. So, he put on his pajamas and closed the scarlet curtains around his bed as soon as he could and cursed his luck. He heard the rest of the boys in the room chatting for a while, and learned the names of Seamus and Dean, not that that was important him of course, but it was impossible not to over hear them. He also found it strange Potter had also appeared to have gone to bed early.
He left the common room as soon as he was able to, he felt strange like his body wasn’t his anymore, and kept looking down at his tie every few minutes as of this was some sick nightmare that would pass.
“Well yeah you are allowed to make friends,” pansy said Draco could tell she wanted badly to ask the question that was on her mind.
“yeah you try and convince him Hermione,” Weasley said sarcastically walking back to the spot they had been sitting before.
As soon as they were back at the manor his father stormed off to his office slamming the door shut behind him.
Suddenly everting moved fast. His father pushed him swiftly out of the way as Mr. Weasley launched himself at him and started to physically wrestle him. Draco was mortified and Harry who had also landed on the floor amidst the chaos looked at him perplexed. Hermione was staring at him from across the room, she looked scared.
“It had a crooked wing like someone had used it already” he said as if it had been absolutely obvious.
It was also no secret that both sides, does who believed in the darks lord's message, and does who did not had been holding their breath for the last 11 years waiting to see what kind of person he would turn out be. It was the reason his father had asked him to befriend him in the beginning of the year,
"well you seem certain Slytherin is your house, but I disagree," said the hat, the eco of it's voice resounding in his head like it could read his every thought.
“The smallest bottle will get us forward, but there’s only enough for you,” he said. “This one will let me go back to Hermione and Ron,” he said.
The platform was filled with noise and cheering, families embracing each other in the cold winter night. Draco was expecting nothing of this sort when he approached his mother, she had always been very loving but not in the physical kind of way. But, to his surprise, she went in for a hug as soon as he was close enough to her. Draco was a little startled at first, but then felt the dread in his stomach get a little smaller as he hugged his mother.
"what do you mean, I am a Slytherin," He wanted to yell, He was starting to panic his heart racing suddenly he felt dizzy, how long had he been sitting in that chair he wondered.
“you must be hungry” said his mother, “I’ll get you something fixed” she said leaving him alone in the dark corridor.
“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” Hermione took Hagrid’s binoculars of his hands.
A little table with seven differently shaped vials was placed in the middle of the room, along with a scroll of crumpled up paper. As soon as Draco’s fingers touched the paper flames went off on both doors in the room. Covering the doors in a strange purple fire, Draco had never seen. Draco read the paper Harry peaking over his shoulder.
The more he thought about it the more it made sense as an elaborate scheme. If the stone had been in existence for over 600 years without any trouble or real need to move it, why move it know if not to lure The dark lord to the castle? See if Harry could actually face him or not, see if he was strong enough. see if he had potential to become the actual savior. It was no secret amongst wizards specially the type Draco often found himself around, that everyone felt that the dark lord would return eventually, and by that reasoning Dumbledore must have believed that too. Now that he had actually seen the man Draco was sure he would. It was also no secret that Dumbledore had been the leader of does opposing the dark lord in the first war, why wouldn’t he, if he suspected Voldemort was coming back, not test his alleged most important asset in the battle.
“Is that so Potter?” Draco interrupted walking down the stairs. Harry stopped talking, looked at him suspired for a second.
He drew his wand and started to walk into the clearing to cast red sparks to alert that they had found the unicorn when Potter held out his arm to stop him. Draco was about to protest but then he saw what Potter had seen. A hooded figure approached the unicorn, it slithered brushing against the leaves on the floor with its cloak, it whooshed into the clearing with what Draco could only describe as ghost like motion, but there was something very off and unnatural about it that Draco could not quite place. The figured leaned into the unicorn’s neck and Draco had to resist all his urges to screams. Harry still with his arm out nudged him, they started to walk backwards slowly carful to not make Noise. Draco felt it before he heard it, he had accidently stepped on a branch that cracked, the hooded figure immediately turned, Draco panicked and was about to make a run for it, when he noticed Harry had fallen to his knees hands over his forehead he cried in pain.
In fact everything about the big state in the summer felt suffocating, the dark wood good at trapping heat in the winter made the library and common areas intolerably hot. This paired with his father’s insistence on keeping all curtains and doors closed, not allowing any breeze to flow made everything feel stale and old. The grounds where under renovation, no doubt, on a whim from his mother that liked to pull out all the plants out every couple of years to create whatever garden style she saw was the most current (there were in fact current and outdated garden styles Draco’s mother insisted constantly)
Draco was finally let out of the hospital wing the following evening. Although he still felt like a train had ran him over he still needed to go study for finals approaching next Monday, he wasn’t about to let Granger beat him to being top of the class.
“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” oh finally justice Draco thought to himself knowing full well Potter would not know the answer. He on the other hand new the answer but simply scribbled it on the side of his parchment
He opened his own bottle and walked into the flames on the opposite direction.  He found himself one again the chess chamber, no sing of Hermione or Weasley, he hoped they had gotten out safely somehow.  He ran back to the key room and took off on the broom just as Harry had said. He didn’t think twice and instead of going all the way back he vanished the glass on the celling of the key chamber and flew outside.
“Draco, I - err assume you know what you are going to tell you father when you get back” she said timidly,
In the morning, He woke early finding Potter and Weasley already in the common room playing chess on some old and very beaten set. Draco was never a fan of the game, yet he watched them play for almost an hour till Hermione came down and convinced them to go to breakfast. Draco didn’t eat much he  also didn’t pay much attention at Hermione seemingly endless rant about the strategy to find Flamel. But finally, at around 11 Draco was boarding the train accompanied by Pansy, Granger had gone with Neville for the day, as she didn’t really like pansy much. He steeled into one of the compartments and soon Blaise joined in and the train left the Hogwarts grounds he felt a sudden panic that stayed for the rest of the trip back home. He didn’t speak much just listened in on pansy’s and Blaise’s conversation. Most of the time they talked about holiday plans, exams, and reminisced on things Draco had not been there for, like fights in the Slytherin common room, or a terrible charms class they had two days ago when a Hufflepuff knocked professor Flitwick off his book stack by accident. Draco thought to himself in another universe he would have been with them and known exactly what they were talking about, and it hurt him just a little.
It was dark out when the train pulled into kings’ cross station. The windows fogged up scarcely allowing them to see what was going on outside as the train slowed down. The air filled with sounds of goodbyes and bags being dragged around by people eager to get down as soon as the train came to a halt. Draco wiped the fog out the window hoping to spot his parents in the crowd before having to leave the warm interior and venture into the cold night. There he saw his mother, turned back talking to Blaise’s mother. She was laughing, that fake polite laugh Draco knew so well but hadn’t seen in a while, he smiled. He had actually missed her a lot, but the void in his stomach only grew.
“You’ll understand soon enough, he will guide us back to the power we deserve,” his father said, and Draco though it sounded insane but was too scared to think properly so he simply nodded. “we must be prepared,” his father repeated.
“It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something but of course you would too blind to notice Potter,” Malfoy said, He was mad, but he had to recognize the whole ordeal had been his own fault. Never the less he wasn’t about to take the blame. Granger finally stood up.
“GRYFFINDOR SCORES!”.  Draco found himself being fully sucked into the house comradery going on. He was suddenly pushed to the side.
Harry had left earlier in the morning and had apparently already filled the other two on the events of the night before as Granger looked at him with the most disgusting sympathy in her eyes when he walked into the common room and promptly hugged him like he had saved Harry’s life which he very much had not done. Draco wasn’t used to being hugged and it made him deeply uncomfortable but he resisted the urge to push her away he just rolled his eyes instead and gently nudged her away. Hermione understood and thankfully left him alone after that.
He rushed to follow the queue of Gryffindor, but, he was planning to get out of it as soon as he could. Ducking down he took off in the opposite direction merging into a group of Hufflepuffs. Draco kept turning corridors quietly when he noticed Potter and Weasley seemed to have had the same idea as him.
Finnegan and Thomas walked into the common room followed by one of the patil twins, Draco didn’t really know which one was which and at that point he felt it as too late to ask.
“Never reject an apology given without good reason Draco,” his father instructed as he constantly did, Draco simply nodded.
“Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, “Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.”
A few minutes later they found themselves at the feet of the giant sleeping three headed dog, his breath warm as he snored blowing in their faces. Draco shuddered with disgust as Hermione and Harry carefully pushed its giant paw of the trap door the fear ever-growing in his chest as he realized someone had already been there knowing exactly how to put the dog to sleep. Draco  peaked over Hermione’s shoulder and looked down through the trapdoor, there was no sign of the bottom and he could only wonder what awful things awaited for them bellow.
“Draco, if it had been me you wouldn’t even have glanced at me again ” Pansy said getting annoyed  and Draco could not say she was wrong, but he desperately wanted her to be, he kept mixing no answer.
“Now that you mention it, I did think it was a bit strange he hasn’t invited us over for tea in a while,” Potter commented looking at the hut.
“I would ask you the same,” Draco shoot back with disdain. Ron was about to say something when a foul smell made them all turn their heads back. Walking through the opposite corridor they saw the troll, it was about 12 feet tall and was dragging a wooden club on the floor, and they all realized at the same time in terror it was headed directly to the girl’s bathroom.
Potter looked like he was about to collapse he was still covered in dirt form the fall. he was sweaty and had a nauseous look, yet he smiled from ear to ear as he saw his them.
They arrived at the Leakey cauldron early that morning, and headed first to Gringotts, then his father guided him to a narrow street that was much quieter.
The only safe haven he found these does days where the kitchens. they were the only place in the house that the awful wood wasn’t anywhere to be found, and the limestone walls made the room cool. The bustling of the house elves didn’t bother him either, and though his father disliked him being down there or talking to the elves unless necessary he wasn’t around enough for it to be an issue. Most of  the elves, even if not particularly good at conversation, liked to hear him ramble and he often found himself telling them about his friends back at Hogwarts. He also found that his food had started to be considerably better since he started spending his days reading down in the kitchens. Still, he wouldn’t classify his summer as a fun time by any means, on the contrary, if he wasn’t practicing quidditch on his own, or reading in the kitchen, he was likely counting the hours until Blaise’s and pansy’s next visit or pacing the halls aimlessly. In short he was bored.
‘wonderful just what I need’ he thought to himself. The 4 boys chatted enthusiastically, Fred and Gorge recounting some of their last adventures as the two younger boys listened with awe. Draco got up and left as soon as he could, he wanted to get early to the potion’s classroom before his other classes began and maybe have a word with his godfather and see if he hated him too much. Of course, it didn’t help that said godfather was also the head of the house he had desperately wanted to get into. But alas it was better than nothing. He just wanted to know what to say to his father, and the clock was ticking, Draco already feared he had heard from someone else about the situation.
“Do you mean,” Harry mumbled, “that was Volde - ” Harry didn’t  get to finish the sentence but Draco cringed at the insinuation.
“I was thinking of what you said back earlier” Draco said sitting up straight to face Potter who mimicked him and sat cross legged on his own bed. “about Dumbledore” he clarified “I told Hermione the other night that I though he had somehow wanted us to go down there, and she looked at me like I had gone completely mental” Harry looked at him as if his pondering on his words for a few seconds
The first months of the year where rainy as the winter gave way to spring, the four friends where relaxing in the common room one Friday evening after a week full of lessons. Hermione and Ron sat opposite to each other playing on the old chess set, Hermione loosing for the millionth time, this was the only thing she ever lost at. Potter sat by the fire chatting with Draco about the quidditch season as he explained all the different teams and intricacies of the British league to Potter who was still a bit clueless about. They shared sweets they had bought from some older students who brought them after their weekend at Hogsmeade, making a game of who would get the most disgusting flavored bean. So far potter got the worst one, puddle water. Looking to get the disgusting flavor off his mouth Potter quickly opened one of the chocolate frogs they had bought for that specific purpose and ate it with delight. Draco picked up the empty box he had tossed between them in the hustle to open it, and cheeked to see if the card was good and found disappointedly it was just another Dumbledore as he tossed it back to the floor, potter picked it up.  His eyes suddenly went wide,
“I don’t think so,” Draco pointed out the troll was still breathing. Potter pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose making Weasley visibly gag. A sudden slamming of loud footsteps made the four of them turn to the corridor. Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, and Quirrell who looked even paler than usual.
Harry and Ron kept discussing guesses on what the mysterious object may be, all they knew it was small and apparently very very important. Their conversation was suddenly cut short by the appearance of the morning post. It was a busy morning for post, and what looked like about 200 owls started to fly in every direction into the great hall. Draco got sent some of his favorite chocolates by his mother, and though small this made him feel a little more like himself again. Never the less his attention was lost to a flock of about 5 owls that carried a package in unison. he was expecting it of course to be for one of the Slytherins. They loved a show. He could tell by the shape it was probably a broom, and it was a good way to let everyone know to have it delivered by the morning post. But to Draco’s surprised it landed instead right next to him in front of Potter. Knocking over the remainder of Draco’s breakfast.
“What sort of magic is this?” Draco whispered to himself, wondering if he should open the door or if something was going to jump out at him. He didn’t need to, the door was cracked open from the inside, and he saw Harry staring back at him.
“Just tell me now” he said waiting to hear that Harry had died and that Voldemort was on the loose. The professor sat in front of him and took off her glasses and set them on the table she let out a heavy sigh, She looked in some way older, the lines on her face looked deeper than Draco had ever cared to notice.
Take from the text:  "LeviOsa, not LeviosAR!" duh, Rons complaints about Hermione, and Hermione's and McGonagall’s lines on the Troll scene. (a couple of ron's too) (and obviously quirrell's)
“And why is that?” asked Hagrid. They looked at each other wondering if they should tell him about the theory they had been discussing.
“Oh, you are awake” she said in a tender voice that took Draco by surprise and made him fear for the worst, he had never heard her speak like that. He struggled and sat up right on the chair.
“I’ll see what I can do.” There’s a brief pause before Harry continues. “Draco, just why did you go and buy some strange potion from Knockturn Alley in the first place?”
“No, Potter. Just let me sleep for about a week and I should be fine. But I wouldn’t say no to a pain-relieving potion if you can manage to snag one.”
Potter sighs quietly and extends his hand toward Draco with the faintest quirk of his lips. “It seems you did, Draco.”
Shakily, Draco makes a grab for his wand on the bedside table. It takes three attempts, but he finally manages to concentrate enough to vanish the sticky mix of drying and fresh come on his torso. Another two attempts and his hand is slick with lube again. This time, though, Draco ignores his pulsing cock, spreading his legs farther as he reaches around to press a finger against his hole. The ring of muscle flutters in time with his continued mini orgasms, and he begins to work the first digit inside. It goes in easily enough, but the stretch of the second finger catches him by surprise. As the feeling is intensified by the constant waves of pleasure, he can feel his orgasm building rapidly again. It’s spurred on by Draco’s digits thrusting firmly, scissoring himself open like he’s preparing his hole for someone’s cock.
feel the throb of his prick as it spurts out drop after drop of semen, adding to the wet, sticky mess on his stomach and chest. The intense pleasure has mostly faded into the background, but the dregs of his climax still send slight jolts of electricity sizzling through his already fried nerves.
Potter thankfully turns to close it behind him before fully taking in the scene. When he does, however, Draco can’t even begin to describe the level of sheer shock and horror on the other’s face. Draco feels his cheeks flush from a disturbing combination of embarrassment and arousal when Potter’s eyes meet his dumbfoundedly. It’s then that he remembers his fingers are still firmly in his arse, so Draco belatedly pulls them out with a wet
Since he didn’t have much time until he was to return to Hogwarts, Draco made the decision to wait to use the potion. Admittedly, he had some second thoughts about it at first, as he didn’t make a habit of imbibing suspicious potions with unknown effects. The hesitation quickly passed at the promise of what the potion could bring, though, so Draco packed it carefully in the bottom of his trunk, hoping that it wouldn’t break, and began eagerly looking forward to the moment he would have his dormitory to himself long enough to try it. It was significantly more likely, now that the eighth years were assigned two students to a room, than it would’ve been in the cramped Slytherin accommodations. However, if it weren’t for his current situation, he might not have been so compelled to buy the potion in the first place. As with most things in Draco’s life, Harry bloody Potter, his
not to mention dealing with the onslaught of oversensitivity that it prompts. Draco forces his eyes away from Harry’s and turns to the side, catching a glimpse of the faded Dark Mark on his left arm where it’s twisted in the sheets beside him. He would laugh at the absurdity of the situation—if he could actually even
And maybe he was a little bit interested. It had been a while since he was able to talk to someone who didn’t look at him like just being in his presence was akin to being Cruciated, let alone have any kind of sexual partner. Not to mention that with his return to Hogwarts, his libido seemed to have doubled, so quick wanks in the shower just weren’t as satisfying anymore.
“Yes, Potter.” Draco reluctantly replies, his voice hoarse and throat sore. He feels like he’s been hit by the bloody Hogwarts Express at least three times over.
but quickly turn to something resembling concern—muted by the low-level arousal and orgasmic pleasure still humming through him—when he realizes he
“Yeah. It doesn’t seem like it worked, though.” Harry looks up at him, green eyes dilated with unhidden lust behind his glasses, and drops his gaze to Draco’s weeping cock for the briefest of moments before returning it to meet Draco’s again. “So now I’m gonna fuck you—if that’s what you still want.”
Draco barely has a chance to be in awe at the easy display of wandless and wordless magic before Harry’s wet tongue starts circling his left nipple, causing the pink bud to harden rapidly. Harry’s left hand comes up to toy with his right nipple, too, as he begins to close his mouth over the left one now, sucking and lavishing it with attention, Draco’s breath coming in increasingly shallow pants. Then, he moves his mouth to the right one, giving it the same amount of care. Draco never had any of his previous shags suck on his nipples, but to his surprise, he finds the experience to be rather pleasurable. And so does his prick, with the way it quickly begins to fill out again, resting heavily in the vee of his hip.
to shield himself from the slow but persistent drizzle of rain falling on them. He must muck it up somehow, though, because he feels his damp shirt beginning to cling to his skin just as he and Potter are walking onto the Quidditch pitch, their brooms and Snitch in hand. Draco tries to shake off the cold and exhaustion, focusing his mind on the thought of how he can beat Potter this time.
“Not yet.” Potter says huskily before grasping the base of Draco’s cock tightly with his unoccupied hand, effectively holding off Draco’s impending climax.
“fine thank you,” he said. “I invited the Perwells to our Christmas dinner this morning seems they had not gotten an invitation,” he said his mother wasn’t fazed about the obvious reproach in that comment, she was used to this by know. So, she simply nodded.
“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” the man said “And young Master Malfoy, too charmed. How may I be of assistance?” he said looking Draco up and down. he simply stiffened in response but was quickly distracted by the many artifacts around him. Bones and skulls of all sizes where laid around the many shelves along with decks of cards and bottles, there was a severed hand above the fire place and a hole cabinet of jewelry with many sings saying not to approach it.
“aren’t you cold,” said pansy looking up at him, he was not wearing his robes and was indeed cold. “what you think,” he teased, and made Blaise giggle at the dramatics. Pansy rolled her eyes.
“let him go, all he will do is hex you”, harry said and Draco had to admit he wasn’t wrong.  He heard Potter trying to convince Granger to go back to the tower but she didn’t budge. Draco was just a little impressed with her nerve, Potter finally convinced her by saying him and Weasley would go. This didn’t last long though, the lady was gone form the portrait and there was no way to go back in.
Draco sat down at the front of the class next to Granger, to his dismay, but it was the only empty place left at the front. No one paid him much attention, he took note of what professor Flitwick was saying, it was only a short introduction to charms probably for all the muggle borns, stuff he already knew. He found it displeasing that his time was being wasted on explaining such basic concepts. Never the less Granger besides him wrote notes like crazy. He felt a sting of confidence. Surely being the top student wouldn’t be that hard as it looked most of them hadn’t gotten a proper magical education beforehand. Things where looking up for Draco.
“I was hoping you’d let me take you to Hogsmeade this weekend for a date, and then we can see where things go from there.”
Draco raises up on his thighs, and Harry helps by conjuring some more lube in his palm and spreading it over his engorged prick before holding it so Draco can line himself up. Slowly, Draco sinks down on the other’s cock, feeling the head slip past his tight entrance and begin burying deep inside him.
The expected post-climactic bliss does not happen. He can feel his cock pulsing steadily in his palm, and he pries his eyes open with a not-insignificant amount of difficulty. Draco’s cock rests, still flushed and erect, against his stomach, in a veritable
Harry simply grins back at him. “I’m glad you understand. Now, do you want to come to Hogsmeade with me?”
perfectly. A mixture of emotions churns wildly in Draco’s gut at the thought, just as they are wont to do any time Potter is involved.
nature; Draco spotted what he knew to be a few varieties of lust potions as well as a handful of vials with notes that claimed the contents to increase one’s stamina in the bedroom.
of semen. He watches as it twitches rhythmically, the tip fluttering and dribbling even more come, each pulse accompanied by a mild surge of heat and pleasure. He feels like he’s floating, still not having come down from the high of his release. Draco, resolving to enjoy the sensation as it’s presented to him, lies there for another brief moment, his hand working lazily over his shaft as he lets himself get lost in the feeling.
“Of course.” Harry mutters when he settles in, his arm thrown around Draco lazily. Like that, Draco has no time to contemplate the wonder and absurdity of the past few hours before sleep overtakes him.
Harry fixes Draco with a lopsided grin that both unnerves him and causes something in his stomach to flutter. “Well, I was hung up on one wizard in particular—but I guess you’re right, since I didn’t actually even try and managed to have him begging for me.”
you can think to do?” Draco hates the needy edge in his voice as the strain of withholding his climax gets more and more unbearable. With it, he’s rapidly losing the will to not suddenly orgasm in front of Potter.
Draco is relaxing pleasantly in his post-orgasm stupor when Harry speaks up. “I really like you, Draco.” He murmurs into the sex-scented air between them.
It wasn’t nearly as small on the inside, possibly due to the use of wizard space, and Draco assumed he should’ve expected that. It was a fairly standard potions shop, too, albeit a bit dingy—which Draco thought nothing of given the shop’s location. He was just about to turn and leave, having disappointingly sated his curiosity, when a display in the back corner caught his attention. It seemed to be focused on potions of the more
His unrelenting arousal having somewhat stagnated and Draco’s body reaching a sort of acceptance of the sensation, Draco begins to feel more at ease. It’s as if he’s submerged in the sea, Harry’s thrusts the push and pull of the current, the noises he makes muffled from somewhere above the surface. But then, Harry changes the angle ever so slightly, which causes his next thrust to press right against Draco’s prostate—and Draco’s momentary peace is shattered.
Malfoy, how did you come this much?” He asks, and Draco really doesn’t want to think about the way his voice deepens with the question.
Luckily for him, the opportunity comes one rainy night about a week later, after the rest of the eighth-year boys have already fallen asleep.
horny since the start of term, and that I hoped the potion would give some sort of boost to my unsatisfying wank sessions?” At this, Harry goes remarkably scarlet for someone who was just balls-deep in Draco’s arse.
He growls, before regaining his composure. “Er… maybe. But wait—I might have something we can try first.”
and one that Draco helped facilitate, no less. He envied Potter when he had the attention of the entire school, narrowly avoiding death in every Triwizard Tournament task by sheer blind luck and stupidity. He envied Potter when he was able to happily snog Chang and the Weaselette while Draco was busy desperately vying for a modicum of his father’s approval. And, above all, he envied Potter for taking the stance he was never able to—defying the Dark Lord at every turn, an unwavering resistance even in the face of death.
The Snitch darts right abruptly, and Draco follows the movement on autopilot. Everything else fades into the background as his eyes remain fixed on the goal, the ball flitting back and forth in his sight. Bearing down even more, Draco is so close he can practically taste the metallic tang of the shining object, even as he feels Potter hot on his heels, waiting for Draco to slip up so that he can claim it for himself. Draco won’t give him the satisfaction this time, though. The Snitch dives down low, toward the pitch, and Draco goes into a steep nosedive to keep up. At some point, as the ground grows closer and closer, he feels Potter pulling back, increasing the space between them.
Draco tries to fight to keep the smile out of his voice. “That sounds like a better option to me. But I’m afraid I won’t feel the need to come again for at least a year after this.”
He tries to brace himself for it as much as he can, but the moment Potter’s fist closes around his cock, Draco practically feels his soul leave his body. Potter only gives him a few strokes, fingers sliding over the mess of lube and come, before Draco unclenches his prick and gives in to the throes of orgasm yet again. He throws his head back and howls, his hips attempting to rise off the bed as he shoots rope after rope of white liquid onto his stomach, but Potter holds him down firmly with his free hand.
Draco arrives at his morning Potions lesson and sits in the back of the classroom, as routine by now. It’s unfortunate that his favourite subject is less than exciting to him these days, mostly thanks to Slughorn’s abhorrent teaching methods as well as his obvious distaste for Draco’s presence and contrasting reverence of Harry Potter. Potions is the one class that truly makes him yearn for the old days, when Draco would snicker at the front of the classroom with Blaise, Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle as Snape took points from Gryffindor for the most inconsequential of details. Such reminiscence reminds Draco of how painfully alone he is now, with Blaise, Pansy, and Greg having chosen not to return for their eighth year.
Once they both begin to catch their breath, Draco looks up from his position slumped against the other’s chest to see Harry flicking his tongue out and licking the glob of Draco’s come off of his lower lip. The sight sends a muted jolt of arousal through him, and he inadvertently clenches his arsehole at the feeling, which causes both he and Harry to gasp at the overstimulation. With shaking legs, Draco manages to raise himself off of Harry’s softened prick, and he doesn’t miss the way Harry’s eyes snap to the space between his legs when the excess come begins trickling out of him. The Slytherin flops down in the minimal space beside Harry for the time being, at least until he can gather the strength to return to his own bed.
“Sure.” Draco replies, with a confidence he doesn’t actually feel. His total number of sexual encounters may be small, yes, but the number of times he’s bottomed is even smaller.
Draco makes his way back to the eighth-year wing, heat already thrumming under his skin in anticipation. It’s an opportunity he’s been waiting weeks for—where he’ll finally get to put the mysterious potion vial hidden at the bottom of his trunk to the test.
Draco thinks sourly, reflecting on how the connotation of the phrase has changed and evolved during his time at Hogwarts.
Another pause, in which Draco has to force himself to focus on the conversation and not on the throb of his painfully engorged cock in his hand.
Draco is too far gone to hold back his cries when he curls his fingers just right, finding his prostate, and the almost unbearable, sudden force of his climax overcomes him. He thrashes, his hips lifting off the bed as his cock pumps out even more come, drenching his stomach once again in his release. Every nerve in his body feels like it’s been set ablaze, and Draco is powerless to stop it until finally the pleasure-pain crests and ebbs but doesn’t completely retreat, leaving him maddeningly hard and shuddering with continual aftershocks.
spell he used to light the area. After lying awake a while longer, worrying about his decision to return to Hogwarts, he finally manages to drift off to sleep, where he’s greeted by a familiar pair of green eyes in his dreams.
“For now, let’s just say that I’m willing to help out whenever you feel the urge to take some strange ‘pleasure’ potion again.” Harry replies, running a hand over Draco’s chest.
See, somewhere around his fourth year, Draco’s self-proclaimed hatred of Potter began to shift into some kind of hideous amalgamation of feelings that Draco still isn’t sure he could give a name to. Left unchecked, the strange, burning emotions start to devour Draco from inside out at the mere mention of Potter’s name. That, of course, is a less than desirable outcome, especially when it directly translates to Draco making an absolute fool of himself in front of the git. Mostly, he’s learned to tune out all but select feelings for Potter as mere background noise—those feelings being envy, and, well… lust.
Over the summer, Draco found himself having to reluctantly frequent Knockturn Alley, the dodgy row of establishments adjacent to the much more palatable wizarding shopping district of Diagon Alley. He didn’t like it, having had more than a taste of the damp, musty shops there during trips with his father when he was younger. Unfortunately, though, he didn’t have a choice, since he was no longer welcome in the more respectable areas of wizarding society, being an ex-Death Eater and all.
Starting at Draco’s jaw, Potter mouths along the long expanse of his neck and down to his clavicle. “You should call me Harry.” He mumbles into the other’s skin.
He has to take a moment to find the words. “It’s like… like being in a constant state of arousal and orgasm at the same time. Not like a full-on orgasm, though, more like the feeling right at the end. But it just… doesn’t stop.”
Deep-seated envy was one thing, but it was Draco’s fourth-year discovery of his sexuality that began the slow descent into madness that was lusting after the Boy Who Lived. Sometimes, there are difficult things to accept about oneself, and for Draco, it’s his unwavering desire to fuck Harry Potter—or be fucked by him. The Slytherin has come to the point where he wouldn’t object to either scenario. Make no mistake; Draco’s desires go absolutely no further than begrudgingly admitting the git is attractive and worthy of a good shag.
Despite the borderline pain, Draco’s body shudders in pleasure, heat coiling in his stomach and burning through his limbs. Every sensation sends excruciating shockwaves through his body, doubling the pressure of his need for release. It scrambles his brain until Draco knows nothing but the feeling of Harry’s cock inside him, his own cock throbbing in the other’s hand. Stars swim in his vision which is rapidly darkening around the edges.
Draco doesn’t hear Harry mutter anything else, but he sees him bring his other hand down to tug at his prick and Draco picks up on the slick noise of lube on skin. Harry’s eyes never leave Draco, though, and Draco tries with everything he has to fight the shivers of pleasure that just the gaze causes in him. He’s still infuriatingly on edge, desperate to come, but something about the view of Harry drinking in Draco’s debauched and needy form so readily as he strokes himself is able to give him pause. With his free hand, Harry finally moves to line the head of his cock up with Draco’s loosened hole.
Draco opens his eyes enough to give Harry a withering look. “Okay, Potter, do you really want to hear all about how I had been
As it is, Draco feels decidedly lightheaded with the intrusion of Harry’s sizable prick splitting him open.
He teases, but Draco no longer has the sense of mind to form a coherent response. His brief moment of lucidity is gone, and he fears it may never return.
When Harry looks back up at him, his demeanour is completely changed. The dark glint of lust in his eyes has heat pooling in Draco’s groin like nothing else. “Gladly.” The Gryffindor growls, and suddenly they’re both stark naked.
About an hour later, the two have worked up quite the sweat, chasing after a particularly evasive Snitch. Draco, elated to finally be on a broom again, may have to admit that he’s not paying as much attention as he should be to the object of the game, but rather his opponent. Still, he
From here, Draco can distinguish the loud snores and mumbling from Weasley to his right, and the restless fidgeting from Longbottom to his left, but no matter how hard he strains his ears he can’t make out any noises coming from Potter’s bed directly across from him. Trust the Boy Who Lived to even
Thankfully spurred on by Draco’s words, Harry abruptly presses himself into Draco. “What happened to ‘
Everything is too much for Draco. Wetness clings to his eyelashes and sweat plasters his hair to his forehead. He’s digging into the skin of Harry’s back so roughly he’s likely drawing blood—but Harry doesn’t seem to mind, his brow furrowed in concentration as he takes his pleasure from Draco’s body. Draco is too incoherent to do much more than whimper with every hit to his prostate, now almost numb to the overwhelming feeling and his unbearable need for release.
He does that again and again, bouncing on the other’s prick in ecstasy as it hits his prostate every time, until an incoherent string of whines and curses is spilling from Draco’s mouth with each thrust. Harry’s grip on his thighs only gets more bruising when the other begins to arch up and meet Draco’s movements, driving his cock impossibly deeper into the blond.
Harry hasn’t moved, just simply buried himself to the hilt and stilled, hovering above Draco with one hand between them on Draco’s cock, still keeping him from coming. Draco genuinely can’t bring himself to do anything but moan brokenly as a request for Harry to move, and he’s thankfully understood. Harry pulls out halfway before snapping his hips and pressing back into Draco with one abrupt motion. He does it again and again, Draco’s body going tauter with every thrust.
Draco babbles, paying no mind to his choice of words, as he’s fairly certain he’s close to dying from the combination of pure ecstasy and desperation.
Draco interrupts him, too caught up in the euphoria of his victory to insert his usual snark. “I’m fine, Potter. And look—” He holds his right hand out for the other to see what’s in it.
Harry continues, starting to press chaste kisses into any part of Draco’s skin he can reach. “And because making you genuinely smile, even if it means losing to you at Quidditch, gives me a kind of euphoric feeling that nothing else does.” Finally, he leans up to place a tender kiss to Draco’s lips. “And you look especially gorgeous bouncing on my cock.”
“Oh, thank fuck.” Harry sighs ever so eloquently. “I was worried the potion might’ve done more harm than it seemed.”
He feels the cool wash of a cleaning spell not a moment later, the Gryffindor once again making Draco’s head fuzzy with his easy use of wandless and wordless magic. The spell leaves Draco’s skin prickled with gooseflesh, until Harry’s hand comes to rest atop the blond’s chest, soothing him.
Frantically, Draco wraps a hand around the base of his prick and squeezes. To his surprise, it seems to work, even holding back the previously steady dribbles of semen as it keeps him from orgasming due to Potter’s mere presence.
Finally, to his surprise, Draco sees a flash of gold above and in front of him, just as Potter turns to search in the other direction. He wastes no time, every nerve pulsing with adrenaline as he leans lower against his broom, pushing the school-regulated model to its limits. He climbs farther into the sky, the Snitch now in full sight. Potter notices what’s happened and races to catch up, but Draco already has a significant lead on him, the golden ball coming closer and closer to his grasp.
Even though the eighth years were given much more lenient permissions and curfews regarding roaming the castle or going to the nearby Hogsmeade, Draco and Potter make sure to keep to the shadows when going outside, as they still think Filch more than capable of making a fuss if he finds them.
You’re basically the sole reason I was frustrated enough to take the bloody potion in the first place!” Draco growls.
Okay, so maybe Draco has been itching to get on a broom ever since he arrived back at Hogwarts. He can’t let Potter think he’s right, though.
