“Who would like to go next?”
“Bloody Gryffindor. I wasn’t ready to talk.”
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps it’s not about honor. Perhaps it’s only about absolution, a chance to take control where I never had it before.”
“If you’re going to get involved with him, you need to address the hippogriff in the room. You do remember that your hatred for each other almost resulted in both your deaths, right?”
“Shit. Sorry. Please let me explain.”
“But that’s just it. We’re friends. What if he says no and it ruins our friendship? What if he says yes? I’ve never been on a date with a guy. I’ve never kissed a guy! What if he wants to have sex? I don’t think I’m quite ready for that yet. I mean, I want to. He’s really fit. What if I bollocks this up? I’m not exactly Cassanova, Hermione.”
Harry redirected his gaze to the window, "I hadn't really thought of that."
After voluntarily going back to Hogwarts to retake their last year and complete their N.E.W.T.'s, the final students that were most greatly affected by the war graduated from Hogwarts and slowly but surely dispersed into the real world. Draco knew Neville had ended up in the Netherlands, attending a Muggle University, Hermione was an intern at the Ministry- undoubtedly going to make a career out of whatever it is she did there, and Harry Potter still lived in London. Out of pure coincidence, so did Draco.
"Yeah, I couldn't stay there longer than I needed to. Since I was the only one who went back, I don't know... And McGonagall obviously would have never let anything happen, I just felt like I shouldn't have been there." Draco felt tear prickling at the corners of his eyes.
It sent Draco into a fit of laughter.
Harry stepped forward and held him. "You know, when I saw you at the pub that first time, I couldn't believe it. Ron was being a git about it but I was happy to see you. You were with Pansy. Hermione said you two were together, and you were just drinking and seemed to be having a nice time." Harry smiled at the memory.
They both laughed, and Draco suddenly had a strong urge to be closer to Harry, much closer. He set his drink down and swiftly lifted his leg to straddle Harry, taking care not to bump his drink. Harry looked up, surprised, but visibly melted when he looked into Draco's eyes. Draco leaned in and kissed him, he only wanted this, with Harry, nothing else.
After Draco had apologized, he felt lighter. There were so many others that he owed conversations to, and now he felt like he'd have the courage to do it. Harry's presence was so warm and inviting, Draco had never really been around anyone that felt like this.
After Pansy did his other ear, Draco felt the need to get all dressed up. "Let's go out."
The bathroom was beautiful, all deep jewel tones with gold accents, and a large, leafy plant in the corner. Draco turned the shower on and began to undress. He heard a knock and before he could say anything the door opened slightly and a hand poked through the crack, "Here you are, and use whatever you want in there." Draco walked over, taking care to stay out of view, and grasped the shirt, "Thanks, Harry."
"I'm sorry," Draco said, exhaling.
"Thought it'd be nice to be alone for a bit." Draco saw a red tint in Harry's cheeks but couldn't tell if it was the weather or not.
Harry smiled and let out a long breath, lowering his eyes slowly. "I guess, when we went back to school, I wanted to get closer to you but everything was still so new, you know? It was all so rushed, there was so much going on, and then you finished early and I didn't see you for a while."
"Do you have a headache?" Harry asked, Draco nodded which led him to get up and walk around the table. Harry placed a hand on the back of Draco's neck and cast a quick pain relief charm Hermione had recently taught him. "Better?"
"Feeling brave tonight," Harry answered and shrugged, looking relatively serious, and took Draco's hand. He led him into the crowd until they were nearly in the middle of it. Harry put his hands around Draco's waist and they moved together. Draco couldn't hear any specific song but he could feel the bass vibrating through his entire body. He couldn't fully wrap his head around what was happening at the moment. Draco really just expected to look flirtatiously over at Harry a few times if he saw him, much less be dancing with him in a room full of strangers. Harry put his leg between Draco's and Draco was thankful the lighting was so low so Harry couldn't see him blush. Harry looked right into Draco's eyes and let out an inaudible chuckle.
Draco walked closely behind him, noticing how curly his hair really was. Harry made a left Draco was not expecting and he bumped into him. Harry turned around, smiled, and teasingly said, "Back off of me, Malfoy." He opened a closet door Draco hadn't noticed and handed him a soft, deep green towel. "I can bring you a shirt to borrow if you'd like."
Draco lit his cigarette. He felt the heat travel through his body and the nicotine gave him a slight head rush. "So," Draco said and breathed out a cloud of smoke.
"Are you ready?" Pansy asked, lining the needle up with the dot she had drawn on Draco's ear.
"What were you going to say?" Draco asked, now fully relaxed.
Draco watched as Harry slowly pulled on a pair of dark gray sweatpants and a white T-shirt. "Breakfast?"
"Draco," She said dragging out the 'o', "How about this, you go out without me, and I stay here."
The club was called Orpheus, which Draco thought was a little pretentious but he loved it. It was a muggle club but enough of the staff were Wizards that you didn't have to worry about accidentally giving some muggle a magic show and then be too drunk to have to explain yourself to anyone. There was always at least one bartender and one security guard that he knew so Draco felt safe there. Plus, he was not one to get so drunk that he couldn't control himself or his magic so it didn't really matter either way.
"Okay, one, two-" She shoved the needle through and Draco let out a little yelp. "-three!" Pansy giggled and put the earring into Draco's still bleeding ear.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alone? If he's there, he'll know what I'm up to." Draco positioned himself across from his friend, "Don't you think?"
"Yeah, Harry, I am really sorry about crashing here. I don't know what happened, I didn't mean to-" Draco started.
Harry tilted his head, confused. "Being seen?"
"Alright, let's get you to the couch," Harry said, mostly to himself, while hoisting Draco gently over his shoulder then laying him down.
Draco opened the door slowly, acutely aware of how quiet it was in the house. "Harry?" He said at nearly a whisper, peering around the corner. "Harry?" He said a bit louder, but there was no reply. Draco did not want to go wandering around his house, but he also did not want to be alone in his house, so he began up the stairs. As soon as he reached the top, he saw Harry and froze. If he tried to back down the stairs, he might make noise or fall which would be rather humiliating, but watching Harry change without him knowing Draco was watching felt like he was committing a crime of some sort. Draco figured it was best to simply tell on himself.
"Not if you go to that one club," Pansy sinks down to the floor next to Draco. "The one we keep seeing Potter at." She poked him in the side a few times and he batted her hands away.
"I like them, that is sweet of him."
"That's really alright, no need to be embarrassed. I was fully ready to be naked with you last night, so truly, don't worry about it, love." Harry walked over and placed a kiss on his cheek.
Harry brought over two red and gold painted mugs, which made Draco chuckle. Harry raised his eyebrows in defense and smiled, "Hey! They were a gift from Ron and he's kind of shit at gift-giving. I probably have a hundred Gryffindor-themed items hidden around this place, if you look hard enough."
"I can hardly see it, you git. Now get over here so I can do the other side! Don't want just one ear pierced, do ya?" She resituated herself on the bed and got another needle ready.
A look of indignation flashed across his face and Draco thought he had made a mistake, but then Harry shook his head and sighed. "I remember seeing a photograph of you and some bloke in the paper with some rude headline a while ago. It was completely uncalled for."
"Right," Harry mumbled, stepping back. "Follow me, I'll get you a towel."
Draco watched as understanding washed over Harry's face. "You're worried about people finding out I am gay," said more like a statement than a question.
Draco shook his head in disbelief and said without thinking, "It's what I was thinking about last night before I fell asleep, but I guess when everyone already loves you it's different."
And now, unfortunately, Draco was beginning to feel some negative effects of all the drinks he's had, after luckily being only warm and tingly all night. He sat up and shifted his weight off of Harry's torso. Draco suddenly realized that he had been silent for what felt like several minutes and that Harry was looking at him very concerned.
Draco felt a pang of sadness in his chest but he really felt like he should get out of there. He could hear his heart in his ears and his headache was not easing up. "I'm sorry, I-I just don't feel well."
The warm water on his skin felt like medicine, and the tension in his shoulders melted away. If Harry wasn't worried about people seeing them together, why should he be?
After his shower, Draco stood in front of the mirror for several minutes looking at himself in Harry's shirt. Harry Potter's shirt. It was loose on Draco, but it looked good. He had to muster the courage to actually exit the bathroom and found himself surprised at how nervous he was. His hair was not going to dry the way he'd like it to and he couldn't stop messing with it, as Harry, of course, did not own any of Draco's usual products. He did, however, have quite the selection of scented hand soaps.
Since when was Draco the flustered party and Harry Potter the cheeky one? Draco never feels this sheepish and unsure, and especially in scenarios like this. He is ordinarily so confident, some would even say excessively confident. Draco doesn't get nervous.
"Um, your bathroom?"
"Oh," Harry took his hands off the table and folded them neatly in his lap. "Yeah, if you want to."
Narcissa wasn’t looking at Draco, but at their reflection in the mirror. And Draco realized when he looked up, that perhaps she was saying rather a lot of things in those awkward pauses. He reached across the table and put his hand over hers. “They’re good people. And they’ve been there for me when no one else was.”
He looked at her so earnestly that Hermione actually thought about how to change one’s appearance and still enter Gringotts. “Hair dye.”
And for a moment, Harry considered it, imagined pulling his arm back and letting it fly with painful precision. Several times. Even in his imagination, it was exhausting. And besides, the food would be ready soon. “I guess that makes you an enigma wrapped in a mystery coated in sarcasm and asine rules.”
Ron leaned over too, biting his lip and thinking hard. “I don’t know. These look very dainty. Ginny’s not really dainty.”
“I’ve been leaving her alone in the flat.” And thinking about Draco’s hands.
Jude leaned back with his head tipped up against the wall. Closer now, Harry could see his clothes were old, worn at the elbows and across the thighs. “Here.” Harry held up his peace offerings. “There weren’t a lot of options.”
“I’m not proposing. I am not ready to get married either! I don’t even know if we’re actually dating or sort of dating or whatever it is you did with that other guy!” Harry insisted, a little irritated now. Because there hadn’t been any kissing, but there had been all that touching. Touching like Draco did with Evan and Sophie and Tilly, but Harry was pretty sure none of them felt the same way Harry did when Draco touched him.
“Who are you inviting to lunch?” Ron asked.
Oliver licked his lips. “Oh my.” He leered again.
Harry trailed after him, alternately admiring the shape of Draco’s arse in those trousers and the way his fingers lingered along shelves and spines as he picked his way through the store. Eventually, Draco arrived at the historical section. His steps slowed, his fingers lingered longer along the spines, and he even occasionally cocked his head to read the title. Harry loved the way he moved with a casual disregard, as if nothing else in the space mattered, just Draco and the books.
"What if someone had taken a picture, sold it to the Prophet? I wouldn't want to draw any unwanted attention or anything." Draco's head pounded louder as he thought about it.
"Nice earrings," Harry said right before they lifted the glasses to their lips. Draco watched Harry's throat as he swallowed the liquid. His olive skin seemed to glow in this light.
house dressed in obvious morning-after attire there could be consequences. Consequences Draco was too tired to list right now but was entirely sure they existed.
"But that defeats the entire point!" Draco said exasperatingly.
"Maybe they are, Potter. What about it?" He said lowly.
"How are we feeling this morning?" Harry said in a gravelly, much lower-than-normal voice as he walked into view.
"Yes, count to three, please?" His voice faltered at the end. Draco wasn't scared of the pain, obviously, it's the anticipation that had him shifting in his seat.
"No! That's not what I mean, well, I was going to apologize for asking you to stay. I know now that you weren't feeling well but it still feels like a mistake to have asked and," he let a long breath out and raised his eyes to meet Draco's but swiftly returned his gaze to his mug. "What, um, what are you thinking about?"
"Two spoons of sugar, please."
"Thank you," Draco said as he scrunched his face and set down the shot glass. "Another?" And they each took another.
"I thought we were going to order in! I still have some work left to do for tomorrow." She pouted. "We can go out next weekend?"
Draco got on his knees in front of her, "Please... dearest, sweetest Pansy, let's go get fucked up." He said looking up at her with wide eyes.
Harry leaned in and he spoke right next to Draco's ear. It sent a chill through his body. "Nothing, I was just thinking how I've been wanting to do this for a while now."
"Thank god," Harry mumbled into his mouth and Draco felt his chest flutter a little bit. They kept moving together, grinding on each other, kissing each other until Draco was breathless and felt light-headed. He pulled away, motioned bringing a cigarette up to his lips, and raised his eyebrows. Harry nodded, understanding his intention, and they slowly made their way through the mass of bodies out towards the exit.
“I love you too.” Harry said also digging into his own plate of food. The two sat there eating for a minute before they both realized that they had just told each other they love each other for the first time. Harry looked up at Draco and saw that his face was a bright red.
“Putting you dating Draco to the side for a moment lets discuss what in the world is going on with you and my sister?” Ron asked putting his plate to the side. Harry filled them in on everything that had happened between Ginny and him. How he came to the burrow one day to find Ginny in her bed with someone else. How they had broken up and that was part of the reason that Harry left on his trip. However, since Dean had dumped her for Seamus, she had been throwing herself at him and apparently other guys too and how she couldn’t take no for an answer.
"Harry...you don't have to." Draco panted grabbing at the sheets below him as he looked down his body at Harry.
“I’m going to assume that that was Professor Potter you were talking with?” Blaise said leaning next to Draco. Things had finely calmed down and all the orders were filled. The club would be closing soon and only a few patrons were left.
“WE ARE NOT DATING! You broke up with me after I found you cheating on me with some random wizard!” Harry shouted before turning and walking toward the Slytherin table with Draco.
"Jump"
“Merlin’s cock Draco your mouth feels so good.” Harry groaned out when Draco started to move his head up and down. Draco gave a little wiggle of his ass to get Harry’s attention back on his rear end. Harry smirked and started to lick and suck at Draco’s pulsing hole. Soon he was three fingers and a tongue deep and Draco was moaning around his cock. Draco let go of Harry’s dick with a pop and gave it a few more licks.
Before long Harry was three fingers deep in a very loud Draco. Harry was thankful he had the forethought to cast a silencing charm.
“Are you alright Harry?” Hermione asked snapping her fingers in front of Harry’s face snapping him out of his thoughts again.
No one saw Harry and Draco for two days. When the two showed up in the Great Hall on the third day Harry had his arm wrapped around Draco's waist.  The bite mark very visible on Draco's neck along with some deep hickeys.  Even the Hufflepuff's could figure out that Draco was an omega, and not just any omega but Harry Potters omega. He secret was no longer a secret and to be honest. Draco couldn't be happier about it.
"Please do." Draco whined trying to push back on to Harry.
“Did we just.” Harry said
“Do you want me to be your blood donor?” Draco moaned as Harry played with his nipple through his shirt.
"I love you." Harry whispered as Draco drifted off to sleep a smile on his gorgeous face. Harry swore to himself that he would say it again once they were awake and fall asleep well.
No, no no no no NO!! No one was supposed to find out. Especially not Potter! Why oh why did Potter have to be the one to find him.
“You can call me Harry then. Would you like some tea?” Harry asked walking over to what seemed to be a makeshift kitchen of sorts.
"I don't see why not." Malfoy said grabbing Harry's hand off his knee and holding it. As they made their way out, they heard more coughing and a 'Really Ron grow up' from Hermione before exiting the pub. After walking a few feet away Harry suddenly pulled Malfoy close and apparated them away, when Draco regained his senses, he saw they were in front of an old looking building.
“Yes! You have. You tease me so much about what you will do to me in your playroom, but I have yet to see said playroom. I was starting to worry that you didn’t want to take that step with me.”  Draco pouted hugging Harry and resting his head on Harry’s shoulders.
“Don’t worry, you get used to it.” Harry said pulling Draco closer and wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist. Harry led Draco over to the Slytherin table. Harry started to grab some things and place it in a bag he conjured up.
"Is that right...still doesn't explain why you’re talking to me." Draco says turning to look at Harry's amazing green eyes.
"You look good enough to eat." Harry moaned biting Draco's collarbone making yet another mark on the pale skin.
“Ginny let go! I’m going to go seat with my boyfriend.” Harry said yanking his arm away and wrapping it around Draco’s waist.
Hearing his first name come from Harry's mouth sent shivers down Draco's spin. Suddenly the door slammed open, making both men jump. A cackling laugh could be heard before fading down the hall.
“Thank you. I’m going to go see how Draco is doing with his friends, lets hang out later.” Harry excitedly said getting up and heading to the Slytherin table.
“Hmm maybe we should have stayed in my office then.” Harry teased pulling away from Draco. Draco almost whined with need. Harry flipped Draco over, so he was on his back, the sight of Draco laying naked on his bed, his face flushed with want made Harry’s dick twitch.
“I know, but I want to show you how I’ll take care of you after I pleasure you so much you pass out.” Harry kissing the side of Draco’s head. Draco snuggled into Harry’s neck and smiled to himself.
“Your so fucking tight Draco.” Harry groaned grabbing the back of Draco’s neck and pushing him down tell his head was on the bed. He was able to go so much deeper in the new position.
“I would love to be your boyfriend Harry.” Draco whispered looking deep into Harry’s eyes. Harry gave a huge smile and kissed Draco again slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth making the pale boy moan.  Draco pushed Harry off him and got onto his hands and knee’s giving Harry a wonderful view.
“You would then…turn me around and have me kneel in front of you and suck your co…. your cock tell you would cum deep in my throat!” Draco groaned pushing his ass up to give Harry more access.
Inside, Draco was experiencing a vague sort of panic attack, the kind that caused his belly to clench up in wrenching pain and his heart to race and his fingers to tingle horribly. Outside, he forced an appearance of calm, with slow deep breaths and sarcastic words. “Well, I am glad to know that our Dashing Hero remains among the living. But, why has he sent me his Will?”
“You’re pretentious.” Harry replied.
Draco looked at him sideways, irritation mounting and tempting him to say all kinds of stupid things. “And just how would you feel if your lover spilled all of your most intimate moments and secrets, put them on display for the world to see.”
Evan gave him a sideways glance. “I like you.”
“There’s something I wanted to talk to you about anyway.” Potter opened the gate. “Why don’t you come in, we’ll take Teddy out into the garden where we can talk.”
“I think I can manage that.” Jude smiled.
When Malfoy wrapped his hands around the styrofoam cup, Harry said, “Just tell me what you can.”
Draco scooted again and fell off the bed. “I won’t help you,” he said again, louder this time, with more conviction.
Draco carefully chewed and swallowed and then took a long sip of his tea, savoring the heat. “That would be a private conversation between Thomas and me. If he would prefer not to tell anyone else, it’s certainly not my place to do so.” He took another sip.
A muggle bar meant muggle money, and if Draco gathered his things quickly he could just make it to Gringotts to exchange his galleons before they closed.
But, if they were about to be overrun by angry, renegade werewolves, they’d need every tool at their disposal.
Draco put his phone on the counter and flicked it. He watched it spin around and around and around, and then smacked his hand down. “I don’t know.” He picked it up and unlocked it. “I need to talk to my therapist.”
“You seem nervous,” Jude said.
“Uh, Jack, I guess?”
They stopped at a shop and bought some sandwiches. “It’s been a long time since I ate outside the canteen or Diagon Alley.” Harry admitted as they walked back to the apparition point. “I’d forgotten how nice it is.”
“Of course you can.” Hermione insisted.
“A few months.” She whipped up foam for a latte.
Which left Harry lying in the bed with come on his hand. “I’m not doing that.” And then, because Harry really didn’t want to think about sex with anyone any more, he got up to wash his hands.
Harry moved to look at the picture. Draco stood at the bar, waiting to order something, a moment of stillness in a picture full of movement. Ginny tapped the picture. “I mean, maybe it’s a smudge, maybe he’s got one of those muggle tattoos. Jude’s talked about that before. But he really does look like Malfoy.”
“I’ve never eaten any of this,” he said at last. “I’m not very hungry. You should just pick for yourself.”
And Harry felt like he was watching the whole scene from the overhead lamp, too bright and from the wrong angle. He crashed back into his body when Ron clapped him on the arm. “Robards wanted me to tell you that your report could wait until Monday, no need to go into the office over the weekend.”
Then Draco was gone, and Tilly was standing there piercing him with an angry gaze. “Leave him alone, yeah? He doesn’t need this shit again.”
And suddenly every single one of those people looked at Draco, stared actually as if they were some new form of entertainment, and Draco didn’t know if he should say something or just walk away.
“You’re not evil,” Roxi said matter of factly from the doorway. Her voice was loud and cut through the room and all those furious thoughts chasing circles in Draco’s head. And Draco froze in the bed. All his attention suddenly trained on her as she stood tall and fierce in the doorway. His eyes were big and he trembled underneath Harry.
Out in the living room, Malfoy was piling up the files, the joggers having slipped low over his arse, giving Harry a sneak peak he hadn’t wanted but his cock seemed to be enjoying regardless. He really needed to get laid if Malfoy’s scrawny arse was looking good. When was the last time Harry had pulled? It was a bad sign if he couldn’t remember.
Harry didn’t smile, but he wanted to.
“Yes,” Draco smiled grimly, “because pureblood children have such a problem socializing.”
“Oh god,” Draco moaned and flopped back on his bed. “What happened?”
Draco leaned back and rode Harry’s thigh thinking only about how it felt good. It didn’t dawn on him the effect it was having on him or on Harry until Harry breathed out a ragged, “fuck,” and tilted his head back as if in the throes of ecstasy.
“He needs stitches, and a tetanus shot and maybe some antibiotics.” She pulled out a needle and thread, iodine, hand sanitizer and gloves. Harry’s vision was starting to go a bit grey at the edges, and he seemed caught in reliving that moment, in turning around and seeing the blood.
“Shall we go for a leisurely ride?” Draco asked when the conversation lulled. “It’s been ages since I’ve been on a broom.”
Luc threw the journals onto the table and began to shout an angry judgemental litany of all the ways that Draco was fucked up. “Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec toi? Prendre un amant quand vous en avez déjà un!”
Eventually, Harry couldn’t wait any longer and went to the club early. It was a good choice.
“I doubt American reporters go into great detail about the numerous squablings of the Minister’s undersecretaries.”
Harry stopped breathing for a moment. He was perfect, with the blue tips in his hair and the light grey suit more suited for summer weather then early spring, but absolutely perfect on him. And a warm feeling fluttered through Harry’s stomach, spread out through his limbs, softened the harsh lines of his face. He smiled, so softly.
“And how, exactly, do you suggest I do that?” Harry spat back. “Not like I can exactly bring someone back here.”
Maybe that’s what Jude was doing this afternoon? Maybe he’d drag the radio out, crack open a beer? That sounded like a nice afternoon to Harry. Not much talking, getting into the dirt and working hard. Maybe hard enough he wouldn’t be able to think. That’d be nice.
“Wait, let me get this straight. You’re not just rich, but the disgustingly rich kind that can just write a check and buy a building?” Sophie stared at Draco. “And you aren’t going to buy one in Monaco or the Maldives or Mallorca?”
He passed by Josephine’s desk where she was settling herself back into her chair. “Room 5, Mr. Potter.”
“Yeah, yeah, that’s a good idea.” Jude nodded fiercely, his arms tightening around Sarah.
Tilly closed the drawer and walked around the counter to hug Draco. “You got out of it, don’t let him pull you back in.”
Mama Gigi was smiling something just a little bit wicked, and Harry suddenly understood just why Draco liked this chaotic house.
Val frowned, deep lines around her mouth, and Harry realized he was still covered in blood. “An audience with Shacklebolt.”
Jenkins paused before she answered. “Have you traced his phone?”
For a long moment, Pansy didn’t answer. She slowly looked Harry over and just as slowly looked over Atkinson, who seemed to bare her scrutiny with mild amusement. Or perhaps he was just admiring the view. “I think it will be necessary,” she said at long last. “Not because I intend to lie, but because I don’t think you will believe the truth.”
Harry wiggled his fingers. “Accio,” he whispered and his wand slipped across the floor to his hand.
party. Nobody there’s got any money. We won’t even be there that long. One hour and you can come back here and crash on your mattress.”
“Don’t wear that striped shirt, it doesn’t go with your skin tone.” Malfoy drawled just as Harry reached for the striped shirt. “Wear that green jumper. Brings out your eyes, and those pants with the hole in the knee.
“Well,” Draco took a deep breath. “When the sun goes down tonight, I am going to change into a wolf, that’s what a Werewolf is. We call it shifting, and it happens every full moon.”
“Just Malfoy is all. Whiskey sour if you could.”
He had lube in the room right? Did girls need lube?
Here we are guys! I will be posting the last chapter and the epilogue next week, we are almost at the end!
“I want to find Sarah,” he said.
Malfoy nodded stiffly, but didn’t move.
Harry nodded. “Did he get any threats? Did you notice any odd behavior lately?”
Faye laughed, spitting her drink across the table. “Seriously? 150? They think we represent a third of the entire population?”
Harry woke up because the bed next to him was empty. It was still warm, so Draco couldn’t have been gone long, and Harry lay quietly in the dark flat and listened for any sound of him. And there, he could hear Draco in the loo; it sounded like he was scrubbing.
“But he needs Pack.” Teddy insisted.
And Draco almost reached out to grab her arm, almost, but stopped his fingers just as they brushed against her skin. “You’re going in?”
In the loo, Harry looked wild, disconcerted, upset. And Draco realized that was partially his fault. One more bad choice, that was it. One more and then he was going to be done with this. These choices lead only to death and madness. And they both deserved better than that.
Harry grabbed his arm. “Don’t.”
Jude walked into the room and flopped down on the bed, dust puffing into the air as he did. “It’s fine. I’ve slept in worse.”
and Robard’s signature.
Draco rubbed his face on his sleeve (not sure exactly what he was trying to scrub off) and began to shove his feet into his trousers. He quickly did up the zip and button, and then looked at the two socks and one shoe. How had it come to this? Draco sat down on the dirty pavement and pulled on the socks. “Duplo.” He whispered quietly and waved his wand at his shoe to make a pair. It was shoddy work, but would last long enough for him to get where he wanted to go.
Tilly put her hand over the skull and looked down at where the black ink peeked out from between her fingers. “I know you regret this.”
“A little.” Draco smiled and clutched his mug.
They hadn’t.
Harry nodded and then touched the ring when the owner handed it to him. The metal was cool, but warmed quickly, and Harry liked how the Claddagh was only on one side with some interlocking rings decorating the rest of the band. He liked the weight of it, how solid it felt in his hands. “It’s sturdy.”
Harry watched as the upturned glass filled with smoke, and Draco began to pour various shots into the tumbler. “Why?” Harry asked, eyes fixed on those long hands as they poured and tipped the alcohol.
about it.
Lacy, Marie, Sophie, Mama Gigi, and another sister Harry hadn’t met yet all looked at Draco. And so Harry looked at Hermione for help.
“Oh.”
He walked into the lecture hall to see his twenty students and Ron Weasley seated on his desk. “Descends de mon bureau, Weasley,” Draco barked as he set his things down by the door. “Bonjour.” He greeted the class and began writing on the white board.
“That’s not an answer.” She insisted.
She gave him a stern look, but Draco didn’t reply.
Hermione laid her menu to the side. “Is everything with Trevor okay?”
POTTTTTTTTTTTER! DM
Neil stepped forward. “I know you, Draco. And yeah, you’re the good, sweet, sheltered boy living life in the big city. But deep down,” he poked Draco in the chest, over his heart. “Deep down in here, you’re a little bit wicked too.”
Shacklebolt and Hermione were already seated together at a table in the front. Draco was glad to see the chained chair had been removed; that would not have set a very cooperative mood. The crowd was silent as Faye and Draco made their way to the front of the room, where they would be able to address the members directly. Harry and Vale took seats in the back with the other visitors; none of them would be allowed to speak. At the front, Hermione gave Draco and Faye a hug, and Shacklebolt shook their hands as they took their seats.
Neville, Ron and Harry sat at the canteen table, discussing once again what to do after work. Harry made a passive bid for a quiet evening at the Burrow and failed spectacularly, judging by the twin looks of disgust. But Robards had spent most of the morning shouting questions at Harry over his report on the whole Jude incident, demanding answers about this before unmentioned Sarah, why no one knew anything about her, why Harry hadn’t brought it up after the raid. He’d gotten a right bollocksing over a teenage girl loose in the country with very little control over her magic.
“You’re the one dating Luna.” Ron shook his head heavily and then looked down at his empty glass. “I wish Hermione was here.”
“Always,” Malfoy reiterated, and as Harry focused on it he could feel some sort of tether that pulled him towards Malfoy. “Go.” He gestured again, and Harry briefly considered what he might do if Malfoy were gone when he returned. There was relief at the thought of having his flat to himself again, and if he were still feeling angry, he could always find Malfoy and beat the living daylights out of him. “Wouldn’t be the first time.” Malfoy tried to smirk but it looked more like a grimace, and Harry felt vindicated.
“Just one. He thinks he knows who the thief is, and I am trying to track him down, but all I’ve learned in the last two days is that no one seems to have seen the git in the last four years.”
And then he went back to bed, because that is what happened when a Were took wolfsbane. They felt like shit, like they were being poisoned, which is what wolfsbane was. As Draco lay in bed, for the first time ever, he let himself be angry at Sawyer, for being dead, for leaving him alone again, for having been part of Ajax’s Pack and never needing to take that damned wolfsbane.
“Uh, not exactly.” And the story came spilling out in a bit of a tangle. Harry left out Malfoy’s injuries but did tell her about the fight in the lab.
Harry opened his eyes. “A panic attack?”
“What? With Packs? No.” Val frowned. “Aurors have been dealing with Weres as long as the department’s been around, I’m pretty sure if there was something to know, we already know it.”
They both found their shoes and took the floo to the Leaky. It wasn’t too crowded yet, that would be next weekend, with all the students home from Hogwarts, parents taking them out for treats, letting the older teenagers meet up with friends. But Hannah was behind the bar, and Tom too, and they both waved, calling out happy and loud, “Harry! Ginny! So good to see you!”
Because Ron and Hermione had finally broken down under the pressure of planning and had taken off for Gretna Green over a long weekend. They’d still had a party on their original wedding date at the Burrow, a big sprawling thing that started in the early afternoon and didn’t end until the wee hours the next morning which had been way less stress. Just catering and alcohol and word of mouth invitations.
“I have heard some rumors about our population as well,” Faye said. “There are many things you do not understand about Werewolves. That is why I have come.” She gestured to the dead body again. “We will no longer tolerate your claim to us if you will not treat us as equal. We wish to live in peace either as muggles or as magical, most of us do not care. But we will no longer allow you to treat us as mere dogs to come and go at your beck and call.”
Harry saying his name sent a wave of warmth over him.
Draco felt his face flush, "It, it wasn't a mistake to ask, Harry, I wanted to. If I'm honest, I was worried about being seen leaving your place."
"Me too." Harry replied. "Do you want to get out of here?" After seeing amusement pass over Draco's face, Harry quickly added, "Not for like, sex, necessarily. I'm just getting cold but I don't want to go back inside. Though I do want to have sex with you, I mean, if you want to. That is." The words tumbled out of his mouth like he couldn't keep up with them.
Draco leaned in, "Do what?" When he pulled away, the look in Harry's eyes nearly made his knees buckle. His eyes were dark and focused on Draco's mouth.
Draco pulled the blanket up over his face, and let out a long groan. "Like hell. I don't usually drink that much, well that's not true, but I usually handle it a lot better. I'm sorry, I'm quite embarrassed."
Yeah, absolutely not sure what is going on here! :)
"Really?" Draco asked sarcastically, raising his eyebrows. "You want to dance. With me."
Harry leaned down and kissed him, the taste of smoke overwhelming him and pulling him in. When they finally broke apart, Draco got a good look at Harry.
Draco felt himself going in and out of full consciousness, but when he opened his eyes before falling back to sleep, he saw Harry sitting on a chair next to the couch half asleep.
"Cream and sugar?"
Draco kept giggling but nodded, "Yes, Harry, that'd be nice."
even if all he was doing was picking up pasta and oranges at the market or speaking at some charity event, but Draco didn't mind it all that much anymore. However, Draco was racking his brain for any sort of public notion that Harry might be gay but he couldn't think of anything. He felt even more panicked.
Harry Potter was still a fixture of the Daily Prophet, and Draco reads about him at least twice a week nowadays. He used to mind it, it felt like people would never lose interest in the
Draco gestured to the shots that had been placed in front of him and they each grabbed a glass.
"What's wrong?" Harry asked, noticing Draco's face fall for a moment.
"Harry? Oh, M'sorry, I was just looking for you, and-"
. He hadn't heard Harry call him that in years and it sent a wave of guilt over him.
"I hate vodka," Harry said, with a small smile. "Wanna dance?" Harry left money for the shots on the bar and extended his hand.
He was tall with broad shoulders. He was holding a black jacket, he had a deep maroon t-shirt and black utility pants on. His dark hair looked disheveled and perfect as always.
"I remember that too," Draco wedged himself further in between Harry and the wall. "Pansy and I dated for a little, but", Draco paused, trying to come off casual, "we're both gay." Harry let out an abrupt laugh at that, raising his eyebrows and nodding. "What about you, what's your love life been like these past few years?"
Harry's head shot up, smiling, and Draco looked at the door frame, trying not to look at his nearly naked body.
They had dated for a while, he and Pansy, but they both quickly realized neither of them was attracted to the other- or anyone of the opposite gender, for that matter. And so, they've been roommates since they left Hogwarts. With Draco's father in Azkaban and his mother off somewhere in France, Draco was left to fend for himself. His mother writes occasionally, he misses her, but part of her deal is that she can never return to England and part of Draco's deal is that he cannot leave until he is 25. There aren't too many other restrictions on Draco, he honestly was very lucky and thanks to Potter, he was able to keep his magic. Draco thinks back to that day a lot, Harry testified in his and his mother's favor. He was overly generous with descriptions of Draco and his mother helping Potter and his friends, and Draco still doesn't fully understand why. But he doesn't like to dwell on it.
"I just, I never apologized for, well, everything. My part in everything, I mean. I didn't want to talk about it when we were back at school, especially not to you. And I just, I'm just really, incredibly sorry." Draco's throat felt tight. He didn't want to ruin the mood but he had to say something.
Harry gracefully slid his hand behind Draco's neck and pressed their lips together. Draco pulled away, mostly out of shock, and a worried look flashed over Harry's face, but Draco quickly moved forward and kissed him again.
Not very well-liked, me." Draco let out a long breath that he didn't know he was holding, saying Malfoy with a bit more distaste than he had intended.
"For what?" The look of genuine confusion on Harry's face amazed him a bit.
"Yeah," Harry smiled and then quickly looked down at the mug in front of him, "So, last night-"
"Thank you, yes please." Draco felt like he was possibly being overly polite but this was a first for him. Most blokes he went home with either kicked him out quickly or didn't really want him hanging around so that's what he was used to. Not this, and definitely not this with Harry Potter, it seemed too strange to be real.
"Those just for you?" A low voice came from behind him, Draco's eyes focused on the figure behind him in the mirror and then turned around slowly.
Draco felt good, he had a few gin and tonics with Pansy while he got ready so he felt a little buzzed. Pansy had picked out a flowy white button-down shirt (that Draco had left open to nearly his abdomen), straight-leg black jeans, some silver rings, a matching necklace, and chunky black boots. It was nearly September so Draco could see his own breath but he didn't mind the chill. His favorite feeling was coming out of a bar or a club and have the cool night air hit him hard.
“Before we start, I want to go over somethings with you.” Harry said walking around his desk. He reached into a drawer and grabbed some papers. Draco intuitively knew it was a contract and his breath caught in his throat. He also watched as Harry pulled a velvet box out of a different drawer.
Harry was startled awake by a soft knock to the door he had slept against. He realized that by locking the door he had made it so no other alphas would walk in on Draco but had also locked Draco inside.
“I see someone is finely awake.” Harry teased walking into the room. He had a tray full of food. Draco sat up and smiled at Harry sleepily.
"What's that?"
"Yeah, I'm here. Hold on and I'll undo the lock spell." Harry mumbled running his hands over his face to try and wake up more. He was never a morning person.
“It looks so good on you starlight.” Harry whispered moving Draco’s hair out of the way.
"You could stay...it’s a long way to the Gryffindor tower from here." Draco mumbled against Harry's neck gently kissing it.
"As I was saying, I know it may be difficult returning to the school after all that has happened here. Not many would understand the struggles both of you had to go through. My door is always open if you need to talk. That will be all." McGonagall said dismissing her old students.
“Reality is so much better! It feels so good.” Draco moaned digging his nails into Harry’s shoulders. With each thrust up he was closer and closer to climaxing. He had never felt this good before, Harry’s dick was perfectly hitting all his good spots. Everywhere Harry touched brought new shocks of pleasure that ran through Draco’s whole body.
Harry  glanced at the pale blonde next to him. He hadn't seen Draco since school. He looked paler than before, but it looked good on him. It reminded Harry of the Greek statues he’d seen. He didn't look sick at all . In fact, he looked quite healthy and extremely attractive. His hair reaching down his back now.
"I don’t have a gag reflex." Draco mumbled kissing and sucking the shaft before taking it back into his mouth.
“I want you Master! I want whatever you are willing to give to me, I want to please you!” Draco moaned trying to rub himself against Harry as much as possible. Suddenly Harry disappeared and Draco was left cold and wanting.
“Cum.” Harry ordered turning the vibrators up to the highest level. Draco came with a shout, warm cum shot out of his dick and landed over his stomach and chest, he even felt some land on his chin. Harry turned the vibrators off and gently pulled them out. Draco laid there panting, he let out a soft moan of comfort when Harry unshackled his feet, and his lower body came to rest on the bed beneath him.
"HARRY!" Draco yelled shoving hard on Harry's shoulders, "I do not want to do whatever this is outside against a tree...we can do this in my room on a comfy bed instead." Draco whispered kissing Harry's cheek.
“Go clean yourself.” Harry said, Draco lifted his head and looked at where Harry was pointing. He quickly got up and went into the room. When he was done, he quickly made his way back to the spot and got back down on his knees.
"You have to many cloths on" Harry moaned before literally ripping Draco's boxers off. He sat up a little and looked down at Draco who was panting, lips swollen, red marks littering his neck.
“Yes, so leave it all to me starlight. Now close your eyes and get some sleep because in the morning I’ll be fulfilling one of my many fantasies about you.” Harry teased softly slapping Draco’s round ass. Draco giggled softly. Both men soon gave into sleep and dreamed of what tomorrow morning had in store for them.
"I am an omega father..." Draco sighed handing him the parchment with the test results.
“Everything and more.” Draco sighed letting his head fall back against Harry’s shoulders. He hummed when he felt Harry kissing his neck and shoulders.
“Yes, just wondering why I’m friends with these two.” Draco joked happy that Harry was back by his side.
“Your named after the constellation Draco right,” Draco nodded, “hence the name starlight.” Harry said coming out of the bathroom with a damp cloth. He cleaned off his stomach and Draco’s, as well as his crotch, dried sperm was never fun to deal with.
“Lift your head.” Harry said suddenly surprising Draco. Draco lifted his head; something was put over his eye’s. Harry smirked down at the pale boy kneeling in front of him, blindfolded and clueless of the things that were about to be done to him.
When Draco woke up the next morning Harry was gone in his place was a note that he had gone back to his room and would see Draco at breakfast. Draco sighed and tried to get out of bed to go to his private bathroom only to have his legs give out. He groaned and got up again. He carefully stood on his weak legs and made his way to his bathroom. He took a quick shower before starting his skin care routine. He brushed some hair oil into his hair tell all the knots where out and it was smooth. He then got dressed in some casual clothes as there were no classes today. Once he was ready and he was sure his legs could support him, he made his way to the Great Hall.  Draco thought about what had happened the evening before and smiled. He had been in love with Harry, and last night he was mostly sure that Harry had said he loved him as well, but he was half asleep and might have dreamed it. Draco snapped out of his thoughts as the chatter of voices reached his ears. He was at the Great Hall. He took a deep breath for walking in his eyes instantly looking for Harry. The air in his lungs left his body at what he saw. Ginny Weasley was hanging all over Harry. Kissing his cheek, pressing her breast against his arm. Draco held back tears as he watched Ginny turn Harry’s head and kiss him full on the lips.
Harry leaned down and gently kissed Draco's soft lips twice before flicking his tongue across Draco's bottom lip making the pale blonde shudder. Draco reached up and grabbed the back of Harry's neck and slammed their lips together moaning when Harry's tongue explored his mouth. Harry loved the feeling of Draco's hands running through his hair, pulling slightly whenever Harry flicked at a nipple or nipped at a lip.
"I can't imagine a few small creatures are enough to fill you up." Draco mumbled tilting his head slightly giving Harry a better view of his neck.
“Why’s that?” Blaise asked.
“Well let’s get you some food then.” Harry chuckled standing up and pulling Draco up with him.
".... I've never hated you...I was mad. Mad that you refused my friendship, mad that Weasley became your best friend, mad that you were sorted into Gryffindor and not Slytherin. Mad that we ended up on opposite sides, mad that no matter how hard I tried, how much I told myself not to...I couldn't stop liking you!" Draco yelled grabbing Harry's collar and smashing his lips onto Harry's.
Malfoy’s eyes flicked back to Harry. He crossed his arms, but his voice was less angry when he spoke. “If you can find Ajax, I’m sure you’ll find the others. Hell, one of them may even talk to you, but I doubt it.”
Draco took pity on her. “No, it’s quite a bit higher than that.”
Because that laugh had usually been accompanied by a flash of green light and the death of an innocent.
It progressed in a reasonable and uncomplicated fashion. Some talk around the office about the monthly drinks out at the Leaky, a casual conversation with Ron about the kids, and then Harry was headed home again, actually feeling good.
“Yes,” Draco said with some resignation. “The dreams had been happening for two years at that point. I was accepting of them, but Harry still struggled. He wasn’t very good at,” Draco stopped. “What do you want me to tell you, Weasley? Do you want me to spread all of his secrets out across this table?”
“G’night,” Harry murmured back.
“As I understand it,  Werewolves in their wolf form lack sufficient intelligence to participate in the magical community.” Faye scowled and crossed her arms.
Harry and George stood next to each other for a moment and watched Ron and Val try to rig up a ladder to get the pelt down for a closer inspection. It was a long, spindly thing with the rungs a little too far apart, something transfigured and not quite the right size to make something so tall. But then Val was scrambling up and putting her hands on the pelt, sinking her fingers into the fur and then recoiling a bit before tossing it over her shoulder, and sliding down. Harry tried and failed to repress the shiver of revulsion.
“I was hoping the rumors were exaggerated. Are you sexually harassing porcelain figurines?” Roxi asked incredulously.
If the realization was slow to dawn, the horror was even slower. Harry just stood there and looked at Draco. He looked better then when Harry had first seen him two months ago, although he’d lost all the weight he gained. At least he had showered recently, not covered in grime like the bed, anyway. Streaks of dried blood marked his face and hands, although Harry could see him clearly.
The truth can often be disarming, especially in situations like this, Draco found, and Mr. Greengrass seemed to accept this answer satisfactorily.
“An arrogant son of a bitch?” Harry asked with raised eyebrows. “Determined to undermine my every effort, a cheater with very little respect for the rules, a pisspoor Death Eater?”
“Are you implying you couldn’t do the job?”
And Harry thought of Draco two floors up. That was another option although it still hinged on him convincing Draco to talk to Hermione. Was that likely to be more successful than trying to convince a stranger? And even if Harry could convince Draco, would Hermione even agree to meet with him?
“Draco’s not wearing a shirt,” Teddy said petulantly.
The screaming had stopped, but Draco was still clutching his ears and hiding in the corner by the bedside table. He was trying to breath, trying to remember what his therapist had said about this. It was important to remember, there was advice, techniques, things that could--that could--
“That’s a very sweet offer.” She smiled, waved her wand, and all the dishes floated into the kitchen, completely ruining Harry’s plan of carrying them one at a time.
She pulled her hand back to smooth down her dress as she looked around the tea parlour. “I’ve come to rather enjoy our visits here.”
“The Hospital. But Grace, I can’t heal these people, I don’t have that kind of control.” Draco looked at her honey hair and heard the call of the storm again.
“Hmm.” Draco didn’t have much of an opinion on that. He’d not spent much time in magical kitchens.
Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry to steady him. “You look like shit.”
And she had looked down at the table and said, “Harry will be disappointed that he didn’t get to at least say hello.”
“Well, it’s a case. Val says you’re a potioneer?”
“So, Ajax is the Alpha,” Harry said, after a few minutes of eating. “What is he like?”
Heroine took another deep breath. “No one wants to put Sarah at risk, but we also need to catch Greyback. Sarah may have information that is helpful, all Robards wants right now is to talk.” She turned her calm gaze from Harry to Sarah. “If you are feeling up to it now, that is.”
Draco gave the turntable a soft smile. “Yes, I feel that Floyd understands what it’s like to live inside my head.” He turned back to Granger. “If you are going to stay, I will set another place at the table.”
Harry shrugged and avoided the question by taking a drink. Draco put his glass on the bar behind him and looked out at the dance floor again, envious of the people lost in their moments there. The loud beat, the crush of bodies, the sway and grind, slow and delicious, fast and hard, removed from everyday life. A perfect sort of utopia.
He howled for the hunt.
At the apartment, Malfoy was standing in the kitchen, still dressed in the joggers and no shirt. He was awkwardly holding the skillet and looking somewhat dazed at Harry. “I was trying to make you dinner.”
“It’s just this case.” Harry couldn’t look her in the eye when he said it.
“You could stay too,” Harry pointed out.
Malfoy’s voice was soft, considered, as he started on the tale. “In the land that is now Rome, two brothers were raised in the wild. They were twins, the same age, and spent their days running wild as their father was dead and their mother too busy with the running of the farm to worry about them. They spent their days hunting for wild figs and cherries to gorge upon.”
“Don’t even think about it,” she said in a cold voice. “I’m not fixing you up just to have you mess yourself up all over again.”
“Two months,” Ginny answered for him, and Harry was grateful because he couldn’t remember all the things Malfoy had said when she’d been at the flat.
And Draco looked down at where he’d rolled up his sleeves in the heat of the room, at the skull and snake twining their way up his forearm, on display here for everyone to see. His hand shook as he reached to roll the sleeve back down, to hide that Mark of Shame away.
Harry quickly glanced around the table and saw open hostility on many of the faces at that word, and after this morning, Harry really couldn’t blame them.
Draco watched Harry kick at the brick and remembered his options. He didn’t have to do this, he could go back inside and tell Tilly it was Harry, and Tilly would come out here and frighten him off. Of course, there was the risk that Harry wouldn’t be frightened off by Tilly. Draco could just go inside and leave Harry to whatever messed up moment he was having, but there was the risk that Harry would just find the courage to come inside.
Harry nodded again because what else could he do.
“You were miserable there.”
“Just after six.”
Ron watched him panic for a minute, and then asked softly. “Well, do you love him?”
She rolled her eyes. “Tolerance levels to the wolfsbane, makes the drinker quite sick, and the potion has to be tailored to the drinker. Most people don’t enjoy watching someone die, and it’s impossible to know just how someone will react to the potion until they drink it.”
Harry tried to fight down a roll of nausea at the sight. “Scan it quick so we can get it out of here.”
“Yes, well, she was deemed the Unspeakable most able to assist me. There might be others with more potion skills or even perhaps more knowledge of muggle technology, but none with both of those.”
“He’s been busy with work.” Harry turned back to the sink to wash his dishes the muggle way, because now when he did dishes he always did them that way.
Then, standing in the middle of the Auror department, Harry wrapped his fingers around his thumb and thought of Draco. He thought of Draco standing by the glass in his apartment, thought of him laughing at the bar, thought of him that night in his bed slicking himself up. He thought of Draco showing him the car and the way the magic pooled like gold and glittered in the light.
Hermione nodded. “I agree. I’ll send an owl when you can get back into the lab.” She stood up, fussed with something in her desk drawer for a moment, and then said, “I’ll take you to the floos.”
“Friends are important.”
Harry ordered his drink and turned back to the room.
All of Draco’s anger came rushing back. “I believe I’ll be going out, Mother. I may not return until late.”
Harry grumbled something incoherent about stupid job duties, but left all the same. He stomped petulantly down the busy aisle with other aurors carrying their tea and coffee and complaining about the Prophet or whatever happened over the weekend. None of them had to deal with a pubescent Were, and were clearly unaware of how good their Monday morning was.
“I don’t know.” Harry shrugged. “I just ask. Why? Do you have a line?”
“So you’ll just, what, not have sex?”
And Malfoy.
“Oh my god!” Hermione shouted suddenly. “Dancing! We should go dancing!” She shook Ron in her excitement.
“Well, that’s good.” Tilly grabbed a clean glass for a pint.
Harry didn’t say anything for what felt like a long moment. “I know, and I promise you we are going to find her.” He sucked in a slow, deep breath and added it for the tenth time to his mental to do list. It was a frustrating case, like so many of the ones assigned to him recently. Cold cases, routine thefts, vandalism. Sure, it was important that someone go out and speak with the dodgy shop owners and dawdy old ladies, but sometimes Harry got tired of gritting his teeth and biting back the urge to smack someone upside the head.
“Where’s he from?”
“Trying to kill me, Potter?” Malfoy tried to joke, but it fell flat.
It wasn’t until after Neil stormed out of the room, and a cashier came running out with a handful of towels, that Draco stopped laughing enough to wipe the tears from his cheeks and mutter a breathless, “oh my, please tell me you did that on purpose.”
"God, yes."
"Hey!" Harry begged, pouting, "Quit, I'm trying here!"
leaving
"What do you think?" Draco said, getting up from his seat on Pansy's bed and walking over to the mirror. "Do I look hot?" He admired himself, the earring was dainty and silver and he thought it looked elegant. Draco loved it, it was such a small deviation from his original look but he couldn't stop staring at himself.
"A shower would honestly be great. Also if you have any pain medicine?" Draco said sheepishly, rubbing his forehead.
Harry let out a breathy chuckle and looked at his feet, "I was going to ask if you wanted a tour."
"You say 'God' a lot for a Wizard," Draco chuckled and pulled out his pack of cigarettes. "Want one?"
"It is, it's my favorite drink," Draco said.
Draco and Harry had been at this little game for a couple of years now. At first, he'd see Harry at a pub with Ron and Hermione and would avoid that pub for a while. Then he started to see Harry at the bars and pubs he was at to avoid Harry, and Draco started to put it together. Harry was seeking him out. Then Draco started to seek Harry out. And he really started noticing how fit Harry was, how much taller he was, how handsome he was. They'd only spoken a few times, drunkenly ran into each other many times, nothing serious, but Draco wanted more. He craved it, but he never really knew how to go about it.
"Yea," Draco said, still chuckling quietly. "I just- inappropriate?" He laughed again. "We were just making out on your couch, Potter. S'not that ridiculous of a suggestion." Draco revelled in the face Harry made at that, he blushed and wouldn't meet Draco's eyes. Draco felt himself sway and a wave of lightheadedness knocked him out of his stupor, "I think, I think don't feel too well." Draco suddenly felt faint, his knees buckling slightly but Harry quickly wrapped his arms around his waist to support his full weight.
"Do you want to spend the night?" Harry asked between the kisses Draco was peppering him with. The hope in his eyes was apparent and it made Draco sort of nervous. Now that he thought about it, he had not planned for any of this- talking to Harry, or snogging him, but most of all, Draco did not plan on being in his home at 3 am on a Sunday. His heart started to race as he began to look objectively at the situation he was in. There was no way he should stay the night, right? If anyone were to see
“His here! Professor Harry is here at the bar and he saw me! He fucking saw me dressed like this!” Draco said tears welling up in his eyes.
"Just go away....please." Malfoy whimpered feeling slick cover his thighs. Harry's scent started to fill his nose and he whimpered again. Had Potter always smelt this good? His mind was getting weaker and weaker and all he could think about was an alpha taking him. Filling him. Marking him. He grabbed at the back of his neck and shuddered.
Minutes ticked by and the two boys stayed where they were. Harry's cock and teeth buried into Draco and Draco spread out beneath him taking it all.
"You wish." Harry responded kissing Draco and making their marriage official. The two smiled as whoops and howlers could be heard from their friends and family and even some students as they walked back down the aisle, after three years of dating they were finely married and couldn’t wait to be together forever.
“Harry and I talked yesterday,”
*Time Skip*
“I assure you that is not what I was thinking about.” Harry grumbled trying to pull his arm away. Ginny had been trying to get back with Harry ever since her and Dean had broken up and he started to date Seamus. Harry was not interested, and to top it off the smell of her blood made him gag, but that didn’t stop her from throwing herself at him any chance she got (A/N: I’m sorry to all the Ginny fans out there).
"I'm sorry what was that?” Draco asked looking at Harry with shock. Did he just say he found Draco attractive? Draco must be dreaming, or this was some cruel joke to get back at him for all those years at school.
“So do I.” Draco said softly looking into Harry’s amazing green eyes. The shrill whistle of the tea pot made both men jump. Draco quickly turned and removed the pot from the heat. He felt the warmth of Harry’s body move away as he continued to get things ready. He brought the new pot of tea over and poured it. He quickly got Harry’s cup ready remembering exactly how he prepared it.
“The world is ending…Draco Malfoy apologized for being an ass.” Ron mumbled watching the blonde sit down with his friends.
“Damn straight you are.” Harry said gently taking off Draco’s new collar and safely putting it on the counter. Together they got into the shower. Afterward Harry ran a bubble bath and the two soaked in the tub.
“Put your hair in a high ponytail, from now on whenever we have a session, I want your hair up in a ponytail, nod if you understand.” Harry said watching Draco put his hair up.  Draco nodded his head when he was done putting his hair up. Harry stood up and walked out of Draco’s line of sight.
"I know a way." Draco giggled, his cheeks bright red.
“You’ve become so sensitive.” Harry said as he walked over to the table. Draco could hear him moving things around, the excitement of not knowing what would happen to him heightened everything for Draco. His ears strained to hear Harry, to try and see if he could get any clues as to what Harry planned. Draco jumped when he felt Harry’s fingers massage at his hole.
“Mind? Thank you so much! It looks amazing in here!” Harry said excitedly coming over and giving Draco a hug. Draco could feel his face turn a bright red as Harry’s scent invaded his mind.
A creak was heard, and the door slowly opened. Draco looking the worse he had ever looked hesitantly stepped out staring at the floor. Harry pulled his invisible cloak out and wrapped it around Draco.
"Be mine Draco! Let me be the only one to feel this amazing hole.” Harry whispered bending over Draco to reach his ear. Draco turned and kissed Harry deeply, “Took you long enough.” He whispered back.
“I love you so much!” He said sitting back up and digging into the food.
“Can you see my cock disappear into your slutty hole? Look at how easy my cock slides into your hole. This hole is for me only understand. Who do you belong to?” Harry asked grabbing Draco’s jaw and forcing him to look at where they were connected. Draco watched as Harry’s dick slid in and out of him, he watched as his hole swallowed Harry dick whole. Harry suddenly pulled out making Draco whine with want.
“Just spend the night here.” Harry sighed twisting Draco’s hair around his fingertips.
"Are you...are you humping me?"
“I believe so.” Draco said finishing his now cold tea. He looked at his watch and realized that they had been talking for an hour.
“You have no idea how much that pleases me love. Knowing that you had this in you the whole time you were on your way here, knowing that you were thinking about my hard cocking ramming into you as well makes me so happy. Tell me my starlight what did I do in your fantasies?” Harry hummed kissing one of Draco’s cheeks, while twisting the anal plug.
“Come in.” A deep voice said, it was the kind of voice that sent shivers down Draco’s back. He slowly opened the door, inside was an office type looking room shelves of books lined most of the walls, a couch was off to Draco’s left with a small coffee table in front of it.  At the back of the room was a nice handmade desk that faced the door. It was the person behind it that had Draco’s attention though. Professor Potter sat behind his desk. He was the talk of the school; he had just started at the school and was, to date, the youngest professor there. Draco could see now why all the girls that took his class gushed about him nonstop. He had messy dark brown almost black hair. It looked as if he just rolled out of bed ran his fingers through it and called it good. His tan skin was highlighted by the light on his desk. Draco couldn’t be sure, but he thought he saw a faint scar on Harry’s forehead.
“Fucking hell Harry.” Draco moaned his eyes filling with lust as he watched Harry lick and suck on his dick.
“Yes, I want it!” Draco groaned turning his head to look at Harry over his shoulder. Who knew that Harry I was such a tease?
“Draco, I don’t care about any of that.  I know that deep down you didn’t want to do any of the things that you were made to do and that you were just protecting your family.  Why do you think I spoke at your hearing? Cause I know deep down you are a good person.” Harry whispered turning Draco’s face towards him. Harry gently kissed Draco when he pulled back Draco was staring at him with wide eyes.
"Yes, please fuck me with your dick. Fuck me tell all I can think about is your cock!" Draco yelled shacking his hips to try and tempt Harry. It worked, before he could say anything else Harry was pushing into him. He yelled out in pleasure, Harry was bigger than he thought, he could feel himself stretching to accommodate him.
Draco was speechless, he propped himself up on his elbows and looked down at Harry with pupils blown wide with arousal. Harry grabbed the back of Draco's thighs and pushed them up and out. Spreading Draco open so he could look at his wet hole. He smirked at how much slick was dripping out. He gave a quick kitten lick teasing the hole. Draco moaned loudly clawing at the bed sheets, his heat in full force. Harry licked and sucked at the twitching hole loving the sounds he was pulling from Draco.
“I do have to say Harry filled out quite nicely. I wouldn’t mind having a bit of fun in the sheets with him.” Blaise said looking over at Harry who was still talking to his friends, “Of course you can join us Draco.” Blaise said winking at Draco who just looked away used to Blaise’s antics.
“LOOK AT ME!” Harry ordered, pleased when Draco’s eye’s snapped open to meet his. He continued to thrust in and out of Draco, watching every wave of pleasure wash over Draco’s face. Harry leaned forward tell their foreheads met, their breath mingling together.
“You…oh goodness that feels good! You bent me over your desk and played with my hole tell I begged for you…fuck…for your cock and then you would...” Draco trailed off he couldn’t think, the things Harry’s fingers were doing to him was driving him crazy with want.
“Yes.”
"Do nnnnnnnhhhhhh do it aaaahhhh do it inside. Cum inside me!" Draco yelled wrapping his legs and arms around Harry. He ran his hands down Harry's back leaving scratch marks.
“Your aha haaha ah going so nnnn ha ah a deeeeeppp.” Draco moaned out, drool slipping out of his mouth. Harry thrusted harder into Draco wanting to go as deep as possible.
“Draco!?” Harry asked surprised. He looked Draco up and down and had to admit he liked what he saw.
Draco hurried down the hall as fast as he could. He couldn’t believe he slept in. He shouldn’t have gone out with Blaise last night. He should have stayed home and made sure everything was ready. Once Draco reached the right room, he paused for a second and made sure he had everything, and his appearance was okay. No reason to be late and look bad. Once he was sure that he looked alright he knocked on the door.
"Let’s be honest though I was a cocky little shit in school though!"
"Friends."
“I’m sorry but I need to go, I’m going to be late for my other job! Thank you so much for this opportunity! I look forward to working with you!” Draco said gathering his bag and standing up, “Here is my number, call me when you need me otherwise, I’ll be in at the set times!” Draco said handing a card to Harry and walking out, what was with him being late today?
“YOU I BELONG TO YOU NOW PLEASE FUCK ME!” Draco yelled out grabbing his legs and holding them open. Harry smirked and slammed into Draco’s tight hole all at once. Draco yelled out as he suddenly came all over his chest, some landing on his face. Harry moved Draco’s legs to wrap around his hips. He grabbed a fist full of Draco’s hair forcing Draco to tilt his head to the side so Harry had perfect access to Draco’s neck.
“You’re such a slut for my cock, aren’t you?” Harry sighed rubbing his tip against Draco’s hole.
Harry stood there shocked. Draco Malfoy wanted to help him by becoming a blood donor, had secretly had a crush on him for years, and was currently kissing him. Hell must be freezing over, he must have died, and this was heaven, the world must be ending because there was no way that this was really happening.
“Why wouldn’t we be? I mean speaking frankly Harry is a good catch, he has money, status, and from how your grimaced when you sat down, he is great in bed.” Pansy absently said taking a drink of her orange juice.  Draco blushed and looked down at his half-eaten food.
“Would you like more tea? Maybe some more sweets? You seem to like them quite a bit.” Harry said glancing down at the small pile of wrappers in Draco’s lap.
“Fucking hell Harry! I don’t know how much longer I can last.” Draco moaned out rubbing Harry’s dick with his hand.  Harry turned Draco around and slammed his mouth onto Draco’s forcibly shoving his tongue into Draco’s mouth.  Harry lined himself up before slamming all the way into Draco’s tight hole.
“You look so pretty bouncing on my cock love. Tell me is reality better than fantasy?” Harry panted moving Draco’s hair out of the way so he could lick and suck at Draco’s neck.
Harry was in bliss, but he didn't want to be the only one. He grabbed Draco's ass cheeks and spread them so he could see the tight pink hole that was twitching cutely.
