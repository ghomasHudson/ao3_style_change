“Faction is an odd descriptor, I realize.”
The sink water runs unchecked.
—and Harry fixes, because Harry is familiar with fixing.
“Surely they can do without you?”
“No, the worst is...I’ll give all I have. I’ve already decided that.”
“Did it work?”
“When did you get so—”
is what she means—overflowing. “Well, yes.”
“Strange,” Malfoy repeats, slowly.
Harry averts his eyes—the grey too sincere; far too overwhelming.
It’s a practical luxury, Harry thinks, to own the Muggle car. Something he associates with leaving, with getting out, with being able to go. Without a thought or plan. He sometimes works himself into such a knot, pulled so tight, that he gets in and just goes—all the way out of the city. Stops in the country, where the sky and the land are two wide, unbroken bands. Sits down in wet grass and breathes.
“You’re—afraid of cars?”
Harry finds he hasn’t considered the possibility of it not being exclusive—for himself, at least. “We haven’t spoken of it...in explicit terms, I suppose.”
The interior of the house is grimy ruins. The imprint of what was furniture, what was colored and alive, blown into ash, piled up, disenfranchised from the living. Harry follows the others, trainers turning black in the wreck.
“No, just—new.”
“Oh,” Harry laughs, nervously, rubbing a hand over his neck. “That’s Pansy, actually.”
And Draco, saying calmly, “I don’t mean to make you feel badly about yourself. It was an average sleep. I’m not better rested than yesterday or the day before.”
“I was in an empty warehouse, with an empty canvas and a bucket of paint. Blue paint. I spread it all out with my hands. My back hurt horribly. I stood back and saw a sky. And you were in there, sort of...I saw your face, but it was—different. It was barely you.”
“It can be fixed,” Ezra says, quietly. “It’s better than death.”
The Black magic had been mean. Resistant; loathe for interference. But Harry had two hands, one death, a lifetime of persistence. Stubbornness borne of necessity. He bled the histories of the home, bled them of all their malice, till they ran deep blue; till he found a cleaner magic.
the unfixed
There’s nothing to fix, here. It’s the stuff of his head: Trying to fix, and failing. He gasps himself from sleep.

“Fine.” Harry knows he sounds a bit like a child. But he feels like a child. Vulnerable; on the brink. The feeling always returns. “Fine, but I—I can’t guarantee that won’t happen again.”
In the dark of a house already repaired, Draco folds Harry’s hand in his. To look or not to look, that is the—Harry does not look. Is afraid the house will fall on top of them if he does. He can only be a heartbeat; a quick, embarrassing breath.
“Well, my complexion is fair, yes, I’ll give you—”
There are more homes, each of them difficult—a semi-detached house, in the city, magic severed by the death of a child. A barn in the Irish countryside, curses clinging to the rafters. The home of a wandmaker, swollen in useless magic, full of old wood.
“He seems to have trust issues,” he explains, breaking off a piece of blueberry scone. “I mean—I do, too.”
Harry laughs, and it’s just as bitter as it sounds.
Harry lets his magic—reaching for a fix—cut off the water. Turns Draco’s face, finds his wettened cheeks; kisses each pink plane, the swelling mouth in the middle. “Let me see."
“Maybe I’ve seen—all I need to, already.”

“There, I fixed it.”

And Harry kisses Malfoy, then, without a single thought, finger washing clean.
“Potter, you imbecile—” and he’s caught round the shoulder, spun, nearly shoved into an alley between buildings, crisscrossed in telephone lines. Malfoy is etched in something; it pulls at his features, making him severe. Like Malfoy-of-Old. “You’re

“Let me.”
Magic comes to him differently, after death. He feels it like dark colors, now, in little rivers. Perpetual tides, swathing the ground, the air, the body. Different threads of it move uniquely; it’s all feeling.
Let it be an unfixed home.
I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO LOVE IN LIFE.
In the aftermath, Isaac panting with his effort, the faction disperses to repair the fire’s damage, and Draco pulls Harry in by the elbow. Their bodies side-by-side. The ash of the accident under their feet, sticking to their shoes. “Okay?”
“Then fuck you, Potter. Get out.”
Harry shuts off the water and concentrates on the clogged pipes. They creak, groan, and live. “I can’t remember.” And he can’t, not when Malfoy is looking at him like this, backing their bodies into a wall, breathing hard.
"Yes for when I brought the reason why it is called for to Minerva all she said was "Oh, dear," he said before explaining about what he had done in his class before sharing the results of the students. Agustus turned her glare from him to Minerva once she read how her Grandson had been enchanted not only by the Granger girl but according to his form Dumbledore and her nephew Algie.
"No clue," Harry answered with a shrug though he noticed a gleam come to Lavender's eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah sorry about that," Draco said.
Getting sick of the blonde not looking at him Harry placed a body bind on the other so he could no turn away and went to stand before the other. "Alright I get it if it is personal and you don't want to share what helped you produce your Patronus, but I can't help you if you have trouble with it latter if I do not know what you thought of as you cast it," Harry said crossing his arms and almost glaring at the other teen.
"Oh hey-a," George said looking over at them "your secondary father was giving us some pointers in starting our Joke shop. He suggest rather than a large shop on the main street we scale it down to a smaller building with an attached apartment so it will be less likely that our Mum, Ron, or Ginny would find it."
When Harry woke up he found himself looking into an unfamiliar ceiling. Only after sitting up and putting on his glasses did he realize he was in the Hospital Wing. Having never really had a reason to come to the room yet he looked around seeing a very sterile and bland room filled with curtains, beds, and similar side tables. The room's setup reminded him a little of Privat Drive and all the cookie-cutter houses on a street for each bedded area looked exactly like the others in the room. With one exception, the bed right next to Harry was occupied by Draco Malfoy who was sitting up and eating from a tray. "What happened?" Harry asked trying not to blush as he recalled the vision he had experienced and how it had ended with him curled up in Draco's lap.
As is my way when I write a Bashing story that does not involve the entire Weasley family only those characters that I bash are considered Blood Traitors, aka Arthur, Ron, Ginny Weasley.  While the rest of the family are not.  Also, I will be going over Hermione Granger's "Muggle Pretender" status later as well as How Draco found out about it.
"And they would be okay with that?"
"What why?" the twins asked in unison.
"It is alright," Harry said not wanting to make a fuse of it though he was actually slightly proud with what they had said about a possible skill in potions that he possessed. Draco gave him a smile as unaware to Harrison the joy he felt at the news had caused him to unleash some pleased pheromones.
Seeing shadow come from the underbrush and lower its head to the unicorn's neck to drink from the wound Draco could not help but let out a terrified scream. Turning on his heel Draco took off after Fang. "What the hell was that Potter?" Draco asked turning from the great boarhound retreating backside to look at Potter, only to see that the other boy was not there. "Oh hell, don't tell me," Draco said casting a look over his shoulder expecting to see the Gryffindor trying to battle against the shadow. Once more the blonde found himself to be mistaken as he sees Harry curled up before the approaching shadowy figure, his hands clutching his head as if in pain. While Draco hated that Harry had spurned his friendship in favor of the Blood Traitor Weasely, he could not let the shadow reach the B0y-Who-Lived. "Alright Draco, it is no big deal just some random dark shadow who had killed a Unicorn and is about to reach Potter," Draco said trying to psych himself up. "Probably going to die or get hurt, assuredly get dirty, but people will know I did it to save Potter after he was abandoned by that bloody groundskeeper."
After Harry had finished reading the medical form he was both a little angry and confused. His anger stemmed from the fact that he had been enchanted to actually form a relationship with his so-called friends. He was a little confused on why he was meant to be loyal to Ron's dad having never met the man before. Reading about the Mail Ward did make some actual sense to him as he recalled in his youth strange people, he now guessed were Magicals, coming up to greet him yet he had never received a single letter from anyone even at Hogwarts. "Can I assume that you got rid of everything on this list?" Harry asked as he could still recall the words the form stated he was to magically forget.
Less than ten minutes later the group saw the doors to the castle open as Professor Dumbledore, the four Heads of House, and Madam Pomfrey rushed over the grounds to met them. "Hagrid what has happened?" Dumbledore asked as the group of staff reached them.
As soon as Tumbus left the dining room to pass on the message to the other Potter Elves who might work for his family but not at Even's Haven, Harrison turned to the two Hogwarts Professors. "I guess I should warn you that besides blocking my mail and doing his best to leave the Dursleys, Dobby did pass on a warning that something bad was going to happen at Hogwarts this year," Harrison said.
"I thought you would never ask," a voice said from the side making Harridan jump as he looked over and seeing the Goblin from before. "Just to let you know Heir Potter-Prince we have already gotten the funds taken by the Goblin Griphook back as well as sent him to a life sentence working in the mines. We will start working on getting the rest back right away," the Goblin said with a bow.
"Thank you Draco," Harry said and hugged the other laying his head on the Alpha's shoulder.
"Check the last line again Potter," Draco said in an annoyed voice as he speared a breakfast sausage link with his fork. Harry did as requested seeing the page mentioned that the body of the shared man had been found by Harry Potter and several students who had been in the forest to serve detention.
As his mom seemed to have used her personal office fireplace to set up the Floo connection she and Draco heard a scream coming from the Ward where she worked. Mentally crossing her fingers in the hope the scream was due to what she thought it was she and Draco ran towards the Ward. With each step, he took closer to where he had last seen Harry and his mom before she had shown up at Hogwarts the unnatural feeling in his chest seemed to lessen. "Healer Malfoy thank Merlin you are back it is a miracle, Harry just sat up in bed fully awake," one of the Healers said as Draco and his mother entered the room.
"Then no I have not," Harry said making both Draco and his father let out some chuckles which surprised Harry as they were light-hearted rather teasing.
"Well, we found the unicorn, but also who had been doing it. Something happened which caused you to pass out but everything worked out. Oh, and you made the paper again Potter," Draco said passing over an issue of the Morning Prophet which had a large headline saying, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named Found Alive. Harry quickly perused the article reading bits of it about how the man who had killed his parents had somehow survived after all this time and had been found to have been in either a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with Professor Quirrell. The shared bodied man had been sent to a place called Azkaban to the deepest and most heavily protected cell the place had
"Am I missing something?" Professor Sprout asked.
"Thank you, Blue Jay," Draco said as he leaned down and kissed Harry's forehead which actually woke Harry up.
"I am sorry Draco," Harry said as he snuggled closer to the blond boy a little surprised that he had not called Voldemort the Dark Lord.
"Great to the third degree Uncle Harrison?" Draco asked.
Draco felt like skipping through the halls of his home, but that would be undignified, at least unless he was fully alone. He had recognized the spark he had received from his Heir Ring earlier as the return of his Courtship Bond with Harrison. Granted due to what their relationship had been like last year their bond was not strong enough to sense anything from Harrison only that the bond was back in place. He had shared the news with his folks who had both given him tight hugs and told him they were happy for him. Though he no longer needed to become a Seeker to cleanse Harrison anymore Draco still asked his parents to get him a broom so he could try out as a Chaser at school. His father said he would take care of it had Draco go back to his room to either celebrate or meditate at his leisure.
"Too bad Lucius always had high hopes for you," the unseen speaker stated as the shadow turned from Potter and started to approached Draco.
For the rest of the night, Harry avoided Ron and barely left Draco's side until the Ball finally ended at two in the morning on Boxing Day. Before Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower he was shocked once more as Draco gave him a kiss goodnight. Harry was happy with the kiss that he could not stop smiling as headed back to Gryffindor Tower only to be stopped by Cedric who gave him a clue on how to figure out the Golden Egg he had taken from his Dragon. Thanking his fellow Hogwarts' Champion Harry made his way back to the tower to find that he was not the only one angry at Ron as he walked in on Hermione yelling at his attitude towards her date as well. Hearing her tear him a new one Harry could not help but smirk as he made his way past the pair and headed up to the Fourth Year's bedroom. As he was taking off his dress robes Harry found something in one of his pockets and pulled it out to reveal one of the badges the Slytherins had worn since he had been declared a Champion. But rather the message of "Support Cedric Diggory the True Hogwarts Champion" or "Potter Stinks" the badge now read "Want to go out again?" Pressing the badge Harry saw the choices of "Yes" and "No" pop up. Without hesitation, Harry pressed the badge where the "Yes" was as his badges shifted into a badge resembling a yellow smiling face. Harry pulled the robes he was planning to wear tomorrow and pinned the smiling badge on his right lapel before he climbed into bed to go to sleep. Harry was almost asleep when he realized he still had the broach Draco had attached to his dress robes and decided to give it to the blonde tomorrow.
Rather than answer Draco asked, "What caused you to go through the change?"
"For one thing Hermione," Harry said having to stop himself from calling her Granger due to how annoyed with her he was at the moment," it is not my book to lend. And secondly, as far as I know, you are not in danger of having someone performing Legilimency on you."
If Harridan had found the breakfast that morning a little tense both boys were feeling it now as the time of their friends' visit drew closer. Harridan was so wrapped up that he had already changed into and back from his calico form three times already only shifting back to human after Draco calmed him down with his Allure. Finally, neither boy could take it any more as they sat down on one of the Floo room's couches and cuddled with Harridan in Draco's lap both using their Allure to keep the other calm.
"He is too young for such a thing," Narcissa protested shaking her head.
"You said legal Contracts what about illegal one?" Harry asked,
, Harry found various accounts of how some Magicals went through the change sooner than normal. After reading about an orphan who had found her family after a bad life who had gone through the change he began to think that it had been Sirius' promise to get him away from the Dursleys after he was free that had actually caused him to change. The only issue was that in all personal accounts in the book every single person that had become an Alpha or Omega had come from a Pureblood or from a Third Generation Muggleborn Half-blood line, but from what everyone always told him his Mom was a First Generation Muggleborn meaning he was only in the Second Generation. Getting through the whole book with no further help to explain how he had changed Harry moved on to the second book,
Thinking he would have time to read the book next year Harry skipped to the end to read about Fleamont Potter. It was as he was reading this chapter from the book he saw this edition produced fairly recently for the start of the chapter it made mention of the recent death of Fleamont's son and daughter and had recently died from He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. The way the chapter was written made it seemed as though Harry's grandparents had been alive when his mom and dad had been killed making him wonder why he had been sent to live with the Dursleys after they had died. He found his answer a couple of pages later when it went over the fact due to their already advanced age having been told about their only son's death had sent their heath into a tailspin. The author of the book even venturing that if their Grandson, Harrison, was not found and returned to them they did not think the pair would live that much longer. Harry was amazed to find out his real name was not Harry but Harrison but also the fact that Fleamont was also good at Potions having created a line called Slickeazy Hair tonics as a way to mess with the Potter family's untamable hair.
"Oh, that it was a Muggle jiggle called "I Wish I Was An Oscar Meyer Weiner," Harry whispered back with a slight blush.
"I was informed you wished for an Inheritance Test today is that correct?" Bonecrusher asked.
"Who?" Narcissa asked leading him over to an empty seat far from Harry's bed and the conference between the Healers.
The plan went perfectly as Harridan and Draco exited down a small flight of stairs outside of the backdoor of the compartment and avoided the rest of the students managed to reach the carriages. Thankfully both Luna and the Elder Malfoys informed Harridan that since he had witnessed someone's death he would be able to see the steeds that pulled the carriages so he did not freak out seeing the black skeletal winged-horses. Entering the cabin both boys leaned back so they would not be able to be seen while they looked out for their friends. Soon Theo and Neville joined them having gotten their own attention due to their interactions with each other leading the group of four to head out to the castle. As they approached the front doors they found Professor McGonagall waiting for them. "Harry since you wish to go through a re-sort you will stay out of the hall until the normal sorting is done," Professor McGonagall said in her normal brisk manor. "On a side note I am sorry to see you go, and not just cause I fear  Gryffindor facing off against you in Quidditch," she said with a small chuckle before she pulls him into a quick hug and leads him away. "I will not ask why you feel the need to leave but I do hope you find what you are looking for in your new House."
"But don't I have to give you everything?" Harrison asked finally looking up and seeing all three had tears streaming from their eyes at his stories.
"This is a disgrace," Mr. Malfoy said, "you are rather lucky my wife did not come with you. As a fully registered Healer, she would have torn you a new one. According to this you basically gave my son only a Dreamless Sleep Potion," the man said reaching over and lifting the bedsheet on his son revealing a swollen ankle before he had Draco lift his shirt a little showing off a deep purple bruise. Mr. Malfoy then used a summoning spell to call for some potions and had his son drink them making the bruise shrink a little. A third potion was applied directly to the swollen ankle causing it to return to normal size. "Now based on what you "missed" with my son let's see if you failed to notice anything with Heir Potter," the man said turning his wand on Harry who did his best not to flinch. Harry felt nothing as the spell was cast on him, not even a slight breeze that he had come to associate magic being cast on him. Harry's breakfast arrived before the results of the spell started to print out, but as the results printed Draco, the Matron and Mr. Malfoy's faces fell as they turned pale. "Have you never scanned Heir Potter before?" Mr. Malfoy asked as the results continued to print from his wand.
"I think I would prefer cub to tell the truth," Harrison said.
Rather than going around smelling everyone in the library Draco quickly headed out of the room to spend some time with his friends enjoying the good weather before lunch. After a while, Draco noticed that some students had decided to spend their free time in a pick-up game of Quidditch. Seeing it as a way to take his mind off the new scent he was smelling around the castle; Draco decided to join in the game. Since the game was just for fun Draco was able to play his preferred position, Chaser. Also, since everyone was playing for fun they were not playing their standard teams leading him to, unfortunately, be on the same team as Potter, some Ravenclaw Beaters, Wood from Gryffindor as Keeper, and a Hufflepuff and one of his normal teammates as his fellow Chasers.
Draco teaches Harry about the Magical World.
Inside Malfoy Manor, Draco tried to figure out how to get Harrison to notice him after all he had been told since he had been a young boy that the pair had a Marriage Contract with each other. Yet he had not immediately recognized the other boy when they first met in Madam Malkins with Draco only finding out his identity on the train ride causing him to rush from his compartment only to find Harrison sitting with the Blood Traitor Ronald Weasley. Draco had been sure that even if Harrison had been under enchantments as soon as they touched due to their bond the other boy would be well again only for Harrison to refuse to shake his hand. During a letter to his parents over what had happened his father had suggested that Draco make Harrison angry enough to challenge him to a duel. Draco would then use some Cleansing spells his mother had taught him to fix Harrison right up. Yet when Harrison showed up at the duel rather than have to deal with just the Blood Traitor the Muggle Pretended had arrived. Draco not liking his odds against both the traitor and the pretender, nor having any idea how Heir Longbottom would react Draco and his partner had scampered away.
Harrison guessed that made sense as the three of them walked up the steps to a bright white front door with Lillies painted on it, quite unlike the Muggle townhouses situated around them which all had either black or brown doors. Harrison was told to open the door first since his Rings would be able to unlock it in case the place had been sealed. Feeling a small tingle of magic as he grabbed the nob Harrison heard the lock release letting him open the door to a brightly lit hallway filled with Magical Photos of what he assumed were his parents and their friends. After taking off his shoes he headed down the corridor thinking he would have time to look at the pictures later as he headed to a partially open door at the end beside a set of stairs going up to the second of four levels. Reaching the door he pushed it open revealing a small dining room with a circular wooden table with five chairs pushed in around it. Whoever designed the room made it look like it was outside with light blue paint on the ceiling and halfway down the walls the bottom half of the walls made it look like rolling hills in the distance, and the carpet almost looked like grass. Across the room from the door, he had entered from there was another door that had been painted to look as if it was a tree with a panel that was painted beside it that looked like a cloud. Checking out that door he saw it lead to the kitchen of the place where the two House Elves that were said to live and work were busy cleaning. As if they sensed him both turned as one to look up at him.
"There is nothing about me in this article," Harry said after he finished looking through it.
"Fine since no one else has shown up and it is you we shall start at the beginning," Draco said with his normal sneer "so take out your book and turn to page five."
"Quirrell?" Lucius asked before he seemed to bring himself back into focus. "You don't know much about Veelas do you?"
A half-hour later Harry wished he knew a spell to block the scents that seemed to bombard him from every person he came across, for while some were pleasant others were not. He had to run out of the corridor when he walked past fellow Seeker Cho Chang heading to breakfast as he got a whiff of an overflowing port-a-potty and peppermint. He began to notice that apart from Hermione, and Madam Pomfrey all the females he had come across had scents that made him feel sick to his stomach. Side-stepping around Ron's little sister as she came up to greet him as he came down from changing clothing Harry rushed to the library hoping to find some breathable air in what was most likely an empty room, due to all tests except for O.W.Ls and N.E.W.Ts having been completed.
"Obviously you are not do we need to go see Madam Pomfrey?" Harry asked once more lifting his hand to check the other's forehead only for Draco to catch it and pull it down only to let it go as if touching Harry's flesh caused his to burn. Fearing something like what happened to "Quirrellmort" in his First Year Harry checked Draco's palms to see if he actually had burned the other's flesh, but only saw the smooth flesh of Draco's uninjured palm. "Does this have to do with the memory you used to cast the Patronus?" Harry asked as Draco nodded not looking at him. "Is it a bad memory like recalling a time you bullied someone you felt deserved it?" Harry asked only to get a shake of Draco's head.
"Any reason?  Are you bloody serious Albus?" Vansel asked incredulously. "We have looked over the record Hogwarts keep on its staff showing their work habits. Poppy would start treating any Gryffindor who entered, would wait three minutes for any Hufflepuff, ten for a Ravenclaw, and would either dismiss Slytherin students in general or give them the wrong treatment."
When they moved on to Potions Draco paid him back in kind as he took hold of Harry's hand and gently lead him in his preparations of the ingredients. Harry had the sudden memory of his Aunt doing the same thing to him when he had been younger as she taught him how to cook, so she would never have to. It had been one of the few times his Aunt had been "kind" to him as she had just led him through the motions and only insulted him but never physically attacked him as she taught him. Yet despite the similar antagonist relationship he had with Draco the blonde did not insult him or put him down as he guided Harry through the motions. Hell, he did not even mention the blush, Harry knew he had to have noticed when Draco worked with him on proper stirring techniques. Which felt like the slightly taller boy was giving him a back hug as he had wrapped his muscular arms around Harry and guided the mixing of the Potion. Harry had actually lost track of time as Draco pulled away and said they would pick it up next time. Making Harry realize he was almost late for his meeting with Snape.
"Harrison is fine. I take it you are Draco's Aunt Andromeda?" he asked.
"Your patients? You did not treat my son at all, nor have you really done the job you were hired to do in even collecting his medical history. I will be sharing this instant with the rest of the Board and we will be looking into a full history of your work among the different Houses," Draco's dad said as he used his wand to shrink Harry's school trunk and help him out of bed. "Come along Draco," the man ordered but rather than head to the doors of the room he led them into the Matron's office. "Tell me, Heir Potter, have you ever traveled by Floo before?"
"But why were you with her," Snape asked again.
Harry was feeling weak and hopeless. It had been over a week since his birthday and the unfortunate letter from the Ministry letting the Dursleys know he was not supposed to use magic outside of school. His Uncle had since locked and bolted Harry into his room, and with Hedwig also locked up he could not send a letter to anyone. That plus the blasted House Elf Dobby blocking any letters coming to him he could not even use a return owl to send a message for help from anyone.
Harridan had feared it would include blood due to the Muggle misconception of Vampires but it turned out to be a fudge brownie with bits of bacon and other meat in it.  Harridan was a little worried about the taste but after some gentle prodding from both Draco and Severus to "embrace his Vampire side" he took a bite and actually found that it tasted better than treacle tart.  Licking his lips he ordered a box to take homemaking Draco chuckled and Severus smiling having at finding they shared the like of the taste.  Since Harridan had not actually got his school supplies yet they also picked them up in-store that for once did not make a pun on the Creature status.  After they picked up his new clothes the group headed out of the alley and back to the Manor.  As Harridan was putting his clothes away in the wardrobe that he realized that when Draco had been going through his clothing when he came to the Manor he did not recall seeing his father's Invisibility Cloak.*3  As he knew it was not left at the Dursley's he knew it could only be removed when he got to Grimmauld Place.
"Fine then you can come with me as a friend that way you can attend," Ron said looking at his little sister.
"My family," Harry began.
"So it was them sharing courting dreams, not Lily talking to him that lead to James agreeing to stop Sirius from bulling him in our Fifth-Year," Remus said to himself.
"Yeah, that would do it," Draco said nodding his head. "So your family would really kill you?" Draco asked.
"A pleasure," she said as she let him go causing him to shake his hand for a moment to get some feeling back into it. After his hand felt back to normal again Harry reached into his robes and pulled out Draco's cloak and handed it back to the Alpha thinking it would not be a problem even if Draco left him alone with Luna if she was his cousin, which means she was most likely Sirius's as well and would not give off a bad scent. "Draco, be a dear and see if the library has a book on Harry's family history," Luna said dismissing the blonde Alpha so she could talk to Harry alone.
"Saving it, yeah and I am the king of England," Harry said though made no move to shift Draco's hand off of his.
"Thanks, and you are right food would be good.  Also, my friends are probably freaking out wondering where I am," Harry said.
"My mom would, my dad might do it if I propose it as a wager where if I fail I have to do something he has been wanting me to do for a while," Draco said as he got a far off look in his eyes making Harry wonder if it had anything to do with Voldy.
Having their family clock returned to what it was meant to be Arthur wasted no time in kicking Molly out of the Burrow and all other property that was owned by the Lupin-Weasley as well as adjusting the wards to prevent any of Molly's family or Dumbledore from reentry again.
On the night of the first School Board meeting that the three Founder lines were there to vote at the Deputy Headmistress was surprised to find another additional person there Lord Malfoy. Albus, already seething due to three Founder lines being present, tried to kick Lucius out of the room saying he had lost his spot to be there. Lucius only arched one eyebrow at the man before he began to speak. "I did not come here to vote on any issue but to bring to the Board's attention a show of favoritism to a student."
"Alright what shall we do first?" Harry asked which seemed to shock Draco.
"Earlier this day said client found evidence of his money being embezzled and your account was mentioned," the man said.
"We can make sure Cub has his potion during his meals but neither of us can brew. You would need one of the higher Elves who live at the main properties," Celia said giving the pair of Professors a curtsy in her pink suit and making Bathsheda raise an eyebrow at her.
"Why were you with her?" the man asked.
"Well, sandwiches yes as well as simple foods but something that requires measuring items and mixing is usually only done with Potions in the Magical World," Draco said.
"I made a vow I will do all I can to keep you safe," Draco said finally letting go of Harry's hand and to the brunette's shock bowed low to him so that his forehead was touching the floor.  A few days earlier Harry would have loved to see the sight of Draco bowing before him, but now his Omega was horrified that an Alpha that he had formed a small connection with was acting this way.  Harry pulled Draco to his feet as for the first time stood before him with neither of them wearing shoes to find Draco was just a few inches taller than he was.
Looking around to make sure no one was paying attention he placed his head onto the blonde's shoulder so he could easily whisper into his ear, "she is the last Heir." He then had to giggle a little as his Mate's mouth fell open in shock at the news. Letting Harridan use a finger to lift it back into place.
"Is that what is affecting Harry?" Longbottom asked.
"Strange," Draco said though with a laugh as she shook his head a little.
"They could oust Binns or make sure we never had another teacher like the Umbitch or Lockhart ever again," Pansy said hugging Neville's side surprising the High Elf a little.
"I, unfortunately, do not have a writ for it was sort of spur of the moment decision," Mr. Malfoy said rubbing the back of his neck and blushing slightly.
"Well then I should go on "long-winded speeches more often," Draco teased.
"What do you want?" Harry asked.
"I guess according to the author of the book they did not think my grandparents would find the will to live unless their grandson was brought back to them listing my name as Harrison," Harrison said.
"Whatever shall we do this or not I can leave if you want," Draco said though Harry was pretty sure that was a bluff since the blonde had shared he wanted to get tutored in Defensive spells.
"Oh, a challenge," Luna said rubbing her hands together and causing Draco to gulp a little in fear.
"Lady Magic?" Harry asked.
During the night Draco had become aware of the scent invading his sleep.  At one moment he felt as if someone had raised his covers, but it had to be a dream as something came to snuggle against his form.  But as he took in the scent that had been plaguing him all day Draco opened his arms and wrap around whatever was snuggled up against him.  Feelin content Draco smiled both in his dream and as he held the origin to the scent to his chest, and imagined he heard a small purr come from it.
But Harry is just trying not to stumble on the pavement. “Good—um, hello, Parkinson.”
Harry gets out. Feels himself bracketed to the car in the supermarket car park.
, something like
“What do you define as ‘putting out,’ exactly?” Harry is breathless, eyes glued to the aberration of Malfoy’s conflict, sprawled all over his face—the pained lines, the put-on frown. “We can stop, Malfoy, just let—”
“Confidential?”
Harry knows now to be wary of the sharp edges; to take them slow. So not to run into a Percival-problem, any unnecessary hurt.
A sound comes out of Draco so desperate, like a warning. “Don’t look at me, god. Please don’t look.”
“Yeah?”
“Week ago. You asked me if I changed my hair.”
“You’re—what are you doing, just now?”
The surviving so much like a circle. Time goes; winter closes in. The windows crack with frost. Even in darkness, Draco is full of curved lines; the smoothed-out jaw, long blinking lashes. A sigh in a warm neck.
“How long will you blame yourself,” Harry wonders, tucked into the cut of Draco’s body, a long, full, beautiful thing. His knees are soft. His lips are soft.
Maybe Draco is worked over with something just the same. In the bed, he exhales for a long second. Stares down at their hands. Sighs again.
“I know that better than you.”
They’ve arrived on a quiet side street, and one roof in the middle of the row is blown out, completely.
“How what’s going to be?”
Harry slumps back into the chair and looks off. Wishes desperately for their old school days—not for the terror or the fear, but for Ron’s complete and utter lack of emotional intelligence. A Ron who wouldn’t be nearly so perceptive, wouldn’t harness Harry with a weathered look—the weariness of new-fatherhood, the softness of years in grief and danger—and know him in the simplest way.
Malfoy blinks. “Your body.”
After the Percivals, Malfoy has handled Harry delicately. He sidles back once they’re indoors, tucking into the radio silent sofas and watercolor prints; the floors stained in blood.
Malfoy shakes his head. “You have to do what’s best for yourself.”
“You’ve met me, haven’t you?” Malfoy interrupts, yanking up his sleeve, brandishing the old, faded mark.
“Oh, try,” Harry begs.
Runs, and runs.
He drains his drink in three gulps.
“Smarter.”
Beyond Malfoy’s kitchen window, the evening swallows the sky in purple light. Hips not touching, but close enough. “Did Ezra have the idea? Or you?”
Harry scratches at the back of his neck. “Am I...er, hired?”
“And that’s what this is? An end?”
Draco’s cheek, plucked of color. Lips parting stiffly under pale light.
“How’s that?” Ron’s beard is thick, now, over cheeks and chin—just in time for winter.
The passenger door is open and closed before the sentence is over.
“I’m sorry. I’ll stop.”
“Oh, it’s a wretched spell. You’ll never see again.”
Malfoy ignores him, snapping a towel through water, making Harry hold it to his nose.
Malfoy touches his ear absently. “You can leave, if you want.”
Isaac nods, and they all close their eyes.
—but his neck is flashing with pain, and there is no air for words.
; like he’s known Dean to be competent in other ways. Intimate ways.
She looks over in surprise—and laughs, a wily, unkempt thing. “Tiller’s in the back. You’re more use to him.”
Harry lets himself look a little more each time. Tonight, his eyes linger long. “If that’s a threat, you’re shit out of luck.” But he’s staring at the indent of Malfoy’s beautiful throat, feeling threatened. “Explain yourself.”
"She is already going with someone," Harry said.
"How would I do it?' Harridan asked
"When was this?" McGonagall asked.
"Wait Mum said you got tested before your First-Year," Fred said leaning forward.
"It seems according to the results of the Charm Quirinus is giving off two life signs his own and someone named Tom Riddle," Madam Pomfrey said.
Rubbing his forehead, Draco knew he had to clear his head of this scent.  It was making him lose control of his Pureblood Mask.  Needing to get away from it all Draco decided to spend the afternoon either in the Slytherin Common Room or in the company of his friends.  And for the most part, his plan had worked only coming across the scent when he had gone to supper that night.  As he settled into his bed that night at least he had proved without a doubt that the scent had not originated from anyone in Slytherin having spent his time in the Common Room playing Magical Chess and even joining in on several games of Magical or Muggle.
"Why not?" the bushy-haired witch basically whines.
Over the next couple of days, Harry had a hard time not thinking about what Snape had shown him with his memories. At that time Harry had gotten more homework back from his classes than he had done on his own and saw in each subject, apart from History of Magic and D.A.D.A. his grades had shown a large improvement making him rather angry at Hermione for the "help" she had been giving him in each of the classes. His sudden coldness to the bushy-haired Magical did not go unnoticed as Ron asked what had happened between the pair of them. Knowing that Hermione "helped" him as well Harry revealed that the person who was tutoring him Potions, while not giving Draco's name, had found evidence Hermione had been sabotaging his work. Harry explained he had decided to test out if she had only done it to his Potion's homework or all their classes. Harry arched an eyebrow at his best friend seeing Ron did not look concerned by the news that their friend was messing with his work, even after Harry pointed out she could be doing the same to Ron. The redhead's lack of reaction raised some red flags for Harry who quickly said he had been joking and placed the blame on his moody behavior at Snape's feet due to his Occlumency lessons. This had got a laugh out of Ron who had said Harry should not joke about Hermione cheating like that.
"What?" Harry asked.
"You will not have him," Draco said as he lifted his wand, unfortunately, in his non-dominant hand.
"True, but I did come back and save your ass," Draco said with a small glare not wanting to bring up what Granger had told him about them being connected somehow through that action.
"Master Potter," the one in the skirt said giving him a bow with suited one gave him a small curtsy.
"How it is not like I hang around the door to learn your guy's passphrase," Harry said.
"I have read about that sort of thing," the girl said not really answering his question,
"I quite agree which means we need to get inside now," Bathsheda said as they both headed back to the alley and secretly unlocked the backyard fence. Casting Notice-Me-Not and Dissalustionment Charms on themselves. Bathsheda then cast a Hover Charm on Charity floating her up to the window with the bars. Charity made short work of the bars first banishing before putting up an illusion so it would not raise any eyebrows from the Muggles. Seeing Harry inside the room doing some sit-ups she gently knocked on his window making him start. Knowing that he would be able to see her due to the charms she had on her to go unnoticed she cast a spell on the window which would allow him to see her through it.
"What was that Potty?" Draco asked arching one of his eyebrows at him making the butterflies in Harry's stomach seemed to shift into a tornado.
"Thank you, Professor...." Harry said but had no idea who she was.
"Very well Hagrid please deliver Miss Granger and Mr. Longbottom back to Gryffindor before delivering Mr. Potter to the Hospital Wing. Mr. Malofy I hope I can trust you to head back to Slytherin on your own?" Professor Dumbledore said
"Is there a way to get all of this back and get rid of that contract?" Harridan asked looking up at Draco.
After he finished his plate Harry used this bit of information to once more head off alone to go talk to the man. Thinking that maybe since he had known Harry's parents he would possibly know how Harry had gone through the change. Finding Professor Lupin in his office in the middle of packing everything up the man had handed back the Marauder's Ma before Harry asked him about the change. Professor Lupin who had been lifting the empty Gridelow tank almost dropped it at the question. "I don't know Harry the best I can think of is that due to the war happening your Parents decided to have your Godparents Blood Adopt you thus giving you three Pureblood "Parents" and one Muggleborn which your body could have read as being a Third Generation Muggleborn," Lupin had guessed.
"Well for one thing if you wish you could claim an Heir room especially since you are actually in the House of your Ancestor," Minerva explained. "Other than that since you are not of age you can choose your representative to sit on the School Board to cast the vote on how the school is being run."
"What do you want, Granger?" Draco asked with a sneer at the girl.
Harry had been so lost in thought he had not even noticed that Minister Fudge, Snape, and Professor Dumbledore had entered the ward until his mind registered the Windex and red ink mixture. Thankfully the Headmaster was standing closer to him than Snape was thus mostly blocking out the man's scent for he no desire to see what his least favorite teacher smelled like. Rather he tried to think how it was possible for him to become either an Alpha or Omega besides him basically being Fate's whipping boy. Going with the whipping boy theory as it would also make sense for why he was undergoing the change almost three months before he had his fourteenth birthday which was the earliest one change. Completely shutting out the events happening around him Harry figured he might have to take a page out of Hermione's wheelhouse and head to the library tomorrow to do some research on the change. He only really looked up to see what was going on when he heard the door slam shut as the Minister left the wing, and Madam Pomfrey gave him and his friends Dreamless Sleep Potions as she said they earned it from what had happened that night.
“You were lovers.”
His eyes snap open, and he exhales, blindly, laughing without meaning to—feeling, amazingly, how pleased the house becomes, how
“Malfoy,” he says. “Am I late?”
“Not right,” Diana grumbles, yanking her wand from her pant pocket and scoffing; turning off, away. “Not

Malfoy’s eyes alight. Harry finds—alarmingly—he would like to be that light.
“You were thinking of me, unprovoked?”
Harry swallows. “That’s different. You were
But Harry isn’t sorry. Hands pressed into pale pink thighs, cock swallowed down the back of his throat. Eyes watering, alight in affection, in the cut and gasp of Draco’s quick pleasure, bright and blue. “Good fucking
Nothing appears outright amiss. Harry follows the rest—a solemn parade led by Malfoy. The darkwood entryway lit only by weak overhead bulbs, narrow by illusion; foyer diminutive beneath a twisted stairway. A cursory glance reveals no personal effects save a solitary portrait: dark-haired mother and father encircled by three sons, one daughter.
"Okay I do admit it is nice to be alone but what is going on?" Blaise asked the pair arching an eyebrow at his Submissives.
," the elder said.
"True it would not create a bond by itself but Harry's test listed that the majority of Magical Brittian owed him a Lift Debt for stopping He-Whose-Name-Shall-Never-Be-Spoken. Harry's Account Manager told us that since both boys now have a Life Dept to each other a bond was created," he explained.
"What do you mean convince them?"
Vernon almost got pulled over for speeding multiple times as he drove them home due to his anger at the freak. Making a vow to beat the boy within an inch of his life the next time he saw him Vernon finally pulled into the driveway of #4. As the garage was full of some of Dudley's old possessions as well as a boat he had been working on the group left the car and made their way up to the front door wondering what a page was doing on their door. Petunia thought it was a notice for the next H.O.A. meeting since she had not been home to have it handed to her directly. Reaching the door before he unlocked it Vernon tore off the note and unfolded it his face going red as he was it was an eviction notice giving them twenty-four hours to leave the building with anything they wanted to take with them otherwise deal with the law. "Petunia?" Vernon asked through gritted teeth looking at his beloved wife.
The fixing of others.
“He didn’t want the house to live without him,” Malfoy murmurs.
“You’re not. You just—” Malfoy is irritated, now, if he wasn’t before. He shoves a hand back through his hair. “You could’ve—
Malfoy’s house—in a strange neighborhood, on the edge of the city, far from that cold-walled manor, Pansy’s green-walled flat—is so low-ceilinged that the sky must be pressing down, indoors. He pours wine in the kitchen, barefoot on linoleum. White tiles married in the middle by kissing black diamonds. A plant with chartreuse-leaves hangs from a hook above the refrigerator; one of its vines so long and winding it reaches all the way to the top of the cabinets.
“The hurt,” is the answer, buried in Draco's neck. “I'll eat it. I’ll eat it alive.”
Harry tries and tries and tries but can’t swallow it down. It sticks in the center of his throat like a leaf plastered to a street drain in a rainstorm. Water rushing by, plenty and multiplying, desperate to dislodge. The leaf soaked and resilient.
, and all of Salazar’s children, and all of the sweet—” Draco can barely stop for breath before spilling into the stretched mouth, wanting and ready; Harry growls, beneath. Jerks himself quickly over cool tile, panting.
“It’s either going to be very bad,” he says, slowly. “Or very, very good.”
Malfoy casts a tempus charm, then shoves it off with a wave of his hand. He appears distracted, one leg crossed over the other, brow furrowed. Wearing a slim grey turtleneck and finely cut trousers. Among such spartan surroundings, he could be a clothing model, draped for a photograph.
Rain finally came + it’s beautifully cool. Wonder how long it will last. It was marvelous because it started suddenly and then was alternately terrific and gentle.
“Of course you can.” Malfoy steps back, hand spread out as though in offering.
“Mm.”
The bartender is looking at the two of them curiously now. Harry motions for the check. Maybe Draco grieves because he is familiar with grieving. Maybe he is stuck in a body that craves grief. Maybe grief staves other grief.
Malfoy and his body that will not apologize for itself.  Sweat-slicked, bright, joyful. Harry looks—and stares, without meaning to stare.
He comes to on the broken floor of a study, a stream of bright red staining his fingers. His nose feels hot and everyone is circled around him, staring. It feels a lot like his pain in the Percivals foyer, frantic that a girl was being torn apart below.
“I’m not—I'm not sure I can give you what you want.” Malfoy says it quietly, swirling wine around in the glass.
He vanishes the mess. Gets up and faces himself in the en suite mirror.
The job was hard, more taxing than usual. Harry feels the exhaustion pulling him apart. He’s dehydrated, but he orders a whiskey.
Ron widens the lean his shoulders. “Bit suspicious, no?”
And maybe Malfoy inhales, sharply. Or maybe it’s wind. “You, a total stranger? I’m content with that.”
“Potter?”
Harry stares down at the hand.
Ron and Hermione switch off pub nights, now, at least while Rose is still so small. Harry thinks Ron is handling being away poorly. He’s been antsy all night, looking over his shoulder, like Hermione will burst in with some terrible thing gone wrong. The table shakes, slightly, with the hike of his knee.
“Coping mechanism,” Malfoy clarifies. Since Harry’s known him—recently—his hair has grown an inch, maybe two. Long enough to be tucked behind his ears.
He reaches, spreads a firm hand on Harry’s shoulder. Keeps him there; and turns his face, looks to home.
Malfoy shrugs. “Clever hijacking. The magic is—disguising the real home from us. It’s a guise.”
“As if you’ve never been saddled with anything new, or anything hard and—triumphed, yeah? Gotten into it and over it or however you—y’know. Survive it.”
A slow nod, a cursory glance. “I wanted...something very different for myself.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
When Harry finds himself a second time in Malfoy’s home—in the sitting room, stationed on a lived-in, aubergine loveseat with a glassful of something that tastes like spiced October air—he finds himself sinking into the absurdity.
And Malfoy is watching him, carefully. Behind him, the others watch too.
And Harry doesn’t quite care for the way Malfoy’s tone curls around
Harry may not have any right to feel impatient—this is Malfoy’s faction, after all—but he’s beginning to panic, the hum of it low and heavy in his chest.
In a dug-out tread of vein: Bright blue flame. He remembers the pain of that particular part, feels the heat of Draco’s young waist, hears the cries of another, left behind.
Harry feels the grin burst, widen till his cheeks stretch. “But imagine: Harry Potter, naked. I hear it’s a sight to behold.”
Still blinking, Harry drinks. Laughing, Ron raises his own pint and lets it go down slow.
Harry feels it now, what he didn’t before. Among the rushing, the red—a feeling of broken forgiveness.
“Are you going to tell me what’s going on?”
effort here, we’ve a job to—”
“It’s hard to.”
enough to see, is more than he deserves.
“What’s that, Potter? Mumbling?” Diana is staring, and though she sounds annoyed, she is leaning in, toward him. Unable to avoid his intuition.
Malfoy blinks. He’s cleaned himself of all debris, all the dust and residue. Hair combed back neatly. “Alright, then. We’ll sit in silence.”
“You don’t have to worry about me.”
“Potter!”
Like the hitch of Draco’s leg, up and down, on the passenger side.
Diana makes an indistinguishable sound, scuffs a shoe against the bloody floor. In the corner of the room is a tall, broad-leafed plant. Harry stares at it and wonders how it has survived on its own.
Instead of denying it—or laughing, or frowning, or changing the subject— Malfoy huffs a sudden frustrated breath, and stands straight up, amber liquid sloshing in his glass. “Is this how it’s going to be, then?”
Harry winces when the spell comes. Malfoy’s magic feels unfamiliar, sharp. The bleeding stops short. “I get these all the time.” He repeats, which is both true and untrue.
“What
Malfoy approaches like bridges burn away to reveal dry, solid land. Like they could shake hands on that ground.
The car loiters in the supermarket car park, heat on blast. It’s riddled in support charms, handmade. Menagerie of half-working-things.
“No,” Draco breathes, but his hands are clutching at Harry’s, and he’s shaking, underneath, and the sink still runs.
, and Merlin save me—I
“How—” Malfoy exhales a controlled breath, then breathes in another; measured. “I’ve been with other men, yes, Potter, is that a problem for you?”
Rose wraps her tiny hand around Harry’s finger, squeezes. His love for her simple, without thought. Completely unbroken.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
Harry sinks into the couch. Feels the fabric like an embrace. “Is there another house?”
Harry cuts the engine, and tries not to feel angry.
There had been some late snag in the ownership ritual. Malfoy blinks over, like he’s surprised to find Harry there, still. “Oh, yes. It required assistance, but Dean’s done contracted curse retention for years and—”
Malfoy introduces the others in short bursts. “Alan Tiller,” he says, gesturing to a short, burly man, and then a woman with ferociously blue eyes—“and Diana Woolf, both at Hogwarts, few years ahead of us.” Diana levels Harry with a neutral gaze. From the man—Alan—a curt nod.
Even sat on tufty seagrass, Malfoy has such grace.
“How the fuck you did it, I’ve no idea,” Malfoy mutters. “But you’re...a very powerful wizard. Don’t need to read the unofficial biography to know that.”
Draco is haughty, and acts like he’ll retreat, any second, acts as though he’s so disgusted with himself for where they’ve ended up: tangled, sated. But he turns, he bends. Curls into the shape Harry makes. “You’re mad.”
The letter is awkward and silted; Harry is a poor writer.
A man turns, face bright and open, saying, “Chuffed to be in the presence of the savior.”
There was another fight Harry wanted to have.
, god, don’t you ever take care? Loo, Potter,
His own self stitched up, similarly; prone to tugs, quick to unravel.
A wide grey slate sky split down the middle by tall pines; Harry turns his face to the brisk afternoon, trainers kicking up dirt. Ron is letting him ruminate—or else, marveling the squall of black birds bursting up out of the trees, calling out to one another; homebound.
Something hot running down his nose.
that.”
A long silence. Harry imagines Draco taking his lips between his thumb and forefinger, giving a good squeeze.
“It’s a...business?”
Harry is surprised by it himself, but any search for the concern of Malfoy being up to something had dispersed, some time ago—entirely unconsciously. The thought of Malfoy, now, almost neutral to opinion. “Honestly? I don’t think—I don’t think this type of work leaves room for duplicity. And to bring me—to let me help? Why would he do that, if there are ulterior motives?”
“Good? Malfoy, I could’ve
“Maybe,” Draco begins—and the unsteady voice, and the way he grips the lapels of Harry’s coat, old and unthreading at the buttons—“you thought you’d never be loved. Maybe you have been, but poorly. I don’t see anything else around me, right now—just you. That’s how sick I am. That’s how much I like you.”
This makes him laugh, again—genuinely this time. “Help yourself, it’s smashing.”
The animal in the brush emerges, suddenly, from under a brown crinkled leaf: a dormouse, wide-eyed, frantic. Harry stays very still. Breathes in. “Ah, but you’ve yet to see me fully naked.”
“What’s that?”
The faction falls into an efficient working pattern. Draco is such a quiet leader; Harry watches from afar, careful not to get caught up. He feels underneath for dark rushing blue. Tries not to think of breath shared—gasping, hot. Of little furtive glances.
, he breathes, forgetting, for a second, the blood.
On the bar, Draco’s elbows slide wide enough for his hands to engulf his face; to cradle. Harry aches to reach, to help, now, if he can. But—Draco is not a house in need of fixing. He is blood and bone and soft, beautiful hair.
It comes easier, now, but also more intensely. He has to assert control.
Harry frowns at the paper in his hand. Hermione kisses his brow and pins him with a look—then goes off, goes toward what needs to be fixed.
“Putting on a show.” Harry feels the magic underneath not blue, not black—but red.
“I’m sorry.” Malfoy does sound sorry—and so gentle in it that Harry regrets lashing out badly, and immediately, and feels his brow warp up with involuntary pain.
It happens quickly from there, and almost without thought. The coming together.
, wasn’t something I could pretend, either. And I had wanted it, it was my idea, but I was bad at learning. Bad at listening.”
“Merlin,” Malfoy whispers, rubbing his hands all over his face. The gesture is so un-Malfoy-like, so vulnerable and bare, that Harry almost has to look away. “Fucks
“Oops.”
“You slept well?”
It was a mutual decision, to let anyone other than Harry begin the covenant with complicated homes. The last few jobs made clear that should another faction member initiate contact, Harry could latch on, easier. Feel out the dark blue energy, safely.
But the in between—the
“Introductions on the way. We’ll walk, we’re not far.”
“It’s the Percivals,” Malfoy murmurs as Harry joins the fold. And if he is wearing a lovely dark jumper, charcoal-colored, Harry doesn’t notice—or notices, and then erases the memory. “They’ve had an attack.”
are you on about.”
And his prick is pulled right out of his pants, overeager and dumb, jumping at Malfoy’s immediate grip; the roll of wrist, the heat of fingers, spreading. Harry inhales, clings to Malfoy’s neck. Head thumped back against cabinets.
“Mine, or yours?”
“You don’t have to apologize for feeling, but—if someone asks for space, you should give them space. Doesn’t always mean...an end. Can mean room to grow.”
His power makes everything vibrate and clatter. He has to breathe to control it. Walls seem easy, here; his blood heats. This is the easiest, this is the smallest; little parts of himself, sewn into what resists.

“Potter!”
“Oh my god.”
The line always picks up on Harry’s second ring and in the second of silence before the cool, detached, “Hello?”—like Draco hasn’t saved his number, like he doesn’t know who it is—he always tries to stop himself from saying something far too much, far too honest, like—“I was thinking of you.”
. In Harry’s hand, he pressed the parchment.
“When I was nine,” he begins, “I asked my mother for swimming lessons. I wanted to go into the pond, on the property, but I was afraid I would drown. It wasn’t a proper thing to do, of course, it was rather pedestrian, to

Somewhere in the middle of the job—a house in the east of the country, Auror-swept after a curse incident—Harry’s body feels left out and starts to bleed.
“Because I abhor peanut butter?”
The two of them look over, and Harry realizes his tone has changed, shifted—unknowingly—toward admiration.
He stumbles out the door.
“But—” Harry does not want to say: Your mark.
“You read that?”
“I’m afraid of
Harry can’t stop his leg, hitching up and down beneath the table.
“—some
, Harry thinks, slightly frantic, and brings a hand up to his heart. Feels for a steady part of himself; grounded.
In an effort to reason with himself—with his pulse, gone feral, gone sweet—Harry sits on top of the counter and dangles his feet. “Would you be my boyfriend, if I asked?”
Hands slam down on the sides of the sink. Ceramic a bruise on his skin.
He can hear the clock in the kitchen ticking; or is that a juddering pulse? Malfoy is on the loveseat, next to him, nursing his own October air. Maybe he had been right about boundaries. The space between them, no more than an arm’s length, feels unbreachable.
Undone, and breaking—heart quivering and throat closing and wand run perilously hot, mind fixed on
a good friend. And he was interested in old magic, the kind that lives in homes, and so when there was a place in Yorkshire that belonged to someone he knew, a friend that needed help—we ditched school to puzzle it out.” An alarm rings, and Malfoy flicks at the oven with his wand. The kitchen fragrant with saffron, with garlic. “And we fixed it. It took weeks, we were very young. But we fixed it.”
Because Harry has two hands—and a heart practiced at hoping—and the cottage still requires repair—he returns, next day, to the coast.
The silence in the room lasted nearly ten minutes before Snape used his wand to summon a book. "As you complain that I am not teaching you how to perform Occlumency this book should help," Snape said passing over a book entitled: Blocking One's Mind, a Beginners Guide to Occlumency. "I want you to read the whole book before our next lesson Harry. The book has multiple ways one can block out others from looking through their mind we can only hope one of which you can use. And while it is earlier than normal we can call it quits for tonight," Snape said. Harry was shocked by the statement thinking if anything it would have been later for they had been at it for an hour before Snape had let Harry see his memories, but looking at his watch Harry was surprised to see it was only an hour and a half after the lesson had started. As Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower he reasoned that watching the memories from Snape had gone faster than he had thought it had been for it had felt like a couple of hours not thirty minutes.
After he dropped off for the second time that night Harry had the strangest dream he had ever had. For he found his nose filled with the scent of Sirius and the mysterious person from earlier, and he seemed to be on the trail of it. In the dream, he seemed to have the nose of the cereal Mascot, Tucan Sam, as he followed his nose along a strange and winding path as he scaled rough inclines and snuck past horrid specters of Dementors. In the dream, he felt he had reached the source of the scent but it had been blocked by the door to the Chamber of Secrets. Like he had done the year before Harry had slipped into Parseltongue as he told the Chamber door to open up. He then had to navigate a small maze before finding himself before just a normal door. In the dream, Harry turned the doorknob and to his utter joy found it unlocked as he opened the last barrier between him and the scent. But there seemed to be another challenge as there were three long low pedestals where the scent could be coming from. But they did not fool his nose as he headed to the one furthest from the door and pulled off a cloak to reveal what looked like a giant body pillow.
“From death to...” Draco sways, spatula in hand, like he isn’t a wizard, like he hasn’t a wand. “Boyfriends—honestly, Potter.”
Under the soot, something screams.
Harry spares him a glance and wishes he hadn’t, more than anything. Because Malfoy is looking back.
, Ezra—”
“I don’t.”
Harry knows the Percivals—they all do, if they’ve read the papers. Bloodline fraught in pre and post-war in-fighting, sons and daughters rejecting the Pureblood-whims of parents, lessons hard-learned in underground loyalty and dealt out in Azkaban sentences; the family earned its fortune in illegal manipulation of Muggles. Annabeth Percival was just a year above Harry and Malfoy at Hogwarts; Hufflepuff Head Girl, their sixth year. She didn’t return after winter holidays—stolen into the putrefied throes of her parent’s exploits.
“Who among us isn’t stuck with a skeleton, stuck inside a body?” Harry teases in a yellow sunshiney kitchen. Draco making eggs, pouring juice. Domesticity draped like a promise. “It’s not enough to ask for death. We must dig our own graves.”
It’s just a floorboard, gone rigid, gone stiff. Slicing his finger an inch. Nothing life-ending. Fixable.
But this—but Malfoy. It’s strange, but it doesn’t feel empty.
It is something like madness, a kinetic buzz; falling from Draco’s white blonde hair, long and tangled; body, bright and scared; eyes, spilling over grey.
“I’m not going to leave,” he says, in case it needs to be said.
And this—what new color is this, clouding Harry’s chest, eyes caught so firmly in Malfoy’s? And this—this not looking away, even when he should?
“Yes,” Harry answers, following Malfoy’s gaze, finding tracts of clean air through the fissured beams. Rivulets of magic—blue, frantic—twist under their feet. “I can fix it.”
“Christmas, course, loads of work to do there and there’s—I’ll need something for Hermione’s birthday, that’s not far off. Need new pans, the old ones are—no, I haven’t cared for them well. But, that’s okay, I can just get new ones. And Ginny and Luna, the wedding, it’s in—”
The world remolds itself into something resembling
Ron regards him carefully. Takes a drag of his pint and settles it onto the table and stares some more. There’s an unidentifiable dark stain on the collar of his neat blue shirt; probably Rose-related. The pub is light of traffic for a Wednesday.
Ezra glints a grim look. “Cursed fire.”
“When?”
“It wasn’t your responsibility,” Draco says. “You don’t have to feel that guilt.”
The night sings suddenly of rain, the room damp with sweat. Each movement a tug in a different direction. Malfoy keening; loud, then louder. “Don’t make promises you can’t—oh, keep.”
A love—new, suffusive—could do just the same. The fall from the line: headfirst.
"What's it to you?" Harry asked.
"Wait if you are adding the book why are you reducing the price?" Harry asked at the gesture which seemed so out of character for the other boy.
"Well I was summoned to Hogwarts after this student fell into an unexplained Magical Coma," Mr. Malfoy said making sure not to give Harry's name out. "When I arrived in the Medical Ward of the castle I discovered that the Medi-Witch that ran it had failed miserably at her job so I ended up casting a Diagnostic Charm on the student myself. While it showed numerous medical issues none of them explained the coma. I was hoping an Inheritance Test would clear some things up before I do take both students to St. Mungos.
"Well that gets rid of one thorn in your side Blue Jay," Draco said, "my friends have also agreed to come so all that is left is for us to pick a time."
Since Harry, while having just woken up from a Magical Coma, was able to travel easily on his own Draco was helped along by his dad as they headed to the appropriate office for Harry to get his test. Unknown to Harry was that one of the reasons for the path they were given was for specialized Wards and Detection Spells in the bank to read his magic so it could notify any Goblins which managed his family accounts. The Potter Family Account Manager, Bonecrusher, was rather pleased that the Heir of the Potter line had shown back up at the bank having wished to speak to him since his first visit, but had found Harry and Hagrid had already left the bank. Bonecrusher had then tried to send owls to the boy which contained letters with Portkey Charms attached but each letter had been returned unopened or even touched. He suspected that someone attached a Mail Ward on his young client, most likely due to how famous the human was to the other humans in Brittian. Unfortunately, the Ward was also preventing him from getting in touch with the Potter Heir so he could not even change the Ward to accept letters from the bank itself. With the boy being at the bank Bonecrusher would finally be able to shift the Wards so he could reach his client in case there were some problems with the funds being transferred from his vaults.
As Harry came to his meeting with Draco he had hidden the blonde's cloak in an inside pocket which had helped him block out any bad scents even when it was nowhere near his nose. Finding his way to the stack set aside for the bibliographies he found a table that looked so dusty his aunt would never have let it in the house. But as he got closer he saw the table had an actual Glamor attached to it, shocking him a little. "Oh don't look so surprised Harry this is a special place where Slytherins go to make deals and arrangements with members of other Houses. And since no one usually comes back here we will undisturbed," Draco's voice said from behind him.
Draco had not been so sure of why Neville had wanted to help him at first; before the other boy explained that he and Harrison were Godbrothers with each of their mom's the other's Godmother. And with Draco having the Marriage Contract with Harrison both boys knew that they could trust each other, at least when it came to Harrison. Granted they did not always agree on their plans, Neville having wanted to be taught the cleansing spell Draco knew so he could be the one to cast it, but Draco would never be able to live with himself if he let someone else cleanse Harrison apart from a fully certified Healer or Goblin. The pair had ended up fighting about it for a bit which only ended when Draco hit him with a Leg Locker Curse. But now that part was all moot for Draco had felt Harrison having somehow gotten Cleansed so he was going to fully apologize for his overreaction to his ally.
“But my mother was soft with me, always,” Malfoy continues, and his eyes soften with it, too. “Softer than I deserved. And she obliged me, she hired an instructor named Theo, a man from the village who had business with our family, in some way or another. He was a wonderful swimmer. There was a pool installed, in the atrium. It looked...otherworldly, in the sunlight.”
To trace the line of that jaw; restless and clenching, eyes lifted up to the ceiling. “Ezra was a good...friend.
“It?”
“I’m always careful—”
The two of them had reacted rather placidly to the mention—
Fuck this—fuck
He lets that unfold over Malfoy—the narrow alley, the lovely jumper. And then he adds, because it may as well be said: “I barely trust myself.”
Hermione is calling from the kitchen. Sounds of rifling in cabinets, clinking jars. Harry turns down the radio; the match is a gridlock, anyway, Harpies and Cannons absolutely head-to-head. “Not especially, why?”
Harry keeps his back to the wall. He will go down that drain himself before he has the courage to dredge any injury.
The hand retracts. When Malfoy rolls back his shoulders, he’s a good inch or three taller than Harry. “Not at all.”
“Christ,” Diana laughs, “it’s a building, Potter, it’s a structure.”
what?—is lost in the paralysis of Harry seeming to understand, for the first time, that he wants.
A woman walking a dog stares in fright as he catches up with the pavement, disoriented. The day is bright and cloudless. His head pulses in pain. He touches fingers to his mouth; comes away red-handed.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
He thinks the polite exit will be enough; to tamper the way his blood is eating fire in his veins, the way his head is stuffed with an unbearable scream.
In the years after the war, Harry was so displeased with his body; all its empty space, all its inability to make up for what it had lost. He sought affection and a kind of unhappiness, in the same nights, blinking and bleary-eyed; in bars, strange bedrooms.
His shirt is blue; Malfoy’s cheeks go red. They are three sides of the same triangle under yellow light; primary color kids.
Harry slants toward pleasure helplessly; kitchen-floor and tipping hips and a man culled to his mouth like fish up to the surface of the world.
The work has already resumed. The door wide open. The floors still sticky with red. Harry breathes in the scent of ruined things. Feet itching for ground. Pansy is standing in the sitting room, instructing.
A car drives past them. “I’m afraid I’m...unfixable.”
“I can’t take it back.”
And Malfoy balks. “What kind of question is that?”
Draco pinches the skin of Harry’s hip. “You’re making me wait, still?”
people, albeit yourself—”
“You’ve got to tell me.” Harry interjects, despising his own desperate voice. “You’ve got to tell me right now if this is just a—a bit of a
There is a second of held breath. Somewhere in the yard, an animal fumbles through the brush.
“Was it good?”
he wonders, but it’s an old joke. The pain tired of being pain. He feels Malfoy’s breath making its way through each lung. In this new house, with this new skin, that’s enough.

Draco’s brow knits into a question. “I’m so rarely in a car.”
better.”
“So.”
“Coerce? I made up my mind to do it.”
Harry stares. Blinks. Gloms on
“Yes,” Malfoy says, and this is patience. “It will be slow, but it can be fixed. And you will help. You will be a massive help.”
And the response, a week later. Like a beacon:
“I might’ve thought, before seeing this flat. But it’s—your doppelgänger.”
And how is it, exactly, they fix?
The glance is sharp. “Chrissakes,” Malfoy murmurs, wrapping an arm around his middle, as though to shield himself from the blunt question. “Don’t mince words, Potter, be my guest.”
Draco had let Harry drive them to the supermarket because Harry threw just a bit of a fit; insisted.
“Very important chore.”
“Have I composed?”
And he has to look away. Motion for another drink. Malfoy sips his wine patiently, letting the silence lengthen. Across the bar, a man and woman are wrapped up in a corner booth, kissing. The gall to do this so directly in the eyeline of others. The knot in Harry’s stomach. The waitress delivering his second whiskey with a flirtatious smile.
Alan nods, steps back.
Harry had always thought of Malfoy as an island: An isolated idea, feeding on the isolated waters around him. But now he wasn’t so sure. Malfoy was a collaborator. He cared.
And with that Harry can’t agree. Can’t stand to think of it—and it’s embarrassing—but death is of course preferable to being without half of yourself.
Harry is surprised to find he is the only member of the faction invited to the flat. He drinks the tea Malfoy offered, in the sitting room, eyes roving the space hungrily. Stoic, contemporary, green. Impeccably clean, smelling of leather and pine. Even the teacup is unembellished china; cold to the touch. “Er, are we waiting for others?”
“Love,” Ron clarifies, “is what I mean.”
“You don’t—” Harry breathes deep to get the words out. “You don’t owe me anything. I could’ve been different toward you, too, you know, I could’ve tried to help—but I was selfish, and scared. I knew you needed help. I never tried to help.”
“What a ghastly waste of water.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“It’s okay if—”
If Draco wants to grow, he only needs a week.
“Former—” Harry pauses, restarts. “Ah, differing loyalties?”
“No, it’s alive, and it’s—it’s hurt. How could you—”
It is the general pattern: hurting before he is hurt. Ending before it is over. Making it even; making it fair. Even with Jane, Harry is loathe to explain it or endure it being explained. Things were taken from him as a child. Taken and never forgiven, never rationalized. Teetering the edge of
But Harry does—one way or another. “You remember—realizing something very...critical, about yourself? How you—” Harry swallows. Plays around with the edge of his zip-up jumper. “Might be afraid to let it change you.”
The faction stares up at the engraving, grim and sweat-licked. Diana guesses, “Curse?”
But Malfoy is wild—this is his faction, after all, his fixing to do. Pointing rabidly at the cut, the blood, like it needs to be indicated to be felt: Long red line down Harry’s left index finger.
They round the edge of a thicket of woods, sparse in leaves and birdsong. Bare branches that shake in the wind. Harry is glad for his parka, blue and old and warm, held together by sheer faith and piss poor re-threading charms.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
Seasalt wind burns their cheeks; the faction pulls coats against necks. Backlit in restless ocean, Malfoy is foreboding, jaw-clenched.
“Oh, god.”
“The difference,” Malfoy says, quickly, “between this and anything you’ve been through before, is that it’s a choice. No one—I know it doesn’t seem like it, because here I am, asking—but no one is forcing it. I wouldn’t—” he clears his throat, and looks down at the grass, picks a piece of it between his fingers. “Ask you to sacrifice any of yourself, for the good of others.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
Malfoy inclines his head. “I had to become skilled at glamouring, out of respect to the clients. Many of the repairs were wartime damage, as you might expect.” A shoeless sockless foot is arching on the floor, restless. “It was—is a sort of atonement. And anyway,” he shakes his head, self-deprecating even as he atones; even here, in his own kitchen. “I have Ezra to thank. He encouraged me to see a mind healer, and...try to understand myself, better.”
“I...look for endings. Maybe I invent.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“Help me?”
He can’t face him. Can’t look back at the lovely jumper, at the way Malfoy has become so much a better self. He keeps walking, wiping helplessly at blood.
“Okay.”
“I know.”
“My mind healer,” Harry explains—and Malfoy nods. Sits down, again, this time in a seat opposite Harry, an armchair carved in cherrywood, upholstered in lovely blue.
The magic is curious; it listens. Begins to tremble. Curls, slowly, into a brightening violet pulse, and slowly,
“He was...a father figure?”
“Well, fuck you,” Draco chokes, helpless, bending to kiss the mouth that held him.
Draco breathing in, breathing out; nudging his nose at Harry's throat, like he’ll tear it apart and be the breath, himself. Like he'll take care of the breathing.
. He levels Harry again with his eyes. “It’s okay if you don’t want to chat.”
“That covenant you just formed with the house?” Malfoy finally says, voice quiet and firm. “Usually takes us an entire day.”
Once the mess had been cleaned from his hand, Malfoy sent Harry home. Told him it was important to establish boundaries between them. “Such as,” he murmured guardedly, fingers clenched carefully, like he had to restrain touch. “I am absolutely not putting out on the first date.”
The loo is lit by flickering light; unsure of its place here. Nervous. Harry feels the same prickle in his lungs.
“Potter!”
“I mean the house,” Malfoy adds, like an afterthought.
“I’m fine,” Harry snaps, tugging himself from the hold. Ignoring the imprint of Malfoy’s hand. The burn.
Draco fiddles with the lapel of his herringbone peacoat, refined and well-pressed. His shoes are shiny and clean; some special leather.
“Yeah?”
The house tilts on its axis; the faction a chorus of indignance, relief. But the greenglow through slits in the wallpaper—has won. Harry blinks furiously. All the eyes have turned to him. He shakes his head, tries to say
“Ravenclaws,” Malfoy laughs, as if to explain. “And Isaac Buetté, lastly.”
“She’s dead, Harry,” Malfoy says simply. And it’s so surprising, so blunt, that Harry hardly notices his name, among the rest.
Fresh with the violent; the tender.
On Friday nights Harry joins Ron and Hermione for dinner. He talks—maybe too much—about the faction, all the talented, off-putting characters. He doesn’t mention the second job—which, just as Malfoy had said, was fixed, albeit slowly, over the course of a few steady days, Harry observing more than helping, actively restraining his magic. He speaks of Malfoy guardedly, too, still wary of Ron’s wariness. Hermione, on the contrary, asks question after question, wondering how Malfoy got into the field of domestic magic. “It’s such a fascinating subject,” her brown eyes brighten at the prospect. “I’d love to pick his brain. Think he’d come round for drinks, if you asked?”
, to the pound of Harry’s pulse—something shifts, opens up.
Malfoy has intuitions, too. He runs a finger along the journal entry.
“Oh, you’re writing a play?” Harry breathes onto the plane of red lips, the song of the other heart pressed underneath his hand; thighs wrapping waist. “You’re a playwright, suddenly?”
“I have to leave. Now, at least. I just need—”
“Sorry,” Harry interrupts. “Dean Thomas?”
Even good magic goes bad. Harry feels the end of it all, down the back of his throat. He sees a flash of the flame, for a second, the aggrieved pair. How sometimes love cuts just the same as fear.
“Fucking hell,” Ezra breathes, eyes stuck fast to Harry, and Isaac is asking, “How’d you convince him, Draco?”
Harry looks up, appalled.
“Tell me—tell me I’m not keeping you here.”
Harry doesn’t sleep well. He’s afraid to take potions, to depend on anything.
, he says.”
Morning should be brighter but November makes everything dim. Harry cooks omelets, his one good meal. Babbles incessantly, nervous that Draco is fragile, still, wrapped in a silken robe, sipping pomegranate juice. Talks on and on about his car, about all the roads he’s ever driven. Talks of the trips he hopes to take—carefully not saying
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Is it—is it okay that I’m calling?”
Somewhere behind them, near the front of the house, Malfoy is yelling. Ezra and Diana are laughing. Someone speaks in French for a long, winding while—and then Malfoy calls someone
“Who are we,” he begins, trying to sound reasonable, “to tell this house what it needs to feel.”
The magic is choked in corrosion; bleeding dry. It gasps beneath Harry’s prodding—pulse screaming out, the exertion too much too soon. A blinding blue light building inside.
Ron shrugs, now. Smiles over at the bar, signaling
The silence like stabbing—slowly, into the flesh of Harry’s temple. A dull burn.
“I didn’t,” Malfoy murmurs, a finger caught between his chin and bottom lip in contemplation. “He wrote to
And though he hates to be scolded, and is used to the sight of his own blood, Harry obeys. Something in the tone, maybe. He is careful and holds his finger perpendicular and walks off to find a loo.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“Yes, it worked, you plonker, are you alright? Does your head feel...you fell backward, and made some awful cracking, we couldn’t get—it looked like a mannequin.”
The tea will go cold if not consumed. Harry pulls back the rest and maybe Malfoy is watching his throat as he swallows. Harry presses down the heat this brings.
The car passes slowly, the driver glaring through closed windows. It leaves them silent, breathing hard.
The green country is dying; arms of cold gathering the land, draining life. This is the color of home: winter grass, bone-white, stark.
“Oh my god,” Harry buries his face in his hands. “Don’t thank me, please.”
Found it, fed it, held it.
Maybe when he said boundary, Malfoy meant space. Lots of space. Maybe he meant,
It’s almost difficult to see, that’s how odd, how out of place—that so much of a house could be just...gone. The chimney rises lone and naked in the blue day, entire roof chunked off, hanging on only by dregs of beams and fragmented exterior walls; all of it charred, blackened. Burnt.
Pansy glances over. Her eyelashes are blunt, black things. “Me too.”
He tries pulling at the finer edges. Closes his eyes. Tells the floors, the magic, buzzing anxious beneath:
“You—
“No, no, of—of course not.”
The magic in this house was gentle, and then: An infestation. Moldy magic, bursting; an incident, an object, a curse. Harry feels an echo of the people in the house; the cut of their pain as the magic infested first their bodies, then their home.
"No, I—” Harry looks back at the space between their bodies—more of it, now.
Small—and enormous. Surviving.
Sunday afternoon walks are few, but sacred. Once a month Rose spends the day with Molly and Arthur, Hermione settled in with well-deserved alone time, and Harry and Ron take a long bundled walk on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole. Down flat lowlands, up the grass hike of Stoatshead Hill. It’s a simple indulgence. Kinship and clear air, silence easy broken up with Ministry anecdotes and laughter; talk of fixing homes.
“No,” Draco cuts his head to the side.
“I hope it’s a nice spell.”
Draco pretends to be confused. Young, and beautiful. “I’m not...digging.”
If this stings, Draco doesn’t let on. “I was guilty of thinking I should’ve done what was asked of me, that I should’ve—” this does sting, and he shakes it, takes a mouthful of dry martini. An olive bobs to the bottom of the glass. “I hated you. I hated you with every cell in my body. I thought you were so lucky.”
Malfoy is looking up at the cracked-open roof, hands twined behind his back. He looks so distinctly unfamiliar. Something prods at Harry’s sternum. Like the wing of a quivering moth.
“And—Annabeth?”
“Theo was patient with me, even though I was nasty, an utter brat, and was furious that it wasn’t a skill I could
A migration of large birds flies up through Harry’s lungs, up the column of his esophagus.
Closes his eyes.
” Harry says, surprised, “me anything.”
Draco looks. Gaze catching in the rounds of Harry’s glasses—maybe he can see his own face, reflected. “I did. Didn’t matter you had it godawful, worse than me—you weren’t on the wrong side.”
“It’s just—I’m impatient. For another job.”
Malfoy deflates; all the air gone out. “Forgive me. I’m—shell-shocked. I suspected, but I never really believed it could be true.”
“No, earlier.” Which is both a lie and the truth; he is thinking of him, always. “I was eating peanut butter and thinking of you.”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“Won’t be fixed.”
The house leans into his palm. He feels it, now, under emerald wallpaper.
The town center takes rectangular shape round a tree-choked park. Harry leaves the car at the edge and gets out, stretching his legs under high morning sun. He strolls into the park, tucking hands in pockets, looking up at the shade of dense green. A woman pushing a pram smiles at him; a group of shirtless men jog by, backs shiny with sweat. Harry checks his watch. 9:02.
“Kreacher, then?” Hermione asks, emerging into the dining room, toting a tin of lemon bread. “Hardly seen baked goods pass through this house, all these years.”
“Worse you
“Let me help?”
Harry tries to avoid the red on the ground as he approaches. It may not be real—but he doesn’t want to be stained. Alan finds a leather-bound journal, left open to an entry:
“Like I haven’t seen you cry.”
Harry stares. At the sink, Draco is a creature of the deep sea; hunched over and lonely. Even his back looks so lonely. A curve to press in.
“But—” Harry swallows, trying to catch up to the information Malfoy laid out, trying to see where he fits in—what he just did, without any clear purpose or meaning. “How come—”
It was an accident; a lover’s spat, a bad fire.
Harry meets Hermione’s eyes. She shakes her head, a bit, as though she’s examined him, and come to a conclusion based only on the lines of his face. “Oh, Harry,” she murmurs. Rose reaches up from her highchair to tug at one of Hermione’s curls, babbling. Harry turns to her tiny, rounded cheeks. Feels a little burst of handmade love.
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“Here I am, calling.”
Annabeth has a kind, open face; out of place amid such indifference. Harry nearly runs right into Alan’s back; stops just in time, realizing the rest have stopped quite short.
“University?”
“What?”
Draco left bed that morning agitated, grumbling about errands and this and that, about lovers too lazy for normal breakfasting hours, for a well-brewed morning cup. Harry watched him as he dressed, fingers quick and lithe on shirt-buttons, brow puckered in a half-formed frown. To watch Draco was to drown in the pink slip of early morning; Harry never stood a chance. Not warm under sheets, remembering. Not being scolded for watching, chided for the too-long kiss, all tongue and hot throats, voices waking up.
“Now?”
“Are you tired, Potter? Short on breath?” Malfoy is looking so closely, so intensely, that Harry begins to feel hot under the examination, feels his cheeks flush.
But he replies—“It’s okay.”
Harry sits on the grass and looks out into the water, large and looming; curses how there’s always,
with something to survive.
“Are you...alright? You don’t sound—”
⋅ ⋅ ⋅
“I appreciate your honesty,” Malfoy finally says. “And I don’t mean to be short. I have my own...reservations. About—” he waves vaguely at the in-between. “This.”
On a primary school stage: Harry rocks back and forth eyes-closed, waiting for someone to call. Something to start. Noisy stage. Loud, loud stream—the water runs, and should he follow?
“Are you exhausted, right now?”
“Give me,” Draco repeats, breathing out. “Give me time.”
This pain—betrayed—is different from the other homes. It cowers like a cold dog; wrapped up in itself. Holding itself. Bleeding all over the floor.
Wants to take Draco’s face in his hands, thumbs like kisses to his jaw; wants to beg, a little, say the root of all healing is
Malfoy drags him to his feet, fretting, angry, tugging him to the en suite. “Really, it’s fine.” Harry betrays himself; likes the feel of Malfoy’s arm around his waist. “This happens all the time.”
“No,” Malfoy sighs, exasperated. “I attended school with you, did I not? Broke your nose, once, on a train? Ring any bells?”
But Malfoy—grey eyes flashing, lean hips pushing, unhelpful—unbuttons Harry’s jeans and tugs, urgently, at the waistband of his pants. Mouth burning neck.
“You weren’t guilty of anything except being very young, and doing as your father said.”
“Reasonable.” And this time when they look at one another, the surprise is mutual. “Strange.”
He falters, tugged; stops mid-step. The others murmur in low tones, perhaps discussing where they start, how to go about repairs. Harry feels his fingers flexing in and out. Tucked into his back pocket, his wand gives a small vibration.
“Sort of...” Harry takes a contemplative drink of his pint, foaming catching on his lip. “Consultation, I suppose. Him and the—he calls it the faction, and—I know, I know, yeah,” he reassures, seeing the look on Ron’s face. “I’m not entirely sure what that’s about, yet. But they go in and...help the house magic. Help it...” he shrugs. “Heal.”
“God, this
Malfoy pinches his nose between fingers, exhaling. “The...having you over,” he clarifies. “What will we even talk about?”
“I thought I saw you, once,” he says, instead of feeling hot—and before he loses the nerve. “In Diagon. But then I convinced myself it was just someone—” he shrugs, swallows
He lets go.
Harry doesn’t understand. He breathes in very deep and regards the house around him, reaches for the pleased violet pulse. It warms to him, like a child; grateful.
Love is enormous.
Harry wishes Draco wouldn’t say things like that. Things that thrust them both into a deep, cold lake of absolute truth, filled in with all the brittle anger of their youth—misguided, abundant—and floating, on the surface, some new understanding; being straightforward.
Harry settles further back in the chair, the wool of his coat consuming. Mouth fixing a grin. “It’s true. I’m casting a spell over the line as we speak.”
Harry meets Hermione’s gaze, head-on. It’s searching, gentle. Dear and familiar. She reaches out a hand to his. “Tea?”
They all know what he knows. The fixing he’s best at is far: Far from people, far from desks and paperwork and the misguided savior complex; fixing in the dormant things, in the fallen things. That’s what he knows. That’s what he needs.
And this makes Harry heat in the cheeks, a thrill—a fear?—spilling down his spine. There was still a modicum of room in his mind to be convinced that Draco was straight; that he would someday marry a well-bred witch, produce a line of white-haired Malfoy heirs; that the way his eyes sometimes fell from Harry’s eyes to Harry’s lips was just a just a trick of the light.
But Ron—like Harry, like Hermione, like the rest—had come to a kind of peace, in recent years. And maybe it’s the peace that makes him say, “I trust you,” and nod, as though to reassure himself of this, too. “I trust you.”
“Like I said. Very different.”
“How so?”
The habit of drinking after a job started without so much as a lick of oddity. Harry had asked, once, on a whim—and Malfoy accepted. It went just the same each time; Harry tired in his bones, the kind he couldn’t quit, so he just got deeper into it. Malfoy would tuck his shirt into his jeans. They huddled in a corner booth. It’s a Muggle bar, somewhere in the burrows, sparsely populated; allows them to feel anonymous, like they’re just two people.
“Just a few weeks.”
“I’m bad at this, I told you.” Is what Harry actually says, leaving the dishes and rounding Draco’s body with his own, arms reaching for what they want to hold. “Won’t you look at me?”
In the cellar, someone weeping. Big, blue tears. A river under bound feet. Dark hair uncombed.
Love in barren things. Love in the grey, dry, bare-boned middle of winter.
“That’s—” but what is it that he can name? A cold and horrible loneliness. “Can’t it—can it be fixed?”
“You don’t have to
Malfoy stretches his wand hand, taps his floating timer. Purses his lips, a little, stutters where he stands. Then he walks over—no shoes no socks—to lean next to Harry. “What do you want to know?”
