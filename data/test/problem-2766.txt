I nod and sit him down on the other end of the table away from Hermione. She watches us softly as I summon him a full plate of warm potato soup. He gives me a careful smile back before focusing down to his meal. I stroke my hand through his soft hair while I stand next to him for a few seconds to make sure he is alright. But he doesn’t seem to remember or care about his clear time this afternoon, so I leave him alone to sit next to my friend again.

“Older?”
“Yes, it is,” she smiles, “At least he isn’t content to stay in bed the whole day anymore.”
“You haven’t,” I say with conviction, “I know I couldn’t.”
I am always so unsure about these types of things.
“And your mother?”
Now to the actual chapter.
“You’re dead! I saw you die!” I yell in panic.
He carefully positions the dragon on his lap, giving it one last pat, before his right hand stretches out to the food again. But while usually he would be heading directly for the croissant, not that he normally moves far, today his hand seems to be going slightly past my outstretched one. At first I think that something is wrong or that he has problems focusing this morning. Then I realise that his hand, though shaky and unsure as if he questions whether he’s allowed to do that, is reaching in the direction of the tray with food still standing behind me on the table. I throw a look over my shoulder at it and a confused Hermione then back to the blonde.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I agree with you,” she says softly, “But maybe soon something will happen that will finally open the possibility to free him.”
“I am from the ministry,” he says with a nervous voice, “I have important – “
“That’s not what I would call staying away from humans,” I point to Draco who has his hand buried in the grey mane.
She smiles back, though a sad look lingers on Draco, “Hello Harry. Yeah, I felt like I needed to come. Besides I brought you two lunch,” she lifts the basket she is holding, “I am sure you didn’t find time to prepare food yet.”
Warnings for mentions of abuse, nothing happens actually, just panic attacks.
“Yeah,” I sigh, “Draco just came in, saw the green flames and got scared. It seems he made some bad experiences with fire.”
He shrugs, once again glaring, “It’s as good a time as any. I want to get it over with and I can’t be sure how much longer I will be able to think straight.”
“That’s all for you. You can have all the food you want as long as you are with me. No matter what, no matter how much. All you have to do is ask,” I choke out.
As much as I want to take him to Narcissa, that would mean bringing him to St. Mungos. Since we can’t just simply apparate to her room, we would have to walk right through the hospital. It’s crowded, chaotic and often loud at the best of times. He is nowhere near ready to go there. If I take him I either risk him panicking and having a relapse or even that the healers will try to force him to stay if he gets scared in the middle of the hospital. He could use the professional help, yes, but I am afraid of what they might do to him when they realise who he is. So I shake my head.
“What? No, I’m fine. Nothing happened to me,” she rants and waves her hands about furiously, causing me to take a cautious step away from her, “Just angry. The whole world is full of idiots!”
“I will take that as a yes,” I chuckle, “Let’s get you out of bed, shall we?”
Sorry for the still slow updates.
The blonde snorts, “You Gryffindors and your idealised worldviews,” he shakes his head, “The court will always follow whatever currently fits best. I know for a fact that my father used his power and money to sway or position judges so the court would decide whatever he preferred. And he was by far not the only one who did that. I haven’t exactly been out into the world yet, but I doubt it’s any different now. The power simply shifted and now other persons are doing it.”
“What?” he snorts, “Are you feeling sorry for me now? Stop it. I got myself into it on my own and I can deal with it on my own. I don’t need your help or Severus’ or my mother’s.”
Ron stares at her strangely while I snort into the drink I have poured myself, “It was less of a trial but more of condemnation.”
Stepping out of the front door still has him tensing and trying to pull away and return to the safety of the house and Dragon. But in the end he lets me pull him along even if he is clearly reluctant. He doesn’t protest apparating but when we appear in an unfamiliar setting, his muscles immediately tense in preparation to run away. I hold him tight without hurting him as he stares at me with wide grey eyes.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
I rub the back of my neck, “On our first meeting you reminded me of my cousin, who…” I bite my lip for a moment thinking about how to word it, “wasn’t nice to me. I had only just learned about the wizarding world and was overwhelmed. So I saw Dudley in you and wanted nothing to do with you,” a self-deprecating smile comes to my face, “But by now I’ve learned not to judge a book by it’s cover. It was a Gryffindor who betrayed my parents and I know two Slytherins who risked their lives for the light side. But at eleven I couldn’t really see past black and white.”
“Lifelong Azkaban,” I growl, drawing a gasp from her and a frown from Ron, “On the lowest level.”
Hello everyone,
However I have been driving myself insane with anxiety over my grades for this semester (because I already screwed my studies up one time and I can't afford to do it again). So whenever I wasn't working, I was diving deep into escapism by playing games, watching asian dramas and kpop videos (I'm not sure how I ended up there either). I entirely forgot about updating.
“Yeah,” I smile at the now empty door.
“S-Stay?” he asks with a very small voice.
Only to scream.
At last even Draco’s birth certificate. The official one. And suddenly I forget how to breathe as I read the official name of the child (they really have a fable for long names).
first, thank you for the kudos.
“Because Order spies were pardoned for their crimes,” I say, staring directly at him.
Her frown deepening, Hermione tries to argue but he cuts her off, turning to me and the paper in my hands, “You wanted to ask questions?”
He sighs and sets the brush down once he is finished with it. Spotting the other tool, he bends down and picks it up. Only then does he seem to realise that his left arm is in a sling. He stares at it in confusion for a moment then sighs defeatedly.
“New?” I blink at her tiredly then straighten up, “Yeah, it’s strange. Sometimes, especially directly after a panic attack, Draco is completely clear.”
“The war ended but they wanted to make your family pay. However you were the only Malfoy they could judge so they loaded it all on you,” I start.
I am just about to catch him when he turns towards the other side of the stable. Unfortunately I am still too far away and I feel Hermione’s hand on my arm before I can come close enough. Instead I only watch as I see Draco use his moving hand to push himself off this side of the stalls. I swallow. There are approximately six steps to the other side. That’s over five steps without anything to hold onto. Draco has never managed more than two without support. My eyes lock with Hermione’s but she shakes her head.
So I'm posting now because I just got out of surgery for getting a tooth implant and need to distract myself from the pain.
“I am aware you are not a therapy stable, but Draco isn’t ready for normal lessons yet either. Andrea said he should go normal riding but I can’t be sure he will make it through a whole session,” I say.
The stuffed animal is soft and pleasant to the touch. I can’t stop myself from burying my face in it even though Draco’s smell is long gone. I sigh and close the box then leave the room again. Wanting to check up on Draco before I go to sleep, I carefully open the door. To my surprise I see grey eyes staring straight at me. I freeze and give him another sad smile. Then I decide to approach him. If he’s already awake I can give the dragon to him now.
“Until they have broken him enough, I guess…” she looks sad.
“Yes,” the house elf nods eagerly, “Tilly will make sure the prisoners stay healthy, but she must never let anyone find out about it. Tilly understands.”
So I am returning home for now until I get a response to the note I left the man.
like I said at the end of the last chapter, I am really sorry for taking so long to post these chapters.
She gasps when he sees the net of lines, “Oh god, what happened to there?”
What triggers Draco for the first time is something that has happened before and if it did, it got a flinch from him at worst or nothing. It’s after breakfast and I am carrying our used plates back to the kitchen when I hear something shatter from the living room. At first I don’t pay it much attention, since Draco has dropped numerous things before and usually only waited for me to pick it up. But it abruptly ends the humming Draco had been doing and I frown. Then suddenly a yowl from Dragon sounds, which has me immediately turning back to the living room.
You nod but somehow keep silent. Strange, I would have suspected a snide remark now. If it were anyone but you I would suspect they were hiding something. But you are just like that aren’t you? You have probably lived your whole life behind a mask and with more secrets than I can imagine. I sincerely do not envy you. I think that sounds lonely. Will you ever know that I want to know all of that about you? That I want to relieve any loneliness you feel? No, you don’t. And you never will because you would never accept it and you have that brunette woman now.
“Fine,” he growls back from behind his hair and arms, but it holds a hint of shakiness.
He just cocks his head to the side again, hand still caught in mine, “I take that as a ‘no’,” I give a sad smile and lay his hand back in his lap, only to softly reach out for his left hand, “What is with your other arm?”
“Of course.”
I yawn and let her pull me onto my feet. She pushes me into the bathroom and tells me to clean up. I stare at the picture in the mirror with annoyance. My glasses are askew on my face, my hair even more chaotic than usual and my right cheek is red with the pattern of the carpet imprinted on it. My eyes have deep circles underneath them and I sigh as I splash my face with cold water.
"I was happily married? Off making little Pureblood babies?"
Nadine hugged him tightly before locking herself in. "Don't let him intimidate you," she murmured in his ear.
Harry froze in place for a moment before relaxing and kissing back. "You're just trying to shut me up so you can claim you've won the argument," he murmured.
Draco could barely stand on his own, but he followed the guard down the hallway with careful steps, keeping himself upright by sheer force of will until he stopped, freezing in place and staring in horror when the doorway to Harry's cell was opened.
Harry rolled his eyes. "That Potion tastes like death. Thinking about drinking it doesn't do much for the appetite this week."
He tells himself.
Feeling slightly numb, Draco fetches the Pensieve and brings it down to the sitting room where Harry is waiting. He puts the memory in and waits while Draco watches. Draco is fuming when he pulls his head out of the Pensieve.
“Something stupid about not wanting to ruin our friendship,” he grumbles, stabbing at his plate with his fork.
Silence fell, and the young black werewolf shook his head and got to his feet.
"What happened? I thought you were staying at Wolf's Hollow last night?"
Draco bent down and took his cock in hand before running his tongue along the underside, watching as Harry's eyes fluttered closed and his mouth dropped open in a silent moan, his nose scrunching adorably. Draco loved this seeing Harry like this, loved knowing
"Yes, I do." Harry laughed and pulled Draco into his lap. He let himself be manhandled, leaning into Harry's chest and sighing softly.
"Anything for you."
"Up here, Harry! We have some...guests. In the drawing room." Draco called down to him in a tone that sounded forcibly calm.
"I need you to promise not to tell anyone."
Hermione's hands were over her mouth. She slowly lowered them to her lap. "I—I don't even know what to think, Harry. I can't believe he would put himself at risk like that...he's crazy. Or maybe just crazy about
, he's just a nineteen-year-old boy. Sweet, innocent, free—
"I'm going to head over to my Mum's house for a bit and apologize. Will you stay with Harry and tell him where I went if he wakes up?"
"That sounds lovely," Andromeda stifled a laugh at the face Harry pulled behind Teddy's back. "Do you want to meet your cousin, Draco?"
"What other preparations do we have left?"
Kasper caught Harry by the arm. "I should be with you. You shouldn't...it's not a good idea for you to be alone with him right now."
He can’t stop staring at Harry’s bare, toned chest and abs. He has an interesting scar in the center of his chest, round and indented, as if something had to be severed from his skin there. There are a few other, more normal-looking scars here and there, presumably from his exploits as an Auror. They make him look just a little bit wild, dangerous, and Draco finds himself wanting to ask about them. He wants to know how Harry got each one, and then press his lips against them, as if he could somehow kiss them better, and then his mouth would travel lower, down his stomach and over those incredibly defined hip bones, and…
for this.”
Draco gasped, pulling away to drag Harry's shirt over his head to touch more skin, losing himself in the feeling of Harry's mouth, the way his hands were traveling over his back, nearly forgetting his determination to make his feelings and his desires known. "Hmn, darling, that's—oh
.” Ginny rubs his back while Blaise holds him through his choked sobs. “You know none of this is your fault, right?”
Draco laughed and slid his fingers into his hair. "Yes, darling.
“Okay,
The sight of it makes his stomach turn, even though the potion itself actually doesn't taste too bad; a bit like vanilla frosting.
“I’m protective of
Harry grinned. "Me too. Sorry, I'm getting paint on you. Let me just...
Harry lifts up onto one knee to kiss him again, less chastely this time. Draco stops him when starts to feel himself getting lost in it. He presses against his chest with a firm hand and breaks the kiss, panting against his mouth. “Harry, we can’t. Not tonight.”
should have mentioned it. He must've realized you didn't—"
"Um. Floo Molly? She has that clock that says where her family is at all times..."
Ron stopped short, taking in the blankness behind the Minister's expression, and he shuddered, despair flooding through his entire body.
After what felt like hours, but was really only a few short minutes, everything went quiet.
"I love you, too," Draco sighed. He kissed Harry softly and settled against his warm chest. "Happy to be back."
"Thank you."
"I wish I could be there with him."
“Don’t even joke about that,” Draco hisses, flushing red.
"Shall we?" Draco asked, tugging Harry by the hands.
anyone else."
"That is good, sir. Master Harry is a good master. He pays Jenkins very well, and tells him to take as many days off as he wants, and always speaks kindly to him, even though he is not being well. Jenkins would like him to get better very much."
"Merlin. Mia-Rose, run back down to the kitchen and get this man some food and water, please." Kasper ordered politely.
"Harry Potter," she murmured, staring at his face. "Come in."
, why would you even look at anyone else?”
After dinner, Hermione took the little one, who was drifting off against Harry's shoulder, chubby fingers tightly clutching his shirt, up to bed.
"I know. I'm sorry, Mum. Harry was upset with me, too. I promised him I wouldn't do it again."
Draco shoots him a wink and a smile as he goes by. "Alright there, Potter?"
"You are...completely barmy," Harry tells him between kisses. "You'll be the death of me. You drive me completely mad."
"No, that's not, er, we don't—" Potter stammered. "Nothing like that. I just need to take a statement for my report."
"Forget...?" he'd repeated slowly, stupidly, before realization had finally dawned on him. "Oh,
Draco kissed him softly, murmuring a sleepy, "good morning."

“I understand,” Draco says, and he means it. He doesn’t really know exactly what Paul does at Gringotts, but he knows that working with the goblins can be tricky and being in top form for his meetings with them is important to Paul.
“Thank you for the kind offer, but we can’t stay,” Draco says politely, and Harry shoots him a grateful look.
“You were," Draco agrees. "But we’re fine now. Apology accepted.”
Draco forces himself to bite back the words, and rolls his eyes at Harry again. “I don’t know, Potter. Just...no more secrets!”
"You are
"I know he was angry when I told him about it, but—"
Draco smiled back. "I'm glad. Although I could have done without the 'humiliate Draco' portion of the evening.
He touches the wood, pointing, and sure enough, in the bottom right corner in the tiniest writing possible are the initials "DLM."
"I can't...sit still." Harry muttered, grabbing his head and pulling at his dark hair. "I feel...strange. Stranger than usual, I mean. I have all this nervous energy, like my insides are on fire."
The other man had shrugged. "This is the job. The boss says give him Wolfsbane, give him Wolfsbane."
"Hungry," Harry smiled. "And quite a bit better."
“Alright then. Draco?”
Officially! And now it's like I don't even know you anymore!"
g, Mr. Malfoy, that I've never seen this before, and he's not responding to traditional magical remedies. It's clearly some kind of
Harry smiles back and squeezes the hand on his waist. “Yeah, it is.”
"Ron?" Hermione called out.
I shake my head, not trusting myself to speak yet, and she presses my shirt into my hand and releases my arm. “Okay. I’m just going over to the bar,” she says gently. “I’ll be right over there if you need me, alright?”
“‘S it Steve?” Harry yawns.
"Talking," Harry smiles. "Like we should have before. You were right about Jeffords and Davis. I fired Davis, and I'm keeping an eye on Jeffords, but he's being overly nervous and professional now, so I don't think it'll be a problem."
I’m drifting off on my stomach after another round some time in the middle of the night. Draco is massaging my back, and I think I must have reached some kind of paradise, because this is absolute bliss. The movements of his fingers get softer, until he’s just stroking over my skin, and I let my eyes fall closed.
"I'm aware," Draco responds absently, turning the page of his book and trying hard not to blush at Harry's clearly accidental choice of words.
Harry gives him an open smile, then downs his drink and sets the empty glass down next to Draco’s full one.
cleaned up."
"I suppose not," Ron agreed, looking pained. "I still feel guilty though."
“No, you don’t have to be there,” I reassure him, “If you don’t want to or it’s too much for you, you can stay in your room or the garden with Dragon. Does that sound good?”
For a moment silence falls and I hope he will agree because he could prove that he is indeed innocent this way. On the other hand I am not even sure if I would trust the court to accept that testament if he gave it.
Seeing the understanding in my eyes, he nods, “Aunt bad, very bad. Only when something wrong.”

Another snort and he shakes his head, “I didn’t save you.”
second chapter for today.
“Sorry we can’t help you,” Molly says.

“A potion could negatively affect his healing process and it feels wrong to put him under with a spell just so I can sleep for a few hours,” I grumble into my pillow.
“You won, I had nothing to do with it,” he shakes his head, “But it’s unimportant. I doubt I am fresh out of Azkaban, so there was more time in between my release and now. So what else did I lose?”
“Unfortunately,” I stroke his back, “But he will be better.”
“At least he screamed this time. He made his panic air instead of swallowing it down. Should we count this as a victory?” she wearily tries to see the positive side.
Oh, if only you knew. But go on. No matter how painful it is for me, I only have to bear with this for three more months. Three more months of being enemies and then nothing.
“Yes, of course,” the woman nods and hurriedly holds the door open for us.
“Didn’t you listen? Voldemort would have killed my parents if I tried anything like that. My father isn’t a good man and it would have been his own fault, but my mother didn’t deserve that.”
“Possible? Sure,” she tilts her head, “It’s only for experienced riders though. You can ride without a saddle, without a bridle or with neither.”
“Let’s just say that he did some things that weren’t entirely right when he was younger. But he was forced to do it and that included being forced to have a tattoo made on his left arm. We assume that’s the reason he refuses to move it. He doesn’t even like people touching it.”
My smile saddens but I try not to let it drop completely, “Yeah, I guess so,” he stays silent, only continuing his brushing meticulously. I watch him for a few more minutes before I speak up again, “But I found out months ago that I never knew the real Draco Malfoy. So I don’t think I can make an educated guess about what would like or do.”
“No, it’s fine,” he smiles, the same fake smile you have perfected, “I have to get to potions now. See you on Friday for the next lesson, Professor Potter.”
“Don’t. If you make a sound or approach him, you will startle him and he will certainly fall. You trusted him this far, you have to trust him now. That thing is not supposed to be used to get on a horse’s back but the steps are next to us and he didn’t want to go near us as long as he could help it,” she insists.
“I told you it was bad,” she agrees, “How is the rest working out? Did you find something to give him?”
And it is the right thing to do, I can see it. The dragon helps to stabilize Draco in the real world. Yes, he is still mostly apathetic, but at least he starts to communicate simple things like yes or no and when he wants something. Well, sometimes he does that, I can see the neglect and abuse he suffered in many of his actions. Also the way he clings to that little toy turns from endearing to painful after a certain time. There are times when he looks like he thinks that little inanimate thing is the only being that cares about him.
“Hello, my name is Andrea Jillings. Can I help you?”
She cringes, “You know you could always put him under a spell or a potion.”
“No, stop laughing at me,” he glares at me now, “Out now!”
I reach out again, trying to touch his forearm, where I know the scar-covered dark mark lays. He twitches again, pulling a face. I smile sadly.
I laugh, “Okay. Let’s play little one.”
My eyes never leave him while I slowly make my way down to the sidewalk. I pass the charms, making myself visible to everyone there. I halt and glance up at my companion. Since I can look past the charms, I can see him standing there on the steps. His eyes are wide and he is staring at the street behind me, cars moving past. For a moment I frown, maybe taking him out onto a muggle street wasn’t such a good idea. Did he ever encounter cars before?
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“The young master’s room? Tilly can do that,” she answers nervously.
He snorts disdainfully, “Having a tea party of course. I’m just waiting for Pansy to turn up.”
“Draco?” I ask, trying to get his attention, “Hey Draco, look at me,” when I see his eyes turn to me, I smile at him in an attempt to calm him, “Everything is okay. Calm down. Now, what is with Teddy?”
As for the things Harry said, this is my personal opinion on what happened in canon or could have happened, and not everyone's as I'm perfectly aware.
At that the brunette throws me a look which seems unnervingly knowing and nods, “I will help you. Maybe I can find some kind of loophole in the laws.”
I try to smile, wiping tears from my eyes, “No, not really at the moment. But he will be one day.”
“Sorry,” I say once again, rubbing the back of my neck, “But I’ve been busy. Hermione couldn’t take care of Draco and he doesn’t trust anyone else but me or her. Not to mention that I still have to prepare for the exams.”
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
“I think he mentioned it once, why?”
“So no offense, uhm, I have to ask that. When did you start to like him?”
He shakes his head, “It is fine. I always found his punishment was way too hard for someone as young as him,” he smiles a pained smile, “Besides I had a friend who suffered a similar situation. Only that he is a number of layers further up. Now I can visit him daily.”
Suddenly I stumble and would have fallen if I hadn’t caught myself on a tree a few feet further ahead. I pant, eyes closed tightly as I take a moment to regain my balance. Luckily Voldemort seems to have disappeared. Thinking myself in a moment of peace I open my eyes.
“And that is bad news because…?” I narrow my eyes at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
I fetch the tools Draco dropped and he tries to get as close to the horse as he can when I pass him. I heave another sigh and readjust his arm in the sling. He can’t move it anymore after all. He stares at me warily but his focus diverts to Andrea as she enters with a blanket. Draco keeps an arm around Shenan while she puts it on and returns with the other part of the mare’s gear. I am a bit confused when she puts it on the horse’s back.
“No, I couldn’t satisfy you anyway,” she says softly.
“Fine, I will leave it be for now. But since I am already here can you show me to Draco’s room?” I ask, anxiety creeping up my throat.
When I open my eyes again we find ourselves in the impersonal room I visited back at the Manor. It didn’t look much different when Draco still lived in it. Seems kind of lonely. When Hermione lands next to me, I exchange a look with her, only to see her frown at the room. When I turn my eyes back to front, I see the figure I have been searching for. Draco is standing there, pale like a ghost but with a determined glint in his eyes which I have seldom seen on him. Tilly is standing in front of him, looking apprehensively up at her master.
“Good evening Draco,” I stand up to approach him slowly, “Did you sleep well?”
“I am aware that I am supposed to shake your hand now, but despite the fact that you are on the good side, I am still not going to go anywhere near you. Despite the headache killing me and the nightmares, I would like to be able to think clearly for a bit longer, so I am not going near any other human right now,” he immediately covers his previous words with annoyance.
“I am getting the impression that boy has accumulated an amount of bad memories way too big for his age,” she says sadly.
Thankfully she seems to get the hint because she turns around immediately to attend a different table on the other side of the café. Draco automatically relaxes the moment she’s gone, even if it’s only minimally. His hands are shaking even worse now when he hides his face behind them again. I long to reach out to touch his trembling shoulder, but touch might startle him again, so I try to get his attention first.
“Some rude ministry employee decided it was a good idea to yell right through the house because I didn’t come to the door fast enough. Draco heard it obviously and panicked. I had to force him asleep. But he came out of it better than we hoped. I wouldn’t have come if he was too bad.”
“NO!” I fight the urge to vomit, “Of course not,” I glare at him, as I see one of his nails break his own skin, causing blood to trickle down his arm. He doesn’t seem to notice the pain, “I don’t expect anything from you, except maybe that you give me another chance at being friends once you can think clearly again.”
~ * ~
“What can Tilly do for Master Potter this time?”
“So he kept you up last night. What happened if I may ask?”
Only to nearly crash into Professor McGonagall once I come out, “Slow down, Mr. Potter,” she frowns, catching herself on the railing, “I was just about to get you. Everyone else is leaving. Is everything alright?”
“Wander around the neighbourhood all night with no clue as to where your ward is,” she grins before waving her wand over the device, “Let’s go.”
“I won’t,” I say, “All I want is to get him out of there.”
His mouth opens in shock but it closes again without him getting a word out. Back in school I would have revelled in the fact that I managed to shut him up, but now it only fills me with sadness. And fear that he is about to disappear back into his childish haze again. But he only blinks and his eyes are still clear though extremely confused so I continue.
“But Draco – “
“No, he’s still in the living room. But go ahead. I already gave him dinner,” she waves past her in the direction of said room.
“I agree, but could you at least outline his medical state.”
“Of course,” I smile, ushering him into the kitchen, “What would you like?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny and I are starting to drift apart as well. I try my best, but it just doesn’t feel as right as it did once. She is still fawning over me and I am getting annoyed by it. As soon as all of our children are at Hogwarts I spend as much time there as I can. She is angry because of that, but to hold up our marriage we stay put.
“Yes, delete them or at least pull them out of his brain like you do if you want to use them in a pensive. Or are they not accessible if his mind is still shut down?”
~ * ~ end of memory ~ * ~
“No,” she throws another look towards the door, “But at least he looked better than the visit I did from when he first arrived and the memories of the following weeks that you showed me.”
“Draco,” I sigh in fond exasperation, “Please let me go. I’m tired and I want to go back to my bed to sleep.”
Instinctively I feel Draco push against me, towards the animals once again. I smile sadly at the woman.
“Malfoy,” I ask carefully, “Are you still with me?”
I am reading through one of the books I got from my teachers in the healing classes. I decided to become a healer in the end. Even though both Hermione and Ron urged me to become an auror like I said in 5th year. Everyone thought I would apparently. But I have had enough of fighting the bad guys for a lifetime from these seven years. I needed to do something else. As a healer I can help people just as well and don’t have to throw curses ever again. I spent about half a year after Hogwarts not sure what I wanted to do but then I went to Malfoy Manor again and nicked some of Draco’s healing books (together with the drawing of the horse and some of his sketches). I read some of them and found it interesting. That’s when I decided that healer is the job I want to do. Two months ago I have started classes and I enjoy them.
“I… You…” I stumble over my words. Unfortunately I totally trust him to just walk off and try to find the right room, getting into all kinds of trouble on the way, more likely to hurt himself than if I show him and let him have his way until Andrea finally arrives. I can see no other humans in the stable and the patient I saw earlier is going to be in one of the riding halls for some time yet. So I just hope it’s going to be alright.
“You don’t know how it feels like,” he shakes his head into the shoulder of my coat, “When the doorstep seems like an unpassable hurdle and so much as going outside is as scary as facing Voldemort. When you’re afraid of every person who passes you, because you automatically think they could hurt you, even children who don’t even reach your knee yet.”
“Alright, alright,” Draco cuts her off. “I get it.”
As the rest of them crowd his bedside, she surprises Draco again by walking over to him and pulling him into a tight, motherly hug. When she releases him, she goes up on tiptoes to kiss him on the cheek, too. “Thank you,” she whispers. “Take care of my boy.”
"It is better not to be. The screaming and cracking of bones is not being pleasant to listen to. Then the wolf howls and whimpers through much of the night. The sounds is most disconcerting, sir."
He looks up at Draco with gratitude and something akin to wonder on his face, and Draco realizes that he’s still straddling his hips. He scrambles off of him and pulls him up by the hand.
best friend and I wouldn't notice?"
Draco tugged his own clothes off swiftly, and Harry stretched him with his fingers while they lay under the thick quilt to keep Draco warm enough, but when he was ready Draco let it fall away, shivering slightly as he slowly sank down onto Harry's cock, his nails digging into his chest.
They have just enough people interested in playing for two teams, and two talented Seekers who have set their intense school rivalry aside for the most part, with one exception:
"I can see that," Harry snapped. "Why not?"
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco watching him anxiously. They were on the floor in Draco's new potions lab, and he was cradling Harry's head and upper body in his lap.
body, and Draco
Harry swallows hard and runs a hand over his face, looking equally upset. “Stay friends? Date other people?”
The boy nodded tearfully, clinging to Harry's hand like a lifeline. "I thought you were gonna die."
They sat in silence for a little while before Harry drifted off. Draco stayed with him, moving to an armchair by the fire and reading a Potions Theory book he'd picked up on his last trip to Diagon Alley.
"The Falcons are going to crush you tonight, Potter," Draco leans over and hisses in his boyfriend's ear at the end of breakfast. "That Snitch is
"How are you and Harry doing?" Hermione asked curiously as they sat down to eat.
He heard the front door open and close, and footsteps down the hallway. Harry rushed into the sitting room, bags full of takeaway in hand, and stopped short at the sight of Draco standing awkwardly in the middle of the room.
“Oh, Apparating was a
"Good," she smiled tentatively back. "I don't know how I'd make it right now anyway."
"You understand," Laith spoke for the first time in over a day. "If I ever see either of you again, I
"Can you blame me?" Draco nipped at Harry's ear. "You get so intense when you're all fired up. I used to rile you up at school just to see you like this."
Harry and Draco both blush. “That isn’t
He hates Harry Potter, Draco decides.
true," Nadine said calmly, shooting Harry a warning look. He forced himself to physically relax his stance, and the three men on the sofa relaxed in response. "We considered the idea carefully, but we decided in the name of safety we can't have multiple competing werewolf packs on the grounds, that could lead to disaster."

Violet considers for a moment. “Making friends. Learning magic. Oh! Finding out which house I’m in!”
"Mm. Or..." Harry steered him toward the sofa, and Draco laughed.
I can't resist. I bend down to press a kiss to the crease where the feathered tail curves, where his bum and thigh meet. Then another, and another, kissing and sucking up to his lower back until Harry grunts and lifts his head up off the pillow with a sleepy whine.
A small curly-haired head peeked up at him from around Harry. Draco smiled at the pajama-clad boy sitting on Harry's other side. The child ducked his head, hiding his face against Harry's arm. Harry grinned down at the little boy, obviously relishing the favoritism. Truth be told, Draco didn't mind at all. He knew Harry was good with kids; It was one of the things Draco loved about him.
"Well, now you
Harry hesitates, taking a moment to respond. "I thought that was what you wanted. I could tell you were trying to get a fresh start, I didn't want to muck it up by re-instigating the famous Potter-Malfoy feud."
"I know. I'm just repeating what
Draco laughed caustically and turned away. "Right, that's a good one. No one cares enough to worry about me. What do you need for your report so I can go back to having a break down in peace?"
, I remind myself. You can’t have him, because
Harry shook his head, still averting his gaze. "I—I can't...I don't understand how you can want this. I'm a monster," he whispered, agony dripping from each word.
And then, sometimes he wasn't, and Draco found he liked that, too. Sometimes, Harry's eyes were sad, and he was withdrawn, and he snapped at Draco when he tried to ask why. And while that in itself wasn't pleasant, it helped, knowing that Harry was human, that he wasn't the perfect paragon of heroism that he was made out to be, because Draco was far from perfect himself, and he knew it better than anyone. But Harry didn't make him feel like he needed to be perfect anyway, being around Harry was just...easy.
"I'm sure. Do you both agree to my terms?"
"I can't believe you left like that earlier, Draco.
"Working obsessively on the next batch of experimental Wolfsbane. He's not going to rest until we all wake up fresh as daisies the  morning after the full moon, I swear."
“I need to, I mean, anything from my parents is priceless to me. But I don’t know if I can—”
Harry shrugged. The dungeon was secure enough, and Thomas wasn't in the house.
"Get this off. I want to see your tattoos. Has
Troll nodded, and Curly left the room and returned a moment later with a glass. Draco held the cup to his mouth. "If I drink this, will I die right here in front of you? Wolfsbane is even more poisonous to humans, you know."
Harry smiled and crossed the room to hug him, too. "Thanks, Ron. I..." Harry swallowed hard. "I love you both so much. And Rosie, too. Give her a kiss for me when you see her tomorrow, will you?"
as a constant hanger-on."
"Make me
“We were friends by then,” Draco fills in. “But that was all.”
She folded her arms and looked him right in the eye. "Exactly."
“I know.” Harry forces a weak smile. “Anyway, Dudley wrote to me. Apparently his parents, my aunt and uncle died unexpectedly a few months ago. A
“Yeah,” Harry yawns, wrapping an arm over Draco’s and running a thumb along the inside of his elbow in a soothing motion.
"Help?" He called after a moment. "Please! I need help! Is anyone there?"
"We may not have a choice, sweetheart," Harry murmured in response, pressing his lips to Draco's temple and pulling him into a tight embrace. "We really may not have a choice."
"Tell me everything that happened yesterday after you left. We were worried sick, and Draco told us some of it, but...I want to know your side. Are you doing okay with all of this?"
"Oh, that's
"He left," Ron sighs.
"Volde—
“What are friends for?” Harry hops off the edge of the counter, vanishes his now-empty container, and pulls on his Auror robes. “I’d better get back to the DMLE.”
Harry, a seductive smile and a stupid little eyebrow raise over his drink.
Narcissa's eyes shone, and she leaned over and took Harry's hand in hers, giving him a watery smile. "I would like that, Harry. Thank you. You know how much I love what you've done with that house. It's absolutely lovely."
"Fucking hell Harry, do you have any idea how hot that was?" Draco grabbed his fiancé around the neck and pulled him into a fierce kiss.
“I know I’ll need to deal with the emotional fallout from this, probably get in contact with my Mind Healer again, but tonight...I don’t want to think about it, Draco. I want—”
Harry followed the two Malfoys down the stairs, groaning internally. Just what had he gotten himself into?
“So, do you remember your name?” Draco asks in a teasing voice.
“Can we go to Ollivanders next?” Teddy asks, jumping up and down excitedly in front of them, his fitting complete.
“I would have asked for permission to touch you,” Harry whispers back, going up on one knee, his free hand moving around to rest on Draco’s thigh in the space between them, then sliding up to rest on the waistband of his bottoms, waiting.
"I would be a good mate for you, Harry. How long has it been since you were with a woman?"
"Let's find a way to release some of that pent up tension, shall we?"
She grabbed her wand and scourgified both herself and the giggling baby.
Draco stomped into the house, snow swirling in after him before he slammed the door shut behind him, huffing angrily. He untied and tossed aside his boots, then tore off his wet cloak and tossed it on the coat rack before storming up the stairs.
Clearing my throat, I look at him, “How about we get you cleaned up now? You desperately need it,” I say, standing up and taking his hands again.
“Hey, Draco. Good morning. How are you today?” I try to act as normal as possible with him first.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
I want to argue but her eyes are blazing so all I can do is nod and agree.
“Good,” a great deal of tension leaves Draco’s body, “I knew I could trust you.”
Grey eyes flit nervously to me and back to Dragon as I help him lay down under the covers again.
“I am,” I say without a doubt.
“This is about my mother!” he glares, but his eyes waver in a way I don’t like.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
Disclaimer: I don't own any of them.
“He’s a pretty one, isn’t he?” Voldemort nearly coos, causing a violent shudder to run down my back. The dementor hand comes up, sickeningly caressing Draco’s overly pale skin and I want to throw up, “Yes, very pretty. Such a nice young body, though he really looked better back then,” I feel more sick with every word he says, the question whether that actually happened to Draco coming unbidden to my mind, making everything worse, “But do you know what was the best about him?” one finger traces Draco’s blood-empty lips and I want to scream or do anything but it’s like I am completely frozen, “The way he screamed. Such pretty screams. He held out quite some time,” an evil smile, “But everyone breaks eventually and it was worth it,” his eyes wander up, locking with mine, and he smirks, more like flashing his teeth at me, “Do you want to hear it?”
The afternoon of the next day I meet up with Hermione for tea and biscuits. It’s a sunny day so we are sitting outside, watching Draco play with the cat in the backyard. He is waving one of the animal’s toys above it’s head, always moving it out of reach when white paws make a grab for it. A careful smile is on the blonde’s face and he is making humming noises in the back of his throat.
I blush. Do you need to point that out? There is some little thing nagging on my conscience at those words, but I ignore it. I never slept with anyone. Also something flashes through your eyes. I can’t tell what it is but it seems nearly like hurt or plain annoyance.
“It was not our fault. The Ministry was just following protocol,” he attempts to argue.
(See the end of the chapter for
Shaking my head free from thoughts of silver-blond hair and grey eyes, I decide that there is nothing to be found in these papers anymore. At least not for now. So I will return to the passage of caring for the prisoners for today. Luna was kept there and I am long overdue of paying her a visit. So I clean up, putting the papers away. After a short visit to the bathroom and putting on some fresh clothes I apparate away.
So instead she steps next to me with a sigh. Shenan’s gallop is calm and slow. He lets the reins go and for a moment I think that his strength ran out but then I realise it was on purpose. It takes two rounds of gallop before I suddenly see his eyes flicker. And he seems to notice it too as he carefully slows the horse down without ever recollecting the reins. She slows to a trot and then a walk, whinnying softly. He strokes her neck for a moment, teeth gritted. I can basically see him fighting with himself and his tiredness. I also see the moment he loses the fight as the light goes out of his eyes and he slumps in the saddle, nearly loosing balance to the side as well. I stabilise him with a nonverbal spell because neither of us is close enough to catch him.
~ * ~
“Well, I’m simply different than you,” he mumbles lowly, making it difficult for me to understand him.
“Never thought you would,” she waves it off, “But you would be happy if he did, right?”
I hate Online-University. This really sucks. (And it's only been a few days) Not helped by the fact that it's a huge chaos at my university.
He shoots me a look that is trying very hard to seem annoyed but to me panic sounds more appropriate. He makes a sound like a growl, I would say he is frustrated with himself. But in the end he does a step back and lets me open the door. I move past him slowly before passing the doorstep. I don’t walk any further though, remaining on the top step. The sidewalk is still a few meters away and we are still inside the protection charm so none of the people walking past can see us. The moment the door swung open and the sounds of the street flooded in, Draco stiffened, doing half a step back before he can stop himself. He looks caught somewhere between fear and determination. Not exactly knowing what to do I wait patiently for him to make his move.
“He was, but we agreed it might be better if he didn’t come to Grimmauld Place with me. You know, just in case Draco was up. Even if he’s better, introducing new people into what he considers a safe environment might not be a good idea. Especially not Ron,” she explains.
Immediately he stiffens, fingers digging too hard into his left forearm, “Are they asking whether I started spying before I was marked or after? Because I was marked during the holidays between fifth and sixth year, but I was already working with Severus before that,” he grounds out.
“Dako not good?” he gives me a sad pout.
Smiling, she pets my hand, “And is there someone like that? You seem pretty sure about it.”
“It’s already past noon?” I just stare at her.
“Kitty,” he says energetically as grey orbs turn to him again. He lifts Dragon higher who gives a protesting sound but is ignored by the two boys. “You. Kitty take,” the toddler insists, “Look sad. Kitty make better.”
Eventually he relents and lets me lead him. I just shake my head fondly.
Returning to the living room I am greeted by a petulantly mewling Dragon. He is staring up at me with demanding eyes. I snort and bend down to lift him into my arms, stroking the cat’s back.
I spend a happy weekend at Andromeda’s. Teddy mostly keeps my mind off more morose topics. Thanks to that I am in a much lighter mood when I return to Grimmauld Place Sunday evening. To not startle Draco any further than necessary I enter through the front door instead of using the floo. Hermione meets me at the top of the first stairs.
“Yes…” she mumbles absentmindedly, “Actually no,” she sighs. Her pale face comes up to me, pained eyes meeting mine, “Look I know how important he is to you,” she starts and I feel a lump forming in my throat. Whatever she read, it’s not good. I fear that there is something really wrong with Draco. She swallows and stutters finally out, “But it may be better to let him go…”
“Why?” he bites back, head finally moving as grey eyes peek over his arm, “Complaining that your prisoner escaped? Did you get in trouble with your boss?”
“Sure. Even if I did, I would just spend all my time worrying about him either way,” I snort, “Not to mention I want to be there when he becomes conscious again after today’s event to see how bad he really is.”
Dragon uses the moment the blond pulls him away a bit to scramble over the man’s arm up to his shoulder to settle there. He curls around Draco’s neck, looking a bit like a furry neck-warmer. It’s by far not the first time I have seen this but I find it cute every time. Teddy though is already bored again and sorting Draco under ‘adult’ (not that his mind is much further than the toddler’s but Teddy can’t know that) which means he is allowed to go into the backyard as long as he takes him. So he tugs at the blonde’s leg again. Hand clutching in soft white fur, grey eyes turn back to the child who distracts him from his panicked staring at Andromeda.
My first thought is that someone kidnapped him for revenge, but there was no breach in the security barriers. It makes little sense. When I arrive back in the entrance hall, I realise that Draco’s coat and an old hat that was on the shelf there are gone. He must have taken them. Did he… leave on his own? It would work since the security only blocks attempts to get in, not getting outside. But why would he do that? We discussed that he was nowhere near stable enough to go out on his own and he agreed that he wouldn’t try. Was he taken after all?
I know I'm repeating myself, but english is not my native language. So while I used to ride as well, I do not know any riding specific vocabulary. Online dictionaries couldn't always give me a translation either, so I blame it on Harry not knowing anything about riding i some descriptions sound a bit strange.
“He would huddle in the corner and freeze or at worst scream,” I sigh, “His reaction is flight not fight. The worst he can do is scare Teddy by screaming his ears off because he accidently hit him with something.”
“It must be hard for you,” she says sadly.
He shudders, “You always had luck and your friends on your side.”
One hand never leaves his back as I steady him in the bathtub. He is sitting still, slightly slumped, apart from the occasional movement of his hand, splashing water a bit. I summon toiletries, towels and additional water over. Carefully I wet a cloth and then look at his face in confirmation for a moment, but he doesn’t react in the slightest, only stares straight ahead. I sigh but put the cloth to his back anyway. He doesn’t even flinch. I run the material half-way down his back, only for it to come back completely brown with a worryingly reddish tint immediately. I shudder at the amount of dirt on his skin. And I am worried that a large part of that dirt is actually dried blood. With a deep frown I put the cloth back in the water, colour releasing into the fluid.
“Not to mention, I realised that rejecting you back then might have been a mistake,” I shrug, now unsure as well, “A lot of things would have been different if I hadn’t.”
“I feel like it,” I groan.
“No problem,” she says as I run down the stairs, waving over my shoulder.
~ * ~
“Draco? What did you just say?”
Thank you for the comments and kudos.
I smile back carefully, “None taken. And no, it’s not for me. It’s a… friend of mine. But he,” I clear my throat uncomfortably, “He‘s not in any state to come here on his own.”
I nod but before I can say anymore soft steps are coming down to the room. Cautious silver eyes peak around the doorframe. I smile brightly at him.
“Yes, he didn’t recognise me at all,” her hands clench as well and her eyes turn wet, “He doesn’t seem to recognise anything. He just stared into nothing. There was no life in his eyes at all. When I came to his cell I greeted him more than loud enough. But all he did was turn his head in my direction and give a small bow. The smile he gave me was as if he was completely elsewhere. Not that I have ever seen him smile at all. I tried to talk to him but he didn’t react. My words didn’t even seem to register in his brain. He barely recognised his name. It’s like his complete soul is gone. The only time he even said anything was when he muttered a ‘Bye’ when I left. Most of the time he didn’t even seem to register that someone was there to begin with.”
To my surprise though, I suddenly feel a cold touch on my neck. I jerk up, only to meet empty grey eyes. Draco is looking straight at me. It’s his hand that’s laying on my neck, bony fingers running slowly into my hair. I choke on another sob and bury my head back into the cold skin.
Thank you for the comment.
“Who Harry?” her eyes are watering, “If you think about it, who does? From his goons one is dead, the other in Azkaban. Pansy is in prison too. Blaise fled the country. His mother is in a mental institution and wouldn’t recognise him even if she saw him. His father is dead too, not that he would be helpful. I can seriously understand if he would just want to be left alone after a whole life spent in pain.”
My fingers clench, “Are you sure you’re up for that right now?”
I sigh, “Yes, he was a right asshole at that time. Typical pureblood upbringing. He thought he was better than everybody else. I refused to let him drag me with him. Probably bruised his ego and he was pissed at me from that on.”
"Hmm?"
"I know," Draco tilted his face up and kissed him softly. "I don't like it, either." Tossing his hair over one shoulder, he propped himself up on Harry's chest again, smiling down at him. "I love you," he said, brushing his fingers over his cheek.
“He’s great, though,” Draco sighs.
A week passed, and nothing they tried seemed to be working. Hermione pleaded with McDougal at work, but no one was interested in listening to her, especially not McDougal, who was extremely proud of himself and bragged to anyone who would listen about his takedown of the Great and Powerful Harry Potter. She tried to get in to see Kingsley, but that suddenly seemed impossible as well.
Her maternal instincts screamed at her.
“What are
Draco doesn't even notice him leave as he watches Harry storm from the room.
"Fuck," Draco moans, thrusting his hips up against him. "Do it, Harry. Mark me, I'm yours."
very grateful for the break from it tonight.”
Draco dropped his suitcases to catch him as Harry threw himself at him, flinging his arms around his shoulders and burying his face against his neck, breathing in deeply before pulling back to kiss him thoroughly.
"Seems a bit inappropriate, but okay..." Harry smirked down at him, raising a dark brow. He pressed down harder, running his hands down Draco's back and making him gasp.
•••••
"Hm. Definitely," Draco yawns.
I'm dizzy with desire, and Harry,
"Do you want to talk about it?"
Draco leans forward and presses their lips together in a slow, sweet kiss. After a long moment, Harry sighs contentedly and slides down the bed just enough to tuck his head under Draco's chin.
"Yeah, I'm..." Harry hesitated. "No. I'm not. I knew it would be that way, but it still... It still hurt, you know? And I was caught off guard because I didn't realize my Glamour had slipped, and I just wasn't ready. I should have listened to you. Ron and I could have stayed here and had a good time."
"Has he been awake yet this morning?" Ron asked, summoning the chairs by the fireplace over so that he and Hermione could sit beside the bed.
“It’s fine,” Draco answers carefully. “I like having access to the potion ingredients I need. I’m considering expanding, creating a pre-brewed potions division. That’s where my passion really is. Well, that and inventing my own potions.”
“Oh, definitely. I miss Teddy when he’s with you, but I don’t miss the horror of putting him to bed.”
Hermione scowls at the memory.
“At first he would get annoyed by my fame, as if I have any control over it in the first place, and then he seemed to accept that, but then he started wanting me to, I dunno, ‘capitalize on it,’ as he liked to call it. Use it to our
He took Draco's left hand and tenderly pressed a kiss against his engagement ring.
"But you
"You don't have to be rude to them," Harry frowns. "They were just giving me an update on their current case."
"I need to finish putting up the outdoor playground for Thomas and Marie, and I still need to hire our Security Officer so I don't have to keep the Wards in place all on my own and we can stop taking turns doing rounds at night. I'd like to do some more work in the North Wing, but since no one is living there yet, that can wait. I finished the school classrooms on the second floor last week."
“Potter Residence!” Draco calls, and Harry’s living room comes into view. “Harry?”
"You learned to cook...for
"Yeah."
"Hi Harry," Ron gave him a somber little smile and continued healing a dark bruise on Harry's shoulder.
Narcissa was looking around the room curiously. "I haven't been in this house in years, but...I don't think it's ever looked this good. I love what you've done with it, Harry."
Harry pulls him into a fervent kiss, and Draco leads him toward their bedroom to celebrate their engagement properly, hoping that at least this once, Harry's Halloween wasn't too bad.
Harry felt a rush of guilt. "I'm sorry, Ron. I meant to tell you. I didn't know how you would react, so I put it off. And I fell in love with him so slowly, I was completely caught off guard by it when I finally realized."
I nod.
Harry grins. “You did? That’s great, Teddy.”
Draco sends Teddy to use the bathroom before they leave, and Potter turns those piercing eyes on him.
Back in their room, Draco pushed Harry down on the bed and kissed him hard.
Draco blushed and pushed Harry onto his back. "Flattery will get you everywhere, Potter," he smirked, brushing his lips against Harry's in a sweet kiss.
position and all."
"Would you mind lighting a fire?"
doesn't he
Grace dropped, her knife clattering to the floor with her, and the atmosphere of the room changed immediately.
Even though the response was a serene, "Of course, Harry. Whatever you want," from Grace, Draco could tell the werewolves were immensely pleased by this request.
I know how, of course. I’d cut myself off from the news, from everything, while I was gone. And Ginny...well, obviously Ginny knew. She chose not to tell me, I realize. Not out of spite, though. At least, not spite towards me…she probably thought she was protecting me.
Harry barked out an incredulous laugh. "This one literally changed my species."
"Everyone knows that Harry left the Aurors a few months ago, but very few people know why."
"I'm awake," Draco groused, his eyes still closed, "I just don't want to be."
"I know," Draco pulled back just enough to kiss him. "You defended me, and us, beautifully. And you finally got through to him, I think. See? I told you he'd come around."
"Harry!"
“Get out.”
"Don't let him order any more of that rubbish. It's highly addictive, and it can be extremely dangerous if abused."
He shook his head and continued doggedly, his eyes on the ground. "I'm not going to let you bond with that monster just to

Harry yawned and flopped onto his back, stretching his arms over his head. "Yeah. What do you want me to play?"
"Draco? Is everything...?"
“Drunk you was
Harry turns back to look at the potion, then glances at his watch. “Thanks, Draco. I’d better get going, Teddy will be getting out of school soon. I promised him we could go to the Burrow and help Molly bake cookies tonight.”
"Well, that explains why I was given the day off," Ron spoke from the doorway, where he was holding Rose. "They brought the entire Auror force, except one."
Robards had waved an impatient hand. "I know. The DMLE has checked into it several times. Listen, Potter. I'd like to speak to him before you go forward with this plan to come out, alright?"
"I know," Harry smiled.
"You have chills?"
Harry doubles over, laughing even harder.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, I heard them again. It's happened early. It's not...this isn't...they're not expecting..."
clear message to the boy about what you think about what his father was."
They lay on their sides on Draco's bed, slowing everything down and kissing languidly, their legs tangling together, until Draco pushes Harry onto his back and speeds things up again. He ruts down against Harry a few times, drawing gasps and moans from them both, then takes both their cocks in hand and starts pulling them off together.
"No," Draco sputters, "the other one."
She smiled at him, gently taking his hand and squeezing. "I'm sure he feels the same w—"
"Draco?" She came running into the room, stopping short at the sight of his devastated expression. "What's wrong?"
"Well, you did seem much better after the last one, test subject number one." Nadine teased.
be bad," Draco laughed.
She shoved Draco at Harry, who shrugged and kissed him.
"Why?"
"Da-da."
•••••
"But what about Aunt Ginny's birthday party?"
"Mhm."
"Right. Thanks, Gin."
Draco can’t bring himself to explain it to him though, so he feigns confusion when Teddy storms up to his room the second they get back to Grimmauld Place and screams that he hates them both before slamming the door.
Harry wakes slowly, and the first sensation that registers is an overwhelmingly peaceful feeling. He's warm, and comfortable, and someone who smells incredibly nice is playing with his hair.
give in. They had no idea what they would be walking into.
"Don't scare me like that," Harry huffs, trailing a hand through Draco's hair.
"'Mione?"
Draco blushed. "So I heard." He cleared his throat. "Well, it's a good thing I don't know how to use them, because otherwise I'd have left you for that Tornadoes Chaser Garrett Porter long ago. Fittest man I've ever seen.
I’m not going to like it, whatever it is. “Hang on...unless...take your shirt off.”
Dave had pressed his hand above his head, and Draco’s mind had drifted back in time without his permission, just for a moment, to a kiss on a sofa...a kiss that haunts his dreams, and has now turned his waking life into a nightmare in an instant.
“Why are you here, Draco?”
George came down the stairs and froze in almost the exact way his wife had at the door. "Harry Potter."
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck nervously. "You really think so?"
the rude comments he’d spoken aloud, about her entire family, if he could. Merlin, he’d been such an insufferable idiot. Arrogant, cruel, bigoted, blind—
"Great. Now go away."
"It's the Alpha, Kasper. He's in Transition already."
"She can start with these." Kasper left the room without a backward glance, leaving Harry to his own devices.
"I don't care
But Harry isn’t looking back at him like he wants to mock him, he’s smiling softly and looking at him like he’s the best damn thing he’s ever seen, as he tucks a loose strand of hair behind Draco’s ear and presses a kiss to his mouth, and Draco feels a rush of sweeping tenderness for him.
"Fine. But then you'll go see our friends?"
"Why would it
him. Right now.
"Sorry," Potter said quickly, letting go of him, "I should have asked first, but they were going for the camera, and I thought—"
"That's not — I'm doing just fine in that department, I'll have you know!"
Harry snickered and raised an eyebrow. "Somewhat important?"
“HARRY!” Teddy starts crying. “I had a nightmare, Harry!”
"Fair point," Draco conceded, shifting awkwardly before stepping forward and pressing the tray into Harry's hands. "But I did today, and I think it turned out alright. Well, except the toast."
"Um, mate with him? Merlin, there just
...soon. “You can just Apparate home.”
"Let's get you to bed," Harry murmured after a long moment.
"We used to run free in the forest, actually. But that's...well, we'll go over all that soon, I'm sure. Now we lock ourselves in the magically reinforced dungeon underneath the house. Individual cells, with the key hanging on the wall inside. In our wolf form, we're trapped. When we wake in the morning, we can let ourselves out. It's not perfect, but it works. Thomas sleeps in his room with several bolts on the door, just in case. There are old, very powerful Silencing Charms over the dungeon, so he doesn't hear a thing."
anyone else!”
"He is going to Wolf's Hollow the day before yesterday, sir," the house elf told him.
"One person can't feel all that at once, they'd explode," a voice came from the doorway.
“On his chest? No. Um, too much Dark Curse scarring. Have you seen all of his…?”
"He seems level-headed enough, if a bit young and inexperienced," Grace said.
Draco drags his mouth away to ask, “What would you have done next, if we hadn’t been interrupted?”
“Okay.”
"Hawwy!" Rose greeted. Ron looked up and waved.
Harry turned to look at her, a quiet, protective rage rising in his chest. "He hates you because you refused him?"
"The Manor?"
He'd drifted off for a couple hours some time in the early morning, but he was awake again now. He had been for a while. He blinked and rubbed his eyes.
Harry laughs, glancing back over at Draco. "I can't believe I said that. Hermione is going to
Pansy stood too, placing a comforting hand on his arm. "Alright. Listen, I could still write to him and ask for more information about werewolves, if you'd like?"
Harry nodded and tossed in another letter. No reaction in the fire this time—just parchment and ink.
That bloody tattoo is going to be the death of him, he’s sure of it.
you here without Draco? I thought the Bond was keeping you attached at the hip these days?"
She skipped back down the stairs to wait for them with the rest.
They make their way inside, Harry tucking the case and his broom into a closet off the kitchen, and then he places the order for their food by Owl while Draco continues, and fails spectacularly, to avert his eyes from the tattoo on his back.
"Merlin's bollocks," Ron groans as they head back down the stairs to the Common Room. "I wish there was Firewhisky at this party. I want to forget I ever saw that."
"Will you stay with me?" Harry asked, childlike and subdued.
"Just a simple massage technique I learned, I wasn't sure if it would help, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to experiment."
Draco's eyes lifted to meet his friends. "You're going to tell me what that note was about?"
Instead, he dipped his head and kissed Harry firmly on the lips.
Draco whined when he pulled away, but Harry just grinned down at him, eyes twinkling merrily.
still have to function as colleagues. Just ask him for help, then assign the case to a pair of Senior Aurors. You'll barely have to interact."
," Draco muttered, blushing even deeper.
"Thank you. Tell her that Harry fainted, and I'm taking him to St. Mungo's, and to meet us there."
Draco’s stomach growls in answer, and Harry grins. “Right, let’s get some food.”
•••••
"He's not an Auror," Harry vented to Ron and Hermione at their house a few days later after another fiery row with Draco. "He's not trained for this, they can't just send him in
Harry didn't answer, just flicked another letter into the fire. This time it burned green-ish yellow. Undiluted Bubotuber Pus, if the stench of petrol was anything to go by. Draco winced.
"Harry?" Hermione called.
"Marie will be just fine. This was a pack dispute. Do you know much about them?"
"Merlin, Potter, that's the worst proposal I've ever heard."
Draco nods and chews his lower lip. He's been trying not to think about that.
Draco spat.
Instead of the snow leopard Hermione had seen before, and was expecting, an enormous silver stag leapt from Draco's wand and canted around the room once before he dismissed it with another quick wave of his wand.
Draco sighs. “Meeting his mum went really well, I think. Brandon’s mum is American and he and his sister were living over there with her during the war before they moved here, so she doesn’t really know about, you know, who I am in regards to the war and all that. But Brandon and I had another row. He wants to meet Teddy.”
"Oh, yes, wax poetic about my arse
Harry pulled a face, but took the large vial without complaint. "I'm glad she did. She thinks of everything."
She bit her lip. "Yes, I think you should. He'll be angry with me for telling you, but it's alright, you needed to know."

“Why not get
Harry laughed and waved his wand, sending all the clean dishes flying into their respective cupboards.
blond. A gorgeous blond with mercury-grey eyes, rapier-sharp wit, easy confidence, a proclivity for sarcasm, and, secretly, the kindest heart in existence.
“Right,” Harry bites his lip over a smile as the other man turns to leave. “Thank you.”
When they landed just outside the front gates, the last thing Harry and George expected to see was a bedraggled group of werewolves, and yet, that's exactly what they found.
"Grace. We tried to fight her, but she had all the knives from the kitchen, and we... I think she took the rest down to the dungeons."
She nodded, swallowing nervously. "Draco cares about you. He deserved to know. It wasn't fair for you to keep him in the dark, Harry."
And Harry wanted nothing to do with him. Not as a friend, not as a lover, not anything.
"No," Robards sighed. "He was one of us. Unless he hurts someone, or runs wild on a full moon, I don't want you seeking him out. You have no idea what he's capable of, wolf or otherwise."
"Well, not
The woman shook her head. "I know that werewolves often band together to create packs for safety," her eyes welled up, "I know that many are thrown out and left to die by their families, especially the children, but we could
"Someone else can do it, someone who's more qualified, more experienced, someone who isn't—"
"Sod it. Lorcan can wait." Harry tossed the clothes he had been pulling out of his wardrobe over his shoulder.
Based on the clothing strewn on the floor, Ron hadn't been
"Fine. I'm going to let him challenge me next full moon. Just get it over with, you know?"
The woman was still unconscious under the blanket, breathing shallowly and shivering.
She turned back toward the stairs as Harry and Draco both called out.
Draco pulled a face.
"You want to invite over the woman who wanted to turn you over to the Dark Lord?" Draco asked incredulously. "For what? A friendly dinner?"
She slowly pushed the paper across the table, and Draco gasped.
“How can you say that? You don’t know me. Or even like me.”
"Do you want to come over and listen to the Arrows vs. the Harpies game with me on the wireless on Saturday?" Harry asked, as he cleared their empty plates from the table. "Normally Ron comes over, but he has other plans that afternoon, so I thought maybe we could get takeaway for lunch and listen together instead?"
"Draco wants to be bonded to you, Harry. It's not selfish if you both want it. And he doesn't handle jealousy well. You should know that by now."
Ron Weasley followed, footsteps heavy on the stairs. He paused on the landing outside Harry's door.
“Oh, what do either of you know about Quidditch?” Ron huffs.
"Who knew you were such a fat baby," Draco teases, even though he's seen the photos before.
The case turns out to be much simpler than originally thought, and the Aurors leave to go follow a lead, while a glimpse of Harry exiting his office sends Draco running to the bathroom to hide. He clutches his knees and takes a deep, steadying breath, sitting on the closed lid of the toilet and feeling extraordinarily pathetic.
He’s caught by surprise when Harry pulls him into a warm embrace. It’s not what he expected, but Draco relaxes into it, letting Harry hold onto him for far longer than a normal hug should be. He can’t resist, and he doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to.
Harry Potter stood up slowly, gracefully, no longer pretending to be weakened by Wolfsbane, and the older guard startled, grabbing for his wand. Harry was quicker, raising a hand and pinning the man to the wall with nothing but raw magic.
“Gods, yes,” Harry pushes Draco onto his back and straddles him, kissing him hard before pulling back to ask, “what did you have in mind?”
"The transformations? Or school? Or...what?"
he?" Ron asked slowly. "I mean, I know you don't like it, or want it, or even want to see it, but people do tend to act strangely around you. And, er, Draco
"The other reason I'm here," Harry said. "Is to formally offer your job back. Minister Shacklebolt would love to see you back in your job at Azkaban, if you're interested. He wasn't happy to hear you'd been fired in the chaos after the takeover attempt."
to know that. You're not replaceable, you never have been. I've missed you, too. I know I haven't been myself since Greyback bit me, but I'm finally getting there. And that's mostly because of Draco. So can you... Would you... Please try to get along with him? Give him a chance? He's not the person we knew at school."
"Oh, he's with his mum today, er, wedding planning."
Draco took his hand. "Come on, I'm sure they won't bite. Not until the moon comes out tonight, anyway." He added with a smirk.
It was eleven o’clock at night and pouring rain outside, so who could possibly…?
"Hi," Harry smiled at him and lowered his voice. "Be nice, please."
* * *
"Please?"
Harry was startled out of a pleasant dream by the sound of voices in his head. His vision was dark, but he could hear the conversation quite clearly.
“Oh, Merlin, I’m so sorry,” he gasps, helping the other man back to his feet.
doesn't want to know how.
Hermione dropped into the chair next to the bed.
"Carry me," he whined.
"Hmm, yes," Draco murmured distractedly, resting his chin on Harry's shoulder and looking curiously into the pot, where the fragrant curry was bubbling.
"Ah," her eyes lit up, "So that's why you're so good with my son."
Harry raised a brow and answered sarcastically. "
“Did you, ah, need anything?” Harry sets a full plate in front of him on the table.
He squeezed his own shut and looked away, unable to withstand the pleading in them much longer before he knew he'd give in. And he
Teddy draws back, wiping at his eyes and looking embarrassed. “You really were the best, you know. Both of you. I always felt loved with you, and safe, and important. Even when you were being stupid and refusing to admit how you felt about each other.”
You could have
This kiss was different from the frenzied, desperate kiss from a week before. This kiss was slow and sweet, as mouths molded together perfectly, and tongues slipped out to explore and tangle together. Pleasantly familiar, yet full of unspoken meaning.
A few minutes later, Hermione pushed the door open, looking disheveled and panicked.
"Okay," Harry stood, yawning widely. "'Night, Pansy. Thanks for coming."
George sighs and sinks down further in his chair. “That’s not your fault, Malfoy. That’s just what Harry does.”
"Are you sure that was...?"
"Well, that sounds awful," Harry chuckled. "But don't worry, Jesperson is going to catch the Snitch soon, I can feel it."
Draco shrugs and takes a sip of his butterbeer. “I know.”
“Or maybe he’s not interested.”
Draco finds himself bracing a knee next to Harry on the bed, then pulled into his lap to straddle him. This kiss has spiraled far beyond his intention, but he can’t bring himself to care. He’s so relieved that Harry’s okay, that Harry still seems to want him as much as Draco wants Harry, he can’t seem to help himself.
As if on cue, a pixie-like young woman with petite, elfish features and brunette locks chopped into a stylish bob, knocked lightly on the open door and walked in, carrying a tray. There was a bowl of water, a wash cloth, a steaming cup of tea, and a smaller bowl containing a yellowish broth and a spoon. She set it on the bedside table beside Draco and smiled at them.
"Go up to bed, darling," Draco murmured, as Harry's head slid off his shoulder and he jerked awake again.
Their quiet conversation quickly devolved into heated snogging. Clothes were quickly shed, and they kissed on the bed until their lips were swollen and bruised, grinding their hips together and letting their hands roam freely over each other's bodies, swallowing both whispered words of affection and low moans of pleasure as they both chased their release.
"What are you doing?"
Harry had kissed me again, with that fierce intensity that he'd always had, and I'd had to fight to get a coherent word out. "Want you...Mm...
Harry is nearly asleep when Draco snaps his book closed and sets it aside, patting Harry on the head like a puppy. "Alright. Up, Potter. I need to get ready for bed."
Summoning his resolve, Draco picked up his wand from where he'd dropped it beside him earlier and used it to unlock the magical locks on the door, tucking it back into its holster on his arm when he finished. And then, very slowly, he opened the door.
He turned to leave, but she jumped off the bed and wrapped her arms around his waist, gazing longingly up into his eyes.
And the sight of mounds and mounds of every kind of food and dessert imaginable piled on top of the kitchen counter and dining table stops him in his tracks. “What in Merlin’s sodding—?”’
"Well, I'm glad one of you is awake," Healer Gordon laughed.
“Are you okay?” Draco asks, cupping Harry’s cheek and looking into his eyes.
actually be that stupid," Draco snaps.
Lorcan smirked. "I'll keep your dirty little secret, Potter."
“Harry getting along with your new boyfriend?”
The rest of the criminals were safely bound by Incarcerus Charms, their wands bagged for evidence. The carefully-packaged vials of illegal potions would be taken as well, along with every other stitch of evidence in the room.
"How in the
And so, cup of tea in hand, Draco finally tells her
"Good," Ron looked a bit choked up, and Harry pulled him into a tight hug. "You deserve that, Harry. More than anyone."
Draco cards a hand through his hair, watching the jet black curls as they slide through his fingers. “So, how do you want to do this?” he asks, returning to the discussion they’d been having before they got distracted. “Do we just...tell people?”
The boy scowled, but complied and followed her upstairs.
"What?" Harry asked, his voice rough, gravelly and low. "What do you want, Draco?"
hated this stupid hospital.
"But he—"
"What about you?" Harry asks. "Have you...?"
“It worked?” Harry beams and removes his hands, smoothing the back of Draco’s shirt.
Harry cups his cheek and kisses him softly. "I only want you."
Harry's eyes go soft and understanding. "I'm sorry."
•••••
"I...um, maybe? If the right moment, er, presents itself."
Another owl flew in the window and dropped a heavy book on his head. Harry caught it, but he didn't toss it directly into the fire like he should have. The title felt like a blow to his stomach.
Draco looked up from the book he was reading when Harry walked in. He'd been working on a theory for a new potion for the past few days, several books and notes spread out across the table in front of him.
“Draco,” I call out, but in the moment that the word leaves my mouth, I realise my mistake.
“Please don’t let him hurt me again,” he whispers, breath brushing my ear, “I have hurt enough. I don’t want anymore. Just make it stop. Please don’t let him hurt me again.”
“Self-inflicted?”
“So you never wanted to take the Dark Mark?” Hermione reaffirms it.
He spends about seven minutes riding Shenan slowly around the hall in varying figures. There is one moment where I worry he has dropped off again because he slumps into the saddle, but it doesn’t take long for him to straighten up again. I have to wonder how he manages to stay clear so long and not fall asleep every time he drops off. Close to fifteen minutes after entering the hall he slowly grips the reins, carefully shortening them and bringing Shenan’s head up. The mare snorts but easily goes along with it. Once he has her where he wants her, his heels lower and he presses his calves against her side. The palomino seems to throw him a look but after a moment of deliberation starts to speed up and eventually changes into a slow trot.
I only give myself a few minutes of let her comfort me until I pull away, “It’s okay. Let’s go make some tea,” I suggest as I get up, my own legs slightly shaky.
Hello everyone,
“Why did you decide to spy?” I read off the next question.
“It is outrage,” she huffs, “What? Harry, yes, I’m okay.”
A few minutes after settling down, I feel his body shift. To my surprise I notice that while he has now turned his back to me, he has come close enough to siphon off of my body heat. His own body seems to give off only very little warmth, so I carefully throw an arm around him, in hope to keep him warm. Once again he surprises me when instead of getting nervous, he just slips his ice cold hand into mine. I smile into the cold skin of his neck, more than happy with the current situation.
“Don’t worry,” I say carefully, “Everything is okay. What happened?”
“I know, I know,” I open my arms in an attempt to reach out without forcing contact on him, “But he can’t hurt you anymore. Never again.”
Disclaimer: Not mine.
Hello everyone,
I sleep badly that night, Draco’s unspoken question of whether he can keep something as simple as a stuffed toy haunting my dreams. I am not sure whether the scenes I see actually happened like that or are just figments of my imagination. How my brain sees Draco’s abuse. I see Lucius backhanding an about seven year old child. Narzissa who jumps between an elven year old Draco and his father’s wand, only to be pushed aside. These are just a few images that run through my mind that night.
We all love Luna, don't we? ;)
She shakes her head sadly, “There is basically nothing left. Some charred ruins and nothing more. I’m sorry. The house elves made it out, none of them was killed. They were sent to Hogwarts to work there. Some of them protested quite a bit though, especially the head elf. And two others said they had to wait there until their masters returned. They swore they would do that. One of them later turned out to be Draco’s personal elf and the other was named Tilly I think,” she rummages in the pockets of her cloak and finally pulls two small boxes out. A short spell enlarges them back to normal size, “This is all they could salvage. Some small tokens and some papers. Apparently the majority of that was kept under some simple sealing. In short most of them are important papers or things that hold sentimental value.”
I can’t help but wish that one day I can experience such a scene without all that craziness. That even when he’s sane and good again, he will still let me close and maybe even let me see his vulnerable side. Him making a grumbling sound, rips me out of my dreamy state and I remember that it is high time for both of us to get some breakfast. Nonetheless I can’t stop smiling all the way through making it after seeing him walk on his own.
“But maybe we can show him that he has us now, so he will find something that is worth coming back to,” I suggest urgently.
“So this is what I look like now…” I hear his soft voice in a mix of anger and sadness.
Following the sound, I hurry out of the kitchen, teapot forgotten on the stove. A short race later lands me in the living room, looking at a not exactly comforting picture. Draco is curled in his chair, legs pulled close to his chest. A fine trembling is running over his form and his eyes are squeezed shut. Dragon is huddled under the table in front of him. The cat looks severely startled but he is already creeping out and back to the blonde again. With curiosity I watch the animal’s actions as he carefully pads towards Draco, who doesn’t seem to be registering anything going on around him. I want to help him right now, but decide to watch whether Dragon can bring him out of it on his own. The cat has reached the chair by now and gets on his hindpaws to reach the soles of the boy’s feet. He manages to nuzzle his nose against the skin. But all it earns him it another frightened squeak and Draco curling in even further (if that’s possible). The cat instinctively does a jump backwards and stares at the human with confused eyes. I sigh and walk into the room. Bending down I scoop up the small animal and deposit him on the couch.
“I hope so,” I answer and relax into her presence.
“It simply is,” she responds, “There is not one solution for these kind of situations. It all –“
I am really, really sorry for the delay, but life is being a bitch right now.
“Yes, there was a stuffed dragon in the boxes you brought. I cleaned it up and gave it to him.”
Warning for self-harm in this chapter.
“He wasn’t a death eater!” I shout, only to slap a hand over my mouth.
She smiles at me thankfully and leads me towards the tower in which the headmaster’s office resides, making small-talk while on the way. To my surprise this tower seems to have sustained little to no damage during the battle. But she explains that there are stronger wards around it which kept it from being accidently damaged. Stopping halfway up the spiralling staircase (which hasn’t been repaired to move again yet) to the old office, she opens an unsuspicious wooden door which I never noticed before even though I went up there quite a number of times. When she steps aside, I want to enter.
“Not really,” he moves his arm to the side to push his body from the ground, which clearly takes more strength from him than normal.
“Most people would disagree with you,” he glares, “After all I deserved what I got for my crimes did I not?”
“That’s good,” she sighs, “Then we should think about some steps on how to get him back to reality.”
“And today is a bad day?” I ask warily.
Sorry for the rant, but I've read it multiple times in comments (both here as well as on fanfiction.net), that something is not canon or that some character would not behave that way in the original medium. Well yes, that's why it's called fanfiction.
“Hey Draco. Have you been sleeping the whole time?”
“Still…” I smile at her.
He doesn’t give me an answer of course. Unless you count the fact that he gives me another half-squeal, letting his hand fall back into the water again. I shake my head and stand up, sending the bowl for another clean up. I stretch, that crouched position is not comfortable for long times. Just before I started on his hair, I put a spell up that keeps him upright even when I’m not holding him up. Noting that the water he is sitting in is cooling too, I reheat that as well. I hand him a cup of water to drink. He doesn’t react for the longest time and I have to push the drink further into his face to make him notice it. When he does, he lifts his wet right hand back up and grasps the handle of the mug shakily. His movements are unsure, but at least he is able to drink on his own. A small light in the dark. But as soon as he is finished his grip apparently slips and the mug crashes down. Seeker reflexes awakening I catch it before it hits the water surface.
“I can’t move,” he mumbles out, clearly disgusted at himself.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
About two days before this appointment I am interrupted by another rude ministry employee. Luckily this one has enough common sense to wait at the door until I open it. The moment I see the ministry standard clothing, I feel the urge to close the door in his face. Knowing that it will only anger the ministry further, I give an audible sigh and lean against the doorframe with crossed arms.
“Okay, uhm,” I think for a moment, “I need a cat who is not easily startled. Not by sounds, strange smells or other beings. They also need to be very accepting of humans. If it is possible that they won’t try to scratch or bite even if someone doesn’t really know how to handle them,” I tilt my head, “And one that’s friendly, that they come to the human on their own but also won’t need too much attention.”
“Why would I tell you that? So you can taunt him or sell him out to the ministry by accusing him of practicing black magic again?” he asks back with a challenging gaze.
Both of us startle badly and shoot around to see a pale Draco in the doorway. He is leaning against the frame, using his right hand to support his body against the wood. He has dressed himself in a white dress shirt, even though it looks a bit wrinkled, just like his pressed pants. His eyes are tired over the dark circles. His first steps into the room are wobbly and he takes the much longer route around the massive table just to not pass too close to where we are sitting.
“Yes, you remember that I said the ministry finally allowed me to visit Draco,” she says and dread settles into my stomach, “Today was the day they let me see him,” she takes a swallow of juice, “Not enough that they already treated me nearly like a criminal just because I wanted to visit a classmate of mine. They ran countless searching spells over me and took my wand. Only then would they let me down there. And I tell you it’s awful there. No light, no warmth, no fresh air. Only cold, damp, dark stone, bars, guards and those god-forsaken dementors. These are no human living conditions.”
“He said he used to ride without a saddle. Is that possible?”
Andromeda smiles indulgently behind us as I slide down to the floor together with Teddy. Immediately he picks some of his toys up and thrusts them at me. I grin and start following his instructions in how he wants this game to go. The older woman leaves at some point and half an hour later I can smell delicious aromas coming from the kitchen.
“Draco, you have to let go of me,” I whisper softly.
I sigh and run a hand through my hair, “No, Malfoy. Don’t twist my words. I am not keeping you prisoner. You know your mental state is not stable enough to go out into a hospital in full work. The only times you are properly calm are here and with horses. We can’t drag a horse through St. Mungos obviously. I really don’t want to risk you suffering a relapse just because you were too stubborn to wait until you are ready.”
I hope you liked the first part of 'The unknown spy'. If you want to continue reading you can go to fanfiction.net and read it there if you want. Otherwise I will try to start the next part soon, but I need to come up with a title and work my way through tagging first.
Harry reached out with both his enhanced senses and his magic. Two "guests." They smelled unfamiliar, but they both had vials of undiluted Wolfsbane on them. He wrinkled his nose in distaste and focused on listening to what was being said.
"Water," Harry rasped.
Draco wants to smack him for being an oblivious idiot, but he wrestles the urge down. “Of course I do, you dolt,” he says instead, which is marginally better.
.'" Draco wrinkled his nose in distaste. "The bastard."
"Oi! Get a room!" Ron teases, laughing good-naturedly.
Harry resisted that urge, knowing that Draco needed a minute to just breathe and adjust to being home, and then he was going to need a long rest. So, Harry forced himself to wait, tapping a foot impatiently under the covers.
Harry shakes his head. “Nah, she’ll do great anywhere.”
did this to him. To us.
The bedroom is as messy as the rest of the house, piles of boxes everywhere and clothing strewn over them, but at least the bed is set up and sort of made. None of it is up to Draco’s standards, I know, but once again he doesn’t seem to care.
"And you're half-asleep already. Go on. I'll be up in a bit."
"Maybe. I felt alright earlier, before I fell asleep."
. He was alive, and the fight was over and they were getting married and everything would be fine.
And then I turn and bolt, weaving my way through the crowd and heading for the exit as fast as my legs will carry me.
A pretty blonde woman was glancing between Harry and Draco, a calculating expression flitting over her delicate features. It was clear to Draco that she was trying to discern the exact nature of their relationship, and she didn't like what she was seeing. Each time her gaze landed on Harry, her eyes filled with the hungry glint Draco had seen earlier.
“Something like that,” I say softly. “And because Fawkes saved me more than once. And because it gave me hope that I would be okay again, after…” I hesitate, and he watches me avidly, waiting for me to finish. I take a breath and continue. “I’ve been through so much, you’d think it would take more than a bad break up to break me, but sometimes it felt like—”
one another, what the other person likes, what they need...I know that when Draco gently bucks his hips up he’s telling me he’s ready for me to start moving, and I respond without even thinking about it, bracing myself on my hands and setting up a brutal rhythm that has him clutching at my shoulders and digging his nails into my skin.
Harry glanced at his watch and resisted the urge to scream in frustration.
He carefully braided his hair, pulled on a simple set of black robes and a cloak with a hood (he still didn't want to draw too much attention to himself), and left his flat to wander the shops of Diagon Alley. Moving, even slowly as he peered in shop windows and examined potions ingredients at the Apothecary, seemed to help. Out on the street he could feel the stares, even with his hood up, but he tried to ignore them.
"Well fuck," he groaned, "
He couldn't help thinking the Werewolf Challenge and all the drama surrounding it was utterly barmy, but Hermione insisted there was old, dark werewolf magic involved that had basically forced Harry into it, whether their best friend was fully aware of it or not, and Ron knew better than to question Hermione. So he'd tried to accept the inevitability that Harry wouldn't come back. Tried to accept what had been

"That's not going to happen," Harry snapped. "And if we're going to talk about technicalities, I came across an interesting one in my reading yesterday. Lorcan wasn't supposed to be allowed to challenge me until I'd had time to adjust to my new position. A period of at least six months was recommended. Did you forget? Or did you just not care?"
"You do," Draco kissed him on the cheek and left Harry standing in the kitchen, stunned, as he went through the Floo. "See you Saturday!" He called, before throwing the Floo Powder and going home, grinning from ear to ear.
"Are you sure, Harry?" Hermione couldn't help asking. "You're a natural leader. You would be a good Alpha."
"He touted a brand new

He looks tearfully over at Draco, who is trying just as hard, and failing just as badly, to hold back his own tears.
“I knew you could do it,” Draco adds, smiling back. “There shouldn’t be anything more complicated than this on your exams.”
“Yes!” Harry squeezes his hand, trying to get him to turn back and look at him again, but Draco resists. “You know, I’d really like to kiss you, too.”
“‘Course,” Draco says, still fighting to breathe. “I’ll be fine.”
Draco followed him after a few minutes and thanked the House Elf profusely, then crawled into bed and buried his face in Harry's pillow. Jenkins' words about Harry's transformations had shaken him to his very core and made it difficult to sleep, but he eventually drifted off.
"Yeah, I had some energy this morning and I've been meaning to get a guest bedroom fixed up for when Teddy sleeps over. Put some toys in here, maybe some decorations? Ron's got him on a Chudley Cannons kick, so maybe some quidditch posters or something? Would you want to go shopping for some furnishings for him next week? I was thinking we could—"
“Finally,” Teddy sighs, grinning up at them. “
"You...
“You just did.”
The Head Healer opened the door to Harry's room and let Draco in.
"Don't you think I should get to decide that for myself?"
Harry's health improved significantly in the days that followed Draco's first couple of visits. He'd been eating and sleeping more normally, and his mood had improved markedly.
Ginny Weasley blows a whistle and tosses the Quaffle, and then they're in the air.

"Not in werewolf terms, you don't—"
Ron nodded and stepped forward, attempting to hug a stiff, unresponsive Harry. Ron drew back and awkwardly patted him on the shoulder, shifting awkwardly in place. "Sorry, Harry. I s'pose this wasn't such a great idea."

“That would be great,” Paul smiles, looking over at Draco. “As long as it’s okay with you? I was about to get something, I have an hour before my next work meeting."
Harry blushes up to the roots of his hair. “Merlin, I didn’t know there was a photographer there. I’m sorry, I meant to tell you myself, it’s just—“
"What?"
Harry grinned playfully in an attempt to hide the anxiety that had surfaced at Draco's question and was now threatening to overwhelm him. "I'm pretty sure you already
, even when Potter's Spell wore off and Officer Purling turned his wand on him.
“What?”
Draco's silk boxers join the pile of clothes on the floor, and then they smile nervously at each other.
Draco walked over to stand in front of him, and Harry forced himself to look up to meet his amused gaze.
But eventually he does, letting go of my face and staggering back, and I open my eyes to find myself looking into blazing viridian eyes that pierce right to my soul.
Draco frowned harder with each item of clothing Harry put on.
"Have you...er...what do you want our wedding to be like? Have you thought much about it?"
"It's because you're here," Grace cut in calmly, and they both turned their attention to her. "The Alpha draws strength from the pack when he or she is unwell. It's old werewolf magic, tracing back centuries. The Alpha's top priority is to protect us. If they are ill, their ability to do so is weakened. This magic ensures all of our safety. Thank you for bringing him here, Mr. Malfoy."
"Oh, um, sure. I thought...coffee table." He gestured unnecessarily at the piece of furniture.
"Like
Harry's eyes are warm and bright as he gazes back. "I don't really care...do you?"
Harry glanced over at Nadine, who had come down with him. She looked as worn and tired as he did. With the full moon rising the next night, every werewolf in the house was looking decidedly haggard.
“What does Uncle Harry
and warmth is spreading inside me from the top of my head to the tips of my toes.
I drop my hand and turn to leave, gasping sharply when he catches my wrist in a vice-like grip.
"What else can you tell me about the Werewolf Challenge process, 'Mione?"
. That man is even
him!"
Determined?"
Antonio looks incredibly uncomfortable, as the mood turns even more frigid and Harry turns and walks away without another word, fists clenched.
“Last week we were playing Quidditch, a Seeker’s match, and we decided to make things more interesting...the winner got to choose a tattoo for the loser.”
do magic, it's because they destroyed our wands. Every single one."
, Draco. And according to Ginny, he has a reputation in the professional Quidditch Leagues for fucking just about anything that moves, including Harry's ex. You remember Oliver Wood? Harry
Harry squeezed his sides, a proud, slightly smug smirk on his face. "But
"Merlin! Slow down 'Mione!" Draco laughed as he stepped past her into the house. "Harry is alright. He told me I should come. He's asleep at the moment. Resting up before tonight."
"Could you be getting sick?"
Harry Apparated to the old house and stumbled up the steps and through the front door.
to me!”
Kasper responded warmly. "Yes, Harry is here. And this is his...er, boyfriend. Draco Malfoy."
"I'm coming," Hermione insisted, stepping towards the hospital bed.
“Touch me.” Draco brushes their noses together, reveling in the hitch of Harry’s breath in response. “Harry, I’m yours.”
"Of course!" Draco said seriously. "The best cake you've ever tasted!"
"Me too."
“Yes, sir,” the man says.
When he was getting overwhelmed, he'd grip Harry's hand so hard it hurt, and Harry would take that signal and redirect the attention away from him.
"It was..." She hesitated, biting her lower lip, "pretty bad. Ron does feel bad about what he said, if it helps."
"It's...it's my daughter. She was bitten two years ago. She's only ten. I'm not judging you for whatever happened Harry, I'm just...I'm frightened for her."
Harry nodded and stood, yawning widely. "Okay."

Dean Thomas takes off with the Quaffle, the other five Chasers immediately on his tail, the Owls in orange getting into an attack formation, the Falcons in teal attempting to steal the bright red ball and get it moving in the other direction.
Draco bit back a sob of frustration as the door slammed shut between them. "I love you, too."
Draco slipped his hands up Harry's neck and into his hair. He brushed their lips together, effectively cutting him off, and Harry let out a low, visceral growl, tightening his grip on Draco's hips.
"Except with
Malfoy looked around at the mutinous faces of his men, who all had their wands drawn and ready. "I don't think they want me to do that, Harry," he slipped, but no one seemed to notice. He drew his own wand. "So, what now?"
After a few minutes, he finally pulled away. "Thanks, Mum."
"Because he
Harry did, and after weeks apart, he was more than happy to comply.
“No,” Harry says quickly. “That’s not what I meant. I just meant if you hadn’t offered I could have asked them, but you did, so now I don’t have to. I’d, um, I’d like your company. Thanks.”
Harry bent down to give him a hug. "I'll see you tomorrow."
"I always notice you. You're...hard to miss." Harry answers, chewing his lower lip, his blush deepening.
"What's going on?"
"And I'll trust you implicitly. But that won't stop me from hexing anyone who even looks at you sideways, as will be my right as your husband." Draco smirks.
“Draco?” Harry has to force his name through gritted teeth, and Draco leans over him and touches his face with gentle, gloved fingers. “I’m—so—sorry—”
She laughed. "I liked watching you play Quidditch."
Harry walked into the room with his wand held loosely at his side, a calm expression on his own face. He hated that he needed the walking cane to make it up the stairs, but he held his head high when he addressed the two Aurors in the house.
, 'Mione. I'd have done it already if he'd agree to it. I know he's afraid that I'll regret it, that he thinks he's not worthy of me or something stupid like that, but I won't. I would
"Good new?"
"Fine, but I'm coming back to check on you tomorrow. And I'm throwing out all of your Dreamless before I go. Read a book to pass the time or something, for Merlin's sake. No more potion-induced sleep. Too much of that isn't healthy and could put you in a coma indefinitely. You may be fine with that, but I,
"Good."
"Draco..."
“And leave my shirt, you cheating arsehole,” Draco hisses venomously, and Brandon’s face twists as he walks back over and throws it at him.
Hermione and Kingsley exited his office just in time to watch Harry release Ron from his bonds.
"He really is," Harry agreed with a smile. "I'll bring him back with me again tomorrow."
"Thank you, Harry, you're too kind," Pansy cut him off with a wicked grin. "But I'm afraid I'm here to kidnap Draco."
Harry grabbed a pair of pyjamas and some boxers from Draco's closet and set them on the bathroom counter as promised, then went back into their room and changed out of his jeans and tee and into a pair of soft joggers. He tugged off his glasses and tossed them and his wand onto the bedside table, climbing under the covers to wait for Draco.
