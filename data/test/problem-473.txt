"That's what I thought about
"Then why say it?"
They kissed, ignoring the disgusting morning breath.
"Okay, Harry, I'm gonna go grab some tea for everyone. Harry, it's your turn."
"Anytime, my darling dearest."
"Hey! We're Harry's best friends, you hardly know him! We'll take care of him!"
Draco slumped down into his seat in potions class and looked to the opposite side of the room to where Harry usually sat. He frowned slightly when he saw that his boyfriend wasn't there. Seeing a cuddling Ron and Hermione at the same table as said seat, Draco lifted himself off of the chair and strolled over to the other two. Once he arrived at the table, he forwent greeting them and asked,
"I'm leaving this wretched place once and for all. I just need to wait for the right time. I was able to figure out a spell to shrink all of my essential things in an instant, and all I'll need to do is put them in my bottomless bag and then use the counter-spell once I get to where I'm going."
Harry begrudgingly let go of Draco's hand and turned to look at his family. He began,
The view launched up jerkily and shook as Lucius spat in Draco's face,
"Could you not be bothered to think of a good insult?"
Draco calmed down and his breathing went back to normal. He sheepishly smiled and awkwardly turned to look at everyone else as he hurried down the stairs with Harry in tow.
Looking up, he only saw an 11 and 13 building. Figuring it was like platform 9 3/4, he braced himself for impact.
"Draco, you don't know them. They are nosy as fuck."
Before Harry could so much as get a breath in, Hemione retorted for him,
"The Dursley's hit me, and yell at me, and scold me, and punch me, and choke me, and you still say it's for the greater good? I lived in the cupboard under the stairs until I was 12. I had to run away when I was 13 out of fear of what they would do to me. I saved their son from a dementor's kiss and all I got was yelled at! I almost got hit with a frying pan multiple times! They would deny me food for days, weeks, and you knew! You knew about it! I-"
Harry nodded with a faint smile on his face,
Draco remembered all of the times this has happened before. When he had talked slightly to fondly of Cedric Diggory. When he had hesitated in killing Dumbledore. When he refused Pansy. It was an endless cycle in which his father managed to manipulate him into staying. Staying in this awful place that felt more a prison than a home. A place that scared him more than comforted him. A place where he lied more than he ever told the truth. A place where he didn't feel safe. And, he finally realized,
Dumbledore just looked back.
Harry didn't respond. Draco just sighed and kissed Harry's forehead, pulling him up the stairs and into the bedroom he assumed was Harry's.
Another crack and Kreacher was gone.
"Well, um,"
"This house is a Black estate. I'm a Black."
Ron jumped in,
Later, Ron and Hermione came back into the dorm room to grab a few supplies and check up on Harry, only to see him sleeping peacefully for the first time in a while.
He walked over to his luggage and to unpack them, but then noticed the filthiness of the room. He opted to start the cleaning process instead.
Draco chuckled a bit,
Hermione piped up in the background,
, made him feel safe and excited at the same time, something he had never felt before. This was such a perfect moment, nothing could ever stain this memory, a patch of pure white bliss on the grimy tapestry that was his life.
Draco smiled and moved position, motioning for Harry to lay on his lap. Harry crawled over and laid his head on Draco's lap, relaxing his body onto the mattress.
Harry knew.
"Thank you, Dragon."
"Much better."
Draco chuckled at the slightly morbid comment and responded,
"Oh Ronald, you have nothing to be sorry for. You did the best you could. You saved him."
"Astute observation. Tiddlywinks."
"How did you talk him out of it?"
The screen looked down at an arm--Draco's left arm--with the Dark Mark permanently inked there. Remus silently gasped when he noticed the scratches and scars covering the mark, all old and a slightly different color from his normal skin tone.
Harry gently removed Draco's hands from his ankles and into his hands, holding them tenderly and running his thumbs over Draco's knuckles. He scooted closer to Draco and felt Draco drop into him. Harry laid his chin on the sobbing man's shoulder. Softly, he whispered in Draco's ear,
"Don't make promises you know you can't keep."
"Oh, they're just flabbergasted at the fact that I have to ability to say the word 'sorry'."
Molly whispered,
"Harry, can I hug you?"
They walked hand in hand downstairs to the kitchen. They joked and giggled, bumping each other's hips while cooking using the muggle method.
Draco's eyes widened and Harry gritted his teeth, which only worried Draco more. He had heard Harry's rants on Dumbledore--or Dumbledick, as Harry liked to call the man, among other colorful nicknames.
Harry stared in horror and disappointment as shock rushed through veins. Harry looked desperately and the rest of everyone there, looking for some sort of support. Looking at Hermione and Ron, he was only met with guilty looks. He let out a breath of astonishment, coming to the reality that this was really happening. His friends and family were really doing this.
The pair rushed around the room, getting themselves' ready and presentable for when their guests arrived.
"Honestly, Granger, for being the smartest person I know you can be quite dense sometimes. A boy that just finished up being at the center of a hug war locks himself up and you don't suspect a thing?"
Draco silently nodded and wrapped an arm around Harry. He encouragingly smiled down at his lover, only to get a disheartened frown. Harry snuggled into Draco's body even more.
Ron snipped,
"It's hard to describe. It felt like I was being beaten again. Like I was back...there. In that house. It was so bad..."
Hermione chimed in,
"That's what I'm trying to figure out. No inn will have me; I'm well known as the kid with the dark mark. And I can't go to a relative's house for obvious reasons. Hogwarts would be the obvious choice, but that's exactly why I can't go there. And I certainly can't just be on the run; I would endanger wherever I am at any moment. There are no other Malfoy or Black estates to go to, as they're either demolished or owned by the very people I'm trying to get away from..."
"We can't risk that possibility. For more reasons than just my safety."
Draco pulled back and just smiled,
"But then you would have grown up in the Wizarding World and everyone wou-"
Draco tried to stutter out an answer with blazing cheeks but fails miserably.
"um...im harry potter."
"Will Voldemort be able to track anyone in the house once I'm there?"
"You don't have to be sorry. You shouldn't be sorry. We all have days like this, especially after the war. You are no exception, and that's okay."
"I will admit that I was stupid, and probably still am, but whatever. Luckily, I missed, but then in my ever empathetic nature, I realized that he looked like complete and utter shit."
Harry looked to the side and decided to play dumb,
"I'm sorry, I just-...nobody's ever told me that...I've been feeling so guilty for it but that-"
"Well, I'm not letting Kreacher ruin this. Come on, let's go eat."
he just had to hope it fit into the lock.
"You do?!"
Draco turned the tap back on and the faucet began spewing out water again, signifying the shut down to Harry's proposal. Harry humphed and then finished up the rest of his share of the dishes.
Draco held Harry tighter when he had tried to get up, pulling him back down.
Draco leaned back onto Harry and replied for everyone,
"I know it is frightening, but it's for the greater goo-"
"I have a proposition."
Dumbledore's eyes twinkled, and he continued,
He got launched back into the couch when Hermione pounced at him, enveloping him in a hug. Her frizzy hair got all in Harry's face, but he didn't complain. He hugged back, feeling overwhelmed by her love.
Harry paused his yelling for a moment and his breath hitched. Tears pricked in the corners of his eyes and his voice began to shake, but he refused to cry in front of Dumbledore.
"Yes, dear. That man did some...bad things, and I thought it would do us all some good if we could...hold a discussion without him here."
Draco made the universal hand motion for 'what the fuck' and asked,
Draco perked up,
"Again, just because I cooperate with him doesn't mean I like him!"
He walked inside and found Harry with no expression on his face, sprawled out and staring at the ceiling in his pajamas, despite it being 8:47 according to the clock in the dorm.
Remus shook his head and sighed in disbelief,
Hermione sighed,
"It's not stupid. Everything had been rather crazy as of late. Now come on, I made breakfast for both of us."
He soothed Harry by rubbing his back and drawing circles into it lightly, talking into the shivering man's ear.
"Well, assuming that you will be discussing matters pertaining to the Order, I will not be listening?"
Harry challenged.
He looked towards Harry--who was hardly registering what was happening--and took his hand, leading his boyfriend up the steps. Hermione called out once they were halfway up the stairway,
Ron chuckled softly at the comment, but answered Draco,
As Harry sat down to eat, he was already thinking about domestic life with Draco. If this was what it was like, sign him the fuck up.
Ron bit the inside of his cheek and furrowed his eyebrows,
Draco's breath audibly hitched. Harry could feel Draco's heartbeat speed up. He was about to say something when Draco took a deep breath and subconsciously pulled Harry in a bit closer.
Draco looked terrified but relaxed slightly when Harry didn't say why.
"doesn't mean I have to like him."
Harry didn't respond. Draco let his satchel down onto the ground and went to Harry's bedside. He silently crawled into the bed and sat next to Harry's head before silently playing with it.
Everyone sat in shock at what they had seen. Hermione shook her head, and voice what she hopes everyone else was also thinking,
Draco silently shook his head and pecked Harry on the forehead.
"Harry, I have an idea. But I think you should leave the room. Don't worry, I'll be right out after you."
"Look, Harry and I have had a fairly hectic day, okay? Can you stop being my enemy for 5 seconds and focus on more important matters?"
He fully leaned into Draco, and while in any other situation Draco would probably have pushed Harry off, but not now.
Mrs. Weasley paid no mind to Draco and turned her attention towards Harry,
"Molly asked him not to come. In a very...polite fashion. Totally polite."
"Please?"
"So...Draco and I are dating..."
The concerned, hurt, and shocked expression Draco bore was swept off in less than a second as he too realized what was happening.
Harry locked eyes with the woman he had come to accept as his mother, and his eyes widened,
"You're welcome, Master Draco."
Draco laughed breathily and looked down at his boyfriend with love in his eyes,
The Fat Lady rolled her eyes and begrudgingly opened up the door. Draco hurried up the steps to where the Eight Years slept.
"Dursleys."
"Well, that's all there is to it-"
"Tiddlywinks."
Harry looked back up with wide eyes,
"But the others won't be...thrilled...with having a Death Eater in there with them..."
Draco pulled Harry out of the bed and down the steps to the kitchen, where the sun peaked in through the slits in the blinds.
The only response was a chuckle from Draco and a scoff from Harry,
"That's the thing. I didn't. I just took his wand until he calmed down. Which took a bit of time, by the way. I never asked why or if he was better, I just made sure he didn't do it. He ignored it ever happened and I didn't want to push him...so I also ignored it...I'm sorry..."
Draco saw the small amount of vulnerability in his father's eyes, the same he had seen many times before. Suddenly, it seemed time had stopped.
"He means past all of the wards. You can't possibly be that smart, Malfoy."
Harry just sighed.
He closed his eyes, but then felt Harry turn round and rest his hand on his cheek. Draco felt a peck on the lips and heard a small whisper,
"I'm coming back. I'm always coming back, whether you want me to or not."
"Screw you,
Everyone widened their eyes at Harry as he stood in front of Draco protectively and stared bullets at Dumbledore. Dumbledore blinked a few times in surprise. Harry didn't bother explaining and swiftly turned around. He looked to Draco with sincerity in his voice and eyes,
That coaxed a hearty laugh out of Draco, easing the tone of the room and calming them both. Harry bit his lip, knowing Draco wasn't going to like what he was about to say,
"What is today's date?"
Harry began quietly giggling, wrapping his arm around his body to protect himself against the phantom tickles. Draco then cast a quick Aguamenti into a cup sitting on Harry's nightstand.
"I've heard your 'greater good' mantra millions of times, I don't need to hear it again. Was it for the 'greater good' that you just left Sirius in Azkaban to waste away? I could have lived with him!"
"Was that common for him? Oh, the poor boy, how often did that happen? Dear Merlin, and to think Dumbledore almost sent him back there..."
Harry's mouth pressed into a line.
He would never find happiness in the same place where he kept on losing it.
"Fair warning, there will be shouting. And some pretty nasty words..."
Draco collected himself and took a few deep breaths,
Harry threw his arms around Draco's neck and hugged tightly, confusing Draco. He hugged back nonetheless.
Draco opened his mouth to argue before realizing that they were probably right. But
"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley."
He began to swish his wand around; removing dust, polishing wood, disposing of bugs, all sorts. He tried to stay as quiet as possible through this whole ordeal.
"It seems so simple, 'Hey, Draco's gonna be stayin' here a while', but it's not."
Draco seemed hesitant, but Harry only waved it off and excused every worry.
he started,
Draco smiled wide and failed at his miserable excuse of an attempt at being sincere,
Harry's face screwed up as he tried to think of a way to explain to them without bringing up Lucius and Narcissa. Finally, he just answered simply,
When Harry woke up the following morning, he was met by his lover's sleeping face. Smiling, he stopped a moment to adore it. Draco's hair was slightly askew, as the gel from the day before was wearing off. There were a few tears stains on his cheeks, but the red in his cheeks had calmed down.
"Okay okay, I'll stop. So, we became friends. And then a little bit more, and then we started dating. But it wasn't...safe to go public with our relationship. If we did, it would basically be putting a target on our heads. Well, only on his I guess, cause I already have one. Whatever. Anyway, I needed a way out of the Dursley's house, and he needed a way out of his house, so we planned to come here together. We had to run sooner than we expected, hence the chaos, but now we're out and that's all the matters. Would anyone like some tea?"
“You hit your head pretty hard Mr. Malfoy.  I’d suggest you take it easy.” Madam Pomfrey came over and looked into his eyes, shining her wand testing his vision or something like that.
“I really need you to stop this nonsense Mr. Potter. I am of the firm belief you have spent more time here than any other student in Hogwarts history.” Pomfrey scolded.
Harry pulled out his fingers and crawled back up kissing Draco deeply once before sitting up and positioning himself. “Tell me if it hurts.”
Luna ran behind Ginny and was trying to hide. Ginny scooped up a bunch of snow and sent it at Potter as well.  Draco just continued laughing.
“I feel like shite” Harry said voice soft.
“Hugo please alert the Headmistress, I’m sure she wants to know that Mr. Potter is awake.” Pomfrey got up and fetched a few more potions.
“Can I stay?” Draco almost whispered.
As he slowly closed the distance Potter kept his eyes on Draco’s. As if waiting for Draco to protest. Draco couldn’t think much less attempt a protest. The smell of Potter filled his brain. Then their lips met. It was electrifying. Draco froze for the briefest of moments sure this was some sort of joke. Then he couldn’t care less, it was Potter, and he was kissing him. The kiss deepened Draco opening his mouth in a moan and Potter taking full advantage and darting his tongue in.
“I have to go; I just wanted an update.” Weasley said standing and looking back at his friend. “You’d better pull through mate. Mum will be here in the morning. McGonagall is keeping her at bay for now. Later Malfoy. Let me know if anything changes.”
Draco only noticed Harry.
“Yes” Potter wasn’t looking at him.
“What is this?” Draco asked without sitting up.
Draco really tried at first to continue his hatred of Potter. Potter just took it. Nothing seemed to aggravate him anymore. No jabs at his hair any of the usual taunts. Even Potters friends only had appeared mildly irritated when he teased them.
Draco was back at Hogwarts. McGonagall started a, never before heard of, eighth year. Allowing all students who should have been in their final year during the war to return. Draco Malfoy came back, only because his mother convinced him that this was best. That maybe he could prove that he is more than a mindless killing machine for the Dark Lord.
“Ugh, do I have to go down there?” Draco whined. “They are always all over each other.”
“I need him to be.” Draco said softly.
“Malfoy?” Potter whispered.
At those words Draco released. “Harry!” The stream of come falling over his chest.
“You won’t drop it will you?” Draco sighed. He had been hoping to get some reading in, the fire looked so welcoming.
“Please come back inside.” Draco heard a voice whisper.
“How long have you been hiding there?” Draco growled.
Draco turned and saw Weasley. He did not have the energy to even think of some smart-ass retort. He just looked back at Harry.
“Why?” Draco stuttered after they broke apart.
“That doesn’t matter though.” Draco said flatly. “I’m not good for him.”
“The Savior isn’t perfect?” Draco mocked.
Merlin, Draco couldn’t control the moans coming out of his mouth. It didn’t seem to bother Harry though, he leaned back slightly to watch Draco as he added another finger. Then he hit something deep inside that sent a course of pure pleasure through Draco.
“When he died it was you who saved him though. You might not know but it was your mother who checked on him who asked quietly if you were alive, that was the only thing he was sure of he could honestly answer. She lied for him then, for you. All she wanted to do was see you again, you know? Which gave him the chance to get away again.”
Potter laughed gently against his lips. “Because I like you.”
“Of course, I do.” Harry replied. “I love you.”
Harry pulled his own pants off quickly and was pulling Draco back onto the bed. “Are you sure?” Draco was on top of him now their cocks pressed firmly against each other. Merlin, he could come just like this. He slowly moved against Harry, the friction was thrilling.
“A gift?” Draco asked raising his eyebrow.
“Madam Pomfrey how is he?”  Mrs. Weasley pleaded.
That is when Draco finally noticed the blades had the dark mark on their handle. They were Death Eater Blades. The man was a death eater. Draco’s mind went back, he was there at the manor he came and went within the inner circle. The man was trying to kill Draco because of Voldemort’s fall.
Draco turned now confused. “What?”
“Hey yourself.” Draco replied as Harry pulled him up off the couch.
“No Draco, they ask all the time for you to join them. They know I love you and want to be with you as much as possible. They just want to be included.” Harry flipped around teary eyed.
“You come up here every couple nights.” Potter replied as if that answered the question.
It was almost December when Draco had enough. One night, Potter was having seriously bad terrors. He hadn’t even realized Potter had cast silencing spells until he crossed the barrier. His screams tore through Draco, it was horrible.
“I’m sorry Master Malfoy, I have to make sure this one gets the punishment he deserves. And my master would not approve of you getting in trouble over this…being.” The house elf bowed.
“I’ve never…” Draco hated admitting it. He never really had the chance. There was a war. Before that he just never really found anyone. The most he had done was sneak kisses during parties. Nothing more.
Harry was picking up pace. Merlin, he felt amazing. Draco whimpered slightly when Harry broke the kiss, releasing his head. Then before he could properly protest Harry had grasped Draco’s cock. His hand slightly slick from the lube slid up and down with ease. Draco felt the pleasure building, before he could warn Harry though Harry almost growled “Come for me.”
“We don’t know.” Pansy said softly. “He wanted you, Harry…he saved you. He saw the threat but he…he pushed you down.”
“Well yes, snow is cold and wet. Doesn’t mean it won’t be fun.” Potter was still holding onto his arm. “Come on please?”
“Yes!” Potter cheered. You would have thought he won some sort of prize.
Draco laid there next to Harry as he opened the box. Within the cover was a soft cushion of fabric and on it was a small silver pendent on a delicate silver chain, which read ‘il n’est rien de réel que le rêve et l’amour’. Draco’s breath caught, he looked over at the black-haired boy next to him. How could he have possibly known? Known that this was a saying his mother whispered to him so much growing up. Whispered anytime he was having a hard time, anytime his father was particularly harsh, anytime he told her his hopes and dreams. She whispered it to him once more before he left for Hogwarts.
“I can’t believe Christmas is only a few weeks away.” Potter said. “This year seems to be flying by.”
Draco frowned and glared at the table. “No Potter. I am perfectly capable of doing my own homework.” Draco refused to look up. He heard the chair pull back and the sound of someone setting their books out on the table.
“Do you” Draco started asking between kisses. “Do you want to?”
Harry rolled over with a sigh and picked back up the discarded box. “I know it’s kinda soon but I wanted to get you something.”
“What?” Draco glared at him again.
Pansy looked up at him sorrow in her eyes. “I can’t imagine how you must be feeling. I know how you feel about him.”
“No! No don’t you dare Potter!” Draco warned but the snow ball hit him square in the chest. His eyes widened in disbelief. “Oh, it’s on!”
He didn’t realize he had fallen asleep until he was woken up to a loud voice.
Harry groaned into his ear “Anything you want.”
This time when he reached Draco’s slacks he pulled them down. He didn’t stop kissing. He kissed along his hip bone, he kissed down his thigh. Then he paused in front of Draco, who was becoming embarrassed being exposed like that. Before Draco could say anything, Harry took Draco in his mouth.
Draco looked into his eyes. “Well this is my bed actually.” He couldn’t contain the sass.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Yes, I know.”
Draco looked past him at Harry. Was that true? Was that why Harry was always there? Why had Harry never said anything?
Draco felt Harry slip his hand into his pants. His fingers trailing slowly just grazing over Draco’s cock. Harry broke off the kiss again and pulled off both of their shirts. Then he started kissing Draco’s chest again. He was back to giving him a flick of the tongue and a graze of the teeth. Draco was finding it harder to breathe.
Harry came over to the edge of Draco’s bed.
5! 	Damn Harry looked amazing tonight.
Potter blinked up at him tears in his eyes. He didn’t say anything he just lowered his wand.
He felt Harry chuckle as he swirled his tongue around the head of his cock. Then he went deeper. Draco had never felt such pleasure. Oh, Merlin. He looked down and watched Harry bob back and forth. Harry looked like he was thoroughly enjoying himself. After a moment or two Harry looked up, meeting Draco’s eyes as he continued to suck.
“I am staying here for the break. What about you?” Potter asked.
Draco pointedly looked away from Potter back to his own homework. He became lost in his own work from Defense Against the Dark Arts. He didn’t understand the charm they were talking about. Worse, he knew Potter did. It was the whole reason the new teacher was having them review it, she was a Potter Fan. She kept going on and on about how Potter was the youngest to produce a corporal patronus. However, he was not about to ask him for help.
But their friendship was just that. A friendship. Even when they shared a bed it was never anything sexual. They just slept next to each other.
Draco froze. “They know what?”
That’s when the hex was sent his way. Draco didn’t have a chance to lift his wand. The hex never hit though. Draco looked over at Potter who was facing the attacker. He could feel the anger rolling off the Golden Boy.
Draco waited with a raised eyebrow, what does he mean one more gift? They exchanged gifts before they left the house this morning. Before they even dressed. That was followed by Christmas sex. It was amazing. What does he mean one more gift?
“The blades Headmistress.” Poppy pointed to a side table.
“Draco I would do anything you want.” He pulled back eyes dark with lust. The sincerity in his face was enough to confirm that Draco was ready for this. For Harry.
Draco looked at Harry confused. “What?”
Draco scooped up snow and threw it, he missed though and hit Weasel. Then it was a free for all. People were throwing snow balls back and forth. Running and dodging. Laughing and teasing.
Potter ran back a moment later. “Sorry Ginny interrupted. She’s such a bint.”
“Because I like you.” Potter replied as if that was a proper answer.
Draco nodded and pushed back farther so his back was against the wall.
Hermione spoke. “We were in Hogsmeade ma’am. We had just left the Hogs Head where we had lunch when this man… he started calling Draco, like he knew him. But he sounded friendly at first so Draco stopped to see who it was. Then the man came up and he”
Would anyone care? Doubtful. If he died right now, no one but his mother would mourn him.
“So, I make you neglect them?” Draco bristled.
“He’s a bloody pouf!” the boy screamed.
He wasn’t sure how long he was out, but it was dark outside. Draco pushed himself up, bloody hell his head hurt. He swung his legs over the side. When he heard a voice warn him to stop.
“Gentlemen” McGonagall’s face was dark. “Please get this man out of my school. Immediately. Please let me know if you need anything further for your investigation.”
“Come on! It’ll be fun!” Potter whined.
“Potter!” Draco called trying to wake him. “Potter!” He reached in trying to be gentle. Nothing was helping. “Potter!” He started to shake him. Instantly there was a wand at his throat. Draco froze. “Potter you were having a nightmare.”
End of memory
"Oh can it Granger!" said a Slytherin to her tutting that she would argue with a teacher and Flitwick at that, one of the nicest professors around!
"I'm Hermione Granger, the smartest witch around, hey are you even listening to me?, I'm a third year if you would of had a guess you would of known and one of the best there is, will you stop ignoring me?!" she turned to Sirius as he was looking around making sure that Remus hadn't followed him into the forest but knowing his luck he would.
He got off the floor; hand tightly in Otiz' fur making sure to ground the pair of them but Otiz' eyes had changed colour, they were now a deep dark purple......
"If you don't mind".
"Ok whats going on? Why did you wake us.. should I say me up as Hads is still sleeping" yawned Otiz once he was standing up and stretching making his back pop.
"Miss Granger, I don't understand why you did this but I don't think cheating and selling answers to your peers is the right way to go about this all. I have also have heard that you have been bullying poor Mister Snape about the adoption of all things, you were once friends.
"Otiz had marked you as a friend, like he has done to you're parents and older siblings, myself and the Malfoy's. It is an honor for what type of species he is. Two of the most rarest animals around a Japanese Bakeneko and a Japanese Kitsune. So I would be careful to anger him" and with that he left the Great Hall with Harry still hiding.
Severus- Sev or Sevvy
When my client young Mister Snape lost his biological parents at the age of fifteen months due to who he may not be named and then placed with his ex relatives on that cold Halloween night he would have died then.
Draco was sitting next to him staring in fact at what had happened and when he looked to his God brother he saw something he didn't want to see and so raised his hand.
Once he was let down from the table he wobbled on his now 'jelly legs' and was taking back to the room and placed on the bed waiting for him, he didn't even notice when he first came into the room at a bed was there.
Severus sighed he didn't want this to happen this was going to undo everything that they had worked for.
"Don't look into his eyes he's now a basilisk a young one but can still skill if looked right into them, Hadrian can you close your inner eye lid for me please it will help not to kill anyone" said Tom making sure not to look at him.
"No they aren't I don't want Slytherin's in the house dad!" yelled Ron making Harry curl further, Otiz by now was furious and was now growling and was about to attack when Severus spoke.
Albus wanted to say more but he noticed that his floo had activated and the other two had disappeared from the office.
"Harry what are you doing there, Gryffindor is the place for you!" shouted Ron to him, this made Hermione nod her head as well as Ginny, who Harry had met on a few occasions.
The following day Hermione was full of herself she knew that she would get full marks and couldn't wait until her essays were given back to her at the end of the class what she wasn't expecting was annoyance from her teachers of all things!!
Once everyone was downstairs and having their morning cup of coffee and tea but as they drunk they all noticed something strange Harry wasn't there..
Everyone knew he hated the end of year tests what he hated more was O.W.Ls and the N.E.W.Ts he could so do without them but they were a must for everyone Witches and Wizards to take and thankfully Harry wasn't going to be taking them for another few years.
"I don't like wearing Muggle clothes, I much prefer my robes anyday" said Severus putting the red coverse shoes on and tying his hair up into a small pony tail which made Harry laugh slightly.
"Oh that's right he's now Hadrian Snape now"
"Hystrifors" muttered Harry but it sounded strange as he kept trying not to laugh, as he was about to try again and firework and fire cracker went off making everyone scream.
"You Ron Weasley are despicable, I knew you are up to something when you asked me out last year!! So this was what it was!!" and she ran out of the Hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hi Hadwin, me cweaned-ed for Tev!" smiled Otiz to Harry who ruffled his hair.
..................
Lucius and Severus talking about what they were like when they were in school as well as how his poor father; Severus for that matter; being picked on by his biological father and his friends.
"Headmaster I have explained this many times, I rescued Hadrian over the summer, he was beaten and abused by this relatives. I took him in as he needed someone to look after him. I was never going to leave him in that place.
But said boy was laughing and everyone was woken up by his laughing, Otiz' barking and running of feet, they weren't happy but it was either get up now or be pranked and with a pranking hybrid it was safer that they got up.
Severus' gifts consisted of two potion journals from Draco, from Narcissa he got some rare potion vials that were made from crystal which had his name engraved on them and from Lucius he got some rare potion ingredients. From Harry he got some new black robes with green and silver detail on them as well as some potion note books with the Slytherin house logo on.
Tom got up from his seat and introduced himself to everyone, he welcomed them to the new school year even though it was coming to the end of November but in his book it didn't count as it was the start of his new career, his new place at work he count wait.
They talked and played games for the rest of the night, the three mentioned only came into the room to say good night and get something to eat, they didn't want to be anywhere near the Boy-who-lived-to-be-a-Slytherin.
"Harry come and sit down, please. We have to talk about everything that has happened as well as the adoption if that's ok with you?" asked Severus making Harry to move from the door and to the spare chair next to him.
"Oh hush you, it's not like you don't kiss Draco and don't say you don't Nagini has seen it" laughed Tom rubbing Otiz' back as he whimpered in his sleep.
"Fine but just don't tell that oaf of a teacher with the animals..." Otiz turned away and said no more making Filius turn to Harry for the missing information.
Harry nodded and looked at them when they finally placed him on the floor once more.
*Another potion so then they can have animal ears
"Draco, Nott and Zabini I want you three to make sure that Hadrian here is ok while I go and speak to the Head of Griffindor, don't let him out of this room" said Severus pointing to Otiz who was now snarling at anyone that came into the room or even close to him.
Everyone looked up and saw him.
"Hey, hey buddy it's ok, I'm here now don't worry I'm here now" said Harry picking the boy up who was now in complete koala mode and wouldn't be letting go any time soon.
He had wolf ears on his head that match his hair perfectly and a tail also of the same colour, Otiz had changed colour instead of his blue silky fur it was now orange and kept changing making him look like a rainbow!!
Otiz wasn't having any of this he wanted Harry back in the castle and either in the common room or in Severus' chamber's away from the bushy menace that they knew was still around.
"Thank you Mrs Anderson we are going to talk to Maxwell on his own today to try and work out what is wrong with him and why he has started to go back in his therapy instead of going forward like he has been" said Severus and his new mother left the room.
"Hadrian it's ok, I'm here and so is Otiz and I know for a fact that Mr and Mrs Weasely will be there for you as well my son".
I opened the door to see Harry tangled in the blankets covered in sweat, I gently shook the boy. "Harry? It's alright. Wake up, you're having a bad dream"
"Otiz what in Merlin's name have you done to my father now" asked Harry only to have Severus reply with "destroyed the Skele-gro I was making for Poppy, the little imp thought it would be funny to change the Chinese Chomping Cabbage for normal cabbage" and he glared at him.
"He is remarkable".
Example: the match to needle spell, mice to snuffboxes both from your first year, then we have Vera Verto spell, the softening charm and Reparifarge which undoes the spell being taught.
They had their lesson on Bogart's and Neville of all people changed his Bogert Severus into his grandmother's clothes making everyone laugh, yes Harry and to tell Severus of it all and said man said that he would be kinder to the poor boy, which they had made much progress on it.
"Hadrian what happened to your stuffed animals?" asked his father making the boy look at his toys.
"Max had a panic attack before coming to class not long ago and his parents phoned me saying he was having a bad day today. I can take him out of class and we can work one on one with him if that's ok" she said having his teacher nod to her .
Get over it and think about someone other than yourself for once you brat, you had a five star up bringing compared to him. He is only here because I rescued him from those monster's that Dumbledore sent him to.
As the title says, what happened to her after she was taken out of Hogwarts
"Dinner readys now Master sirs" said a house elf that was called Pippin and so the three adults and two children as well as the hybrid all headed into the kitchen.
"Never expected that..." said Severus
Once the students had left Severus stood his ground and stared at his mentor and friend and sighed never in all his ten years of tutelage had he seen him like this.
Uh... So annoying. Three grown men acting like school girls talking about their youth and who they once loved.. yuck nope and so he decided to drag his friends; Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Draco and of course Otiz into Hogsmeade for the day.
"Oh can I sit here?" asked an airy voice bringing Hermione out of her thoughts and looked to see who was talking and noticed that it was Luna Lovegood.
Just as Ron had finished shouted, Lucius sighed and Harry finally broke down crying into Draco's shoulder.. before Lucius could say anything the doors to the Great Hall banged opened to reveal two Aurors walked in as well as Molly and Arthur, Ginny trailing behind, they didn't trust her to be home alone.
Fred, George and Percy were shocked at what the school had started to do but they were also happy about they wanted nothing to do with their once brother, the shunning also meant that as he was their family he would be cast out.
The Weasely line has one Heir by the name of William Arthur Weasely and two apparent heirs by the names of Charles Anthony Weasely and Percival Ignatius Weasely and the Prewett has two co Heirs called Frederick Gideon Weasely and George Fabian Weasely.
Draco came in dressed in a dark green t shirt and black jeans with slits in the knees and bright red trainers of all things!
The four boys and one hybrid looked at the man after their professor explained it to him.
The game lasted for three hours ending in a draw which didn't please either side but they did have fun, Otiz was flat out on his back snoring which made the four boys laugh when they saw him.
"No it won't but you have to think of certain time frames for us so then we can take them and place them in the Pensieve, just like we did before with Severus ok?" as he explained everything.
Burnt chest, cut to cheek, cut to lower back, frost bite, pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydrated, rash on bottom
With introductions finished they finally go onto the important business that they were called here for.
"Come here Otiz, let's get ready for bed" said Draco coming over and picking up the child.
They went into the chamber and saw both Severus and Tom sitting there and some chocolate.
They had to guild Otiz over to the other toy's as he was loving the snitch way to much.
"..so you see he isn't good, Dumbledore is better at governing the school unlike that imposter that calls himself the Headmaster now" she said making everyone sigh this had been going on now for three hours and she was just not shutting up about it.
"So what has brought all of you to my office?" said Fudge even though he knew, the Goblins had wrote to him about the blood adoption and all the blocks and potions on Harry and who had placed them all on him.
"Oh don't find it isgusting you all loved it" she said again not caring that she was digging her own hole bigger an bigger.
"Trying to scare uncle Luc into going onto some rides and knowing Sirius would love them as he had told them about his magical motorbike that flew and could go invisible at a push of a button, it was then the Slytherin children as well as two Gryffindor's started planning.
They were about to leave when yet again Harry was caught wandering off into a pet shop of all things, Severus following behind him wondering what had yet again attracted the boy and when he saw said boy holding onto a powered baby blue cat like thing with beaming emerald green eyes, so much like Harry's and Lilly's something clicked within him, he knew this store it was a store that dealt with familiars.
"Why is it so damn hard to do this, I'm the smartest witch around, this should be a piece of cake but everything I fill it in with the answer it always turns red stating that's it's wrong!" she threw her work sheet at the closest wall after putting it into a ball.
"That one!" pointed Harry as he practically dragged not only Draco with him but Sirius as well, this made the man gulp at it all.
Fudge turned to the boy and asked "young Master Snape are you will having trouble with him at school again? How are your sessions going?" but Harry kept tight lipped all he wanted to do was go home, he didn't want to go back to school.
"All of you miserable lot into my office right now!" he was beyond pissed. Harry just whimpered in his arms but followed his fellow students.
Boy it was just annoying to think that your once familiar was now a small child of six years old! How in Merlin did that happen in the first place all Harry and Severus knew was one minute Harry was upset because if what happened with the Dursley's at the zoo.
"The great Lucius Malfoy being called Lu-Lu is way to much to handle. I think I will call you that from now on" said Tom as he got up and left, heading up to the Headmasters office changing the password to 'seven emeralds' and so when he entered the office he went to work right away.
"Did I see what I saw brother?"
With a clap of his hands the banquet appeared and Albus said "glibber, flit, gobble, newt" letting everyone know that they could start eating, Remus sat back down taking his chocolate out of his mouth wrapping it up and putting it back into his pocket.
Draco of course had Peacock feather quill with purple ink bottlee
Inside Cornelius Fudge office everyone was sitting while he just stared at Harry who wanted nothing more to climb onto his dad's lap and hide he hated when people stared at him like that.
"Potter really?! I'm talking to you about something important here and you're ignoring me!!"
"Ah Mister Malfoy welcome back to class, please do sit down so then we can carry on" said Filius only for Draco to explain what was going on.
Name: Otiz Hadrian Severus Snape
(All with unauthorized withdrawals by one Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, to the Order of the Phoenix and personal accounts of one Ronald Bilius Weasely to personal account, one Ginerva Molly Weasley to personal account and Hermione Jean Granger to personal account)
"Every well, I am the godparent of Draco and I would like to know if it is alright with you to have his parents, Lucius ad Narcissa, to be yours if that is alight?" Harry almost spat out the last of his pancake over the table.
"Ok professor I'll tell you everything that has happened to me but before I do could you calm down slightly your making Otiz upset and I don't want him to hurt you" said Harry stroking his fur to calm him down.
"I know right Becky, it was so cute" and they left after shouting him to get up if not a bucket of freezing cold water would rain down on him.
"Otiz calm down, they aren't worth it at all" said Draco as he was trying to calm Harry down as he was starting to have a panic attack, ever since the verbal attacks on him as well as some physical, the three always sent him into a panic attack.
He was barely alive!" screamed Severus to Albus but Albus wasn't backing down.
Age 1:
"Well class welcome to a new year, this year we will be expanding on what we already know and will go back and forth with old and new material.
Right there and then it ripped itself open and for everyone to hear across the Great Hall, Molly Weasely's voice rang out.
"Oh it should be Hadikins now as he as adopted"
"I can't believe I'm stuck in this room! I am meant to be in the Griffindor Tower where my friends are!" moaned Hermione to no one in particular as she yet again paced the room.
Otiz glared at him, his glare was on par with Severus but it had no effect on Harry anymore living withe Severus made him immune to it all.
"Nothing much he started it when he wouldn't listen to us when we said we had class, just walked the fuck away" said Ginny and Ron together.
"What do you mean I'm the smartest witch around! I don't need tutors to catch up! It's those idiots that need it now me!" screamed Hermione.
"I'm going to change for bed" and he stormed off slamming his door.
Madam Sprout came into the greenhouse and saw the stranger, she smiled towards him but he glared back at her. ((Image Sev's glare and insert it here))
Flu, cut hand, rash on bottom
"Hadrian we have decided to take you to Walt's Wizarding World Attraction Holiday Theme Park!, two weeks away of pure joy and relaxation as well as celebrating two soon to be fourteen year old birthdays!" said Tom to him
"My grades are perfect you hear me you imposter!"
He smiled at them but they still weren't Otiz his beloved nutty hybrid familiar, without realising his spells that he had place broke and the door opened.
"You are to carry everything, don't say a word as everyone already knows what you have done, we will meet your father at the Ministry later as we have been called to a meeting" with that they headed off to the first stop of the day: Madam Malkin.
I stepped a little closer to the boy "Harry it's quite alright. Do you know who I am?" I asked my voice gentle. Harry then looked up from the floor to stare at me, he was so confused "P-professor?" Harry's voice wavered, I only nodded. "Are you ok? Who did this to you?", Harry then became very interested in the floor, he then started to cry and god I wasn't sure what to do so I reached out and placed his hand under Harry's chin to lift it up. As soon as Harry looked up, he did something that surprised me and himself, he launched himself into my arms.
Harry just looked at the Minister and then at his father.
Severus just sighed and said "I will explain in due course but it all depends on Hadrian, but first you three will each have detention tonight for the next three nights after dinner" with that he marched the three out leaving a stunned Poppy, Draco and Harry in his wake.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This has never happened before"
"RONALD BILIUS WEASLEY AND GINERVA MOLLY WEASELY!!
In a swirl of purple magic and a bright light, where Otiz once stood, now stood a small boy that looked to be about six if they hazard a guess.
Forced glamour (to hide abuse 100% broken)
"You've lied to me and Severus! I can smell it on you, do you really think that you could get past my wolves instincts?? You smell bitter" Remus got up and left the office but waited by the Griffin for Severus.
"He was at home with me" said Severus who looked to Harry who now had his hand firmly in Otiz's fur, trying to calm down.
"We need to know" came all the replies to what was going on.
Tom just sighed at her not going to get much out of her, he was trying to think of ways to get back in Severus' good books, he ended up swearing in parseltongue making Nagini laugh.
Severus walked towards the edge of Hogwarts once out of the school's boundaries he appeared to 4 privet Drive, it was late in the evening, the only light that could be seen was the street lights. Severus spotted the front door and went straight to it, he looked around once more, noticing that no one was around, he pulled out his wand and whispered "Alohomora" the door opened with a soft click, not loud enough to wake anyone.
"Snape, professor" said Harry to her quietly.
Harry would have died if it wasn't for Severus going and checking on the poor boy, and that was if Poppy hadn't of brought it to his attention!
"I think it's time to go to Gringotts now as they are expecting us along with Poppy and Minerva as well as Filius and Pomana" and with that they all headed to Gringotts.
She started screaming at it all and went to run away but Otiz had changed back and grabbed her.
"What was that for!" he asked annoyed only to have two identical devil smiles placed in two identical faces.
"Still I think I'll spy on you lot then" walks over and takes Otiz waking him up, him going full on fox form growling.
He was about to yank him up when he was stopped by Draco "what in Merlin's name are you doing to Hadrian??" once he was close enough.
"So Miss Weasley please elaborate?" asked Severus using the most intimnating voice he would use in the classroom, making the young lion shake even more than necessary.
Soon they were on the ground, Sirius falling out of his seat once they were realised from said ride.
"Remmy careful please, she hasn't done anything to me or to you, I'm only making sure she doesn't get harmed that's all don't worry" he slowly stepped forward to try and help please the werewolf boyfriend of his, hoping that they were still together at least.
Our Harry gets bullied
"...if it isn't..."
Again she picked up another parchment this one from a third year Hufflepuff stating that she had to take a morning after pill to make sure that she hadn't gotten pregnant, it was signed Mitsuko Sora the transfer student that came this year alone!
Harry layed in the floor beating, bloody and bruised in a small corner of the room, he could hear faint whispers coming from the boy when he walk closer to the boy he flinched away and whispered.
"Mister Weasely I suggest you let go of my son this instant" said Severus, this made everyone look at him, Ron at that moment lost all colour in his face.
Each boy picked up a different type of quill each with their own different feathers:
Recklessness
"Otiz stop that right now" said Harry picking up the clothes that he had thrown on the floor only to make the hybrid laugh and run off only to be picked up by Tom with a new ring on his finger, it was the Prince consort ring Severus had the Slytherin ring, it looked like they had finally gotten more forward with their relationship unlike him and Draco but they were now only 14 so they had a while left but smiled.
When they had arrived home Harry bolted to his room and slammed the door shut! He didn't want anyone to hear or see him, without his knowledge he had cast a powerful silencing and locking charms on his door and room.
"Don't worry I am not mad at you or anyone, my dear Grimm but I'm more than angry at that girl that come into the office" whispered Tom to him who only replied with a whine.
"That doesn't explain his nose"
Harry got up off the sofa he was sitting on and slowly made his way over to his father who was sitting in his chair in front of the fire.
"I can see this monster isn't helping you Hadrian" said Tom sitting down on his bed and placed Otiz on his lap and started helping him pack for the year, nine months without being at home but at least both his parents, could he count Tom as his parent, he wasn't sure yet, were going to be at the school so he could always visit but that wasn't what he wanted, he wanted to be able to see the Weasley family even if that meant he was near Ginny, yuck!
"Sadly I do not, if his own family don't know then we won't know unless th..." he was cut off by Hermione banging her hands on the table crashing everyone's eye.
Before he could say anything and leave the zoo the man insisted and so Severus brought his son over to the stuffed animals.
"I kinda had something to do, that's all, sorry if I worried you" said Harry as he was putting some food onto his plate and slowly started to eat his breakfast, wedged snuggly between both Ron and Hermione, making him slightly uncomfortable.
Harry waited with baited breath as he really wanted to go to the Weasley's but with how Ron had been treating him since he got resorted it was hard, he knew he should say something but it was hard, he knew nothing would hurt him his dad would be there, he just didn't want Molly and Arthur knowing what their son had done to him.
Euphemia Cecilia Potter, Rose Mary Evans nee Wilson, Eileen Abigail Snape nee Prince (through adoption)
This was namely for me as I couldn't remember it all
Back at the Burrow, Molly was still furious at her daughter for what she had done, if it wasn't for Percy's final letter to go along with the twin's she wouldn't of come into Hogwarts, she knew the twin's letters weren't jokes one bit as it was written with such certianty she knew that it was no prank, which they were famous for, thank Merlin, not a prank.
Earlier, right before school year ended. Harry was injured in a Quidditch match Gryffindor vs. Slytherin, Poppy had nursed him back to health yet again and sent him on his way, but when he was in a coma she did a full body scan and found out some very interesting things about one Harry James Potter.
"Nope" was the reply he was given.
"Albus his name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry James Potter!!" Severus sneered again, making Harry flinch but with Severus hand on his knee he calmed quickly.
"Dad what are Narcissa, Lucius and Draco's birthdays?" he asked making him look at his son, and then he smiled and said "Draco's is June, Lucius' I believe is September and if I recalled Narcissa's is March, so we will need a moonstone, a sapphire and lastly an aquamarine stone" and he nodded to the jeweller.
"Har.. Hadrian I'm sorry for what happened but you were meant to be with me after what happened to you parents that fateful night, j went and chased after a rat which I shouldn't of done but I did, I wasn't until I was being taken away that I remembered you"
"Otiz..." was all Severus said making the hybrid jump over to him and almost onto his lap but stopped at the look he was given.
Arthur could only hug her saying that it was alright he could get to the bottom of all of this.
Once he had drunk it all he placed the goblet down onto the table, signed his name and then crawled back into his father's lap and right there he started to slightly doze off again making everyone chuckle.
"Our little book worm will have fun with her school work" said Fred to him.
"What's happening?" asked Harry making his father smile including Tom.
Petunia jumped when she noticed who it was and almost screamed but didn't want to bring too much attention to her "perfect" family.
"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore" Otiz hissed to them, this made everyone shocked if they truly thought about it, it all made perfect sense!
"No!" this brought Tom back to the present and he smiled a true smile while Lucius held onto the small boy who was shaking in fear but truth be told Otiz was trying so hard not to laugh.
Poppy came bustling over to see what was wrong and upon seeing Otiz she knew it only had to be Harry in the bed but when she noticed that he wasn't there but a phoenix was.
Dinner was over and everyone started to head out of the Great Hall other than the Slytherin's that is they waited and once the rest were gone they decided that they would talk to Harry in the common room and then head to bed.
I was going to make you my Heir in everything including blood but when Severus gave me your reports it was I that suggested that he adopt you both in writing and in blood to keep that coot off of you so then you can have a normal childhood with him.
Harry was enjoying his time with his friends in Hogsmeade when Otiz changed into his teenage form and was met by Fawkes sitting on his shoulder and the two began to talk to each other like they hadn't seen each other in years, good friends through and through.
Severus could see what was going to happen and turned to the students but mostly Percy.
So far I have:
"Wed head boy pass dis!" said Otiz handing her the note that was from Ron and it said:
............
Otiz was sitting on the table staring at the pile of books where Filius would take his lessons from, he sniffed knowing that many of the Gryffindor's or most of them at least didn't know who he was which was going to be fun.
"Don't worry about him, I'll just take him home for now, I'm sorry that we have caused this mess in your fine place of work" and he picked up Harry.
"Padfoot we can't take Harry away from what I've seen he's much better, I've read the reports for what his 'family' did to him and I have to say if Severus hadn't helped him that year he would of died, his former best friends tried to hurt him so many times, it was sad to watch really".
Harry just nodded he wanted to get this over and done with and finally start living as a normal teenager and start his holidays like everyone else has.
Severus, Hadrian, you are both welcome to come and spend the day with us for the Yule festivites, Narcissa is beside herself wanting to see you both. We will meet on the day after Yule. Regards Lucius Abraxas Malfoy.
"He's such a wonderful animal Hadrian, you are very lucky to have him, now off you both go dinner will be ready in a few more minutes".
"So does this mean that we can start from the begining?"
Tom didn't know what to say about that 'meanie pant' really?! Severus Tobias Snape had called him meanie pants! Oh he was going to be having words with him about that if only he knew how to get back into his good graces, like he used to be.
Harry was looking at this man who claimed to be his parents best friend, yes he wanted to know more about them but now he had Severus as his father. What did he want more? To know his birth parents or not?
It had been a week since Hermione left the Hospital Wing after she was knocked out by some unknown force, she was raging as no one knew what she was on about to her it looked like everyone was taking a complete blind eye to her and what she, the smartest witch of the generation! She deserves to know what was going to happen! She wanted answer!
She was about to pick it up when all of a sudden it jumped up and started writing, she took a look at what it was writing and noticed that it was a history report, on the Goblin Wars. As it wrote away she tuned to the dorm mate and asked "how long has this been happening?" only to get a reply of "since before Halloween in first year" meaning eighteen months and no one had cottoned onto it.
Everyone looked towards the youngest male Weasely in shock, all the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws that Ron had bullied all stood up!
The following morning Harry was woken up by a six year old Otiz jumping on his bed laughing.
The staff members saw what he was on about, the Dursley's where right in their faces, the poor boy was so scared!
"We are meant to be together!" she coughed out as he tried to get up but with Otiz' magic swirling around her it was impossible everyone could see his type of magic.
Tom knew that his Potions Master as able to posion you without you even knowing as he had asked him many a time to do that.. he had to admit it was fun to watch the snivelling whelps gasp their last breath.
Both blushed and headed out for the day to catch up as well as other things
........
"Really? Professor Snape and the new Headmaster know each other?" asked Pansy before Harry could answer.
"How could you do that to the students and think to get away with it! You disgusting girl! Hadrian is more than enough traumatized by what his relatives have done to him since the moment he was placed within their care...
Percy was reading but could get passed the page he had read for the fifth time within the last twenty minutes, took out his wand and cast a silencing spell on her making everyone nod to him in thanks.
“Ma’am.” One Auror said with a gruff voice. “Whoever cast these spells please remove them after we have the cuffs on him.” The man then went to apply two sets of cuffs one for his wrists one for his feet. Draco knew of these; they were to prevent magic. The person wearing them could not cast even if they got ahold of a wand, they also could not shift if they were an Animagus.
They were engaged over a year. When the wedding day finally arrived, it was more amazing than Draco could have imagined. Pansy had been his wedding planner, and designer. And she outdid herself. It was simply spectacular.
Potter frowned for a moment. “Not in the least.”
1! 	There was a twinkle in his eyes as he leaned forward.
“Really. I don’t see why your so damn excited about it. We are just going to Hogsmeade.”
“Looks like you are the one in need of help.” Draco sneered.
“They don’t hate you.” Potter reassured. Looking for some reason as if this was very important to him.
Did Potter just say he was gay?
“Not until you join me.” Potter said with that damn lopsided grin of his.
Draco and Harry both came up with their own vows. Draco went first of course. When he finished he slipped the ring onto Harry’s finger.
Draco watched Harry, willing him to keep fighting.
Draco looked up at him now, the green eyes held only fear. Salazar, he should have stayed in his own bed. He shouldn’t be over here comforting some Gryffindor. But it was a scared Gryffindor. It was a scared Potter.
“Because love, I’m not as blind as you are.” Pansy teased. “It’s been clear on your face since first year. I tried denying it for a long time, you know how I used to crush on you, but when I saw how you were during his trials in that tournament. I knew. There was no use denying it. It just seemed like you weren’t ready to admit it to yourself.”
Harry slipped a third finger in continuing to hit that spot as often as he could. He thrusted and turned and thrusted again.
“Draco.” Merlin hearing his name fall from Harry’s lips was amazing.
Draco didn’t notice the room went quiet, except the music. Draco didn’t know that all eyes were on the two of them.
“Look I may not have always been your biggest supporter. Because you are kind of a prat and remember you did almost kill me that one time.” Weasley chuckled and cut off Draco’s apology. “All I know is you for some reason make him happy. And he is closer than my own brothers. If you are what makes him happy, I will never have a problem with that. His happiness is important.”
“Because I like you.” Potter replied. Draco frowned, why was he saying such things? What was he trying to accomplish?
“He’s going to ok” She tried to sound reassuring.
Harry grinned. “Really?”
Draco nodded and was then left to his thoughts. He sat there most of the night watching Harry, watching him breathe in and out.
“You never?” Draco didn’t know why he was pushing this. Maybe because Harry had actually been in relationships, Draco had never really been with anyone.
Harry smiled again, his eyes misty. “Draco. When we first met all those years ago I never would have guessed we’d end up here. Then as the years passed I hoped but still never could have truly imagined it. I love you so much that it baffles me, I have never known a love like I feel for you. You have always kept things honest between us, when the world saw me as a Savior, you saw Potter. When the world wanted a Golden Boy, you wanted Harry. Your love has made me better. I know that’s sappy, but it’s true. You make me better. You ask me why I do these things; the answer has always been the same. Because I like you.” Harry slipped the wedding band onto Draco’s finger.
“Are those clean clothes?” He had to not cry again.
“And?” Draco wanted to scream. Stop pretending to care. “Are you stalking me again?”
“So, I might have one more gift for you.” Harry whispered in his ear.
It became a regular thing though they went about their days as normal some nights they slept normally but every few nights one would have a nightmare and the other went to their bed. Potter would quietly come over and climb in with Draco. Or Draco would sneak over hearing Potter scream and comfort him. They always laid next to each other on these nights. Offering to listen. But it was the comfort of company that was most beneficial.  Slowly ever so slowly they started describing their nightmares.
“I want you, inside me now.” Draco rasped out between kisses.
He didn’t have to wonder long. Harry came up. “Hey you.”
“Harry?” Mrs. Weasley yelled as she ran up to the bed too. “Oh, my dear boy, you’ve had us in a fuss.”
“Ok well, DRACO” he exaggerated the name “I have something…” Harry bit his lip.
“I won’t let you fall.” Potter replied sounding more determined.
Two years have passed. Draco was sitting next to Ginny and Hermione. They were at the Burrow for Christmas.
“Excuse me?” Potter replied. Draco wanted to squirm away. Maybe Potter didn’t know.
It shouldn’t have surprised Draco as much as it had that he would be with Saint Potter. Of course, it had to be him. The bloody Savior. The Golden Boy who saved them all. The one who spoke for Draco and his Mother at their trials. The reason Draco was given another chance.
He walked back and Pansy started fretting over him, he ignored her. Madam Pomfrey eyed him as he returned but said nothing.
“Because I like you.” Potter replied. Why was he trying so hard to be friends? Is it because Draco avoids him? Maybe he has to prove something by showing he could even befriend his old enemy.
Draco had never been happier than as he looked into his husband Harry’s eyes.
“And do you?” Draco asked stepping up to him.
“Of course,” Granger beamed back at him. Then she pulled on Draco’s robes to have him follow.
One beautiful Spring day they decided to go to Hogsmeade with their friends. The day went well they were talking and joking. Draco was able to get some new cloths at Gladrags. Harry got some treats from Honeydukes. While Hermione and Pansy were talking about some book they saw at Tombs and Scrolls. They had all just left Hogshead when Draco heard a voice.
“You know” He came in and shut the door behind him “You are allowed to call me Harry.”
“Go ahead” Pomfrey prompted.
“Pomfrey!” Draco yelled. “Mrs. Weasley!”
“I don’t understand what the problem is!”  Draco yelled.
“So, you love me?” Harry asked almost teasingly.
“Do you know now?” She asked softly. He nodded “Then make sure you tell him.” She got up off the ground then. “Freshen up dear I’ll send for new clothes.” She smiled and then left the bathroom.
“Merlin please Harry please I need you inside me.” Draco moaned.
“No” Potter replied softly. Draco nodded and started to get up and leave. “Please stay.” Potter whispered.
There was a pop. “Master? Oh” the house elf stopped.
No one would care. He would be better off. They would all be better off.
Draco focused on his food. If he ignored Potter maybe he would go away.
Draco worked in silence refusing to look up for a long time. When he did Potter was just sitting there doing his own homework. His dark hair falling into his eyes, he tried to push it back but seconds later it fell again. He should tie his hair back, stupid prat. Potter was biting his lip in confusion.
“Harry?” Draco managed to ask.
“Help!” Draco screamed in the large hospital wing. “HELP! Please! Don’t you dare close your eyes Potter! We are here. We are safe. Stop moving.”
This was not the first time Draco had been standing here at the edge. He felt the cold breeze biting at his face. He felt the warmth of the tears as they slid down his face.
Draco looked down he was covered in Harry’s blood, he got up and found the closest sink and started scrubbing. He scrubbed so hard, but it was like the blood wouldn’t go away. Grief took over and he lost it with the bloody soap still in his fist he punched the mirror shattering it pain radiating through his fist.
Harry kissed him deeply again. As he did so Harry’s hands slipped down unbuttoning Draco’s slacks. Draco started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt. His skin felt like it was on fire, every part that touched Harry was tingling with energy.
A few days later Potter was walking beside Draco as he had taken to doing. Draco was just annoyed and hoping he would go away. Potter’s attention was causing Draco’s crush to intensify. Stupid Potter.
“I’m sure you are.” Potter replied. He really needed to work on his tone of voice, he didn’t even sound sarcastic.
“That’s the point Draco, you aren’t trying to understand!” Harry screamed back. “They are my friends. They are like family to me.”
“No, I bloody well will not!” Draco demanded. Potter was pulling on his arm.
Potter was in his face now. “Don’t you fucking dare lie!” Potter’s fist slammed into the wall beside the boy’s head. The brick itself cracked with blue streaks streaming from where his fist collided, it looked like blue lightning. “If I ever see you, or hear you, or even think you might be thinking something so vile again I will not let you off so easy!”
It was Christmas day, Draco woke late. He wasn’t really looking forward to the day. With his father in prison and his mother stuck in the manor there wasn’t much to celebrate. Except this new thing happening with Potter. Harry? Maybe he should call him Harry if they spent so much time snogging.
“What?” Draco asked he must be confused it was no creature!
“Oh Harry!” Draco cried out.
McGonagall came in then with Pomfrey by her side. “Oh, good you are up and eating Mr. Malfoy. I was going to have breakfast sent up soon, looks like Mrs. Weasley beat me to it. Good Morning Molly.”
“Yes, but as is polite, I let them do so in private.” Draco sighed. Really does Potter not know it is rude to interrupt couples and their alone time?
“How do you know when I only just found out?”
“Cheeky bastard” Harry growled as he pushed Draco back towards the bed. Harry started slowly unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. Kissing his chest between each button. As he reached the bottom of the shirt he paused standing up straight again. He cupped Draco’s face in his hands. “Draco if at any point you want to stop. Please tell me. I want this to be perfect. I want to know if you don’t like what I’m doing, or what might feel better. OK?”
Potter moved closer again. His hand came up to Draco’s cheek. Draco couldn’t help himself as Potter leaned into another kiss he asked “Why?”
Draco watched as he slipped off into sleep. He was suddenly fearful that Harry wasn’t going to wake back up again. But then he heard the whisper “I really do love you.”
“Then the war happened, and everything changed. Look I know you heard him when he spoke at you trial. Harry knew so much of what happened to you. Because he witnessed it. He was linked to Voldemort; he saw through his eyes. I had to listen to his screams Draco, his screams as he begged for you to be spared. Harry doesn’t hate you. He knows you had absolutely no choice in the matter. He forgave you long ago. We all did. We have no hate towards you at all so drop it ok?”
“Here I thought it was just Harry who was oblivious.” Weasley walked up to his friend grim faced. “Years he followed you it was ‘Malfoy did this’ or ‘What is Malfoy doing now’ or ‘I wonder who Malfoy is taking to the yule ball’. I also thought he was just shitty at hiding his feelings. But the day he cast that spell on you, when he thought he could have killed you it all clicked for him. He was mad at you, he wanted to cast a hex sure, never anything like that though.”
“How do you feel?” She asked.
“A graduation gift.” Harry shrugged.
Since the start of the term Draco had a rough time. McGonagall had called them all back offering a special eighth year for students who were never able to complete their schooling due to the war.
When night fell Pomfrey insisted Draco go to the next bed and lay down. She threatened to kick him out of the hospital if he did not comply. He frowned but obeyed.
The kiss was more intense than any previous. There was a hunger there that scarred Draco slightly. Draco could feel Harry’s arousal, it matched his own. He wasn’t ready for this though. He pulled away ever so slightly “I’d like that, I want to be your boyfriend.” Harry smiled like it was the best news ever. Then he leaned into the kiss again. This time a quick peck before pulling back.
Harry grinned at him. “I said I have one more gift.”
“Come on Luna will be there.” Potter offered. Damn him. Potter knew he had a soft spot for that Ravenclaw. Luna was always so sweet to him. Even after they imprisoned her. Draco tried to care for her as best as he could, brought her extra food and blankets. He even took punishments to protect her. But he never expected her to treat him the way she has since…as a friend.
“I hope you don’t mind. I knew you spoke French and I searched for special sayings. This one stood out to me, it seemed the most accurate. ‘Nothing is real but dreams and love’.” Harry said looking at the pendent. “I hope it’s not too much.”
Behind Potter the wall had an indention and every crack there was a pulsing blue luminance.  How did he break the stone wall? How was it blue? Almost like lightning…
Before Draco could dwell on it though a snowball smacked into the side of Potter’s face almost dislodging his glasses. The shock on his face caused Draco to burst out laughing.
Potter nodded. Silent. Draco watched as the tears that had been in Potter’s eyes fell slowly. Damn it all.
Potter’s green eyes searched locking on to his own eyes. “It’s going to be ok Potter, just calm down.” Draco looked down at Potter’s shirt it was soaked in blood. It had been white, the blood though, it was everywhere. Draco yanked off his shirt and pressed it into the wounds. He heard Granger try to cast the healing spell, but it wasn’t working something was strange about the blades.
“You know you aren’t the only one with nightmares, right?” Draco said softly. Why? He had no idea. Slytherins do not admit weakness. But he didn’t say he had nightmares just other people. Yes, not Draco.
Harry chuckled.
“Why?” Draco asked confusion still running strong.
Draco’s head hit the ground and in the dust, he saw the other man had gone rigid. He was ecstatic, he lived! Then he saw Potter drop to his knees.
“Fine, but only for a few minutes.” Draco glared.
“What?” Draco wondered.
“Really?” Draco asked looking into his face.
Harry nodded. He looked so tired. “You need sleep. We have plenty of time to talk. Rest, heal, get better. Because I don’t care what you say, these beds are horrible.”
“You need any help?” a voice asked.
Draco didn’t give Potter a chance to reply. He went back towards the eighth-year dorms. Even though all the eighth years shared a common room they were at least granted individual rooms. Draco didn’t even look back to see if Potter followed. He didn’t care. Potter and his stupid friends always butting their noses into everything.
“Come on Hermione and Ron are down by the lake.” Potter grinned.
The next few hours were spent in a flood of people coming to see and speak mostly to Harry. Harry refused to let Draco get up for long. He clung to his hand like it was his life source. Once all had settled down, mostly because Pomfrey realized Harry was worn out and needed a break, they finally had a moment to relax.
It was a month later they had their first fight.
“And? That gives you the right to attack?” Potter stepped forward as he spoke. Each word was asked with such anger Draco shivered. “You feel that you have right to attack anyone who’s sexual preference is different than your own? What about me? Am I next on your list?”
“Cho was the first time I kissed anyone. And yeah, that was weird. She cried the whole time. Ginny, we kissed, it was…I don’t know…we both realized that it wasn’t right. And we didn’t want to force it. That’s it I’ve never done more than kisses. And the kisses were nothing. I mean absolutely nothing compared to just our first kiss.” Harry kissed Draco’s neck. “Each kiss since then has just sealed the fact that you are the one I want. The one I want to kiss.” He kissed him. “The one I want to hold” Harry pulled Draco closer. “The one I want in my bed.”
The dining hall could be so loud sometimes. Draco really wanted to avoid it, however Pansy flipped out on him for missing a few meals. So, he had to promise to come to the Great Hall. Draco tried to ignore the glares, the whispers. It would be much easier if his friends were here, they were probably off snogging again.
Draco nodded and pulled up a chair. Pomfrey messed with Harry’s bandages a bit and then left them alone. Draco looked at him and the tears returned.
A faint smile appeared on Harry’s face. He then squeezed Draco’s hand ever so gently.
“I didn’t punch his face.” Potter growled. The intensity caused Draco’s stomach to knot up. Damn what was the Savior doing to him?
Potter wore a fake smile. Anytime someone wasn’t looking at him he let it slip from his face. He didn’t laugh. His friends all talked and joked around him, but he never laughed. Potter always had a reason to avoid quidditch, he had to study, or tutor, or was just missing.
“Don’t, please Potter.” Draco pleaded. “Potter! Harry!” The green eyes were closing. “Please HELP!”
4! 	Harry pulled Draco closer.
Harry pulled out a small box and Draco’s breath stopped. His heart stopped.
“No! For fucks sake Draco, I just want you guys to not hate being around each other!” Harry turned away shoulders slumped.
Within ten minutes Draco was bundled up and walking out the common room with Potter. Potter was giddy as a child. Draco always loved snow, but not as much as it appeared the Gryffindor next to him did. Once they were outside he wondered what they would do.
“Um…no…I” The boy stumbled over his words.
“He said that my family ruined everything. And he wanted me to die.” Draco glared at the man.
“You really don’t know, do you?” A voice came from behind him.
“I do.” Potter replied. “You won’t be able to fall.”
Draco looked at the boy sleeping next to him. He then felt his hand, at some point he must have grabbed Harry’s hand, because their fingers were intertwined.
“I love you too.” Draco said before kissing him. “I’ll go.”
Draco just sat there confused. Then he started replaying the things that had been happening. The fact that Draco could always calm his nightmares. The look on Harry’s face when he saw Draco. The grin that had been so prevalent lately. The laughter that had come back into the Gryffindors life. The way they always found a reason to be near each other. The smiles that Draco always felt when he saw Harry. The way he looked forward to seeing him anytime they actually had to separate for any reason. The way Draco felt watching Harry fall in front of him bleeding. The way his heart broke thinking that could be the end.
Madam Pomfrey came over in a flash. She poured a potion down Harry’s throat. She searched over his wounds and poured something else there. The bleeding slowed.
Harry looked back at him with a smile. “Because I like you.”
“I am truly hesitant to guess Molly. He is breathing and his heart is beating. Both are excellent signs. However, the wounds still are not closing. We are keeping him on blood replenishing potion. Then there is the fact he still has not woken up. He has shown no signs of being alert. I’m not sure if it was the poison, the wound itself, or the shock of it all.” Pomfrey said all of that as matter of factly as possible. Again, her voice softened her tone changed. “It’s up to Harry. He must fight this. I think he is; he is nothing but stubborn. He just needs his body to cooperate. I am doing my best to aide him.”
“Nobody cares.” Draco leaned forward. He should do it.
“What do you mean this time?” Draco almost turned. Screw that. He should just go one more step and all his pain would be gone.
“No damn it! I want to spend time with you. And I do. All the time. I just feel like I’ve been neglecting them.” Harry sighed.
The look on her face was not comforting. “Mr. Potter is stable.”  The look she gave him was soft. “He is breathing, and his heart is trying. That is better than most people who have faced similar situations.” She helped him stand. “Come over.” She walked slowly with Draco to the next bed. There was Harry looking like he was not even breathing. She had removed his shirt and he was now wrapped in gauze. He could see where the wounds were the padding was thicker and the blood was already starting to seep through, so slowly.
“Do you want to talk?” Draco asked. Unsure of which answer he wanted to hear.
“He’s going to be ok” she insisted this time. Pulling him into another hug.
All of a sudden Harry stopped running his fingers through his hair and Draco looked up confused. Harry placed a small box on Draco’s chest.
“You look it too.” Draco teased. Harry tried to laugh but groaned in pain.
“Oh, not other people.” Draco whined again. “I hate other people. And they hate me.”
The sun was out and it was a beautiful day. Warm and comfortable. Other kids were running around and joking. Some were splashing in the lake. Some were playing with some sort of muggle ball, Harry told him it was a football.
“Did everyone but me know how he felt?”
“Malfoy!” The man called as he walked up the street, “Hey Malfoy!”
He forced himself on though. “When we were at the manor, he knew that you knew it was him. He wanted to bring you along, but he also knew if you left it might kill your parents. He couldn’t bring himself to do that to you. So, we left, and it tore him apart. Knowing that he had your wand, leaving you basically defenseless…”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Potter said the muscles in his jaw were still tense, twitching in anger. Potter met his gaze, the green eyes almost seemed electric.
“Really.” Harry confirmed with a soft chuckle.
“Mr. Potter!” A curt voice called from down the hall. “Mr. Roberts, you will need to report to Professor Flitwick. I will be informing him of your…views on homosexuality. As well as your preference to attack unsuspecting students. We do not tolerate such behavior in this school.” The boy ran away, terrified.
“Do they hate me?” Draco asked accusingly.
Eventually he felt someone come sit next to him and pull him into a hug. He didn’t even register who it was for a long time he couldn’t stop the flood of emotions.
“He realized then something I’d known for years and had kinda wished wasn’t true. He was there too the night you lowered your wand, under his cloak, Dumbledore had frozen him. He saw the whole thing. Then while we were traveling trying to find each damn horcrux he would often see Voldemort. The things he did when he was particularly angry. Each one caused Harry to freak a bit. But the ones that had him screaming. Were the ones about you. Anytime he saw you heard he begged it to end. He screamed. Such screams it was hard to hear.” Weasley’s voice grew tight.
“Because I like you.”
“He, Godric he tried to kill me he might have killed Harry! Why?” Draco fell to the ground. Pansy was at his side.
“I just really like these beds” Harry smiled.
“How?” Draco managed.
“I had a dream” a soft voice whispered. Draco almost screamed. “I had a dream you loved me.”
The next thing Draco knew the sun was shining in his eyes and he realized that he was asleep on Potter’s bed. He sat up slowly and realized that Potter had already gotten up. Draco quickly scurried out of the bed before someone came in and thought there was something going on.
“Thank you” Draco said as he entered the last stall.
Snow balls flew past the tree, Potter and Draco moved closer together. They were touching again. Suddenly Draco didn’t feel as cold as he had a minute ago. They were facing each other, Draco could feel Potter’s breathing. Potter reached up pushing some of Draco’s hair away from his eyes. Draco’s breath caught in his chest.
“Yeah well you love me too.” Draco teased back.
“Sure.” Draco frowned. Of course, they hate him! After all he did, he didn’t blame them.
“According to Professor Slughorn you are a prodigy.” Draco raised an eyebrow. Was the Golden Boy admitting his flaws?
Draco thought she was talking to Harry, so he remained quiet. Then she turned though facing him. “Oh, dear you look ill too, you haven’t eaten, have you? Here love I have a few things.” Mrs. Weasley started pulling out biscuits and bacon and even a bowl of eggs from her purse. Draco wanted to turn it down, but his belly was a traitor and it chose that moment to growl loudly. “Here love, Harry is so very fond of you, he would hate to see you neglecting yourself.” She placed on the food on the table next to him and then produced a fork.
Draco was in the astronomy tower. His brain going over the scenes that happened here. Dumbledore standing here, the mark shining in the sky. He knew, he had known Draco had tried and failed to kill him throughout the year. Even in the end when Draco was standing there and Dumbledore was defenseless he couldn’t kill him. Dumbledore knew Draco was being forced and did nothing to try to intervene because it would have killed Draco, killed his family. Dumbledore saved him. And died because of it. Draco lowered his wand, but Dumbledore still died.
Suddenly snow was dumped on their heads. They pulled apart breathless and cold. Potter glared at the Weasley girl.
One day it was Granger who came up to him and asked why he felt the need to continue. His reason was because that was how they worked right. They hated him, and he hated them, right?
“Fuck, Harry. Stop. I’m too close.” Draco pulled Harry up. Kissing his so deeply he didn’t even notice the taste of himself for a moment. Even when he did he couldn’t be bothered by it. “I want you.”
“I have had several nurses from St. Mungo’s visit and help as they could. The fact is this all depends on him. If his body is strong enough, he will pull through. He has just been through so much, I’m not sure how much longer his body can fight.” Madam Pomfrey went over to Harry and checked his eyes. “His friends have come and gone several times. So, have yours. I’d bet they would be happy to see you come back to the common room.”
“Kreacher?” Potter whispered.
“Only Harry, he pushed Draco out of harm’s way. And I was too slow, I cast too slow.” Hermione was crying.
At that Weasley outright laughed. “You’ve been nothing but good for him. Mind you, except for this” he paused thinking. “And the childish crap from before. The changes in him since you two started your ‘friendship’ have been astonishing.”
Behind Draco were his two closest friends Blaise and Pansy. Next to him Harry grinned. Harry’s best friends were behind him. Ron was holding Hermione’s hand, Hermione was crying softly. In between Harry and Draco was Luna, she was their officiant. And it was just as weird as you could imagine. It was perfect.
“You think this is so funny?”  Potter asked mischief clear in his face.
2!	Draco tried to remember to breathe.
“I don’t think you understand Madam he is one of my boys!” A plump red headed woman bustled in and straight to Harry. “Oh love, you poor dear.”  She fretted about him pushing his hair off to the side, feeling his head, then her hand rested on his cheek. Without turning she spoke again “Were you here all-night, love?”
“I could help you with that if you want?” Potter looked almost hopeful. “I could use help with Potions so it would be a win-win.”
It was night times though Draco noticed the issues. Potter stayed out of the room. All this time Draco had been under the impression it was to avoid him, but now he thought it was to avoid sleep.  Draco normally went to bed long before Potter came back to the room. Now he stayed up, sometimes pretending to sleep. It was those nights he watched as Potter laid there starring into the darkness, or worse try to sleep and start thrashing. Draco knew about nightmares. He just never thought the savior would have them.
Harry pushed in so very slowly. Oh, it hurt, but felt amazing all at once. “Slow” was all Draco could say. Harry filled him up, he probably should have seen how big Harry was before starting, but he couldn’t stop now. “Move, just slowly.”
“Take them to the hospital wing please Kreacher!” Granger begged.
“Do you really think we hate you?” Draco nodded. Granger just sighed. “We don’t. I don’t think we ever really did you know? Yes, you were pretty horrible at times. But so were we. We were all just school kids. Rivals before the war.”
Draco moaned and released his hand, wrapping both his arms around Harry. Harry tugged a little harder forcing Draco’s head back so he could attack his neck. The kisses were gentle then he added a lick and a bite. Draco stumbled back into his now open door. Harry was doing his wandless magic again. Damn that was hot.
It had been a week and nothing happened. Draco frowned.
8! 	Harry took Draco’s hand.
There was Potter with a big grin. Damn even in his half-asleep state the bloody boy was gorgeous.  “Happy Christmas.”
There were a few gifts at the foot of his bed. Draco sat up and scooted down. One was from his mother. There were a bunch of his favorite chocolates as well as a new book. There was another gift from his aunt Andromeda that was a new quill set.
Eventually they started hanging around each other more, spending time with each other’s friends. They would study sometimes, they would just relax, or they would talk.
“Hugo? Fetch the Headmistress. I’d advise her to call for Aurors.” Pomfrey said curtly. A portrait in front of her quickly disappeared.
Once the sobs slowed, he looked up into the sad face of the Weasley mother. He couldn’t understand why she was so nice to him. So, he asked “Why? Why are you so kind to me? I almost killed one of your sons. I was the reason the Death Eaters were here when your other son was killed. My father almost killed your daughter. Why?”
“When it matters.” Potter replied.
As if reading his mind Harry continued. “I know we haven’t really talked about us, I mean I know I want more than just snogs in the shadows. I haven’t asked, probably because I am scared, scared I am putting myself out there. I’ve just…” Harry took a deep breath “I’ve fancied you for a while, a long while. I want us to be more. I’d like to actually be boyfriends.”
“I just found out! I didn’t know!” he whined.
“Yes. I love you.” Harry said breath puffing against Draco’s face.
“Poppy?” McGonagall’s voice sounded as she rushed into the room. Behind her were two Aurors.
“Neither have I” Harry said with a grin. “I was kinda busy the last few years.”
“Happy Christmas Potter” Draco smiled.
“I asked why you are hanging out with that FAG?” the boy practically spat. “He is not worth the time of day.”
McGonagall walked over to Harry then. Draco followed her, he had to get away from that man before he tried again to do something.
It was New Years Eve and all the eighth years were celebrating in the common room. Harry and Draco among them. There were games and drinks, but the two of them sat cuddled together on the couch. The countdown was close. Ron came around handing out cups of firewhisky. Harry and Draco stood to join the others as they shouted the countdown.
They spent the rest of the night on the sofa under a cashmere blanket wrapped in each others arms, Tom feeding him chocolates every so often, who knew the man loved chocolate so much, Tom though he would have to stock up on the chocolate if he wanted Severus in a good mood.
Poor Harry
((Sev is a sensitive soul in this right))
"Hermione you have something on your head" said Seamus next to her.
He just turned round to Harry and his friends who where shocked to say the least and took them to Charms saying nothing of how and why he was like this now.
"Otiz can you stand here for me while the Madam measures you for your clothes?" asked Harry only to get a happy nod in return.
Minerva- Minnie
You are confined to you dorm room until your parents have been contacted, I know your brother Percy would have written to them as well" said Minerva to the girl making eye contact with Severus by the door.
"So you prefer me over him then? You know I have tried to kill him many times as well as Hadrian" but he was only met back with another trill and then he had a beak nuzzling his hair happily.
He took a deep breath and took hold of the goblet and started drinking, my Merlin it was horrible, the rusty taste in his mouth, he wanted to spit it out but at the same time he wanted to keep drinking so then he would be finally out of Dum-Dum's filthy hands that wanted to use him for his own stupid little game.
"That hurt".
"Move squirt" they both said as the walked passed him, sounding so much like female versions of Fred and George.
"Please don't shout Harry I'm sitting right in front of you. Yes I would like Lucius and Narcissa to be your godparents, you and Draco will have to find some common ground to start a new. You both love to play Quidditch, how about going from there, perhaps it might become a friendship in the future" and Severus got up and left the table leaving Harry slightly shocked that his enemy would in fact in days would be his god brother!
"Oh haha very funny Haddy, as I was saying Dumbledore can't do anything about it as everything is registered at Gringotts and the Ministry, if you go back to "that place" Uncle Sev will come and get you right away" and he messed up Harry's hair more.
"Now I would like to explain the new comer to our house as many of you already know him by a different name from last year but I would like to introduce him as one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, my son...."
It was after that day that Draco started watching Potter, in a more observative fashion, rather than to find something to make fun of him for.
“So, the fact that I wanted to spend the weekend with you is wrong?” Draco demanded.
The pain was gone now, only pleasure remained.
“Sometimes ma’am I’m sure you are giving me some gross liquids calling them potions just to make me squirm.” Harry rasped out after taking the potions and sputtering.
“You’ll never know” Pomfrey said with a wink.
“I’m not sure Minerva. I have a faint heartbeat.” Pomfrey was casting spells Draco had never seen before. “The blades were poisoned. The wounds don’t want to close.”
“Shh!” Madam Prince hissed from her desk.
“It’s perfect.” Draco breathed. He turned towards Harry. “Why?”
Eventually Draco must have fallen asleep. Because he woke to the sunlight shining in. And something was different.
“Because I like you.”
“Why are you hanging with that fag?” The boy sneered.
Draco felt his world swirling, it was crashing, and he didn’t know what to do. He fell to his knees again. The sounds around him were faint and distant. Harry can’t die. Not after all this. Then Draco’s world went dark.
“Why would you help me?” Draco wondered aloud.
Harry did just that. He pulled out and slowly pushed back into him setting a slow but steady pace. Harry gripped Draco’s hips firmly for a moment before leaning down placing one hand beside Draco’s chest, the other he pulled Draco up towards him kissing him.
He swiftly left and went to where Harry was sitting on the floor against the wall. He slid down and took the hand of his lover, who looked up and smiled tiredly. He pecked Draco's lips and leaned on him, where they sat in silence until they got called back in.
"Well good morning to you too."
"You don't have to darling. I understand. But why?"
, sobbing in the background.
Every chuckled lightly.
Mrs. Weasely looked at Dumbledore is disbelief. This man put her son in harm's way for the 'greater good'?! No wonder he looked so distraught at her scolding the boys after using the car without permission. Her eyes widened, and suddenly so many things clicked.
Harry sighed, opening his eyes to look at Draco.
to talk about yesterday,"
Somebody cleared their throat, and Draco looked to see the entire Order, along with Ron and Hermione, in the kitchen, looking at them. Some looked horrified, others shocked, others appalled, still others just plain confused.
Everyone was shocked when the tone of Lucius' words softened slightly,
"And I decided that he could come here."
"I almost wiped my memory. Did you know that? I had a breakdown over the Dursleys that was so bad, I was about to wipe my memory. All my friends, my family, my teachers, all gone just to get rid of the Dursleys. That's how badly I hated living there. Ron stopped me, but imagine if I did? Wipe my memory?"
Mrs. Weasley smiled proudly and put her hands to her chest,
Once Draco let out a sigh of relief, Harry knew it was safe to talk. He smiled and tip-toed to pecked Draco on the forehead, cracking a smile out of the man. Draco's palms rested lazily on Harry's cheek while he looked him in the eye,
"Please don't make it sound like that."
Draco trailed off, not being able to think of anywhere he could go without the chances of him being killed being higher than what he would like it to be.
He asked to no one in particular.
He carefully got up from around Harry the best he could without disturbing him and started the day. It was late, about 9:30, but he wanted Harry to sleep as much as possible.
Even though this was Harry's house, nobody questioned Mrs. Weasley's authority. Harry, not exactly wanting to reveal to a room of people the abuse the Dursleys put him through, mumbled out,
Harry smiled softly and leaned into Draco, sighing.
"What is going on!"
Draco answered slightly confused,
"Whatever you say,
Draco shrugged his shoulder,
Mrs. Weasley looked towards her son, and Ron just stood by Hermione. He continued for Hermione,
"You will spy on your family for us. And once you are done, you can return here for safety."
"Why don't we just be upfront about it? Tell them the whole truth?"
He looked to Draco,
Draco put an arm around Harry's middle as his boyfriend curled up into a ball for some much-needed sleep, judging by the bags beneath his eyes.
"11:32!"
Draco explained, ignoring the entire room watching,
Draco finished breakfast and resolved to check up on Harry, see if he was awake.
He knew Draco didn't want to talk about it; trust me, he knew. But this was a unique occasion, and they didn't have time for beating around the bush. It's not like Draco had to go into graphic detail, he just needed to give a reason the others would accept.
Draco checked his watch,
"I love you. So so so so much..."
Hoping for the best, he went to open the door and anticipated some sort of hex to go through him. There was nothing.
"He's not coming today."
Scoffing, Ron rebutted,
"Thanks for helping out Draco, I finished up the rest and wiped down the counter a bit. Hey, what's up with them?"
Harry jumped for the other side of the bed, attempting to drag Draco over with him. To his horror, Draco resisted and stayed in the same place. Harry cowered slightly, memories of the Dursely's flooding back in and drowning him. Water in his eyes, he could see the blurry figure of his boyfriend sitting on the opposite side of the bed.
"Alright. So, my parents weren't exactly...fun. Being there was...stifling. I had to stay in a certain mold they had for me. I guess they thought I would turn out how they wanted if they didn't let me try anything different."
Deciding he could no longer delay the inevitable by sinking himself into memory and nostalgia, he placed a kiss on Draco's nose softly, watching Draco's eyes flutter open and turn up in joy once he smiled at the beautiful sight before him. Draco reached out his arm and ruffled Harry's hair, smiling once Harry chuckled.
"No, we're not. We will be discussing what the fuck is going on between you and Harry! And why you're here!"
"'The greater good'. Right. Forgot about that part."
Harry gave Ron a look. Draco's head shot up with desperation,
Hermione smiled to herself,
"He's in the Gryffindor dorms. Said he couldn't come to class today."
"But they were also nice to me...sometimes..."
Harry pulled back with clouded eyes, startling Draco. Harry smiled sadly and muttered with a broken voice a statement that shocked and terrified Draco,
"I don't suggest it, they have more pressing matters to discuss than our relationship status."
"Yes."
"How did you get in here?"
He tried to bring Harry's head up to look at him, but Harry only resisted, pushing farther into Draco's body.
Draco's eye's widened and he furiously shook his head,
"So, what are your plans with this place? Stay? Leave?"
In the distance, Teddy plays a game of Quidditch with the boys of the village. Draco’s gaze trails after him as he dives down, looking for the snitch.
"Hope is a mistake," Potter says. "If you can't fix what’s broken... you'll go insane."
“How often?”
He's out of time. He doesn’t know who speaks first, him or the Riders, but he’s yelling Potter’s name and running fast. The Rig comes to life, engine roaring mixed in with the sound of gunfire.
“We’re just getting started,” he tells them. “Grab everything you can and let’s go.”
In reality, he wasn’t expecting to see Potter until New Years which isn’t that far off. But that’s beside the point.  Potter is inside his house. And now that he’s here... well, Draco’s been raised with good manners.
“He’s coming to get me!” he hears her shout, raw and deranged.
Draco relaxes at the table, rests his chin on a hand, and swirls around the ice cubes in his glass. The teasing is familiar territory for them. There are too many shared secrets and memories that the war shaped them to be. They share a plate of treats and it feels so simple and easy.
“Keep them off me,” Draco yells and keeps his course. It gets dirty and deadly fast, but Ace and the lancers are still by his side and that’s not for nothing. They’ve survived countless raids and ambushes.
“I sometimes come here still. When the days are harder. Helps me get my mind off things. Though it’s different when I don’t have my own personal tour guide telling me what to look out for.”
Draco reaches for him and Harry lets himself be moved. Draco’s fingers softly pull at his hair again and he closes his eyes as Draco gently pushes his head down onto his cock. He rolls his hips when Harry wraps his lips around the cockhead.
“I’m afraid not. I’m only here until Sunday evening and then I must head back. Work calls.”
He finds Pansy already in the guest bedroom sitting at the vanity. Draco kisses the top of her head and takes the cigarette from her fingers. He brings it to his mouth for a profound drag.
The others look at Potter, confused. Potter gets off his motorcycle and pulls a piece of cloth from inside his jacket. It’s a small map. He points at the center where he’s drawn the brand of the Citadel. “This is your way home.”
“The only parent I’ve ever known was my mother. Now that I drive a War Rig, I’m never going to have a better chance.”
He drags Draco here one evening, long after the sun has set and shows him what they’ve been growing from Pomona’s seeds. There is a shrine for her up here—it had been Luna’s idea—and Harry thinks she would have loved it. The windmills chime with the soft breeze that blows through.
Just a little closer...
All bets are off after the dinner and cake cutting. There is dancing and laughter. They lose track of time, determined to get lost in the need to have a splendid evening.
"You never ask, dear. Besides it's the Manor," his mother replies like that's enough answer. It isn't but she has a point.
He takes Luna’s hand when she offers it and stands up, wincing.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this and now he feels like he can’t breathe. When he didn’t have nightmares, going home was all he ever dreamed about. It gave him purpose. Now it’s like he can’t remember anything at all, feeling control slip through his fingers. His chest contorts into something painful and foreign. He can’t fucking breathe.
The marble is cold against his bare feet when he lightly pads into the kitchen. He has in mind what he could bring back up, realizing as well that he could eat something too. He pulls a bottle from the wine cellar and carefully settles an assortment of leftover treats, cheeses, meats, and fruit on a cutting board. He carefully levitates them and walks back up the stairs and to his bedroom. Harry is still on the bed, the sheets pooled at his hips and he looks over to Draco when he walks through the door. He sets the board and wine at the small table in front of the fireplace and tends to the embers.
After the sun sets they settle in for a long night’s ride. Ginny offers to watch the rear just in case and she disappears through the hatch. Potter sits next to Draco and runs inventory with Pansy. Draco watches them out of the corner of his eye; sees the way Potter mutters quietly to himself while reloading clips and passing bullets to Pansy’s outstretched palm.
He then moves so that he’s kissing along the side of Draco’s collarbone, lips stopping at the first scar on his chest and moving as it spreads into two, three scarred lines. He takes his time, leaving kisses and touches all over Draco’s chest and ribs, through smooth and rough skin. Arousal flares and shoots to his cock when he feels Draco’s hands in his hair, giving a soft pull. Harry moves until he’s kneeling in between Draco’s legs. He hums, content as if he’s exactly where he belongs.
“You,” she says, her left eye focusing on him and when she realizes who he is, she breaks out into a laugh. “I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance.”
Harry looks up from his book, blinking back the sun and Draco leans forward, his hat providing shade. After a beat, Draco realizes that Harry is waiting for him to continue. He swallows.
He coats his fingers and reaches between Harry’s legs, fingers skimming down the crack of his arse. Harry’s brows knit as soon as Draco slowly presses a finger inside his rim. He’s gentle at first, wanting to make this good for Harry. He lets Harry get used to the feel of him before he adds a second finger and slowly starts stretching, fingers scissoring.
Somehow all these years she still manages to find ways to make him feel like a child again.
Bellatrix’s dagger almost catches him, rips into the shoulder fabric of his jacket instead. He’s so angry and she is a force, deadly. She’s bleeding, Harry having twisted her own dagger into the meat of her chest and she presses on, smiling as the dagger sinks in deeper just so that she can get close enough to laugh in his face.
Draco falls on top of Harry and they lay there for a moment catching their breath, lungs heaving. Knowing that he must start to feel some discomfort, Harry pulls away from Draco and gently moves them so that Draco is on his back. He sighs as he lets his left knee fall, completely spent.
Suddenly now that she’s said it, Harry knows what he has to do. He rummages through the small compartment and other junk, his hands shaking until he finds what he’s looking for: a knife.
“What’s your name, then?”
“This blood bag wants me dead,” Draco grits out and pulls on the chains
“Hi there,” comes the voice behind him and his heart stops.
“Go help him, would you? I’m afraid he might have lost his way.”
Finally, he pulls off Harry’s cock, lips wet with spit and precome, and runs his tongue alongside his lips. He pulls his fingers free from Harry’s arse. The obscene squelch of lube makes his own cock ache, precome dripping from the tip.
Draco knows what to expect at the dinner party later tonight. He knows that he can’t bail no matter what. It still doesn’t make getting ready any easier. He settles on a cashmere sweater with dark trousers. The trench coat is a little overkill but he wears it anyway. He knows that he won’t be the most over dressed. He decides at the last minute to walk from his hotel. It's a nice night out. He finds an alleyway to duck into later to disapparate onto the street of Blaise and Ginny’s home.
After a few more seconds of silence Potter opens the door and slides over. Draco considers it progress.
“Every time I saw you, all the time—nnh,” Harry sighs, eyes fluttering closed when Draco takes him back in his mouth again. “That night of the wedding, you looked so beautiful, so gorgeous. I wanted to kiss you so badly.”
It’s the blood bag from earlier.
“Get them home,” he whispers again in Harry’s ear and when he pulls back, Draco’s fallen unconscious.
Potter doesn’t respond, but he gives a nod at Draco and it’s all he needs before he cuts the engine and opens the door. He’s only been here under the cover of night and now here under the sun, he knows he’s being watched. He walks to the end of the Rig and raises his hands. It’s too quiet.
“The closest I felt to feeling complete was—” Potter continues.
He leans up and Draco watches him, eyes dark and pupils blown wide. He puts his hand over Draco’s cock, feeling his hardness through the thin material of his pants.
“After Carlo’s death, it was hard to stay. I’m more of a consultant these days helping Hermione and Pansy when they need an extra set of eyes. Or sometimes at Hogwarts. I still want to help but in my own way.”
“Being around the Citadel and getting captured... Is that why you didn’t put up a fight when I found you?”
“You’re supposed to eat it,” he says when Draco gives him a look. “It won’t kill you, I promise.”
The first time Draco sees him, it's the night before he’s meant to escape. Rumors were going around earlier in the day that the war boys had caught a fresh one. There hadn’t been someone whose blood tasted that good in a long time. Pure fuel, the war boys had called it. The rumors spread fast and soon everyone was curious—wanting to see the blood bag for themselves. Now Draco’s meeting with Gertie, the mechanic, and going over inventory when he sees the blood bag. His hair is wild, covering most of his face and for a brief moment all Draco can see are the piercing green eyes staring back at him. He’s got a gag tied tight around his mouth and he puts up a good fight trying to escape. Draco watches him, sees the way he overpowers most of the war boys. Eventually he realizes he’s outnumbered, stops resisting, and lets himself be manhandled onto a chair.
“Draco, you’re beautiful,” Harry says as he touches him, hand finally wrapping around his cock. Draco bites his lip and spreads his knees, and slowly thrusts into Harry’s hand. Precome pools from the head and Harry presses the end of his thumb against the slit, watching intently when Draco’s hips stutter. It’s agony, how much he wants this to last. His strokes start off slow, teasing even. He draws precome down Draco’s cock with the pad of his thumb, lightly trailing the underside of his cock all the way down to his balls.
“Well, I did free myself, didn’t I? I was doing just fine until you came around.”
He doesn’t know exactly how long they stand there looking at one another but when Draco looks down at his wrists and sees the chains have been snapped, he doesn’t hold back. The fight is short-lived but rough and it ends with the blood bag pressed up against the wall. Draco’s got a knife pointed just under his chin. Eyes so green furiously stare back at him. Adrenaline pumps through Draco’s body but he keeps himself grounded and even, breathing softly.
A rage so potent and pure swells up in Draco’s chest that gives him a second wind. The thought comes to him easily and materializes itself clear as day—as if this is what it was always going to come down to: Lucius dies today.
“This is incredible. You’ve gotten better.” Potter says after a while, looking impressed and Draco laughs because of course, leave it to Potter to be the true critic.
“Fenrir and his pack ruined the soil. They drove us out. We had nowhere to go,” Poppy says. There is sadness in her face.
“Harry,” Draco obliges because it feels right.
“Home,” Draco whispers and Harry feels his heart go rigid.
“Did you get here together?” she asks, finally realizing that she’s got both of them standing outside her front door and Draco pales.
“Then she is safe with Potter,” Draco says though he’s not sure if he’s saying that to reassure himself.
“How are you feeling?” Draco asks, curious as he helps Blaise set out the wine glasses.
“Nicked them for myself after the boys took ‘em from you. Not that I was expecting to see you again, really. These are hard to come by. Figured it was worth something further down the line but since you’re here... I’d keep them out of sight.”
When he’s flush against Harry’s arse, he slowly pulls back before thrusting back in and falters at how Harry’s hole stretches around him so perfectly. He has to close his eyes, hold himself still for a second.
When he looks further up ahead, he sees Padma on the Gigahorse helping Draco climb aboard. Turning his back on Bellatrix doesn’t hurt as much, doesn’t make him vibrate with hatred. It’s here, in this moment where Harry doesn’t think about anything else except reaching Draco.
Potter looks around for anything to latch onto and then they both see it: the metal bars above the cow catcher attached to the front of the truck. Potter then looks up at Draco and he knows then that they’re on the same page. Draco veers the Rig closer to the truck until Potter is within reach of the metal bars.
He has a brief moment of panic, wondering if he’s been caught, if they’ve found out his plans for escape. He wonders if they’ve found the rations and belongings that he stored underneath the tanker of the Rig. He’s out of his room and barely around one corner of a passageway when something crashes into him and pushes him back hard.
Potter nods. “Er, I did, yeah. I know how long these kinds of things take. You were very thorough.”
In the living room, everyone sat on couches, love seats, and the floor around the coffee table. Luna, Daphne, Hermione, and Ron are sitting around the coffee table and playing a very serious game of Exploding Snap.
There’s one lancer still left and they're aiming a harpoon to the driver’s side. Draco’s eyes widen and he falls back inside, heart racing and hands digging into Potter’s jacket as he pulls him away from the window. The harpoon narrowly misses Potter’s head and instead it slams into the steering wheel. The pull back snaps the wheel right off and it jams Potter’s left hand, crushing it against the center pillar of the Rig. Draco looks around frantically for anything he could use, wasting no time to debate if this plan was going to work or not, and starts closing a spanner over the steering column. Ginny opens the back door and Luna helps her step outside. She lifts the bolt cutters and snaps the harpoon cable.
Draco turns over the postcard and it’s heavy in his hands. Printed on fine card stock, it has one of the paintings from said secret floor. From Mucha’s
On the Gigahorse, Harry watches as the last war boy slams Draco against the door hatch. Even through the roar of the engines he can hear both of them yell as they fight over the last harpoon. There’s a brief moment where Harry doesn’t recognize Draco and the inhuman source of pure rage written all over his face.
“No, not wrong,” Harry says, looking at Teddy. “He’ll probably make the team first year, too.”
. He takes his quill and writes back with a smile tugging at his lips.
Potter shows up at his side fifteen minutes later. He eventually swerves into his path until he cuts Draco off and he has no choice but to come to a stop.
against his prostate.
“Tell me,” Draco asks as he rests his forehead against Harry’s. “Please?”
“Remember when I hosted Luna and Pansy’s engagement party at my house?” Harry says.
Draco sits between her and Potter. There was an open space next to Potter and he didn’t think twice about taking it. With every minute, Draco tries to not hyper-fixate on the closeness he feels sitting next to him. At one point, Potter readjusts and moves close enough to Draco that their thighs touch. He feels the warmth coming off Potter like a brand. Potter makes no effort to move, his full attention engrossed instead in conversation with Ginny and Hermione.
“I don’t have any plans,” Potter says.
There was a reason why they did the supply runs during the day—why Draco grew up with tales of the dangers of the night. It seemed like a myth, a folk tale. Out here now, in the middle of the bog, it felt very real. Far in the distance behind them, Draco sees them. He has to narrow his eyes, adjusting to the flicker of motion: a large shadow moving through the fog.
Draco looks down and sees that Potter is still wearing the makeshift bandage around his hand. His mother’s scarf. “Where is he now?”
“Little gift from back home?” Blaise asks, taking the bottle and looking over the label. It’s one of their favorite wines. It reminds them of the summers they used to spend at the villas during their fourth year. Of too many hot summers and picnics under the sun.
“Do I remember that in this very room is where you came up to talk to me? Absolutely.”
“No one would dare to steal the Wives from Lucius. Everyone knows that they are his property.”
“He’s hurt!” she shouts, concern written all over her face. “He’s hurt real bad.”
“Last one,” Draco says when they reach the Rig. “Possibly leaving to warn the rest of the pack. If they find us stuck here, we’re done for.”
“It’s not perfectly healed,” she says, warmth in her eyes and she tucks back a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “But at least it’s closed over.”
Slowly, Draco takes a step towards the water hose. At the same time the gun is turned on him immediately and he freezes.
When Draco looks up he sees that Ginny has moved ahead, having ignored the fight completely completely. She’s reaching for the door of the Rig when two more warning shots are fired, one grazing her leg.
Before he met Draco he was a man reduced to the single instinct of surviving in a world that wanted him dead. Living as a feral animal hunted by scavengers and haunted by those he couldn’t protect. In search of revenge he instead found himself caught in between Draco and his escape, his compassion, and will to do the right thing. He’s seen the good in others but it had certainly been longer since he thought it was possible to be unbroken again. To love again. He had gotten used to it; being a road warrior searching for a righteous cause, who ran from both the living and the dead. When Draco got in his way, Harry found himself wanting to stay.
He wants to look up, see if he’s been caught, but instead looks behind and sees the war parties far in the distance, getting closer. And there it is again, the noise. It’s coming from inside the tank and it’s loud.
“It’s good to see you,” Potter then says and Draco stops for a second before taking a large sip from his own glass. He waits for the gin to settle down his throat as if it will give him the courage for what to say next.
“Thanks,” he says, eyes warm.
“Kill switches,” Draco says. “I set the sequence myself. This Rig goes nowhere without me.”
“That’s too long to remember,” Draco says, voice quiet.
At that he presses forward, speeding up a little until he sees Draco and he looks at Harry. His eyes are glassy and pale. Paler than Harry’s ever seen him. Harry feels something akin to worry and rage. It’s a feeling he’s all too familiar with, has lived with it most of his life. Knowing that something is wrong with Draco is more than enough to keep him going. Getting separated from the Rig means that he spends a great deal fighting his way to climb back aboard. Easier said than done though when everyone wants you dead.
It takes no hesitation this time. “Yes.”
“Keep your hat on, it’ll keep you warm,” he tells Teddy and smiles when he huffs. He avoids looking at Potter and walks back into the kitchen. His ears are burning and his hands shake even after the front door closes.
“You know me, Gin. No such thing as too many parties before a wedding.”
The nightmares don’t go away. He’s accepted that he’s going to live with them for the rest of his life but he doesn’t let them dominate him. They are only reminders of his past and nothing more. He tries to focus instead on the lives he’s helped save with Draco compared to the ones he couldn’t save before he met him. Pansy was right: taking back the Citadel had been easy enough. Harry watched from a distance as everyone at the Citadel regarded Imperator Draco with a special kind of respect that even he knew Immortan Lucius had never received.
Potter smiles, “Like I’m missing something else, still.”
Then Lucius speeds up and swerves in front of them and slams on the breaks. The Rig shakes at the impact and he can hear the engine start sputter.
“That’s fine, I'll put him in the study,” Draco finds himself saying though he doesn’t know if his aunt has heard him.
* * *
Harry gasps, body shaking with adrenaline as he leans up. When he opens his eyes, Hermione is there. “Come on!” she says and offers her hand and he takes it.
She gives Draco a smirk and he narrows his eyes, daring him to say something now. Instead, she leans in for a kiss on the cheek and a hug and Draco opens his arms.
“Don’t know why you're so obsessed with my scars, considering how ugly they are,” Draco mutters quietly but Harry can see the blush on his cheeks.
Suddenly, he sees Pansy reaching for the chain. The blood bag reels back and she falters seeing the ferocity in his eyes. Draco stands and grabs the chain and wraps it around the blood bag’s neck, pulling until he hears him choke.
Blaise ushers them inside and past the entryway, Draco finds Pansy and her loving embrace. It’s only been a month since she last visited him. With her, it’s always as if no time has passed between them.
It’s like taking a breath. He clears his mind and calms his breathing. He’s in his element here, doing this. Potter stands perfectly still. When he has what he wants in his sights, Draco pulls the trigger. Through the scope he sees that he’s pierced the werewolf and it lets out a horrible yowl before it drops, body spasming. He lifts the rifle, cradles it close and smiles slightly when Potter shakes his head.
Draco appreciates Luna in such a special way because of how often she checks in on his mother. He would never be able to truly thank Luna for her efforts. His mother gave him her blessing to leave, but not without a look of sadness at her only son leaving. And that stayed with Draco. Some nights it got too hard to bear, knowing that his mother tended to an empty home. It brought him a sense of peace knowing that his aunt Andromeda and Teddy spent some of their days at the Manor with his mother and eventually some of his friends too. Every so often when he visited, she threw a dinner party or two. The first dinner party was when he came back after he graduated from his studies in Italy. With his friends and family present, being back to the Manor wasn’t so hard.
“No!” he shouts, watching as Pansy is lifted in the air, in the tight clutches of a polecat. Pomona tries to pull her back but it’s no use. She’s gone. They drop Pansy on the Gigahorse and she’s immediately pushed against the backseat window and she screams, looking at Draco. Lucius turns and also looks at Draco as he lifts his hand, one finger pointed up.
Potter smiles and holds his hands up in surrender. He doesn’t look in the slightest sorry at all. “Sorry.”
Harry comes and he groans, mind going blank as he spills inside Draco, both of them gasping for breath. He kisses Draco as he strokes himself through his own orgasm, come spilling onto his knuckles and Harry’s stomach.
* * *
“Where is she?” Draco asks, the words tremble out of his mouth like acid. “Where is Narcissa?”
He pulls out a simple postcard he bought over the summer with a rendition of
“Go,” Harry tells him and starts pulling away despite how much he hates it. “They need you. I’ll be here.”
Because the truth was: Draco was unequivocally and undeniably married to his work. He had gone on some dates but they went nowhere and he found himself surprised by how much he didn’t mind. He is for the most part perfectly okay with things. He’s got a job that he’s worked hard to get and he’s made a home for himself. Even if he hasn’t found anyone to share it with.
Potter looks at him and nods, lifting his hand again. Draco works in silence, tying one half of the scarf around his hand, tight and delicate. He knows Potter is watching him, can feel his gaze but he continues his work without saying anything. Countless times he’s done the same, tending to injuries of his own, quietly and with deft fingers. Only after Draco’s done does he let himself meet Potter’s eyes. He lets his hand fall. There’s dirt and smudges of oil on Potter’s cheek and he wants to reach up and brush it away but he doesn’t. And just like that Potter is stepping away from Draco with a quiet thanks. Draco clutches the other half of the scarf.
“Harry,” he whimpers, his fingers going from gentle to tugging hard. He slides down Draco’s cock until he can feel Draco’s pubic hair softly nestling against his nose. He breathes harshly when Draco rolls his hips, body jerking when Harry relaxes his jaw.
Potter walks up the stairs so that he’s standing next to Draco and being this close, he realizes that he’s nowhere near ready to see Potter again. Draco’s heart thrums in his ribcage, but luckily that’s the exact moment the front door opens.
“Five years ago, yes.”
“You work too much,” she points out, reaching for the forgotten bean sprouts on his plate.
He’s setting down his cup of tea and thinks about what to do next when he hears the wards of the house go off. Mother will also be arriving shortly. It’s four days until Christmas Eve. He leaves the drawing room and walks down the hall to the entryway.
Potter crawls so that he's out of sight and fits through the hatch. He moves down so that just his shoulders and head are visible as Draco slows the Rig down. “This is the sequence to turn on the Rig,” Draco says. Potter is still looking at him, watching. “You might have to drive if this goes sideways,” he says, and taps his fingers against toggle switches under the dashboard.
“We are not marred by the Wasteland. Magic comes easily to us as a result,” Ginny explains. “That’s why Lucius has been trying to breed us to pass on the magic to the babies. So far it’s only resulted in miscarriages.” There is a sadness in her eyes that Draco hates to see.
This time Draco experiments a little. He shakes the mixer and then strains the drink over their glasses.
“It’s okay,” he says, “I can’t sleep tonight.”
“You’ve got more friends,” Potter says, looking at the side mirror. Draco stands up and looks out into the distance, following his line of sight: Lucius.
Hesitant, Draco eyes the texture of it closely and brings it to his nose and smells. He knows they’ve never seen anything like it before. Harry rolls his eyes and takes Draco’s hand with his own and brings it to his mouth. At the first bite, Draco’s fingers are wet and cold droplets slide down the palm of his hand which Harry licks.
“I did no such thing. I danced with everyone,” he says, feeling his face go hot.
“I love Florence with all my heart. I couldn’t possibly ask you to leave England either! Your family is there. Teddy is there.” Draco knows he’s babbling again because that’s what he always does but Potter is there, the calm to his fierce storm.
“Here,” Draco finds himself saying as he jumps off the Rig and walks over to them. He pulls on the thin scarf tied around his neck. He runs his hand over the fabric and pulls at it until he hears it tear, splitting it in half. “May I?” he asks, waiting, motioning towards Potter’s hand.
Suddenly Ace is there and there’s no hiding this time what he’s done.
With a proper haircut this time, Harry lets Draco trace his fingertips over the scar on his forehead. He finds that he doesn’t hate it when Draco touches him. Finds out instead that he craves his touch all of a sudden, as if he’s afraid something will happen and he won’t ever feel Draco again. He doesn’t know how to explain it, gets anxious when he talks about it and is thankful when Draco understands. Hatred and fear had carved a hole inside Harry’s chest. Something else starts to fill the space and it overflows. Something a lot like love.
“There’s others from Pomona’s seeds. They’re still growing and not ready to harvest yet.”
Potter doesn’t say anything though Draco does notice that Potter has his finger off the trigger.
“To want someone this much,” he says, taking that leap.
At that the blood bag fights back again, pulling hard against the chains and Draco gives them a wide berth. He goes as far as dislocating the arm of one of the war boys trying to hold him down. He nearly succeeds in breaking free until Gertie takes out the scissors and pulls the blood bag’s head back and yells into his ear, telling him to keep still.
“He’s safe,” Draco says, nodding. “He helped us get here.”
He helps Draco with the cooking and Draco doesn’t hate it. Normally he is content to be left alone in the kitchen. He loves hosting. Serving and such brings him bliss and comfort. Instead, he finds himself putting the kettle on first thing in the morning for two, expecting Potter to walk into the kitchen minutes later.
No one says anything but then, the same back door creaks loudly and Ginny is there. She looks at them with a satisfied smile on her face as she takes Luna’s hand and climbs back inside.
“Green,” Potter says.
“Deep down I think I knew that she was gone,” he finds himself saying a few minutes later. The sun has started to set. “There was no way she was going to recover from the injuries she sustained that day. But I held out hope, the same way I was so sure I would see home again. She fought so hard to keep me here, far away from his clutches.”
Harry’s hand comes up to his neck, resting at the collar of his shirt before a thumb softly rubs against his skin. Draco opens his mouth and fuck, Harry’s tongue always knew how to make Draco come undone. He feels a shiver go down his spine along with arousal starting to pool around his groin. He moves his hands to Harry’s waist. Harry gives him an experimental roll of his hips that has Draco breathing hard against the kiss. He’s pushed against the counter.
“Would you have gone home with me the night of the wedding? If I had asked,” Harry asks, pulling back, breathing hard.
“I’m sorry,” Draco begins, “I wanted to come back. I tried so hard.”
Harry reaches for him then, hands pulling him up for a long and hard kiss that’s all teeth and tongue. He bites at Harry’s lower lip and slides his tongue into the heat of Harry’s mouth, groaning when Harry sucks on it.
“We’re back to ‘Potter’ now are we?” Harry laughs, bright and eyes soft and warm. His curls stick to his forehead, wet with sweat and Draco brings up a hand to push them away.
They make their Green Place here at the Citadel. This wasteland, broken and damaged and war-torn as it is, is all they have. It's a slow process trying to undo and pick apart the years and years of patriarchal and tyrannical rule Immortan Lucius kept the Citadel under. Fear is hard to break when that’s all everyone has ever known. They work towards destroying the oppressive power structures holding everyone back.
“Get back inside and whatever it is you do, don’t make a sound,” he tells them. When Luna starts descending down the open hatch on the floor he looks at Potter, amused at the way he raises a quizzical eyebrow. “I need you here.”
Hermione clears her throat, looking confused. “If you came from the West, you passed it.”
Their skin is ruined and sags, their bones sharp and visible from the frame of their faces. Even while crouching they stand tall at nine feet. Wild patches of fur adorn their bodies, their claws sharp and strong enough to tear into metal. Eyes black as night and fangs sharp as knives, snarling, with saliva dripping from their mouth in large globs.
He finally fixes what’s broken.
“Fuck,” Draco whispers, unable to stop the slow roll of his hips, seeking sweet friction against Harry’s hand. His eyes flutter closed and he bites his lip. He helps Draco undress, pulling his pants down his hips until his cock springs free.
“I can go with him,” Potter says and then lowers his voice, “There’s just something about being in the drawing room alone with Andromeda and your mother. I much would rather face a boggart. Please don’t tell them I said that.”
The first time Harry took a bite of his own, he didn’t know how to explain what he was tasting. It’s sweet, so sweet, and the juice fills his mouth and it’s not unpleasant. It’s completely new but he doesn’t hate it. He thinks it might be the best thing he’s ever tasted in his life.
“A lifelong reminder of what would happen if I tried to leave again,” Draco tells Potter, pointing towards the leg brace. It helps him stand, keeps him from suddenly falling over should it give out. He made it himself from scraps of metal. “Happened as soon as I came back to the Citadel after running away with my mother.”
Get up.
Their hands touch when Potter reaches for the glass, his fingers warm against Draco’s, but it’s gone within a second. He waits for a verdict, watching Potter take a sip.
Draco pulls his fingers nearly all the way out and then presses in again. He runs the pad of thumb around Harry's rim before pushing back in, teasing. He stretches Harry deeper this time, filling him up until his knuckles rest against Harry's arse.
“And how do we take back the Citadel?” Draco asks, mind racing. “Assuming we’re still alive by then.”
Silence stretches until it’s thick and Draco rolls his eyes. He looks down and notices the name patch on the breast pocket of the uniform jacket the blood bag is wearing. The name is faded but still legible and Draco eyes it curiously.
Further hours in, when he’s the only one awake, the Rig starts to swerve sideways. Draco looks out and notices the patches of water throughout the ground. A bog. He eases off the pedal and maneuvers to avoid driving into a mud pile but it’s too late. The Rig comes to a complete stop, tires turning and engine revving. He looks at Potter and he’s already awake, looking out ahead.
“You love it,” Harry says, a sly smile tugging at his lips.
“Look, he’s got glasses!” One of the war boys yells and then they’re screaming and tearing at each other for them.
At the silence that follows she looks up from her book at Draco and immediately he feels pinned. “There won’t be a problem, right?”
“What happened?” Pansy asks.
“Not nearly enough,” Potter answers. He looks at Draco and he sees regret there, deep and so profound.
Potter looks at him and nods. “Thanks.”
“I’ve talked with the others,” he starts and swallows. “We’re never going to have a better chance at making it across the salt. We leave the Rig and load up the motorcycles with as much as we can and drive. We can be free. One of those bikes is yours. You’re more than welcome to come with us.”
“How are you feeling?” Draco then asks, noticing the dark bags under her eyes. Her hands are covered in dried dirt and oil.
They’ve finished setting the plates back on the hood when they hear it: a howl that cuts through the night, foul and sharp. Draco’s body goes cold and his hands freeze.
They climb into the Rig and drive away.
“How many days has it been?” Minerva asks and she looks so much older. Her soothing voice reminds him of the stories she would tell him of satellites and dancing lights in the sky at night.
She offers more firewhiskey but the bottle is empty and they go off in a fit of giggles and laughs. It reminds him of eighth year and the nights when they had too much to drink after a long day of studying at the library.
Harry kisses him again and Draco doesn’t hold back the moan, as Harry’s tongue touches his, hot and keen. He briefly remembers that they’re in the middle of his kitchen and that Harry practically has him against the counter. Anyone could walk in at any minute. He rests his hands against Harry’s chest, softly pushing him away, laughing when he groans and gently bites Draco’s bottom lip.
When Potter doesn’t respond Draco clears his throat. "Sometimes hope is all that you can have in this godforsaken world. Without it you might as well be a half-life, waiting to die."
Aunt Andromeda looks at them, eyes warm. He is grateful for the reconciliation between his mother and aunt after the war. There was too much sadness and pain to endure alone and when they found each other, they found ways to heal together. His aunt lived life with a fierceness that Draco admired. She lost a daughter and son-in-law but did not give up on her last surviving sister. Though mother held regret and sorrow deep in her heart, she rarely talked about it. His aunt and Teddy both breathed new life into his mother. Spending Christmas with his newly reunited family in Florence has become a tradition that Draco cherishes.
“I couldn’t live at the Manor after the war. Too many bad memories. What happened sullied everything.”
“No, we just got here. Coincidentally enough,” Draco says.
“Can you come on my cock?” Draco asks, trailing small kisses around the shell of Harry’s ear.
No time like the present, then.
“There’s something out there,” Luna says, so sure.
“Christ, Potter, what would have happened if I
“That’s my name.”
“Do you want to decorate the tree today?” he asks Teddy over breakfast the following morning. They sit in the kitchen, alone, both having the habit of being early risers. It doesn't last because Potter follows shortly after and Draco already has a cup of tea out and waiting.
He doesn’t have to be at Blaise’s until the early evening, which means he still has the entire morning to himself.
Then, Draco reaches into his pockets, takes out the glasses and holds them out. He looks at Draco questioningly before taking the glasses, fingers running over the wired frames. “Where did you find these?”
“Sure he can,” Draco says, meeting Potter’s eyes.
“Guilty as charged,” Potter says in the end, shrugging with a crooked smile. “In the meantime, I've been fixing up Grimmauld Place which is almost finished. I finished work on the top floor this Spring. I’m figuring out what to do next. I'm thinking the gardens?”
Draco watches how beautifully Harry takes his cock, the way the muscles on his thighs flex with every move, the way his stomach tenses under Draco’s touch. He brings a hand to rest under Harry’s rib cage, fingers moving over his tattoo. It’s an owl feather with beautiful intricate detailing and hints of white and black spots.
“Can Harry help too?” Teddy asks.
He pushes the carcass off his body and a surge of pain cuts clean through his leg when he stands. He almost falls, unable to stand up straight because of how much it hurts. Potter needs him. He practically drags his leg and picks up the shotgun. He aims and shoots. The werewolf falls over, dead. There’s a crazed look in Potter’s eyes. Draco reaches his hand out to Potter, and for a moment he’s sure that Potter doesn’t recognize him but it’s gone, quickly as it came, as he takes Draco’s hand.
He walks into the kitchen and puts on a kettle for tea. He passes by the fridge and notices the other various postcards he keeps pinned to the door. Most of them are from Potter. It's become their own little thing. In his study, he finds what he's looking for. In a drawer, he keeps a stack of postcards he’s collected from gift shops and train stops all over Europe.
Blaise is getting married on Saturday and Draco is his best man. Though they live in separate countries now, the two are still close and Draco loves him dearly. He remembers that he was mildly surprised when Blaise first told him, three years ago, that he had started seeing Ginerva Weasley.
He feels himself stir awake in the middle of the night when Draco gets up. Draco pulls his hand from Harry’s and Harry lets him go, his own body shifting on their bed.
Once they’ve moved the Rig forward there is a small burst of fire in the distance. The crows circling them fly away, screeching into the night. Draco looks out the window. He waits a minute or two but it feels like hours. He welcomes the rush of relief when he sees Potter again. The relief turns into something else and it makes him want to hold it close to his chest.
He’s seen that look before. Knows what it feels like to recoil at someone reaching towards you when you can barely hold back your own demons. Too many times Draco felt that way, nearly getting into a fist fight when someone dared to touch him.
“Honestly? Just about the same,” Blaise admits. “In two days I get to marry my fiancée and have all my friends in attendance. I’m more surprised that I’m taking this better than Ginny. The dress came in. She and Harry came back from the tailor yesterday morning. I couldn’t possibly spoil anything by being home so I joined Pansy out for brunch.”
“What did you mean by Grimmauld Place not feeling complete,” he asks out of nowhere.
He leans into her arms and hugs her tight. Behind her he sees the Wives, followed by Fleur Delacour, Poppy Pomfrey, and Pomona Sprout.
“Is this not a supply run?” Ace asks Draco a few moments later, yelling over the roar of the engine.
At times it feels hopeless when Draco looks at the rear mirror and sees the war parties trailing behind them. They wasted no time catching up to Draco and his War Rig. Death Eaters and polecats. They swing on poles fixed to the vehicles. He’s always hated them. This time though, Draco has his family. Hermione covers the rear of the Rig with Poppy. And one look at Potter, at his right, is enough to settle his nerves. They can do this.
“You danced with Harry almost all night,” Pansy then says, voice calm as if she's talking about the weather. She's looking up from the brim of her champagne glass.
“And the Wives? What are they looking for?” Potter comes to stand next to Draco.
“Among other things but yes,” Blaise grins.
He lifts Draco again and looks at him; his full lips, pointed nose and closed eyelids full of grease and oil. Beautiful. Worth protecting. His hands have snapped necks and have taken so many lives, but he holds Draco ever so softly, like he is life itself.
“Easy, Granger. Or have you forgotten someone from your own clan?” another voice says, calm and collected and when Draco turns around, he sees Blaise Zabini. There’s someone else behind them and when Blaise steps aside, Draco gasps. In Minerva McGonagall’s face, Draco sees home and comfort. In her gentle smile, he sees warmth and life.
Draco tries to ignore the need to tuck back the curl that’s moved out of place. It’s such a stupid thing to notice and he finds it dangerous to be even thinking about it. There are more important things to consider like the fact that Potter said he’s no longer with the Aurors. No one had mentioned that to him.
At that Draco leans up and looks over to the sun, watches it slowly fall down the horizon as the sky starts to dim. He then looks at Potter. "Is that what happened to you?"
Draco shakes his head, looking up at the ceiling past the giant skylights. He can’t see anything but his reflection. “I bet it’s gorgeous in the mornings.”
“What’s so funny, Potter?”
There are no more words that need to be said. He will not be cruel to himself. In this moment, though, Draco is so sure; feels it in his bones: this is what desire feels like.
Draco is proud of himself for maintaining a cool composure at having Potter inside his home again. He pointedly tries to avoid thinking of what happened the last time he was here. He avoids looking at his bedroom when they walk past it, knowing that his heart will betray him if he does.
The wedding is as beautiful as Draco could have imagined it. He keeps the wedding bands close to his heart until it’s time for the bride and groom to exchange their vows. Ginny looks incredible, wearing a gown that compliments her so well, with a beautiful opening at the back. Her auburn hair was braided and styled into an elegant updo.
“Luna’s looking for you, Pansy,” Potter says.
“One last one for the nerves,” he says before putting it out.
“They flipped over when we hit the rocks. I think they were afraid that I might have fallen and gone under the wheels.”
He moves for the gun holstered in the underbelly of the tank. Pain starts to sparks in his left leg and it makes him falter but he pushes through it to keep going. He trips and falls, his foot having been caught in the chains. A heavy weight pins him to the ground again and Draco feels it, the fury coarse through him and he welcomes it. He hasn’t felt this alive in years. The gun falls to the sand, unforgotten. He looks up at the blood bag and for a split second it’s like he’s seeing Draco for the first time. Their faces are inches apart and Draco stops breathing. He licks his lips, can taste blood and dirt. Green eyes trace down his face to his mouth.
“This is a nice change,” Potter says later when they’re nearly done. “At the Burrow, it’s all done with magic. Growing up I rarely had a chance to decorate the Christmas tree, you see,” he explains when Draco gives him a confused look. “The Dursleys made sure of it.”
Just then Potter drops the file on the dashboard and pulls back the muzzle, finally broken. He tosses it out the window and Draco looks at him.
“Something in the eyes,” Pomona observes, looking at him and Draco’s vision blurs with tears. “Perhaps it is Narcissa’s child.”
“And what does Draco want?” Harry asks, grinning still and Draco loves him so much.
“What do you see?” he asks, following her line of sight.
“There’s a ridiculous amount of clear water. Lucius pumps it from deep within the earth and claims it all for himself. He calls it Aqua Cola. And because he owns the water, he owns all of us,” Ginny says.
When Draco finally sinks down on his cock, Harry feels like he’s going to die. He’s tight and hot around Harry and it feels so right, so good.
“They come with us,” Draco says as he climbs inside. Potter nods. Draco looks out the window. In the far distance, he can see the war parties on the horizon. He looks down at the Wives. “Let’s go.”
It could be hours, Harry has no idea, really, but then Draco grinds down on his cock and he feels like he’s going to burst. "Now, Harry."
“Darling, won’t you stay long after?” Pansy asks later at dinner.
“The man,” Hermione then asks, looking at Potter, “Who is he?”
* * *
He walks up to the door and knocks, his hand trembling a little. He can hear loud noises coming from the other side of the door, laughs and conversation, and the low hum of music.
“Harry, darling,” Draco says and sighs when Harry does that thing again with his tongue, drawing out a half-laugh-half-moan from him. He should really get them out of the kitchen.
Having her here now is all that he’s wanted. He remembers the day Sirius died like it was yesterday, even though he wants to forget. He vividly remembers the way she had screamed and smiled at Harry as she left him in the dust, laying in a pool of his own blood. He tried to crawl to Sirius' lifeless body but he couldn't move. He had never felt so weak, so pathetic and all he could do was cry and yell until his throat was hoarse. He was sure that he was going to die. That’s where Hagrid found him, passed out, sun burnt and feverish. He should have been dead. Hagrid told Harry as much when he finally woke up.
“Need you to go slow,” Draco says, voice rough with arousal. “I’m close.”
There’s a storm on the horizon and Draco aims right for it.
At that Draco falters just a little because, Merlin. Desire blooms in his heart, heavy and sure.
The blood bag points towards the water hose with the gun.
Draco moves so that the barrel of the gun is flush against his forehead. He eyes the blood bag, knows that he’s their only option of getting out of here alive. The eyes that stare back at him are hard and so green. It’s mesmerizing.
“Yeah yeah, tell them I sent ye,” Gertie says. He hands the scissors off and he brings around the tattoo machine. When it turns on Draco suppresses a shiver at hearing the familiar sound again. Draco hates this part. He resists the urge to run his fingers over the brand at the back of his neck.
“Thanks,” Potter says, taking a mug and pouring himself some tea. Draco moves about, casting some charms to wash some dishes. Soft singing comes from the radio in the corner.
Draco looks at Potter, noticing the way he’s grimacing at his bloody hand though he says nothing about it. After some time, once they’re sure they’re not being followed, they have no choice but to stop to let the engines cool off. The sun is starting to set and a cool breeze sets in, giving them some respite after a long day.
“Once again, we send off my War Rig to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town, and bullets from the Bullet Farm. Once again, I salute my Imperator Draco!” Lucius’ voice booms. He can feel Lucius’ eyes on him, and he feels sick. “And I salute my half-life war boys who will ride eternal with me on the highways of Valhalla.”
“We can’t breathe down there!” eventually comes a voice. Draco looks back down at the open hatch on the floor and sees Ginny come through. She coughs and looks around the darkened sky.
“I’m expected back after the weekend. Lots to do still,” Draco tells Pansy.
“Possible for— mmh—what?”
He laughs because of how ridiculous it all sounds, but it’s worth it just to see a smile pull on Potter’s lips. He looks divine. It does something to Draco, and he thinks how lovely it would be to see that smile again.
Potter looks over the plains and stays silent. Draco has never felt him more distant than right now. He wants to reach out, wants to take Potter’s hand, wants to bring him back. Draco wants him to come with them.
When the Canyons are on the horizon, Draco throws a sideways glance at Potter and notices that he’s relaxed a little, but still furiously works the file against the back of his muzzle. Every now and then Potter narrows his eyes at Pansy, who throws glares at him.
“F—fuck,” Harry breathes out, body tensing, throwing his head back. The hand in Draco’s hair gives him a little hard tug. “Gonna make me come like this.”
“What’s at the Citadel?” Poppy asks.
“I’ll be fine,” he says. Ginny shrugs and walks away.
Draco closes his eyes and hates himself for how his heart skips a beat at that. Leave it to Pansy to always know where to strike hard and fast.
“He’s your father,” Potter then says after a beat. It’s not a question.
“Narcissa, please,” she simply says and walks away, clearly leaving no room for argument.
He realizes then that he’s always been running away from what’s been in front of him all this time. So afraid of rejection, Draco realizes that going back to Florence was his way of coping. It was here where everything started, it was here where everything had become a possibility followed by reality instead of a fantasy. And Draco held onto that, so deep in his heart.
“I’ll be right back,” he says, grabs his wand, and disappears through the door.
Draco thinks of his team, of the home that he’s created, and put every ounce of his being into loving. He also thinks of the void that he feels every single time he returns from England. The feeling of coming back to an empty house and an empty bed. He thinks of the fact that ever since then, Draco hasn’t taken anyone else to his bed.
* * *
Suddenly, Draco has an idea. He gets off the bed and walks around looking for his discarded shirt and trousers and puts them on.
Draco finds his mother in the library later that night after dinner. She sits on the couch, legs tucked underneath and covered in a throw blanket. She has a fire going in a wood-burning stove and has a book in her hands.
He adds another sugar cube to his tea. He’s just finished reading a special in the paper about the Biennale opening. It was a complete success, but not without some last-minute panics. He’s been splitting his time between Grimmauld Place and his home in Florence which he knows looking back on it now was probably a contributing factor as to why he’s so tired. Still, Draco wouldn’t change a thing.
* * *
Harry snaps his hips up and moans loudly, a cry practically prying out of his throat. “Fuck, D—Draco!”
Draco realizes that he and Potter are alone in the kitchen. It should be like any other time where they found themselves in each other's company. It should be easier to be with Potter and it is, but every single time it’s also like the first time. What kills him the most is that Potter doesn’t ask any more from Draco than he’s willing to give. It’s not awkward and he’s not sure if he should be disappointed or not.
Draco notices there's a lightness to Potter. He doesn’t look so tired. The bags under his eyes are barely visible. And Draco finds that he’s genuinely glad for that fact.
Then Harry rolls his hips trying to get more of Draco and smirks when Draco’s breath hitches. He moves his hands to Harry’s hips, holding him still.
He only has a few more seconds before the werewolf is out of reach. Draco walks up next to Potter, who looks at Draco from the corner of his eye. Potter says nothing, just holds up the rifle for Draco. He takes it, settles the barrel over Potter’s shoulder and turns the scope.
Dinner is amazing and they all eat to their heart's content. There is plenty to eat from and when the spread is all laid out on the dining table, Draco lets out a sigh of relief. The desserts are an assortment of small cakes and treats from a local bakery. The table’s favorite turns out to be the chocolate and pistachio-covered biscotti. He grins into his wine glass as he watches Potter and Teddy fight over the last one. In the end, Potter begrudgingly offers it to Teddy saying it’s only out of the kindness of his heart.
“He’s bleeding out,” she says, looking miserable. “His lungs are collapsing one breath at a time.”
Having a moment to himself, he lingers on the thought that he is an outsider and won’t belong no matter what. He makes an effort to visit every so often but with curating the exhibition that opens next summer, he’s not been able to have as much free time this year. The fact that they are willing to visit him, though, is not lost on him. Pansy visits whenever she can and Blaise and Ginny always like visiting him in the summer.
Just then, Baz rounds the corner with the rest of his cronies and Draco lets go. They grab the blood bag and the last thing Draco sees is the look he gives Draco—something akin to amusement. He doesn’t realize until much later that his knife is missing from its sheath.
“God, you just can’t tell me these things,” Draco sighs.
“You’d be relying on the gratitude of a very bad man,” Draco continues. “You’ve already damaged one of his Wives. He won’t be so forgiving.”
There’s a glint in Potter’s eyes.
“Potter,” Draco says, awestruck, “It’s good to see you.”
Draco looks back at the others and what he sees he can only describe as hope. It’s more than enough to convince him. Draco turns back to Potter and looks down at his outstretched hand. He takes it and clasps it without hesitation.
,” Draco says, his moans coming out in breathy jolts. “I’m—not going to last.”
They haven’t been detected yet. Draco forces himself to move but it’s as if he’s stuck, his feet fixed to the mud, wet and cold. An unbearable sense of dread washes over him. They are helpless like this. They stand perfectly still as the werewolves walk up closer, until one is right in front of Draco, and he stares into their eyes.
“Did you know that Potter was going to be joining us this year for Christmas?” he asks because it’s been on the back of his mind.
Draco smirks and then leans and kisses the head of Harry’s cock and then wraps his lips around the head. He hums when he feels the hand in his hair pull.
“What’s he saying?” Minerva asks, pulling down her scarf.
He doesn’t have too many fond memories of his last year at Hogwarts. Pansy and Blaise and Hermione had made it a little worthwhile, though. They bonded over the nightmares they still had. He apologized to Hermione for all his wrongdoings, for what had happened in the Manor and she forgave him. She reminded him, though, that it was his aunt who tortured her, not him. It wasn't unusual for him to wake in the middle of the night, covered in sweat, face twisted in pain, the smell of fire and ash too strong.
To his left he sees a pursuit vehicle ride up next to him and tries to drive him off course but the Rig sustains the push. He reaches for the shotgun he keeps to his right. In that moment he also notices that there is someone chained to the lancer’s perch at the front.
“I was wondering,” Potter starts, looking especially nervous. “I know you’re not in town for much longer but perhaps you want to go out tomorrow for lunch?”
There’s a silence that follows and stretches so deep that for a moment, Draco thinks he might not have said anything at all.
“Now, who would I be if I didn’t bring some kind of reminder of our misdoings from the before times?” Draco says. “I have a whole crate coming in from Tuscany later this week. Part of your wedding gift if you will.”
He’s left alone on the balcony with Potter. And he should feel nervous but there’s also a part of him that feels very selfish and very full of hope. He comes to stand next to Draco and lets out a sigh. Draco notices that the top collar of his shirt has come undone and his skin glistens with sweat. He’s staring again and Potter knows it because he’s watching Draco, too.
“Don’t suppose you can spare me the lancers like we agreed?” Draco asks then. He wrinkles his nose as he watches the lumps of thick curly hair fall to the ground.
They end up talking about a lot of things, some things that he will remember the morning after and others that he won’t. It’s so late that sleep comes to them so easily after they settle back in bed. Draco presses himself against Harry, with his chest to Harry’s back. He presses a soft kiss to Harry’s hair as he moves so that he’s flush against Draco. Harry finds Draco's hand and links their fingers, his thumb rubs against Draco’s knuckles with soft strokes. He waits until Harry’s breathing evens out when he’s sure that he’s fast asleep.
A second later Draco sees blood and the werewolf falls at Pansy’s feet, a gaping hole in their head. Potter is there, shotgun in one hand and in the other is a pistol he throws to Draco. Padma runs into Pansy’s arms and they clutch each other, shaking.
“Like saying yes to marrying you?” Draco offers.
. In such an enclosed space, they move around each other like a well oiled machine. He opens the sunroof and stands and the rifle is there again, waiting and he takes it from Potter. One by one he takes down the Riders as fast as he can. He sees one to his right, ready to throw a smoke bomb inside the Rig when Potter gets to him first.
“And you? The Biennale is next year, no?” Potter asks after a while and it takes Draco off guard. It’s not a secret but...
After the war, Draco couldn’t stomach living at the Manor, despite his mother’s insistence. He could no longer bear the ghosts and pain that lingered within the halls. The great dining hall and cellar were the worst, and he couldn’t walk into them without having a fit of sorts, feeling his chest tightening. It had endured so much death and suffering that no amount of remodeling was going to change that. Things weren’t the same and the Manor no longer felt like home to Draco. And his mother couldn’t blame him, after everything they’ve been through. His father is still in Azkaban and his mother tends to the Manor hopeful that one day her family will return home.
He knows that Potter is joking, but the smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes and Draco feels an ache in his heart. If anything, he is glad that Potter has found some comfort within these halls. They walk past visitors and tour groups of students and seniors.
Draco slicks his cock, pants when he moves his thumb over the head. He moves so that his cockhead is just barely grazing against Harry’s rim. The first press inside overwhelms him.
For dinner, Potter takes him to a nearby restaurant for hot pot. It's some of the best Draco's had in a very long time. They eat in comfortable silence. Only then does Draco realize that on their walk to the restaurant, he held Potter's hand the entire time.
They can’t stop. Whatever happens they have to keep going. He falls back inside, the realization sending something cold and dreadful down his back. It curls into his stomach and makes him sick.
“I’m not just anyone, Potter,” Draco says and he smiles when Potter rolls his eyes.
Draco doesn’t move when Potter crowds into his space, doesn’t pull away when Potter reaches for his hand. They’re tethering on dangerous territory now and all Draco can think about is how hard his heart is beating, and the earnest look Potter is giving him.
The citrus mixed in with the gin is so rich and fresh and he cannot hold back the pleased sigh. He has the decency to look at least a bit embarrassed when he realizes that Potter is still watching him. He brings out the glasses, handing them to the others and he walks back, smiling at seeing Potter already washing some of the dishes.
Hours later, after the reception dies down, in the early hours of the next day, Draco finds an empty balcony and goes outside for a breather. He’s sweating and tipsy from all the drinking and dancing. He tugs at his collar, not caring that he’s popped off a button. He leans against the stone railing, tilting his head back, and enjoys the light breeze.
Draco meets Potter’s eyes through the windshield and they stare at each other for a few seconds before Potter’s gaze turns upwards. Above through the open roof, Draco sees a war boy standing over them. The pressure around his throat comes out of nowhere and he reaches for his throat, fingers pulling frantically at the cable around his neck. He gasps for air just as Potter moves out of sight. Soon the cable around his neck loosens and Draco pulls it over his head, watching as the metal snare pole drops at his side. He looks up again through the roof and sees a war boy restrain Potter as another throws a punch to his jaw. Desperate to help, Draco slams on the brakes and the momentum knocks them all onto the hood of the Rig. One falls overboard and at the last second they try to pull Potter off with them.
Draco’s the first one to look away, feeling raw and strung out. The sky has now turned into a warm tint of blue and purple.
“How are you doing?” Draco asks, quiet, knowing that this could very well be a sore subject for Potter.
