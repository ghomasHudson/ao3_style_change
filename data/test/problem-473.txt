Malfoy’s eyes flickered open, shocked. “Malfoy,” said Harry, keeping his face open. “You have to relax.”
“Oh, no, that’s grand,” said Harry. “Hayden really looks like they could do with a dolphin tea cosy.”
“Quel est le problème?” Draco says, turning to the cashier, and she explains to him that it’s 2 for 3 on the ham, and that there’s a discount on the cereal. Once they’re outside, Draco finds Harry staring at him.
After, they sat there panting, very close together. Harry’s come was drying between them, and it had stopped raining. Draco seemed unable to move. His forehead was back on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry could hear him breathing.
“Just like this.” He was well into a rhythm now. “I’ll take you just like this. I’ll have you right here, in my kitchen, against the table. I’ll take care of you, Draco.”
Malfoy was inches away, and Harry’s eyes were free to roam. It hadn’t been that bad. The planes of his face were dynamic this close up, and you could see that he wasn’t really that pale at all. Pale was the wrong word. He was a combination of blue veins and red blood, ruddy flesh and carved bone, all sealed away in a skin so light it was translucent, a formality settled over his vitality like a table cloth.
“Well,” Hermione says slowly, looking a little guilty. “You did kind of keep that poster of Rihanna on your wall for a while.”
“I don’t know if this is gonna fall over.” Oceania took a step back and looked up at the pole. “I think it might.”
Harry felt his heart in his throat, behind his voice box, under his chin. He felt it in every bone behind his face.
Harry tried to smile and reached for the table again. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. He exhaled slowly.
“Legs?” Malfoy was staring at Harry with wide eyes in something akin to wonder. “You’re telling me you’re straight because of girls’ legs?”
“Harry,” said Malfoy, and his voice was quite firm. A hand had appeared on Harry’s ankle, holding him just under the hem of his jean leg. “
“Even you are not fit enough to say such things,” said Draco, picking up a copy of “The Hungry Caterpillar” and waggling it dangerously in Harry’s direction. “Even you, Golden Boy.”
“Fuck it's hot,” says Harry, his hand luggage rolling noisily behind him as they make their way up the connecting ramp. Draco glances over and resists the urge to roll his eyes.
There were more prints in here, mostly of pin up girls. Over the fireplace was what looked like another Gene Bilbrew, this one showing a muscular man who was being restrained and  whipped. There were a lot of glossy black sculptures on the bookshelves to match the patent leather sofas. In the middle of the room was a coffee table carved to look like a man on all fours, and on top sat a vase of black orchids.
“I know you’re a man, Draco.” Harry raised a brow at him as he began to walk out of the kitchen. His eyes were glinting. “Besides, I would’ve thought you were more progressive than that.”
“Every time,” Malfoy groaned into his hands. Matter of fact, he already looked pretty sparkled, his blush deepening into a rich scarlet and sticking. “Every time I bring someone, you do this.”
Draco straightened up, getting to his feet and brushing his hands off. For some reason he was wearing denim coveralls and nothing else. Even the unshelled white of his feet was stained green.
“Where else?” said Tom, and then nodded at Malfoy. “Come and at least sit down Draco, your anxiety is off-putting.”
He leaned across the table and cut the crust down the middle, letting the steam billow out. Malfoy didn’t stop him. His eyes were big and bright through the cloud of steam.
Harry thought about the silence he’d felt. About how the blue had expanded, and how when it had retreated, it had left behind a bridge between the two of them.
It wasn’t like it was urgent. He contented himself to wander along the side of the nearest hill, feeling the breeze smooth cold fingers down his neck and scalp. His chest opened up, a little. That was always a good thing.
.” Malfoy scowled – and there he was, the boy from Hogwarts Harry had once hated more than anything. When he thought about it nowadays, Harry mostly wondered if Malfoy had already started wearing dresses then. “I read the newspaper.”
Unbidden, the thought of white limbs and snarky jokes and the smell of roses flittered inside him. He inhaled sharply and shrugged, awkward.
Malfoy pressed his lips together. “Yes, well. How was I supposed to know of your perverted tendencies?”
They led him down the side of the hill, walking until they were under the ceiling of golden-limbed branches, the smell of ice and earth rich in their noses.
“How…?” Malfoy seemed three parts just as embarrassed as Harry, and one part delighted at Harry’s display of sheer ineptitude. “How it…
Malfoy’s finger came away and then came back again. This time it moved along the outer edges of Harry’s eye, circling along the hollows in his socket. Harry wondered what it would be like if his eyes were open right now. He imagined collarbones, and necklines.
When he looked back at Malfoy he had that slight line perched between his brows. He looked like he was desperately trying to figure something out, although Harry didn’t know what, because as far as he went, Harry was a pretty simple person.
Harry closed his eyes. “Yes,” he said simply. He felt along for the connection in his mind and found it – there – sensitive like a nerve. He followed it, leaned into it – and then Jane was right there, right here, in his mind, in his soul – they were together, at one in their most vulnerable places. Harry found where he was hurting, and found her. He used the hurt – he was using it to make himself stronger. No, not stronger. Bigger. Not bigger.
“Do you want to go die in a hole?” asked Oceania. Harry was taken aback by her vitriol. Drunk Oceania was
The road was steep and craggy, having clearly been manufactured over decades of trampling feet. Soon enough it veered off to the side and headed back down the slope, but Charlie continued walking off the path and over the hillside.
Once he’d stolen some jeans as well, he walked the few metres over to the bathroom and dry-heaved over the toilet. Then he wiped his mouth, splashed his face, and headed back to his house. He couldn’t go back to sleep. He just sat there with his books, a cup of tea, Harry Potter’s clothes and smell and ghost all over him.
“He did have a habit of being surprisingly brave when you least expected him to be,” she decided once the spoon had been removed.
The concept of meditation wasn’t really anything that Harry got worked up over, but for the sake of an uncomfortable Malfoy who still resolutely studying the feet of a goddess, he nodded and stepped forward.
“Trust you to get hung up that part,” said Malfoy, right as Benjamin said, “And just like that, the evening is sorted.”
“You see what you expect,” he said eventually. “It’s not abnormal. You see what you expect to see in me Harry, and you don’t expect decency.”
“No,” said Malfoy. The thumb kept circling, and he was looking at him very steadily. “No,” he said, “I don’t think you are.”
The next morning, Draco gets out of bed, and goes straight to the kitchen. The tap is there. The pot is there. The kettle that hasn’t worked for a year is there.
“Is that beer or cider?” she asked as Dean joined them. Harry smiled at him and found an excuse to break off.
“He’s not just a dominatrix,” Bolson Torris, assistant manager of TV “journalism” channel Vise, was spitting at him. The toothpick that inhabited the left corner of his mouth wobbled dangerously for emphasis. “He’s a drag queen dominatrix.  She. Whatever. Make sure you hone in on that.”
Then Harry apologised – and that was really the start, wasn’t it, for him? Draco didn’t know why it had surprised him so much at the time. Harry loved being challenged, after all.
There was a brief silence. Then the girl held out a hand. “I’m Oceania,” she said, “What do you like to be called?”
“Hold on, Malfoy,” he called out, and then let go of any mental leash. Draco grabbed his waist tighter and shrieked.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “So glad we got that out of the way,” she said, and nodded at Luna. “Please don’t let the interesting dynamic here stop you from ordering your olives.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I know it’s not – well, I thought you just might want to know. Since it’s partly because of you.” He realised how that sounded.  “I mean, I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything. Harry was waiting for him to say something. Instead, he took off his waterproof and set it down on the bed.
“Harry,” said Delia, “Do you have tippex on you? I’d literally rather die than go back down to the printing room.”
Malfoy swallowed. He had the kind of slim frame that made his Adam’s apple rather distinctive. He was wearing a new jumper today, a charcoal one that Harry hadn’t seen before.
Voldemort is dead, Hogwarts and the rest of the wizarding world is well on its way to recovering as best as it could, and although sometimes Harry still wakes up gasping thinking of smoke and limp bodies and green light and white faces – for the most part, life has kept moving. And it has moved into such normality that highlighting any remaining abnormalities in Harry was a mere inevitability.
They ended up in a large room. The walls were bare, and there was a large low table stretched across the centre. Seated around it, and standing around the walls, were plenty of the monks, dressed in the same orange and red outfit that Tom wore. Some of them turned to give the three of them friendly smiles. Tom himself was sitting at the table. He smiled at Harry.
It splashed, hot as blood, between their bodies. It definitely got on Draco’s very nice blouse. He moaned helplessly, as if it was happening to him and not Harry.
He imagined them kissing. It was strange, stranger than anything else he had encountered since coming to this place.
And sometimes he thought that perhaps love was just more than anything anyone had ever prepared him for.
“Well,” Says Malfoy, leaning back after a long moment and sighing, cleavage heaving ridiculously. “If you’re just going to gape at me, I’d best be going. See you around, Potter.” Slinking past Harry, she’s out the door before Harry’s fists have even fully clenched.
He supposed – he supposed some of it was that he had never really imagined anything for his future beyond Voldemort. Beyond the war. He was constantly coming back to his past in order to path his future – constantly coming back to Godric’s Hollow, to Privet Drive, to Hogwarts – even now. What if he didn’t want to go back anymore? What if he wanted to move forward?
Harry nodded. He pressed the edge of the glass to his forehead, feeling the condensation mix with his sweat.
Or maybe it’s just the ink, or just the paper, or just a conversation, or the room to grow. After all, words are just words, and letters are just letters, and at the end of the day, it just depends on what you’re trying to say.
Ron looked predictably startled, but he came. They stood and hugged it out. It was awkward. Of course it was awkward. Harry felt so suddenly grateful that he even loved the awkwardness of it. They clumsily slapped each other on the back a few times. Hermione came back with the tea, and upon witnessing them looked as though she might start crying
“Every time I think I’ve got you figured out, you just do something else. Something out-of-character. Something that doesn’t make sense. Like coming here, for example. I can’t understand why you would come. You’re not the kind of person to come.”
Malfoy was unfazed. He stepped into the room, platform heels clicking on the dark wood. “The point of drag,” he said, “is not to look enough like a woman that straight men on the street simply want to fuck you. The point is to look enough like a woman that they want to fuck you, but enough like a man that it pisses them off.”
“That’s right,” said Draco. He was grinning widely at him from over Oceania’s shoulder and his own green and yellow ensemble. “A box would be too obvious, Harry.”
Harry raised a brow, feeling his mouth tip up slightly. “Urm,” he said, crossing his arms as well. “I’m pretty bad.”
When they got back to the camp it was very late. They all recovered by holding onto the trees at the edge of the forest and groaning loudly for a few minutes, before trekking up to the cafeteria. There were noises, the sounds of people talking and laughing, coming faintly from somewhere close.
He took a slightly cautious step forward, and when it just continued to stare at him, held out a tentative hand. Mayo’s nose shot forward, instantly beginning to butt at his palm. It made screechy, short noises of pleasure.
“Well, then let me tell you how it’s going to be. I’m going to take you here, first, against this wall, and you’re going to scream, and then if you’re a good girl you’re going to eat me out, you’re going to suck me dry on your knees, and then I’m going to fuck you on the bed, until you can’t think of anyone or anything, until you can’t think of fucking a man again, until you can only think of me.”
Tom smiled benignly at Malfoy. “Well,” he said, once Malfoy was done glaring, “You didn’t bring him just to meet me, did you?”
“I’m just the brawn.” Neville gave Harry one of his signature smiles, all jaw and sincere modesty. “Lovegood’s the one with the vision.”
Harry let go of the door handle and turned to face the room. His back was pressed up against the wood.
Oceania pointed at him. “There’s my good bitch,” she declared, and promptly climbed over the table in order to ruffle his hair.
Harry straightened his back, and then added, without looking at her or anything really: “At least, I don’t think so.”
“No,” he managed, from where he was gripping to the counter and the fridge handle for dear life. He pulled himself back to security tentatively.
“Urm,” said Draco, staring at Harry liked he was a bit thick. “I think you’re pronouncing it wrong.”
She laughed, and then there was a sudden movement which nearly killed Harry. “What the fuck are you doing?” he shouted to no one in particular as he stumbled forward.
“Unless you have things to do.” Again, Harry wished he hadn’t woken up uncomfortable this morning. He had forgotten how hard it was to converse successfully when he was like this. It was easy to get things wrong.
“No,” said Harry. “But also, yes. She says it’s not official, but like…” He turned back around, having prepared both the cups. “You know.”
In some vague part of his consciousness, he was aware he would probably not do this if he was sober. He was glad he wasn’t though – here he could ask for what he wanted, what he truly wanted, and get it. What a beautiful way to exist.
Harry swallowed. Something was cresting in him again, but it didn’t feel like the blue. Draco’s gaze fell from his eyes, sliding down to his mouth. There was a thin line between his brows.
Before, the stillness had only contributed to the sensation of suffocation. It didn’t seem to bother him the same way anymore. He just noticed.
In the end, it was just this – Harry’s morning breath on his cheek before work, buying dinner ingredients together, learning each other’s grooming routines (if Harry called that grooming). In the end, it was Draco on Harry’s lap as they watched TV and Harry’s eyes on Draco’s as his fingers twisted inside him and the dawning realisation that the future for them stretched out of sight. It wasn’t a loud ending, because of course, endings don’t really exist. There were no explosions, no affairs, only a few fights that calmed down quicker than either of them expected.
– there was the position that had hurt so much the first time Harry had done yoga. He still couldn’t fully straighten his leg yet, but it didn’t hurt like it used to; whether that was a product of already experiencing it once or a sign of progress he didn’t know. Regardless, it didn’t hurt like it used to. Harry breathed in and out. It hurt, but it seemed to be a good hurt. Harry hadn’t known such a thing existed.
The sweat was clinging to him, making his skin feel rubbery and unpleasant, but he had come to like the feeling. It was proof of his physicality. All around him, there were living things. He had never really looked at them before.
“How’ve you been?” he asked when he came back, pushing one of the drinks across the table to her. Luna appeared to be thinking about it.
“Why,” he said, layering a very thin sheer of indignation on top. “But I only have sweet things to say.”
“Oh.” Oceania blinked. Then she smiled very kindly, and brushed two fingers over his shoulder. “Well, that’s perfectly okay.”
She turns and pushes back into Harry’s crotch, and then Harry’s hands are on her hips, in that tiny, tiny fucking dress – and maybe Harry is also a little tipsy, because the next thing she knows they’re back at Malfoy’s place and she’s sucking on that long white throat.
Draco exhaled and walked into the kitchen. He rinsed and dried his cup, counting to ten in his head, and then counting to twenty. Then he walked back into the kitchen.
It was not so unlike meditating after all. No wonder it had come from Buddhism. It was strange, Harry thought, this religion that was so intent on kindness, on uncovering soft and secret places inside of the individual. He was aware of his own ignorance, but all the same, he had never encountered a religion that was so gentle.
Harry looked down. Draco’s hands were still curled neatly along his waist, as at home as books on a shelf. That’s what Harry thought. That it looked like home.
He opened his eyes and pointed. “Especially you Luna. Because you were literally in my fucking dungeons.”
Draco just cries and cries and cries, turning her head into Harry’s chest, gasping as she tries to breathe, choking on the spasms wracking through her. And Harry smells so good, she feels so good – and all Draco can do is cry, all she can do is break.
Malfoy shrugged. “I mean.” He looked away, eyes darting around the room, and then looking back to Harry. “Are you though?”
“They apologised,” said Harry. “And they – they’re not bigoted anymore, I don’t think. From the way they talk.”
Harry scrambled up and stepped away, turning to cover his face. “God,” he said through his hands and tears. He hated the way his voice sounded. “Don’t.”
“How do you feel?” asked Tom. It was a strangely resounding moment, soft and uncomfortable – the memory of Tom tugging him close pushing into the room, the clean smell of his collar rubbing against his cheek as he asked the same question, over and over again.
They were at the pub getting lunch. It was only the third time Ron and Hermione had met Oceania, but it was Oceania, so they had warmed up quick.
“It's selfish.” says Draco. “Making the innocent French public endure the abnormal planes of your nudity, all because you-“
But the gardening was nice. Nothing miraculous. But just nice. Although, perhaps part of the problem was that Harry didn’t expect it to work. Almost…almost didn’t want it to. Because how could an event as huge as depression be dismantled by something as insignificant as gardening? It was ridiculous.
Draco scowls deeper, and doesn't move away. “I bet you don't even know what it's called.” He mutters, and Harry presses his lips to the side of Draco's temple.
Potter doesn’t notice. When Draco looks up, she sees that her cheeks are slightly flushed, and her eyes are very bright.
He sat down. The world was waking up, the sun rolling over the mountains like a newly-woken lover. From up here, the world looked so big. Was he really going to leave again? Where would he go? What would he do?
He breathed out heavily and rolled over to the side of the bed, sitting up. The carpet rubbed against the soles of his feet. Strips of moonlight clung to the walls.
“Yes,” said Draco, because he mostly was, and because some thoughts he still wanted to keep to himself.
Harry was the first to look away. He studied the turn of Draco’s profile, the way the sunlight slanted across his features. The moment almost didn’t feel real.
He was wearing a stripy jumper and skinny jeans. He was also wearing a beanie. In Harry’s imagination, for some reason, he had been dressed completely different. In the blue jumper perhaps. Definitely still with the leggings. In real life, he was wearing a beanie. Harry had never seen him with a beanie before.
Malfoy was standing a few metres away, his back turned to Harry. He was wearing a light shirt, which was easily transparent every time the wind touched him too.
“Hell of a question.” Draco couldn’t look at him. He looked at the coffee table instead. He hated fighting with Harry.
His heart was beating in his chest. “Thanks,” he said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible. “It looks good.”
They went in through one of the two wide doorways, stepping under the folds of bamboo sheets. Inside, everything was dim and potent; at the far end, the incense burned in neat sets of rows, rich and red and sweet.  Several painted statues of what Harry assumed were various gods were laid out, plates of fruit and sweets and burnt incense offered before them, and in the very centre of them all was a huge depiction of Buddha, one hand raised and the other resting by his lap, palms presented, his eyes closed peacefully. Harry wasn’t religious, but anyone would be affected in a place like this.
?” Malfoy shot back. He was on his feet. Harry was staring up at him, adrenaline beating through his system. “Your dragon is depressed, so you’re just
He must’ve gotten to the edge of the loch somehow. Then he must’ve looked at it. He must have thought about it. He must’ve started taking off his clothes.
“Do you think you’re selfish, Harry?” asked Hayden slowly. Harry stared at their mouth again, and as he did he remembered something he had been curious about earlier, but now suddenly seemed crucial.
“Listen,” said Charlie, turning back to all of them. “Thanks for taking me out tonight. It’s been great. I’ve had a really good time.”
Harry walked into the cafeteria and spotted Oceania and Hayden talking at one of the tables. They’d been together that morning. He headed over.
“Hey,” murmured Hayden, without looking at them. “If you’re going to flirt, at least do it outside the scene of sacred procedure.”
“Absolutely,” said Harry. “But now –” he patted his chest with his hand, “ – now it’s a sort of spiritual confusion.”
“Okay,” said Malfoy. He was smirking at Harry slightly now. “Got it. Harry Potter is a mere amateur in spirituality.”
Harry leaned into the doorframe again. The unpolished plaster was cold and rough against his skin. He cleared his throat. “All of this,” he forced out. “Hasn’t been real. I haven’t been being real. And – I need to be.”
“Harry,” she says, and when she looks up, Harry is staring at her, frowning, her eyes so confused. “Harry,” she says. “I can’t do it anymore.”
, when he had been having, well, such a good time a few seconds ago. He really did look on the brink of it, pink everywhere, tense as a bowstring. “Really.” A pause. “I was into it, too.”
He looked over at Malfoy. His face had finally calmed down to a healthier shade. With some reluctance, he met Harry’s gaze.
But his flat looked the same. Exactly how it had looked in his memory, exactly how he had expected it to. He had thought that it would be jarring, but it was so exact that, instinctually, he felt that he’d never been away.
Malfoy had could also be rather reserved. He hadn’t been reserved in Hogwarts. He hadn’t been reserved until he’d learnt he could lose, Harry supposed.
It turned out, when they got there, that their destination was not in fact a burlesque show, as Harry had reasonably assumed from Pansy’s outfit, and was instead an art exhibition. Harry did not understand why this had required him to change from a grey t-shirt and pyjama bottoms into all black, but there wasn’t much that he understood.
Draco hesitated, just a little, and then walked over and started throwing chunks of raw meat at Jane. He glanced over at Harry when he realised Harry was staring.
Draco’s leggings slipped off easily, a characteristic that only made Harry loved them more. Draco’s pants came off with them. They were white. Harry wasn’t looking at them. He was looking at the thatch of rusty brown hair knitted across his crotch. He was looking at the part where his skin darkened into it. Where he was hard. His skin was thinner than Harry’s – so everything was redder. Harry touched him.
Draco pointed his wand at his hand. It filled with oil. Then he moved so that he was kneeling between Harry’s open legs on the edge of the sofa.
"Nonsense, you're trembling really bad and between the two of us I've got more fat to keep me warm," he laughed and Draco smiled putting the jumper, to say that it was big on him would be a lie, it was practically swallowing the boy but he looked too cute to do a re-adjusting charm.
"I'm afraid that you'll need to ask some questions regarding today's events, but for now I'll let you rest, 100 points from Gryffindor and Slytherin, tomorrow expect a letter for you to go to my office, goodnight boys"
"I don't think it's my place to explain all this professor," was the first thing Draco listed once he woke up
“Well yeah mate, but let’s be honest, why would Voldemort want the ferret? I mean, aside from being a Malfoy there’s nothing special about him,”
“Because it’s Teddy’s party, and I’m afraid you’re going to stand out in an odd way if you show up with a tailored suit to a kid’s party at McDonald’s,” Harry explained, for the now 4
“All this nargles around you Harry, I think you kinda wish they would take you to worry away, sadly they just take material stuff,” said Luna sitting next to him, it was a cold afternoon but the view of the lake was nice. “Do you want to talk about it?” she asked with a soft smile and he smiled back.
Or where Harry begins to wonder whether things would've been different if he had shaken his hand with Draco in the first year.
“You know what, I should go to muggle London to buy one of those, I’m tired of hearing Ron’s attempts of singing in the shower,” he says jokingly and Hermione laughs, it’s no secret that Ron sucked at singing, but he didn’t blame the guy when the only artist he knew by hear was Celestina Warbeck. “You could come with me, I bet you would love it, and of course it would help with your class,” he said at Draco with a smile and the blond looked at him in shock.
"I'm getting too old for this," was the first thing Andromeda said when they stepped out from the fireplace.
The first thing Draco notices when he wakes up is the awful headache he has, he's been having those for the last couple weeks and no matter how much potions he takes they won't go away. When he was in his 4th year someone told him that he was gaining some pounds, and since then he doesn't remember the last time he had a decent meal, of course, there were good days where he actually ate and Pansy always smiled at him those days saying she was glad he was getting better, but all it took was some anxiety for him to be on his knees throwing up. This thing started on his 6th year, even Myrtle was worried saying that at that rhythm he was going to make her some company anytime soon.
“I just want to know what I’m feeling, and why am I feeling this way” he answered vaguely and she just nodded, “how do you do it? How do you decide whether someone is worth it before even getting to know them?”
"Well, I was wondering where was my son," a voice made the blond's bones chilled and he almost passes out. "It was quite a surprise when I arrived home and only was greeted by my wife and not my son, and I was hoping I taught you good manners boy" Lucius voice was cold and on the limit of becoming really loud.
“I just don’t understand why I need jeans, my clothes are perfectly fine Potter,” Draco complained as Harry kept putting clothes on the shopping bad so his annoying boyfriend tried them on.
The rest of the trip was uneventful, mostly Ron complaining about the heat and how glad he was back home where the Sun didn’t try to burn him 24/7, Hermione asking Draco if he started to study for their
They stayed in silence for a little bit, the gree-eyed boy was giving the other boy all the time he might need to continue with his story, the stag still lightning the place.
"I don't really know, I arrived when Theo was already there with Pansy and Draco, and then I heard him say something like 'how does it feel to be the chosen one's bitch, and if he screamed the same way with you like how he did with him' and I just lost it and punched him in the face"
“If I may have the attention of all the students please,” said McGonagall and with that, he stopped looking at the Slytherin table setting his eyes on the old woman, he still couldn’t believe that she was the new headmaster but it made him feel so safe because she was like her second mother, after Molly of course, in this life. “I hope you’ve all enjoyed the feast, I wanted to welcome you all to Hogwarts and I hope you start to see it as your second home. The rules have stayed almost the same, curfew still applies, no wondering on the forbidden forest, and no bullying allowed. We’re all trying to move on and holding old grudges is not a way of doing it, which is why you are going to be provided of two mind healers, it’s not obligatory to attend with them but I would certainly advise it if you were part of the battle or if you feel like talking with someone. Also, to improve our house unity you may sit wherever you want during meals, only the first and last day of school you are required on your houses table. With that being said, if the prefects can guide the students to their dorms please, eight years please stay behind for a moment”.
"It's not Draco's fault that you guys can't think of two things at the same time," said the red-haired girl and got back to his conversation with Pansy and Blaise while Ron ran to Hermione so he could complain a bit more.
And they were right, he needed to act as soon as possible, ignoring the fact that he feared that if he took too long Draco would realize how much of a mess he was and would decide that he was not worthy enough. But first, he needed to talk with his best friends, not that their opinion will change the way he feels, but after all, they always managed to shake some sense into him.
"I like your arse better without clothes," whispered Harry on his boyfriend's ear and kissed his cheek while handing him another outfit for him to try out
"You are not a coward Draco Malfoy, you're just scared and tired, but a coward person could never do what you have done these past months. It takes a lot of courage to change who you used to be, but it takes even more strength to tear yourself down and rebuild it from cero, and you have done it Draco. All by yourself"
"Well, don't stay all day on the floor, we are having guests at diner and I want you both in you best behaviour"
The more he learned about the world, the less sure he felt about his knowledge, all the blood purity stuff that was craved inside his brain sounded wrong and it made him feel confused, because if all muggles were dumb then why Hermione Granger was the brightest witch of her age? And if all blood-traitors were so bad then why Ron Weasley had so many friends? And if half-bloods were a disgrace, why Harry Potter became the savior of their world? And even though he grew up with so many doubts he never dared to do anything about it, until the Quidditch cup came just before his 4rth year, where the confirmation he needed about his father being a bad person finally came. That was the third time he had been completely terrified of his dad, seeing him with that mask that made it look as if his real face was the actual mask and not the silver one. He remembers seeing the golden trio and all the Weasley’s and all the chaos and in his own snarky way tried to tell Harry that he needed to get the fuck out of there, and take his friends with him. And it came out so wrong, but he didn’t care about what anyone thought about him anymore, he just wanted out of this life.
NEWTs and Harry telling them about his awful handiness when it came to fixing things. Soon it was time to change to their clothes and then they were waiting for a carriage to take them.
The small box contained a collections replica of the Nimbus 2000 he had used the first 3 years at Hogwarts, it also included some chocolate and a small potion."
"And you also need to buy those gifts you're missing," reminded him Draco and the black-haired boy rolled his eyes, he had totally forgotten about that. "And I think I know what crazy thing I want to do"
“Well, I think Luna’s right, you should just tell him, it’s not like you two never talk about your feelings”
Professor Slughorn still wondered how Harry managed to be first of his class to the worst potion student he has seen in a while, of course, and all Harry could think about was if the professor knew Seamus he wouldn’t think so low of him but there was no need to put down his friend in order to feel better, after all, he has always sucked at potions and if it wasn’t for the book that shall remain unnamed he would've still sucked at potions on 6th year… among other things, like, I don’t know, NOT being close to killing Draco Malfoy! He sighed, he was pretty sure his potion was about to explode any minute now, so why bother to try and end up making it worse?
Andromeda opened the door and Draco gasp getting closer to Harry, slightly hiding behind him from the woman, a small whisper from the boy let him know that she looked exactly like Bellatrix, but after a couple of seconds he started to calm down and entered the house. As soon as the door was closed Teddy came running down the stairs and threw himself into Harry's arms, so let go Dracos hand for a second and took the boy balancing him on his hip and taking the blond's hand again.
A lot of things happened after graduation, first of all, Hermione and Ron finally got married, the wedding was nice and Draco got to meet her parents, turns out her mother makes the best roast lamb ever, and since then Draco makes sure they have dinner at their house every month (also because their kids seem to really like each other, and as long as it is not his house the one being destroyed, Draco couldn't be happier to let them play together).
They fell asleep together, warming each other hearts as they keep away each other nightmares. Harry knew there was a lot of unsaid answers behind the last question, but he was scared to see what Draco meant by "many scars". And Draco knew he had to answer all Harry's questions at some point but in that moment red and blue made a beautiful shade of purple and they didn't dare to mess it up.
“You should just talk to him, I think you know him well enough to figure out how he hates to be lied to, or that things that include him are hidden from him,” said Luna while caressing Ginny’s hand with her thumb.
“Hello,” a dreamy voice said from behind, Luna’s hand was intertwined with Ginny’s. “How was the ride? I didn’t see you guys yesterday” she continued as the two girls sat beside Hermione. Ron began to tell them about the ‘madness’ their return to Hogwarts has been and that's when Harry's eyes locked with Ginny’s, he couldn’t help but smile at her and she did the same soon returning to pay attention to the chat.
The rest of the day passed as blur and he ended up in the same spot at diner, he was hungry and for the first time in weeks he started to serve different kinds of food in his plate, but he only managed to eat half of eat before excusing himself and started to walk back to the 8th year common room, he wasn't going to throw up, because he hated it, but when he saw Theo smirking at him he sighed, maybe if he threw up on him he would leave him alone. He laughed at that thought knowing that if he did that he was going to get cursed so bad, but maybe getting cursed was better than being fucked like that, he couldn't call it rape... right? Because he deserved it, and it was the right thing to do, they were engaged after all.
Christmas Eve was the best day ever, they woke up super early because they were determined to make the greatest Christmas diner no one has ever had and that required all the time they could get. The menu consisted of pudding, roast potatoes, mince pies, treacle tart and tea. The dished turned out better than expected and they ate so much they felt they were going to die from a stomach ache.
They both started to run to where it was the fight happening, and he was pretty sure Theo was almost unconscious by the time they got there, so Pansy ran again to look for Madame Pomfrey.
"I know you're awake Draco," said Harry and Draco sighed and opened his eyes. "How are you feeling, love?"
"Oh, I was waiting for you," said Blaise and offered him a smile which Draco tried to smile back but failed miserably "you look quite pale mate, do you feel alright?"
"Are you feeling better?" Draco cut Harry's train of thought with a small voice and the green-eyed boy just nodded.
“You defeated Voldemort and you’re afraid of telling Draco that you like him? Geez, and when I thought that a war was needed for me to realize I liked Hermione was pathetic enough you come here saying all this” joked the ginger-head and Harry throws a cushion at him as he exited the common room. “Good luck lover boy!” He heard before the door closed.
"Okay, one question for one question," he answered and he felt the blond nod against his chest. "I would like you to go first"
As soon as he saw his two best friends his thoughts about Malfoy went away and he ran to hug them, even though they saw each other during the summer they ended up going to Australia for a couple of weeks to be with Hermione’s parents.
“The great Harry Potter shagging boys and girls, that was something I wasn’t expecting, with the whole ‘saving the world’ crap I’m surprised you got time to do that” she smirked and it was Harry’s turn to laugh.
Okay, yes, he had feelings for the boy. But this was like that time where he had feelings for Cho and that ended with a very awkward kiss. So he began to wonder who he could talk about this without them having a meltdown over the fact that he was in love with his former enemy.
“So, you never actually told me when was Teddy’s birthday, all I know is that instead of two weeks in Paris we’re only going to spend one,” asked Draco while they were waiting in the queue to enter the restaurant.
"Sure, we can go to the movies tomorrow if you want," Draco nodded not really knowing what that was but still excited to see
"Well, when the King of Slytherin is served to you in a silver plate is hard to not take a bit, and when the Malfoy's hands you the heir in a red ribbon you don't say no," said Theo with a cocky attitude.
"Then don't," Harry smirked kissing him again and if it wasn't because someone hexed him he would've continued, he knew it was a stinging hex and it hurt a lot but he didn’t say anything letting Draco go, it has been hard enough for the other boy to regain confidence for him to just throw all that progress away just because someone decided to be a bloody idiot towards them.
“I love you so fucking much, but it doesn’t hurt as yours do, and if this is what it takes for you to calm down, I wouldn’t mind quieten your bad thoughts for the rest of my life.”
"-I'm just telling you that you would look ridiculous with that haircut, and only mom does a good job with those kinds of spells anyways"
"I'm gonna be okay, I promise, I'm just gonna go and say hi, I'll be back before dawn," and with that Draco kissed Harry quickly and appeared outside of Malfoy Manor.
“I mean yes, but have I ever told you the story about how he tried to defend himself with a chair instead of using his wand? He’s so stupid,” he laughed lightly, “and he’s so stupidly in love with you, in a way he has always been, not that I would’ve condoned a relationship between you two back then because it would’ve been so toxic… but now, Draco, you two have been through hell and back, he deserves to be happy but so does you so my best advice is to follow your heart and not your mind.” And with that, they began to chat about other things.
"I forgive you Harry, please forgive yourself, because I don't think we can be happy if we don't let go of a lot of things we did in the past, okay?"
“Well, that is your name, isn’t it?” Harry answered and they continue to walk in comfortable silence.
It has been a month since he last saw Draco Malfoy, and he was pretty sure that if Narcissa didn't send him a letter begging for his help he wouldn't have seen him again at all. But he couldn't deny that he was glad she did, because, in the end, her words reminded him of what Molly had said to Sirius once.
He felt a pair of lips against his, and at that moment Draco doesn’t care about how the kiss tasted like salt, or how he dropped the cup of cocoa, or how the sweater he’s wearing is stupidly thin for this weather. What he does think is about Harry’s hand feels on his waist, and how right the kiss feels, how his stomach feels like a million fluttering butterflies and how loved he feels.
"Whatever you want love, whatever you want" the green-eyed boy answered as he pushed carefully Draco on the bed so Harry could be on top of the other boy. "You're so fucking pretty," said Harry while leaving a trail of kisses and hickeys all over Draco's neck while setting himself on either side of Draco's thighs.
Pansy ended up breaking up with Blaise, since they had way more differences between each other that outgrew the amazing sex, that accordingly Pansy, they had, Draco is glad they ended up as friends and that Blaise is now happily married with Daphne Greengrass, Draco swears that their kids are going to be so fucking pretty. On the other hand, Pansy decided that it was time that wizarding fashion evolved and she partnered up with Luna and Susan Bones to make their own clothing line, the diversity they offer never cease to amaze him.
"Luna has been drawing a lot lately and some of the things she draws are so pretty, I want her to animate it after I get it done, which would be so cool."
"Well, it's time for class, let's go to Herbology Draco," said Harry while offering him a hand, which he gladly took because at this moment he doesn't trust his feet at all.
“Do you want to get started on the Calming draught essay? I know is not due until Friday but is better to be on track rather than letting things stack up” Draco said as he opened his potions book and prepared a new sheet of parchment.
"Yeah, I think we do," answered Draco, he tried to embody the persona he once was, all the Malfoy aura returned for just a second which seem to surprise Theo.
"No, I want them to be free and happy, if not there's always mind-healers we can send them to," Harry laughed and Draco punched his arm lightly. "I'm kidding love, I promise you that our kids are going to be amazing, brave and cunning"
"Let's go Pansy, I'm freezing and you guys are only going to be apart for 5 days, you'll survive," the desperation was noticeable on Blaise's voice, but Harry couldn't blame him considering that he, once again, had to give Draco his gloves and scarf because the boy was a firm believer that he was Elsa from Frozen but oh no, he wasn't, the cold did bother him and Harry hated when the blond get sick.
"Then you just need to look closely," Harry mumbled in Draco's ear, feeling how the smaller boy shivered, casting a quick spell the number 12  began to appear.
It took 10 minutes to finally clear the space and that is when Harry realized that only 5 Slytherin’s had come back, 11 Ravenclaws, 5 Hufflepuffs and 8 Gryffindors. Not bad, honestly, he thought it would be fewer people considering the circumstances, and he actually expected that the Ravenclaws outnumbered them.
So when the morning came by, despite not sleeping almost nothing, he decided that maybe he could be friends with the git… Befriending Draco Malfoy, he almost laughed at the thought but then he sighed, he couldn't deny that there were a lot of questions he always wanted to ask him. Like why he saved him that night at his manor or why he threw his hand to him when he came back from death. Or maybe there was still a lot of guiltiness inside of him from that day at the bathroom where Harry almost killed him or a little bit of anger for not receiving a "thanks" for saving him at the Room of Requirement. There were many mysteries around Draco Malfoy that in the end being his friend was his best, and only chance, to get some answers.
“And he let it slide the first time, he grabbed my wrist too hard while throwing me out of the room, but the second time he didn’t and threw a crucio to me, I laughed because he didn’t have that much hate, then again next to my aunt’s or the Dark Lord itself, any crucio feel like tickles” and Harry knew Draco was trying to let it sound like a joke, and Harry really wanted to believe it but remembering what Luna and Neville said he knew he was telling the truth.
“Honestly, she scares me, not more than Hermione but still,” said Ron and they all laughed joining Neville on a carriage learning all the cool stuff he learned this summer and how he was stopped at the streets by people telling him he was a hero.
It took them about ten minutes to finish getting ready and arriving at the Great Hall, once there Draco mumbles a ‘thanks’ and hurried to meet with Parkinson, so he decided to do the same with his friends.
"Harry, please," Draco stuttered and Harry moan against the blond's dick which cause the later to let out a loud moan, "I'm gonna cum if you keep doing that," and that was enough for Harry to stop sucking his boyfriend, instead he start to massage those pale thighs that drove him crazy, and after a few seconds the started to suck on them too, taking his time to make sure every mark was red enough for it to be replaced with a bruise later. Once there was no space left he felt how Draco grab his neck to pull him into a passionate kiss, they both moan while doing so because both of their dicks kept grinding onto each other while they kissed.
"Draco, are you sure you're okay? We've been trying to catch your attention for a while now" said Blaise, and that's when he noticed he was sitting in the Gryffindor table next to Harry and Blaise, he doesn't remember getting here, but by the look of his half-eaten apple, it looks like they've been here for a while.
"I just, I tried to do toast the way you did yesterday but I forgot the toes-terr did that thingy where it practically throws your toast," Draco explained feeling pretty embarrassed and Harry laugh.
"Hermione said that it was common in the muggle world to give one's parter a promise ring, so that way the relationship felt way more real but not so much as marriage, and of course I want to marry you and have 20 kids but we're too young for that and this seemed apropied, I like the thought of people knowing you're mine
Harry found hilarious the reactions Draco had while watching Christmas movies, he loved the way the blond was getting comfortable around muggle objects and how he began to question them less and less. Midnight came faster than expected and it was time to exchange gifts. Because it doesn't matter what Christmas meant to the entire world, gifts were amazing.
And so they began to walk to the main street so Harry could pull a cab to take them to the movies. They both agreed to watch a romantic comedy because neither of them was ready to see any kind of violence due to obvious reasons. Draco got terrified of the car, he didn't manage to understand what was going on and he was holding onto Harry's hand with more force than needed.
"Yes Pansy, I promise I'll help you search a dress for Blaise's mom wedding, geez it's like you don't trust me anymore," sighed Draco, apparently they need 10 minutes to say goodbye because they forget to talk about the important stuff at dinner.
And with that Draco smiled softly and walked away from Theo, sending Clouds to search Harry so he could meet him at McGonagall's office, he was ready to do what he should have done months ago, he was not afraid, he was ready, he was... he was feeling the emotions getting back to him, the fear and anxiety, his heart began to beat way faster than usual and his vision began to blur.
"Well, mom always said it's not about the way it looks but the way it tastes so today, you're going to learn the famous Weasley recipe of Treacle pudding," she announced and proceeded to ask for all the ingredients to the house-elves, constantly reassuring them that she was okay doing it and giving them a couple of galleons as thanks for their help. "Once Hermione gives you the talk about SPEW there's no going back," she said jokingly but with pain behind her eyes, which made him laugh.
"No, it's part of the Trick-or-treating thing, children dress up as something like ghosts, vampires or their favourite cartoon and they go house to house saying 'trick or treat' and the owner of the house gives them candy or if you're super lucky money"
And yeah, it was no secret that Pansy had a huge crush on Draco for at least 3 years of her life, but then again after the whole ‘losing my virginity with a Durmstrang boy’ thing that happened on their 4
Pansy was there as support, trying to be a keeper. She was smart and had good reflexes so he had high hopes.
“Could you cast a Patronus before I tell you what happened? I know you are waiting for me to tell you instead of asking,” said Draco with his soft voice and Harry smiled lightly doing as told, when the stag appeared he felt the blond’s body relax and he felt the grey-eyed boy’s head rest on his shoulder. He did want to know about whatever had happened but he knew better than to push the other boy.
“For the same reason you would believe him, love is a risk Harry and even though it might be the strongest thing in the world… it is a risk as well and you really should tell him before someone else does, that way you decide how and when, because I’m gonna be honest, the bets are getting out of hand,” said Hermione with a soft smile and Ron agreed
"Oh Draco, you used to be better at lying," Draco didn't expect the cruciatus curse but once he felt it he wasn't surprised at it.
Which is why he needed to stop wondering about how things could've been and start focusing on making Theo happy enough for them to have an heir, it was not a secret that being part of a pure-blood family came with a lot of responsibilities. You should always be in your best behaviour, you can't be weak, you can't be dumb, you must be the best at everything and never fail, failing equals punishment and punishments needed to be good enough for you to regret failing in the first place. So when his father found out that a muggle born was beating him in some subjects he locked him in his bedroom until he could repeat word for word all of his books, getting a stinging hex every time he was wrong. And then there was quidditch, he had to fly until he couldn't do it anymore, he couldn't remember how many broken bones he had that summer, but in the end, Harry Potter always beat him at quidditch. When the Dark Lord heard that he was never received the cruciatus curse before he gave free liberty to all the death eaters to throw the curse at him whenever they felt like it, his aunt loved this and used it every time he failed to close his mind while teaching him legilimency and occlumensy.
"That reminds me, I need to retrieve that thing you borrowed Draco, I'm sure it's in your room, am I right?"
"I never want you to be alone, come here," Harry's voice was raspy, which made Draco blush as he sat beside he green-eyed boy. "Do you want to talk about it?" Harry asked, making sure his tone was inviting and not demanding.
"Oh, it's a lamp, like a candle but it uses electricity, remember?" The boy nodded not really telling whether he remembered or not but continue to ask about all the things he didn't know about. This sure was going to be interesting.
In another time, Draco would've laughed at those words and hex the person, but now he could feel himself relaxing and melting in Harry's arms, the same way he did at their wedding where the green-eyed boy said those words, and so far... everything was alright. They sold the manor the moment Lucius died, his mother had already left to France the minute her house-arrest ended and was happily living with Andromeda. Teddy came to live with them 2 years ago when his grandma claimed she was too old to go over schoolwork again, and after all, it was Harry's idea to send him to a muggle school until his Hogwarts letter came.
“Draco, he was 15 and everyone was calling him a liar, give the boy some credit he has grown so much as you say, stop trying to sabotage your happiness just because you feel undeserving of it, love.” Was the last Pansy said before going to class.
He tried to enter Draco slowly, he knew that his boyfriend wasn't a virgin but he still felt the pressure to make this as special as he could, but Draco had other ideas because the moment he felt Harry's cock inside him he lift his hips up and pushed hard against Harry, both moaning loudly. Harry grabbed Draco's hips hard enough to leave another bruise, not that Draco cared because he was too focused on pushing himself against his boyfriend so he could feel him deep. After a while they found a good pace that managed to hit Draco's prostate almost every time.
Harry had always hated when people said that, because sometimes things weren’t going to be alright and that’s how life was, so to be lied to make him feel stupid. But he understood where he was coming from, because he had been there, telling everyone it was going to be okay when he was on the verge of giving up because honestly maybe it wasn’t going to be okay.
“I won’t give you any money, now, if you don’t want to wake up bold give me that photo,” he said jokingly and the two jumped in surprise.
"Just promise you'll write," the girl said and Harry could see Draco rolling his eyes so hard. "I know it's only two weeks but I get worried about you, it's not my fault you suck at taking care of yourself."
Such a pretty yet deadly thing was that necklace, he can still sometimes feel his bones breaking, or his head feeling like it was about to explode, so much pressure in it he could swear he tasted blood on his mouth. He doesn’t remember much more than that, his mother only told him that he had an awful fever but his father smirked and said that maybe this time he would learn to not touch what wasn’t his.
“I just- I haven’t seen him since the letter came! And he said he was going to go for a walk, but he had this look, oh that look” she tried to explain between sobs and too many hand movements “he had the same look that he had on year 6, and I’m so scared because he was doing so good- I promise” and then her words began to make no sense so Blaise step in.
“It’s okay, people are going to be shocked at first, but then again, people are always shocked at anything you do.”
They finally left and Draco was ready to leave as well when he felt his limbs stop responding, Narcissa was saying something to his husband but Draco's mind was in too much panic to understand what was going on. How did he manage to put himself in this situation? He just wanted a normal family, a normal life, a normal everything. He wanted a bad so he could scrub off the looks of Theo, and a draught potiong to help him fall asleep without thinking about his father.
"How dare you, I don't remember losing, never," he joked while Ron was trying to swallow his food to speak
"A cleaning spell would be magnific," Draco said a minute later, they were both laying on the bed, their breaths still uneven, Harry just laughed and cast it.
“Did you know what they did to him Luna?” she nodded but didn’t say more so he understood that the topic was over and decided to ask her to teach him to braid hair.
And yeah, Draco was ready for that talk, he has been ready since he got a tattoo, but that didn't mean he wasn't nervous of having it.
So they spent several minutes that way, not quite holding hands but touching each other. He saw Draco calm down a little, his trembling not so bad anymore but still present, and his face wasn’t full of fear but just expecting for something to happen. So Harry took his hand and pull him a little, the fact that Draco let him was enough encouragement for embracing the boy.
And being different got him a place where he felt he belong, a family of all red-heads that were kind and funny and loud, and that never, not for a moment, let Harry felt out of place, he got fed and hugged and every year he received a sweater or a scarf that was made just for him, that made the final statement that that was now his family. And then there were his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, both making him feel that as long as they were together he would be alright.
“Well that explains why Harry has been daydreaming all day,” the curly-haired girl said as she put her books on the table, “I mean, I've been known for a while that he fancies you, I ended up losing 5 galleons to Ginny because he told you right away and didn’t wait like I thought he would. He’s always so impulsive, I always wonder how he managed to survive his whole life”
And yes, Harry could clearly see why she was getting too old for this, Teddy was sitting on the ground with a mess of chocolate powder around him and his hair was bright pink. Low key he felt a bit jealous sometimes about Teddy's childhood and how different it was from his, but then he forgot about that and felt relief about it and tried to make it even better with whatever he could.
"I'm afraid that if you find out what's going on with me you'll think I'm dirty and won't want me anymore, and I know it's not true, that you wouldn't do that but you have to understand that my anxiety is so bad that I can't think of a better scenario," explained Draco once the classroom was empty. "And I know that I'm not doing the right thing by not speaking up but I'm so scared, and I'm not ready to be seen with more pity than usual, I just miss being me."
“I know you’re not okay, and that’s okay. We don’t have to talk if you don’t want to, and if you do I can wait until you can” He whispered and smiled when he noticed that the blond hugged him back beginning to sob softly. Harry doesn’t know how long they lasted like that, at some point, his hand started to pet Draco’s hair and soon they were laying down on the sofa, Draco slightly on top of him. He wasn’t crying anymore but Harry assumes that this was something the boy was craving so he didn't say anything to disrupt the peace.
“That’s what the cigarette was for” he answered lighting it off against the ground, “how did you found me?”
“The second year, who do you think sent Dobby? Obviously, my plans failed and you ended up here and almost got killed but yeah, after that I stopped trying because our relationship got pretty bad and I saw no point in it, until the summer after 4
talk to snakes, and yeah, let’s not forget the fact that he’s been trying to get murdered every fucking second of his existence.
"Thank you, I really needed that" and they both smiled. He said the last goodbye to his parents and started to walk away from the grave, and when he didn't felt Draco following him he turned around and saw the smaller boy enchant a small bouquet of lilies while whispering something to the grave. "You coming?" He asked with a smile in his face and Draco looked at him with soft eyes nodding and accepting the hand Harry was offering and they both apparated in an empty street of muggle London.
“How?” Was all Draco asked accepting gladly the cup and getting closer to Harry who just sat next to him.
"He's dead, you're just taking revenge over something that it's over, get over the past Theo, just because you got your way with me doesn't mean I'll allow it again, also, say goodbye to your pretty status because I will end you," answered Draco while taking a step away from him.
“May I braid your hair? Luna taught me this morning and I think you would look beautiful” say Harry awkwardly and when the blond gives him the biggest smile yet seen and nods he thinks that maybe that feeling that’s been messing up his head was love, but he had yet to find what type it was.
Draco never had a big appetite, he likes to think that he’s like his mother in this aspect, yes, he enjoys food but never in big portions, because it’s improper and show’s low class, “only poor people eat a lo Draco, it shows that they fear they run out of food, we don’t need to worry about that and besides, no one likes fat boys” his father told him when he turned 13, and after that, he refused for his mother to keep sending him chocolates every 3 days, only allowing it once a month and even then he gave most of them to Crabbe and Goyle.
In one hand he knew he was deserving of love… or at least he once was, but then he took a lot of decisions that led him to be the mess he was today, and apparently, a lot of people were accepting of his mess but Draco couldn’t help to feel like a burden most of the time.
year, he, for a moment felt 12 again. For a second Harry felt at ease; because Draco Malfoy was easy, he was so easy because Harry's anger never scared the other, on the contrary, he always fought back never for a second caring whether he was the savior of the wizarding world or not. Draco Malfoy was a constant, was his other half in the whole Yin and Yang situation they had going on since that afternoon at Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions where they had met 6 years ago.
Harry hugged Draco one last time and gave him a kiss, he headed to the shower and tried to calm himself down. Maybe he didn't ask a lot of questions because the answers he received instead of alleviating him, only created new unanswered questions and pained him at the same time. He had a lot of reasons why to kill Voldemort, there was never a doubt of that, but the fact that he continued to find reasons to do it makes him wish he was still alive so he could kill him all over again and again, just so Voldemort could feel at least a little bit of all the pain he had created.
"Well, I was not aware that a comedian's job was to tell truths," Harry teased and Draco just stuck his tongue out. "The jeans fit really well, though"
"Sorry, I have light feet, when you grow up in a home full of people you learn to make as little noise as possible," answered Ginny with a smile
"Draco I need you to calm down, you're going to choke yourself like this," but the other boy wasn't listening, "Draco, you have until I count to 3 to look into my eyes, am I clear?" dominance was clear in his voice, but not enough for the other boy to register it the wrong way
It was already quite late, past 12 Harry figured, there were only him and a Ravenclaw guy who was finishing a letter to send tomorrow, or so he heard. But soon it was only Harry in front of the fireplace, it was one of those nights where sleep was hard to conceal, thankfully he was passed over the flashbacks and feeling guilty over everything that happened, he saw a mind-healer during summer. At first, it was to shut up Hermione but after the second session he actually began to feel a lot better, he discovered a lot of things about himself and came in peace with the idea that he was put on a position where he had no choice, and that he did the best he could and no one blamed him, so why was he blaming himself?
“This…” Harry hesitated, checking what he was about to say. If he wanted to help, he had to expose himself, too. “This time, this space you’re experiencing. This is for you. This is your time with yourself. Let your subconscious find you.”
“You don’t have to whisper,” Hayden muttered, rolling their eyes. One of the monks who was standing closer to them, an aged man with a museum of leathery wrinkles, smiled more widely at Charlie and nodded encouragingly.
A glamourous Queen was standing at a microphone, her padded curves swathed in a fishtail gown. Her blonde coiffure was swept up in a classic pageant do. Her eyebrows were drawn on at an angle that made her look permanently appalled with what she saw.
Malfoy went silent. He licked at the soup in the corners of his mouth, and then at the edge of the metal opening of the thermos, which was a bit gross. Then sighed and pushed himself up.
Harry handcuffed him to the table. As he was turning the key, he said, “Aren’t you worried that I’ll just leave you here?”
Harry closed his eyes. He reached out and took a sip of the coffee anyway and burnt his tongue. He opened his eyes.
“Look at me,” she says, and Draco does, and her eyes are so green, her eyes have always been so green,
The kitchen in Harry’s flat wasn’t separate from the rest of the space. It was one of those open kitchens that existed right next to the vague sort of lounge area/hallway. The only thing that separated it at all was a long black island, one of those modern ones with the marble tops and the lights underneath. The rest of the kitchen was composed of a matching counter that emerged from the wall and wrapped around the island like a quadrilateral harbour. On the one parallel to the counter was the sink, the fridge, the dish-washer, and the coffee machine.
“I’ve been ready for a long time,” he whispered, and then the desire in Jane snapped and they were off.
When he woke up, he was lying back against the mat, blinking up at the cracks in the ceiling. He sat up. Tom was holding a string of beads, a book with characters open in front of him. He looked over as Harry moved.
Harry reached out. It shouldn’t have been so charged, the movement of his fingers extending through the air, except now that he had consent, he had to actually do it. He hadn’t really thought about what it would be to touch Draco Malfoy, in his kitchen, on a Friday night. He had thought about what it would mean; not how it would feel.
He realised he was smiling as he read it. He bit at it a little, thinking. Surely, it couldn’t have been that much of an issue if no one else had brought it up. He wondered why Draco had bothered to send it. If he had even meant to.
Harry pulls back after a couple moments and flops onto her back. Her hand wanders down, brushing Draco’s nipples, spanning her waist absentmindedly, as if the task doesn’t require her full attention. Draco arches her back.
“Merlin,” said Malfoy, appearing at the bald man’s left. He had to squeeze past the shoulder pads. “You’re early.”
Luna smiled at him. “Thank you,” she said. “I still love daddy dearly of course, but it felt like time to be on my own.”
“Merlin,” Draco gasped, and broke off the kissing for a moment, his head helplessly thrown back. The kitchen ceiling looked strangely still. “You don’t waste time, do you?”
Pansy finally looked up at him and raised a brow. “Because,” she said, “it’s a completely different process, and a completely different product.”
“Hey!” Oceania threw down her knitted bag on the table, beaming down at them. “Look who I ran into!”
Charlie and Harry were lying on the ground, staring up at the sky as Jane snorted grumpily in their direction. Charlie had just tried to put a saddle on her. He was panting.
Malfoy huffed out a half-laugh. Then, also like he couldn’t help himself: “I don’t know many straight men who crochet.”
“Draco Malfoy,” he said, and the words echoed. The soft cushioning of the “l’ and the “f” pressed together in his mouth. In the dream, he reached out.
Anyway, he noticed everything. But particularly about Harry. And he could tell, just from looking at him, just from the quality of his voice – that Harry found him…bemusing. Funny. Like an annoying household pet, or one of those ugly dogs that are kind of cute when you squint your eyes. At first, he had thought it was pity, because Harry had seen him at a time when he really, really wasn’t supposed to have been seen – he
And with that Harry learns a new thing, Draco Malfoy has the best timing when saying he loves Harry and the most creative ways of doing so as well.
"A muggle way, you mean, I still can't believe you forget you're a wizard Harry" laughed the redhead and the black-haired sighed, of course, magic could've done that process easier. "And anyway, why aren't you spending Christmas with us this year? If it's because of Ginny well she already got Luna, and if it's because you're feeling guilty or something stupid like that, don't forget that we're your family."
In the end, she ended up being nicer than he anticipated, she even told him about how Harry Potter brewed the same potion almost 4 years ago, and she was kind enough to keep an eye on it when he couldn’t. He also learned that she decided to come back as a ghost in order to haunt student Olive Hornby in revenge for her bullying, and he laughed at that with her because he would do the same. Sadly her haunting plans went too far and she ended up being obliged to remain at the castle.
“They were good friends once, you know? We all were, but then he became obsessed with you and that childish game you played of being the alpha man or whatever and they started to drift apart, when the summer of 4
And then his Hogwarts letter came, maybe that was one of the happiest days of his life, he still dreams about the small smile on his father’s face proud that his heir was actually a wizard and not a useless squib. Hogwarts became the only place where Draco could be loud and not so cautious like he was at home, but he had to ruin it, didn’t he? He wasn’t like his mom, who could make friends with everyone and be charismatic, no; he had to be like his father who only knew how to make allies out of fear and manipulation. And Draco hated it, he always knew he hated it so much, and what he hated more is that no matter how much he loathes his father, he still did everything for him to be proud.
“Oh, yeah, Seamus bought one and I helped him enchant it so he doesn’t need to plug it to electricity” and so she began explaining the whole concept of electricity, the internet and how you download music for you to listen. Draco listed really carefully, writing notes as she spoke trying to not miss any peace of information, and after 1 hour he was done with his work and gave it to Hermione to proofread the new words.
"I know that it needs a lot of work still, but I hope you can make yourself at home during your stay-"
“I attempted to throw myself out from this tower several times before, but I guess I was just too coward to do it… I still am, but now I can just pay someone to push me and then everything will just be done” said Draco when Harry lowered the letter “can you imagine the header at the prophet? ‘Ex-death eater killed on the same spot he tried to murder his old headmaster’ or ‘Ex-death eater kills himself out of guiltiness’ I don’t know which one is better” he continued, attempting to laugh, but instead he broke down crying. “I just want everything to stop, I don’t want to get married to Theodore Nott, I don’t want to be the perfect little boy, I don’t want to be a Malfoy or the Slytherin prince, I just want to be me even if I don’t know who I am” ugly sobs interrupted every third word he said but it was like he didn’t even noticed, same at the way his nails dig his palms, trying to get blood out of them.
"That's not fair! You can't flirt with Harry, he's weak!" screamed Ron once they were all down their brooms.
“Isn’t that a thing couples do?” Draco asked confused and harry took this opportunity to put an end to his suffering
Harry loves the sweet tooth Draco had, and now he and Ron always had some sort of sweet on their robes in case Draco felt light-headed, which didn't happen as much as it did before, mainly because Pansy would practically force-feed the boy, on the other hand, Draco just began to have more appetite and he always said that his mother taught him that it was rude to not eat while the other person did and vice-versa, so Harry made sure to never skip meals when Draco was with him, which was more time than he had anticipated.
“Hey,” he said softly while shaking his shoulder lightly “we fell asleep and you need to get up,” he said a little louder and when he noticed the boy didn’t stirrer at all he knew other measures needed to be taken.
"So, what's the plan for tomorrow? Does Teddy have a McDonald's in mind?" asked Harry as he poured sugar and milk into Draco's tea, knowing exactly how much he liked.
“I know that you’re supposed to be the chosen one and whatnot, but why can’t you just let this go, Harry? We have more important things to do than follow this vague story Malfoy could’ve easily made up to brag with his friends,” Ron tried to reason with the black-haired boy for, what felt like, millionth time that week.
"I had a part of Voldemort soul in me, you know? And I sometimes wonder if that's why I was so brave sometimes, or well... Reckless. Sometimes I felt this horrible hate inside me and during the war, it got worse, because not only I had to deal with everyone's expectations, and my own fear but also his emotions, his fear and anger." Harry stopped and Draco cleaned a tear from the tanned boy. "I hated it so much, but what I hated the most was when he allowed me to see through his eyes, because I got to see what it was like to be feared and somewhat respected, and it scared me that I kinda liked it at times because I figured my life would be so much easier if people treated me like that, but now I know that I would've hated if people treated me like that because I hate being special."
The common room was behind a pretty portrait, where the lady was very nice, the password was Novis inittis which made everyone smile and on the inside, it felt cosy which was nice for the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors because it reminded them of their own dorms, but it was also neat and with a lot of places to sit and hang out or study.
"Magnificent, you know I'm naturally pale, not all of us can have beautiful dark skin Blaise" he tried to joke and when his friend laugh he let out a sigh, lately all of his actions felt like an act.
It has been a week and Harry kept thinking about those words, it was almost Christmas beak and Draco was all over his mind for all the right reasons this time. But for some reason Harry still doubted what was clear as water, so to soothe his anxiety he decided to write a list, I mean, lists worked just fine when it came to instructions or rules, so maybe a list of cons and pros would be the final thing for him to make a move regarding his feelings for Draco.
"Maybe I don't know how to ask for help," Draco says after a moment of silence, "but to be honest I've realized that I don't know a lot of things"
They started to walk, and he thanked the lord that Harry didn't ask questions because he doesn't know if he had the answers. They arrived at the classroom and sit together, their intertwined hands remained that way and it made Draco's heart feel warm. But there were voices telling him that he shouldn't allow himself to feel this way, because what if he got used to it? Falling in love with Harry Potter was a mistake he had already done and to this day he still wonders whether he fell out of love or not from him, but considering the current circumstances he guessed he didn't, or if he did he was falling in love all over again, and he deep down wished that the other boy could fall in love with him as well.
"Oh c'mon, it's not that bad, Draco got one on the holidays and he barely flinched, we can go together! I wanted to get one as well but I got scared"
"Are you okay?" Draco asked and Harry could see how much deeper the question was intended to go, and no, of course, he wasn't fine. He was scared and angry, and hurt and happy. He was physically okay, the fire didn't get to him, but it did to Draco, just a bit of his arm. oh, and then there was that, how was he supposed to be okay after finding out your boyfriend tried to cur his arm off in every possible way while trying to heal his burns for a fire he started after feeling deeply unsafe in what was supposed to be his home.
“Then why yours are so bad? Yours held a story too and I bet he would love to hear about it too,” Luna answered while grabbing another apple to feed the thestral in front of them. “I know you too well Draco, I spent a long time seeing you almost daily being terrified of your life and you have the same look right now, you’re terrified of what could happen if you say yes. But just remember that you haven’t considered what would happen if you say no”
“Hello, Draco here says you’re friends and as weird this situation is the Slytherin table is being too stupid for their own good so you’ll have to deal with us” she explained filling two plates with random food and putting one in front of Draco and one in front of her. “Nice to see you, Luna, those are really pretty earrings, do they keep the nargles away too?” she asked as if she and the girl were lifetime friends, and honestly maybe they were considering that Pansy had many friends outside Slytherin and Luna liked to talk to whoever listened to her without making fun of her.
was a confession? I’ve been obsessing over that small sentence for a whole week and it turns out I was right the whole fucking time!”
"Well, I have no classes left and you don't either, and I'm kinda hungry so let's go to the kitchens, I'm feeling adventurous today"
“I just don’t get how you can still follow orders of someone who ruined your life, I sure as hell wouldn’t be following Dumbeldore’s orders after all that happened, no matter how wise he was, it is my life and now that I’m just myself I want to live it as
"I hope the inside looks better than the outside," said Draco laughing while taking Harry's hand and running to the entrance.
“You’re no fun, and anyways, what are you doing in here if you don’t want people to be taking pictures of you, be glad Dean had to send her mom a letter early if not other people would’ve found you two cuddling” and that’s when Harry noticed that Draco was still sleeping on top of him and his limbs were tangled from sleeping together in such a small space. “Wake the git up, it’s almost breakfast time and people are going to start showing up” they both left, and even though they didn’t give him the photo they were right and he had to wake Malfoy up.
"I know that I just... I think I need to be away from everything magic-related, you know? And I happen to know someone who needs that as well, so I think I just want a boring muggle diner and a movie," Harry smiled while taking his bag so they could head to the train. "And I'm going to be there for boxing day, so don't miss me too much."
"Are you sure?" And the blond really wanted to answer but his ears start ringing too loud and everything was in slow-motion and then... nothing.
"Oh dear, I'm still sorry though, I wouldn't have forgiven myself if I had killed you that day, I still can't forgive myself knowing that some of the scars you have are because of me."
Harry took the blanket off their bodies and tried to sit up, getting surprised when he managed without much struggle, either he was getting stronger with his daily exercises or the other boy was stupidly skinny. He tried to shake him again and finally managed to wake him up, it took him a couple of seconds to understand the situation and when he did, he practically jumped off the couch and ran to the dormitories.
“For a second I thought yesterday was a fever dream, but I guess we did spend the whole ride with the git and didn’t die,” said Ron and Hermione elbowed him making him gasp “hey! I’m not saying anything wrong! I’m just getting used to the new normal Mione, geez you have such skinny elbows that really hurt!”
“More than you know” Draco mumbled catching Harry by surprise “do you want to read it? The letter, I know Pansy told you” so he just nodded and accepted the letter the boy hands him.
“But as they say the third is the charm and after giving me a particularly heavy calming draught he did what he must, I tried to let the potion work but it hurt so much, he didn’t care about me crying, I mean… I deserved it, it’s my karma for being on the bad side, and after all, I do enjoy having sex with blokes so-“
“Mm,” said Draco, and then one hand came down, off the hip, and reached out to finger at the bottom of Harry’s jumper. He rubbed at the material between his index finger, his thumb. Harry looked down, watching him. His heart was racing. He didn’t understand how the action was making his body feel quite this way.
It was a beautiful thing, Harry reckoned, to be surrounded by people that you admired. It must be like walking through a garden.
“It doesn’t matter what our bodies did,” Oceania said calmly, looking at him. “Not when our minds were so in sync. Only know that whatever it was, our bodies did it very well, and multiple times over the course of the night.”
It’s barely a week later when Harry arrives on Malfoy’s doorstep at eleven thirty. Malfoy opens the door, gives her a one over – just basic jeans, a jumper, hair in the same messy ponytail – and then leans languorously against the doorframe and smirks.
This chapter's song is Take U There by Missy Elliott, Jack U, and a fuckton of other people. If you enjoyed, please leave a comment! It means a lot. And as always, thanks for reading :*
“Harry,” said Draco, looking up again into his eyes. “You don’t have to do this because we are friends.”
He opened them as he felt Draco exhale in his ear. It was a sweet sound, a shocked inhale of breath, and then they were dipping. Harry was too stunned to make a noise. The wind rushed past them like liquid.
Harry said again, and left the room as Charlie groaned. If he heard the phrase “sucking cock” come out of Malfoy’s mouth again, he might implode.
Luna turned back to the hot chocolate. “Anyway,” she said, “gardening is very good for mental health. I’ve read a lot about it. It’s why a lot of retired people do it.”
“You’re so strange,” Draco muttered as he looked away, rolling his eyes pointedly, but it didn’t change the embarrassed curve of his neck. He turned and rummaged through the drawers before flinging some blue material at Harry. “Go get changing in the bathroom,” he said, without turning around.
“Come to my aid again, have you?” said Malfoy without turning around. When Harry didn’t say anything, he looked over his shoulder and raised a brow. “Or do you just like my top that much?”
After another five minutes, the forest opened up. Birds fluttered overhead, calling to each other in strange languages, and the grass beneath them thickened. To the side, the trees veered off over the side of a cliff, unveiling the starling expanse of mountain tops rising up beyond them.
They drank it on the sofa. Harry kept looking at the long line of Draco’s throat, and the places where the frayed collar of his jumper brushed against his skin. When he’d finished drinking, Draco put the tea cup down and said, “I’m not staying, you know.”
“I’ll say your name all night long if you keep doing just that,” said Harry. “I’ll put it in the sky for everyone to see.”
Over her shoulder, Malfoy quirked a brow at him. Harry scowled at him quickly before looking back up.
“Well,” she said, once she was settled. She clasped her hands together on top of her thigh. “You don’t have to talk, Harry. But if you’d like too, now would be a good time, while the tea is still too hot.”
“Your Highness?” he said, raising a brow as he held out one hand. Oceania giggled and took off her shoes. She reached for Harry, who promptly gave her his hand as well. There was a brief struggle and lots of groaning as she attempted to balance herself on top of Draco’s thigh.
“Mmm.” Luna hummed thoughtfully, as if she was only just deciding what she needed now, after calling him. “I thought that you could come over and help me with the gardening,” she said, a few moments later.
Jane had her eyes closed when they arrived. The sunlight was gleaming off her scales, sticking itself to her long blue eyelashes. Harry hadn’t even noticed that she had eyelashes before.
Malfoy’s lashes moved up and down again. “I was. I wasn’t. You know what they say. Give a man a gimp mask.” He straightened up abruptly, his hands moving wider apart on the sides of the table-top. “Oh, it’s such a bore to talk about school. I never knew you lived so close. There’s a café a few streets down that bakes wonderful bagels. They put halloumi in them, and this sauce – delectable. Do you like bagels, Harry?”
“Good, good,” said Gao, as if this was a perfectly acceptable answer. “And what brings you here today?”
Draco keeps on crying, moans turning to whimpers that in some abstract part of her mind she wishes she could put a stop to – and Harry leans down and peppers kisses all over her tear tracks, rocking her back and forth.
The next room turned out to be the kitchen. Harry blinked at the long, narrow island, stretched out in front of him like a bar counter. Draco was behind it, busying himself in the cabinets. His arms were reaching up, hands moving along the highest shelf. He was on his tip toes. His socks were green.
Malfoy looked good. He was wearing a white blazer that looked like it’d been bought from the women’s section, with a blush pussy bow blouse underneath. The blush was less pink than the one on Malfoy’s face.
That was how Harry Potter found himself bouncing on his heels in the arrivals lounge of Glasgow airport with a popcorn Frappuccino in his hands. Half the cream had already melted.
Malfoy’s eyes widened in something like alarm. Enough seconds passed that Harry began to feel embarrassed, but then Malfoy lifted his fingers. They were long, like his arm, like his face. They were long, and they quivered as they curled, ever so gently, around Harry’s jaw. Harry wrapped his hand around Malfoy’s wrist to still them, around the bouquet of blue veins.
“Sand is here,” Charlie whispered. Tom raised his brows and quietly said what Harry assumed was a translation for the monks who couldn’t understand English.
He looked over at the fragile light illuminating the person beside him. Draco was looking out at the green too, the sunlight like dew in his lashes, and he was so beautiful just then that Harry had to stop. They were on an idle Sunday walk in early December, and you could taste Christmas in the air.
“Harry?” Harry turned to find Hayden resting their chin in the folded basket of their hands, watching him.
“It’s not normal,” said Harry, through the obstruction of his palm, and then he took his hands down. “God
She jutted a thumb back towards the small set of shelves behind her. “Arrived two days ago, but I was in the middle of a book.”
“There’s no time like the present.” Charlie was already heading off towards another mountain path. Hayden shot Harry a look of dry amusement, and Harry grimaced back, before following Charlie up the path.
After a few more moments, he sat straight up and turned the light on. He rubbed at his eyes, the yellow light pricking through the red of his eyelids, and then turned out of the bed and padded across the carpet, trying to find his socks from the day before.
Once he’d had calmed down enough again she held up his tea for him. It was indeed, conveniently cool by now. He drank.
Harry almost said. Instead, he just nodded, and let Hayden leave him there, at the bottom of a small mountain.
Draco swallows, and swallows again, and licks her lips and starts to stand up. And then Potter’s dark brows are very close again, and her thin lips are even closer.
“I don’t need that,” he was saying now, and it wasn’t true. He knew exactly how much he needed to survive.
He opened his eyes. His gaze ran along the trails of soil in front of him, embedded with grasses and twigs, clambering over to where Malfoy’s pale knuckles waited a few inches away.
They did not, as Harry thought they might, lead him to the living room, but instead went straight to what must have been Malfoy’s bedroom.
Back in the plaza, he unrolled it slowly, making sure it was flat. Then he took off his jumper, and started doing yoga.
“’Pretty good’,” scoffed Malfoy, accepting the drink as Harry pushed it back to him. “Don’t talk to me with such filth. Here, Charlie, you try.”
Also, I realise this chapter ending reads a lot like an Ending. It is not the Ending. There is a little more to come, although I haven't entirely decided what yet. (Hahahaahahah.) Let me know what you thought.
Draco had said he was going back – he hadn’t said when. After a few days, Harry said, “I should introduce you to Hermione and Ron.”
Hayden tilted their head to the side. There was something amused by the set of their mouth, Harry thought. He went over and leaned somewhat awkwardly against the counter.
"I wasn't much help to the Aurors, but they said that with what you had already testified my father wouldn't see sunlight in a while and hope it's true."
"You should totally get a tattoo though, and if you wanted to look edgier for Hermione you could do it the muggle way"
They entered to the store and Harry took a basket to put their shopping items, Draco's hand secured in his, they started to look around, the blond made a lot of questions and was so confused at the TV's, well rather how they worked without magic, and Harry made a mental note to take Draco to the movies. They bought the costumes and a Pikachu plushie for Teddy and started to walk to a small coffee shop, it was already lunchtime and Harry figured they still had some time before they needed to go to Andromeda's house and take Teddy trick-or-treating.
time, and deep down he was glad that this year Teddy decided to keep it small because last month he found on the internet about a place called Chuck e Cheese at the US where they had a rat as a mascot and Andromeda decided that things would get wild on a place like that. “C’mon, try on this, we still need to go home and change for dinner with Pansy and Blaise,"
"And don't you dare tell me that you're fine, because I can clearly see you're not, you haven't been in a long time and even if it got somewhat better since you returned from winter holidays you're acting weird, and they whole panic attack with Theo has got me thinking he's part of this whole mess you're turning yourself into, again."
"Oh really? What is it?" Harry tried to play it cool making Draco laugh, he never succeed to play it cool but just listening to that laugh was enough for him to call it a victory
, not just 'a partner'" Draco was blushing deeply while giving his rant, "but if you don't like it I can just-"
Things have gotten heated in the past between both of them, but Harry was always hesitant on taking it further being afraid of pushing Draco’s boundaries, and honestly, he didn’t mind because their relationship was more than sex. But this was the first time Draco initiated something of this matter and Harry was no one to tell Draco when he should or shouldn't be ready for this. Harry broke the kiss this time, only to try and read the situation but failing at it. Draco's pale face was now flushed and he was panting.
"Well, it's always good to know how to be sneaky, am I right?" the girl never failed to amaze him, he couldn't understand how Harry let her go… well he did but still, she was a catch and Luna was so lucky to have her. "I am as lucky as she is, it's like fire and ice, together we make a cosy environment, you speak out loud sometimes," she laughed and offered him her hand.
By the time he arrived at the kitchens he had the perfect plan, he knew Draco was going to be at the Astronomy tower tonight, it was Friday and they always met up there on Friday’s. So he was going to give his the chocolate parfait and wait until he was finished (he figured that telling him in the middle of a bite and making the other boy choke was not the most romantic thing to do) he was going to confess. If the reaction was positive he was going to kiss the boy and if it wasn’t then he was going to throw himself out from the tower and die.
"To kill me, please kill me, end-all of this Harry, if you love me say that pretty spell and let me bleed out, please," Draco cried, his eyes were unfocused and he started to cough.
"Oh no, I must have left it in Hogwarts, but if it's too urgent I can just buy you a new book," Draco bit his lip so he could just be finished with this day.
"Why did you testify in my favour? You owed me nothing, and I know you feel like you did for the things I did for you, but then again you saved me right back so... I just don't get it, more than not getting it I feel like I don't deserve it"
“Because you were the chosen one and liked the attention?” suggested Malfoy with a tone of sarcasm that made Harry smile.
and not someone else," Draco explained with a soft smile and Harry returned it giving the boy a kiss on his temple.
"Why aren't you eating? Did you not liked what I ordered?" he heard Draco asked, and when he connected his eyes with Draco's grey ones he smiled reassuringly and offered his hand to the boy, who took it immediately.
"Sure we can, I don't know why I have a feeling you're gonna enjoy Frozen, you hungry?" Harry asked and Draco nodded, so they both head to a restaurant they passed earlier.
“I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor is Ron,” Harry answered awkwardly bringing his hand at the back of his neck.
"I was never angry with you, you know? I was so grateful once you did it that I wanted to say thank you, I was gonna throw myself out from the Astronomy tower one of those days, either way, so you technically made my life easier, I got so angry at Snape for saving me that he almost took me to St. Mongo's"
Harry could still hear the screams, it reminded him of that night at the manor where Bellatrix tortured Hermione. He could still feel the taste of vomit in his mouth as Neville asked Draco if he dreamed about the cruciatus curse and Draco just nodded. He could still see the broken face of the boy, sobbing while apologizing to everyone for waking them up, saying he felt really stupid for not remembering the silencing charms and how he screamed his heart out when Harry tries to hold him saying he wasn’t worth it.
"She cares a lot about you, it's cute," said Harry as they start to walk out from Platform 9 3/4 onto the busy streets of London.
Draco opened the box and the first thing was a portable advanced potion maker, and the other thing was a small dragon which Hermione and Charlie helped him to enchant so Draco could ask for help to whoever he needed instead of casting a patronus. Draco love it so much he started to cry and Harry just hugged the boy until they began to make out and then continued to talk about their other presents, Harry explained that the Weasleys didn't send their gifts since he was going to go to the burrow the next day.
"May I come in?" The boy asked in a small voice, and Harry nodded immediately, his eyes never leaving Draco's face. His big grey eyes were red and he saw the dry tears on his cheeks. But he also saw the milky thighs underneath the big jumper he was wearing, if  this situation was different Harry was sure as hell he would be hard "I'm sorry for waking you up, I just don't want to be alone but I can leave if you-"
love me,” the boy began to panic and before he could fall into a spiral Harry grabbed his arm and hug him.
“Don’t be silly Harry, you’ve done more than enough, I want to give you all the love that was denied to you, I want to make you so happy that you’ll forget how you felt before… but would you give me time? I’m not saying no, I’m just saying we take it slow, please? Just until we know this is real and it won’t go away in the morning”
Its scales too, were limp and soft around the edges, the ridge along its back a soft wave of pale ripples, almost like an exaggerated human spine. Really, it was quite ugly, when you squinted at it.
Harry closed his eyes. His body ached, all over, from the crying. The humiliation of was still stretched tight within him.
She looks the same as ever – dark skin, thick brows, thin lips – her wide hips, her stocky set of legs, which are slightly apart now, planted so solidly in the ground she looks like she grew out of it. Her hair is longer than it used to be, and her robes billow out around her. They look expensive.
The day dawned, slowly, cracking like a shell over the curvature of the night. Light, as liquid as yolk, dribbled down over the frayed edges. Harry got out of bed.
There was a pause. “Urm,” said Harry, after a moment, as he desperately tried not to take too much in all at once. “I think, uh, that I might be?”
“You heard the woman,” said Draco. He looked delighted to have been chosen, or maybe paperchains was more exciting than Harry had anticipated.
Hermione wiped at her eyes with the corner of her sleeve. She had mostly stopped crying now. As soon as she let Harry go she had insisted on making Harry tea. Harry was incapable of saying no to her at a time like this.
“Goodbye, Harry,” said Malfoy, and turned before Harry could answer, heels clacking on the cobblestones.
“Yeah,” he said. “I was really just, like, listening to my gut, you know. Artistically. It was drawing me towards a certain vision.”
“There’ll be good days and bad days.” Malfoy reached out to stroke Jane and she flinched back. He pursed his lips. “You can’t let it get to you.”
“I mean,” he said. “I feel a bit like we misjudged them. Back in Hogwarts. Like, they’re still people, even if they were wrong.”
Harry swallowed hard. “Tell me how to start then,” he said. It came out sounding more desperate than he’d wanted it to.
“Go to sleep, Harry,” he said, but Harry could tell he was smiling. He smiled too, and did as he was told.
There was no carpet on the ground. In the middle of it sat someone cross-legged, clearly in the middle of prayer. Malfoy raised a hand to Harry’s chest, gesturing for him to stay still, and pressed a finger across his lips. Harry stilled.
They were empty right now, but were clearly used. Draco passed them without paying them much of his attention. He clearly familiar with the route.
“Oh,” he said, when he realised they were waiting for his input. “It happens sometimes. I’m pretty sure. The moment of connection can often be an overwhelming thing, for both parties. The urge to…escape is relatively normal. Especially if the dragon isn’t entirely healthy.”
Harry had stuff he could be doing. He tore his gaze away from Malfoy, and back to the undergrowth. Straightening, he muttered, “Well, I guess I’ll see you around,” and made to head from the forest.
Delia said the last part with him. He rolled his eyes, playing along, then noticed a white head walking past the window.
He got a glass of water. Leaned there with one light on above him, white and lonely. He drank the water. He put it down in the sink, and then he closed his eyes.
he said. Harry looked over from where he was hopelessly holding out his hand to Jane. Jane was glaring at the hand in a very, very discomfiting way.
He went to the window and watched the sunrise. He watched the way the transforming sky caught on the jagged edges of the mountains, dipped into the valleys and lingered there. The way several birds swooped through the colours, like dancers on a stage. Everything was so silent.
“What’s up assholes,” Malfoy grumbled as he gingerly sat himself down on one of the logs. “I see you decided to get fucked up in our absence.”
“Relax into it,” murmured Oceania, having switched into her yoga teacher voice despite Harry being the only one there. “Don’t use your body to get into the pose, but instead use the pose to get into the body.”
Harry laughed into the table. Blaise said, very wryly, “Do you have any thoughts on spirituality that you’d like to contribute, Harry?”
Pansy continued to level him a very even look. She replied, equally deliberate, “And have you ever tried listening?”
.” He finally looked over at Harry, running his eyes up and down him derisively. “Actually, you definitely don’t know this.”
“You could room with one of us,” said Oceania, reading his mood with that creepy emotional intelligence of hers. “If you don’t like new people.”
He thought about the last conversation at the pub before he’d left. About the looks on their faces. Outside, the moon was no longer fuzzy, but a clear, strong light. He wrapped his arms around himself and tried to push it from his mind.
Draco did not live in the same place as Oceania. In fact, he didn’t even live close, which was a surprise to Harry. Instead, he led Harry horizontally straight across the cafeteria, and then right through those woods. At first, Harry thought that maybe he lived in those woods.
Get into the body. It didn’t make sense, but it seemed to interact with something instinctual inside of Harry. He almost didn’t want it to.
“When you close your eyes,” said Harry, “Pretend that I’m not here. Or that I’m not – you know, me. I’m just – a voice inside you. I’m not something else.”
He took the train in. He lived so near the city centre that it was only a few stops for him. On the train, he stared firmly out the window, feeling like everyone was watching him even though he knew they couldn’t be.
“I know how to cut my own food,” he said once Harry had leaned back, but there wasn’t any real bite to it. He piled up his fork and put it in his mouth. Harry watched him chew and swallow, waiting.
Time was a flexible thing to the subconscious. It ebbed and faded, entirely dependent on the vividness of experience, of feeling. Harry realised he didn’t know how much of it had passed. He began to notice things like the cushion on the hotel chair, the texture of the cheap wallpaper, the bathroom door hanging ajar. He watched them until they felt solid, grounding himself, and then he re-focused his attention on Malfoy.
Malfoy leans in even closer, until there are no more gaps to close. “I bet I can make you call me Draco.” She purrs. “I bet I can make you do anything.”
“No,” said Harry. Uncertainty dipped low in his chest. “Was that…was that why we used so little magic in Gay Dragon Village?”
Pansy quirked a brow. “You don’t have to be artsy to appreciate art,” she said. “In fact, anyone should be able to appreciate it. It’s one of my staple features in anybody I spend my time with.”
Even that, Harry should have handled. He had handled far more, even before becoming one of the best Aurors in the department. But some son of a bitch had managed to fling out an
“I’m so wet,” She whispers, voice low and heavy. “I’m so slick, you won’t even need your tongue, I could just ride your face after this.”
Ron blinked. He opened his mouth, and then he closed it. After a few moments of this, all he said was: “Well, how was it mate?”
He must have taken the first step in. It would have been cold. The moonlight had made everything look greyer. He must have taken the second step, too
“My name,” said Malfoy as he bent over to reach a particularly rebellious diagram, “is Draco. Which you know. Funny that, the way first names tend to humanise. Speaking of which,” He turned to face Harry, drawing himself up, and only then did Harry realise that Malfoy was very angry. “You don’t have to keep looking at me like the star of Bethlehem is shining out of my asshole. Yes, I’m a person with feelings, which are sometimes bad. It’s not a novelty. So you can fuck right off with your enlightened sympathy.”
When did it start? Draco wasn’t sure. For so long everything had been narrow-sighted – actions following each other, things he had to do – making it through the day, the month, the year, this entire fucking life – he hadn’t been able to afford to think. To think about it. About anything.
For a moment, it was like the whole world was silent. All he could feel was the blue, but it wasn’t just his blue – it was the world’s blue, it was
Draco inhales unsteadily and puts her hands behind back. “Potter,” she whispers. “Maybe you should go.”
“Oh, sure. Your friend stole your phone. God, you’d think it was like the global food shortage crisis, but instead…dick shortage.”
They were doing it at Oceania’s house, apparently. She lived down in the little valley just beyond the row of dragon pens, close to Hayden’s. As they passed, Harry suddenly noticed that all the cottages had thatched roofs, but when she caught him looking Oceania cheerfully informed they were “good for moral” and also fire-resistant.
Luna popped a spoonful of ice cream into her mouth and turned around as she sucked on it thoughtfully, leaning back against the counter.
“Stop it!” Harry shouted. It tore through him on its way out. “Just shut up, okay! Shut the hell up!”
“Wow,” said Harry, “I can’t believe he brought my hair into this. Now I’ve got to go and fuck him up.”
“The real question is,” said Hayden, “Is why on earth you would want to summon persimmons when you could have apples. Why, Osh? Why not apples?”
“Can you reach yet?” Draco grunted after about five minutes of this. Harry looked up from where he was now tangled underneath one of Oceania’s knees. The top of Oceania’s hair was about two metres away from the top of the archway.
naivety, because it was one thing to not know the world; something else, completely, to not know yourself.
Draco looked at him, and knew something was going to happen. He could feel his hands shaking. He too had gotten braver, but you could only build from the ground up.
“What poor soul are you going to use that on?” Malfoy was leaning against the counter, rummaging absentmindedly through flavoured lube.
The world was a roulette wheel – the ball was spinning. As he stepped in, everything slowed, and came firmly to a place.
There was a pause, and then Blaise burst into applause. Luna blinked her large, round eyes, and then looked a little impressed.
His head dropped back down, and the sharp sound of glee was muffled by his sleeve. When he came back up, he reached out a hand and flicked at Harry’s knee.
Harry tucked further into his shoulder. “Okay,” he said, because he didn’t know what else to say. His eyes were aching again.
There had been a question inside of him. It had arched, black and solid, against his spine, and he had thought coming home would feel like an answer.
She turned back to knitting. Harry openly stared at her, and wondered if she was high right now. It occurred to him that it was quite possible that she was always high, and that it had simply escaped his notice (which wasn’t a difficult manoeuvre).
“That was once,” Malfoy growled whilst Harry raised his brows at him. He was scowling down at the fire.
“Loving isn’t a form of giving. It’s just love. I love to love, because it’s the best thing about life. Love isn’t the same thing as taking care of someone, although there is often overlap. Love is just there. I’m not sacrificing my time or energy when I feel love for you, Harry.”
The Wong, as it turned out, was otherwise translated as The Empowerment, and was the first day of the three-day public ceremony of the festival. This meant that the sacred pills would be distributed. This meant that they had to get up early in order to be at the front of the crowd that was going to gather. This meant that Draco was tugging on reindeer socks as they were just about to leave –
But when Malfoy’s hands find their way under Harry’s shirt, rubbing against all that hot hot skin, her fingers smooth over it in reverence, like worship. Harry can’t breathe, and all of her is aching so wonderfully.
Draco was laid back on the sofa, his legs still locked around Harry’s waist. Harry sucked on his neck some more, and then pushed his jumper all the way up and licked a stripe up his stomach.
The smell of burning juniper was rich in the air. Harry breathed in deeply, as if meditating. He exhaled, slow.
“Alright, alright.” Malfoy took his wrist away and stared straight ahead. “I s’pose it’s just like…the build. And like, hands. And – shoulders and stuff.”
Harry looked at Benjamin, then at the bed he was sitting on, then finally at Malfoy. Malfoy’s hand had stilled again, and he was already smirking at Harry in the mirror.
She goes into the bedroom and pulls out the clothes she is going to wear. And then she falls back into the duvet and holds the sheets to her face, clutches them between her fingertips. Breathes in, beathes out. Closes her eyes.
“Oh,” said Harry. He moved out the way as Oceania reached to open the fridge. His heart was thundering. He swallowed. “Yes. Please.”
“Is that so?” Malfoy’s index finger slowed in its pace. It drew a semi-circle out from his middle finger, sweeping over the black space. “I don’t recall you being fond of astrology in school.”
Jane’s wings were fanned out besides them. She was so beautiful up here, with the sunlight hitting off her turquoise scales, looking gloriously harmonised with the world. Harry felt the peace in her, then took some of his own and reflected it back. She relaxed further.
Finding the remains of his strength, Harry wondered over the ridge of the mountain until he came to the next training space. As he rounded the corner, he could hear someone telling off their dragon.
“This is so fucking unfair,” Harry was saying now, stomping about and being generally sexy and surly. “It’s
“I thought…” he began slowly, clearly mulling things over. “I thought that would be something you’d like. I clean up nice, you know.”
And Harry’s here now, lying between Draco’s legs, her back pressed against her front, reading a book as Draco eats an apple over her shoulder. They’re both half-dressed – a bra here, shirt there, probably a thong thrown in the mix somewhere – and Draco has to leave for work soon. Harry’s spent the night more and more after she broke up with Ginny, and Draco – Draco still goes hard, of course, but sometimes, she goes soft too, now.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment longer, and then glanced away, tugging at the edges of his jacket. “Okay,” he said, “I’ll – I’ll have to change.”
“With an excess of Vaseline and blind faith,” he muttered, pushing off the sink. “Come here.” He kneeled in front of Harry and sat the bag on the floor beside them. Harry pushed his hand through his hair.
As he slid the lock shut a little more forcefully than necessary, he heard Malfoy say, “You know, you didn’t have to do that. I already filled our daily terrorising-the-straights quota.”
Malfoy ordered another round. He waited before they’d all downed that one too, before saying: “Okay. It’s time for truth or dare.”
Harry was searching for garnish. It wasn’t really important, except it probably was to Malfoy, who looked and lived like his life’s purpose to swirl around in an oversized cocktail glass.
It’s a dry morning when Harry Potter makes her way down the path of stone slabs leading to Draco Malfoy’s cottage. Draco’s just pulled out her favourite cup when there’s a set of knocks on the door.
“Well, that’s sorted.” Hayden leaned back and stretched. “Don’t argue with her. She’ll start telling you uncomfortable truths about yourself.”
Draco wasn’t laughing. The quiet drew out; but it was practically orchestral, it was so bucolic. Harry let his eyes drift shut again.
“There you are,” Charlie said, grinning and giving a thumbs-up to the smiling monk. “Making friends with the locals already are you?”
The last place they visit is Notre Dame. The white walls rise out of the ground is geometric grandeur, and they wander through the hushed silence and glowing multi-colour patterns that float down onto the cold stone.
“Hey sugertits,” said Oceania once she’d spotted Draco. She grinned and held up a sandwich. “Want one?”
“Okay.” Harry smiled. The wind tumbled over the tufts of his ridiculous, wonderful hair. Draco could tell where his eyes would crinkle when he got older.
The lounge was a different colour scheme. Where the kitchen had been all dark, but earthy colours, here everything was bluish tones. Not dark blue. Draco had an entire sofa that was the colour of the sky.
the wetness and slide and heat – Harry grips her thighs hard enough to bruise – and pulls her in, and groans, her voice strangled –
Harry rolled over further, until he was on his belly. He blinked up at her, a little stupidly, but mostly content. “Osh,” he said. “Do you ever get the feeling that Draco is flirting with me?”
a temple. It had green, curved tiles and scarlet columns, with gold button-like structures at the bottom. There were two sets of lion statues, in the traditional East Asian style. Harry did notice a smaller jade statue of a dragon, though.
Malfoy’s entire face went bright red. Harry watched, fascinated as he tried to pretend it wasn’t happening.
Harry lifted the thermos flask filled with the soup Charlie had made earlier and handed it to Malfoy. They laid in silence for a moment as Malfoy tried to figure out how to drink it upside down.
The dances had begun with cymbals. The masked dancers walked around and generally made a huge racket, which Harry secretly loved. So many religions he had encountered up to this point seemed to be about quietness and tidiness to him. This felt like a real celebration.
As he pushed up off the counter with one hand and took a few steps back, not enough to submerge himself in the crowd, but enough to become part of it, Harry thought that was debatable. He smiled at Harry as he moved back, and it was an easy smile, loose and amused. As Harry watched, he began to dance.
He had said it very quietly. Harry found himself wishing he wasn’t drunk anymore. Conversations like this were supposed to be carefully navigated. But Harry already hated being careful, anyway.
He didn’t know what he had expected to happen now he had come back. The blue inside him was thriving, already being so familiar with its surroundings. Surely, it hadn’t been so bad when he was away?
“Have you heard from him lately?” asked Ginny. They had found themselves wandering the exhibit on their own, others having departed for drinks or to say hello to other people. Dean elbowing Seamus, whose head was thrown back in laughter.
Harry turned back around. “Why are you acting like this?” he said, looking at Malfoy. This close, he could tell that Malfoy was wearing makeup.
She smashes Harry’s head into the wall again, and Harry accidentally bites her tongue, causing her to cry out in pain. Draco leans in very close. Harry can feel her breath, feel her breathing, all over her, inside her, within. Harry can only feel, feel until thought is worth nothing.
“Potter.” She says, running her fingertip over the salted rim of the glass nonchalantly. “Pleasant surprise.” Her voice is still that long, grating drawl.
He got changed. There were clothes here that he had left behind, and they all smelled of dust. He shook out an old blue jumper and put it on.
He’d thought about these words for a long time before saying them. He practiced it at all. Now, he saw the way Harry’s face changed, the way he stopped.
“Malfoy,” he said, and heard Malfoy shift his head on the grass next to him. “How did you know you were gay?”
Pansy adjusted her plunging neckline and looked drily at him. “How well do you know Draco?” she asked as they walked into the museum. It was the kind of exhibition that apparently required dim golden lighting and large potted plants. It was busier than Harry had expected.
“Luna has to get back,” Blaise announced. He nodded towards her, grinning shrewdly. “She has tea to attend to.”
And then this sort of became his life. Without quite deciding to or realising it, Harry settled back down into a routine – and between yoga and lunches and people and gardening and afternoon walks and sleeping – Harry found himself endlessly distracted. He wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or not. Maybe this was what life was. Maybe this was the point of it.
Then the class resumed. Just like that. The only difference was that the girl kept glancing behind at Harry to make sure he was keeping up. He absolutely wasn’t, but she didn’t seem to mind.
Tom made another considering noise. Another few moments passed where he just rotated the beads. This wasn’t unusual. Harry watched at where the incense had burnt down to a few short inches in places.
Harry paused to look at her differently. He hadn’t thought of someone like Luna Lovegood as having many thoughts about someone like Draco Malfoy, but then he remembered that she had been in his dungeons during the war, and even though something twisted sharply in his gut, things made a peculiar amount of sense.
There was nothing to argue there. Bowling had always sounded pretty dull to him as a child, but he had seen this lot turn eating lunch into a sport, so he was prepared for quite a few outcomes, all of which were weird and magical and mildly uncomfortable.
“What does it mean?” Harry asked. He had the feeling that he was watching his life through a screen, or maybe a pensieve, and that this conversation had already happened, or was always going to happen, or was always happening.
They sat in silence for a few moments, marinating in their own bowling deficiencies and sipping on the soft drinks. The bowling alley was nice, slightly run-down, and now mostly empty, an upshot of having spent the last hour here. There were strips of neon lights decorating the ceiling, which Harry supposed made the excitement of rolling a ball down the length of a corridor until it hit something even more exhilarating.
Malfoy was still trying to smother his giggling behind one hand. When he finally reached composure, he looked over at Jane and locked eyes with her.
“Why does everyone think I’m a caveman?” Harry shook his fringe down over his head, an anxious habit from childhood. “Look, it’s not like that.”
He looked back up. Draco was looking at him, and the light was hitting his eyes in a way that made them seem liquid, easy. There was a hesitation there – or a question, or something that was being held back – but was ready to be offered, all the same. The light was in his eyes. The light was in Harry’s body.
He really did have things to do. Down in the cafeteria, the chairs and tables had been replaced – although they were all entirely pink now, for no conceivable reason – but there was nobody there eating. Nobody on the grass either. It was fluttering softly in the wind, spread out and green, as if nobody had ever sat there.
And so, although perhaps it seemed nonsensical to be afraid of Jane when he had faced Voldemort, when he had faced death itself, when he had
“I don’t think…” said Malfoy, and broke off. He glanced around the room, frowning earnestly like there were answers hidden behind the cabinets and inside the fridge, and then glanced back to Harry. Harry was sure there weren’t any answers hidden inside of him.
He turned back to Malfoy who still standing there, fiddling with his too-long sleeves. It turned out he was wearing a light blue jumper under the jacket, which was surprisingly plain. If Harry wasn’t so tired, he might have commented on it.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Draco. He was bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. “Your brain couldn’t come up with half of this shit.”
“Oh, has she fallen asleep?” asked Malfoy. He stood up and stretched before walking over to them, bundling her into his arms. “Best get her back before the sleep-talking begins.”
He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione this. He had just said he liked the exercise, and then gone running.
Harry nodded. He took in a breath, and stopped running. Jane was right there. The blue rose, crashing into him, and it was the biggest thing he’d ever felt.
They came to a bit of a clearing, and then when Harry looked up, Jane was standing above him. She looked tall and arrogant and only slightly put out. She tilted her head to Harry, her eyes flashing.
Oceania slung an arm around his shoulders. “What are you guys talking about?” She wrinkled her nose as Hayden tapped her nose with the chopsticks.
“Ah,” said Draco. He took a sip of his tea, even though his must be cold too. “I suppose you’ll want to stay over then.”
“It’s...” he said, and had to take a breath. “It’s just, um, hard to explain. It’s just…it’s the…I think of it as the blue.”
“Urm,” said Harry. “Alright.” He then abruptly remembered that this was the place where he was supposed to actually open up about his feelings. “Urm…”
“I’m not sure,” said Harry. “I think I’m having a bit of an identity crisis, maybe. Other than that, all fine.”
“If I was going to lie about my job,” said Pansy neatly. “I would not declare myself a fucking journalist.”
Harry inhaled. His skin felt hot. He pressed his cheek against the cold glass of the window, and felt that he could live in this moment forever.
“Hey,” said Harry, a bit breathless from surprise. Hayden raised a brow at him and reached past him to grab a pair of chopsticks. Malfoy frowned.
A tentative hand reached out. Harry felt the knobs of Draco’s spine – up and down and up – through the silk.
Draco blinked his eyes open wide when he opened his door. “Harry,” he said carefully, once he’d steadied himself. “What are you doing here?”
“But you better tell us a little louder while you’re at it,” said Malfoy, “Otherwise we might get the wrong idea. Might assume you’re a depraved queer. Like us.”
Malfoy grinned and leaned back on his hands, fingers threading through the green. “She’s brilliant. Really good. I wish that I was –”
After a good couple minutes, Draco decides to close the door and Potter looks back at her. It seems to take her a second to focus on Draco, and then she looks over the rest of her, her lean frame, her muggle clothes.
“You couldn’t lower yourself even if you tried!” Malfoy shouted after them. “Blue cheese doesn’t provide enough nutrition for digging!”
He closed his eyes. The water lapped up over his hipbones. It was so cold that it felt like something more than pain – an ache that pressed in up at him like a second skin, like another organ. The moonlight beat down against his lids, and he imagined it unpeeling him, undoing all the things he had done.
He sounded so righteous and confused that it made him sound a little bit like he was twelve. He had been horrible when he was actually twelve, so Harry didn’t know why he was getting the urge to smile in a way that was probably quite similar to the sunflower they had collaborated on on Oceania’s ceiling.
Harry nodded again, but he was already leaving. His body was taking him out of the treeline and up the track. He didn’t stop at the cafeteria. He didn’t stop at the yoga mountain. He went to the Green Hotel, and went up to his room.
“See,” said Harry. “I don’t think that that’s going to happen. I don’t think that’s a good idea at all.”
“It’s like… It’s like...if you go to a crowd, right? And most people you see are in, like, jeans and a t-shirt. And they’re all just a mass of neutral colours. And maybe most of those people are wearing jeans and t-shirts ‘cause they actually just really like wearing them. But also, maybe most of them are also just a bit too scared to wear anything else. Like, fuck, a tutu. Because they need to blend in with the crowd. And you know, that’s fine but like… It’s also not real, you know? It’s a veneer.”
When he’d finished showering, it was almost dawn. He came back out and looked at his suitcase again.
“Oh,” said Draco, not looking even slightly put out. “I think the authors might’ve been sisters, you know.”
“It’s okay to want to pound into someone like they’re worthless to you, to want to give it like he gave it, to have someone moan like a bitch in heat. That’s all I am to you, isn’t it? A dirty, Death Eater little slut with tits, a bitch, a quick, filthy fuck so you can give it like your boyfriend never could, like you knew he wanted to-”
His legs were heavy as he climbed. When he got to his room, he stood still for a moment, staring at the pile of dirty clothes on his chair. The sun still hadn’t fully set.
“This is really the socialising part of the camp,” he explained, “Most people eat here, and it gives the place a bit of a community feel. Just behind –” He gestured to the row of run-down buildings just behind the long tables. “–are the shops. Basic stuff. They bring it up from the village.”
Draco laughed and tipped his head back. Once he’d stopped he pulled out a bouquet of wildflowers from behind his back.
She did what she had to do. She survived the war. She survived the trials. She survived it when they came for father, and she survived it when mother left, and she made a life for herself, she made a comfortable, easy, simple life.
“Surely I, of all people, would have been the most inhibited to that fact.” He couldn’t help leaning forward.
Draco looked at him. “I think,” he said after a moment. “That you’re just trying to stop feeling…bad. And I understand that. But... I think you should know that you don’t outrun these sorts of things. There is never any escape. Not ever. The only way out is in.”
idea, it’s not like the sound of astringent laughter isn’t perfectly soothing to the defenceless soul –”
“Where’s Oceania anyway?” Harry asked. She had been suspiciously absent all day. He had saved her one of the cookies.
“You have time,” she told him. “You can take your time. To just think. But…I would just say, make sure you choose things for the right reasons. That’s all, Harry.”
Harry was lying on the floor in his hotel. Everything was very quiet. He lied there, staring at the mould in the corner of the ceiling.
They’d set up a pole for him outside, and Oceania was taping balloons to the chairs. Blessedly, there was no one else from the camp around.
The whole situation is located at the remote end of a remote village on the Scottish island of Raasay. Less than two hundred people live here. There is grass, and sea, and plenty of sheep.
Malfoy had stopped as well. He had been looking at a point over Harry’s ear, but now he was looking at Harry, his face clean of any malice. He looked
“Well, aren’t you just strapping,” she said. “I’m really glad you went for black instead of pink now. It really gives you more of a dominatrix feel.”
“That’s not going to work,” said Draco, but immediately fell back into kissing Harry, rocking against him and letting him continue squeezing him. It was too much – it wasn’t enough. Harry was so turned on he might just die.
“It looks like you’re gardening.” says Potter, a grin curling up in the side of her lips. “It sounds like you’re gardening.”
“No,” Harry said immediately. “No, I – it’s just. It’s good to hear your voice. I – how’s the new dragon? How’s Jane? How’s Mayo?”
He looked back. His eyes were red-rimmed too. Harry had the sudden vision of Malfoy crumpling over, sobbing while this time Harry held him instead, pressing kisses to his neck and clinging to him through it. Then Malfoy inhaled sharply, nostrils flaring, and the vision disappeared. His gaze skittered off the length of Harry and back to his face. Harry wished, out of all the expressions he could have known how to interpret, that it hadn’t been this one.
“I’ve never come before either,” said Harry. Malfoy turned to look at him, his neck moving sharply. His gaze caught on Harry’s face, before slipping down slowly.
He turned, digging into his leather satchel. Jane watched him beadily, making the occasional clucking noise.
They had been in a warehouse, tracking down an especially nasty strand of potions that had effects dubiously close to the imperious curse when ingested, when there had been some of a kafuffle outside. Harry had gone. He should have been able to deal with it – there were only two of them after all – lower rankings in the illicit chain, who the department had believed to be on a different rotation. As it so happened, as they later found out, there had been an extra precautionary spell in place – body heat sensor, incredibly technical, likely installed by a senior – and the long and short of it was that the two brutes had decided
“Merlin, it’s a good thing you came to us,” said Oceania. “Learning your sexuality is like doing yoga. You have to understand your body before you can unleash its power.”
“You said she was good,” Harry offered, because he was still curious about the peculiar tenderness between the two of them.
He could hear Malfoy breathing. How could he hear him breathing? A lock of white hair fell into Malfoy’s face. His head was bowed.
He looked down again. Her eyes were open, and they were dark, but it was a good kind of dark. A dark that grounded you.
again, but even he knew what little good that did either of them. Draco was just sitting there, on the other, drinking firewhiskey and loving him. Trying to understand it was like trying to understand the size of space, or how magic worked, or why he’d grown up in a closet.
It was the third time now, but Harry’s body still felt stiff. Granted, it wasn’t as bad as the first time, but it sure as hell didn’t feel like Harry’s body had “opened up” or whatever the fuck it was that Oceania had told him would happen. He gritted his teeth and tried to breathe through it.
“This isn’t exactly scraggly undergrowth,” said Harry, once they’d arrived. He was standing in front of a set of logs that had been sliced in half to make benches, all arranged around a black circle which was clearly the fire place. Oceania was already there.
“That’s alright babyface,” said Draco, leaning back against one of the counters. “I already ate. But I got you flowers.”
“Malfoy,” says Harry, frowning over at her ex-enemy. They’re in a pub – the Elf’s Ears – and Malfoy draws her body across the bar to sip her cocktail. She curves her slender back with the clear intent of showing off her figure in that way she does, and when she makes eye contact with Harry, her face is carefully blank.
She was standing stock still in the middle of the arrivals flow, her humongous hair rising up above the movement and airport sounds like a black tower. When she saw Harry she beamed, and leaving her suitcase behind, came at him with a running start. Harry laughed as she approached, and then gasped as her arms swung around his neck violently.
He brought his arms to the sky, and into prayer position over his heart. The sun had risen, and it was right there, balancing on the line of the horizon like an orange yoyo teetering on its string.
Then he went mad with reading. All of Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice on its own, at least four times (although he could never decide which of them was Darcy and which one Lizzie). A godforsaken amount of poetry. Sonnets, especially, until he decided the feeling was more lyrical. A lot of Walt Whitman (Merlin, the
“It would be really helpful if you could tell me anything about him,” Potter continues, leaning forward, her eyes glistening as green as newly unfurled leaves. “If you could tell me anything at all.”
The brimming got worse. It solidified into a desire, an urge, a need so great he couldn’t ignore it. He was mad with wanting. He was mad with staying.
Higher they went. They passed more clouds, and then the mountains were wrapped around them. Harry had half-thought to himself, standing at his hotel room window and staring out with a desperation so furtive it was almost tangible, that realistically they would be less beautiful up close – that they were only beautiful because they enhanced by longing and imagination.
Draco Malfoy kneeled down beside the bed, his hand still in Harry’s. The back of his hand was against his chest, and through his bones Draco could feel his heartbeat, like this:
“Tell me,” says Harry, leaning forward and lowering her chin theatrically onto her fist. “Do you know anything about a Kumbukani Laska?”
“HARRYYY” roared Borris Tolson, his voice accompanied by the daunting sound of approaching footsteps.
Tom raised a brow, just a little, and Harry felt like a child that had been caught trying to steal a cookie.
The real sweet to the bitter was that Draco had had a happy childhood, he supposed. He glanced up at Harry’s face from under his lashes.
Harry opened his eyes. He blinked, both against the sudden harshness of the bright bathroom and at the unfamiliar sensation of weight atop his eyelids. Malfoy sat back, and when Harry’s eyes adjusted, Harry saw there was something surprised about his expression as well.
“Who are you to talk?” Harry snarled back. Sharp, present, cruel. “As if you’re some beacon of wisdom or purity or whatever. As if you’ve never run away. Have you forgotten who you are
“I thought you were a dominatrix,” he said, mostly to distract Malfoy. He pressed his eye to the viewfinder.
“Cheers to that,” said Hayden, raising their bottle, and Tom echoed the movement. Harry suddenly, deliriously, felt the desperate urge to laugh. He took a long swig of his own beer.
“I can’t look at you,” he announced once he was done. “All this time, I believed that you…I thought you’d
Harry snakes a hand down to play with her clit, and Malfoy just about snaps in half. She moans loudly, voice breaking in that perfect way it does whenever she climaxes, and Harry grunts, riding it out.
“Jane’s depression. Failure to communicate. All that. Like, the connection helped, but I don’t think it was what she needed.”
Harry’s hand came up to rub his back, slowly, slowly. It was warm through his shirt, and Harry turned his head then so he could nose at Draco’s neck, making soft hushing sounds. Draco’s face was red through his skin. He didn’t understand how Harry could be so easy about this, like it was obvious, like it could go unquestioned.
“What?” Harry huffed and looked up at the ceiling of winding branches tattooed across the blue. “I’m the easiest to understand.”
Luna just nodded and tilted her head back, looking at the sky. The sunlight filtered across her face. “I think it would be very nice,” she said, “if we were all friends.”
Harry looked at him. Or her. Hayden had a way of making every conversation into something of a philosophical discussion, and Harry wasn’t sure if he liked it or not.
Harry made himself take a few steps back. He picked up the camera and fiddled with the settings until he’d had a moment to collect himself. He aimed.
“Okay,” he said, once he was all souped-up. “Rules. Regrets. Vodka-induced conversations. Let’s get processing.”
“I…” he managed again, and then it all came tumbling out like the words had there along. “Draco, I...”
He met Harry’s gaze and then his mouth turned up again, not quite a smile, but not quite a smirk either.
Malfoy’s eyes stopped fluttering and were yanked back to meet Harry’s. It had been a harsh thing to say; Harry could see it in the wideness of Malfoy’s deadly sober eyes, the clenched tendon in his jaw. It had been a harsh thing to say – but Malfoy had said a similar thing to him earlier.
Maybe it was ridiculous – but the times he had done yoga so far helped him feel good. Although it was all physical, he thought that if he started with his body, it might be easier to deal with his mind.
“You don’t change that much without…sacrifice. And Draco, he’s – well, I think he’s sacrificed quite a lot Harry. To be who he is right now.”
Harry frowned deeper. “You – you don’t even know half of it.” His voice was getting louder. Malfoy was still just sitting there.
“Whiskey it is,” he said, sounding only a little amused, and then left the increasingly tense table.
When he got there, he found Malfoy asleep on the sofa. His form was pale, and curled up small. He seemed the most breakable thing in the room.
He was grinning. Along with the letter were several polaroid photos of Jane from varying distances. There was also a photo of Oceania sticking her tongue out with a pan in her hand filled with what looked like scrambled eggs in it. There were also a few shots of the landscape. One of Charlie with a strained expression as he looked up at what Harry assumed to be the new dragon.
Harry swallowed. There were actually two plants in the office he noticed; one small succulent was sitting in a tiny pot on the grey cabinets stacked just behind Gao’s desk.
“Well,” said Luna. “Smaller is better than bigger. You don’t have to shrink it all at once. You could do it in bits.”
Well, there was really nothing that could be said to that. Harry stared at her, his cheeks flaming. He felt acutely aware of Luna and Blaise looking on.
“I didn’t know you were a big sushi fan,” she said conversationally, once their waiter had left them with their boards.
“I’m proud of you too,” said Draco, later in the evening. It was just the two of them still sitting around the fire really. The other three were busy under the guise of finding more sticks for marshmallow roasting, although it seemed more to Harry that they were having goes giving each other piggy backs and attempting to very loudly name the various trees they passed.
When they came back ways up Harry put the thought of gentle flying towards Jane, phrasing it as a question. She did three more twirls before inclining her neck under Harry’s palm and straightening up. Suddenly the world shuddered back to rightness, and they were drifting horizontally along.
“You have to forgive yourself you know.” Malfoy lifted his head from where he’d been fiddling with his fingers, pressing the knuckles together. “You have to – you have to
Now Luna looked at him. For a moment, Harry thought she was going to say something else. But then she smiled. One of her front teeth was slightly wonky. Harry had never noticed before.
As Malfoy talked, he loosened. It was always like that. It was as if he was discovering each new thought as he spoke, and following it along its line. Harry, for all his grousing, thought it was kind of neat to watch.
At this rate, Harry might actually cry, and then there would be no escaping the multiplicity of the tea cosy.
“Right,” said Malfoy. He breathed in again. Harry watched, and realised, with a shock, that the strange expression was anger.
Malfoy pulled out a wide flat box instead and flipped open the lid. Inside were rows of coloured circles. Malfoy reached dipped his middle finger into the lightest one, that glittered a shade of orange-white when the light hit it right, and rubbed it back and forth. When he pulled back, his finger was covered in it. He reached for Harry, and then hesitated.
He made it past the cafeteria, but it was too much after that. He crouched down, hands on his knees, and tried to focus on one spot on the ground in front of him. He could hear the sounds of the dragons, sleeping a few metres away.
“Well,” said Charlie. “You know some people get, like, diseases in their brain? It’s a bit like that. Even with dragons. People sometimes forget that they get sad too.”
“See next time,” said Harry, "can we all just buy sandwiches? I like sandwiches. I like the way they keep my vision stable.”
They came back into warrior three, high lunge, and then warrior two. Down into wide-legged forward fold. Harry felt the world tip accordingly, and let it.
“That’s right,” Malfoy had said, nodding. “It gives his dragon the chance to go and have a smoke with the other dragons. Catch up on all the goss. Complain about the clingy parents behind their backs.”
Harry had learned, so far, that Draco Malfoy was not as bad as he thought he was. That he had saved, or attempted, to save his life three times and only succeeded once. That his hair is slightly wavy but he used a lot of hair products to make it straight as his father liked. That he used to smoke because he learned in muggle bars that it could kill you but stopped once he started to cough during quidditch matches Ron, Ginny, Draco and he has. That his blue eyes looked grey when he was sad and that he cries so much. He also learned he has a sweet-tooth and despises coffee. He loves the way his hands look while making potions and he loves how he bites his underlip when he's concentrated. And he absolutely loves how he is now shorter than Harry because that way Harry can always give him forehead kisses in an attempt of erasing his worries.
Hermione loved studying with Draco, she says that the boy is brilliant, she loved learning new things the boy knew and she was actually surprised he was willing to spill ‘pureblood’ secrets with her, she started to learn that dark arts were so interesting and fascinating from a study point of few.
Once there, he heard soft sobs and sighed, at least he found him, he sent a patronus so that Blaise could be calm and entered the room. The sight wasn't pretty, there was blood in both of Draco's arms and his face was full of tears, Myrtle was next to him trying to calm him down, but failing horribly at it.
“You know its okay to move on, right? You can’t change what happened but you can have a say in what will happen next,” Pansy says once Draco finish outing his concerns. “And honestly, I know Potter and he has 0 clues in how to make plans so don’t be scared of him faking this whole thing out just to hurt you, I’ve watched you two and when you’re together you seem so happy Draco, so fucking happy that I’m kinda jealous that I can’t be the one that makes you feel that way like I did once.”
Harry doesn’t know how long he was there, but judging by his cold nose and freezing feet he figures it must have been more than an hour, he had miss diner but it was okay, he could just sneak into the kitchen for some quick meal. THE KITCHENS! Draco loved sweet things, and the chocolate parfait the blond love was only served on Christmas.
"Where did you get this? Is it even safe?" Draco arched an eyebrow looking suspiciously at the bike and Harry smile
"Honestly, Hermione could do a better job explaining this, but basically inside of us there are cells that have DNA and the DNA has genes that when they express they give us certain characteristics such as eye colour or certain sickness," explained Harry while knotting his tie.
After a couple of minutes Draco started to feel like a creep and got up from his bed, there were a lot of questions running in his mind and he needed answers from a lot of people before accepting the fact that someone, especially Harry, could love him in that kind of way.
"Dance with me?" he heard his husband ask and the blond just raised an eyebrow but took the hand he was being offered anyways.
“Stop that” was the first thing Harry said, he could deal with the panic after the boy stopped hurting himself “Malfoy, listen to me, I need you to stop doing that,” but it was like he wasn’t even there, the blonds respiration got quicker and he was shaking so much but still digging his nails so hard that warm blood started to come out from it.
Harry tightened his grip when he started to see where this story was going, still hoping the was a happy ending to it, but knowing how unfair the world was he started to prepare for the worst because he remembers the handprint-like bruise in Draco’s wrist, and once again his stomach is tied in a knot, but he tries to not show any sign of being uncomfortable because in this vulnerable state Draco would think the reason behind his uncomfortableness was because he thought of him as something dirty and not because he wanted to kill Theodore Not.
“Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plans. Harry, my boy, I've been beginning to worry. You brought someone with us, I see.” Spoke Slughorn once he noticed the two boys at the door.
"Please don't step on me, I want to be able to kick your ass tomorrow at the quidditch match," Draco joked and Harry just laughed, Harry had gone through many classes to learn how to dance to don't make a fool of himself at their wedding, at least some of that knowledge stick around and now he was decent at it.
"Maybe, but a very pretty one at least" they both laughed at it and Draco turned around and kissed Harry on the lips.
“Because if he has a mission then that little encounter at Borgin and Burkes would make more sense, don’t you agree?”
“Is there any chocolate cauldrons?” He asked after thinking it for a bit and Harry nodded handing him one, the blonde took it and, even though Harry knew he was trying to hide it, Malfoy’s hands were shaking too much to be passed as nervousness failing at opening the box. Harry took another box opening it and taking two before handing it to him.
The only times he felt like himself, whatever that was anyways, was when he was with Harry. And that scared him deeply because he was getting so used to the other boy's company that when the school year was over he knew it would be the end of his friendship as well. And that were the times when he started to wonder how it would feel to be someone else. What if he wouldn't have been a git back then when he first met Harry, what if he didn't insult Ron that day? What if he had never called Hermione a mudblood? What if he never treated Theo like a burden rather than a friend? What if he didn't have played with Pansy's feelings and never slept with Blaise out of spite of her leaving him alone when he needed her the most? Would he have been friends with the Golden Trio? Had he been a Slytherin at all? Would Theo treat him differently? Would he have received the dark mark still? He could've accepted Dumbeldore's help that night, he could've just forgotten about his parents the way his father did, but his mother didn't deserve that, even if now she was doing what she believed was best, she deserved so much more.
“The rooms are already distributed and no, there are no changes, so I hope you sleep well and once again, welcome home” with that McGonagall leaves the room and the others start to move around exploring the place and so.
“I mean, yeah, both, but also I find it really weird that I get to make a decision and then expect a good result out of it, like I can talk with Hermione and not expect a punch in the face or how I can kiss you and not get hexed in the spot."
"Sorry, just... need to get used to seeing Clouds without fearing the worst, a force of habit I guess." His boyfriend smiled and then looked at the small package Draco had in his hands. "What do you have there? Is it for me?" Harry asked excited, it reminded him of Teddy and his heart fluttered at it.
Draco loved how Harry kept making memorable moments for the two of them, and how he always carried the old camera Andy gave him, so Draco started to take photos of everything he loved and the number of photos of Harry that he had was actually embarrassing. Draco knew Harry like to steal cute photographs of them but he never said anything.
“He received a letter from his mother this morning, and then he had an argument with Nott, so I don’t know what you know or what you’ve heard but I do know that you’ve always managed to find him so please, find him,” he said with a stern voice and continued to comfort Pansy saying that everything was going to be alright.
And of course, Harry knew that the mark had nothing to do with Draco, but then again he spent the last 9 years hating him so he needed reassurance that testifying had been the right choice. But when he asked Luna her reasons to testify in his favour she just gave him one of her loopy smiles and shrugged saying that they were not the only ones who had survived a war. Fred told him that Draco saved his life by recasting the unforgivable to the one who had cast it. And Ginny said that he was always trying to protect the little ones and never told anyone where they were hiding even though he totally knew.
Fred and George's shop grew a lot, they have opened several smaller shops all over Europe, and honestly, Draco is proud of them... not that he tells them often, but he bets they know. Ginny Weasly ended up being the best players the Holyhead Harpies had seen for a while, Molly kept bothering her about marriage and all that stuff but Luna and she decided that they'll do that when it feels right and not when it's expected, and Draco didn't understand that until it took Harry 2 fucking years to propose.
year were everything went downhill and there was nothing I could’ve done to help you except keep up with the act of hating you and everyone who wasn't a true pureblood, obviously blood traitors didn't count” Draco finished with a dry laugh and hugged himself, either trying to warm up a little or to comfort himself.
"What? The fact that you are dating the saviour of the world or that you manage to be friends with Ginny Weasley?” joked Harry while finishing the braid, and wondering whether he could put some daisies there without Draco noticing.
"Fine, you can come in," replied Draco as he sat Indian style on the bed, "but only because you brought peace offerings," that made Harry laughed but he still sat next to Draco offering him the small box.
Do you ever feel so alone that the smallest gestures of kindness make you feel so worthy yet so afraid? How someone who has suffered so much can be so kind? It doesn't make sense, nothing makes sense anymore. The fact that the great Harry Potter is so keen on helping Draco makes no sense, why would he do that? No matter how many times the black-haired boy assures Draco that he's not playing some kind of sick joke it is still the only explanation the blond finds, because among his people kindness is not something to take for granted, he had made that mistake before.
"Don't play with fire, you already know how bad it burns," and that sent shivers down his spine, but tried to shake it off
In the end, they woke up again at midday, both too hungry to continue sleeping. The day before they had watched the entire first season of British Bake Off and today they decided they were going to try and make the greatest dessert ever, to be honest, Draco just hoped for them to be better than the person who made those awful meringues.
"I can't stay, I was just passing by to check mom, I have other plans," Draco wanted to leave, and if he was going to be punished for it he could at least give Lucius a reason to do it.
Whatever, it’s not like a book is going to make him better at potions, if Snape with his fear-induced type of teaching or Hermione’s detailed lessons couldn’t then nothing could at this point.
“Because I wouldn’t say no to you, never, I love you so fucking much I feel like I’m dying and I don’t want that to be a reason for you to stay with me when you no longer feel like that, I don’t want to hold you down, you deserve nothing but happiness and I’m afraid I won’t be able to make you happy and-“
The bone cracking kind of pain began again, only this time he felt as he was on fire, so much pain in so many places, he was sure he was screaming as loud as never before. He wanted to be safe, to this to stop, he couldn't concentrate in anything but how Harry's arms felt around him and how much his patronus shined in the darkness Draco's thoughts created.
