Once out on the street, he pointed himself toward the Beachwood, hoping Harry was there as promised. He tossed the manuscript in the nearest bin and cast a quick incendio.
“Don’t apologize to me. He was worried, and Ginny said Potter hadn’t heard from you either.”
he thought. 10 o’clock had long since passed and he wondered if Harry had gone to the Beachwood to see Draco.
Draco opened it. Inside was a small, silver band. A feather was etched on the inside.
As the officiant started reciting the vows for Theo and Pansy to repeat back, Draco’s eyes found Harry in the pews. Their eyes stayed locked on each other for the remainder of the ceremony.
“Do you still play?” Harry asked.
“Uhh, the kettle…” Draco said, gesturing towards the stove.
“Draco, that’s brilliant!” Harry and George Weasley had just recently made a deal together to start a new Quidditch gear and broomstick line at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes that Harry was to endorse.
“Hmm,” Draco answered. Somewhere in the back of his sleepy mind he remembered telling himself not to do that anymore.
“Come to the Beachwood when you’re done. I’ll wait for you, and then we can celebrate,” Harry kissed Draco and straightened his tie for him.
“But?” Draco quirked an eyebrow.
"Maybe," Draco answered. He took another long sip of his hot chocolate. It was close to when Harry usually picked up his things and left. "I used to write songs."
There's so much about this chapter that just makes me happy. I wanted to give y'all more of an ending to the story. I love that so many of you are loving how light and fun this story has been, and I hope it continues to bring a little bit of light to your heart.
“Some what?” Harry asked.
Harry’s arms came from behind and wrapped over his shoulders, and he kissed the top of Draco’s head. “You bought a bench,” he noted.
“Draco, darling, what’s wrong?” Pansy asked quietly so that the other’s wouldn’t hear.
9:55. He apparated to Diagon Alley and made his way toward the Beachwood.
. The idea of Draco Malfoy singing Lizzo just cracks me up.
“Come off it, Potter, you have no idea how to take a normal picture,” Draco sipped his hot chocolate and took the Business section from Harry.  “Besides, we all know you do it on purpose.”
Harry was still standing in the doorway to the kitchen when Draco finished. He took his tea with a mumbled ‘thanks’ and turned towards the morning room.
Harry started to pack up his things, smiling and telling Draco he’d see him tomorrow.
and the new Potions professor at Hogwarts!” Olivia Davies waved Draco onto the little stage they’d put in the store.
Harry holds Draco’s eyes for a moment, then smiles and turns back to his friends. “I hope you all can accept that.”
He didn’t see anything. They apparated to Draco’s.
He grabbed it and started skimming.
“Well, for starters, do you always have to wear a suit everywhere you go, Draco?” Harry asked, gesturing at Draco’s tailored grey suit.
Draco took it, looking at her questioningly.
He and Harry had been together for about 10 months, officially. They’d been seeing each other much longer than that. And Draco loved Harry, he did. But marriage? Was that really the next step? They hadn’t really talked about it, both seeming content to live their life together for now.
“What are you thinking about, Harry?” Draco asked, throwing Harry’s own question back.
Draco sat back in his chair and sipped on his hot chocolate, watching Harry as he talked to the barista. He was absentmindedly humming, watching the smile light up Harry’s face as he spoke. The barista was handing Harry a sample of something, which he ate happily.
“No. No, thank you, Harry. But no. I want to do this myself. If they don’t want to publish something because a Malfoy has written it, then so be it.”
“Very funny. I was shopping for furniture for the flat, and the old bag that runs Faun’s Fantastic Furnishings kept asking me so many questions. Do I like Queen Anne or Mid Century Modern, would I prefer walnut or English oak, would I be needing a pair of fauteuils for the morning room…” Draco took a long sip of his hot chocolate then sighed.
He knew there was a muggle shop around the corner and figured they’d have something. He fumbled through a drawer in his office that had some muggle money he’d converted from galleons just in case.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right,” he said.
Draco opened the letter.
Finally, Hermione approached the table and cleared her throat. The others made their way behind her, looming over their little table in the corner.
This is it y'all. Thank you for sticking with this story, I love each of you so much for it. Enjoy.
Changing subjects to something much lighter, Draco recalled a memory from his childhood of having to take piano lessons.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, pulling his eyes away from Draco’s and hopping off the counter. He fumbled with the knobs on the stove, and poured the water into his mug. He looked at the milk on the stove and grimaced. “I think I’ve burned it.”
“Erhm…”
Harry didn’t correct him, but threw on a large jacket and led Draco out into the back garden to the broom shed. Harry and Draco chose their brooms (there were a surprising number of options, Harry got a lot of free ones to try from different companies hoping that The Harry Potter would endorse their brooms) and were off.
“Ready to go?” he asked.
Draco took the opportunity to hide his song lyrics in the back of his notebook and opened an old Potions textbook. When Harry returned he asked, “What country is that, then?”
Harry stomach made a monstrous noise then.
“How is she?” Harry asked.
He woke to the feeling of Harry dragging him in closer. Draco smiled and rolled over so they were face to face, worked his leg in between Harry’s thighs and nestled his head under Harry’s chin.
“Nah, season is almost over and we didn’t qualify for the playoffs this year.” Harry looked disappointed.
When Draco woke up late that Sunday, he decided to spend the morning playing a new melody he was trying to remember. Harry wouldn’t be done at the Burrow until later, and Draco had promised to bring dinner over to Grimmuald Place.
“Russia. It’s a tad too concentrated for me, I think. But that’s the last of the teas on the list, so I’ll start on coffee soon. Still don’t want to try?” He held up his cup towards Draco, knowing he would say no but offering anyway.
There was a long pause. “I died that night.”
“Haven’t eaten since we ate at High Cup,” he answered sheepishly.
, Draco thought affectionately. He had on two mismatched socks and one trainer in his hand.
Draco pulled his notebook closer and turned to an empty page.
“I like it.”
Draco nodded, then threw the floo powder into the flames and stepped through.
Song is Two Ghosts by Harry Styles. One line of lyrics changed to fit the story (same lips red, same eyes blue changed to same eyes green, same lips too).
She looked up at Harry, who quickly put his finger to his lips silently asking her not to give him away.
“See you tomorrow Draco,” Harry said, standing. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezed as he passed, heading out to the front door to apparate home.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know you’ve written some songs—have you played them?”
“What kind I…” Draco’s brain was still trying to wrap around Harry being here.
Draco could still smell the curry in his kitchen for the next several days. It was definitely strong, but he couldn’t help but smile every time. It reminded him of Harry and his impromptu visit.
, stealing glances at Harry during each of those. He hoped Harry knew it was all about him.
"Writing? Potter, I'm writing a textbook," Draco commented.
It was not graceful, and both Harry and Draco stumbled their way up the steps, missing some, tripping, hitting the walls. They were laughing and kissing and slightly bruised by the time Draco pushed his bedroom door open and was guided, backwards, to his bed.
Halfway down the staircase, his wards chimed.
“She was not muggle, Harry,” Draco interrupted.
“I hated him. The things he did… He deserved to die. He deserved to rot.” Draco tried to suck in a breath, but the words just kept coming. “He was never kind, he never showed me love. He never taught me to do anything but not disgrace the Malfoy name. He didn’t show me how to love, or how to make friends. Just allies or enemies.” Draco sniffled, sucking in a few deep breaths. “But I…” he choked up, not sure what he was trying to say.
“…so pleased to introduce Draco Malfoy, author of
“I tried so many different coffees, I feel like I forgot what a decent cup of black coffee tastes like,” he explained to Draco one day.
He pursed his lips, then wrote.
When Harry was already out the door, Draco realized he hadn’t answered.
“Oh man, I can almost picture your mother’s face.” Harry was laughing.
After that first interaction, they fell into a routine of sorts. Draco sat at his table and tried to work, but would be distracted. Harry would loudly come in, order his food, and sit on the armchair. Harry would inevitably spill his drink or laugh out loud at something he was reading. Harry would breathe in Draco’s direction. And Draco would not be able to focus one bit on his research.
They had gone to Luna’s house for the interview, but it really just felt like a conversation between old friends. Draco hadn’t realized she’d snapped a picture of the two of them.
“Are you sure? I really didn’t mean for the night to end like this,” Harry made an apologetic face.
“What is it?” Draco stood up straight, a can of chicken broth in hand.
Draco cleared his throat. “So what are you having today?” he asked.
“Harry. It doesn’t change the fact that they are your friends and I’m sure they don’t mind,” Draco knew what Harry meant though. Sometimes he felt like he was intruding on Pansy and Nott when he visited. Third wheeling and all that.
Draco silently held out his arm, and Harry wrapped his hand around his crooked elbow.
“Yes.”
Draco made a face.
“Why exactly did you leave the fast track to becoming the head of the Auror department to chase a snitch and…” Draco paused, gesturing at Harry’s sweaty clothes. “And smell?”
There was nothing damning about the picture.
“I promised Pansy I would help discuss the details of her engagement party.” Draco had already explained this to Harry, but Harry liked to forget things he didn’t like.
Once she left, Harry turned to Draco and grinning, said, “I bet Luna wouldn’t mind a pink bathroom.”
“Shall we?”
“Takes one to know one,” Harry joked.
“What? I grew up a muggle. I didn’t even know magic was real until Hagrid showed up with my letter,” Harry pointed out.
“Don’t rush me, Draco, it’s an important decision,” Harry waved Draco off.
Draco’s eyes traced over Harry’s face, down his neck and at the one feathered wing tattooed over his shoulder and across his chest.
Harry was starting to stir. He stretched his arms. “Draco…” he muttered into the pillow.
Two weeks later, Draco had ambushed Harry in his living room, flooing to Grimmuald Place as soon as he’d finished reading the letter.
Finally, Draco had enough and asked, “How have you been?”
Draco put down his mug and pen and sat back to consider his answer. "Not really. I might have a sweet tooth, and Mother doesn't usually serve anything but tea. And, don't ever tell her I said this, but quite frankly I hate tea."
Second, Harry was sitting up on Draco’s counter, swinging his legs, eyes closed, humming a tune.
“Yes, you said it to me last night.”
Just as he said it, Arthur and Charlie were helping Molly sit down while Angelina fanned her with a napkin. “My baby girl… married! Oh! And I didn’t even get to plan the wedding!”
"An autobiography?" Draco asked.
“Potter, not at the Beachwood today?” Draco asked, glancing around to see if anyone had noticed them.
“Need to head home to freshen up a bit, promised I would meet Ron and Hermione to head to the pub together. Neville’s going to ask Hannah to marry him and wants us there for moral support,” Harry grinned.
“Ugh Draco why do you always look so good in these?” Harry complained.
Draco thought.
Draco glanced up at Harry every so often, only to find him buried in his letter.
Olivia took over picking who could ask the questions from there. Draco answered as best he could. The next person Olivia called on started their question and Draco searched the crowd for the familiar voice.
“Well. What is it?” Harry could barely contain himself, excited and nervous all at once.
But Draco finally understood that all of these words he’d written were meant for Harry and that Harry was meant to hear them. that maybe he should have been singing them for Harry all along.
Draco thought again.
Harry yawned. Turning back to Draco, he opened his mouth to say something.
He could feel himself getting close, quickening his pace and Harry tried to pull his hips even closer, if that was possible. He pulled away from the kiss, burying his face in Harry’s neck, feeling their sweat mix together.
“Thanks, Draco.” Harry visibly relaxed.
The next morning, Harry came rushing in to the Beachwood asking Draco how it went.
“What happened?” Harry asked, reaching forward to touch him, concerned. Draco merely shook his head.
. Draco knew that Harry deserved at least that. And maybe, just maybe, he’d give Draco a second chance.
“I know,” he answered. Harry flopped his head back onto the pillows. Draco got his shirt on and walked over to Harry, leaving a quick kiss on his lips. Harry reached up and took advantage of Draco’s unbuttoned shirt, feeling his stomach muscles and deepening the kiss.
The Queen song ended and the next began. “Yesterday my life was in ruin. Now today I know what I'm doing. Got a feeling I should be doing all right, doing all right.”
“No. Just thinking.”
, Draco thought. The idea was a little absurd.
It wasn’t enough. He couldn’t get enough of Harry. His hands, his mouth were on Draco. His stubble was scratching Draco’s skin, body pressing Draco into the bed.
“Well, you should try some of each. Wait, no, that’s too many flavors mixing. You’ll have to go in stages,” Harry was in his element apparently. He turned to grab two plates from a cabinet.
When it was about time to leave, Harry reached for one of the book stacks. “Right then, I’ll take these.”
After a few minutes of flying north, Draco asked, “So what is it you want to show me? We’re obviously flying far from your place.”
“What’s this place called?”
He looked free.
. Harry was in jeans and a Falcons shirt, smiling broadly as he drew out some new defensive play.
“Sitting? Typically what one does with a bench,” Harry responded sarcastically. “Just somewhere to relax and enjoy good weather when we have it.”
It hopped inside, holding out a letter for Draco to take. Draco gave him an owl treat and told him to wait, just in case. Draco opened the letter.
he asked himself.
Draco and Blaise grasped each other’s shoulders and smiled.
Smiling, he repeated Draco’s first words to him. “Hello,” he said. “Hogwarts, too?”
“Hmm,” Draco answered.
Draco thought about what he would say. He didn’t know how to apologize well, wasn’t good at admitting his mistakes. He reached for his guitar, wanting to play a few notes.
Draco had tried not to get his hopes up, but he thought of little else since the missed sighting.
They sat in the quiet for a few minutes. Draco was trying to figure out how to ask Harry what this was.
Ron, Hermione, Neville, Hannah, and Ginny were all in the Beachwood Café, ordering drinks. A few of them were carrying shopping bags, all laughing together. They were obviously all out together, enjoying the day with friends.
Draco sat back in his chair, fiddling with the champagne flute and fondly watching his friends argue about when to announce the engagement in the Prophet.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was in the morning room, writing down lyrics and scratching through them, just to rewrite the same thing again.
Draco missed this. He missed their table and he missed his mornings with Harry. He missed the hot chocolate and missed making fun of Harry’s drink choices.
“I lost track of the time, and besides, it’s not like we plan to meet every day,” Draco answered smoothly, sitting down and casting a quick warming charm on his now cold mug.
“That’s hippogriff shit. I’m so sorry, Draco.” Harry nudged the hot chocolate into his hands.
Draco looked Harry over. “I’m not sure how my boyfriend would feel about me dancing with some hot stranger.”
Draco thought.
Draco merely raised his eyebrow in question, choosing to look Harry over. He was dressed in muggle jeans and a thin tee shirt that accentuated his broad shoulders and muscles nicely. His hair was as unruly as ever.
“Harry.”
“I told you so. I do have good ideas once in a while. Though technically it was my therapist’s idea,” he said cheerily, taking a sip of his zavarka tea. “Yikes, this needs...something,” he said as he got up to talk to the barista.
“I was considering doing it geographically, and go continent by continent, but I’m not sure how well I would keep up with that as I don’t know world geography quite well enough to remember it on my own.” Harry was buzzing with excitement.
“Harry, love, I’m going to start dinner!” he called into the house, not sure what Harry was up to.
Halfway through the song, Draco was humming along. Or trying, the melody had seemed to change. A few more moments passed and the song ended, and Draco looked around, realizing Harry hadn’t come back yet.
. Harry’s breath was shallow and lips were swollen. Draco reached up to run his hand through his hair, to try and flatten what he knew must look a right mess.
They got into bed together and curled comfortably around each other, drifting back to sleep in each other’s arms.
“Yeah. You stay here, finish what you’re doing. I’ll make it.” Harry got up before Draco could answer, making his way to the kitchen.
He paused for a minute, trying to convey in his look to Harry everything he was thinking.
“Oh. Uhm, yeah, please. Thanks.”
“Have you not heard of a cleaning charm, Potter? You have a wand for a reason,” Draco said, casting a simple cleaning spell on Harry.
Draco looked up from the contract. She was serious.
“Wizard music is pretty limited, and I figured you didn’t want any Celestina Warbeck in your collection,” Harry grinned.
“You’re Harry Potter, so the world is your oyster. You could do anything you want to.”
Draco decided to just accept that this was how he would spend his Sunday night. Trying different curries with Harry, laughing at Harry’s excitement when Draco announced that his favorite was the chicken tikka masala.
She answered with a ‘hoo’ and held her leg out for Draco to grab the letter. He gave her a few scratches before she hopped back to the window and took off.
True to his word, Harry didn't say anything, just scribbled what looked like Quidditch plays in a small notebook.
He held his hand out again and looked the owl in the eyes, trying to come to an agreement.
“And you’re planning to run a library from the flat, Draco?” Harry gestured to the books.
“What about your father?” Harry asked. Draco huffed out a laugh.
Once there, Draco paused with his quill above the parchment.
“Some. But it’s hard to practice since I don’t own one myself. That’s one of the reasons I picked up guitar. Much easier to tote around places.”
A publisher wanted to meet with him. Today, if possible.
Harry continued. “I just…I don’t
P.S. I have an Epilogue coming, partly because I hate odd numbers and partly because my beta said it's "rude to leave the readers hanging on that ending."
Draco’s mind raced. He knew that Lucius had deserved the sentencing he got, and he’d even been glad to see him toted off to rot in a cell. But to actually be faced with his death?
Seeing the time, Neville bid farewell to Draco, who decided to stop at a few shops to pick up things to cook for dinner. He and Harry had been testing out new curry recipes, experimenting to find the right flavors.
*Knock knock knock*
“Morning,” he mumbled into Harry.
And in that second chance, here he was sitting in Draco’s chair, choosing to spend time with Draco.
Draco was almost sad when Harry didn't come in on Sunday.
"Yes, well, you need higher standards." Really, Harry seemed like he would be happy to have sink water.
He talked to each of his teammates and answered some questions from a few reporters.
"Do you have somewhere to be, Draco?" Narcissa asks, almost reading his mind as they stroll through the grounds.
“Fauteuil, and yes, but I had them covered in new pink upholstery to match the bathroom,” said Draco as he set down a precariously large stack of books.
They were both sitting at the kitchen bar and talking, having finished their meals. Harry got up and started grabbing at plates.
Harry smiled. “Right then, well, I’ll just have whatever you’re having. I’ve got to pop in the shop a moment, I’ll meet you back here in 10?”
Draco was thankful to Harry for suggesting he write. And the letters were helping.
“I’ll see you. Thank you. And sorry, again, Draco.” And with that, he apparated away.
They sat on their chairs for a few moments, quietly drinking.
Harry started, “So, uh…” He ran his hand through his hair. “Do you use some sort of spell to shave?”
“Marry me,” Harry breathed out. He looked into Draco’s eyes for a moment, then fumbled through his pocket. He pulled out a ring box and handed it to Draco.
First, Harry was in fact waiting for the milk to boil.
“Do you want me to reach out…”
“How am I not relaxed?”
Harry handed him one silently.
When Draco stepped through the floo at his flat, the first thing he noticed was the owl asleep at his window.
Harry shuffled back, standing over Draco and shucking his jeans and boxers down at once, stumbling slightly while untangling his feet from them. He stood back up, locking eyes with Draco.
Draco could feel himself grinning. And, for the first time since this whole thing with Harry began, he wasn’t falling anymore. He’d already fallen.
“Of course I’ll marry you, you idiot,” Draco said fondly, holding Harry close.
Draco finished his bread and absentmindedly hummed a tune, wondering what he should do.
Teddy was running around the box, chanting “Pot-ter! Pot-ter!”
Harry went straight for the kitchen, set the bag on the counter, and began taking out various containers.
Friday rolled around and Draco absentmindedly grabbed a few books to bring to the Beachwood. He apparated to Diagon Alley and started making his way towards the cafe, still thinking of Harry.
As soon as he sat down at their table, Draco put his head in his hands.
“No, I know. But Hermione is so busy at work trying to tie up every loose end that we all know she’s already tied up perfectly. She’s just crazy right now, the baby is due in a few months. And poor Ron is going mad trying to make sure she stays happy.”
Just then a beautiful and rather large horse patronus came galloping into the room, rearing in front of Harry.
“Near Dufton in Cumbria. Middle of nowhere really, but I love coming here.”
“You aren’t your father. And you aren’t who you used to be. I’m sure they see that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course,” Draco got up and waved his wand at the fireplace, altering his floo network wards to give access to Grimmuald Place. He gestured for Harry to step forward once he was done, returning to stand by his chair.
“Don’t you have somewhere to be?” Draco was already starting to pick up the remaining books, sure he’d lost the battle.
“I’d like to thank each of you for coming here today, and for purchasing the textbook. It means a lot,” he glanced over at Olivia who mouthed the words ‘take questions’. “Uhm, right, so I’ll answer a few questions if you’d like.”
Once in the store, Draco tried to remember the brand Harry had gotten.
They worked in silence that morning, both focusing well on their own projects for the first time in a while. At some point, Harry got up for a coffee refill, asking Draco if he needed anything.
Draco set the guitar down and pulled Harry into his lap, putting everything he was back in to that kiss. They ended the kiss but stayed close, foreheads pressing against each other.
“Smells good,” Harry commented, falling in to stride with Draco as they headed to the Diagon Alley apparition point.
“We’ll want further works, of course. We can’t very well publish a Level 1 textbook without planning for consecutive levels. There would be a timeline for those, so you would have to agree to have drafts ready by certain deadlines. And of course, we also would hope you’ll agree to some marketing events, speaking at several upcoming Potions conventions, interviewing for
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin and brought him back up to see eye to eye. He searched Harry’s brilliant green eyes and what he saw practically made his heart hurt. Harry’s eyes were fire, burning through Draco with love and need. Draco brought their lips back together, opening his mouth to explore Harry’s.
“Harry. I’m sure you can manage yourself fine,” Harry joked, “but these books are another story. And you don’t have to. I can help.”
Agatha flew off with the response and Draco sat down with his guitar, hot chocolate long forgotten, and started to play all the songs he wanted to sing for Harry, making sure he remembered them. Hoping that Harry would understand, would hear what Draco was trying to say in each of them.
, he thought, letting Agatha in.
She squeezed his arms and then kissed his cheek. Draco gave her a small smile, then turned back down the path to the gates.
“You don’t look like it’s nothing,” Draco said, seeing that Harry was pulling at the loose thread on his sleeve.
His mind was drifting, thinking about how they would react to him bringing Harry along to one of these dinners. They would likely accept him quickly but give him a hard time about it. He wondered if Harry’s friends would do the same for him.
“Circe’s tit, Malfoy, what’s that smell?” She wrinkled her nose.
Usually, he immediately found fault with the listings Harry gave him, which only made Harry search harder. Like it was a personal challenge.
he thought to himself. But that’s where his head had been at lately.
“It’s not exactly public knowledge.”
Draco cleared his throat and decided to change the subject quickly, derailing that train of thought that would lead nowhere good.
“I fucked things up, Pansy,” Draco sighed, putting his head in his hands.
Draco snapped to when the kettle started to scream. He pulled back from Harry, putting as much space between them as he could before his back hit the island.
“Nope, season’s over, remember?”
Chapter 1
Draco was waiting in an office in the back of the store, peaking through the window at the packed bookshop. He was nervous and wished Harry was there to calm him. But since winning the World Cup, Harry had been made captain of the Falcons and had practice.
Lee nodded at Draco, who was on the stage with his guitar. Hannah had found out he sang during a late night truth or dare game (that included several shots of firewhiskey) at their flat, and had begged him to sing for their first dance.
Before he knew what was happening, Draco let out a sob, fisting his hands in Harry’s shirt.
Heh. Don't expect two updates in one day again.
Every day they silently greeted each other with curt nods or small waves.
Draco’s head shot up at that. “What?”
Now seven pints in, Draco was seriously feeling the effects of the alcohol. He’d long forgotten what he came here to forget and was laughing raucously at something Harry had said.
, Draco thought—with both drinks (always a hot chocolate for Draco, but Harry seemed to be making an attempt to try everything on the menu), already scribbling down plays or reading some magazine. Other days he would walk in a few minutes after Draco, glance across the room, and smile when he'd see Draco already waiting for him.
That’s when Draco caught the scent. “What the hell is that, Potter?”
Draco was placing lazy kisses to Harry’s neck before rolling off to the side, wandlessly muttering a cleaning spell.
There, on his doorstep, was Harry Potter.
Draco got to the Beachwood Café forty-five minutes earlier than usual. The barista was a little surprised to see him and told him the chocolate croissants were still baking.
“Harry,” Draco agreed. For a moment, they just looked at each other. Then Harry turned and stared at the dying embers of the fire that had long since gone out.
Draco lifted his head to look at Harry. Harry was smiling.
Draco felt the moan escape his lips, and felt Harry’s tongue go right back to swirl around the tip of Draco’s arousal. “Merlin,” he breathed aloud this time. Feeling himself about to fall over the edge, he pulled Harry off and to a stand, not ready for this to be over.
"Mmm, that's perfect." Harry wrapped his hands around his mug and sat back to eye Draco.
Draco laughed. “Granger was always strung up too tight.”
, he thought grimly.
, et cetera. We'll handle the basic marketing and sales side of things.”
Draco took that as a sign to go back to his work, forcing himself to focus as much as possible on the article. Harry pulled out some parchment and started writing.
Draco looked back out over the canyon.
“Draco, we shouldn’t,” Harry said.
“I’ve never heard of any of these,” Draco commented.
Hours later, just before midnight, Harry raised his glass and addressed the crowd in the garden. Ron and Hermione were close by, Rose sleeping soundly on Ron’s shoulder. Blaise had his arms wrapped around Ginny’s shoulders, both swaying to the music. The large portion of the Weasley clan was there—Arthur and Molly, George and Angelina, even Charlie had come in from Romania for the holidays. Pansy and Hannah were comparing wedding notes and ideas while Neville and Theo were animatedly discussing bank loans and the legal aspects of opening a shop. Narcissa was teaching Teddy how to dance a waltz, while Andromeda watched on. Luna was passing along little hats, noise makers, and 2003 shaped glasses to everyone.
For a brief moment, Draco thinks that Harry will try to say something. To deny it all. Harry had friends and family who loved him, why ruin any of that with Draco in the picture? But no, he’d said this morning that this would be a date. Did that mean…?
It wasn’t a question, but he answered anyway. “Yes, Headmistress.”
*Thunk* “Damnit,” Draco cursed as a pile of wizarding history books fell over. He’d stepped back to reconsider whether his Transfiguration texts fit best in their own section or should be included with other basic wandwork texts.
When Draco showed Harry the article over breakfast, he had an idea.
"Have you tried it? You always have the same thing. Don't you get bored?" Harry asked. He looked genuinely curious.
“I know.” Harry let go.
“Well, I think your own flat is a good idea.”
Draco looked around. They were in a small cluster of trees and he couldn’t see very far through them, but there was a well-worn path.
“While you are here, I would like to discuss this with you.” She eyed him for a little. Draco couldn’t help but squirm in his seat, like he had been caught not paying attention in class.
Once he was out on Diagon Alley, he smiled broadly.
Harry smirked, pulled his hand away, and began kissing the scars up to Draco’s neck, sucking the same spot he’d worked on earlier.
"Don't hold your breath, Potter," said Draco. "Shouldn't you be going?"
Harry was half-heartedly singing along, bobbing his head to the drumbeat.
“Took you long enough.”
There it was again, the golden glow from behind Harry. The melody Draco had been humming popped back into his head.
“Uhm…” Draco trailed off.
“Well that’s good. I know how you hate the off season.”
“I’m fine, really. I’ve been seeing someone. And no, I won’t tell you who lest the entire wizarding community find out about it tomorrow,” Draco said, staunching out Pansy’s almost immediate question.
“Of course. But I get to pick the restaurant.”
“Wonderful! I’ll just send this along to our legal department and have them reach out to your lawyers to schedule a meeting to finalize everything,” Mrs. Davies said, standing. “It’s been a real pleasure, Mr. Malfoy, I’m so glad to have you join our publishing house.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned toward the post office to rent an owl. He needed to see Harry, there was so much to say.
Draco sighed into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and
, Draco started strumming. “What do you mean? I'm sorry by the way, I'm never coming back down. Can't you see?” He didn’t dare look up at Harry as he played. He felt like he was baring his soul, reading aloud something never meant to be shared.
“Oh, Minerva, please,” she said. “We’re both adults.” She looked at him through her glasses, making him feel more like a student than ever.
“It’s not a Death Eater meeting, gents, lighten up!” Blaise exclaimed, pouring himself a glass of wine and smiling brightly. “Draco, good to see you.”
He sat down with his hot chocolate and tried to read a recent article about potential side effects of taking both the Blemish Blitzer potion and the Weasley Wizarding Wheezes Kissing Concoction. Once he had reread the same sentence six times, he gave up, pushing the article to the side.
They were sitting in a booth tucked in the back, opposite each other. Their knees and legs were touching under the table. The pub had started off quiet, but it had since filled once 9 pm rolled around. Harry was still nursing his third beer, long since gone warm by now.
Harry turned his broom abruptly, shooting towards the other end of the stadium.
“Will you play me one of your songs you’ve written?” Harry asked.
“I know. I forgave you before I even got all the way home. You were right about some of it, I was scared. Scared of what people would say and others trying to pull us apart. Scared of getting hurt. I’m sorry, too. That I didn’t tell you how I felt.” Draco closed his eyes as Harry kissed him lightly again, on the lips and down his jawline.
His thoughts were cut off by a kiss. It wasn’t forceful or needy, it was soft and sweet and full of love. Harry held Draco’s face like it was made of glass, kissed him like he was the sweetest thing he’d ever tasted.
“Want it to be right?”
“Hungry, Potter?”
“But maybe this can be a date. Officially. I think we’ve had enough of skirting around talking about what this is. What we are.”
“Very well. Harry” Draco arched his eyebrows, picked up his pen, and started skimming down the lines of his book.
Harry had seen the snitch change directions right as Wiliams looked back at Harry. Wiliams realized what had happened too late, and before he could catch up, Harry was holding the snitch above his head, cheering and circling the field.
"Great! I'd love to hear it if you ever do," Harry grinned.
Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed, smiling. He half waved at Draco to come back to their table, but Draco kept singing. “It ain't my fault that I'm out here getting loose, Gotta blame it on the Goose, Gotta blame it on my juice, baby.”
Three days after the incident, Pansy came through Draco’s floo to find him sitting in his chair at 10 am still in his nightclothes and nursing a scotch.
“Harry, you failed to mention the ghastly PINK BATHROOM!”
“However, he is an adult and I trust that he can make his own decisions. He also is an extremely good judge of character.” She was smiling at him.
Draco smiled and rolled on top of Harry. His smiled morphed into a smirk as he answered: “Hmm.”
Maybe it was the alcohol or the long day or the way Harry said it was a good idea, but Draco actually considered it. “Hmm,” was all he said as answer.
“Yes. I don’t want to be held responsible if Hermione finds out I held you back.”
Harry looked relieved. “Thanks. I forget sometimes how easy it is. Old habits.” Harry reached for his croissant, taking a large bite and seeming pleased to discover warm ham and cheese on the inside.
“I mean that you should take your own advice and relax some.”
. He wondered if they were new. Draco proceeded to open the other packages, all containing what seemed to the be entire works of several different bands—The Beatles, Foreigner, Britney Spears, The Police, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Tom Petty, Tupac, Kansas, Pink Floyd, The Notorious B.I.G., Weezer.

Draco made his way into the hallway, shutting the door behind him. He leaned his head back against it for a moment, taking a deep breath. He could feel his mind going to places he didn’t want to think about.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You think parents will want a Death Eater teaching their kids?” Draco asked incredulously.
“And we do have an offer price in the contract, but that can be negotiable if it doesn’t seem appropriate…” She almost looked nervous.
Though she didn’t sound like she was judging them, Draco didn’t want her telling any of Harry’s other friends that they’d been together. Harry probably didn’t want them to know.
“Come on, Draco. This way,” Harry said.
“Draco,” Harry said, standing in the doorway. He had an odd look in his eyes, torn between unsure and sad. He was holding an open letter.
“Go home, Harry. Get some sleep. I’ll see you tomorrow,” Draco said before Harry could.
Draco breathed out a sigh of relief when the two started talking about Hermione’s baby, and something about how Luna wanted Harry’s help putting a magical object to help ward against nargles in the nursery.
"No, he doesn’t know.”
Is that where Draco’s head was? Did he like Harry, or was this just a convenient friendship of sorts?
“You don’t want to be late, Potter,” Draco dismissed. He wouldn’t admit anything.
“Harry…” Draco started. Harry cut him off with an insistent kiss, pushing Draco back up against the door frame, bracing one hand behind Draco’s head and settling the other on Draco’s hip.
This story was stuck in my head for 6 months, and for the last two weeks, I've been finally writing it down. I hope you all enjoyed it. Another big thank you to my beta, Aigidion.
“Blaise and Theo figured it out on their own in school. I told Pansy in fifth year when she wouldn’t stop hanging off me, trying to get me to sneak off and make out with her.”
“You’re bloody hot when you’re angry. Reminded me of you in school. When you used to follow me in sixth year, convinced I was up to no good.”
When Harry yawned, Draco vanished the empty containers and summoned some pillows and a book. He leaned back against the bookcase and made himself comfortable, then patted his lap for Harry to lay down.
“Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that,” Draco said, sitting up.
“You’ve been writing a lot lately. Is it helping?”
Draco stepped in front of the fireplace to floo to the publishers.
Once again, there, on his doorstep, was Harry Potter.
Draco closed his eyes, trying to banish the memories from his head. He sat for a few minutes before opening his eyes and finding Harry watching him. Beautiful green eyes staring into his own grey ones.
Now Draco was pointing out constellations to Harry. “Do you ever think about the future?” Harry asked.
“Still gives me plenty of time to have my way with you, Potter.” His hand moved to Harry’s ass as he kissed his neck.
Draco untied the string and ripped apart the brown paper packaging. Inside was a stack of records by a band called Queen.
“Oh you know,” she responded vaguely. “Wine?”
“This last one…” Draco thought about what he wanted to say. “This last one I wrote after one of the happiest days of my life.”
Hope you all enjoyed that.
Harry sat back with Draco, offering a bite of whatever sample he’d been given to try. Draco took it and made a face.
“You’d think I didn’t know magic if you came to my house. I’d have done all that by hand.”
Draco took the jacket off and placed it over the chair. He was trying to smooth his shirt down when he decided that not having the jacket on was too informal and not like him at all.
“For what?” Draco asked.
Draco stopped playing. He thought about what he’d said to Pansy. That Harry was the light and he was the dark. He started playing again, a new song this time.
“You always say you want to hear me sing!” Draco said into the microphone.
“Do you ever feel like you don’t have a purpose?”
“Is he still…” Harry half asked.
He knew they had agreed to put the past behind them—Harry had asked they do as much after he spoke for Draco and Narcissa at the post-war Death Eater trials. He'd even held out his hand to Draco to shake, the same as Draco had to Harry on the train their first year at Hogwarts. There was something in his eyes that Draco had believed, and, wanting to start anew, he shook Harry's hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm thinking somewhere around 18 chapters for this fic.
“But you’ve told me,” Draco said, more of a statement than a question.
“Sure you are.” Harry leaned back and folded his arms, grinning at Draco.
“Sorry. I forgot.”
“No matter, it should all be delivered in a few days. For the amount of galleons I gave them, they should come up with something suitable.” Despite his complaints, Draco was actually looking forward to moving in and having a place of his own. It felt like freedom was just waiting around the corner.
, he thought. He made a move to grab his wand to check the time, then immediately stopped and groaned again. He felt like shit.
“I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way. Mind, you grow a little wiser, little better every day…” a voice sang through the room.
Draco thought, briefly imaging what life would have been like had they all ended up in arranged marriages.
Harry was thrilled for him, but Draco had quickly grown more and more nervous. When it was time to head back home to get ready, Harry accompanied him—to help, to distract. Draco wasn’t quite sure which until Harry followed him into the shower and sank straight to his knees in front of him.
“So, I hadn’t gotten you a housewarming present yet, and finally decided what you needed,” he said, placing the packages on the floor.
“Open them,” Harry said, barely containing his excitement. “This one first.” He pointed at one of the parcels.
Draco rolled back over and decided to ignore everything. Maybe if he pretended that last night hadn’t happened… Maybe if he pretended the last few months never happened…
As he slowed his strumming, he realized Harry was standing from his chair.
Draco opened his eyes and quickly made his way towards the floo, shrugging on his suit jacket and using magic to get the creases out. Pansy would definitely notice and he wasn’t sure he could handle the questions right now.
He quickly flipped them around and pushed Harry onto the bed, leaning to grab the bottle of lube from the bedside table. He squirted a generous portion into his hand, using it to slick his own cock then to do the same to Harry’s. Harry sharply pulled in a breath when Draco’s fingers wrapped around him.
Draco returned to his notebook, mind flooded with the words to fit the sad melody he’d been mulling over.
“Of course,” Draco bent over her desk to sign his name on the first page.
Harry walked them off to the side, away from the path, and sat down. His legs dangled over the edge and he leaned back on both hands. Draco wanted to keep this picture in his mind at all times
anything now. I’m just waiting for practice to start back up for the Falcons. I feel like I should be doing something.”
“Oh, no I’m not free,” Draco answered.
"No, you know what I meant."
“Lead the way, Potter.”
Pansy paused before handing the glass to Draco, squinting at him appraisingly. He narrowed his eyes in return, noting the awkward position of her arm. He narrowed his eyes at her.
“Hmm,” Draco responded. She was already pouring when she asked.
“Bullshit. I haven’t heard from you in days, no one has. You missed dinner with Blaise the other night. He had something to tell you, you know.”
They shared a lingering kiss in front of the fireplace before Harry, almost unwillingly, let go and flooed home.
“FOUL!” Ron and George were yelling.
Draco rinsed the soap from his body, sighing as he leaned his forehead on the tiles.
“Now, I know that we all have a lot of history from back in school, but Draco and I have talked about all of that. I stand by what I said about him at the trials. We understand each other. And,” Harry turned to look at Draco, “I love him.”
Braced for a fight, Draco quickly realized the noise was Harry, snoring peacefully beside him in his bed.
, he thought, a
“I believe the sanity ship sailed a while back, Potter.”
Draco thought.
“What do you mean by that?”
Once they were outside in the warm summer air, Draco’s ears were ringing from the sudden quiet. Harry grabbed his arm and guided him towards the apparition point.
“I don’t do well when I have too much time on my hands. I need distractions, and Quidditch takes up a ton of my time. And there’s only so many times I can visit Hermione and Ron. They need their alone time and I feel like a bother.”
“Nothing!” Harry answered quickly.
“Oh?”
Draco wasn't sure why he wanted to see Potter again. There was so much he wanted to say, and yet he felt there was nothing that they could really talk about. They were connected by the past, but Draco still felt the sting of Harry's rejection in his first year.
“I heard rumors about that,” Draco mentioned. “That you lived with muggles.”
“Potter, its a Cornes de Gazelle,” Draco corrected.
“Marry me, Draco Malfoy. I love you and I want you in my life forever. I want us forever.”
“Yes. It took a few moments to make sure none of them fell off mid-apparation. Can’t always be sure where things will end up if you lose them mid jump.” Draco had never been very good at sizing charms and didn’t want to risk destroying the books to make them smaller and more manageable to carry.
“Agatha?” Draco asked.
“Honestly, it’s like they’ve nothing better to talk about. Leeches, the lot of them.”
“I’m sure we could come to an agreement, Mrs. Davies,” he replied smoothly.
“It’s a Corny Gazelle from Morocco!” Harry enthusiastically told him.
Draco went to the wall of bookshelves and began perusing the titles. Most of everything seemed decades old, subjects ranging from ancient wizarding genealogy to spells and potions, likely all very outdated. Draco tried his best not to eavesdrop, but it was hard and Harry was not trying to keep his voice down at all.
Theo looked like he might be sick. It was finally his wedding day, and Draco and Blaise were groomsmen. “I get why you didn’t do all this Blaise. Too much pressure on one day.”
Harry turned, apparently not expecting to see Draco outside of the flat. “Oh. Draco, I was just…” He ran his hand through his hair. “I was just about to knock.”
“Oi! I’m trying to help you. No need for that,” he said, reaching for the owl treats on his desk anyway.
Draco felt his body reacting to the memories. He’d have a new problem soon if he didn’t switch gears.
That night, Draco dreamt of flying.
“I asked if you want to join Nott and me for lunch at the Leaky Cauldron tomorrow.”
Harry looked at the bill of sale in his hands. “Wait, you got the flat? You have a flat!” He reached across the table and squeezed Draco’s hand. “I’m so happy for you. This will be good for you, I think.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, it’s fine.” He looked into Draco’s eyes, searching from something. Draco wanted to ask what.
Harry huffed and drank his coffee.
A few minutes later, as they counted down the seconds to the new year, Draco couldn’t help but feel a tiny bit jealous of Blaise. Pushing the thought aside, he pulled Harry in for a kiss.
He shrugged out of his suit jacket and went to the kitchen to make a hot chocolate. Just as he was adding in more marshmallows than could really fit, he heard the owl scratching at the windowpane.
“Hmm, money isn’t really a bother, Harry. But I do like the little yard. I could grow some of the more rare Potions ingredients I might need.” Draco had gone to view a few flats already, but nothing seemed like the right fit.
“Yeah.” Harry watched the sunset out the window for a few more moments. “You could, too, you know.”
Draco returned from the Manor late in the evening, having told his mother about the publication deal. She had insisted on a full seven-course meal and champagne to celebrate.
Harry couldn’t hide the blush. “Oh, erm… thanks?”
“Your official offer letter. Oh, before you leave, would you mind signing my book?” She grinned, reaching for the advanced copy of his textbook.
Draco walked over to his armchair, lost in thoughts and memories of Harry for the remainder of the evening.
Draco felt like sparks ought to be flying from the two of them. The room ought to be spinning. The kiss was hot and Harry was gorgeous.
“Yes. I would do anything for you, Harry.”
Harry smiled at him, remembering that night. “If I say no again, will you start to karaoke?”
“Harry,” Harry gave Draco a look that said ‘you know better by now,’ ignoring Draco’s comment. Harry sat, then patted the rug next to him.
Harry had also disappeared after the trials, until one day he was announced as the new Seeker for the Falmouth Falcons.
“Yeah, a bit. She actually wasn’t shocked about it. Said she’d wondered about me before. They all took it really well, actually. I was afraid everyone would hate me or blame the war and say my head wasn’t in the right space.”
“Oh,” Harry responded. He squinted a bit at the fireplace behind Draco and grinned a little. “And you know that because?” he asked.
“In Azkaban? Yes. He will be until he dies, I suppose.” Draco wasn’t bitter anymore. While he wishes things could have been different, Harry was right. He had just been a child. Why would his father lie or be wrong about something? He just wishes he’d realized it much sooner.
Draco tried to shift his attention away from the previous day by singing.
"No. She helped keep my secret, pretended we were anytime someone questioned a bit too much.” Draco didn’t want to think about what would have happened if word had gotten out. Of if it got back to his father that he was anything but the Perfect Pureblood heir to the Malfoy name.
Also, damn Draco, stop being a twat.
,” Harry answered, looking up and smiling at Draco. “Ron and I flew over this place on the way to school second year.”
“Not exactly,” Draco gave a mischievous grin. “But with enough money, anything is for sale.”
They’d retired back to the drawing room for a celebratory toast after dinner.
Draco nodded. He knew plenty enough about politics thanks to his father’s insistence.
They had been walking down Diagon Alley towards the Leaky Cauldron to meet some friends when they’d noticed the photographer. Draco was in his suit and sunglasses and looked like he’d just stepped out of a Witch Weekly ad. Harry, on the other hand, immediately made a funny face and made like he was fighting off some invisible assailant, throwing fake punches and kicking the air.
“Come on, Potter, where’s your Gryffindor courage?”
“I’m sure you’ll get a deal, Draco. You worked on it for ages,” Harry said encouragingly.
Draco hadn’t realized he was crying. Harry held Draco there for a few minutes, shushing and swaying them slightly.
Song is Canyon Moon by Harry Styles. I've slightly altered two parts of the lyrics (I heard Jenny saying "Go get the kids from school"; She plays songs I've never heard) to fit the story better, but not a huge change.
“Wake me by 3 please,” Harry muttered before soon drifting off to sleep.
Harry had made Draco bring along his guitar so he could play their song. Harry hummed along, leaning back on his hands and watching Draco play.
He looked up when the bell chimed as the door opened. There weren't often many other customers at this time of day. Which is exactly why Draco chose to come to the Beachwood Cafe at 10 most mornings. Moping about the Manor day in and day out did no good, but walking the streets of Diagon Alley typically drew a bit too much attention.
“Look at this one,” Harry said, sliding the paper over to Draco. Ever since he mentioned looking for a place to move, Harry had taken it upon himself to find the perfect place.
“Didn’t mean to wake you,” Harry said gruffly.
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
“Of course.” Draco glared at Harry, who was already happily making himself look busy, ignoring Draco.
Draco had to hand it to Luna, she definitely did things her way. He was glad to have their news out via the Quibbler first, knowing that Prophet would only write near-truths. And he couldn’t help but staring at the picture she’d taken.
“You’re late,” Harry says accusingly. Draco’s hot chocolate and croissant was sitting at the empty spot of their table as Draco came in.
“Come off it, Potter, the night is young!” Draco lifted his glass up with the girls, sloshing half the contents onto the ground.
The sun was almost set, pale pinks and purples on the horizon. The canyon was cast in the faint moonlight, breeze still blowing steadily through the grass.
A few minutes passed and he could hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Harry’s face popped around the corner a moment later.
“I don’t know if I can. I said some things… Pans, he’s so brilliantly bright and I’m like the darkness pulling him back down. I thought I could be better, that he’d make me lighter, but I can’t. And then what I accused him of…”
Draco had always known, objectively, that Harry was attractive. But admitting to himself how fit Harry was hit like a bludger to his chest. He was tall and lean, but muscular thanks to all that Quidditch practice. His jaw and neck were well-defined. His bright green eyes crinkled and his Adam’s apple bobbed when he laughed. Though it was untamed, Harry’s mess of black hair gave him a just-shagged look. Sometimes Harry wore button-down shirts and left the top few buttons open, which Draco seemed to hyper-fixate on. Draco thought he could see a tattoo peaking through every once in a while, and he couldn’t help but imagine what was underneath the perpetual jeans and tees.
Draco hoped Harry was right. But Harry didn’t see the looks he still got when he walked through Diagon Alley. He didn’t hear the curses people spit at him when he tried to go into some shops. People hadn’t forgotten, they didn’t see.
Draco scoffed. “If they want to publish something by a Malfoy.”
“Of course,” Draco replied.
Harry smiled, then crawled into Draco’s lap and wiped the remnants away for Harry before placing a long, slow kiss to his mouth. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, holding him close and content to make out in the early afternoon sun.
“Not a fun story, really. My Aunt and Uncle treated me like their personal maid. Dudley—that’s my cousin—and his friends all used me as their punching bag. A few times I used accidental magic, but I convinced myself that it was just making it up to cope or something.”
required for first year Hogwarts students was outdated and unhelpful.
, Draco thought desperately when Harry licked behind his ear. His hands found their way into Harry’s waistband, fumbling to undo the belt.
“About what?”
Harry started kissing down Draco’s jawline, through the tiniest bit of morning stubble he’d not yet had a chance to shave off. He nipped at Draco’s earlobe and said huskily, “I had meant to do this last night…”
My beta commented that seven pints is an awful lot, but after some discussion, I kept it. Around New Orleans, where I'm from, that's pretty normal. I don't really condone drinking that much, clearly it makes you do dumb things (I'm looking at you Malfoy).
“You’re right in that assumption, Potter.”
“My mother took it pretty well, too, actually,” Draco said, remembering the look Narcissa had given him across the dinner table when he told her he didn’t ever want to find a wife. She’d slowly swallowed her food and then nodded. The next time they’d talked about his responsibilities as heir, she’d just said ‘if’ instead of when. Draco considered that the best he’d get.
Short, but important.
He watched her fly out of the garden before looking down at the letter. There was nothing written on the outside. He broke the seal and unfolded it.
“You may not know, but Professor Zouch will be retiring at the end of this year. I know you don’t have teaching experience, but I think you will be the best replacement for the job. If you’ll take it.” She added that last bit, possibly realizing it sounded more like an order than a request.
Just then, Harry made his way into the kitchen. He glanced at Draco, who nodded towards the paper. Skimming the article, Harry rolled his eyes.
“I can manage myself, Potter.”
Draco was busy writing when Harry arrived at the cafe. Sitting down with his meal, Harry craned his neck a bit to try and catch a glimpse of what Draco was writing.
“Yeah?”
“We’d like to offer you a publication contract, Mr. Malfoy. But there are certain terms and conditions we hope you’ll agree to.” Mrs. Davies slid the contract across the desk to Draco.
“What?” Harry tried to stop him, but Draco was already to the stage, muttering something to the DJ.
“Sorry…” He started nibbling at the bacon, partly for something to do and partly because he hadn’t had any real food in ages.
Draco eyed Harry, then nodded and sat.
“No, actually I was going to ask if you wanted to grab some take out and eat at your place?” Harry looked hopeful.
She looked gorgeous in her white dress. Neville seemed nervous to be dancing in front of so many people, but Hannah whispered something to him and he seemed to calm down.
he thought. Figuring it the perfect opportunity to get himself out of the house, Draco decided to run out to the shops and buy Harry more tea.
“They didn’t want it,” Draco sighed. Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco continued. “Well, they said they did, even offered me a contract. But they wanted practically everything changed, wanted to add other people’s names to it so I wouldn’t get the full writing credit, and offered me fuck all for compensation.”
The sun was streaming through the windows, casting that seemingly ever-present golden glow over Harry.
he thought,
“I thought you might be hungry,” Harry said, running his hand through his hair and holding up a bag.
“So I decided to work my way through the 80 types alphabetically.”
As he finished the song, he paused before looking to see Harry’s reaction, bracing himself.
"There’s a muggle parking lot back that way,” Harry said, pointing in one direction. “We are going this way.” Harry hid the brooms behind some bushes and started down the path.
“How did you know where…” Draco trailed off as Harry was still talking about which flavors should and shouldn’t be mixed, how some were sweet and some spicy, some went better over rice, and there was even a place that had curry pastries.
After a while, Harry stood from his chair and walked to Draco’s. He put his hands on each armrest and whispered into Draco’s ear, “Right now, I want to do you.”
“I’d say sorry, Draco, but I don’t think you want me to be.”
“Yes,” Harry half whispered. There was something in his eyes now that Draco couldn’t read. Friends tell each other secrets. They had talked about their troubles and their trauma almost in passing over the last few months. But this conversation hard gone to the heart of it all. Like they now understood each other.
The sky above them was a stunning shade of blue, with small clouds dusting above. It was an unusually sunny day for spring in England, but Draco was glad for it. The wind caught them both and Draco looked over at Harry, hair blowing around his face and smiling peacefully with his eyes closed. Like he was trying to breathe as much of this air as possible.
Draco was in a private box for the Quidditch World Cup, joined by some of the Weasley’s and Teddy.
“Agatha came back without an answer, so I wasn’t sure…” Harry was running his hand through his hair, nervous.
The morning passed slowly, and it was getting close to when Harry usually left.
Draco thought. The conversation quickly turned to his (lack of) dating life, much to Draco’s chagrin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, well.” Harry ran his hand through his hair and shrugged. It was a nervous thing he did, Draco noted, any time the conversation turned to his life. “It was a lot of politics. I was a glorified figurehead. They just wanted The Chosen One to show off at political events.”
He straightened his suit and took a deep breath, preparing himself for a night of Pansy. He loved her dearly, but she was a lot to handle in large doses.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Serves Dudley right, I think,” Draco said, finishing the hot chocolate. He frowned into his mug, not realizing he was so close to being done, and set it on the side table.
“It’s okay, Draco. When you’re ready. I want to hear them.” Harry smiled and stood. “As much as I’d love to stay, I promised Hermione I’d help Ron set up the baby’s crib.”
Draco was setting and resetting the cheese tray when Harry came into the kitchen, grabbed his hand, and led him to the drawing room. He sat down in Draco’s chair and pulled Draco to his lap.
“Nott.”
“Yes, but I’m afraid you aren’t as young as you once were. And you’ll probably already regret all this in the morning,” Harry said, steering Draco towards the door.
“Hmm,” Draco responded as Harry excitedly went back up to the counter to stare at the menu.
“Oh, hi guys.” Harry glanced over at Draco, then stood to greet his friends. Draco knew from Pansy that Harry had told his friends he was seeing someone, but she’d also said they weren’t sure who.
“Yes. Most of the time it’s the melody that will get stuck in my head first, and the lyrics will come later. The lyrics almost feel like letters,” Draco paused. “You’d mentioned writing letters helped.”
Draco nodded. Harry smiled and gave a sort of wave as he collected his food and sat on the armchair near the door.
Finally, Harry walked through the door, sending a little wave to Draco before going to order.
“I am relaxed.” Draco sat up a little straighter.
Draco snorted.
Draco had ordered an aged scotch when they’d first arrived, but Harry had brought him a pint when he’d finished, telling him it was two for one.
They walked up the aisle and stood at the front of the church. The wedding march played and Draco vaguely remembered thinking how beautiful Pansy looked in her dress.
“I wrote it about us.”
“Of course,” Harry breathed, relaxing as if he was trying to figure out how to ask Draco to play.
“Oh. Well then, that should definitely make your boyfriend jealous,” he said, winking and turning to stand with some other guests.
“What did you do?” Draco asked.
“You know, Draco, it’s your turn next,” Blaise winked.
Draco thought to himself. Smiling and drinking in the sight, he decided to figure it out another time.
But that's nonsense. It's not like they were friends or even acquaintances. They hadn't even really talked, for fuck's sake. They were merely former classmates, former enemies. Of course, Potter wouldn't go out of his way to continue this little routine. It had just been a coincidence that they were at the cafe at the same time for several days in a row. Draco put it out of his head as best he could.
Draco was loathe to admit it to Harry, but it had been helping. He was working through a lot of issues, sorting through his emotions and thoughts much easier than when it was all in his head.
Harry smiled and waved Draco over. He stood as Draco approached the table, sheepishly running a hand through his hair. There are two mugs of hot chocolate and two plates—a chocolate croissant and a blueberry muffin.
Draco thought warmly.
Draco watched Potter acting normally.
“Can I play you something?”
“…we are both so glad that you all could come and are incredibly thankful to have each of you in our lives.” Lifting his glass higher, Harry finished, “May your troubles be less and your blessings be more, and nothing but happiness come through your door.”
He also wanted to show Harry the flat. He’d helped pick it, after all. But Draco wasn’t sure how Harry would react if he asked. They hadn’t really talked about what they were to each other. Were they friends now? It was okay to ask a friend over to your house, right? He’d had Blaise, Pansy and Nott over for champagne when he’d closed.
Harry studied him for a moment. “I’ve been okay. Started up Quidditch practices early with a couple of teammates, trying to pass some time.”
“What happened between you and the Weaslette?” Draco asked, using the old nickname he’d called her back at Hogwarts, though without any of the hate behind it.
“You’re going to get a lot of questions over the next couple of days, Potter.”
He played
“Two trips are for losers?”
“You should put a bench or a swing out here.”
Draco’s fingers practically itched with the song. He gave once last look out at the canyon—their canyon—and apparated to where they’d stashed the brooms. Grabbing both from the bushes, he held on tight and apparated back home, setting the brooms down in favor of his guitar.
Draco climbed on top of Harry, straddling him and fitting their penises to rub together and starting up a steady rhythm. He wrapped his hand around as much of both of them as he could manage. Harry quickly added his own hand. He immediately found Harry’s lips again, kissing him like he’d been doing it for years.
“…and mum thinks she’s dropped, which means she might go into labor soon,” Ginny was saying excitedly.
“You got any tea?” he asked.
Draco rolled his eyes and started to get up, grabbing his wand from the bedside table. He summoned some trousers and a long sleeved shirt, turning to Harry as he got dressed. “Right then, the fridge is practically empty. I’ll pop in somewhere and grab some food.”
“We had practice early this morning and I didn’t think I had time to shower before coming here,” Harry replied guiltily.
"It's nothing. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?" Harry asked hopefully.
Harry shuffled up to the stage where Draco was checking his guitar. “Can I have the first dance?”
“Draco…” he breathes. He looks up into Draco’s eyes and Draco sees the sorrow. But he’s already long forgiven Harry for using that spell on him. He was protecting himself, and Draco deserved it. And it was a reminder of who he’d been and who he had become now.
Harry huffed and plopped down onto his chair, grumbling something to himself that Draco couldn’t quite make out. This Harry—angry Harry—reminded Draco of year’s past.
As he leaned down to pick them up, he heard his wards chime. Someone was coming up the path to the doorstep.
“And you gave it all for them,” Draco added, remembering their conversation months ago about how Harry had died that night. Every now and then Draco would have a nightmare, imagining that he was there in that forest. Sometimes imaging that it was his wand who threw the killing curse. He would always wake up abruptly from those nightmares, wishing he could touch Harry to convince himself it was just a dream.
Draco was making his way back down the street to his flat, still humming. Almost home, what he saw was not at all what he expected. There, on his doorstep, was Harry Potter.
The song is Meet Me In The Hallway by Harry Styles.
Somehow, he made his way inside and up the stairs. He landed on his bed fully clothed, and within seconds was out.
Draco realized what she was about to say.
Draco was stunned by the words. ‘
Draco was burning holes in the back of Harry’s head. In the corner of his eye, he caught Ginny’s wide, knowing smile. Ron started to say something.
Draco knew he shouldn’t have kissed Harry like that, not in public. What was worse was that Harry would have easily forgiven it, but then Draco had to go and say all of that. Accuse Harry of using him for sex, of hiding him and hiding their relationship.
“Better now that she’s gone home. I think mum was driving her mad. You know how she gets,” fire Ginny grinned and Harry huffed a laugh.
The second song is Lights Up by Harry Styles.
If he had, what did he think when Draco never showed up? And worse, what if he hadn’t even gone?
“Yeah, that. Isn’t it delicious? Like a donut, but better.” Harry waited for Draco to agree, looking expectant.
Draco adjusted his suit jacket.
“Well, thank you for this meeting. I hope you’re well, my condolences to hear about your father. Please pass along my greetings to Harry.” She stood up, handing Draco a letter.
After what felt like an uncomfortable amount of time, Harry pointed at the guitar in the corner. “Do you play?”
"Yeah, I guess. But I don't know, everyone already knows what happened. I just needed something to do. To get it off my chest. You should try it."
"I hope I'm not being too presumptuous, but I figured since we're usually here at the same time, you might want to sit together?" Harry rushed out.
They ate together and talked. About music, about their friends. Harry told Draco the whole story of the previous night and of Rose, the newest red-headed Weasley.
“I know, I just…” Draco wasn’t sure why he was so nervous. This was the first time most of their friends would see Draco’s flat, and the first time anyone would see it since Harry had moved in a week ago. They’d decided to host a housewarming/New Year’s Eve party.
"Oi, my standards are just fine, thank you," Harry countered. "Maybe yours are just too high."
, he thought, smirking.
There were whispers running through the crowd that Harry Potter was there, and people started to turn and crane their necks.
“Mr. Malfoy, you seem to have done rather well for yourself since you left Hogwarts,” she said as she added sugar to her tea and stirred.
Memories of the previous night came back to him. Pints, karaoke, kissing Harry. Yelling at Harry.
“Did the English Oak Queen Anne phatooey look good in the morning room?” Harry teased as Draco came in at the end of the week.
The song started and Draco did indeed sing. He’d never done karaoke before, but he quite liked the small crowd in front of him dancing and drinking and singing along.
Angry at himself and still feeling awful, Draco rolled back over and fell back asleep. Avoiding everything seemed like the best course of action at the moment.
“Well if you won’t dance with me, Potter, I’m going to sing,” Draco put his drink down and stood.
“Please, Merlin no.” Draco cringed. “Mother plays that trifle constantly at the Manor. I used to put a silencing charm around my room to get some reprieve.”
“Feels a bit…” Harry trailed off. “Obscene, really. You fucking me and leaving.” He made a face at Draco.
Harry grabbed Draco’s elbow hard. He practically dragged him out of the alley and down the next block to the apparition point. Draco could tell he was seething, magic crackling around them.
Draco closed his eyes.
After finishing their drinks, they’d pick a place to grab some takeout and bring it back to one of their places. Sometimes they’d pop into a grocers and grab some things to cook. They always did the cooking at Draco’s flat, afraid of Kreacher since he’d caught them using a sauce pot to boil eggs.
Draco was surprised. “Thank you, Minerva. That means a lot, especially from you.”
They sat in their chairs, sipping on their warm drinks and listening to several Queen albums, commenting on lines that stood out and drifting into natural conversation. When it was getting close to supper time, Harry stood up and stretched.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco said, knowing that word wasn’t quite enough.
"Thank you," Draco said, motioning toward the empty mug of hot chocolate in front of him.
“I was trying to play it cool, so I took a page from your book. Halfway through the first song I wanted to jump you. Anyway, you want to go to the Beachwood? We can still make it there for our usual.”
“Draco, darling, is that you?” Pansy called from the drawing room.
“I always wondered if you two were an item.”
But Draco was just as guilty of all that, wasn’t he? He hadn’t told his friends, his mother about Harry. He hadn’t asked what they were, hadn’t defined their relationship. In essence, he was using Harry for sex and way to pass the time. Except that wasn't what Harry was to him.
, Draco thought.
He reached to shake Draco’s hand, “Malfoy.”
Harry rolled his eyes and started rummaging through cabinets. His shirt lifted at the waist some when he reached up, and Draco quickly looked away.
“Relax, it’s just friends and family Draco,” Harry soothed, running a hand up Draco’s back and kissing his temple.
wants
“Wouldn’t want someone to see Precious Potter with a filthy Death Eater. Wouldn’t want the world to know who you’ve been fucking for the last few months.”
Finally, she sat in the other chair and sighed. “Draco…”
Draco stared. “What are you doing?
“Right then, who the bloody hell is coming here…” Draco muttered to himself, checking his watch as he reached for the door.
“Mmm,” was all Draco could think to answer with. Harry’s mouth was on his neck, sucking right where his pulse beat through. Harry’s hand had now worked its way under Draco’s shirt, feeling his lean stomach and side, tracing the v of his abdominals.
Yay for double posting again. It was written, so why not?
“Mind side-alonging me?” Harry asked, shifting the packages in his hands.
As Draco walked in the kitchen he noticed several things at once.
“Come off it, Pans, I’m allowed to go out.”
“Yeah,” Harry answered warily. “What of it?”
Draco spent the next few hours reading and running his hands through Harry’s hair. Sometimes he would pause at a chapter and just watch Harry breathing. He wondered about their times at Hogwarts, if they could have been friends. He wondered why they were now, all things considered. But he was glad for it and made a decision to treasure these moments. He tried not to think about how things would be if they could tell their friends about their relationship.
his eyes shot open and he reached for his wand, eyes trying to adjust to the darkness.
“I’m so proud of you, Draco,” she had said during dessert.
… Draco wondered briefly if his father had written to him.
Draco helped Blaise straighten his tie, then handed the cufflinks to Theo. There was a knock on the door, so Draco answered. “Five minutes, boy,” Pansy’s cousin told them.
Draco reread the short note.
That last bit though, that's some good shit. In case you don't recognize it, it's basically an imitation of their very first (book) meeting at Madam Malkin's before first year started.
“Oh.” Harry seemed to be thinking this over, reevaluating what he knew of her.
And third, Harry was also boiling water. There was a second cup and a box of tea next to him on the counter. Draco didn’t own tea. Harry had brought his own box of tea to Draco’s. Harry wanted to make sure there was tea in Draco’s flat for when he came over. Harry intended to be here enough to constitute bringing his own box of tea.
Draco stood to walk Harry to the door so he could apparate. “Of course. Thank you.”
“Harry.”
Harry grinned at him and shot forward. Not one to be outdone, Draco caught up quickly and they raced north.
Draco mused.
Harry picked up a handful of floo powder, turned to Draco and said, “Thank you, Draco, for everything today.” He threw the powder into the fireplace, stepped inside, spoke his destination, and was gone.
But not before turning to Draco with a quick, "Hope you're well."
“Yeah, that’s right Harry!” Draco whooped.
Draco paced back and forth all morning. He’d worked a small line in the grass of the garden, so he moved to the morning room. But he didn’t want Harry to catch him pacing should he arrive suddenly in the fireplace. So he moved to the kitchen.
“A bit stronger than that.”
Draco caught Blaise’s eye and snickered, quite happy to not be in Blaise’s shoes right now.
He stood from his chair and picked up his manuscript. “Well then Ms. Bates, I think we’re done here.” Trying to remain as composed as possible, he refrained from slamming the doors on his way out, but the candy jar on Ms. Bates desk shattered from a stray bit of accidental magic.
Harry quirked his eyebrow and shifted in his seat. “Is there something on my face?” he asked, wiping at his mouth.
“Mmmm,” he mumbled, closing his eyes and breathing in Draco. “Molly’s planning some big to do for Ginny tonight and shooed us all away as soon as lunch was done. Didn’t want to wait until this evening to see you.”
?” Harry asked.
Draco took a few minutes to remember exactly what he’d said to Harry. He grimaced, remembering how angry Harry looked.
“So it
“Otherwise spoken for?” Pansy asked.
Draco answered the questions of several different people, including what looked to be some Hogwarts students, a few parents, and a reporter. One woman asked about him and Harry, the other women around her sniggering. Draco blushed and just said that they were friends and former classmates.
Harry Potter hadn't noticed Draco in the corner yet as he ordered his food.
Draco closed his eyes back, and laid his head on the chair back.
, he thoughts as he stepped under the water.
There, near the door, was Harry Potter. “Mr. Malfoy, can you tell us what helped you most during your writing process? You know, in case any of us want to write a book of our own.” He had a twinkle in his eye as he asked.
They decided to celebrate by flying together to High Cup Nick. It was just as beautiful as Draco had remembered, with the wildflowers and rolling hills. They had eaten and then napped under the warmth of the sun.
Draco made sure to point out the marshmallows, smiling as Harry added them to the pile.
His mind was already humming a new melody, shifting from the sadness of his last song to the hope he now felt.
“I would never, Draco. I’d at least sell the information to the highest bidder.” She grinned, eyes full of mirth. “Can I at least have a hint?”
“You did. And I didn’t help.” Draco thought back to that year, the desperate hoping he could get out of the task Voldemort had given him. Save his own life, save his family’s lives. He kept thinking maybe he could be better.
Glancing again at the article, Draco smiled slightly at the picture of he and Harry.
He reached for a box that looked vaguely like he remembered and headed to the till.
As Harry said it, they made it to the top of the hill and Draco sucked in a breath.
He heard a soft thud from above him, then the sound of footsteps down the stairs.
“Yes.” Harry grinned. “I remember thinking it was stunning, and we even came back while hunting for horcruxes. Despite being on the run, I felt at peace that night. So now I just come here when I need a break from it all.”
Draco always sat at the same table, next to the fireplace but with a decent view of Diagon Alley. He had ordered a hot chocolate and a chocolate croissant, as he did every day. His mother would not approve of that much sweet in one meal, but really, one could never have too much chocolate. Today he made notes in the margins of the quarterly potions journal he subscribed to, trying to flesh out a first draft for a Potions textbook. The poorly written
“Oh dear, I’m out of pins. I’ll pop to the back, one moment Mr. Malfoy.” She ran off quickly, winking at Harry on her way out.
Draco sat up and scooted forward to the edge of the bed, grabbing Harry’s hips as he stood. Still locked in a gaze, Harry lowered himself to his knees, pulling the pajama bottoms off of Draco. One hand grabbed Draco’s now bare ass, and the other confidently wrapped around his cock. Looking up to watch Draco’s face, he lazily gave a few tugs.
“Tea?”
Draco read the letter, then read through it again.
Draco stared for a moment before quickly wiping the shock from his face and remembering his manners. He stepped aside to let Harry through.
“Harry, I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered.
“What?” Harry sat up, confused.
“Damnit Malfoy!” Harry cursed from the kitchen of Draco’s flat.
Draco lifted his head to look at Harry through the mirror, eyes bright. “Yes,” he responded, echoing Harry’s answer.
Draco had played
, he thought. He glanced at his watch.
“I was thinking…I know we’ve been seeing each other for ages, but…” Harry trailed off.
"Chocolate makes me feel better." Draco wasn't sure why he said it. It was the truth, he had started enjoying chocolate during the war when Voldemort had taken up at the Manor because they reminded him of Hogwarts. At some point, it had just become routine to order a hot chocolate.
Draco wasn’t sure he had the answers.
, Draco thought.
“Draco, that’s not…” Harry started.
Draco could hear the words behind what Harry said aloud.
“About damn time.”
Guitar and drums started playing.
Draco rolled out of bed and made his way to the bathroom to shower, wondering how today would go. Would Harry say anything? Would it go back to normal or be awkward?
Harry leaned in to kiss him, then grabbed a coffee to go. He was headed to practice early. “Maybe I’ll at least make it interesting for them next time,” he grinned, then made his way out of the room before Draco could ask him what he intended to do.
Draco nodded into Harry’s shoulder, letting out another small sob and squeezing his eyes shut. Harry held him tighter.
Draco tucked the letter from Harry into his notebook full of lyrics. He then tore out a blank page and wrote back to Harry.
“It has an unfinished loft you could convert into a lab, plus it’s half the price you were looking at.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His thoughts wandered to how Harry had looked when Draco had pulled away. His swollen lips, his half-dazed eyes. The way he’d stared at Draco, seeing him.
They spent the rest of the night dancing under the stars.
"...should start thinking about settling down," Narcissa was saying. He'd heard this speech a thousand times. Find a wife and produce an heir, proudly carry on the family name. Though there wasn't too much left of that, no thanks to his father's choice of side during the wars. And since his father had been carted off to Azkaban, his mother even seemed okay with the idea of him finding a husband after he’d mentioned once that the wife part was highly unlikely.
“And what, exactly, are we going to see?” Draco asked. “Where are we?” The trees had disappeared behind them and they were steadily making their way up a grassy hill.
. Draco frowned.
The first person he wanted to tell was Harry.
“You want me to sit on the floor?” Draco asked incredulously.
“And besides, I was going a little mad with all the paperwork,” Harry grinned.
“I was wondering where you’d gotten off to,” he half whispered, coming to settle himself on Draco’s armrest. He kissed Draco and then nervously ran his hand through his hair. “What are you doing down here?”
The others made their way from the box, heading to the Burrow for the celebration party. “I’ll be along in a bit, going to find Harry,” Draco told Hermione as they left.
Song is Adore You by Harry Styles.
“Sorry, right, come in.” Draco shuffled around Harry and opened the door. Heading to the kitchen he asked, “Would you like some?”
“Suit yourself,” Harry replied with a shrug.
I originally rated this fanfic as Mature, and feel as if the rest of the story (not including this chapter) would still be considered Mature. However, as this chapter contains an explicit sex scene, I've decided to up the rating to Explicit. I find the line between "Mature" and "Explicit" is rather blurry, so I'm erring on the side of caution.
Just then, Harry opened his eyes and looked up at Draco, catching him staring. He quirked his eyebrow slightly and grinned.
They all chuckled at that.
The next morning Harry scoffed at the paper. Right underneath the article on the front page about the Falcons’ win was a story of him and Draco. There was a picture of the two of them at the after party, standing close. There were also a few pictures taken from their outings over the last few weeks.
“Hey yourself. What did you bring me?”
After Harry and Draco finished their food, Harry said, “Come see.” He nodded his head towards the back of the house, taking the packages and leading Draco to the morning room.
Draco loved watching Harry fly. He remembered racing him months ago on their way to High Cup, and the happiness he showed when on a broom.
Slipping on shoes, Draco made his way out the front door. He didn’t use the front entrance often, he realized. He turned up the street, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking towards the shops, humming as he went.
He was trying very hard to convince himself, but he knew it wasn’t working.
Draco was torn between trying to decide if that meant Harry was enjoying these meetings and trying not to stare at his sweaty, obviously just-worked-out form.
, he thought. In front of him was a canyon, seemingly out of nowhere. It cut a u-shape through the ground, which practically dropped out from under them. Rocks and grass and wildflowers ran down to meet at a small river, meandering through the valley.
Draco thought about what Harry said. Could he do anything he wanted to?
Harry glanced at his watch. "Shit, yeah, sorry. Team practice in a few. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?" Harry asked as he put on his jacket and tucked his notebook away.
Draco grinned. “Thank you for your question, Mr. Potter. I think what helped most was hot chocolate and an annoying friend.”
, Draco thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sure there was plenty of dark magic sewn into the wards that you’ll never be rid of that feeling. I’m afraid the Manor is the same,” Draco said, sitting opposite Harry. “Sometimes I can see feel Voldemort there, evil walking through the halls.”
“No.” Draco answered almost too fast. “I don’t think I...” he trailed off, not sure what to say.
He took a sip of his tea, hiding his grimace at the taste behind a well-composed face.
So neither of them had had the opportunity to prove to each other that they really wanted to start over. Until now.
The song Draco karaoke's is Juice by Lizzo. Not quite the right time frame for when this story takes place and when the song came out, but I saw a video of Harry Styles singing it and thought it would be funny to add in
Picture-Harry was laughing at something Draco had just said, and picture-Draco turned to look at him, smiling. Draco could see every ounce of love in his eyes, the raw emotion conveyed through the tiny black and white magical loop.
"Anything really. Nothing. Sometimes I just write to write. After the... well, after. Someone recommended I write. So, I started writing letters to my mum. Just got things off my chest. Then to Sirius and my dad. Hermione said I should consider writing my side of what happened."
Harry gave him an odd look. “Yeah, a flat… How are you Luna?” Harry asked.
Draco went to stand in front of Harry, then gently placed his hands on Harry’s jawline and kissed him slowly.
“Theo’s asked me to marry him,” Pansy said, smiling broadly and holding out her hand with the engagement ring she’d been hiding.
“Come on Harry!” Hermione yelled next to Draco. Ron looked like he was turning green with anticipation. He’d whispered to Draco earlier he placed a rather large bet on Harry catching the snitch and hadn’t yet told Hermione how much.
“Potter?” Draco called. He’d just stepped through the floo into Grimmuald Place, unsure of where Harry was or even what part of the house he was in.
“I purchased the Beachwood.”
This time, it was Draco looking into Harry’s eyes when they looked up. “I didn’t know.” Harry was not only the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived, the Prophet’s favorite subject. But he had given his life for the wizarding world.
“Well, obviously. Whatever it is, fix it.”
“You know, all this free media attention would probably help sales of your new line,” Draco suggested.
This is the epilogue to Beachwood Cafe. It's written as twelve snippets of Draco and Harry's life following the end of the story.
Draco’s hands were back in that unruly black hair, determined to make that just-shagged look all his doing this time. Their kissing was getting more desperate, Draco’s hands making their way down Harry’s taunt shoulders to firmly grasp his ass.
Draco turned the heat up more as if he could steam away his problem.
Draco groaned and closed his eyes. Harry took that opportunity to tweak Draco’s nipple. “Potter,” Draco practically growled.
Draco smiled. He set his wand back down on the bedside table and rubbed the sleep from his face.
Draco could feel himself tensing, preparing for the day of questions and accusations. And this was just saying they were friends, nothing more.
After an hour or so of surprisingly comfortable silence, where Draco somehow actually managed to get a decent start on the chapter about the relationship between Potions and Herbology, Harry checked his watch and started to pick up his things.
“Yeah.”
Draco’s mind returned to the song he’d written the day after the incident. He gave Agatha an owl treat and asked her to stay so he could write a response. But first, he wrote down the new pieces of the song.
, Draco thought, staring at Harry, still sitting in their booth.
The first song is part of Falling by Harry Styles (the basis of this whole story)
But he was angry. And he was drunk. So he kept going.
Draco wasn’t sure if that smile should make him feel at ease or more uncomfortable.
“Harry, get your ass to St. Mungo’s! Hermione’s having the baby!” Ron’s voice called with a mixture of excitement and panic.
“Hmm,” Draco supplied, wondering if that would be enough.
His hands were running up and down Harry’s chest and sides, memorizing the muscles and lines and scars.
“I’m sure I could,” Draco handed a stack of papers to Harry. “You’ll have to help, of course. I don’t think I need get my hands dirty tearing down wallpaper.”
Draco pulled Harry a bit closer.
“It’s nothing,” Harry said.
They both turned to look as a loud sound came from behind them. A Jack Russell terrier patronus was running towards them.
All songs named are by Harry Styles and were used in previous chapters. I have an apple playlist of the songs if you want to listen:
“Fuck, Draco, feels so good… didn’t imagine you would be so good…” Harry grunted.
“So are you just going to mix up the coffees and teas as long as it’s alphabetical? Or complete the alphabetical coffee list then move on to tea?” Draco asked, knowing Harry hadn’t thought about that yet.
“Yes.”
By the time they arrived, they had raced and dove, flew over towns and rivers and pastures and forests. They both landed and dismounted, out of breath but with huge smiles plastered on their faces.
Harry never came to the Beachwood on Sundays, so Draco took that as an opportunity to write in peace. Lately, he’d been writing letters that he would never send, apologizing and explaining. He was working on one to Vincent. There was so much about Crabbe's life and death he felt responsible for.
Harry pulled Draco back in close, his head laying on Harry’s chest. “S’okay. You will one day,” he grinned into Draco’s hair.
"I didn't mean anything by it. I remember you were always good at Potions," said Harry. He paused, seeming to be waiting for Draco to say more. "What's with the notes then?"
Today, however, a new melody was floating in his head. Draco jotted down a few words before going back to the letter.
The Quidditch refs were there in a flash, apparating to right below the two players and stopping them mid-air. When they lowered them to the ground, Harry was running towards Wiliams, shouting something. He landed one good punch to Wiliams’ face before his teammates dragged him away.
“What’s a
He looks nice when he laughs.
Harry was quiet. They both watched as the sun lowered in the evening sky.
“Hmm,” was all Draco provided as answer, not even glancing up at her. He was busy staring a hole into the record player.
He tried to get back to the journal, he really did. But memories--and the inevitable guilt that came along with those--forced their way to the front of Draco's mind. Before he knew it, Harry was finished his meal, checking his watch, rushing to clean up his little spot, and quickly making his way out the door.
I think posting more chapters is making me write more because I have less and less stashed away. Anyway, I feel like I should remind everyone of the disclaimer that I am not British.
“You carried all that from home? Did you apparate here?” Harry asked incredulously.
“And leaving the Aurors?” Draco prodded. Harry really was likely to become the youngest head of the Auror department before he unexpectedly quit. The Ministry didn’t seem to mind that he hadn’t taken his NEWTs or gone through the two year trainee program. The Prophet talked for weeks about how the Great Harry Potter, after single-handedly defeating the Dark Lord, was stepping in to protect the wizarding public from all manner of evil.
He knew his mother still wrote to Lucius every so often, but that he rarely returned the correspondence. She had followed him into two wars, and he knew a part of her still loved Lucius despite what he’d done.
Draco thought.
For a brief moment, Harry kissed him back. And then suddenly, he was being pushed away.
“What about me?”
He was drawn from his thoughts when Blaise asked him a question.
“Türk Kahvesi and baklava. From Turkey. Apparently you’re meant to drink this coffee with the grounds. I’m not really sure how I feel about that,” Harry answered, taking a sip anyway.
He stared at Harry, whose brilliant green eyes were staring right back.
“Molly is going to freak…” Harry murmured to Draco.
Draco stepped out of Pansy’s fireplace, vanishing the ashes before she could claim they had landed on her expensive, one-of-a-kind Persian carpet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s almost 9,” Harry said.
Song is Falling by Harry Styles.
“You what?” Harry started. “It was for sale?”
“I’m thinking about buying a flat in London.”
Narcissa stopped and put her hands on Draco's arms. "I want you to be happy, darling," she said sternly.
“I’ve connected your flat to my floo on my end, would you mind if I…” Harry gestured towards Draco’s fireplace.
“She’s bringing some guy over to meet everyone. Bless him really, I remember how that dinner went,” Harry added with a laugh.
As if Draco’s thoughts grumbled loud enough for Harry to hear, Harry quickly made his pick and ordered. The Beachwood Cafe had come up with a new marketing scheme to get more people in—Around the World in 80 Cups. There was a new cup of coffee or tea to try from 80 different places around the world, and for some god forsaken reason, Harry had insisted he try them all.
Draco woke before the sun the next morning. He lay in bed staring at his ceiling for a while, trying to pull the last memories of his dream back to him before they slipped away completely.
And he was itching to pick up his guitar and work on some melodies that were floating around in his head.
After she ordered, she walked over to their table. “Hello Harry. Hello Draco. I was just on my way to guest lecture at Hogwarts about the Crumple-Horned Snorkack for the fourth years. Odd seeing you two here together,” Luna said matter-of-fact.
Since then, Draco had practically become a recluse from most wizarding society, stalking the halls of the Manor for months before finally deciding to try and make something of his new life. Potions was where Draco's heart lay, and so he studied privately under a potions master in France for some time. Not long after getting his mastery, Draco had the idea to write a Potions textbook and had been working on it since.
“Yeah. Felt like I had a lot to be angry about.”
“Are you off with him today, then?”
He stayed firmly planted in his seat.
“Will you dance with me this time, Potter?” Draco found Harry at the bar about to get a drink. “I’m sober and promise not to make an arse of myself again.”
“Former Death Eater, Mr. Malfoy. And if any parents should have issue with it, they can speak to me directly.” She sounded like she had made up her mind. And Draco shuttered to think about anyone standing in McGonagall’s way once she’d decided on something. She had rebuilt Hogwarts after the war and had a zero tolerance policy for pureblood supremacy ideals or bullying.
thought Draco grumpily, adding ‘buy drapes’ to his mental to-do list. He reached for his wand and cast a tempus spell.
Draco waited patiently, letting Harry soak in the attention that he seemed to be enjoying for once. Harry was still in his uniform, covered in sweat and mud and grim from the grueling game. His right knuckles were bruised and his left hand still held the snitch, but he was smiling from ear to ear.
Draco thought.
Draco glanced over at Harry who was smiling and waiting for Draco to apparate them away. He searched Harry’s eyes for a moment, trying to find something to give away a change, a reason they weren’t sitting at their table at the Beachwood.
“Well, it's our anniversary. And I got you something. It’s kind of big, but I think it’s a good investment…” Draco trailed off.
“Do you have a favorite?” Harry asked.
Draco left Hogwarts with a bemused smile on his face.
“Oh, great. Right, well, I have team pictures today and forgot to shave,” shrugging and touching his jawline.
My beta's reaction when she read this: "That KISS. DAMN. And then they just DONT TALK ABOUT IT!"
“It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Neville Longbottom!” Lee Jordan’s voice boomed with his sonorus spell. The guests applauded as Neville led Hannah onto the dance floor.
“Yeah. Like Agatha Christie? The murder mystery novelist?” Harry smirked. “She’s muggle, I’m not surprised…”
He turned and looked at the empty space beside him in the bed where Harry had been the morning before.
“It took a while for me to decide which records you needed first,” he grinned.
“I'm fine, Pans,” he cut her off.
They all give their congratulations and ‘I told you so’s’, and Ron mutters what sounds suspiciously like ‘ferret,’ but is smiling too.
Draco thought fondly, heart finally slowing back down to a normal pace.
The air was full of congratulations and handshakes and happiness.
Draco almost stopped as soon as he opened the door, wavering slightly and trying to keep his expression neutral. There, at his table, was Harry Potter.
“Mr. Malfoy, while I agree that the contents of your book are important to the discourse of the modern Potions world, I simply cannot offer you more than what’s in that contract before you,” Ms. Bates told Draco flatly, shutting off any further complaints from him.
"I'm writing a textbook. Or at least trying to. I doubt any publishers will want to associate themselves with a Malfoy. But the research gives me something to do, keeps my mind focused."
I've gone back and edited Chapters 1-4 to have all of Draco's thoughts appear in italics now. I find it's easier to read. No other changes though.
He hadn't seen that face, that unruly mop of hair, those round glasses in over three years. Except in the Prophet, of course. They were never short on articles about Harry's life (or what they imagined it was as he seemed to keep fairly private) that they liked to pass off as "journalism."
“Then yes. Can’t have someone else falling in love with you singing ‘blame it on my juice’.” Harry’s eyes twinkled and he held his hand out for Draco’s to take.
“No, I’ll get all this. You brought dinner,” Draco shooed Harry away from the table. Harry looked like he was just about to say thank you when Draco flicked his wand and the dishes flew into the sink and stacked themselves to be cleaned later.
“You’ve got this, Malfoy,” Harry said.
“This is casual, it’s not black and I don’t have a waistcoat on,” Draco piped back.
“Yeah. They hated everything to do with the wizarding world. Including me.”
“Harry, go. Apparate. I’ll handle the brooms,” Draco calmly. He could see the excitement and panic starting on Harry.
“No, of course not.” Harry smiled and knelt in front of the fireplace.
“Yes, Pans,” Draco answered, making his way to the drawing room before she came to drag him there. He leaned down and kissed her cheek. “How are you?”
Draco stopped a few feet away from the steps. “Harry?”
Draco was pulled from his thoughts as the barista called out that Harry's black coffee and omelet were ready. He realized he must have been staring, as Harry was staring back with half amusement and half questioning on his face.
Harry leaned casually against the wall, just out of Draco’s view in the mirrors. He was admiring the sight before him. His fiancé. His love. And he was taken back to all those years ago, struck with the memory that this was the first place they met.
Draco’s thoughts were centered on Harry. He’d kissed him. Harry had kissed back. But then he didn’t mention it again the rest of the night, carrying on as if nothing had happened. But he did stay, didn’t run screaming from Draco’s flat.
Harry and Draco sat together every morning that week. Some days Harry was waiting for Draco at his table—
Draco gave Harry a small smile, then turned to get two mugs. He filled one with boiling water and one with boiling milk, wondering the if this whole day was going to feel so awkward.
“God, no, Potter. Keep that on your side of the table.”
They both lay in the grass on the edge of the canyon, staring up at the stars. Today was one year since their “official” first date at the Beachwood when Harry had announced to his friends that they were dating.
“What do you want to do?” Harry gave him an odd look. “It’s not that hard a question, Potter.”
Draco pulled a sock from the lampshade and looked over at Harry, sprawled out across the bed naked, taking up more space that should be possible. His hair was damp, stuck to his forehead.
Draco and Neville had long since finished their drinks but were still happily discussing the finer details of the store. Neville had decided to start his own magical plants shop, selling all kinds of different plants and herbs useful to wizards for potions and other uses. He’d asked Draco a potions-related question one day and the two became fast friends.
3 o’clock rolled around and Draco woke Harry from his sleep.
All of them seemed to pause, looking back and forth between Harry and Draco and the table set with two drinks and all their work. It would have been comical had Draco’s heart not stopped with worry, mind racing to find some sort of excuse, some sort of lie.
“Oh?” Harry asked, stirring his half-empty and probably already cold tea.
Draco rushed to the window, recognizing the bird he’d rented at the post office in Diagon.
