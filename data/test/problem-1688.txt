“I’m glad you were able to get that job,” Harry said earnestly. “Do you know where you’re gonna start with lessons?” Charlie shrugged, finally swallowing his mouthful of food.
Harry’s reply was affirmative, even though most of it was muffled by Draco’s chest.  Draco climbed out of the bed and quickly got dressed in presentable clothes. Harry wolf-whistled appreciatively when Draco swapped his pajama pants for trousers.
“That warms my heart, Potter,” Draco teased and Harry flipped him off. They finished their butterbeers just as the clock chimed four.
“Good! Five points to Hufflepuff. There’s no specific wand movement, so once you know the word ‘riddikulus’ you know the spell,” Several students muttered the word to themselves. The cabinet containing the boggart rattled violently, tipping over. Harry barely managed to levitate the cabinet before it crashed on the ground. He righted it and placed a steadying charm on it.
“He’s annoying as hell,” Harry said, and Draco snorted. “Like, seriously,  you’re twelve, now shut up and do your work,” Draco had stopped cleaning and mimicked Harry, sitting back on his heels.
“He does it at the most random times,” Harry replied, leaning back in his chair and propping his feet on his desk. “He can pass out in five seconds at any point of the day
Bored, Harry found himself back in his classroom behind his desk. He scanned over the bookshelf in his classroom until he saw the black and gold book Narcissa had given him. He hadn’t even opened it yet, being too busy with packing.
“And with that final announcement, let the feast begin!” Chatter broke out yet again as food appeared on all of the tables and students and teachers alike began piling their plates high.
“Well, yeah, but that was almost two weeks ago. Plus there’s only one place I can get them and I need more for my personal stash,” Harry argued.
“Let’s move on to nonverbal offensive charms. We’ll start with the blasting curse. Sound good?” He got general hums of agreement. “I still want you guys shielding, but instead of sparks, it’ll be a little bit tougher to hold, and Professor Malfoy and I will be helping,”
“Language,” Harry chided, much to the amusement of his class. Draco unscrewed it and smelled it, and his face lit up in a blush. Before Draco could start listing what it smelled like, the bell for lunch rang, and Draco quickly lidded the vial and handed it back to its owner. Once the classroom was empty, Draco turned to face Harry.
When Harry apparated in front of the Malfoy Manor, he could feel in his gut that something was different this time. Not necessarily bad, but something seemed just out of place. He knocked three times and stepped back when a house-elf swung open the door for him. He followed the house-elf into the personal dining room, where Narcissa stood with a pleasant smile on her face.
“I ended up having to use fiendfyre to try and burn this thing, and it exploded in my face!” Harry scratched the back of his neck, trying not to laugh.
“So, the first thing we should check is any gift books Harry has received from a woman with a son around his age,” Hermione said offhandedly, drumming her fingers on her chin. Draco sucked in a sharp breath, standing up so quickly his chair toppled over.
“Are you just saying that? Cause you’re welcome anywhere you’d like to go,” Harry glanced at his bed, then back to his clothes. Draco pretended not to notice.
“I’ll be sure to mention that I’m grateful to them next time I see them,” Slughorn hummed his agreement but didn’t reply.
“Oh really? How interesting, I didn’t know that,” Harry drawled, sarcasm dripping from his voice. Draco chuckled.
“That’s awesome, mate!” Ron nearly shouted while Hermione smiled warmly at the two friends sitting across from her.
“Such a high compliment from you,” came a drawling voice behind the two, and they both whipped around to see Malfoy trying but failing to hide a grin. Harry flushed brilliantly, even as McGonagall introduced Draco to the rest of the staff. She started making her way to the podium, and Harry and Draco took that as a sign to take a seat. The Great Hall fell silent and she cleared her throat.
“Where were you yesterday?” Presley was the unofficial leader of the group, and she strode purposefully into the classroom once Slughorn was gone.
“But we all thought you were the one that was telling her a bunch of stories about me,” Harry said. Draco scoffed.
“Have you started setting up your classroom?” Harry asked, using the opportunity to watch Draco’s face without being seen as weird.
“If we have enough time at the end of class, I will,” Harry extended his hand, and the girl shook it, sealing their deal. “Good thing we’re working on nonverbals and I expect this lesson will stretch very close to the bell. The girl huffed in defeat, tucking the vial into her bag and drawing her wand.
“Harry said he knew about Merlin’s warning in the book from your mum,” Draco raised an eyebrow and Harry huffed in annoyance.
“Tough luck being famous,” Harry cleared his plate and put a slice of pumpkin pie on it. “It’ll die down after they all realize that you’re not interested in pedophilia,” Harry nearly choked on his pie from his sudden laughter.
Harry had to let himself be dragged out of the pub because Draco insisted “No, I’m not going to buy the entire stock of chocolate frogs, I just like Honeydukes,”
“I remember that it took Neville ages to calm down after it. He wouldn’t leave the dorm for almost three days,” Harry said.
“I did,” Harry rolled his eyes. “But, in my defense, I was like fourteen and-” Draco stopped his sentence abruptly and Harry glanced at him curiously.
“I was just looking at my new face,” Harry called back, stepping out of the bathroom. Ron was awake now, sitting up. Madam Pomfrey stood next to Ron, hands on her hips and an annoyed expression on her face.
“You are not allowed out of this bed until dinnertime,” Harry put on his best pleading look, but she didn’t sway.
There was noise on Draco’s side of the bathroom and Harry desperately wanted his company but Harry couldn’t find the motivation to get out of his chair. He knew he scattered papers and upturned furniture in his room should be his first priority, but despite his brain yelling at him to get up, he couldn’t move. The bathroom door opened slowly and Draco walked in once he saw Harry was awake.
“We have to be back to the castle before dinner according to McGonagall. Did you hear her mention having a meeting?”
“Anytime, kiddo,” Harry replied, watching the door swing closed, and he felt strangely proud of himself for helping Adam. He sat in silence for a moment, his mood already drastically changed.
The class seemed satisfied with his performance, and he collapsed in his chair. His first class had been a success overall, even if it had left him thinking about certain things he’d rather not think about. He checked his watch again, and let his class go a couple of minutes early. He wanted a butterbeer now.
“Twenty more minutes,”  Draco said through a yawn, he still hadn’t even opened his eyes. Harry curled up next to him, draping his arm around Draco’s waist.
“I know I can’t forbid you from leaving the castle, but don’t be reckless like that. You gave everyone a scare, myself included,”
“It’s nice to see you two getting along,” He said cheerfully. Harry and Draco glanced at each other.
“Miss Muerello,” Harry said politely, already fearing her shenanigans. She was a fifth-year and a well-known snoop, rival to Pansy Parkinson, according to Draco.
“Yeah, well, so do hippogriffs,” Draco glared at Harry, who was messing with the quill Draco had set down earlier.
“I want you to start by getting into pairs and trying to cast a nonverbal shield. We’ve gone over the form multiple times, but you must remember to keep focused or your shield will fail. While you cast the shield, your partner will be casting sparks at you so we will know if your shield is efficient or not,” The room broke into a flurry of movement and conversations as people tried to get a partner and start practicing. The room soon filled with sparks, and a few successful shields.
“We will figure out how to destroy it, and once Harry gets out of the hospital wing, he can help us research,”
“Let’s go set up your classroom,” Harry put his fork on his plate with finality and pushed the plate away from him. Draco followed suit and they walked to the potions room in easy conversation.
“That’s bull,” Harry jumped when Draco whispered in his ear. “The defense classroom is easily repairable, and so is the potions,”
“If anyone can pull off that shit, it’s Granger,” Draco said, casually leaning back in his chair. He pretended not to notice the half-smile from all three of his companions. He ordered a drink.
“You owe me a date to Hogsmeade,” Harry said cheekily, starting to pull the blankets off of him. Draco managed to save one blanket and wrapped it around himself tightly.
“It’s nice to see you actually looking healthy,” Draco murmured in his ear at lunch, spearing an apple slice on his fork.
“You’re one hell of a Prince Phillip,” Draco replied, letting Harry lay nearly on top of him. Their legs were tangled together in the blanket, chests flush with one another.
“Night,” Draco said to Harry’s retreating back. Harry’s door closed, and Draco sighed, gathering his clothes and getting in the shower.
“I’ll be back after I’ve had a nap and some food,” She warned. Harry wasn’t sure it actually was a warning, but he thought it would be safe to assume it was. As soon as she had left, Harry and Draco both reached for the book. However, when it touched Draco’s hand, it started glowing red-hot and he promptly dropped it, swearing loudly.
“I don’t want you to do all this work and be disappointed. I couldn’t conjure one until the end of my fifth year and even then, most wizards can’t produce one at all,”
“I’m already going to be out of town on Hollow’s eve,” Harry said. “Since it falls on a Saturday, I’m spending the day in Godric’s Hollow,” The remainder of Harry’s sentence went without saying, and Slughorn smiled sadly.
“So like, was it the way that girls acted or how they looked? Or both?” Harry drummed his fingers on his chin.
“Nothing, let’s go,” Draco grabbed Harry’s arm as he tried to walk away. Harry sighed and turned back to face Draco. “Can we go somewhere else to get Butterbeer?”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. He grabbed Draco’s hand and apparated them both to the entrance of Hog’s Head. Draco opened the door and they both walked in, neither of them saying anything until they were seated.
“How can Miss Stormi help Mister Harry Potter?” the house-elf asked in a squeaky voice, her hands clasped behind her back.
“Er.. alright,” Harry said. He could feel his ears burning. Jason laughed, then threw Harry a wink while he got up and waited on another table nearby. As soon as he was gone, Harry picked up the napkin again and studied it. Jason definitely wasn’t a bad looking guy, and he had been nice enough to Harry. He cast another tempus charm, which revealed it to be 2:13. Harry sighed, and finished his butterbeer. He left a bigger tip than he usually did.
“Sorry guys, I’m not really allowed to tell you where I was yesterday,” Both hands dropped back down. There were a few disappointed groans. “But, I’m alive and well so we can continue lessons per usual. Unfortunately for you guys, it’s a boring lecture about healing spells and we’ll see if there’s enough time at the end to go over some basic ones,”
“Tiring. Six classes, four of them back to back,” Harry gave him a sympathetic look. “My third years were talking about Boggarts though, is that what you did?”
“What for? You haven’t even done anything to even mildly inconvenience that entire household,” Draco curiosity was piqued since Harry’s boggart wasn’t what he expected it to be.
“What the hell happened in here?” She asked, finally breaking the silence. Harry and Draco shared a look.
A house-elf greeted him quickly, despite the fact that it was much past dinnertime and it was dark outside. The elf made a plate full of meats and fruits, insisting that Harry looked “very pale and sickly,”
“I think Hermione has that spot reserved. McGonagall said she wanted her to take over the position of headmistress,” Ginny sounded cautious, gauging how Draco regarded her as she spoke.
“How are you feeling?” Hermione whispered, dog-earing her book and giving Harry her full attention. He ate an apple slice before answering.
“Riddikulus!” The boy cried, and the woman found herself clothed in Darth Vader’s armor, but pink. Harry was reminded of Umbridge. Laughter erupted from the children, and the boggart fled back into the cabinet. Harry somehow got his entire class to participate, and he didn’t have to intervene at all. He righted the desks in their proper place and let the students have the remainder of the class off. Only moments had passed before they had all unanimously agreed they wanted Harry to face the boggart himself.
“We’d be glad to,” Draco said smoothly, tucking his hand in his back pocket. McGonagall smiled proudly.
“Now, since the defense classroom is the only one undergoing such extensive repairs, I have linked the defense classroom with the potions one,” Harry felt Draco stiffen next to him. “They will both be relocated near the transfiguration room,” Harry considered for a moment, then decided he agreed mostly with her decision, except for linking potions and defense classrooms.
“Professor Potter?” Harry looked up tiredly, surprised to see one of the Ravenclaw boys he’d just dismissed standing in the doorframe, clutching his bookbag nervously.
Harry woke to sunlight streaming through his curtains and painting his room in a peaceful brightness. He got dressed and curled up in his chair, watching the pictures on his desk move. Birds sang a cheerful song outside, and Harry cracked his window open to hear it better. Despite his date last night, Harry felt content.
“I was planning on doing it for you two after everyone returned from Christmas break. But, I’ve realized that since Quidditch matches are about to start, I can’t possibly be running two houses at the same time,”
“Well that’s all fine and good, but that doesn’t excuse you for literally breaking into my room!” Harry shouted. Draco drew his wand.
When Harry was finally discharged, he apparated to Hogsmeade and nearly sprinted back to the castle, ignoring the numb pain in his lungs. He didn’t stop until he was across from McGonagall’s desk, huffing his explanation of what happened yesterday.
“I haven’t been to Hogsmeade since sixth year. I’m not welcome there,” Harry finally turned his attention to the blonde, who looked slightly embarrassed.
“Right right, what’s the name of the book?” Hermione was grinning cheekily and Draco was doing his best to act indifferent.
After several hours, Harry collapsed in his chair tiredly. He had set up enough desks to fit his largest class, and after messing around with a spell, they could be moved to the closest wall with just a wave of his hand. He also elected to ignore the fact that he had his classroom set up very similar to the way McGonagall’s was. Harry’s stomach growled loudly, and he sighed and stood in search of a snack. He walked into the kitchen and was instantly greeted by a house-elf.
“It’s not bad, and we won’t be there too long you big baby,” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and apparated them again. Draco immediately stopped complaining when he smelled the baked goods. Harry found Narcissa’s biscuits quickly, and found his own after that. Draco had wandered off to the chocolates section.
“Hermione probably knows,” They said in unison. They met eyes, both grinning. The kitchen door swung open, and McGonagall walked in, a floating feather in front of her. She raised an eyebrow after seeing them sitting on the floor.
The group stood and began chattering amongst themselves excitedly. Soon after they left, his actual class began entering the classroom, some of them looking a bit surprised to see him there.
“It’s today,” McGonagall said when Harry failed to come up with an answer. “I will make the changes to the staff roster and inform Gryffindor and Slytherin before the match,” Harry nodded.
“I was getting chocolates. My sixth years are learning about dementors and patronuses soon,” McGonagall sighed to herself, taking off her glasses and rubbing the bridge of her nose.
“Yeah, and I did expelliarmus with the first year class I had,” Draco snickered. “Sod off, it’s useful,” Harry grumbled.
“It’s not a story I’m particularly fond of,” He said, hoping it would satisfy them but also knowing that it wouldn’t.
Black smoke leaked out, and soft voices could be heard from inside the cabinet. The boy’s face had turned white, but he didn’t back down. A tall woman dressed in muggle clothes stepped out of the cabinet, holding a dirty young boy up by his arm.
“Thought you weren’t going to show,” Jason said, smiling as he stood to greet him. Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
“I heard that you’re a distraction,” Draco said to Teddy, who giggled in reply while his hair gradually turned Malfoy-blonde.
For some reason, Harry was waking up in the hospital wing again. The white lights burned his eyes, but he ignored it and sat up.
“At St. Mungos, the healers commonly use the spell ‘episkey’ to evaluate injuries on yourself or another person and heal small injuries,” Harry turned and pointed his wand at the blackboard, and a small list of bullet points appeared.
“I’d say it started with looks and developed into me just not being able to see myself wanting to be in a relationship with a woman in general,”
He poured himself a small drink, sipping it occasionally as the headache subsided. Much to his annoyance, he still couldn’t get Malfoy out of his head. Stupid Malfoy, with his stupid sarcasm and his stupid haircut and his stupid shirt that was always unbuttoned enough to show his stupid collarbones.
“I’ve determined that I’m going to get absolutely nothing done for the rest of the week,” Harry said. He and Draco joined the students on the floor, and Teddy immediately ran to Draco and plopped in his lap.
“What happened this time?” Draco asked the intern, who was splitting her time between filling out paperwork and trying to wrangle Harry onto the hospital bed for an evaluation.
“Tell me about you, Harry,” Jason prompted. Harry didn’t ask how he knew his name. Instead, he only shrugged.
“Now, the thing to be cautious about is that a boggart turns into your absolute worst fear. If you aren’t comfortable facing it, I won’t force you, but whoever defeats it gets five house points,” All but three of the students raised their hands, eager to be picked. Harry told them to stand, and he moved the desks to the outer edge of the room. A boy in the front row stepped forward, wand at the ready. Harry levitated the cupboard in front of the boy and unlocked it.
“I just finished setting up my classroom and I started wandering around aimlessly,” He wasn’t really lying, but the waiter got a spark in his eyes.
“What? Of course, it’s that big of a deal, Potter!”  Draco sat up fully, taking his feet off of Harry’s lap. He instantly missed the contact. “For all anyone knows, you could be as powerful as Merlin himself,”
“Now, let’s not focus on the trivial matters here, Draco,” Lucius was fully in the sunlight now, and Draco could see the insanity in his eyes. “Come with me,”
“What happened to you two during eighth year?” Hermione and Harry shared an amused glance, which Ron chose to ignore. He sipped the almost empty Butterbeer in front of him and set it down on the table more forcefully than necessary.
“You’ve been out for a good four days,” Draco said. “You Gryffindors do have a flair for the dramatic,” Harry only offered an indignant. “Shut up, Malfoy,” as a reply. Hermione appeared around the corner of the doorframe, only hesitating a little when she saw his face.
“See ya ‘round, Slug,” Harry didn’t really know when he’d adopted the nickname for Slughorn, but he didn’t care to stop.
“Would you rather just worry about it in the morning?” Draco could see the exhaustion on Harry’s face and body. Harry nodded and Draco walked out of the room and closed the door behind him. Once Draco left, Harry tossed his glasses on the nightstand and flopped into his bed. He didn’t understand how Draco’s presence was so calming and almost warm. Harry rolled over, wrapping his blanket around him. He’d deal with everything in the morning.
“You boys earned me nearly 50 galleons,” McGonagall smugly said to his retreating back. Harry’s face lit up in a blush and he muttered a quick “Goodbye” before turning and following Draco.
“Why’d you have to use it?” A different girl asked from the other side of the room, and Harry stiffened.
“I need to borrow Mister Malfoy,” She said, and Draco got up gracefully and followed her out of the kitchen, leaving Harry alone. He sighed and stood, dusting off his pants and shirt.
“Oh, yeah. They all love you so much, couldn’t bear to do anything that might reflect badly on you,” Slughorn had migrated into the room, leaning comfortably against one of the desks.
While Ron talked, Harry’s mind drifted to the contents of the letter he had received from Narcissa. She had invited him over for tea, which was not uncommon. However, she said she had a gift for Harry, and Harry’s curiosity was piqued. He could bring her favorite type of biscuit in return for whatever she had for him.
“Technically it’s McGonagall. She said she would make it be me at the Christmas feast,” Draco joined Harry on the desk, both of them ignoring the slight groaning coming from the weight.
“But I would like to,” Stormi insisted, grabbing a plate down from a shelf. “If you don’t tell me what you’d like to eat, I will have to make you a plate based on general favorites,” Harry didn’t reply for a moment, surprised at how educated she sounded compared to the other house-elves he’d had conversations with. She took his silence as permission and started filling the plate with pastries, biscuits and a variety of fruits. She handed the plate to him and he accepted it gratefully.
“This is a trap,” Draco muttered to himself. “I suppose I’ll go. Butterbeer doesn’t sound too horrible,” Harry beamed at Draco, and Draco decided he’d never tire of seeing that smile on Harry’s face.
“The hell?” Harry snatched his glasses off the nightstand, and something flitted to the floor. He carefully picked it up, revealing it to be a folded piece of parchment.
Harry apparated to Hogsmeade, the sunrise behind him putting him in an even better mood than he had been. School started in just over a week and the Professors were having their first official meeting today, though McGonagall had informed him beforehand that it was mainly formalities and introductions.
“Don’t you know it,” Draco replied. Harry returned to his food, but he seemed to be pushing it around on his plate more than he was eating it. “And you say I’m the one that looks terrified,”
“I hope he hasn’t started dragons yet,” Charlie said thoughtfully. “Do you know if he has?” Harry shrugged. Charlie finished his breakfast, then slipped out of the Great Hall. Harry peered through the window and saw him nearly skipping towards the hut through the half-melted sludge.
“Seemed like he didn’t have such noble intentions,” Draco stood, testing his freshly healed leg. Harry rolled his eyes.
“So what’s yours then? If it reflects your personality?” It wasn’t Presley that spoke this time, but a tanned, wiry boy in her year.
“It’s called ‘Magica Captionem’ and it's incredibly rare,” Harry blanched. “They are essentially seizures that grow a witch’s or wizard’s powers and the last time one that powerful has been recorded was with Merlin himself,”
“I have no clue. I couldn’t let go of it,” Harry loosed a shaky breath. He ran a hand through his hair and tried to smile reassuringly at Draco. “I’m fine now,”
“I think the only person to enjoy doing it was Barty Crouch Jr,” Draco replied somewhat sympathetically.
“I could never accept you like this! My mum can’t believe you would betray her like this, I mean falling in love with-”
“Bloody hell, you sound like an elderly grandmother,” Draco commented. Harry gasped dramatically, pretending to be offended. Draco laughed again and Harry grinned broadly, proud of his accomplishment.
“Stupefy,” Harry whispered, and Jason collapsed on top of Harry in a heap. Harry rolled Jason off of him, looking at the unconscious face in disgust. Without another thought, he apparated to the edge of Hogwarts.
Draco was sitting in his chair, absentmindedly sucking on the tip of a quill while he stared at a stack of papers.
“Apparently something gay,” Harry grinned at the comment as he watched the entire Gryffindor table completely riot at the new development. Draco leaned forward in his chair suddenly, squinting. “Wait, is that the Rios kid?”
As soon as he had stepped through the door, Jason cast a quick spell to declutter, even though there wasn’t much in the way. Harry perched on the arm of the couch, watching Jason shrug off his jacket and drape it over a chair. He then grabbed two beer bottles out of the fridge and used magic to pop the caps off.
“Was in Hogsmeade... Got attacked again… Had to spend the night at St. Mungo’s,” McGonagall was perched in her chair, listening with a raised eyebrow and her mouth set in a firm line.
He was leaning against the building, his expression a mix between annoyed and sad. Harry wordlessly handed him one of the chocolates he’d bought and Draco accepted it.
“That doesn’t make it any less appealing to look at. Especially since you didn’t want it,” Harry sipped his tea.
He picked out some black jeans, remembering advice Hermione and Ginny had told him ages ago. ‘You can never go wrong with black pants unless you’re wearing a black shirt. And even then, it’s hard to mess up.’ Not knowing where to go from there, Harry headed over to the t-shirts and picked out a deep green one, ignoring the irony. He grabbed a black denim jacket he had seen in the window and took his stuff to the counter. The cashier gave him a knowing look but didn’t say anything about it.
Draco swears under his breath. He forgot he doesn't have any Muggle money on him, or at all. If only he had his wand, he could Obliviate the bartender and leave. But he doesn't have his wand because he's a bloody reject of society.
This last chapter is a bit longer than the others. Hopefully you won't be bored and you'll get to the juicy end. ;)
“Right, so... it isn't that bad, you see?” Harry says with a perky voice again. “Maybe tomorrow you can try it yourself?”
Harry is left to mull over the thought that he was making progress with the blonde on a psychological level, but then something went wrong and he would very much like to smash his head on the wall for it. But that would not accomplish anything except a massive headache. So he gets up, walks to the staircase, flicks the light off and heads for his bedroom using his wand for light.
“Yes, but not quite. I don't know why that woman was coming on to you so hard and... I think someone drugged your beer. I'm sorry” Harry says lowering his eyes. He should have been there for Draco, instead of giving him space.
“That's great!” Draco says going over to bro-hug him. “How do you want to celebrate? I could make herbs-crusted salmon again since you liked it so much last night...”
“I think I'm going to have a shower and head to bed. I'm up early tomorrow morning to go to Aurors' Headquarters. Better have a fresh mind...” says ignoring completely Draco's smug face. “...but feel free to stay up and read one of the books Hermione sent with her latest owl. I think they're about Muggle Nazi history and they're supposed to help you learn about the fact that, wizard or Muggle, we're all human and end up making the same mistakes.”
He comes out of the fitting room to complain about the clothes to Harry. “These jeans are so tight there's not enough space for my...” and stops unsure about how to describe the constriction he's feeling around his crotch and bottom. Wizard robes are much more flowy and the trousers he has been wearing so far aren't as tight either.
Harry smirks noticing how he sucked the energy out of him. “It's fine, you can just help me with this” and stops moving his hand to grab Draco's. He pulls the blonde's hand to his cock and starts pumping.
With a sigh Malfoy turned around to get dressed in his dirty clothes but then noticed that there were some fresh ones on the floor next to the door. He picked them up and found a pair of simple black cotton trousers and a long-sleeved black shirt.
“I'll bring that pain-reliever potion for you in the meantime.” Harry offers raising his voice to make himself heard. He gets up and goes to the kitchen to find the vial. After a bit of fumbling in the cabinets and cupboard drawers he finally finds it and brings it upstairs.
Draco immediately retreats, while Harry spins and asks “What were you going to do?” while reaching for his wand in his pocket.
But Harry has been catching up to him recently. Harry has noticed something is going on and he has started teasing Draco furtively about it. Sometimes he does it in such a sweet way, like tonight, that Draco finds it hard to hide his feelings and he needs to escape. Even if that means making Harry think he's taking steps back in his recovery.
“You don't need to worry about your eyes. I'd like you to stop reading for a moment and expand on what you said” Harry tries to use his most encouraging tone.
“Why is it that you never said this during interrogations? It would have helped you a lot with your case” Harry says gently.
Draco waits a few minutes longer before getting up from the bed, careful not to wake him up. With one last look at the dark-haired boy, he walks out of the bedroom silently.
Draco sits on his bed then gives in to the sensation of being powerless and sinks into the covers, curling up like a cat.
“Perhaps I am aware of the consequences but I make the wrong choice anyway.” Draco feels like starting an argument now.
Following the swirl of thoughts going through his mind, Malfoy didn't notice at first that the Wizengamot was actually discussing Potter's proposition loudly.
Draco puts on a show of patting his pockets and says in his most charming tone, “I'm very sorry, mate, but I seem to have forgotten my wallet at home tonight.”
“Whatever... it's too late for one of your lessons now. I'll pass.” Draco says covering himself properly again. “Aren't you supposed to be having your beauty sleep? Why are you up?” Draco asks distractedly, pretending to be more interested in the book open on his legs than on having a conversation with Harry.
After an hour or so, Draco realises he's squinting to see the lines on the book. It's dusk and he wishes he could just light the fire and get cosy next to it. But, oh no, he needs to actually get up and turn the freaking lights on with a switch.
Draco is not trying to get into trouble the first time he goes out on his own, so he swallows his pride and walks out of the door, followed shortly after by the woman.
“I'm officially an Auror as of this morning, mate! So bring your ledger out, I wanna see if your books are all in order” Harry jokes.
fought from within the Dark Lord's closest circle, meant that treatment was harsher on him in every aspect of his trial and conviction. His will, never strong on the matter of the War, started to waver quite soon after the older generation of Death Eaters had been shipped off to Azkaban as a result of hasty trials.
Harry opens various cupboards until he finds his hang-over cure and he downs it in a gulp. He turns around, eyes closed, leaning onto the kitchen counter. The potion takes effect in a minute and he's sober again.
In some rare moments of openness, Draco has confided in Harry that he still misses her, even if she has abandoned him and his Father to their doomed fates. That's how Harry knows Draco is hurting in a way that trauma survivors are. That's how he knows better than to punish him or respond to his provocations.
Harry's guess is that Draco feels guilty about his treatment of favour compared to all the other Death Eaters, including his father. Draco's mother had disappeared during the Battle (Draco's guess) after they were separated when trying to flee the scene of the Dark Lord's demise.
Draco Malfoy——you have been found guilty on all accounts and have been sentenced to life in Azkaban. You will be transferred tonight.”
Harry knew something like this was going to happen during their night out and he though it best to let it play out in a place where he could have some back-up from George in case something happened.
Draco feels like Harry's face is too close now. Harry's touch is too warm on his shoulders. He's trying to look away from those honest green eyes, but he's finding it difficult. So he decides to run from his emotions and to stand up. If anything, it has to happen on his own terms when he isn't feeling weak and when he has all his wits about him.
“I'll just be a moment. I'm going downstairs to grab something for you to drink” Harry announces hoping to be paid attention to.
Harry is in his underwear at last and Draco checks him out. Given the enthusiasm shown to him, Harry feels quite bold so he grabs Draco's towel and throws it away, revealing his throbbing, erected cock.
Harry notices how uncomfortable Draco really is so he gives in. They walk to an alleyway and Disapparate.
Draco decides that he's finally calm enough to go to sleep. He too wants to be up early and be ready for the news Harry will bring back from Auror's Headquarters tomorrow morning.
“Yeah... I cleared it at the office. I have the authority to take you out on my own now, being officially an Auror and all!” Harry gives Draco a friendly punch on the shoulder. “We're going out at 5pm. But before then, we need to go to the Wizengamot for the appeal hearing.”
“No, seriously, thank you” Draco repeats more confidently this time, locking eyes with Harry. “If it weren't for your faith in me, this would
Draco looks away before being honest once more. “Because I'm like that. I can't live up to the expectations people have of me.” It isn't easy but being honest is the only way he'll become closer to Harry and stand a chance.
Draco becomes tense again when he hears Harry approaching. His house-mate sits down on the couch next to him, holding his mug of hot coffee.
“Are you sure? Have I done something wrong last night? Did I say something bad about you?” Harry asks, now worried.
“Nothing... I was just trying to watch and learn what you were doing” Draco responds defensively retreating.
“WHAT THE FUCK!” Draco jumps in surprise blushing and Harry sniggers. Ignoring the provocation, Draco recomposes himself and demands “What was that for?”
Malfoy forced his head down again, to avoid showing the disbelieving look stuck on his face. Why on the bloody Earth would Saint Potter ever defend him? He must surely be hallucinating under the influence of some kind of poison... just one of the perks of being interrogated by the Wizengamot. Being a former Death Eater, Scrimgeour closed both his eyes more than once at the unorthodox methods used by the Aurors to extract information and confessions from him.
Harry wants to console him. “Their expectations of you were awful. And they did not take into account what you wanted.”
Draco swears silently while sitting on the couch and grabbing the book he started the other day. He opens the book where he left a bookmark, which is a rectangular piece of paper used by Muggles in place of a spell. He tries to focus on reading but his ears are alert to any sound Harry makes in the kitchen and his mind is stuck on the image of Harry's fit body.
In a fraction of a second everything stills. George, his clerk and a couple of customers take notice of Draco immediately and the air becomes dense.
“I'm glad about their decision too. You don't need to thank me. You've accomplished so much in the past two years. You should take credit for this” Harry says convincingly.
Ron was always disapproving but would never voice his opinion just out of loyalty to Harry. Furthermore, he got engaged to Hermione and she has been the only supporter Harry has among his close friends since the house-arrest arrangement started. This is what ultimately swayed Ron in supporting Harry.
“I haven’t seen one since my third year, but it was a dementor back then,” Harry said carefully. “There’s one in the cupboard behind me, but we’ll get to that after I teach you the spell,” Most of the class looked at the cupboard suspiciously. “Does anyone know the spell?”
“McGonagall said yesterday that she’s been thinking about making me the head of Gryffindor,” Draco looked at Harry in surprise, who had a broad smile on his face.
“Whatever you say,” Harry muttered, letting the silence between them remain this time. Harry finished his plate and levitated it to the closest countertop, leaning back on his elbows.
“Take a seat, Miss Muerello, we have things to do,” She huffed in annoyance and plopped in her chair, but Harry didn’t miss the looks his class gave each other.
“Alright, Profe- Minerva,” Harry tried to be agreeable, despite knowing that he and Draco were the center of one of her notorious schemes. She smiled warmly.
“That has got to be the fastest I’ve ever seen him fall asleep,” Draco said as Harry eased into his chair, watching Teddy for any signs of him waking up.
“She’s the one who reached out to me,” Harry said in defense, though it was half-hearted. Draco chuckled and opened the door for Harry, who found himself strangely satisfied with how the time at the manor had gone.
“You idiot. Come with me. I was inviting you to come with me,” Draco looked at Harry, but Harry wasn’t paying attention.
His class watched with great interest as he struggled to find a better explanation, but the boy who’d asked the questions seemed satisfied. Only two more hands were up, Harry told himself that he could handle this.
“Very funny,” Harry huffed. “I always go over at 4:15 anyways,” Draco glanced at his watch. “Hey, you never answered if you were coming or not,”
“I’m alright. And you have to watch your language, there are children around,” Harry elbowed Draco, who only smirked at him.
After just one look at each other, they both burst out in hysterical laughter. Harry could barely catch his breath long enough to order them both butterbeers. After several minutes, Draco finally spoke.
Harry’s attention was drawn to the window, where his new owl was perched on the windowsill, holding a copy of the daily prophet. He wasn’t sure why he was subscribed, but sometimes it was funny to see Rita Skeeter try to get her fanbase back by publishing ridiculous articles. But nothing could prepare Harry for what the headline for today read.
“Right... if you say so. I'm going to bed now. Good night” Draco says stiffly and walks away quickly.
“Yeah, I did” Draco replies in a flat tone, still looking at his mug as if it's the most interesting thing in the whole wide world.
“I said nothing's wrong! Stop. Asking.” Now Draco is annoyed too. This is about to unfold and not on his own terms.
Draco looks at him straight in his green eyes with a pained expression “Nobody would have believed me... I didn't see the point.”
You must not go outside the walls of this house. There are, of course, wards in place to prevent you from doing that.
“So what's up?” Harry places his index finger on Draco's chin and makes him turn his face to look at him.
Calmly, Harry responds “Well, it was just to show you how unpleasant it might be when people sneak up on you...”
“I needed to go to the toilet and I noticed the light was on downstairs and I wanted to check what was going on.” Then he adds in a mock-cheerful way, “Pleased to find you so interested in Hitler and his evil ways...”
made the difference in that situation. You did something good!” he reaches for Draco's hand but mid-way he changes his mind and puts his arm around Draco's shoulder in a sign of encouragement.
Harry's mouth moves from Draco's lips to his jaw and then to his neck and earlobe, tasting his skin. Draco's erection is quite hard now and Harry smiles. His hands are now stroking Draco's back while he's licking his neck. Draco lets out a moan.
“You were just about to add to your comments on how great of a chef I am. And about the fact that I've learnt to cook without the aid of magic just like any Mud—ggle would.” Draco catches himself just in time. Old habits die hard. But he's making progress, or so Harry says.
“I'm going to have to repeat myself again, then. It isn't about making you feel 'less than', it's about teaching you how your life as a wizard makes you privileged but not superior. When magic is taken away from you, you learn that Muggles have their own ways of conducting life and this doesn't mean they're useless. Just different.” Harry concludes while starting to do the washing-up without his wand, to prove his point.
It's very likely that someone at the pub spiked Draco's drink. He wonders whether the woman is involved somehow or if it was just a coincidence that she paid for the beer. He doesn't understand why something like this would happen to Draco. Nobody had seen him before in the neighbourhood, he made sure of that. And nobody could know that Draco would decide to go out on his own tonight of all nights. He dismisses the thought that someone is watching them, because he has taken precautions against it since the first day of house-arrest.
Harry comes back downstairs a few minutes later, and in the meantime Draco has managed to start sulking a bit about his current life situation.
, Harry thinks willing the fluttering in his stomach to go away. He replies with a shy smile and a squeeze.
Soon it's Harry turn to moan in pleasure. Draco is putting a lot of effort into the movement but he can see it isn't affecting his lover as much as he was affected by him. He quickly decides this won't do so he moves to a more comfortable position, on top of Harry.
He read the whole situation wrong. He thought Harry found him ridiculous but his apology seemed sincere. Maybe Harry did not take him out shopping just to have a laugh. Harry was just being a good friend, trying to help him fit in the Muggle world. Buying him clothes so they could go out for a pint because he is allowed to get out of the house now. Why did he waste this opportunity?
“Oy, hands off my plate!” Draco complains while smacking Harry's hand on the table. “You said yourself that it isn't ethical to take advantage of a criminal who's serving his sentence as a path to reform just so that the Ministry can prove how fake they are!”
“Let's hope so” is all Harry can say. “I cannot make any promises but I'll do everything in my power to keep you with me, now that I've got you.” He concludes grabbing Draco's arms to pull him down in an embrace.
“I'm not one to be begged to do trivial things. I will do them when they are necessary” Draco says pompously.
The two men reach the house a few minutes later but Draco is already disconnected from the situation so he doesn't hear Harry's questions at first.
He thought he could see the ceiling of his cell even when his eyes were closed, what with the fact that he'd been locked up in there for months now, during his Wizengamot trial. When he looked at himself in the mirror, the face showing up in front of him was not his own—overgrown ragged blond hair, a sort of beard growing every which way, purple circles around his eyes, grey skin. It was difficult to present oneself decently before the whole Wizengamot court when you did not have access to a wand. He was left to his own devices when it came to grooming and a lack of a wand (or house-elf, for that mattered) made everything just about impossible.
Draco panics moving his hand away. He has been trying not to think about his own cock hardening in the process of undressing the object of his desire.
“...and you would definitely get a 3-stars review from Michelin.” concludes Harry with a wide smile.
He's startled to find Draco sipping coffee in the kitchen and he doesn't understand the look of utter disbelief his house-mate gives him for a moment.
The Minister raised his hand to make everybody quiet down and said in a vexed tone, “Make you case... briefly.”
Harry parts his mouth from Draco's to take a breath and think about the consequences of the situation. Was he the one who said you should always think clearly before making a decision? But Harry doesn't have time to keep reasoning because Draco's hand holds his neck to close the short distance between their faces and they're kissing again.
Draco speaks in an accusing tone, “You also have expectations which do not take into account what I want.” He's challenging him again, looking into Harry's emerald eyes.
I am not sure whether this story is actually complete. It seems like there's room for more but I've been sitting on it for a year without making any progress so I thought it was about time to publish it and have some feedback. Maybe someone's comment can give me inspiration to write more? Who knows.
“I'm sorry too” Draco walks into the room to continue his apology in a low voice. “I thought you were laughing at me and I became angry but I couldn't curse you or leave you behind. I acted like an arse.”
“Earth to Potter... Hello??” Draco says clicking his fingers in front of Harry's face to snap him out of his thoughts.
Draco has indeed made huge progress in two years but it isn't enough time to judge whether he will be able to stand on his own feet. He still has moments were his first instinct is to fight Harry or his new Muggle life. Harry knows the process is much longer than what they've accomplished so far and he secretly fears that the Wizengamot will take it all away from him because that would cause Draco to spiral again. But Harry will not allow this to happen.
Draco opens his eyes and stares him down with a mix of lust ad fury. Seeing as Harry cannot read what's going on in the blonde's head, Draco takes matters into his own hands.
“Well, about knowing what it's like to be on the losing side of a war... When did you realise you were on the losing side?” Harry prompts him.
Harry is taken aback. “How do you mean? I though you wanted to go down the path of recovery and reform with me...”
“Did Hermione Apparate us here as promised?” Harry's thinking maybe he tried to Apparate them and got them splinched and Draco had to fix them with his wand, breaking one of the most fundamental rules of his house-arrest. So perhaps he's giving him the silent treatment as punishment.
Draco's eyes are now full with lust. The confusion clouding his head is gone. He doesn't want to wait before going further or he'll find a reason to dissuade himself from going through with it. So he tears open Harry's trousers and yanks them down while the black-haired man is taking his shirt off.
Harry feels the urge to suck Draco's cock so he does. He licks the tip while still moving his hand up and down. Draco's arms start shaking and Harry isn't sure if that's good or not so he stops to ask “Is everything alright? Should I stop?”
“Guess what?” Harry asks coming out of his fireplace. He gives Draco a huge, proud smile. “I'm officially an Auror now! The elders confirmed that my training can be considered done since I'm doing such a good job with you!” he explains with a smirk.
They walk silently for a moment, side to side, then Harry breaks the silence. “Well, that went well. Nobody shot a hex at us!” he says with a side smile, trying to reassure Draco who had been quiet the whole time.
“Yeah, thanks—Hold on a moment.” Draco is trying to think more clearly and sits up. “What do you mean 'the potion you gave me last night'?”
“Don't walk away from this conversation” Harry pleads. “I've been making you feel uncomfortable for a whole day now. I want to fix that and I need your help to understand how to do it.”
At the same time, Harry's jaw falls open at the sight of the handsome blond man. The jeans are skinny tight and chisel the shape of Draco's bottom precisely. The sweater looks like a good fit too. Only a couple of seconds pass before Harry catches himself staring, but it's too late already.
Draco spends his days mostly reading or cooking some Muggle recipes. He has also started listening to the Muggle radio. He doesn't quite enjoy the music but the voices keep him company.
Draco is thankful to Harry for showing him that he can be better than before. Even though living without magic isn't easy and he has the occasional unwanted outbursts. But he's improving at managing them.
They're the only people out in the street and they walk silently for a couple of minutes and Draco falls behind. Harry asks him to keep up to no avail so he turns around, grabs Draco's arm and drags him under the light of a street lamp. “Look at me in the eyes” Harry commands standing one feet away from the other man.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's attitude, “I guess it's time for a short house-tour. Go on, follow me.”
This is why Harry jumps when he feels Draco's face very close to his, while the man is standing behind him, peering from his shoulder.
A moment later they are in Hogsmeade. Draco hasn't been there for the longest time so he isn't surprised when he sees how different it has become. But it still feels familiar somehow.
got me in trouble.” Draco relates calmly what happened with the bartender. He's successfully feigning detachment.
Draco's arm is a bit tired from holding the weight of his upper body, and so he thinks it's time to move things along, so he whispers into Harry's ear “Since you seem to like my arse, how about next time, you take it?”
“No, I didn't” Harry admits and continues treading carefully. “Your strategy is very good, as usual. I hope you would put as much thought into how you act around people.”
Followed closely by Draco, Harry makes his way to the back, where George was showing a customer a set of Chinese dragon fireworks.
“Thank you” Draco says trying to keep his voice steady and to hide the twirl of emotions inside him.
When Neville and Luna arrived, she sat next to Draco and started chatting him up with one of her extravagant theories. That really helped making the night begin smoothly with a laugh.
Just as he's moving away to give Harry privacy and let him finish undressing, Harry grabs Draco's hand and pulls him down. Draco loses his balance and falls on the foot of the bed, across Harry's legs and his hand lands on Harry's crotch.
“Given your stance in our society since the War, Mr Potter, and given how you have been fighting for this criminal since the very beginning of his trial, I believe there might be a possibility of reintroducing this criminal into our society in the future. The Ministry will show that it is possible to be redeemed and reformed, if one is willing and if one demonstrates the change. We need, after all, to mend what has damaged our society in the past decades... and showing mercy to those who had a lesser impact on the War is one of the possible ways of doing that. Thus, Mr Potter, the Wizengamot grants a house-arrest sentence to Draco Malfoy, and its conditions will be read to him during the next and final hearing of this trial.” The Minister paused to let the turn of events sink in. “All interested parties will be summoned when we are ready. For now, you are dismissed.”
Luna realises her friend is tired so she tugs Harry's elbow to catch his attention. “I think Hermione wants to put the Moon frogs to bed.”
What did you think of the jump foward in time from the Prologue? Any feedback on the storyline is appreciated. :)
Resigned to be having this conversation for the umpteenth time, Harry sighs, stands up and starts collecting empty dishes and cutlery from the table.
There's a moment of awkward silence. Since the beginning of Draco's house arrest, two years ago, life has changed a lot for Harry as much as it has for Draco.
Draco gives Harry's neck one last lick, then he moves to lay on his side and rest his hand on Harry's stomach.
Still, it was weird to discuss the fact that the few people who remained in his life were still awkward in Draco's presence and viceversa.
A moment later they're in the back alley near Harry's house and they walk silently up to his front door. Harry unlocks the door magically without using his wand and they get in.
Draco feels tense. He's been pacing up and down the living room for an hour now. He was expecting Harry to come back sooner that this.
Harry stopped for a moment with his monologue. Malfoy showed no signs of having heard any of what he just said so he continued in his newly practised authoritative Auror voice. “Have I made myself clear?”
Tonight when Draco is ready to go to bed, Harry hasn't come back yet. He feels weird about being alone for a lot of the time recently. He is used to having his house-mate/friend around and he doesn't know what to do with himself.
“I can assure you that my manners are of the highest standards.” Draco raises his chin as to prove that his superior decorum isn't an act.
“So what are you going to say?” Draco sits up and looks away, ready to escape the difficult situation.
Draco's bitter admission comes after a few moments. “I guess I never had faith in the fact that we'd win...”
Hannah stares at the two men for a moment. Harry blurts out a good-bye and grabs Draco by the arm to drag him away.
The hug lasts a few moments longer than Harry expects and he realises how tense Draco had been while waiting for new judgement.
“Well, you know... you said I need to learn how we're all humans and make mistakes so I thought best to start from the losing side of their war. Given I know all about it...” Draco responds in a harsh tone, now showing his annoyance.
Draco decides it's best to run away now before giving himself another hard-on. So he mutters something about reading a book and gets out of the kitchen, leaving Harry to sit alone at the table.
“Yes, he's a friend of mine.” Draco replies stiffly. He feels a scratch on his wrist while freeing his arm from her.
He's used to giving his back to Draco now. At the beginning of his house-arrest Harry had been very cautious, but he now knows up to what point he can trust Draco.
“That way” Harry points at a shop on the other side of the road, with muscular male mannequins in the window displays.
Harry broke up with Ginny, who did not support his choice regarding the former Death Eater. She could not bring herself to visit him as a consequence and they slowly grew apart.
He goes into the study and picks up the pile of books sent by Granger. There's three of them and their covers are all black and white with some flashy red. The titles read “Mein Kampf”, “Diary of Anne Frank” and “World War 2: How did we end up here?”.
Draco can't help but look away and Harry knows he's getting closer to finding out what's gotten into his friend.
They prepare some sandwiches and a salad to eat. They chat about how to break Harry's news to Ron and Hermione tonight. Draco wants Harry to prank his friends saying they kicked him out of Auror's training because he wants to continue helping with his sentence. But Harry is way too excited to be able to hide his happiness.
There's a group of friends chatting loudly around a corner table. There are people playing with sticks and balls on a table. There are people throwing darts into a target hanging from a wall. There's a couple coming out of the toilet together. They seem a bit flushed and she's tidying up her short dress. It seems like everybody is enjoying themselves.
It seems like Harry's finger left a burning mark on his chin. His previous efforts to avoid having his cock hard again have not paid out. Luckily there's a book covering him so he doesn't think Harry has found out what is actually going on.
He's quite engrossed in it so he takes a few seconds to realise that Harry's peering from his shoulder and that their cheeks are few inches away.
Harry's plan to turn the sentence into life-long house-arrest seems feasible now. The only thing which would make life bearable this way would be having a wand again. But Draco knows he isn't trusted by the Wizengamot yet. Harry's help is vital to improve quickly enough so that the Ministry will see the good in him and let him live like a wizard again.
“Hello George!” Harry says brightly, trying to force cheerfulness back into the shop. “May we have a word with you in private?”
“So. I was thinking about clothes...” Harry starts talking light-heartedly. “...and noticed how you have one good pair of trousers and one good robe and the rest is just joggers I don't use any more. I thought maybe we could go out to a pub every now and then, now, and that's definitely not how you should be dressed if we get into Muggle London for a pint.”
“And how are you so calm about all this?” Harry's voice sounds angry but he really is just worried. “Didn't you think I'd notice the wards being disrupted? We just spoke recently about thinking actions through!” Truth is, he thought Draco had escaped and he was panicking, going through possible reasons and excuses to make to buy time while he tried to find him. He was so relieved a couple of minutes ago when he spotted the blond on the pavement outside the pub.
Maybe what makes him upset the most isn't the fact that Draco went out on his own without permission, money, wand or common sense. Maybe he is angry with himself for not being there for Draco when he was in trouble. He says to himself that he cares about Draco as a friend, that's why he was so panicked and then cross and then worried.
“I am. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.” Draco shows off his aristocratic manners. For a moment he thinks of walking away but then he changes his mind and lingers. “If you would be so kind as to give me your contact information, I'll pay you back tomorrow.”
But Harry actually responds by sitting up and shrugging his shirt off. He then tries to unbutton his trousers but his fingers are not working properly.
“I thought you said we had to go through some ground rules...” he said with an indignant tone—it was beneath him to remind his prison-guard of his job but he also wanted to trick him into thinking that he was really willing to 'give it a try' as Harry had put it on their way to his house.
“Will they believe you?” Draco's voice now clearly shows how worried he is of what the consequences might be.
Draco's resolution to patch things up with Harry is stronger than the uneasiness he feels, so he goes downstairs.
The next morning Harry wakes up with a massive headache. He has some hang-over potions in his storage so he forces himself to get up and he walks downstairs to drink it. Of course, he doesn't realise he's very sweaty and only wearing his underwear.
They vanish with a pop from the Hog's Head to Apparate in the same alley where the two men left in the afternoon. She then walks them to their front door. An intoxicated Harry whips out his wand and unlocks the door, and he's finding it hard to stand up on his own. The Apparition is making him nauseous too.
“Hey, that's great!” George gives Harry a hard smack on the back. “Sure I'll come by later, after I close up shop!”
Out of the corner of his eye Malfoy saw Potter nod his head in thanks to Scrimgeour and leave hastily.
Fifteen minutes later Draco finds himself pushed into a fitting room with a pair of jeans and a sweater in his hands.
“No, thanks. We've just popped in on our way to the Hog's Head. We're celebrating tonight and I'd like you to join us. Hagrid, Ron and Hermione will be there too.”
The Aurors who had escorted Malfoy to the trial room, escorted him back to his cell at wand-point as if they were worried he would rebel. Malfoy still could not process what had just happened and walked limply to his cell.
Harry starts moving his head up and down, while keeping his hand at the base of Draco's cock. Draco continues moaning and that makes Harry even more aroused. He wants to suck Draco dry. Harry hollows his cheeks and starts pumping with his hand as well.
Harry stands up and voices thanks to the assembly and to the Minister, then he pats a shocked Draco on the shoulder as congratulations. Draco snaps out of his bewilderment at Harry's touch and follows him out of the room, into the corridor, then into the lift and up to the Ministry Hall and into one of the fireplaces connected to the Floo network.
Draco has been well aware of his developing feelings for the Boy Who Lived for a while now. At the beginning he wouldn't admit them but his mind would slowly bring him to day-dreaming about something more than just companionship and so he has come to accept them.
You must not touch my wand—or any other wand—for any reason, even if you are attacked and fear for your life.
Harry is fazed out for a moment and he doesn't realise that he's walking towards Draco until his lips meet the other man's and they're kissing.
“Yeah, there's clearly no reason why you're bright red and afraid of looking at me in the eye!” Harry accuses him.
Harry was in his kitchen, standing next to the window sill and looking out. His new 'house-mate' was sitting at the table stiffly. Malfoy was definitely not at ease. He had completely lost his charm and pompous attitude in the course of his trial. Or maybe it had always been just a façade and Malfoy had always been weak inside. Harry could not decide.
trying to catch you attention!” Draco denies, offended. “I just wanted to live one night as a free Muggle person.”
With another sigh Malfoy got out of the bathroom deciding he was going to be ready for whatever came his way. Nothing could be worse than what he'd faced so far.
Harry and Draco didn't talk much during the ride and now that they got off the bus, Draco finally comments on it, as Harry had been expecting since they got on.
“So it seems. I wonder if I could convince you to show me more of your manners privately.” Hannah says suggestively.
Draco takes a deep breath and chooses to go down a different road instead. “Maybe the other options are just too much to handle.” He tries to open up instead of fighting Harry.
“I'd like to take you to a shop to buy some new clothes. Mostly Muggle ones. Like mine.” Harry explains.
“It's a side effect of the potion I gave you last night. I have some pain reliever downstairs, if you want” offers Harry.
“Well, that was unpleasant.” Draco is disgusted. “Muggles do not understand the need for personal space, do they? And they most certainly do not shower as much as what's considered appropriate.”
There's a possibility that he's going mental from trying to live like a Muggle. He made the choice to actually give it a try after a couple of months of relentless efforts on Harry's part at the beginning of his house-arrest. He noticed how Harry was actually interested in making him healthy again, both physically and mentally.
Harry isn't ready to give up just yet. Draco has given him rope unintentionally and he's going to pull all the way. So he sits down next to Draco and dims the light with a flick of his wand.
Harry is shocked at the woman's bluntness and fumbles to grab some change. “Here” Harry passes the money to Hannah quickly.
You must not communicate with anybody but me, unless you are instructed otherwise by me, by one of the Aurors or by a Member of the Wizengamot High Jury or the Minister of Magic himself. There's a fireplace, as I'm sure you saw, but it is only connected to the Aurors headquarters so I guess it would be pointless for you to try and escape via Floo only to be caught by a bunch of vengeful Aurors.
When Harry's done throwing up, Draco helps him up and to the sink. He takes Harry's glasses off and washes his face, then grabs a towel to dry it. Then, holding Harry by the waist, Draco walks into his friend's bedroom to help him get into bed.
Draco realises they are now standing in the living room of Harry's house. “Of course I can, I'm not useless.” Draco's response comes out so slurry that Harry decides to help him up the stairs, then into the blonde's bedroom and onto his bed.
Harry collects himself, smiles and says “It actually is. If Hermione walked in and found left-overs, she would never guess
“What? I told you I would look stupid in Muggle clothes!” Draco stomps back angrily into the fitting room, misinterpreting Harry's reaction.
The following few days Harry goes to work to Aurors' Headquarters early in the morning and he comes back late in the evening, so he and Draco don't have much of a chance to spend some time together.
“Yes, especially since you ran away last night.” Harry says warily. “I think they're expecting a valid explanation if they found out what happened and I'm not sure what to tell them”.
believe you. Your actions bought us time. They could have called Voldemort straight away but instead they had to wait to make sure not to anger him. And that gave me time to find my opportunity to escape!” Harry explains heatedly, “
Draco can't stop the thought from forming in his head, so he snaps his gaze back into his mug, which is now empty.
He literally grabs Harry's nape and forces his head down on his cock again. Taking the hint, Harry starts licking the tip again, then musters up enough courage to open his mouth enough to let Draco's dick slide in.
He was sitting on the wooden chair, tight shackles bonding his wrists and ankles to it, his head was hanging low over his chest. Remissive was the best attitude when interrogated by the Wizengamot. He found that some of the members would take pity on him if he acted weaker, and they would go easy on him.
Draco stomps out of the fitting room throwing the clothes in Harry's face. “We're getting out of here. Now!” He feels like a fool for even agreeing to this. He knew he would look ridiculous in Muggle trendy clothes and kicks himself in the shins while waiting for Harry outside the shop. He doesn't know which way to go and, besides that, he isn't supposed to run away.
Malfoy tried not to indulge in thoughts of pain and restraint. He decided to get out of the shower after fifteen minutes or so. The mirror on top of the sink had gone opaque from steam so he grabbed another towel to wipe it clean and inspect himself.
“Calm down! I bought them because you looked handsome in them.” Harry replies defensively. He was just trying to make up for his previous misinterpreted reaction. “I mean it!” He says holding the bag out to Draco.
Harry puts the bag on the floor in the corridor upstairs and knocks at Draco's bedroom door. “Draco? I'm sorry for pushing you too far. I though it would be fun to do some Muggle shopping with you. Clearly I should have prepared you better for the experience and what to expect. I'm sorry!”
“I don't remember much of last night... Did something happen on our way back here?” Harry is not letting this go.
Scrimgeour, the Minister of Magic, entered the room and silence fell all-round among the members of the Wizengamot, who had quietly been whispering under their breaths. Malfoy kept his head down.
Draco stands up and opens his bedroom door to find Harry have a chat with him. He almost trips on the shopping bag on the floor. He thinks maybe his own apology will sound more sincere if he's wearing what Harry bought him. So he walks back into his room and gets changed into his new clothes.
“Like the fact that you look at me like you're pleased even though I know I will disappoint you sometime in the future.” Draco stares directly into Harry's eyes challenging him to prove him wrong.
He could not hear much noise coming from upstairs when he walked the dimly lit corridor from the holding cells to the Wizengamot court room. As usual none of the Aurors spoke to him while they walked but he felt some kind of tension running among them, and concluded that it was time for his sentence.
“Well, as Auror-in-training, sir, we are required to keep guard on house-arrest criminals. I wish to be the Auror appointed to Malfoy's house-arrest. Which is my proposition to the assembly.”
“I'll let that slide given that you seem to agree already. I thought I'd have to beg you, really.” Harry is amused by the look of dislike appearing on Draco's face.
Draco hugs him without thinking, just following his instincts. His chin rests on Harry's shoulder and his arms wrap Harry's waist tightly.
He himself was few days away from being read his sentence, which—he knew—meant it was going to mirror his Father's. He had almost come to terms with the fact that the rest of his life was going to be spent in Azkaban.
Harry starts moving his hand up and down and Draco closes his eyes and continues moaning, leaning back on his arms.
“No, don't worry, you managed to get to the toilet for that.” A hint of warmth comes back into Draco's voice.
“OK, go on, then. Tell me! What's wrong?” Harry is starting to become annoyed. It's too much prodding.
Malfoy was finally alone in the bathroom. He took off his ragged clothes which he had been wearing for months now and got into the shower. Cleaning himself without magic was not new to him. He had learnt this while imprisoned. He still disliked it and would much rather use cleansing spells and potions but it would have been silly to provoke Potter and steal his wand just to clean himself up.
