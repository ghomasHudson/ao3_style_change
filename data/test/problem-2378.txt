Harry was in the middle of a ballet class. He could laugh at the sight. The piano helped though and he was glad to see Ginny wasn't having all of a good time either.
"Neither is dancing."
He tapped his feet in annoyance at first. Then again out of spite. Then again to the rhythm he’d practised for nearly a year.
what Moody taught.
Penny blushed but grinned proudly. “I kissed him, shut him right up.”
She laughed. “Okay Harry.”
“Thanks—I guess.”
Draco huffed, and folded his arms. “Oh really?”
The other boy was smaller than him. Harry had never really tried the normal way before. He’d wanted to, he knew Amos was watching from behind the barrier.
Dean shook his head. “Due not cool. What did you even say to her.”
“Dad!”
Snape didn’t count like miss had. Instead he just announced “
Snape looked down upon him before addressing the class.
Despite the fact that the other boys lightning like scar was now visible, Draco couldn’t help but be drawn to those out of place green eyes. They showed the signs of internal debate but didn’t waver from Draco’s own eyes and eventually Potter spoke.
Harry turned behind to spot a freckled brown haired boy with a large welcoming smile and an equally large suitcase. Harry didn't stop moving as the boy ran up to walk beside him. The freckled boy was a tad shorter than Harry but didn’t seem to be much older. Harry tilted his head curiously.
“We started planning it not long after last year's performance and the next ones only three terms away…I’m not exactly sure, a month maybe?”
—”  His voice turned quiet and Draco’s cheeks became an odd bashful colour, causing the boy to quickly turn away back to his practise.
Harry didn’t do himself the indignity of whining. He groaned.
Gotta love writing about a sport I know nothing about~ oh Wikipedia my saviour.
Luna followed his movements lazily as he followed Mrs Wesley's instructions.
Cedric laughs but his eyes are red. “Why the fuck are you crying then?”
The short old man stayed stoic. “He is dealing with some important business. I’m here to take you home.”
get the steps right.”
The shock of what he was about to do hadn’t really set in mentally. He was off on his own, ready to bust his ass for one of the most difficult careers paths he could have chosen. He was only Eleven. He didn't realise it yet. He wouldn't have cared even if he did.
“Eventually.”
There was no tact in the way he flung his arms up in the air as he jumped on an old springing mattress. A child like smile on his face even though above the music he could almost hear chanting and sirens.
He pondered going to Mrs Weasley’s studio, he hadn’t seen her in nearly a year and a half now. He brushed the thought away quickly as he passed down the stairs. Something within himself dreaded the idea of going and talking to the Weaslesy and his old friends.
A familiar song he’d never heard before played on an old record and echoed throughout the room peacefully. The afternoon seemed to absorb the sound and Harry felt for the first time in weeks, a prolonged sense of calmness that he didn’t want to leave.
He hadn’t many belongings. Just a backpack full of things like money, shoes and water bottles, and a suitcase for the minimal clothes he did bring. Not that he needed many clothes. Just sleepwear and clothes for the one free day students got off. The school would supply leotards and tights for classes.
Penny looks up with furry and humour in her eyes. “I love you...—I’m going to kill you!”
Seamus sat down beside him. “It’s too bad, I think you two could have danced well together.”
“Sod off! It’s not important.”
Harry found himself sitting under a basketball hoop that Saturday. The school had an old court that went unused most of the time and the first years had taken to spending most of their free time on it. The asphalt was warm under the sun and he lazed around on it watching Dean and Seamus play catch with an old baseball.
“I don't know! He lives in London… he shouldn’t be here he has nowhere to go.”
Harry’s surprise faded away, It wasn’t
“What do we have here?”
None of these words brought Draco and fear, he’d been preparing and reading about all these subjects over the holidays and was more than willing to finally start class again.
His friend sighs a little. “I’d miss you, If you left.”
“Yeah—hey! How’d you know about that?”
“I think you’d look wicked.”
Miss walked past him and eyed his posture. He felt the urge to shrivel away. Laugh off how hard he was really trying. Ginny raised an eyebrow at him and he was about to drop when Mrs Wesley commented.
The school settled into the warm wind and all was quiet when Harry found Malfoy by the landline. The boy had gotten closer and closer to the box, Harry could reckon any day now he’ll make the call.
. How does anyone like this?
Hermione gasped and stood up. She looked ready to punch him “What is wrong with you!”
“Whatever! I’m just saying it makes sense, don't look too deeply into it.”
Vincent shrugged. “Our parents insist we come around, socialise.”
“Nothing?” his voice squeaked.
Harry quickly flung himself onto the shoes to cover them and stuck his head to look under the bed. “I can’t find my gloves.”
He didn’t know what changed about the next try. He didn’t think differently, there was no eureka moment. He'd been exhausted and angry and his feet reflected it. To this day he doesn't know how it happened that first time. He just looked at the wall. Bent his knees, breathed, and prepared.
The leaving girl turned towards Harry and looked on a little sadly. “Of course.”
probably predicted this. Was probably faking his compassion knowing how horrible he was. Harry seethed in rage and did the one thing he’d never done in boxing. He punched him, square in his beautiful pointy nose.
“Like a poof. lift your head up.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say. A question comes to mind. “You're not gay are you?”
? Mum says he’s just under a lot of pressure.”
“There's some chalk and marbles on that shelf, entertain yourselves.”
Cedric watched the worried eyes of his little brother. “Urgent!”
His heart ached to know that maybe they wouldn’t have been in this situation if Lilly hadn’t died. She had been a hard worker. She made sure she'd pulled her weight. Amos loved her for that. She was the kind of brilliant woman who hadn't needed him but wanted him nonetheless. She was the kind of woman cancer loved best. She hadn't deserved her fate. All she had wanted was a warm place for Harry and a warm place in someones heart. Even Lilly could have made times like these worth it. Now all that was left of her was a hole in his heart, a lonesome piano, and her son.
Ron hums. “I hope you don’t get in. Then you can stay here.”
let in. What would Fa—What would everyone think!”
It had been awhile since Harry's had so much to eat. Too much to eat. Spring rolls and oysters and garlic bread tempted him from blue plates. Ron seemed to finely nibble on a pastry while Ginny gobbles down a whole steak in less than a minute. Harry could gawk at the sight of such delicious servings all placed without care and yet so much precision. He thinks There's so much because the twins work and help. Or maybe there used to feeding so much more. The table has plenty of room for him to sit at, they must have needed such a big table for when the older kids lived here.
“I said don’t look into it!” Draco halfheartedly whispered before continuing to ignore him.
Draco was sitting upon the front stairs waiting for a parent much like many other students.
He hadn’t known
“Durham.” Harry replied.
Ron sat himself upon the bin eating a jam sandwich. He swung his legs and eyed the boys that walked past up and down.
Harry wondered if his Mother liked music the way he does. He would like to think she did. He would like to know anything more about her. He knows the piano in their small living room was a wedding gift to her.
"Gross."
Harry laughs. “I’m kidding!”
“You are dismissed.”
“Mother!—”
He wasn’t quite sure where this fear came from. Sometimes it felt as if he was born with it. It was oddly peculiar the scale of his fear. It wasn’t one he could ignore nor was it one he could call irrational though in fact he’d never actually had any negative experiences with fire. He’d never so much as burned his finger. Even so whenever the orange demanding element was placed near him his breath began to leave and the urge to flee spread so fast through his body there was no time to hide his fear. No time to stop his wide eyes expression and take in slowed breaths when he felt as if he could die just looking at it.
Draco was not alone in his darkness for long. He quickly found the Granger girl, who’d had the sense to bring a torch.
“Arch.” She twisted his leg slightly.
“Literally only like, you and Harry think so much about this. The year just started.”
Seamus kicked at stones. “Still… how long have you been dancing for?”
“Fine then.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “Snape said we can’t.”
Potter seemed to turn bright red. “
didn't have to go home with a black eye.
No matter how hard Harry tired he always seemed to dance in the same area Malfoy did. He was thankful that most of his stretching problems were being overlooked but every stumble he made seemed to make the other boy dance better. It was almost insufferable.
She pulled out a cigarette and lifted it to her mouth. “Suit yourself then.”
Harry feels his face go red. “She wasn’t supposed to tell anyone.”
Seamus stumbled halfway through his. As he did Draco seemed to roll his eyes and look away. Snape tutted. “Again! Get this
Harry noticed how smug Draco looked and he couldn't help but want him to speak more. He recognised that the boy seemed to find glee in Seamus's troubles but he also could tell that he must know a lot about Ballet.
“I didn’t realise how long the trip was…well I
“You're impossible to work with!” Harry cried out.
Harry scowled when Ginny had the nerve to laugh as Amos grabbed his arm to drag him out.
He hadn't noticed until he found it again. Harry had been losing his reason. Forgetting why he was here. So much beauty without any of the emotion had blinded him from his mission. With all the arguments he hadn’t realised his growing doubt. She was so graceful he could cry, but the tears didn't come. as he watched he couldn’t help but smile. He felt his heart open, she was showing him it all. He could see every ounce of hard work put in and nothing seemed less attainable. She was in her element, almost perfect. Harry knew no matter what
She looks like she wants to shuffle around for a cigarette. “Harry I know this might sound strange but. Well—I’ve been thinking of the Royal Ballet School.”
Harry didn’t know how many students he expected the Royal Ballet to have. He didn’t expect many seeing as it was one of the more niche career paths to go down. Even still the numbers around him were daunting. His old school hadn’t more than maybe a hundred odd students, maybe even less. Around him now he could estimate maybe two hundred, all from the ages of eleven to sixteen.
“Was she a good Step-Mum?”
Harry almost groaned when he saw the teacher waiting for them. The mirrors on the walls seemed to show the man's greasy black hair perfectly and Harry had to force himself to look away from the thinning dead hair. The man introduced himself as professor Snape.
Harry laughs as Ron pouts. “Don’t get all depressed. I haven't even started preparing yet.”
The sun set on that last day at White lodge in that first year. The sky was a warm colour and brushed against smooth trees though the chill forced snow down upon Roehampton in a show of nostalgia and change.
He looked down the hall further and saw Dean running towards him. “I could say the same to you.”
me again, leave!”
Harry grumbled as Malfoy snickered sarcastically. “Yeah Potter, I'm only trying to help.”
“Dance!” Ron requested.
Potter nodded hesitantly.
They got up to leave but before they could exit the greasy man spoke.
understand.
From looks alone Potter seemed to fit next to the twins. Though Draco knew all their personalities differed slightly all of them were built quite strongly and even though Harry seemed a little uncomfortable visually he looked to share some of the twins characteristics. Draco took a moment to wonder if he’d ever asked about Potters heritage. In truth he’d never really wondered about it.
Ron puffs out his cheeks with wide eyes. “Fucking hell. You going to tell him?”
Harry watched as Malfoy stared blankly at his own reflection. The boy had barely moved that entire week and Harry worried he might never dance again.
distracting was the piano. The music. It echoed throughout the hall and met his eardrums pleasantly. It sounded nothing like the old piano they had back home.
Molly doesn't hesitate.“For the Royal Ballet school.”
This entire chapter was supposed to be the entirety of year 3 and really long but that would have taken a really long time so I've decided to hopefully do year three next chapter. This fic has the potential to be a beast of words :) I'm pretty sure it's my longest with the most words. This chapter is still probably a little short but oh well~
For the first time in a long time he can tell this is the

“What’d your Dad say? Cedric?”
smaller classes but have no doubt! Your schooling shall not be affected in the slightest. So no fear young ones. For I have a feeling this year will be a great one.”
“Really? You don’t look like someone from Durham.”
He didn’t respond. He’d rather them believe
. He stilled. Everyone seemed to still. There was a beat of silence before the hall realised he had finished speaking and a round of hasty applause followed after. Dumbledore might have smiled though it was hard to tell behind the beard and he soon walked off the stage and out of sight.
“Please Dad. We’ll find him some money please .”
But he never did, and it seemed like he wasn’t going to start now.
Amos hissed. "You can't go out today! You know what'll happen when they get you!"
Ron followed his instructions. “How do I look?”
... you're not supposed to be in Everington Harry. You were made for something more.”
He spent almost every afternoon with the blond boy. Whether they talked or not didn’t matter as they opened a new book from one of Snape's endless shelves and picked out something new to practise. They never failed to end the day exhausted with aching tired feet making Harry almost wish
He turns to her. “Miss?”
familiar really. He wasn't sure he could keep this place to himself. Harry had made sure to have a piece of paper with everyone's phone number and was hoping to find a private place to call, he even had Luna’s house phone though they'd never really gotten on that well.
Ginny laughed. “Then don’t act like one.”
“I don’t.”
"Lilly's grandparents lived here you know. They both came up about a year before you were born. I think I knew she was the kind of woman I knew I'd love forever. I knew even when we were both bored little kids during the holidays."
Harry thought he had done rather well all things considered. But there was a problem. A big one. Harry couldn't hear music but he could hear the sound of his own feet hitting the floor. He wondered if they had always been that loud?
Lilly Evans had married Amos Diggory nearly a year after Harry’s father had died. Harry was unlucky enough to inherit the last names of all of his parents. Having four names made him feel like a right priss. The Potter part didn't even feel like it fit. It was as foreign as the memories of his long dead father were.
The boys seemed to all come out from around them, some even held makeshift torches alight. Draco couldn’t stop himself before shouting at the flame. “Fuck off!”
Hinting at whose going to be focused on in the next chapter ;) This one took a while to get inspired to write but when i did it only took a day so progress!
Draco paused his movements. “That’s not what I mean.”
The most awkward moment of Draco’s life happened during one of these demonstrations.
Harry doesn’t even know why Amos still keeps giving him boxing money when both Cedric and him are out on strike. He was was waiting for an excuse to stop.
Harry gulped. “They're not broken are they?”
Draco gulped. “Of course I do. He’s in my year after all.”
It sounded pathetically romantic. An idealisation of events. Harry felt his cheeks turn red. “I’m not kissing Malfoy.”
Their silhouettes were pronounced against the orange light from a large window in a large empty room where they forged their dance and entangled their lives into each others once more. That second year though uneventful and sad, built the foundations of possibilities. And where there were possibilities…
"What?"
Cedric looked through the rear view mirror to find the two boys spaced apart. Both looked out their own window and were frozen still, wondering whether it would be more obvious to wipe their tears away or to let them sit there.
matter. Harry could tell by his movement. Draco moved strategically with practise and knew exactly what he was working towards. Harry remembered how he said that the girls practised all the elegant stuff, but Harry reckoned he’d never really seen anyone dance as elegantly as
He stopped in his tracks as his face turned towards Harry. Green met grey and the two stood in stillness. Harry felt as if time might have stopped as he two were rendered motionless. Draco’s eyes were wide and his arms stiff but somehow he didn’t seem fearful nor shocked. Harry couldn’t place
He blinked wildly.”Umm...Thanks.”
“Oh…”
“Dressing up.”
One night Harry woke up to find Cedric getting ready.
Cedric was the first to ignore his privacy. Pushing himself into the hallway. Amos follows.
Draco kept his eyes on the red landline. He could feel Potter stiffen as he spoke.
Moody growled from behind him. “Harry! This is man to man combat, not some bloody tea time dance!”
The older Scottish lady coughed and stood up on the podium to take the man's place. She looked down at her papers before gazing back up.
“I have Ginny.”
felt angry though. Determined.
“Ballet school? In Newcastle?
?” Snape concluded.
Seamus nodded. “Yeah, half the girls here do.”
Ron sit’s out on the footy field with him. Ginny’s doing cartwheels with Luna ahead. Luna holds a football on her head as she walks around. Its an odd sight Harry thinks he might have to get used to.
“I don’t even want to do the stupid audition!” He lies, “You only want
The rest of break comfortably continues as feelings are unacknowledged but all the more felt. An oddly quiet and overwhelming bus ride and the start of a new year. What is in store for our group of puppy love kids this year?
“He’d call me a Homo and get angry again.”
Draco of course found his eyes drawn to Potter.
Songs this chapter includes-

Harry smiled shyly and rolled his eyes. “Stupid. Only girls wear tutus, I’d look right stupid in one.”
“I’ve seen you dial it like a hundred times over the past two years! It was pretty easy to remember.”
He turned his back to his Dad to spin and then came back around to kick the air. Amos leaned back in reaction but Harry didn’t stop.
Harry sighed. “I look like James Potter, everyone says so. He died when I was four.”
Draco ignored his stretches as his hand shot up to cover his chuckling mouth.
Cedric wondered if the kid did know. From the looks of his clothes and heightened worried state he figured the kid rich, or at least upper class.
"You'll understand one day."
“Hello!”
Harry could feel his eyes begin to water, hearing her say it nearly broke his heart.
. He knew he wasn't good enough. She didn't believe in him he knew. His shoulders became heavy and he could feel the future
He found her wondering about the tall grass that led to the sea. He shivered in the cold and was glad she’d wandered off with her beanie still on.
call out all the names for first roll and then send you to the classroom you’ll be starting in but due to this change I’ll find it more suitable to yell out the names of the people in this smaller class and where you will be going.
He gulped and was glad that when he finally opened his eyes, no one was round to see.
Harry paused. "You won't?”
Draco hadn’t noticed until the voice of his family's personal driver came upon his ears that the car was there waiting for him.
“You can’t go back not now!” His voice is hoarse.
They're almost at the end of the street when Harry hears a voice.
She rolled her eyes. “None
“It's french I think. Don’t let your heels go off the ground.”
Harry looked around and grunted as a boy pushed past him. “Why are you even out here then?”
“Follow the others.”
“Well of course there are still going to be mixed gendered classes but they like having the lads train together. I hope I end up in the smaller one.”
“I need to go get a friend.”
Harry takes a gulp of the beer and promptly spits it out. “Tastes like piss!”
“The auditions in a week's time Harry!
The boy, Daniel, seemed to smirk and added on. “They let us in here cause Penny’s this school's pride ‘n joy. They’d never say no to her.”
. Earlier that morning they hardly did anything but argue as Snape prepared them for the rest of the year and the way they were seemed to make no sense. Draco wondered if they were rivals. It felt like a rivalry.
Snape turned away. "Then by all means, stay."
Harry frowns. “I don’t want a childhood. I wanna be a ballet dancer.”
Harry stood there sheepishly as Malfoy pushed him away. “Besides, aren’t we supposed to be practising our
The room was filled with the people Draco had come to expect to see. Granger and Seamus seemed to be talking animatedly at a desk while Lavender pestered Blaise about some form of hair product he was using.
"Harry..."
Also if anyone was wondering I spent hours trying to find the right songs for Harry's year to dance to and then I never mentioned it so~ Initially I wanted instrumental music made in the 80s but I gave up on that. If anyone's wondering I picture the song Draco and Harry's year dance to is Elvis Presley's rendition of 'Fever"
She seemed to grumble before going back to investigate the hole further.
“I need to go.”
The next circle held the words,
Harry rolled his eyes and debated blabbering about the incident out of spite, just to offend the other boy. He was glad to find that he felt no need to apologise anymore and that a small part of him kind of wanted to annoy the blonde once more, grab his attention and
Dean tilted his head. “I don’t think we've heard much about your home Harry, what’s her name?”
It seemed everyone behind him in the hall made their way to walk, leaving maybe fifty odd students left.
Harry didn’t want to be a miner. He didn’t like the idea of always being dirty, of being so deep in the earth and working hundreds of feet underground. The thought of busting his back to pick and stab at hard stone all for a lump of black. Cedric had said the mining wasn’t scary, the people paying the miners were. Cedric says a lot of stuff like that. It’s why all the police are around.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Really?”
She nodded.
Amos could see Harry pretending to sleep. He sighed and went over. Carefully he sat himself upon the bed facing his other son. Cedric was blissfully asleep and would wake up tomorrow questioning his judgement.
“They're very pretty.” He said honestly.
” He commanded.
Harry kept himself sharp for the rest of the lesson. He watched the other boys leap across the floor one after the other.
Harry chews his lip and rubs his hands together. “My hands are freezing!”
“I think you're good enough to go for it.”
“He can dance.” He blurts.
Harry frowned, that didn’t seem to make any sense. “But it isn't silly—you worked really hard on this. We all did.”
Hermione smiled slightly. “I won’t.”
Daniel would sometimes join in, or demonstrate a part of his work. Never in full and never finished and still Harry would watch like a moth drawn to a flame. Where Penelope was pretty he was
Potter looked towards the red landline and crossed his arms. “You gonna make a call?”
As important as it was there were some things wrong about the memory. Tilted. His mother's hair had seemed so much darker within it and he distinctly remembers sitting in the blue car his mother hadn’t actually bought until a few years after the memory even happened.
Harry can tell that Dad agrees with him, he’s just more afraid. Cedric isn’t afraid, Harry’s never seen Cedric afraid.
She spoke his next instructions. He was to move to a piece of music.
Harry never visited his biological father's grave. He never had the opportunity nor the need to. He doesn’t even remember the man, not even his mind images or dreams. He thinks that means his dad was a miner. Only miners children never saw their dads for long in Everington.
Ron’s dad asks him about the strike. Says it’ll all be shut down soon.
Seamus was ranting about the song he and Dean had just started practising too.
“What is wrong with you! You can’t dance and you don’t even try. You know how many people would die just to be in your place! Do you know how many anxious girls on audition day could have been happy in
Harry’s breath hitched at the last name.
Miss called it spotting. Harry didn’t know how he was supposed to do it with a mirror.
Indeed they had. Though somehow that hallway with it’s sunset tint, seemed to all but erase their grievances and left two boys calm and peaceful.
“Cedric...Do you ever think about death?”
He ignored their words. He knew why he was doing this. It didn’t make it any less scary though. The buses were private and he couldn’t even smoke to cool his nerves.
“Not as much as you think. Two grand maybe. There's a good chance the council wi—”
“Next time I’m back here. A year maybe.”
He laughed. “Oh fuck off!”
Seamus turned to him. “Why is your name so long? Are posh or something?” he asked curiously.
“Master Draco, It’s time to go.”
Harry in turn looks towards the other side of the room as he too could feel an unpleasant heat in his face.
“Some of our year is going into the park tonight right?”
Ron moved him to the bed. Harry tried to keep still as Ron puts lipstick on carefully. Harry flinches. Someone touching his lips was a weird feeling, he liked Ron's hand on his shoulders though. He wondered if they've ever hugged before. The feeling was warm and slightly heavy and
“You’ll get arrested!”
“You can, you're just not concentrating!”
He danced his way around his dad before going to run the other way. The movement looked like a soccer player without a ball to kick.
you've been practising with seniors.”
His lips turned upwards once again. He ignored the hateful words of the piano man.
“I’m not.” Harry took a deep breath, hating how whiny he sounded. “I’m sorry. Sorry Draco.”
“Well, yes, but it’s not always easy to say that. Which is why we have the charm.”
“Right," said Harry. “So are we going to do this?”
“So,” said Blaise, starting to smile back at her. “Did you just want to look or…”
“Yeah, ahem, er. Yes.” Draco agreed, glancing around to see if there was a convenient pillow for him to scream into. Or a gaping void.
“Yeah.” Harry blinked. The screen had gone grey, the spellwork slowly unravelling. “Guess I didn’t realise what a shit time you were having. Still can’t believe you tried to climb out of the roof. Don’t think I’ve ever been on a date bad enough to make me do that.”
“Draco!” He gasped. “Wait, I’m—”
“Mrs Weasley,” Draco scoffs on autopilot, his frozen fingers fumbling with the buttons of his coat. “You are going to have to call her ‘Molly’ one day.”
“Dunno. Do you feel especially sedate?”
“What?” Draco glanced wildly at the restaurant and then back to Ron. “What are you doing here? You’re not cereal?”
“Do you have any biscuits?” He asked instead.
“It was the only way you’d go with him.”
“Careful.” She patted the seat next to her. “Come sit and tell me how the points work again.”
“I agree?” Draco shifted from foot to foot, glanced at the interrogation room door.
Harry’s eyes widen slightly, and he shuffles on the window seat. He clears his throat. “Why?”
“You did?” Draco’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s.
“They were in one of the fourth floor Charms classrooms,” said Nigel.
“Hmm?” Draco misses Pansy’s answering huff, his thoughts once again noting the contrast between soft red wool, smooth skin, and the slightly raised lines of a new tattoo. “Oh do leave off.” He bats Pansy’s hands away as she moves to help him with his coat. Too late, he notices Pansy’s dark lipstick almost disappear as her mouth thins.
“Where’s this teddy, then?” Millicent called, scrambling across Mafalda to prod Marcus in the chest. “Come on, whip it out.”
“What?” Draco’s eyes darted down, tracing the curve of Harry’s right thigh. “They’re...” his voice trailed away and he swallowed. Harry swallowed too. Draco cleared his throat, turned back to the screen. “Just watch.”
“Are you going to expel me?” Draco asked, swallowing down hot tears and glaring at his hands. “There was a dragon, honestly! It’s Potter and Weasley who should be here, not me and-”
“Why is he back to being Malfoy?” Harry hedged. “You’ve been calling him Draco since the Academy.”
“Yes! I always forget the Muggle term. Strange the way Muggles make up all these terms when we have perfectly-”
“Framed by whom?” asked Harry, wondering if he should crack a window to let the tuna smell out.
Harry found a packet of Rich Tea biscuits in the Auror snack cupboard and munched his way through them—taste buds cooing happily at the opportunity to wrap around something wasn’t cereal or alcohol—while Draco and Tonks argued. It only took Draco an hour to agree that he and Harry should probably be in the same room when they reviewed the 50+ hours of their date. Of course that still left the matter of whether they should review the tapes in the Auror rooms or at Malfoy Manor (“not a chance, mate,” Tonks was quick to interject). And what about the room allocated for the viewing? Tonks might
“Right, um… Forgive me, I just need...” Draco stands.
“Do you mind retracting your gigantic head?” Draco’s voice was mild and much closer than Harry had expected. He was peering around Harry’s shoulder, trying to see where the bottle had landed. The cuff of his right sleeve kept brushing against Harry’s wrist.
“Um, that’s how Muggles play. I think.”
“It’s just for a few weeks,” said Hermione. “Please?”
“That it, then? You just fancied a leg over and trusted Pansy not to set you up with a potential murderer?”
“Can’t believe you ran.” Harry shook his head. “Tonks mate, what did we vow.”
“Breaking curfew, Blaise?” Draco asked, barely suppressing a groan as Janice handed him a punishment slip. The slip was charmed to duplicate in Umbridge’s office. Blaise didn’t respond, and so Draco pulled out a quill. “Names?”
“Oh.” All the air seemed to leave the pub as Harry dazedly watched Draco lean closer, his lips shiny and slightly parted.
"What are you doing in here?" Greg had asked, squaring up to Blaise during their first night in the Slytherin boys dorms. "You were in with the girls last year."
“Yeah.” Harry says again, for perhaps the thousandth time since Draco sat down. “Yeah, right.” He straightens up, talking a bit faster. “Yeah, yeah, ok, ok, ok, k, k, okthanksbyeseeyousoon!” He slams the phone down, grinning as Draco laughs. “Sorry. Work.”
“Sit down!” several voices, both Gryffindor and Slytherin, chanted. Rubbing his forehead, Harry tore his eyes away from Draco and realised that everyone was staring at him expectantly. The Slytherins had dragged the sofa around so it faced the two beds. The clothes that had been strewn across the floor were gone and in their place was...
“Yes,” Malfoy insisted.
“What? No.” She spoke very slowly. “You are the principal witness in a murder investigation.”
“Flatterer. Just, give me some credit, yeah? I’m not that much of an-” The rest of Harry’s sentence flew out of his head as Draco leaned forward and pressed their lips together.
“Yes, I’m early.” He smiled and was pathetically grateful when she smiled back.
“‘Ello” he called, cheerfully snapping away. “Schoolboy rivalry rekindled, is it? Spot of wands at 3pm and all that?”
“Such concern for your friend,” Draco drawled.
“Th-thank you.”
“We should talk.”
Trust Cormac to offend him over his sexual practices. Harry wasn’t vanilla, was he? He was in half a mind to head back to the Everything's a Dildo stand and buy that 12-foot monster cock out of pure spite. Maybe he could make a lamp out of it?
He was less than a foot away from Potter when he tripped over a stray rucksack. Throwing his arms out to brace himself, both Draco’s hands slammed down on Potters table and Potter jerked to attention, staring up at Draco with a slightly open mouth. As far as dramatic entrances went it was hard to beat, although given the choice Draco would have preferred to opt for a sneered “Potter” and an artfully raised eyebrow.
“Fuck off, you fucking dick hole.” It was not Harry’s best effort.
“Yes, you absolutely imbecile,” Draco hissed while everyone else argued about what Alicia should have to kiss instead. Draco’s face was twisted with rage. “Honestly Potter, everyone is already aware that your gormless exterior is doing little to disguise your equally gormless interior, but if you could attempt to locate the two or three brain cells-”
“Afraid so.”
Much to Draco’s unease, Potter laughed. “Well,” he picked up his drink and held it up to Draco in a toast, “if he’s scared off by a man sitting in a chair he’s clearly not up to handling you. Seems like you’ll be better off without him.”
The obvious pure-blood candidate was Draco. Draco who, as the owner of the wand that killed Voldemort, could be expected to have a fairly robust magical core. As for the agent of Voldemort’s death, who else could it be but Potter? The size of the prophecy indicated that it had been cast fairly recently, probably within weeks of the Battle of Hogwarts.
“I thought after that night...” Harry trailed off. “I thought you’d want to…”
“Bollocks.” Ron pointed a long finger at Harry. “Literally.”
“Flying without purpose,” Draco insisted, shifting closer to Harry and casting a nervous glance towards the Gryffindor Chasers. “They can bounce that Quaffle back and forth as much as they want, but theatrical showboating will not save the day against one well-caught Snitch.”
“Why?” said Draco.
“I am not dating him.” Draco yelled. Causing the whole pub to go silent and Harry to slowly raise him head.
“I’m just saying,” Harry whispered, “This is a man who created a spell “for use on enemies”, yeah? Are we sure he’s the best person for this forgiveness gig?”
“Be my guest.” Draco pushed his own bowl across the table, hiding a smile when Potter’s face twisted into a now familiar expression of horror.
Once Tonks had extracted everything Draco knew about the Malfoy Martyrs, she turned him loose with a cheerful threat about what would happen to him if he “tried any of those Slytherin shenanigans on Haz”. A threat which left Draco simultaneously outraged and rather pleased at the implication that he might have means, motivation and opportunity to shenanigan Harry.
“Well.” The woman gave them an assessing look. “I do have a cake tin that can transform to match the user’s genitals.”
“It’s based on your personality as well,” the waitress explained. “Not just the colour you picked.”
“Yeah, it was kind of my idea.”
“Harry!” Katie yelled. “It’s your go!” The Gryffindor Chasers always got a bit rowdy when they’d had too much sugar, and Harry had learned the hard way that immediate obedience was the only option.
“Blaise!” Ginny’s voice rose by at least an octave. Maybe she was the one who needed the voice modifier, Draco smugly thought to himself while smoothing his hair and gently pinching his ears until they melted back into human shapes. “I was just asking Malfoy where you were.” Ginny continued, smiling up at Blaise and bouncing from foot-to-foot.
“Figures. You got any hangover potion?”
bed.” Harry grinned at the laughter in Draco’s voice.
The thing that was wrong with telling the Aurors about the connection between their kidnappings was that Malfoy and Hermione didn’t want to. Following their attempted abductions, they’d both spent too long under the watchful eye of the Aurors to have retained any faith in magical law enforcement.
“You too,” she grinned, snapping her goggles into place. “Alright chaps,” she stepped down into the swamp and began wading over the the first obstacle, an 8-foot climbing wall. “See you on the other side.”
“Um, yeah. Cheers.” Harry accepted the chapter. It was printed on nice, expensive feeling paper and was titled:
“Library, yes, of course.” Draco hastily backs out of the kitchen, pausing a moment to collect himself in the dark hallway. Right.
the mug that until a few moments ago had been floating in midair. The water witch was smirking at him from behind her own water-filled mug. By contrast, the man on the mug was all too visible and stroking a noticeable erection. Noticeable because he wasn’t wearing any pants and- “This is not mine.” Harry shoved the mug into Ron’s hand, trying not to feel gratified when the picture on the mug did a disgusted doubletake and started pulling its clothes back on.
“Alright. Firstly it’s not creepy, it’s sexy.” Ron informed him, leaning over to count off on his fingers. “Secondly, we’re not talking about you—”
wizard. Which was an incredibly bitter pill to swallow as, before walking into the Cereal Monogamist, Draco had rather hoped that he’d already accomplished that transformation.
Only a few months later and Draco's friendliness had already been rewarded with an invite to spend the summer with the Zabinis and a new Nimbus 2001 broom. Upon hearing that her son had made a new friend, Zadie Zabini, had put her latest husband's vaults to good use and splurged on Nimbus 2001s for the whole Slytherin team. Not that anyone was supposed to know, the delivery had been made after dinner and the only reason Draco knew (and got first pick of the brooms) was because he was Blaise's closest friend. Blaise's only friend, really, Draco reflected to himself as he looked up at the still immovable stairs. Maybe he should make an effort to include Blaise more, at least suggest that-
“No one forced you to come,” said Harry.
“Oh?” Millicent shifted her focus back to Harry. “What would you call forcing yourself on someone against their will? Foreplay?”
“What things?” Malfoy’s mouth dropped slightly open. “Were you listening to anything other than the sound of your own righteous indignation last night?”
“What? Hermione was still sitting on the floor, staring up at him. “Are you alright?”
“The old grind?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Ron’s right,” said Hermione. “Go back and start from the beginning.”
“I…” Draco was at a loss. Of course the Dark Lord wouldn’t want to know about Granger’s made-up weapon. He’d laugh Draco out of the Floo, and then call him just to cast an Unforgivable. “There appears to have been a misunderstanding-” he cleared his throat. “My family are not… not…”
“No.” Draco responded quickly, reaching across to tap Potter’s knuckles. “I don’t want to stop I just...”
A few days later, the truncated breakfast conversation looped in Draco’s mind as the three Malfoys watched the Irish Beaters fall into formation. High up in the stands, a flash of orange caught Draco’s wandering gaze and he focused his omnioculars on the Weasley clan. Ginny was sat next to a soft, curvy woman who must be her mother and on the other side of her was-
“I know.” Draco groaned, running both hands over his furry scalp and tipping his head back to stare at the classroom ceiling. They had been working on kinetic transformations for months and he was still no closer to… “Oh.” He swung around to face McGonagall. “I, ah, I apologise for interrupting you. You… you were saying?”
“Apparently nothing you haven’t heard before.” She eyed him.
“Fuck, I’m glad to see you,” he didn’t even give her time to turn around properly, just crushed her in a hug that pressed them both into the kitchen counter. The memory charm was making Harry’s memories of Snape and Malfoy a little hazy, but the fear he’d felt when reading Hermione’s note was still palpable.
“Hmm?” Looking up, Draco was distracted by the thick dark hair falling over Harry’s glasses. “Yes I suppose.” He heard himself say, the words feeling thick on his tongue as Harry smiled.
“Fine,” he said.
“Alright love? Do you have a reservation?” A small woman appeared at Draco’s elbow, she was still wearing a coat and Draco briefly wondered if she was just a helpful diner before noticing that her earrings were made of perspex coated cornflakes.
“Draco.” Blaise’s voice was almost too quiet for Draco to catch over the roaring of blood in his ears. “We were going to the Infirmary. You have my word. Now-” he took Ginny’s hand. “We will leave you to your evening.”
“Liam isn’t real,” Harry felt compelled to point out.
“Too late, already did it for you,” said Katie. “It’s your go now; spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.”
As Harry was one of the youngest members of the new Slytherdor team
“Dad!” The sound of Scorpius’ voice drove all other thoughts from Draco’s head. “Over here Dad! Are you alright?” Scorpius was waving from behind the Auror tape, a wobbly smile threatening to tip over into tears.
“Is that what you want? Friendship? Or is this decision to quit the Mudders a sign that my friendship is no longer desirable?”
“Yes, forgiveness.”
“Bonding,” said Greg.
“You alright?” Harry murmured, nudging Draco’s arm as they stood in line for the Ministry-approved portkeys. It was getting late and Ginny had volunteered to take Al and Scorpius back to Harry’s flat. The crowd had mostly dispersed and orange street lights glinted off the shards of glass surrounding the Cereal Monogamist.
“Well clearly I was being facetious, Potter” Draco snapped, making a mental note to warn Scorpius to stop talking about Albus.
The whispered words seemed to scream through the kitchen. Draco was staring at Harry like he was a complete idiot, eyes darting back and forth.
“So,” said Draco, dragging his eyes away from Potter. “You picture yourself and Liam the Underwear Model commiserating over the superficial nature of the general public, followed by-”
“Indeed. Just as well that there is an entire table between the two of you.” Draco finally notices that Pansy is sitting between Hermione and George, as far as she could  possibly be from Percy. Taking a moment to absorb the rest of the seating arrangements, Draco realises that someone is missing. “Where’s Harry?” he asks, turning to find that Ginny is busy apologising to Percy.
you don’t talk to me?” Potter pressed forward again, elbows back on the table. “I know you’re not a blood-bigot any more but-”
The door slammed shut for a third time. Finally, Draco was alone.
“Is he stuck?” Albus asked Scorpius.
“Disgusting.” Ginny’s voice came from above. She was back in the doorway, streams of mud flowing down her legs and goggles propped up on her forehead. The white circles around her eyes made her look like some kind of swamp-dwelling, reverse panda. “You’re both a complete disgrace. Millicent got in after you, Draco, and she’s already in the shower—”
With that she grabbed her parka from behind the kitchen door, snarling “Hello” at a startled Draco who was just coming up the garden steps. “I’m getting Luna to act as a mediator,” Hermione called over her shoulder. “She’ll sort you out.”
“Sorry, what was that?”
“No.”
“Are those real?” Harry was horrified to hear himself ask, unable to tear his gaze away from the mermaid’s chest. “I mean the-the-the things.” A helpless glance at Ron confirmed that Harry wasn’t the only one thinking of breaking up their life long friendship.
“What’s wrong with Draco?” Hermione asked.
Red mist started streaming from the neck of the bottle, making her flush even more vivid and clashing horribly with the purple and grey carpet. No one seemed especially startled by the mist.
“I don’t understand, I-”
“You just said his name.” Ginny spoke. She looked very young, wearing a shabby red dressing gown and with her hair down around her face. She didn’t look like the kind of girl who would inspire someone as pragmatic as Blaise to break the rules.
“Custard? Draco?” Arthur offers the jug, smiling in a way that suggests it isn’t the first time he’s asked.
“Right.” Harry tried to stop smiling. “I hate you too.”
“That’s very kind of you.” He said, his voice feeling scratchy. “I will suggest it to Scorpius.”
“Yeah I want you too but I’m a bit pressed for time here.” Harry lifted his hand to rub the back of his neck, only for Draco to catch hold of it. “We need to get this sorted before—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wicked!” Cormac breathed as Harry recoiled. “Show me?” The two of them disappeared into the crowd, leaving Harry with a half-chewed croissant and a terrible foreboding about what Ron’s birthday celebrations would entail.
The next stall was an oasis of calm, despite being plonked right next to the dildo menagerie. Neatly ordered pamphlets were artfully arranged beneath a small printed sign that read
“Hold up,” he said, climbing to his feet and doing some stretching himself. “When was the last time you ate something? Because-” he pointed at Draco “-a few mouthfuls of cereal and a
“We aren’t.” Draco spoke, his voice strained and a dark pink flush creeping up his neck. “Do try to pay attention.” He turned to Harry. “I believe you were talking about…er…your mouth and my um…er…please. Do continue.
“That’s rough.” Potter’s eyes were bright. “I’m not like that, but I can see why someone would be. ‘Specially at Hogwarts with all those skinny Quidditch players.” He smiled at Draco, who felt his face flood with heat. “Maybe Scorpius would like to come to Edinburgh with me and Al sometime? Al’s not settling in as well as James did and I’ve been going up there to take him out now and then.”
manage it, Minerva McGonagall would finally get the chance to see a Hogwarts team lift the European Quidditch Cup. Immediately after which Igor Karkaroff would be cordially invited to shove it up his own arse.
“Right then,” Harry swallowed. “Er. What do we do now?”
Hermione, Harry and Draco sat on the sofa, blinking up at Snape and slowly realising that yes, they were supposed to have been closing their eyes and falling back into each other's arms. Not arguing about whether their Forgiveness Facilitator was a sociopath.
“Sorry.” Harry shuffled back, resting his head against the wall. The wallpaper was textured and he rolled his head from side-to-side, feeling the ridges rub against the back of his skull.
“And I do rather believe that your father’s house guest will be interested in this development.”
“I think so too.” Hermione pushed the book completely onto Harry’s lap. The book grazed some rather cital equipment and Harry looked up to see Draco wince in sympathy. “The question is whether restricting the forms we can take would limit the potency of the transformation.”
“Um, guess I feel a bit like that was Malfoy, you know?”
“Hmm?” this meant that Potter had used the Prefects Bathroom before Draco. Even though Draco actually
“A new nickname?” he asks, without much hope. Percy’s ex-wife Penelope had introduced herself as ‘Pea Weasley’ at the Hogwarts Reconciliation Ball, and while the marriage had not lasted, the association had.
Muggle laundry. Now either say “thank you,” or say nothing.”
sign floating above it.
In which Draco gains a broom and loses a friend.
“Oh.” He sighs, moving back into Harry’s space. “Oh, you are such a… a wanker.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco dragged his eyes away from Potter’s revolting face and attempted to understand why the interrogation was making him feel so uneasy. He was starting to suspect that it was because Granger was crying. Not that Draco minded seeing Potter’s favourite Mudblood in tears, but he had spent enough time attempting to make Granger cry to know that it wasn’t an easy thing to manage. Granger hardly ever cried. In fact she wasn’t properly crying now; her face was twisted, but her cheeks were dry, and she kept darting meaningful glances at Potter.
Ron sent him a knowing look. Behind him, on the couch, Hermione sighed.
Not like he minded. The future was a fickle, irrelevant thing when the present was so heavenly.
Draco nodded. He could understand that: it was painful, really, caring for Harry. Constant, overwhelming, with so little return.
‘You didn’t do too bad either. I thought you’d ignore me and try to bring your tie. I’m impressed.’
‘Here,’ Draco agreed eagerly. ‘Whatever, Potter. Just take your shirt off as well,’ and as he said it he finished on the last of the buttons and yanked the fabric from Harry’s lean arms, discarding it on the floor. Harry’s chest was all pale with flushed patches - and there they were, bringing back a bitter hint of guilt, fading bruises forming patterns over his ribs. Draco traced a few with his fingers, a light touch over the healing blood vessels, following up the ridge of his sternum and to his nipples. They were small and pink and surrounded in sensitive, quivering muscle, and, in Draco’s dreams, they’d always been too flickering a construct to properly appreciate - now, with no shortness of time and the solidity of reality, Draco indulged himself by flicking one, then rubbing the pretty little bud until it hardened.
- he found that fateful little nub, sensitive and barely sticking out, and rubbed over it. Harry's entire body seemed to go into shock.
Harry’s smile widened with relief. He brought a hand to the back of his neck and kissed him quickly, lightly, a chaste brush of lips.
But maybe he wouldn’t get bored of him at all. Draco could allow himself to hope, couldn’t he? They were good together, they were
it. It couldn’t have been a fantasy - in them, it never felt as good, and Harry always loved him back. If Harry had liked him before - as a friend, as a partner, as a warm mouth, Draco wouldn’t complain - perhaps not all was lost. Of course resent would linger, the side effect of pain. Eventually, however, the bruises would fade, the fractures would heal, and with this soreness so too would his grudge disappear, and their friendship, with a bit of effort, would hopefully reform. Draco could be patient - surely it wouldn’t take long.
Next came Alchemy. They made a strange few, the ones who’d chosen that elective, and the air of the musty laboratory thrummed with burst nerves and lingering tension; the test had gone wrong for a pair of Hufflepuffs, as it seemed; swimmingly for the charmless Rowena, and that’s all he’d gathered. Although he had half a mind to ask Harry, the thought fell mute at his hips, dead at his knees, and he couldn’t for the life of him lift a foot and walk up to the little table where Harry sat transmuting tin.
For one second, Draco could see Ron’s mouth contort easy and fluid, ready to spout some lazy comeback, the type of rudeness only natural for friends. It opened like that, then closed into something completely different, tense and sudden.
Of course, Harry kept zooming higher and higher, past two Beaters who were fighting for the Bludger, rising above most of the players. Draco sighed, leaned lower on his broomstick and flew up to meet him.
‘No.’
Draco smiled. He’d been smiling since he’d woken, a paradoxical little thing between sated and longing, as liquid and dazed as the pleasant ache in his bones. He ought to look like a fool, he reckoned. Draco Malfoy, the fallen prince of Death Eaters - what could he possibly have to smile about? Oh, but he felt light, deliriously so with the lingering dripping of endorphins from last night, the mesmerizing reminders of heat and skin, the thrilling thought that, come the end of Herbology, he’d see Harry again.
‘Would you cancel them?’
Harry moved to pull off and answer, a hint of humour in his expression, but Draco stilled him with a tighter grip on his hair.
‘Because it was bloody strange,’ Harry snorted. ‘And I was going to say you ought to join us next time - which was fucking obvious, by the way, why else would I mention Hogsmeade? - but you just left.’
‘No, it’s not,’ Draco agreed. As he was wont to, though his nerves were still thrumming loud and high-strung, he chased him into the center of the room.
The poor boy went red as a beet. Draco hid his smile by taking a sip of his firewhiskey.
The walk to the infirmary, on the other hand, went much less swimmingly. Pansy parted from him halfway to place the mallowseet in the supply closet; she didn’t as much as give him a steady look, leaving like Draco’s task was the simplest thing in the world, no need for threats nor encouragement, and thus, in this surety, Draco felt impossibly obliged to go through with it.
‘My problem- are you bloody kidding me?’ Ron snapped, a furious glint in his eyes. Right on the edge, and Draco could retreat, and Draco could push.
‘Potter,’ Draco said, stretching his arm on some reckless impulse to catch Harry’s and pull him closer. ‘We could do it in the owlery for all I care.’
You’re getting your boyfriend a present, and then you’re going to apologize for saving his life.’
'And say what?'
‘Fruits?’ Nearly Headless Nick asked, his voice high-pitched in confusion. Then, with one very audible click in his mind, his eyes widened and his head slid right off his neck, dangling by sinew.
‘Malfoy! Parkinson! Good evening to ya,’ Finnigan greeted. His chin was so low in his smile that it practically dangled from his face. Not drunk, however. Like a violin string, ever tightly wound, now shaken by a careless finger. Sugar high.
‘I don’t know
you get up here anyway?’
For one moment made impossibly slow by the heights of euphoria. Harry just looked at him with ragged breaths, his cheeks as pink as the potion, writhing against Draco’s tight grip on his hair. Then, he seemed to deflate, boneless, soft and vulnerable and mesmerizingly wanton.
been that amicable with him -, and she’d consent when he asked to leave, and they could return to Hogwarts and forget the whole night had ever happened. He’d sweep it out his mind, treasure the picture of Potter’s hand in the crook of his arm and be content with it, only with it, and try nothing else.
Maybe.
Draco huffed a laugh, toying with his glass of firewhiskey.
‘I hardly think he does,’ she said, though her tone had taken on something pensive. She leaned against the scratched wooden boards of the wall, sipping her drink, and Draco did the same. ‘We’re still best mates, the three of us. My relationship with Ron hasn’t changed much either, apart from the obvious,’ she flushed a little, which Draco thought was very understandable, since he had just sat in a table while they subtly listed off all their sexual preferences. ‘Besides, even if he does, it won’t be for long. He’s bound to find a girlfriend soon, once he gets over Ginny.’
‘I don’t see the point in hurrying about. It’s not like you’ll catch the Snitch in your state.’
‘Get the bloody hell out the fucking field, Potter!’
Draco laughed, kissing up his neck. ‘A bit. But you do owe me a compliment.’
‘Neither should you.’
‘Hiding in the loo,’ Finnigan shouted. His arm was swung over Hermione, whose gaze was still set on Draco. ‘He’ll never get back out here, I reckon.’
, because he was just so fucking
‘You kinda had it coming,’ Ginny remarked, at the same time as Harry uttered an amused ‘It was bloody daft, mate.’
'Does it matter?'
‘Everyone seems to like Ginny.’
‘It’s perfectly fine, Potter.’
Harry snorted and tried again, using the flat of his tongue, catching on a drop of precum that had bloomed on the slit. Then, with a little emboldened twinkle in his eyes, he wrapped his fingers around the base and guided the tip to his mouth.
Draco sighed, a sorry pretense at put-upon. He was already searching for his wallet with one hand, though, drinking the rest of his tea at once before they headed to the counter.
‘You fucked it up, didn’t you?’
‘Seamus didn’t like his shirt,’ Luna answered with a good-natured smile.
'I'll consider it,' he said; and, taking an apple from a nearby fruit bowl, he stood, 'Better be off, now.'
Draco rolled his eyes.
He was surprised by Harry’s laugh.
Draco snorted, then hiked the hand he had on Harry’s shoulder a bit higher, so he could dip his fingers just slightly under his shirt, teasing the skin there.
There was a slight rumbling to their left - a strange thing without preamble, enough to break the moment, to make them turn and see, through the translucent dance pairs that were already swaying together, the ghost orchestra set up a little way off, purring with the low notes of two ethereal cellos. A violin shrieked, a bone white piano began to play, and suddenly the music began loud and fluid in an eerie symphony. The ghosts danced with practised ease, impossibly light on their incorporeal feet; Pansy and Luna swept by them in a rustling of fabric; Draco led a hand to Harry’s hip by instinct, saw flashes of Harry’s hand around
Harry was slow to come down, shaking and panting and wobbling a bit unsteady on his feet. Draco, feeling dizzy himself, though for an entirely different reason, kept him supported by his hips, and busied himself taking long, deep intakes of breath. With spit slick lips, tasting deliciously salted from Harry's come, he pressed a myriad of hazy kisses on Harry's quivering thighs. He knew he was being unbearably sentimental, but he had just made Harry come, after all, so he hardly thought Harry would have the heart to tell him to stop.
And he was curious, he was, because surely someone would have found out if Harry and Ron and who knows how many more pesky Gryffindors had sneaked into the Slytherin commons, but that was only part of why he was so insistent - it was appealing, in some impulsive, decadent way, to prolong this moment with Potter. To stay there with him, in the cramped, ill-lit storage room, where they could only be as far as a few inches.
What I have to tell you is that cooking would be much more fun if the ingredients had some of the names from the HP universe. Like, gillyweed? Yes, please.
Harry huffed a laugh, tried to lift his upper half again, but Draco pushed him down to prevent their erections from slotting together - there were a lot of pictures in his mind at the moment, like the one of Harry biting his neck with the prettiest of sounds as Draco pushed into him - and he was afraid too much friction would send him over the edge.
‘Why didn’t the Healer fix you?’
‘D’you get me a drink, Ron?’
‘Oh come on, Harry, no one’s here to judge. You should see the shit these guys have already admitted to. Ain’t that right, Malfoy?’
‘Waiting for you outside,
It made him look, even unwittingly. Hermione’s arms were crossed, drowned in her black robes, her eyebrow raised. She seemed fierce in her friendliness now.
‘Would you shut- Merlin, Malfoy, what happened to you?’
‘Don’t be daft,’ Pansy drawled, tugging him through the halls. ‘We’re not going to the infirmary. At least not yet. We’re going to Hogsmeade.’
‘Yeah, you’re making that very easy right now,’ Harry huffed dryly. Draco figured he deserved it. ‘Do you want me to hate you?’
Ron flashed him a proud smirk. ‘They always let me in, ‘cause of the hair.’
Now it was Harry who looked down at the small cauldron. He was stirring the brew pointlessly, some nasty habit he’d picked up from Muggle cuisine.
‘I’ve seen one, you know? One night, on a beach. I find them very friendly, murtlaps,’ Luna said, twirling a strand of hair with her finger. The stunted pause was broken, the separate conversations resumed, and Draco slowly relaxed again.
He did, and the sound was blissfully refreshing. ‘Just fucking unbutton it, you twat.’
‘In the game,’ Harry’s gaze was skittering around his figure, always a neutrino away from properly landing on Draco, ‘The game, earlier, when we were talking about the scars - the one you said, not the Dark Mark, the one on your chest. Was it the one… was it me that did it?’
‘Perhaps if you were silent time would move faster,’ said Draco.
‘We’re going for shots then, are we?’
‘Where are we going, anyway?’
‘You just look so bloody lovely when you’re desperate.’
'I know you do,' Draco snorted, lazily kissing his cheek. 'I also know you'd like what I'd do to you if I had enough time.'
, Draco would have made sure it came out perfect.
Draco, of course, knew those were Potter’s favourite. He knew, because for years he’d watched him swipe them greedily off the Gryffindor table at the Great Hall; because he’d spied him eating them with his friends in Hogsmeade, and wished he were able to make fun of him for his obsession not in a vicious way, but in a fond tone; because, during sixth year, when they’d learnt how to make Amortentia, he’d heard Potter had smelled treacle tarts, and felt a pang of heartache, since the first scent he himself had caught was the one of Potter’s hair.
Not that Draco was exactly partaking in that happiness.
There was only one moment of friction. It came from Ron, since he was by far the most loose-tongued, when Draco was discussing the healing properties of murtlap tentacles with Luna.
Harry stood at the top of the stairs. He was fit in a black suit, white shirt pressed and immaculate, collar straight, jacket sleeves snug around his arms, tie tightly knotted at the base of his neck. Formal, as Draco had asked - and he’d done it perfectly, he
Harry rolled his eyes. He wasn’t shouting anymore, however. More a tone of exasperation. Like Draco was an
The drunken glaze on Harry’s eyes, that made them shine a brighter green, was ridiculously endearing.
Ron seemed to process the information for about a millisecond before his mind caught.
Draco shrugged, looking at where Harry’s fingers had somewhat relaxed around the small red bag.
They watched the rhythmic rippling of the water in silence. So strange it was that, dozens of feet beneath them, he’d stared at the depths of the lake from the darkness of the Slytherin common room, pining for Harry late at night. Now here they were, lit by sunlight like a blessing, arms entwined as they shivered from the wind which wisped through the spindly trees, two blurring silhouettes lost between the immensity of the clouded skies, the grey lake and the somber castle looming behind them.

‘It’s american. They keep it on the back of the shelf.’
apology in that cramped, noisy, ungodly place, but then Hermione was reaching out for his arm and leading him out the suffocating crowd by the bar. They didn’t head to the table either; she brought them to a corner, next to the narrow corridor where the loos were, less crowded and dimmer, a refreshing break from the hectic energy at the center of the pub. The act felt strangely intimate, seeing as they’d been bickering just a little while ago, and Draco couldn’t quite believe that he was having a private chat with Hermione Granger in a pub, could hardly believe that was his life, but he wasn’t going to complain just yet.
All parallel conversations had descended into silence. Ron stared down at him from the moth-eaten sofa. Draco leaned fully against the coffee table, trying to maintain some shred of calm.
So, if he couldn’t make friends with them then, why would now be any different?
‘I’m first,’ Dean Thomas raised his hand excitedly, ‘Fletchley, mate, if you catch the waiter ask him for shots, aye? Three each I’d say. For the tough ones, you see?’ his smile was devious, and the table laughed, ‘Okay, then: never have I ever… been so drunk I blacked out.’
to him now, and that would be even worse - but it still brought about the most ridiculous urges, like Harry had said he liked him, like he’d been allowed permission to lace an arm around Harry’s shoulders and cover the prickly skin of his upper arms, so he could warm him not with his coat but with his own skin.
‘I don’t, mind you,’ Harry snorted. ‘Bloody difficult to get at Hogwarts. I’ll have to start using yours.’
‘Well, it’s true, isn’t it? If you did love him you wouldn’t give a shit about your moral code. You’d want him alive, and that would be that.’
But Harry’s grimace was smoothed over, only a veil of wry amusement shown.
Pansy spared him from his thoughts with a sharp call of his name.
Harry hummed, squeezing Draco's middle a little tighter. 'Great first date. A little short, though.'
. Harry’s tongue slipped inside for a taste, catching the burn of vodka, and Draco let out a low growl, a sound meant to
‘Honestly, you look like you’ve just shagged. It’s a good look on you.’
Harry kept still, a little smile on his lips. ‘It’s going to be shit, isn’t it?’
had a sexual fantasy about one of the professors; Sue and Finnigan were the only ones who’d ever tried anal sex - a round that was particularly difficult to get through, because Harry was
The waitress scurried off, Neville counted them to make sure Finnigan had ordered right - he hadn’t, but Ginny and Hermione would share - and Draco suppressed the urge to fiddle with his hands where they rested in his lap.
‘They’d be boring nights,’ Harry murmured then, tone measured, and Draco heard what had been unspoken: restless nights. Tossing. Turning. Nightmares.
‘You could?’
He looked at the lake once more, and Draco’s gaze followed. The snow still twirled lazily in the air, covering the fields in pristine white. Soon it would all begin to melt into the dew of spring.
‘With me, nothing is. Are you going to drink it before it gets cold?’
Draco chuckled. The sound came out a shade too breathless. He placed his hands lightly back on Harry’s hips. ‘Of course. But I assure you it’ll be very educational.’
could be a bit much, don’t you think?’
‘I didn’t mean to.’
Potter chuckled, no traces of surprise in his expression. Even though Draco knew it was justified, knew it was his own fault, it still made him ache.
But there'd be other times. They were
this.
This vigor, rewarding as it was in the moment - especially when it made Harry buck upward - did result in a particular sharp pain, and the telling taste of iron seeping into his tongue.
Harry cocked his head, swallowing another mouthful.
He leaned in himself for the first time. He was fucking surprised that Potter
‘Yeah? Any suggestions on how to do that?’
‘Malfoy,’ Harry breathed, a little whine that ended in a moan. The sound made heat pool in Draco’s stomach.
'Well, first we open you up,' Draco smirked, pressing one last wet kiss to Harry's painted lips before pulling away. 'Which means your slacks need to be off.'
better than that godawful absinthe. They sipped in silence for a moment, fingers wrapped around the warm ceramic, legs entangled below the table. Like a bloody pamphlet photo for the place - like all the sickly sweet couples he’d shied away from for years with envious eyes.
Draco's knees almost went weak that. Wasn't it simply the most dizzying thought, having Harry on his bed,
'For fuck's sa-'
things through.’
Harry’s eyes widened. His throat convulsed as he swallowed.
The symphony halted to an end, the ghosts’ murmurings audible now over the hushed tuning of a few instruments. It made Draco’s words seem too loud when he answered:
‘Yes. Pansy. Should I not have?’
‘And I might tell Finnigan you want to talk to him.’
‘I told you I do,’ Draco murmured. ‘I always do.’
‘I might die. It’s your fault.’
'Lay down, Harry.'
Draco laughed, though it came out small and soft under the sound of the rain. As Harry was walking towards the door, he stood in a jump and called out.
‘No. Come get a drink with me.’
was fun,’ Tracey remarked. Rowena’s virtuous laugh escaped from the cup of her delicate hand.
Digging his nails into his palms, he turned. The Slytherins had swooped down as well, standing a little way off, unsure of what to do. He’d go to them, and tell them to change for class, to pay no mind to what had happened. Nothing
Draco raised his eyebrows. ‘Well, get on with it.’
…' he chuckled, bold fingers creeping down to cup Harry's cock. He gave it a vicious squeeze, and bit off a grunt at the sheer
‘The punishment for blatching. You know, nowadays the other team gets awarded a penalty and that’s all. I say the player should be benched. I mean, trying to throw someone off their broom - nasty business, isn’t it? Wouldn’t want someone like that on my team.’
It revealed itself a particularly awkward situation, sitting next to Potter. The drinks soon came, and everyone was drinking their firewhiskey with giddy smiles, and talking in crossed conversations, and Harry - of course, because that was his element, those were his friends - was very fine with
‘We ought to come up with lies in case people ask.’
Not that it lasted long. No, because his body could be quite slow to get on with things, but his mind certainly hurried - sharpened, as it were, and decided, without seeking consultation, to pin on Harry in a tangle of those previous wonderings: what was he doing? where was he? how did he feel?
'Harry,' he said as he carefully untangled one of his hands from his pale hair. 'Keep playing with this one, yes? It'd be a shame to forget it after I spent so much time on it.'
'But you shouldn't have to.'
‘Same result.’
‘I believe Granger might finally like me,’ he answered carefully.
They began picking their flavours to the right of Neville. Ginny - and Draco would admit he thoroughly enjoyed the fact - got the taste of a dirty sock, and washed it down quite eagerly with one of the many neon bright shots that had arrived. Fletchley, cursed to be invariably boring, got strawberry. Dean Thomas impulsively asked him the same question: after a tense pause, Finnigan, again, was the response. Someone asked Luna which House she would rather be in if it weren’t for Ravenclaw, to which Luna unexpectedly - and after only one millisecond of thought - chose Slytherin. Hermione risked a greyish one that turned out to be mold; Ron went for a fluorescent green which, according to him, tasted either of sewers or corianders. Draco got the bottom of an ashtray, and squeezed Harry’s shoulder as he downed a shot.
Draco huffed, and took another sip of his drink. ‘Go ahead, then. But don’t think you’re off the hook.’
‘Will you go?’
The conversation went on - Luna, Draco thought absently, had asked some question. But Draco wasn’t listening in the slightest, because his body was nearly entirely faced towards Harry, and he was trying with all his strengths to reign back the longing in his voice and replace it with something akin to amusement when he spoke:
Not like he’d say all of this. Even if he were sure Harry would want to hear it, he didn’t know if he
'Are you tasting yourself on me, Potter?' Draco asked, cursing the obvious wantonness in his tone. He felt Harry's smile against his mouth.
about it; that he could describe it with explicit names and frilly, saccharine adjectives, that he could weave aloud the pathetic lyrics that came to him unbidden at night, when he was most desperately in love, and that Pansy would be there to
‘Oh,’ Draco blinked. ‘Potter, I was waiting for the right time.’
Draco finished his clementine. He thought of the whirlwind of insanities which had happened in that quaint little village: finding Harry at the bathroom in Kettle Bottom, that first night; Harry wearing his coat, the bloody treacle tarts, and Harry’s smile - mischievous already, as if he
‘It’s
Harry's nod was brief, his smile rueful.
‘Sure. What other strange compliments do you recall, then?’
‘I won’t. I won’t tell anyone, as a matter of fact. Seems a bit too good to be true, doesn’t it?’
‘Of course,’ Draco drawled. ‘Far be it that I should disturb your beauty sleep.’
, a permission to give him soft looks and whisper him sweet words.
'No,' Draco purred, 'I get to be demanding because you like it.'
‘Go to practice, Harry.’
‘I bloody hate you.’
Ron finished with a ragged breath. Finished with a look that was too heated for hostile. Finished, and Draco thought idly back to that exchange outside the greenhouses, where he’d mused that Ron could so easily plunge those pruning shears into his thigh. Perhaps the idea had really crossed Ron’s mind.
‘I had a question.’
‘Me too. Just imagine if you’d lost your virginity to
The place was as small as the stall from the Three Broomsticks had been. It didn't much matter - more of an excuse to press against Harry, to compact muscles together and have him flat against the door. Oh, and the firewhiskey had made Harry impatient: he tugged at Draco's hair, carved nails into his shoulder blade to pull him impossibly closer and bit ruthlessly at his lip, a scarlet flame between Draco's palms, ever shifting and all consuming.
Goyle was the first to spot them. He sauntered towards them in a striped suit, bow tie digging into his broad neck, took one good look at Harry and asked:
‘I always want you to say please,’ he said, voice painfully tight. ‘Right now, though, I just want to talk about it.’
‘Most of them,’ Pansy said - and her smile was perfectly poised into the emptiest little thing, and Draco had known since first year that she only showed nothing when she had something to hide.
‘Tell me first.’
Finnigan looked at him with wide, confused eyes. Draco got a few stray looks - one from Harry, that made him bite the inside of his cheek - but otherwise the heated conversation continued.
‘I suppose that would depend on your definition of fucking,’ he told him, voice hopelessly tender - and he knew the others could hear him, he knew that Pansy would
Draco watched bitterly as Harry joined his friends with a carefree smile, like he’d already forgotten his existence, like the conversation between them had been pleasant, sure, but unremarkable.
that prick.
‘Yes, yes, I suppose so,’ he murmured, ‘Get enough for the whole class, mind you. Mallowsweet is such a useful- get enough, enough for the first years too, yes? There’s an experiment with them I’d like to try, a delightful little... ‘
‘Ginny, you mean. Harry didn’t tell us too much. I reckon they both decided it wouldn’t work.’
Pansy wasn’t where he’d last seen her. She wasn’t sitting in one of the tables, nor in the middle of the crowd. She wasn’t in line for the bathroom either. Draco flattened against a wall by the stairs and waited for a little while some lanky Ravenclaw blew smoke in his face, feeling the vibrations of the slow, low-toned music against his back, until he was sure Potter's group would have left - then, he ventured out into the cold street to look for Pansy.
‘You wouldn’t dare,’ Harry smirked wickedly. ‘You’re the one who stuck me in here, after all.’
‘Guess now I know you really do mean it when you say that,’ Harry snorted. He seemed more amused than insulted, and it made Draco smile. ‘I have another question.’
‘Are you trying to prove something, Potter?’ he asked, yelling over the sharp wind.
It occurred to Draco, almost with surprise, that he was looking for the Snitch.
‘Depends on the day, really.’
, coaxed him up with the gentlest of touches, fingers sweet on his hip.
'Like
special, the type of memory one cherishes forever, and Draco couldn’t wait any longer. It wouldn’t hurt, he told himself. It wouldn’t hurt, he wouldn’t let it, because he loved Harry, because he was going to make him feel the best he ever fucking had.
‘Such a child,’ he repeated, smiling this time. ‘Answer me this, then: what you said about Hermione and Ron… Are we dating as well, then?’
- towards his right nipple. 'Other one, c'mon.'

‘You alright there, Malfoy?’
‘No possible way it gets
Draco followed only by instinct. His mind was stunned.
‘Sod off,’ he hissed, but it sounded more miserable than anything.
better if it lasts,' he raised an eyebrow, challenging Potter to argue, but he only stared in silent frustration,
, like he’d been invited, like he could maybe ever be one of the gears in that harmonious machine. They were discussing something, a heated argument about House Elves, and Draco hung back without the urge to chime in, content basking in this new reality, in this picture he’d dreamt of for so long.
He waved, a fleeting movement that died in his wrist, and scurried off the corridor in a brisk pace.
fucked?’
His thoughts led him up the Grand Staircase. Right in front of the Fat Lady - and Draco had never been quite so glad to see him - was Ron, waiting for one of the moving stairs to clasp on his level.
Harry was counting the vials of veritaserum. His eyes flittered to Draco only for a second before returning to the shelf, but Draco could see him smile to himself.
‘You’re bloody kidding me.’
in it for months, but he couldn’t find it in him to care when he saw Harry’s smile widen.
'You love him, but you don't want to fuck him?' Pansy looked pointedly at him, then gestured for him to hand over the glass, 'For a past Death Eater, darling, you're a wretched liar.'
‘Draco? Are you alright?’
- and wasn’t that terribly disconcerting? - while Harry tucked himself further into the curve of Draco’s side. In those cold, bare stone corridors they were the strangest picture of styled hairs, clashing colours and sweeping fabrics.
Harry's nod was immediate. 'Yeah, 'course. Just keep going, Malfoy, please.'
‘Yeah,’ Harry drew an amused smile. Around him, a puddle had begun to form. ‘Think you can make it?’
He looked into Harry's eyes, which were wide with surprise and a sort of carefree amusement Draco couldn't even hope to reciprocate. He wanted to show him in some way that they should stay quiet, hide in the fucking stall until Finnigan's unbelievably short attention span burnt out and he went looking for another drink, and then carry on with what they were doing - every way to do that, however, seemed so saccharine, so hopelessly telling, and why would Harry even agree and choose him over his friends? Over Finnigan, who was all charm and open arms, the twat… a soulful, simple Gryffindor who'd be more than happy to suck Harry's cock just like Draco had?
would keep quiet without a problem.'
Draco was on his heels before he could properly process the words.
‘Fuck off, it’s bloody hard. Merlin, Malfoy, give me some space, will you?’
Harry huffed a laugh. ‘I’m sure it would. I just-’ he broke off, biting his lip. He didn’t seem very happy with himself when he spoke. ‘I’ve never done it before.’
Draco clenched  his teeth. He supposed the words were meant as a friendly gesture, but they only brought him a sour anger. They went under an archway, crossed a corner, caught one of the moving staircases as it was sliding along the ledge. Most students were at the Great Hall eating right about then; Draco wondered if Hermione had sneaked out just to find him.
Draco guessed that surviving the War really did put things into perspective: they'd all returned to retake their last year - because not all of them were
At least that made him laugh, though it was a fickle little thing. Pansy rolled her eyes, and Draco saw in them, for a split second, some mischievous glint in them, right under the green shimmer, before she raised her voice:
Tracey’s loud sigh broke the moment.
, because he knew he hadn’t sounded convincing and he’d known as he said it that there was no way he could salvage that sentence, no way Hermione wouldn’t know what he had intended to say, and he watched with a white streak of panic as her eyes widened, narrowed, then rounded with surprise.
Harry followed eagerly to the dorms. With a flick of his wand, Draco lit a few candles, scattered bulbs of yellow light on the dressers and bedside tables, and then turned back to Harry, who was scanning the room.
to be the one to stretch it for the first time. He lapped at it more eagerly, sinking nails into the round globes of Harry's arse to keep him still, and heard a muffled sound as his head hit the mattress.
idea to drink veritaserum with Potter.
Draco could feel Harry’s eyes tracking his hand as he unashamedly picked up his drink, and he smirked against the brim of his glass. Let him wonder who Draco had done that for; let him know Draco was up for that, because he bloody was, because he’d noticed Harry hadn’t drunk and it’d risen in him a surge of curiosity and hunger. Fuck, he wanted to be Harry’s first, Harry’s
And Harry had wanted to invite him. Willing to give him a chance - because he might not fully understand him but he
‘He blew me.’
'One day you'll tell me that whole story,' Draco sighed, though he couldn't quite mask his fondness, and took him by the hand. 'Come on, dear.'
‘I think you’d remember if you had.’
He moved to leave, but Draco caught him by the arm on some urgent impulse.
When he did fall asleep, it was with the thought of that last contact between them: Harry’s fingers thrumming over his sternum, synching, for a single pulse, with the rhythm of his heart.
chase each other around a lot,’ Harry mused.
it, probably didn't think Draco meant anything by it, probably just thought it sweet, and Draco could definitely give him sweet, sicklier than those nasty treacle tarts, and it'd still only be a fraction of what he felt.
Harry's arms wrapped  around his neck while they kissed - but the edge of the sink was slim, and Draco's hands were so greedily frenzied in their touch that he didn't quite support him, and Harry nearly toppled over the side. He steadied himself by clipping his thighs tightly against Draco's hips, legs so pretty and trembling around his waist, and Draco moaned at the sensation.
‘Can I talk to you for a minute?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Draco.’
‘You looked adorable,’ Draco smirked behind the brim of his mug. Harry looked entirely unconvinced.
‘Worried you’ll get blood on your cock, Potter?’
‘Yes, I recall.’
, if she saw his eyes.
‘I guess we’ll never know,’ Draco shrugged. He didn’t think he would have, in all honesty. He’d always been so frightened before, so aware of Harry’s pedestal - not the one fame had imposed on him, but the one he’d
‘I was never
He supposed it was some sort of karma. Care too much, become the object of concern.
‘For as long as you keep being stubborn, at least,’ Draco retorted. The potion had turned the proper shade of green now, thin silvery stems floating in the water. He eased the jar off Harry’s fingers, more an excuse to touch than anything else. ‘You’re doing Gillyweed next - one vial, not two, and disentangle them first. Slughorn’s instructions will say two, though.’
Harry looked up at him again, brow furrowed, a little twitch to his lips like he was trying to suppress a smile.
There, staring intently at a dusty helmet that laid on the rough stone floor, was none other than Ron Weasley.
'Where are you going?' he urged, getting up as well.
'I don't want to date Potter.'
‘You can’t make decisions for him because you think you know best. Specially when your decisions end like
They took a seat by the window, ordered some chamomile, leaned close over the table, and Draco could look into Harry’s eyes - the green duller from the early morning, slower, sticking to everything - and know so simply that no other couple in that place, no matter their coy smiles and entwined fingers and pretensions of love, felt as strongly as the two of them did in that moment. It wasn’t even selfish to say, no, but exquisite fact: they were the height of love.
The question was asked innocently enough. But Draco knew Harry knew, and he knew what Harry really meant was ‘what did you tell him?’. It caused a surge of cold in him: this uncertainty in their relationship, or strict lack of it, felt like the desperate moment before he woke up from pleasant dreams.
Draco remembered those nights he’d spent loitering around Hogsmeade, wandering the streets and spying on this same group, and picturing he was there, next to Harry, an arm around him, or their fingers entwined, or simply the understanding that they were
‘No.’
‘And do
Harry’s smile was victorious. ‘I can try.’
‘I would have used it regardless,’ Harry’s eyes had sharpened; they made Draco remember the word that had been about to spill from his own lips that day, ‘I don’t get it, Malfoy. You said you never hated me. Why were you going to do it, then?’
‘You’re the teacher,’ Harry reminded, running a spoon through the viscous pink fluid. ‘Is it too bad, do you think?’
‘Yes.’
‘Yes. Alright,’ Draco said, dispirited. ‘Thanks for the tea.’
tedious. Such was the problem of gentle brilliance - like a poem, she served to be loved or admired, not to chat with. Blaise was enraptured by her all the same, and he leaned over the table to drink every rhythmic line she spoke; Pike followed the conversation quietly, his angular features shadowed by the red light; Draco, who was compressed between his friends in the claustrophobic space, knees bumping against Blaise’s and his back often shoved by strangers, was focusing on his firewhiskey, hoping its warmth would calm him and finding instead that it only enhanced his paranoia. He’d lost track of what his group was saying, choosing instead to spy the door through the dense crowd as if at any moment some recognizable Gryffindor would stumble through it.
He ought to leave. Really, that was the smartest thing to do. He wouldn’t be able to look Harry in the eye; he wouldn’t be able to pretend, when he knew there was someone at that table who would be able to see through it. Someone who’d detect the fondness in his eye, the shy warmth in his words, the desperate tendrils of love that were ever apparent in the cracks of his demeanour. How could he ever talk to Harry without remembering the way Hermione had looked at him once she’d realized, like she too knew he was doomed in this love, like she could see the endless suffering destined for him?
Pushing down his panic, Draco kissed Harry’s forehead, nose pressing into soft dark hair.
‘No. Not anymore,’ Harry said - and he’d said it under veritaserum, he
'Good,' Draco said, and then he was lunging down to kiss him, to compress his body down in a frenzy of heat and need, because Harry wanted it, wanted
“That’s a gendered insult!” Albus interrupted, smudged glasses sliding down his nose as he glared at Ginny. “If you’re allowed to say that why aren’t we?”
Every hand went up.
“Oh. Good.”
“Right then,” Harry continued. “Plan B, forgiveness. How are we going to do this?”
“Completely vile” said Draco.
“The point of the exercise is to reach the other side,” Draco helpfully offered.
“Sorry.” Harry didn’t feel especially sorry, he just thought Draco might like to hear it again. “I never watched that many films after I went to Hogwarts.”
“What?”
“Yeah, yeah.” She gasped, finally standing upright. “Never run when a wand will do.”
“You really think so?” Draco plastered on a big fake smile. “Thanks awfully! I guess I’ll just have to ask everyone in Slytherin why Nervy Weasel was searching for Blaise Zabini all over the World Cup stadium.”
“Yeah, but I think you can just say if you don’t want to.” Harry turned to the older boy. Cassius was the only Seventh Year on the team, and Harry had always rather hoped that if the two of them were to fall into conversation, it would be about literally anything else.
“Very, I guess.” He didn’t
“You didn’t answer, Haz.” Cormac reminded him, his grip on Harry’s shoulder for once gentle and his eyes warm. “Is Draz more than recreational cardio?”
“As opposed to when you were playing the part of Dumbledore’s sacrificial goat?” Draco’s mind was still half on whether he should call the Healer back and it took him a moment to realise and regret what he’d said. “Er... I mean to say...”
“Rather callous.” Draco nods to Percy’s huffishly turned back.
“Each other, yes.”
A gasp from Draco prompted Harry to open eyes he hadn’t even realised he’d closed. The pot was moving, sliding smoothly along the wall as the two of them watched. The sound of the pot falling off the wall and smashing against the paving stones seemed to energise Draco, and he swung around to face Harry, delight spreading across his face.
Malfoy glared at her, keeping his mouth shut.
“Brilliant eggs.” Harry insisted. “Not rubbery, brilliant.”
“I…I’ll ask Blaise to get his number for you then, shall I?”
“I make everyone breakfast.”
“You told me he fancied me and that I should ‘ride that Dragon into the sunset’.” Harry felt compelled to point out, wincing as he remembered how hopeful he’d felt after that chat. Not that Harry didn’t know his own mind when it came to Draco, but it had been nice to have his best mate’s approval and—
“Yes.”
“What is happening?” Turning, Draco watched as a group of Aurors, disguised as Muggle police, pulled their wands and got into formation to rush the Cereal Monogamist. The street was cordoned off, a crowd of spectators were held back by yet more Aurors as they craned their necks and tried to peer through the restaurant windows.
“Which poor children do you have a grudge against?”
“What?” Malfoy looked startled. “I complained about him all the time.”
“Well I’m sorry.” She hissed. “You can’t just tell us you’re breaking up and then not expect—”
“Hmm? Oh.” Draco was still distracted by being given a normal sized bowl. Was the time loop slipping? Was this what he had to do to escape? Somehow prove that he deserved a proper bowl of cereal and- “these tables are dangerous.” He heard himself respond to Potter’s question. “One scratch would be enough for blood poisoning to set in.”
Malfoy has joined in a bit, asking something about how Snape was able to conceal the prophecy long enough to sneak it out of the Ministry (“Cunning, Mr Malfoy. With great cunning.”) He then lapsed into silence, staring out of the window at the darkening evening sky.
“You want to sit outside?” Harry kept his eyes on the pixies as well. Was it possible that he liked looking at them? He’d as much as indicated in the Cereal Monogamist that he preferred his dates slim and pointy but Draco had assumed his taste ran to human-sized. “Not sure it’s warm enough for that.” Harry shifted slightly as he spoke and the backs of their hands brushed together. The soft pressure made Draco’s mind up for him and he spun 180 degrees, marching back the way they’d come. “Er, where are you going?”
“Yeah, you know how it is. Working hard or hardly working, it’s a modern conundrum.”
“Because Luna is sweetly terrifying and will probably terrorise us into being friends.”
Draco laughed before his brain caught up to the fact that he was laughing at
“Yes. Percy and his ardent defender who looks ready to insert one of her Louboutins into your ear.” Draco gives Pansy a small wave. She ignores him and continues to glare at Ginny.
-+-+-+-+-+-
“So, now that we have The Boy Who Lived supporting our cause, we can play a little game.” Malfoy’s eyes flicked to Harry’s when Harry muttered “not supporting,” under his breath. Smirking, Malfoy continued speaking to the audience. “As you can see I have some phallic objets d’art- ” fucking trust Malfoy to not call a dildo a fucking dildo, “ -and a number of unlabelled bottles of artificial lubrication. As you know, I am a Potions Master specializing in flavour making, testing, and tasting, and these are all my concoctions.”
“Pack it in.” Harry doesn’t stand, but tips his head back as Draco moves closer. “M’fairly sure that saviour stuff is why they’re calling on a Sunday. Making sure I don’t get too up myself.”
A chat really was the last thing Draco wanted. Potter still looked uncomfortable at the thought and after so much time lopping all Draco really wanted to do was curl up on the sofa with a glass of wine and some non-cereal based snacks.
“This way, I believe.” Mr Snape stopped at the end of the corridor, choosing a door seemingly at random and pushing it open.
“Draco.” Harry interrupted. “The point. I’m guessing you had one?”
“I. Was. Up. Set.”
“Well, children.” He spun around, smoothing his hair once more. “This has been delightful but I’m afraid I must join the Minister in the Minister’s private box and-”
on me?”
“Alright,” Harry spoke quickly.
Apparently unaware that Granger’s tears were as fake as Pansy’s nose, Umbridge was smiling. “Now, now, my dear. Are you ready to tell me how that nasty Dumbledore took advantage of you?”
“I do not give a shit, Draco. Why are you asking questions like that? You barely talk to me and then as soon as we spend more than ten minutes together that’s what you ask? Is this... Is this
“Of course it was you,” Draco tried to sneer. “I mentioned you by name.”
“Quickly, Potter. Let’s at least try to, er, sort this out without Lovegood breathing down our necks.”
“Malfoy? Malfoy? Malfoy? Malfoy. Malfoy. Malfoy. Fucking Malfoy.” Potter’s arms were folded and his eyebrows had retreated into his fringe. This was the longest Draco had managed to go before restarting the time loop — 11 minutes by the clock on his phone — and Potter looked like he’d been talking for a while. “You back with me?”
His expression was so mournful that, with a great sigh, Draco stood and marched towards the door. Maybe 28 would be the magic number to break the time loop, he reflected as he reached out to touch the cardboard monkey. And if it wasn’t at least Potter could order a less obnoxious bowl of cereal.
“No rainbow vomit.” He solemnly affirmed.
“You decided against a quiet night?” Draco was pulling out the chair next to Harry. He didn’t look particularly cross to find that his boyfriend had lied to him and gone off to the pub. Then again, why should he? It’s not like whatever they were was whatever it was, anymore.
“You do? Ok. Well that’s good,” said Harry, fighting not to grin like a complete idiot. “We still on for the cinema tonight?”
“Malfoy! Er... I can go?”
“Come on Malfoy,” Potter had obviously taken Draco’s silence for dissent. “We’ll catch each other up on the kids, take a selfie for Hermione... and Pansy” he quickly added, “and be done with the whole thing.”
“Ginny Weasley and Blaise Zabini.” Blaise spoke. “I have a permission slip from Madam Pomfrey to visit the Infirmary at all times-”
“I know you know my name, Dwaco,” Alicia sang, twirling around to face Harry and a bright pink Draco. “I’m asexual.” She shrugged and turned back to the twins’ bed where the rest of the Gryffindor team, minus Oliver and Harry, had reassembled. “So are we playing again with the consent charm or not?”
“Hmm.” She continued to inspect him over the top of her glasses. “Perhaps we have done enough for one evening. Let us resume on Wednesday. For now, I believe a cup of tea is in order.” With a flick of her wand, McGonagall conjured up the now familiar
The text ended with a dancing woman, a cocktail, a beer, and, inexplicably, another aubergine. Draco felt sick.
“Very well.” Draco smoothed his hair, pointless now that he didn’t have any gel in it, and marched out of the breakroom. “Are you coming? Potter? Or do I have to catch this criminal myself?”
Veelas, centaurs, vampires, mermaids, werewolves, house-elves, metamorphmagi, registered and unregistered animagi — the people making the laws didn’t seem to care where the human side of these creatures went to school or who their fathers were. Draco had checked, in a roundabout way, loitering in the library near the magical law section and owling his father convoluted questions about how far the new laws extended.
Despite dragonhide gloves reinforced with localised Protegos, it was dangerous work, and Severus really should not have been thinking about biscuits. Especially as he was fairly sure Griselda was using the HobNobs as bait for a cunning trap. The question of why Griselda appeared to be fixated on exposing Severus’ sweet-tooth to the rest of the Restoration Team was still to be puzzled out.
“You mean me?”
“Er, maybe another time,” said Harry, making a mental note not to venture over to that side of the hall.
“Exactly. You didn’t know him, and you didn’t know me.” Draco sat up against the headboard, his hip pressing briefly against Harry.
“Of course.” The mermaid smiled some more. “Sorry, let me just do this properly.” She raised her voice and sang;
“Shh.”Iincredibly, Draco sounded like he was already drifting back to sleep. “Don’t make it weird... Potter.”
“Look.” He said, wrapping his arms around himself and starting to bounce to keep warm. “I forgot, alright? It was years ago when I saw it, all I remembered was a film about two friends who overcame their differences. Also it’s called a ‘film’, by the way. Not that that’s important! Just, er…I’m sorry. I didn’t know that Tod—”
It was, without doubt, the most revolting display Draco had ever witnessed and he would probably be scarred for life. The announcement of which did nothing to stop his parents flirting and so Draco excused himself.
This, Harry remembered, was when he genuinely thought someone was going to tell him what the bloody hell was going on. Instead, Snape and Hermione had immediately got into a prolonged discussion about how prophecies were formed before synthetic dragon’s blood was developed as a stabilising element.
“No consideration for his own safety or how it would feel for Copper watching Tod…w-watching him…” Draco abruptly stopped talking and glared at the sky.
“Do keep up.” Draco called over his shoulder.
“Drink.” A plastic beaker of amber liquid slapped down in front of Draco. It had cheerios floating in it and Draco looked up in time to see the waitress place a matching beaker in front of Potter. Draco’s phone buzzed with a text as the waitress asked “Have you decided what you want to order yet?”
“I might. Come on... Draco.” Hermione had been very insistent that they start calling each other by their first names or, in Snape’s case, Professor. This discussion had been followed by pointed throat clearing every time surnames were used. When that only caused them to talk louder, Hermione’d charmed all the sofa cushions to deliver a Stinging Hex whenever anyone seated upon one said ‘Potter’, ‘Malfoy’, ‘Scarhead’, ‘Ferret’, ‘Weaselette’, ‘parents’, ‘cheated’ or ‘badges’.
“Just two hundred and seventy-three?”
“Ha!” Draco barked a laugh, watching breathlessly as Potter laughed back. “I suppose I should have known better than to think that the Boy Who Lived would be so shallow. Go on, then. What is it about Liam the Underwear Model that you prefer to Liam the Firefighter?”
thinking about Malfoy through all the phallic exhibitions of the fair and the prick had to ruin his accomplishment by actually
“Fuck off.” Harry pointed to a small dark squiggle near his right elbow, “This is an anti-snoring rune and you,” he pushed himself onto the elbow in question and pointed at Malfoy, “are full of shit. Why the fuck have you woken me up in the middle of the night?”
“Brilliant.”
“Yeah I am! Team record!” Angelina was scrambling up onto the last of the floating platforms, high-fiving Ernie as she reached the top. “Come on, Harry. You can snog Draco when you’ve finished the course.”
“Can you teach me how to do it? Cast one?” he asked.
“Oh.” Harry didn’t really know what else to say. It was a bit embarrassing to have all this explained to him in front of everyone. “Does everyone know the charm?”
“Just so. This transformation must presumably be permanent, otherwise the prophecy would be too easily broken.”
“We can talk about it tomorrow.” She said, tapping his glasses to remind him to take them off. “I’m nextdoor. It’s a single bed.” She held up a hand to forestall his protest. “There’s another bedroom down the hallway but it’s full of exercise equipment.”
“But Draco... he wanted to kiss me before,” said Harry, eyes darting around the room. The other Gryffindors flashed uneasy smiles his way, a few of them shaking their heads.
Cormac’s enthusiastic applause prompted Harry and Ron out of the stupor they had fallen into. Nodding graciously, the mermaid gave each of them a large green giftbag (“where was she hiding them?” Ron frantically whispered) and began happily answering Cormac’s questions about her handcuff preferences. Ron looked like he was slowly being boiled alive, the red colour in his cheeks deepening with every passing minute. Cormac, naturally, ended up buying three different pairs of handcuffs
“Spare us.” Snape appeared behind Draco. “Ms Granger, have you made any progress on the Animagus Potion?”
ssured him that the Dark Lord would not take kindly to the discovery of a second, illegal Animagus in his ranks.
“Is it a sexy bakery?” Cormac’s eyebrows waggled in time with his bulging, munching cheeks.
“Yes.” Draco blinked a bit. “Well the Malfoy Martyrs read the letters and, um. Well they avenged my honour, as it were, by performing a mass exorcism, not a very good one, but, ah, a few of the ghost guides got a little... splashed... by some of that Muggle firewhisky-”
The kitchen windows were charmed to show the view from the Gryffindor dormitories. The Great Lake sparkled in the distance. It was so small that when Harry stepped back to lean against the fridge, his and Hermione’s knees almost touched. “So this is where you’ve been then?” Harry reached out and kicked the toe of a trainer against one of Hermione’s Doc Martens. “Just hiding out at Snape’s, making a sandwich?”
“Right.” Harry pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes. The pressure was still there. “Because I don’t fucking trust him-”
“What?”
“No-oh?” said the waitress, giving him an uneasy look. “That’s Harry, he introduced himself when he came in.” The words ‘unlike some people’ floated unspoken between them. To think that Draco would see the day when a Muggle was using Harry fucking Potter to lecture him about good manners.
“Whose go was it?” he asked, watching the red mist streaming out of the bottle. How could the charm know who Harry did - or in this case, did not - want to kiss before he did?
“Forgive me.” She returned to her armchair, the urge to pace abandoned. “I was distracted; what were you saying?”
“Oh fuck you.” Potter laughed. “Yes the scar, old scarhead over here." He fixed Draco with a meaningful look. Draco ducked his head, still smiling. “But also the weight thing. Turns out people prefer their “saviours” skinny and malnourished.”
“Er.” As conversation openers went it wasn’t Harry’s worst. “Look, they’re probably short on space, alright Draco?” A quick squeeze of Draco’s shoulder stopped him mid-rant. Interesting. Filing this observation away for later, Harry continued: “Let’s just watch the tapes, sign the papers, and then go meet Gin and the boys. I even promise to fast-forward all the bits when your face does that weird pointy thing.”
Another laugh burst from Draco, loud enough to attract the attention of the nearby tables.
“Alright I asked you. But you’re the one who said Angelina should ask Robards if it could be included in the Auror fitness training program, making it impossible for either of us to back out.”
“Don’t know, do I.” Potter grinned, he seemed to be doing that a lot. “Didn’t really have a chance to make up my mind. Might have wanted to go for my old house colours or something.”
“That doesn’t mean they’re the same Liam,” he tried, wincing at the doubt in his own voice. “My Liam could still be coming.”
“That’s not true.” Harry turned back to Draco. The bed dipped between them. “About Seekers flying more. What about the Chasers?”
“It is one o’clock in the morning.” Professor McGonagall marched into the room, restoring the sofa to its original position against the wall with a flick of her wand. Various squeaks erupted from the sofa’s inhabitants. “We are here as guests of the Sheffield Central Travelodge, representing Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Everyone looked suitably cowed. “Never, in all my days, have I seen such a flagrant disregard-” She interrupted herself with a loud, jaw-cracking yawn. “Oh, I...”
“It’s to stop anyone kissing someone they don’t want to.” Millicent spoke up, twisting around on the horrible sofa to face Harry. “I thought Muggles had this game too?”
“Hmm, I was thinking of doing one of those team bonding weekends that the Muggles do; get the whole team away from Hogwarts. You know?”
“They’re in here,” Hermione’s voice cut through the delicious haze. “Hopefully you can talk some sense into them and— Oh fuck, okay.” Something fell over, and a muffled giggle reached Harry. “In the front room, I think,” Harry heard Hermione say. He really was going to open his eyes, any moment now. “Right this way.” Followed by the sound of Hermione and Luna scurrying past.
“You,” he breathed, shifting so that they were sitting very close together, their knees touching. “You moved the bottle.”
Draco’s mouth shut with a click and pain blossomed from the tip of his tongue. He stared at Potter. “What are you talking about?”
“No.” She spoke slowly, as if she was already sick of being asked this question.
“Would you like that, Cissy darling?” He asked, playing with one of her rings. “Life on a Tuscan farm with Bertie Waldorf drunk by 3pm and Binky rabbiting on about her piles?”
“S’nothing,” Harry grunted as he and Draco slumped back onto the bed, still glaring at each other. “Is it my go to decide what Alicia needs to kiss?”
Potter chuckled and shook his head, “Bit gruesome, Malfoy, but you’re not wrong. When Lily was three one of Luna’s twins told her that the only reason she could understand anything was because there was a fish living in her ear, whispering all the words to her.”
“Who was your first male crush? Diggory?”
Draco didn’t really think his father was wrong, exactly. He just wished Lucius could find a way to cosy up to the Minister without making empty promises that were likely to alienate Fudge in the future. After all, Draco had his own political ambitions. He was still a little fuzzy on what exactly these ambitions
“Potter. I... I’m sorry but... are you... are you trying to reminisce about the time I spent attempting to murder our headmaster?”
ASAP.
“Neither is being a posh twit who lies out of his arse,” Harry snapped. “But I didn’t notice you complaining when Lockhart was made DADA Professor.”
had got hold of it?”
While an afternoon of pointless trust exercises may have dented Hermione’s ego and head, they did not impede her love of learning. Specifically, learning how to be a better person than Draco and Harry.
“I see.” Draco looked thoughtful.
“Yes. In fact-” taking advantage of Harry’s confusion, Draco steps closer. “I did not see a tattoo of your face, which would have been rather terrifying, if I may point that out.” Harry huffs, rolls his eyes, does not argue. “What I saw-” Draco lifts hands that only slightly tremble, places one on Harry’s waist, the other cradles his right cheek. “-was a visual representation of myself, Draco, a dragon. On you.” Harry blinks.
Steaming mugs of tea in hand and sitting side-by-side on torture devices undercover as plastic chairs; Harry and Draco watched Draco arrive at the Cereal Monogamist. The projection was a bit fuzzy around the edges. Leaning forward, Draco made Harry’s week by pulling out a pair of silver-rimmed glasses, polishing them with a little green cloth, and perching them on the end of his nose.
“Fuck!” Ron hurried off, barking orders to the Junior Healers as the first of the Cereal Monogamist patrons emerged. A flash of black hair appeared and then disappeared at the back of the crowd.
“Harry.” Draco bent forward, his breath hot against Harry’s cheek. “I’m going to kiss you and I think you will find it a lot easier to kiss me back or— or— or punch me, or whatever you wish to do, if you are no longer babbling.”
“Sure,” said Harry, sitting up against the headboard and resigning himself to being lucid. “Right after I break the prophecy and get out of this shit hole.”
“Probably.” Potter didn’t seem especially distressed by this revelation but Draco’s stomach was in freefall.
“I... I don’t know. I didn’t know him,” Harry corrected himself, hoping that this wasn’t the start of another of Draco’s lists.
“Er...”
“Hoping to take out a loan?” It wasn’t one of Draco’s best, but the image of all the Minister of Magic’s guests politely removing their eyeballs before sitting down was rather gruesome and he was working hard not to laugh.
“He isn’t very fond of his, um, shape.” Draco continued, reminding himself that Potter had already shown himself sympathetic to Scorpius. He might even have some advice and he wouldn’t remember the conversation, anyway. “Sometimes he isn’t as careful of himself as he should be.”
In short, Draco really had been working long and hard to make up for his mistakes and prove himself to be a decent person and–
is a serious legal issue that-”
“Draco?” Harry is covering the phone, twisting to look over his shoulder. The movement makes the edge of his t-shirt catch against one of the cushions, and there it is again. “Do you need the phone? I’ll just be a minute.”
“I said,” Potter enunciated slowly, “Are. You. OK? Do. I. Need. To. Call. A. Healer-”
“Oh, yes, thank you.” Draco grabs the jug, dumping half the contents into his bowl and hastily passing it down the table to… “Ginny?” Had she been sitting next to him all this time?
“I think so.” Angelina looked over to Fred. “It gets taught in primary school with all the periods and sex stuff, right?”
“Shhh.” Draco wrapped his arms around the shaking boy. “It’s alright, I’m alright.”
“Probably 5th year,” Potter readily replied. “It was during the Triwizard Tournament. Cedric suggested that I pay a visit to the Prefects Bathroom, for a bath, you know and-”
“Alright Draco!” George rubbed his hands together. “What’ll it be? The Slytherin badge? The moldy shower curtain?”
“Definitely not. How about some toast?” He gathered up his courage and did a quick inventory of his fridge. “I’ve got some eggs in the house.”
“Then why on earth did you suggest a trip to the film?”
“Look,” he sighed, grabbing Draco’s hand. He fumbled with it a bit at first, taking a moment to make sure that all their fingers and thumbs were arranged in the most comfortable way. “I know you think that I’m an idiot-”
“I’m not ashamed of him,” said Draco, reaching for Hermione’s wine and downing it in one. “Not all families are the Weasleys.”
“Of course. Kidnappings, prophecies...” Harry was distracted looking for his glasses.
At this, the girl smirked and pointed at an exceptionally battered stone phallus. “One thousand three hundred and twenty-two B.C. Tutankhamun.” Her smirk grew wider. “Went through the whole dynasty.”
“She tricked me,” he looked up at Potter. Potter grimaced and took another swallow of his drink.
“Have you forgotten he’s the only reason your mum didn’t end up in Azkaban?” That was Ron.
So he joined the Inquisitor Squad and, for a while, he liked it. Watching the younger students duck their heads when he passed and being able to silence even the most rambunctious Gryffindor was a heady experience. Pansy joined the Squad as well and the two of them reigned over the Slytherin Dungeons, the same way Draco’s parents must have when they attended Hogwarts.
“Was that Dad?” Al demanded. “Is he alright?”
“We’re putting together a Ministry team.” Angelina continued. “You up for it Haz?”
“A date?” asked Draco, scrambling for a distraction. Why on Earth had he asked about death? He had absolutely zero interest in hearing about Potter’s lonely journey into the Forbidden Forest. Well maybe not
“Thought we agreed you were going to stop matchmaking, mate.” Harry paused to examine a ‘How To Become A Daddy Kit’, recoiling when he realised it had nothing to do with conception. Merlin, people really did have to ruin everything these days, didn’t they?
“It’s only Percy.”
“Hold up.” Ron raised a hand. “You said you weren’t shagging.”
“What? No I’m not.” Harry protested, even as Hermione was helping him into the bed.
“Or more.”
“Um, no,” said Harry, biting the end of his own tongue to avoid laughing at Draco’s newly acquired Muggle slang. “Was he fit, then?”
The block of flats looked like it was held together by half-hearted sticking charms and luck that was about to run-out. A waft of urine floated down to meet them as they climbed the stairs. Breathing shallowly, Harry concentrated on putting one foot after the other. Mr Snape didn’t seem to be bothered by the smell. Tall, gaunt and greasy, he reminded Harry of a jolly Dementor, dancing ahead as Harry walked further and further into what could easily be a trap.
“Are you wearing glasses?” Harry didn’t even try to keep the delight out of his voice.
“No cereal.”
“What can I say, Potter? That I am extremely impressive? That I do rather relish an intellectual challenge? That I have a natural affinity for-”
“Shhh! You know, the, erm—” Harry glanced at Draco. Draco blinked back at him. “The spell I used on Malfoy.”
“It’s actually called ‘the cinema’–yeah ok not important. I thought it would be fun and you wanted to learn about Muggles so…”
“Mm, stand up. Please.”
“Oh. Is he?” Draco doubtfully scanned the five tables squished against the far wall. Three of them already contained couples, while the other two had people who were decidedly not Liam the Underwear Model. One of them was a tall, skinny woman with a prominent chin who was wearing turquoise headphones and the other person was... “Fuck,” said Draco. “That’s not Liam”.
“Are you sure?”
When Ron returned with Cormac, it turned out that Cormac did, indeed, have a photo of his arse at hand. Thankfully, it was only a picture of his bum and not his anus, so the only thing the woman could divine was that he should target his gluteus medius in his training sessions because the muscle was underdeveloped.
“Fuck off, Potter," said Draco, turning towards the door. He felt a light tug at his coat, followed by the smack of a falling cereal bowl. He didn’t look back. Behind him Potter shouted Draco’s name again and one of the diners tutted over their spilt cereal. Draco kept walking. He brushed passed the cardboard monkey, felt a sudden hitch behind his belly button, and the world went dark.
“You are such an idiot,” said Angelina. “I’ve half a mind to mount a coup.”
The Badger’s Bunion was a big, scruffy pub, perched on one of the many fault lines between Muggle and Magical London. It was also the first search result that had popped up when Draco typed “normal pub for normal people” into Woogle. Casting a glance over the scruffy exterior, large windows plastered with the posters advertising 2-4-1 Jaggerbombs and Selfie Shots, Draco ruefully conceded to himself that normality was overrated.
The pain potion did nothing to stop the headache clawing at the front of Harry’s skull. As they talked into the evening, Hermione and Snape’s voices blended together, and Malfoy’s pale face watched Harry’s reflection. At some point Hermione had taken Harry by the arm, tutting “you’re dead on your feet”.
Speaking of which… Draco refocused his omnioculars. Blaise was almost as easy to spot as the Weasels. The Nott box was nowhere near as grand as the Minister’s but it was impossible to overlook, decked out in the family colours of green and purple like a box of Honeydukes chocolates. Theo was whispering something to Blaise, the two boys bursting into laughter as Draco watched.
Harry was in hell.
“You can’t tell anyone,” he said, guaranteeing that the whole year would know by lunchtime. “My father has donated a clutch of Nimbus 2001 brooms to the Slytherin team, I got first pick, of course, but if you hang around there might be a spare one going.”
“I…” Harry’s eyes are fixed on Draco’s long, pale fingers.
“Right,” Draco nodded, readying himself to crawl through the tires.
“Haz.” Another heavy hand dropped on his other shoulder. “There’s something in your eyes that tells me Malfoy is more than recreational cardio to you.”
“Hmm.” Potter hummed, playing with his glass. “I suppose. Personally I’d be keener on the underwear model.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to go back in time and not send a slimy git to steal my memories and kidnap me?” Harry stage-whispered back.
Even though he was the one who initiated it, Draco pulled out of the hand shake as if he’d been burnt. “Take it off.” He turned to Mr Snape.
vaginas. His face had flushed so hard he almost put Ron to shame, while Cormac loudly and excitedly proclaimed, “Ha! A cock and fanny fair!”
“No cereal.”
“Yes.” Draco pressed forward to kiss Harry properly. “Fuck, yes.” Draco’s free hand crept into Harry’s hair, pulling lightly at his curls. Soft sighs filled the kitchen, the soft, wet press of lips and tongues and if Draco kept slowly moving his hips like that Harry was going to explode.
When Harry woke again it was dawn. The London traffic was starting to rev as the orange light pollution faded into grey sky. Blinking, Harry realised he still had his glasses on. The bridge of his nose hurt, and his right temple throbbed where the arm of the glasses had dug in.
“Why?”
“Did you even eat any of the cereal?” Harry asked. “Cause m’pretty sure that that-” he nodded to the space where the screen used to be, “-was just your personality.”
Harry had been pressured into attending this...this - he hesitated calling it an event - he even hesitated calling it a fair, even though the word was in the official title. Fair of Artful Pleasure, or F.A.P., as the sign above the entrance hall declared proudly. The sign, the acronym notwithstanding, wouldn’t have been quite as traumatising if Harry hadn’t noticed there were penises and vaginas painted inside the letters.
Going to Hogwarts immediately soothed Draco’s ferret. His spontaneous transformations practically disappeared overnight, aside from an embarrassing incident after being caught out of bed by Professor McGonagall. Pale, trembling, and still bewhiskered, Draco had sat in McGonagall’s study while she and Snape whispered to each other behind a Muffliato. Was he going to be expelled? Reported as an illegal Animagus? Would his mother be put in prison? What would his father say? Panicked plans for escape chased each other through Draco’s mind and by the time McGonagall returned to the sitting room he was halfway through another transformation.
“Of course love,” said the waitress, scooping up the rejected Cheertinis. “Just so you know we’ve got a surprise selection menu tonight. You choose a bowl colour and the chef creates a meal specially tailored to match your personality.”
“That sounds very interrresting,” she said, feeling a bit breathless. “Remove them from their house rivalries-”
“Oi, Hazza! S’on you, mate!” Harry looked up to see that George was right and the bottle was pointing at him.
“People are fools.”
“Some of these look ancient!” Harry didn’t know whether to laugh hysterically or cry. “Merlin knows how many people went through them!”
“Hmm, you in distress love?” The faux frenchie switched to a Bristol accent. It was distracting and Harry almost forgot that he
“Why did they use the same name, I wonder.”
“Potter!” Draco snapped. “Could we please finish this ghastly exercise without getting bogged down in scenarios about whether the non-existent Liam would have buggered or bludgeoned me over a bowl of Frosted Wheat?”
“Nothing we can do about that,” said Ron. “They’re professionals. Come on.” He stood, holding out a hand to help Draco up. “There’s someone who wants to see you.”
“I don’t want to know.” Harry stood, wishing he’d volunteered to go with Snape to the chippy. “Talk about something else.”
As if summoned by his thoughts, Draco’s phone flashed with a message from ‘Pussy-Patrol-Parkinson’: a string of aubergines, followed by a pair of underpants, a kissy face, a moon, a glass of wine, and a snake. Pansy had been trying to set Draco up with Liam the Underwear Model for months and had eventually enlisted Draco’s son in her ongoing campaign to “replace that broomstick up your bum with something far more pleasant.” Although Scorpius Malfoy remained blissfully unaware of the campaign’s title.
“Pointiness?” Ron suggested, through a mouthful of crisps.
“An inaccurate representation of the Chaser position?” Harry grinned back. “Seriously, they spend most of the match flying while we’re floating up top.”
“I know,” said Draco, casting around for a distraction. “Do you,” he licked his lips, unsure if the question he'd been dying to ask since the waitress interrupted them would salvage or sink the conversation even further, “do you find yourself constantly angry on your children’s behalf?”
“People can change their minds, though,” said Alicia. “Not much fun if they can’t, is it?”
“Honestly,” Draco sniffed. “I really could not care either way. If you want to stay, then I want you to stay. However, that is hardly the same thing as
“Alright?” She grins, passing the nearly empty jug to Percy. “Something on your mind?”
“Not that.” Potter dismissed Draco’s pre-date research with a wave of his hand. “I meant what kind of idiot picks a cereal cafe for a first date?”
“Thank you.” Draco still hadn’t eaten any himself. “Well? Are you going to see him again?”
“Um, are you, ah—” Harry finally looked up to see that Draco was standing much closer and doing a weird little patting thing to Harry’s shoulder. “Are you having some kind of... episode?” Draco’s face was screwed up into a concerned pout. “Because you don’t seem especially concerned that Hermione is in the process of fetching Luna to “sort you out.””
“Oh-kay...” said George, summoning the bottle of water Greg was still drinking and Vanishing the contents. “Many apols my man Gregory,” he said, winking at the spluttering Slytherin. “Tori, you mind giving me a hand with this?” Nodding happily, Astoria pulled out her wand and began to cast what Harry assumed was the consent charm.
He couldn’t stop replaying the way Draco had sighed when Harry kissed him. A small, bitten off whimper that Harry had hardly noticed at the time, but was now running through his head on a loop. The slick feel of Draco’s tongue against his, the way his long nose had gently pressed against Harry’s cheek. With a shudder, Harry realised that he was at half mast.
Another snap of her fingers, and the mug floated over to Harry. The picture on the front was of a tall, thin, blonde wizard who was—much to Harry’s consternation—already topless and leering.
Draco then attempted to antagonise the barman into throwing him out of the restaurant, just in case there was some kind of reverse vampire situation in the mix. Unfortunately there are very few insults that a man who mixes cereal-sprinkled cocktails for a living has not heard and become impervious to. In the end Draco was reduced to sitting on top of the bar and singing an off key rendition of Hoggy Hoggy Hogwarts until the waitress cracked and escorted him outside. Which of course didn’t work and now Draco was forced to live with the knowledge that in at least one dimension Potter had witnessed him being told off by a woman wearing shoes made out of milk jugs.
“Er, hello,” said Harry, watching in amusement as the woman snatched up a tennis racket and swatted a rogue dildo away from the pamphlets.
Something, Draco realised, was amiss.
“Yes, nice for them to be sorted together,” he said. “Scorpius talks about Al all the time. Dotes on the boy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The thought of Draco caused Severus to drag both hands down his face, dislodging more crumbs as he did so. Lucius and Narcissa would never forgive him if he allowed their son to become embroiled in yet another Potter-centric palaver. The Malfoy parents had emigrated to the continent within days of Lucius’ discharge from Azkaban, nominating Severus to watch over Draco.
“It’s temporary. One of the magical ones George is trialling at Wheezes.”
Wormtail’s pathetic attempts to ape his betters had always struck Draco as reason enough for the Dark Lord to scorn the little rat. To snigger with Lucius when Wormtail insisted on “pimping out” his silver hand, and to sneer when the Rat Man forgot himself and swore at the dinner table. Peter Pettigrew was the kind of social grub who, given the smallest chance, would burrow beneath the skin and start laying eggs. In the presence of those whose approval he coveted, Wormtail’s rough accent would transform into a squeaky imitation of Draco’s own drawl. His table manners were atrocious, he asked for beer with dinner, dunked his biscuits, referred to the lavatory as ‘the lav,’ and wore polyester robes.
“I didn’t mean-” the kitchen door slams shut. Honestly. He huffs, casting thawing charms at his own fingers. Poor old girl was probably uneasy about leaving Percy and his mother alone for too long, but there really was no need to- “Oh hang it all.” he snaps, Banishing the stubborn scarf and following Pansy into the warm glow of the kitchen.
The mist from the bottle turned red this time, and the Weasley twins immediately insisted that Draco should kiss the Gryffindor badge on Oliver’s Quidditch jersey. Marcus protested in the strongest of terms, both as a Slytherin and as Oliver’s boyfriend, and by the time Draco had bestowed a sneering kiss on George’s pot of hair gel they had run out of sweets.
Severus puzzled all this out as he absent-mindedly brushed biscuit crumbs from his robes and tried to avoid all thoughts of
“Liam.” Pansy had insisted that the reservation be made under Liam’s name, “they’ll only call you Drake, darling, and you know how cross that makes you.” Draco did not personally believe that he looked like a Liam but the waitress’ iPad seemed to believe him as she beamed and pointed towards the back of restaurant.
“Bring it, Potter!”
A chair screeched and Harry felt Draco shuffling next to him.
Draco had expected to feel a sense of triumph when Potter’s Poseurs (as he nicknamed them, much to Pansy’s delight) were apprehended. His role on the Inquisitorial Squad had stopped being fun a while ago, somewhere between casting a barrage of Tickling Charms on squirming second years and Blaise’s look of resignation when Draco called the Weasleys “Mudbloods”. Recently Draco had spent most of the nights after his IS patrols lying awake, listening to Astoria’s dreary Muggle albums and trying not to think about his bedroom back at the Manor.
This thought was at the forefront of Draco’s mind as he scuttled along the corridor. It was well past bedtime and Hogwarts was silent, the only light came from flickering torches and insomnia-afflicted ghosts. Ideal conditions for Draco to practise controlled transformations and take advantage of his ferret’s night-vision.
“Sorry.” Ginny ducked her head, the pink of her cheeks suggesting that she hadn’t yet lost
“Well?” Poppy’s question reigned in Minerva’s wandering thoughts.
“Even if he’s wrong?” Narcissa’s hissed inhale let Draco know that he had spoken out of turn.
“Oh, but I would.”
“Fair enough,” said Harry, glaring back. “But what about the hand holding? Hmmm?”
Blaise Zabini, Draco reflected, was exactly the kind of friend he should be making, rather than that Scarhead Saviour. Unlike Potter, Blaise was positively eager to accept Draco's friendship. Draco liked to think that this was because Blaise appreciated Draco's ready wit and regal Malfoy bearing, although in his heart of hearts Draco knew that it was his own social ambitions that had won the day.
Despite their many promises to go straight to bed following a dinner composed entirely of soporific breakfast foods (“Only thing I know how to make,” Chrissy shrugged as she deftly flipped seventeen slices of fried bread) everyone was too buzzed to sleep. Professor McGonagall, Madam Hooch and Chrissy had retired to the empty hotel bar for “a wee dram,” so the Slytherdor team all crowded into the Gryffindor boys’ room.
The Portable Swamp only took a few minutes to completely cover the floor. This was more than enough time for Draco to start having second thoughts. And third thoughts. And fourth and fifth and sixth thoughts. Basically, he was having a lot of thoughts, and a few feelings, about signing up for this.
“Well.” Draco shrugged. “I do dine out a good deal and the menu is fairly intuitive...”
“You know,” Draco said. “One of the ways Muggles keep warm is to hurdle together. We could,” his eyes darted over to Harry. “We could do that.”
“You were snoring.” Malfoy’s face loomed above Harry, pale and moonish in the most irritating way imaginable. It was still dark.
“Rude, guess I’ll be having these back.” Ron grabbed Harry’s packet of crisps. “So, Malfoy.”
“Yes, very well.” Professor McGonagall drew herself up to her full height, looking incredibly composed for a woman who had just shown everyone her tonsils. “Back to your rooms; I do not want to hear so much as a peep from any of you for the rest of the night.”
“Wow! Really? Wicked!” Cormac exclaimed while examining a small ivory penis. Ron snatched it away from him.
“Surely not.” Draco croaked.
The corridor was boring and the lobby was creepy with all those dust sheets, so he wandered outside, shivering as the night air nipped at his throat and fingers. Crossing the strip of pebbles and a few empty flower beds that separated the hotel from the carpark, Harry made his way over to what Chrissy had insisted on calling “The Grotto.” It was only a bench with a bit of straggly vine hanging over it, but it was tucked out of sight of the hotel, just in case the professors were awake.
“Just schoolboy rivalries,” he called back. “You know how it is.”
“Fine.” Malfoy shrugged. Hesitant, he poured the contents of the flask on another ‘phallic objet d’art’. His hand was trembling when he handed it to Harry. Why was Malfoy so concerned? As if Harry cared if the lube hadn’t been perfected yet.
. Draco repressed the now familiar desire to scoff at the babyish design. It was part of the same set that Daphne’s mother used for their Halloween high-tea, very much a novelty item and not to be used day-to-day.
Now that the swamp was ready, Ginny and Angelina were busy charming various obstacles into place. A climbing wall, a tire tunnel, monkey bars and some floating platforms. It didn’t look very much like the pictures Angelina had thrust under Draco’s nose.
