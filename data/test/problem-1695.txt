Seamus smiled and led him to Hermione's room. "We're not supposed to be in the girl's dorms, but I don't think McGonagall will mind if you're helping someone out," Seamus told him, and then left.
"Moon frogs? Wastchippers? N-Nargles?" Luna asked as she looked around.
It didn't take long for his mind to come up with an answer, he didn't even have time to finish his sentence before he knew exactly what this was,
angry, and he didn't know why.
"Well, I am." Draco started to back away as Firenze grew closer.
It took an embarrassingly long time to convince Harry that, no, he was not in love with Nott. Hermione was no help, and Draco had no desire to talk to Ron
"Oh, Potter's got a boyfriend now?" Draco recoiled at the sound of a new voice, letting go of Harry he looked over at the person who had made that stupid comment and cringed when he saw Nott, smirking.
"That's all I want, Terry,"
***************
"What's wrong?" Ron asked.
___________________________________________
"You..." Harry gasped.
"I'm a Veela." Draco breathed out, as if testing the sentence out, as if trying to convice himself this was real.
Harry raised his wand, making the wand movement for the
He heard someone clear their throat, they let him go and he turned around to see Lucius Malfoy glaring down at him.
If you're confused on how I described the bowing, it's much like how they used to bow in the past centuries, it's a gentleman's bow and a lady's curtsey.
"I hate my father, I don't agree with him, and you look like you could use a friend."
"Yes!" He jolted. He kept zoning out; why did he keep on zoning out?
"It should 150-"
letting it get spoiled for him like in first year. He shuddered.
"Now-" Draco was cut off when the car started wiggling and the invisibility shield came off, Ron looked happy and fearful at the same time as he jammed the button again, only for nothing to happen,
Draco knew what he had to do now, he looked at Harry and then he looked at Quirrel.
"Courting?" Harry asked, and he knew that he sounded terribly lost.
"She told me to give you this, a gift, for her forgiveness." Lucius handed him a book, a black leather book, it looked old and tattered, Draco opened the book only to find it empty.
"Reading tea leaves," Harry answered.
Ron sat down on her left, while Harry took her right. Harry put a hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry, Hermione, we'll figure something out."
be able to change the timeline, fixed points do not mean that he is unable to change anything. A fixed point is the universe building the basis for that line, and since this is a branch of the main line, certain things have to stay the same to make up the context of that universe.
He leaned over to see what they were talking about. He saw Granger's timetable and his eyes widened. It was insane! No one could do that. Sure, he could think of a few ways to do it but all of them, he felt, would be putting to much work into classes. Hermione was already a top student, only under Draco. She didn't need to overwork herself just because she wanted to learn more. She could just ask for a few extra lessons onf the weekends or maybe some extra work over the holidays!/p>
He didn't know what to do.
He was going to castrate Potter for making him go in the forbidden forest again.
That was one favour done for a Ravenclaw, only a few more to go, little by little, he would make his housemates like him.
He walked over to Anthony's bookshelf. Anthony had been rather interested in flower language ever since he had started wooing Luna. Luna absolutely loved the language of flowers so he had many books about them. It wouldn't take too long to find the meaning of a blue rose.
"Draco how'd you do that?" Patil yelled in amazement as Draco preformed the spell non-verbally.
"Good, because Weasley is a jealous man. Very jealous," he muttered, mostly to himself. He remembered how Weasley had acted around that boy - his name was Cormac McLaggen? Or something - the glares he had given that boy were even more venomous than the ones he had given Draco himself.
Ron's face fell, "Never thought I'd say that," He muttered under his breath.
Draco's housemates all cheered for him, even the upper years, it looked like he was accepted now, he smiled and looked over at Harry who was giving him a thumbs-up, looking elated.
The simpler thought made Draco light-headed. Distantly, he saw Hermione get up with an angry look on her face.
"I should have seen it before," he said under his breath.
I'm having way too much fun writing this darling, feel free to leave a comment, I read every single one, as well as the bookmark comments, I love knowing what people think of my writing style and such.
"Draco." Who was it, he didn't want to get up.
"Wonder where the git's gone to now," Ron mumbled under his breath. But Draco heard it clearly. He shot him an irritated glance, one that was returned fully. It seemed Snape would never be something they would agree upon.
Gasps rang through the crowd, Trelawney whimpering at the simple mention of the omen.
"Sorry!" He bowed slightly, maybe a little to courteous.
Potter made his way off the stool and went to sit next to his friend, the Gryffindor table took quite a long time to quiet down.
Draco didn't have time to think about, he was suddenly being squished by three eleven-year-olds, apparently, he was supposed to hug them all at the same time, it looked like that had been taken care of.
Draco awoke on a hospital bed, his head was throbbing and his entire body ached, but he noticed one thing immediately, Harry, Ron and Hermione were standing by his bed, and Dumbledore was standing at the head of it.
"We are going to save him, Harry. And you are
He would need to get rid of that book,
"Hermione, he needs to breath!" Ron yelled, a grin on his face.
"Mr Malf-
"Awww." The twins said in unison and Harry doubled his glare at them.
Hermione didn't think.
She heard Ron huff next to her. He nudged her in the side, signalling her to follow him. Ron looked thoughtful for once in his life. Hermione wasn't saying that Ron was stupid; he clearly had the potential, but he didn't put in the effort. Even then, he still had qualities. He was a Gryffindor to the core and embodied all the things that Godric Gryffindor wanted in his students.
*****************
"What?"
Potter beamed even more, Draco had to admit that it was nice to see when he was still innocent, even if Draco knew that he was going to lose it eventually.
"Nothing." Potter mumbled and then looked back at him.
"It's...changed Draco somehow, he's different; like someone else is controlling him." Hermione narrowed her eyes when Ron scoffed.
"Harry James Potter, you get your things and get in this thing right now." Draco hissed, poking his head out of the door.
*********************
"What are Dementors?" Harry asked when they were finally in the common room. Draco had asked Professor McGonagall if he could go to the Gryffindor common room instead of his own just this once. She must have felt bad about the Dementors because she agreed, although with a few strict assurances that if they did anything wrong, they would have detention for a month.
"Wait, it's past curfew." Draco whipered when Potter started to tug them foward.
"Dobby!" Draco called out. Harry stiffened.
He could study it-
Harry looked at him in praise and astonishment, his glasses were crooked and his hair was more ruffled than normal. He was just about to say something when someone lifted him up,
"Then you should know, Potter, that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them have died yet. Seeing Death Omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues..." she trailed off. Despite the death prediction, Draco still didn't like the slander against the Professor. Sure, she might act a little batty sometimes, but it wasn't her fault.
Since Malfoy would be unable to do things like steal Neville's remembrall, Nott had to take his place, to make up the foundation so that new things could happen. Nott is his own person, he will do things differently than Malfoy because they have different moral compasses.
"I have to head back to my common room," Draco said, getting up. It wasn't a lie, per se. Curfew was fast approaching and Draco didn't want to risk detention, but he would have to implore the help of a few of his housemates if he wanted his plan to work.
He walked over to where he had hidden The Diary under his desk drawer and pulled Tom out. There was a quill and inkbottle on top of it of the nightstand. He didn't know where it came from, he hadn't put it there.
“Draco, why are you checking out books pertaining to Parseltongue?” Snape appeared behind Draco.
"You should have seen the look on Mum's face, 'There's a Malfoy in the fireplace!' and
Draco turned left and walked down the hallway, most likely leaving the room. Hermione didn't want to follow him, but she needed to know what was happening. Maybe following him would lead to clues, and she had the invisibility cloak.
Harry looked down and opened and closed his mouth a few times, contemplating what to say, when finally, he looked back up at Draco and opened his mouth, "They think that I'm a freak, they think that magic's abnormal, they didn't tell me that I was a wizard and told me that my parents died in a car crash."
Love you, darlings!
"Neither am I." Ron declared, and then both looked at Harry.
, Weasley had to take control of the situation and made himself the knight and look where that had gotten them, Weasley was about to sacrifice himself for the sake of a chess match, and they were being ridiculously sappy about it.
****************
His words brought some comfort back to Draco, and he wiped the tears off of his face, he wouldn't cry again, he would explain himself to Hermione, and if she didn't believe him, then she wasn't a real friend, just like Tom said-
Theodore Nott.
Draco's wand flew out of Tom's hand right as he was about to curse Ron.
Harry nodded, about to say something, but stopped when he heard a sniffle come from Hermione's stall. He looked at Ron and they both slowly walked up to the stall and knocked on the door.
"You would have been fine. You had us with you. Weasley would have scared them off with his atrocious fashion sense," Draco said in a tone of absolute conviction. A trait he had picked up from his mother. A tone that left no room for argument.
"You told her?!" Terry rounded on him.
"It's not that big of a deal." Draco turned a corner, face on fire. They were so close to the DADA classroom. Then he would be free of this torture.
But...they were his idiots.
He was a good 60 pages into the book when the train abruptly stopped.
"You lost, Tom. Even if...even if-" Harry couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence.
Hermione rushed to help him but was stopped when Harry yelled, "No! Don't move, don't forget, we're still playing." He looked calculating, for Merlin's sake, it was just one more move, there was nothing else to even think about, there was no reason to be making such a big fuss.
"Yeah, sometimes we forget how powerful your dad really is," Ron said, shrugging his shoulders.
"Ms. Granger! This is completely unacceptable! You will report to me for detention today at 8:00 pm."
Ron grabbed him by the shoulders and squeezed, hard.
"One carries power, the other's shall never know." Severus whispered.
Ron was still using Draco's last name. At least he wasn't spitting out accusations; they were making progress. Harry looked back at the room.
He thought he heard Professor Trelawney say something to Neville about his grandmother but they seemed far off, their voices muffled in a way. That was when Draco realized he had yet to come back from his post vision haze. It was something he always went through; the bigger the vision, the longer it took to regain his senses. He took a deep breath and calmed his mind. Occlumency was extremely helpful with things like this.
Looks like he needed to decode a prophesy, this should be fun.
But it wasn't like he would ever
"Most people don't like having their mind invaded, Godfather." Draco snarled, looking down, that had come out harsher than he had intended, but he didn't care, mind reading was one of his hard limits, he hated it, it made him feel bare, everything that he had ever experienced was open, like a book, and he
But there was no pain-
He jumped and slid down the slide.
"Good." Harry smiled, seeming to forget about his -what would you even call it- panic attack?
"She. Is. Sensitive!" Draco yelled and made his way towards the girl's bathroom, Potter and Weasley folllowing close behind him.
But he didn't--
"All right," Molly said as she pushed them both into the fireplace.
Where did that come from? He had sworn never to say that word again, he shook his head, he would not refer to Hermione by that word.
"Yes, your Eye has been taking quite a beating lately." On instinct, Draco's hand shot up to his literal eye before he realized she was referring to his Inner Eye.
None of them caught the shit-eating grin on his face.
And as always, Harry would frown but nod and would look away but shoot him looks, worry obvious on his face. Hermione and Ron had gotten closer over the summer and were currently talking together but Hermione did ask how he was feeling while Ron would poke at him about using his fireplace to call their house.
The smile came back onto Terry's face soon, though. "But hey! If this person really is messing with you, we'll show him that he never messes with us Ravenclaws! That's what friends are for!"
"Because,
"We're taking the egg to Ron's brother, Charlie, we have to take the egg to the Astronomy tower and give it to Charlie." Hermione answered him, Draco cringed at the mention of the tower, terrible memories had taken place there, and the simple thought of going there made him sick.
at the Headmaster; because this was not Draco's fault! It was that 'Tom's' fault.
Harry was now the only one who wasn't in a stall. He looked in the mirror and cringed.
Draco nodded and made to leave.
"Harry, those muggles seem right awful, I was wondering, what exactly are they like?" Draco kept his tone gentle, not wanting to scare Harry off or something, he knew how sensitive he was.
"Of course, Draco." And he left, Draco silently thought to himself that something was most definitely off with him, but as long as it didn't kill him or effect Draco, he didn't care. He looked back at Harry, who was looking at the place that Lucius had been standing in suspicion.
Dumbeldore had come to his own conclusion, a completely wrong one, then what?
Just a little note; these chapters are not Beta'd. I've started correcting them, but that'll take a while, so sorry.
"I can go with him." He volunteered and all eyes turned towards him, Harry beamed and nodded.
Albus didn't have an answer to it, it was something that confused him as well, he couldn't understand how Harry and Draco had ever been foes, he had heard of the meeting in Madame Malkins, but you couldn't call someone your foe from that, even if he had insulted Ron.
************
You'll all be pretty surprised by it, that I'm sure of.
"I didn't know that," Draco addressed Harry.
The Ravenclaws around him shot him grateful or proud looks.
to ask his parents. And then if they say no you could just elope together or something."
"What is going on here?" The strict voice of Professor Snape entered.
"Yes, hello, Mister Malfoy." Dumbledore was smiling at him, and Draco smiled back.
"Go get the letter that contains Draco's grades," Narcissa spoke, and the elf disappeared.
"Yeah, and he apologized for that, I accepted his apology for Madame Malkins, you need to get over it."
"But Professor, he's lying!-"
"It's a snowy owl, you buffoon!" Draco screamed right before he closed the door.
'Tom.'
"Oh no! The invisibility booster must be faulty!" Ron cried, and Draco retorted,
"Congratulations, Harry." Hermione smiled.
'A new path shall be set for the equal, the prophesied shall meet a prodigy, born as the sixth month flourishes, two friends, once foes, shall carry the power to vanquish the one who has tainted their lives, one carries the power other's shall never know, nor shall they ever understand. So mote it be.'
The older Draco was smiling, a real smile, not a smirk, not a fake smile, but one born of real happiness. His hair was long, like his father's, but more
"Sure?" He tilted his head and raised an eyebrow.
That was when Draco had realized how much he craved knowledge, how desprately he wanted to learn and understand, to prove himself. That was how he had found that book, that book that was in the library for some unknown reason, the book that had saved him, the book that had provided him with the knowledge on how to travel back in time.
"How come everyone always takes your side?" Ron whined, still looking shaken by the Howler.
"Looks like I'm a child prodigy."
"No, I wouldn't."
"Are you sure you're all okay?" He asked for what felt like the millionth time. Luna only gave him a quick nod before going back to her lesson, waving her wand, trying to turn the mouse into a book.
Hermione gasped again as Draco fell to the floor. She had followed him to his room when he had run away from Harry and Ron; thank Merlin for the invisibility cloak. Draco didn't stay on the floor for long. He slowly got off the floor and walked to the door.
It was over. And he didn't need to think about it anymore.
He thrust the fang right into the diary, black goo spurting out of it. He heard a yell and looked up to see Tom screaming in agony as bright yellow light burst out of him. The light originally burst out of where Harry had hit the diary, but then, it spread.
"I may have... blownupmyaunt," Harry rushed out.
his favorite student, he was so eager to learn, more eager than any of the other Ravenclaws, and applied himself in all subjects, he was a generalist, not a specialist, and he respected that.
"Tell me, which of you will be dying this year?" she asked, pinching the bridge of her nose.
Draco hadn't known that, his Allure had only shown itself in his sixth year, and that had been quite an... experience. Many people had tried, but Draco had managed to get away, he didn't know that people were able to fight it, perverts.
advanced." Snape spoke.
He shouldn't visit Harry in the Hospital Wing.
Ron wasn't able to dodge the lamp.
He landed right on some rock. It hurt but he would be okay-
"Yeh didn't hear? Classes er canceled. I'm the only teacher to be fired on thr firs' day!" Hagrid blubbered, getting more and more worked up. Looking around, it was true that there was no one else around. How had he not noticed that? Apparently, Terry and Anthony were more distracting than he had given them credit for. They should be spies...
"Dumbledore has told me that you've been presenting as a Male Veela." He didn't even try to keep the excitement out of his voice.
And it was slightly entertaining watching them fumble around, asking people in the hallway if they knew where the classroom was. They had passed it on several occasions. Draco wouldn't let them be late of course, but he was definitely calling it close.
*********************
What was he doing here?
*****************
"I don't know. Why would a Grim be in a muggle neighborhood?" he said, trying his best to make himself believe it as well. Hermione shot him an appraising look, their previous argument forgotten.
(well, maybe just a little bit).
"What would your father matter?"
"Why didn't you do anything about the whole, Nicolas Flamel thing?" Hagrid started,
He had a headache, most likely from the concussion, he should
"It would be better, if you took a seat, Mr. Malfoy." Snape suggested.
to be, as opposed to the Wizards normal. Harry looked at him in confusion and fear, he didn't understand, and frankly, Draco didn't understand either.
**********************
"Bought 'em off a fellow at the three broomsticks." Hagrid spoke in his accent.
He reached out to take it from him but Ron threw the book towards Harry. It landed right in front of him. Harry glanced at the basilisk. Something Hermione had said flashed back into his head.
This was getting ridiculous, he had recieved multiple owls from multiple teachers requesting for him to be in private tutoring with all of them, the only one that wasn't harrasing him was Quirell, and thank the heavens for that, he didn't' know what he would do if bloody Quirell came up to him and wanted to teach him privately.
Harry's head snapped up and he looked distinctly green. "No! No, of course not!" He yelled, probably louder than necessary.
?" He spat the word. It left a vile taste on his tongue. The simple thought of those creatures never failed to make him ill.
"I don't know! I don't know what's wrong with me!" Draco stood up and screamed.
Potter beamed, "Awesome, thanks, Draco." He tested the name for a bit and then decided that he liked it.
"Of course he doesn't! Do you see how wiggle waggle we are right now!" Draco yelled; it seemed like he was always yelling at Weasley and Harry, Merlin, he wished Hermione was here, at least then it would be a balanced amount of stupidity.
"Is Harry Potter in danger?" Dobby resisted.
"But, Hermione..." Ron spoke up from where he was standing at the end of the hall.
"Yes, sir."
"Where're you going?" Terry yelled when he noticed Draco leaving, more confused than angry. It looked like he was cooling down.
Minerva transfigured a chair into a makeshift bed, just big enough for Mr. Malfoy. Poppy levitated the boy onto the mattress and started to treat him, first insepcting what was wrong, it was clear, magical exhaustion, she got out all the materials she needed to treat him, she didn't need to think about what she needed to do, she already knew, she was in her element.
Draco would be lying if he said that didn't make him feel warm. It seemed this person was actually doing their research and not just starting off with a red rose like a moron would. It wouldn't hurt to see where this went, would it?
"I had a vision." She provided as explanation.
Hermione ushered Harry and Ron out of the tower.
and Draco found himself feeling sympathy for him. Normally, he would be laughing at his misery, normally it
"No, there isn't, but this change...you've been sorted into
They entered the castle, it was weird seeing it so empty. They were so close to the great hall when they were stopped by the squib, "Oh dear, we are in trouble."
"Um, I read the textbooks... sometimes." He scratched the back of his neck.
The basilisk sprung forward again and Harry jumped, falling towards the water. The basilisk hit the statue face first, disorienting it for a moment. Harry got onto the floor once again and got ready.
Nearing the end of the hall, Harry froze as he saw someone lying on the floor.
"Thank, Hermione." He nodded. Then he looked over at Ron and Harry who were still on their arse's, did they need someone to tell them to get up, or did they just want to fall asleep here because Draco had absolutely no objections to that idea, let it be a lesson for making him bust a lung while trying to lullaby a three-headed monster to sleep.
"It was Malfoy! He called her a..." Ron trailed off, looking around, then he looked back at Hagrid and lowered his voice to a whisper.
Then Draco's mind registered what he said.
"Oh." Potter said again, with a different look in his eyes this time, was it pity this time? Draco scowled at that, he didn't like having anyone's pity.
he heard Hermione whine in the background, but his eyes were already half-closed.
"The most difficult of all magical arts." Hermione scoffed at that. Trelawney - who had obviously expected that - said nothing in response, even though she obviously heard it. Hermione's face flushed; it was clear she hadn't meant to say anything out loud.
"Did you hear that-"
“They say it'll take elven months; a month at most.”
Draco was in the great hall, everyone else had left and he was trying to get to his dorm, classes were over for the day and tomorrow he had tutoring with Flitwick, he wanted to study.
"I know." Draco wished he had a, it would be the right time to stroke it, like Dumbledore.
"His parents? I have to ask
"Surely you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy muggle father’s name." He spat out in disgust.
"Make sure you come to me every time you need it, sans you go to a discount potions shop that has absolutely no idea what they're doing."
Since Nott had taken Draco's place for this fixed point, the next one that involved Malfoy and Potter would be replaced with Nott and Potter, Nott would become this timeline's Malfoy, but that meant that Nott would also take the dark mark during his sixth year.
"Snape?" Draco said in a small voice, Severus was going to steal something this year, no, it couldn't be, he wouldn't, Harry must have gotten something wrong.
Harry shot him a beaming smile and Draco's heart did a little stutter (he would have to look into that later). He opened his mouth to say something but was cut off when the door suddenly slammed open and someone came in hollering.
"My favorite student!" Flitwick squeaked, making sure no one overheard him, he didn't want to hurt any other Ravenclaw's feelings, but he couldn't help it, Mr. Malfoy
"It--" Harry was suddenly cut off as the doors swung open.
I got my first fan art! If I upload this on Wattpad, I'm
****************
"I don't know, he fainted after something hit him in the head, Snape gave us these potions to give him." Ron showed Hermione the potions.
Draco desperately tried to get out of this death machine the Weasley family called a car, Weasley had broken his wand when they landed in the whomping willow, a final touch to Draco's misery.
"It's just...you think he's okay?" Anthony asked again as they waited in the hallway right outside of Transfiguration.
*************************
"We're not idiots, Hagrid." Draco told him calmly, they couldn't avoid his question now, they would have to answer.
I am sorry for not updating recently, I've kinda been down these past couple days and have been reading up on a few Drarry fics, guess who just found a 3 million words slow burn canon rewrite?
Hermione sat down hugging her book.
Harry looked over to see a tall boy with curly dark brown hair standing in the shadows. He was wearing Slytherin robes and was holding Draco's wand. He didn't have to think, he knew who this was.
When he couldn't understand how he had stopped the glass from hitting the floor and his parents were looking at him in horror...
"Well, it's your time to shine, Mister youngest seeker in a century." Draco gestured to the broom. Harry turned scarlet in embarrassment, looking at the broom and then looking at the keys,
"Yes?" He turned.
Draco's eyes widened and he gave Severus a questioning look.
, they needed to keep going forward. That was also a part of Divination: looking past what others told you to see, and deciding for yourself what was real and what you could really
"They got in on pure talent!" Hermione continued, and Draco cut her off, trying, desperately trying to stop his words,
"I want you to smuggle Harry out of the castle for the trip to Hogsmeade," Draco repeated himself, looking far too pleased for someone having a psychotic break.
. Potter, that bastard had this cloak since first year,  that was how he had never gotten in trouble.
Ron reluctantly nodded.
"So is his mother?--" Harry started but was cut off.
"Yes, there is indeed a boggart in this closet. But can anyone tell me what a boggart does?"
He didn't know if he had hurt the basilisk, but he knew that it was still chasing him. He didn't know what to do, he only knew a handful of spells!
"Here it is." Draco put the huge book on his bed, he had taken it out of the library to study Seer's, Nicolas was a great man, he had done research on almost everything, and Seers was one of them, and he did want to study up on Veela's just a bit.
. He knew that didn't make sense, but it did to him. He couldn't make sense of
"No! I didn't!" Hermione smacked Seamus on the back of his head and started scolding him.
"You are avoiding me." Snape was referring to his eyes. That caught Dumbledore and McGonagalls attention.
"Yeah, you know, the attack on Mrs Norris!" Luna said in her airy voice, and Draco's face drained of colour. There had been an attack on Mrs Norris
Harry whispered again. This time, the snake obeyed and turned away from the Hufflepuff completely. Snape chose this moment to act and vanished the snake.
"Mudblood."
"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearing, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future."  Professor Trelawney kept on going as her eyes leapt from face to face. Finally landing on Draco, she gave him a smile.
"Have you seen Hermione?" Ron said at the same time as Harry asked, "Have you seen Draco?"
"I'm sorry! But have you seen it?" Draco asked once again.
Dumbledore and company stood there, shocked and every other emotion. This boy was a
lucky that Draco was here, but he was still tempted to let them die, he could blame it on the dog.
"Am I in the Gryffindor common room?" Draco looked at them and they nodded.
Anthony ushered Harry out of the castle while Luna distracted Hagrid. Originally, they hadn't even planned to distract Hagrid, but apparently the giant had obtained a new creature he had to take care of. Which, of course, put him right in the way of their escape route. Anthony adored the professor but he wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. However, Luna had insisted on talking to him to keep all of their bases covered.
"Mate!" Ron called out again.
"Male Veela's are not uncommon, Mr. Malfoy, especially in families as old as your's." The others nodded along with her.
Ron said something to Draco, but he couldn't hear him, "What?" He yelled, trying to hear him with the earmuffs on as well as that stupid noise in the background.
The young Malfoy visibly relaxed, his shoulders slumped down and he let out a breath. Everyone's jaw dropped, they were all confused, a Malfoy in Ravenclaw? The older Ravenclaw's didn't even clap, except for the muggleborns.
"Draco!" Hermione yelled as she ran up to him. Draco only had enough time to take a single step back before a body collided into him. He suddenly found himself being crushed into a hug.
"Here you go." Flitwick dropped a bundle of books in his arms, he had requested a few from the man, and it looked like he delivered, many of the books were about Veela and Seers, and just a few were for his own pleasure reading.
"Be quiet, Ms Granger," Snape said once again.
And it was working.
So no, Terry didn't want to risk getting expelled.
"Well...
"Hermione, yer gonna need to tell me what happened." Hagrid pleaded with her once more. When Ron and Harry came in he turned to them in hope,
"Yes, that is why we're here, Severus, we don't believe that the punishment should be too severe, Minerva has already agreed to put them in detention for one week as well as take away 50 house points." Dumbledore smiled.
"You have just come from Divination, yes?" she asked a good handful of the class. The answering murmurs were all mixtures of,
A crack sounded in the air and Dobby appeared next to them, "Dobby has brought the rooster!" he declared proudly, bolstering a rather angry chicken around.
They looked at each other, Hermione said what everyone was thinking, "That was strange."
bad!"
"You zoned out on me," Ron said.
She turned her attention to Harry once more, "You look in perfect health to me. Excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in."
They were going to come up with a plan to get their friend back.
"I have to say, what you did in class today was absolutely extraordinary, Mr. Malfoy." Flitwick said as Draco sat down.
He used his wit to answer people, he was good at manipulating people, sure, that could be a bad trait, but he didn't abuse it, and that was what mattered, intent, not opportunity.
"You should go, your friends will find you in 5 minutes." She said, starting to walk away.
Fuck.
"This complicates things a bit." Weasley swallowed.
"Sure, Harry." He hesitated, the name felt weird, how could a name feel weird?
That last question was a bit odd, but Draco found himself not caring,
The flood of relief that overwhelmed him when Draco opened his eyes was like nothing he had ever felt before, even though the pain from the bite was rapidly spreading, it seemed dull in comparison to the happiness he was feeling right now.
Ron facepalmed, "Why did I get stuck with the lovestruck puppy?" he muttered miserably.
"That's it," Draco said under his breath. He looked over at the Golden Trio; they hadn't noticed and his epiphany they didn't seem to be paying attention to him.
But who would be courting him? He hadn't noticed anyone... but he hadn't really paid attention much, had he. Too caught up in his work to even think about things like love.
Everyone turned to face Draco at the last segment, Nott was outright laughing.
"What do you mean you can't tell me?" Hermione held his wrists, she had clearly been thinking about this for the whole time he was gone. Harry and Weasley nodded, Hermione must have educated them about how advanced the spell really was, and now they needed to know too.
"I think that the Allure will present during your fourth year, you will need to be careful then." The smile momentarily disappeared from Flitwicks face and his eyes darkened, Draco didn't interrupt but he knew what he was going to say.
He didn't like the feeling.
Harry was a natural though, he dodged the Bludger (just barely.)
**********
"Mate, you should've seen Harry when you didn't wake up when the rest of us did, he burst into tears right there." Ron laughed. Draco looked over to see Harry was imitating a fish, while his cheeks had coloured.
Perhaps she should have eased it onto her, Poppy's jaw dropped to the floor this time, and she wansn't closing it, she was truly and utterly shocked, Minerva couldn't blame her, she felt quite the same way.
Harry pretended to think for a moment. "Nope." He shrugged. "Eating breakfast is always a death sentence, especially those... oranges." He shuddered.
"Draco." He wanted him to look him in the eyes, he wouldn't, he would never let anyone invade his mind again.
"What was written on the wall, Minerva?" Snape asked in his same nasally voice.
He flipped through the book and got to the page that focused on Nicolas Flamel, before he could say anything, Hermione had already found it.
They didn't pay him much mind after he aplogized, and mere minutes after he had yelled it out, the word was forgotten. Draco looked back at the book, at the page that had made him so excited, he had figured it out, he had learned why he was having trouble with his visions.
"Yeah, you're right."
"Good, you are not seriously injured." Draco chucked, the man had a fondness for him that Draco returned.
before. Hermione was still looking at him with suspicion, Harry and Weasley looked confused, they didn't know how advanced the spell was, there was no way a normal first year would be able to perform one.
"You can be part Veela?" He asked. He knew about Veela but he didn't know that much. They just hadn't seemed that important. And unlike Hermione, he didn't research magical creatures for fun. Sure, he was interested in them but not overly so. Just another creature to file away into the 'That exists?' department of his brain.
Draco screamed, Ron screamed, Harry screamed, everybody screamed. Ron spun the wheel the other way and they tumbled out of the train's path, spinning and twisting all the way down.
"Hermione." He nodded at her, and she smiled at him.
No, he wouldn't think of Hermione.
Lucius very slightly flinched but otherwise showed no sign of surprise.
Ingredients?-
Harry felt himself filling with dread as he saw the group of people in the library. He pushed through the crowd, Ron behind him. All the teachers, as well as the Headmaster, were standing at the front of the crowd.
It reminded him of when he was a child. He couldn't understand why his parents looked at him oddly. He tried to imitate the other children but everything he did resulted in another act of cruelty. Things that he was just unprepared for. Maybe that was how he had gotten into Ravenclaw. He had always strived for the knowledge to know his parents would react. He would have plans set in place every time he did anything, making sure he could de-escalate any solution if he needed to.
Harry couldn't believe this was happening, Draco had fallen asleep on him, and it looked like he was out cold, he glared at the Weasley's, but all he got in return was laughter.
"She's just...nice once you get to know her." The anger started draining out of him, quickly being replaced with exhaustion. The whole day had tired him out and that little vision hadn't done much to dispel it. It was odd, his head hadn't been pounding like it normally did when he had a headache. It was more like an itch he couldn't scratch because it was in his
"Why? If Harry's talking to Draco, we could talk to him as well. Maybe he's calmed down," she reasoned.
"Your next class is Defence right?" Anthony asked quietly. Unlike the other tables, Ravenclaw was always somewhat subdued. And that was how everyone in the House liked it. Sure, there was chattering here and there, but there was always a good chunk of people who wanted nothing to do with conversation and only wanted to pay attention to their homework or something of the sort.
*********************
It was hazy, but Draco definitely remembered Severus being there at the meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall. Severus should have known he was a Veela. The thought had slipped his mind, what with everything else going on, but when he actually had time to think about it... it was wrong. Severus wouldn't forget something like that. It just wasn't in his character. You could make an offhanded comment about his hair ten years ago and he would still remember what you said the next time you 'had the audacity to show your face'.
"The boggart turns into one's worst fear, Sir. But they can only handle one person at a time."
"Yes, sir, I most certainly will, but I was wondering if you could teach me how to do more non-verbal spells." The smile was back on Flitwick's face, and before he knew it, he was learning all sorts of spells.
"Yes, he could do better, but look at this letter his Charms Professor sent, Draco has been getting private tutoring lessons from him." Narcissa handed her husband another letter.
He cringed when he thought about how he had treated her before, the old him really was a prat.
He didn't have to be close to see it: Lockhart had fucked up in some way. From where he was sitting, he couldn't get a good look at it, but something was wrong with Harry's arm.
Terry cocked an eyebrow. "Not the most elaborate plan."
"Common room!" came the short reply.
"Ravenclaw!" The hat roared.
Harry looked back in fear and doubled his efforts to put everything into the back.
"We're not in public, you may drop the pleasantries," he dismissed with a flick of his free hand. The other carefully stirred the potion three times.
But he didn't have time to think about that, right now he was more worried about how he would deal with Hermione, she was one of the only ones in their trio that understood how powerfull of a spell the one that he cast was, for a first year.
"But you would never treat him like that." Harry said and Hermione agreed. Draco would never treat anyone horribly. Unless they had done something to him first; then he could be vicious.
"Draco! I'm fine." Harry looked like a tomato and Draco was even more worried, was Harry sick?
Draco- or whoever it was- neared close to her. He peered at her with disgust.
"Hermione?" Ron said again, this time sadder and laced with fear.
_________________________________
"The nargles can steal their shoes." Luna smiled with a hint of mischief in her eyes.
Draco was touched, really, he was. Granger had gotten a detention defending him. Originally he had become friends with her because it would bring him closer to the golden trio, but the more he got to know her, the more she actually grew on him, she wasn't a know-it-all like everyone thought her to be, she was a really sweet and bright girl.
She slapped him on the arm, but at least she wasn't freaking out about the detention anymore, best not to mention that word in front of her anymore though.
Harry let out a squeak, one absolutely undignified of the Saviour of the Wizarding world.
"Draco's our friend and he's entitled to his own secrets. Just like you've been keeping from us." Maybe Anthony shouldn't have said that last part. Terry's face paled a little too quickly. He was sure he had read somewhere in a book that that wasn't good for you.
"That's horrible Harry, but for what it's worth, I don't think you're a freak." Draco slowly wrapped Harry in a hug, he didn't hug people often, let alone hugging Potter, but he felt like he needed one right now, and Draco wasn't
Draco was sitting at his table, talking to the new girl, Luna Lovegood, as well as Anthony Goldenstein, they both made lovely talk, Draco was interested in Lovegood's theories, the others didn't love her because they thought her abnormal, but Draco didn't see anything wrong with being a tad bit different, even though the old Draco had made fun of her, he wouldn't do that this time though.
"What happened to chocolate?"
Sir Nicholas' birthday was today? Today was the Halloween feast as well, it would be better to be there for when Quirell would burst in, but what was the point right now? Hermione was safe, as long as Weasley hadn't said anything stupid, Draco had saw him and Hermione together but hadn't thought much of it.
"Thank you, Sir."
"Dobby!" The elf did not come back.
"Come on, let's get the rest of our books." Draco started to say when he heard a very familiar drawl, and froze.
Harry stood there, shocked. Something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.
The sink shifted, it responded. Once the sink was out of the way, you could see a long passage going almost straight down into what felt and looked like nothing; like a slide. You couldn't see the bottom of it, it was pitch black. All except for the faint drop of water echoing around the space. The slide itself looked smooth, a stark contrast to the jagged rocks that lined the walls of the slide.
"You're a seer."
"What did
"That must be where Malf- Draco is." Ron corrected himself. Harry gave him a quick smile.
A few people thought it was useless, he was a Malfoy, he would, of course, be in Slytherin, like so many before him.
"Well, that's settled then," Draco said, getting up.
" Ron put emphasis on his last name, and Draco flinched.
It paid off having been a Slytherin once upon a time.
What?
Hermione couldn't believe Draco had fallen asleep. They were supposed to be
"And I'm George!" Another one chimed in, they both started snickering, that would be hell, figuring out their names.
"I believe that you are turning into a Veela." McGonagall spoke.
"That is no way to speak to your elders, child," Lucius berated.
A new prophesy, a new prophesy that he had predicted, wow, he stepped up a ladder on the seer scale.
" He trailed off and looked in her direction, seeming amused. That was when she noticed that his eyes had a red tinge to them.
Draco sat in his room, talking to Tom, no one else was in the dorm, so he didn't need to worry about anyone hearing him, Tom didn't like it when people interrupted them, and Draco didn't like it either
"Luna's amazing, isn't she?" Anthony whispered dreamily next to him.
He had forgotten about that man too. He didn't know much about Sirius Black, only that he was a relative of sorts and wasn't guilty. His father had said multiple times that Sirius Black was definitely not a death eater.
Just to think, yesterday, he was a 22 year old man, standing over Severus Snape's dead body, he had fought well, but everyone who fought against him died eventually, and it was Severus' time. He still didn't understand why the
*************
"But I can give you somewhere to go just in case," Anthony said.
He shook his head, he didn't have time to think of such trivial things, he had to focus on the task at hand.
"That's because I have it."
Draco looked down at the gift that he had put in his bag and then he looked back at his father.
"Well, at least no one on the Gryffindor team bought their way in!" Hermione seemed proud of her insult, and for some reason, Draco was enveloped in rage at that, he wanted to fight back, but he couldn't, it was as if his words were not his own, and he regretted them as soon as they came out of his mouth.
"Sir! I was just helping Malfoy get back to his dorm, um, he got lost." Davies mumbled, the confident persona was gone.
"Books can take you only so far in this field," Trelawney said, practically reading his mind. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry and Ron give Hermione cheeky grins. Hermione wore a shocked look on her face. Draco barely refrained from laughing, he could practically hear her gasping in her mind.
"What happened?" Anthony asked from the side.
Draco didn't know what to say, he started stuttering, he had never
"Goodmorning, dearies." A woman greeted them while serving them with breakfast.
Ron huffed but shut up nonetheless.
"Sure, it's down the hall, you can go to the
"Draco!" Hagrid called out. The giant slowly came into view. But instead of the normal cheery grin he wore, he looked dejected. By the looks of the redness around his eyes, he had been crying. Draco didn't know the half-giant that well, but Harry must have been rubbing off on him, because he felt inexplicably worried about him.
"Yes, I am sorry about that, but I figured it would be better to talk to you when half the school wasn't laughing at you, wouldn't look good for either of us if we were found talking with each other."
"Figure something else out, until then, you will not yell at him, we will find a solution." Narcissa's words held a tone of finality, this conversation was over and Draco was excused, he should leave.
"I will ask you one last time Draco. Is this Hermione Granger a
"Hermione, Harry's probably talking to Draco, right?" Ron said once they were out of the Headmaster's office.
"Yes, like Draco," Anthony agreed as they both walked along the old abandoned tunnel. It should spit them out at the back of the castle and then all they needed to do was use the Portkey Draco had gotten for them. If everything went according to plan Harry would have an hour or two of freedom.
Hermione finally let go of him and Harry walked up to him, a bright smile on his face and a look of utter adoration in his eyes. The simple look made his cheeks heat up. No one had ever looked at him like that. Like he was the most precious thing in the world.
he was feeling the way he did. The main emotion that he felt these days was anger... and sometimes sadness, but that wasn't new to him.
Hermione interrupted him, "Draco, I know that you're close with Snape, but he's not who you think he is, I didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew that it would hurt your feelings, but you have to believe us."
"We should probably get back to our dorms." Potter looked like he wanted to say something, he opened his mouth and closed it repeatedly, looking like a fish, that made Draco think of a fish with Potter's face, making him smile, it was a bit childish, yes, but Draco didn't care, it was nice to laugh at such small things.
"Draco? Are you alright?" Harry asked, worried.
"How many things did he break?" Draco mumbled, still not looking Severus in the eyes.
*******************
Not to say Hermione couldn't be jealous as well. Case in point, relationship with Lavender Brown. Sixth year had been a mess of feelings for those two, hadn't it? Not to say it hadn't been for Draco as well.
Harry looked furious, more furious than usual. And his face was flushed red. You could even call it Weasley red if you pushed it a bit.
"Why won't you die?!" He yelled in frustration, raising his wand but stopped when he noticed what was in Ron's hands.
"What are you talking about?" Terry asked in a rush.
Ron waited for a moment before gagging as well. "Oh," he moaned, and ran into another stall, shutting the door as well.
"Tom," Harry spat out.
"A Portkey is an object that can take you to a specified location. They're either activated by touch or vocal commands. If you wish to go back to where you came from, you just touch or say the command again," Draco elaborated.
But he really was...
He could see changes in himself already, his eyes had become more blue, like the sky on a sunny day, his hair had become more white and fine, and when he raked his hand through it, it felt like he was touching a cloud, his skin had become softer, like silk, and his teeth had become as white as paper.
Suddenly, ablack dog ran out from the tree and lunged towards the wolf. But Draco's attention latched onto the rat that was scurrying away from the scene. He didn't know why he felt it was so important, but he couldn't look away from it. The blur that was his future self also seemed to notice him.
"And Draco?"
"It's just really obscure," Draco murmured absentmindedly.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't want to ask in front of everyone else," he mumbled under his breath, eyes getting a distant look in them.
"The boy is allowed to have his secrets Severus, and perhaps he didn't know he was a seer, it is not a gift he would have realized unless he had taken divination, which is not available until his third year."
Wow, almost 3000 words.
Well, he had to admit the flower looked lovely. It didn't show any sign of wilting and smelled amazing.
"Mr Malfoy, I am pleased to say that your son has become one of my favourite students in all of my year in teaching, he is exceptionally skilled and I am sure that one day he will make an extraordinary wizard. His friendship with Hermione Granger is also helping Miss Granger's grades in my class, they made a terrific duo, Headmaster Dumbledore shares my expectations for them."
"Lucius doesn't know, he would done much more already if he already knew." They all knew what Lucius Malfoy would do if his own son was a seer, it was fortunate that he didn't know, otherwise they would have much more trouble.
"And where did you learn these spells?" Dumbledore asked.
But when the eye did finally adjust to the change, it would go haywire, months of data, months of vision's, even the tiniest ones were unable to get through, to show the Wizard or Witch what they were meant to know. The eye would go into overdrive, mashing up all the data and pushing it out at once, it took a lot of magical energy out of the Seer.
A sob ripped its way out of his throat, he was
"There's just one problem." Hermione interrupted, looking slightly put off. Harry's stomach did a little flop.
, Potter." He helped Harry get up.
"I just had to ask Luna for her hair and she gave it to me," Hermione shrugged when Ron asked. Conveniently, Anthony and Terry gave each other hair-cuts, so finding their hair wasn't exactly a chore.
Lucius was distracted momentarily, "Grades?" He asked, Draco was also interested, he hadn't bothered looking at them this year, schoolwork wasn't exactly at the top of his mind.
"Speaking of, how did you even get him to do it?" He asked.
helped him escape his parents ire.
He sighed and sat down at her side.
Minerva opened her mouth, but was cut off when Poppy burst into the office.
feel the need to run away from home again, you're coming to my house immediately," he said. Harry's eyes widened. Whatever he had been expecting, it hadn't been that.
There were still so many things to do, so, so many. If he really was in the past, then he could change so much, he could prevent so many people from dying, and making some others death's speed up, wormtail would need to be disposed of as soon as possible.
"Lovey Doveys? Where are all of you?" Luna looked close to tears. Draco looked over at Anthony but he looked just as stumped as him. Were all of Luna's creatures gone? Was that her biggest fear? Draco had never doubted the existence of the creatures, but he’d never expected them disappearing to be Luna's biggest fear.
For some reason she blamed Draco for her detention, as if it was his fault that she decided to be a good friend, but forget about that, he had to tell her that Weasley and Potter were actually planning to try and make up with him, she would either be happy for him or start telling him about how much of a trash human being Weasley was.
Here's a little note from my beta that made me chuckle :)
Hermione yelled again. Streaks of fire came out of her wand and hit the Diary. The fire stayed there for a good thirty seconds before disappearing. She inspected it, looking for the slightest blemish, but nothing. The Diary was perfectly fine.
"There are a lot of Wrackspurts around you, Draco. But don't worry! We can fix that!" Luna smiled, and that was how he found himself laughing for the first time in quite a while.
"You know that something's wrong?" Draco looked at him.
towards him. He didn't want to kill Harry; oh no, he wanted to humiliate him, make him feel alone.
"Oh, you seem to have it all wrong, Potter. Killing mudbloods is of no use to me now. For many months now, my target has been you." He pointed Draco's wand at Harry and another surge of anger overwhelmed him.
"Well, it's not like the Dursleys are going to be signing it any time soon. The bloody bastards." Harry's voice was muffled from where he had collapsed on the couch.
The words were out of Draco's mouth before he even had time to process them, "Are you okay?" He grabbed Harry by the shoulders and looked at him, as if looking for wounds, even though he knew that there would be none, because this probably happened weeks ago, there would be no wounds, so why was he still looking.
Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley stood on Platform 9 ¾. Harry was looking at them, hope in his eyes.
"Then you wouldn't understand," Anthony deadpanned.
But then, Harry closed his mouth, looked at Draco and hugged him, tightly.
"Professor Flitwick," Draco said, his mood suddenly elevated.
"Yes, Professor." He hadn't meant for this to happen. How could he have known his fear would have been something so graphic.
"Yeah." Harry huffed, looking put off for some reason as he kicked a pebble that had been on the ground.
"Of course they do. No one cares about Zonko's anymore, they're all using the Weasley products." He could only imagine the look on his father's face when he learned that not only had he been pranked, he had been pranked with a
Hermione cried out in frustration. Ron sighed again; he hadn't done much of anything. It was quite weird seeing Ron reading a book
"He feels guilty?" He asked, a doubtful look on his face. It spoke volumes of Lucius' character that a twelve-year-old boy who had only met him twice could see through his mask.
"Don't be a smartarse with me Draco," Lucius told him, and Draco didn't know what to say, what did Lucius want him to say, that he was sorry for being himself?
I'm sorry I haven't been here for a bit but I actually have an excuse this time! My computer broke. Haha, good thing I already had a bit of this chapter written, huh?
Dumbledore spoke as he sat down at his desk, the old wizard looked over at the teachers that were standing on either side of them, they had a hidden conversation with their eyes, and Dumbledore's expression sombered up.
They neared the house and Draco's jaw dropped open at the sight of Harry's window covered in bars.
"Is that supposed to be an insult?" He snorted.
The thought sprung to his mind, the elf had been acting strangely lately, Draco had been watching him. He disappeared for hours at a time and even went as far as to not answer some of their calls. That was the only thing that he could think of, it was worth a try.
"Oh, Malfoy?" Finnigan questioned before looking between the two of them and Harry's panicked expression. His expression changed into one of mockery as he shot Harry a look Draco couldn't decipher.
Potter closed his mouth and swallowed, Weasley still looked confused though.
"You don't know anything, Goldenstein," Terry said, yanking his hand away. His face was completely closed off, which was a tell in itself. His posture was rigged. Overall, he looked completely different from the calm and confident Terry Anthony knew.
" He hissed out the word, his face sneering in disgust as if saying the word brought him physical pain.
"Yes, it is blank. It is a diary, even the most extraordinary of wizards need to write their thoughts sometimes." Lucius smiled,
The effect of the chocolate was instant. The cold inside him dimmed a bit and was replaced by a warm and happy feeling. The sweet was a welcome taste, he had always loved chocolate as a child. Sometimes, he even helped the house-elves make it (much to his father's horror.) He breathed a sigh of relief, the tension falling out of his body. It was then that he suddenly became aware of the wetness on his cheeks. Had he been crying?
"He will not turn into him!" Severus hissed.
"How do you know?" Weasley asked.
"Draco, mate, dear friend of mine..." Terry started, "Why exactly do you want us to break a rule that would almost surely get us expelled?"
"You were seen by no less than seven Muggles!" Professor Snape lectured them while Draco was still leaning against Harry for support.
Draco ran into the common room. There were a few people in there, one of which was Seamus Finnigan.
"Oh, right here-" Harry held up his trunk and Draco lunged for it,
He should ask Tom.
"Oh, did she send you to get some of the ingredients in her room?"
"Mr. Malfoy, could you stay after class, please?" Again?
killed the guy.
Potter, Granger and Weasley were idiots.
It was no secret that CPS was awful in their town. The police cared more about drug busts and other things than the lives of a few kids. So it was always up to them to help each other. And they did. Anthony had used that house for this same purpose a few times before. But it had never been this intimate. The people in the neighborhood had just known the house as a small safe space. Adults weren't allowed to go in without permission from his parents (who were in on it too.) And police weren't allowed in if there was an adult inside. It was why they always kept a nanny there. Someone who would just check in to make sure there were no new arrivals.
He didn't know how, but he got up. His legs felt like jelly. He couldn't control them, but he knew that he was closing the door and putting a locking charm on it. The panic was starting to decrease, the hands around his neck not as tight now, but breathing was still a problem.
Hermione put her had on her mouth, she clearly felt guilty, she had promised him that she would never ask him about his father when she noticed how it made him feel. It hurt him to see her feel guilty for something that wasn't her fault, but this was the only way he could keep his secret, he would tell her when she was older, when she could understand it.
He had asked Hermione, hoping for answers, but she had just laughed and patted him on the back, giving him a look. Harry was never good at figuring out what Hermione's looks meant. Harry remembered the shows that he had seen when he had peaked a look at the telly, stories of a woman and a man falling in love, maybe it was the same with them-
"Terry! Where is this coming from?" Anthony grabbed onto Terry's arm.
"Better stand back," Ron warned, and Harry backed up to the corner of his room.
He stopped and looked back at Harry whose face was suddenly serious.
"I'm sure Professor Flitwick has already offered to tutor you."
"Now now, I believe we should leave Draco alone. The boy deserves to rest after all he's went through." Dumbledore raised his hands and pointed towards the exit. Flitwick and Dumbledore left while Harry and Lucius stayed behind.
The man really was passionate about charms, he was passionate about magic itself, and that was what made him a great teacher and head of house.
"Mister Malfoy!" He ran up to him, inspecting him, and then, he let out a sigh of relief.
He turned back to Draco, "You are excused, we will call you if we have other questions." Draco nodded and left the corridor, probably going back to his dorm.
(See the end of the chapter for
He could hear the chatter of the students, but they sounded far away and warped. He was worried. He didn't think he'd ever been this worried before. He was worried about Hermione, but he was
. But magic alone will not help you in a fight with a boggart. You must imagine something funny and you must imagine that your fear is turning into something that you can laugh at. Something that isn't so scary anymore, just a faded reminder of what that thing once was."
"Yeah, me too, sorry Harry. But I'm sure you and Draco could have fun in the castle." Hermione smiled comfortingly.
"Yes Professor." Harry and Ron nodded.
He dodged the basilisk just barely. It seemed to only be going for him and was ignoring Ron entirely. Ron's eyes were closed and he was running the other way. "Ron!" Harry called.
"Go ahead."
Interesting, very interesting, Potter had gotten on the team even when Draco hadn't done anything, that meant that his theory was right, fixed points. A fixed point in time, something that made the structure of that timeline, if they didn't happen, the timeline itself would fold in on itself, because of this, the universe made sure that it happened, no matter what.
Draco walked down the hallway as fast as he could without Hermione suspected anything, he still had his quill and ink, and he didn't care how weird. He opened the door to what he assumed was the bathroom, it was, and he bolted inside, closing the door immediately.
"Who's that?" he asked, trying to keep his voice steady. It wasn't easy and he was pretty sure he failed.
"Harry." Ron hissed, kneeling to Harry's side.
"Good job, Dray." Why did people insist on shortening his already 2 syllables long name? But he did blush at the compliment, not as heavily as he would from one related to his intelligence, but he did have a praise kink nonetheless.
He made his way to the boy's dormitory, the common room was empty, Ravenclaw's didn't spend much of their time in their common room, Draco actually liked that, the common room was a nice place, and having it all to himself gave him another space to think comfortably.
Draco walked to the field with Harry, Ron and Hermione, Ron and Harry were in their Quidditch uniforms while Draco and Hermione had plans to relax on the field while watching them play, Hermione didn't like flying.
, in fact, know of the diary. It seemed that was another thing Lucius had lied about.
"And you didn't even tell a teacher! What if you had died in there?! They wouldn't even be able to find your corpse, you know why? Because no one else is a
Severus cleared his throat, causing Draco to look over at him, he was mindful not to look him in the eye, it would be rather confusing to him why he couldn't break through a '11 year old's' occlumency, 11 year old Draco wasn't even remotely good at Occulemcy, even with Severus helping him.
_________________________________
"How'd yeh figure that out?" He boomed, and Hermione desperately tried to shush him.
"Well, that much is obvious!" Draco quipped, tugging at Harry's arm with all his might, the twins and Ron were helping him but the man had a good grip, Harry was like a piece of rope.
"Azkaban."
, and a voice and
Draco held his wand up to his face and walked backwards.
"Hmph." She crossed her arms, she was still mad about it.
"But we'll have class tomorrow, right?" Terry asked, a hopeful smile on his face. But there was a sad undertone to it. He knew as well as Draco that they wouldn't. And he wasn't even a Seer. Or from the future.
"Do not fill me with horrendous ideas such as that, Draco." Severus sneered.
Draco looked at Dobby and then at the letter, he wanted to be angry, but he knew that wouldn't be the right thing to do, "Dobby, why are you taking my mail?"
"What did you do to him?!" he yelled, grief turning to anger.
"Miss Lovegood, remember the incantation."
Across from Ron's stall, Hermione watched as her hair flattened out, slowly becoming blond; her eyes lightened from their normal hazel to silvery-blue-grey.
Harry Potter was walking down the hallway with his friend Ron Weasley when he heard some strange noises that came from across the hallway. He decided to investigate it, he ushered Ron to follow him.
Right now, he needed to focus on figuring out how to defeat Quirrel, something in Potter defeated him, somehow, he still didn't have all the details about that. All he knew was that Potter had killed Quirell, expelling the spirit out of his body. How he would recreate the power of something that great, he didn't know. He would have to rely on the stars to guide him from here, it had been quite some time since he had his last vision, his body must be adapting to this new magical core.
