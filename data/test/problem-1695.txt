Malfoy’s eyes lit up with relief. “He speaks. Well done, now tell me what your hand is doing so close to my face.”
“Not really, no,” he admitted, shocking himself. He blamed the potion because it picked that moment to make him notice the sharp angle of Malfoy’s jaw and the pale slope of his neck that Harry wanted to drag his lips across. He had to swallow the groan that threatened to rise up out of him.
Potter laughed and Draco was sure if he only ever heard one sound the rest of his life, he wanted it to be that laugh. “Okay, fine, but we are both stubborn and prideful, you have to admit that.”
St. Mungo’s was quiet. The Spell Damage Ward’s patients all seemed to be sleeping. When they arrived, a Healer swooped Potter away, telling Draco to wait there. It all felt like it happened in slow motion. Draco felt the potion waning, leaving him a bit drained and very sore. Pansy had said it might last seven hours, but it was more like three, but if she’d had that final day to tweak things, he was sure it would have been seven. He felt like he needed to sleep for about a week.
. He eyed Draco suspiciously, his dangerous green eyes searching Draco’s face. It was enough to make Draco forget Pansy was in the room.
Malfoy looked out at the cemetery. “You’re seeing the protection spells over the graves most likely. Many of these graves are historical and therefore have a lot of value. The Hogsmeade Historical Society had some experts come in during the First World War and add protection charms to the graves to keep looters away. It was a huge problem, so only approved family members are allowed to make changes to the graves. They renew the charms that start to fade out yearly. The ones that look more vibrant are the ones that were most recently renewed.”
Draco’s eyes went wide as he searched Harry’s face. He tried to pull his hands from Harry’s, but Harry squeezed. Draco sighed. “Harry, let’s calm down. We don’t need to figure all this out right now, do we?”
But Draco could plop like the best of them. And plopping down next to Harry, Draco crossed his legs underneath one another and dropped his broom to his side. He breathed out deeply and then seemed to consider saying something. His brow furrowed and his jaw set. However, he just tilted his head to the side and then leaned back to balance on his palms.
I turned the faucet on and let the cold water run. The soft flowing sound filled the room and helped calm me down. I leaned over the sink to splash my face. I closed my eyes tight and willed my magic to relax. The water was like ice, but it felt good, so I let the water run down my face, my neck. I splashed my face one more time and then opened my eyes.
“Mmm,” Luna hummed as she dragged her quill lazily across the parchment, taking her notes as Harry talked, “And when was it that you realized you liked men?”
She laughed. “Maybe. I thought saving lives was all that motivated you. At least it used to, but maybe your priorities shifted into brutal assaults and self-destruction? If that’s all you care about, I could be barking up the wrong tree.”
“That’s a possibility,” I admitted. “I still think it’s more than that. The forest had always had ambient magic and the school is right near it. So why wasn’t our magic there affected?”
I barely managed to stop laughing long enough to breathe. My cheeks burned from smiling too long. Tears streamed down my face. I felt awake despite the exhaustion tugging at my mind.
Draco didn’t want to slow down. He had said more embarrassing things to Potter today than in the entirety of their knowing one another, and he had been about to tell that caretaker that he was in love with someone. How embarrassing.
Malfoy smirked, leaned in closer and said very matter of factly, “I could get you in the mood, Potter.”
“On occasion,” Draco admitted. It was a sort of guilty passtime of his. He wanted to see what was being said about him and his family. He felt like their hate for him was justified and that he should be subject to it. It was the same reason he never fought back when someone hit him. Yes, he helped in the end, but he was also one of
They decided to wait for the Succubus to enter the mausoleum, trap it inside. Both Harry and Malfoy felt their potion’s shield flare up around the same time. Malfoy had come to the same conclusion as Harry and was about to send up a flare when he saw Harry’s.
“Nonsense, I am immensely enjoying myself,” Mr. Potter sipped from his champagne flute and afterwards licked his bottom lip, seeming to savor the taste. “It is one of the more lively conversations I’ve had all evening. Many of the Ministry officials are painfully dull.”
“Whatever,” Robards said as he steadied his wand and pointed it between us and at a tree at the forest line. “Now back away and let me cast these spells before Reed and Lamont get back with the Unspeakables.”
Harry felt his breath quicken. If they were going to have this conversation, then he was going to say all the things he’d been playing over and over in his mind all week. It was now or never, so he answered, “That doesn’t matter right now.”
After watching Quincy and Stav, two chasers, bet one another that they couldn’t do three shots while doing a handstand, Charlie laughed heartily and cheered along with the crowd. “These people are sort of wild,” Charlie observed, still smiling. He held his glass up to his lips and took a slow sip.
Harry mimicked Draco’s position, except he tilted his head up to the sky and watched the embers of the fires float up and up like a swarm of fireflies. “You think your mum will ever let up?”
“You could just give it to me and then you won't have to worry about people watching us. There’s no reason for both of us to…you know.” Draco gestured wildly to imply sharing the cloak with Harry. If people weren’t watching them before, they were now. As more people passed, they did double takes upon realizing who was making the wild hand gestures and to whom they were directed.
“More ridiculous than continuing to wonder if you should or shouldn’t want to kiss me when I’ve told you to do it, effectively making the decision easier for you?”
Once Luna was done, Potter stood up straight again. He swigged back a bit of his drink and said, “I dare you to switch clothes with one of us for the rest of the party.”
I started to laugh and my body shook with it. “I’m still in pain, Gin. Every day and all I can do is ignore it because if I let myself feel it, I won’t be able to save people.”
A laugh bubbled up out of Ron. A loud barking sort of laugh, the kind you can’t control, that made all the heads in their vicinity snap to attention. “Sorry,” he said to the group, and then more quietly to Harry he said, “Sorry, mate. That bad?”
She laughed. “I am what I am, Mr. Potter. I accepted myself long ago. You’ll recall, I had quiet a lot of time for self-reflection.” Of course she was referring to her time trapped as a beetle in a jar.
The Durmstrang ship was described as a magical marvel by his father. He heard enough about it fourth year as his father complained that the ship must break every secrecy law the Ministry ever wrote because there was no way to conceal something of this magnitude. It was the only thing his father complained about more that year than he did about how Potter managed a way into the tournament and so how come Draco had not been clever enough to do it.
Harry pulled the door open, hoping he wasn’t making a mistake going in without being sure he could cast, and took in the scene in front of him. In the middle of the room, atop the resting place of Howard Benchley in the light of the circle of candles, the Succubus was straddling the man and moving her hips in a circular motion. A blue glow emitted from his mouth which hung open in absolute pleasure and floated from his mouth into her own.
I watched yellow lines stream out of the end of his wand and circle around the victim and the grave. Normally, a trace spell will hover over a spot where magic was used and change colors to indicate the kind of magic used. Purple for dark magic. Red for defensive. Blue for healing. Green for general magic, but the yellow swirl continued to circle the crime scene, never settling over one spot long enough to change colors.
Everything came into focus and I felt my heart return to it’s normal speed. I looked around and saw I was in my own sitting room and not the forest. It had felt so real.
Without thinking, Harry reached his hand up, brushing Draco’s tear away with the knuckle of his index finger. “Draco…”
Lucius leaned down and lightly gripped the Dark Lord’s hand before placing a chaste kiss upon his knuckles. “My Lord, welcome.”
I saw a smile spread across his face as he pulled back to look at me. “You are somehow always exactly what I expect you to be like and yet nothing like what I expect at the same time. I hate it and you.” There was no venom in his voice though. He looked at me and I could see a softness in his stare.
“Potter? Are you even listening?” Draco’s voice cut through his revere. His head was on the tree, too, leaning against Harry’s now. “Merlin, tell me you aren’t that much of a lightweight that you’ve passed out. Figures. You can take on dark wizards, but two sips of whisky do you in. Pathetic.”
“Who got what wrong?” Draco asked, absentmindedly. He took another sip of his drink. It was still vile.
I felt my breathing quicken. Closed my eyes and begged the vision to go away, to stop. I opened my eyes and the man was still lying in the dirt, blood pooling around him, seeping into the earth.
“You sure about this?” Harry asked. After all, it was only polite to give Malfoy one more shot to back out of this bet. A bet which Harry was positive he would win and that wasn’t just the five shots of firewhiskey talking.
Malfoy tightened his grip on my hand. I felt his nails dig into my skin, so I matched his grip and dug my nails in too. “It could kill you if something goes wrong.”
“Nope. Never ever,” Harry said, his answer dripping with as much sarcasm as he could muster up, considering his brain was still running through scenarios where he confessed how he felt and got rejected.
Harry watched Charlie's eyes. They were darting back and forth between his lips and his eyes. It was making his hands feel all sweaty and his chest felt tight suddenly. “Yes,” Harry replied.
Refocusing on the plant in front of him, Harry brushed off the light dusting of snow covering the star-shaped leaves and once he was sure it matched the description, plucked it from the earth and placed it in a jar.
Nikola hummed around his cock and lapped pleasantly at his slit. That sent a shiver down his spine and he heard himself moan. At that, Potter bit his lower lip, so Draco moaned again—this time louder knowing he was having some sort of affect over Potter.
Draco didn’t wait for a response. He was already drafting a letter for a partner transfer in his mind when he tossed the Floo powder in and let the green flames consume him. Working with Potter would be impossible after this.
I took his hand. His long fingers curled around my wrist. He tugged me closer, so we were less than an arms length apart. I could feel his pulse against my fingers. My magic reacted to him. I felt it coursing through me like a river current rushing downstream.
“No?” Draco found himself amused. Any other headmaster would disapprove of this sort of underage debauchery even in death, but Kharkov seemed completely at ease. She watched the party and didn’t wince.
Ron nodded. “It’s your love life we need to worry about now. When are you going to stop hooking up with all of London and settle down with a nice witch or wizard?” He put extra emphasis on wizard which made me worry that he knew about Malfoy somehow.
Harry was about to head over and save Hermione from getting hexed when someone’s hand touched his elbow. He turned slowly, first looking down at the pale hand and slender fingers, then his eyes trailed up past the pale expanse of neck, angular jawline, and settled on the smoke-gray eyes of Draco Malfoy.
“Ginny,” Luna answered in a doleful tone. Her normally dreamy face fell into a sort of frown and she doodled a little heart in the top corner of the parchment.
“Potter, are you losing focus on me now? I’m practically nude,” Draco demanded, his voice cutting through Harry’s thoughts. He sat there, perfect and pale, looking like a dream. There was a look of tired amusement on his face. “You spaced out? I’m in my pants and you space out? How flattering.”
“I might have done,” Harry laughed and rolled onto his back, tucking his hands behind his neck, so he could look up at Draco who was standing parallel to his shoulder. Harry found he rather liked Draco’s over exaggerated poshness. It made even the most typical conversations take on this ‘tactical battle of wits’ feeling.
Neville nodded his agreement and headed over to Luna, practically gliding all the way there. Harry felt a surge of guilt hit him as he thought about how he never felt that excited to see Ginny. It should be like that, shouldn’t it?
Harry, mirror in one hand, grabbed Malfoy by his arm and dragged him away from the front of the line. The instant his hand made contact with Malfoy, he felt his pulse quicken and that feather-like sensation returned with a vengeance. Where his hand rested on Malfoy’s forearm felt like fire, but it didn’t burn—it warmed, it smoldered. It made him
I walked closer, stopping directly in front of him. He stood taller than me even without being a step up, so I had to crane my neck. “If they knew what I was really like, I doubt they would have a parade for me.” I’d meant it to sound defiant, but it sounded self-depreciating.
Hermione spun to face us. “You bet your arse.” There was a fierceness in her eyes that reminded me of second year when she convinced us that polyjuice potions were not too advanced for her. Although finding the proper hair had been. I smiled at the memory.
Still looking around the small kitchen for evidence of a fly, or something, Harry asked, “How do you tell someone you fancy them without looking like a complete oaf?”
With him were Lamont and Reed. Both of them mirroring Robards annoyance. They flanked him like good little minions. Their wands were raised.
“Your turn,” Potter said, breaking Draco from his revere. “It looks like you have a few more buttons to undo.”
“Yes, now shush,” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s magic tingled along his skin as it dried him. He’d never felt someone’s magic so intensely before. It left him breathless.
“Well, technically he is dating someone else, so I doubt he cares,” Harry felt himself gearing up to whine again. He was positively tired of hearing himself whine, but at the same time, he couldn't help it.
Draco laughed bitterly to himself. “I mean, how could anyone see me as worthy with all the terrible things I did. Death Eater scum that I am, right? Doesn’t matter that I do good now, that I’ve undone as much of the damage my father wrought as I possibly could, in your eyes… I’m still nothing.”
In truth, I didn’t think that Malfoy would be that affected. He had been Cruicio’d, sure. Many of us had. Not regularly, of course, like he had. But outside of that what he reveled at the trial sounded no worse than what the rest of us faced. And I didn’t really care if it would affect him when I said those things. I only cared about myself and the anger I felt rising in me at Greyjoy’s implication that I had control over those visions the whole time.
“Exactly.” Without thinking, he clapped a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, a friendly gesture that he often traded with Ron, but when his hand made contact with Malfoy, a white-hot fire shot through him like a shooting star, and Harry felt himself swimming in his own arousal. It was almost as overwhelming as the Succubus’ magic had been, only he knew he was in control this time. He moved his hand away slowly, but missed the contact immediately.
I was standing suddenly. My legs still shaky, but I managed to make it to the bathroom door. I unlocked it and pulled open the door. I felt lightheaded, so I leaned on the door frame and steadied my gaze. Ginny’s face came into focus.
“I know, but getting worked up isn’t going to accomplish what we have set out to accomplish, now is it?”
Harry thought quickly, either he could tell Neville the truth that he was interested in Draco, or he could walk out of here a feign disappointment. He decided to keep his secret a bit longer. “Well, no shame in asking, eh?”
Draco felt his stomach react. Whatever had lodged there earlier, released itself and was making its way north and settling in his chest. It felt like a dozen fairies fluttering against his rib cage.
“Well, yes. That was the first time I admitted to myself that I was attracted to a man. However, it wasn’t the first man I was attracted to,” Harry added on the last part cryptically. He wondered if Luna knew who he had been attracted to in Hogwarts, too. Harry also wondered how obvious he he had been and if he’d always been this easy to read.
Draco always made him feel like he was on display somehow. Not on display in the way the Daily Prophet or the rest of the wizarding world put him on display like he was some rare animal they needed to study or understand. With Draco, it was more that he was seeing the things Harry hid from everyone else and he was zeroing in on them like a hawk would it’s dinner.
“I thought this wasn’t about a bedroom potion?” He titled his head to the side and raked his eyes up and down my body.
Hermione noticed us first. “Well, nice of you two to finally show up.” She was drinking champagne. When she caught sight of our wet clothes she added, “Get caught in the rain?”
There was utter silence, not even the sound of the water moving in the wind, or twigs snapping under the feet of woodland animals penetrated his ears. All Harry could hear was his own heart pounding in his head like the steady beating of a drum. He tried to calm himself down, but there was no use and his finger was still resting gingerly on Draco’s cheek. He moved it, and cupped Draco’s cheek in his hand.
The Succubus’ eyes widened. She almost seemed impressed. “I only need one more death, wizard, and then the nexus will be active,” she said as she slipped herself off of the unconscious man. Her movements were graceful, more graceful than Harry would have expected from something that looked frail enough to crack in a strong wind. She padded across the room and stopped a foot away. Her mouth twisted into a smile that was even more unsettling thanks to the cracking of her burnt flesh. “I was planning on eating that man’s Life Energy, but I’ve had a taste of yours, and I think I’d like the rest.”
Ron sighed. “Yes, he’s smart and you’re smart, wahoo for new advances in potion making, but can we save the celebrating for later? We need Harry to look for magic in the cemetery before the potion wears off or before someone spots us all out here wandering a cemetery.”
“You are so in for it.” Harry knelt down just in time to avoid being hit in the face with another snowball. Malfoy looked shocked that he missed, but quickly knelt down to roll another snowball. Before he could throw it, Harry managed to get his off.
I hated to admit it, but he wasn’t wrong. The Forbidden Forest was the second largest magical forest, only outdone by the Black Forest in Germany for it’s collection of mystical beings and magical creatures. The ambient magic coming out of that forest would be more than enough to make a trace spell go haywire. As much as we knew about the forest and the magic it housed, there was even more that we didn’t know, couldn’t know. I’d been in there a few times myself and still hadn’t seen half of what I knew must lurk in the shadows of the dense forest.
Mostly, Draco saw the Harry that Harry, himself, wasn’t very sure he liked. It was the Harry who sort of hated Ron and Hermione for being so well adjusted after the war. It was the Harry who kept his nightmares secret because it seemed no one wanted to discuss Voldemort anymore—like he had been an inconvenience and not a madman. It was the Harry who wanted to yell and scream whenever someone congratulated him for saving the wizarding world as if he won a Quidditch match and hadn’t resorted to murder to keep people safe.
I grabbed my travel mug Ron got me for my birthday last year, very proud that he went to a muggle store with muggle money and bought me a muggle contraption. It had a lion on it, which he reasoned was close enough to Gryffindor. The coffee only helped so much, but I knew Hermione would have a hangover potion waiting for me when I stepped through her floo.
There was silence on Hermione’s end. I watched her face in the embers. She seemed to be frowning, but you could never really tell with a fire-call.
It had been so long, so incredibly long, since Harry let himself feel anything other than guilt and regret. He’d boxed himself in with it, slept with it, ate with it—his constant companions. All the lives that had been lost for him, because of him, they were with him. All the people he’d hurt. He carried them with him every day, a reminder that he couldn’t let anyone get hurt because of him ever again.
I didn’t pay attention to where I was going, not that it mattered since the castle always managed to get you where you needed to go. Not that I ever quite understood that magic. Hermione might. I never bothered to ask.
“Feels a little too late now,” Harry mumbled groggily. The drinks were beginning to weigh on his mind and he felt like a dense fog was rolling in, blocking his brain from coherent thoughts. However, he managed to add, “He’s dating someone else. The stupid git.”
Draco panted, trying to steady his breath. “Uh, so where are we on ‘how silly the fire myth is’? I know we said totally, but how sure are we
After a minute of holding Harry, Malfoy scowled as if only just realizing he was still holding him. Then he quickly shoved Harry away and dusted his gloved hands off on his trousers as if to wipe away whatever ‘Harry-ness’ lingered after the touch. “What are we even doing out here? It‘s Christmas Eve, for Merlin’s sake.”
I vaguely knew what potion they were talking about. Hermione mentioned it once before. Malfoy freelanced with the Ministry, working on new potions for them. His most recent invention was a magical traces potion that was more consistent and lasted longer than the spells. It also lit the traces up for easier, more discrete tracking. I’m sure once it was out of the testing phase, the DMLE would begin using it.
Ned whistled. “Malfoy and Potter. ‘Course you are. Should have known with that hair of yours. I’ve read about you both in the papers. Big shots, both of you. I read that article they wrote about you and your mother’s work with the endangered magical species charity. Great piece on you, and Auror Malfoy, I must say, the pictures they print of you barely do you any justice at all.”
I turned the knob and instantly I was met with the smell of something brewing. It was a sickly sweet smell that made me think of cough syrup. The shop itself was an assortment of shelves in no discernible pattern all strewn with vials and containers that held all manner of petrified body parts. The lighting was dim, as the only visible source was a wooden chandelier hanging from the middle of the shops ceiling.
“I simply have a low tolerance for frivolity,” Draco choked out. He knew he did not sound convincing, but he was attempting indifference as it was the securest avenue. He stepped backward hoping the physical space would lessen the effect Mr. Potter’s stare was having on his body.
Ned watched Malfoy intently, and for a moment Harry wondered if he could get away with hexing this guy’s smile off his stupid face. Harry clenched his jaw while he watched Ned’s eyes rake up and down Malfoy’s body. Tension coiled around Harry’s gut, and he clenched his wand. He was being ridiculous, wasn’t he? This guy could flirt with Malfoy. What did he care?
“Well, it is sort of a fancy affair, but I’m sure dark pants and a clean shirt will do. I should have reminded you yesterday, but I was swamped with the memorial service stuff. I nearly forgot myself. Ron did.”
Four in the morning found me alone in my bedroom, drinking a bottle of fire whiskey. I had been pretending to sleep, or at least laying in my pajamas pretending that meant I would sleep. I had a book next to my bed for the eventuality that sleep would elude me yet again. Twenty minutes ago, I admitted defat and had it draped across my chest while I swallowed the dregs at the bottom of the bottle. It was a romance novel called
Potter nodded toward his friends. The Girl Weasley was chugging yet another beer down in a race against Finnegan and Thomas. She won and belted out a large burp. “Have one of those, I mean?”
“Why not enjoy like the rest?” Kharkov said, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. She had her eyebrows raised in question.
“You are an absolute menace, Potter,” Girl Weasley answered. She took the glass Potter had poured for himself and swigged it back in one fluid motion. Then she smirked, handed the glass back, and walked away.
Pansy scoffed, and said at the same time, “No way. I’m not going to be responsible if you grow a third ear or hump a lamppost because I gave you an unfinished potion.”
Hermione, like Ginny, figured it all out, but reminds Harry that Draco is a bit skittish and the prophet just published an article that might make Draco fear that Harry isn't interested.
“Alrigh’, shut it the both o’ ye. Follow me. Time fer yer punishment, I reckon. Each o’ ya, take this lis’.”
“Fine. Just peachy,” he said. He looked down at his shoes. Leather oxfords with pointed toes. They looked expensive. They looked uncomfortable. “Can I have a moment to transfigure my shoes before we continue? They are ruined anyway and if you’re going to take off like a banshee out of hell again, I need to be able to keep up.”
My knees buckled under me. I slid to the ground and pulled my knees to my chest leaning my back against the cabinet under the sink. I kept shaking my head, over and over. It was the only thing I could do. No words would form in my mouth. No thoughts. I knew it wasn’t helpful to stay here, but I couldn't make myself move. Sweat soaked through my shirt.
“Fuck,” I mumbled. The bottle was empty and I needed more if I was ever going to find solace in the pure oblivion that was passing out drunk.
Malfoy laughed to himself. “I understand you, you know? Being so prideful, so sure that you can outsmart anyone. That you’re always the most clever person in the room, one step ahead. I’ve been that way my whole life. I’ll bet you didn’t even hesitate when the Demon told you the price was your soul because you just knew you would slip out of it the way you did with everything else. But, I’ll let you in on a little secret, that luck eventually runs out. It all catches up with you until you’re trapped in a corner with no options. It’s what happened to me, and it will happen to you, too.”
“Rachel. She’s a seventh year Gryffindor. Then what’s her face, the one you knew about, her name was Farrah. And they tried one bloke, ironically enough, it was Christian, the one Luna tried setting you up with. That’s it so far. Unless you count both Ron and Hermione asking me for about a month why I didn’t work things out with Ginny. Eventually, they gave up on that one and moved onto trying to play Cupid because apparently I need to be in a relationship.”
“It’s cute how much you care about your little muggle bitch.” Draco added in the bitch because he was sure it would enrage Potter to bursting at that’s where Draco wanted him. Angry. Volatile. Electric.
“Please, Harry, be safe,” Ron asserted. He held out a hand and waited for me to take it. He squeezed hard once and then released.
“My darling Draco, look who is approaching,” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear. Her breath was hot and smelled fruity from the champagne.
“He is smaller than I imagined,” Nikola said and moved form the doorway into the room and raked his eyes across Potter’s kneeling body. “But he is as attractive as everyone claims.”
“Well, you got me.” I tried to sound pleasant, or at least not unpleasant. I think I ended up closer to sounding unpleasant. Sleep deprivation will do that to you. So will hangovers.
“I wish you would talk about it, Harry. If not to us, to someone. You’ve spent the last five years holding it in,” Hermione said. “It might have been fine at first to block it out, but that’s not sustainable. Ron and I both go to mind healers.”
The study was Draco’s least favorite place in the Manor. It was too dark with it’s heavy floor to ceiling velvet curtains. And the artifacts his father collected lined the walls—some of them screaming, others insulting him, most radiating Dark magic so forcefully that it washed over Draco the moment he stepped inside.
Draco’s response came out slightly more playful than he intended it to be when he said,“You may prefer the responses that way. I am sure you are much better company than I.”
Malfoy, who up until then had been giving me a nasty look, gasped. He sat back on the tree stump and looked everywhere but at me. I watched as his face paled and then he was turning away from the fire and retching.
Therefore, in whatever free time he had, he wanted to be flying in the air chasing the snitch. The recreational league he joined was ecstatic to have him on as seeker and he got along with most of the teammates. But it was this choice which would cause him to become undone within the span of six months.
Draco felt his mouth hang open at the comment. He was wearing a traditional dress robe. Yes, it was a bit on the elegant side—more for a charity function than a school ball, but he liked the silver gray color of it and the small buttons that went all the way down the front. “This is the appropriate dress for a formal ball,” Draco reminded him, “I didn’t think to change before coming here, unlike some people.”
Skeeter really was something else. Her eyes looked hungry and that worried me, but more than that, I needed to prove that the surges were a problem. If the Ministry wasn’t going to keep people safe, I would.
He looked good as always, which grew easier to admit after our recent encounters. His pale blonde hair was styled back like usual, but with less product, he looked less intentional about it. Like he’d woken up, ran his hands though his hair and walked out. He wore a sheer white button up with a blue-gray shirt underneath that made his eyes look like stormy waters. The shirt hung open a bit at the top, revealing a touch of his lean pale skin. He looked relaxed and formal all at the same time. I wanted to shove him against a wall to release some of the tension I felt mounting after my anxiety attack in the Ministry. Though I wasn’t sure if I wanted to punch him for always showing up when I felt like shit or kiss him until I couldn’t think anymore. Either would suffice really.
“They didn’t know everything, so they didn’t know what to erase. He apparently had another smaller incident earlier that week. They didn’t take that memory from him and after that, all it took was some serious spell work and a legilimens to restore the ones they managed to obliviate.”
His partner gave him a curt nod and said, “It’s still bothering me that she’s trying to cast. Why is she trying to do magic? She has to know it won’t work.”
There was a relieved sigh coming from Malfoy which told Harry he’d managed to break the stone up before it knocked his partner out. Another string of spells loosed from Malfoy’s wand. Harry’s head pounded, but he could swear Malfoy wasn’t even saying the spells anymore. Harry crawled out of the way and sat back against the stone wall and aimed his wand. If he couldn’t stand and fight, then he would sit and fight.
, he means.’ It made a jolt of anger burn through Harry. Something about Malfoy always made him insane, irrational, and about a million other things. Malfoy challenged him in ways no one else even dared to; he got under his skin faster, and deeper than anyone else he’d ever met. It was infuriating that something as simple as a scowl from Malfoy could set him off making stupid decisions.
“It’s only practical.” Harry shrugged and leant in until his lips found Draco’s. They kissed lightly again, a subtle pressing of lips to lips. Harry kept his hands in his lap, afraid that if he touched Draco he’d never be able to stop.
There was no kindness in her expression when she snapped. “Don’t put that on me.” Her hands were on her hips now.
Harry landed, planted his feet and tried to steady himself with an outstretched hand. His heart pounded even more fiercely, and when he was focused enough, he realised his hand was still neatly wrapped in Draco’s.
He was scanning Draco’s reflection. Draco felt his body inches away from his own. “Heh, right.” Draco let out a sigh, desperately trying to banish the image of Potter pushed against him earlier. Ignoring the pull in his gut that made him want to push Potter away, Draco closed his eyes and turned around.
“There was no time to call you,” Potter spat his excuse at Draco, the same one he’d been using since they were partnered up. “I had to act before she got away.”
Quietly, Potter grunted, which only made Draco’s groin burgeon with desire. Something that had begun to happen once he started to be physical with Potter. He did his best to push the thoughts from his mind, but when he was alone, the fantasy of owning Potter grew wildly and frantically strangling him like a devils snare. He couldn’t help himself when he responded.
People followed me, and I could hear them whispering about how I was shorter than they expected or that I didn’t look tough enough to beat Voldemort. They felt like they had a right to me. A right to discuss everything about me. A right to my body. To my mind. To my life. I can still feel his eyes in my own, watching me in the mirror when I brushed my teeth, combed my hair, shaved. He was in there, watching me. Always.
Hagrid’s voice finally broke the silence and startled Harry enough that he ended up falling into the snow.
There were a few quiet murmurs as Aurors looked through their files. Malfoy shot Harry a withering stare that seemed to say ‘mess it up
He felt a pang of loathing, sour and heavy, settle in his gut at the memory. If he had been faster, stronger, smarter…if he had been the wizard everyone thought he was, then Ada Holcomb wouldn’t be dead. She’d be at home with her husband getting Indian takeaway and settling in for a weekend of errands, or some other very normal-person stuff, but instead… she was dead. Harry hated himself for letting another person die because of his inability to take down the bad guy fast enough. He’d had enough of that for a lifetime.
“You know, I think they are really happy together,” Hermione added. “Ginny seems better, doesn’t she? More in control. Parkinson is a good match for her temperament.”
“Only for a moment,” Harry agreed, letting his fingertips make contact first. Malfoy hissed and pulled his head back, likely because Harry’s hand was freezing after hovering there for so long. However, he calmed and let Harry continue.
Harry didn’t speak, couldn't speak. He just watched Malfoy’s expression change from playful to unsure. Their breath came out in puffs like the Hogwarts Express steaming along. From this angle, Harry decided that Malfoy was definitely pointy like a bird, but also his porcelain skin looked smooth and he found he quiet wanted to run a finger across Malfoy’s cheek much as he had done to the white flower petal earlier.
I nodded and turned to the sink, bracing myself on the edges. I avoided looking in the mirror. “I never really apologized. How could I if I am only now realizing how shit I was?”
“Well, that was a dud, Luna,” Girl Weasley said. She opened her arms out for a hug and Luna walked over to her and snuggled in. “Bless her, she tries.” Girl Weasley added before kissing Luna on the forehead.
I know, I know. Smut in chapter 2? So soon? Yes. Harry uses sex to numb himself. It’s gonna happen more.
Skeeter sat down on the ottoman, scooting it closer to me. She wore a lime green dress suit. Her blonde hair was pinned back like she was a 1950’s movie star and she wore cherry red lipstick. Her cat eye frames made her look ever the reporter. “Mr. Potter, I have something I would like to discuss with you.”
“Hmm, you know what? I think you might have told me once or twice. Or was it three times? Memory’s a bit foggy.”
The air was like a warm caress. It had the beginnings of summer. Yet, there was still a crispness to the air that filled Harry’s lungs with each deep breath he took.
Harry watched Draco mount his broom swiftly. The motion was one of practice, of patience. Harry wasn’t so stubborn that he couldn’t admit, at least to himself, he envied the ease with which Draco did most things. Like his body was built for each situation, perfectly able to flex and fold where needed. Like water fitting into a container, Draco’s body could adapt to his surroundings effortlessly.
Ron looked hurt. He bit his bottom lip. “That’s not fair, Harry. You aren’t the only one who is still hurting from the war, but you are the only one who refuses to move on from it.”
“Whatever, Harry.” Ginny huffed once more and then stalked off in the direction of the crowd. She grabbed Dean’s arm, yanking him forward. He followed her without any hesitation.
Harry placed a hand over Hermione’s and pulled her hand away from his face. “I’m okay, ‘Mione. I’d like to say hello to my girlfriend, who has just gotten back from a month of playing away games all over Europe, if it’s all the same to you.” He winked at her, and she laughed.
“Draco, what are you doing loitering about?” His father’s voice came from behind him. When he approached Draco, he placed a limp hand on Draco’s shoulder. It wasn’t a show of affection, but of control.
Harry perked up at that. He wanted to know about Luna’s situation, if only to distract him from his own for five minutes, “Who?”
It was Malfoy, of course. He and Seamus were friends now thanks to their shops being side by side in Hogsmeade. I forgot and hadn’t counted on seeing him here. Add that to the list of things I couldn’t possibly deal with today.
In one fluid movement, he pulled Draco’s trousers down to his ankles and slipped his mouth around Draco’s cock; swallowed all the way down to the hilt and felt Draco’s hands in his hair.
Harry was beginning to think Draco had lost his mind. He was sneaking out of family dinners, and now he wanted to jump over a fire. “
“Picky eater?” Malfoy asked, his eyes widening. He seemed to mull that over, his brow furrowing in thought. That paired with the tragic heartthrob vibe, and Harry felt a warmth growing in his stomach at the sight of his partner.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry asked after a moment of silence in which he managed to over analyze how close Draco was sitting to him and how his left hand was suggestively close to Harry’s bicep.
Harry tries to study, really, but after everything that happened between them, how the hell is he supposed to just sit there and not be kissing Draco?
They would then enjoy a quiet dinner and conversation, finding they had many a thing in common and that they ardently enjoyed one another’s company thus securing dinner invitation for later in the week, and when Draco let his fancy run completely wild, Mr. Potter would propose marriage and Draco would not even hesitate in his answer.
mine.” Malfoy sounded smug, but Harry saw the look of shock on his face, brief as it was, before he replaced it with a cocksure smirk.
“Say something, please,” Harry begged, feeling like he was about to throw himself off the tower’s edge. “Say something, even if it’s ‘get lost.’ Please.”
Ron ignored my insults and said, “It would help your case if you could even pretend for a second that you were sorry for what you did. Mostly everyone in the Ministry thinks what you did was heroic, in a way, if not a bit reckless. If you made a statement, we would work something else out. Maybe they wouldn’t even need a hearing.”
Lamont looked down at the file he dropped and laughed. He kicked them one more time and stalked out of the bullpen. He turned back, scowling, and Reed jumped to attention, hustling over to him. It seemed like he had her trained up good. Reed always did strike me as a follower.
“You are quite beautiful, did you know?” Harry said and it wasn’t to win the bet. He wasn’t trying to elect a response. In fact, he couldn’t believe he had actually let those word slip out of his mouth. But they did and as Harry said them, he realized how true the words were.
“May I ask why you thought I could not possibly fancy you?” Mr. Potter whispered against Draco’s cheek as they swayed.
Draco raised his brows, either in disgust or appreciation, placed his robes over the back of the bench, then sat down next to Harry. He leant forwards, rested his elbows on his thighs, and sighed. “What a sight, huh? Granger and her little squad of committee members have really outdone themselves. The whole damned hillside is on fire.”
“Apparently someone was,” Ron said. He took a seat next to Hermione on the couch and tugged the blanket over his lap, too. “She’s obsessed with me, Harry. Always watching. It’s creepy really.”
“Poor thing,” she purred as she moved closer, swaying her hips in a very distracting way. It did wonderful things to her legs, accentuating the taut lines of muscle there. “When was the last time you felt love?
I snapped my eyes up to meet his. I felt my pulse in my throat. Ron looked white as a sheet. “I’m fine. Why?”
When he reached the newly built West Tower and the portrait of Sir Hilliard the Bard, who apparently sang his way to victory against a hoard of mountain trolls, Harry sang the password. Yes, sang it because Sir Hilliard would not accept a spoken word. At least it wasn’t a hard note to reach.
Hermione took off at a brisk pace. She checked her watch. “That took ten minutes longer than it should have. We could have floo’d here faster. Damn them for not setting their floo up. So inconvenient.”
Malfoy shuddered at Voldemort's name, but he maintained his composure this time. “Is that what you were chasing out here? You were trying to find that thing out here?”
Laughing, Charlie gripped Harry’s hand tighter and then rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Fuck, this is a mess.”
like her. But she only had a few weeks with the painting to teach it her memories before she died. At best, the portrait was a poor facsimile of his mother.
“I’m afraid it is a boring answer. I was reminded that I needed take a pepper up potion so I could keep up with you lushes. I found one in the captain's private bathroom.”
It had been more than a week since Harry asked Draco if he saw them ever being in a real relationship, one that they could tell people about, one where they could go on dates and hold hands in public. Harry was worried that things would never change between them, or maybe he was worried they would change too much if they didn’t have something official in place before they left school.
Malfoy clenched his jaw. “Take my energy instead. Let them both go, kill me instead.” He dropped his wand hand to his side. “You still get what you need. I won’t fight you if you let them go.”
Fiddling with the edge of the pastel yellow tablecloth, Harry asked skeptically, “And you’re sure the Prophet will print it?”
“A guest? What do you mean?” Potter’s voice was confused and there was none of the venom Draco had come to expect. His eyes darted to Nikola, who was standing behind Draco. His jaw set and Draco could see Potter’s mind racing behind his ever-affecting eyes.
When he opened Potter’s door which was the one to the right of Granger, he saw him tense and squared shouldered.
“Potter, you are ridiculous,” Draco said, finally. A small smile played at the corners of his mouth. His eyes fell to Harry’s lips.
“On that, I will have to take your word, Mr. Potter, as I have not had the delight of speaking to many people this evening.”
Rita Skeeter had been a bastard as long as I’d known her. She was the queen of twisting a story around. Nothing was safe around her, at least until Hermione trapped her in her animagus form. She’d lived a while as a beetle in a jar. It hadn’t completely changed her ways, but she knew to lay off us for a while. It pissed Hermione off when Skeeter’s book came out, so she had sent a letter with a picture of a beetle to jog her memory.
“Well, they aren’t doing feature pieces on what kind of towels she prefers to use after quidditch in the locker rooms now, are they?”
Harry sighed. “Find out soon enough, I reckon.” The meeting was a direct result of his mistake last night, and he didn’t feel like getting lectured by Ron since he knew Robards and Malfoy would both have plenty to say on the subject.
“I keep doing that.” Draco winced. In the mirror, he saw Potter standing behind him. He smiled at Draco. With great effort, Draco smiled back. The gentle sway of this ship reminded Draco that he was definitely not dreaming. He braced himself on the sink much like he’d done earlier when he was trying to talk himself into having fun. Well, here he was—trapped in a small bathroom with Potter breathing down his neck. For the second time that night, Draco wondered why this bathroom had to be so small.
The wind picked up, whipping Harry’s hair around his face as he spiraled down and down on his broom, pulling up at the last moment into a Wronski Feint. The sun had set an hour ago, so that meant Draco was likely settling in for bed. It would be safe to head back to the eighth year common room. Harry took one more lap around the pitch, then made his way to the ground. The adrenaline of flying normally cleared his mind, calmed him, but the gnawing sensation in his gut was still there. It felt like he was still falling, but unable to pull up before he hit the ground.
“Hey, where’s Neville?” I asked just to have something to say. Something else to focus on beside Dean and Seamus smiling dreamily at one another.
I nodded, slowly moving my head up and down. I still felt dizzy, but I felt some semblance of control coming back to me. I pushed thoughts of my mother
A man lay on his side near a recently disturbed grave. There was a gash across his chest. Dark blood stained his jumper. It was the caretaker for the cemetery, my only lead. His skin was pale and there were purple bags under his eyes. One bloody handprint marred the otherwise clean tombstone of the vandalized grave. It almost looked human, except for the elongated fingers. It reminded me more of a Dementor. Those boney death ghouls. I grabbed for my wand in my thigh holster, even though I didn’t need it to cast a Patronus.
Ginny put her hand under my chin and brought my head up. “Get help, Harry. Please. If not for all the people who need you to be better, then for yourself, for that young Harry who always dreamed of something better.”
Potter stood up out of his chair and leaned across their desks to snatch it out of his hand. “Merlin, you’re such a prick sometimes.”
More silence passed after Hagrid gave up trying to pry from Harry exactly what spell they used to make the entire store closet disappear. Harry, himself, wasn’t entirely sure why a simple Scourgify managed to make it all disappear. Probably a mixture of bad luck and spilled potion. Malfoy, Harry remembered, knocked into the shelf where Snape kept some of the more rare ingredients, so it was likely one or more of them mixed together in the fall creating the right conditions for a Scourgify to erase things from existence.
Malfoy looked up at me. His wand was pointed at his shoes, ready. He sighed heavily. “Merlin and Morgana.” He put his wand in it’s holster and motioned for me to move.
“And I understand, but also I fear it is less to do with your dislike of parties and more to do with your worry that everyone still looks at you and sees a Death Eater and not the man you have grown into over the last year.”
“Possibly it’s because someone has their hand on my cock and looks like a god in that suit,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
.” She said the word like it was a curse, her eyes shifting to focus on Malfoy’s wand. “Your kind always thinks they are so clever with your wands and your potions. So, I can’t trap your minds; oh well, that doesn’t mean I can’t feast on your Life Energy. You are foolish coming here all alone.”
“I’m just not looking to date anyone at the moment, okay?” Harry asserted, still focused on her accusation that he refused to let someone love him. He wasn’t sure what she was on about, but he could do it if he wanted to. This conversation was ridiculous. There was something else he needed to do, if only he could remember what it was.
A smile spread across my face and even though I was only mostly sure we were alone, I sank to my knees in front of him. I looked up at him and tasted my pulse in my mouth. I wanted something to distract me from the day and since Neville wasn’t happening, Malfoy’s cock would do just fine.
,” Harry shouted, aiming at the back of the raven-haired woman. It hit her in one angry red flare, but then it bounced off her, ricocheting off the brick wall opposite them, and then fizzling out all together.
That was it. Draco was tired of Potter always assuming the worst in him just because he was cautious. He took the quill and scribbled his signature on the line under Potter’s. More than anything, Draco wanted Potter to think him worthy. He had since they met that first day in Madam Malkins. He wanted it even more than he wanted Potter to use a coaster.
“Yes, father. I was taking a stroll. It is such a lovely day, is it not?” Draco spoke the words with his back to his father. He let his mind linger a moment longer on his mother, sitting in that chair with her white-blond hair in a small bun at the nape of her neck. In his memory, she smiled softly at him and pleaded with him to get along with his father because underneath it all, he did care for Draco.
“I’m not, uh, not attracted to anyone,” Harry managed to say, though forming thoughts was growing increasingly complicated, and he wasn’t even sure why he was talking to her at all. He should be capturing her, right? Something in his mind told him that was right, but he couldn’t form a spell.
Up until this morning, the thought of talking to her, or even walking past her, had felt like acid in his stomach. However, today he found his feet easily carried him to her. When he arrived, she was seated and looking up at the sky. The sun highlighted her face, making her already pale features seem washed in brightness.
It was Draco Malfoy; ex-rival, ex-Death Eater, and current thorn in my side. He wore a beige suit that looked almost white with a white button up underneath. Like Neville, he forwent the tie and went for the whole unbuttoned, casual look. I sort of hated that I didn’t consider that an option. My tie was making me feel claustrophobic.
Draco cleared his throat, looked down at their still interlocked hands, and then back up to meet Harry’s eyes. “That wasn’t so bad.” He continued to stare at Harry, an odd expression on his face. He moved in closer to Harry and looked like he was going to say something, but then they heard Flitwick’s voice from the other side telling them they needed to clear the way.
Potter snapped his head up to meet Draco’s eyes. He looked like he hadn’t slept for days, purple bags stretching out under his eyes. There was a frantic edge to his voice when he spoke. “Should I be more like you and schedule everything down to my next breath, then?”
“Quidditch pitch,” Harry answered. “Headed for bed.” He moved toward the couch and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead, hoping to get away before Draco fully woke up and wanted to talk. But luck was not on his side.
Really, I understood the danger better than anything else. Always have since that first year when Professor Quirrel had Voldemort hitching a ride on his head. I think that was the one thing Dumbledore hadn’t planned on. I liked that feeling in a battle, the one where you weren’t sure you were going to make it out alive. Sometimes when I managed it, I almost felt sad that I didn’t die. It only got worse as I grew older. Throwing myself into danger, never thinking about the consequences, coming out without a scratch. I expect Draco Malfoy, my old rival, had been right about me on some counts. I wasn’t as righteous as I let everyone think.
“See? He’s bonkers, Reed. Who cares if he is good at magic when he’s insane. I bet you-know-who was good at magic, too.”
There was a moment where Harry wondered if he should fight this thing without his partner, but thinking about the woman whose life had been lost the last time Harry tried to face this thing alone...he thought better.
“It does taste better when they can admit it,” she seemed to be talking to herself now. “However, I cannot afford to be a picky eater right now.” She looked over her shoulder at the woman who she’d been feeding on, then her gaze settled back on Harry, and with it another rush of her magic.
“That being said,” Luna picked up for Neville. Her voice was as sing-songy as ever, but now with a hint of mature wisdom to it. “We would like to announce our wedding party choices.”
I jogged to catch up with Ron as rain matted my clothes to my body. He was nearly at the maze when another scream filled the dark sky. My pulse was in my throat as we hopped the hedge and jogged along the tree-line in pursuit of the screams.
“You’re a—you’re a bit close, Potter,” Malfoy whispered, there was still a snowball rolled up in his hand which was mid-throw. His voice sounded strained like he had just woken up from a particularly good dream. One he was struggling to rip himself from. For a moment, Harry pictured Malfoy, in silk pajamas because the prat totally would have silk pajamas, with pillow lines on his face.
“I know. I have seen you in my own,” she said as if this was a perfectly normal conversation, but she didn’t elaborate. “When did they start?”
“So calm down and flirt with me, Harry Potter,” Charlie winked and continued, “and make that blonde git as jealous as he clearly has made you.”
“So then move in with me.” Harry tilted his head up, brushing his lips against Draco’s, tasting him. The kiss was passionate, and made Harry’s body tingle with pleasure. He pulled back, breathless, before he let himself get distracted. “I know you were saying you didn’t know what your life was going to look like after school with the probation and everything, and that you don’t want to burden me, or slow me down, or whatever…but I don’t care. That’s all nothing compared to how I feel about you. I told you, I see you in my future. Move in with me. Say you will.”
Warmth pooled in Draco’s stomach. He let his eyes flutter closed as he felt Nikola’s fingers working at the button of his trousers. Draco felt his breathing become labored as if he forgot all at once how to do it. To his side, he heard Potter’s breathing change and then a thud when Potter shuffled backward into the wall.
“So, I wonder what it takes to make a posh boy like you blush,” Harry whispered in a breathy voice that he had learned was quite effective in the art of seduction thanks to his brief, but wonderful, relationship with Ginny. After he spoke, he let his hand slide down the front of Malfoy’s robes, stopping at what Harry decided was his navel.
. I like it when you say it like that.” Potter took a step forward as he said this, making the small bathroom seem infinitely smaller. Draco tried to back up, however, there really wasn’t anywhere to go in the small room. He practically fell in the toilet to avoid being too close to Potter.
“I’m glad we totally agree on that then,” Harry said, not sure if he was relieved or disappointed that Draco didn’t seem more interested in the idea of them being romantically involved—seeing as Harry’s mind had finally acknowledged the crush Ron had been claiming he’d had for the last few months.
The rain didn’t bother him, even as it dripped in his eyes and soaked his shoes. It should have, but he barely felt it. All he could think about was Malfoy and the fact that he hadn’t been lying. He did think Malfoy was attractive. He didn’t want to admit he thought so, because he didn’t need the distraction, but he had for some time now. He wished he could just blame it on the potion, but he knew that it didn’t change a person’s feelings.
Chase and Williams, two beaters, were challenging one another to a drink off, which only ever left them both barfing in the backyard. And left their boyfriends to tend to them for the remainder of the night.
?” she spat. Her putrid eyes widening in disbelief. She sniffed the air like a dog trying to catch a trail. The man moved under her again and this time she slapped his face with such force that he passed out.
I looked at the clippers and they were long and sharp. Instinctively I touched the side of my face where it almost got me. “Sorry, mate.”
Harry couldn’t believe Draco had the control to stop. If he hadn’t pulled away, Harry wouldn’t have been able to stop what they were doing, his need was too strong. He did his best to steady himself and think. “You’re probably right.”
Forgetting where they were for a minute, forgetting that he was there to make Draco jealous, Harry watched Charlie walk to the kitchen. He could see him in the kitchen now, talking to Levy and some girl as he filled his glass and took a long swig finishing it and then filling it again.
In true Ministry fashion, they pretended like they hadn’t royally cocked up, and moved on. Draco read the whole file two nights ago and was surprised at how much information was magically redacted from it like all the names of the deceased, for one. Potter had simply shrugged and threw the file haphazardly on Draco’s desk, not caring that all the papers flew out, meaning Draco would have to reorganise them.
books. I’ll even refrain from having Gryffindor colors in our room since I know you hate them and if it’s between you and Gryffindor colors, I pick you. I pick you. I’ll pick you every time.”
“So, let’s undress then?” Potter asked, leaning in closer. Draco watched Potter’s eyes in the reflection.
“So far so good,” she answered. Her face perked up. She was clearly interested in this line of conversation. “How you managed to replicate the tracing spells but with a potion that lasts longer and is nearly unnoticeable is astounding. You’ll let me see your notes someday, won’t you?”
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice answered from behind a stack of books that were shaped sort of like a fort, or at the very least a precariously put together wall.
“Dunno,” Harry admitted. It wasn’t as if he had planned to fall in love with him. People don't plan to fall in or out of love. It happens of its own accord. It happens and then people are just left do deal with it in the best way they can.
“I’m serious. This whole festival is making me cranky. All the bonfire jumping and excessive revelry. Everyone is having more fun than me, and they’re all excited for their futures, and I’m just…existing.”
“You swore you could get me in and out without Snape knowing. Can you?” Malfoy asked. He eyed Harry’s bag and it filled Harry with unease. His stomach had taken to somersaulting like a toddler in their first gymnastics class. The fluttering feeling he felt usually indicated to him that he was about to do something incredibly stupid.
Harry fought against the force of her magic, which still worked on him despite her gruesome face, and gathered his remaining strength and said, “
Harry gripped his broom tight. Draco looked in the wrong direction. The wind whistled in his ears as he made his way to the opposite goal posts. His heartbeat, pounding as furiously as if he were facing that troll his first year, echoed in his head. It was the rush he had been hoping for when he agreed to play Draco—the rush he expected, craved.
“The what?” Mr. Potter’s voice was quiet. The question seemed so odd to Draco. Surely Mr. Potter knew to which letters he was referring.
“I like your hands.” Potter took Draco’s hand and lifted it to eye level. Draco watched nervously. “Your fingers are so long. Did you play piano? I always wondered.”
The pair didn’t seem to mind that the rain soaked through their clothes. Harry mused that they looked like they belonged in the trailer for a rom-com, all rain-drenched and hot for one another. She had him pinned against the side of the mausoleum, licking a line down his neck to his collarbone. He let out another moan as his hands made their way down the arch of her back to the slope of her arse. He gripped tightly and pulled her closer, lifting the back of her dress in the process.
“I wonder if he will even get a funeral.” The thought had troubled me since I realized the crime was being erased from everyone's mind. We found out his name; Jared Randall. He grew up in Hogsmeade, attended Hogwarts and took over for his father as caretaker of the cemetery. That was all we managed to dig up on him. But who would mourn him? Did he have a family? Would the Ministry make it look like he died accidentally or like he ran away?
. He did this four times before finally pouring his drink and walking away with a self-satisfied smirk that led Draco to believe that he may have been the mastermind behind the whooping bottle enchantment.
He swallowed hard, and let loose every spell he could think of, starting with Expelliarmus and ending with a Bat-Bogey Hex. Casting made him see spots, and he wasn’t even sure he was hitting the Succubus. Sometimes nothing came out of his wand at all. She had only kissed him for a minute, but she managed to practically sideline him, not to mention she made him think of things he’d rather ignore. All in all, she had him over a barrel.
After what felt like hours drinking in the sitting room, the dinner bell rang and they were guided to the dining room by Daisy, their house elf who Draco actually sort of liked, though he was never going to admit it since his father would kill her if he even suspected Draco had made friends with the help.
“You must be starving, the both of you.” She pulled away from Ron and noticed the wet spot on her dress where they touched. “Oh, you need a drying charm.” She cast the hot-air charm on both of us, smiled, and then headed off to the food tables which were now in the living room.
“Fresh is best,” she said with a smile. “Plus the forest is so full of magic that it sort of balances out my own magic. My mind is quietest in here.”
“Oh, yes. He is such a mercurial man. I imagine that article about you and Ginny did not sit well with him.”
“To what do I owe this unscheduled visit?” Draco spoke, standing up. He moved out from behind the desk and perched himself on the corner, so he was directly in front of Harry now.
To Harry’s utter embarrassment, a crowd had begun to form. Ron was among them, though the collection of on-lookers had the curtesy to make it look like they were working and definitely not listening.
I had to get some air. All of this planing and future talk and ministry bull shit was making my blood boil and I was really considering flooing home for a stiff drink.
I raised my hand, cutting him off. “Let’s not have this conversation again. You know where I stand and I know where you stand.” I downed the last of my coffee and stood up.
Both Hermione and Malfoy looked pleased. They shared a glance that seemed to say ‘this is amazing’ before Malfoy held up his wand. “I’m going to cast a lumos, tell me if you see the traces once I put it out. Lumos.” Malfoy’s wand lit up bright and then he said, “Nox.”
“Don’t put in the transfer yet,” Harry said. “Let me talk to him.” He turned around and pulled a handful of Floo powder out of the sachet next to the fireplace. He tossed it in and the flames roared to life.
As I stared out the kitchen window into the back garden, I felt something calcify in my gut. I felt the way I had first year. Like I was doing the right thing and it didn’t matter who agreed. I knew I needed to find out if those surges were being caused by something more insidious than puberty. I needed to know more about the adult incidents. I needed to keep people safe.
A soft, honeyed laugh came from the raven-haired woman, the thing he’d been tracking, as she tore herself away from her prey. She turned to face Harry, a twisted smile spreading across her face, momentarily stunning him. It seemed impossible that a woman that beautiful could smile in such a malicious way, all teeth and darkness.
“You screamed so loud, you woke up every portrait in the house. Including Walburga who won’t shut up and Sirius who is barking like a maniac. Why won’t he shift back to his human form anyway?” Hermione nodded her head to the hallway where suddenly Walburga’s griping voice filled my head.
“You are insane.” Malfoy shook his head in disbelief. “Merlin’s tits, I’m the insane one. I just ran after you without thinking. I had no idea what we were chasing, but I ran after you. Merlin, fuck, but I was worried you would get hurt. Gods above and below, Pansy was right. I’m loosing my fucking mind.”
“Don’t act like you care about that. I see it now. Your apathy toward the war. You really only ever cared about being powerful, not about the war itself. All your bullying, all your choices—they served your interests, not his. Even this. These meetings. It’s more for you than him.”
Embarrassment like a white hot poker ran through Draco. He straightened in his chair and willed himself not to look away. If he broke eye contact with Potter, he would surely begin to tear up, and that was the last thing he needed. Instead, Draco fell back on old habits. “As opposed to your unending spontaneity. Look where that got you last night. You could have called me to go with you to scout the clubs. I told you to call me if you decided to go out, in fact. But you thought ‘I’m Harry Potter, I’m sure I can handle one demon-witch all by my onesies. Piece of cake.’”
“I think I’ll go say hi to him,” I said. Hermione gave me a worried look, but I smiled at her and that seemed to relax her.
I nodded. The memory was coming back to me, just barely. “Shite, I think I remember. Was I supposed to get a gift?”
Finally, I tried to call out to the man, but nothing came out. I screamed and screamed for him to turn around. Screamed until I felt my throat go raw.
Almost without meaning to, Draco headed back in the direction of the party and not off the ship like he had previously planned to do. He was enamored by Potter and couldn't look away as the man stood with his mates and effortlessly made conversation, laughing and smiling.
“I agree it’s odd, and we can ask Neville all about it later, but we have more pressing matters,” Ron said. “Like tracing the magic that killed the caretaker. The longer we are here, the more likely it is someone spots us and tells the someone who tells the Unspeakables and then we will be screwed because if they mange to erase out memories of the magical surges, who will figure out why they are happening?”
Potter took his and uncorked it. “Thanks, Parkinson.” He swigged it back in one gulp and said ‘Ahh’ before heading out of the lab without Draco.
written by Pansy Parkinson; Slytherin, Malfoy’s best mate, and all around general annoyance, of all people, and it was quite good. But I’d never freely admit that.
“Okay, see you in a bit, Harry.” Ginny took a sip of her tea and added, “You should really ask Robards about that vacation time. You work too hard.”
“Yeah, we do,” Ryder answered. “I tried to ask you to be my partner once, but you were snacthed up pretty fast. Not that I was surprised. You’re the best in the class. The whole school, too, no doubt.”
As he headed to the table that housed the whooping bottles, Draco felt his stomach flop at the thought of starting over.
Just what I needed, a lecture about my life choices. “Malfoy isn’t important right now. Leave it be.”
Draco cleared his throat, and immediately regretted it because Potter turned to look at him. There was a moment that lasted an eternity while Potter searched his face, then finally turned back to Pansy. Draco let out a breath he’d been holding and swallowed. He was in serious trouble if that potion was even half as strong as Pansy claimed.
“Is that why you ignored me the rest of the party then?” So much for not getting distracted. “You thought what? Ginny and I hooked up while her girlfriend was in the other room?”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Draco smirked at his partner. The switch in tactics worked, he’d have to remember that. It wasn’t perfect, but that was the most civil exchange they’d had since becoming partners. Progress is progress.
Hermione turned to Ron and held a finger up to her mouth, shushing him. “I need to concentrate. This is the first human trial of the potion. There’s no telling how Harry will react to it.”
My stomach tightened. The instinct to run hitting me harder now than before. I searched the growing crowd for Hermione. She was next to Ron talking to some tall man I didn’t recognize. They looked like they were enjoying the conversation.
Befor the article Luna is working on gets published, Harry decides to visit Neville, whose new employee just happens to be dating Draco.
“And what is the game?” Draco said, simply to have something to think about other than Potter’s breath on his ear. Potter only winked and tugged Draco forward by the elbow. They arrived just as Granger was saying, “He’s a hack, we all know that, but I was young and you have to admit he was beautiful.”
Ron came into the kitchen holding an issue of the Daily Prophet. “Thought you’d want to see this. I saw it on my desk before I headed out.”
“Merlin, you are truly a mess.” I looked at my reflection and saw a sheen of sweat across my forehead and the ever-present bags under my eyes.
I looked around the hedge maze. They all looked exactly the same height and width. “It all looks great, Nev. The place is like a mystical garden from a storybook.”
“Here comes the Saint Potter speech about helping others and saving the world, again. Don’t you ever tire of this whole righteousness act?”
“Yes, your idea of leisure time and mine have always been quite different if I recall,” Draco said flippantly, slowly loosening his grip on Potter’s chin. He didn’t let go all the way, however. He let his hand linger there and fought the urge to capture Potter in a rough kiss that would be more Draco biting at Potter’s perfect pouty lips than anything else.
He breathed out a laugh. “Thanks, Harry.” He brushed off the dirt on his hands by wiping them down the front of his trousers. “What are you doing back here anyway?”
Draco had asked for some time, and Harry figured that meant a day, maybe two, so Harry gave him space. He knew Draco by now, knew he needed time to process things, but then days turned into a week and school was ending soon. Exams started tomorrow and a worrying, sinking feeling that Draco was going to leave him ate away at him.
“When we were rookies, I was teamed up with him, right?” Reed stopped for a moment and then said, “Have I told you this one?”
Ron gave me a curious look. I gave them a big ‘the prophet is here to take pictures’ smile. Hermione smiled back. Ron laughed.
Laughing, Draco readied his broom and said, “Merlin’s beard, Potter, who knew you were such a drama queen.”
“Thanks,” Draco said. His stomach was flapping about like a fish out of water and here Potter was commenting on art like he was in a museum on a Sunday afternoon. “Potter, are you sure you want to be my partner?”
“I wanted to...to touch you,” Harry said. His voice went up as if he wasn't sure if he was asking a question or making a statement. Probably both, he mused. This was going exactly as badly as he should have anticipated, but he couldn't stop himself now. All he had been able to think about all night was the way Malfoy stroked that petal like it was the most impressive, most desirable thing he had ever laid eyes on. Harry wanted to touch and be touched with that level of intensity.
Fifteen minutes passed in silence. Malfoy stayed away from Harry and Hagrid, but not so far away that he was outside the radius of light from the lantern. Harry spent at least ten of those minutes crouched over a plant thinking about Malfoy holding him earlier. Finally, he snapped back to reality and noticed the plant that he was crouched over wasn't even one on the list. He spent the other five being embarrassed at the fact that he was thinking about Malfoy at all.
“Don’t drink that,” I snapped at Malfoy just as he was taking the levitated cup and bringing it to his mouth.
“Gods, so eager for me, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco asked. But it wasn’t a question because the answer was obvious. Harry pushed his hard groin against Draco’s leg so he could feel just how eager he was—how hungry he was for him.
Even distracted as Harry was with trying not to die, he felt his pulse pick up at the Succubus’ words.
He spotted Ginny in the back near one of the linen covered tables. She had a champagne flute in one hand, and her other on her hip. Hermione stood in front of her, talking animatedly, waving her hands as she made her point. Harry could almost imagine how the conversation was going. He’d heard enough of Hermione’s “it’s for a good cause” speeches that he could recite them word for word. Ginny spotted him staring and smiled at him over Hermione’s shoulder. She tilted her head at him as if to say “gotta love her, but sweet Merlin it’s a party.” Harry chuckled at the gesture and she stifled a laugh. Hermione seemed none-the-wiser.
“How do you know it wasn’t leading here?” I titled my head and raised my eyebrows hoping he would fill in the blanks himself.
“The grave was disturbed.” He turned away from the victim and took out his wand. He cast a magical traces spell to see if anyone had cast in the vicinity within the last half hour. The spell wasn’t perfect. It often misled us or identified the wrong kind of spell, but it worked well enough and it was our only option, at least until Malfoy perfected his potion.
Sometimes, I wish I died in Godric’s Hollow that night. At least then, I would have been with my parents and whatever life I lived up until then would have actually been mine.
I rubbed my eyes with the back of my hand, pushing my glasses up. The whole thing seemed tedious to me with the magical surges and maybe if I was talking to anyone else, I would have said so, but Hermione wouldn’t let me off that easy. “I’ll catch a nap before the party. What time should I come through? I assume we will head over together.”
This led Draco to believe that Mr. Potter was every bit the man he thought him to be and every bit as likely to think that Draco was below his status. In school, they had a rivalry and Mr. Potter never kept quiet about his overwhelming dislike of Draco and the sort he aligned himself with. When Draco had power and finances and could not bring himself to care about one man's opinion, even if that man was Harry J. Potter.
Robards cracked his neck. “Auror Read, that is all well and good, but if you could hold off the commentary until I am finished?”
“Well, I might have done, but apparently Ron gets to know things before me, so I am not sure I am up to giving advice,” Hermione cocked her head to the side teasingly and then she poked her tongue out at him like a toddler.
Hermione’s office was on his way to the Auror department and he had, hastily, decided on his lunch break to tell Hermione everything before he headed back to his own desk.
The pair of them were among the many Ministry employees calling for my termination after I beat a Ministry official bad enough to land him in St. Mungo’s. I found out he was abusing his son. I’d been there on a routine check-in after clocking a large magical surge. Most underage wizards have them when their powers start to manifest, so it wasn’t irregular. What was irregular were three surges within a month—each one growing in power. His magic kept surging to protect him. I recognized the pattern. I reported my suspicions to Head Auror Robards and he laughed in my face and told me to leave Head of the Improper Use of Magic Office, Daniel J. Riley, alone or suffer the consequences. I don’t respond well to threats. So when it happened a fourth time, I went back. When I saw the bruises on the kid, something in me snapped. It didn’t matter that the guy was guilty. Not to them. Not to Robards. And so I hurt that man so he couldn’t keep hurting his son.
It seemed Nikola was no different. He was entranced before Draco even had to lift a finger. Every few minutes, Draco watched Nikola run his tongue across his bottom lip and sigh. Honestly, if this went on much longer, Draco was afraid the man would attempt to leap across the room and fuck him right there in front of his father and the Dark Lord.
Under those circumstances, Draco had expected to feel worse off than he had prior to his bathroom pep talk. Even breathless as he was from being in such close proximity to Potter, Draco felt like someone had breathed new life into his lungs. Potter had tried...he wanted to kiss Draco. The thought felt preposterous, but also Draco let himself believe it were true for a moment as he stood outside the bathroom. It filled him with warmth.
“Sorry, Harry. It’s automatic, you know that. I just worry. I’m not surprised the party slipped your mind. The invites went out around the time you got the news of your hearing.”
“She wasn’t willing to go the extra mile,” Draco assured him. “And I think that is best for all of us.”
Harry swallowed hard as Draco knelt to make sure his trainers were tied before the match started. The scene before him made his body hum with excitement more than catching the snitch ever had. Harry had known that Draco must have been toned—especially since Draco flew like it was the most natural thing in the world, but he had never seen Draco so— exposed.
I pulled her fingers loose. Her grip was tight for someone too drunk to walk a straight line. I searched her eyes and saw her pupils reacted normally to stimulus and the dim streetlights as we passed them. I whispered, “You’re sober?”
“Just blink twice if you’re being coerced to say such pessimistic things. I promise I can help,” Draco teased, still leaning over Harry.
Draco considered lying. He considered ignoring the question. He considered high-tailing it out of that bathroom and going back to his room and pretending all of this didn't happen.
He felt Draco’s grip on his biceps. It was unsure at first, but then he tightened his grip and Harry felt grounded in the moment despite the crowds chant of kiss, kiss, kiss.
“Hello, Draco,” Granger cut in between the laughter. “I assume Harry is also forcing you to play this insipid game?”
I stepped carefully around them and took the lead to the station which was just up ahead. We were some of the last people to leave the party. Dean and Seamus begged us to stay the night, but Ron wouldn’t hear it and made some very risqué comments about just why.
The leather seat squeaked as Harry slid off and positioned himself between Draco’s legs. He dragged his hands slowly up Draco’s thighs, stopping at the waistband.
“What?” Harry was taken aback, quite literally. He leaned back and the chair wobbled before settling back on all four legs. The only people he shared that information with were Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. It occurred to him that Ginny might have told Luna, but he reasoned that Ginny would have told him if she had.
“It was someone you…let’s say, it was someone you were involved with. I obliviated the information from her mind once I retrieved it. And I expect you will do the same to me once our meeting is finished.”
“Watch it,” Malfoy snapped at someone in the line next to them as they bumped his elbow. He recoiled from the touch, pulling into himself like a scared hermit crab. He took three deep breaths, then looked straight ahead.
Maybe it was faith in Malfoy’s potion mastery, maybe it was pure stubbornness, maybe something else all together. Maybe I didn’t really know the risks. Maybe I didn’t care to know them. Either way I found my lips wrapped around the business end of a potion vial with three sets of eyes watching me with apprehension written all over their faces.
Harry kept his eyes forward, watching the inky black surface of the lake ripple in the slight wind. He saw Draco out of his periphery, his smoke-gray eyes watching Harry with a quiet intensity. It made Harry’s heart pound faster. “I, uh, well, it’s complicated, and I’m probably going to sound whiny.”
Draco was to see the Malfoy bloodline lived on and therefore was encouraged to keep his proclivity for fucking men a secret. Nothing would stand in the way of Lucius making a match for Draco that ensured their legacy. Of course, he was allowed to experiment and perform certain tasks if the Dark Lord willed it, but that was all.
“Oh, do let me ask,” Luna’s voice came from behind Draco. “Hullo, Draco, so lovely of you to join us.”
“Oo, you naughty little Gryffindor. Calling me by my given name. You’ll have to try harder than that,
“We just established that isn’t a problem for me.” I smirked, hoping I looked as cocky as I sounded.
According to his father, Potter’s insubordination reflected poorly on Draco’s skills as an interrogator which then reflected poorly on Lucius. This meant that his father was all too invested in Draco’s daily meetings with Potter. In fact, it seemed to be the only thing about Draco that interested his father anymore.
There, in the mirror, I saw something standing behind me. It was a dark blur at first. I could feel it’s presence behind me and reached for my wand before I remembered Robards had it. I watched as it moved in closer to me, it’s form becoming clearer with each step closer.
Draco pulled his hands free of Harry’s and backed up to sit on the back of the couch. He raked one hand through his hair, sighing. “I’m just...I’m trying to think here.” His other hand shook as he covered his mouth.
The taste of Draco’s lips lingered on his, and the decision solidified in his gut. He shook his head, embarrassed and excited. “I love you, Draco.”
“Sorry, just nervous and I hate seeing him with that guy,” Harry blurted it out before he could change his mind and then swallowed the drink in one gulp. He poured another and he and Charlie moved back toward the living room.
Malfoy laughed and jerked his hand back like he was trying to break the spell again. I tightened my grip on his hand. His eyes flicked up to meet mine. “Potter, let go of me.”
He knelt down, so he could look Potter in the eye. He wanted to see that venom in Potter’s stare as he spoke. He wanted Potter to hate him right now. He hated himself, so it was only fair. Somehow it made more sense this way and after their last encounter, maybe Draco preferred it this way. It was safer than any alternative.
“Are you okay?” I heard myself ask. I ignored the hum of my magic under my skin that happened whenever he was around.
Malfoy looked like a deer in headlights. He blinked furiously for a moment and then his brain seemed to catch up with him. “Was that you asking me out?”
She smiled and then started rambling off the rest of their wedding party. Ron, Seamus, and Dean were the other groomsmen. Ginny, Hermione, and one of the people Harry didn’t recognize called Illyana were the bridesmaids. There was a great amount of chatter after the announcements, but Harry tuned most of it out.
Meanwhile, Potter still eyed Draco suspiciously. He leaned in closer and whispered, “Why are you being so helpful all of a sudden? Any other day you’d have fought me about protocol.”
The light coming from the sitting room was bright as if every candle in every sconce was lit. I knew it wasn’t Hermione or Ron because they would have just come up to my room, so whoever was here was not likely a friend.
Ron, still eyeing him like a concerned father, said, “It’s going. The random magical surges seem to have stopped. Mostly it was killing wildlife—birds, stray cats and dogs—but there have been a few injuries caused by a spell gone wonky in the vicinity of the surge. We think we found the bloke who's been behind it.”
“Lamont, Reed, lovely day to you,” I said, doing nothing to mask the animosity in my voice. “Better than your case is treating you, I reckon. According to the reports I’ve filed, you have no leads.” I cocked my head to the side and tried my best to look smug even though the world was spinning around me. Stupid hangovers. “Haven’t gotten any closer to finding your missing kneazle? I hear little Janey is very worried. With such a high profile case, if you need any help…let me know.”
“I’m afraid that I’m no good at being any other way, Gin.” Admitting it stung. I’d always worried that having Voldemort's soul attached to mine had corrupted me and that’s why I couldn’t be happy.
And the humming coming from Malfoy was actually quite awful. So awful and off-key. Harry found that his partner in crime could not carry a tune. Seems looking like a marble statue carved by Michelangelo doesn’t mean you will automatically have the voice of an angel. It was actually sort of endearing to hear Malfoy hum, what almost sounded like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, while he rummaged through the snow covered roots of a tree.
“No problem, Nev,” Harry answered, even though it was sort of a problem because at this rate he would be late to Quidditch practice, but it would be worth it if he could get some answers out of Neville.
“So what does she have to do with the caretaker?” I asked, willing my heart to cease it’s pounding. If there was a connection, I wasn’t seeing it. All I was seeing was a case that got more an more complicated with every step I took.
She sighed, but nodded. “Fine.” Then she plastered a fake smile on her face and took a long swig of her champagne when Hermione arrived back with their drinks.
“Can I make a suggestion about which piece to remove next?” Harry asked, lowering his voice to a sultry whisper. “Because I have some ideas.”
Potter laughed, looked around the table and said, “I don’t see anyone else, do you?” He smiled wide and Draco felt the world around them melt away as if they cast a muffliato charm.
“No, listen, please. It should be against your better judgement to even care how I feel. That is what my speech was about. I was begging Pansy to understand why I would never make my feelings known to you. I did not wish to burden you with the task of rejecting me.”
“Well, I won’t be the one undoing the buttons when I get back to my room, so I suppose it’s going to be easier than getting it on.” Potter winked as he said this. The implications set Draco’s body off. He felt himself get excited all over again. He was thankful for the extra room in Potter’s jeans.
“Okay, so the way it works is I will dare you to do something and you have to do it, otherwise you drink from this bottle until we say stop.” Potter held up a bottle of a familiar brown liquid that Draco hadn’t seen him grab. There was no label on it and it looked like it was missing nearly half its contents. Draco recognized it as the bottle Potter had when he was in the bathroom earlier and suddenly everything was making sense.
Hagrid held up the lantern in front of them and there was a small cone of light that spread out ahead of them, illuminating the forest’s entrance. Then with his free hand, Hagrid adjusted his Santa cap so it was pulled slightly over the tops of his ears.
“Oi, don't blame the sport, mate,” Ron said in mock defense. Quidditch was, after all, Ron’s favorite pastime next to helping George come up with new products for Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.
“I’m fine. Just a scratch.” Potter grunted as he tried to stand clear of the wall, but leaned back on it again. “Okay, maybe I do need to get this looked at.”
She drew a deep breath and moved to stand on the side of sink so she could see my face. “Get help, Harry. You’re no good to anyone like this, especially yourself. I heard what you did. That boy. Sure you got him out of a bad situation, but the way you did it…how did that actually help? That kid is traumatized and you nearly killing his father likely only added more trauma. You let all this rage build up and it has to go somewhere. When you were fighting a war, it went to that, but…now it has nowhere to go but inside.”
Draco couldn’t believe his ears. Magic like that—in the hands of the Dark Lord. It would mean the war was completely won. No one would dare defy the man who could strip them of their magic—essentially stripping away their identity. The thought made Draco faint. And if it weren’t for the Imperious, he may have vomited. But his father was ordering him to remain calm and accept this news as if it were the most normal conversation. As if they were discussing the weather.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “Of course you are, Harry. There are many people in danger. If these surges keep growing in frequency and size, there’s no telling the kind of lasting damage…”
However, Mr. Potter leaned forward to close the space between them and locked eyes with Draco, placing one hand over Draco’s forearm. The intensity behind his eyes was staggering. The touch nearly knocked Draco to his knees.
I wanted to talk about it, but I couldn’t make myself say the words. I worried that admitting the memory Voldemort still haunted me made me weak. I couldn’t afford to be weak. Not now, not ever. Especially not with people in danger. The magical surges could be nothing. Sure. I could be wrong. But my gut told me there was more to them than we knew. If that were true, then I needed to be strong because the world might need me one more time.
“And you believe he was the one showing you those terrible things? You think he forced you to see them?” Greyjoy’s voice grew softer as she spoke. She sipped at her own cup of tea and sighed with relief.
“No way, if I have to play, so does he,” Granger asserted, her words slurring together slightly. She gave him a positively smug look after and leaned forward.“Fair’s fair, mon cher.”
“Your skin looks soft.” Harry couldn’t stop the words from coming out. They were on the tip of his tongue even before Malfoy finished asking his question.
“I don’t know about you,” Potter said, his lips curling into a rueful smile, "but I don't like asking for help; hell, I don't really even like needing help. I grew up alone. No one took care of me. I did it all. Raised myself. Relying on people was new to me when I got to school. Hermione, Ron, all of my friends, I knew they were there for me. But I still tried to go it alone most of the time. Out of habit, or pride, I don't really know. They refused to let me, but that didn't mean I liked it. To me, needing someone was dangerous...for them, for me."
, Harry thought. Anytime Draco was brought up, he and Ginny fought. She would always say the same things, and Harry would always defend Draco. They’d been having the same conversation since the day they got back together a year ago.
They continued on like that; Harry standing between Draco’s legs, Draco’s hands gripping his neck, their lips a a symphony of soft pecks and deep, long, kisses that left Harry panting, wanting.
“In a moment,” Harry said, an idea forming. He decided to tear off his quidditch jersey before he could think too much on why he thought this was a good countermove. He wore nothing under it. The humid air clung to his chest making it feel almost as if the jersey was still in place.
“You’re my favorite Gryffindor, darling,” Seamus said with a wink. That seemed to please Dean because he was beaming again and heading over to our group. When he arrived, he wrapped his arm around Seamus’s waist and pulled him in for a soft kiss. Just lips brushing lips.
Charlie didn’t say anything for a while. Harry finally looked over at him and saw the man’s face screwed up in pain. “After Luna's article mentioned you liking me back then, I figured it was my last shot. I thought maybe if you knew I fancied you, then maybe you wouldn’t even care about Malfoy.”
,” Harry whispered, pointing his wand towards the dumpsters. If the thing was cloaking itself, or hiding behind the dumpsters, the spell would let Harry know. He felt a surge run though him as his magic focused and coursed out of him, though his wand. Then the dumpster nearest him was pushed away in one loud, screeching motion, to reveal two women locked in a seriously porn-worthy kiss.
I hadn’t been afraid of crowds until I started at Hogwarts. I couldn’t move anywhere in wizarding communities without people coming up to me, asking about my scar, wanting to touch me for luck, and a plethora of other ridiculous requests. It was worse now, after the battle. Now, I was an adult and apparently hot enough to warrant every inappropriate offer this side of the Atlantic.
“You’re not drunk.” It was a statement. It wasn’t the first time she held my face in her hands, checking to see how drunk I was, but it was the first time she did so and I wasn’t drunk, and she seemed shocked.
things to Harry, made him want things that he wasn’t sure he could have, but he couldn’t bring himself to say anything after that exchange. What if Draco did think it was ridiculous that they could be romantically involved? What if Harry said something and it wasn’t reciprocated and he ruined their friendship? It had been a hard-won friendship, and he didn’t want to lose Draco now that he had him. His stomach was in his throat while those thoughts swirled around him like the smoke from the fires.
When Harry approached them, he heard the end of Hermione’s argument about sportsman-like conduct improving the overall experience of Quidditch. Ginny was rolling her eyes, but before she could say anything, Hermione spotted Harry. She whirled on him, hugging him before he had a chance to say hi. Her wild, curly hair was loose and hung around her face today and he got a mouthful of it before she released him.
“Sorry, Potter. Snooze, you lose,” Draco drawled. His smoke-gray eyes widening in challenge. He was casually dressed for Draco, wearing only a long sleeved shirt that had, of all things, a band name on it that Harry had never heard of called Ten of Swords. He wore dark jeans and white trainers.
He had a point. I was afraid of this beast in my visions. Any sane person wouldn’t have dashed off into the Forbidden Forest after a beast from their nightmares. Malfoy looked at me, waiting for a response, but I had none. At least none that could satisfy him.
“Oh, come on. It wasn’t, I wasn’t—” Hermione was right. He was serious. I tried to come up with something to say that didn’t make me sound like the biggest cock to walk the planet, but came up dry.
“Grown used to me?” Harry asked, laughter weaving its way into the words. Draco shot him a look, and Harry added, “I don’t want that to change either.”
I spotted the edge of a file that read: Malfoy, Draco [ex-Death Eater, Potion Master and Ministry Freelancer] on it under a pile of memos we also decided to toss around. I took it out last week to add in the most recent report he filed on a potion he was creating for the Ministry to make tracing magic simpler.
In response, Harry dragged his lips languorously up from Draco’s collar bone to that spot behind the ear that made Draco groan with want. “Seems like someone is much more inclined to be late than he is letting on.”
He stammered out a quick Protego at the blonde woman who was now mewling like a kitten, reaching for the raven-haired woman’s face. The effort to lift his wand, collect his magic, and focus it outward to protect the woman practically made him faint. Magic had never been this difficult for him. He felt the spell land though, so he breathed out a sigh of relief that at least the woman was shielded from getting hit by a stray spell.
Harry swallowed his first response which would have gone something like “I was hoping to avoid you” and instead went with, “Fine, good. And how have you been? How’s working at the apothecary going?”
Draco turned to him, licked his lips seductively, teasingly, and said, “No, I make the rules here, Potter, and you will like it.”
“Tisk tisk, Potter. You keep that up and we will be late to your own party,” Draco said in mock reprimand, then, without taking his eyes from Harry, he unzipped his trousers and tilted his head, exposing his long, pale neck—an invitation.
“Really? Succubi can’t perform magic the way witches and wizards can. We both know that. It was part of what you gave up when you gave up your mortality.” Malfoy inched closer to the Succubus and said, in a calm and understanding tone, “You already tried the spell using a battery, and it exploded. If you try and activate the nexus, it will backfire, too. The spell is unstable, I can feel it.”
She looked around the room, uncomfortably. Her eyes settled on a portrait of Sirius I had done after the war. He was in his animagus form, curled up and wagging his tail. “A mutual friend.”
Harry found his eyes traveling with Draco as he made loops in the sky, his white-blonde hair in the sky like a sparkler—the light blurring and whirring together to create shapes when waved around. If Draco had flown like this when they played before, Harry might have been worried. As it stood, Harry had always known he was the better flyer—naturally talented, but apparently Draco was aiming for supernaturally talented because even in Harry’s wildest dreams, he couldn’t imagine having so much control over his movements as Draco seemed to have.
“And why have you broken in? It can’t just be so you can insult me? Surely an inter-office memo would have done.”
Beside him in the hall, Draco felt Pansy’s presence. She shifted her frame to stand taller, no doubt knowing her long, exposed neck would be appealing to suitors. The pale expanse that sloped down to her cleavage begged for lips to whisper promises of love upon them. That and her hourglass figure would attract even the cleverest pray into the spider's web.
Without hesitation, Harry kissed Malfoy and this time he felt the soft, thin lines of Malfoy’s lips. He imagined they were softer than any flower petal. The warmth of the kiss poured down to his chest and settled there. And for the last time, Harry wondered at how he ended up here on Christmas Eve kissing Draco Malfoy.
After his session with Potter, Draco allowed himself to retire to his room until dinner. He found he needed to decompress after being around Potter for extended periods of time. With the addition of physicality to their dynamic, new and frankly unwanted feelings began to surface.
Without looking up from his notes, Draco raised his hand to stop her from saying more, “It is okay, Margie. Mister Potter can stay.”
“No worries. I hope it all works out for them,” Harry said trying to sound convincing. With a smile and a quick hug, Harry bid Neville farewell and got on his broomstick. He was terribly late for Quidditch and had a terrible idea on how to get Draco's attention.
Hermione saw she hit a nerve. “And nothing. They are well written. I read one when it first came out. Curiosity. The genre isn’t for me, but the writing is good.”
“Isn’t it though?” Malfoy tugged my hand this time, bringing our faces so close I could feel his breath on my lips. “At least part of you likes the danger or else you wouldn’t throw yourself into it face first every single time.”
The rumors that their friendship had developed into something more were becoming quite difficult to ignore. Especially as Draco took in their proximity to one another. The comfortability with which they engaged one another in conversation. The ease at which a smile played at the corner of Mr. Potter’s mouth whenever she spoke.
“You don’t, but I expect you can see the truth in what I am saying anyway. You know the Ministry covers things up. The Unspeakables operate outside of the law, always have. What’s stopping them from covering things up to keep the public from panicking about magical surges?”
I felt my head loll to the side and forced my eyes to open. I couldn’t see anything but a dark figure in front of me. Everything was blurry. I was still there. I was still with that beast. I frantically grabbed at the blurry figure in front of me. I teared at it’s clothes. Scratching it.
Looking out at the dance floor, Draco spotted Pansy, her hands draped at Ms. Granger’s waist as she led them across the dance floor. Unquestionably the most alluring pair on the floor.
“No, I feel the same way,” Harry complained, his head still hanging back to look at the sky and the floating embers. “It’s a silly festival based on old traditions and a myth about two lovers that probably never existed. And if they did, their love story was nowhere near as sappy and happy-go-lucky as this. You’re telling me they were happy to only see each other once a year? That lighting bonfires in unique formations honours them, and jumping over smaller ones is good luck? Please. It makes a good story. That’s it.”
Maybe it was the clear head, but I almost felt glad to be there when Seamus called out to me. It felt he was happy to see me. I hadn’t felt like someone was happy to see me in ages. I grew up believing I was a nuisance. The Dursley’s saw to that. And it didn’t disappear as I got older. The setting changed, but there was usually someone who found me bothersome. Even now, Robards made it clear my prescience irritated him. He thought I got through the auror training just on name alone. Most of my coworkers were the same. I even felt like a burden to my friends since most moved on after the war. They were happy and getting married like Ron and Hermione or Dean and Seamus while I seemed stuck in the past. I feared that everyone was bothered by me, so I stoped accepting as many invitations and tended to spend time with strangers and that was only for one thing. I thought I was doing them all a favor by making it so they didn’t have to deal with me, but maybe I was wrong to do that.
“It is certainly not your conversational abilities as I am pleased to find you can speak for longer than five minutes. Before tonight, I feared you ran on a timer.”
“Merlin, if anyone could, it would be her,” Ron said with a shiver. He ran his hands over his arms. “What an image.”
“Ready,” Harry said and moved in closer to Malfoy. The firewhiskey was warm in his stomach now. It was egging Harry onward, telling him that all he had to do was get close to Malfoy and the git would give in.
In the weeks that followed the Dark Lord’s ascendency, many things had changed, but more than they changed, they stayed the same. The Ministry remained intact, but more as a figurehead to placate the masses into a sleepy submission. All positions of great power and influence had been taken over by His most loyal followers, the Malfoy family included.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispered. He looked panic-stricken. His hands were pressed against Harry’s chest to keep himself from leaning in too close.
Ron stood up and there was dirt on his knees and blood on his hands. He looked at them curiously like he couldn’t remember why there was blood there.
“It’s fading,” I said. “I see it heading toward that spot over there.” I pointed to the break in the trees. The sound of rushing water grew clearer.
“What happened with Ginny?” Ron asked. “You guys came out from the bathroom together looking, I don’t know. Looking off.”
“Be with you in a moment.” His voice came out pleasant. None of the drawling poshness I was used to. This Malfoy seemed like he was good with customers
Ron just stared at me. “You beat up a Ministry official. Bloody broke his jaw. He still hasn’t woken up. That sort of thing is generally frowned upon. And you’re lucky the Ministry didn’t want that in the papers, or we could add that to the list of reckless things the world knows you’ve done.”
Most recently, they had the distinct misfortune of discussing Draco’s feelings in regard to Mr. Potter in the hours leading up to this very ball. Pansy was eager in her questioning. Her natural curiosity mixed with her own boredom was a devious pairing that often left Draco feeling exposed no matter how many times he assured her of his complete indifference to Mr. Potter.
“He won’t mind, will you, Potter?” Nikola asked without turning to look at Potter who was fighting his binds aggressively. Draco dared a look at Potter who was opening his mouth to speak, but before he could, Nikola cast a silencing charm on him, so all that happened was Potter mouthing words mutely.
? Harry tried to think of who she meant, but all he could think about was the generous curves of her hips, and the taut muscles of her legs. He wanted to prop her up on a counter, spread her legs, and lose himself in pleasing her.
“Wow, cocky,” Harry laughed. He was doing that around Draco a lot lately, wasn’t he? Draco laughed, too. Their eyes met and for a moment, Harry felt some of that uneasy feeling in his gut uncoil.
Ron smirked. “You filthy liar. We all know Malfoy is like a walking Greek statue. Not enough that he’s bloody rich and talented at his job, he’s got to be good looking too?”
There was one pepper up potion at the back of the cabinet. Draco held the vile precariously in his hand, cupping it as if it were a dragons egg and could crack with the slightest pressure. If he took this, would it actually help him? Pepper up potions, if brewed right, only lasted so long. He looked at the vile and rubbed his thumb over the cork stopper. Something in his gut told him to put it back. Draco decided against taking a potion in that moment.
I smiled again, mostly because I was satiated even though my erection pulsed hungrily in my pants. It was just a bonus that ever since after I sucked him off at the Ministry thing, smiling at Malfoy made him blush. “Bye, Malfoy.”
“Merlin you make it sound like we are going to make you walk the plank like that bloody ghost earlier.”
Neville eyed Harry suspiciously, but answered anyways, “He’s all right. No experience except taking Herbology at Illvormorny, but he’s picking up on it.”
Gently, Ginny placed her hand into one of Harry’s and interlocked their fingers. She stroked her thumb back and forth and then said, “I suppose he wouldn't. I expect it will be a shock to everyone, yeah?”
,” he breathed out, overwhelmed by the suddenness of the potion’s shield protecting him, which could only mean one thing: the Succubus was nearby.
Ron strolled closer. He had a lopsided grin on his face. He looked properly drunk, but I saw his eyes were clear as day. “I think we should portkey. Looks suspicious if we do anything out of expected. We don’t know who could be watching.” He let out a burst of a laugh and patted me on the back hard enough to make me stagger.
Most nights, Harry won and it always made Draco throw a tantrum. The first night had been a fluke. He decided it had been that he was distracted by the newness of it all because on the second night, he caught the snitch so quickly that the game was over before half past midnight.
Robards was an unassuming man. Quiet, until he needed to talk. Efficient in every sense of the word. Not much in the way of looks or muscle, but Harry knew the man was tough. In fact, he often told Ron that he thought Robards liked to look unassuming because it gave him an advantage. If people didn’t think much of him, he always had the upper hand.
The thing that pissed me off the most when I let myself get drunk enough to think about all this shit was that it had felt right, like destiny, when I started out, that—that’s what makes me angriest looking back. That first year, I thought I was doing something brave, something noble by facing off Voldemort. That I was finally myself. That all the suffering and loneliness was an obstacle I had to overcome to get here, to become Harry Potter. I thought maybe I was special, or something. But even that battle was planned. Dumbledore, headmaster and all around conniving-dickbag who raised me up just so I could die, had made sure I knew about the Mirror of Erised, ensuring my victory before I even snuck past Fluffy. The conniving old codger. Everything else that came after was much the same. I was a puppet, a cog in a machine. Nothing I had then had been real. None of it was really mine. Not even my choices.
“I suppose I could be convinced to beat you again, Potter,” Draco said, shoving the snitch into Harry’s hand. For a moment, Draco’s hand lingered. His fingers against Harry’s palm—then he was turning away and heading off the pitch.
A smile crept it’s way across Draco’s face as he looked down at the crown of jet black hair in front of him. He loved it when Potter was like this. Indignant like a lightening bolt trapped in a mason jar. It was when he was like this that Draco found him irresistible, so he played with Potter like a child plays with their food.
It seemed that Draco kept it secret as well since no Slytherins had poked fun at him for losing that first night. Harry let himself wonder why Draco kept it secret. Was it for the same reasons as Harry, or was it because of their history? Was it because things had always been so volatile between them?
“Yes, well, we will be in the library for brandy when you two are done visiting the zoo,” Lucius said, resigned, and then pushed his chair out from the table and stood up. It was clear he was annoyed with Draco, but because the Dark Lord nodded in agreement, he went along with it.
After the mess with the war, Draco and Pansy had made it their mission to gain back a small shred of the prestige their family names once held. In order to accomplish such a task, Draco had to condescend himself to do things that he found no enjoyment in like socializing with people at events such as this, even if one only finds them barely tolerable.
magical surges.” She stopped for a moment and let it sink in. “I can see from your face, you knew nothing about these other reports.”
Malfoy shrugged. “That's what I would do if I was collecting ambient magic on a nexus. I wouldn’t want to be too far from all that power.”
He wore it whenever he felt he bested Harry. The posh prat was so confident that he threw Harry off his game by wearing tight—extremely tight and extremely revealing;
“What happened when your channels went no where?” I asked, ignoring the empty feeling slowly creeping in my stomach. “Was I supposed to let that boy die while we investigated the allegations? Was I supposed to drown him in paperwork?”
Then I told Robards and he laughed in my face. Every time I showed up to ask what caused the surge, the kid was freshly beaten, but he was too scared to say anything. Just nodded along when his father claimed he got hurt playing. The bastard had obviously abused him for years and knew he could get away with it because no one ever questions the word of a Ministry official. They think they are all above the law. How is that just?”
It wasn’t fear that made Harry shake, but the strain of focusing his energy to try and cast. He hated that he’d let her get a piece of him. He’d thought he'd seen the worst of what magic could do to those who attempted to prolong their lives. Voldemort had been grotesque thanks to his efforts, but still seemed human-ish. If this thing had ever been human, Harry couldn’t see it now.
“That’s what I thought,” Malfoy said, sounding sympathetic. “You said it yourself, wizards think we are clever. We came up with a potion to resist your magic, I’m sure I can come up with something to help you avoid your call. But only if you let them go.”
“Ah, then you started to feel attracted to Charlie Weasley?” Luna asked and before Harry answered she started to jot Charlie's name down on the parchment. Her handwriting was bubbly and large. Harry expected she went through a lot of parchment.
Through the crowd, Draco caught the attention of Mr. Harry J. Potter, the most admired wizard in all of London, perhaps in all of England. Universally, it has been acknowledged that to have his favor was comparable to being smiled upon by the gods.
The living room had grown warm during their talk. The fireplace roaring with an unabashed ferocity. Their dinner plates lay forgotten on the small coffee table. The only thing keeping their attention was the bottle of Ogden’s and Harrys more-than-ridiculous love life.
Potter grabbed Draco by the arm, pulling him around to face him. Draco expected the arousal this time, but that didn’t take away from the intensity of the touch. Potter squeezed hard once, then pulled his hand back flexing his fingers like they were sore as he did. “Can we walk at a normal pace, so I can explain myself?”
I brought Hermione’s hand up between us and squeezed. “I’m sorry.” I wasn’t sure if I was apologizing for bringing it up, for never noticing her pain, for accusing her and Ron of moving on without me all the time. Maybe I was apologizing for it all. Merlin knows I had plenty to own up to.
“Yes, Potter. I am in,” Malfoy said, his face flushed from the heat of the common room fireplace and the firewhiskey, “That’s what all this bloody handshaking business is about, isn’t it?”
Without a word, I turned on my heels and headed down the hallway. I leaned against the wall when I was out of sight of the party and waited for Malfoy. It was five minutes before I realized he wasn’t coming. I shook my head. The prick was toying with me and part of me liked it. I decided to go the restroom, splash some cold water on my face and finish up this party as quickly as possible so we could get back on track.
This wasn’t real, Draco reminded himself. Potter was still under the effects of the potion and obviously concussed. That didn’t stop his breath from hitching, nor did it stop his body from aching with want.
“Earlier, I commented on the music in hopes that you would offer yourself as my partner the way Ms. Parkinson offered herself to Ms. Granger and I found myself quite rejected. I would prefer to remedy this rejection, if at all possible. Do you find this agreeable?”
, Draco wanted to add. Her death was taught in History of Magic. A student who was obsessed with her, drowned her in the Captains privy sink—the very one Draco had been giving himself a pep talk in front of only minutes ago.
And that annoyed me. The house looked cheerful with the sunlight dancing across the walls in beams and prisms. The old furniture looked dignified instead of antiquated. The deep blue wall paper seemed bright instead of gloomy.
“The issue?” Draco raised his voice unintentionally, but now that he was speaking louder he felt his anger toward the whole situation. Anger toward himself. Anger toward his station in life. Anger, even, toward Mr. Potter for rejecting him and then pretending to enjoy a conversation with him as if there was no ill feelings between them. This anger came forth in his speech, though he only half believed what he shouted.
Ron turned to me and smirked. Clearly they had this conversation often. “It’s one of the many things I am sure you will remedy once you are appointed Advisor to the Minister.”
Skeeter nodded. “Your Ministry is covering up the magical surges and I want to know why. Don’t you?”
“Shall we retire to my room?” Draco attempted to keep his voice from shaking, but he heard the vibrato. The combination of the wine, Nikola’s thigh pressing between his legs, and Potter watching the entire thing play out had Draco’s heart pounding. To say he was off his game would have been a kindness, in fact, Draco was in uncharted territory for the first time in years.
Everyone laughed, if not genuinely, politely. Standing with Seamus was Malfoy, who looked even more tempting in the soft summer sunlight; Luna Lovegood, who smiled dreamily at me; and Charlie Weasley, who was back from Romania substituting for Hagrid as Care of Magical Creatures professor while he was off doing research. It had been a long time since I’d seen any of them.
“Just ask me whatever inane question you came to ask, so I can tell you to fuck off and leave me alone.”
“That you are on desk duty for nearly killing Daniel J. Riley.” When she saw my expression, which I am sure was not polite, she added, “I’m not telling anyone that. If I was, I would have published it by now.”
When he pulled back from the hug, Luna smiled softly and placed her hand onto Draco’s cheek in a tender way. She cocked her head to the side and said, “You both are more alike than you realize.”
“I wish I had,” Charlie's words died on Harry’s lips and suddenly he was breathing heavy and his face was hot. And Charlie was moving away toward the kitchen.
Potter didn’t know her well, so he took her at her word and said, “Actually, yes. I need the potion Robards said you were working on. The Succubus one.”
The other Aurors in the room spoke quietly about the file, but Malfoy glared at Harry now with a look that he knew all to well as Malfoy’s ‘my father will hear about this’ face; though with Lucius in Azkaban, Harry didn’t know who Malfoy would run to this time. In a fit of petulance, Harry rolled his eyes, and then promptly ignored him, training his gaze on the map behind Robards. There was something he had overlooked about the Succubus, he was sure of it, but what?
that he skipped his farewells to Nikola and the Dark Lord, knowing his father would be livid. He could not be bothered to care about Lucius having yet another fit over Draco’s utter impropriety and what a disappointment of a son he had grown into.
?” Harry asked, trying to understand. The ‘punch’ he'd consumed must've misinterpreted Draco’s intention with ‘doing it,’ because the images it provided were...Harry swallowed as he realised the idea wasn't nearly as off-putting as it probably should have been. This meant two things...First, Harry was definitely bisexual—no more floundering around on that—second, he was attracted to Draco Malfoy and owed Ron a Galleon.
“Don’t you dare tease me like that. I’m already rock hard,” Draco said and pushed forward, slipping his hands around, grabbing Harry’s ass, hard.
Kharkov hummed to herself. “That is all they will see of you,” she said nodding at the crowd of students.
“Merlin, Potter. All you do is ask questions,” Draco said, but his tone wasn’t that of someone annoyed so much as someone pleasantly exasperated.
“Dunno, Ginny found me out like she always does. Can see right through me as if I were a ghost haunting the halls of Hogwarts,” Harry intoned. Ginny had always been the best at figuring out the inner workings of his mind and unabashedly calling him out for it. It was this quality that she shared with the man Harry was desperately in love with.
“Get up, you dolt,” Malfoy spat in his direction and then let off a string of defensive spells that lit the room up like a Christmas tree. Harry realised that Malfoy was trying to keep the Succubus away from the victim.
“Daisy,” Draco said into the empty room and then there was a pop at his side and Daisy appeared. Her tea towel dress was covered in flour, no doubt from baking the scones he saw near his tea cup.
“Yeah, but it’s Hermione, so mostly, it’s tolerable. But Malfoy? He’s like that, all know-it-all about work. That would be fine once in a while, but it’s every hour of every day, Ron. He is on my case about inter office memos or case files or harping on me to use a fucking coaster under my mug. He’s an endless stream of organisation and rules and I swear if I have to hear him say ‘but that’s not protocol’ one more time, I’m going to flay him.”
He treated him like he always had—like a person—or at least like a person who got on every last nerve Draco ever had and ever would have. It was honest, at least. Unlike many of the other people he knew, Draco treated him in an completely mundane way and he was thankful for that.
“Mr. Malfoy, such language,” Harry mocked, licking his lips in that slow, suggestive way that Draco once revealed to be a weakness of his; a weakness that Draco claimed to discover sometime in between sixth and seventh year and had never become immune to.
Licking his lips, Draco looked over his shoulder, and then back at Harry. “Well, the Probationary Board is reviewing my case, and my lawyer said if I had a character reference it could go a long way to showing them I’m ready to be let off probation, and well, I thought of you.” He paused long enough to let it sink in, and then took up rambling. “I know it’s terribly awkward and out of the blue. I would completely understand if it’s not something you want to do, or even have the time for. I know your schedule is busy. It’s just, when I think of someone who knows me, the real me, well, outside of my mother, who my lawyer said I
With Neville gone, Harry didn’t have a buffer, or an excuse to stand at the entrance of the greenhouse, so he moved in further, picking up a glass of what smelled like lemonade but definitely tasted like alcohol. He sipped at it leisurely as he scanned the greenhouse. Most everyone that was there he knew either from school or work. There were some faces he didn’t recognize and he assumed they were people Luna met on her travels for the Quibbler. She collected friends the way other people collected sports memorabilia.
She was frowning at me when I finally looked at her. “Maybe. Either way, I am still here and I want to report this story. It’s the biggest one since Voldemort and I want it.”
I remembered the bathroom at Dean and Seamus’s and seeing my mother in the mirror. Had she been trying to tell me something? And then the caretaker at the crime scene. He had definitely been trying to speak.
The Succubus stopped pulling the Life Energy from Harry and set her gaze on Malfoy. He held up his hands in surrender. His wand was no longer there. Harry wondered if that was what Malfoy had dropped in his pocket, but then it didn’t feel like a wand. It was heavier and more round and, Merlin, it was the Lock Box. Malfoy must have a plan, right?
“She’s trying to cast a spell using the bodies, the sacrifices, as points on the Ley Lines to boost a spell. Oddly, it’s kind of brilliant seeing as she doesn’t have any inherent magic of her own to use. And do you see what’s in the middle of all that?” Potter asked, voice deep and full of passion. His eyes were like Greek fire; a deep blazing green that threatened to burn through the remnants of Draco’s resolve.
Robards grunted and the room fell silent. Harry’s worsening headache was glad for the silence, but he knew the real pain was about to start. Robards eyed him briefly, then scanned the rest of the Aurors gathered: the violent crimes division.
I stared at the sink, not daring to meet Ginny’s eyes. “I lost it, Gin. When I knew what he was doing to that kid. I lost it.”
“I would not expect you to have noticed,” Nikola said. He turned away from Potter and fixed his gaze again on Draco. Licking his bottom lip, he said, “He is nothing compared to someone like you whose beauty will not be ignored. You must always be the most pleasant looking thing in the room.”
Swiftly, Potter leaned in to whisper in Draco’s ear. “It was in the fine print. Always read the fine print.”
“Do you want me to be up to something bad?” I forced myself to look away from his eyes because he was the last distraction I needed today. I spotted Ron looking over at me and Malfoy. He cocked his head to the side in question, likely asking me if I was okay. I gave him a small smile and he turned back to his conversation.
“I like tea better, and smoking is gross,” Draco answered, stupidly. What was Potter doing here? And why was he acting so casual?
“You never listen to me, never communicate your plans to me,” Draco continued, cutting Potter off, his mouth moving of its own accord now. “You act like I am your secretary and not your partner.” Draco picked up his pace. He wanted to be anywhere but where Potter was—he needed air, he needed this potion to wear off.
“Evening, Ms. Parkinson,” Ms. Granger said, nodding her head at Pansy and then turning to Draco, “Mr. Malfoy. Enjoying the event are we?”
“Because you went to the quidditch party with him and you were seen in very close quarters; some might even say you were canoodling.”
Everything in Draco screamed to run, but he uncorked his phial and swallowed it down. It tasted like strawberries and toothpaste. An odd flavor combination, but not unpleasant. “Thanks, Pans.”
Harry sighed, and wished he could keep on sighing until all the air left his body and he could pass out. “
“You’ll regret this, wizard,” she growled, and shoved the dumpster away. Her face shifted before him, revealing a greying, aging face. Her eyes a putrid yellow, and her hair hung around her face like twisted vines on a decaying tree.
He turned to face the cityscape. With his back to Pansy and the noises of the event inside, he let his face fall into a scowl.
. School is ending, and I don’t want to be away from you ever. Just the thought of it makes my stomach sink.”
“Surely, that has nothing to do with the fact that you have hidden away in this corner of the ballroom, nor that you seem unaffected by the music,” Mr. Potter said and then nudged Draco’s elbow playfully. The contact burned through him.
“What?” He asked. He searched her face and was met by the same hurt he’d seen when he told her he didn’t want to get back together after the war. Seeing it made him feel sick to his stomach. “What’s the matter?”
“Oh, Adeline Greyjoy? She's a wild one. Nuttier than Trelawney, but a better seer. Word is she used to be an Unspeakable, but no one can confirm or deny that one for obvious reasons.”
Harry reached a hand out and covered Draco’s fist. Underneath his hand, he felt Draco open his fingers and the soft flutter of the snitch’s wings hit his skin. For a moment, Harry lingered there—the snitch trapped between their palms. The moment felt like an eternity—like there were thousands of years in between the seconds.
Before Draco could answer, Luna appeared at his side. Her eyes alight with something bordering on mischievous. Her white-blonde hair, only outmatched in its ethereal nature by Draco’s, flowed around her like a curtain of spun silk. “Hi, Draco.”
“Get on w—” The rest of what he was going to say disappeared, immediately replaced with wonder at the sensation of Draco’s lips on his. Draco wrapped a hand around Harry’s neck, tugging him even closer.
Therefore, Draco decided, it was safer to keep his feelings close to his chest. Only Pansy, his dearest friend, knew about them. Draco had feigned indifference to Mr. Potter each time he was mentioned in casual conversations or when she inquired as to whether Mr. Potter had accepted his invitation. It was simply that Pansy was highly attuned to Draco and all his quirks. Such things occur when friendship spans a lifetime as theirs did.
Even without words, Draco managed to get under his skin to the point where Harry simply wanted to catch the snitch just to rub it in Draco’s face that he had. With renewed attention, Harry scanned the pitch. He never did understand why most seekers moved around when searching for the snitch, when really, it was probably easier to spot when standing still.
“Of course, Potter. I can handle anything you can.” Malfoy still refused to look him in the eye, now staring down at his shoes. “I'm good at my job. I
“You, well, you’re like this paragon of, of…” Draco stopped, seemingly searching for the right word, “
“Ah, yes, but she got away, anyway.” Draco couldn’t help but push it. Potter made him stupid, always had, ever since first year. It only got worse when Draco realised his attraction for Potter, which served to make Draco an even bigger idiot around the man. Most of the time, he could ignore his feelings. He’d accepted long ago that they were ridiculous and would never be reciprocated, so he dealt with them much in the same way one would deal with allergies—understand that they would occasionally consume him, stop him up, and make his life hell, and then treat the symptoms and wait until they went away. It helped that Potter, while being one of the sexiest men Draco had ever seen, was also the most frustrating.
Leaning in so their foreheads touched, Harry paused in front of Draco’s lips—breathing in the scent of the apple Draco had been eating.
Hermione flopped down on the sofa and pulled the knitted blanket Molly made me last Christmas over her lap. “I saw the Unspeakables arrive and they started to obliviate people. I got nervous and put up a block in my mind without really thinking. They cast the spell without even checking my mind. Sloppy work really. Most of them are trained Legilimens.”
every time someone picked it up. The sound went off nearly continuously. Draco watched as some Beauxbaton’s boy in a pale yellow dress robe picked up the bottle, let it
“That is not the issue. Of course I fancy him. I have always fancied him. I feel as though he and I are so similar, yet remarkably different. I am intrigued by his nature and ability to remain charming even in the worst of circumstances.”
He feared he would lose her to her own ill-advised motives which would leave him alone with Mr. Potter and nothing seemed more unpleasant to Draco than that.
“So I wanted some.” Harry licked his lips, tilting his head in challenge. He held up an empty cup, shoving it toward Draco.
The frigid part of him won out and he responded in a way he hoped would cease this increasingly suggestive conversation. “Frivolity by definition is meaningless. I prefer substance.”
Anger settled in Draco’s chest. Anger with his father for being so empty, for not even seeming to grieve the loss of his wife other than what was necessary for appearances, for treating his son with as much regard as he treated the help. He felt anger at his mother for dying. At the Dark Lord for killing her. He felt the heaviness of anger toward himself for letting his mother die—for letting himself be used in exactly the way his mother had died trying to prevent.
“Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening. Jerry’s gonna be so jealous,” the man said and followed the Succubus as she strode away into the mausoleum.
Once they both touched ground, Harry felt his heart hammering in his chest. He wanted to say something—anything—to make Draco understand what he was feeling.
Ginny figures out Harry's secret: he loves Draco Malfoy. So, she confronts him and asks him what he is going to do about it. Harry has no idea.
“Too much, I guess.” I took a deep breath and told them about the visions and the dreams. About the man in the forest. About seeing my mother. And finally about the beast with no face.
I nodded and headed to the kitchen. There was a small vile on the table and note that said: Had to dash. Helping McGonagall set up. Take this, you’ll feel loads better. -H
Clearly Robards hadn’t been expecting an agreement. His mouth hung open and his brow arched up towards his hairline. “Then what happened?”
That’s when he came to his senses. He wasn’t sure if it was the woman’s cry or the rain pounding down, soaking him through, that brought him out of it. Maybe it was dumb luck. Whatever it was, he was thankful. What was he thinking? He was kissing a Succubus, a killer, letting her siphon his Life Energy. It wouldn’t permanently harm him, but it would feel like someone took a sizable chunk of his ability to use magic while his Life Energy healed.
“What? You think I—oh, no, no, no,” Harry rushed the words out in one breath, putting his hands up as if to push the idea far, far away. His face flushed what he was sure to be a bright pink. Then it hit him that Neville thought he wanted to ask a bloke out which meant, Neville knew he liked men.
Harry blanched. He hadn’t forgotten about the charm, not really, he just didn’t think of it since he knew casting it wouldn’t be possible. Thankfully, Malfoy supplied him with the perfect excuse for his odd behavior. “What do you mean?”
“I know. I know. It’s weird. Him. Us. Whatever. I don’t really get it myself. We hooked up twice. It’s not like anything serious.”
“What was it that made him odd exactly?” Draco snapped, unable to keep the hurt out of his voice. He knew he was being petulant, but it was damned hard to keep his cool when the potion was working to bring all these emotions to the forefront in order to protect him. “Was it simply that he was interested in me, or was it something else that I didn’t pick up on since I’m a terrible Auror and you’re the next coming of Merlin?”
She looked annoyed with him for interrupting, but acquiesced when she noticed the alarm in his voice. He dragged her, as elegantly as possible, to the balcony at the far end of the ballroom.
Draco had a moment to consider every reason why he shouldn’t follow after the man who managed to complicate even his breakfast orders before he opened his drawer, grabbed his Auror standard Lock Box, and jogged after Potter.
Suddenly, he felt silly in his full quidditch kit. Silly, and uncomfortably hot. Terribly, uncomfortably hot. Hot in places that he would rather not be hot in, not when he was still under the intensity of Draco’s gaze. Though he suspected the hotness which had devoured his body had more to do with what Draco looked like in those shorts and less to do with the weather.
“Platonic love, familial love, yes, but not romantic. You can’t even admit to yourself to whom you’re attracted.”
“The guests will arrive shortly. We are to greet them in the main foyer. Then we will have drinks in the sitting room. Dinner will follow. I expect you to be charming,” Lucius spoke these words carefully. They were decorated with a challenge that seemed to say: if you step out of line, there will be nasty consequences.
It was a box for all my bad memories and being trapped in it for a year after the war only made me anxious and a bit moody. But I kept on moving forward, checking off all the boxes that said I was adjusting and never slowing down long enough to realize I hated all of it. I did my NEWTs, I played Quidditch, I made nice with the Slytherins and even managed a mostly civil stalemate with Draco Malfoy. But it all felt…fake. Like I was just doing what I was supposed to do, going through the motions. I hoped it would be different when I was an auror and away from the constant reminders of what happened to me, but even that felt forced after a while. Maybe that explained all my self-destructive behavior. Maybe it didn’t.
Draco’s eyes practically bulged out of his head like a cartoon, then he schooled his expression. “No, that’s not going to happen. No one would believe it. Plus, we all know you’re straight as...well, whatever is really straight. I might be a little tipsy, but you get the point.”
He tilted his head to the side and scrunched his brow. “Um, what makes you think I would give you a potion that is still in its testing phase? I mean, even if it wasn’t totally illegal to give you proprietary materials, the potion isn’t fully complete and that means it’s dangerous. I’m not putting my arse on the line for anyone, not even the Golden Boy. Plus, we aren’t friends, so what makes you think I would help you anyway?”
“They also say I have a devilish smile,” I said, leaning to rest my elbows on my knees. I reached out and placed my hand on Neville’s knee. I stroked my my thumb over the slick fabric of his slacks. “Do you agree?”
“So you’re still Harry Potter and whatever civility we’ve managed over the last few years doesn’t erase the rest of it. Sure, you’re attractive—don’t smirk at me, you know you’re attractive, but I can’t stand you. You’re arrogant and insufferable and a pain in the arse.”
Draco scowled, but nodded his agreement. His body was still in overdrive from the touch, but he managed to start walking again, if a bit uncomfortably, toward the mausoleums. Potter walked beside him. He was quiet for a moment, then he spoke.
“No, not that it’s any of your business.” Harry crossed his arms and gave her the look Hermione always gave him when he was being difficult. “Speaking of, why are you even asking me this?”
“Get up, now,” Draco said more firmly than before. He raised a hand as if to strike him and felt his stomach flutter with arousal at the thought.
I never wanted it. I didn’t want to be further shackled to the Ministry, not now especially since they made sure to cover up the Ministry officials crimes to save face. All that did was prove to me nothing changed since the war. Everyone was still more concerned with how things looked than with justice. The Prophet reported that he took a fall and, surprise-surprise, that if I hadn’t been there, he would have died. Great optics for the Ministry, but no justice for the kid.
He heard the woman, the Succubus’s victim, cry when he hit the demon-witch with the dumpster he managed to move using a version of the
Inside the cemetery grounds, I was overwhelmed by the scene I saw in front of me, so it was easy to push aside the feeling in my gut at seeing Malfoy smile. There were swirls of magic hovering over almost every grave. Most were different shades of white and blue. There were other smaller patches of color low to the ground. Some traces hung in the air like an awning. In between all the other colors, there was the gray ambient magic Malfoy mentioned.
“I’m happy to do it. You’ve done two years of probation. You deserve to be released. I’ll write the letter and send it to...your lawyer?”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. He crouched down. Then, so quickly that Harry didn't see it coming, rolled up a snowball and chucked straight into Harry’s face. As he did so, there was an expression of complete joy.
Mr. Potter stopped their swaying again and again adopted a serious face. His skin glistened under the lamplight. Each droplet of rain like a star in the sky—a galaxy of wonder and mystery. “Mr. Malfoy?”
Potter didn’t respond. Instead, he lifted the bottom of his shirt, revealing a dark trail of hair going to his navel. Draco’s throat went dry. He stopped unfastening buttons and watched Potter slip his shirt off over his head. His chest was a little hairy. Dark hair covered his pecs and trailed down to meet the hair at his navel. His body was pale and toned from years of quidditch training.
“You’re in pretty good shape for a potions master,” I huffed between breaths and found the trace again. It sounded like there was a stream nearby and we were heading toward it.
“Dance with me, Mr. Malfoy.” Without waiting for a response, Mr. Potter stepped forward and extended a hand—palm up. With a deep breath, Draco placed his hand in Mr. Potter’s. His other hand fell to Mr. Potter’s shoulder. Sliding his other hand around Draco’s waist, Mr. Potter pulled their bodies closer together. It felt odd to dance in the rain while no music played, but the feeling of having Mr. Potter’s body so near his was enough to make him forget his own name.
“Now, we are playing a game and you have to play,” Potter said. He didn't turn to look at Draco when he spoke. Instead he looked at his group of friends with a wide smile on his face.
Harry felt himself let out a breath that turned into a laugh. Of course, he liked it. He liked it more than he wanted to admit. But that wasn’t the point. The point was, how the hell was he supposed to focus on the snitch when Draco looked like that?
“He is welcome whenever he pleases,” Lucius replied and coughed to clear his throat. Since he was in the seat next to Draco, he also decided to elbow him in the ribs as if to say:
Potter laughed, his hot breath ghosting over Draco’s hand which was still gripping his chin rather tightly. “You’re pathetic, you know that? If I were in your position, I wouldn’t spend every day of my freedom in a cellar with people who loathe me.”
Harry meets up with Hermione and Ron so they can all head to the party at Dean and Seamus’s house in Hogsmeade. Harry isn’t too thrilled but thinks that it will give him a good chance to follow up on Skeeter’s lead about magical surges.
Draco felt his face get hot. He pulled on the collar of his robes. Suddenly the room felt smaller. “Can you elaborate?”
“What’s so funny?” Draco asked, an unsure smile settling on his face. “I insist that you witness my tragic moment, Potter.”
Hermione’s voice (and he was sure it was her now, thanks to the fact that what should have been a romantic story had taken a hard left turn into a history lesson) still boomed, telling the story of the two eternal lovers and why they burn fires at the Solstice, but Harry tuned it out. He was practiced at tuning out history lessons, thanks to all those years listening to Professor Binns.
For the second time that day, Draco pictured his mother quietly encouraging Draco to forgive his father’s frigid manner since, in the end, he meant well. She was always their mediator. Her nature was compassionate and warm and that so starkly contrasted with his father, who was often as warm and welcoming as one of his many marble statues.
“That’s probable,” Hermione chimed in. “Though if anything the trace spell should have locked onto the most recently casted magic and therefore shown up as a protection charm.”
Harry felt a blush creep up his neck at the gesture. He looked at Draco, who seemed unfazed, and felt his heart pounding madly. Draco’s hand felt
“I see him in my visions. He has no face. He sounds like a swarm of flies. I’ve never been so afraid of something. He makes dealing with Voldemort feel like first year dueling.”
Draco smiled at Harry, leaned over, and kissed him on the cheek. His lips, which were the stuff of erotic dreams, felt warm on Harry’s skin. The evening spring breeze was almost chilly, but not enough to chase them inside. They were alone in the Astronomy Tower under the guise of studying, but the both of them knew what they really wanted to do.
Not exactly standard auror protocol, but Robards cruised to get me sacked was well known. The Unspeakables didn’t even bother questioning it further since they planned to obliviate everyone anyway and Robards’ disdain for me was well known. They sent Ron and I on our way without so much as a sideways glance. As we cleared the cemetery gate, I saw a flash of light that told me Robards had been Obliviated. As far as they knew, the situation was under control.
Hermione looked a little pale under her expertly guarded ‘scholar’ face that she wore when she was studying. “You swear to tell us if you feel any side effects?”
“I did.” He looked as surprised as I felt. “I cannot believe I fucking followed you into this damned forest. I’ve snapped. That’s it. I have finally lost it.” He was mumbling to himself as he tried to step over a fallen tree, but he lost his footing and stepped on the tree. It was rotted through and covered in moss. His foot went through the rotten bark with a snap.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy said, wiping the vomit from his mouth. “It must be all the running though the forest.” He tried a smile, but his face was still pale and sallow-looking.
The Dark Lord is coming for dinner and he has brought a guest, Russian Ambassador Nikola who is here to smooth over the precise direction slight caused by Goyles mess up. Since the Russian Minister for Magic has something the Dark Lord wants, he plans to use Draco’s specific charms to earn him an invitation to Russia.
Draco’s smile turned hesitant, the lines at the corners of his mouth fading as his smile did. “Huh, weird? I think I missed that part. What’s your point?”
“Well, I guess that’s my answer then.” Harry pulled away from Draco. “I have to, uh, I have to go. Exams in the morning.” Except, Harry didn’t move toward the stairs that led to his room, he turned on his heel, grabbed a bottle of fire whisky from the cabinet where the eighth years stored their community contraband, and stormed out of the common room, his heart in his throat, hot tears streaming down his face, and opened the bottle and relished the burn of alcohol as he drank.
Figuring that dirty talk was his best bet, Harry said, “If you want me to get you hard, tell me what you like.”
We both crouched down low behind the bushes and followed the bank of the stream, careful to avoid twigs or leaves underfoot. There was another rustle and this time I also heard humming and then a voice singing. Someone was out here with us. Out here where the black magical trail led us.
Guilt washed over him so quickly, he staggered backward. He had never struck anyone but Potter before. This, he thought, this didn’t feel anywhere near as satisfying as it had when he hit Potter. This felt like the nastiest, most uncouth impulse he had even fallen victim to—words had always been his way of inflicting pain. Not this. Nothing so fueled by blind rage.
His voice was full of lust and it excited me. Promises of a deep pleasure that could only be given by him were laced in between the words like a coded message. I was sweating and it wasn’t the summer heat this time.
Still, Draco said nothing. Pansy and the crowd, mirrored Draco’s silence. All seemed to hold their breath. Harry felt Hermione and Ron behind him, but he didn’t take his eyes off Draco. He couldn’t ever take his eyes of Draco—not now, not even when they were younger.
“It means the Unspeakables know about the magical surges. They know the frequency of them is increasing and so is the strength of them, just like the boys.” I felt manic as I tried to explain the significance, but I needed to get this off my chest more than I realized. “It means, I’m right and that there is some kind of pattern to the surges, but I only had access to the underage ones—the ones they could pass off as underage magic usage which is normal—so I couldn’t make it out.”
“Next,” the portkey administrator called. The elderly couple ahead of us moved and took hold of an old book and blinked out of existence.
“There’s so much. I don’t know where to look. I see something over every grave. Magic really is everywhere.”
A smile flickered across Draco’s face as Harry hummed the song, and it made him look innocent, almost boyish, and untouched by all the trauma Harry knew he’d endured at the hands of his own family. “Back to it, Potter. These questions won’t answer themselves.”
McGrady was running wild, as usual. He made rounds and poured the peppermint schnapps into everyones glasses and made them toast to the teams and the season.
“She is fearsome,” he said with a tinge of pride and we ignored the small wedge between us because it was easier that way.
“Okay…” Draco let his response die on his lips. He was realizing this woman was as odd as Dumbledore had been. Seemly always speaking in riddles, but making sense all the same. He thought how the two would have gotten along. He thought about Dumbledore often these days. Without Dumbledore, Draco would have made a decision that would have split his soul in two. It was thanks to that odd man that Draco even had the chance to think about starting over.
“It’s one of the oldest wizarding cemeteries in England, Ron. We learned about in Hogwarts, A History.”
I wanted to make him feel better, reassure him somehow and that was an odd feeling. I had no idea what I could say that might work, so I opted for letting it go. For now. “Malfoy, please. I need that potion. It’s important.”
“You think?” Luna perked up and her bright blue eyes gleamed again the sunlight that was now pouring in from the open widow, the sun fully risen.
The taste of whisky on Draco’s lips, the smell of him, the feeling of his tongue brushing against Harry’s lips—all of it sent a rush of pleasure through him. It warmed him more thoroughly than any warming charm could. He lost himself in Draco’s lips, in the sound of their ragged breaths as Draco moved to straddle him. Nothing mattered but Draco’s mouth on his. Harry let him take control and relaxed into the kiss, resting his hands on Draco’s hips. He felt himself shaking, but it felt better than anything he’d felt in a long time.
“But why haven’t you asked him out at least?” Ron asked and Harry had to admit, he had wondered the exact same thing of himself. In the last six months, he had grown feelings at an exorbitant rate. It was nearly instantaneous. Subsequently, he didn’t really have an answer other than, he was scared. Of rejection, or of judgement, he wasn’t truly sure. Possibly a mixture of both, he surmised.
As impulse control was never Harry’s strong-suit, he tugged at his glove and exposed his hand to the sharp chill of the night. It stung momentarily, but he ignored it. He reached it up and let it hover an inch away from Malfoy’s face.
“But why right now, Harry?” Draco asked, his own voice quivering though no tears fell from his eyes. “Why not in a year or when my probation is over?”
Finally Neville settled on Hermione and answered. “Cla—classes are good. We are doing mandrakes with the second years. I’m sure you remember that lesson fondly.” He laughed at his own joke and Hermione followed.
“Do not take that tone, Draco,” Lucius warned. His tone was ice. His eyes like glaciers, revealed nothing on the surface but hid multitudes below.
Knowing that their matches were private made them all the more exciting for Harry. At first, the simple rebellion of sneaking out for something as mundane as playing a seeker's game made Harry’s head swim. It was the most normal thing he had done at Hogwarts, since…well, since ever.
That line of thinking was sure to only bring Draco suffering. It was unlikely that Mr. Potter would overlook Draco’s family ties. The embarrassment of his father’s arrest. The rumors surrounding his mother's mental stability. The loss of their income. And surely the stain of his own crimes were plastered upon him in everyone’s mind. Not to mention, Mr. Potter already carried a dislike for him from school.
, before the Succubus had thrown him into the stone wall without moving her attention off of Malfoy. Telekinesis hadn’t been in all the texts and studies about Succubi. That they were superhuman strong, yes, but this was a whole other thing. His head throbbed. He felt warm liquid running down his forehead. A red droplet fell on his glasses which were cracked so badly he couldn’t see properly.
If he couldn't calm himself down, Draco knew he would spend the better part of his night in this small, creepy bathroom in the Captain's quarters, hating himself. It happened the last time he attempted to go to an event. At the beginning of the year, there was a memorial service held in Hogsmeade for those lost in the battle. Like a fool, he went. And like a fool, he panicked and locked himself away the bathroom at Honeydukes. He missed the ceremony and waited until the crowds thinned before he slunk his way back to the castle.
Through his laughter at Harry’s awkward attempt at shaking the snow from himself, Malfoy managed to say, “Merlin, Potter, first your hearing is clearly off and now you cannot trust your own sight? Pity.”
At some point Harry was going to have to stop pacing and go inside. He knew that, but it didn’t stop him. The soft, idyllic piano music whispered through the garden from the greenhouse where the idle chatter of his friends felt more like a warning than a welcome.
“Of course,” Draco said, his head tilting to one side as he watched Harry. His expression gave nothing away. “So, since we’re both of the mind that it’s silly, then no harm done if we jump over holding hands, right? It’s not like we’re hoping for proof that we’re a good couple since we aren’t, in fact, a couple. Everyone else might be doing it as some Solstice fortune-telling thing, but we’re doing it to boost your morale.”
It was quite an interesting bet, Harry decided. It was basically a battle of wills. A battle to see could last the longest without giving in to the temptation and kissing the other. They were allowed to touch anywhere from the torso up, allowed to say things, but they had to keep their lips apart. Simple enough for Harry, since he went into this bet knowing Malfoy wanted him.
Draco smiled at this remark. He could barely help himself. Mr. Potter was more agreeable than any other man in the hall and he was standing in a corner of the room engaging in light conversation with Draco. It was nearly impossible to avoid feeling special.
Malfoy considered me for a moment and rolled his eyes. “I guess—I guess you do.” It looked like it took effort for him to give me even that little bit of sympathy. “You stupid prick. Don’t make me feel bad for you.”
Before he could stop himself, Harry said,“I wanted you to.” He had fancied Charlie back then and he knew that Charlie had to have known. They had never talked about it, but after the war, Charlie and Harry had leaned on one another without meaning to; never physically, but emotionally.
Though, he mused, the feeling never stopped him before, so why should it now? And with that newly braced resolve, he took a deep breath. “Merlin’s beard, Malfoy, yes. How many more times are you going to ask me?”
I felt a tightness in my chest loosen at Ron’s words. I’d been afraid to tell him about Skeeter and her theory. I was worried he would think I was loosing it. I knew how it sounded. Another Ministry cover up so soon after Voldemort. It felt crazy even to me.
It was evident in their body language which was still intense, but for different reasons. They still bumped and pushed one another when chasing the snitch, but for Harry, those shoves were less about throwing Draco off his game and more about the rush of warmth Harry felt with they touched, skin on skin.
The chatter suddenly died down, and the group collectively turned to face Neville and Luna who stood, arm in arm, at the front of the greenhouse. They both held a glass of champagne in their hands.
Without prompting, Draco continued his train of thought. “Or say I kiss you, and you feel something and I don’t? Disastrous. Therefore, it’s better to leave it alone. Isn’t it?”
He was getting his speed back with each match. And while Draco was quick, Harry’s reflexes were fractionally better. Draco was as closely matched to Harry as a person could be in skill, and he was not afraid to dive or try a risky maneuver if necessary. Harry even found himself attempting risky techniques just to see if Draco would mimic him or try to outdo him which he always did—or at least tried to.
Hermione showed great restraint when she didn’t try to correct Ron. “Are you interested in someone? Like as more than a hook up?”
I took another deep breath and felt more in control. “We’ll talk later.” I lied. It was shitty, but I couldn’t take the pity in Hermione’s eyes any longer. She smiled softly, either believing me or deciding not to push it more.
,” Malfoy shouted and threw an Incarcerous, which managed to work, at the distracted Succubus. Her body went stiff and she growled like a cornered wolf.
Malfoy looked at me and shrugged. He made his way over to the fire and sat down on a tree stump. “Professor Greyjoy, why are you so deep into the forest?”
“Oh, shite,” Hermione cursed and then pressed my glasses to my face. They got caught on my ear and she adjusted them.
“I’m not trying to get attention. I’m trying to save lives. These surges are happening. They are affecting adults as well as children. Don’t you care why?”
Another Big Emotions chapter. Ginny and Harry discuss their relationship before the start of 8th year.
I was feeling defensive now. “You’re talking like I’ve cheated on you. We hooked up twice and you barely act like you enjoy my company when I’m not on my knees.”
Hermione sighed at my side. She was looking out at the small gathering of our friends, eyes wide. I touched her arm with my free hand, and she placed her hand over mine. I whispered to her. “Do you happen to hate crowds, too?”
“Wait,” Draco said breathless. His lips were red and his pupils blown. He stood up, straightened his robes, fixed his hair and moved to open his office door, then called. “Margie, cancel my evening appointments. Actually, cancel my morning ones, too.” At the door, Draco waited for her response then turned around, shut the door and leaned against it. “Now, where were we?”
“I don’t feel anything,” I said once the last of the potion was gone from the vial. I held up the empty container to the light to make sure none was left. “How fast is it supposed to—” I stopped mid-sentence because floating around the vial were specs of light like golden dust. It swirled around the vial and I watched it float down and wrap around my wrist and slink all the way up to my neck and then my face. I was seeing the magic of the potion working in real time. It was wrapped around me like golden ivory.
“It took me a while to work it out. I’d probably have gotten it sooner if this potion we took to guard us from you wasn’t messing with my head all day, but he’s come to collect you hasn’t he? Calling your soul?”
This was a bad idea, Harry thought as he took another long pull from the bottle. This time he winced as it burned down his throat. “So, who else did Luna try and set you up with?”
Watching them, I felt a sort of emptiness tug at my gut like the feeling of free-falling on a broom before swiping back up. I swallowed hard. I wasn’t sure exactly why I felt a sudden urge to cry, but I felt overcome with emotion and not for the last time wished I hadn’t promised Hermione that I’d stay sober.
The humidity was thick and suffocating, like a heavy blanket had been thrown over the forest. I had to follow that trail, had to find out where the magic originated. I jogged, stepping over fallen trees and watching for rocks. There was so much ambient magic around me that I had trouble keeping my focus on the black trail in front of me as it started to fade. It swooped under other traces, over them, moving around trees and through brushes. I turned back and realized I was deep into the forest. I couldn't see the cemetery anymore, but I saw a tuft of white-blond hair bobbing in between the trees. Malfoy followed me in.
As he finished, his chest heaving, Draco heard the crash of glass on the balcony floor behind him. Draco whipped around to see Mr. Potter standing at the threshold. Broken glass was shattered in front of him. A slight flush of pink stained his cheeks and before Draco could explain his words.
Potter smirked at Draco’s accusation. He looked down at his clothes—the jeans and white undershirt. “I wore this under my robes.”
Though in no way would it be considered cheating, Draco felt himself balk at the idea of sleeping with someone else. Of course, this was ridiculous since Potter did not reciprocate any sexual feelings toward Draco—let alone feelings beside hate, so at best, Draco’s feelings were a wild fantasy and at worst, they were going to drive Draco completely mad. It was completely one-sided attraction and it would remain as such, so possibly this is what Draco needed to distract himself from the hysterical notion that Potter would ever consider sleeping with him.
“Just a tad,” I admitted because it was Neville and if anyone outside of Ron and Hermione could fathom why this day made me feel like shit on toast, it was Neville and at least he never asked me if I was okay because he already knew the answer. He had spent the year before the war here, with the Carrows and all the torturing. He’d killed people in the battle, too. Loads of us had. But more than that, Neville had almost been me. Well, the Saviour Boy Who Lived me, not me-me. The prophecy about Voldemort had fit us both. I’d just been lucky. Yay me.
“He could have just passed out?” Ron’s voice came from directly above my face. I could feel his breath hot on my face. He was shaking my shoulders. “Harry, what the actual fu—”
I looked down at my hands and saw them shaking. Sweat beaded at my hair line and I felt a droplet slide down my temple. “I was thinking. Sorry.”
Ron knelt down next to the man to check for a pulse. He looked up at me and shook his head. The man was dead. His eyes were open, empty. I couldn’t look at him. The blood was still seeping out of the gash on his chest. If we’d been just a little faster, we might have made it before he died. If I hadn’t let Malfoy distract me, I would have been here. I could have helped him.
“Not my fault you slept through it. Come on, Potter. Who are the lucky ladies your friends deemed good enough for you?”
“The kind that tells me it’s more than just kids having magical surges. More than the surges themselves, even. A few graves have been vandalized. Some bones removed from coffins all corresponding with the dates of
The rain was falling harder. Draco felt a slight chill run up his spine. His entire body was wet to the core. His robes clung to him. And even though part of his mind was occupied with the fact that he would most certainly be ill, a bigger part was focused on Mr. Potter’s lips as they formed an answer.
There was a rustling in the bushes down stream. My eyes snapped over to the sound. I had my wand in my hand. I whispered, “Stay here.”
If he had been an observer to this kind of interaction, in a setting such as this, he wouldn’t hesitate to think they were having a lovers’ quarrel. However, Harry was sure, no one would think that he and Malfoy were having anything other than a normal quarrel as they were so accustomed to doing even
