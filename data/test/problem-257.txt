“I don’t want to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable I just want to get to know you a little better. Is there something you want to talk about?” Draco asked, shifted a little bit closer to his roommate on the couch.
“It's okay, Draco I like talking to you, and getting to know you. I liked...this, that happened tonight, and I think you’re adorable when you’re awkwardly stumbling through your words then. Also, I’m gay too but that’s less of a secret nothing in my life is a secret”
“And that was hardly the most interesting thing that happened that match.” Harry joked, and he felt a rush of joy when several of the people around him chuckled and smiled at his statement. He smiled as he turned to his plate, slicing the piece of meat he grabbed into large pieces, Draco eyed him suspiciously as he did so.
“Moons, where are you?” Sirius thought out loud he didn’t know what to do should he write to Harry or respond to Dumbledore first. The Hogwarts owl was still sitting in his window, perhaps just waiting for a treat for all his troubles.
“No no no no no….” Harry whimpered out, looking at the body of his best friend and his family - the only people who had ever taken care of him before.
The first family that Harry ever really had and it was gone because Harry wasn’t good enough. Wasn’t good enough to keep his friends, wasn’t good enough for Gryffindor, wasn’t good enough to save Percy. Harry wasn’t enough.
“Harry we would never ask us to share more than you’re comfortable with us, but just so you know Draco and me, we stick together because we both know what it’s like to be scared of home, we know how hard it is to be a person in a world where you can’t trust others because you’ve always been shown otherwise. If the muggles you live with are half as bad as I reckon they are, I just wanted you to know that we get it and if you ever need someone to talk to you can come to us.”
“Professor, could you please grab me a vial of instant cut closure from medical storage. Most of this will heal itself with some assistance from the potions I will send you back with. However, there are two particularly nasty ones that I  feel should be dealt with now. Then we have just a few more things to discuss and you can be on your way. I’m not going to keep you here Mr. Potter, I know how much you dislike it.” Madame Pomfrey spoke with a smile that Severus was grateful for, he wasn’t sure if he could manage to smile right now if his life depended on it - even with all his years of spy training. He was ready to kill the muggles that did this.
“My relatives preferred to eat alone as a family, so I’d set the table and make dinner, and when they were finished and I had everything cleaned my aunt would give me some of what was leftover. I normally just ate quickly at the counter though before she could change her mind and take it away.” Harry spoke in a casual tone but his classmates looked horrified. Harry’s heart sunk, he had messed up, and now his new housemates are just as disgusted with him as the Gryffindors were.
“No Sir, there hasn’t been any other big trouble. There was a hostile conversation in the great hall but it was anticipated and we handled it.” Draco spoke formally and nodded in thanks as he finished
They worked until some fourth years came through the common room informing them it was dinner time, they packed up their things and started to walk up to the great hall. As Harry, Draco, Theo, and Blaise walked past the potions classroom in the dungeons Professor Snape called Harry in.
“Mr. Potter,” Flitwick’s calm voice interrupted Harry’s thoughts. “I assure you, Mrs. Granger’s outburst will be dealt with. I am very confident that you did not cheat on this exam, I only wanted to speak with you about your mark because I think it proves you are exactly where you need to be. No matter what anyone else says.”
“Professor...could I ask, where did you get that blanket?” Harry embarrassedly asked a question that came to mind
“I love you, Remus, thank you.” Sirius kissed him again before making his way back to his desk to grab some parchment and write the old man a letter.
“I have to respond to Fumbles soon but I don’t know what to say to him. I want to talk to Harry first, I need to know he’s okay before I subject myself to be one of the old mans bloody pawns. I won’t do anything to hurt Harry, for anyone” Sirius spat.
“Now Harry, Professor Snape has informed me of your detention with Professor Umbridge last night. Can you confirm for me that what he has told me is all true, she had you write lines with a black quill?” the old man asked,
Instantly the large silver stag erupted from Harry’s wand and began trotting joyfully around the room. With a swoosh of his wand, Harry called back the stang and turned to his friends, they all looked stunned.
“Give me a break,” Harry whined but matched Pansy’s joking tone, “I’m so tired, actually working in class is so much harder.” that statement earned a genuine laugh from Draco.
Harry’s cries had continued and kept getting louder and more frequent, now that Draco was next to his bed he could also see that Harry was practically vibrating his tremors were so continuous.
Harry took a deep breath before answering, “I suppose I’m just used to making sure I don’t draw too much attention to myself, so I just worked on Ron’s level before but I’ve always been able to make potions like this. I like making potions it’s a science and if you know how to do them well then you can just mess it up a little in the right way to make it okay even if it’s not great, I’ve read a bunch of potions books in my free time.”
The voice sounded like the hiss of a snake, but Uncle Vernon reacted to the disembodied sound and Harry was positive his uncle wasn’t a parslemouth so it must be a persons voice.
“Sirius, James would want you - want us to do whatever is best for Harry. You have to know that.” Remus knew that Sirius knew it, no one (Except perhaps Lily) knew James better than Sirius, and James loved nothing (Except perhaps Lily) as much as Harry.
Harry noticed the Thestrals for the first time as he road over to the castle, of course, he didn’t say anything to the group of Hufflepuffs he was riding with. They just stared at him, and he couldn’t tell if they were angry or just confused as to why he was riding with them and not with other Gryffindors Harry didn’t have the energy to talk to them.
Sirius spent the next hour trying to decide what to do. He felt like he couldn’t make a decent decision without Remus there, so he spent the day researching the type of magic Dumbledore had referenced.
The twins spoke back and forth like it was rehearsed, Harry happened to know it wasn’t that’s just how they were.
The room was elongated with two beds lined up on both walls, in between the beds furthest from the door was the fireplace, and on the other side of the door was a sink with a mirror and a door that Harry assumed led to a bathroom. He felt oddly at home in this foreign room, he wondered if he had made a mistake years ago when he convinced the hat to place him in Gryffindor. Harry was pulled from his thoughts when Draco started to speak again.
“These are the students you asked to speak with Professor.” Snape nodded and Rackharrow exited, closing the office door behind him.
He quickly made his way to the doorway of his classroom and was unsurprised to find the room filled with chatter and the occasional random object flying around.
“I am again very sorry for the discomfort that caused, but you should have no problem removing the scars now that it’s finished.” She paused for a moment, it looked as if she was deciding whether or not to say more, “and Mr. Potter,” she took another deep breath then continued, “if you ever find yourself in need of my services again...just send an owl.” She spoke as if she knew a secret that no one else did and it made Harry feel uneasy but he didn’t ask any questions - not that he would have had the chance to, Rue Raywood made a very speedy exit after her ominous statement.
“Did I dream it all up?” Harry asked himself as he slid out of bed and walked toward the window, It was still dark outside maybe Hedwig would be flying around close by.
With Draco’s advice in mind, Harry pulled his hands neatly into his lap and sat up as straight as he could. Lost in thought about all he might be doing wrong, Harry didn’t notice the door open so he jumped when he heard his Headmasters voice.
Dumbledore informed me that the magic from the school and the sorting hat wants to move Mr. Potter into your house and that you have already received this information. I’m sure there has been a mistake Harry has always been so happy here. I will let you know when I’ve got it all sorted out and we can reverse it all and set things back on the right track. If you know anything helpful please stop by the Headmaster’s office, we’re hard at work.
“Professor, we don’t need to file a report. I didn’t mean to cause all this trouble.” Harry desperately wanted this to be over, he just wanted to lay in his bed and block out the pain and try to avoid another detention. Frankly, Harry was getting sick of always being at the center of things, he wanted to float in the background and avoid the public eye even if it was just for a year.
Harry stood near his professor’s door and grinned, he had left that meeting feeling much better than he had anticipated. Snape knew his mother and he had offered to tell Harry bout her, plus he was going to keep his secret, and that was all Harry cared about at the moment. Sure he’d have to make sure to cast an even stronger silencing charm because despite what his professor had said Harry still believed that his nightmares would burden his new dormmates.
“Why do you do that, apologize just because we’ve treated you with some basic decency?” Draco’s voice was soft and calm and it made Harry feel oddly safe ...and wasn’t that something, Draco Malfoy making Harry feel safe a month ago he wouldn’t have believed it but everything just felt so right.
“what in Merlin's name did you two do to get out of Snape's class," Pansy demanded when she saw them both sitting together laughing in front of the fireplace.
“Professor, did you know I was going to freak out? Is that why you had the potion with you?” Harry asked as soon as the door was firmly closed behind Madam Bones. Snape nearly chuckled at the question,
Neville had said that some people just needed time, he made it sound like maybe one day things would be okay again. Harry knew that wasn’t true, he had screwed up so bad that he lost everything. His house turned on him, the people who were supposed to be his family, the ones that should care for him, have finally had enough of the boy who lived.
Harry slipped quietly into the garage and started scanning the room for his bright red racing broom. It took a few moments, but eventually, he found it hidden under a pile of Dudleys larger old toys.
“And now the hellebore,” Draco removed the stirring spoon and reached for the vial of hellebore uncapping it. He was about to add the required seven drops when Harry called out, “No, wait!”
Harry liked this woman, she was kind and she explained everything before she started, “Yes Ma’am, I’m ready now.”
He decided it wasn’t worth the risk of getting caught to pick the lock on his door like Fred and George had taught him, instead he headed to his hiding place, he hoped he had something to eat under the floor.
“Headmaster, this is highly inappropriate. A student is clearly in distress, we have discussed the matter we came here for and now we will be leaving.” Snape stood with grace despite his anger.
“Your fault! Your fault! Your fault!” The nine Weasleys stood, their eyes still lifeless but their mouths and bodies were moving. Chanting louder as they approached.
“Good, really good actually. Everyone in Slytherin has been so kind and the term has started well. I got perfect marks on my first exam.” Harry answered
Harry checked the small watch he had brought with him, the Dursleys would be waking up in about two hours, and seeing as he still didn’t have a plan for getting back to his room without being caught by his uncle or being expelled for using underaged magic he decided it was time to head back. He cleaned up his things and put them back in his bag neatly, he slid the cloak over himself and started the trek back to Privet Drive.
“Yeah Pads, I’ll take it tomorrow. Come on let’s get you something to eat, I’m sure you haven’t left this room once today.” Remus, to no one’s surprise, was completely correct and Sirius’ stomach rumbled at the notion of food.
“Harry, I’m not going to get any closer if you don’t want me to, but I’m not going to leave until you want me to either, okay. Just take your time, and tell me what you need when you’re ready. I’m not going anywhere.” Draco was just speaking to fill space at this point, but he wanted Harry to know he wasn’t going to be alone.
The pair continued to work together, they were terrific adding ingredients and stirring the brew, working in a harmony neither of them had experienced with their previous potions partners. Harry had just added the last bit of moonstone and Draco was watching the cauldron change colors once again, this time from grey to orange as the draught bubbled.
Once the group all had a thorough look around the room Harry said he’d try and teach them the charm.
Sirius sat down at the kitchen table and opened the letter; he wished Remus were there with him as he began to read. Something was wrong with Harry and wasn’t that though enough to send Sirius into a full panic before he had even finished reading. Dumbledore wouldn’t be writing to him if there wasn’t a
“Thank you, Professor Snape, that would be amazing.” Harry smiled as they both stood to leave the small office. “Wait! I’m sorry I just, could I ask one more thing, Professor?”
Defense went much better than it had last week, Harry and the other Slytherins kept quiet and did as they were told. Snape had warned all of his students to avoid getting detention with Professor Umbridge. The Gryffindors seemed to be following their lead, which led to a much calmer class in that way as well.
“yes, this is clearly the work of a black quill and your hand would be more than enough proof to get Professor Umbridge removed from the castle. There may also be additional legal consequences. If you wish for us to do so Harry”
Draco let out a small chuckle once Snape was out of earshot, “It’s weird isn’t in when he gets all teachery like that. I had spent so much time with him as my ‘Uncle Sev’ growing up that I nearly cried after my first potions class, I didn’t know he could be so mean.”
“Room now boy!” Harry didn’t waste time as he rushed up to his bedroom, he didn’t miss hearing what Aunt Petunia was saying.
Harry took one last glance at the classroom before nodding, he knew Snape was looking out for him now but he supposed that wouldn’t apply to missed classes. Draco has insisted it would be okay though and Harry was inclined to believe him.
Everything went perfectly after that, he made it to his room without detection and sent the broom back to where he had found it. Harry even managed to doze off for a little while before Petunia unlocked the door and ordered him down to make breakfast that morning.
“No - I didn’t mean you I meant that class if this is what the  whole semester is going to be like we won’t learn a thing.” Draco clarified and continued, “Weasley nearly flew out of his chair, but Granger held him back, a damn good thing too because I swear I’m seconds away from hexing him and any other stupid weasels that get in my way.” he was practically spitting and Harry almost defended his ex-best friends out of habit but found that he didn’t want to - he agreed.
“Yes!” he called out quietly and pulled a small package of Every Flavor Beans out of the break in the floor where he was able to hide a few of his items before the Dursleys locked away his school things. His wand, the invisibility cloak, a roll of parchment, and a self-filling quill, any food he could get a hold of that wouldn’t rot, and a few of his lighter school books.
“That’s a detention Mr. Potter, tonight at 8 pm in my office.” She scolded and then turned to the rest of the class and started her lesson.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter,  if you could please stand while I ask you some more questions about the incident I promise to keep this as brief as possible.” Amelia smiled kindly as Harry stood
He checked Snape’s office schedule and saw that the professor should be back any minute, so Harry started toward the dorm hall as Draco called out.
“Someone who has always been punished for being better than the people around them,” Harry spoke grimly and stood to go change
Sirius and Remus got to the shack about an hour earlier, they wanted to limit the number of people around when they showed up and figured arriving at the same time as all the Hogwarts students would be the worst way to do that.
“No ma’am, I lost count somewhere around 17...I couldn’t focus on counting anymore; it hurt a lot. I’d wager it was about 30 or 40. I’m sorry, I’m not sure.” Harry felt a little guilty for not knowing the answer but Rue didn’t seem to mind at all.
“I’ve always had some, but they’ve been a constant, every night actually,  since the graveyard and they’re worse now.” Harry shook a little as he spoke,
I went back to work this week and I'm starting a second job soon, basically, my schedule is really cramped and I'm gonna try and keep to this posting schedule but it might drop to 2 updates a week sometimes. I'm sorry
“It would be best if you took it right after you finish your meal, gives it more time to fully absorb. Now off you go.” Snape called waving Harry out the door.
“Sirius!” Harry spoke softly but excitement rang through his voice, he was worried he would never hear from the man again.
“No ma’am, it only happened once.” Harry had to force himself to stand up straight and hold eye contact with Amelia Bones.
“Fine, he just told me not to make a habit out of it.” and Harry began to make a plate that had enough food on it to please Madame Pomfrey.
“Well?” Pansy questioned, being fully drawn away from her runes homework at the mention of something weird.
“For sleeping or for….???” Remus questioned, knowing that neither he nor Sirius would be sleeping tonight after such an emotionally driven discussion. Too many hormones
, Remus. What could have happened, it had to be truly horrible to awake the oldest and most powerful magic in the castle. How can I subject him to go back to it? I can’t do it, Rem. I can’t” A tear fell down his face,
“I’m sorry. It was an accident, I’m sorry.” He tensed up again. Not only had he lost the item that was giving him some relief but he had probably upset his professor.
“Blasted broom, though it was my own. Picked it up and the bloody thing shot straight across the room.” Petunia huffed as she tried to shove the firebolt into Harry’s old cupboard.
“I’m sorry dear but it looks like I’ll need a small sample of blood for a couple more tests. Let me see your pointer finger on your non-wand hand.” Harry complied holding out his left hand. He felt a small prick and watched as three small drops of his blood fell into a vial and then watched Madame Pomfrey slip out again.
“He gave me the report paperwork for you to sign which you can do now, with me as an acting witness. The court has agreed to hear the case, as well as the governor’s board.” Snape’s words eased some of Harry’s nerves but they also left him with questions,
Harry pulled back his left robe sleeve and held out his hand for Professor Dumbledore to see, it was far more stable this time not shaking nearly as much as it had when he showed Snape his hand the night before.
“Potter let’s go, your new house is waiting to welcome you over breakfast,” Draco spoke in a tone Harry had never heard directed at him before. Draco sounded happy.
The rest of the day went exactly as it should, they went to Transferigration than lunch and Astronomy at the end of the day the Slytherins headed back to their dormitory, deciding to study in the common room and not the library.
Harry and Draco anxious walked into the shack, Draco has always avoided the building and the last memory Harry had from inside was less than pleasant.
Harry was shaking with nerves as he sat by himself outside of ministry room 117. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape had been inside for at least 20 minutes, but Harry hadn’t been called in yet. He had been beyond relieved when he found out that his trial wasn’t taking place in front of the entire Wizengamot - Draco had told him about the massive courtroom with all of the oldest and most noble wizarding families and the thought of speaking to all of them terrified Harry. Instead, his trial was being held in a much smaller room; today Harry, Snape, and Dumbledore had to present the case to Amelia Bones. Bones would then take her findings to a small board of magical law enforcers who would make a final decision.
Snape placed the weighted blanket on Harry’sshoulders and slowly made his way back around to face his student. “Do you need me to help wrap it around you?” he asked
“Ugh, you deserve the world, Harry Potter.” Pansy kissed Harry’s cheek, a habit she had with all her friends; Harry was starting to enjoy the friendly touches from his friends. He has never experienced casual, kind touch; his old Gryffindor friends would hug him whenever he survived something he shouldn’t have or after long summers apart, but never much more than that. All touch at the Dursley’s was bad. Pansy’s kisses were welcome and cherished, Dracos hugs were longed for and melted into, Harry was the luckiest kid in this whole damn school.
Harry set off for the gas station as he racked his brain thinking up a plan. There was no point going back now,  even if he couldn’t get back in he was out so he might as well make the most of it. Harry stayed under his cloak as he walked throughout Little Whining, he wasn’t looking for any trouble muggle or magical. It took about 10 minutes for Harry to find an open shop, he took off the cloak and put it in his bag before entering the store.
Harry swiftly made his way from the office to find Draco and ask him for help picking out the nice robes
“Very well then Mr. Potter let’s get to it.” Amelia smiled widely then shuffled some papers around before she started to read the report aloud,
A silence filled the room and like that it was over, Snape ordered everyone to their seats and he began to lecture the class about the years’ syllabus and expectations. Harry found himself excited for the class this year, knowing he could allow his grades to rise some as they worked on some pretty complex potions.
“The castle would not have requested this exam if all were in order Severus, I’m not sure what to expect but I am not optimistic.” The stout which spoke calmly reading results as they came in. Her face fell and contorted as she read which Severus knew was a bad sign, she tusked and opened the curtains.
“Very well, have a seat for just a moment and I’ll look over it.” Snape walked the potion back to the cauldron they had been working out as they took a seat closer to the professor’s desk. It took about 3 minutes for the Potions Master to return.
Draco stood tall and extended his hand, “Draco,” he hesitated, “Draco Malfoy.” Draco normally said his name with pride and confidence, but he knew from stories his mother had told that Sirius Balck wasn’t a big fan of the Malfoys. Or any of the old pure-blood families for that matter.
Harry was grateful that he hadn’t tried sneaking out when he heard the Dursleys return less than an hour later. He just had to make it until this evening - then he could get out of this bloody room.
“Well you do have Lily’s eyes, but you also have her intelligence, Mr. Potter - now that I’m your head of house I can see all your marks and you perform exceptionally in Defense, and while I never would have admitted this before you show a lot of promise in my class - it’s almost like you’re intentionally holding yourself back, which we can discuss at a later date if necessary. I would also be happy to tell you more about your mother, however, I’m afraid it will have to wait as I have another class to get back to.”
Pansy showed the guys how to get into the room of requirement, and to everyone’s amazement it was perfectly set up for practical magic practice.
With 3 minutes left until class was set to start and Professor Snape would arrive Ron Weasley approached the table Harry and Draco were sitting at, flanked by Granger and Longbottom.
“If you don’t have any questions you may return to your dorm, I do not know when Mr. Potter will be arriving but it will be tonight so be prepared for his arrival at some point this evening.” the boys looked between each other for a short moment before standing and leaving as if they had just had any other meeting.
“As someone in my position, I am here to make sure all the students in my house are safe and well. Mr. Potter is not right now so I plan on fulfilling my duty and seeing to it that he is cared for. Good day,  Albus, come on Harry we’re running late.” Snape outstretched his arm to lead Harry from the office. Harry took his arm in hand eagerly, he felt like his body was moving on auto-pilot and the anxiety inside him kept growing.
The sight of his cloak gave him an idea, he could sneak out the window that night, Vernon hadn’t replaced the bars after the second year so as long as he was invisible all Harry needed to do was aim for the bushes. He could get out and spend some proper time with his owl, he could even send more letters to Remus, Hermione, and Hagrid hopefully someone could help him get to Diagon Ally - he received his letter two weeks ago, which meant it was mid-August already and he’s only got a few more weeks to get his things for the year. If he couldn’t get there soon he’d have to ask the Dursleys to drop him off in Muggle London the day before so he could get his shopping down and spend the night at the Leaky Coldurin.
. Maybe this was all honest, maybe Draco meant it all...maybe there was a future for the pair of them? Even if there was, Harry couldn’t bring himself to respond to that instead, he changed the topic,
“Well we better get off, we need to stop by the dorm and grab our books now if we want to get the best seats in Snape’s class,” Parkinson called, already standing and straightening her robes. The group of fifth years all hastily joined her, making snide marks about the fact that the Gryffindors weren’t going to be punctual enough for it to make a difference.
Severus Snape was lost in thought sitting at the teacher’s table for breakfast in the great hall. He was not looking forward to the meeting he would be attending this morning. He knew Albus was going to try and pull something and his newest student had been through enough this week with his headmaster making matter worse.
“You’re right, we probably should get some sleep before the morning.” Harry wanted to stop himself but couldn’t, “but I won’t get scared off Draco, I’m brave. Did you forget I was a lion for many years, they beat bravery into you up there.” He thought he was joking, but Draco didn’t find it very funny.
Amelia and Severus were just as shaken by the jarring offer; there was a thick silence in the room as all three occupants stared at the door that was still swinging closed.
And at that moment Snape strode into the classroom, It took him a fraction of a second in the classroom before he intervened.
“I didn’t cheat...I just studied, and - and worked harder..” Harry muttered out in a much softer voice
Sirius Black read the letter over three times before he was able to set it down. He didn’t entirely believe Dumbledore when he said there hadn’t been an issue worthy of awaking the founders’ magic, he knew that the Headmaster had a nasty habit of bending the truth. Sirius was far more considered that his godson had wound up in Slytherin with his childhood nemesis looking over him. Sirius also knew how much Harry’s friends meant to him and wondered why they hadn’t already tried to get Harry back to Gryffindor. He could understand why Harry hadn’t spoken with Dumbledore about the situation - he just didn’t have a clue why he wouldn’t have gone to his friends?
“I don’t understand, my best friends need some space from me. Neville let me talk to Ron and Hermione, I don’t think they’ve been getting my letters this summer.” Harry demanded
“How the bloody hell could two people with so much wisdom and intelligence be so daft?” He wondered out loud after reading what the other professors had to say about the situation. How was it not clear to them that this was neither reversible nor a mistake.
Harry felt a tear building up in the center of his eye as Draco spoke, but it didn’t make it far because when it fell Draco reached up and wiped it away. Harry looked to Draco, he was so touch-starved and so emotionally drained Harry had been longing for someone to hug him or hold him since his interaction with Neville on the train and suddenly he very much wanted that someone to be Draco.
“No of course not, what would you possibly need to do actual magic for?” The pink-clad toadish professor asked
“Of course not, but I’m a rubbish seeker and you are the best one this school has ever seen. Lucky I’m an excellent chaser and now that Graham is gone there’s a chaser spot open so
“I have received word that we will be gaining another student tonight, some very old school magic made itself known this evening, and a student is being transferred into our house. I do not have many details, as such I don’t know what led this magic to the decision that this student needs to be moved, all I know is that it is happening tonight and it cannot be undone. So we will be welcoming this student in, it may be a challenge but this magic would not have been activated if it were not necessary. Understand?” the professor asked. Urquhart was shocked but nodded in agreement allowing his professor to continue.
. Harry wanted to point out that a lot of them would likely already be enemies if they support Voldemort, but he kept it to himself.
yet, but right I guess. It feels like I’m meant to be here.” Harry shuddered out and he was worried the others would start laughing at him, but no one did. Instead, he was meet with very encouraging responses.
Harry sorted through his things and packed his truck - Hedwig was there and she still had no letters for him.
Breakfast was also far more pleasant for the Slytherins today than it had been the day before, the Gryffindors were keeping to themselves and no one had asked how or why Harry and Draco woke up in the same bed, so Harry was counting this as a win.
“They always just wanted to protect you, to keep you happy and safe. That’s what we want too.” Remus added kindly “Are you, Harry. Do you feel happy and safe?” he asked,
Harry went rigid with fear, his voice was too much like Aunt Petunia before she sent a firm wack with a frying pan.
“Please, Please, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please don’t hurt me.” Harry cried as he begged -  Draco allowed himself no more than 3 seconds to be overwhelmed,
“Yes, of course, I’m staying. Now go to sleep” Draco smiled and gently placed Harry’s face back on the pillow before doing the same himself.
“I’m not at liberty to discuss a student’s personal life without his consent. Excuse me, Minerva, I have a meeting to attend.”
“Harry, it’s okay; you’re safe,” Draco spoke gently not knowing what else to do. He had noticed the crumpled mess in Harry’s hand, but when he looked closer he could see the grade stick out. “Did you get a perfect mark?” Draco spoke with a bit more excitement. He was hoping it would lighten the mood a little.
“That’s alright Mr. Potter, I think I’ve got enough information to take to the legal team. Why don’t you sit down.”
He hadn’t even realized he had left his dorm room when he felt his back collide against a cool leather sofa. Harry pried his eyes open, and when he saw where he was, Harry wanted to close them again - this must be a dream. He was in the Slytherin common room, he recognized it from the undercover trip he took with Ron second year.
Harry flinched at the loud noise but still let out a sigh, he was exhausted and he was pretty sure Vernon had cracked a rib, but at least he was alone and out of that dream.
“That is all correct Madam Bones,” Harry eventually spoke up after he received a slight nudge of his food under the table from his professor.
“Brillant Harry, somehow you managed to get Lily’s brain and James’s agility...absolutely brilliant.” Sirius smiled with pride
By the time the group had to leave to make it back before curfew no one had been successful, Blaise had managed a few silver whisps but that was it.
“Thank you, Professor, I got a memo for myself saying I would need to see Mr. Potter today. Right, this way Harry dear, just sit on the bed I’ll run the diagnostic charm shouldn’t take long. I’ll have to discuss anything unusual I find with your head of house because you don’t have a magical medical proxy listed. That’s it just sit, you’ll hardly even notice the magic.” Madame Pomfrey was happier than usual today, possibly because Harry had come here with all his bones this time.
and Draco suddenly felt way out of his depths. Unlike Harry’s old, proud Gryffindor friends who would have tried
“Mr. Potter, performing well in a class isn’t something you do to draw attention to yourself. With the way you had been working previously, it is highly unlikely you could have scored well enough on your OWL’s to continue onto sixth-year potions. I would like to know what led you to believe that performing well is such a problem, and if you would prefer to do so privately we can go to my office.” Snape was getting that feeling that this conversation was not going to have a happy ending again.
Harry felt his gut sink like a stone, he knew with all these tests she must know something is wrong with him, which meant he would have to have a very uncomfortable conversation soon.
When they were dismissed from class everyone made their way to the great hall for lunch, relishing in the fact that the rest of the afternoon was free sailing. Snape and Flitwick had given homework but Harry was confident he could complete all his work in an hour so he wasn’t in a rush to get started.
“Come on,” Draco quickly ushed the group into an empty classroom across the hall so they could have a bit of privacy.
“Your mother most certainly would have done that and so much more for you Mr. Potter. Lily Evans was one of the greatest women I have ever known, and now you have people who will help you as she would have. Do not hide from us Harry, if you have a problem you can come to me, and I’ve seen how close you’re becoming with Mr. Malfoy and his companions they will look out for you too and not just from trouble out in the castle, but for your emotional needs as well - lots of them know how it feels to suffer in such a way first hand and they would not be apt to leave a friend to suffer that fate alone. Do you understand?” Snape felt like a broken record telling this boy that he would be cared for now but he vowed to himself that he would keep saying it until Harry believed him.
“I do Sir, thank you….you knew my mom?” Harry asked desperately always longing to know more about his parents its part of the reason why he kept trying to build a relationship with Sirius and Remus. Part of him worried that if he pushed Snape too much for information about his mother the professor would distance himself as his uncles had done. It was worth the risk though if he got to hear even one new story about her.
“Not that I have any doubts about what caused this, but I will need you to confirm that this was the work of a blood quill Mr. Potter” Snape spoke after carefully looking it over.
The Slytherins made their way into the potions classroom 10 minutes early, there wasn’t a Gryffindor insight so they claimed the right side of the room and partnered up. For a moment Harry panicked, who was going to be his potions partner.
mostly Wolfstar, a little Drarry, and Pansy friendship moments. Getting to learn a bit more about the magic the Founding Four left behind.
“I would rather not take this to the headmaster given his response to recent events, Mr. Potter, but I’m not sure if we have another choice.” The students could see Snape thinking trying to work out the problem.
“Merlin, are all your stories like that?” Draco was trying not to laugh and you could hear the smile in his voice.
“You’ve never gotten a perfect mark on an exam! You must’ve cheated. Professor!” her shrill voice echoed through the classroom and it made Harry subtlety flinched away from her.
“Could I keep using your blanket a while longer, Sir?” Harry asked with the edges of anxiety seeping into every word. He didn’t want Snape to leave if it meant taking the blanket with him, he felt safer in it. Like Pansy’s gentle hand squeeze but all over his body.
The final founder Salzar Slytherin used the most advanced magic to create a system that could detect when a student had been abandoned or betrayed. With some reluctant help from Godric Gryffindor, he was able to make a magical connection between his piece of the core and the sorting hat; if this magic was ever called on a student would be placed somewhere they wouldn’t have to experience that loss again. Slytherin wanted to assure his magic was only called on when it was absolutely necessary, he knew it was powerful and didn’t want the power to be abused. Salazar made it so the core would only be activated when the betrayed student accepted themself that they had been abandoned
“Bloody course you’re still playing Potter, you could give us a shot to win back that House Cup you always manage to steal away. Come on, let’s get this rubbish class out of the way.” Draco joked
Harry wasn’t at Hogwarts he was at Privet Drive but that couldn’t be right, he had gone left for Hogwarts already - hadn’t he? He remembered being on the train and going to the feasts but something was wrong.
, how had he ruined another relationship. His hands shook and he couldn’t even bring himself to apologize as he had a looming fear that he would be cut off and disregarded, again.
“Mr. Rackharrow, a word.” the professor spoke as soon as he located the student before reentering his office and leaving the door agape behind him.
Despite his anger at having just been scared Sirius made his way around the room and collapsed into his boyfriend’s arms, “ ‘m so glad you’re back Moony.” he mumbled into the man’s chest.
“Watch your tongue. Do not interrupt. This is exactly the kind of behavior that will not be tolerated at all. I have eyes everywhere Mr. Malfoy, if I get word that Mr. Potter is not being given the same respect that we give to all other Slytherins there will be consequences. He is a Slytherin now, you’d do well to remember the first rule of this noble house Draco.” Snape practically spat
“Did you think that you - the great Potter was immune to magical dangers!” Snape wanted to take back the words the moment he heard them, things were different now it was his job to protect Harry, after he was abandoned by everyone else, and here he was snapping into the evil teacher role that he used to scare any student into place.
“I got them at the potions shop students are instructed to get their supplies at on Diagon Alley, Sir, I used one the night before term started, then another after the welcome feast when I got back to Gryffindor Tower, and a third once I was settled in my new bed in the middle of the night. That’s all I’ve had Sir,” Harry’s voice shook slightly but he remained calm.
Harry was a little confused by the friendliness that had been shown to him in this last hour, not only by Professor Snape but now Draco Malfoy. The pair shook hands and greeted each other with their first names, something that hadn’t happened since they met in Madam Malkins.
“No - no or I guess I don’t think so. It sounded more like he was worried about me because it had happened at all, not because it sorted me into Slytherin. Although I know he’s not been very fond of Slytherins in the past. Maybe I shouldn’t get my hopes up.” So as he spoke Harry started preparing himself for a meeting where his godfather was upset with him.
“Dinky, I need you to bring me a glass of water for Mr. Potter, and A special blanket from my quarters. I keep it on the bottom shelf of the bedside table. And please bring them to the hallway, loud noise may not be the best at the moment.” He spoke softly
“Harry, I think it’s time we head back to school. If we leave now I can get you back in time for supper. Thank you Madam Bones.” Harry and Snape both bowed their heads to Amelia before walking out and heading to the apparition point.
“That’s not a super-duper healthy way to handle things, mate. What do you think the mind herald would have to say about that way of thinking?” Remus knew he’d probably push a few buttons but he wanted his partner to see how ridiculous he was being.
“Merlin, that could have been bad. Thanks, mate.” Draco placed his free hand on Harry’s shoulder and a gesture of thanks as they waited a minute longer for the flames to settle, adding hellebore to an open flame could have been enough to make Snape take back his previous statement about trusting them.
“The valerian levels in his blood are elevated much too high, what has he been taking,” Snape spoke as he scanned the list of substances found in his blood looking for something that made sense.
Harry was relieved that he wouldn’t have to stay in medical, especially with everything else going on, he was less thrilled with the knowledge that they had more to discuss before he could leave.
Harry felt himself spring into action the moment he saw his old friends reaching for their wands as if he had been snapped out of a trance, there were too many of them for a stunning or disarming spell to be useful so Harry opted for defense instead.
“I told her we’d have to defend ourselves against Voldemort...she didn’t like that, she told everyone I was lying about him coming back. So I lashed out a little. I just got so mad because I know- more than anyone how badly we need to know defense. I know I should have kept to myself, but I just couldn't. I'm a lot of things Madam Bones, but I'm not a liar. ” Harry was getting frustrated and overwhelmed, he wanted nothing more than to be in the common room disastrously losing to Draco at chess. “I told her that I was yelling - I’ll admit that. I just - he’s back, I saw him! I watched him...he did awful things. He tortured me and he killed -” Harry’s breath hitched, he hated saying Percy’s name out loud.
“Ah, don’t worry too much - he’ll have a talk about it but he’s not nearly as harsh on detentions or, points lost as he is about failing marks,” Pansy assured and Harry saw many of his other classmates nodding in agreement.
The room was only silent for a moment before Sirius gently cradled Harry’s hand in his own, “She’ll go down for this Harry, properly. She has to.” his voice was barely above a whisper.
On Sunday evening after dinner but before sunset Draco and Harry put on their jackets and headed out for a walk around the great lake. Draco was given a chance to learn some more about Harry’s life while they were out there.
“Sit, you are not in trouble however there is an urgent and important matter for us to discuss,” Snape spoke swiftly to the anxious-looking students who all quickly followed his instruction.
Draco just sat there and rubbed patterns into Harry’s back as he cried, his heart was breaking for the newest Slytherin but he couldn’t help but smile at how perfect Harry fit in his arms. He could get used to cuddling with Harry Potter.
“Someone must have been intersecting them. Otherwise, Hedwig would have brought them back to Harry and he’d know we never got them. Someone wanted him to think we were ignoring him.” Sirius slammed his fist on the counter, “Damn it all!”
that this student is treated as any other snake. We protect our own, and as of tonight, he is one of our own. Am I understood?” The room was filled with silent motions of approval as Severus spoke up again.
“We can talk more about it tomorrow but I know how much you enjoy it and frankly we could use the talent if you’re willing to play.” Harry almost saw Snape smile and he was grinning at the idea of being a broom again.
“Unless  you’ve invented a clothes-changing charm that I don’t know about I don’t think it’s possible for you to be changing robes right now.” Pansy joked without looking up from her book. Draco gave out a short yet loud chuckle from the other end of the couch.
“No, you can’t tell him. Please don’t tell him. Please, he’ll - he’ll.” Harry let out a loud whimper. Draco kept glancing at the door waiting for Snape to come through it.
Harry slowly removed his robes and his shirt, leaving him bare from the waist up. Poppy and Severus were hardly able to hold back their shocked gasps at the sight of his torso, littered in bruises old and knew many of which were very obviously boot marks. When he was instructed to turn around the sight of his back was possibly worse. A Jacobs ladder of scars and welts and cuts crisscrossing over the boy’s back from the bottom of his neck to right under his waste line.  Poppy noted two fairly large cuts that would need to be tended to, everything else could heal itself.
Uncle Sev was one of the best things in my childhood. When I was really little my parents went away for 2 weeks one summer and I stayed with him while they were gone. I had such a great time they sent me there every year, even if they weren’t going away. This past summer was the first time I can remember not spending any time at Spinners End.” Draco sighed a little as he realized he might not get to spend another summer with his godfather; now that the Dark Lord was back Lucius was worse than ever. Harry noticed that his friend was dealing with something so he let the moment of silence sink in before and didn’t say anything until Draco continued,
“Thank you, Professor, I never get a say in things like this.” Harry blushed but at least his anxiety was dissipating.
“My diagnostic spell shows a lot of bruising and scarring that appears to have been there for several years. Is this true?” The healer asked and Harry simply nodded a response, unable to look at either of the adults.
“Of course, keep it as long as you need. Just call a house-elf to return it to my room when you’re ready. I’m sure one of you three can cast a lightweight charm to transport it back to the common room?” Snape asked
“Why do you wear clothes that fit so poorly? That jacket can hardly be keeping you warm with how much of it is hanging off of you.” Draco had asked when he noticed Harry shiver through a cold breeze that passed through them.
“I didn’t think it was a big deal,” Harry answered honestly and finally chanced a lookup to his professor. Severus was giving his student a very stern look but he didn’t say anything. It wasn’t worth causing a scene when they were so close to leaving.
As if on cue Vernon shoved the door open sending it crashing into the plastered wall, shaking the curtains, and the closet door.
“I bought it in a muggle shop a few years ago. They call it a weighted blanket, it’s made to help with anxiety and over-stimulation and the stress they cause. It has been of use to me several times over the years. It helped?” Snape inquired
Before Harry could process those words, while still convulsing in pain from the last curse he heard the bone-chilling whistle of a slim wooden cane and then felt the stinging pain the punishing device left on his bareback.
He stood and faced Harry who was still sitting on the table and he lifted the lighter boy into his arms before lowing them both to a sitting position on the floor with his back to the wall. Draco spread his legs apart and pulled Harry in between them so the smaller boy could rest with his back to Draco’s chest - this position also allowed Harry to turn his head into Draco’s body where it could slip right next to his shoulder.
“You disappear without a word. Abandon your house, abandon the order and the light side so you can shack up with some dirty snakes!” Harry had never heard venom like this in Ron’s voice, it was honestly a little startling.
“I’ve got a bad feeling about all of this girl.” He spoke to the bird as he applied the salve he had bought to his more prominent bruises. Hedwig hooted softly in response, nipping gently at Harry’s ear. The pair spent the next hour just chatting, Harry pet her and spoiled her with the mice treats he bought at the owl emporium. When the magical alarm notified him that with his current wake-up time set he should be asleep within the next 30 minutes if he wanted to gain an adequate amount of sleep.
His watch told Severus that Harry would be arriving in less than five minutes, so he made his way to the common room to meet with his newest snake.
When Draco noticed Harry’s change in body language he realized what he had done and what Harry must be thinking, “Oh no, Harry love I’m not upset with you at all. I’m furious with the muggles who raised you, and I’m using every bit of self-control to keep myself from hexing all of those damn Gryffindors for not feeling the same. Everyone deserves to be cared for, and the fact that you haven’t been is not your fault Harry - and I am going to do everything in my power to make you believe it as well”
This was going to be much more challenging than Severus was expected, what in Merlin’s name happened to Potter, and why on earth did that bloody hat think he belonged in Slytherin. Snape only allowed himself a moment with his hard thoughts, for as difficult as it was he understood that Potter was one of his snakes now and he would be treated as such. It was his job to make sure the rest of the house was just as clear on that as he was...
“Harry, you’re safe at Hogwarts. No one will hurt you here.” Snape spoke softly as he tried to figure out his next step. He didn’t want to touch Harry unless it was necessary. There was a possibility it would work and pull Harry out of his trance however, it was far more likely that he would just become more upset.
“There has been a change in my schedule, I need to be to Kings Cross on August 31st this year, not September 1st.” Harry paused waiting for a response.
“So boys, tell me about the new defense teacher. Does she do as good a job as me?” Remus was joking but the somber tone that filled the room told him that he maybe shouldn’t have been.
With his snacks paid for and his body hidden by the magic of the invisibility cloak once again, Harry wandered until he found a park that he used to go to as a kid. He never played there because his days at the park were always spent hiding and running from his bigger cousin Dudley, but at least he knew his way around well.
Harry paused like he was thinking, but he knew the answer - of course, Ron, Hermione, most of the Weasleys, his old dormmates, and even Hagrid had all been rather harsh or upset with him after a nightmare at least once. Honestly, Harry didn’t blame them he knew the screaming and thrashing must be annoying, other people shouldn’t have to lose sleep just because Harry was, however, something told him that his professor would not be too happy with that declaration. Harry  settled on saying,
“Again, there is no need to express extreme gratitude for me showing you basic human decency, but now I truly must get going.” Snape stood again and Harry followed him towards the door, “Enjoy your evening Mr. Potter, and when you have a chance ask Mr. Malfoy to take you to speak with Graham Montague about quidditch tryouts.” with that statement, Severus swiftly left the Slytherin common room and headed towards the potions classroom.
“I am going to assume that you feel comfortable speaking here, if that is not the case just say so and we can move to my office.” if it weren’t for the current circumstance Snape would have been annoyed that a student didn’t answer a direct question, but he went on,
“It’s n-nothing” Harry couldn’t stop Draco as he quickly reached out and grabbed his arm, Harry flinched drastically at the sudden touch, Pansy noticed and it helped to confirmed what she and Draco assumed about the starvation only being a part of what the muggles did to Harry, but Draco didn’t notice he was trying to process what he was seeing.
Sirius was so excited to see Harry that it took him several moments to notice the other person in the room.
Sirius had tears freely running down his face and Remus wanted to hold the man as tightly as he could, but he knew he should wait for Sirius to initiate the contact.
wong but I didn’t want to overstep. Albus had warned me not to and with Severus watching me so closely to make sure I didn’t wolf out on any students I couldn’t risk it.” Remus’ calm tone did little to ease the tension in the room,
Harry spent the whole period thankful that at least he wouldn’t miss quidditch try-outs but also horribly worried about how his house would react. He didn’t catch a word of the lesson.
Snape obviously already knew this but took the offering none-the-less, he looked over it and smiled, “Very well Mr. Potter, your new study habits are paying off. Congratulations. Now, if you have a minute I have something we need to discuss briefly.”
“Thank you, Professor.” He muttered before swiftly grabbing his belongings and scurrying out of the office and down to his common room, his hand was throbbing and Harry had no idea what to do next.
“Harry, please sit.” Snape took a deep breath and Harry could almost feel the remorse and desperation in his professors’ voice, something jarringly out of character.
“Thank you both, for handling this difficult and confusing situation so maturely. Mr. Potter, I am very glad to have you join our Slytherin family, you seem to be fitting right in. Mr. Malfoy thank you for welcoming him, I know your classmates took notice and it appears they are all following suit - I’m glad, I expect things to stay this way.” He warned before continuing, “any other issues I need to be aware of, do Mr. Weasley’s comments need to be further addressed?”
"you had a school-boy rivalry it doesn't define you. Plus, I know you just ran with it to cover up your crush." Pansy spoke with a cheeky smiled laced on every word
cw: Umbridge being Umbridge, some mild language (which will be showing up more frequently and I will probably not put cw for again)
“Alright Mr. Potter, first I just need you to confirm that this was an isolated occurrence. Have there been any other times you’ve been made to use a Black Quill, either before or after the incident from this report?”
Sirius Balck was sitting alone in the kitchen of number 12 Grimmauld Place; he had been lost in thought for so long his morning coffee had gone cold. He kept drinking it. Sirius hated being back at his childhood home and did his best to avoid as much of it as possible - he and Remus slept in an old guest room, the only other rooms he entered were: the bathroom, kitchen, and study.
Harry was so exhausted when he and Draco made it back to their dorm that he changed and went straight to bed Draco stayed up for a while, thinking about and analyzing the events of that evening.
Clutching his cheek Ron drew his wand. “Oh, you’ll regret that. You’ll both regret that.” Ron grinned devilishly and he, Hermione, Neville, and a hand full of other Gryffindors all sent hexes towards the Slytherins at the same time.
Again Draco considered cursing his best friend but stopped as he heard the common room door open, he turned to see who it was. It was harry and Draco became filled with concern at his distressed stance and the obvious look of pain on his face.
“Harry, we’ve got to go soon.” Draco turned to Harry as he spoke, they had been there for nearly an hour. Pansy, Blaise, and Theo told them they would all meet at Honeydukes an hour into the trip.
“I’m ready now Ma’am” Harry’s voice was still soft but it was much clearer now, especially when he looked up to properly address the women. He wasn’t sure how much Draco’s tips would matter now that he had a meltdown in the courtroom, but he figured he should keep it up, just in case.
“Harry!” Sirius called excitedly making his way across the room the moment he had transformed back from Padfoot. He scooped his godson into his arms and held him tightly. Harry flinched at first but quickly relaxed.
Draco was ready to rush to the boy’s side the minute Severus said he was upset but he liked knowing how much his god-father cared even if he couldn’t show it as much while at school.
“Mrs. Granger, I have the book you requested. It’s somewhere around here.” Flitwick silently cast a location finding charm and turned to Harry,
After she had finished brewing her potion and was excused from class Pansy Parkinson rushed through the dungeon to the Slytherin House entrance where she hoped to find her best friend and her newest friend who had both been mysteriously gone from class without any comment from them our Professor Snape.
“You let us know if anyone gives you any trouble Potter.”  followed instantly by, “Especially those Gryffindor scum.” Crabbe and Goyle spoke together, finishing each other’s sentences
Dumbledore completely ignored the older man and turned his attention back to Harry, speaking with more urgency, “That may not be true Harry, as I said this is ancient magic and we don’t fully understand how it works. I have been working to find a way to get you back in Gryffindor where you belong.”
Harry paused, trying to decide how honest to be; figuring the news of the court case would probably be fairly public he opted to tell the whole story.
Harry could feel that something was off, he had been jolted awake and he couldn’t figure out why, he didn’t remember having a bad dream and he wasn’t shaking or sweaty, he had taken the sleep potion this shouldn’t be happening. There was nothing wrong with the room, everyone was in bed with their curtains drawn. There was one empty bed but it was Seamus’, and he was likey cuddled up in Deans.
From Helga Hufflepuff, when a student was sick, hurt, or undernourished her magic would inform the acting Headmaster of the situation and work to help bring all students up to full health. Helga believed there was no reason to leave children to suffer when they didn’t have to. She used her power to assure even when she had gone that no student in any house would have to go unnoticed.
When Harry saw the trio his stomach felt as if it had been filled with lead and flipped all over at the same time. He didn’t want to fight, he was exhausted, and he was hurt because his two best friends had adjusted to life without him so easily, and he was confused about how happy he was in Slytherin, and he was especially confused by his influx of feelings about Draco Malfoy. Basically, Harry would rather do almost anything else, but that was not looking like an option.
The day flew by and Harry felt weighed down by all his assigned work at the end of it. As Harry entered his common room he remembered that his first Quidditch practice of the year was tonight so all of that work would have to wait until late tonight.
“You’re not any trouble Harry, I’m really glad you’re okay.” the relief was evident in Draco’s voice. Harry looked embarrassed, but he didn’t try and argue - he was very tired.
“The sorting hat has a direct connection to the magical core, it decided where you would go. Now, Mr. Potter if you are worried about how you will be treated here you don’t need to. Our house faces many struggles outside these walls from people who don’t understand what we’re really like, because of that we have one rule here that stands above all the rest. The number one rule of Slytherin is that we look out for our own, we stick together, and we don’t leave anyone behind. You are a snake now Harry and you will be treated like one by every single person in this house. Your new dorm mates - Mr. Zabini, Mr. Nott, and Mr. Malfoy - have already been informed that you are coming and they know that you are one of us and will be treated how we treat family. If you have any problems with this you are to come directly to me and it will be handled. The rest of the house will receive memos in the morning telling them the same thing.” As Professor Snape spoke Harry found himself believing all of it, to him it made sense, and now looking back he had noticed how close the Slytherins always are he had never paid attention before but he couldn’t remember a single time where he saw someone from Slytherin by themselves in the castle.
“Yes, I can handle the stirring Draco. I know how it’s done, I may not be top of the class - not that I’d even want to be - but I can manage myself in front of a cauldron. I know there have been some disasters in the past but I’ve always had Ron as a partner and he hated this class acted like it was a joke. Of course, I could never get anything done well” Harry had a defensive tone to his voice but held back his anger.
Harry knew there was no way to fight this so he uncovered his left hand and held it out, as it shook violently, for his professor to see.
“Yeah, it helped loads. Thank you for letting me use it, Dinky brought it back to your room.” Harry eagerly responded
Draco casts a cooling charm when Harry was finished adding the hellebore and he bottled what they had made. The team exchanged friendly high-fives before approaching Snape’s desk.
The next morning Harry had some toast and coffee that Tom had brought for him, the young wizard thanked him and paid for his stay before grabbing his things and taking the floo to platform  9¾.
“So tell him that, send a letter, or floo him and tell him that. Harry should be in Hogsmeade next weekend, we can all meet up in Three Broomsticks.” Remus supplied
Harry changed his robes and cast a quick cleansing charm on himself then hurried off to Umbridge’s office, he had less than 10 minutes before his detention.
Harry worked harder than he ever had before in all of his classes, he knew the seriousness of Snape’s threat to an academic meeting. His first opportunity to prove himself would come on Wednesday when he took his first test of the year; Professor Flitwick announced that the fifth years had a review exam of all the charms they had previously learned that were a part of their O.W.Ls.
Harry didn’t understand why Dumbledore didn’t find it imperative to take legal action as Snape had, sure Harry wanted to avoid any more attention on him but he also knew that Umbridge should be stopped.
“We need to talk to Harry Pads, we don’t know anything about what happened. You said it yourself Harry is what’s most important. Let’s wait and see what he has to say, and when we get home later and you have all the outbursts you’d like.” Remus led them both back to the bench he had just abandoned and he pulled Sirius into his side protectively as they waited.
“I - I hate that he’s in Slytherin, I hate that he’s under Snivellus care, and I hate that I know James would feel the same...but I think he needs to stay there Remus. I think whatever happened put Harry in danger, and if it didn’t it left him hurt. So if he’s safe and happy now - I can’t take that away from him and I won’t ruin our relationship by trying.” Sirius stopped talking and looked into Remus’s eyes waiting for the other man to respond.
“The diary that controlled Ginny and got her to open the Chamber of Secrets. It belonged to Tom Riddle, who grew up to be Voldemort. He left a piece of himself in the diary when he was at school. It was conscious and it seemed to have some memories of life after he left school. It took energy or magic or something from Ginny once we were all in the chamber...it would have killed her but I stabbed the diary with a Basilisk fang. Once the diary was destroyed the memory died.” Harry told the full tale of his second year, he assumed everyone knew what had gone down in the chamber but the shocked looks on his friend’s faces proved him wrong.
Harry purchased a water bottle, a chocolate bar, and a pre-made sandwich for 9$ he missed wizarding treats, he would much rather be drinking pumpkin juice and eating a treacle tart off the trolly on the Hogwarts Express.
He told Hermione that he knew about her and Ron and that he was happy for them, and he assured her that Hedwig was free and could deliver him letters if she sent them he just wouldn’t see them until the evening when his relatives were asleep.
“We only know what you’ve told us, Harry. Pans said something to you because she saw some familiar signs in you, we’ve seen them before but it was never our place to say anything, now you’re here though and you opened up a bit in the great hall and we just wanted you to know that you don’t have to be alone.” Draco wished Pansy was there now, she was so much better with words
“Boy, don’t you have any respect! I told you, one more time and you’d be sleeping in the bloody closet!” His uncle bellowed and Harry winced at the tone before he heard a second voice and felt a stabbing pain violent collided with his head.
Harry, Draco, Vincent, Greg, Blaise, and Pansy all grabbed brooms from the Slytherin shed. Harry had his firebolt and the others all grabbed one of the gifted nimbus 2001s that they had received during Harry’s second year.
He had arrived 30 minutes early which gave him time to pick a compartment and get settled before the piles of students came flooding on. Harry hadn’t seen any of his friends yet, and the housemates of his he had seen didn’t seem very happy to be talking to him as he walked by looking for an empty seat. He found one at the back of the train and got settled in.
Albus knew he couldn’t dwell on the legality of the issue, Sirius Black had the influences to turn Harry back in the right direction which was all he needed. He grabbed the letter and made his way to the owlery to send it to Grimmwald place.
“And if anyone is bothering you just signal to one of us, or Theo he went to save us seats. We’ll help you. There’s already talk, we haven’t been to the hall yet but we passed a group of fourth years on our way up and they were saying that one of the fifth year Gryffindors has been saying that you sold them out and betrayed them. Blaise told them off but I’m sure it’s not over.  Don’t worry Harry, you won’t have to handle anything on your own.” Draco somehow assured Harry of his fears even though he hadn’t even voiced them. It gave him a feeling of butterflies flapping mercilessly in his stomach.
“What on earth does that mean” Pansy questioned suddenly very interested, she had also been caught off-guard by Harry’s behavior at the table she shuddered to think of what her parents would do if she behaved in such a way.
“I don’t know what she said to you - and I don’t need to.” he added promptly, “...but I wanted to let you know that I’m really happy for you. You studied your ass off and you did great. Honestly, you should be proud, I am.”
“You lucked out mate, when Draco told me where you were we were both certain they would make you see the Wizengmot,” Blaise said when Harry finished telling them about the questioning.
“Your room Mr. Potter” Snape pointed at a door with three names on it, he grabbed his wand and added a third plack that read ‘Harry J. Potter’ “Do try and get some rest, and don’t forget an awakening charm for the morning.”
Harry knew that Hermione and Ron had been getting closer this past year, even though neither of them said anything to him Harry assumed that they were getting together. Harry didn’t mind, he had even said so over the years, he wasn’t mad. Besides, he was into blokes. Plus, if  Hermione was with Ron and they were spending the summer together it would explain why he hadn’t heard from her either.
Harry thought for a moment before timidly nodding a no; having someone behind him had been hard enough, having Snape that close to him would certainly send him back over the edge. Snape instantly sat back down, he was there if Harry needed but gave the space he had requested.
Dean and Seamus were sitting together on Dean’s bed chatting about their summers and holding hands, they looked up when Harry walked in but that was the most acknowledgment he had gotten. His trunk was at the foot of his bed like it always was, he grabbed some of his things, changed into pajamas, and climbed into bed.
Severus felt as if his stomach had been filled with cement, how had Harry gone his whole life without being comforted after a bad dream - it’s not like he himself had a great childhood but at least Severus had people to comfort him - Merlin,
“Not that I know of, but no one else in my house has been given any detentions with Professor Umbridge.”
“Hey, guys!” Harry spoke, excited to see his friends again. Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Ginny were all sitting and chatting together. Harry wasn’t met with the happy responses he was expecting, in fact,  he wasn’t met with any responses. Ginny glared at him, while Ron looked like he was doing everything he could to not look at Harry. Hermione shot Neville a knowing look and put her hand on Ron’s lap. Neville nodded and stood joining Harry in the hall and closing the compartment door behind him.
“Severus, I didn’t know you would be joining us today,” Dumbledore spoke as Harry and Snape entered his office
Rowena Ravenclaw used her magic to create something more tangible and physical. She used her magic to install the secret passages that filled every corridor of the building. She knew only those with the most intelligence and determination would be able to find and use the passages. While she knew the passages alone could benefit so many she also added several unfortunate traps and obstacles that would only appear if someone in the passage had truly evil intent.
“Please please don’t go. Draco please don’t go, I don’t - please don’t leave me alone.” Harry was sobbing and his voice cracked with desperation but he never reached out for Draco hell he hardly
“Okay, it’s okay - you’re alright. I’m gonna take us back Sirius but you’ve got to hold on alright. Don’t let go you’re going to side along.” Remus ran his fingers through Sirius Hair once more and stole a final glance around the room before apparating back to Grimmauld Place.
“You’re right, I’m sorry I shouldn’t have judged you before we even had a chance to work together. Do you want to add the moonstone once it’s ready?” Draco asked
"Oh, it's really simple, just have a panic attack in front of him and the headmaster a few minutes before class and he’ll excuse you and a friend." Harry joked about a serious matter in a way he probably wouldn’t have if he and Draco and not just spent so much time exchanging funny stories to lighten to mood.
Draco added the first parts of moonstone and began to stir, if Harry didn’t speak up Draco was bound to forget he was there he got so drawn into his potions work he was known to forget everything else around him. Pansy had informed Harry of this earlier in the library so he spoke up,
The Gryffindors gasped but didn’t react as strongly as the Slytherins who weren’t used to hearing Harry call the Dark Lord by his name, Draco tensed up and Harry could feel it due to how close they were to each other.
“Severus is this-” She stopped to hand the professor the piece of parchment with the blood results. She highlighted the area of concern so he knew where to look.
Unfortunately, this meant that Harry would have to spend a night in London so he could get his things before school started. Looking back over his supply list he realized that he just needed some potion ingredients, his books, parchment, and one new set of robes. He hadn’t outgrown the ones from the year before but one of his sets was badly damaged and he wouldn’t have a chance to repair them before the term - a bitter feeling passed over him because Mrs. Weasley always tended to his damaged robes over the summer.
“This magic only works when a student is in danger of being hurt in their house or when they accept that they’ve been abandoned. I don’t know what happened yet, but Harry’s in Slytherin now and he hasn’t talked to anyone about how he woke the magic yet. Albus wants me to convince him that he does belong in Gryffindor but I don’t think I can do it Moons. Everything I’ve read today says this only happens in extreme situations, whatever happened in Gryffindor must have been
“The powdered porcupine quills?” Draco inquired once the potion was the desired shade of orange Harry sprinkled the quills into the center of the cauldron as Draco switched directions and started stirring clock-wise. The color changed one last time into a pearly white.
Harry learned that Draco and Pansy’s parents knew each other well so they had been friends since before school. Vincent and Greg lived in the same village and spent loads of time together, when they were young people often mistook them for brothers. Harry also noticed that Blaise and Theo tended to keep to themselves most of the time, so he still knew little about them.
As the founders worked to build and establish Hogwarts they each added bits of their magic to a core they placed underneath the castle. This was delicate work and if it were too complex it wouldn’t hold over the years after they passed. So each of the Hogwarts Four came up with one specific task for their piece of magic to do.
“It’s my pleasure as well Madam Bones,” Harry bowed his head as Draco had shown him and then he sat down in the seat he was given next to Professor Snape. Severus curtly nodded at Harry once he was seated as a way to tell him that he was doing fine. The professor had planned on giving Harry the same brief lesson that Draco had but found that his godson had beat him to it.
Hey I'm like so so so sorry that I just disappeared for a while. My mental health took a deep dive into shit and I had to have surgery so it got pretty chaotic. Also my computer is broken so I finished and edited this on my phone, it may not be as good as usual but ill probaly go back and fix it. I hope everyone's doing okay and you all enjoy this chapter
“Madame Pomfrey” Severus spoke as they entered the hospital, “I’m sure you have heard that some very powerful magic was activated last night and per the request of that magic Mr. Potter needs a general medical exam.” Snape bowed lightly in thanks as the medi-witch entered.
“Mr. Potter, I’m afraid that is not an option. What Professor Umbridge did was not only against the rules, but it was illegal, and even if it wasn’t she needs to be stopped. If she thinks this is an appropriate punishment for a student talking back in class we can only imagine what a harsher punishment looks like.” Snape informed, all the students around could tell he was angry but Harry was the only one who didn’t recognize the protectiveness he was showing. All of the upper-class Slytherins had seen this before, their head of house was a protector and someone had hurt one of his so now there were going to be consequences.
At the other end of the castle, the Headmaster was sitting at his desk looking down at the letter he had just written. It was definitely against at least one code of ethics for him to send it, but it could be the key to getting his golden boy back where he belonged. Albus was sure that if he could just convince Harry that he was meant to be back in Gryffindor all the other pieces would begin falling into place. He decided to read the letter over again before sending it,
The thought of his friends made him yearn, he hadn’t heard from them all summer. He had hoped that by refusing to take Hedwig to the Durselys with him the clever bird would have brought him his mail once his relatives were sleeping. She tried, Hedwig visited all the time she would bring Harry parchment and a muggle pen when she could so Harry could scribble a note while the Dursely’s slept - the odd thing was he never received anything back. His letters to Hermionie, Remus, and Sirius had all gone unanswered even when he was sure Hedwig had delivered them.
Harry froze, listening to every kind word Snape had to say - he decided to stay - slowly and silently he turned around and lowered himself back into the abandoned chair.
“Nooo!” Harry let out his most painful scream yet, he felt tears running down his face and unexplainable stabbing pain in his stomach.
