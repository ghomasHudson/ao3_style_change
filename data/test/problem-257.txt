On the contrary, things could not be more different for Draco. The ministry had graciously decided to drop all of his charges. They’d elected that he had no control over his situation and therefore could not be held accountable. He was a good person with awful circumstances. His father, on the other hand, was sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban. His mother was under indefinite house arrest. Draco had spent the entire summer debating whether or not to finish off his education. On one side, his inheritance was enough to grant him, his children, and any grandchildren a luxurious life. However, he wanted to be something more than just a snotty Malfoy-turned-Death Eater whose life ended after things went downhill. It was eventually his mother who pushed him towards going back for the eighth year. Chances were incredibly low that he’d be able to get a job without proper education, and this was the easiest way to do that. “Draco,” his mother had said, “get yourself back to normalcy. Get your life back together and make a name for yourself- one that doesn’t depend on our family’s reputation. You can and will do great things, but only if you work for it. This is your opportunity. Take it,
“The charms project for this past month has been to try to make up a new spell that does whatever you want it to, right?”
“What did you do?”
Which is probably why he woke up in Malfoy's bed two mornings ago. He didn't mean to, he just was desperate. After five nights of barely sleeping, he crossed the room past midnight and sneaked through the heavy curtains. Malfoy was sound asleep and he envied him profoundly, git. His foggy brain reasoned that maybe if he laid in bed next to him he could relax enough to get some rest. It was just going to be for a while, then he would go back to his own bed… but he got cold, so he got under the blankets, as far as he could in the narrow bed, mind you, and fell blissfully asleep in the comfortable soft mattress.
Right then,an eighth year bloke with blond hair was in his bed. Eighth year and blond hair… Ah, it had to be Draco Malfoy, then.
Harry’s worries lied with the dorm aspect of McGonagall’s speech. He’d shared with Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus since they were first years. Having only one other person would take a lot of getting used to. Not to mention, if it truly was assigned randomly, chances were pretty high that none of them would be together. It was even more likely that he’d have to share with someone from another house, and he just wasn’t prepared to make that adjustment. Hermione told him plain and simply that he was “a big boy now,” and that he would have to “just suck it up, because this little change wouldn’t be the end of the world.”
Draco stood at the foot of the bed, staring down at Harry disapprovingly. His expression softened a bit at the pleading look on Harry’s face. Then, he walked to the side of the bed. He took Harry by the hand and pulled him up. Harry stood face-to-face with Draco, fingers still intertwined. “There’s always tomorrow, Harry,” he whispered.
Draco just stared. "Well, can I have it back?"
Draco stretched as he opened his eyes after his 5 A.M. alarm set off. Waiting until the last possible minute to get up and start the day, he rolled over onto the cold side of his bed- or at least, what should have been the cold side. Instead, he found a very warm mass of person by his side. He quickly turned back to his original position, accidentally elbowing them in the process. Draco grabbed his wand from under his pillow and cast a quick silencing spell just-in-case
"Pansy... is potter wearing my hoodie?" He asked with a confused expression. Pansy tried to hold back her laughter. This was just too good.
He was negotiating playing snap after an inch into the essay when a commotion started.
There was a moment where those silver eyes shone with utter
Ron laughed. "Harry, we share a room. You really think I didn't notice you smelling them in the middle of the night? You didn't even put up charms!"
If he was being honest, that’s not the worst outcome he could have had. Obviously their history might make things difficult, but Harry was overall unbothered. So what if he was rooming with Malfoy? After everything that had happened, his only goal was to sit back, relax, and enjoy his last year. For once in his lifetime, he wasn’t being actively hunted by some evil power. Besides, Harry reasoned to himself, it’s not like Malfoy had come out of the war unchanged. He had become a death eater, changed sides, and, in Harry’s eyes, sufficiently paid his dues. Hell, he’d even played a major part in Hogwarts’ repairs. Coming back wouldn’t be easy for any of them. He had no reason to make this any harder.
"Pansy, I can't find my sweatshirt anywhere," Draco huffed as he flopped onto a couch in the 8th year common room.
in the early morning light that slipped through parted curtains and promised a typical cloudy day.
“Potter?” It was a tone that spoke of horror, embarrassment, and sheer desperation that they were both trapped in a nightmare. Harry was impressed that Malfoy could convey so much with just a single word, but then again, this was the same word that Malfoy had been screaming at him for over seven years, now.
"It's black and it has a golden snitch on the back."
Draco looked down. “Whatever.”
It was Friday, so after dinner almost every eighth year student was hanging out on the common room, chatting or playing games, a few helping each other with homework, others just enjoying the company. Harry spotted Malfoy immediately, he was seated in a comfy armchair near the fire, staring at an open book. Harry sat on the sofa, as far as he could from him, and tried to convince Hermione to do something other than the charms essay due on Tuesday.
Draco rolled his eyes. He let go of Harry’s hand, pushed the sheets off of him and stood from the bed. Harry sat up and hurriedly questioned, “Where are you going?”
Pansy sighed. "Which one?"
He must’ve woken them up when he rolled over the first time because Draco felt the mattress dip and spring back up. With a deep breath, he finally took a glance.
It was dark, the curtains fully closed. Thin rays of moonlight shone through the cracks, casting Harry’s face in silver streaks. Harry’s arms were flung over Draco’s chest, legs pressed up against each other. His hands were warm, heated against Draco’s cold skin, and Draco could feel his pulse hammering against his chest. He sat up, swearing, and beside him, Harry stirred. He opened his eyes, yawned, then froze. “Oh crap. Crap, Draco, crap.”
“There’s no way we’re making it to the party on time. Let’s just get this place cleaned up, then you can explain to me whatever story you may have that lead to
"Your hoodie? Another one? Why haven't you charmed them yet?"
Before he could panic and try to figure out if he had just ended up having a torrid affair without even
He didn’t feel embarrassment now. Perhaps he should.
“Harry, if anything, you’ll be the awful roommate,” he scoffed. “I should know, I spent seven years with you. For once I might not have to wake up smelling your dirty sock scent through the air. Merlin knows you’ve never been good at scourgify charms.”
"Pansy! Someone must've ta-" Draco stopped as Pansy cut him off.
“Potter… what are you doing in my bed?” he asked with a voice full of confusion.
“You may not remember but your bet was “
Draco wasn’t asleep. He was on his back, staring up at the ceiling above. Harry stretched before rolling closer to Draco. The Slytherin scoffed at Harry and gently pushed him. Harry barely budged.
“This is my side of the couch.”
Harry’s mouth twitched into a smile. He nodded slowly. They both stared up at the ceiling. Neither let go of the other’s hand. Harry thought back to the first time he had woken up next to Draco. He cringed a bit, remembering the embarrassment of it all.
Sorry this took me so long! life and Severus, especially, were fighting against me finishing this chapter but here we are! I hope you all enjoy.
down on his desk, rattling his many trinkets and startling the portraits of previous headmasters awake. He was losing pawns left and right and it was all Harry Potter’s fault. The boy should be happy he was already dead because Albus was

“I apologise, Ms Lovegood,” Draco said, bowing awkwardly and turning to vacate the sunroom, “I did not mean to disturb your morning.”
“I’d like to bring my circle here before Rita’s first article goes out. Just to make sure they’re protected from the backlash that is bound to come from that horrible Weasley woman. If that’s okay with you of course, I know how you are about people getting into your space.”
Draco had been observing Harry Potter since he was eleven. Some might call it stalking, or obsessing, or, as Pansy so elegantly put it, lusting … but Draco called it observing. Albeit extensive and extremely thorough observing over a prolonged period of time. Basically, Draco could pick Harry Potter out of a room full of a hundred Harry Potter look a-likes in less than a minute. He always knew where the Boy-Who-Lived was, and thought he had known everything he could ever know about him.
of friends.”
Thanks once again to my Beta Liz who has just been the biggest motivation for this fic and I appreciate her so much.
Albus Dumbledore was always the last person to arrive at Order meetings and Sirius was sure it was a ploy to make himself feel more important. A meeting of twenty two witches and wizards couldn’t start without the
Tom was very interested in Hadrian’s marking process. He knew there was no pain, unlike his own, and the Magic determined the positioning of the Mark, rather than the caster’s own intentions. But he knew very little else and was almost excited to witness the act in person.
. He was about to see whether Rita Skeeter was all she talked herself up to be. His plans were in motion and Dumbledore would no doubt be sitting in his office, high up in the towers of Hogwarts, sweating in his outrageously coloured robes.
“I - Ah,” Severus started, his face paling once more. Hadrian began to think they should wrap this up for the night fairly shortly, for nothing if not Severus’ blood pressure. “I made a vow to both Lily Potter and Dumbledore to protect Harry Potter with my magic and my life.” Severus was worried about his Lord’s reaction, not for making the vow, but for not disclosing this information sooner.
to find out what she knew and deal with her accordingly. Had to see how much the boy had known and had been willing to pass on in the event of his untimely death. Had to stop anything else from being released before all his long term plans came crashing down around him. He
Harry just rolled his eyes at the snobby comment. He supposed that part of Draco was never going to change. It was just part of who he was.
"Not impossible."
"Awesome!"
"Their safety is quite guaranteed within this castle," Dumbledore said smoothly, offering Lothair a smile. "You need not concern yourself with it."
"Alright, ladies," Ilaria called, the amusement still lingering in her tone. "Back in line. I think we've had enough hand-to-hand for one day."
As of right now, things seem to be going smoothly on the writing front and I'm pleased with how things are unfolding. As promised, however, I have been working on cleaning up the story. I haven't finished all the chapters cause the ideas are flowing and I don't want to let that go to waste. I've also created a couple of character playlists for Depth of Darkness. They are all a work in progress. They will be continuously updated as I find new songs to inspire me. You can find it under dan1hart1ey. If you have any issues accessing it, feel free to drop me a PM and I'll send you the link.
Convenient.
Gwynn's eyebrow rose at the vehement denial. "So, you're binding yourself to a complete enemy that you're not attracted to," she hesitated, for a moment before rolling her eyes. "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."
It was not an opinion Harry was unfamiliar with. Gwynn had been trying to wrap her mind around his decision since he'd mentioned it to her an hour or so earlier. She kept trying to see it from different angles only to come up with the same end. Harry was an idiot. With nothing to argue, Harry groaned and sunk back under the water and out of Gwynn's view point.
With a disapproving 'tsk' Rosalind moved to distract Harry from attempting to harm the older Elf. After drying his clothing, she took Harry's face in her hands and studied the damage done to his nose. "I leave you alone for a moment and look what happens," she responded, though her words were serious, there was a smile on her lips, which made Harry feel slightly sheepish about the state he was currently in. Lifting a hand, she carefully pressed the side of his nose, earning a wince in return. "This might sting a little, Harry," she warned, taking a moment to watch for the nod of understanding before she pinched the bridge of his nose and snapped it back into place, Harry's strangled gasp of pain was followed by Ilaria's light chuckle.
"I've been searching the Manor bit by bit," he admitted, with a tense glance to the blonde, "but I haven't found or heard anything that might lead me to believe that she's there."
Forcing himself to his feet using his good arm, Draco's head swam with the effort. Taking several deep breaths to regain a good sense of his self-control, Draco frowned. He could tell which way was North by which side of the tree moss was growing on, but that was no good when he didn't know if it was north he was suppose to be going. Bracing himself against a tree Draco closed his eyes, blocking out the pain in his shoulder so he could think clearly. He didn't have his wand, was barely dressed, and had no idea where he was. He needed to come up with some sort of plan or he might as well have stayed in the Dungeons.
"Whatever. I still don't like it!"
"So, he will be better suited to being the Prince?"
"Shut up."
He was pretty sure his jaw hit the floor when he realized what was inside.
"She is part of your history," Soren explained, turning from the window and the dark view of the horizon to focus back on Harry. "Had you been raised under Elven law as is custom, Lady Alethea would be very familiar to you. As it were, this portion of your education has been sorely lacking. To put it simply, Lady Alethea is, by Elven Customs, your Great Grandmother."
Beside Draco, Akkar turned his head to glance at his charge. "Did you not resign from this Quidditch earlier?"
"You're needed here," Harry continued, softening the blow. "Strategically, you're the only one I can leave at the Manor. Ilaria leads the army. Her presence is more useful in the realm than it will be in the Wizarding World. Lothair can maintain our physical training regiments and any security measure we'll need." There were other reasons he wanted Lothair to go, but he had no intention of voicing those thoughts with anyone other than the Elf in Question.
"Will you tell me what I am?"
There was something like pain that flashed through Harry's eyes at Draco's words and despite the satisfaction he assumed he'd feel at the win, the feeling that clawed through him wasn't satisfaction. Far from it.
Rolling his eyes, he glanced back to Harry who seemed to be frozen in place. His shoulders had relaxed and he seemed to be leaning into Draco's hand. The weight in his own chest had lessened, but the reaction Potter was having was much stronger than his own. Interesting. "Tell them to back down," he commented, tapping his finger against Harry's chest to get his attention.
Grey eyes narrowed dangerously at that slight and a hand instantly reached for his wand. Not finding it at his hip where he normally carried it, Draco growled his frustration and grabbed the first thing he could reach. This happened to be the pitcher of water on the nightstand and, in a moment of anger, he threw it at Harry's bloody irritating face. He watched it sail through the air and felt a brief moment of glee when he realized it would hit it's target before the glass froze mid air, half a foot from Potter's face. While the momentum of the pitcher froze, the water had not, splashing out of the container and soaking Harry from head to toe.
not what he was expecting when he had woken up that morning.
Potter looked just as puzzled. “I…” he started, the morning grog not yet lifted from him. His brow furrowed. “It’s very green in here.” He shook his head as he spoke. “I have to go.”
Draco sat and considered this for a moment before getting up and walking over to the table. "Enjoying my sweatshirt, Potter?" He spat. Harry looked up at the scowling Slytherin.
Draco snarled, yanking his arms away. His cheeks burned and he practically flung the words at the other boy. “Perfectly fine, thanks. God. This wasn’t what I expected when I woke up this morning.”
“Besides,” she had argued, “like it or not Harry, you’re a role model to a pretty significant portion of the population. If not for yourself, do it to spare the tired parents explaining to their kids why they can’t drop out of school like the ‘Great and Wonderful Shining Example Harry Potter.’ Just face it, we’ll ALL be better off this way.”
Draco never got the chance to finish as Harry had crashed their lips together. The kiss was hungry at first, then it softened. After a few moments, Harry backed down and Draco pulled the shorter boy into his arms. Harry rested his head against Draco and whispered, “Me too.”
"Must you have all your meetings in the dead of night?" Harry sighed as he handed Draco his hoodies.
Harry's response was mumbled and he looked at his shoes.
"Pansy! Another hoodie went missing! You don't suppose you've seen it anywhere, have you?"
“Do you want the long version or the short version?”
Malfoy arched his eyebrows. “Do we have sides now?”
He was woken by Harry’s arms on his, his body pressed up against Draco’s.
Harry gave a small sigh but agreed to go to breakfast. All day, he couldn’t help but look forward to the night.
~3 days later~
“Thanks mate, love you too.”
Harry sighed at his own stupidity. "Let's just watch the game."
When Harry awoke, he almost expected to be on the floor. He wasn’t. He was lying next to Draco in bed. They weren’t touching but Harry could still feel a comfortable warmth from Draco. Well, that wasn’t true. They were touching. Their hands were clasped together in the middle of the bed, hidden beneath the sheets.
. Before he could get his bearings, Harry was uncomfortably awake at the cold shock of untouched sheets, head lifting to see that his curtains were open even wider and Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. Not even seconds later and there was the sound of their door opening and closing—not quite a slam, but close enough.
He didn’t know why that was a nightmare. He didn’t even know why he liked Harry Potter.
Draco walked into the great hall for dinner and made his way to the Slytherin table. It wasn't until he sat down that he noticed something was off. Pansy saw Draco staring and followed his gaze to the Gryffindors. In the sea of red, there was one green hoodie. Draco's green hoodie.
the giant squid appeared, that didn't happen.” Seamus answered. Then Terry Boot tried to nick Seamus little notebook and in the struggle, they knocked over a chair, Hermione’s pile of parchments, and a girl seated precariously on a little pouffe. A moment before colliding into Malfoy, he moved like a cat and avoided being crushed under the weight of both contenders.
Wait.
"That's... why didn't I think of that?" Draco responded as he walked back to his dorm.
. Then he moved one of his arms and felt an almost suffocating warmth fade into a sleek coolness associated with fresh sheets and early mornings.
Harry stopped his monologue with a sigh and said, “I haven’t gone mad, I’m just glad I no longer have to fear for my life every day. And who knows, maybe Malfoy will be a horrible roommate and we’ll end up bickering anyway.”
There was a moment where Harry honestly thought he was about to be punched before he felt a sharp pressure on his chest pushing him
The last dream was always of Harry.
“Short version first, then long version when I realize how ridiculous your story is going to be.”
“Alright, what happened?” he asked as they both began to clean the mess.
Harry locked eyes with him. “Maybe.”
Harry blushed and picked the blanket from the floor, it was Gryffindor red. “See? This is my blanket. You hoarded my blanket.”
it, Harry felt the warm, almost bony body next to him shift to be more top of him, an arm hooking around his waist and rough, chapped lips pressing into his neck. Harry should probably feel guilty about the shiver that crawled its way down his spine, syrupy warmth starting to pool in his stomach.
No, he didn’t care. He felt comfortable and cosy next to Draco. He suspected the Slytherin felt the same way.
Harry looked up, emerald eyes locked into grey ones and Draco caught his breath. Harry sighed. “Nightmares. I get them too. And…” He exhaled. “Look. I know this sounds stupid. I’m the Boy Who Lived, I shouldn’t be getting nightmares but…”
Eyes snapping open, Harry stared with blurry vision at the red canopy above him. It had been charmed into Gryffindor colours the day he had stepped into the shared dorm room that was to be made up of all four houses. It was his bed he was in, then, but that didn’t explain why there was someone
Draco just shrugged. “Well. In that case. I’m not sure if I mind.” He plumped the pillows up, turning his back on Harry. “Go to sleep, Potter.”
“Ah, Fred, George, I’m very glad you could make it.” Hadrian said, his velvet voice made Draco shiver. What he wouldn’t give to have that voice directed at him.
“Yes, my Lord - ah, I mean - yes, Hadrian?” It was clear Draco still was not completely comfortable in his new Lord’s presence. Hadrian would have to rectify that mistake as soon as possible. His mate would have to be sure of his position in Hadrian’s life: above all else and completely superior.
Draco was standing next to his Father behind the seated form of the Dark Lord, watching the fireplace with growing anticipation. Hadrian Peverell was talking quietly with Barty, a man who was apparently allowed to leave the Dark Lord’s service and go into that of Lord Thanatos, on a couch to the left of the fireplace. Severus, ever the dour, antisocial type, was leaning against the wall to the right of the room. Looking out at its occupants with a blank mask. Only years of observing the man let Draco see that Severus was just as anxious about this meeting as him.
buckle in front of the Dark Lord. Or, Merlin forbid, his Father. “There is a plan, my twins. Once everyone gets here we will go through it.”

“Fourth year was when I became who I am today. The triwizard tournament was completely insane, even more so when Dumbledore put my name in the Goblet of Fire. I shouldn’t have been surprised, really. Tom wasn’t going to do anything to me so Dumbledore had to make something happen yet again.” Hadrian rolled his eyes like it was nothing too terrible but Barty remembered that year. He remembered the fear his Lord tried so hard to hide from the masses. The ridicule he was subject to just because he was unwillingly entered into a competition meant for adults and the
Tom was quietly shocked that Hadrian did not bind his followers for life. He was sure that, if they ever chose to leave, they would be leaving with no memory of Lord Thanatos or any of his associates, but having the option open was something new to the Dark Lord. He wondered how many of his Death Eaters would have left him before the end of the last war if he had allowed them anything but eternal service to his cause.
Okay everyone, because I'm impatient and I have been sitting on this chapter since 'Living Vampire' I'll treat you all to a surprise update. And it's a long one! This chapter has been written then re-written, scrapped completely then re-written again and it is finally here! I had a LOT of fun with this chapter, I love it almost as much as I love 'Sit Down, Lucy Dear' and I really hope you all like it too. Hadrian and Draco are finally getting something going that will be continuing on to the next chapter in a way that I just LOVE and hopefully they'll realise they're perfect together sooner rather than later.
He had just received his first mission from Lord Thanatos, who held his loyalty equally with Lord Voldemort, and he was confused. Severus hated being confused, so the whole ordeal was already affecting him, but these orders were the strangest he’d ever received.
“Tom and I have been working together since my first year and he’s been sending me nutrient and healing potions since he found out about my life at the Dursley's at the end of second year. I’ve been glamouring the progress it’s made on my body and just taking it off made me look different enough. Thanks for that, by the way Severus.”
to contain this.
After a good twenty minutes of the entire Order inhabiting the Black kitchen, Albus Dumbledore finally stepped through the floo. Lilac robes with yellow stars bombarded their way into the room and turned to stand at the head of the table opposite Sirius. Another power play by Albus Dumbledore, but one by Sirius too. By all polite societal rules, the two of them were on equal footing in this meeting and it was clear from the unimpressed look Dumbledore was sporting, that the old man didn’t like it.

“That’s what they were for?” Severus asked, having made an abundance of those potions for his Lord for years, even when the Dark Lord had no visible reason for them.
His son was alive.
breakfast, another breakfast, nerves, emotions and draco gets a new room and might just be onto something.
Someone cleared their throat next to Draco and he turned to face the Weasley twins. Draco had never spoken to the twins in his time at Hogwarts and looking at them eating at with his family was unnerving. The Malfoys and Weasleys had been at odds with each other for decades and he never would have thought this day would come.
Hadrian’s eyes went wide as Tom spoke, remembering something he’d missed from his discussion with the Goblins. “Oh, I can’t believe I forgot!” he exclaimed. Tom cocked an eyebrow in question, motioning for Hadrian to go on. “He’s been using my seats in the Wizengamot! Granted it’s only the Potter ones, but if I align those and the others I gained claiming my Lordships today with the Dark, Lucius could be Chief Warlock by tomorrow night.”
In all honesty, he hadn’t been paying too much attention when Hadrian and the Dark Lord were talking to the Skeeter woman. He was too busy reeling over the ease at which Hadrian Peverell took control of a room. His mere presence drew they eye and Draco was sure Skeeter had completely forgotten there were other people present as soon as the young Lord started speaking. Draco was out of the loop but, as a large, black Eagle Owl swooped through the open window and dropped a copy of the
“If we stay on their side, my friend,” Severus replied, grabbing hold of the Malfoy Lord’s elbow so as not to lose each other in the commotion of a burning building, “we might just come out for the better.”
Hadrian narrowed his eyes. He knew exactly who Lucius Malfoy was, knew more than Lucius probably realised, and he was not particularly impressed. Lucius seemed to be forgetting exactly who
pleased with this plan. He should have done it years ago.
Everyone was present finally and settling down around the table. On the right of Ragnok sat Hadrian, then Draco and Severus, followed by Luna, Neville, Tonks and Andromeda, then finally Percy Weasley. The last two looked thoroughly confused as to why they had been mentioned in Harry Potter’s will and Sirius had to bite back a chuckle. He imagined this was going to be a
Hadrian’s smile was just as sharp as he stood and led the reporter out of the room. Albus Dumbledore would never knew what hit him.
The contents of Mr. Potter’s package alarmed and frankly astounded me as it included, among other documents, an account of the Boy-Who-Lived’s life since that fateful Halloween in Godric’s Hollow written by Mr. Potter himself. What I found in this account was cause for me to immediately contact the Auror department for confirmation on what I thought to be extremely dangerous information. Head Auror, Amelia Bones, after seeing the astonishing allegations has assured me the authenticity of the account by Harry Potter and, has put her best Aurors on the case to determine whether the Boy-Who-Lived is, in fact, as safe as we have been told.
Bill and Charlie get a surprise, Lucius is not happy about it. Hadrian goes territorial and Tom sits back and enjoys the show.
“We will of course be accepting the offer,” William started when he was sure of Harry’s instructions credibility. “What family will we be required to stay with?”
Peverell looked a little exasperated, and Severus really couldn’t blame him. If he had gone through half of the ‘challenges’ Albus Dumbledore had put the boy through, he’d be a little exasperated too. Perhaps more so, but he doubted he was seeing all of Peverell’s emotions right now.
their conversations.”
For those of you who have been asking about the relationship between Luna and the boys, I'm just going to say it's complicated. There will be nothing romantic or sexual about the connection between Luna and Hadrian or Luna and Draco per se but she will be very, very close to them. Luna is Luna so she has a different idea about what the social norm is for personal boundaries and such and Hadrian and Draco will understand that. She is also attempting to initiate the relationship that Draco and Hadrian have but are unwilling to admit at the moment and is perfectly willing to make either of the boys jealous in order to do that. There is also the fact that she's going to spend the next indefinite number of years with these two people and she sees no reason not to be as close to either of them as she wants. I hope that clears a few things up for you all and you'll get to see it develop a bit more in the coming chapters.
“Yes, Severus. You have been unwittingly helping Hadrian here for years,” Tom said snickering at the look of shock on Severus’ face.
for a job interview. All was going fairly normally before the crazy bat made a prophecy:
“They are coming, my Lord. I came early to take care of your nargles.”
I for one was appalled to hear our great Albus Dumbledore has held a prominent position in our governing body unlawfully for all this time, and asked whether that was the reason the Potter and Black seat alignment has changed parties.

A knock on the door broke the mood of the room. “Are you ready for them to see the real Harry Potter, brat?”

son, not some filthy halfblood.”
Neville cleared his throat from his position at Hadrian’s right and he looked up to see the eyes of everyone present locked onto him. His wolves were tightly wound in anticipation, at his left Luna was practically bouncing in her seat with tense excitement, as they waited to see if Skeeter would pull through. Hadrian met the gaze of his beautiful mate as Chronos flew back out the window, no doubt in search of Hedwig, and smiled. It was all white teeth and crazed eyes and Hadrian saw Draco shiver with an emotion Hadrian dearly hoped was positive. “Let’s see what the
Draco was nervous. He was standing in the sitting room of Peverell Manor, the Dark Lord and Hadrian’s home, waiting for the inner circle of followers to the second deadliest person he had ever met to arrive. He had no idea what to expect and, honestly, he wasn’t sure he wanted to find out. But, the Dark Lord requested his presence and Hadrian Peverell hadn’t kicked him out yet, so he was required to see this meeting through. He just hoped Hadrian hadn’t invited a group of people from Hogwarts who hated him. That wouldn’t end well.
‘His body was in the worst condition I have seen outside a torture victim,’ one healer said after examining Mr Potter. ‘It is likely the young Mr Potter was, in fact, a victim of long-term abuse.’ I was shocked at this assertion as you can well imagine and vowed to find out more. Hasn’t Albus Dumbledore consistently told us our Saviour has been treated like a prince for all that he has done for this world? Did Albus Dumbledore know about the treatment Harry Potter was facing every summer he returned from Hogwarts? I don’t know my dear readers, but I endeavour to find out.
My dear readers, this is where I bring you news almost too painful to share. At 5:15pm Harry James Potter’s body was found locked in what appeared to be a supply closet under the main staircase of the house. After a careful examination from St. Mungo’s best emergency healers, it was determined that Harry Potter’s death was not caused by the fire. Instead, he departed this world more than 48 hours before the blaze was set.
“I see,” Tom said. “We shall be talking about this at a later date Severus. It is a good thing Hadrian is to be protected with your life no matter what side your on now, isn’t it?”
Severus cast the diagnostic charm and a list of golem-Harry’s injuries appeared in tight green script on a conjured bit of parchment. The list clearly stated a punctured right lung to be the cause of death and that the body had been dead for at least 48 hours. A quick identity charm confirmed the body to be Harry James Potter and Severus was happy to conclude the Aurors would successfully identify the body.
Lord Peverell stalked back to his seat and sat in the most elegantly lazy position Severus had ever seen. One ankle crossed over the other leg and arms spread on the arm rests, he looked sculpted by the gods, like a predator wrapped up in the most beautiful and dangerous package they could come up with. Lucius was fucked.
As was the Dark Lord. And Peverell’s followers.
“Good, I believe she will be excited, perhaps even uncover more than we were able to. Hopefully we can get him out of Chief Warlock position before the Hogwarts term starts.”
“Are all those things people talk about true?” Draco asked. “Like did you really stab a Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor?” Severus was admittedly quite excited to find out what the Golden Boy had actually got up to during his years at Hogwarts. People worshiped the ground he walked on and, despite the proof sitting in front of him that Hadrian Peverell was nothing short of brilliant genetically, Severus wanted to know what more Dumbledore had been hiding from him concerning the boy.
The haughty look Peverell sported now told Severus exactly how he felt about his inheritance being questioned by a Lord of lower standing. “No, Lucius,” the young Vampire purred, “
“Something is going to happen tonight, isn’t it my Lord?” Hadrian couldn’t help the way his body reacted to the title on his mate’s lips, it was an acknowledgement of his power and Hadrian had to shift slightly in his seat.
Thanks again to Liz for being my spare eyes and I want to thank all you lovely people who've stuck with this fic so far! Your comments make my day and I love knowing that you enjoy this as much as I do.
This was why he was so surprised when the young man himself showed up in the Dark Lord’s office, and that he’d seen the man twice before that day and not recognised him for who he was. His creature inheritance, or the slight shift in his now unmasked magic could have changed him enough for anyone else to be fooled, but Draco was sure he knew him better than that. A voice that sounded deceptively like Pansy assured Draco it was probably just because he was so completely enamoured by the young man’s looks that he was too much of a drooling mess to think properly. She may have been right. He guessed he would never know.
“Take one of the guest rooms on the second floor each for tonight,” the Dark Lord said, finally dismissing the two Malfoys. Lucius pulled his son up from the seat next to him, they both bowed and walked out of the Dark Lord’s office. It had been a very long night.
“It must have been a painful few days,” the second twin said. A look of pain flashing through his eyes. Draco thought these two must really care about their Lord.
“He’s getting more and more violent with me each summer I come back from Hogwarts and I keep asking Dumbledore to be moved somewhere else, but the blood wards are too damn important aren’t they Headmaster? It doesn’t matter that the most danger I have ever been in while living with the muggles has been from bleeding out in the cupboard under the stairs. I’ve had more broken bones than I have bones in my body, more scars than skin on my back and still no one seemed to notice that they didn’t just ‘hate me’ as I told anyone who asked. They despised me, and magic, and made it their life’s mission to beat and bleed the magic out of me.”
There were no pictures of the boy, Severus found as he perused the living room. Only those of a whale-like child and his equally animal-like parents. No trace that a fourth person lived in the house at all. Considering this property was actually part of the Potter estate, Severus found that in extremely poor taste.
Taking the opportunity to retire, Hadrian stood up. Barty stood with him, surprising everyone but the Tom with his action. “Barty and I better go write those letters Tom, I’ll see you all for breakfast in the morning,” Hadrian said, making eye contact with Draco as he added, “sleep well.”
Luna watched gleefully as the whimpering and shaking form of Alexander Avery sank lower to the ground, head almost touching the black marble tiles. He must have said something about a Wolf for her Lord to be reacting in this way, she hoped her Lord would still punish him, despite her interruption.
“You!” Lucius spluttered out and Severus could see Draco’s face getting increasingly more mortified. His father was about to make a fool of himself. “How did you do this?” he gestured wildly around the room, “Do you really expect me to believe you have been deceiving us all this time?”
Draco had no idea he was making Hadrian’s heart sing.
This chapter fought me... Barty wasn't coming out quite how I wanted him but I hope you still enjoy and know that he should get better as I go along and he becomes a more developed personality for me. It's a bit of a short one but, as we keep going with the story there'll be more longer chapters for you all.
He stopped short when he realised what the Dark Lord and Peverell were looking at..
“I need some explanations,” Lucius said bluntly and Severus wondered, not for the first time, how this man made it into Slytherin. He could see Draco a few chairs over thinking something similar and felt a surge of pride for his godson. He was much more sensible than his father.
Dumbledore freaks and an interesting group of people gather to hear Harry Potter's last words.
Albus Dumbledore had been in indisputable control of magical Britain for as long as Charlie could remember but things were obviously  changing. Lord Peverell, whether he was working on Harry’s orders or not, would shake the foundations of Magical Britain in a way even You-Know-Who never managed. He had the Daily Prophet on his side and an openly low opinion of Dumbledore. He could influence a great many people, pureblood, halfblood and muggleborn. Charlie dearly hoped the young Lord would change things for the better.
Her Lord chuckled and Luna watched in fascination as the first two rows of black cloaked people visibly shivered. She could only wonder what they had done to set him off earlier. She had felt his magic from the other side of the Manor.
“There’s not much to know Mr. Peverell. Albus Dumbledore has always been very secretive about the boy’s home, wouldn’t let any of us find him before he went to Hogwarts. Dumbledore has told everyone that he’s with his last living relatives and that he gets treated in a manner fitting of the ‘saviour’ he is.”
So sorry for the delay!! Chapters should be up on Sundays for the foreseeable future.
Sirius traded a look with Remus as Dumbledore cleared his throat, expecting the room to delve into silence at his simplest command. But this wasn’t Hogwarts. Dumbledore didn’t quite reign supreme outside the Castle’s hallowed halls. Especially as the man continued to sprout to anyone who would listen that Voldie was back, despite the old snake-face having yet given no sign of getting up to his old tricks. If it weren’t for Harry’s, sometimes cryptic, comments about said Dark Lord, Sirius would have been right along-side the masses in thinking Dumbledore had finally gone completely barmy.
The next few chapters will go a bit quicker before we get a bit more explanation on what Hadrian and Tom have been up to all this time. I hope you can all wait for more Drarry moments too, Draco's being a bit clueless at the moment. He'll get there eventually.
“Yes, my Grandmother was a Black from the main line. And, when I was born, Sirius blood adopted me and named me his heir. He knew even then that he would produce no heirs himself and I have always been like a son to him.”
would care that Harry
“He has been cleared of all the potions and spells manipulating his personality and, there is also the fact that his mind is, and will continue to be, completely impenetrable to anyone but me.” Lucius was shocked at this statement. How could someone so young have such a strong mind, especially with what Severus said about the boy’s Occlumency training in his fifth year? “He will never betray the Dark, Lucius. The cause is much too close to his heart for that to happen.”
He knew logically, of course, that Lord Thanatos could probably strike him dead in half a second but with his magic feeling like it did right now, Severus could not even begin to be afraid.
A few more people entered the room and Sirius watched with amusement as Harry - no, Hadrian now, - ignored the presence of the Weasleys and Granger but stood to greet Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy. He guided them to the seats next to him and it didn’t go past Sirius that Hadrian placed the Malfoy kid in the most protected place in the room: Right between Snape and Hadrian himself and across from Sirius, Remus and Bill Weasley. Hadrian obviously wasn’t comfortable with the blonde being here and Sirius had to wonder whether his son had picked up a creature inheritance since he last saw him. Hadrian was certainly acting in the subtle way Moony sometimes would with him in a room full of potential threats.
Severus was not enjoying this story. Not at all.
“Is that why you don’t look like the scrawny, emaciated little shit I’ve spent the last year teaching?” Severus asked, studying Hadrian with narrowed eyes.
Severus was waiting in the Peverell Manor sitting room, surrounded by students he had never even pretended to like, his Lord and two of the least annoying Death Eaters.
that morning, and it had taken the better part of the day to assemble the remaining members of the old organisation in Sirius Black’s ancestral kitchen. The Azkaban escapee looked over the assorted witches and wizards Dumbledore tasked with fighting on behalf of the Light and could barely contain his scoff. These sorry excuses for talented magic wielders could barely even manage to be in the same place at the same time, let alone fight together for the sake of the Wizarding World.
“There’s a letter here from Mum and Dad for you as well. You have my permission to take whatever you want from the Potter or Black Libraries, and Potter Cottage, just outside Hogsmeade, is yours. I hope that you,” Harry paused with a teasing smirk, “
Tom snorted and raised his refilled glass in Hadrian’s direction. “You did well my dear, keeping him occupied while we began our overthrow of his Light world.” Barty could heart the contempt in Tom’s voice as he talked about the Light side and agreed with it. Dumbledore needed to be taken down and that was exactly what his Lord was trying to do.
They watched countless times as young Harry was thrown in the cupboard under the stairs, watched him cry silently in the dark, praying to escape his relatives. They watched as a large, fat, walrus-like man punched and kicked and whipped the young boy from as young as three years old. They saw a horse-faced woman order a four year old Harry to cook breakfast and refuse to give him a stool even after he burnt his hand on the cooker he was too short to see properly.
The boy had gone above and beyond, like he seemed to do with everything, and not just sworn allegiance to the Dark but became a Dark Lord in his own right. Or maybe, Severus considered, a Grey Lord or something more like that. He didn’t think Hadrian, no matter how Dark he got, could ever be as Dark as the Dark Lord himself.
“Hadrian is far more vindictive towards those who harm the people he loves, than he is to those who harm himself; Dumbledore being the exception of course,” the Dark Lord explained and Severus supposed he could understand. Though, why the boy didn’t just leave the Dursleys in the house when he burnt it to the ground was still confusing. It was what Severus would have done, If he wasn’t so much more inclined to making everyone suffer as much as he did.
: Diagon Alley, Gringotts)
“See to it that it doesn’t,” he said as he stalked back to his seat by the fire. Doing nothing to break the tension that continued to fill the air. They all knew now; Draco was his. It was for the best. It meant they would leave his mate alone.
Were starting to get a bit of a move on now. Introducing some new characters soon and I hope you all stick with me through this wild ride.
Padfoot stood watching as the team of healers levitated a small body out from the charred house on a stretcher and had to close his eyes. He couldn’t believe it. There was no way he could believe that Harry was dead. Taken from him before they even had the chance to be a proper family.
Lord Thanatos’ magic was magnificent. Stroking up against Severus’ own in an almost loving way. Letting him know that he was safe with this Lord and the wonderful magic surrounding him.
“Perhaps, Hadrian, we should explain a little more before poor Lucius here loses his head?” the Dark Lord said, unsuccessfully hiding his smirk behind his whiskey glass once again. Lucius shrunk further back into the couch as he remembered the Dark Lord was present in the room for his outburst. Severus wanted to pity his friend, but couldn’t deny that Lucius got himself into these situations all on his own.
Barty remembered when Hadrian first approached him about his ‘get revenge on Dumbledore’ plan, the look of pure determination that shon out of Hadrian’s eyes had him captivated from the beginning. Hadrian was more determined than Barty had ever seen the Dark Lord and he had a sort of natural charisma that, even before his Creature Inheritance, rivalled that of a young Tom Riddle.
Thanks for listening to my rambling and I hope you enjoy some Tom and Hadrian fun :)
“Yes, my Lord,” Lucius said meekly, attempting to retreat to his seat when Peverell cleared his throat.
The room was silent except for the slightly ragged breathing coming from the Malfoy Lord. Severus was shocked. He could see Draco was shocked too.
Barty turned away as the image of a bruised, five year old Harry was thrown outside in clothes barely small enough to stay on his tiny body, and told to give his horrid Aunt an award winning garden ‘or else’. He could not bare to watch the memory’s of his young Lord once again. He could never understand how Hadrian had survived his early childhood.
Draco physically stumbled back a step. His stomach dropping through the floor of the Dark Lord’s study. He was in so much more shit than he originally anticipated.
Draco squeezed Hadrian’s hand even tighter, hoping now to display his infinite gratitude to the man. He had never been able to have access to his Black heritage as the previous Lord Black died before acknowledging Draco as an official member of the Black family. He couldn’t help wondering why Hadrian was being so nice to him. He had no reason to publicly display the end of their rivalry. Especially now that Harry Potter was dead.
Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter
Said Dark Lord sat chuckling at the looks of horror on his followers faces. Lucius was horrified that someone could talk so openly about the Dark Lord while the man sat right next to him. He could not comprehend ever feeling comfortable enough around the immensely powerful man to
“Ah, yes. That was partly due to the early inheritance, but also because I’m a full blooded metamorphmagus and I took off my glamour.”
“Ronald Bilius Weasley,” Harry smirked, and his voice turned sickly sweet, “I give you this advice: stop being such a jealous prat and maybe you won’t have to compel people into being your friend.”
It had been a
Snape had an impressed look on his face as he regarded Hadrian. Barty knew the feeling. For someone as young as Hadrian, he had an impressive number of people willing to follow his every word. Willing to take up his cause and serve under him for as long as he lives. Which, considering what he is, is a very long time. Barty knew he had done the right thing in pledging his loyalty to Hadrian Peverell. He would win this war, creating a better, safer world for all magical beings. Barty couldn’t wait to see it.
I, of course, asked how the whole of Britain could assume the guilt of a wrongly accused man and DMLE Head Madam Amelia Bones provided my answer. ‘After an extensive search through the departmental records, it was found that Sirius Orion Black was never given his lawful right to a trial by Wizengamot before his imprisonment in 1981.’ Madame Bones admitted at a stilted press conference this morning with a grim face.
He stood abruptly, his chair clattering to the ground behind him, and strode determinedly to the front door. Ignoring the pale faces of the Order and the chocked calling of his name from Remus. He had to see it for himself.
“I’m sure you all have a boat load of questions, yeah?” he asked the stunned group before him. At their silent nods in agreement he allowed a smirk to cross his face and glanced at Tom. The amusement shining in the man’s red eyes urged him onwards and he prepared himself to tell his life story. These people all had an important position in his life and deserved to know the real him. “I’m going to answer them all but I’ll have to ask you to wait until I’m done before you throw a fit, okay?” he said with a pointed glance at Severus, knowing this information was likely to affect him the most.
“If Harry wanted them here he must have had a reason Ron,” he said, hoping the anger washing through him would be mistaken for grief. Sirius knew how little love Harry had for the youngest Weasleys and was waiting in anticipation for the incoming reveal. “Today’s about Harry, nothing else! Now shut up so I can hear my godson’s last words to me.”
“Oh -,” Draco exclaimed, obviously not expecting to encounter someone so early on a Saturday morning. Luna had noticed the young man liked to rise before everyone else in order to spend some time on his own before the wolves awoke. She understood. Living with a small family for your whole life did nothing to prepare you for waking up to deal with the Weasley twins and Barty. They were much more than only the most patient person could handle in the morning. Luna admired her Lord for his ability to do just that.
Severus just wants to sleep, Lucius is apprehensive and Draco admits he might have an obsession
looking forward to the year to come.
Hadrian’s smile was as fake as Skeeter herself as he watched the woman lie through her teeth. He chose to forgo the warm welcome she was clearly expecting and got to the point. “Yes, well,” he said, “are you aware, Rita, that being an unregistered animagus is a five year sentence in Azkaban? And that’s without all the breach of privacy lawsuits that would undoubtedly follow if anyone were to find out you’d been
A new Lord is introduced.
Harry ended it there and Draco could feel Hadrian’s shoulders shaking with mirth. The affronted look on Molly Weasley’s face was something Draco would savour for years to come. His Mother would undoubtedly love to see the memory. She loathed the Weasley matriarch.
was, however.
“I’ve become rather good a glamour spells and have been receiving healing potions from my dear Uncle here since the summer of ‘93,” Hadrian gestured to Tom and Skeeter seemed startled to remember they weren’t alone in the room. She eyed the glamoured Dark Lord and seemed to find a suitable amount of familial resemblance to accept this unknown as Harry Potter’s Uncle and turned back to a now un-glamoured Hadrian. “So, what Hadrian Peverell looks like, is closer to what Harry Potter has looked like for a while now. Not that anyone but Uncle Tom has seen me without a glamour for a very long time.”
“Good evening, gentlemen. I am Hadrian Corvus Peverell. It is a pleasure to see you all again.”
Draco was finding it exceedingly hard to keep an appetite as he sat in the dining room of Peverell Manor. Sat across from his father, to the right of the Dark Lord was Hadrian Peverell, looking completely content with a little blonde sitting on his lap. His strong arm was wrapped around her waist as he fed her food, straight from his plate. There was a slight smudge of red on Lovegood’s pulse point, making it glaringly obvious that the Vampire Lord had spent the better part of the day feeding off the young woman.
“You have all seen the
“P-otter?” he said with a break in his voice he was not proud of and would never admit to anyone.
“Now, drink,” she pulled his head down to rest in the crook of her neck and Hadrian was overwhelmed by the complete rightness of her scent. He licked up her pulse, numbing the area with his venom, positioned his mouth right above her lifeblood and sank his fangs into the pure, creamy skin of her neck. The taste of her exploded in his mouth, sweet and unyielding and completely
of explaining to do.”
your veins.
Anyway, enough rambling. Happy Reading to you all!
“Second year was all Lucius really, wasn’t it Tom?” Hadrian said. Eyes full of mischief as the Malfoy Lord paled considerably and shrunk even further into the couch. Severus decided that he needed to have a chat with Narcissa. They needed to keep a closer eye on the blonde prat before he got himself killed.
(See the end of the chapter for
A blush ran up Hadrian’s neck before he could repress it, not used to having compliments directed at his body. “No, not all of it. It fixed my eyes and gave me a little height and muscle definition, but I’ve been wearing a glamour since you started sending me nutrient potions over the summer. I’ve been working on not being the scrawny git the twins call me, so most of this is just me. I also managed to figure out enough of my metamorphmagus ability to change the gravity defying hair and cover my scar.”
Greedy looks were now appearing over the two youngest Weasleys and Granger as Sirius observed with disgust. He truly commended Hadrian’s ability to be in the same room as them, knowing what they’d done to him. Anticipation rose within him as he wondered just how many secrets Harry was going to reveal this morning.
dramatics. The ‘good guys’ were just supposed to get shit done.
again for a very long time. “You, my dear Lucius, have to understand that, while my Hadrian may be young, he ranks above you in every aspect of society and he will not stop until you have learnt your place.”
This chapter has a bit more action than you're probably used to. Tom and Hadrian make a show of being magically powerful just to get on people's nerves but there's nothing overly graphic so if you're squeamish, don't worry.
“And what vow is that exactly, Severus,” Tom said, his voice suddenly dripping with barely concealed threat.
So! We've got our introduction sorted, we know where everyone is, we know some basic plans and what people are trying to do and now it's time to get down to business.
“Percy Ignatius Weasley,” Harry continued. “You will be established as a Friend of House Potter, with the same conditions as Bill and Charlie, and I have left you with a letter. I hope you know that I’ve always thought of you as another big brother and you should be proud of your achievements over the years.”
Hadrian chuckled, baring his teeth in what might possibly pass as a smile when Lucius caught his eye. He wasn’t very happy with the Malfoy Lord at the moment and he hoped Draco had managed to talk some sense into the man before he entered the room. Hadrian was already in a bad mood. He didn’t need Lucius making it worse.
“Yes, I am,” he said and glanced at Tom. He knew where this was going too and was ready to back Hadrian up if he needed. “I was homeschooled for a while but Uncle Tom decided I needed a chance to network before taking my NEWTs, especially after taking up my Lordship. I’ll be at Hogwarts for my seventh year this year.”
Luna didn’t particularly care about Avery’s mind at the moment. He had insulted both her Lord and herself at this point and that was unforgivable within the Wolves. Avery was not a Wolf, however, so she supposed she had better leave Lord Voldemort with a sane Death Eater. Luna released the curse and Avery’s screams watered down to whimpers at her feet. She reached down to the crying man before her and grasped his chin in her delicate hands. Forcing him to meet her eyes. “We’ll try that again, little bird. What was it you said to my Lord that upset him so?”
Severus knelt before Lord Thanatos basking in the feel of his unmasked magic. He used to think there couldn’t be a single person whose magic was more intoxicating than the Dark Lord’s.
The blonde opened his mouth, no doubt to stammer some weak retort about his worth in the eyes of his son, but Tom lifted a hand to silence him, nothing but finality in his tone. “He is far more capable of looking after young Draco than you will ever be Lucius, so cease with this useless pacing and figure out a way to get on my Hadrian’s good side so I no longer have to field your petty arguments and Draco no longer feels caught between the two of you. Because, dear Lucius, I can assure you that if he has to choose between his father and the powerful Vampire Lord who has taken his fancy, your Draco would
“No, Lucius, I think you should address me with my full title tonight.” Peverell said, malice veiled behind a pleasantly sweet expression. Severus thought it was likely more terrifying than the anger he displayed just moments before. “That would be Lord Peverell-Ravenclaw-Black-Potter, to you,” the young Vampire said and Lucius’ eyes widened.
(See the end of the chapter for
having Hadrian around. He was always so entertaining… and in the most creative ways! Tom never would have thought to punish Lucius by making him play host to
“That you have a plan -” the other said.
“Are you okay working with him, considering the past between the two of you? Do you think you can look past all that adversary?” Draco was surprised his Father was asking. He thought he was being obvious, especially in his own home, about the way he felt about Harry Potter. Well, Hadrian Peverell now.
willing to incur either of their wraths.
“That is his complete medical history and the scan after his treatment with the Goblins this morning. Take a look and brew anything you think he should take. I will handle getting him to actually take them. You may begin now.”
Lucius was very confused. Very, very confused and getting more so every second he was in this room. Did Severus just say ‘Potter’? As in

to give the Weasley twins a detention. Sirius loved good old Minnie. She never changed.
He risked a glance at Hadrian, realising the Vampire Lord’s eyes were glued to the Weasel as the red-head worked himself into another rage.
“There are a few conditions Harry set in order for the two of you to formally become Friends of the House Potter,” Hadrian began, addressing the two Weasleys across from him. “If those conditions are met, there will be a great many benefits that come with your new status, including the opportunity to seek unquestioned sanctuary with me if at any point, should you require it.”
There were gasps from the three who had never seen it before and Barty felt immensely proud to bare the beautiful mark of his Lord.
Thanks ever so muchly to my beta Liz. She's a godsend when it comes to correcting the grammar I butcher because I know what it's meant to say, but don't necessarily type it that way.
This chapter is a little monster so I hope you enjoy! Plot's starting up properly now so buckle up for some Dumbles having a hard time.
“That is good to know,” Luna shivered as her Lord’s voice rumbled through her skin. She could feel the tension in his body and knew he would have to feed soon. Instances of high emotion had seemed to drain him since his change. Or maybe it was the presence of his unclaimed mate.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry’s voice spoke next and the Weasel, Weaselette and Granger gasped.
“Now, I don’t blame you for not noticing, I’ll admit, I’m a damn good actor. But just one of you to believe me when I told you some of what was going on would have been nice. Just know that, if one of you had paid a little more attention, I might not be dead right now.”
Harry Potter is going to die, and be replaced with something better, something he really should have been all along. It would have saved him some extremely unnecessary betrayal.”
“And,” Harry continued, a mischievous glint in his eyes, “you guys are
This is another long one so I hope that makes up for it being a little late... enjoy! :)
Hadrian Peverell chuckled and Draco had to lock his knees. That sound made his knees weak and he would
for a month. Where the boy came up with these things, Tom didn’t know, but he was definitely keeping the cheeky brat around for as long as he could.
“Yes, my Lord,” Lucius said, trusting that his Lord would know if the boy turned out to be something dangerous.
“My - my Lord, I do not think it wise -,” Avery started looking only at the crimson eyed Lord beside her, before Luna took things into her own hands. This piece of filth had said something to anger her Lord and now had the nerve to undermine his authority. He was the most powerful being in this world and deserved their undying respect. Avery would not walk out of this room without knowing so, if Luna had anything to say about it.
Longbottom bowed to Hadrian with a muttered ‘my Lord’ and Draco noticed that, not once, had any of the newcomers paid respect to the second Dark Lord in the room. He chanced a glance at Lord Voldemort and was surprised to see his face showed clear amusement. Nothing of the blinding rage he would have shown had one of his Death Eaters entered a room without acknowledging him.
Sirius couldn’t breathe.
“Yes, they’ve, that’s Dumbles, the Weasleys, Granger and the Order, have been trying to dictate my life with absolutely no success since I was eleven. They’ve given me everything I could possibly need to make their lives a living hell and win the war for the Dark without Voldie-pants here having to lift a finger.”
had been waiting for this day for too long. It was time to walk, fully, into the Dark.
“I managed to make a cheap replica of the stone, steal the real one and get a vow of non-combatants from old grumpy-face here all before Christmas. The test at the end of the year was all for show and I’m honestly still baffled that the man was so completely fooled by an eleven year old and a clinically insane wraith. He really is getting old.”
Anyway, hope you enjoy this next chapter. I was a hard one to churn out and I hope all the PoV jumping isn't too confusing. Things will start to pick up after all the explanations are done
Before Ragnok could answer Hadrian spoke up. “It’s a Hebridean Black,” he said and all eyes snapped back to him. It really was so satisfying to be able to control a room this way. “Ironically enough, it was in the Black Archive vault.”
The Malfoy Lord’s face flared at the nickname and Severus was amused to note the Dark Lord snorting into his whiskey glass, clearly enjoying the entertainment. Even though the Dark Lord was back to being as sane as he was when Severus pledged his loyalty, if not saner, the Dark Lord still enjoyed the humiliation of his followers every now and then. Or maybe it was just Lucius.
ego. Let alone someone as dependent on public opinion for his own self worth as Lucius Malfoy. “You also have to remember that Hadrian has taken a liking to your son and he, in his basest form, is a very territorial being. He’s trying to prove to Draco that he is better equipped to take care of your young heir than you, yourself are Lucius.”
“Thank you so much for this honour, my Lord,” Lupin said, shaking slightly with what Tom assumed was residual magic running through his body. He wondered how it felt, exactly, to submit to someone so freely, to be so controlled by one person that your very magic is linked to theirs. He didn’t think he wanted to find out, no matter how good some people seemed to think it felt. He was used to being in charge and he didn’t think he would give that up for anyone.
“Your glamour?” Severus asked his face mirroring the inquisitive ones of both Malfoys sitting beside him.
A low growl rippled out of Hadrian’s chest and Draco felt the unexpected need to sink to his knees. He steeled himself as Hadrian spoke, “Neville, introduce yourselves, we’ll be down in time for dinner. Twins, play nice.” And just like that, Hadrian Peverell whisked Luna Lovegood out of the room and disappeared. Draco could only hope that maybe, after all this time, he and Hadrian could just be friends.
So sorry this is a day late! Easter caught up with me and I barely made it out alive... All that chocolate.
They watched as McGonagall told Dumbledore that these were the worst kind of muggles she’d ever seen. As Dumbledore dismissed her comments with meaningless words about family and love and not letting fame get to the boy’s head. And as a sobbing Hagrid placed baby Harry on the doorstep with nothing but a blanket and a letter.
“I merely suggested, Ms Lovegood, that his Lordship might as well have Weasleys for followers for all the good they do for the cause.” Avery’s voice was barely above a whisper and Luna could see he was shaking like a leaf.
“Yes, my Lord,” Severus replied, putting the scroll in an inner pocket of his robes. Not trusting himself to look at it now, knowing he would have an extremely adverse reaction to the information contained on the scroll. He stood, bowing to his Lord and exited the office, he had potions to brew.
Hadrian Peverell did something completely unexpected. He laughed.
“I want out of the Harry Potter shitshow, Rita, so in two days time, you will receive a package of documents detailing Harry Potter’s trip to Gringotts on the 17th of June. It includes a medical report detailing all the potions in his system from Dumbledore and the long lasting injuries and malnutrition he suffered at the hands of his relatives. There will also be proof that Harry Potter accepted his Potter and Black lordships on the 17th of June, some of the more public aspects of his Will and a letter to you that includes an autobiographical account of his life and states you will only receive the package in the event of his death.”
Minerva McGonagall sat primly to the left of Remus, looking very much like she would
Gasps came from both Malfoys and Severus who were shocked beyond belief that someone would dare talk to their Lord in that manner. Barty just smothered an amused snort, slightly more used to the way the two Lords interacted, but
Explanations and Memories
“Well, Rita darling, that’s the best part,” Hadrian said with a mischievous glint in his eye that would rival the Weasley twins. “You see, I am Harry Potter.”
“Very good Rita, now, what do you know about Harry Potter’s home life?” Rita looked momentarily shocked at the question but managed to school her features fairly quickly. Hadrian was a little impressed, but then again, Skeeter was a Slytherin in her time.
The next series of memories made Draco and three of the Dark Lord’s most ruthless followers sick to their stomach. They may have condoned the torture of blood-traitors and muggles, people who deserved it, who had done the world and magic wrong. Never, had they seen this level of torture on a child who, for all that anyone knew, had done nothing more than possess the gift of magic in his blood.
Thanks as always to my amazing Beta Liz. Her comments on my doc are worth publishing on their own they make me laugh so much. And thank you to all you lovely people who get so excited about this fic in the comments. It really helps when the writing gets tough and just makes my narcissistic ass feel validated.
“What has amused you so, Little Moon?” he enquired, sounding genuinely interested. It was one of the things Luna loved most about her Lord; when she was talking to him, he actually paid attention. She hadn’t experienced that much before she met her Lord and treasured him all the more for making her feel welcome.

I am so very sorry this took so long! This chapter fought me from the very beginning and I was going to just post it then forget it ever existed but I figured I needed to make it as good as I could for you all. So, I stepped back for a little bit then FINALLY got it done to an acceptable standard and I hope that you all enjoy a little more drama.
Draco didn’t know whether he should be happy he guessed the identity of this new Lord correctly or not. Draco loved being right, he really did. But the idea that he was crushing
It was apparent that Tom assumed wrong, however, as Lucius Malfoy himself was pacing the Dark Lord’s study muttering incoherently at the audacity of Hadrian Peverell’s latest insult to his character. The group of wolves as well as Draco and Severus had recently departed with Hadrian to Gringotts for Harry Potter’s will reading (another thought that greatly amused the Dark Lord and he hoped Hadrian would be willing to share the memories upon his return). During their journey to the floo, Lucius had expressed the intent of accompanying his son to the bank to ensure his heir’s protection, despite knowing the Goblins would never let him enter without an invitation and not having received one. His mistrust of Hadrian’s ability was clear with his actions and Hadrian did not take kindly to the insult. He was the more powerful of the two Lords and Lucius should have known not to question Hadrian’s ability to protect his guests.
“Good, Nev, has Sirius been in touch with -” Hadrian stopped as the floo roared again and a small, blonde girl glided out of the fireplace. Hadrian was by her side in a flash and Draco watched as the girl, Luna Lovegood if he remembered correctly, looked up into Hadrian’s eyes and smiled. “My Lord,” she said and Draco’s heart sank as Hadrian pulled the girl into a tight hug, nuzzling his nose against her neck, breathing in her scent. Well damn, he thought. She must be his mate.
could be heard before Hadrian stopped the memory.
This couldn’t be happening! Severus’ life was about to get much more complicated. He was not looking forward to it.
is merely up to its old tricks again and, in an attempt to further besmirch both my and young Harry’s name, has merely conjured up something to get the public going.” Dumbledore stood over them with kind, genial eyes while he spoke and Sirius had to suppress a snort. The old fool
The Ministry is now requesting the presence of Azkaban escapee Sirius Black so he can receive his long awaited trial and has assured me they are taking measures to prevent gross misconduct of this nature happening again.
It didn’t escape Draco’s notice that he seemed to have drifted closer to the vampire as the reading continued. Their hands were still clasped, their knees frequently pressed together and their shoulders brushed with the movement of their barely concealed laughter. Draco was once again fighting down a blush. He desperately hoped Hadrian wasn’t taking this the wrong way.
“Leave the bottle,” Tom asked the small creature as it returned with the amber liquid and six glasses. “We’re going to need it.”
“Of course he will, my Lord.” She gasped as his long fangs pierced her skin. Blood, hot and sweet rushed into Hadrian’s mouth as he sucked  at his donor’s pulse. He pulled away after a few mouthfuls, delirious look on his face as he licked the wound closed, pulled down his wards and leaned back in his chair.
There were many things the boy could know that would make Albus seem like a truly despicable person out of context. He doubted the
“The last thing is the most confusing and kinda just happened after I was purged of all the blocks and stuff" Hadrian said, looking down at his hands awkwardly for a moment. "Apparently I was supposed to get my creature inheritance on my 17th birthday and, of course because I’m Harry fucking Potter, I’m something that hasn’t been seen in about 500 years. An elemental Vampire, or a Living Vampire.” Tom’s eyebrows rose at that.
Sirius’ eyes snapped back to the stranger in the room, studying his features, as he quickly pulled Remus to the seats directly opposite the man who could be his son. There were definitely similarities. The same high cheekbones he inherited from Sirius’ father, the same straight nose as James and those eyes... there was no denying that this was Harry Potter. No one had eyes that green but his son.
I do not own Harry Potter
Harry rose, offering his hand before the two Marauders could be fully seated. “Hadrian Peverell, it’s a pleasure to meet you, despite the circumstances of course,” he said with a wink in Remus’ direction. Sirius shook the offered hand, relishing in the flare of warmth from the mark on his left shoulder and seated himself at the table.
this morning, I’m sure,” Dumbledore said. Sirius had spent a long time observing the man without the hero-worship fog obscuring him, and even he was hard pressed to notice the slight tension in Dumbledore’s jaw as he spoke. The old man was as good an actor as they come. Though Sirius was convinced his son was equally good, if not better, if even half the things he expected that boy got up to were true. “And it seems we have a problem on our hands,” the old man continued.
“What kind of information would Harry even have?” Molly Weasley spoke up and Sirius had to agree.
(See the end of the chapter for
on the Dark Lord’s new partner did however, make Draco rather apprehensive. This was someone who could probably kill him without a second thought. Someone who’s magic felt almost as deadly as the Dark Lord’s. And someone who, apparently, had the trust and alliance of said Dark Lord. Things could go rather wrong for Draco if his attraction was noticed by these powerful men.
As soon as the door snapped shut behind Draco Hadrian let out an almost feral snarl. Shocking the room doubly when he stepped right into the face of Charlie
He looked conflicted for a moment before striding forward on those long legs of his and elegantly lowering himself into the wrought iron chair opposite hers. “How are you this morning, Draco?” she asked in an attempt to break the ice. There were a great many things Luna could say to the blonde now, but she knew her Lord had plans and, as much as she knew Hadrian was going about this the long way, Luna would not get in his way.
Hadrian turned to the veritable goddess sitting on the edge of his large four poster bed. Her silver blonde hair shining in the light streaming in from the window. She looked ethereal, beautiful and positively
In a shocking turn of events last night the British Wizengamot has a new Chief Warlock for the first time in 16 years. The British Lords and Ladies met late last night when it became apparent Albus Dumbledore no longer qualified to be Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. After no more than an hour of discussion it was announced that the Dark Alliance now had the majority and Lord Lucius Malfoy would be taking up the position in Mr. Dumbledore’s stead.
Hadrian nodded gracefully and stood to show his wolves to the floo room, running his hand along the back of the young Malfoy’s chair as he passed. Tom chuckled. Oh to be young and in love, he mused. How disgusting.
“That’s probably why the vow hasn’t acted up,” Severus muttered to himself.
Enjoy :)
They stood together for what felt like hours, while the Ministry workers cleared the area. Both distraught at the thought that their little pack was another member down.
And he’d been working for Albus Dumbledore for sixteen years.
“We will be stationing a guard outside his relatives house again this summer,” Dumbledore continued, “as I believe this article will bring danger to dear Harry. The Death Eaters will no doubt be doubling their efforts to find him and this so called ‘dangerous information.’”
“You, of course, have the opportunity now to decline Harry’s offer and go on your merry way,” Hadrian said, with a hint of a smirk across his lips. “But know that as soon as you accept, you will be required to carry out the full month before you can return to your normal lives.” Hadrian flicked his wand slightly and a pile of parchment appeared in front of him. He shuffled through the stack, found what he was looking for and passed it over to William. “This is Harry’s instructions to me in case you were doubting my credibility. You can check its authenticity if you want.”
“No, Severus,” Lord Thanatos said walking around his desk to stand directly in front of Severus’ bowed form, “I don’t think you will.”
needed to work on his excuses. “I am sure there is no information that Mr Potter will be able to pass over, should he be captured, but the boy must stay firmly within the hands of the Light. He is our hope for the end of this war after all.”
Ronald was screaming himself hoarse but no one paid him any attention as Ragnok’s silencing charm still rendered him mute. Hadrian’s shoulder brushed against Draco’s as they both tried desperately to conceal their thoughts on the hilarity of the situation.
Mundungus Fletcher, the piece of human waste that he was, was already passed out in the corner by the fire. Kreature poked his prone, unresponsive form with a look of pure disgust on his face. Sirius realised he would have to give the Elf something nice after this if he was to remain on speaking terms with the crazy old thing.
The vampire saw red.
Tom snorted at the look of intrigue that crossed Skeeter’s face. Though the threats so far had been clear, it was obvious Skeeter would not need much persuasion in the face of such a potentially scandalising story.
Fred and George looked truly gobsmacked. Draco had to appreciate the gift that Harry was clearly giving the two. They had never been from a well-off family and didn’t seem like the sort to accept charity or favours. Harry had essentially set Fred and George up for life.
Hope all the explanations aren't boring you too much! Hang in there, there's mate and donor talk coming up soon!
His gaze reached the Vampire Lord’s eye and suddenly, Draco was hit with an overwhelming sense of familiarity. He had seen those dazzling emerald eyes before. Stared into them as he sprouted words of pure loathing. Watched them religiously across the Great Hall every day for the past five years. He had seen almost every emotion possible in those giant green orbs. How had he not recognised him earlier?
“At the end of the month,” Hadrian continued, “you will come to me and outline your experience, how you felt about it and we’ll go from there.” Incredulity was present on the Weasley’s faces as Hadrian paused. They clearly thought this whole plan was crazy, but Draco could see the appeal. Letting the eldest Weasley boys see how they
“I will not force this kind of connection on him Luna, you know that,” he said as his fangs dragged along her skin. “He will come to me when he wants me.”
Just as she grew bored watching Avery whimper, holding his arm to his chest and unable to stand up from his prostrated position, the double doors at the end of the room opened. Two tall, forest green cloaked figures entered with their hoods up. They walked regally through the mass, stunned silent before them, and up to the dais. With a low bow to their Lord and a respectful incline of the head to Lord Voldemort, the demons addressed Lord Thanatos.
“Yes, I have an meeting set up day after tomorrow.”
“Nonsense, Draco,” Luna replied, leaving out more of her airy tone than usual. She knew Draco was uncomfortable in her presence at the moment and didn’t want to scare him away. They would have to be able to get along after all. Their Lord would not be getting rid of either of them for a
to be able to inherit, but he still had power to his name and money in his vaults. And he would never have let the old man in
He could get anything he wanted with just a smile and his wide, innocent eyes. He managed to completely fool the entire world into thinking he was the epitome of light for six years. All that while being the most observed teenager in wizarding Britain and after dealing with his horrible childhood. Barty was proud of his Lord and was so thankful to Tom for allowing him to change his mark. It was the best decision he had ever made.
. Slytherins were good at looking out for themselves, so when someone came along that was stronger than they were, they didn’t hesitate to make sure they were in good favour.
“I don’t think those were the exact words you used little bird,” she said and the answering growl from her Lord confirmed. “But oh, what the Fire Demons will do to you. You’ll be surrounded by blibbering humdingers for weeks” A glance at her Lord and she knew he had summoned the demons in question. “While we wait…” she raised her wand again and fired a quick succession of silent spells. His left arm shattered, his kneecaps disappeared and he was left with the feeling of spiders crawling over every inch of his skin. As Avery’s cries echoed through the room, Luna made her way back over to her Lord. She curtseyed low again then plopped back down onto his lap to watch the rest of the meeting fold out.
“Well, I decided a few years ago that I no longer wanted to be Dumbledore’s puppet. He knew what was going on at my Aunt’s and refused to allow me to stay anywhere else when I asked him before summer every year. Every year something stupidly life-threatening happens at Hogwarts and he has resorted to very underhanded tactics to get me to comply with his plans. When I went to Gringotts when I got off the train this summer, I needed a Goblin grade purging ritual to clear my system of all the compulsion and personality altering potions he had fed me over the years.”
A laugh from Barty caused all occupants of the office to look at him. “You guys are going to love this,” he said, giving Hadrian a look of complete adoration before turning back to the clueless in the room. “My Lord has been deceiving you all for such a long time, he truly is brilliant.”
“Luna this is going to be harder than I thought.” He ran his nose along the line of her neck, breathing in her scent, salivating at the steady beat of her pulse under his touch. An impulsive decision and a quick wave of his hand put a privacy ward around the pair, blocking them out from the rest of the Peverell Manor sitting room.
Across the room, his beautiful blonde mate looked at the pair with unmasked jealousy written across his face. Hadrian knew he wouldn’t have to wait long before either he or Draco snapped.
“I honestly have no idea Lucius.” Hadrian said slowly, meeting the eyes of the Malfoy Lord. “I had managed to break through some of the binding on my own, so by the time I got to the Goblins this morning only 35% of my core was blocked. I have no idea why I was able to survive, let alone go through all the things I did a school without the full capacity of my magic available. The Goblins said my core must have been
“Do you know who they are, my Lord,” Draco asked, and Lucius had to suppress the urge to whack his son upside the head. You didn’t just ask the Dark Lord questions like that, no matter how good a mood he seemed to be in.
“Well Lucy,” Peverell drawled, a hint of a growl lacing his voice. “As I have proven to you already, you don’t know me.” The arm wrapped protectively around the Lovegood girl tightened and Peverell’s eyes flicked briefly to Draco.
“Your Uncle was in a meeting with my father when I happened upon them, Hadrian,” Draco explained as he made his way back to his seat. Hadrian noted the slight smirk on his face and wondered how much the Malfoy heir had already been aware of his father’s tendency to speak before thinking and getting himself in trouble. If he knew that Lucius was likely to get in more trouble than he could conceivably handle if he spoke out against Hadrian for the third time in as many days.
Looking at Lucius now, he could tell the blonde’s tail would be between his legs for a while. Especially when Tom had a talk with him as he was doubtless to do.
. It just didn’t make sense. And the way his son was looking at the boy; with ill concealed awe and attraction... Lucius needed answers and he needed them now.
. Hadrian watched as Luna pulled her hair into a messy bun atop her head, bearing a long line of silky smooth, white skin. “I think I might have a type, little moon,” Hadrian said as he walked slowly over to the bed.
The Dark Lord chuckled at the appraising look Severus gave to the vampire. “Among other things?” Severus drawled. Trying not to be amused at the young man’s gallows humour.
Bowing low, the demon twins thanked their Lord sincerely and rounded on the wounded little bird, grabbing an arm each and dragging him out the door. Luna smirked darkly as she thought of all the wonderful products the twins were currently working on down in their lab, and the truly terrible things they could do to poor Avery.
Well... I'm back!
Severus didn’t even want to think about the dismissive tone Peverell used when saying that. This boy always managed to give him a headache, secret prodigy or not.
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this new chapter!
Severus snorted. He knew Petunia Dursley nee Evans and he had to agree, there was no abundance of brain cells in her horse-like head. In fact, he would have attributed the lack of intelligence Potter seemed to display to her influence, had the old coot ever seen fit to inform him that's where he placed the boy all those years ago.
The two Black women looked contented as they felt the Family magic return to them. Draco could relate and absently wondered whether Hadrian could get Andromeda to talk to his Mother. He knew she missed her eldest sister greatly, especially since Aunt Bella was still halled up in Azkaban. Perhaps the traditional meeting of the Black Family when the new Lord was officially appointed would serve as an opportunity to reacquaint the estranged sisters.
Black and Lupin were directed to the loveseat Draco had previously eyed, and Draco had to chuckle at the light blush that sprouted on both men’s cheeks. It was highly amusing that Harry Potter set up his own father in his last will and testament. It was such a Potter thing to do that Draco couldn’t help but admire it.
“Lord Peverell is correct,” Ragnok spoke up, “the late Lord Potter-Black has requested that you all remain attentive for the final aspect of his Will.” The vicious grin the Goblin sported spoke only of pain for the occupants of the room. Well, at least for those opposing Harry Potter.
Sirius transformed into Padfoot the moment his feet touched the ground. He looked around at the chaos that stood before him. Aurors and Obliviators were herding the Muggles back into their houses, away from the smouldering remains of Number 4 Privet Drive.
“I never did kill the basilisk, Draco, but I did find the sword of Gryffindor while I was down in the Chamber.” Peverell said gazing intently at Severus’ godson with a look in his eye that confirmed his earlier suspicions. He was going to have to look out for anyone that would become a threat to the blonde boy, lest he have to deal with a potentially homicidal and extremely protective Vampire. “I’ll show them both to you one day, if you like?”
of London Gringotts as the executor of his will) was a tall, strongly built young man Sirius had never seen before. He was naturally tanned, had dark raven black hair down to his shoulders in a style fairly reminiscent of the Black Family, pulled back at the base of his neck in the traditional pureblood fashion. There was something strikingly familiar about the man but Sirius couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
“WHAT?” Hadrian was slightly surprised the enraged shout that rang through the room came from the Malfoy Lord. Lucius’ perfect pureblood demeanour was completely cast aside as he stood, silver eyes shining with righteous fury. Hadrian felt for sure Severus would be the first to start yelling, but the dark Potions Master was just staring at Hadrian, frozen in shock.
The room was silent as everyone looked at the Headmaster in shock. Was this real? Was Harry Potter really abused by his relatives? The Headmaster himself looked furious at the accusation that he refused to save Harry Potter and Sirius was suddenly very certain that it was all Albus fucking Dumbledore’s idea. He wondered if Hadrian had proof and just how vindictive his revenge would be. Personally, Sirius couldn’t wait.
“Unless, of course it was Voldemort who killed me,” Harry added, seemingly as an afterthought. “Then I just hope I took the old snake-faced bastard down with me.”
The cupboard under the stairs.
A minuscule smile crawled its way onto Sirius’ face. He had hoped but now he had confirmation; his son really was fine and oh Merlin was he going to get an ass kicking for making Sirius worry so much. He understood of course, Sirius’ reaction had to be genuine or the Order and old Dumbles would have been suspicious but a little more warning would have been nice. Stupid kid with his insanely smart but incredibly reckless plans. Sirius didn’t know where he got it from.
Then came the moment Tom had been waiting for; Hadrian asked the wolf if he wanted to be marked.
A growl rippled through her Lord’s chest and his verdant gaze locked back onto the prostrated form on the tiles below. “Why don’t you tell her, Avery, exactly what it was you said to me.” The disdain in his voice clear for the room to hear. It wasn’t often her Lord allowed so much emotion to bleed through his masks in a public setting. Avery must have been very stupid indeed.
“I think what you mean to say, little bird, is ‘yes, my Lord Thanatos’ and then you answer his question.” Her voice was as light and airy as always but held the glint of steel her Lord had honed into his most powerful weapon. Luna was much more capable, more ruthless, than anyone save her Lord knew.
“As far as I can see, the likelihood of me deceiving you of all people, and getting away with it, is considerably more likely than your ego is able to admit. So, I will ignore this rude outburst and kindly ask you to return to your seat before you see what threatening me in the presence of those that are
This is just a very brief introduction to some new and exciting characters. There is some blood drinking in this chapter but, Hadrian's a vampire so it was bound to come eventually. Nothing too graphic or horrible though.
to the face. “Do you think this will be enough to push the public opinion over the edge? Mistreatment of the Boy-Who-Lived should go straight to the front page of the
Tom was amused. Something that seemed to be happening a lot more now Hadrian Peverell was a constant in his life. The boy was young and exciting and just a breath of fresh air after all the stuffy pureblood traditionalists Tom had spent most of his life around.
Charlie opened the paper at his first morning in Malfoy Manor and gasped. He knew he should have expected this, it should have been obvious as soon as Lucius Malfoy was so blatantly ordered to house him and his brother by the Lord Peverell, but for some reason it shocked him.
Severus stalked into the house he had only seen in memories. It was painfully clean, reeking of chemicals and synthetic fabrics you would never find in the Wizarding World. That a young wizard as enamoured with magic as Hadrian Peverell had to grow up in such an oppressive muggle environment and managed to be even slightly sane, was a testament to Peverell’s strength of character. If he had lived here, Severus was sure he would have strung Petunia Dursley up by her painfully polyester floral patterned curtains within a week.
Hadrian sat back in his seat, positively smug at this new information. “I must thank you Lady Malfoy, it seems this all just got a lot easier.”
throughout the British Isles. Every name I hold is older and richer and more respected than the Malfoy name and, if you push me Lucius, I have thousands of years to watch as every Malfoy who thinks themselves better than me falls. And they will know it is all your fault.”
“I admit I’m not sure Mr. Peverell. I’ve had two interviews with the boy, in his fourth and fifth year, though I never had the chance to ask him more than a few questions, what with Tri-wizard tournament going on and the Ministry breathing down my neck about You-Know-Who. You seem to think that his childhood is something worth talking about, though, Mr. Peverell?”
Draco succumbed to a sudden need to comfort the vampire beside him and grabbed Hadrian’s hand under the table. Interlocking their fingers and giving the man something to ground himself with. Even though he doubted he was Hadrian’s mate, he hoped he could give the Vampire even the smallest amount of comfort.
“Why don’t we join Barty for a drink?” He walked over to the fire and Tom summoned a House Elf to fetch firewhisky and some light food.
I hope you all like what I'm doing with Sirius. I love him and he didn't deserve to die in this story too, so he won't
“Tom and I talked for a bit, came up with a story and I went on my way back to Hogwarts with Cedric’s body. I told Dumbledore the truth; that Pettigrew portkeyed us to one of the Dark Lord’s bases in order to kill me. He killed Cedric as soon as we landed and I managed to hold Pettigrew off until I could get back to the Cup.” At the confused look the room was giving him, Hadrian chuckled a little.
Severus watched as his friend’s face got considerably paler as Lord Peverell continued to talk. He re-organised his mental schedule to make sure he spoke to Narcissa as soon as possible. He didn’t think Peverell would ruin Draco but he had to make sure Lucius knew his place.
A look over at Albus Dumbledore and Draco could tell this reading was not going as the old man planned. That Hadrian was so capable of making the Headmaster wrongfooted was immensely attractive to Draco. A thumb stroking against the back of his hand alerted Draco to the fact he was still holding the Vampire’s hand. He couldn’t help thinking their hands fit together perfectly.
Draco Malfoy was his mate.
“I’m sure you all noticed I am a Vampire,” Hadrian said to the room. Barty was listening closely again, not having heard anything about his Lord’s creature inheritance yet. “I’m more than just your average Vampire though, I’m what they call a Living Vampire.”
“Father, I’ve liked Harry Potter for three years. That he’s now a living Vampire, a budding Dark Lord and even hotter than the last time I saw him only makes it better, makes him that much harder to resist.” Draco said honestly. There was a time for hiding the truth, and in the company of his Father was not that time. In fact, Draco was sure Lucius would have figured it out very soon with the way he was watching Draco throughout the meeting.
‘The DMLE is working as swiftly as possible to rectify this mistake and a trial for both Peter Pettegrew and Sirius Black has been scheduled for the 3rd of July.’
“Severus, the Goblins did that already,” he said quietly and looked deep into the eyes of the frantic Potions Master. “I’m perfectly fine now, clean bill of heath with the Goblin seal of approval.”
“This concludes the last will and testament of Harry James Potter-Black, Lord Potter, Lord Black. I wish half of you a very long and happy rest of your lives, and to the other half; fuck off and I’ll see you all in hell,” Harry finished, sadistic mirth in his eyes and the image faded. The orb stopped glowing indicating the end of Harry Potter’s will reading and Ragnok rose from his seat at the head of the table and nodded to Hadrian. He would be taking Griphook to retrieve the items Harry had bequeathed and returning to distribute them accordingly.
“I’m Hadrian Peverell,” he said, and Dumbledore leaned forward slightly at the mention of his last name. Hadrian had had enough last names to choose from, Sirius wondered why he had chosen one that interested Dumbledore so much. “I’m here for the same reason everyone else is, because I got a letter stating I was mentioned in Harry Potter’s will. The Goblins would not have allowed me in this room if I were not invited.”
Severus noticed the young Vampire’s eyes flick to Draco yet again and a sense of dread worked its way into his stomach. He had a feeling Peverell knew exactly who his mate was and was going to be especially irritable until that bond was claimed. Lucius was sure to be on the receiving end of a lot of Vampire ire when Draco was around if he continued to deny Peverell’s authority.
I'd also like to thank my Beta Liz for being the set of eyes I need after looking at the same 3000 words for two weeks. You're a saint.
about Draco Malfoy in that way again and they will be finding your remains for centuries. Believe me, I have the time.”
“The only reason I haven’t already taken action against your disrespect, Lucius, is because your Lord likes you for some reason that I will never understand. I do not want to ruin your son and the pride he has in your Family name but I will if you continue to push me. Do you understand Lucius?”
Hadrian and Tom throw their name and money around and Dumbledore catches wind of the new players in town.
Harry was smart. Scarily so. So Sirius knew there was a reason Harry had sent him that note and he didn’t think it was just to comfort him. At least he
“My family has lived in many places over the years but returned to Britain in the seventeenth century. Amarantha Peverell married Ralston Potter and, due to Ralston’s unpopular status within his own family, the couple’s son carried the Peverell name. I have both Potter and Peverell blood, much like Harry. Though mine is distinctly more Peverell and Harry’s distinctly more Potter. It is a shame that we never got the chance to meet. I think I would have liked my cousin.”
“Ah, Tom?” Hadrian asked, uncharacteristically uncertain as he questioned the Dark Lord. He was worried he was about to come off as pushy or disrespectful to someone who had already gone above and beyond for the young Vampire. “Yes, Hadrian. You know you’re allowed to ask questions here. You are, after all, my equal, brat.” Tom said, his fondness for the teen shining through his ruby eyes.
“As it so happens,” Lord Thanatos continued a hint of a snarl entering his voice as his magic continued to suffocate the room, “I have found you a new test subject.” He inclined his head in Avery’s direction and the twins shared a manic grin. The room around them was silent except for Avery’s whimpers and Luna wondered whether anyone else
would not have just been left on Dumbledore’s desk for him to return to. It was a special edition and Sirius could only imagine what the headline would be. Something had happened to Harry.
And if Albus Dumbledore came away from this with barely a scrap of his current power and social standing, Severus would be an extremely contented man.
Hadrian paused once more for dramatic effect, damn Tom and his overzealous habits, scanning the room and seeing the fire burning in his inner circle’s eyes. “Tonight, Draco darling,” he said, locking emerald green with silver once more, “tonight, Harry Potter dies.” Smiles were wide all throughout the room. They had been waiting for this day for too long.
“Tell me, little bird,” she sang. “Or you won’t like what happens next.”
Sirius was crying by the time Harry finished and Draco’s heart reached out to him. He was pretty sure Hadrian had just organised for Sirius Black’s innocence to be revealed.
Sitting next to Severus on a large bronze and blue couch was one of the only people Severus would think to call friend, Lucius Malfoy. Severus was intimately acquainted with the less than stellar aspects of Lucius’ personality and therefore was not remotely surprised when the blonde man stood up suddenly and pointed an accusing finger at Hadrian Peverell. An extremely stupid thing to do in Severus’ eyes, considering said Vampire was currently in the presence of his Donor and his inner circle. Threatening Vampires in front of what they considered theirs was, generally, just a horrible idea if you wished to keep your blood
“Why wasn’t the new Lord Potter informed of this before the reading?” Dumbledore spoke up from his seat in the centre of the table. He was still clearly of the belief that Harry was so fooled by him as to make him (or one of his pawns) the new Lord Potter.
Both Charles and William nodded in understanding, looking nowhere near as nervous at the mention of conditions as Draco thought they should be. He had learnt a lot about Harry Potter over the past few days and if he understood one thing, it was that he was a vindictive little shit when he wanted to be. Draco imagined the conditions for protection from House Potter would be a lot higher than the Weasleys imagined.
Lucius lost all composure as he watched a young Harry be beaten for levitating a toy in the presence of his Uncle. He remembered watching Draco perform accidental magic and the overwhelming pride he and Narcissa had felt at the proof their son was gifted by magic. It was a time of celebration in a young child’s life when they began manifesting magic and to be punished for such a thing was unheard of. How Dumbledore had left this poor child to such horrible muggles and no one questioned it astounded Lucius.
Hadrian sat, surrounded by his Wolves, enjoying a nice Sunday breakfast. The Elves had done especially well with the eggs this morning and Hadrian reminded himself to go down to the kitchen and thank the little creatures. It was always good to have the favour of the ones responsible for your food after all. He imagined it lead to significantly fewer poisonings.
onto Hadrian Peverell’s recently cleared breakfast plate, Draco knew things were about to change.
Hadrian was smirking openly now as Lucius’s looked at him in complete horror. “Weasley’s, my Lord?” he said and Hadrian was mildly surprised he managed without stuttering, he looked do shaken. “You expect me to house
Both Weasleys had almost identical looks of awe on their faces and Draco had to wonder how many Weasleys were actually on Hadrian’s side. He had always thought the whole family was close to him, but recent revelations about the two youngest and the mother had Draco readjusting his world view. Perhaps Hadrian was using this opportunity to figure out more than just Lupin’s loyalties.
The room watched as young Harry heard his father call for Lily to ‘take Harry and run’. Watched as the young witch barricaded herself in the nursery and waited for the inevitable attack. No one was breathing as Voldemort burst through the door and demanded Lily move aside as she begged for the life of her son. They saw the frustration and resignation on the Dark Lord’s face as he finally killed the young witch and pointed his wand at baby Harry. The curse was cast, backfired and the spirit of the most powerful wizard of his time was forced from the room as his body disintegrated.
“At least it was a good split and that you still talk to him. Ginny and I ending was rough at first, and it’s still awkward from time to time...” he trails off.
“I’m sorry. He just looked at me with those pretty green eyes of his and I couldn’t help but look at his muscles. He probably could have asked me to murder someone and I would have,” Jane jests, wrapping an arm around Aby as she continues to wax poetic about the good looking customers they sometimes got.
“Miss me?” he asks playfully as he knocks on the open door.
“Oh I’ve been waiting to hear that all my life, Aby,” Harry says loudly, flirting with the man a little as he walks down the hallway, admiring the man’s new haircut. “Love the new look,” he compliments.
"Because Aby wasn’t happy before you came around, is that is?" Luke challenges, pulling a blanket down around his friend who doesn’t seem to want to talk. "You ever stop to think that maybe Aby doesn’t want this fixed for him because his life before now wasn’t all that great? You might mean well but you've been around less than two months - we've been here for years," he states bluntly, turning his sharp gaze onto Potter.
"Michael I'm certain flirts with you enough that you married him and as for me...I'd rather not, no offense. You're not my type and you're more like a sister, who has by circumstance, seen my cock.”
"Trying to get you laid Potter," he whispered.
“Yeah that’s fine,” Harry agrees, a tad miffed that the subject of conversation had moved back onto him. Standing from his chair, he shrugs off his robe and pulls off his shirt, not at all self-conscious as the years of hard Auror training had paid off.
"Yes it hurt but luckily we have potions that help. As for the charms, they’re, um, sex related," Aby responds, pinking a bit. “I won’t tell you what they do. That’s for me and the men in my bed.”
"Well the muggle world doesn't know you, but you could always get a very enthusiastic witch or wizard who would caterer too all of your needs because you're Harry Potter," he wryly suggests.
“I just...I just think you’re...nevermind,” Harry stammers, feeling like an idiot for thinking that he’d seen an opening. Forget their history, Malfoy is out of his league is so many ways.
Once inside the house, Aby walks them straight to the kitchen to deposit their booze and he begins to scan the crowd for people he knows.
But now, with his informant, he’s been able to amass a nice collection of data on the illegal trade Lucius has now been participating in to keep the Malfoy estate a float. A few more months and perhaps one more witness, and he knows he can put Lucius in Azkaban where he belongs.
As the set finishes for the night, Aby leans in to kiss Liam, asking them back to his, when they shake their head. "I promised Charlie I'd go home with him tonight Aby, if not I'd very much enjoy going back to yours. You know I do love that addition you have," they wink, playfully groping Aby’s groin.
Aby waves them off hoping they don’t actually try and take Potter home as it would be rather annoying. Though the image of Harry between two men certainly did something for him as he wanders down to the basement.
Looking up he sees that Potter looks stunned. “I’m sorry, was that not something you wanted?”
“Wait that was Luke, the one who the customer turned down earlier?” he asks, trying to mentally take in the ways Luke might have looked werewolfish to be profiled by his customer.
“What do you mean my misplaced opinions?”
When Malfoy doesn’t reply Harry can’t help but ask, “So are you and him a thing, you know since you brew his wolfsbane?”
“I guess it’s a good thing that I’ve got something pretty to look at while I feed my addiction,” Harry shoots back with a smirk, glancing over at Malfoy just before the man begins to ink his skin.
Harry pouts a little when the two men abruptly leave. He thought he was getting on pretty well with Leo; it had been a while since he's been touched like that and was enjoying it.
Harry’s body breaks into some goosebumps at the man’s touch, but didn’t pull back. “Thank you, I think it’s pretty neat as well. Aby did an amazing job,” he praises.
"Very funny Potter. Do what I do and just stick to muggles. Less likely to disappoint in the end," he replies, figuring Potter was just trying to get a rise out of him - not that Aby wouldn’t mind seeing Potter on his knees, but that was just wank fodder as far as he was concerned.
“Jane right?” he asks, making the witch smile.
Aby begins to cackle and cheekily makes a star on his wall calendar. “Sorry just marking the date that you finally admit my brilliance.”
Harry has to laugh a bit at the use of the word twink, because he never thought he’d hear it come out of Malfoy’s mouth. “I sent him home because he was entirely too drunk. Where was the guy you were hanging all over all night?” Harry challenges, his voice playfully low.
“So he’s interested in Muggle things? He’d get along with my mate’s father. He has a collection of Muggle things. Just finds them fascinating, which I guess they are in their own little way,” he agrees, smiling over at Aby as he spoke.
“Jane!” he calls into the fire, until her face comes into view, smiling at her friend and employee.
“Stop looking, they are under your skin now and not visible. You’re all set for today. In two weeks' time we’ll get your movement charm done and you’ll be done. Same rules apply as last time with aftercare, and since Jane is up at the front you can get your healing potions from her and close out," he yawns, waiving Potter off.
“Why wouldn’t you be able to trust me?” Harry asks with a frown, genuinely not understanding. He thought that he had more than proven himself to be trustworthy during his life.
Harry raises an eyebrow to that answer. “So I take it to mean that they’re in places not meant to be seen by everyone?”
"Potter general etiquette dictates that if you see a bloke at a gay bar that doesn't come up and say at least hello but instead gives a tight lipped smile after a look of panic, that most likely he'd like to remain under the radar. Just wanted to give you space." He half lies, knowing the other half is that he doesn’t want to see him more than he needs to. "I do hope though you don't arrest me for this though auror," he adds, holding up his cigarette.
After another period of silence, Harry lets his curiosity get the better of him. “What made you try becoming a tattoo artist though? If you don’t mind me asking that is.”
“Well I didn’t know until Dumbledore told me. My father gave it to me,” Harry explains, frowning slightly. “And I can’t help that I was literally thrust into that life. The stone was destroyed and I destroyed the Elder Wand after I defeated Voldemort,” he adds.
“Yeah, I’m sure any wixen will,” he agrees with another laugh, waiting on Malfoy to charge him.
Harry didn’t really know how to respond to that because it was the truth. Harry didn’t know Draco now. He still thought of him as the 18 year old he spoke for at his sentencing and trial and not the man before him. It had been eight years after all.
“Of course I like it, you did it after all,” he replies softly, glancing up at Malfoy in the mirror, smiling fondly at him.
Harry was beyond impressed by what Jane has managed to create with something so innocuous as an earring. “That’s impressive Jane. I’m sure that there are plenty of people who could use a piercing that does that. I may have to tell my two friends to come see you.”
"It's nice that you want to be a part of Aby's life love," Jane says as he floats the tea tray in front, her tone a lot friendlier than Luke’s, "but from what I can tell you sort of run into situations head first without thinking of what might happen," she adds softly.
Stopping when Malfoy turns on his heels to face him, he watches as the blonde goes from ready for a fight to subdued in a mere moment. “It’s simple. Some people don't want to have a former death eater doing their work, the same way they have issues with us having a werewolf on staff. Now did you eat before coming?" he tacks on, turning around again to keep walking to his station.
Harry is startled by not just the harsh language but the fear in Malfoy’s eyes. “But...but what if she didn’t tell your father? I’m sure she’d be willing to keep things a secret just to see you,” he says softly, wanting to calm him down a bit.
“I don’t think I’d appreciate the snitch going over my prick, but other than that I think I’d be fine,” he chuckles.
“No, he swapped it for his usual. Another one that I made, mind. Cheeky slag,” she tacks on, playfully, not noticing the way Harry turned red at that information.
He reads over the narrative again from the last time Narcissa saw Malfoy:
“Yes, I did see her then, and I still do every now and then,” he answers, leaving out the fact that he lunches with Narcissa one a month, a holdover from when the investigation was in full swing. “She’s a lovely woman.”
Harry frowns as Aby said that he had been looking over at him, not knowing what to say. Maybe he wasn’t so good at this whole party thing after all. He sighs and makes himself another drink as well, swallowing hard and glancing over as someone energetically bounces over to Malfoy, picking him up into a hug, calling him gorgeous.
Aby pulls his wand away fast enough that he’s able to laugh without ruining the shading. "Oh goodness no. Jane is Michael's wife and very much not my type."
“Mal-Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?,” he sputters, staring at the blonde in astonishment. His gaze roams over all of the blonde’s tattoos and piercings, wondering how it could even be the same Draco, but knew it had to be. After all his cold case had never left his desk even after five years of inactivity. He has a debt to pay back after all.

“I need to just quickly eat my lunch before we get started if you don’t mind. Use this time to go to the toilet if you like or just peruse some of the pamphlets.”
“Mmm I don’t think I’m going to go with tongue. Since my job is so public I don’t want people to see it, well, not all of the people,” Harry muses as he sits down in her chair, glancing at the door to see if he could spot Aby as his station was right next door.
Finding Luke there, Aby is about to explain that Potter stayed the night, when the brunette walks into the kitchen far quicker than he anticipated.
“Fine, but the auror’s paying,” Luke calls out before lifting himself off the couch.
"Perhaps. Though I'm angling for a bit more if I can manage it. Haven't been laid in two week," he grimaces and walking them up to the door.
“Alright, I’ll stop by after work tomorrow if I get out of the office before you close,” Harry offers, thanking MAlfoy quietly as he serves them breakfast. “Never would have pictured you being able to cook but this is good,” he compliments as he begins eating, winking playfully at him from across the table.
Aby hates that he pinks a little upon seeing one very fit, shirtless Auror in his station. Clearing his throat, he instructs Potter to sit down, and discusses placement with him, settling on his bicep.
“Jane when did Potter reschedule?” Aby asks, looking at her seriously. “Luke said he did but that he didn’t see him on the ledger.”
Harry eyes the man that Malfoy led out of the back, frowning at him for a moment before turning back to give Jane a wink. “She wasn’t corrupting me. I can deal with a little flirting, Malfoy,” he teases as the blonde walks back to his station.
“Luke doesn’t like anyone from the Ministry, don’t take it personally.”
"Thanks. I wanted something different and I thought it suited me. Combination of sleek but punk," he grins, and ushers Potter to the seat reaching for the design to going over it him one more time.
Laying his shirt over the back of a nearby chair, Harry stretches before he takes his seat, letting out a soft groan. “So I wasn’t expecting to be so sore the next day when I woke up,” he comments, glancing at Malfoy as he pours over the magazine.
“Wait...is that seriously why you think I want to be your friend? Would I like to fuck you? Oh yes, you are definitely my type. But I also like you as a person. I have fun with you and I feel like I can be myself around you,” Harry confesses, not quite believing that Malfoy thought that of him. “And I don’t want to go back to just being your customer, I did have fun last night. That was the most fun I’ve had in months, and I’m really glad that I found you in that shop so that we could have another chance,” he answers honestly, watching Malfoy carefully.
Aby begins to shake. Now his mother was standing up to his father, but not when it counted most, back when Lucius was trying to force him into a loveless marriage for status. “Just go Potter,” he states, pointing to the door, and turning away.
Aby works in silence for a few minutes until the room’s quiet was getting to him. Wiping Potter’s arm, he put his wand down and grabs his own wand from inside his desk, swishing it to put on his record player in the corner, filling the room with muggle punk music at a low volume. Murmuring the words under his breath as he works, he’s grateful that Steph was clever enough to take the music from the shiny discs the Muggles use and put them on the records Aby could use around his magic. This particular mix was of queer punk bands his ex enjoyed and Aby had it on heavy rotation.
“Uh, no, just Severus would cast his patronus at night around my bed to let me sleep while I was in the manor. He usually stayed in my rooms when he was visiting. That’s the only time I’ve really seen one up close.”
“Seeing as almost half my tattoos are muggle, and I’ve apprenticed as a muggle tattoo artist as well, I think I have a good idea,” Aby chuckles, keeping his hand steady.
"Of course he is," Aby grouses, curling into his friend, despite her going behind his back.
"It comes with the territory of being a decent tattoo shop in magical London. Some wixen won't go do muggle ink so they deal with us," she explains. “There are two other shops in London, but we’re the closest to Diagon being between the main streets, but still bordering the muggle area.”
Aby always enjoys sleeping in when he can, and finding himself wrapped around a warm body is even better. Nuzzling into the man's neck he takes him a moment to remember it’s Harry in his bed and he backs off a bit, opting instead to roll over on his back and stretch. He'll need a slight hangover potion soon, but he could be worse off.
"Pretty standard. Had a few walk ins and a standing client who I'm doing a whole back piece on so it's taking a bit. Exhausted me when I finished the session yesterday but she's paying a pretty penny for it so I don't mind," he describes through a full mouth before crumbling up his trash and tossing it into the bin.
Playfully swatting at Malfoy, he nods. “Fine. I’ll see myself home and maybe even contemplate a proper mean. I’ll see you soon, have a good night, both of you.”
Harry spent the next few days trying to resist the urge to go by the shop, or find a way to run into Malfoy, not wanting to appear too eager. But luckily, Malfoy’s owl arrived before Harry’s patience ran out and got the best of him. The letter was short and simply, asking Harry if he wanted to go out that weekend, no more detail than that. But with a quick answer of yes, Harry was looking forward to the end of the week.
Harry had never considered you could imbue a tattoo with magic as the only example he’d seen was the Dark Mark and that was a brand more than anything. He became intrigued, and channeling his inner Hermione, began to research. Of course once he was on the lookout he began to notice plenty of people around him with tattoos and one shop name came up more than most - Magus Atramento.
“S’alright. I like your company and at least you’re fit and fun to look at,” Harry quips back, laying his head over on Aby’s shoulder as they lean against one another.
“Thank you, Draco. And I promise that I won’t,” Harry agrees with an eager grin, and rolls his eyes as Aby refers to his friend group as degenerates. “I think you might be the only degenerate, I like Jane and I’m not too sure about Luke yet,” he admits, brushing off his comment about saving his life.
"Will do. Goodnight Potter," Aby yawns, and soon passes out, his mind imagining that this was something more than simple platonic affection.
Harry goes home that Monday night, but the next day, he finds himself staying late once again at the office, this time, pouring over Malfoy’s cold case file, making adding private notes to what he’d gathered before.
"I'll think about it...shame you're off the market for a bit. Such a brilliant shag," he laments, playfully swatting his arse. "Go find your man. I'm going to see the show and maybe take something other than a bottle home."
As soon as Potter walks out of his station, Aby cast a muffliato over his station and begins to sob. He misses his mother the most and to think she was moving on without him was bittersweet. To know she lunches with Potter, stands up to his father for Potter but not Aby when he needed it, was heartbreaking.
"Aww talking about me is he? Usually he's cursing me for sticking needles in him," Jane giggles.
“Chinese if you will. You know my order,” he smiles, pausing to wipe some of the blood that was welling up from Harry’s skin.
“Yes!” they both retort, not looking at Jane, but eyeing each other.
“Yes, stops. I put anchor points on your palms and the back of your hand, so when you close your hand, if the snitch is in it, the tattoo stops moving, like it’s really there. Open your palm and it goes zipping over your body again,” Aby explains. “Depending on where you want it to fly is where we put the other points but the palms are the showstopper in my opinion. Took me ages to figure out the magical theory behind it, pity we don’t have academic journals for tattooing,” he laughs to himself.
Luke is on the other side of the floo sitting on the threadbare couch, expecting his roommate to come home and debate what takeaway to get, when he sees the flames spit out the Auror whose been coming into the shop lately.
This week marks his second full year of being an artist, after an exhausting year of apprenticeship, and he couldn’t be happier. Sure it wasn’t the life he had grown up expecting to have, but then again he didn’t expect his father to try and kill him, so clearly life just held surprises.
"No problem," he shrugs, not genuinely minding, turning on the ceiling fan to keep Potter cool during the night before slipping under the covers. "My shift isn't until noon so if you need to set an earlier alarm I don't mind."
Harry nods, following obediently, considering himself lucky that he’s still being invited to stay. He just hopes that he doesn’t do anything else stupid to embarrass himself.
"Yes I can assure you that I won't be running off to the Prophet to expose this particular part of your life. Now where was that twink you were hanging off of all night?" he asks looking about.
"Yes in a way. It's a mix. Not just one band on the record. This is a band called the Pansy Division," Aby replies, trying to not break concentration.
Harry is thankful for Jane, as she seems to step in at all the right times to calm Malfoy down. He waits as she speaks softly to the blonde, feeling a bit awkward as though he were interrupting a private moment, unable to hear what is being said.
Aby gets home and decides he doesn’t want to remember that night, or the weekend in general, altering for the next 48 hours between fits of melancholy and heavy-handed drinking. He certainly hasn't learned to cope well over the years when things didn't go his way, but lucky for him Luke knew him well, and upon seeing him Sunday morning, picks the blonde up and takes time to his room, where they spend the next hours curled around each other like an odd pack, coming down from the emotional highs of the weekend.
Aby notices Potter and some bloke make their way into the crowd, and doesn’t stop Liam from leading him to the front of the stage. He catches Potter snogging in the middle of the set at a point but does his best to focus on the music, dancing and jumping to get his energy out.
“I’m almost sad that I didn’t put them in a place that I could show off more,” Harry admits with a laugh as he walks out to the front room.
“Sorry! I didn’t mean to imply anything, I’m just still learning about you, Abraxas, versus Draco,” Harry clarifies. “Was he any good?” he adds, causing Aby to raise his eyebrows when Harry holds up his hands to clarify. “I meant art wise, not, you know...I was just curious about the piece he did?”
Harry looks over his options, settling on a black outline with gold filling.
“No I don't think you'll hit on everyone, merely just saying that unlike a gay bar there isn't a way to almost guarantee who will be offended or not by being hit on but most punks that these shows are pretty open minded.”
Pulling out the design he shows the stag design, the paper charmed to show the small movements of the animal. The paper swirled with the pearlescent color, mimicking the way a patronus shimmers. “I’ve tried my best to get the ink to sit in a way that mimics how etheral a real patronus does. I might need you to cast one just to check the optics on it. Haven’t seen a patronus since the war.”
"I had a good time too and I'm happy most days you wandered into our shop."
Harry for his part lays against the chair, wondering how he could fix his fuck up from the other night, let alone approach the topic of conversation. But as he thinks about his options he finds himself tapping his fingers on the chair along with the beat.
Harry’s eyes grow wide in shock at Malfoy’s words, unable to respond before the blonde apparates.
“Why are you so angry about it though? Normally if someone doesn’t want to be in your life you just say ‘fuck ‘em’ and forget about it,” she points out. “And in Harry’s defense, he hasn’t mentioned his fame or tried to use it to his advantage once since he came into the parlour. You know how people like that usually are though - sleazy and trying to milk the life out of who they are.”
“You want me to enjoy getting my dick pierced?” Harry responds in anger, cutting Jane off who is trying to tell Aby that he is misreading the situation.
“Well the coloring is all done, take a look in the mirror before we move onto the anchor points,” he instructs, sitting up and stretching.
Harry balks for a second as Malfoy calls him charming, but snaps out of it as he continues to yell. “I’m not trying to get you caught by Lucius, I want that motherfucker in Azkaban where he belongs. I want to help you and your mum both be free,” he shouts back. “I don’t care that you’re a poof and I don’t care about your bloody past, I just want to be around you. I don’t know why I do, because you haven’t been anything other than nasty to me, but I want to be your friend, and I know I won’t get you caught,” he insists.
"I'll try harder next time Potter. But for now you'll just have to settle for my company," he teases, leaning back into him in return.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s really impressive Malfoy. I take it that you’re fine with muggles now considered the apprenticeship and whatnot?”
“What do you sleep in?” Harry yawns as he slips his shirt over his head.
Harry frowns at Luke, resisting the overwhelming urge to tell him off. That definitely wouldn’t make anyone like more. “I’m not trying to control his life,” he begins, “I just want to bring him and his mother back together is all. And maybe try and fix this tension between us...because I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'd apologize but anyone who comes in thinking a tattoo doesn't hurt is mental. And this is coming from someone who has about six muggle ones and they use a needle gun," he laughs, wiping away some blood.
Aby casts some spell to clean up the site and hands Harry back his shirt. As he put away his supplies, he notes how excited he is for dinner. “I mean that is if you still have time that is. Don’t want to take up more of your time."
"Potter I'm not trying to get rid of you, just merely trying to get you off my ledger like I would any other customer. No need to spend your time waiting around the parlour," he shrugs.
Harry stands in awe as he watches the blonde, bounding about like a loose pixie, not caring if he gets hit or shoved, but instead rolls with the music. Despite all Harry’s boldness he wasn’t too keen on waving his head around like a maniac lest he lose his glasses.
“Yeah I can do that, do you want me to cast one right now so you can make some modifications? Then maybe we can grab dinner?”
“Yes, yes. You know I promised, especially now that you lot are paying me in more than just food,” he grins, smiling at his coworker and friend.
“Well it’s not too common yet, but Michael the shop owner is always pushing us to experiment and expand the boundaries of what this art is in the wizarding world,” he shrugs, checking himself, as he wasn’t supposed to be getting this comfortable with his customer, especially Potter.
It took a second for Harry to process, his eyes widening at his conclusion. “Wait...Seriously? You all can charm tattoos like that?”
Her lips were a deep red, and earlier in the day she’d reapplied her makeup, much to Aby’s disdain. She was eager to see Harry Potter, not because of who he was, but just because she thought him so pretty.
Harry spent the next week focusing on the information he’d learned. It was crazy that after so many years of trying to track down Draco Malfoy he was living right under his nose. In a tattoo parlour of all places.
"No, certainly not. Though Jane has seen them all as she’s done the piercings," he amends.
“Just hold still. I’m about done for the day,” he replies, not answering his inquiry.
“Oh yeah? What’s she getting?” Harry asks as they start to walk again.
Aby nods as he places some powder into the fire.
“So again, where you do want it to flit? When I did Ben’s tattoo, it was just across the shoulders and down his arms. But I can do it wherever you like.”
"Charlie again actually. Things are getting serious if you can believe. I'm sure we'll bring you to bed eventually, but right now it's just us. What about you? Who’s that stocky brunette with curly hair that I saw you walk in with? He’s adorable.”
"I guess it is. The wizard radio doesn't have anything quite like this,” he notes, knowing that he’d probably grow a third arm before the Wizarding Wireless played a gay love song. He enjoys music about people like him falling in love, living life, or just feeling, and he knows he isn’t going to get it from his world so easily. "Steph, one of the other artists, likes to go to shows and I go with her occasionally. My ex did too and I got introduced to the wonders of music outside of Celestina Warbeck that way."
“Right so I’ll be putting the anchor points on you along your body, starting at the tattoo, down to your feet, and going up your body. Now if you don’t want the snitch to go somewhere, let me know so I don’t put a guiding mark there.”
Luke was stands at his doorway, all 6’4 of him. He always looks meaner at first sight, his serious face and stature put most people off, but Aby knows that he’s just a protective teddy bear underneath it all.
“Really? Well it’s lovely and it’s a brilliant way to memorialize him,” Harry remarks softly, leaning down a bit closer so that he can see it better. “Does it do anything special?,” he inquires.
"Potter you kept looking over at me. They probably thought we were together. Next time I'm leaving you to flounder alone," he grouses and goes to the kitchen for another drink.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take off your shirt and sit down with your chest to the back. I should be done within the hour," Aby said without looking at Harry, causing the auror to frown at the way he was spoken to.
“That’s very sweet, he seems like he was very good to you,” Harry says supportively, closing his eyes as he holds Malfoy close, taking a chance as he presses his face into the crook of his neck.
“I don’t see how you being a Death Eater would lose him business. This isn’t exactly the best part of town,” Harry answers without thought.
"It's not pathetic it's just something you have to work on so come on," he gestures and opens the door back to the living room. There they found Jane and Luke, who were pleased to see that neither was dead. "Potter will be staying for dinner and will probably be around more because well, he needs a life beyond auroring and we're a lively bunch aren't we?"
“No, you don’t have to do that. I mean, I can crash on the couch if you wouldn’t be comfortable sleeping in the bed with me?” Harry suggests as he leans against the kitchen counter.
“No, your schedule is fine. Honestly, you might just become my regular artist now, I’m so in love with it,” Harry grins as he retrieves his wallet from his pocket while Malfoy pencils his appointments in.
"Don’t mind you hanging around at all. Honestly Aby should have been free now, but the customer in the back is just being difficult. Wouldn't see Luke for his appointment, but still demanded and tattoo, so here we are," she shrugs.
“Hey, there is nothing wrong with my department,” Harry replies a bit defensive. “I looked hard for you Malfoy, but I couldn’t do it alone,” he admits bitterly. His entire team had refused to help him locate a former Death Eater so he had taken the mission on his own.
“Oh yeah? Like what? What have I done that’s worse? And it’s not that I’m afraid, I just...Well I’d be lost,” he corrects.
"Potter I ran away and her logical leap after not finding me is that my father found me and murdered me. You can see why I’m not all for bringing her into this.”
"Honestly Jane, you're married," Aby griped as she touched up her lipstick. "Oh Aby, you know as well as I do Michael and I do our own thing. Besides he's a bit young for me but I do like flirting...and you're so terribly gay," she pouted.
He nods at the blonde’s question and opens his eyes again, taking in the admittedly attractive man hovering over him. “Yeah, I’m ready. Do your worst, Malfoy,” he dares with a smirk.
"How about this?” Aby begins to offer, “come around some time, stay for dinner, get to know me properly, and I'll take to a sex shop and get you something fun."
Aby’s eyes widen in fear. "No. I would hate to put my mother through the death of her son twice. Because make no mistake Potter. Lucius will murder me because he'd rather go to Azkaban than live with having a faggot of a son and letting him walk about."
“Whatever you’re doing can't be that bad,” Harry scoffs.
"Such chivalry," Aby remarks, mildly sincere. "Oh Liam? They agreed to go home with someone else before I got here so no fun for me. Which is a shame seeing as my flat is empty for once."
"It's fine, we've both had a lot to drink,” he assures, passing Harry his steeping tea. “Just crash on my bed. I promise it's comfortable enough. If you want, I can even sleep in Luke's bed. Goodness knows that were has used me as a teddy bear enough times."
"Permanent cushioning charms do wonders to a rather inexpensive mattress," he chuckles, and without hesitation slides an arm around Potter.
“Aby! You have to understand that he's just so handsome and was so disappointed when you cancelled. He thinks you’re avoiding him and seemed to be hurt by it,” she pouts.
"Potter the gay community is not that big. And it isn't as if I'm sleeping with my friends' boyfriends. I'm sleeping with other hookups and casual one nighters. If someone is off limits because of feelings, I'm not an arse and I stay away," he elaborates.
"I'm convinced your flirt with the world Potter, honestly," he sighs fondly, working on the antler carefully, thankful that the auror could only see him peripherally - he would be able to hide his blush that way.
“Um Aby?,” Luke questions as he looks between his friend and the Auror.
Aby shakes his head fondly at the mention of Michael’s hobby. "He enchants them when he's done so they fly about. They're, what do you call them, aeroplanes? Fascinating things."
“Sounds lovely actually. I am a bit hungry,” he admits.
"Alright I'll get started on that. Going to start with the stasis charm so you can go about in the muggle world without breaking the statute,” he narrates.
"You are more than decently attractive Potter believe me. But we just started becoming friends..." He begins, and wonders if Potter just thinks this is an easier route to get into his pants since Aby has said he fucks his friends.
“Well I switch, and have sex with men and women” Harry answers. “What charms would you recommend for that? And can you do multiple charms?”
"That while he didn't understand it he still loved me and if my parents didn't react well I'd have a place at his home until they came to their senses," he repeats with a rueful smile.
"Potter is just dramatic I can assure you of that," he scoffs, the name coming out of his mouth as it had when he was younger. "He mentioned that after this tattoo that he wouldn't be coming around again so I don't know what he's making such a fuss about. Luke is more than capable to do his movement as he's more experienced than me. Besides...he agreed with me earlier that I was a death eater so I figured an auror like him would appreciate the distance," he shrugs, turning his eyes from Jane who was scowling at the comment.
“What do you mean?” Aby asks, casting a discreet lightening charm on the handle of vodka.
"It doesn't matter. It's the same reason I’m weary of being his friend. He's Harry Potter...and I'm dead to the wizarding world. I'm not about to go breaking my heart or my body like that."
“I know that prat. I speak highly of plenty of my friends without wanting to shag them you know,” he replies, sticking his tongue out at Malfoy playfully.
“Why would I want an out?” Harry asks curiously. “You assume that I wouldn’t want you to do this just because it’s you?” he adds as he follows along behind Draco to the back of the shop.
Harry barely makes it to the shop before closing the next day, but doesn’t want to miss a chance to see Malfoy or talk about the tattoo.
Harry laughs at Malfoy’s teasing and playfully gives him two fingers before extending a hand to help him up. “Hey, I can’t help that I’m not tattooed from head to toe like you and that I still look like a professional. I tried though.”
LOTS of people in this chapter just to make it really crowded and not a lot actually happens but I hope you enjoy a bit more of Sirius' pov.
“If I’m completely honest with you all, it started when I got my Hogwarts letter,” Hadrian said thoughtfully. “I had spent my whole life being told I was a freak who’s drunken parents died in a car crash and then suddenly I’m thrust into a world where I’m famous for vanquishing the Dark Lord Voldemort and my parents were war heroes who died tragically protecting me."
