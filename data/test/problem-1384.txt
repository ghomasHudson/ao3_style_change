By the way Malfoy acquired a chick from the farmhouse, and we named it Fluffy (yes it’s after Fluffy from first year Ron). It’s brown and little and cute. And an attention hogging bastard. Literally since we’ve gotten it, Malfoy literally spends more time parading Fluffy around than he spends making his hair look perfect. They’re both so annoying!
"Oh. Oh! I see," Hermione winces. "That's… not good."
“Hey, hey! Look, it’s me, Scorp!” Harry reassures, but Scorpius wants none of it. He screams and screams.
Draco.
"What?"
Harry breathes in and breathes out.
Enough about me. How did your conference in Paris go? Get any new ideas? Rivals? Girlfriends you want to tell me about? Are we finally dropping Blaise?
Harry wails. "He ALREADY hates me, oh my god. I was so stupid last time. He's definitely not going to want to be friends with me now!"
With ears ringing, his mouth moves and out comes: "But they had my name on them." Harry touches his elbow and his mouth moves. Draco flinches back, and his breaths come shallower and shallower. "I thought… I thought they were a... a courtship..." he trails off in a small tinny voice Draco hates. And then he realizes. "Merlin," he exhales. "Merlin, I didn't even wait for you to explain." Harry's eyes are wide and he's shaking his head wildly trying to get a word in, but Draco doesn't let him. He doesn't even notice. "I just… I just assumed. Stupid.
Hermione and her incredibly pregnant belly are sitting at the dinner table and she starts wildly when Harry falls out of her fireplace with no warning, with Ron closely following. "Harry!" she exclaims and speed waddles over to pick him. "Ron!" Harry clings to her.
“Okay, now you just want a picture of my arse,” he says. His husband sticks his tongue out, making a 'bend over' motion with his finger. “Oh come on,” Harry groans quietly. “You have enough pictures of me holding this stupid bag. Is there no way to satisfy you?”
“NO SHE SURELY DID NOT! What the bloody hell? When was she going to tell me?”
Draco taps his index finger against his cheek. “Hmmm… let’s see…” Then he glances up mischievously and drops his voice. “I think I could be bought, for a fair price of course.”
. Draco takes pity on him and reaches up to nudge Potter's arm so that it's pointing towards the pretty Ivies in the corner.
good ones are always in the back.” He can hear his husband’s sigh and footsteps trudging behind him.
. It’s barely been a minute since Draco left, and she’s already here comforting Harry? Draco's heart clenches. This is...not good. Was Harry struggling with something? Was something going on? Why didn't Draco know about whatever was making Harry look like that?
. THE OWL THAT JUST ENTERED MALFOY'S SHOP. Harry drops his coffee, stubs his toe, and dashes across the cafe, out of the door, and across the street. This time he doesn't hesitate a bit before crashing through the door.
. Instead of knocking, he lays his hand on the door.
"Well, either way, you're going to look scrumptious," decides Hermione. "Show him what he's missing out on if he doesn't think it's a date."
Don’t you realize I ignored all your dumb letters for a reason?
. Harry quickly tries to step out of his Santa suit and reach out to Scorpius too. But Scorpius twists away from him. “I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU BOTH!”
"A year and two months," Potter blurts and then squeaks. Potter's off—it's actually been a month and twenty-eight days—but Draco will take it. Draco hums, gently takes Potter by the elbow and leads him up to the counter. "Errr... I meant yes, long, it- yes, has been. It has long been. Yes," Potter stumbles, clearly panicking.
And if killing you is what makes Harry happy, you don't mind. If he asks nicely, you might even give him your heart on a platter.
but I can’t see the road anymore through my tears, can’t hear anything anymore over my heaving sobs, except in the rearview, a flash of green and red, the pile of Christmas presents we’d picked out; I reach out to the gear shift and its warm, from your hands, pushing it together; breathe in and your laughter echoing in the air, Teddy’s squeals in the backseat,
to the hotel. It makes me want to take up journaling again. But I suppose I shall settle with a photo album just like always.
“Because it’s a courtship gift, Pans.”
He exhales a small laugh, and says, "Saviour, oh Saviour," delighting in the half scowl that crosses Potter's face at the moniker. Potter is
Madam Analstacia's Whack Shack
Here, you are the happiest that you've been in a very long time.
It was a pleasure to hear from Mother and you in your last letter. I should probably have warned you in advance, but I am bringing Harry home with me. Be on your best behaviour. Don’t mess this up for me. And please tell Mother. We will be there by nightfall.
At the end she stacks her files and says, "The prosecution will have a lot of points, Draco. Every single person there will be against you." A curly lock of brown hair falls into her eye when she leans forward. "But their hate isn't for
Out on the terrace, the sky yawns big and black over your head. Thousands of stars hold their breath, and the snow covered world stands still around you. Turning your face heavenwards, you can pretend you're in Wiltshire. If you close your eyes, you can almost feel Mother's soft hands caress your cheek and Father's strong arms wrap around your shoulders. The air turns sweet and spicy from the elves cooking in the kitchen, the stone under your hands smooths into warm granite, the Manor's fields quietly rustle in the distance. If you turn around now, the peacocks will be strutting across the gardens, Mother's rose bushes will be in full bloom, the fountains will be spouting clear water. Any moment now, you will go inside and Mother will fuss over your crooked collars. Your father will smother a smile when you abscond with his cufflinks again, and the elves will let you play with the dough to keep you out of any further mischief. This is what it means to be a Malfoy for you—what it meant to be Draco Malfoy. This is what you made yourself a slave for, what you kill for. This is what you put in danger every time you lay with Potter. You think about doing your duty as a Malfoy, about leaving Potter forever, about succeeding in your tasks and making everything perfect at home again.
— My world jerks to a stop.
Dear Hermione,
. You knew you were flirting with disaster being so transparently traitorous, but you frankly didn't give a shite. You had Harry by your side, and that was all that mattered. Together the two of you were invincible. Harry found an empty classroom in the abandoned dungeons and transfigured some pillows and sheets for the two of you (red and gold, you note. Green would look better with Harry's eyes). You swiped some skin coloured cream from Pansy's secret muggle make-up stash and spent an evening making sure your left arm looked flawless (if you also used some on your right wrist to cover up knife scars, well, no one needed to know).
Hermione rolled her eyes. “They just wanted to say goodbye you dummy. Honestly Harry.” Then her eyes softened. “We all love you so much Harry. Just remember that yeah?”
"Go ahead then," Malfoy gestures to his shop. "Find anything incriminating? Think I'm up to something, Auror Potter?" His eyes are sharp, his hands clenched, his lower lip still. Suddenly, something tells Harry this is it. If Malfoy's trust breaks in this second, that's it. Harry won't ever have another chance.
PS:  I could not send this last night because the owleries were all closed by the time we decided on a place to stay in.
kissing me, not someone else.”
Malfoy winked at Harry, and Harry’s tummy went gooey.
Harry gives way and sighs. “I’ll give you a nice belly rub when we get home if you behave, alright? How does that sound?” Draco doesn’t move an inch with his pleading face. He knows his husband can do much better than
, sitting with Harry as he drinks his coffee. As is often the case with Luna Lovegood, neither Harry nor the narrator is quite sure why, how and whence Luna has appeared from. But as he loves Luna he doesn't question her presence (neither do we). Anyhow, it's her presence that is of utmost importance here, not her unsurpassed knack for knowing when and where she is needed.
. Harry looks away towards the park to the right.
. You remember. A boy in a robe shop, a broom over fire. A wand shared, blood spilt. A child’s laugh and a disownment’s pain. Fights and kisses and tender hearts and a love to transcend death. TV and takeout and a wedding aisle and and and…he starts fading.
Harry,
"PANSY! PANSY! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED!" Draco barrels through her house, pushing past all the house elves as he looks for her. "PANSY!"
Draco’s gaze is soft, and he hums quietly. “One more?” he implores. Harry gives him two more, and he feels Draco’s lips tug into a bigger smile under his own.
, Harry muses.
Potter looks around for another second before he turns to Draco and asks, "Walk me around?" Draco agrees nervously and leads him around to the Chrysanthemums to the right and the Camellias beside them and the Lotuses in the back. He's afraid that he'll turn into his obsessive flower scholar personality who rambles and is decidedly not sexy, but Potter keeps asking
“But he’s not pureblood,” Parkinson points out.
“Long day?” Harry asks.
“Well yes. Ron was a great strategist though.”
Even though you knew Potter wanted to kill you, it is still a surprise when you walk into the abandoned classroom Potter asked to meet you in, and he slams you into the opposite wall. Your head crashes painfully into the stone wall behind you. Potter's livid face swims in front of your eyes, and you know it's the end.
much, Draco! I am going to cry, but only because this is so… so
The owl tries to follow the package into the fire and Harry barely catches it before there is a fried owl in Malfoy's fireplace.
It’s going to be hard convincing the wizarding courts to take action for her
. Then the scent of sandalwood fills you up, and you feel the warmth of strong lean arms gather you up against a familiar chest. You should hate this, you should be as far away from the man who tried to kill you as possible, but instead you lift your chin between your sobs, and the wetness on Harry's cheek slips through your parched lips. Harry's voice chants your name into your hair, his rough fingers clutch your sides tight. "You're not worthless, Draco." He says, and you cry harder. So long you've waited to hear those very words from his mouth, so much you've done for them, so much you've given up. And now that he says them, you don't even know if you want them anymore. You don't know anything anymore. "I love you." Harry's voice is soft and tiny, and some piece of you breaks into tinier pieces when you hear his breath hitch. "I love you so, so much. Even when I wasn't supposed to, I loved you."
I turn on the blinkers and back out of the driveway, drowning out the rest of her sentence. Reverse, turn, drive. Stop sign, count till three.
He walks inside, and immediately fire-calls Hermione. She would know what to do.
? That I
I love you more than curry.
Harry looked straight at Draco. “It’s pretty.”
Draco pouts. It’s not his fault this is
. The kids run back into the field, and Harry pauses at the gate to watch them play. Once, even he was that tiny. Most the kids he fights for right now are that tiny. How could anyone look at these small faces, and want to hurt them? A drop of water falls on Harry’s face, and he rubs it off. Then he shakes his head, and continues walking.
Potter flushes prettily but pushes Draco away gently. Draco lets him. (Draco would let Potter do a lot of things, but that's besides the point here.) "Curry's my favourite too," Potter says and turns around to turn the flames off. "I'm just done. Here, let me carry everything out to the dinner table." The auror flicks his hand, and Draco watches in awe as the shelves open, and crockery rolls out and flies out the door clinking merrily along the way. The pot of curry and a pot of rice follows them, and a small line of spoons brings up the rear. Wandless
. Your eyes widen just enough that he bursts into roaring laughter again.
. White walls, black railings, green bushes—turn, and Pansy’s house rolls into nothingness on the rearview mirror.
"Yes, it is," he says firmly. "And I am going to put these in a vase near the shop door, so Potter can know that his affections are just as greatly returned."
Ron sputters and flails at being caught red-handed. "No? No. I was just. You know. Getting myself some coffee..." He trails off under Harry's raised eyebrow. And then he rubs the back of his neck and admits, "... at
The End
"I'M TRYING!" He manages to turn them upright, only to slam his head into a shop sign hanging out of a third floor window and turn them upside down again. By sheer luck, this time, Hermione's bag slips over her head and plummets to the ground below. The birds follow it down, and finally, they can both see again.
“Oh you two honestly,” Draco beams. “Stop being so sappy. I’ll hurt the both of you myself if the situation calls for it.”
“I haven’t a clue.” Harry grinned back, just as breathlessly.
“If we’re doing this whole exploring the forest thing together, I would rather have you call me Draco than Malfoy.” Malfoy explained quietly and smiled lightly at Harry.
"The longer you leave it, the more it's going to hurt, Harry. For both of you. You just go for it," Granger is saying.
Potter’s being weird. No insults, no jibs, no punches. He’s, dare I say, might actually be trying to befriend me. He called me ‘mate’ yesterday. How absurd. As if nothing happened during the war. As if I I haven’t accidentally almost killed his best mate, as if he hasn’t accidentally almost killed me. As if [indecipherable scribbles]. I don’t know what to do Pansy. I don’t know how to deal with this Potter who isn’t angry, who acts happy to see me. I just don’t know Pansy. Did I tell you we’ve even taken to only renting one room and then taking turns on the couch to save us the expense? Not that he needs to, but it was his suggestion, and I certainly couldn’t turn down the blessing of saving half the residential expenses of the trip. I wonder what he’s playing at.
"RON!"
Like always, Harry comes home to an empty house, a noisy head, and a full liquor rack. He jiggles the key out of the lock, throws his robes over the couch, and leaves his socks under the dining table. As always, the silent darkness makes his heart feel heavy; he turns on every light in the house. In those early days after leaving Hogwarts, all he needed to do was firecall someone, anyone, and he'd have company. But now it seemed as if everyone, even Ron and Hermione, was too busy for Harry. Relationships, kids, work—they'd all grown up. And left Harry behind. It was all fine by Harry though—he didn't want to be
As they came to a nice shady spot, and Potter pulled Draco down to sit on the ground with him. Weak the savior was.
PPS:  Malfoy says that I cannot count on sending letters everyday unless I want to be a cold cruel human being to the owls. :( He also says to tell you to not reply as we won’t be staying at this address for long enough to receive you owl. :( :(
Ron stuttered and ducked behind Hermione. Harry pulled him back from his collar.
He opened and closed his mouth a couple of times. And then he blurted, “But we’re supposed to be enemies! Archrivals!”
Tires on asphalt and drumming rain come crashing in; a screeching honk from in front of me. The steering wheel spins in my hands, and everything is spinning out of control, everything is shattering, shards of memories, of you all around me, and I can’t feel, can’t think. My foot slams down, and for a second I think I hit the accelerator, the seat belt cuts into my throat, and I remember I’m on a bridge,
Potter gave him a slanted look, the rising light illuminating the amused Green in his eyes.
“I already knew that guys. You all are terrible at keeping secrets. Neville told me the day you told me you coerced me into saying yes to this madness.”
“We can forgo calling the police,” he offers. “Keep it off both our records and all.”
Then Ginny picked up Harry’s hand and looked at him with a pleading expression. He might not dating her anymore, but that expression still made him cave to her every request. He already knew he was doomed. “Please Harry? We just want to take care of you. Look you don’t even have to do anything. Just let us book you a vacation yeah?” Harry furiously swirled his cold tea. “Harry. Please? Pretty please?”
They decided to camp in a space close to the river, but not right next to it. As the night fell, Harry set up a fire in front of the car. Draco had somehow hauled up their car to this clearing, and it sat in the corner with a bed for Fluffy made in the middle of the trunk. He had also put up basic wards around their camping spot to make sure they had no surprises in the middle of the night.
Ron laughs gleefully. "Even better!" With his hands still over his head, he holds the letter open. "Let me read it out loud for you!"
In the kitchen, Draco stands in front of the stove stirring a pot of something, swaying slightly. Harry pauses in the doorway. This close, he can hear the strains of Vivaldi playing from the counter. The drizzle outside has increased to a constant pitter patter, backdropping the now louder sizzling of the pan on the stove. Draco’s hair is getting longer, curling around his nape and into the collar of his healer robes. Harry stands there for a few moments longer and watches Draco cook for him. Then he moves to take the knife from Draco’s hand.
Ron, who is still about fifteen meters up in the air, ducks his head down to look at her, and nearly falls off his broom when he catches sight of his pregnant wife trying to whack a particularly enthusiastic peacock with her wand. Like a good husband, he immediately ignores her words, abandons the pygmy and dives.
During a lull in the conversation, Neville sat back on his heels.
Severus calls you into his office, and subtly tries to veer the discussion towards your tasks. Still and silent, you look around his office and note how easy it would be for him to hold you captive here, until you give him the answers he wants. You wonder if anyone would notice, if he killed you. You certainly wouldn't.
1st June 2000.
Teddy nods wisely and gives both Harry and Draco a side-eye. “Oh yes, he has the tendency to do that,” he says, and Harry feels like an absolute heel.
"Malfoy," Potter says and then trails off when Draco steps closer under the pretense of looking into the pot on the stove. "What are you"—Draco practically cages Potter into the counter and Potter's voice stutters—"doing?"
has it all. But this is a love story not an advertising piece, so none of this really matters (except the staff—please leave them love and tips).
One would think after the war... but no. The world could change, but family never moved an ell.
"I don't even know what you want me to explain!" cries Harry, trying to scramble up Ron's tall torso.
. His nose twitches and his lashes drip and his lips part. His grip on the cloak tightens reflexively. His chest feels so full,
When you get out of the ward, Theo deliberately trips you outside the common room and laughs when you fall over.
Draco quickly takes off his robes, rolls up his shirt sleeves, and ensures a couple of strands of his hair fall into his eyes. Hippogriffs are dancing in his tummy, and he thanks all his tutors for teaching him how to look bored and composed even when he was anything but. The door chimes, and he looks back down at his records, pretending not to notice the other man as Harry strides right up to the front desk.
You can't help the Gryffindors or the upper years. Whenever you go near them, suspicion and disgust follows you. You don't care very much. The other younger years are much better anyways. They learn how to pretend to be under the crucio when you pretend to cast it so well, that it takes the Carrows about a month and a half to figure it out. They chalk it up to you being too weak to cast a crucio and trying to cover it up. The Dark Lord holds you under the crucio for five minutes, but you don't mind. All that matters is that it wasn't your mother.
Harry loves him, how far that is from the truth. But his mouth feels glued shut.
And you wonder, every time he trailed his hand along your cheekbones, every time he whispered the horrors of his childhood into your ears, every time he clung to you as you cried—was it all a hoax? Was he refining his plot to kill you in the worst possible way every time he promised things would be alright? Did he scrub his skin of your disgusting touch after every time you made love? Were you even human for him?
“I’m sorry,” I say, not knowing what else to do. Then again, “I’m sorry. I hope no one’s- hurt.”
"Oh, Harry," Hermione says her bottom lip caught between her teeth and an apologetic smile on her face. "Come here." She wraps her arms around his shoulders and awkwardly drags him as close as she can. Ron too joins the hug from the other side to make a hug-Harry-sandwich (as soon as he stops laughing of course.) Harry's muscles lose their tension slowly and he relaxes into his best friends' embrace. They sit like that for a while. Then Harry sighs. "But what should I do?" he asks.
So, on this Wednesday, when Draco noticed Harry standing in front of
Harry shakes his head and whines, "But he's going to be so heartbroken, Hermione, he is. Those stupid things mean the world to him, how am I going to tell Draco that they weren't for

"We aren't even married yet, you nut."
Potter hummed sympathetically, and shuffled closer.
“Yeah I am good.” Harry said distractedly while peeling off his shoes and socks.
Fuck you.
“We should have been there an hour ago!” Harry whines, slamming his hand on the steering wheel.
Draco feels a bit put out. "What?" he snaps. "You don't think Potter could get me gifts?" Sticking his nose in the air, he sniffs loudly for emphasis. "Well, newsflash Pans, Harry gave me these...these glass sculptures and miniature baubles and these fluffy feathery things to signify his great undying muggle love for me."
anything else.
The playground, and I see you swinging Teddy in your arms; the pub tucked away on the street over, and you’re there drunk and laughing with your Gryffindors, winking at me thinking you’re slick except you’re really not, and I’ll just reach out and kiss you silly and- the parking lot where you introduced me to parallel parking, and the orange cones are up, a blue Mustang practicing, and you pop your head out from behind it, shifting the orange cones, showing me a thumbs up; and we’re on the street past that, examining a bit of graffiti and your tongue is sticking out as you add a little DM+HP to it; a motorbike is pulling up beside me, and you’re on it, pulling off your helmet, putting it on me, telling me to hold on as you pull into the air, and the ice cream parlour, the entrance to Diagon, the telephone to the Ministry you’d kiss me good day before work everyday; the restaurant where I was going to propose to you, and and and-
"I am good too," Potter replies awkwardly. A silence follows. It seems like Draco is going to have to do all the work here. Okay, that's okay too. He's suddenly terribly thirsty. "So tell me how is auror training treating you?" he asks Potter, putting away his record book.
When you look at him again, the whites of his eyes are red and wet, from crying, from the chill, from the rain, you don't know. His breaths are these great shuddering things that take you back to that night, his wand in your face, your heart stilled. Unlike Harry, your breaths are measured, slow, deep, and your eyelids are dry. Your hurt ran so deep, so cold, so old, that all you can do is feel numb, like a dead leaf twirling on an autumn tree, ready to fall, but unable to let go.
“... just don’t understand why you like it so much, Draco?”
"Er okay," says Potter. "Let's go to this pizza place I found a while ago with Ron, They have the best stuff ever."
Instead he slaps his hands against the floor and wails, “You’re not supposed to kiss Santa Claus!”
Granger frowns when you tell her about your idea of turning spy. The next day, she gives you a coin to communicate with her.
“Very,” Draco agrees, and as if he were waiting for just that question, he immediately launches into a long rant about the new trainees and the two massive cases that came in today and the spider in his lunch sandwich and how his back hurts. Harry nods and hums at all the right spots, refilling Draco’s rice as soon as he’s done.
"Did you like it?" He grins wickedly. "My gift?" At your blank stare, he grins wider. "The poisoned mead you were going to give to Slughorn? I passed it onto the Weasel."
. He crosses his arms and raises his eyebrows. Harry grimaces, then makes a pleading face back at Draco.
Your selection includes:
Then you think of never kissing that dip near his hip-bones. Of never feeling his fingers wrap around your wrists. Of serving the Dark Lord trying to kill the man you love.
Spoiler alert: they'd in fact stunned the wrong owl. Harry was
Hermione finally huffed. “Honestly Harry. Ever since you saw him at Luna’s party, all of our conversations somehow lead up to ‘I wonder what Malfoy is up to these days. Once I found out he was a travel companion, well. This course of action was obviously the most natural to take. You two can figure everything out within the next week or so.”
Parkinson’s smile could cut stone. “Draco may not recognize a glass dildo when he sees one,” she says conversationally, “but I do.” Harry goes cold.
. Who wouldn't after all? What if you knock it over or accidentally put it in mud or or or—"
eyes, and he stutters back a greeting. "Been long hasn't it?" he says, his eyes taking in Potter's messy black hair, his strong capable hands, his lean strong legs. He hasn't been this close to Potter since Hogwarts, and
PS: Yes that extra ‘Love Harry’ was meant to annoy you Hermione. I’m not sorry.
"It's been like a day since our last plan," Harry groans.
For a moment the thought that perhaps Potter doesn't like him flits across his mind, but Draco quickly shakes it off. He'd rather have fun now and worry later than worry now
this?"
She kneels and picks up your hand, without flinching though you both know the filth and germs thriving on your skin. With a firm voice and firmer eyes, she says, "I will get you out of here Draco."
Dear Pansy,
"I'm," he tries to say through his voice breaking. "I'm so sorry." His voice trails into a whisper, and he's horrified to feel the lump in his throat grow exponentially. "This...wasn't supposed to happen."
"I like it," decides Potter, and for no reason, Draco feels like he swallowed a gallon of extra air. "It's very pretty and tasteful. Just like you-errrr-" Potter trips and it makes Draco feel a little better to get his flustered Potter back. "Your general aura. I mean. Very pureblood, kind of, er - like sophisticated. Very much like something you would like er-"
Harry flushes, and unwillingly his eyes stray upwards. His lips and throat suddenly feel incredibly dry, and he can feel sweat gathering in the dip of his spine.
United Kingdom
“Take care son.” Arthur patted Harry on the back and walked off after his wife.
Shite.
Hermione spluttered indignantly. Ron on the other hand looked incredibly relieved. “So I’m off the hook right mate?” Harry slapped Ron’s shoulder and laughed some more at Hermione’s annoyed expression.
I wait until his car pulls away before rolling up my window. I wipe my face and drink some water. Check the mirrors, take some deep breaths. Spell the inside dry. Then I start the car again. I flick on the headlights, which I should’ve done ages ago. And I pull out slowly, steadily. Maybe I should’ve brought Pansy along with me. Maybe, I shouldn’t have taken the long way around. No matter, it’s not far now. I keep my eyes on the road right in front, but you don’t appear anyways.
(It was in fact not that easy. But we diverge.)
Finally Potter throws up his hands. He points his wand at you again, and says, deep and dark with promise, "The next time I see you, I swear to Merlin, I
“Draco…” Pansy’s hovering at the entrance of the garage, looking concerned and pitying, acting as if her voice will convince me to not go.

liar. But, Draco doesn't think there is a drop of malice in whatever happened today. After six years at Hogwarts as rivals and low-key mutual stalkers, a seventh on opposing sides of a war, and an eighth living in the same quarters, Draco knows ill-will and stalking in Potter's face all too well. And there was none of that today. No, the shade of Hogwarts Express that Potter had turned—it had to be something embarrassing for Potter. Something romantic. Something sexual, perhaps. So, Draco's willing to let it slide. Harry will tell him in due time, he's sure.
When they ask you to identify Potter, you want to say no. But then your brain catches up to your mouth, and you say, "I can't be sure" instead. In the other room, Granger screams under the crucio. The Weasel shouts too, and Luna is shifting in her cell shaking her head at you, and you focus on Potter's swollen face instead. He recognizes you. Of course he recognizes you.
Perhaps, you may think, this is it. This tale of how Harry and Draco got into a relationship. Perhaps this is how it ends: in Draco's apartment, under decorative sex toys, next to two boys learning to navigate each other. Perhaps this is where it starts, the story of the rest of their lives—of how Harry will always return from lunch with flowers tucked into his hair, of how Draco will start becoming a fixture in the future Head Auror's office, of how they will end up adopting three children and two cats, of how they will grow old together and become that sweet old couple on the block who everyone envies.
“HARRY PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!” shrieked Draco, covering Fluffy’s eyes.
“That’s me up there,” said Draco, looking up at the night sky.
. You hope he chokes on the truth.
to a stranger.
But you write down the apparition coordinates anyways.
As they got on the elevator, Hermione huffed. “It’s not even that big of a deal. Just… You know how Molly wanted to hire you a travel companion, so you would feel more comfortable abroad alone?”
He opens the folder again. Name, age, date filed, address, guardians… His eyes drift to the top right, to the blue eyes of a young girl. Even in a wizarding photo, she holds herself so still and quiet—as if she was trying to fold into herself, not bother anyone with her existence. He takes off his glasses and rubs his hands over his eyes.
Everything’s still. Outside, the rain continues to fall. Inside, all I hear is my heart thumping. The dash gleams a steady blue; the only light in the middle of this storm. Am I even breathing? I can’t tell. Maybe I am dead. Maybe I should be dead. The last shards of your presence are gone now, and I’m all alone again. In your car. Slowly, I pry my fingers off the wheel, one by one. I put my car in park and take my foot off the brake. I raise my hand and it’s steady. I’m steady. I’m alive.
Wednesday... WEDNESDAY. Harry drops his head into his hands and groans, "Oh my god."
“Of course I’m choosing Fluffy over you! At least she doesn’t tease me like you do!”
Potter mumbles something, and they apparate into a London alleyway. The pizza place turns out to be this little hole-in the wall kind of place that Draco would never go to alone: the air smells of oregano and cheese, the tables feel a bit too greasy, the menus aren't shiny enough. As he takes his first tentative bite under Potter's hopeful gaze, he's fully prepared to pretend to love it for Harry's sake while hating it inside (and then perhaps it would become a
Their paddy farms were so peaceful. After we agreed to come to the marriage, one of their older daughters and her husband decided that they were going to take us around Bhubaneshwar. It was so much fun!
Somewhere in the Forbidden Forest, your mother lies to the Dark Lord's face to save the man she knew you loved.
On the 31st, You find yourself at the edge of Thames. Like on any proper London summer day, a thunderstorm is quite close. When you were a kid, they would scare you something honest. Now, you barely blink as the dark clouds gather over the roiling river.
"Hmm?" Harry replies sleepily.
Neville rubbed the back of his neck. “I was talking to Hermione just an hour ago about this emergency meeting McGonagall called. Apparently somebody decided that dumping an entire lot of U-No-Poo into the Hogwarts supplies would be a fun prank. I swear Harry. George better not have given them the idea.”
“I… er…” What the fuck does even one say in this kind of situation? Harry sure as hell doesn’t know.
Harry sputters some more and then pouts. He thought he hadn’t been obvious for once in his life, but clearly, some things just aren't meant to be. "But, but, but..."
Parkinson, however, seems to have no such compunctions. She ignores his small talk in favour of looking meaningfully at the vase above the both of them. “So, Potter,” she drawls smirking nastily, “I heard you gave Draco
Draco laughed, petting Fluffy a little. Draco had a good laugh. “Wow Harry.” Harry liked the way Draco said his name, with a slight roll on a puff of air. “What an awkward little duck.” Harry blushed. “It’s okay I get what you mean. I didn’t know what to do with myself after the war. Mother was exiled from England, and the only reason I wasn’t in Azkaban was because of your testimony. Thanks again by the way for that.”
The walls in the tower are damp under your fingertips. Your feet are silent on mouldy rock. Harry was the one thing that made you feel alive, and now you feel as if you are nothing but steam, floating away into the abyss. You hear it again and again, Harry's voice saying, ‘
Harry made a vague sound and then disappeared deeper into his cabinets waving his lit wand.
Draco’s right; Harry will always figure out a way to fix things. But that’s a job for future Harry. And as far as the past is concerned… it’s in the past. Harry and Draco are here, in the present, in each other's arms, within the home they’ve built for themselves. Harry’s arms tighten around his dragon, and he slowly drifts into dreamland. They are home now. That’s all that matters.
“You know when I was young, sometimes I would dream of running away and becoming a farmhand.” Potter murmured, pulling at the grass near the base of the tree he was leaning against. “Guessed even a barn would be a better place to grow up than a bloody cupboard. Thought I could find someone to take me in, so I’d have a family too.”
You barely blink as the potion in you answers for you. "Because I love Harry Potter."
Your heart cries. Happiness. Fidelity. Protection. And a stalker, a kidnapping. Screams, sacrifices and a knife to the chest; a grief so deep, so
“He still thinks you’re Santa, you tosser,” Draco hisses, trying his best to grab hold of their child before he falls down the stairs. “Change back and fix this!”
By midday, they had reached the banks of a large stream of water. Harry dropped their conversation, and ran towards the stream.
Parkinson groans and cuts him off mid-sentence. “Stop lying, Potter. Just tell the fucking truth. You’re a bloody Gryffindor, for magic’s sake. Lying and hiding things isn’t going to win you any favours. How much more are you going to twist yourself up to keep Draco from knowing? ”
“Aww. C’mon Draco. You can make a nest for Fluffy near the bank. Or put her in a tree or something.”
Harry buries his face in one hand, the perfect picture of a remorseful boyfriend. You want to forgive him. You want to gather his frostbitten hands in your own trembling ones. You want to kiss each frosty finger, to reassure him, to hold him close and to never let go.
Draco’s face pops out from behind the door frame. “But we’re home now.”
"Then it's settled," Hermione nods, ignoring the rest of what Harry says. Ron nods with her. Then she reaches into her purse, and both Harry and Ron goggle as out come stacks of books with all kinds of birds on their covers. "I went ahead and got all this beforehand. Kidnapping owls is, after all, serious business."
Harry kicked at the foliage beneath his feet. “I used to teach Defense at Hogwarts. Well I say used to, but really I only did it for one year before I took a break.”
Ron beams, "Sabotage! I knew there was a reason I married you!"
Now Draco stood out on the porch overlooking the valley and beyond. The hills looked sharp and fresh in the brightening sky right before sunrise, standing still for a perfect picture. A hot cup of tea rested between his hands, hot air twirling up in wisps towards the trees overhead. Draco felt utterly relaxed. Potter had stopped throwing up on the hour yesterday, and Draco hoped he wouldn’t throw up at all today. They were going to be driving through some of the prettiest parts of their drive today, and he didn’t need Potter bollocksing it all up with vomit everywhere.
Suddenly in a much chipper mood, Draco bounces off to the next row. “C’mon, Harry! You know the
Scorpius’ sobs trail off into hiccups and he sticks his fingers in his mouth. There is a moment of almost silence. Then with wide eyes and a trembling voice, Scorpius whispers around his fingers, “Santa isn’t real?”
“Breakfast’s done,” Potter whispered.
Draco has a brief vision of that gruff voice talking all kinds of filth to him and nearly passes out. He has to physically shake his head to get his libido under control. He looks up through his blonde, nearly invisible lashes, and says, "Yes, Potter? How may I help you?"
Draco smiled. “Anyways. I was pretty torn up. When Pansy found out I was holed up in my room for the fifth day straight, she bought me one way tickets to Hawaii and moved into our villa. She’s a right bint when she wants to be, so I actually did go, and voila. I found that I liked travelling. I get to see exciting new places, understand people different from me. It’s exactly what I needed. The world view I had grown up had been shattered to bits during the war. And travelling let me rebuild it a little at a time. But the Malfoy vaults weren’t exactly full after the compensation we paid during the trials. So I went and found myself a job that paid me to travel. And,” Draco spread his arms, “here I am.”
Harry's face went stonier than it already was. His voice, when he spoke, promised just as much death as his face. He almost looked like Father in an unholy rage. "You don't get to tell me who I am, Hermione," he drawled. "I can kill whoever I so please. Anyways, you don't

Eventually though, all good things must come to an end, and so does Potter's lunch break. Potter leaves with a magically protected Iris on his lapel. But before he goes, Potter turns around and says, "This was fun Malfoy. Catching up with you. We should meet up again, not during my lunch break, so we can, like, hang out."
Harry scrambles nervously. "Did I say cook? Haha, er... I meant er, to ask you to cook me. I mean to ask you to cook lunch with me." He takes in a deep breath. "Eat lunch with me and I cook." He can feel a red flush travel all across his cheeks. He hopes Malfoy buys it; Harry has never been great at lying, and ever since the stakes have gone down after the war, it seems to have only gotten worse. "I'm really sorry," he says sincerely. "I understand if you hate me. I would hate me too. I really didn't mean to knock everything over. I just got overly zealous fighting with your owl."
. I slip my hand under the door handle and gently open her up.
Harry had never had a change of moods quicker. He drove their car a bit further into the forest off the road, and they both got down from the car. As Harry charmed their car to look like a big rock and attached a tracking charm to it, Malfoy made quick work of shrinking their luggage and tucked it away into the pocket Fluffy wasn’t in. Content with their set up, they both then decided to walk about a little.
For reasons, this sets Pansy off even more, and she practically guffaws. "I'm sure," she gets out, "that Harry's love for you," another round of giggles, "is very big."
Of course, Potter would leave his door open. What would happen if a reporter found his apartment? Or worse yet a Dark Lord sympathizer?
, and he wants to cry and laugh and everything in between and beyond, and he wants- he wants to- he can’t-
, you think. You always came. Like a pet trained by its owner, at the glance of Harry's eyes, at the crook of his finger, at the murmur of your name. "I didn't think you would." You shouldn't have. If you had any sense, the first time you saw him lost and small at Madam Malkins, you should've run far far away from this boy with a nest for his hair and the forest for his eyes.
"I didn't need to hear that. And anyway, you're jumping the gun here, guys," insists Harry, reeling his friends in. Really, they could come up with the most ridiculous things sometimes.
Hey Draco, Harry wants to say, I’ve got something to tell you. He’s going to say it. He is.
They both burst out laughing. Draco’s imitation started off a chain of imitations of other teachers and students from Hogwarts. As they talked, they inched closer and closer, until they were pressed up against one another from shoulder to knee. As Harry turned to Draco after one particularly lively retelling of the seventh years breaking into McGonagall’s alcohol stores, he found Draco already looking at him with an intense look on his face. His eyes were bright by the fireside. Slowly, Harry leaned in a placed a short kiss on Draco’s lips. Draco’s eyes fluttered close, his lashes a brilliant gold.
It is only when you go to sleep that night that you realize that you never asked for her name.
. “But we aren’t even doing anything…”
Unfortunately, Harry isn't a man of refined tastes, and all he can see is the dildo. And well the anal beads. And the pumpkin vibrators inside the magic orbs. And the bondage silks and rope.
Cars honk behind me, and I choke on a sound (
you should take a vacation.”
"A date! Oh, Harry, you move quickly don't you!" Hermione exclaims. Ron nods vigorously, his eyes proud.
Suddenly, even bigger tears well in Scorpius’ eyes and he wails louder than ever. “NO SANTA CLAUS!” he screams, thrashing about in Harry’s grasp. “DADDY SAYS NO SANTA CLAUS!”
No one comes to visit you after Granger leaves (once you imagine you can hear Potter’s breath at night). You lay still the entire time and think of everything yet nothing at all.
A snowflake floats onto your right cheek. The sky is cloudless which means the flecks of snow fall from the stars just like grandfather's favourite snow globe. Another settles on your brow. It feels almost as soft as Harry's hair. You think of the nights you spent talking to him with your hands in his messy locks. You think of the way his smiles have gotten more beautiful these last weeks, the way he has started saying your name like a prayer, a love letter. You think of the happiness he filled your world with, even if it was only for the briefest of moments.
October 18
,” she'd smile. “
“A nice tumble in the sheets?”
Malfoy still looks a little unsure, but the anger and hurt are slowly draining from his face. "Lunch? As in right now?"
Harry pouts. “I’m also a Malfoy. Technically.”
Parkinson looks at Harry surreptitiously. Then she says, “But still. I’ve never seen you get this way about a gift before.”
"RON!" Harry squawks and tries climbing up Ron again. He'd seen that kit, yes, and he'd imagined the way Draco would look in half of those things, but a confirmation of shipping? When did he buy it? "Give it back!" Ron guffaws and tries to read what it says. "RON! I didn't order anything! I need to read it!"
"That's not the issue here, Hermione," Ron intercepts, coming to Harry's rescue.
Santa Claus.”
Draco let out a sympathetic noise. “Hermione’s still at Hogwarts though isn’t she?” he asked.
always right. After all, if it were left up to Harry, would they ever have gotten together? Then the orange dildo bobs violently in the periphery of Harry's vision.
Harry puts his glass down, leans forward on his knees and puts his face in his hands. "efoudaoysninksisamuggacoushigif." Harry mumbles.
The last dregs of daylight spill across Harry’s table, catching on the number ‘nine’ at the edge of his manilla folder. It’s blocky and big, a script he doesn’t quite recognize. A new employee, he supposes. Or perhaps it has just been that long since he’s last handled such cases. Harry’s childhood’s long been an open secret around the department, and there’s an unspoken agreement to try not to give him any cases that resemble it too closely.
Ron wraps an arm around Harry. "Mate," he comforts. "I don't understand why you care about that ferret, but even I can tell Malfoy doesn't hate you. Why would you think he hates you?"
Partially cloudy
Today, though, it isn't the loneliness that presses down on him. Or, at least, not only the loneliness. When he closes his eyes tonight, all he can see are grey eyes, blonde hair tips and a wicked snarky mouth. Date flowers. Gods. What a fool! He cracks open a bottle and chases his mortification down with burning alcohol. Such a fool! He's not surprised Malfoy was so eager to get rid of him Why did he get so stupid? All he had to do was ask how Malfoy was doing like a normal person! The ghost of long fine fingers presses down on his elbow, soft breathy laughter blows across his ears, and he takes another swig. Sweet, sweet Merlin. That arse clad in blue trousers. Malfoy was something else entirely. But date flowers? Really? He collapses on the couch, a half-empty firewhiskey bottle in hand and a strong desire to get sloshed in mind. It doesn't take him long.
“Yes, I will.”
We went to Charminar. There were a lot of people. We ate some biryani for lunch. It was spicy. I couldn’t handle it that much, but Malfoy was eating tons of chillis as well. I wonder how he got his spice tolerance. It was warm and sunny (sunny!). Wow, I never realized how hard writing a travel journal really is. Malfoy’s reading over my shoulder. He just insulted my lack of eloquence and my plebian English. Then we went to this lake. Malfoy says it was called Hussain something. But he also says we went there on the 17
, but they were also inexplicably thrilling. Every new, dare you say, kind friendly gesture, meant another night spent obsessing over what it meant, what Potter wanted, what he would do next. And since thinking about Potter meant you weren't thinking about the brand on your arm or the poison in your trunk or the corpses at your home, you let yourself think and obsess and watch over Potter in a way you never had before. And you started noticing
Draco flushes. "Yes, well. I like flowers." Draco feels a bit self-conscious as Harry's eyes rove over his entire shop.
and from within it, my driver license, brand new, minted just today. In the middle beside a picture of my grim face, it says
"I-err," mumbles Harry. "I might have told him that when he saw his name on the package."
“Yeah,” Harry says. He feels a bit sick and guilty and pathetic. “See you.”
All the hairs along Harry’s arm rise in parental foreboding. He laughs weakly, shooting Draco an alarmed look. “I didn’t say that…”
Harry crosses the wooden floor, his steps in time to the rhythm of Draco’s beating heart pressed up close to his own, and at the stairs he has to adjust the man in his arms again to see the stairs beneath them. This time, Draco’s answering shift is sharper, tenser, a little more awake, as he tries to burrow into Harry’s chest. Harry stills. Two moist lips flutter at the skin of his neck, the steady rhythm of hot breaths blowing across it stuttering for a second. Then it smoothes out, and Draco goes limper than he was before. Harry moves one of his arms upwards to lay a hand on Draco’s lower back, feeling it move in measured breaths. With every step upwards, the muscles under his touch tense and loosen, and a soft smile flits across Harry’s face.
. Like real fun. Genuine non-flirty fun. He'd be lying if that doesn't make a piece of his heart irrevocably Potter's.
“Yeah,” he says gruffly. Parkinson nods at him. And then Harry understands. She meant for him to overhear their conversation. Parkinson isn’t trying to tell Draco; she’s trying to guilt Harry into telling Draco himself. It’s working.
“Darling,” Draco says, his voice softer than freshly fallen snow, and Harry must- he can’t
Harry huffs out a laugh and steps closer to Draco. “Would this price perchance be a kiss?” Draco winks. “Come here, you incorrigible man,” he murmurs and kisses Draco, once, twice, thrice, four times. “That enough for you?”
The British Wizarding World
Then Molly smushed his head to her neck again, blubbering about how if he loves them he’ll go on this vacation. He won’t survive past the next two minutes. No he was strong, he was capable, he was…. And Ginny behind him pinched his arm. Hard. Harry shrieked. Time to call in backup. “RON! HELP!”
, Draco thinks fondly. As he approaches, he can hear everything that's going on. "I don’t know how to do this, Hermione," Harry is groaning, and Draco's steps falter. He knows he shouldn't eavesdrop, but damn it, he's
“I’m sorry, dear,” Draco tries again. “I promise I wasn’t…”
You want to agree with her. But you remember the light in Harry's eyes, and you have to wonder—how could that not be him? How could that be the same man who fucked you slow and sweet and brought you ice cream when he saw you fail your potions test. You say nothing. You've nothing to say. The room is spinning. You put your hands behind yourself to stay upright.
You want to say,
sometimes.
Ron just shook his head and pulled on his socks. “I’m not going to disagree with the wife, mate.” Ron brushed a kiss across Hermione’s cheekbone and slapped Harry on the back. “Sides Harry she’s right. You really do need to get out of England for a bit. Roam the world, experience life and all that good stuff.” That was
, and you scream. "Well guess what Potter! So did I! I knew I deserved every bit of shitty piece of life fate doled out to me! I knew I was worthless! You didn't have to cook up a plan to murder me to drive it home! I knew, Potter, I knew!" You scream and you scream, and when your voice breaks, you break into sobs, whispering “
. Potter usually only appears half an hour after his lunch break starts, and never in anything other than his red training auror robes over his tatty jeans. And for the last few days since Draco had flirted with him, Potter hadn't shown at all. Draco had thought maybe he'd been too forward and scared Potter off, or maybe he hadn't been enough and Potter had lost interest, or maybe Harry was straight after all and it was Potter's old stalkerish tendencies flaring when he stared at Draco through
"Oh he will," Pansy assures him with a wicked smirk. "He will be thrilled."
"Well it's dated to Thursday," observes Hermione. "Whoever it was, ordered it Wednesday evening or sometime Thursday morning."
"Harry," Hermione says carefully. "You do want to date Malfoy right?"
Sunny
"To your liking, oh Saviour?" he whispers into Potter's ears. He didn't think it was physically possible, but Potter's face becomes even redder.
I’m at breakfast right now, waiting for Malfoy to show up right now, if he ever decides to show up. He’s probably too busy doing yoga. Oh by the way MALFOY DOES YOGA! I didn’t know that! I wonder where he picked it up from. I walked in on him doing yoga and I swear. He wasn’t even wearing a bloody undershirt.
It takes them about half an hour to put Draco's shop to rights again. Potter apologizes profusely again and again as they work, but Draco waves it all away. Yes, it hurts to see his precious shop trashed, but he has magic for a reason. Now, Draco is no fool. He sure hasn't forgiven Potter completely—of course not. There was something Potter was trying to hide; Potter is a
“Yeah.”
Pansy leans forward excitedly. "Let's see it then."
Harry grumbled. “Of course she does. She always has a reason.”
over and over under your breath.
Oh Merlin, you probably just went along with me as I manhandled you into a relationship." He pushes Harry away from him. "I'm so… I'm so sorry, I'm so," he gasps.
“You look very handsome,” he murmurs, looking appreciatively at Harry in the mirror.
I’ve spent the last two years building myself up, getting over you. I’m happier than ever. I’m better without you. Please let me alone.
Love Harry.
In their room, Harry lays his dragon down on the bed, draws the duvet over him and leans over to kiss his forehead. “I know you’re awake,” he murmurs, tucking blonde hair behind two pointy ears.
“What is this? Put on a bit of pudge, have we?” his husband crows, coming up behind him to poke at his belly. Harry slaps Draco’s hands away.
You'd been so grateful, that you even forgot to question how Potter had failed this potion after months of acing Slughorn's class.
Draco feels like he's going to float away like a balloon.
and he seems interested, and before Draco knows it he is rambling and happily explaining Victorian flower language and Potter's nodding along and Draco's having
"Ron. Ron, that's not even my address."
(Now you wonder at your naivety. Friends are for proper people—people who aren't death eaters or selfish or unlovable or you.)
Except. As the fleck gets bigger, a rumble starts up behind her.
"I get it, Potter," he says and his voice shakes slightly. He turns away from Potter. "It was my fault. I was the one who assumed it was a gift, a token of your affection."
"You should talk to him," Luna says. Harry sputters.
“But what about Fluffy?”
She’s as blue as the first night I saw her.
. To his surprise, the door swings open soundlessly. He shakes his head.
“Harry, look. Elephants,” said Draco, breathy with awe.
. "We're magic!" Hermione yells. "Stun it!" She slows down and clings to the railing as she tries to catch her breath. "STUN IT RON!" A red flash streaks past the owl and bounces off the walls of the neighbouring shop. Another one bounces off a boiler, before a third one hits its mark, and the drops like a stone. For a second they both just stare at the place the owl was. Then Ron hoots and rushes back over to his wife. "We did it, Mione! Mione! We saved Harry!"
It finally happens two weeks later. Your confrontation with Potter. Later you find out it wasn't anything you did that tips Potter over, but it happens nonetheless, and it changes your life forever.
you want to say.
The first time Harry kissed you was under the mistletoe. You'd stayed back for Christmas to work on the cabinet (not that you had any hope for progress). When you informed Mother, Bella wrote back to you, a letter brimming with dark promises of power and sadism at your success. If only they were promises of peace and life, instead of a reminder that even if you saved your family for now, the pain wasn't ever going to end. The fire licked your fingers when you burnt the parchment covered in enough dark residue to kill a muggle, and then you went to the kitchens in search of Harry.
Draco huffed, and crossed his arms. “Of course not!”
thrilled Harry is when he finds his sex toys displayed in the middle of Draco's center table. Harry had resolved to put the whole Pleasure Kit for Draco debacle behind him; that chapter of his life was
“You tell me Malfoy. What’s going on that pretty golden head of yours?”
Draco pouts. "I want a divorce."
for- I just want to hide myself away in here, want to hide this away in me, want to hide
"Did dinner not go well?" asks Hermione, her brow furrowing. "Did you fuck up?"
“Alright.” Harry sighed.
He is yelling something and slamming you over and over again into the wall. You feel blood trickle down your collar, and you can hear lightning crack in the distance. He accuses you of poisoning Ron. He accuses you of a lot of things. You pay it no mind. You savor the feel of his breath on your mouth, of his fingers clutching your neck, even if it is in rage instead of love. He throws you onto the ground across from him. Iron hot pain flashes through your knee, and you back up to the wall. Potter's eyes are full of hatred as he raises his wand, and you are surprised at how much it hurts. Outside the window, the beat of rain on the shingles quickens into a loud drumming frenzy. He opens his mouth and you close your eyes, not knowing what to expect. You wonder if you will like the way you go out. You wonder what flowers Mother and Father will use for your funeral.
“Hey Malfoy?”
The only topic she doesn't touch on is Harry Potter. You don't ask. You're happy never to acknowledge his existence ever again.
You will remember nothing else from this night, except for the betrayal in Potter's face when he looks at you. It tickles you a little how he expected you to be the good guy after spending a year torturing you for being bad.
“Draco EWWW. THEY’RE MY FRIENDS YOU BERK! Stop! Stop!”
Malfoy hummed. “Let’s take a break then. Lay a sheet on the ground under these trees. Explore a little. The like. You should know. You’re a Gryffindor.”
, and you’re in the ballroom. A mirror, and there’s a man behind you.
Draco grinned. “Always knew she was the brains of your group.”
The first stroke of Harry’s warmed and oiled hands across Draco’s back draws a hum of pleasure. Harry digs his fingers in, seeking the bundles of tension and rubbing at them until all the muscles in Draco’s back feel like butter. As his fingers move, his mind begins to drift back to the notes in the second drawer of his cabinet. His brow furrows as his mind walks through the details all over again.
, when he says “I love you.”
Slowly she turns around. With a sinking sensation, she realizes she forgot to factor in the sheer enormity of bird population at any time at the owlery and the menagerie across from the road. At least a dozen birds, owls and non-owls alike, dive towards her big bag of goodies. She screams. With a loud snap, the trap closes on two birds and a half, and in the ensuing ruckus and panic, it's a wonder she emerges with only two small scratches.
“I’m sorry.” Potter looked at him, his green eyes shining.
, but apparently you cared enough to care about spilled moonstone to want to
and he’s gone.
“At least take one of us with you, Draco, come on.”
"I happen to like your left bollock, Ron," grumbles Hermione. Harry gags. "Don't go around betting it."
"Oh! You mean like a courtship gift!"
Harry was reorganizing his spices for the third time that day when Hermione first brought it up.
Today as always, the front of
Cloudy
Draco is trembling all over now. He turns his mouth over into Potter's hand. "Yes," he murmurs and kisses Potter's palm. "Yes." He lifts his head, and his lips meet Potter's.
You miss Azkaban.
Draco makes a face. “Unfortunately.”
The first time you kiss him after the war is just as bitter-sweet as the last time you kissed him before it.
"Of course it does," chides Potter, and as if a dam has opened, he's suddenly much more talkative. "You did manage to open your flower shop," he says smiling lightly.
Harry stares at him, unamused. “
Harry turned a bright red and squeaked. “That’s not true. Take that back!”
to climb- uh, I mean decorate!”
Draco sighs. “I… Just its Harry, you know. It’s just the fact that Harry planned it so perfectly to ask me out. For me! He did it for me!” Draco looks down. “After the war, I didn’t think anyone would ever do anything like that for me. Even before the war, it’s always just been my parents, and you and Blaise.” He sighs. “I know I’m not the easiest person to like. But Harry… For Harry to give me a gift… A gift chosen specifically for me, not just a formal flower arrangement or a crockery set or jewellery… Pans, you know how it is in pureblood traditions.” Harry can’t see Draco’s eyes, but he has the strongest suspicion that they’re a bit wet. (Or perhaps it's Harry’s own eyes that are wet, and Harry’s just projecting. Or maybe it’s both.)
"Oh, Godric's pants," Ron groans. "What if George saw us?" They both cringe at the thought.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah," Potter bops his head with his eyes closed and twirls around with a spatula in the air, showing off the long, lithe line of his body. Draco's mind breaks a little, and he gurgles. Just a little. Potter freezes. His green eyes are wide when he turns around. Draco watches Potter's Adam's apple move up and down as he gulps.
You didn't go back to the cabinet the next day. Or the day after. Or the one after that. It wasn't like the Dark Lord planned on you succeeding. You were done being a Malfoy. (What a fool you were, thinking being a Malfoy was something you could run away from.)
The first time Harry made love to you, it'd been a week since you'd been to the seventh floor. Father had owled you just an hour ago about rumors of you betraying the cause. (When did he get out of Azkaban?) You wrote back:
“Draco.”
Except, this Wednesday, for some reason, Luna is also at
"He's just a dumb kid, Harry!"
“She must have spotted it when she was falling out of the tree herself.” Draco murmured in agreement.
You both kneel on the cement, crying, until the rain stops, and the dawn breaks. You shouldn't do this. You don't deserve him. He doesn't deserve you. There's a thousand things wrong with loving your murderer, with loving an ex-Death Eater. He pushes the hair back from your forehead, and you close your eyes. An apology doesn't do anything, not when it's for almost murdering your boyfriend. And you know trying again with Potter will end in nothing but pain. You know it's not healthy, it's not good.
You lock every single page of his writing in your study. When Granger inquires about Potter's letters, you don't tell her anything.
"Whuhh?" Potter blinks at him.
“It was a rumor floating around Hogwarts for a while in fifth year. I’m assuming it wasn’t true?”
"Draco's not in my league at all," mopes Harry. "Even with good clothes, Hermione. He and I, we're just not going to happen. He's just too gorgeous for me."
As always Granger was spot on. The Prophet goes wild over the heartrending romance between the savior and the Death Eater. Even if Wizengamot had decided to stick you into Azkaban, public opinion would have bought you your freedom.
When Fenrir steps out of the cabinet, you wish she had listened to you. He grins at you and the warm putrid smell of rotting flesh wafts right into your face. Aunt Bella slaps your back, and every part of you vibrates down to your toes. Like a man stepping up to a noose, you make your way to the top of the astronomy tower. When Dumbledore offers his protection, your wand doesn't waver. Protection doesn't matter shite to once you have accepted your death. When you can't conjure up enough killing intent to successfully kill Dumbledore, Severus steps in and does it for you.
"They don't know though," you whisper.
Draco blinks sweetly at him and smiles. “For today. For the past month. For everything.” Draco pulls closer and lays his head on Harry’s shoulder. “For being so wonderful.”
Harry gives up and just hangs off his best friend’s arm. There was no stopping Ron now.
“Mhm.”
All the colour drains from both the Gryffindor's faces. "Draco," pleads Harry, getting up and reaching towards him. "I know how this sounds, but trust me, it's not..."
Suddenly, Pansy
Harry nods with a grimace.
Despite his aversion to letting Draco get attached to noisy toys in his animagus form, Harry can’t help a smile from creeping onto his face. He pulls the ribbon and tips the box over, spilling lighted green, yellow, and red balls onto the floor. Instantly, where his husband sat, is nothing but a dent made by small feet pushing off the couch.
"Well, I forgot to put the box away when he came over for dinner, and then he saw his name on it and asked me what I got him for a gift." His voice gets more and more frantic as he progresses through his rant. "Then I panicked and I told him they were a muggle thing for someone's partner and then he was like, like an intimate partner and I said yeah, like you were courting someone and then he assumed it was a declaration of my undying love for him and I was too weak to explain the truth so we're dating now but it's based on a lie and oh Merlin he told me to call him by his first name but then we were boyfriends already and OH MY GOSH Malfoy's going to KILL me!" By now Ron's alternating between crying and shaking, and Hermione too is biting her lips as if she's trying hard not to react. Harry's neck gets uncomfortably warm, and he sinks lower in his seat to hide his face behind his knees. "What am I going to do?" he moans pitifully. "I can't dig myself out of
Pansy's red in the face by now, and Draco just wants to shake her. "Oh, oh,
“Wow. This is. It’s brilliant.”
Harry struggled to keep his act straight. Hermione only said that when she was feeling guilty about some masterplan she’d involved him without his knowledge. “Hermione, what did you do?” Of course he did know what she did, but this opportunity was just too golden to pass.
His cloak pools on the floor like molten silver. “Yes,” his trembling lips say. His eyes flutter close and his head drops back onto the wall.
do that.
"Potteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!"
It happened on a Saturday afternoon, exactly four weeks and four days after the Wednesday that started it all. The sun is soft, the winds cool, the trees almost bare. It's one of the last weekends before autumn dawns and winter creeps in. Draco had been insisting on calling his friends over to officially introduce Harry as his boyfriend, and this was the afternoon which they’d settled on.
"Draco, no wait! You've got it all wrong!" Potter tries to hug Draco, but Draco stumbles backward, and then scrambles for the door. He can't breathe, he can't think, he can't
"Oh my god," groans Harry again. "It was me after all. Oh, dear Merlin. How am I going to look Draco in the face now?"
Harry pads in, spatula in hand, and frowns. "About what, Ron?" His friend holds up a half opened letter with a shit-eating grin on his face. "Oi! Stop going through my mail!" He lunges for Ron.
She's probably only looking out for Harry, her best friend. She probably only still keeps track of you out for you out of some misplaced feeling of responsibility. You want to let her know that she doesn't need to. But then she'll stop, and you won't be able to pretend she was really your friend.
[Unsent]
Draco hums and wraps his hands around Potter's bicep. "Apparate us then, oh Saviour," he says. His hand moves up and down as he blatantly feels up Potter's arm. He's probably risking the both of them getting splinched by making Potter flustered, but Merlin and Morgana, Potter's
Then Harry looked up too. “See that one’s Andromeda. You just connect the two stars over there with the bright one in the middle.”
Harry says glumly. "Hiya, Mione."
Well anyways. When we finally got out of the customs place, we decided to go eat lunch. Malfoy wanted to go to a posh restaurant, the spoilt pureblood that he is. But then by the time, we reached the restaurant it was closed, so we had to go find a place to stay. Apparently, he’d expected me to have made the reservations beforehand, but I didn’t know what to do, so I’d decided to wing it once we got here. So we got a dingy inn in the wizarding part of Hyderabad like at 10 at night.
we were supposed to be a unit, and you went and you made that decision for the both of us, and how is that
Draco's breath stops, and before he knows what he's doing, he's pushed through the door, and right into the faces of two horrified Gryffindors. "What weren't for me?" he says, cutting right through something Hermione was saying. "What did you lie to me about?"
"Ron," groans Harry.
The narrator wants to take a pause here and point out how
Azkaban is not as cold as the Manor, your Manor, had been. In fact it is quite a relief, for the bars caging you and your family in also cage the rest of the world out. Here, in the damp, desolate prison cells, you can lay your head down without worrying about werewolves or snakes or Dark Lords. Here, your mother does not hesitate to put her fingers in your hair, and your father bothers not to scold you for dishonouring the Malfoy name. This place, which is meant to be your nightmare, becomes the closest thing to peace you know.
After a moment of silence she sighs. "You didn't deserve what Harry was doing." Her voice is softer than you've ever heard it be. "No one deserves that."
Harry patted down his robes and ran his fingers through his hair. He thought of not having any contact with the Weasleys for the entirety of the trip and felt a little sick. The only memories he had without the Weasleys or Ron and Hermione in them, were, quite simply put, shit. The only thing keeping him from running the other way was the thought that he would meet Malfoy. Harry wondered if Malfoy knew they were going to India together. Probably.
"I...Potter," Draco breathes and looks up. Why is Potter looking like he's going to be walked to the gallows? This is one of the
Draco choked on his next breath. “Excuse me what?!”
Potter winked at him. “What do you think Malfoy?”
You read all his letters. Then you do it again. He is beautifully sorry in all of them. He spins a tale of anger and misplaced revenge and finding his sexuality and being a teenager in a war. It's all deliciously tragic.
She takes a couple of gasping breaths and then leans over to look at the box closely. "He gave you those?" she asks in a wobbly voice.
," she gasps between short sharp gasps of giggles. "Potter's undying muggle love."
Hermione flails and her husband skids to a stop. They run the other way.

“Your beard!! Merlin!” Draco exclaims after chancing a look back at him.
magical.
Potter starts, panics, and then runs out of the shop, with a trailing thank you behind him. Draco giggles and rests his chin in his palm as he leans over the counter, watching Potter leave. That man's so cute. Such a catch. Plus he likes him. Draco! Potter likes Draco! Draco's going to have so much
Scorpius’ fingers slip out of his mouth, his eyes wide and wet, and he asks, “Candy?”
"Shut up, Ron," Hermione orders. "I'm not listening to my best friend and husband talk about fucking Draco Malfoy." Ron settles down reluctantly. "Anyway, I have decided on a new plan, boys," Hermione announces.
, Harry thinks.
Peering around the door frame, he can see Harry on the couch with his face buried in his palms. Granger's crouching in front of Draco's boyfriend with her hand on his shoulder.
“You really think so?” Harry asks, suddenly unsure. He
There’s a knock on the window, and I roll down the window.
Draco Lucius Malfoy.
. He just… missed them. Missed having people for himself.
"Er… yes," the man says.
.’ You see the hatred in his eyes, and you feel the aggression pouring out of his clenched fists.
"But flowers?" Ron tries.
"I didn't do it for you," she tells you. "I did it for Harry. He isn't a murderer. This isn't what he is."
Harry pouts.
Potter just nods weakly. His face is as red as the underside of a Chinese Fireball by now. Draco is quite pleased. Nothing like getting a cute, flustered
Harry blushed. “But I’m happy here. I don’t need to go abroad.”
When they leave the pizza place, the cold wind nips Draco's cheeks and its chill seeps past his coat, but inside he's warm and alive and
Potter looked at him seriously. “Do you want to be enemies Malfoy?”
"Why, hello there, Potter!" he exclaims. Potter’s cheeks go pink below his green,
Harry pulled Draco’s hand forward and put it beside his on top of the baby elephant. As Draco got calmer, Harry felt as if he should let Draco’s hand go, but he did not want to. It was so warm and nice. Draco had nice long fingers. Pianists fingers Luna would call them. He looked up at Draco, and Draco looked back at him with dark eyes. The platonic hand holding time limit had long since set sail, yet neither of them let go. In fact, if Harry had to guess, he would say that they were in fact leaning in. Just a little. Harry was sure it was not on purpose. Just a little more.
. And remember it’s Harry. Anyways, can I ask you a question? Why did you become travel companion? I mean it’s great, but you know I just don’t see young little Malfoy straight from Hogwarts consider this a respectable job you know? Not that I’m saying it’s not a respectable job. It’s a great job! It really is.”
"I went to Hogwarts with you for seven years, Harry," Draco laughs. "I think I would know who you've dated. And you know, you're not the only one in this relationship who can stalk people. In fact, I am a
It was one of those few Monday nights when she had no grading left to do, and she was occupying the left hand corner of the Big Room which tripled as their dinning room, lounge and kitchen. Harry agreed distractedly as he tucked the turmeric into the perfect spot. As he fished for the paprika, he stole a peek at her. With her elbows on the stacks of books littering the table, grey rimmed spectacles low on her nose and a can of biscuits balanced on the tartan couch that Harry bought for McGonagall, Hermione looked every bit of the stern professor she was.

“Oh my!” Draco exclaimed softly. The chick had clearly fallen out. Draco reached out his hands and scooped the baby up. “Where did you come from?” He cooed.
“Neither have you,” his husband grumbles. Harry ignores that, instead shooing Draco out of the kitchen and to the living room to set up the TV for their movie night.
Draco says nothing, puts his plate aside, and wraps his arms around Harry to pull him close. Harry wraps an arm back around Draco. On the screen, flowers bob in the lush green fields and birdsong plays faintly in the background. With his plate balanced on one knee, Harry continues to eat his food, now feeding Draco every other bite.
The Carrows will make sure the wizarding population dies out. You're sure of it. By the end of the year, you don't think a single child will be left alive under their watch. You can't say whether being forced to torture first years is worse than watching the atrocities happening at the Manor. At least there you got useful information to pass on. Here, you can only try and fail to save everyone around you.
