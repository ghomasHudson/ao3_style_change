Harry was pacing in the abandoned classroom he had asked Draco to meet him at. After ingesting the potion Ginny had given him and marvelling at the effects it brought, he had immediately asked Draco to meet him here to gloat.
He didn't know what to say to his friends, so he deflected the question away, with his favourite weapon, sarcasm.
Although he must admit Potter was not as stuck up as he once believed, he turned out to be decent company, being able to keep up with his banter.
/break\
“ Muggle methods? Like what?” He questioned.
The unlikely duo looked exactly like what a couple looked liked, dancing, laughing, holding hands. And let’s not forget the loving stares into each other's eyes. They were swaying away to another one of The Weird Sisters hits, with Harry constantly stepping on Draco's toes and Draco gracefully guiding him.

“I know how to hold my whiskey Potter, don't worry about me…”
Then there was the other half, led by the drarry ship co-captains, Hogwarts’ very own rainbow flag waver- Hermione and Pansy. I mean- Have you seen how those two act? yes they're bloody oblivious, but they’re so in love. And are we not going to take in account their engorgio’ed egos? They were sure that the both of them would take an avada kedavra before they back down to a challenge.
“Don't be stupid Ron, Malfoy definitely remembers… he’s Malfoy. But you make a point...I know that he doesn’t know that I don’t know”
/break\
Smirking to himself as Potter once again fell to his arse, he walked over to lend Potter a hand and to slide in a few more insults.
It was a beautiful kiss, in Harry’s opinion, with the moonlight shining softly on their skins, with the snitch escaping from Harry’s pocket where it had been roughly stuffed earlier, roaming around their heads, creating a halo like image around them.
Scoffing at the fairies wild imagination, he blushed furiously as he thought of what could have happened next if this was only his first location of the night, why did drunk him had to be an adventurous him?
But there was nothing stopping him from not stopping his interaction with Malfoy. For the first time in his life, there was no one to tell him what to do, or that his life was hanging on the line for that matter.
“Maybe he knows that I know that he knows that I know that he doesn’t know that I don't know”
No fucking way.
And he continued on his rapid succession of spells, knocking Potter over a few times, bruising the golden boy's ego made Draco a very happy boy. Draco 1, Potter 0.
Most of Hogwarts were quite definitely sold on the idea that they were together, I mean they’ve seen known couples act less in love than the display last night. Bets were being passed around on whether the two boys were going to be the star-crossed couple of Hogwarts.
Draco and Harry realize what had transpired during the night of Yule.
and character pairings you would like to see, besides drarry??
“Ready, Malfoy?”
“And pray-tell what happened in Charms?”
The first time Draco and Harry meet after Yule, and due to a sneaky half-goblins neddling, they end up partners for wandless casting practice.
“What, ‘the famous Harry Potter’.” Draco asked with every ounce of innocence he had.
Draco was staring at his wand now asking himself over and over, why did Potter take such good care of my wand? He would tell himself that it was just because Potter was the saviour of the wizarding world, that he couldn't have done something bad to it just because it was Draco's wand, it wasn’t in his nature. Potter was too nice to do anything else. But in the back of Draco’s mind he knew that there was more to it than just an inherent niceness, and as much as Draco didn't want to think about it he knew that it was weird that Potter just happened to have his wand in his pocket. There was no way that Potter just planned to give it to Draco and put it in his pocket for that reason. He didn’t even seem like he wanted to give it to him. And why didn't Potter say anything to him. He just gave it to Draco and walked off! What kind of person does that?
Harry whose eyes were now open, lifted Draco’s chin to gaze into Draco’s eyes, “Do you want to slow down?” he asked softly, “because if we are going too fast I’m happy to slow down.” he moved his hand to Draco’s cheek and Draco leaned into the touch, “we can talk about it, we should.”
“Still what? Harry you did nothing wrong, OK?”
Harry heard the train before he saw it. He recognised the familiar squeak of the wheels against the tracks and knew that he was finally returning home.
The two boys held hands and walked outside enjoying the cool October air brush against their cheeks. They talked about everything and nothing. They decided to have a one on one Quidditch match on Saturday of the following week. They also decided they would talk to Draco’s friends at breakfast, even though they probably already knew.
“Harry…” Draco trailed off smiling.
Harry rolled onto his back, pulling Draco on top of him, while at the same time moving his hands to rest on Draco's arse. Draco moaned at the sensation and deepened the kiss. Then Harry ground his hips up against Draco's, both boys moaned at that. “Stop, stop, stop, stop! Harry I have to go.” Draco said as he rushed to get off Harry, pulled his pants on and run to the bathroom. Harry quickly realised what was happening and grabbed his pants, quickly pulled them on too and ran after Draco.
“Just don't do anything bad to it. I have a reputation to uphold you know.” Harry started walking to the chair.
The two boys continued to study for a little while longer until Draco couldn't concentrate any more and Harry hadn't even started studying in the first place, so they moved to sit on Draco’s bed and started talking.
“Ah, um, well, I don't know.” Harry really didn't want to answer.
Draco got up and took off the T-shirt Harry let him borrow, looking at Harry the whole time daring him to say that he would rather stay. Harry however just did the same and took off his T-shirt while looking at Draco the whole time. Draco stuck his tongue out at Harry, Harry only laughed at that.
Also please leave me a comment so I can improve my writing.
“Did the famous Harry Potter just say that I was right.” Draco cut him off, but Harry grabbed a pillow and hit Draco with it.
“I'm not that brave Harry.” Draco said genuinely feeling as though he was a coward. “I'm definitely not as brave as you.” Draco added.
Draco was bewildered to say the least, “knew what, Potter?” Draco asked.
“That's all in the past now so don't worry about it OK, we're friends now.” Draco wanted this trip down memory lane to be over.
“No, no you look fine, you ponce, it’s just that if you asked me two weeks ago if I thought I’d have a nap with you, I would have said it was impossible, ludicrous to even ask.” Harry stated into another fit of laughter, Draco quickly following.
“Well I should have just said something earlier. Instead I said nothing and made you think I was weird or that I'd done something to your wand.”
“Apologise?!” Potter looked astounded, “Draco Malfoy, wants to apologise, to me?” Potter said, disbelief colouring his words.
Draco had no idea why he was doing this. Really he just wanted to see if he would turn out to be a ferret. Since his fourth year at Hogwarts he’d wanted to know if his animagus would be a ferret, like what that horrible Mad Eye turned him into. It was a truly horrific day, first Potter barely paid him any attention, then when he finally had his chance the weasley ruined it AND on top of that Potter had the audacity to insult his mother. It didn’t even end there, no no, Moody came out of nowhere and transfigured him into a ferret, then tortured him until McGonagall had to save him. It was a horrid day, not to mention his talk with Snape.
“Well, yeah?” Harry didn't know what to say and his mind was still clouded from how hard his cock was. He really wanted to get back to what he was doing. “Why does it even matter anyways?” Harry added, “I mean you got your wand back, shouldn't that be a good thing?”
“Oh c’mon, I'm sorry, I love you OK? Thank you for this amazing picnic, Draco.”
Draco didn't know the answer, so he turned to poetry. There were a few muggle poets that understood love and Draco liked to read them. He'd memorized a few by a particular muggle called Atticus. He liked to write about love and loss and magic. Draco was fond of one that went; I'm glad I found you//Because//Before you//I never knew what to wish for. Draco felt like that when he saw Harry. Draco had found what he'd never known he'd been wishing for. But could he tell Harry that? No. So what did he say to Harry?
Draco woke up a few hours later, disoriented. He felt something move beneath him, then he remembered, “Harry?” he looked down and evidently he was no longer a ferret.
The two boys stayed in bed for another minute before Harry tapped Draco's arm and they both got up. Harry flicked his wand to make the bed and, as both boys were still nude from their shenanigans earlier that morning, they just put on their uniforms and robes (kissing a lot whilst they did so).
“I said you’d tell us at dinner.” Hermione stated.
Draco could think of only one response to that, “I’m surprised I’m not already dead from how much I’ve wanted to fix your hair. I mean do you even brush it?” Draco reached up to pull at one of the many strands that were out of place.
“Ooh, does Harry have a crush?” Draco inwardly cursed whoever it was.
“I was looking for you, I still don’t quite trust you. I had to make sure you weren’t up to something.” Potter said as he walked towards Draco warily.
“Potter, what are you doing?” Draco swept his legs over the side of the couch and sat facing Potter.
“You'll probably just keep walking with me anyway so we may as well just walk together.”
“I am, I wouldn’t lie about something like that.” Draco assured Potter.
“Um, sure?” Draco said slightly confused but too distracted to care.
“No, I'm good here.”
“Right well, if you won't let me thank you for that then let me thank you for not telling Bellatrix that it was me in the manor that day.” Harry was looking at his hands, it seemed as though he was remembering that day.
“Yeah, I mean you're pretty hot too, is that what you wanted to hear?” Draco gestured around at the food, “I put this whole picnic together isn't that enough.”
“So we're getting up then?” Harry asked.
Draco was the first over the edge, crying out as he did and tensing as he finally released his load onto the bed sheets. Harry went over the edge seconds after as the walls of Draco's arse went suddenly tight, and Harry finished inside of Draco.
Harry slowly pushed his finger in more and more until it was all the way in. Draco moaned and said, “Move now.” Harry complied and started pulling his finger back out, pushing it back in once he reached the tip. The sensation of Harry's finger burned but it felt so good and Draco needed more so he said as much to Harry, “Another finger, I need another.” Draco struggled to talk. Harry added a second finger at Draco's request. Starting slowly again then building up speed. He started scissoring his fingers inside of Draco, making him moan and plead for more. Harry added a third finger and started to pump them in and out getting faster and harder each thrust.
“You got me food, in my book that is deserving of unconditional love.” Harry kissed Draco again.
Harry looked around at the other tables noticing that quite the number of students were in fact staring at the two boys. “Oh, I didn’t even notice.” Harry shrugged and kissed Draco again, more passionately this time, he wanted to give them something worth looking at. Draco tasted like orange juice and bacon, an odd combination but one Harry found he couldn’t get enough of. Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth as he deepened the kiss. Hermione, it seemed, had had enough and hit Draco with the paper, saying, “Here take this I can’t even have breakfast without you two fighting or now snogging the hell out of each other!” her voice rose towards the end.
“Hey, there's no need for name calling, Mr. Potter.” Draco said, playing along.
“I'm not the only one who went through something traumatic. Look at you, you killed the dark lord and you're fine.” Draco said into Harry's shoulder.
Harry really wanted to start sucking Draco’s cock but he had to ask, “Is this OK?”
“Well, if that's what you want,” Harry was sliding out of his chair.
The process of becoming an animagus is long, but Draco was determined, also it would help to get Potter off his back. And to think all he needed to do to get Potter’s attention was act like he didn’t want it, well too late now. But after all those days and weeks of preparation, he was finally ready to change for the first time. Draco hardly ever got nervous, no he just got butterflies in his stomach. They just seemed to be swarming at this moment, making his hands shake, his palms sweat, his vision was even starting to blur, but he would remain undeterred. Nothing and no one would stop this now. He’d finally get to find out if he truly was a ferret.
“OK.” Draco shut the door and continued to get dressed.
“Well I could always teach you some.”
“OK, if that's what you want.” Draco said, trying to sound indifferent.
“Look I'll tell you later, there's too many people here and I don't want people talking about this.” Harry really didn't want to say.
Harry nodded and said the lubrication charm again and stroked along his cock a few times to cover it fully before aligning himself at Draco's entrance. “OK, you ready love? I'll go slow, yeah.” Harry said as he started to push in. Draco moaned at the burning sensation as Harry’s tip penetrated him. “You OK?” Harry asked.
“Yes, Potter I want to apologise. Not just for invading your privacy, but for everything.” Draco started.
“Oh don't worry, I know I am.”
Draco could only assume his face look just as shocked as Harry's did and both boys rushed to get up and get as far away from the other as possible.
“I don't want to go to class either but I also don't want to go to detention.” Harry kissed Draco's shoulder.
“OK” Draco had started crying.
“Ha, ha. I'll have you know that I have tried to comb my hair and well it didn't work.” Harry said.
Harry laughed even harder, “no! No more laughing! Just take a deep breath.” Draco tried. “Stop it!” Draco’s sides hurt and his cheeks were aching, he just wanted to stop laughing, he didn’t even think. He really didn’t mean to, he was just suddenly kissing Harry Potter. “I- sorry, I just had to stop laughing,” Draco broke the kiss.
When Draco finished writing the letter to his mother, Harry and Draco brought it up to the owlery together. They gave the letter to Draco's owl, then went for a walk around the castle grounds.
Harry removed the locking charms from the door and walked back to his dorm room with his arm around Draco's waist. When they got inside Harry closed the door and both boys went to sit on the still unmade bed. Draco cuddled into Harry's side. At first Harry thought that Draco just wanted to cuddle together but then Harry noticed that Draco had started to cry. “Hey, hey it’s OK. Why are you crying?” Harry asked.
“Why? You're not going to comb my hair are you?” Harry said dubiously.
Draco let out a yelp as he hit the floor. Potter must have rolled over and made Draco fall off. That knob, to think Draco wanted to be friends with him. “Oh baby, I’m so sorry! Are you ok?” Potter had jumped out of bed and crouched next to Draco, he picked him up and was rocking Draco back and forth in his arms. “I’m so sorry, baby,” Potter kept murmuring to Draco. Once Potter had put Draco back on the bed, he also got back in and propped his pillows up so that he could sit against the wall. Potter pulled Draco into his lap and continued to apologise to him, patting him and making sure he wasn’t hurt. Draco was more shocked than hurt, he really just loved that Potter was so worried about him. Draco was sure now that he wanted to be an ally to Potter, a friend. He would tell him later though. Potter would probably not appreciate the fact that Draco had slept with him the last two nights.
Draco did want to sleep, he was absolutely exhausted, though he wasn’t sure if Harry would be ok with it. “Well,” Draco cleared his throat, “yes but will you stay?” Draco looked into Harry’s eyes.
“Uhm, maybe.” Harry really didn't want to say, he was really regretting telling Draco the truth.
Harry helped Draco back into his bed, then got in beside him. Harry cared about Draco and he didn't care that he could get sick too he just wanted to make sure that Draco was OK. Harry pulled the blankets up around both of them and brought Draco closer to him. He started to stroke Draco's hair and kiss his forehead. After that it didn't take long for Draco to fall asleep. Harry on the other hand stayed awake for a while longer to watch over Draco and make sure that he would be OK. Though after about an hour Harry couldn’t stay awake any longer and drifted into a fitful sleep.
“I know what you mean.” Draco said remembering all the times he would have made fun of Harry for crying and how now he was hugging him and confessing his feelings for him. “Hey, can I kiss you?” Draco asked not wanting to startle Harry by just going in without warning.
“Hmm was I in it?” Draco asked, grinding his hips up to meet Harry's.
“OK.” Harry said but he knew that Draco was happy to walk with him.
“No.” Potter said.
Draco stood up, made a show of taking his wand out and placing it on the desk, then cast a wand less wingardium leviosa on one of the many pillows occupying Draco’s bed. He looked over to see Harry looking back and forth between Draco and the floating pillow, clearly impressed. “That's not the only spell I can do,” Draco said, lowering the pillow, “but it's kind of difficult to do more than one in a row.”
“Don't even finish that sentence.” Harry said also trying to keep a straight face.
“Draco.” Pansy said in a mock formal way.
“OK, great. Well, did you want to walk back to our dorms together, I mean if you don't have another class before lunch?” Harry asked, a little hesitantly.
He couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t get comfortable, he thought of Harry, how warm he is, how when Draco curled up as a ferret next to him he could always sleep. He may not have Harry but he did have himself, he could curl up as a ferret. Perhaps that would help him sleep, the past two nights were better than any this year, maybe it would help.
“Wait! Please.” Potter turned to face Draco. “I’m sorry, I should have told you, I was going to, I just wanted you to trust me first. I didn’t even mean to, I was going to sneak out once you were asleep and never go back, I was going to leave I promise, it was an accident. You were just so warm and it was the first time I’d changed, I was exhausted. I wasn’t going to come back either, but I haven’t slept properly in so long, but when I was with you, I finally felt safe enough to sleep.” Draco didn’t realise he was crying until he looked up and saw Potter through a blur of tears. “I’m sorry.” Draco sobbed. He hated crying in front of people but he didn’t care that Potter could see him crying. In fact he was glad Potter was there, like just his presence was comforting.
Harry and Draco were in Draco’s dorm room, Draco was studying and Harry was smiling at Draco again. It was making Draco want to say something mean or hurtful to him just to stop him from smiling, they were studying for Merlin's sake. “What could you possibly be smiling about?” Draco asked when he couldn’t put up with Harry’s incessant smiling anymore.
“You gotta admit that it's a little funny.”
“OK, OK I relent, saviour of the wizarding wor--”
“Really? Well come here and sit in this chair.” Draco got out of the chair he was in and motioned Harry over to it.
“Yes, I want this. I want this so much.” Harry practically moaned.
He was one of the last to breakfast, sitting down next to Blase and across from Pansy. He quickly ate some toast, slathered in butter and honey, and washed it down with tea, sweetened with two sugars and a spoonful of honey, with milk lightening the colour. Pansy gave him a look that said you’re late, but we’ll talk about it later. Blase barely looked at him, too absorbed in his conversation with Nott to pay any attention to his surroundings.
“You’re happy? Why?” Draco looked at Harry a little dubiously.
Draco started on Harry’s hair. He pulled out all the stops to get Harry's hair to cooperate, and eventually Harry's hair looked somewhat decent. Though Draco was exhausted from all the spells, brushing and physical exertion that it took to get this far, he was proud of his accomplishment.
“Right, and how often did you think about how much you hated me?”
“No kissing! Wow what ever will I do?” Harry tried (and failed) to make his voice light and airy.
Harry looked over at Draco, he was sitting facing Harry but he didn't look over at him. This made Harry more than disappointed it twisted in his gut, made him feel wrong. In all his time at Hogwarts Harry and Draco would always glare at each other at their own sides of the room. It was just a habit now but when Draco didn't return Harry’s stare it made Harry slightly self conscious (he felt self conscious a lot now, everyone always looking at him either with admiration or hatred or mostly just indifference he could never shake the feeling that he was never good enough). Harry shuffled in his seat as he realised how stupid he was being. Of course Draco wouldn't look at him, not now, not when the war was over but people still greaved the losses of their friends, families and were angry at the world. So Harry looked back to Ron who was telling everyone about how his sister would be the new Quidditch captain. Ron sounded annoyed but Harry knew that he was proud.
Once he was satisfied with his apologies he sat down and started eating, not realising how hungry he'd become. Though since he was around gryfindors he felt that he didn't need to be polite and well mannered while eating so he dug in.
“Mmhm, ok well if you’ll just let me nap now, I’m quite tired.” Draco said, lying back down.
“Oh yeah? Well that makes me feel a bit better at least.” Harry looked partly relieved and partly impressed, “Can you show me some of the spells you were working on?”
Maybe it was something that the war had implanted in him, missing knowledge was not good. The last few times he had been kept in the dark, it had been all life-altering information, that he had been a wizard, that he was a horcrux, that apparently liking girls
“ The reason there are no wizarding books on magical height growth is because it.. Well it never goes well. It's widely discouraged worldwide to use magic to fundamentally change your appearance, which is why you would not find any books on such things here.”
A hint of a smirk could be seen on Draco’s face when Harry raised his wand, giving it a swift flick, creating a glowing banner on top of their heads, with the words ‘Surprise Motherfuckers, we’re dating now!!’, effectively erupting the room into chaos.
“Harry, you were the only ones here since Hooch and Hagrid cleaned the pitch on friday, ever considered that this pile of vomit could be your pile of vomit?”
Pushing Draco’s hand away from his hair, he resolved to find a way to grow taller than Draco, or at least lessen their height difference, they had magic for a reason right? There has to be some type of spell of rapid height growth.
“Relax blondie, we know how to sneak around, stealth style.”
“ Exercising, meal plans, workout out. You know the whole muggle health idea?” Hermione replied and at Harry’s puzzled look, continued on, “ Go ask Seamus about it, heard his dad’s a big fanatic about these things.”
“What to do, what to do. Ah, yes, that’ll show him.” Draco thought.
“Oh Harry, you can be so oblivious sometimes! Hush go on to Malfoy, I’ll keep an eye out if i need to hex you.” Hermione admonished, lightly pushing Harry towards his partner for the lesson.
the struggle is real when you have no idea where the story should go, any suggestions:))))
And apparently, they were acting very close, giggling and leaning on each other's shoulders, so close that these fairies misunderstood that they were a couple.
Now alone at the table, a very confused Draco was trying to sort through his thoughts. Love-struck idiots? No, they were hardly friends, barely acquaintances. This night, although not utterly terrible as he might have once predicted, was just part of their little charades going on to see who would break first.
Everyone was staring at them and they were staring at each other.
The day after the Yule ball was a Saturday, which means Harry had all the time in the world to nurse his hangover and get over what happened yesterday. The hangover was substantial, it would be gone in a few hours( bless the beauty that is magic), however that much bigger problem in front of him now is what was he going to do about Malfoy.
Hermione walked over to where Harry and Ron were standing, tuning in to their conversation to find out how the lessons had gone for the boys. “I cant believe Malfoy managed to knock you on your arse! No less than three times at that!” Ron exclaimed, as he watched Harry swat off the dust on his robes, “at least he wasn't too big of a twat about it!”
Pausing, Draco was at a loss on how to reply, resigning to the truth, he answered, “The war.” and walked away to gather his belongings and leave with the slytherins. He did not need anyone’s pity.
“Is there a point to this conversation or are you just going to continue upsetting me?”
His friends could not follow him, could not see the astronomy tower, casting a few quick
“Trying to get us to leave and not witness the glorious moment where you realize what happened between you and Potter? You know us better than that.” Pansy quipped back at him.
Together they headed of to their first class in the morning, which was transfiguration, and despite Harry’s head protesting that he should continue on his pursuit of his memories of Friday, he knew better than to invoke Mcgonagall’s anger by missing a class, so the trip to the quidditch pitch had to wait.
Shaking his head, he concentrated to cast a wandless protego as Malfoy cast a bombarda at him.
“ We found some unicorns in the forest and proceeded to have a race to see who could stack the most nifflers on them. “ and before any of his friends could protest, he quickly entered the bathroom.
“Are you thirsty, Malfoy?” Harry suddenly interrupted the awkward silence that loomed over them.
Waving his wand to bring himself out of the memory, the only thought running through his mind was that he had to get to the astronomy tower now and erase what was left of that night.
Hermione stood up and made a motion for him to follow. Grinning, Harry quickly packed up their things and hurried after her, knowing that he had won. Using his abuse against his friends always proved to be effective.
At least she had the decency to look slightly sheepish at this Harry huffed. He was getting bullied today, first by his boyfriend and his endless teasing, now by his best friend and her withholding of knowledge.
Turning his eyes away from the monstrosity in front of him, he was met with another catastrophe, a bucket full of vile vomit next to the window, waving his wand to clear the room of the bucket and the smell, Harry realized that Ron indeed was right, but hwy ahd they come from the quidditch pitch to the tower just to vomit again?
at them, adding in a
“Lucius Malfoy is certainly a piece of work ...did i tell you about the story about your house elf-well ex house elf once-”
He had a feeling that Hermione’s participation in his plan to increase in height was more out of motivation for him to grow out of the abuse from the Dursleys rather than to spite Draco, as was the reason she now claimed. But as long as the end result was that he could gloat about his new height in front of Draco, he didn't mind much and Hermione on his side was always helpful.
“Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, Pansy Parkinson and Hermione Granger, Blaise Zabini and Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.” Flitwick concluded from his list and proceeded to start rounding up students in their respective pairs.
“Pansy! You can't say that! He’s a professor!” Receiving an exasperated look from Pansy's statement, Hermione reluctantly admitted, “ He does pair them up a lot...But it's weird to think of it that way!”
He quickly filled two glasses of the mixture and started his way back to their table. What was Hermione and Parkinson thinking, ruining their perfectly non-awkward talking.
“I’m calling you Hermione, isn’t that enough!”
Casting an unsure glance to his friends, the interest in their eyes was so not encouraging, but he had come this far, and could not stand the thought of another meeting with Potter with him knowing more than he did. With that in mind, Draco tipped back the glass and downed the potion all at once.
“What are you so happy about you got Zabini too! And you Hermione! What got you all grinning about being paired with Parkinson!”
Sliding closer to Hermione amidst the questions benign directed at the boys, Pansy raised a suggestive eyebrow at her girlfriend, “Since they now are dating, oddly without our help, and we are dating, would you be interested in setting up the remaining member of the Golden Trio with Blaise?”
/break\
“Hermione! But I don’t want to be hexed!”
In fact, the Gryffindor seemed to have told a joke to Draco, judging by his outrageous
Draco gawked in horror as he watched the scene unfold in front of him, the Draco before him had lost all decorum and grace, in front of Harry Potter, no less! No wonder Potter was so cocky in their last few meetings, if this was how he acted the entire night.
And that concludes my first fic! This has taken way longer than I expected but I hope you enjoy reading this as much I enjoyed reading it! Leave a kudos or a comment, if you like (i greatly appreciate it). Check out my tumblr drarryismysoul too!
Flipping through his potions book that he acquired over the weekend during his first class of the morning, History of Magic with the Hufflepuffs, Draco finally found the potion he had needed, recuperare memoriae, to retrieve one's memory. Yes this would be dead useful for his predicament now, the ingredients were pretty basic, jobberknoll feathers, stewed mandrake, powdered sage. Granted the steps were a bit complicated, but he was no novice brewer. All he had to do was avoid any possible interaction or questioning for the next forty eight hours. He could do this.
Opening the bag, Draco double-checked the ingredients brought to him with care, putting them out on his desk in the order he will need them and proceeded to start the brewing process. Putting the mandrake aside to stew a bit longer to give a better effect, he began to smash the jobberknoll feathers and powdered sage together, turning towards his friends who had begun to settle down around the room, “No one saw you come in right?”
Harry, in fact, was dressed in a pair of Slytherin green dress robes that Blaise swore he saw Draco place an owl order for two weeks back. To say Harry had cleaned up nice would have been an understatement, with dress robes of that standard and his seeker shaped body typed, he would have every boy and girl in this room pining for him before this night ends.
What had happened last night?
“ Correct me if I’m wrong, but I have a feeling that I’m not the only one who had a wicked hangover and forgot nearly everything that happened in Yule for like the past few days?”
It was nice having something to call himself, bisexual, he had no problem identifying with that label. But the problem was the realization that he was indeed what people called a bisexual disaster. But he couldn't help it that boys and girls were so pretty, especially the ones playing quidditch, Cedric, Cho, Ginny, Malfoy.
Casting the spell to understand the conversation between the fairies, his cheeks immediately turned a bright red upon hearing the topic of their conversation.
Malfoy was the biggest problem of them all. Pretty blonde git. The thing was that Malfoy was his enemy, and before, Harry would have never seen him as more, and if not because of his trip down the rabbit hole on the internet, discovering the idea of an enemy-to-lovers trope, he never would. But alas, he did and now was stuck in this little crisis, so afraid that something could have happened during that lost night and the little fantasy he had been entertaining for so long would be … lost.
Potter and him were both very giggly drunks evidently, and encouraged by each other's drunkenness, they became the worst pair humanly possible. They stumbled across the entire castle grounds, reaching the edge of the forest, debating the last quidditch match they had, he was insisting that Potter had cheated, that he was the better seeker. Draco sighed in relief hearing that, drunk him still had enough common sense to not admit that, secretly he thought Potter was a better player than himself.
Shedding his robe and folding his sleeves up, Draco prepared himself for a long night of brewing and annoying from his friends.
“If you're commenting on my smell after a quidditch game again, I suggest you take a sniff at yourself Ron.”
“You, Potter, want me to bring these up to Draco?”questioned the stunned Slytherin.

But the sight of the familiar platinum blonde hair, stopped the incantation form coming out of his mouth, “ Malfoy? What are you doing here?” the words stumbled out of his mouth before he could process them, he never could control himself around the Slytherin.
When the fantasy breaks, and it will, it was bound to be a long way down. The new of them going to Yule together, somehow miraculously, stayed between the safety of Hogwarts. But if they continued with this charade…
Draco, seeming to have noticed all the attention his erm--acquaintance has received, started to glare at all the people staring at Harry.
Even more the two girls had started a betting system on when their friends would stop “being so fucking oblivious”. Actually almost half of the Gryffindors and Slytherins had placed a bet down and were actively waiting for the results.
Apparently getting lost in his thoughts while playing quidditch was not his best idea again, he was caught off guard as Ron threw the quaffle at the post behind him, hoping to score, but instead of scoring, the quaffle strayed towards him and landed smack on his face, knocking him off his broom.
To his memory, the room looked largely untouched from when they last visited it, which was a good thing, it meant that no one had seen the bright orange words spelled onto the wall.
“Exactly. He is, Potter.” Draco replied off-handedly, completely misunderstanding what Greg had actually meant and disregarding the second part of his remark, his mind fixated on regaining the upper hand on Harry.
Hearing the name Harry, Draco’s attention immediately snapped towards his friend,“He specifically said Harry?” Draco frowned at how foreign that name sounded on his lips. Harry, Harry, Harry, he repeated in his mind.
“Now I’m only more motivated to find out what happened on Friday, Malfoy seems to know something, the git. And I cannot stand him knowing more than me.” Harry proclaimed as he ushered his friends out of the classroom, waving a merry goodbye to Flitwick.
over and over again around the room, he was almost done with his side of the room, as he turned to face the orange horror in the center of the room, Malfoy turned to face it as well.
Slightly reeling from the spectacular kiss he was given, Harry watched doe-eyed as Draco pulled a potion out from his pockets?
Draco and Harry deal with the Astronomy Tower, together
“ You do know there are muggle methods to grow taller right? ”
Nearing the drinks table, he spotted the bowl Seamus had told him about. Before he had left the lion’s den to meet Malfoy, Seamus had happily announced to the upper years that next to the “boring pumpkin juice” was a firewhiskey laced punch bowl.
One could pretend the ball never happened if they wished. Draco, in particular, almost wished for the ball to have never happened, or for Mondays to never exist. He had spent the past two days cooped up in the Slytherin dorms, using the excuse of tutoring the younger years as to avoid any human contact.
“The ones which you called “my precious babies, my little tartlets, no one is going to eat you but me”, the ones which you screamed at Blaise for trying to smell them.”
He was right, as always, as he watched Potter and himself dive down in pursuit of what they thought was the snitch, they were wrong, as he could see now, the snitch was nowhere near them.
Closing his eyes for a moment, Draco was brought to the astronomy tower, already dreading what new horrors the new location would bring, he walked closer to where the two boys were, where he witnessed easily the most disastrous scene of the night. He had to remedy this, right now.
“Guys this is getting too confusing for anyone to follow and I’m not going to be late for charms. Harry, just get ready for the impromptu of your life, if it comes to it, I’ll send a stray hex to you and you won’t have to talk to Malfoy okay?”
Sitting next to the broom shed to catch a breather from their search, the boys of the group started a mini chaser’s game, with Ron’s inability to play a seeker’s match. Throwing the quaffle from one end of the pitch to the other, laughing as the wind zooms pass their faces, all the while Hermione observed them languidly while reading her book. Harry wondered briefly if this was what they missed in the past seven years in Hogwarts, that if without the constant threat of Voldemort looming over their heads, they would be able to be this carefree.
it did say. Draco had a feeling that Harry did not remember the entirety of the night, Draco had been the same rambling mess when confessing to Harry of his little obsession over him. Harry, sober, likes him, smiling at that thought, Draco took a step closer to Harry.
“But what if he knows that you don't know that he knows that you don't know?”
Harry found himself enjoying the routine too, it made him feel like there was something to look forward to each day, the rinse and repeat of it all. It helped him cope with the sudden emptiness the end of the war brought to him. Don't get him wrong, Voldemort dying was great, but with the last year being filled with a marathon of one death threat after another, when everything stopped he felt restless. He always felt like he should be on the move, helping someone or doing something. Mindlessly sitting and studying for NEWTs were not good for his nerves.
Harry grumbled under his breath, although taking the extended hand of his boyfriend and allowing him to escort him to their little picnic date. Draco would never admit it but he loved doing the sappy things in a relationship. Harry would never admit that he loved doing the sappy things with him either. It was secretly great to have someone put in that much effort to spend time with him, something they both lacked growing up, he mused.
Harry fought the blush coming up on his cheeks, he hated it when Draco teased him about his height. But it was inevitable, with it being one of Draco’s favourite taunts ever since they were eleven year-olds. It only got worse after they started dating. Every single one of the pet names he had gotten from Draco had involved some type of short joke. My little saviour. My pint-sized love. Draco was a half a head taller than him and he loved reminding him of it everyday.
Casting a tempus charm to check the time, ten past twelve, not too bad. Harry let out a long sigh as he released the struggling snitch in his hand letting it roam around the confines of his four poster bed.
“Because I am feeling very thirsty right now, like VERY thirsty, in fact I see the butterbeer table right there, do you want one? You probably do, I’ll go get some for us, toodles!” And with that elegant greeting, our savior practically ran to the drinks table, before his counterpart could get a word in.
“Let the record show that there is never an uninteresting year when you are friends with Harry Potter.”
“No… How?”
Entering the room, Hermione raised an eyebrow at the odd collection of people gathered there, Pansy’s gaggle of Slytherins, without Draco, most of their Gryffindor friends and Luna. Walking towards Pansy, she directed her concerns towards her girlfriend, hoping to get an answer in return.
A week later, Harry was met with the force of Hermione and planning. She had woken him up at six in the morning, proclaiming the start of his height increasement programme, as she called it. Let it be noted down that Hermione never half-assed anything, as can be proven by the thick binder placed in front of him, detailing every single aspect of his programme, from meal plans to exercise routines, all planned to perfection.
He lied, he wasn’t thirsty at all. No Harry just needed a quick out to that increasingly awkward situation between himself and Malfoy. But toodles?, Merlin, he had to bury himself in a hole.
Putting his contempt of being a great seeker aside, more questions flooded his mind, why was there a snitch? Ron mentioned that Malfoy and him were the only ones who accessed the pit since then, did they have a seeker’s match and failed to catch the snitch?
Rolling her eyes at him, Ginny thrust a bottle of greenish-silver liquid towards him, a suspicious potion, his mind supplied, “ Cut the sass, Harry. You’ve been trying to out grow Malfoy in height right? I’ve kept an eye out for your progress, you’ve had a nice growth spurt going on for you but you haven’t grown at all in the last week, contrary to your record the last few months”
/break\
And the lesson continued like that Potter firing spells at him, not succeeding, to his contempt and Potter’s frustration. Sensing the lesson coming to an end, Draco focused all his power to the shield, absorbing Potter’s last few spells and pushing it back towards him.
Stupid Potter, agreeing with his drunken logic.
But apparently he didn't have time to make a choice, because Draco had arrived, making his presence known as always, opening the door wide and sauntering in. And without a solid line to go on, Harry decided he would just stand and let Draco stare.
Sitting down at the Slytherin table, Draco prepared himself for another round of intense questioning from his friends and even more intense dodging from his part. But the questioning never came, all he got was a statement from pansy which held no room for reply, “We’ve come to the conclusion over the weekend that either you legitimately do not remember what happened on Yule night, or that you have some deep dark secret from that night that cannot be revealed. But we will find out what it is Draconis Malfoy, be prepared for some extreme meddling and prodding on our part.”
The students looked towards Percy Weasely for him to do something as she was now annoying them to no end, he took it upon himself to cast a silencing charm on her given everyone some piece and quite for the time being.
Molly was red with angry, Arthur was beyond annoyed of having been pulled out of yet again due to his children, thank Merlin it wasn't the twins again.
Otiz sat on the pair pinning them to the floor to say I have them trained in no time.
"Ok Hadrian I'll come with you, Albus must have something important to talk to you about if he sent you a letter during class" said Severus getting up and walking towards the door.
He broke, he was crying like the world had finally ended, even though he now had his father, yes that was a hundred percent true but still, it was still so hard that his own biological relatives would do something like that in front of so many people.
Meanwhile at Hogwarts..................................
"Ouch what was that for you stupid bird!" screamed Ginny making mostly everyone cover their ears as she had screeched.
In the Ministry, Severus had managed to get his son out from under his robes, his eyes bright red from crying.
"Look after both of them Draco".
You will stay in isolation until the end of year, you will lose points but it will not affect your house, at any point you are not part of any house from this moment in time".
Everyone in the room either had tears in their eyes, was crying, seeing red with angry or wanted to spill their guts or a mixture of everything.
The morning came quite quickly if you asked one Severus Tobias Snape as he got out of bed he was met by a whimper and so looked down next to him and saw his son sleeping peacefully.
"Fine I can't do that one I'll try another work sheet and.... where's my wand? I need to look for it otherwise Professor Dumbledore will have my neck for it, he made sure that I got this wand when he picked me up from home and took me to Ollivanders!
She headed up to the Headmasters off not caring in the slightest that she was missing out on one of her lessons, she at this moment in time didn't care.
It was nearing dinner when there was a knock on the portrait door, Otiz growled at whoever it was only to earn a tap on his head in warning.
"Lupin this is Otiz Hardian Severus he is Hardian's familiar, you know Hadrian as Harry Potter but last year before going back to school I rescued him from his relatives but I'll explain that more at a later date".
"Mister Snape what is the matter?" Filius asked him.
Severus was led into the room where he noticed that his son was in a light doze and went to sit down at the end of the bed, once sat Harry opened his eyes and smiled slightly.
God siblings: Draconis Lucius Malfoy
I stood in the doorway until I saw that Harry's breathing had died down, once sure Harry was asleep I cast a healing spell, hopefully that would make things better and crack Harry's door, so I could hear in case of emergencies. I was just about to fire call Albus when I heard a muffled cry followed by a scream, god I've never ran so fast in my life. All this worry making him feel nauseous.
With that the Howler spat at them and ripped itself up in front of Ron, everyone looking at the two youngest Weasely's, Ron turing his sights right onto Harry, making the poor boy flinch, Otiz's hackles were standing straight up and vapor coming out of his mouth as it say 'you hurt him and I'll rip your throat out in half a second'.
Harry enjoyed when they explored Ohe'o Gultch and the winding Hana Highway, he loved every minute of it, while Harry went swimming Severus went off and gathered more ingredients from the surrounding area, only to come swimming as well.
The teachers didn't care that I was behind in my school work to be honest I think they are scared of my cousin and his parents to care for my welfare but they did try to give me some extra food at lunch when my cousin wasn't looking as well as his gang.
By the end of it all Lucius was the only one standing with Harry on his back laughing so hard.
"I wish..."
"Dray we should head back then, I don't think your parents including my dad will be too happy if we are late" said Harry to him and waved goodbye to the rest of them and headed back to the castle.
.............
Otiz bound up to him and attacked him with barks and licks to his face, quickly changing into his six year old form.
You would think Ron would back down but he didn't, he stood up and started screaming at Harry with all his might about the injust that had occured and how he got to his parents and about all the lies he had told them!! Anything and everything he could think of Ron said it making Harry flinch and retreat into himself, this made Otiz jump up from beside Blaise and almost attack Ron for what he had done until the Great Hall doors opened to reveal one Molly Weasley.
"We..."
Petunia looked towards her nephew and then saw who he was hiding behind she lost it!
"Hadrian come on you have to eat something" said Draco for the fifth time since they had sat down but he was just pushing his food around the late that Draco had filled for him with his favourite breakfast foods including pumpkin juice that he had only a sip of.
"Hadwin puppy!" shouted Otiz making everyone in the hall look at the small boy in a long white stop with dark blue around the cuffs and black shorts and black shoes.
"Y..ye...yes sir..... about... them?" stammered Harry to him, Severus gripping his hand in support and Otiz was now on his lap mewing into his ear comforting him.
My name as Mister Malfoy has said is Tomas Marvolo Sötétség, I have come from Hungry after being asked by your Minister after he saw my credentials, I hope that we all can get along with each other.
Harry perked up at this, it had taken a while for him to understand that it was ok to get presents or even to ask for something he needed but after Severus as even the Malfoy's explained to him that it was ok he was slowing getting on board with the idea.
She nodded and started to cry quietly... "yes Professor it's true these are mine, I was selling answers to the other students" but she mentioned nothing about the self writing quills.
"Severus what does he mean by Lord Prince? I thought they all died out?" said Pamona to the black haired man who in turned sighed.
When the older year stepped closer to the bed she spotted parchments on with test questions on for all subjects, all right mind you as well as another parchment indercating prices on what she was selling them at. As she looked again at everything she noticed a self writing quill sitting there, just waiting to be given an order to write.
"Professor can't you get that thing out of the castle, I thought that we were only allowed to bring a cat, owl, rat or a toad with us how come Potter has something else?" asked Hermione.
Harry had been in his room for the passed three hours his tears now had completely dried up, he was still clutching his stuffed animals but as his magic had calmed down some what, he noticed something moving... it was them.
"HADRIAN!!"
Date of adoption: 6th August 1992
"Really Sev I've been with Hads since Christmas and you don't even know who I am" and he turned away.
Our Harry gets a resort
Everyone was trying to listen and to perform the Porcupine to Pin cushion spell but it wasn't working even if they managed to get the pronounce it correctly.
"Hadrian it will be fine and I don't think Snape will mind at all after all he is your father right" said Blaise to him taking a bite of his beef afterwards.
Before Harry could sit down he was pulled into Severus' hold and hugged him gently making everyone look at them like their head of house had grown a second head as well as other appendages.
"Dragon please try not to pick on the poor boy, you both have history together and I have to admit some bad history but I want you to help him the best that you can do, I do hear that he loves to play Quidditch as a part of the Gryffindor team" finished his father but said no more as the Floo went.
He was meant to marry my sister! Now look at the freak he cowering in the room ferrets arms like he's a baby! I was meant to be his best friend and then after our schooling he was meant to give me half of his money and the other half to Ginny!
Everyone nodded they knew that they had to get the memories from Hadrian but they didn't want to hurt him by doing this.
Otiz began poking Remus who in turn didn't know what to do, Severus picked him up and placed him on his lap but Otiz wanted nothing but to be near the Wolfie thing next to Severus he smelt like him, he smelt like Otiz did and he wanted to know why.
The other two men looked on as the once dour Potions Master smiled and laughed at the Boy Who Lived, his son...
Harry, my boy please come to my office after dinner tonight we have much to discuss.
"You're making me both uncomfortable!"
The other staff members he doesn't like
"What the hell happened to my beloved Ron?? You know he will be mine" and all three walked off, them not knowing that over half of the Great Hall had heard everything.
"Theodore Nott I'm sorry for trying to attack you. I didn't mean it honest to Merlin I didn't, I was annoyed at something but let's say Hadrian can be very convincing if he flicks my nose in animal form" said Otiz hand on the back of his own neck blushing slightly.
"Aren't you coming? This is your room" Harry then scrambled to Severus' side, Harry then looked up and asked "M-my room? My own room? at home I never really had a room, I always slept in the cupboard" Harry slowly looked around the room that he could call his, it had a four poster bed, a dresser and a desk. Harry was still so shocked that the greasy git of a Professor was being so nice. "Thank you sir" Harry mumbled while giving Severus a hug, "you're quite welcome, well off to bed with you, if you need anything at all my bedroom is just to the left of yours. The bath room is to the right of your room" Severus watched as Harry set his things down and climb into the huge bed.
The teachers tried not to laugh but in the end everyone was laughing, Severus trying desperately not to but everyone knew he would creak!
Severus looked towards the two members of staff and nodded his head but didn't move as Harry was now completely glued to his side.
~He did warn me about that, why didn't I listen to him, now look at me~
Lucius- Lu-Lu just because it annoys him
"We..."
He had pulled all the kitchen drawers out, tipped the chairs, pulled Harry's favourite blanket off the back of the sofa along with the cushions, running and jumping around! It was like he was on a complete sugar rush!
"Yes we can but I will remind you that we are spending Christmas day together you aren't getting out of that. I shall write to them as well as the Malfoy's to ask when we can come over to celebrate" and with that Severus grabbed some parchment and started writing, once he was done he handed the Malfoy's to his Raven Tyki and the Weasley's to Hedwig and they both flew off.
"What's happened?" everyone turned to Otiz wondering what had happened between the pair but all he did was sigh and then transformed into his animal form and headed up to bed.
Harry sat down and right away Hedwig left Severus and went right over to Harry and rubbed against him hooting a happy tune, not long afterwards they both headed up to the Great Hall for breakfast.
Both boys by the time they have arrived at their dorms they had both silently vowed to protect the young boy who was now their friend and not the boy who lived, he was just a young abused boy that deserved friends and a family of his own.
"Thank you Draco" said the newly dubbed Coco as she fluttered her wings slightly as she got comfortable on his shoulder this time. Her tail over his right and her head on his left.
Harry was at lunch when it happened again, he had just put a small portion of mash and some turkey on his plate and was about to eat when Ron and Hermione came over.
"Miss Granger please sit, we have a lot to discuss and I like to get this done before dinner tonight" said Minerva as she motioned for the second year to sit down in the chair in front of her desk.
He called up to Ginny to come down for her dinner, at first nothing happens but then there was a bang and shouting, he sighed as she finally appeared at the bottom of the stairs.
"Otiz say sorry to dad" said Harry as he sat down.
Everyone got ready but the stranger just stayed at the back of the class watching and waiting for anything that would happen to Harry and his friends.
"Oh so Molly and Arthur knee what there youngest been up to then?" asked Lucius being drawn into the conversation after what I just said.
Lucius: he got a new cane with a hidden wand compartment so he could have his wand at the ready just like his old one, this one had a snake head with pale blue eyes embedded and from Severus he was given some books from the Prince library, ones he had never seen before.
Pomona had cat ears that matched her hair
Everyone was quiet not even an House Elf moved within the house.
"Ron will you just leave it" snapped Hermione slamming her book close as she got up.
It was the last night before going back to school for the new year and Harry was apprehensive as tonight was dinner with the Malfoy family... yes he had spent a year with Draco finally becoming a somewhat friend to him but he still wasn't sure of Lucius, Narcissa was fine she loved him as a second son which helped Harry out alot.
"You have got to admit him thinking magic is real at this age, thirteen, is quite funny" said Becky to her sister who in turn nodded.
Once they were back at Hogwarts. Severus and Harry walked down to the dungeons, they took many twists and turns which made Harry very confused he had never been in this part of the dungeons. Severus stopped abruptly Harry could only look up at him and wonder why, Severus looked around and whispered "Horned Serpent".
They ignored her out right and continued discussing everything else.
The two left and headed back home, thank Merlin for magic and once they landed Harry just burst out into tears!
"Haddy come on now, Uncle Sev is right...."
"Yep I did" he said to them.
Easter was here, Harry was happy and finally enjoying another holiday, he was getting eggs left, right and centre and he was giving his friends some back as well... with the help from Severus of course.
"Tom get off me! I'm still mad at you, you idiot!" he tried to get up but he was stuck which didn't please him at all.
Severus placed a spell on everything that the child hybrid could get his hands on, thanking Merlin that his magic wasn't powerful enough unlike his teenage form was but still it was powerful, accidental magic or not it was bad if you upset him.
This was even worse than what Severus' own father had put him though, this was beyond what Voldemort would do to his prisoners back when he was alive eleven years ago.
"Why Professor Snape and young Master Snape what can I do for the pair of you?" he sked as sweet as anything, need to be nice otherwise I'll be dealing with one very upset Malfoy.
Third memory from the age of five, Vernon carving into his back with a knife.
"Sit and we will talk" said Tom leaving no room for an argument.
"Otiz please if you want to go back and listen to them reminisce about their youth be my guest but after listening to it very night after classes for the passed fortnight I can't stand being there" said Harry to his familiar.
"Ok so, Hadrian what's the matter with you all of a sudden?" she asked making everyone else nod all wanting to know what was wrong with the ex golden boy of Gryffindor.
"Finally you are going to get along and no more fighting I hated to see you to fight all the time when you could be friends" said Severus after a long while of watching the boys converse.
"Sorry dad's picky with quills so I have to look at each one to see if it would suit him, sorry it took a while" said Harry as he kissed him on the lips.
((Another filler chapter sorry guys but I thought you would like an insight of Ron's new life as Maxwell and how he deals with everything that's changed, he's now a Squib and lives with his new Muggle family called the Anderson's))
"Hadrian Snape" said Severus cutting off Ron only to have Hermione to finish off what Ron was saying.
They walked back down the street and entered the store that Harry had seen.
"Well we were in the reptile house when everything happened they started to verbally abuse me again, and I hid. They just wouldn't stop, the staff at the zoo had to step in and force them out, I think they are banned from going there... not sure.
"Why did he lick us?" asked Percy, only to have Severus answer as now Harry had decided to retreat into his jet black robes hiding away, Otiz clearly standing in front of him.
"Hadrian is everything alright, you seem awfully quiet?" asked Severus to his son who was sitting on the sofa looking into the flames of the heath, he only got a sigh back in response.
He opened Harry's door to see Harry tangled in the blankets covered in sweat, he gently shook the boy. "Harry? It's alright. Wake up, you're having a bad dream" Harry's eyes then opened and he nearly jumped out of the bed when he felt Severus' hand touch his shoulder. Harry started crying "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to wake you up" Harry mumbled. "It's ok. Just go back to sleep. I'll see you in the morning".
He had warned him about it but he still went and done it behind his back and now he had to go grovelling to one snarky potions professor that happened to be his boyfriend, if he could count it as that after four dates. He wasn't sure.
Tom just laughed at this making both men turn to him with a look of horror, they had no clue that Harry was now with Severus so this was going to be fun when he told them about it all.
It was finally time for Harry to get onto the train, they had floo'd over to platform 9 3/4 where his friends were waiting for him Crabbe and Goyle had gone ahead to get a compartment and save another for the three friends and Otiz.
............
"Dumbledore it has come to our attention that you have been making past, present and future students, including making Hadrian Snape go against He Who Shall Not Be Named.. " everyone shuddered besides Dumbledore of course.
"Ta da!" and he giggled to the pair of them.
As they walked Otiz picked up a scent that made his pupils turn into slits and as he tried to walk away to the smell, Severus also stopped making Harry look at them both.
This made Harry, Draco and Blaise all nod to this.
Tom smiled at this he loved Draco like a nephew and he was beginning to see Harry as a son and hopefully soon he would be calling him dad or any other form of dad by this time next year if their plans all worked out that is.
Wandless (100% blocked)
"Are"
"Dad can we go home now, I'm still tired" said Harry to him only to have Severus smile and nodded.
Otiz knows that Hadrian is upset with being here due to what he happened and has been on edge all day, don't mind him really, he's Hadrian's familiar that all"
Here is the Bio of my SMOL bean Otiz
Draco- Dray
Cold, flu, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, malnutrition, dehydrated, broken ribs, ankle, wrist, arm, leg, dislocated shoulder, hip, lacerations to back and anus, whipped, punctured lung. (Health potions given by Severus Snape, Poppy Pomfrey and Narcissa Malfoy)
"Why hello Mister Dursley, I'm sorry to tell you that Harry Potter is no longer around anymore, so please could you kindly leave this station".
He thought for a moment and a name popped into his head "Coco, your name will be Coco" he said and the magic flashed brightly bonding the two together.
Kinda like Disney World/Land depending where you are
She shall not harm you! Not in my watch!" hissed Otiz to Harry who only sighed and then flicked his nose causing him to whimper, he hated when he did that to him.
Blaise was one for friendly banter as well as a good tutor in his school work he helped out the group in things they were stuck on, mind you Harry did do only slightly better than him in some lessons and then there was Theodore Nott.
"Oh Hadrian!" exclaimed the rest of the adults in the room, Draco was leaning into his mother trying not to cry at what Harry had been through, so much more than anyone should of come through.
The next few days was nothing besides Harry and Otiz bouncing around as they were feeding off each other in their excitement about going to their first ever theme park and a Wizarding one at that it was going to be so much fun, from what he could gather his close friends were coming along.
"Thank you Draco for that and it looks like I'll have someone in my chambers tonight and most like for the foreseeable future" said Severus looking down at his shaking son and then at the familiar pacing the room.
Up at the staff table everyone was either sporting different coloured hair, animal ears and tails or even both!
Everyone got as comfortable as possible as Harry told his story
Both Otiz and Harry nodded towards the dwarf teacher.
"Morning dad" was all that was said making Severus spit out his coffee when he finally saw his son.
He walked over to the snakes and then the wolves but he didn't know what to choose at all and looked towards his father holding both.
As they entered they saw Luna picking out some rainbow coloured ink when Otiz ran over to her in animal form.
"Fawkes don't do that you don't know where he has been" said Tom gently rubbing his feathers, turning to Albus he introduced himself again as the last time he saw him they were in the court session regarding Harry.
Hermione pushed right passed Harry and his friends pushing him over landing on Otiz with a this, "Miss Granger that's two nights so far" said Flitwick to her.
Little did he know that his magic was slowly but sure slipping away and long with the signature Weasley hair and eye colour, he now had dirty blond hair and brown eyes... he had turned from Ron Weasley to Ron Noname...
"Why am I here anyway in the Muggle World I mean?" asked Ron only for the three adults to look at him and then between themselves and it looked like Severus had drawn the short straw it seemed. ((Sorry Sevvy))
"Ahh, I see your point there"
The small ginger's wand being snapped was her, the brother losing his magic; that being bound; and being brought into the Muggle World, the old fart now being in Azkaban where he truly belongs and now the wench!
“Sorry Harry, Draco we were just being children.” Hermione said.
“OK fine you stay here and I'll go get some food and bring it back up.” Harry was starting to get really hungry.
“I thought you loved me though.” Draco pouted and poked Harry in the ribs.
Draco woke up with morning wood, and knowing he had time to spare, he reached under the warm covers and into his boxers and started pulling on his cock. He found himself thinking about Potter, thinking of him as Harry! He immediately stopped what he was doing and, realising that the only way to rid himself of his problem now would be a cold shower. Resigning himself to that decision he got out of bed, giving his wand a few quick flicks to make it then got his clothes for the day, -- eighth years didn't have to wear school robes any more -- grabbed his towel and walked to the showers with his clothes and towel in front of his crotch to hide his erection.
After a few more seconds, while both boys caught their breaths Harry pulled out of Draco and used a quick wand less charm to clean the sheets and both the boys. As Harry laid down he pulled Draco down with him, letting the other boy rest his head on Harry's chest, Harry kissed the top of Draco's head. “I could get used to that.” Draco said, already half asleep.
anyway I hope you enjoy this chapter.
“Hmm, that sounds like a great idea, professor Molfoy.” Harry bowed his head in mock respect.
“A lot too I guess.” Draco said, sounding very sincere.
He didn't notice Harry look over and smile at his display; shovelling mash potato into his mouth, followed by a spoon full of mushy peas, washed down with a gulp of whatever was closest. He only noticed Harry once he put his hand on draco's shoulder and said "Hey, you might want to slow down there, we don't want you choking on your food," he smiled, then followed that with a mumbled, "at least not any more."
Draco remembered that day too, he knew it was Harry. He would know Harry anywhere even if he was blind, deaf and stupid. But he just couldn't do that to Harry, he had wanted Harry to win the war anyway so it was just a good opportunity for him to give Harry a way to win. “Yeah well, I just wanted you to win, my life at the manor was horrible and I knew that if I said it wasn't you, then I'd be able to get out of that hell-hole.” Draco confessed. He didn't know when he got so comfortable with Harry but he was glad that he did because otherwise this would be really oversharing.
“Oh yeah I forgot you're perfect, not fine.” Draco said, not without affection.
But apart from all of that Harry was glad that he could have some kind of normal routine again -- or ever really -- and that's what staying at the burrow helped him have.
Draco thought it best to do this in the room of requirement, it made sense, no one would be here. The room had conjured a mirror for him, which he was standing in front of. He wondered what would happen to his clothes when he transformed. Would they go to some magical limbo? Fall to the ground? Get shredded if he changes into a larger animagus? None of the books seemed to mention this detail. He quite liked the shirt that he was wearing, a stylish button up, cream coloured, soft and wrinkle free, absolutely immaculate, unlike Potter’s clothes. Jumpers with holes in them, muggle jeans. Great now he’s thinking about Potter when he’s about to change into a Ferret, way to ruin this Potter. He looked back into the mirror, facing his reflection, challenging it, he looked at his sleeve, he knew what was lurking under there, that horrible Dark mark. That was another reason this shirt was his favourite, it hid his Mark. He hated that Mark, but he had a job to do. He looked away from his forearm searching for something else to focus on. He looked into its eyes, moved closer to them, they usually looked grey but sometimes they were more blue. Right now they looked pale blue, pale like the rest of him, unlike Potter’s naturally tanned skin. Merlin! He’s thinking of Potter again. It’s just the nerves he tells himself, pull yourself together, he takes a deep breath that fogs up the mirror, you’ve read about this for months, it doesn’t hurt, you’ll be fine. He moves back from the mirror, looks himself up and down almost as if it’s the last time he’ll be able to, and then closes his eyes.
“You're welcome, Harry.” he emphasized Harry's name. Harry smiled at Draco and started eating the food Draco had laid out for them.
“I can and I will.” Harry stated as he rubbed Draco's ass with open palms.
At first Draco tried to eat small amounts of food thinking that his stomach wouldn't reject the small intrusion, but that proved to be wrong and useless as he still threw up until all that came out was bile. So he tried a different tactic, he ate as much as he could, filling himself to the brim. He ate so much he was bursting at the seams. This too proved to be fruitless as he still threw up everything in his stomach right down to the bile, that bitter, hot and acidic bile that burned his throat as he convulsed and spewed out the vile substance. Nothing he tried worked so he just ate when he felt like it -- which wasn't very often any more as the thought of food made him think of kneeling over a toilet and tasting that horrible bile as it came up to spill out of his mouth and make him weak and exhausted.
“Thank you, thank-” Draco blubbered into Harry’s neck.
“It’s just that I can fall asleep better, if I, well when I- in my animagus form.” Draco stuttered out.
“Well actually cuddling with you is pretty nice, the talking about our problems is a little shitty but otherwise, being with you here is nice.” Harry said.
“Yeah sure.” she didn’t look up from the article she was reading. Harry leaned over to Draco and kissed his cheek. Draco turned toward Harry and caught his lips in a chaste kiss. “You guys are adorable but could you refrain from being adorable at breakfast, people are staring.” Hermione went back to reading, shaking her head.
“So-,” seh dragged out the ‘o’, “where were you this morning? Usually you’re the first one down.”
Harry obliged Draco's wishes, though he moved his hand to Draco's chest where he moved his fingers in circles before moving over Draco's stomach to the hem of the T-shirt Draco was wearing. Harry teased the edge until Draco whined, then Harry slowly moved his hand under the T-shirt and ran his hind up Draco's Stomach and up to his chest. Draco rolled over in Harry's arms and met Harry in an open-mouthed kiss. Harry eased his tongue into Draco's mouth and explored it, memorising it. Both boys moaned when Harry nipped Draco's bottom lip, sucking it into his mouth then kissing it again. Harry still had his hands underneath Draco's shirt and had moved them around to his back when they started kissing. Draco had his hands in Harry's hair.
“Harry, I really like you and I'm definitely on the right track to being in love with you but I'm just not quite there yet. I'm sorry.” Draco felt like he’d disappointed Harry. Like because he didn't love Harry back he'd hurt him. Draco had started to cry again. He really cared about Harry, so when he felt like he’d hurt him he started crying. Draco felt completely responsible for hurting Harry.  “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry Harry. I want to love you, I’m sorry for not loving you.” Draco had started sobbing.
“Nah, it's fine, it actually gave me a chance to practice wand less magic.” Draco boasted,” You know I'm actually pretty good now.”
“Well that's not very nice.” when Draco just continued to glare at Harry he relented “Fine, fine I'll go, but only because I need to get my stuff.” Harry turned towards the door to go.
“I said, you were the one that I was thinking about.” Harry was so relieved that he finally got to say that he just kept saying it, “I like you Draco, I like you and I know that it'll probably ruin our friendship but I just can't help it, I like you.” Harry knew that he had started babbling so he shut his mouth and waited for Draco to say something. But when Draco was still silent after a few more moments Harry said “Draco, are you OK? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Can you just say something please.”
“OK, but I'm telling you now, nothing can tame my hair.” Harry was in the chair now, facing the mirror.
Sorry for not posting for about a month, I've just been really busy with school and work and I just couldn't be bothered to write. But I finally finished this next chapter - there is some smut in it - and I hope you like it.
On the way down they both decided to tell their friends about their relationship. They decided to sit at the Gryffindor table to tell Harry's friends first. They walked into the Hall without holding hands but when they sat down they held hands under the table. Hermione raised an eyebrow at the absence of the two boys hands but didn't say anything. Harry realized that he would have to get the attention of his friends without the help of anyone else. This proved harder than he would have thought. He first succeeded in getting the attention of Hermione and Ron fairly easily but it was a lot harder to pull Dean and Seamus from their conversation about Merlin knows what. Though when he finally had the attention of his friends (excluding Neville as he was sitting with Luna at the Ravenclaw table) he didn't know what exactly to say. He didn't just want to say ‘Draco and I are dating’ but he also didn't want to say ‘Draco and I used to be enemies and we have had our differences in the past but in the past few weeks we have found that we get along pretty well, as you already know, and, well, we both really like each other and are very attracted to each other and are now in a relationship.’ because both were decent ways of explaining that he and Draco were dating but neither felt like the right thing to say.
“What about me?” Draco played at being innocent.
“Of course, Potter, I’ll apologize and explain everything to all you Gryffindors, I want to be on the right side of the war. I completely understand that I need to work to gain all of your trust, and I will, I’m here to help.” Draco said.
“Stop please, I'm begging you.”
It had been a week since Draco had started his eighth year at Hogwarts, he'd been to all of his classes by now. It was annoying because there were some seventh years in his classes too. It was mostly uneventful though, which was good for Draco except for the fact that that gave him the perfect opportunity to sit at the edge of his bed in his own dorm room (the eighth years were given their own rooms this year) and ponder the question he's been trying to answer for the past week; ‘why did Potter take such good care of his wand?’
“Draco I’m not hurt OK. I’m fine, I’m happy actually.” Harry smiled.
Harry eventually got into a rhythm, in and out as Draco thrust his hips back against Harry's every time he pushed back in. Harry was fucking into Draco faster and faster with every thrust of his hips. He wrapped his arms around Draco's chest and pulled him up so Draco's back was against Harry's chest. Harry, still holding Draco up with one arm used the other to wrap a hand around Draco's prick and started stroking Draco in time to his thrusts.
Harry took that as encouragement and positioned himself a bit lower than before, started licking and sucking at Draco's balls and moving down, down until he stopped right before he got to Draco's entrance. Harry sat up, tapped Draco's bare legs and said “Roll over.” Draco slowly complied, “Don't you want my tongue in your arse?”
“W-what?” Harry sputtered, “How? When? Why would someone do that?”
“Yeah that.” Harry said in a bored tone.
“Yeah we all know.” Hermione said as Ron handed her 10 sickles.
Harry quickly pulled his pants back up and used a scourgify on his hands before he opened the door. Though when Harry found Draco standing there he thought he'd summoned him, just by thinking about him, and then wanking to the thought of him. But then Draco held up his wand and asked in an almost angry way “Why did you take such good care of my wand? Huh? Why didn’t you just break it? Or burn it? I mean I deserved it! Didn't I?” Draco had started to breathe heavily, this made Harry start to panic a little. Harry had been asking himself these questions too for a long time. Of course he knew that he liked Draco now and didn't wish him or his wand harm, but he didn't know how to tell Draco that.
“What do you mean ‘why?’ I want you to get away from me because you're annoying me!”
“Uh, on my back, so I can see you.” Draco said with more confidence than he felt.
The trio sat in the common room for a while discussing Gryffindor business or something, Draco didn’t know because he just curled up on Potter’s lap and went to sleep, Potter stroking his back. Draco loved the feeling, Potter was so warm, his movements so loving and soothing, Draco couldn’t ask for anything better. He was rudely awoken by Potter lifting him up and taking him to his room. But when they got there Potter put him on the bed, and started to get undressed. Draco didn’t know whether to look away or to see what Potter had to offer. In the end he chose a mixture of watching and glancing away. From what Draco could gather Potter is quite thin, he has a few muscles here and there, but not much. He’s quite good looking though, despite the scars on his arms and chest and back, when and how Potter got them Draco can only guess. Overall Potter is attractive and that is all Draco needs to know.
The two boys spent the rest of the day talking, laughing, kissing and relaxing. Both of them were laughing about something Harry said as Draco kissed Harry and pulled him down to lie on top of him. The kiss grew in intensity and soon they were both only in their boxers. “Do you want to keep going?” Harry panted.
“You don't have to apologise, it's not your fault.” Harry said again.
“Wait your into a guy!” Draco said so shocked that he almost forgot what he was meant to be talking to Harry about, “Well now I have to know who he is.” Draco demanded after a few shocked seconds.
Once Draco had finished his morning routine, properly this time, he made his way down to the Great Hall to join his friends for breakfast. When he got there he automatically looked over to the Gryffindor table to see if Potter was there yet, he was, and he looked so good. His hair ruffled, just like always, his cheeks slightly red, he was wearing one of his jumpers, though this one didn’t have holes in it - none were visible at least - and Draco fell a little more for him in that moment. Draco had always been attracted to males more than females, though he tried to repress those feelings because he knew he’d never be able to act on them. His feelings for Potter however, were not going to be denied, they really wanted to be felt. For some reason Draco just could not push them down. They were there and they did not want to leave. But he couldn’t just stare at Potter, so Draco forced himself to look away as he finished the rest of his breakfast that he barely even noticed eating. Whilst he finished his tea he thought of how he should best approach Potter. Should he send a note? Would he read it? Should he just walk up to him and tell him? But what would he say? He can’t just say ‘I’m good now’ Potter would never believe that. Draco hadn’t even realised that in all his thinking he’d looked back over to Potter, who was also looking at Draco. Well this is it Draco thought, If I can just tell him now then it’ll be fine. Draco jerked his head towards the doors of the Great Hall and stood up. As he walked towards the doors he looked back to see Potter standing, telling his friends, what Draco assumed was that he was leaving. Draco continued walking, once he reached the doors he looked back, caught Potter’s eye and nodded to the left to indicate that he would wait for him there.
However Draco made the decision for him by saying, “Ah, Harry and I would like you to know that we are dating,” he held up their clasped hands as evidence, “and if you have any issues with that then too bad because there's no way we're breaking up, at least not any time soon.” Draco smiled at Harry and squeezed his hand.
“Like this?” Draco asked. Harry nodded in approval as he moved off the bed. Harry quickly removed his boxers and settled himself between Draco's spread legs, admiring the way the position allowed him to see all of Draco. He kissed his way up Draco's thighs to his lips where he lingered for a second, his left hand stroked along Draco’s cock and his right hand went to Draco’s entrance. After breaking the kiss he asked, “Wanna know one of the wand less spells I learned?” he circled Draco's entrance with his middle finger.
“Come on, like you don’t love being called that at least a little bit.” Draco said raising and lowering his eyebrows.
“Whatever, as long as you're gone I don't care what you do or why you do it.” Draco had started to gather his books for transfiguration.
Draco was dressed now and was combing his hair. “You know if you combed your hair it wouldn't look like a birds nest.” Draco teased.
Harry leaned forward and just before he captured Draco's lips in a kiss he said, “I love you, Draco.”
“OK,” Harry took a deep, calming breath and said “Iwasthinkingaboutyou.”
“The famous Harry Potter just complimented me, this is the best day of my life.” Draco said sarcastically.
“Smiling, you mean?” Potter laughed, laughed.
“Yeah fine.” then he really did leave and Draco was hit with a wall of silence, the only thing filling it was his ragged breathing.
Draco’s heart was beating out of his chest. He could barely breathe by the time he got back to the castle. He decided to skip his transfigurations class and just go straight to his room. He needed time to think about what Harry had just admitted to him.
Draco was going to drive himself insane thinking about this. He just wanted the answer. Draco didn't even realise that he had gotten up and was walking over to Potter’s room until he had already knocked.
“Without you I'd never have won the war.” Harry was completely sincere.
“Then that doesn’t matter, all that matters is that I love you and we’ll get through this, everything will be OK.” Harry felt Draco melt into him.
They continued eating and talking until they’d all finished their food. Ron and Hermione returned to their shared dorm as did Dean and Seamus. Harry and Draco decided to go on a walk around the castle grounds for a bit before going back to Harry’s dorm.
Draco looked down.
Draco didn’t want to leave. Potter was so warm and the Slytherin rooms were so cold in winter. Maybe if he just turned back into a ferret now he could stay, just until Potter got up then he’d be able to sneak off. Yes that was a better plan. He’d be able to better blend in among the hustle and bustle of students getting ready for the day. So he’d be late for breakfast if he stayed, but he didn’t really care about that. All Draco cared about was the warmth of Potter. The feeling of Potter wrapped around him. Potter’s nose nuzzled into his neck. Potter’s legs tangled with his own. Potter’s chest pressed to his back feeding Draco his warmth. Potter’s cock pressed against his arse. Potter’s cock pressed against his arse? Why did Draco even think of that? It was quite noticeable. The length of it. The hardness. What was Draco thinking? This is Potter. You do not think about your enemy like this. It’s like rule number 1 of enemies: Do Not Think Of Thy Enemy Romantically Or Sexually. Draco has violated that rule. Perhaps he should leave, before it’s too late. Though it’s already too late really and what more harm can be done?
“OK.” Draco said then shamelessly added, “What were you thinking about anyway, it must have been good because you're blushing so much.” Draco laughed.
“I-what? You don't deserve me, you deserve someone who’s good and not fucked up like me.”
“Um, I don't know about 10 or 15 maybe.” Draco said, trying to count the spells he could cast without the use of a wand.
“Of course it's a bloody good thing!” Draco was definitely angry now, “And it matters because, well because, because you’re a prick!” Harry couldn't help but laugh at that. “Stop laughing, it's not funny”
Draco had woken up from his peaceful sleep to a horrible feeling in his stomach. He realised that he hadn't vomited after he ate dinner that evening. In realising that he got up out of Harry’s arms as quickly and quietly as he could and practically ran to the bathroom, he didn't even shut the door to Harry's room or his stall in his haste.
“Can you just fuck off.” Draco was almost back to his dorm room.
“Please.” Harry breathed.
To which malfoy responded “Yeah, actually I do have a problem,” he paused for a second to consider his next words carefully, “I have a problem with you stealing my wand. Which if you still have I would like it back.”
“And you can suck it.” Draco quipped back before he really thought about what he was saying.
Harry said a wand less lubrication charm and inserted the tip of his finger moving his left hand to rest on the bed beside Draco, supporting his weight. “I learned that one just so I could use it on you.” Harry smirked, “Well I hoped I’d get to use it on you.” Harry added. Draco just moaned at the intrusion.
The two boys woke up about an hour later, just in time for dinner. So after kissing for a few minutes they got up and dressed, Draco whining the whole time about just staying and going for round two. Harry, however, was persistent --though a little tempted to give in to Draco -- and they made their way down to the Great Hall.
“Yeah, OK.” Draco said to the ground.
“Yeah I know that but I still haven’t told my mother about us and I really don’t want her to find out like this.” Draco was visibly upset.
“You're a dick.”
“If I'd have known that all it took was giving you food I would have done this sooner.” Draco laughed, still blushing.
Class ended and Harry got out before Draco did so he waited for him in the hall outside the classroom. When Draco finally came out he was looking down and walking fast so Harry had to grab Draco and say “Hey, Malfoy” to get his attention.
Draco always felt a bit sick and was used to it now so he just replied saying, “Better after sleeping.” then he remembered everything that Harry had done and added, “Thanks for everything you did last night, I'm just sorry you had to be there for it.”
“Merlin yes.” Draco practically moaned. So with that Harry kissed the tip of Draco’s cock and licked a stripe from the base back to the tip where he wrapped his lips around and started sucking. Harry took Draco’s cock as far into his mouth as he could and Draco put his hands into Harry’s hair and pulled slightly. Harry moaned at his hair being pulled, this sent vibrations down Draco’s cock and he mewled at the feeling. Harry kept moaning as he sucked Draco’s length making Draco moan and mewl and whimper. Draco started to meet Harry’s mouth, thrusting his hips up. Harry sped up his pace as he sucked deeper causing Draco to let out a string of “Fuck, yes Harry, oh faster.” and other such obscenities. After a few more seconds of this and Draco was screaming, “Oh Harry I’m gonna cum. Fuck, fuck I’m gonna cum.” Harry just sucked harder and faster and Draco came down Harry’s throat. Harry swallowed all of it.
“I would rather you call me ‘the famous Harry Potter’.” Harry said twisting up his face in disgust.
“Harry you love me right?” Draco panted.
sorry for not posting updates for ages, but school is annoying and demands attention so I've been short on free time to write.
Draco sighed contentedly.
“You don't need to apologise.” Draco said after a beat. “I think I just need a second to digest this information, OK?”
“Yes, you were in it.” Harry said sheepishly.
“Whatever smartass let's just go.” Draco was starting to get really pissed off.
“Whatever Potter, let's just eat before-”
“Hey, hey it's OK, we’ll write her a letter at lunch today and explain everything to her. She’ll understand and everything will be fine, yeah?” Harry hugged Draco to himself and ran a soothing hand up and down his back.
The two boys walked for a little longer after that, but soon were headed back to Harry’s dorm room to sleep. The eighth years were allowed to stay up for as long as they liked but were encouraged to stick to the same curfew as the other students. When the two reached Harry’s dorm they changed into their boxers and got into Harry’s bed together, Harry spooning Draco. They weren’t very tired as they’d slept in that morning and they’d also had a nap so they just talked and kissed for a while longer before Draco fell asleep with his head on Harry’s chest again. Harry stroked Draco’s hair for a while longer then fell asleep himself, holding Draco to himself. Though just before he fell asleep he said in a soft voice, so as to not wake Draco, “Good night, my love, good night.”
"What in ghostly name are you doing there, my lesson on the Goblins War's is in no far complete, go sit down" and right away he was back talking about the Goblins.
"Harry Potter is sitting right there! Next to the bat!" shouted Ginny making everyone look at her, she was what twelve what was a student doing here?
They spent another half and hour looking at clothes and toys for Otiz who was completely out cold on Severus' shoulder snoring away.
"You kidnapped our nephew and you expect us to be quiet about it and after a year you appear with the blasted god for nothing freak at this place!
In class Minerva was writing up instructions on the board while everyone waited, this gave Ron time to write a note, making sure it flew over to Harry and his stupid slimy cohorts but before it even had a chance to lande Minerva turned round but before she could even comprehend what was happening the parchment was lit on fire and there was growling.
"Hadwin Oti bored, wants up!" said the now six year old Otiz who had stopped in front of them all lifting his arms up asking; read demanding; to be picked up.
Severus rubbed his back and glared at the students before him "twenty points from Gryffindor each for bullying and detention both with Flitch for a week each to you Mister Weasely and Miss Granger. I suggest you two go to your next class" the pair fled the office as fast as they could.
"Get Hadrian here now!" said Blaise to everyone in the room, the commotion outside Severus' office was heard and both the occupants tan out to see what was wrong.
"Pro-professor, it is really you?" asked Harry only to have Severus smile a true smile making him smile back towards the man sitting next to him.
Harry couldn't believe his eyes at what he was seeing, the thought it would be something like the Muggle one he had seen when the Dursley's took Dudley and he was forced to stay in the car on a burning hot summer's day but this time was different.
"Oh my love I know you didn't mean to but.. what has happened has happened" he hugged him "we are going to be in so much trouble, me for escaping and you for attacking someone which we all know you didn't mean to" he looked up to the sky to see that it was now becoming lighter as they spoke and so turned to Otiz to say something but all he did was nod and she started to drag Hermione away, stopping at the tree where Harry and Draco were hiding and brought them all back to the school.
"Thank you Otiz" said Theo to him slightly shocked by what had happened, within seconds Otiz hand changed into his child from and had squeezed himself between Blaise and Theo sitting happily there lending into Theo as he went back to reading his book.
A picture of Lily, his wand and his robe.
"Miss Weasely you have twenty plus cases open on you from when you left school today alone and I expect many more to come in during the day about what you have done to the student population, Potion Master Snape has asked you to be brought to court over threating to murder his son.
Charlie- 'Arlie
"She will live as a Squib, she won't be allowed to do magic, snap the wand she won't be needing it anymore, I will teach her how to cook us meals and clean up the Burrow all without magic that is" said Molly making Arthur nod.
Harry had returned to school and was right away brought into a hug by Ron and Hermione, at first he flinched but slowly relaxed but didn't completely relax like he used to, he didn't really trust them for some reason.
"Well we were doing homework before you two fell asleep discussing going to Hogsmeade this weekend, uncle Sev said that Hadrian can go from now on and we were trying to wake him up but it wasn't working" said Draco as he headed to the dorm room with Otiz following holding Harry bride style.
Nothing more, nothing less.
~stay away from him, you smell of danger and blood, you touch one hair on his head and I will kill you~
"What was it that you two were talking about? You know we can't understand Parseltounge" said Lucius to Tom who smiled to him and Severus.
Severus knew he had to take small steps to insure that Harry was kept unharmed by anything that had happened, he tip toed around everything that he thought would bring mad memories to the poor boy.
"Professor what is this all about?" asked Hermione to her only for her head of house to sigh and gathered her thoughts before she continued but before she could Hermione chimed up about her work and that she has asked other students if they could read them and they could but Minerva just sighed again.
Eighth memory from the age of ten, nothing to eat and drink again but this time for a fortnight.
"I am Nairi and I'll be looking after your apartment during your stay" and she smiled again, this in turn made Harry smile as well.
"This is freaking awesome" his blond hair had come out of his leather tie and was all over the place screaming in joy.
"I do but I can finish them tonight when I have a student in detention for blowing up a cauldron again" and so the two headed to the Headmasters.
"No it's Harry!" said Ginny to him
"Dray can you let dad know that I'm with Professor McGonagall" and with that he left.
"I see he came to you for a nap" laughed Tom as he placed Harrys trunk by the Floo and sat down carefully next to Severus.
"...our little...
"What is that thing?" shouted Ginny so then everyone could hear her, this made Harry lean into Draco and made Otiz growl.
Otiz just nodded and Harry waved his friends goodbye and then they both turned to Filius.
He would of fallen but Severus had found out his was appalling at Magical travel means having to catch him many a times when they had apparated a few times as well as Portkey which he was absolutely abysmal at landing and would always throw up if he wasn't holding to Severus at any given time, with the floo he was ever slightly better as he was using it more due to coming and going from Malfoy Manor but still bad.
How do you feel? It couldn't of been one of the best days I have to admit but that was only once and hopefully we wont have to deal with them again for some time" and he sat on the bed.
"So where are we going in Hogsmeade? I do want to try the sweets and have a butterbeer" said Otiz finally leaving as walking down to the little village along with everyone else following.
~Nagini don't tell me what to do, I am your master~
"Ah Fawkes my faithful companion are you here to help me?" asked Albus and when he brought his hands up Fawkes bit him hard and drew blood.
Over an hour later and the prank finally wore off and they had finally started eating there meal but still no sign of Harry or Otiz for that matter.
"Sir be reasonable. Hadrian isn't here because you didn't ask for him" said Percy trying to calm the infuriated professor down.
"I've slept with almost everyone in the Hufflepuff House both male and female, they are just so easy"
"Do I have to?!" moaned Harry to his father but he knew it was wasted as his father only nodded to him.
"Oof! I'm going to be sick, just leave me here and go on without me" and he laid down on a bench, only to be pulled up not five minutes later by Harry and Otiz.
“Well I can pull off anything.” Draco said flirtatiously. Then Harry pulled Draco into a kiss. Ending it only to ask, “What side of the bed do you want to sleep on?”
“Honestly I’ve slept better the past two nights than I have my whole life. I’m meant to hate you, but, I just feel so much better when you’re around, like you keep me grounded or something, I don’t know, I’m not very good at expressing my feelings. I can hardly identify them most of the time anyway.” Harry laughed without humor.
“Well then, why didn’t you say anything, and why did you act like you didn’t know?” Draco questioned.
“Ah, what are you doing here? And why did you call me ‘Draco’?” Draco asked, attempting to shift the focus to Potter.
They both looked at each other and said, “Three!”
“Thanks.” Draco said as he kissed Harry's bare chest. Harry just hummed in response and ran his hand over Draco's shoulder and back as the two drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
Once Draco finished his breakfast he looked up, he just couldn’t help himself, though he wasn’t expecting the chosen one’s eyes on him. He just wanted to glance at that arrogant prick, but now he was locked in a staring contest with Potter. Draco started to worry that maybe Potter was on to him, that he knew Draco was the ferret, but he couldn’t know, not really. Sure Potter could suspect that it was him but, Potter can’t possibly know. Draco would be safe so long as he alway made sure never to give Potter any reason to suspect him. Still Potter was staring at him, the worst part was that Draco didn’t even mind, in fact he liked it, more than liked it, it was turning him on. He had to look away just to prevent an erection. What was happening to him? He hated Potter, he didn’t get turned on by him. That was something that was not meant to happen. All he did was accidentally sleep in Potter’s bed with him. There was no reason to feel this way about Potter. He’d have to worry about it later though because he had potions now, with Potter as well, hopefully he wouldn’t get too distracted.
“You don't need to apologise, it was my fault in the first place.”
Harry just laughed and squeezed Draco’s hand before going back to his breakfast, smiling to himself. Draco, also smiling, turned to the paper and looked at the front page headline, it read as follows “RIVALRY TURNED ROMANCE?” That caught Draco’s attention, he looked at the accompanying photo, to his absolute horror it showed a photo of himself and Harry at their picnic where they kiss and pull back to look at each other.  He quickly scanned through the article, picking up key information like “anonymous source sent a photo of the two who seem to no longer be rivals but, who now appear to be romantic partners.” and “our source also tells us that the two have been seen together constantly having been holding hands, kissing and exchanging loving looks to each other. Is this a start to a new relationship or have they been together long before their eighth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry?” Draco threw the paper down, not caring that it had gotten in his food, then turned towards Harry who was already looking at Draco, and blurted “Someone leaked a photo of us,” he motioned between them, “to the freaking Prophet and now everyone knows about our relationship!”
Draco checked his watch, it read a quarter to five, “it’s four forty five, we slept through class.” Draco sat up, realising that he was still lying on Harry.
“Oh, well if you want to go with your other friends then you can, you don't have to wait for me.” Draco said sounding disappointed.
“How was it your fault?”
“Oh like you're so good, you’re the one who bumped into me.” Harry half-heartedly retorted.
“Mmnh but it's so nice and warm and I don't want to go to astronomy.”
“There's no need for sarcasm or name calling.” Harry fake scolded him.
They stayed like that for a while, hugging, laughing, crying and swaying occasionally. But Harry had finally composed himself enough to pull away just enough to look at Draco. He just looked at Draco for a while but then he said, “Our lives are so fucked up.”
He tried to convince himself that Harry was just fucking with him, that it wasn't true. But he knew Harry well enough to know that that wasn't the case. Harry had only told Draco because Draco had forced him to. If he'd just stopped pushing and pushing then he wouldn't be here now. Though he realised why he'd been pushing Harry for the answer so much, it was because he didn't want Harry to like someone else. He didn't want anyone else to have Harry's attention. He wanted Harry's attention, Harry's affection, Harry's love. He wanted Harry. And Harry wanted him too. He smiled at that. Harry Potter, golden boy, saviour of the wizarding world, the boy who lived twice, the boy who'd defeated Voldemort, liked him, and Draco liked him back!
“Well, how often did you think about me?”
“Because I care about you.” Harry kissed Draco.
“Nope sorry, I'm hungry and it's time for breakfast.” Harry stated.
Draco felt himself getting closer, too close, so he said, “Harry, please I need you inside me now.” Harry just nodded and moved off of Draco, motioning with his hands to indicate that he wanted Draco to spread his legs. Once he had his legs sufficiently parted, Harry whispered the lubrication charm and brought his fingers to Draco’s entrance. The anticipation of what Draco knew was coming next was almost unbearable, though when Harry’s first finger slowly entered Draco it was the most pleasure he’d felt since, well since the last time Harry’s finger was in his arse, but it felt extremely good. Before long Harry was inserting a second finger, there was a slight burn at first but after a few thrusts it was just pleasure. Harry had started to scissor his fingers, stretching Draco. When Harry had added a third finger and was scissoring him open even wider, Draco - who was almost lost in the pleasure - said, “More, please I need your cock.”. He didn’t even care that he was begging and that he’d probably look back on this in the morning and feel embarrassed, but that was future Draco’s problem, right now he didn’t care; he just wanted to feel Harry inside of him. Harry, upon hearing this, swiftly removed his fingers - lingering to admire the way Draco looked beneath him - and whispered the lubrication spell again, rubbing it along his throbbing cock. Harry moved forward slightly, then after positioning his cock at Draco’s entrance looked up to see Draco looking back at him with mostly desire and lust in his eyes, but also love. Draco nodded at Harry and he suddenly felt full, Harry had entered him almost all the way to the hilt, but stopped just before. Draco was ready for the intrusion though, having done this with Harry a few times now he was almost accustomed to the feeling of Harry’s cock filling up his arse. As this was the case Draco nodded again and Harry pushed the rest of the way in. They quickly got into a rhythm, Harry thrusting in and out, Draco grinding his hips up to meet Harry’s as he thrusted into Draco at a loving but fast pace. Draco felt every thrust of Harry’s hips meet him in the most delicious ways, with Harry hitting Draco’s prostate almost every thrust. Harry started tugging Draco’s cock as he continued to thrust into him.
Thank you so much for reading. Xxx
Draco tried to stop thinking about his feelings for Harry and just get on with his morning.
“What? Why are you laughing?” Draco looked down at himself to check that he looked ok, “is something wrong with my hair?” Draco smoothed down his hair.
“Yeah, you're right--”
Though Draco would love to stay and curl up in Potter’s lap he really should get back to the slytherin dorms before anyone gets too suspicious. He got up out of Potter’s lap and bounded to the door. Potter looked up at him, a questioning look on his face, so Draco scratched the door to let Potter know that he wanted to leave. Potter walked to the door, “You want to leave? Don’t you want to stay, just for a little longer?” Potter said, hand on the door knob. Draco scratched the door again, indicating that he wanted to leave. “Oh ok but promise you’ll come back?” Either Potter is delusional or he thinks that a ferret can actually understand and acknowledge a promise. Nevertheless Draco nodded and scratched the door again. Potter opened it for him and walked down the stairs with Draco to open the portrait hole for him too. “Bye, baby.” Potter said, as he waved to Draco. He looked back to see that Potter was closing the portrait, Draco felt sad, almost like he’d never see Potter again. He didn’t know why his feelings had changed so much, first he hates Potter, then he’s so attracted to him that he can’t focus and now he’s sad to leave the boy. What was going on with Draco?
“Uh,well,” Seamus scratched the back of his head, “I said you’d tell us at breakfast. Said you wouldn’t leave your room until morning.” Seamus looked down at his plate.
Draco did not expect this. He thought that Potter would have broken his wand, set it on fire, blow it up, anything. Anything but to keep it in perfect condition. But Draco couldn't stop to think about this now and so he pocketed the wand and continued on his way to the entrance of Hogwarts for his last year there.
After a few minutes of doing this Harry started to stir, then he was squirming, and that was how Draco ended up pinned under Harry. “You know I was having a great dream.” Harry said, then kissed Draco.
“Yes please. It’s just too much right now and I’m still groggy.” Draco crawled to Harry and hugged him, because the feeling of heat in his cheeks was not going to go away any time soon and he didn’t want Harry to see his face flushed.
Draco finally got to the bathrooms, ran into the closest stall and removed his robes. He was reluctant to take his boxers off, not because he was uncomfortable with being nude but because it meant that he would have physical evidence that he had gotten hard because Harry had been straddling him.
“Yes-.” Draco breathed a long sigh.
“Well it was a weird situation and you were just being nice.”
He then apologised to hermione and Ron, for not just the slurs and name calling but for any harm he may have caused them in their pursuit to rid the world of the dark lord. He made it abundantly clear that he would do what he could to help them from now on.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” Draco sobbed into Potter’s shoulder.
“Because I'm such a fucking fuck up.” Draco sobbed.
Harry laughed and grabbed Draco’s hand, stopping him from trying to fix it, and brought it to his lap, lacing their fingers together and said, “I’ve given up on trying to brush it, usually I just sort of run my hands through it and hope for the best.”
T-shirt. Harry got into his bed behind Draco and spooned him. Draco hummed a sigh. Harry started to lightly brush his fingertips over Draco's arm and kiss the back of his neck. “Mmm, yes keep doing that.” Draco murmured.
When he arrived at his destination he quickly chose a shower closed the curtain, used every locking charm he knew on it, hung up his towel and clothes, undressed himself and finally turned on the water, cold at first to stifle his erection then hot to soothe his body (and mind). After about 20 minutes Draco turned off the water, towelled himself dry, put his clothes on, grabbed his pyjamas and towel, opened the curtain and saw Potter standing at one of the sinks. He wasn't even washing his hands or looking in the mirror, he was leaning against it and looking at Draco, he even had a smirk on his face! That fucking prick was fucking smiling! He was fucking amused.
“Fuck off. You're such a dick head, I did something nice for you and you just had to make fun of me.” Draco said dismissively.
Thank you so much for the reads! I'm sorry this chapter took so long for me to post but I've been a bit busy and unmotivated so I had trouble writing it but it's done now and probably really bad so I'm sorry.
“Harry you don't need to thank me for forgiving you.” Draco said sadly, he didn't want Harry's thanks he just wanted this whole thing over with.
Draco opened his eyes, stood up and stretched. Thankfully he was still a ferret. He looked over at Potter, still asleep, he looked so peaceful. It’s really not fair, why should Draco have nightmares and horrible sleeps when the Chosen One gets to sleep like a rock? No it was fair, Potter was on the right side of the war, he was part of the good side, Draco, like all the Malfoy’s, was on the wrong side, the side with evil. Draco looked down at his little ferret arm, no Dark Mark in sight. That made him feel better. He probably never would have gotten it in the first place if he’d been friends with Potter. It was too late though, Potter would never be friends with him now, would he? Perhaps if Draco was really sincere in his apology then Potter would see that he really did want to be on his side, that he could be an ally. Draco was fairly intelligent, he'd be able to help the trio in their fight against evil, help them research and plot. He’d even be able to spy for them, like a double agent. He could give false information to The Dark Lord.
“Why?” Harry actually sounded curious.
“A lot.” Harry finally said, then flipped it on to Draco, “What about you though?”
“Go on spit it out, I want to know why makes the golden boy blush.” Draco was determined to know.
“You are brave though, and I know it seems as though I'm brave but without everyone helping me I would have been cowering in a corner long ago.” Harry's attempt at joking didn't work so he gave in to the seriousness of the conversation.
The train ride was mostly a blur of scenery and Ron and Hermione snogging, talking and laughing. Harry talked and laughed too, but mostly he just thought about Draco and what it would be like to kiss him the way Ron kisses Hermione (or vise-versa).
“OK.” Harry said, trying to keep his voice at a normal pitch.
Thank you so much for reading! Though again I suck at writing and I've never written anything smutty so sorry if it's bad.
“Wouldn't you like to know.” Harry tried, and failed, to get the upper hand.
“What for?” Harry asked confused.
“Well, you know who asked me to do something for him, so that's where I was.” he lied, he couldn’t tell her the truth. “I will also have to continue to do as he’s asked tonight so I’m going to put my books away now and do that.” Draco looked at Pansy daring her to stop him. “So, if you don’t mind I’m going to go now.” Draco finished.
“Oh, well I guess it was just because of our history and if I’d had your wand then I probably would have broken it, or well at least engrave DM on it.”
“Yeah, I've got a few old T-shirts that you can wear.” then Harry stood up and moved to his cupboard to pull out two wrinkled T-shirts, one for himself and one for Draco. Both boys got changed into the T-shirts and just kept their boxers on. “Hmm, you look good in my clothes.” Harry mused when he saw Draco.
With that Draco bolted up the stairs to his dorm, dumped his stuff and ran back down and out the portrait hole. He had overheard the golden trio talk about going to the girls bathroom, the one with Moaning Myrtle in it, tonight. So with that information in mind he made his way to the ROR to change, out of sight. Once he’d done that he trotted over to the girl’s bathroom to wait for Potter. It didn’t take long for them to come out. They were chattering about something he didn’t care about, until Weasley stopped and pointed at him saying to Potter, “Hey mate, your ferret’s back.” At this Potter’s face lit up, he looked over at Draco and swiftly walked over to sweep him up into his arms. Draco immediately snuggled into his embrace, reveling in the warmth. How was he always so warm? “He really likes you doesn’t he.” Weasley laughed.
When Harry woke up though, he was fully refreshed from his sleep and found himself to be quite hard. His prick pressing against Draco's lower back. He tried to ignore it at first as he didn't want to wake Draco, but eventually ignoring his predicament (preDICKament) was too hard (two dick jokes in a row - sorry) and he started to rock his hips into Draco, slowly but just enough to relieve some of the pressure. Harry also started to kiss Draco's neck. Draco started to stir and rock back against Harry, still half asleep but aware of the pleasure he felt from Harry's body pressing against him. This made Draco’s - already half hard - dick respond too.
“Sure you will.” Harry said and Draco turned around to smile winningly at Harry.
“For being such a good boyfriend.” Draco smiled.
“Right and what about you two?” Draco indicated to Dean and Seamus with a nod.
Class would be over by now and Harry would be either in his dorm room or with his friends. So Draco went to Harry’s room first. He knocked on the door, there was now answer. So Draco knocked again. When there was still no answer Draco started to walk in the direction of Ron's room but then the door opened. Draco turned around to see Harry with red-rimmed eyes. Harry had been crying. He'd been crying because he thought Draco had rejected him. So Draco did the only thing he could and walked over to Harry and wrapped his arms around the boy. Harry leaned into Draco and started sobbing into Draco’s shoulder. Draco walked them backwards into Harry's room, closing the door once both were inside. Draco was making little calming shushing noises and rubbing circles on Harry's back. Draco had started to get teary eyes too and said, “Merlin Harry I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I was just so shocked, but Harry,” Draco pulled Harry away from him to look him in the eye, “Harry, I like you too, Harry I like you too.” he pulled Harry back into the hug and Harry had started to cry from relief and happiness. Draco was laughing and hugging Harry as tightly as he could without hurting Harry.
“What call you my boyfriend?” Draco had stopped crying.
He explained how sorry he was for all he’d done over the years. Said that he realised the error in his ways and that he wanted to change, that he wanted to help Potter defeat the Dark Lord. While he explained this Potter nodded, not speaking, just letting Draco talk. Then he started to smile, no he started to grin.
“And you want this, don't you?” Draco motioned between them.
When Draco was back in his dorm he couldn't stop thinking about Potter, or Harry as Draco was now supposed to call him. That was one of the topics that came up, they were supposed to call each other by their first names. However, they avoided the topic of Draco’s wand. Though apart from that they managed to get along with each other and be somewhat friendly, which surprised Draco. But what surprised him the most was that he was smiling, that he had been pretty much the whole time walking back. Draco was happy for the first time since, well since before he became a death eater. Draco hoped that this would be good.
“No, just come back to bed.” Draco was hungry too but in a nauseated kind of way, so he didn't want to eat. He also knew that he would throw up again. He didn't want Harry to be there for that.
“OK, well…” Harry tried to say something else but he couldn't think of the right words.
“Just like a rough estimate.” Draco really wanted to know.
“Oh, well just be careful, ok?” Pansy looked at him, eyes wide and full of sincerity.
“That's the first time you've referred to me as your boyfriend.” Harry mused, “I like it, do it again.”
“Nah, Ron won't be up for another thirty minutes at the least. And I'd rather have breakfast with you today.” Harry added the last part a little shyly.
“Come here love.” Harry held his arms open for Draco to snuggle into.
Both boys startled awake when Harry's alarm went off, signalling that they had to get up. Harry reached behind him to turn it off and snuggled back into Draco, taking a deep breath, then saying, “C’mon it's time to get up, love.”
Draco opened his eyes, light was streaming in through a gap in the closed curtains, he felt warm arms wrapped around him. What? Draco had not gone to sleep in someone else’s bed, had he? He looked at the curtains again, RED, they were RED! No, he’d fallen asleep with Potter in the Gryffindor tower. Luckily Potter had had the foresight to close the curtains around the bed so no one else had seen him. The only problem was that he’d changed in the middle of the night, he was no longer a ferret. What if Potter had seen him, well he probably would have kicked him out, right? That didn’t matter right now. What did matter was Draco’s escape plan, he’d turn back into a ferret, check that everyone else was sleeping, turn back so he could open and close the door and turn back into a ferret to get back to his dorm. Simple plan, nothing that could go wrong.
“OK fine.” Draco said then dragged Harry towards the kitchens where they got food from the house elves and then dragged Harry out of Hogwarts and towards the lake. He conjured a picnic blanket then put the food and drinks on it, and as he sat down pulled Harry down with him. “So, this private enough for you?” Draco said in a way of explanation.
“Sure, now lie down, you need to rest.” Draco did what Harry said and Harry brushed Draco’s fringe out of his eyes.
“Well, ah, um, well, that-that was, I didn’t mean to.” Potter stuttered out.
There is smut in this chapter and I've never written smut before so sorry if it's really bad. Otherwise thanks for reading and enjoy.
That night, when the boys were changing out of their clothes and into T-shirts and boxers, Harry mentioned something that Draco had not realised; he had not been vomiting as much lately. Draco was surprised that something that significant could escape his notice. Though if it really was that significant he would have known. So does that mean that Draco's months of suffering were not as bad as he'd thought? Or perhaps it was more the fact that Draco's negative feelings that were making him vomit were replaced with positive feelings, feelings for Harry. Draco decided that it was most likely the latter, because when he snuggled into Harry's side, Harry's arm wrapped around him, he felt completely content and loved.
It wasn't hormones or anything like that that made Draco aroused by Harry, it was pure attraction, affection. Draco liked Harry. Harry probably thought that Draco hated him again now. He'd just run away. He'd been silent then he ran away. What was he thinking. Well he wasn't thinking. But now he was and he resolved to go tell Harry his discovery; He liked Harry too.
“I was thinking about,” Harry paused, he could lie or he could tell the truth the truth that could ruin their friendship, “about kissing someone.”
“Well I'm doing a pretty shitty job of that right now, then.” Draco spat.
“You don't know?” Draco was still fuming.
Draco wasn’t going to lie, he would have loved to take Potter up on his offer, but he really needed to get out of here. So, as soon as Potter’s back was turned he made a break for it. The door was left open by one of the others so Draco could slip through. He leaped down the stairs and out the portrait hole, left open by another careless Gryffindor. He ran as far and as fast as he could, slowing only once he got to the corridor that led to the Slytherin dorms. He checked to see if anyone was around, surprisingly no one was, and changed back.
Harry nodded, “Thank you, and I will keep my promise.”
“Yeh, I'm good, I just got lost in thought and you startled me out of it.” Harry explained, trying to be honest.
“Yes, yes go faster.” Harry pushed back in and pulled out increasing his speed with every thrust of his hips. Harry pulled Draco up towards him to get a better angle and started thrusting even faster. When Draco cried out Harry knew that he'd hit Draco’s prostate so he thrusted back in at the same angle to hit it again and again and again. He kept doing this until Draco gave one last cry and came between them. The combination of Draco's cum on his stomach and the way Draco's walls squeezed around him urged Harry over the edge and he came inside of Draco.
“Merlin, do my ears deceive me or did the famous Harry Potter just say ‘fuck’?” Draco was laughing too.
Though try as he might, Draco could not find sleep, so he slipped his hand under Harry's shirt and started drawing circles on his stomach. Draco half hopped this would wake Harry up but also that drawing the soothing patterns would help them both sleep.
“Well I guess there’s not much we can do about it now.” Harry shrugged resignedly.
Hogwarts was always Harry's home even though it was slightly ruined and charred it was home and he was relieved to be returning. Harry loved staying at the burrow with the weasley's but it had started to become awkward and he'd developed claustrophobia from having to stay there since the end of the war. Harry love the weasley's but Ginny still had romantic feelings for Harry and Harry just couldn't return those feelings, he'd wanted to but it just wasn't possible. If anything she was more like a sister now especially with molly being an overbearing mother to Harry and even worse with Fred dead molly was trying to -- or at least it seemed like she was -- replace fred with Harry. This only served to make Harry feel uncomfortable and like some kind of imposter.
“What the fuck are you babbling about Potter.”
“Don’t worry about it, as long as you’re OK with us, then I don’t mind.” Harry said, shoveling mash potato into his mouth.
Draco sat up and looked at him, “What do you mean, ‘no’?”
“I don't want breakfast I want you.” Draco whined.
“No, no stop! I take it back, I take it back. Get back in your chair you wanker.” Draco waved his hands around in an attempt to ward off Harry.
“Why is your face doing that?” Draco asked, motioning to Potter’s face, a disgusted look on his own.
As soon as he had made it to his room he closed and locked the door, sat on his bed and through one of the pillows across the room. He started to rock back and forth, pulling his knees to his chest wrapping his arms around his knees to keep them in place.
“Well I’m glad that you’ve found amusement in our relationship.” Harry said, smiling.
“No, I'm really not. I'm so fucking depressed and anxious and the only thing that's making everything bearable is you.” Harry kissed the top of Draco's head.
“Ah, what?” Draco felt like he was missing something.
“You've got a point there.” Draco smiled.
After a few more thrusts of his hips Harry pulled out and flopped down next to Draco. Draco groaned from the ache of his stretched hole as he rolled over to lie on Harry's chest. “Sorry, let me help with that.” Harry said as he reached for his wand. He cast a quick cleaning spell on himself and Draco then a simple healing spell to quell the pain Draco was feeling.
“Don’t worry, I’m always careful.”
“You would have carve your initials onto my wand?” Harry was laughing again, it seemed he never stopped laughing. Draco found himself liking Harry’s laugh now, rather than finding it irritating.
“Good then you can tell me who’s the lucky girl.”
