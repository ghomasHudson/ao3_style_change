They both laugh and the tension is gone. “It would have been nice, to have a girlfriend,” Neville says. “Maybe then Lavender and Parvati will leave us alone.”
When the show is over, the others move back into the house. Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads him further away from the house. He smiles and lets his free hand brush the leaves of some bushes they pass.
Neville points his wand at the map and mutters: “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Lines and figures start to appear on the parchment. Harry still doesn’t know how his dad, Sirius and Remus made the map. They won’t tell the secret. But he loves that James gave it to him when he first went to Hogwarts.
Draco looks at Harry when he steps back into the room. His face is puffy, and his eyes are red-rimmed. Harry looks at Draco as he bites onto his lip. He blinks and then moves to his side of the bed. Draco closes his eyes. Why did Harry say he had to leave? Draco tries to remember Harry’s words. He went on and on about that he couldn’t watch Draco destroy himself, that it would destroy him too. But how? Won’t it set Harry free to move on, to find that person that will be able to give him the family he deserves?
Draco lays in bed. He stares at the ceiling. A small tear tracks over his face, slowly making its way down to drop to the pillow below Draco’s head. Last year, on this day, he lost his baby. A whole year has passed, and nothing has changed. Draco is still not pregnant again. Draco wishes he knew what is wrong with him. The only thing he can think of that this is his punishment for all the wrongs he did during the war. All the lives he ruined in the name of blood purity and insanity. Why else would he still be childless? Hermione and Ron had forgotten protection once with New Years, and now Hermione is getting huge with the baby growing inside her. Pansy only needed a one night stand to get pregnant, the bitch. And she expects Draco to feel sorry for her. To tell her how horrible her life has become now that she needs to be responsible. Fuck her and her stupid stunts. Doesn’t she get that she has the one thing that Draco wants more than anything? Doesn’t she see that if Draco can’t get pregnant, he’s going to lose the love of his life?
The feast was amazing. The Mandrakes had matured so all the petrified people were there and Hermione had joined Draco and me at the Slytherin table. It was good to have her back and she was pleased to see that Draco and I were now boyfriends. Ron and Neville also joined us halfway through the feast. It was a bit awkward, seeing Ron and Hermione trying to be civil for my sake, but it was fun. Daphne was very interested in everything that had happened and Greg wanted a word by word account. And at the end of the feast, Hagrid walked into the Great Hall. I got up and ran towards him and hugged him, glad to have him back.
“Malfoy walked away,” Neville says. He waves his hand in the air without lifting his head. Harry tugs on his tie and then pretends to focus on what Binns is saying.
Draco looks to the side, out of the window. He watches as some leaves fall from the tree, as they slowly wave down and out of sight.
I told them I would use the invisibility cloak. Draco just nodded and then turned his eyes away from me and Hermione, probably trying to hide that he was close to tears. Hermione surprised me by saying she would come with me and that she would start going over her notes so we would be prepared for all the protection charms.  We agreed on a time to meet at the trapdoor and then Hermione was off.
I don’t know what happened to Aunt Marge after that, I ran out of the room towards the cupboard under the stairs. The door burst open before I reached it. I think I did that too with my magic. I took my trunk out of the cupboard and then raced upstairs to grab the pillowcase with my books, letters and birthday cards. I sprinted back down and placed the pillowcase in my trunk. At that moment Uncle Vernon came into the hallway and ordered me to come back and put her right. I don’t know why, but I wanted to hurt Uncle Vernon at that moment. I grabbed my wand and pointed it at him. For a couple of seconds, I wanted to jinx him, to hurt him and punish him like he used to punish me. And then I thought of Draco and how disappointed he would be if I wouldn’t show up at school because I was in jail. And I thought of you, knowing you wouldn’t want me to hurt anyone. So I just opened the door behind me and left without saying a word.
“I know,” Harry says. His knee pushes against Draco and then they are silent. A silence Draco would give everything to have right now. There are multiple Death Eaters in the house. And dinner is a noisy affair. Everyone wants to get in his or her idea on how to proceed, on how to take over the ministry and finish all those blood traitors. It isn’t until the Dark Lord raises his hand when the room goes silent.
“He was bleeding, Harry. And he still wouldn’t stop scratching. Ron was just trying to help. I think he said something in the line that all will be okay and Draco just snapped.”
Headmaster Dumbledore even came by today in the hospital wing. He came to apologise, said he hadn’t realised that we had finished the connection. It is in that moment that Sirius had raced into the hospital wing. He first checked if I was okay and then turned to shout at the Headmaster. He yelled that Dumbledore should have warned him, that he should have known that this task would affect me more severely than the others. He even muttered that he should have listened to Snape. He was shaking his head when he said that. I know Professor Snape and Sirius don’t get along and hearing Sirius say that professor Snape isn’t all bad was a big thing. It even made Draco laugh.
Harry turns to look at Malfoy next to him. Had Malfoy agreed to be held underwater for over an hour so Harry could come and rescue him? It’s insane. Why would he ever agree to something like that? Harry hasn’t missed the shouts of Malfoy’s friends when they saw Draco get out of the lake with Harry. He heard the hateful words just as well as Malfoy must-have. And still, he chose to do this voluntarily.
Harry shakes his head. “The greenhouses are too light. And how would he get there during the day? No, we need to figure out which student never makes it to Herbology to find out who the vampire is.”
Malfoy shakes his head and scribbles more words down. The note gets pushed back to Harry who takes it quickly. His fingers brush against Malfoy’s, causing his heart to speed up.
We didn’t take the Port-key with just us six. When we got at the location Cedric Diggory and his father were already there. Draco and I both agree that Cedric is extremely handsome. He’s about seventeen and is the captain and seeker of the Hufflepuff team. His father got all excited when he noticed that I was along everyone. He looked at my scar and it made me a little uncomfortable.  Draco squeezed my hand and it made me feel a little better. Until Cedric’s father looked at our locked hands like we were contagious. Cedric noticed and mouthed a sorry towards us.
Draco shakes his head. “He doesn’t like me. Can’t hear, can’t talk, can’t get good grades, can’t even fall for a nice pure-blood girl.”
“It’s not that hard,” Draco signs. Then he takes his quill and writes down: ‘You don’t have to screw up, just because you don’t want to please Professor Snape.’
The library seems miles away. Harry races around corners on his way there. Most of the corridors are empty, as almost everyone enjoys the nice weather outside. Which is a good thing. This way Harry doesn’t have to dodge too many people. He doesn’t slow down until he’s right in front of the door of the library. He rests his hands on his knees and takes a large breath. He can’t hear Neville’s footsteps in the distance, but there is no question that he’s on his way too. Only Harry can’t wait for him. Draco is in the library and in danger. Hopefully, he’s still unnoticed by Pettigrew. Safe and unaware of the danger he’s in. Does Pettigrew know about Harry’s feelings for Draco? Is that why he’s here? Does he plan to hurt Draco, just to get at Harry and Neville?
“I’m sorry too,” Narcissa says from somewhere behind Draco. Draco closes his eyes. He can’t have his mother here. He will break down if she stays. And then she will know the betrayal in Draco’s heart. It will put both of them in danger.
We started that day with Potions, and professor Snape made me sit next to Malfoy, in the hope I would learn some from a student that was more gifted in the art of Potions than me. He gave a lecture on how to prepare a potion to cure boils. Telling us to study it before our double lesson on Friday, where we would have to make one ourselves. Malfoy didn’t really pay attention to me. I think he really likes Potions and wants to do well in the class.
“Thank you,” Draco stutters. He bends his head again and waits for the Dark Lord to leave the room. When the door closes Draco picks up his wand and locks the door, casts some silencing spells and then cries until sleep takes him.
“I wanted Draco to be my Sirius,” Harry says. And he means it. When he looks at his uncles, he sees what he wants for himself. They are so happy together. Harry had hoped he could be that happy together with Draco, to marry him one day and grow old with him. And having that dream snatch away from him hurts. And nothing Harry can think of will make it less painful.
“Leftover from Teddy’s fall,” Draco answers. His voice sounds so hollow, as if it doesn’t matter. It sounds like the Draco from sixth year when he was high all the time and didn’t care what happened next. Harry lifts his head and looks at the man in front of him. His eyes stare past Harry, into the distance.
Harry stares at Malfoy, at his downturned head as he strives away from the lake. He’s right, Harry is acting like a coward. Just moments ago he was sitting next to Draco Malfoy, holding his pinkie like it was the most natural thing in the world. Harry wants to hold it again. And not just under a blanket. He wants the world to know that he’s fallen for Malfoy. It’s time he starts acting like a true Gryffindor. He stands up and runs after Malfoy.
Harry shakes his head. He knows that Iris will be fine. She’s an independent girl. And too smart for her own good. But this year is different. There is a real treat now. It’s not the same as first year when the enemy was close but unable to touch them. And it’s different from last year when the Basilisk terrorised the school. No, this year, Neville, Harry and Iris are the targets. The reason why the enemy is here. And no matter how smart or clever Iris is, she is an idiot when it comes to understanding the danger she’s in.
“But if it helps you get over Draco, then that is what will do,” Neville says. His features are soft and Harry just wants to hug him.
“Stop it,” Draco says. “Just stop, will you.” He sits down on the edge of the desk at the front of the classroom and looks down at his feed. “It’s not like it will change anything,” he whispers.
Draco was fine. Madam Pomfrey mended the cut in about a second and gave him some potion to calm down. Hagrid was really sorry and we told him not to worry about it. It was just an accident, we both know that Buckbeak didn’t mend to hurt us. Madam Pomfrey then told Hagrid to go and talk to the Headmaster and made sure Draco and I got some dinner before she sent us back to our own common room.
It’s still early morning and there is no rush. But still, Draco doesn’t think he can get out of bed. He knows he promised Lily that they would go to the park today. And maybe in some time, he will find a way to move without puking all over himself, but right now he just wants to lay still in his bed and not think about what it means that he’s sick for no reason.
The forest was dark and silent. We didn’t talk and kept our eyes on the ground and every now and then the moonlight would light up a spot of unicorn blood. While we were walking we could hear something slithering over dead leaves nearby. We stopped and I tried to spot whatever was making that noise. Draco looked at me with frightened eyes. After a few seconds, the sound faded and we started walking again, a little closer together and a little slower. I had the feeling we were being watched, it was really scary.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says again. A bit louder now and with more confidence. He’s genuinely sorry. “For all of it, the baby. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep him safe. I’m sorry I’ve destroyed our chance to be happy. You’ll be better off without me. You and Teddy both.”
Another thing I’ve been talking about with Miss Davis is Draco. I think he’s my boyfriend now. We never really said it out loud, but he’s always holding my hand and smiling at me. He makes me feel good about myself, stronger. But it still hurts what he did to me, ignoring me for so long. I know he had good reasons and that he didn’t want to hurt me, but he did. Miss Davis said it might be a good thing to tell him, to talk about it, but I don’t really want to. I don’t want to push him away or make him think I don’t like him.
Sometime later, Hermione calmed down a bit and we strolled around. And then we overheard a conversation between Hagrid and Madame Maxime. It turns out that Hagrid is half-giant and when he asked Madame Maxime if she was too, she got really angry. Draco later explained that it’s a shameful thing, being part creature. Just another thing the wizarding world is stupid and short-minded. And giants are also seen as vicious and violent creatures that like to kill. So we all agreed to keep Hagrid’s secret and not tell anyone else.
Dinner is a silent affair. Teddy looks between Draco and Harry and hardly eats any of his food. Just like Draco and Harry. Most of the food containers end up in the fridge for another day. Harry takes Teddy upstairs to get him ready for bed. Draco lets him. It’s easier that way. Draco shouldn’t be allowed to look after the boy at all. He should be in jail, locked away for life for his crimes. But no, the Saviour had given a good word for him during his trial, and Draco was let off with a year's probation at Hogwarts. And that was hardly a punishment, as it was the year he and Harry had fallen in love and Draco had started to believe that he could be happy.
They'd arrived at the party about an hour ago. Draco had sat down in one of the chairs and hasn't moved since. Harry looks at him from his place on the sofa. Ginny sit next to him, telling him all about the house hunt and how happy she's with this place. Harry nods in agreement. Not that he's paying attention to her words. He’s sure he won’t be able to recall anything Ginny says today.
And then everything got even worse. It seems that the Ministry thinks Hagrid had to do something with all the attacks and they have taken him to Azkaban. Headmaster Dumbledore told the Minister that taking Hagrid won’t do any good, but the minister said he had to act, that he had to be seen to be doing something and if it turns out that it wasn’t Hagrid that he would be released and no more said. I couldn’t believe my ears. First Hermione, and now I would lose Hagrid as well. Tears had started again and I tried to crawl away underneath the blanket Hagrid had pulled over my legs when we first had arrived at his house.
You remember me telling you that Malfoy and Nott had started using jinxes on me, like the tripping jinx and the leg-locker curse. Well, Malfoy stopped that after our fight at the Quidditch game, but Nott only tried harder to get me to trip or fall over because my legs would get locked together. And when nobody else was around he would give me a good kick before he would move on. Until it became more than just making me trip. One evening I was walking from the library to the dungeon and Nott, Crabbe and Goyle were waiting for me in an empty hallway. They locked my legs together and pulled me into an empty classroom. There they released me, stole my wand from me and started using the knockback jinx on me, making me fall back all the time. They just laughed while I was falling into tables and chairs and onto the floor. It really hurt and I begged them to stop. Only they didn’t, they just kept going. I tried getting up all the time to make a run for the door, but they were firing the curse in turns, so I was knocked down before I could even start running.
After our free period, we had a double lesson of potions and everyone kept staring at me. At a certain moment, Professor Snape asked us what was going on. Blaise told him we had Divination this morning and that w were reading tea leaves. Professor Snape interrupted Blaise and asked us who would be dying this year. Draco looked at him and said my name, his voice sounded so scared I couldn’t not grab his hand under the table. And for ones Professor Snape didn’t say a word about it. And then he explained that Professor Trelawney predicts the death of one student a year since she arrived at the school and that none of them has died yet so that there was nothing to worry about. I really hope he’s right. I don’t want to die. Not now when life is just getting better and better.
Harry takes the glass and stares at the liquid inside it. James sits down on the small garden bench beside Harry. Harry’s mind races. He isn’t sure how he should answer his father’s question. Harry loves being home and spending time with his family. But he can’t get Draco out of his mind and his heart keeps aching. It’s as if Harry can’t enjoy anything anymore now that Draco has rejected him.
Granger doesn’t seem to agree and Draco kind of agrees with her. If Potter hasn’t figured out what he has to do tomorrow, then he’s going to need the help of his smart-ass Mudblood.
The last trial we saw was for four people. When they were brought in Draco told me the woman was his aunt, his mother’s sister. And that one of the men was her husband. They were sentenced for torturing Frank Longbottom and his wife. Draco and I looked at each other and mentioned Neville at the same time. He was raised by his grandmother because of what Draco’s aunt did to his parents. Draco feels bad about this, I know. He says it’s fine, but he started to be kinder to Neville ever since we saw the memory of his aunt’s trail.
It has been two weeks. People don’t stare at Harry anymore. Some of them ignore him now that it’s public knowledge that he fancies boys. Harry hates it that people can change their minds about him so quickly. But otherwise, he’s fine. He goes to his classes, he’s still on the Quidditch team and he hangs out with his friends. It’s all normal. Except for the fact that Draco doesn’t join him anymore. The first class they shared was difficult. Harry wanted to sit down next to Draco and have it be as always. It was Hermione who took Harry by the arm and pushed him into a seat next to her.
Draco swallows. Two red eyes bore into his mind. Draco strengthens his shield and keeps the Dark Lord out. Draco won’t show him any of the secrets Harry entrusted him with. The Dark Lord won’t see the love that Draco experienced. He won’t taint the only good thing Draco ever knew. It is bad enough that his childhood home is ruined forever, all his happy memories of growing up tainted by the Dark Lord.
After the lessons, I went to the library to start on my homework. But Malfoy and his bodyguards Crabbe and Goyle had followed me. Crabbe stole my bag and turned it around, so all the books fell out. And then Malfoy said that this is just the beginning. They left after that and I had to pick up all my stuff. One of my quills got broken and my Standard Book of Spells is damage from the fall from my bag. I’m glad they left, so I could finish my homework in peace.
“He’s right, Neville,” Harry says. “We have to be careful. You don’t realise how awful it feels when they are close. For a second, I thought it would be better if I was dead because life was just going to be horrible from now on. It still freaks me out that I could think that.” Harry shudders and Remus hands him another bar of chocolate.
Neville and Harry looked for a spot to hide yesterday on their way to Hogsmeade. They didn’t find anything at all. Hermione and Ron didn’t help. Hermione thinks the whole idea of tracking down Pettigrew is insane. And Ron wants to stay on her good side, so he agrees with her. If he wasn’t so head over heels for Hermione, he would have helped. Ron always loves a good adventure.
“Maybe. But you can still talk to him,” Remus says. “We haven’t done anything yet. And I can wait until you have discussed it with Malfoy before I talk to professor Flitwick, if you want.”
The steak on Draco’s plate loses focus the longer Draco stares at it. He won’t only be responsible for Harry’s death. He will also carry the burden of the death of his mother. It’s unbearable. Draco doesn’t know how to continue. He can’t do this. Not without Harry by his side. Draco thinks of Harry’s smile. Of all the times Harry was able to see the positive in all. And then Harry’s final words ring in Draco’s mind. “Just remember that there’s always hope, and that I’ll always love you.”
“Love you too, Hermione,” Harry says. He sits down and starts to dish up his breakfast. It isn’t long before Ron and Neville join them.
I stayed at Hogwarts during the holidays. I didn’t feel like going back to Privet Drive, knowing I wouldn’t get any of the food anyway. And Ron and his brothers also stayed, so that was fun. Their mom and dad went to visit his brother Charlie in Romania.
“Wish I could make it better,” Neville says. “Draco was a fool for leading you on like that, and we all won’t talk to him ever again.”
“Tomorrow I will honour you,” the Dark Lord says. “You will join our ranks and set an example for the others, the ones that are too great a cowards to act.”
Dinner is strange. Harry can’t help it. It’s because Draco is in his home. All the normal dynamics have changed, but are also still the same. Remus still leans against Sirius when Lily brings in dessert and he says he shouldn’t have any. Neville and Iris still fight about who gets the last couple of vegetables, as the crazy herbivores they are. James still wants all the ins and outs about the Quidditch matches from the last two months. Only Harry struggles to stay on topic. His eyes drift to Draco who sits in his seat, straight up and with his napkin on his lap. He uses his utensils with care and even eats the potatoes he normally skips at Hogwarts.
"Maybe we should stop with the tests, " Harry says after some time. Draco doesn’t want to hear this. He doesn’t want to know that Harry is giving up.
It’s not that this hasn’t crossed Harry’s mind. He’s heard the stories about Uncle Sirius’ upbringing and how he was kicked out when he told his parents he was gay. But Draco wouldn’t have pushed Harry away the way he did. There is no way he could have looked that horrified when he feels the same. Harry is sure of this. Draco doesn’t want Harry in the way Harry wants him. And there is nothing that Harry can do to change that.
My whole body was in pain and I just couldn’t move anymore. Goyle left then, saying I would have sure learned my lesson by now. But Nott and Crabbe stayed. They walked up to me and started kicking me, first in my stomach and at my back. And after a while I felt Nott’s feet hit my head, breaking my glasses. The glass got stuck in my eye and I screamed from the pain. I passed out after the second kick against my head. I don’t know how long they continued after that. I only know that I woke up hours later in the hospital wing with a bandage on my eye and in a lot of pain.
“Yes, I believe there are,” Remus says. “Professor Flitwick would know. He mentioned he was looking into it. And he’s a smart man. I’ll talk with him.”
“He’s alive,” Harry signs. Only Draco doesn’t seem to see it. Harry stands up and takes a step towards Draco. A hand grabs his arm and Harry is spun around. Remus is pale and his eyes are large when Harry looks at them.
Draco walks up the stairs of the castle, the route he’s taken so many times in the last couple of weeks. He doesn’t stop until he reaches the place where he first ran into Harry at the beginning of the school year, where they shared heated words until Harry broke down in front of Draco when he mentioned Cedric. Harry had cried and Draco had sat next to him without saying a word.
Voldemort went by the circle, mentioned names of people missing, and mentioned names of the people there. I hated knowing that my friends' fathers were among them. Greg and Milicent will be so ashamed knowing their fathers are back in the service of Voldemort. Nott and Greg’s fathers were also present. I’m sure they will like that, even brag about it when it comes to it.
Harry runs his hand through his hair as he reads Malfoy’s words. Does he truly want to give up before he even starts? That is just stupid.
“Don’t be so surprised, Mr Potter,” Mrs Prince says. “Mr Malfoy has been in this library almost daily for the last two years. It didn’t take long before I realised he can’t hear it when I speak to him. He never complains that I found another way to tell him it’s closing time.”
“You don’t know that,” Hermione says as she opens the door in front of her. Harry shakes his head as he takes hold of the door and Hermione walks quickly through the small hallway between the carriages. Ron and Neville follow her before Harry rushes after them.
All of this confused Blaise at first, because he didn’t know about it all, so we filled him in and he agreed with Ron and Neville. He also didn’t see why Snape would steal it. So Draco told him about Voldemort being in the forest and that Snape was one of his followers, a death eater, just like Draco’s dad.
“I know,” Harry says. He looks at his hand held by his father’s. “It’s something I’ve known for a while now. I just never said it out loud.”
I didn’t really know what to do, should I wait or get out of there? But Filch would remember he was going to request for a detention for me when he would see the half-completed form, so I decided to stay and wait. I looked over the desk and found a letter from Kwikspell, a correspondence course in beginners’ magic. And I know I shouldn’t have, but I was curious, so I pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside and read some of it. When Filch returned I quickly place all the parchment back into the envelope and place it back on the desk. But it wasn’t back where I found it and Filch was afraid I had read it. I said I hadn’t. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t lie, but I didn’t want the change even more detentions, not if professor Lockhart would volunteer again to give them to me. Only Filch was so upset about it that he told me to leave and I didn’t get any detention at all.
On my way out of the castle, I couldn’t stop thinking about how Professor Snape had said that all was okay, that there was nothing to worry about. I got so angry, I wanted to hurt Snape. He lied to me. Nothing was right. All was wrong. Once I left the castle behind me I ran towards the lake, spotted Snape and confronted him. I screamed some horrible things at him. I think Snape tried to calm me down, to tell me it really was okay, but I didn’t hear a word of what he said.
Harry walks into the kitchen to get breakfast started. He takes out the frying pan and a bowl to mix the batter. He looks back into the living room. Teddy is still on the floor playing with his new Duplo. Draco has moved to the sofa. He's got his book in front of him, but it doesn't look like he's reading. His finger scratches over his forearm again. Harry wonders if Draco is aware of it when he does it. Or if it's so familiar for him now that he doesn't notice anymore. Not like Harry, who sees it all the time. Just like how he noticed that Draco ignores his friend's messages, skips days at work and spends most of his free time in bed, no matter how hard Draco tries to hide it from him.
“Pansy, it’s only half-past six. His bedtime isn’t until seven,” Draco tells her. He picks up his glass of wine and grins. “What stupid thing did you do?” he asks Pansy.
I’m crying now. I haven’t cried in a long time. But being here, all alone at Privet Drive, not having my friends nearby to talk to, it makes me sad.
After the game, I went to have some tea with Hagrid. Hermione, Ron and Neville joined me. Somehow we came on the topic of professor Snape and Ron, Neville and I all agreed that he was evil. Hagrid said that was rubbish. And then I told him that we knew that Snape had tried to get past the three-headed dog and that he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding. Hagrid defended the dog right away, it’s his and its name is Fluffy. Really, it’s Fluffy. I don’t know what’s cute or fluffy about that dog, but Hagrid seems to think it’s a lovely animal. I tried to find out what the dog is guarding, but Hagrid wouldn’t say. It was top secret, we should forget about it, about the dog and what it’s guarding, because that’s between Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel. Hagrid was a bit upset that he let that slip, but it gives us something to look into.
That same day I also got my hands again on my Firebolt. Professor Snape told us that there was nothing wrong with it at all and that I have a very good friend somewhere. I couldn’t believe it when it was in my hands again. Draco was stroking the twigs at the end, just as in awe as me. We took it down into our common room. The moment I stepped inside I was flooded by people wanting to see my Firebolt. Marcus asked if he could just touch it, to know that it’s really real. Adrian was sure we would win from Ravenclaw now with no problem since they are all on Cleansweep Sevens. It took forever, with the Firebolt being passed around and admired from every angle by the crowd before Draco and I could get to our dormitory.
When we told Hermione about the Firebolt she agreed with Professor Snape, saying my safety was more important than a broom. Draco called her a heathen after that. He’s angry at her because of it, so we are spending a little less time with her. She’s still in our little study group, but I haven’t spent time with her outside of that. Daphne told me to stop being stupid, that she’s my best friend and that she’s just looking out for me and that I would do the same for her. I know she’s right, so I send Hermione a message to ask her if she wants to hang out this coming Sunday, just the two of us, to catch up and hear about her Christmas holiday with her parents.
I stopped walking when the water reached my middle. The water was cold and I wanted it to swallow me. I looked at the Gillyweed in my hand and wondered if I should take it or not. I could just dive down and never come back up? Or I could take it, swim as far down as I could and wait there until the Gillyweed would stop working. That way nobody would be able to stop me and I could be with Draco again.
Harry slumps down on a rock and looks at the dark trees. Time goes by slowly. After some time, Neville sits down next to him.
And I’m sure you will also be glad to hear that I’m not in trouble for all that happened with Aunt Marge. I’m not getting expelled or have to go to jail. The day after I ran away, an owl from the Ministry came to Malfoy Manor. The Minister had written it personally to tell me that they had dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Aunt Marge. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad had punctured her and modified her memory. It also said I could go back to live with my Aunt and Uncle next summer, as long as I stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter holiday. Not that I ever go back for those holidays, but who cares. I’ll have to go back next year. Even Mrs Tonks says it is better for me to stay with family. Right now I don’t really care, I’m not expelled and I have three Dursley-free weeks before school starts.
I ate dinner that night again with the Gryffindor’s and Hermione stayed in the great hall with me until curfew. She’s been doing that a lot, knowing I don’t really want to go down to the dungeons. And with Gryffindor beating Slytherin in the Quidditch game I was sure I was going to get a beating that night. So I dragged myself to the Slytherin common room as slowly as possible. Nott, Goyle and Crabbe were already waiting for me in our dormitory. Zabini was nowhere to be seen and Malfoy left the room as soon as I came in. He looked worried, or scared, I don’t know really. It’s just, even though he still makes fun of me when everyone is around and everything, he seems to be less willing to be part of the beatings I’m getting.
The notebook. Draco’s notebook. I looked at where Riddle was nodding towards and I could see the little diary Draco had been writing in all year. About his fears and heartbreak. He had told me. And now Riddle was telling me that he had charmed Draco into trusting him, that it had been boring to listen to the silly little troubles of a twelve-year-old boy. But he had written back, had been sympathetic and kind, making Draco pour his soul into the diary, so Riddle could grow stronger. So strong that he became more powerful than Draco, and started pouring his soul into him. Riddle had made Draco open up the chamber of Secrets, had him strangle the roosters and had him write threatening messages on the walls.
Harry looks up and watches as Malfoy blinks with his eyes, over and over again. He might be on the brink of tears. Harry can’t have that. He swallows deep and then grabs another piece of parchment. He needs to explain. He knows he screwed up and that he upset Malfoy. Malfoy’s going to leave and Harry will never be able to do his homework sitting next to him again. He has to stop Malfoy. He needs to get him to hear Harry out. Malfoy needs to understand that nothing happened yet. So, Harry takes his quill and starts to write as quick as he can.
“Thank you for coming today. I know we were supposed to look after Teddy this weekend,” Harry starts.
Nott and Crabbe had to say so stupid things before the match, asked me if the new broom came with a parachute, just in case the Dementors come near me. Draco told them to shut their mouth and pulled out his wand. Adrian and Miles also took out their wants and said it would be fun to hex them back into the dungeons. I’ve heard that Nott wanted to try out for the team this year for the seeker position and was that he’s been angry about me getting the spot without any try-outs.
Draco is glad for the out. He can’t go and see Pansy and her new baby boy. She’s better off without him anyway. The only thing Draco is good for is hurting others. First by choice, and now because it’s all he’s good for. If only Harry could see that. He should leave and take Teddy with him. Draco will only be able to damage their boy. And Teddy will hate him for it in the end, Draco is sure of it.
“It might. Maybe there is a simple cause to why we are struggling. And if they can find that and fix it. Isn’t it worth a shot?”
And now there is a young boy that will forever remind Draco of how he wasn’t able to save one of his friends.
And I didn’t really have the strength to do so after the final curse that Moody showed us. The last and worst, Avada Kedavra, the Killing Curse, was performed right in front of us. There was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound. Instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but dead. I just looked at the spider, remembering the green lights in my nightmares, the screams of you mother to plead for my life. I heard that Moody said that I was the only one to ever survive it and Draco took my hand in his, made me unclench my fists and stroked his thumb over my hand. I was aware that everyone had turned around to look at me, but all I could think about was that this is how you died. Had you been unmarked too? Was all you had seen a flash of green light and did you only hear a rush of speeding death before all life was wiped from your bodies?
“But what I wanted to say is that you can’t make him want you,” James continues. “You’ll have to respect his wishes, no matter how much it hurts to let him go.”
I’m back home now, as it’s the summer holiday. I can’t remember much of the last couple of days at school. I know Draco never left my side and made sure I was okay. For the first time, he didn’t care about his grades at all. I was the only thing on his mind. And it wasn’t like he was going home to his father, who would be disappointed in him if he knew that Draco didn’t become top of the class in any of his subjects (Hermione bead him in most, and Divination was rubbish anyway according to Draco).
“Fuck no, I don’t want to start my new year at the place that scarred me for life,” Draco says. He hands some glasses to Ron, takes one for himself and pulls a bottle out of Hermione’s hand. He walks out of the kitchen and back to the living room where the rest of the party is booming.
When Draco closes the hospital door behind him, Harry’s head starts to hurt again. He’d forgotten all about it when he was alone with Draco. Harry pushes his hand against his head and then turns to his dad.
On Wednesday, the day before our flying lesson I talked about it with Hermione. We still are spending every afternoon together in the library, doing our homework. She’s the only person talking to me. I’ve been afraid to spend more time with most of the Gryffindor’s because I’m afraid Nott will hurt me. I think Ron is disappointed that I’m ignoring him, but I don’t want him to get hurt because of me. And when Nott or Malfoy make fun of me in class, he laughs just like the others. So, I’m also not sure if he would be a good friend to me. Hermione is the only one that won’t laugh. She just looks very angry every time something happens.
I miss Hogwarts. It’s like I have a constant stomach-ache, that’s how much I miss it. I miss the castle, the secret passageways and ghosts, the classes, the mail arriving by owl. Hedwig is locked up in her cage and she keeps waking uncle Vernon in the early morning because she’s bored and makes loud hooting noises. We have an argument about it almost every morning. And yesterday on my birthday I accidentally said ‘you’ve forgotten the magic word’ when Dudley told me to pass the frying pan and the room exploded. Dudley fell off his chair, aunt Petunia screamed and uncle Vernon jumped to his feet and roared at me, telling me the M word was forbidden and that I shouldn’t threaten Dudley. But all I meant was please. I just wanted Dudley to say please.
“I’ll be back in about an hour. I can bring home some Indian take-out. Maybe watch a movie and make it a romantic night,” Harry says.
“Sure,” Harry agrees. They walk down the stairs in silence and start a track towards the Whomping Willow. It reminds Harry of the upcoming full moon. Remus will be off sick for a couple of days next week.
Draco raises his eyebrows. Does he mean Sirius Black? And why is he important? Harry told Draco about his godfather, during one of their nights alone on the Astronomy tower.
And it isn’t just Draco’s father that was upset by the picture and the story that went with it. No, you won’t believe the amount of hate mail we’ve both received. Most of it was for Draco, saying how he dragged their precious ‘Boy who lived’ down into the mud, and stuff like that. In the end, we made it into a game with all our friends to find the worst insults. Greg was good at reading them out loud and making it sound like serious letters. And Luna made them all sound like love letters instead of hate mail. We had a fun afternoon going through them all. But the best were the few letters of people supporting us and telling us that we should hold on to our love and not let the world get us down.
Headmaster Dumbledore told us a bit about the Pensive, but it wasn’t any new information that Draco hadn’t told me already. And then he asked me why Professor Snape had brought us to his office. I told him about the dream, with Wormtail and Voldemort. And that it hurt my scar when Voldemort tortured Wormtail.
“I’m sorry, I was just thinking. I should try to forget about Malfoy. It’s never going to happen anyway. No need to upset Ron about it too. He won’t understand, Hermione,” Harry says.
“I know, sweetheart. I’ve already called healer Burke. She said she would send over prescriptions for your birth control potion.”
“Sure, no problem,” Ron answers. He closes the bathroom door and is gone by the time Harry and Draco leave the shower to go and eat the fish and chips. Draco takes small bites in between the cramps that paralyse him. He doesn’t finish all, but it’s nice to have a little food inside his body.
For days Draco expected it to happen again. He fears that one day it would be too much, that his mother’s body wouldn’t be able to take any more and that she would pass on. Taking the punishment Draco deserves.
Neville shakes his head. He regrets saying it now. Harry doesn’t need to look at him to know this. Neville never wants to talk about what happened. How a dear friend of his parents, one of James’ best friends betrayed them all. Harry is still grateful that Sirius was the secret keeper of his parents’ hiding place. The world could have been so different if they had switched secret keepers. Then Harry would be the orphan. And Neville would still have his parents. Would they have taken Harry in? Raised him as their own? Probably, but still. It’s different, knowing your real parents are dead and gone because of the betrayal of a friend.
“Yeah,” Justin shouts. “I think he used a Body-Bind Curse. They were waving their hands around and then Longbottom turned and tried to run away. But his entire body froze and he tripped forwards. I think his nose might be broken, but otherwise, he seems okay.”
Hermione has been reading a lot the last two weeks. She feels stupid that she didn’t bring her copy of Hogwarts, A History, because all the copies of the library had been taken out by other students. She wants to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. She even asked about it in our History of Magic class last Wednesday. It was a nice distraction during the boring class. Professor Binns just talks in his flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class is in a deep stupor. It was my favourite class at the end of last year because it was the one where Draco would play with my hand all class. And now the only thing I can do is daydream about how amazing that felt and how much I want it back. But he’s sitting with Pansy now. I think they are dating. That’s what everyone has been saying at least.
So, it the end of January now, and I have finally figured out the secret of the egg. And all thanks to some help of Cedric and Myrtle. Who wasn’t pleased that I never come to visit her anymore, which I kind of feel bad about, because she had been a good friend to me in my second year. Draco says a good friend doesn’t help you try to commit suicide, but I don’t think he fully understands how lonely I was back then and that if Myrtle hadn’t been there I might have tried even sooner. Which now makes Draco say that would have been better because me almost dying made him realise his love for me was more important than his father's approval. But you know, maybe he should have figured that out without me almost dying, so he has no grounds to complain about my friendship with Myrtle.
“Our little one can still be alive?” Draco asks. He looks up at the healer, a little spark of hope forming in his heart.
"He's not using again, is he?" Blaise asks. Harry looks up at him. He didn't notice Blaise move towards them, or even re-enter the room.
“I know it’s none of my business, but shouldn’t that boy be in bed by now?” Pansy asks. She nods her head towards the other side of the room where Teddy sits with his tong halfway out of his mouth, a crayon in his hand and his favourite colouring book of the moment in front of him.
Harry looks up to spot his sister between the group of first years. Iris looks at Harry and Neville and waves. Not long now and she will join their table. She has to. Harry needs to keep his family close so he can make sure they are all okay. At least until Pettigrew is apprehended. Until then it isn’t safe for any of them.
“Isn’t that what people do when they can’t have the person they want?” Harry asks. “Go and kiss someone else until they don’t think about the person they’re missing.”
“Draco, dear,” his mother says. Draco looks up and spots his mother. She doesn’t smile. She doesn’t seem proud. Does she know the truth? Has she figured out that Draco doesn’t want this? That he wanted none of this. He’d made a choice, only to lose that option hours later. And now he’s here, having to choose between dead or a life in the service of a man he hates. Dead sounds better, if it was only his own death. The Dark Lord has a temper. If Draco defies him now, his mother and father will also die. And Draco knows it won’t be painless. The Dark Lord likes to torture his victims if he gets the chance. Draco has no choice. He raises his arm and lays it in the Dark Lord’s waiting hand. He will do this to save his mother. Harry will understand. He would have done the same if it had been his mother’s life on the line.
Neville doesn’t say anything else. He turns around in his bed and falls asleep again. Harry lays down in his bed, but sleep doesn’t find him. His mind keeps drifting back to his nightmare and his heart aches.
“No, I don’t,” Neville says. His hands sign along with his words out of habit. “But that doesn’t change the fact that the little rat escaped Azkaban. The place is supposed to be the best we have, and still, Pettigrew got out.”
“I know,” Harry says. He feels like it’s all he’s been saying today. He knows it all. That still doesn’t make him want to face it and go out into the world.
“Yes, I do,” Harry says. “I have the hots for Draco Malfoy. You’re happy now?” he snaps. Harry drops his head backwards and looks at the sky. Some clouds have hidden the sun that was shining this morning. It’s a shame. Draco’s hair always lights up so beautifully in the sunlight.
Harry doesn’t hear what Ron says in response. His ears are ringing as the words of Hermione plant themselves in his brain. There is no way Malfoy hasn’t heard them, just like everyone around. Tomorrow it will be in the papers how the ‘boy who lived’ has the hots for his nemesis, the Malfoy heir. Tomorrow the entire wizarding world will know he’s gay.
When I left the platform Uncle Vernon, who is still purple-faced with that ugly moustache of his, was waiting for me, with a terrified-looking aunt Petunia and Dudley standing behind him. They hurried me out of the station and we drove back home. As soon as we got home, uncle Vernon locked all my schoolbooks, my wand, robes, cauldron and all other school supplies in the cupboard under the stairs. I have no idea how I’m going to make my homework this way.
Someone is pulling on Harry’s sleeve. He must have fallen asleep last night. He slowly opens his eyes to see Dobby standing bend over him.
Even at top speed, it seems as if the castle is still miles away. Harry pushes forward. He breathes loudly as his legs take step after step. As quickly as he can he makes his way back. He bursts through the door and looks around. He’s got no clue which way is to the Hufflepuff common room. It’s not the same way as the Slytherin dungeons. Whenever Harry walks with Draco to his common room, he’s never seen any Hufflepuffs. So it must be the other way? Down the stairs to the right, instead of left? But what if Harry is wrong? What if he goes the wrong way and doesn’t find Neville in time? Neville could die.
Hermione wanted to talk to us about Rita Seeker. She had figured out how she got around the school and knew so much about everything. It turns out that Rita is an unregistered Animagus and can turn into a beetle. And Hermione had her captured in a jar. Hermione set her free when we got to London. She made Rita promise not to write another story for an entire year. If she does, Hermione will spill the beans on Rita.
“Draco, my friend,” Adrian says. He places his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Congrats on winning us the game and eliminating Potter at the same time. Using Quidditch as an excuse, it’s perfect. The school will be better off without him.”
“Since he drooled all over Digory last year during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff,” Ginny says.
“I’ll come with you.” Harry puts his arm around Draco’s waist and helps him stand up. Together they walk to the dressing room. Harry hands Draco his pants. On autopilot, Draco puts one leg into it and then the other. His trousers are next. Draco holds them in his hands and stares at it. He’d been afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find any nice trousers when his stomach became too large.
“Oh, that’s okay, Molly. I was wondering if you had made any lemonade. I would love two glasses if so,” Draco says.
After that, we were escorted back to our dormitories. We had lost a hundred and twenty points for Slytherin that night. And Gryffindor was already leading because they had been winning with Quidditch. Because of me, Slytherin was now in the last place. Nott went to his bed without saying a word, but I was sure he would also blame it all on me. And Draco was hiding in his bed. I didn’t sleep all night. I could hear Draco sobbing into his pillow for hours. I didn’t know what to say to comfort him, how sorry I was that he had gotten into trouble because of me.
When Harry was eleven and went to Hogwarts for the first time his uncle Sirius told him about the legend. Harry had thought it was silly. How could a boy repeat seventh year over and over again without anyone noticing? By the time he started third year it made more sense. Hogwarts was a weird place where strange things happened. And during the TriWizard tournament of fourth year, he learnt that students could die when not careful. And how quickly everyone around him forgot about poor Cedric who had used potions to try to win, only to be found dead in the maze after Viktor Krum had secured the victory. And now that he’s started seventh year he wonders who it could be, the student that has turned into a vampire and secretly feeds on seventh years without anyone noticing. He’s sure all his dorm mates have always been there. His best friend Ron, the combustible Seamus, creative Dean and the little awkward Nevile. He has memories off all of them through the years.
Harry walks into the bathroom and moments later glass shatters. Heavy sobs travel into the room, and Draco doesn’t understand. Why is Harry so heartbroken about leaving? He’s been pulling away for months, distancing himself from Draco, looking for another person that will be able to give him the child he wants. But Harry said he didn’t want a child without Draco, didn’t he? Then why did he stop wanting to have sex? Why is he packing his things now?
Who’s Harry kidding? He turns in his seat and looks at Malfoy. He’s reading his book again, not paying attention to anyone around him. Harry shakes his head and looks back at Binns.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Harry shouts back. “And I’m looking. I can’t help it that Malfoy’s hair has the same shine as the Snitch.”
Harry can only nod. He knows how his dad thinks about people from Slytherin. The same way his Uncle Sirius thinks about them. They both agree that only bad people come from that house. Mum and Uncle Remus always tell them they shouldn’t be so judgemental, but that hasn’t changed a thing. His dad will never see anyone from Slytherin as a decent human being. But he’s wrong. Draco is good, and kind, and sweet, and beautiful.
Harry nods his head and looks at Teddy. “He will be an amazing big brother,” he says before he takes a bite of his grilled sandwich. Draco smiles at him and agrees before he starts on his sandwich.
Don’t get mad, but I’ve gotten myself in trouble and have to serve detention sometime soon. I promise it was for a good reason. We had to save Hagrid’s dragon, but we got caught by Professor McGonagall.
“Just because we figured out that he’s deaf, doesn’t mean we have to become his friend,” Neville says. Harry opens his mouth to respond but Neville is quicker. “Who am I kidding? You wouldn’t be Harry Potter if you would let this go.”
Other students enter the Entrance Hall, and one of them runs into Harry. “Sorry,” the boy shouts as he moves towards the Hufflepuff common room. It shakes Harry into action. He waves at Draco and then walks up the stairs. When he’s halfway up to the first floor he turns and watches as Draco makes it down the stairs. It hurts watching him go. “Fuck,” Harry mutters and then he continues his tread to Gryffindor tower.
Not long after that, we were reunited with the Weasleys and we went into Gringotts to get money to buy school supplies. Fred and George wanted to know all about Knockturn Alley, saying their parents never let them go there. Mr Weasley fixed my glasses by the way with a simple spell. I should ask him about that tomorrow, I’m sure it will come in handy this coming school year. I told Hermione I had seen Draco and his father in Borgin and Burkes, but couldn’t continue because Mr Weasley asked if Lucius Malfoy bought anything. When I told him he was selling, Mr Weasley sported a familiar grim and was saying that he’d love to get Mr Malfoy for something. Mrs Weasley responded in a sharp tone that he should be careful, that the Malfoy family’s trouble. They almost started arguing inside the bank, but Mr Weasley noticed that Hermione’s parents are muggles and he got distracted because of that.
Hermione puffs. “Please God, help us,” she says. “The Potter brothers are going to get themselves killed.”
Malfoy still doesn’t show up to the DADA lessons. Harry worries that Malfoy might fail this year if he keeps away for too long. So, after classes end on Wednesday, Harry goes to Remus’ office to ask for his help.
Harry closes his eyes as he pictures Draco cutting stems in at the kitchen counter, placing the flowers with care into the vase. Harry had watched him do that a million times and it never bored him. It was one of their routines that helped Harry to stay calm, to forget all the horrors they had gone through.
People stare at Harry as he walks through the common room. Whispers follow him when he makes his way down to the Great Hall. Heads turn when he sits down next to his friends. Harry ignores them and grabs some sausages and toast. With dread, he looks towards the Slytherin table.
Hermione puts the paper down. “I might not have grown up with it,” she says. “But I do know what that man did to your family.”
The practical for potions was the hardest because we all had to make a potion by ourselves, with no help from our usual partners. Professor Snape kept breathing down my neck while I tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness Potion. Draco was working on the table next to me and he kept giving me reassuring looks. I know he was acing his practical. I tried really hard to remember all the tips he had given me, but I’m not sure if my potion came out any good.
The headmaster explained the effect to Sirius, mentioning that one of the wands would force the other to regurgitate spells it had performed. And then he looked at me and said that some kind of form of Cedric most have appeared. I confirmed and said that there were more, an old man, and Bertha, and them mom and dad. When I said that, Sirius and Lupin linked their hands, and I could see the tears stuck in Sirius his eyes.
“Well, it started with the robe fabric. Do you remember telling us about the first time you’ve gotten your robes?” she asks.
Myrtle wanted to know why I wasn’t dead and I told her we would discuss that some other time. She got upset about that and snapped at me ‘Than what do you want this time’. I asked her where she had seen the pair of great, big, yellow eyes when she died. Myrtle pointed vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet and Ron and I hurried over to it to investigate. It looked like an ordinary sink; the only thing standing out was a tiny snake on one of the copper taps. Myrtle said the tap has never worked when I turned it. Ron suggested saying something in Parseltongue. I didn’t know if I could since I only managed to do it when faced with a real snake and I’ve never tried otherwise. But after a couple of tries, I managed to say ‘Open up’ in Parseltongue.
They fall silent. It’s twisted. But isn’t it the same as what Harry did? Draco never gave any sign of being gay, and still, Harry hit on him. Tried to kiss him even. Of course, Draco doesn’t want to have anything to do with Harry anymore. Just as Harry doesn’t want to hang out with Lavender and Parvati. He’s been such a fool. It all makes sense now. If only it would hurt less now that it does. But the pain in Harry’s heart doesn’t seem to go away. Or leave him alone. It’s all he can think about.
I also asked Draco what memory he had used when he had conjured his Tigress Patronus. He told me he was thinking of the day I woke up in the hospital after my suicide attempt, that it was the first time I had told him I love him and that he had been so happy to get another chance with me. That even though it was a really hard day for both of us, it also was one of the happiest moment of his life. And then he said that he didn’t dare to think about Christmas afternoon and I told him I felt the same. We both laughed and kissed some more before we fell asleep that night.
Harry lays down on the grass and pulls the Snitch from his pocket. He lets it fly up into the sky a little before he grabs it and pulls it back. Neville still walks around, busy inspecting the plants around them.
Hermione stands up. Her hands shake a little. “Harry James Potter, you are charged for abating Draco Lucius Malfoy’s escape from prison. How do you plea?”
Neville blushes and looks back at the chessboard. Harry’s eyebrows are drawn together and he tries to stop laughing. What is this that Neville is hiding? Does he want to be the one in tune with Ginny? Is he the one with a crush on her? Harry should ask him soon. Before Ron figures it out and kills Neville.
‘But Flint worships you now,’ Draco writes. ‘They would never have won. Zabini is a horrible Seeker.’
Once Remus is gone, Neville turns on Harry. “And what about Malfoy?” he asks. “What the fuck is he up to that the Dementors attacked you.”
A soft smile forms on Harry’s face as the tips of his fingers slip over Draco’s hand. And then he’s gone. He falls away from Draco, his arms stretched out as the wind blows his robes out. Draco watches Harry become smaller and smaller until he’s out of sight. Draco feels as if he should scream or cry. But he’s numb. He can’t make a sound. Slowly he loosens the fingers that still hold onto his broom. He looks up to watch them leave the wood one at a time. He could get back up his broom now that he isn’t holding up Harry’s weight, but what is the point? Harry is gone. It’s all over. The Dark Lord has already won before the war even started. And it’s all Draco’s fault. His eagerness to catch the snitch, to out best Harry on a broom. Who had ever thought the war would be decided by something this silly?
“If it all fails, it could be an option,” Draco utters. Maybe that way, Harry won’t leave him in the end.
“Yes, I know. But still. Do they even mention Draco?” Pansy says. She opens the Daily Prophet. Draco looks up and stares again at Harry’s face. He wants to scream that he didn’t mend to kill him. That he loves the bastard. But he can’t. If he wants his mother to survive he needs to keep his head down. It’s almost time for Easter break. Draco will be in the same building as the Dark Lord. He can’t have him think Draco didn’t mean to kill Harry. It will be the end of him. The end for all Malfoy’s. And Draco won’t have any more blood on his hands. It’s already bad enough he’s responsible for Harry’s death. He can’t be responsible for his mother’s too.
“I believe natural births can take hours, even days,” Draco answers. He’s read all about it in one of his books. Of what is normal and what to expect when you give birth. He knows most of it was not applicable for him, but it’s hard to find pregnancy books that focus on only male pregnancies. So Draco has read all about what it’s like for a woman.
Harry laughs and pats Draco on his shoulder. “Welcome to the club. I think about everyone here has walked in on them having sex at least once since they started fucking each other on every surface available.”
“I know, love. Just be glad you didn’t share a house with those two for over a year. I was afraid to eat from my dining table.”
After a while, Draco urged us to continue to walk up the path back to the castle. When we were about halfway there we saw Ron and Neville run towards us. I pulled off the cloak and we stopped them. Draco told them it was already too late and Ron let out some curse words that shocked Neville. Hermione gave Scabbers back to Ron and he was happy to see the rat. But Scabbers was writhing in Ron’s hand, plainly terrified of something. That is when Hermione spotted Crookshanks. Scabbers slipped from Ron’s fingers and scampered away. Crookshanks sprang after him and before anyone could stop him Ron was running to catch up with them. Hermione yelled after Ron and was gone in seconds. Draco, Neville and I looked at each other for a second and then we were sprinting after them.
“So that is what you guys were up to. I always wondered what that was all about,” Draco says. He looks towards the window and signs. Then he turns back to Harry. “I think we need to talk to Dumbledore.”
“It’s just a stuffed animal,” Draco tells her. “Harry couldn’t help himself when he saw this one. Said it was perfect for his newest godchild.”
We ended up in a tunnel. Hermione wondered where it would go and I told her it probably goes to Hogsmeade. We moved as fast as we could and the tunnel looked like it went on forever. Until it finally started to rise and we ran into a disordered dusty room with our wands raised. All the furniture in the room was broken and the windows were all boarded up. Ron and the dog weren’t in the room, but a door to our right stood open and led us into a shadowy hallway.
Talking about Quidditch. You remember me telling you that Draco was fighting with his hair the entire match. Well, Daphne showed me how to make a French Braid around the sides of his head so the shorter hairs won’t pull out of the ponytail so easily. And ever since then I’ve been braiding Draco’s hair every morning. First, it was just to practice, so it will be perfect by the time we have to play our next match. But now it’s more because I like doing it, and Draco loves it when I touch his hair and brush my fingers lightly over his head. Daphne says it’s sweet and Greg just thinks it’s a weird gay thing he will never understand.
At that point, one of the Dementors came for me. It raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hood. It was terrifying to see. Where its eyes should be there was only grey scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But it had a mouth, a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle. The Dementor’s hand were strong around my neck, it forced my face upward, I could feel its breath. I closed my eyes and for one second I gave in to the fact that I was going to die. And then I heard your voice again, mom. Screaming and begging for Voldemort to let me live. You sacrificed yourself to save me and I would not let it be for nothing. I was going to fight. I started to think of all the amazing memories I’d made with Draco. I thought about the first time he kissed me, and the first time he told me he loved me. I thought about Christmas and how we did a little more than just kiss for the first time in our lives. I thought about how good it felt to come with Draco’s mouth on me and of how he told me he loved me over and over again when I returned the favour. All the memories together worked, I did it. A silver dragon shot from my wand and I could see it chase the Dementors away. It’s the last thing I remember from that moment. I think I fainted on top of Draco after that.
Dinner starts and everyone around Harry is talking with each other. Harry doesn’t pay them much attention. He keeps staring at Malfoy on the other side of the room. He looks like he’s having a good time with his friends and Parkinson.
After a while, we got up and walked with Fawkes on our tails out of the chamber back towards Ron. Ron had managed to move enough rocks in the time I was gone to make a gab where Draco and I could climb through. Professor Lockhart was also still there. Ron said his memory was gone, that Lockhart had no clue who he was or where he was.
“What happens now?” Harry asks. His hand holds Draco’s and Draco concentrates on how their fingers fit perfectly together. It’s easier than thinking of the dead baby inside him.
“How did the training go, by the way?” Neville asks. “Do you think you guys will be able to defeat the Slytherins?”
Professor Lupin was a bit surprised when he saw that Draco was with me during this lesson. He chuckled a little and mumbled something about it being a miracle that Snape was right for once. And then we got down to business. Professor Lupin had brought a Boggart, sure it would turn in a Dementor because that is what I fear the most. He told Draco to stay behind me at all times, that there is no need for the Boggart to turn into his biggest fear again. And I completely agree with that, it’s no fun to see your own dead body on the floor. I still haven’t forgotten the last time and how upset Draco was for days after.
Harry takes Draco’s head in his hands and forces Draco to look at his bloodshot eyes. Harry places a gentle kiss on Draco’s lips. “You are my dream,” he says. “I’m not lying. I don’t want any children if it isn’t with you. I love you, and I know you are worth everything.”
Harry just needs to forget he ever knew Draco. He needs a fresh start. One without the memories and the pain inside his heart.
You wouldn’t believe the relief that washed over me when Draco knelt beside me and took me in his arms. I grabbed his hand and won’t let go of him. I didn’t know how to speak, to tell him how sorry I was for almost leaving him forever. I won’t repeat everything he already told you yesterday. Just know that I was shaken and scared, but also happy to be back with the people I love. Sirius and Draco made sure I got to the hospital wing. The supposed Professor Moody was with us. He questioned me. When Sirius and Draco both fell asleep, I knew something was wrong. And then Professor Moody called Voldemort the Dark Lord. And I remembered that Voldemort had said he had a spy at Hogwarts, one that had put my name in the goblet of fire.
“Just a pregnancy test,” Draco says after he opens his eyes again. He would hate it if he would miss Harry’s reaction to his statement. The way his eyes start to twinkle and his mouth turns into a massive grin.
The fire in the hearth crackles. Harry stares at the flames. It started to snow again this morning when they were at breakfast. The window next to the hearth is covered in white dust. Harry had wanted to go fly some today. Ron was keen to join him, but when the snow started, he backed out. And Harry didn’t want to go alone. He wanted a distraction from his thoughts. And he won’t get that when he goes out all alone. So now he sits in the common room with his friends. Ron and Neville are in front of a chessboard. Hermione sits next to Harry on the sofa with a book on her lap. It’s a normal relaxed Sunday. If only Harry could relax too.
Draco had promised to take me clothing shopping last summer, so I would look amazing all year long, and not only in winter when I could wear the sweater that I’ve now lost. I’m very happy that I’ve gotten a new sweater of Mrs Weasley this year with Christmas. I hadn’t expected it since I don’t hang out with Ron anymore. I’ve sent her a thank you note saying I’m very grateful. I never thought about sending Mr and Mrs Weasley any present. I should have, they took me in during the summer holiday and made me feel at home, even after they found out I was bent.
“I wanted to say goodnight to Draco. Tell him not to be sad, that my mom and dad will look after my little brother.”
Hagrid let us out the back of his cabin after that because Dumbledore, Minister Fudge, a committee member and the executioner were already on their way to his cabin. Hermione had put Scrabbers in her pocket and Draco pulled us both close again while I threw the cloak over us. We took one last look at Buckbeak and then hurried around Hagrid’s cabin. Hermione whispered that she wanted to hurry. Tears were falling down her face and Draco pulled her even closer. We could hear the door open behind us and then we heard men’s voices while we hurried up the path. The men behind us went silent and then we could hear the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe. Both I and Hermione hid our faces against Draco’s shoulders and he pulled us both even closer against him. I was really glad he was there with us, otherwise Hermione and I had just ended up sitting there on the floor crying in each other's arms.
I’m been looking at this blank page in my notebook for a while, not sure what to write. It’s hard to think back to what happened. I got hurt very bad at the end of February. Most of the bruises have healed by now and Madam Pomfrey mended my broken bones quickly. But I had gotten glass in my eye and it’s still not completely healed. Also, I still have headaches and I need to take pain potions every night to fall asleep.
Professor Lupin made some light that illuminated his tired, grey face. He told us to stay where we were and moved towards the door. Only the door slid open before Lupin could reach it. In the doorway stood a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. It drew a long, slow, rattling breath and I got very cold. I noticed Draco was also shivering in my arms. The cold crept deep inside me, into my heart. And then my eyes rolled up into my head, while I was drowning in cold. I felt like I was dragged downward until the screaming started. It were terrible, terrified, pleading screams. I wanted to help whoever it was and tried to move, but I couldn’t. It was like I was trapped inside a thick white fog that moved inside of me as well.
“Just as Ron and Hermione?” Neville jokes. “Sure, Harry. I might have a scar above my eye, I’m still not blind.”
“Don’t I know,” Harry says. “You would think that me having a boyfriend would stop them from hitting on me.”
“Yes, even my father is involved with the search,” Ron says. “Not standard work for the head of the Department of Charmed Muggle Artefacts.”
Harry should stop it. He knows this. It’s not like his staring will make Malfoy and Parkinson break up all the sudden and make Malfoy gay.
Malfoy with his platinum blond hair and fair skin. The boy who says he likes Quidditch but hasn’t been to a single match this year. The one person at the Slytherin table who doesn’t receive any mail in the morning.
After I lost Slytherin so many points I swore to myself not to meddle in things that aren’t my business from then on. No more sneaking around and spying. No more trying to stop Snape from stealing the sorcerer’s stone. I would just go to my classes, sit with the Gryffindor’s, since I wasn’t welcome anymore at the Slytherin table, and study hard for my upcoming exams.
When Karkaroff came to collect the Durmstrang students to go back to their ship for the night he froze when he saw me. Draco and I had just gotten up to leave and our hands were locked together. Karkaroff his eyes moved from my scar quickly to my hand. Then he shook his head and left without saying a word, the Durmstrang students hurrying to follow him. Draco told me that night that Karkaroff uses to be friends with his father, way back when Draco was just a baby. Karkaroff has been to Azkaban for a short time just after the Wizarding War that killed both of you. Draco has no idea why he was released so quickly since most of the Death Eaters arrested back then are still locked up.
I also found out it had been the headmaster that had sent me the invisibility cloak. He said you used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food, dad. I wish I knew the way to the kitchen. I’m sure Ron and Neville will be delighted to get snacks more often. Oh, and it seems that professor Snape hates me because you saved his life once. The headmaster didn’t elaborate, but I wish I will one day find out what it is you saved him from.
After lunch we had division, and Professor Trelawney didn’t waste any time to predict my oncoming doom. I have again difficult times ahead of me. I’d almost fallen asleep in her class, my head resting on Draco’s shoulder when Professor Trelawney made me pay attention and said I was clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn. Draco laughed next to me, but the professor paid him no attention and went on, saying I was born in midwinter. I corrected her and said I was born in July and by then Draco had to hide behind me to hide his laughing.
“Yes, that is perfect,” Hermione says. “Then you have to pay attention in class for once, instead of trying to steal my notes all the time.”
And now the holiday is almost over, we’ve just got this weekend with New Years and then it’s back to classes and our normal life. No more laying in bed until almost lunchtime, or taking long strolls in the cold snow just to pass the time. Mrs Davis is very proud of me. She said I’m dealing well with all the crazy things that have been thrown my way this year. I still see her like ones a month now, just to make sure I’m still good. I don’t have to do any crazy homework for my therapy anymore, but sometimes I wished that I didn’t need it at all. But I’m scared that will never be the case, with my crazy life.
And on the last day before the Easter holiday, Ron and Neville came up to me during Charms to apologise for thinking I was the heir of Slytherin. They know I would never attack Hermione. Ron held out his hand and I shook it. Draco gave both of them an evil look, but I told him during lunch that he had been just as bad, ignoring me all the time. That even though he never thought I was the one causing the attacks he still made me feel like there was something wrong with me. And that if I could forgive him for that, I could also forgive Ron and Neville for thinking what they did. Draco said he would try to be nice to them again, but only if they would treat me with respect.
“That is understandable, Harry. It’s difficult to grasp that nature isn’t always black and white. But you shouldn’t give up hope. You are both still young, and there is a good chance it will happen any moment now,” Burke says.
Neville nods his head. He knows. Harry blinks away a tear. Neville is willing to die if it means saving Draco. The fool is just as selfless as his parents were. He will protect the ones he loves above all. And because Draco is the person Harry loves, he’s become a part of the small circle for who Neville will give his life.
“I have no idea what you're talking about,” Draco says. “All I can say is that during dinner, Teddy wants to make an important announcement, and until then, both of you know nothing.”
The Dementor is right in front of them and Harry’s insides freeze. He shivers and looks up at the empty hole where the Dementor’s face should be. “We’ve done nothing wrong,” Harry says. A faint scream echoes in his head. His mother’s screams from long ago. The agony she went through when Bellatrix Lestrange tried to torture her to death after Voldemort had gone. Harry blinks away a tear. He hasn’t remembered that night in ages. The nightmares about it left him before he could properly remember. Only to return now, as if it happened yesterday.
Harry rubs his hand through his hair. Why can’t the book put it down this simple? Somehow Draco can explain the material in a way that makes sense to Harry. This is why Harry works on this essay now. He will never be able to do it without Draco’s help. Even his mum can’t explain it as Draco does. When she does it, Harry also gets confused half the time.
And that is how this year went from being fun to being a nightmare. I’ve got no idea how I’m going to get passed all the trials ahead of me. Not now there are so little friends left that want to help me. But at least I’ve got Draco and Hermione on my side, a godfather that looks out for me and a head of house who’s let me know that if anyone is giving me a hard time, he will put them on detention, making them clean slugs and other nasty tasks.
When I woke up again I could hear Draco and Professor Snape speaking with the Minister. The Minister didn’t believe that Peter Pettigrew had bin there, even though professor Snape and Draco both confirmed it. Snape said that of course, that didn’t mean that Black was innocent. Draco disagreed and he asked for his wand, over and over again. Ron was also there, he spoke up and said he heard Pettigrew confess to betraying the Potters and killing all those Muggles twelve years ago. The Minister said that the students must have been under a Confundus Charm and that they should go on as planned. I could hear Draco shout that they couldn’t, that Black is innocent and that they can’t give him the kiss.
Professor Lupin asks for a chance to explain and gave us all our wands back. He put his own wand in his belt and asked if I was now willing to listen. I asked him that if he hadn’t been helping Black, then how did he knew where we were. Lupin said it was because of the map, that he had been looking at it, knowing I would sneak out to go see Hagrid. He said he knew how to use the map because he was one of the people that made it. And he knew about my cloak because he had seen dad disappear under it a lot of times. And then he continued that he’d seen us come back from Hagrid with an extra person. We told him there was no other person, but he just continued that he’d seen on the map that Sirius had pulled Ron and the other person away. And then he asked to see Ron’s rat Scabbers. Lupin and Black said it wasn’t a rat, but a wizard. An Animagus by the name of Peter Pettigrew.
Well, I’m sure you will understand that Draco’s father wasn’t all too happy about that. That afternoon Draco got a very long letter from his father. It went on and on about how Draco was ruining the Malfoy name and that he should be ashamed of himself for showing these feelings to the world. He should know by now that even though he might think he loves me, that he will marry a good pureblood girl one day to continue the Malfoy name. Draco was really upset about the letter. He still pretends he doesn’t care what his father thinks of him and that he hates the man. But I can see that it’s hurting him when his father talks to him like he’s the biggest disappointment ever.
“Have a good year,” James shouts after him. “We’ll miss you, even though you can’t wait to get away from us.”
“To talk to Hermione, in private, please.” Harry knows he sounds desperate and that Ron will suspect something is up. But he doesn’t care. He is desperate.
‘Let’s start with the simple yes and no,’ Harry writes. Malfoy nods and then looks as Harry makes the sign for yes. ‘This is yes,’ he writes as he shows it again. It’s a simple sign. Just a fist with the thumb on top that nods. Malfoy repeats it a couple of times.
Harry watches as Draco’s cheeks turn red as he ducks in time for the retaliation. His hair flows around his face and he seems to enjoy himself. There is a twinkle in his eyes as he throws another snowball at Ron. Harry smiles and tries to ignore the aching to move and take Draco in his arms and kiss his pink lips. He glances away from them and sees that Neville doesn’t pay their friends any attention. He stares at the Shrieking Shack as if it holds all the answers.
“Ah, you’re all here now,” the headmaster says. “Good. I’m sure you are all wondering why you’re here.”
But we didn’t crash into the castle, Ron had swung the steering wheel and was whacking his wand against the dashboard and the windshield, shouting stop. Only that didn’t work. We crashed into a tree, and not just any tree, no a dangerous tree called the Whomping Willow. We landed on the ground and I was really happy I was still alive and that Ron wand looked like the only thing that was broken. But we weren’t save jet. As I said, the Whomping Willow is a dangerous tree. It started hitting the car with his big branches. For a moment we both thought we were done for, but luckily the engine restarted and Ron was able to back us up far enough to get out of the tree’s reach.
“Nothing, Harry,” Neville says. “But Hermione does have a point. We don’t know Malfoy. And Remus promised he would help. We can let him deal with it. We’ve got enough on our plate as it is.”
Harry nods. He closes his potions book. He hasn’t written a single word for his essay in the last half hour. Snape will be happy when he can again take points from Gryffindor. Harry doesn’t care anymore.
Not that it matters anymore. None of it does. Not since the moment they took him. Not when Harry found out he was too late.
Only Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Draco’s sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. He said in wonderment that his master had given him a sock and that he was free. Mr Malfoy just stood there frozen, looking at Dobby, Draco and me and then he lunged at me, shouting I had stolen his son and his servant. And then there was a loud bang, Draco’s father was thrown backwards and Dobby shouted at him that he shall not harm Harry Potter. Draco’s father got up and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger and told Draco’s father that he shall go now and that he shall not touch Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy. Draco’s father gave us one more incensed stare and then he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.
Draco has been researching for Buckbeak’s trial all alone. Hermione also seems to have no spare time to help him. She has an immense workload. Fred and George said she sits in the corner of the common room every night, with loads of books and file upon file of extensive notes around her. She barely speaks to anyone and snaps when she’s interrupted. Draco says Hermione is insane for taking so many classes. I just wonder how she gets to all her classes. Some of them seem to be at the same time as the classes she shares with us, only she never misses any of those. So how can she go to the other classes at the same time?
