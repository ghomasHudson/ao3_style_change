"Well just Harry, did you ever had the urge to do something a normal person wouldn't do and don't you hate every meal that's in front of you and don't you think that when you got a wound you heal faster than anyone else?" Hagrid said.
"Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day." Harry said sympathetically when he was finally standing next to Cho.
Then Harry heard something different from his own loud pumping heart and the werewolf's growls. Twigs snapping. The werewolf seemed to notice too, because even he felt silent looking towards some bushes behind Harry, ducking his head for something Harry didn't know.
He started making circular motions around the tip, fondling Draco's balls in the progress. The sounds his boyfriend made whenever he did this never failed to send blood rushing towards his own member. Together with the sight that lay in front of him, sweating and shivering…
Seeing Wormtail walking towards him, he tried to stand up and took a couple of steps back. But it was a trap, the statue grabbed him, holding him still. Harry panicked, he couldn't do anything. He looked over at Cedric taking a deep breath while trying to regain the courage his house was known for. He tried to use all of his strength and move the goddamn statue but it wouldn't bug.
Harry was preening at the mark, the spot clearly visible and standing in deep contrast with the rest of Draco's skin. He felt satisfied, huffing with his pent up breath against it. He closed his eyes and let out a happy rumble, Draco's scent surrounding him like a cosy blanket...
Touching the edge of her entrance he stopped. Shuffling around, he lifted the wand and took a quick look at Hermione. She lay there with her eyes closed and an arm covering her mouth, a desperate attempt to keep quiet even though he had heard her moans before. It was a hard thing to forget when it were those sounds that had driven him off the edge every morning he woke up with a tent in his trousers. That is to say, practically all of them. Which was another motivation to hear every single one of them tonight, no matter how stubborn she was.
Now, as Hermione fumbled with putting her hand back, apologising before experimentally massaging his twitching prick through the agonising confinement of his pants. He knew this was right.
'That must be Neville.' Harry thought remembering Hermione was looking for the toad and said it belonged to a certain Neville.
The white wolf turned around again and began sniffing Harry as if it was looking for injuries. And Harry just kept laughing looking at the wolf in amusement starting to pet it. The wolf only seemed to huff, looking Harry in the eye again. Harry's laughing slowed down, and then he finally recognized it.
"It's-it's…" Harry said, bringing his hands to his head, pulling on his strands in frustration. This is not how it was supposed to go.
Draco was helping Harry up and stood beside him, eyes turning yellow, ready to take a bite out of the figure.
"No, Hermione, I'm not. Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. But out there when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like." Harry said truthfully and sat back down, face looking at the ground.
Harry felt an immediate pang in his chest thanks to Ron's words, remembering the look of shame Ron showed when confessing about his crush on Hermione.
"Damn Draco, you're telling me that while I tried my hardest to keep my hands off of you, you were actually-" He swallowed, feeling Draco's lips back against his shaft. "Fuck Draco!"
Her head popped up, eyes squinting just above the fridge door. "I believe that's a second copy of Jack Griffen's; the truth about the invisible man. It cleverly debunks all the inaccurate statements of the story made by H.G. Wells about the species. Too bad muggles won't be able to read it though, it's a great piece of literature."
Yes, of course, he was disappointed that Harry- no Potter wasn't with him, kissing him, hugging him, telling him he loved him. All of that hadn't happened on the Quidditch world cup, he didn't even go to the men's room! But he dreamed about those things all the time, so he was kinda used to it.
Harry took a small step back and tried to think of something to say. To make that cute worried frown of Draco disappear.
Draco quickly positioned himself in front of Harry, sitting on the vampire's lap as he gave him a longing kiss. He was so glad, he'd almost expected Harry to say no and tell Draco that he shouldn't ask that. But now…He was finally gonna do it! He was shaking from excitement.
and actually start to like him, he needed to tone it down a little. So if it meant shutting his mouth and bearing the stupid taunts Weasley was yelling at them, so be it.
Harry looked away from the mirror, deciding to give his thoughts a rest and instead watched as his friend rubbed his neck and murmuring complaints.
After a few seconds, Draco started staring at the other boy's lips. He traced them with his eyes, appreciating their soft colour.
"Oh, but I can fully imagine it. You with pink rosy cheeks and a pink apron on, baking cookies for your mate, the cookies in forms of little hearts. While you sing something sappy like 'I'll make love to you'." Hermione giggled, confusing Draco.
Having Harry's cock inside him, made him appreciative of the vampire's steadfastness at stretching him out. It was as if the bloody thing was filling his entire stomach! Did it hurt? Yes. Was he going to let that prevent him from thoroughly enjoying himself? Certainly not.
"Sooo, you're gay," Ron stated, standing with his hands on the doorframe of their room, and basically giving Harry a heart attack. Seriously, he was a vampire with super hearing! He should be able to hear when people were coming out of nowhere!
And just so you know McGonagall is a shapeshifter that can shift into all sorts of animals but not into different creatures/monsters/humans. I will keep Dumbledore a wizard and a powerful one at that. And Hagrid… is just the same, because it's Hagrid and he's fabulous.
"Is it true you fainted?" Malfoy asked him, sounding concerned. But Harry had obviously mistook that, because not even a second later the guy next to him pretended to faint which made Malfoy say, "I mean, you actually fainted?" in a mocking voice.
"I take it you like those?" Harry asked, a fond smile playing on his lips, making Draco feel giddy. He was really enjoying this, sitting there with Harry, waiting for the countdown to start. He was glad he had voiced his thoughts, otherwise, he was sure they wouldn't be sitting here now or at least with the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere that was hanging around the room. Draco found that he enjoyed hearing Harry talk, his deep voice was rather soothing and his stories were not that bad.
"How to get on the platform?" The woman said in a kind tone. "Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. Now all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms nine and ten. Best do it a bit of a run if you're nervous."
"What?" Hermione asked more calmly, a little thrown off as she frowned. "No, of course not. We're here to study. That's what we're here for. To study... as a study group."
"Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban to await trial for conspiracy and sedition." Fudge said showing his authority that Harry didn't give a fuck about. Anyone who listened to Umbridge had to him, the mindset of a sack of potatoes.
He frowned and turned to see Draco, still in his Quidditch robes, his eyes shining with something Harry didn't know as he smiled at him… and almost giving Harry a heart-attack.
Draco was silently eating his lunch. The Slytherin table was practically deserted, much like the other tables. After Severus had given all of them an assignment to write a report about 'the history of weapons and how they're made'. It was only to be expected. And even though most were still researching everything, Draco was already done. He'd already read the most useful books about them and only had to freshen up his memory, and then had started to write.
"I'm coming to get you, you sneaky little bastard!" Ron yelled as he tried to climb out of the mountain of snow that was dropped onto his head. On purpose. It wasn't really a success though for a moment later there was an ever bigger mountain dropped on top of him.
"Hello," Potter said looking at Draco with a frown on his face while his heartbeat calmed down a little.
"No? Then what about all those times we were sitting on this couch? Have you been dreaming about your mouth on me?" Harry asked, biting his lip again.
In defense, Harry hadn't felt this pressured on his first date. Then it had been nothing unusual from going out with Ron or Hermione and he just rolled with it. In some moments having fun and in others feeling an awkward silence pass between them. But he hadn't felt this anxious for a simple date before. Thinking he was about to screw something up. Something
Draco moved his lips to meet Harry's. His eyes shutting closed as he relished in the feeling. 'Finally, finally,
"We were not-" She blushed, taking a quick look at the sputtering Weasley. As she turned back to them she said, "I just wanted to have a talk with Ron…a-about stuff. We saw it fit to do it in a more private place, and since you two always occupy the room of requirement we thought- Wait a minute." She squinted her eyes, making Harry shrink where he stood before letting out a large gasp, "Don't you try and change the subject, Harry James Potter! What the hell were you two doing-"
"Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you," Hooch said, looking over at the Slytherins. She opened the trunk and all the balls flew out.
He had received a letter back -pretty fast thanks to Pig- he had found himself continuing to write letters to Hermione for the rest of the holidays and had enjoyed that she was writing him back.
"One moment I'm trying my best to make him happy and the next I'm calling him out on something that wasn't even his fault. I don't blame him if he's loathing me by now." She said as she lowered her head in shame. "I don't know what's wrong with me, I haven't been acting like myself lately and instead like a total bitch."
But now that he had the chance, he was going to take it. And it was probably going to be even better knowing he was going to spend it with Harry.
"Two chocolate frogs, please," Ron said, taking them out of the woman's hands as he handed her the money. Giving her a polite smile as he did so.
It was intermission and Draco found himself in the men's room all alone, which was quite strange since there where more than a thousand men in the stadium tonight and since it was intermission you'd suspect that some drunk people would be lying on the floor after they'd tried to take a piss. Sure, there were more toilets in the stadium, but it was hard to believe that one of them could be empty. Not that Draco was complaining, hey! Free privacy, why complain about that!
He knew in some part of his mind he was being a little unfair, here. That his insecurities were taking over and that he shouldn't doubt his boyfriend like this. But…again. He'd been acting really off lately. Something Harry still couldn't explain and was too afraid to ask. Because what if it really was like that?
"Jesus Harry! Need I remind you that first period has already started, I thought you had potions?" Dean said, rubbing his sore butt. Harry's eyes immediately shot open.
Grabbing his toothbrush, Harry put some toothpaste on it before cleaning his teeth. After that, he took a quick toilet break before walking back into the room and walk up to his mirror. Scowling at his image in front of the mirror.
ahead. Trust me, I bet she has already started this whole programme to drag us with her to some extra classes, if we wanted to or not." Ron deadpanned, still able to remember those days were Hermione kept burying a book in front of his face, forcing him to memorize them from front to back. And even when that had annoyed him to no end, it had done the trick and now he wasn't sure if he'd been able to pass as many tests as he had if it hadn't been for the bushy haired werewolf.
"Me? I'm the coward?" Harry asked in a calm, disbelieving tone. "I'm the one who's been an asshole towards everyone around me for five years?" Harry said his tone getting a bit stronger while he walked towards Malfoy who's face had gone pale. "I'm the one who torments a boy who didn't want to be my friend in first
"Ron, Elliot has a girlfriend. You know he would never cheat on her, despite his relaxed attitude. The guy gets bloody hearts for eyes when he talks about her! Besides, I don't really see our Hermione falling for a clubber like Elliot, not to mention her absolute disgust with his eating manners," Not to mention that the few times they are actually hanging out together was mostly because of Ron himself. The times he had seen Hermione roll her eyes at one of Elliot's suggestive comments where far too many, no way she was into him.
Breaking the kiss again, Harry returned to what he was doing earlier. Pants flying across the room into the heap of clothing that was already on the floor. He crouched behind Draco, coating his member in lube while his boyfriend watched him. He noticed the blonde fidgetting and he didn't blame him. He took a deep breath, keeping his inner thoughts in the back of his mind. Those would be too much to handle right now.
Harry was waiting in the Surbiton Station. He'd received a message from Dumbledore that he needed him for something. What? Harry didn't know. The thing he did knew was that the old man was late.
"You've got no idea how confused I am, or how scared! I don't know why I'm being such a dick to you and Hermione! I didn't mean to ruin your night nor Hermione's! It just- it just happened." Ron said holding his head in his hands while his entire body was shaking.
Harry calmed down, his eyes turning back to their original color. He looked over at the Dursleys', Vernon and Petunia were dashing towards the direction Marge was thrown and Dudley was on the ground, fainted.
"Maybe some whine, or gigglewater? Don't worry, the label says it's consumable for all creatures, or would you rather have blood? Even though it's not in the fridge." Draco mumbled, opening the fridge to look at its contents. "You said you restocked it right?" He said, frowning as he moved his head around the fridge door to look at Harry.
"It's true then. What they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts." Harry looked beside him seeing a blond boy.
Draco again wanted to protest, claiming this really wasn't what he wanted, that he didn't like the way Harry was talking to him. He always did that, even though everytime it happened, in the end, Draco would always give in and confess how much he really wanted it. But being ashamed of his wants meant that it would go like this over and over again.
He pictured again how Draco would react if he'd stayed a little longer, how he would react when Harry started moving his fangs against his throat. How he would react when he would say how much he belonged to him.
"Draco, I swear to God, if you don't get out of this bathroom right now I'm going to break it open," He could hear Harry say and groaned as he put on the final touches. Looking himself over in the mirror he picked up his newest designer watch, giving it a thought before he decided against it and settled for his great-grandfather's instead. It was his lucky one after all.
'Control yourself Harry.' Harry told himself attempting to walk past him. He was lucky that the hall wasn't that crowded it would be humiliating to be called out by Malfoy in front of the whole school, especially after people had started to stop being afraid of him.
"No Hermione, I will not! I told them it was taco Wednesday…but they didn't listen. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN!" Ron yelled frantically, sitting down and folding himself up as he began to wail. Hermione taking pity on him, started to rub his back.
"Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?" Dumbledore praised Harry.
Harry drunk the last bit of blood out of the mug, still wincing as he drank it. It just tasted like, ew. The past couple of months Harry had drunk his blood with great effort. It had been difficult to swallow, it had become hard to taste anything other than iron and he didn't know why. Or maybe he did.
She must have noticed Harry questioning look because she went on; "Wendigos are known to be cannibals. We actually have a lot in common, vampires and wendigos. We both are very rare, we are both rather strong and we both need to feed on other people…"
As Harry looked from the glass window -noticing how the bright colors of the fireworks lightened up the room- to Draco… he was looking with eyes full of wonder, shining their sharp grey as his pale face reflected the deep purple-blue of the howling wolf, his jaw slack as he breathed in and out. He watched those eyes following every movement of the sparkling flakes, he found himself understanding Draco's favorite color.
Turning to the side, her vision was completely overtaken by the amount of food laying on the table. Her mouth started watering as soon as she looked everything over.
And then he thought about how stupid HE was.'Of course, they were in the Great Hall why didn't I think about that sooner.'
As a matter of fact, Draco thought bitterly, it didn't feel like Harry felt attracted to his appearance anyways. Maybe he even liked the pumpkin stain on his shirt!
"Oh bugger," Ron shivered, head falling against her shoulder as she cupped his stiffening member. He stopped his travelling mouth in favour of moaning up into her ear, encouraging her.
'Dammit Ron!' Hermione thought. Thankful for the closed curtain as she tried, with no success, to tame her bushy hair. Climbing under the covers to hide her bottom half. Straightening out the shirt, hissing as her hands came in contact with her breasts. Ron's head immediately shot up.
"Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No?"
And then he smelled it. A faint scent of the most delicious thing he had ever smelled, knowing it as the one and only
"And we'll keep on FIGHting 'till the end, DUN, DUN, DUN!" Harry and Ron sang, too drunk to give a shit. When they're on their way to the castle Ron came up with the idea to go through the forbidden forest, you know to speed up the process. Harry simply nodded and five minutes later they're singing 'We're the champions' from Queen.
When the time was up and Slughorn was walking towards them, Harry couldn't help but stir one extra time clockwise instead of anti-clockwise, he just hoped the notes were true.
Draco continued to grumble as he sat up their workstation, bringing out cauldron as well as some vials and organizing the rest on the table so he knew where everything stood. Now the only thing they needed to do was listen to Slughorn give a tedious speech about what and how they were supposed to do this, not caring that everything could be easily found in their textbook or that nobody was actually listening to the old buffoon.
Hurting was the last thing it did, a fact that Draco had to repeatedly justify when one of his co-workers asked for it. Not that it was any of their business, but then again, that is why he left out the gritty details. Maybe obscene was a better word for it, for the moans that left his mouth should definitely be categorised as
"Ah! H-Harry! S-st-op Nh! It! T-there i-is Oh! Really s-someth-ing wrong!" Draco cried feeling the heat down below growing rapidly and Draco really felt scared.
That's when the first moan came out, Draco stopped immediately, eyes wide and he was again shocked at his own body. Letting out a shaky breath he started again, a bit faster now.
Harry quickly snapped his attention to Draco, watching his face for a moment and disgusted with himself as he felt a little bit of satisfaction traveling through his body at seeing those pushy lips and disheveled hair. He took a step backward.
"You're absolutely right Fred. Now Ronnikins, strict to the point. When is the wedding and how late do you expect us to arrive?"
'It's the best strategy for sure,' Draco nodded, rubbing down on a particularly dirty spot, while Harry was still gathering all the petals. Holding them in the palm of his hand, close to his body. It was a wonder how those rough fingers hadn't crushed one of them yet. How they all seemed to be caressed lovingly by the large predator in front of them. Draco leaned in a little closer, moving his hand without a thought.
We also know that some students are now able to find their mates. If you've already found your mate we'd like you to inform us so that we can make some arrangements. Knowing that being mated so early will mean that you'll be very busy in you sexual activities, you must not slack off in any way in your performance at school. Or there will be a punishment for you both.
'Ah please don't tell me I'm here to ease Hagrids' nerves. Did I really just gave up my free night for this?!' Harry thought while putting on the cloak.
"Mom! You better not call me that when Emma gets here." Dudley said arrogantly. Emma was Dudley supposed to be 'girlfriend' and Dudley had been talking nonstop this whole week about how much in love she was with him and that he couldn't blame her.
And together with that small smile, Harry's plans to act all cool and composed flew out of the window.
Ron made an affirmative sound, before laying it back down. He picked up the next object, a snow globe. Red, white and blue flakes surrounding the Eiffel-tower. It reminded him of the countless snow globes he had received from her during Christmas. It had convinced him she was obsessed with the bloody things and it didn't take long for him to gift her with one of his own. He was curious how his magical representation of the burrow stood next to her ordinary muggle collection and asked with some amusement, "Where did you get this one?"
" Harry grunted, practically melting against the werewolf –who was starting to lick the outer shell in an almost ridiculously sensual way. "You want to get me killed?"
"Gryffindork?" Harry asked before shaking his head, "You know what, doesn't matter. But, the only real difference between them is that silver is kinda shiny and grey is not..."
"Sorry, need to go, almost late for the tryouts," Harry told Romilda quickly because he wasn't rude. Even though he didn't care what she thought of him, or anyone else for that matter.
Draco moved his head to the side to make it easier to move his mouth against his lover's. He had been pent up ever since transfiguration, daydreaming of Harry. He knew he shouldn't have, but he couldn't help himself; the vampire was on his mind twenty for seven, it wasn't his fault that the blown up parrot reminded him so much of the day Harry tried to alter a colour potion. He fondly remembered the way Harry's hair had transformed into a full-on rainbow. It had been quite charming.
"H-Harry?" That's when all previous thoughts where forgotten and the only thing he wanted was to hear that beautiful voice again.
When everyone was out of the way Ron swang his wand yelling; "Stupefy!" Hermione though had already moved before Ron uttered the spell and had already taken Rons' hand, turning it so that the end of the wand was pointing towards Ron. He looked wide-eyed and shrieked as he was blown backward.
When the tension finally started to diminish a bit, Draco began concentrating on his book again while Harry and Ron talked about the party some more. Half an hour passed just like that, the hall growing emptier by the minute as everyone started to relax in their common rooms. A house elf walking by gave them candy for helping clean up some of the rubbish that other students had left behind. There was still a couple of creatures in the room, in the corner of his eye Harry saw a couple of Gryffindor kappas attempting to play a prank on a group of Ravenclaw werecats. It didn't seem to go all that well, Harry thought with a smile.
The soft tapping of the rain as it hit the glass window of the room of requirement was a peaceful sound to Draco's ears. The way it dripped downwards as thousands of pecks gathered around the droplets. The massive dark clouds that moved from deep within the distance towards them, covering most of the blue sky.
"I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands." Slughorn tried to explain, noticing Harry was looking at the big mess.
But since he was a witness, he needed to come to court and help to decide about some death eaters fates.
But Harry still stood before the wall and started climbing. Strangely enough, it went with great ease.
"I don't know what you're talking about," Draco said, refusing to look at her as he denied that he knew
He squinted, trying to recall when he had last seen all of this. He remembered running around it with haste. Maybe searching for a bathroom?
"Fuck that hurt!" Ron yelled as Hermione brought a bandage to his neck and carefully placed it on top of the two punctures.
They heard the whimpering of the weird haired creature, but they were still too afraid to move… and there was also that thing with Rons' foot. And even though they were both scared they couldn't look away from the creature, it just looked so…unnatural. They hadn't expected that a werewolf looked like that, yes they had seen some pictures of werewolves but they never looked like that! They were more like, well, gigantic wolves.
"What? Come and live with you?" He asked trying not to show how happy the thought of finally leaving his horrible aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon.
"And you haven't? A moment ago you were trying to convince him you found a rare plant, which doesn't even exist!"
"You can do this Draco, it's only a week. It's supposed to be pleasurable, it's supposed to be pleasurable," Draco kept telling himself but couldn't help the panic that took over. This was all so new to him, the prickling sensation on his skin, the immense sweat, the heat of his body, the
"Fuck off Pansy!" He yelled as he stormed out of the Slytherin common room. Once arrived in the corridors he made his way towards the Great Hall, hoping it wasn't too late. His hope was gradually dimming, however, every time he saw another bunch of people passing him. Some in green robes, some in blue, some in yellow, but which color really made Draco bite his lip was the famous Gryffindor red.
"I-I have, I mean, It just so… strange. I don't know what's happening, well I have a suspicion but that can't be it, it just can't." Ron started and Harry let him go at his own pace. "Every time I look at Hermione, I just feel something in my gut twisting but in a good way, especially when I saw her in that dress, or whenever I'm around her or when she's doing a spell for me that I just can't do. It's just so confusing." He said dreamily.
So here Harry was, standing on an almost deserted railway station not knowing what he was supposed to do. Harry heard the opening of the dinner's door. "Hello. What yah doooing?" A waitress asked him. A hint of mischief in her eyes.
His thoughts were in haywire, spinning all around in his head. He let his hand tug at the strands of his hair before he swallowed, looking over at Draco. He was standing across the room, his back turned as he was looking out of the window. Harry wasn't able to see his face nor the emotions it would display. Truthfully, he wasn't sure if he wanted to see them.
Harry felt his hackles rise, shocked but not that surprised by Ron's outburst. He knew how much Ron hated the Slytherin, didn't understand how Hermione and he had found friendship with the blonde werewolf. And he understood his friend's reasoning, but it took great effort not to growl at him for the remark on his boyfriend. And try even harder not to just outright show his fangs to the redheaded teen.
When all was drank till the very last drop, Harry felt Draco slumping down and quickly stood up to keep the werewolf from falling over.
He moved a third finger in, making him gasp at the sudden stretch. He'd never put in more than two fingers, he didn't even finger himself that often. But the heat was making him bolder and having his mind clouded by Harry's scent wasn't helping either.
"Have you made your decision?" Another waitress stood before them, two large tubes coming out of her neck, her eyes a deep shade of blue while fins sprouted from her head.
Draco frowned a bit, as he tried to not show the disappointment on his face. He shook it away as he started getting the cauldron and fire.
Draco crossed his arms before huffing out an insufferable sigh. "Why wouldn't I? Harry, I don't think you've realised but you have more control than you think you do. I've seen you drink exactly the same amount of blood out of that damn bag like you always do –for
"Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is." Dumbledore said gesturing to Harry while looking at Slughorn.
When Harry thought about it, he had sneaked into the living room when Dudley was watching it. It was a weird movie, but that was probably because it was a movie that had much…nakedness and sex. Now he thought about, how did Dudley even get his fat hands on it?!
He really needed to be careful, to not get swapped away in the moment before he would do something that he would regret later. He just needed to get his act together and
"Have it your way." Harry had said, his tone even. He wasn't scared. He saw the cup lying a couple of feet away, but instead of running towards it he took out his dagger.
It was Christmas break and Harry and Ron were sitting in a compartment on the train. Hermione was nowhere to be seen much to Harry's disappointment, and Harry knew that even when Ron was denying to be upset about her not being here and not having said goodbye to them he most certainly was.
When Draco was on the train, back towards Hogsmeade station he found himself thinking, 'Why was I smiling? Of course, I was happy for Dobby and stuff, but it felt more than that… It's also kinda strange I wanted to bite my fathers' arm off. I mean, I never experienced that, and I've seen him do more awful things then trying to claw out Potters' eyes. There is really something wrong with me.'
The room was filled with their harsh breathing. Draco trying desperately to hold Harry into place while he moved his face against his. With both eyes closed, Draco moved his knees up the desk, lifting himself up moments later as he straddled Harry's lap. He then proceeded to tangle his arms behind the vampire's neck, scratching his claws against the dark locks on the back of his head as Harry groaned inside his mouth.
The Hall had already gone back to its loudly self and most people weren't putting any interest in Potter anymore, which was good. But the rest was still whispering about him, some openly staring with dreamy faces as others sometimes glanced at him, much like what Draco was doing.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry said sounding a bit irritated. But she was already standing up.
Harry just rolled his eyes at Ron's drama, looking at his own spot with a blond boy already sitting next to it. He was reading a book and scribbling some things down, only lifting his head up for a moment to see the people who'd walked into the classroom before moving on.
Having Draco's pale skin so close to him made Harry slightly dizzy and having Draco's scent so close to him wasn't exactly helping either. Now that he was thinking about how he'd attacked Draco again, he found it absolutely impossible to think of anything else. He could still imagine him against that wall, Harry in full control as he watched him squirm, so perfect, so pretty, so-
He shuddered as he thought about it, but shook his head before looking back down at Harry. He scowled for a moment, sighing as he picked up a pillow.
God, when did he became such a dreadful liar? He couldn't even fool himself! How was he going to stop doing that after
"Cheers to that," Draco said and moved his glass to 'clink' against Harry's, giving him a bashful smile and turning his head to nurse his drink.
This made them take a step back, looking rather nervous. "A-as if we would be scared of you, Potter." Goyle said in a shaky tone, making it obvious they were. "Right Draco… Draco?" He said finally noticing Malfoy had already walked past them.
"Ha-ah Ronn" She whimpered, her thumb rubbing against her clit as three fingers scissored themselves inside her. She was hot, horny and so bloody desperate for more. She pictured Ron there with her. His soft red hair, his adorable little freckles, his soothing voice, his strong arms, his blue eyes. Encouraging her, holding her as she finished one orgasm after the other.
going to apologize. He was going to see Malfoy stalking out of the Great Hall. Why was he talking to himself like that?
"It's alright-Is almfight, you can stop mnow," Harry said, spreading his arms in front of him to make the waiter stop trying to dry off his face and take a step back. He took a small bow before hurriedly dashing away.
Draco just decided to shake it off, and move on. He looked back outside and saw… a flying car? And in it were, at least Draco thought it were, Weasley and Potter.
"I've heard Crabbe's review, and it seems I'm not missing out on very much!" Draco yelled back, making Pansy go silent.
Making Draco able to see all the muscles as they moved with him. His head ducking a bit in that adorable way, probably not noticing how it made his jawline pop. His raven hair a bit shorter, but that could also be because of a haircut. Draco sat back up straight, his mouth closed and he tried to make his face emotionless. Even though he knew that wasn't possible, neither was biting his bottom-lip wantonly.
"Potter!" She yelled, and Harry immediately stopped laughing and walked towards her as she beckoned her finger.
Still, that didn't change the fact that Draco had way more experience playing this particular game with his father, who –in his opinion- was one of the best chess players of all time. He didn't want to make Harry feel like he wasn't capable just because he couldn't beat Draco. He didn't like to win that way; it would be unfair and almost feel like cheating. That's why he'd hesitated, warning Harry that he was probably going to get defeated.
The room teems with students celebrating Gryffindor's victory. It feels like Mardi Gras. Or a mosh pit. Or a riot. And Ron was right smack in the middle of it. Smiling at everybody while the crowd yelled; "Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!"
," She stressed the word, eyes racking to the sound of music and laughter behind him. Her head moving from one direction to the other before she nodded at nothing in particular. He wanted to contradict that they were in fact
And he did, didn't he? It was a bit strange, he never really managed to cheer up his friends, he made them more angry than happy. But Hermione didn't take things personally, she just knew he was trying in his own way. And it relieved Draco.
Draco opened the entrance to the common room and sat himself down on the couch looking over at Grabbe and Goyle, waiting for them to sit down.
"Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. So focus, Luna." Harry said walking past her and seeing her dreamy but happy gaze.
"I warn you. This will be a bit of a shock." McGonagall said to both Harry and Ron before she opened the door of the hospital wing.
He needed to go further down the corridor and make a couple of turns before he saw a shadow and immediately froze.
She turned away, clearly avoiding his questioning stare. And when he tried to make eye contact with her again she simply shook her head, not wanting to talk about it.
"Sorry, didn't mean to make you upset." He said as nice as he could muster, frowning at his sudden outburst.
He could sense his eyes shifting to gold every now and then, somehow knew Harry's where as well. They should probably leave some space between them, in case anyone noticed them. But even if Draco cared at that moment, he would only see fellow dazed expressions that had their own partners to worry about.
Elliot grinned, an excited glint in his eye as he made the effort to swing his arm around Ron's shoulder.
She picked up the note with "Merry Christmas, Mione!" and couldn't help but pull off the wrapping as quickly as she could. She picked up a messy purple scarf which had some loops in different areas of it, which Hermione guessed wasn't supposed to. It was strange, surely Mrs. Weasley's knitting skills couldn't have gone that bad, could they? She pulled her lips in a frown as she brought the scarf to her nose, but was overwhelmed by affection as she didn't smell Mrs. Weasley but instead Ron's hands on the scarf. She quickly pulled on the scarf, not planning on pulling it off for the remainder of the holidays, knowing that Ron had made it for her.
Harry groaned looking down at his stomach. He was hungry, so bloody hungry. He had been for over four days. He had been the first day Hermione didn't show up, had slept on an empty stomach the second day, had been the moment he and Ron made the plan on the third and again when he'd stood up this morning.
He closed his eyes again, trying to focus on all the sounds around him. He heard Mrs. Williams complain to herself about all those nasty children that wouldn't leave her pretty garden alone. Which was quite strange, since Mrs. Williams lived in another street. He frowned, hearing cars honking at each other wildly when the only thing he saw on the street was the mailmen on his bike. Hearing children laugh on a swing while being pushed. Hearing a dog bark furiously at someone who tried to calm it down. Hearing three heartbeats in the house…
Not that it was that surprising, after having stopped touching himself for more than two weeks straight. Not wanting to dishonor his lover, even though he had done it before, many
"No, don't. I take it as a compliment actually, you seeing me as such an expert," Harry said, face smug making Draco laugh. Harry laughed as well before Draco let out a sharp hiss.
Hermione looked at Draco a bit hesitant. And as if he had just said the strangest of things. But she did need someone to help her with this. Someone who could understand it.
"Hmhm, and it's not like you've been acting like a complete arse towards your friends while throwing a fit about something your friend cared deeply about. Not even listening to their points of view as you think yours is never wrong –while, of course, imagining things that
The vampire will reach its full powers after its eighteenth year. With it comes a development to make its body more alluring to its surrounding muggles and/or creatures. It does this to make sure it'll be able to bring in enough food supplies. The victims will be to entranced by the vampires presence and pheromones, that they won't be able to; scream, fight or run away when they're being drank from.
"Why so tense Potter?" Malfoy said sitting in a tree. "My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last FIVE."
"Yeah, it's not like you've been purposely conspiring against me while keeping secrets from me for the majority of this year and then suddenly deciding to abandon our friendship in favor of that of another?" Ron spat, squinting his eyes as he looked over at Hermione.
"It's going to be amazing Neville, I promise you! Booze, music, girls…" Ron wiggled his eyebrows. He stopped for a moment as he looked at Neville's face, "…boys?" He again looked at Neville's face, "…both? Whatever, it's all going to be there! It will be the perfect opportunity for some time off after all that studying for the N.E.S.T.s. It's the break all of us desperately need in these dark times. See it as a farewell party, no! A prom! Instead of a birthday, all these years of hard work and near death experiences need to be remembered, don't you think? I see what you're thinking but relax, we're all adults I'm sure McGonagall won't mind…but don't tell her about the booze. Neville, I mean it. You can't tell her about the booze, understand?."
He put on his robes with a smile plastered on his face. These past few days he'd felt so giddy he couldn't help it. And he didn't want to either.
Harry swallowed, licking his lips in that obscene manner that made Draco forget about all rationality.
"Listen up now. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker, smarter-
"Thank you, Draco." She said while reading the paper, Draco waited, hoping she would just send him away. When she was done reading it seemed like she wanted to, but stopped before she said anything, looking over at the other students and then back at Draco with a glint in her eyes, making him feel alarmed.
Draco giggled as he remembered them silently making fun of Slughorn, seeing that the man had forgotten to brush his hair and it stuck up in two different directions, making it look like he had two horns. Slughorn had only noticed when dinner came and Dumbledore made a comment about it, making them both look at each other as they broke into another fit of laughter.
"Now that I think about it, we don't actually know the simplest things about each other…" Draco said, hoping Harry would take the hint. God, he was bad at all of this social interacting thing. But if he was honest with himself, he did want to know more about Harry. What he liked and what he didn't, and he didn't want to figure that out by a gossip magazine, he wanted to hear it directly from Harry. But he probably should have said this a bit more smoothe.
The last few weeks had been horrible. Umbridge was being an even bigger bitch and send at least five people a day to her form of 'detention'. Of course, one of those people was mostly Harry. The reasons for detention were just stupid. Mostly, it was because someone was being too annoying for her taste. Harry was even sent to it once because he sneezed, SNEEZED!
"If that's what you want, fine with me," Harry said simply, walking away. Only to turn back and motion for Draco to follow him. And after a while of standing there awkwardly in the middle of the abandoned street, a finger in the air pointing at no one in particular, Draco found himself matching Harry's pace. Following the other boy into a dark alley where the only source of light was the moon and stars.
She could just tell him somewhere in the weekend, or when things started getting normal between them again. But they would both be pretty busy with all the homework that would be unloaded upon them. Time alone would be hard to find, especially since Harry would be there. And Ron should really keep up with all the homework now.
Harry placed his hands on top of Draco's hips, enjoying all the different stimulations. The way Draco was holding on to him, scratching at him -He was acting so possessive, so greedy. Like he was marking his territory…
But he didn't know how Harry felt about it. What if he wanted to wait, telling his friends? That he wasn't comfortable enough to actually come out with their relationship. Or what if he wanted to tell her himself and didn't want Draco to interfere? Or what if he didn't want to tell her like, at all?
"You think this is funny?!" Ron growled, leaning over the table while glaring at the blonde. Harry knotted his eyebrows together as looked at his boyfriend, noticing the way he had leaned back in his chair as he gave Ron a sly smirk. Like he knew something they didn't. Ron –already in a bad mood- wasn't too keen to his boyfriend cockiness but by the way, the redhead didn't jump on him at first chance, he at least seemed to be acting with some sense…huh, he'd expected it to go much worse than that.
"You-you scared the crap out of me!" He replied indignantly, "What are you doing there anyway, hiding behind a stone wall?"
Great, he was already busy keeping a tight leash on his wolf tonight and could feel it slipping from his grasp within seconds as it began to wag its long-ass tail.
"I'm sorry if I seem like a bother," Draco said quietly, making Harry furrow his brows. But before he could say anything Draco spoke again. "I've never been really good at making friends. I tried but I always seemed to mess it up in some way and they would end up hating me or be afraid of me. So I've never really had a true friend, sure I had Crabbe and Goyle but they were only hanging around me because of my name, of the person my father wanted me to be. That's why I don't really know how to express my emotions, and I can imagine that is annoying to you. And that I make stupid mistakes I shouldn't. But I think you are a wonderful person and I'm grateful to have you as my friend." Draco finished with a shaky sigh, he looked up at Harry and gave him a small smile.
"Yeah, ehm…" Harry said, slapping himself mentally. Smooth, really smooth. Seriously what was happening with him and this awkward atmosphere?!
"Oh! You guys…were having a moment -sorry, feel free to proceed with whatever you were doing," She smiled and slowly backed away before Draco caught her by the arm.
She immediately spun towards the figure Elliot was gesturing at. The redhead stood there talking to the DJ. Signalling at the elf to speed the music up. The new pace got a round of cheering as people started dancing faster and wilder. She saw him saluting the elf before moving towards the gift table. She quickly picked up a drink, hauling herself towards the wizard.
"Disagreeing even at a time like this." Ron huffed out, a loving note to his tone. "You're impossible Hermione Granger."
'Hmm, or maybe wormwood? That could help accelerate the potion, and let the effects last longer. Only it could also make the side-effects stand out more, resulting in a lower quality of shimmering. No, that wouldn't be good either,' Draco mused to himself. They'd been working on perfecting their potion of knowledge, it had been assigned to them for their N.E.S.T.s with each group having a different subject. The requirements asked for them to: finish their potion within a certain time span; find out which ingredients worked best for their potion; find out the potion's history; figuring out how to bring up it's main effect the most; limiting the side-effects as much as possible and all of that in front of a room full of potion experts.
"I do respect your wishes! I have done all this time, haven't I? It was only an accident, truly!" Draco wanted to make her understand. His wolf anxiously turning circles inside his head.
"Champions! Prepare yourselves." Dumbledore yelled and turned back around to face the crowd. Harry went towards an opening and hoped he could just get this over with without any casualties. "On the count of three... one-
He was surprised at first, not understanding what was going on but when Granger and Weasley came out of the door he understood.
There was no friendly teasing between them, nor the light touches Harry would give him every now or then. The innocent smiles they gave each other, like they did the morning after Harry confessed, didn't really happen either. Harry seemed to avoid sitting to close, or standing to close, or even watch to close! Really, he would change his line of sight immediately after he'd take a too long look at Draco!
So good news is that I've found this site that helps with my horrible grammar and stuff like that! And after seeing all the mistakes that I've made, I'm really grateful for you guys putting up with it. I've mended my earlier mistakes on ff.net and I'm planning on doing that here too, probably tomorrow though, because I don't have time right now. :(
He continued this while lifting his head every minute or so to watch as people filled the classroom.
After dinner, they were headed -with their head boy- to their dormitories. They were standing before a stone wall, the head boy was saying the password to the entrance. But Draco wasn't listening, he would ask Crabbe or Goyle later, he was too much fixed on his thoughts. 'Why didn't he even gave me a chance! Alright I know I was rude, but still! That stupid git.'
He lowered himself as much as he could –while being in a sitting position- being as submissive as possible for the clearly stronger vampire. The satisfied rumble that came soon after it making Draco let out a wanting whimper.
"Ron, I promise you that I'll not let Harry overdo it. So please." Hermione whined, making Ron swallow his next protest and instead making him say yes.
"Oh my God is Ron in there?!" Ron heard the same person yell before he felt footsteps nearing the pile.
When Lupin walked towards Draco trying to see what was in the closet he was shocked but he still didn't get it. The only thing Lupin saw was… a small boy, with blond hair, sitting with his knees to his chest, sobbing.
"No, that won't be necessary," Lucius said in a timid tone Harry didn't know Lucius possessed. Voldemort turned back towards him.
And don't get him started on Ron and Hermione, absolute disasters. Hermione saying how wonderful the food was, how exquisite the decor, what a splendid time she was having...for the tenth time that evening. She had been trying way too hard and it showed. Ron being significantly worse as he seemed to purposely act like a savage, speaking with his mouth full, calling fellow guests morons under his breath, pushing people aside- it did help Harry loosen up a bit, laughing at his friend's obvious antics to be as equally disrespectful to the visitors as they were towards the vampire. Disapproval practically radiating off of the redhead when another one came and asked for an autograph.
"...But why would you think that you wouldn't be worth it?" He held her cheek, staring at her with a confidence she didn't see often, "Sure that all sounds horrible when you look at it in that way and I am absolutely certain that it is going to feel like that sometimes. However, you are forgetting something crucial here. Companionship."
"It will be fine Ron," Harry said looking over at Ron, but Harry noticed a tiny movement from the Slytherin table. When he looked towards it he saw Malfoy packing his stuff and walking out of the Great Hall.
He walked back to his mattress and took a bite out of the energy bar while scowling. He looked around his room again, slowly growing more bored as time past by and his bar was finished. He looked where he had dumped his clothes and robe the previous day and frowned as he saw Hermione's paper bag in the mess.
"Oh, please spare me. I already had to go through all that once in my life and I don't intend it to happen a second time," Draco huffed, pitching his voice a tone higher, '
"I see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done. I thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about. Just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in."
and she would do this to me for months on end! Even when I would say she needed to get her head out of her arse, she still wouldn't do it! Then one day she finally seemed courageous enough, and next thing you knew she came crying to me saying you were dating
It was morning and Draco was having his breakfast, he looked over at the Gryffindor table to see Harry staring at him with a little smile on his face.
'Shit's about to go down.' Harry thought as he eyed his friends warily. It was never good when Ron decided to yell back at Hermione, but it couldn't be helped now. Harry fully understood Rons' upcoming outburst, but at the same time didn't want his friends to fight.
Oliver said but was interrupted by George. "Not to mention they're dead terrified Harry'll let them be victimized by the monster if they fly anywhere near him."
"You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!" Harry cut him off.
"Should I call you my boyfriend from here on out?" The reddening of Ron's cheeks brought her a sense of joy she hadn't felt for a long time. Before the beginning of the year they would bicker endlessly for weeks on end and that one time she would be able to get the upper hand with one of her remarks, the one time where Ron would get all flustered and speechless, was so satisfying that the aggravation she got every other time bleached into nothingness. "Or would you prefer the term impeccable and handsomest beau."
Still, he couldn't shake the feeling something was off. That it was less pleasurable than it normally would be. That he really,
"Forget it I'm gonna go for a run," Draco said and walked out of the door, not even bothering asking if they would like to come with him.
Okay, maybe she was exaggerating a bit. But just to be sure she decided to tell him after the N.E.S.T.s. To avoid at least that.
He heard Rita say, but had already crumpled up the newspaper and threw it into the fire before he could hear more. The fire flared up a little, and a face appeared in it.
"Here you go, Harry needs at least one filled goblet per day with it. That poor thing, how could I forget something so important?! You need to go, he's probably starving right now." Hermione said, her body filling with guilt and the knowledge she failed Harry. She handed the blood bag at Ron and hushed him away.
Draco was sitting on the train looking at the scenery outside, he was thinking about what Hagrid said, "Rotten to the core, the whole family…
"Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use it well." Slughorn said giving the potion to them. Both Harry and Draco frowned.
Yes, they had become friends, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to do everything in his power to beat Gryffindor. Every game he had given it his all, running as fast as he could while searching for the snitch, focussing on even the tiniest of movements, even when he was mostly...
That's what he kept telling himself as he walked through the corridors, getting more and more fidgety as he neared the hidden door of the room of requirement.
Draco looked a little confused as he swallowed his last bite of pudding. They were sitting in front of each other on one of the tables in the Great Hall, there weren't many people there. Some first-year Hufflepuffs, a couple of Slytherin's, three Ravenclaws and a group of Gryffindor's. Harry didn't know them that well though, so he preferred to sit with Draco. Though, he couldn't really think of someone else he would rather sit with.
let go of him. He looked out of the corner of his eyes as Harry let himself fall beside him, laying on his elbows with a smug look on his face.
"Fine, give me your goblet." She said, on which Harry eagerly gave it to her. She picked up her back, making a small opening to make sure no one sees what's inside of it and grabbing the blood bag out of it. Harry watched almost transfixed as she poured in the blood, licking his lips. After she handed it to Harry, he gulped it straight down.
But then again -Harry realised as he felt his head becoming clearer and clearer- she had also been going to their Quidditch practice way more often after that. Actually, he couldn't recall one time she hadn't shown up with one of her books in tow. And now that he mentioned it, she never read them while she was there. Her head firmly concentrated on the game in a way Harry had never seen her do before…or maybe it wasn't the game entirely?
Draco gave his husband a cheeky smile, continuing to drive his bottom downwards. "Isn't it because of my irresistible charm? My handsome looks? My-
"As I told you once before, Mr. Potter, naughty children deserve to be punished." Umbridge said making Harry want to rip her heart out (if she even had one) more than he wanted with Voldemorts'. He held himself back, though it took great effort.
"Strange? Pfft, I'm not acting strange, you're acting strange," Harry said trying to be nonchalant, but as he saw Draco stop and watch him with a raised eyebrow, a skeptical look in his eye, he knew that the werewolf wasn't buying it.
It had been a couple of days after Harry was caught by Malfoy after he'd stumbled into the birdcage. After that Malfoy had avoided him at all costs; not looking at him, not talking to him, walking away when he saw Harry.
"Today we're going to try and repeat the Volubilis Potion, and I want to see your best work!" Professor Slughorn said.
"Than I'll go make sure Ron doesn't do something he will regret later," She said, biting her lip as she slowly started walking back towards the door and opening it, halting a moment as she looked back saying with a wicked glint in her eye; "I won't disturb you guys this time," before finally closing the door behind her.
It was then that he noticed the little upbeats in his boyfriend's heartbeat, that same day Draco had taught him what those different beats could mean giving multiple scenarios; when someone was being dishonest, when someone was pretty excited, when someone was feeling a bit nervous, when someone was keeping something from you…
"You're wrong!" Goyle yelled which surprised Draco, and again for the thousandth time that night Draco frowned.
"Harry Potter… is death!" The monster yelled. Draco felt as if he couldn't breathe as if someone had just stabbed him. "By me, Lord Voldemort himself!"
"I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it? It was completely intentional." Ron said to his brothers who looked at him with an incredulous expression. While Hermione was giggling with the other girls.
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times." Harry answered while nodding. If she wasn't so stupid she'd know the sarcasm in his voice.
He wasn't at all ashamed to admit that it was the thing that always managed to get him over the edge, untouched and so fulfilled.
Harry noticed that everyone was sitting on the edge of their seats. He walked over to the chair and sat down.
He watched fascinated as Harry quickly undid his trousers, his face and hands both showing to be complete opposite as his hands opened his zipper with eager fingers, all the while his face kept the same relaxed, cool expression that made Draco go nuts. Harry's green eyes bright as he looked up at him.
"Last time I saw them, they appeared to enjoy themselves quite a bit," She told him, cursing herself for not having made pictures of that adorable slow dance, where Harry clung to Draco like a lifeline as the blond waltzed all around the room.
Harry couldn't believe this, he was simply beaming! Nothing could wipe away the smile on his face now!
Ron closed the fridge and made his way to his bag, grabbing a chocolate frog out of it. He walked back and sat on the chair he'd placed there before, handing her the bottle and frog.
Because no matter how much he thought about it, he shouldn't put too much hope in his crush. Knowing his love was probably one-sided. As if Draco would ever look at him like that.
"Of course I won't and… thank you," Harry smiled at both of them, making himself ready for spending two whole weeks without them. Which reminded him.
"Thank God, 'cause I don't know if I would be able to stop myself if you were going to say no," Harry said, jokingly. Having pushed himself up to look down on the blonde.
"Oh! But of course, sweety, come on sit down!" Draco sat beside her on the couch thinking on how to approach this. Narcissa, seeing her son was having trouble on how to explain his issue, came to his rescue.
"DON'T YOU DARE, You know exactly why I'm here! You fucking know that you aren't supposed to be in the forbidden forest on a FULL MOON! Did you know what could go wrong if I wasn't there! Not only would Lupin break all your stupid vampire bones, but you'd also be eaten by Granger!"
His blood was way better. Way purer. He was sure that if the vampire gave it a try, it would surely be superior to the other one. Why hadn't Harry asked to try his blood anyways? So what if he had fainted and almost got himself killed the first time. Didn't mean they couldn't try again! His father always said second time's the charm.
"Mr. Potter, you say. Are you perhaps the same Mr. Potter that freed Dobby from master Lucius?" Holly asked, her tone calm but still cold.
She whined before slapping her hand over her mouth to stop the sound from leaving her mouth. She blushed as she looked at Draco.
Draco looked up from the pillow to stare at his watch, seeing that it was already past twelve p.m. Draco decided to stand up from his sitting position to walk towards his closet. He opened the doors to find his clothes neatly organized as they hung on the hangers, like always. He touched some of his different pajama's as he seemed to contemplate which one he was going to sleep in tonight. There was still the familiar chill from the cold weather inside the room, especially after he'd decided to spend the night at the fireplace at the Great Hall, not having been able to light his own so it could warm up the room.
He felt like a kicked puppy. He'd tried so hard to get Malfoy's attention and he'd just outright ignored him, instead of giving him tasks and avoiding his gazes.
Draco said nothing, not knowing what he should say and knowing that when he'd say something it'd probably come out like an insult.
Harry watched as there came a storm of letters inside the house. He was jumping up and down and took a letter from the air with the intention (of course )to read it. But he already saw uncle Vernon running towards him so Harry ran to his cupboard but he failed.
"One hundred, I will need your expertise on this," Harry said seriously, walking next to her as they walked out of the Gryffindor tower. They waved at the fat lady who they heard singing all the way through the corridor.
"Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?" Harry asked Hermione thinking she literally knew everything.
Neville peaked up again to look at his two friends, staring curiously at one another. He sighed out of relief when he found the previous murderous intent in their eyes had finally subsided,
He groaned, a shiver racing up his spine. He abandoned her nipples, hands at her sides while he shifted his body so that he was at eye-level with her. Golden eyes stared back at him, searching.
Some would yell at him about him being a monster, or about their loyalty to Voldemort. Those were immediately sent to Azkaban.
Harry froze in his place hoping the wolf hadn't noticed him yet, but then the wolf put his nose high in the air sniffing it and Harry knew he was doomed.
Harry couldn't help but return the smile, standing straight they started their little battle and this time Harry wouldn't hold back.
He quickly shut the door behind himself, breathing out a sigh of relief as he finally entered his room, breathing out a "Made it," before starting to palm his cock.
That's when he came. His eyes widening, his mouth gaping as his breath froze. His entire body tightening as pulsing ropes of come spilled out of his cock.
Harry watched the stiff piece of flesh with something close to wonder and adoration. He wanted to worship it. Give it all the respect and care it deserved and more. The way the small dribble of pre-cum glistened in the moonlight, resting in the small little hole that was in the middle of its pink head. It was a magnificent sight. The way it stretched out to almost the same length as Harry's, only where Harry's was thick Draco's was slender, standing straight up while Harry's bend slightly to the right. Typical.
Harry's eyes were blown wide when Draco pulled away, letting out a loud strangling moan before pulling Harry back for more. Surprised, Harry felt his confidence spiking. Pushing into Draco's mouth more and more, letting himself growl when Draco let it all happen. Submitted to him. It was…erotic.
It was the last one, and she just hoped this one was going to prove her wrong. It NEEDED to prove her wrong. There was no way that, that…
He was becoming desperate, his toes curling up and his lips swelling up thanks to how much he was biting them. He then finally looked down, only now noticing the way Harry's eyes bore into him. The forest green eyes watching him with interest and desire. They seemed to shine even brighter when Draco looked back at them. They squinched up a bit, understanding flickering in Harry's eyes before he slowly let go.
Draco -still not able to look at Harry- willed his dark thoughts away. He shifted his gaze slightly and blinked.
"Seriously Hermione you're still doing that," Harry said, now probably believing her but still being too stubborn to give in.
Harry closed his eyes and stretched his arms out into the air. When he opened them again he tried not to get overwhelmed with how much he was able to see. Even months after his little 'transformation' he still wasn't used to opening his eyes in the morning and seeing everything as sharp as it was supposed to be. Not needing to bend over anymore and pick up his glasses.
He breathed out a curse, smothering his face in the crook of his elbow. Then, he strode towards her, resolution in his eyes as he cupped her face and started pushing her against the nearest wall before kissing her urgently. It wasn't as soft nor as gentle as the first one, although that one had grown quite heated within a short period of time this one could only be described as open-mouthed passion. He made sure to put in everything he had, every swipe, every lick, every trick in the book to make her knees buckle and fall against him. "I love you, so fucking much," He whispered against her lips. His hands moving purposely down her sides, checking if she was alright with this.
"Actually, she does," Harry said, wincing when he saw Draco's shocked expression. He ducked his head, shrugging his shoulders. "She was worried as well, Ron was too, afraid I was going to starve myself. She looked into it and apparently found something that could help. A recipe I think? Doesn't matter. It's this blood, I guess you would call it altered blood or whatever it is. I don't exactly know what she does with it or how she gets it –alright that sounds very suspicious but I guess she just puts something in it because…" He stopped, unable to open his mouth as he imagined it. That rich, heavenly taste.
. In a way that could actually solve your problems, because –you know, it will only make them worse, considering it will make you both even more annoyed; which makes it even harder for you to focus on what the other is saying; which makes you yell even louder; which will result in you trying to throttle each other. But you two are more mature than that, aren't you? You know it doesn't actually help?"
"Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one." Katie Bell asked, and Harry found his attention towards a small tiny vial with some golden liquid in it.
"NO! I don' want too!" Ron yelled, but Harry just dragged him with him to the door, while Ron grabbed Harry's half full tankard and gulped down the rest.
"Harry Potter," Slughorn said, smiling at him. Harry was still a bit confused by why Dumbledore had brought Harry here. He was looking around, seeing a well-lit room with a big, worn out armchair, a dirty floor, a broken lamp, and stacks of books all over the place.
"Relax, I've asked her permission and she said it was fine," Ron said smiling again. "Besides, you should have seen those awful looking energy bars. I haven't even eaten them and I just know that I would never want it. She's already in such an unfortunate condition, so I will do whatever it takes to make it less horrible. I mean she's all alone, and after her…" He cleared his throat. "heat wave finished, she wasn't really bothered with me being there. I will only keep her company for a minute and then I'll leave, I promise."
Harry gave it a lousy swing. However, when the weapon reached the surface of the counter, the entire counter broke in half. Harry quickly put the weapon down.
The room felt quiet, the only sound being the cracking of the wood in the fireplace and the soft rain clashing against the rooftop. They could hear people running outside the room, laughing and screaming as they walked towards the Great Hall.
So, I'm very proud of myself for giving you guys this chapter on time. Especially since after I posted my last chapter, I've been sick for three days. (And I still went to school, I know I'm crazy) and yesterday I needed to finish a presentation for tomorrow, so I didn't write those days. BUT I STILL MADE IT! HOORAY!
"Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better." Harry said still scowling and looking Ron dead in the eye as if to say; "Don't put the blame on somebody else"
"Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee… Mm. Alas. Earwax." Dumbledore said.
"I-ehm," Was he really touching himself right now? "I don't," What would he be touching? "It's not," What would he be thinking about? "No one, just…" Who would he be thinking about?
"Or what?!" Draco laughed, standing still for a moment and waiting for Harry to take another step. He frowned as he didn't hear the Gryffindor's heartbeat anymore, nor any crunching from the snow, and he wondered if maybe Harry had left.
Harry didn't know what to do. He wasn't sure what to do. Did he really figure it out? What was he going to say? Did he now hate him for being attracted to Draco? A Slytherin?
"I-eh, you know me and Draco have been getting… uh quite busy lately with taking the next step," Hermione blinked, not sure if she was hearing this right. "W-what am I talking about? You've seen it for yourself… Sorry about that, by the way. We didn't mean for anyone to see
"I know, and I'm sorry. I know you're in heat and you probably don't want to see me, but could you let me in?" Harry pleaded, feeling stupid even for asking.
"Draco? Draco, are you alright?" Potter said after a while, waking Draco up from his trance. Draco blinked for a while as he moved his head so he could look at Potters' worried face. He was looking nervous and unsure.
And as he looked at Draco, right now, seeing those tears traveling down those rosy cheeks, his pain making Harry's heartache… didn't it make that chance so much bigger? And besides…
Draco was still angry and out for murder but knew the old man was the only one who had a chance at winning against HIM. When he looked back towards Harry's lifeless body he frowned, the body was shaking and wriggling. Again he was not the only one that noticed and saw more than one head turning towards it.
, thank you." She spat, the tension heavy in the air. In the corner of her eyes, she could see Neville slowly folding in on himself.
"Expecto Patronum," George said with a swing of his wand showing a beautiful coyote in the sky. Patronuses where already difficult to create even for the magical creatures, so for those non-magical creatures it was even harder. There weren't many spells like that, spells that non-magical creatures could do too, but the Patronus was one of them.
A bushy brown haired girl walked through the doorway. "Hey, have you maybe seen a toad? A boy named Neville lost it." She said.
"What! Of course not! I finally have you don't think I'm giving you up yet." Harry said indignantly.
When Harry had entered the Great Hall his eyes had immediately fallen on the adorable looking Slytherin, sitting alone and looking around, waiting for Harry. Draco was wearing a green jumper with a cute little reindeer on it. The jumper made Draco's flushed cheeks even more pronounced, and had a good effect on his cheekbones. Harry'd been so entranced by the whole picture that he hadn't even noticed Draco finishing his breakfast and moving to stand up.
at him. Every time he realized he wasn't the one who needed to crane his neck to look up at the other's face anymore he felt a tinge of excitement running through his vanes.
How it happened, Harry didn't know, but suddenly there was a snake on the stage and Harry started talking to it asking if it could leave the boy it was hissing at. It worked and Harry wanted to help the boy but was stopped.
Ron's brow lifted, clearly having been unaware of the hostility he had been showing towards her. It made her think, Ron never was very good at keeping secrets from her. His open personality making it hard for him to come off as indifferent when being asked too many questions. Apparently, he still hadn't found the trick.

"I'm sorry, but I don't know if that's my place to tell. But-" Hermione said quickly, seeing Harry's irritated face. "- I do think I'm able to help until then, so just have a bit more patience as I'll make the preparations."
Vampires were known to be one of the most confident creatures of all time, with their high status and overall good looks. This had been confirmed by Severus, telling Draco about Harry's arrogant father strutting from place to place, thinking he could do anything and have anyone. No way that Harry would doubt himself so much as to take the liquid luck for their first date with a father like that.
'Okay… that's weird.' Draco thought. A moment later he could smell the presence of another werewolf, it wasn't a strong scent though, probably a mudblood.
Harry snuck a glance at Draco, who was being dragged along by a cheerful Hermione. They met each other's eyes, both looking at each other with a look uncertainty.
"Um, I, I just supposed…" Potter began, but when Draco thought about the idea a little longer he found out that thirteen was indeed better.
"E-easy, now," He shuddered, Hermione's nose a tickling sensation on his ear. "That's-" He clenched his eyes shut when her leg tightened its hold, her teeth softly biting his ear, "Alright, maybe not easy. You can go ahead wi-
"Okay," Harry said slowly, taking it all in when the words that Hermione said actually hit him. "Wait, I can get a mate?" He asked curiously.
Well, guess what! I felt insecure too! I mean look at you! You're the emphasis on handsome!" Draco yelled, taking a step closer as he pointed at Harry. His eyes shining a dangerous gold as he felt his nails tingle.
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" Harry cursed to himself as he ran to platform 9¾, thirty minutes late. As to be expected, the entrance had closed and Harry was fucked. He could have strangled Emma for delaying him, why did she need to come over every day anyway?!
Harry thought, slowly feeling his fangs on the tip of his tongue. Urging him to bite, to let go and taste…taste…taste…
"Here master Draco, I've got you some bacon with toast and sausages. And of course your favorite tea." A house-elf named Holly said with confidence. She knew she could only talk to Draco with that kind of confidence, but she would never do it with his father or mother in the same room. She knew master Draco was a kindhearted young man even though he doesn't show it, at least when other people weren't around. Holly meets this kind Draco on rare occasions, such as Christmas.
"Aren't we supposed to wait 'till the fireworks for that?" Harry asked, smiling as he saw Draco's impassive face after he turned to face him.
It made Harry want to turn his head and do the same maddening thing to him, to teach him a lesson. But he quickly found that he didn't have enough control for that.
"Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today. Collect your books from the back of the class, that's the end of the lesson thank you."
"Stand back." The goblin said. He opened the door with a strange trick with his finger. And by the sound of it, there were many locks.
Three days, eighteen hours, twenty-four minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one…
He smiled as he saw Fawkes grooming his feathers and seated himself before Dumbledore who pulled his chair and sat down himself. Dumbledore lay his hands on the table and stared Harry right in the eye.
Her eyes widened in surprise while his mouth trailed down the slope of her throat, sucking and biting. She stood there, perplexed. Not sure if what she felt was real or if it was only her imagination playing tricks on her. Ron didn't seem to notice her slowed movements, his mind preoccupied with the taste of her skin. But her interest was peaked and so she moved a hand downwards.
"Thanks, I guess," He seemed almost desperate to avoid looking at her. Clapping his hands together he nodded towards Harry and Draco who were still sitting on the couch. She saw them chattering to one another, Harry leaning against the werewolf while softly caressing his hair. Draco laughing out loud at something the raven hair had said.
Harry cleared his throat, making the two shut up. He watched as they're inches apart. Hermione was still angry but Ron just…smelled strange.
Mcgonagall tapped her goblet and Dumbledore stood up. 'There it comes, the speach of another victory of the
"I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it." Dumbledore said, looking pointedly at Harry.
But even if his father whispered, Draco could hear it all with his wolfs' hearing and Draco knew that tone all to well.
"I'm happy you're doing it now," Harry murmured, which he was. He felt all of his earlier insecurities fade, the past events bringing him the relief and assurance he had craved so much. And now he knew for sure he was never going to do such a stupid thing again. Letting his self-doubt get in the way of things. As long as Draco kept looking at him in that special way, he knew they were okay.
"Accident or not, you didn't get to tell him he was my mate!" She yelled, making them all go quiet. Her breath coming out in large puffs. She was now thankful for the loud music, covering up most of their conversation and only attracting attention for the few passer-byes moving past them. She felt...defeated.
This is however only for schooldays, students can wear whatever they want in their free time." Harry was reading out loud about the Hogwarts' uniform and other stuff that was written in his letter. "Students are allowed to have pets but they should be kept in the student's room for precaution of the safety of the animal."
"Hey, Harry!" Hermione said, enthusiastic. It seemed he wasn't the only one happy that they're friends again.
Draco sat up rubbing his eyes in an attempt to make himself more awake. Draco knew he didn't have to rush… because he knew that no one would be downstairs. His father and mother were always busy on Christmas. With what? Draco didn't know.
When Hermione was done embarrassing Harry like a good friend would do, Harry noticed Malfoy and him had made a crowd. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at them, most of them in shock. But when it finally dawned on Harry why they were, Malfoy had already disappeared.
The whole crowd cheered as the heavy doors opened. People scrambling forward as music and lights filled the corridor in a blue glow. Slowly the cluster drained into the large room, leaving the hallway empty and forsaken as screams of
"Don't be," He said, reassuringly. A thoughtful look on his face before he licked his lips. "To be honest, I really like it when you go all...animalistic on me. Gives me the impression you can let your guard down around me."
Draco woke up to the grumbling of his stomach. He groaned as he opened his eyes, blinking furiously, as he saw the light fading through the curtains.
"Who says I was talking to anyone." He said with a clear tone of irritation and a scowl on his face, he still didn't understand why Ron just couldn't believe him, he was supposed to be his best friend!
To which Ron gave him an interested look, his brows tilted upwards as he seemed completely onboard with the plan. But honestly, if they really wanted to proceed with their conversation there wasn't really an option.
'Even though she's very odd, she does make sense.' Harry thought looking at Luna who was fishing a piece of meat out of her bag now and threw it in front of the baby, this time it did eat it.
At first, he'd been shocked by the revelation. The way Hermione had sputtered around making it all so clear to him. She hadn't tapped his blood for just
When his eyes traveled up to his face, he stared more closely. He saw that his fangs were out without him doing anything. Normally they showed up when he was getting angry, energetic, upset or extremely hungry. But this time, he was completely relaxed.
He'd been careful not to show it, not to get affected by it, but it had hurt to feel that tiny bit of hope being extinguished.
"I don't know if you know, Harry...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather," Sirius said a bit awkwardly.
Feeling a warm hand on his cheek -gently wiping away the tears- Harry looked down again, staring into glistening grey eyes. Now that Harry looked a bit closer, he found himself entranced by the color, the shine giving it an almost metallic color…
"Wait, hold on a minute, let me get this straight," Draco said, pointing an accusing finger at Harry who was laughing his ass off. "You're going to tell me, that you- together with Hermione and Weasley- knocked out Crabbe and Goyle," an abrupt laugh escaped Harry's throat as Draco continued looking at him with narrowed eyes, a finger still pointing at him. "Stole a lock of their hair, used polyjuice potion to turn into them, broke into the Slytherin common room, in the meantime breaking a dozen of school rules and all of that just to make sure I wasn't the heir of Slytherin?"
happen to you again. Do you even realise how much effort it costs me not to squeeze that bag from all of its content? Let it all flow down my throat as I wished there was more?"
"How was I supposed to know that, I'd never seen them before!" Harry said indignantly, poking Draco. "You said to throw in the Gilead buds, and when I asked, you responded saying that I should just pick whichever seemed to be the most likely one! If you'd looked one second away from your
urges, getting used to their little rivalry as he had been before all of the love stuff had been uncovered. He still found his instincts to be a bit strange…But that was a whole other thing to look into.
Booming laughter was the first thing Hermione heard as she stepped inside the Gryffindor common room. Her hair was soaked from the rain and her clothes hadn't gone by unscathed either. She wiped back a stray curl of her hair that had plastered itself on her forehead as she surveyed the room around her. Seeing that apart from the loud bunch of fifth-years, the rest of the room wasn't all that crowded.
"Yeah, yeah. You're scared, I get it alright." Draco complained. He knew he was being a dick, but just like she'd said at lunch: it was a full moon, give him a break!
Draco found himself biting his lip again, turning away as Harry kept on staring into empty space. The air around them seeming to change. He felt disappointed. His finger trailing the rim of his glass as he waited for Harry to get back on track. His wolf ducking his head, whining. It wasn't his fault, Harry couldn't help what he liked and didn't like. If that blood was the only thing he could stand than Draco couldn't be happier. So why did he need to feel so…

"Come on Draco, I've never seen something so obvious. True, I only put all the pieces together somewhere around fifth year, but I really don't understand how I didn't realize it sooner." She said as she laughed a little. "I mean, at first I wasn't really too keen on knowing you had a crush on Harry since you were one of the biggest prats I knew, but after getting to know you I finally understand you were just trying to get his attention. In some stupid ways which resulted in him pretty much hating you and wanting nothing to do with you-"
That it wasn't some stranger's weekly blood donation Harry had been suckling on -been craving for- gave him so much relief…he didn't know how to describe it.
Still, as he walked down the path towards the gates, Draco was on high alert. Trying to spot Harry in every nook and cranny as if the vampire was hiding behind one somewhere. He felt himself get a little distraught. He was twenty minutes late, for Christ's sake! He was never, ever late. Always making sure he was on time for whatever was going on. It was carved into his brain since he was a pup,
"Oops, sorry Draco," She apologized, petting his back in an effort to comfort him. She glared at Ron after hearing him chuckling, making him fall silent faster than you could yell
Not able to help himself as Draco occupied almost all of his attention. The blond-haired boy almost fell off one of the pillars, making Harry want to run towards him and completely ignoring the snitch that was flying right beside him. Felt himself slowing down as he watched Draco's backside muscles move in certain ways that made his head spin. Tripping as Draco smiled at him, his cheeks pink and rosy from running which made for the most captivating-"
"Great. Now you stand here. Harry, you stand up too, and stand over here." Hermione said as she pointed at the spots. They were now in front of each other, both looking puzzled as Hermione grabbed Harry's shirt.
and Hermione…he couldn't do that to Harry, knowing that him and Weasley were so close, he didn't want it to seem like Harry needed to choose between them, that would just be unfair to him. Furthermore, if Draco ever wanted Weasley to
"Actually, how would you be able to defend those hoops, I mean, they are at least 10 meters high!" Harry asked.
"Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to professor Sprout and madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified." Dumbeldore said on which everyone applauds. "Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled." Everyone cheered, well everyone save for Hermione, who was pouting.
"It isn't really heavy," Draco said as he picked it up. He frowned as he looked at it, seeing the logo of 'Tomes and Scrolls' printed on it. Why would he thank her for a book? He had a whole library of them back in Malfoy Manor. So what was so special about it?
On that moment Malfoy made a howling noise as to prove a point, turning the color of Hermione's eyes into yellow for a brief moment before she shook herself turning them back to their original hazelnut brown. She turned around, glaring at Malfoy who was smirking at her.
"Is it alright if I suck you now?" He finally asked, his face immediately erasing all previous indications of arousal he clearly had shown, settling for an emotionless devoid of indifference instead as he waited for Draco's answer.
"Mmmn." Harry moaned as he recalled the tastiest, sweetest, freshest blood he'd ever had the privilege to drink. Draco Malfoy's. He closed his eyes, longing to taste it again, to feel it slide down his throat, to pin Malfoy down against something and making it unable for him to move as he sucks out that delicious red liquid that-'NONONO! Stop right there!'
"Sst, ssst," Harry tried to calm Draco, grabbing hold of his boyfriend's hand after he let go as he was overtaken with panic. "It's not that bad, I can still drink blood and it does work. The only thing that's bothering me is the taste and it's not like I can just change to a different diet." Harry said, smiling before falling into a silence, a thoughtful expression on his face before he shook it off.
"Can't argue with that, but who is this person who thinks you're an insufferable know-it-all? Draco asked curiously, not having heard the first sentence.
"Incredible! Okay...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line. Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny." Lupin said. Draco dashed towards the end of the line hoping the lesson would be over before he got a change.
She breathed out a sigh of relief before she felt her face flush again for an entirely different reason.
"MOMMY, DAD COME HERE!" Dudley said with enthusiasm. "You won't believe what this snake is doing!" He said while pushing Harry over. Of course, Harry was angry now at that stupid git. What Harry and other people didn't notice was that Harry's eyes started to turn black while looking at his cousin. No one noticed it… accept the snake.
Harry groaned as he felt himself waking up, he slowly opened his eyes before quickly shutting them again. The sunlight almost blinding him, he sat up to clumsily try and close the curtains of his bed with his eyes still pinched tight.
"What do you understand!" Harry yelled at her disappearing figure, but she was already too far to hear. Harry turned to Ron in puzzlement.
. Like there was some hidden barrier between them that had been put up after their argument. It was as if everytime they were together there was some tenseness in the air and it just felt like their friendship was strained.
"Master Draco!" She cried, holding onto Malfoy's hand. She looked around, wanting to know why her little master wasn't being their top priority!

It had still his intoxicating scent attached to it! Making Draco shiver, not from the cold this time. He clung to the shirt like he was holding for dear life, moving his hands to his cock as he Harry's scent clouded his brain and filled the room.
"See, it was stupid to even think about it. Of course, you don't like me in that way," He laughed, but it didn't have any merit to it.
After a minute or two Draco felt himself restoring a bit, the soft but intense kisses Harry trailed over him making him feel more steady. Harry didn't have to be prompted as he somehow knew what Draco wanted without having to ask, which made Draco let out an even louder groan.
"Potter?" Draco asked calmly, almost sweet. And before he knew it, he was pushed against the brick wall. The air almost pushed out of him as he stared at the boy who was holding him against the wall. Potters' eyes had gone completely black and Draco could see his pointy fangs.
pleasurable, being able to touch him up close and to feel the intimacy blooming between them. It was what he expected on one side, but on the other, not what he had suspected at all. In a positive way that is.
Harry took a step closer to Draco, getting into his face as a look Draco had never seen before crossed his face.
Much to Harry's relief, Draco started laughing even louder. His whole body moving with him as he did so. Some fellow customers turning their backs in curiosity, trying to see what was going on as Draco wiped away a tear.
Harry stopped his thoughts, finally noticing that he'd moved towards the exit of the Great Hall, while others were partying or sulking.
"Yeah, you know… McGonagall might check up on us all, so, I think it's best that I go," Harry quickly lied. He didn't want to lie to Draco, and seeing the sad look in Draco's eyes wasn't making him feel good. But he really, really needed to get away from here, especially from Draco. "Here, I got you some apples!"
"Thanks, Hermione," Harry said, giving a glimpse of a smile to her. Not convinced at all, but knowing he should stop his self-pitying and just move on. "I'm just worried you know,"
"I should've known you were here, Professor McGonagall." He said with a smile on his face. With the end of the sentence, the cat transformed into a woman.
"Yeah, I've seen the movie. It was a bit strange, but what has that to do with anything?" Harry asked, frowning at Hermione.
"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last." Snape said in his indifferent voice.
He didn't wait for her answer, strolling towards the mini-fridge as if he owned the place. "There still something edible in here?" He asked with a hint of hope, twisting his neck to get a better view of his...friend.
"Thank you, Harry," Ron said and Harry smiled at his friend. "And about what you should do, I think you should- Harry wanted to say,
"Ron that- what? We will always be brothers, blood doesn't define that-" Harry stopped mid-sentence. "…we're getting off track. That's not what this is about,"
"S-sorry, it's just –wow- you really haven't changed," He said eventually, breathless from laughing.
He stood up as he moved out of the bed, already missing the soft and warm fabrics that lay on top of it. He then proceeded to scratch the back of his head as he walked to the little bathroom attached to the room. It wasn't that much, there was a simple sink as well as a toilet and small mirror attached to the wall. If they wanted to wash themselves, they would simply go to their dorm's shower room with some soap and a towel.
When he looked back up at Hermione and Ron, Harry tried not to laugh at Ron who's cheeks were almost the same color as his hair.
A picture of a hot sweaty Hermione coming to the forefront of his mind. He remembered how she kept on howling and moaning as she tried to get herself off, almost nothing covering that lean body except for a half shredded shirt and the covers of her bed. He remembered how that hand had suddenly disappeared underneath them, how she had been pleasuring herself right in front of him, on accidental, but still
"One hundred." She said with confidence that was rock solid. She knew him, trusted him and was going to give herself to him eventually anyway. It didn't matter if they waited for another week, another month, another year because she wanted this. She was ready.
"But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch." He said while handing Harry a small golden ball.
NO! Stop thinking like that, this was not the right time for getting all worked up and flustered like that. Sure, they had kissed…which had felt really good…maybe a little too good. But they hadn't even started holding hands, cuddling, or anything that was more explicit!
Harry's low rumble took him by surprise, the way he was lifted in the air also not quite what he was expecting –he was still getting used to the idea of Harry pulling his cheeks apart, bloody hell- but before he could panic he was set down again, this time though with a pillow underneath him.
Not that Draco minded, if he was honest the chill was quite refreshing. He tended to hate the summer just because of the nights stuck in the unbearable heat of the day and his own body heating. Werewolves tended to have warmer body temperatures than the average creature, so when summer hit it was just like standing in an oven, burning all day long.
"Hello, Potter," Malfoy said as he lifted his head again and gave Harry one of the most breathtaking smiles he had ever had seen.
Draco blinked a few times. That couldn't be true. It was impossible! Surely those tiny wounds would've healed already after two weeks!
He said before suddenly a splash of water landed on top of him, completely drenching him from the top to bottom. The clatter of every silverware in the room abruptly stopped. A waiter in front of him gasping as he stumbled back up from the ground, a large glass pitcher held in between his fingers as he stared at Harry with shock.
"Would you like to dance?" The vampire yelled over the music, making Draco wake up from his thoughts.
"Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it." She said and turned to Vernon while Harry was turned around smirking. Recalling him and Ron being stuck in the whomping willow.
"Of course I am upset," Draco sneered, "At least I'm not acting like I have been eating cockroaches for half a year."
"Cormac! That's who you invited!" Harry asked in disbelief, she always complained about the irritating Nephilim that wouldn't leave her alone, why would she even consider asking him out?! "I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace. He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant." She said, looking warily towards the see-through curtains. "Dragon tartare?" A waiter appeared behind the curtain with a tray, startling Harry, and Hermione.
"I don't mean it in a bad way!" Harry quickly said as he saw Draco folding into himself. "Come on, I know you've planned something, especially on Christmas day."
"Dragon Balls," Harry said, trying to sound as earnestly as he could, before the curtains were swept aside, showing Snape's strict face.
